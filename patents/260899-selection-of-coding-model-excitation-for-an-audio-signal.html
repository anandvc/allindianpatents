Background of the Invention<br>
In many audio signal processing applications audio signals are<br>
compressed to reduce the processing power requirements when<br>
processing the audio signal. For example, in digital communication<br>
systems audio signal is typically captured as an analogue signal,<br>
digitised in an analogue to digital (A/D) converter and then encoded<br>
before transmission over a wireless air interface between a user<br>
equipment, such as a mobile station, and a base station. The purpose<br>
of the encoding is to compress the digitised signal and transmit it over<br>
the air interface with the minimum amount of data whilst maintaining an<br>
acceptable signal quality level. This is particularly important as radio<br>
channel capacity over the wireless air interface is limited in a cellular<br>
communication network. There are also applications in which digitised<br>
audio signal is stored to a storage medium for later reproduction of the<br>
audio signal.<br>
The compression can be lossy or lossless. In lossy compression some<br>
information is lost during the compression wherein it is not possible to<br>
fully reconstruct the original signal from the compressed signal. In<br>
lossless compression no information is normally lost. Hence, the<br>
original signal can usually be completely reconstructed from the<br>
compressed signal.<br>
The term audio signal is normally understood as a signal containing<br>
speech, music (non-speech) or both. The different nature of speech<br>
and music makes it rather difficult to design one compression algorithm<br>
which works enough well for both speech and music. Therefore, the<br>
problem is often solved by designing different algorithms for both audio<br>
and speech and use some kind of recognition method to recognise<br>
whether the audio signal is speech like or music like and select the<br>
appropriate algorithm according to the recognition.<br>
In overall, classifying purely between speech and music or non-speech<br>
signals is a difficult task. The required accuracy depends heavily on the<br>
application. In some applications the accuracy is more critical like in<br>
speech recognition or in accurate archiving for storage and retrieval<br>
purposes. However, the situation is a bit different if the classification is<br>
used for selecting optimal compression method for the input signal. In<br>
this case, it may happen that there does not exist one compression<br>
method that is always optimal for speech and another method that is<br>
always optimal for music or non-speech signals. In practise, it may be<br>
that a compression method for speech transients is also very efficient<br>
for music transients. It is also possible that a music compression for<br>
strong tonal components may be good for voiced speech segments.<br>
So, in these instances, methods for classifying just purely for speech<br>
and music do not create the most optimal algorithm to select the best<br>
compression method.<br>
Often speech can be considered as bandlimited to between<br>
approximately 200Hz and 3400 Hz. The typical sampling rate used by<br>
an A/D converter to convert an analogue speech signal into a digital<br>
signal is either 8kHz or 16kHz. Music or non-speech signals may<br>
contain frequency components well above the normal speech<br>
bandwidth. In some applications the audio system should be able to<br>
handle a frequency band between about 20 Hz to 20 000 kHz. The<br>
sample rate for that kind of signals should be at least 40 000 kHz to<br>
avoid aliasing. It should be noted here that the above mentioned values<br>
are just non-limiting examples. For example, in some systems the<br>
higher limit for music signals may be about 10 000 kHz or even less<br>
than that.<br>
The sampled digital signal is then encoded, usually on a frame by<br>
frame basis, resulting in a digital data stream with a bit rate that is<br>
determined by a codec used for encoding. The higher the bit rate, the<br>
more data is encoded, which results in a more accurate representation<br>
of the input frame. The encoded audio signal can then be decoded and<br>
passed through a digital to analogue (D/A) converter to reconstruct a<br>
signal which is as near the original signal as possible.<br>
An ideal codec will encode the audio signal with as few bits as possible<br>
thereby optimising channel capacity, while producing decoded audio<br>
signal that sounds as close to the original audio signal as possible. In<br>
practice there is usually a trade-off between the bit rate of the codec<br>
and the quality of the decoded audio.<br>
At present there are numerous different codecs, such as the adaptive<br>
multi-rate (AMR) codec and the adaptive multi-rate wideband (AMRWB)<br>
codec, which are developed for compressing and encoding audio<br>
signals. AMR was developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project<br>
(3GPP) for GSM/EDGE and WCDMA communication networks. In<br>
addition, it has also been envisaged that AMR will be used in packet<br>
switched networks. AMR is based on Algebraic Code Excited Linear<br>
Prediction (ACELP) coding. The AMR and AMR WB codecs consist of<br>
8 and 9 active bit rates respectively and also include voice activity<br>
detection (VAD) and discontinuous transmission (DTX) functionality. At<br>
the moment, the sampling rate in the AMR codec is 8 kHz and in the<br>
AMR WB codec the sampling rate is 16kHz. It is obvious that the<br>
codecs and sampling rates mentioned above are just non-limiting<br>
examples.<br>
ACELP coding operates using a model of how the signal source is<br>
generated, and extracts from the signal the parameters of the model.<br>
More specifically, ACELP coding is based on a model of the human<br>
vocal system, where the throat and mouth are modelled as a linear<br>
filter and speech is generated by a periodic vibration of air exciting the<br>
filter. The speech is analysed on a frame by frame basis by the<br>
encoder and for each frame a set of parameters representing the<br>
modelled speech is generated and output by the encoder. The set of<br>
parameters may include excitation parameters and the coefficients for<br>
the filter as well as other parameters. The output from a speech<br>
encoder is often referred to as a parametric representation of the input<br>
speech signal. The set of parameters is then used by a suitably<br>
configured decoder to regenerate the input speech signal.<br>
Transform coding is widely used in non-speech audio coding. The<br>
superiority of transform coding for non-speech signals is based on<br>
perceptual masking and frequency domain coding. Even though<br>
transform coding techniques give superior quality for audio signal the<br>
performance is not good for periodic speech signals and therefore<br>
quality of transform coded speech is usually rather low. On the other<br>
hand, speech codecs based on human speech production system<br>
usually perform poorly for audio signals.<br>
For some input signals, the pulse-like ACELP-excitation produces<br>
higher quality and for some input signals transform coded excitation<br>
(TCX) is more optimal. It is assumed here that ACELP-excitation is<br>
mostly used for typical speech content as an input signal and TCXexcitation<br>
is mostly used for typical music and other non-speech audio<br>
as an input signal. However, this is not always the case, i.e.,<br>
sometimes speech signal has parts, which are music like and music<br>
signal has parts, which are speech like. There can also exist signals<br>
containing both music and speech wherein the selected coding method<br>
may not be optional for such signals in prior art systems.<br>
The selection of excitation can be done in several ways: the most<br>
complex and quite good method is to encode both ACELP and TCXexcitation<br>
and then select the best excitation based on the synthesised<br>
audio signal. This analysis-by-synthesis type of method will provide<br>
good results but it is in some applications not practical because of its<br>
high complexity. In this method for example SNR-type of algorithm can<br>
be used to measure the quality produced by both excitations. This<br>
method can be called as a "brute-force" method because it tries all the<br>
combinations of different excitations and selects afterwards the best<br>
one. The less complex method would perform the synthesis only once<br>
by analysing the signal properties beforehand and then selecting the<br>
best excitation. The method can also be a combination of pre-selection<br>
and "brute-force" to make compromised between quality and<br>
complexity.<br>
Figure 1 presents a simplified encoder 100 with prior-art high<br>
complexity classification. An audio signal is input to the input signal<br>
block 101 in which the signal is digitised and filtered. The input signal<br>
block 101 also forms frames from the digitised and filtered signal. The<br>
frames are input to a linear prediction coding (LPC) analysis block 102.<br>
It performs a LPC analysis on the digitised input signal on a frame by<br>
frame basis to find such a parameter set which matches best with the<br>
input signal. The determined parameters (LPC parameters) are<br>
quantized and output 109 from the encoder 100. The encoder 100 also<br>
generates two output signals with LPC synthesis blocks 103, 104. The<br>
first LPC synthesis block 10,3 uses a signal generated by the TCX<br>
excitation block 105 to synthesise the audio signal for finding the code<br>
vector producing the best result for the TCX excitation. The second<br>
LPC synthesis block 104 uses a signal generated by the ACELP<br>
excitation block 106 to synthesise the audio signal for finding the code<br>
vector producing the best result for the ACELP excitation. In the<br>
excitation selection block 107 the signals generated by the LPC<br>
synthesis blocks 103,104 are compared to determine which one of the<br>
excitation methods gives the best (optimal) excitation. Information<br>
about the selected excitation method and parameters of the selected<br>
excitation signal are, for example, quantized and channel coded 108<br>
before outputting 109 the signals from the encoder 100 for<br>
transmission.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
One aim of the present invention is to provide an improved method for<br>
selecting a coding method for different parts of an audio signal. In the<br>
invention an algorithm is used to select a coding method among at<br>
least a first and a second coding method, for example TCX or ACELP,<br>
for encoding by open-loop manner. The selection is performed to<br>
detect the best coding model for the source signal, which does not<br>
mean the separation of speech and music. According to one<br>
embodiment of the invention an algorithm selects ACELP especially for<br>
periodic signals with high long-term correlation (e.g. voiced speech<br>
signal) and for signal transients. On the other hand, certain kind of<br>
stationary signals, noise like signals and tone like signals are encoded<br>
using transform coding to better handle the frequency resolution.<br>
The invention is based on the idea that input signal is analysed by<br>
examining the parameters the LTP analysis produces to find e.g.<br>
transients, periodic parts etc. from the audio signal. The encoder<br>
according to the present invention is primarily characterised in that the<br>
encoder further comprises a parameter analysis block for analysing<br>
said LTP parameters, and an excitation selection block for selecting<br>
one excitation block among said first excitation block and said second<br>
excitation block for performing the excitation for the frames of the audio<br>
signal on the basis of the parameter analysis, and that said second<br>
excitation is a transform coded excitation, and said first excitation is<br>
other than transform coded excitation. The device according to the<br>
present invention is primarily characterised in that the device further<br>
comprises a parameter analysis block for analysing said LTP<br>
parameters, and an excitation selection block for selecting one<br>
excitation block among said first excitation block and said second<br>
excitation block for performing the excitation for the frames of the audio<br>
signal on the basis of the parameter analysis, and that said second<br>
excitation is a transform coded excitation, and said first excitation is<br>
other than transform coded excitation. The system according to the<br>
present invention is primarily characterised in that the system further<br>
comprises in said encoder a parameter analysis block for analysing<br>
said LTP parameters, and an excitation selection block for selecting<br>
one excitation block among said first excitation block and said second<br>
excitation block for performing the excitation for the frames of the audio<br>
signal on the basis of the parameter analysis, and that said second<br>
excitation is a transform coded excitation, and said first excitation is<br>
other than transform coded excitation. The method according to the<br>
present invention is primarily characterised in that the method further<br>
comprises analysing said LTP parameters, and selecting one excitation<br>
block among said at least first excitation and said second excitation for<br>
performing the excitation for the frames of the audio signal on the basis<br>
of the parameter analysis, and that said second excitation comprises<br>
using a transform coded excitation, and said first excitation comprises<br>
using other than transform coded excitation. The module according to<br>
the present invention is primarily characterised in that the module<br>
further comprises a parameter analysis block for analysing said LTP<br>
parameters,, and an excitation selection block for selecting one<br>
excitation block among a first excitation block and a second excitation<br>
block, and for indicating the selected excitation method to an encoder,<br>
and that said second excitation is a transform coded excitation, and<br>
said first excitation is other than transform coded excitation. The<br>
computer program product according to the present invention is<br>
primarily characterised in that the computer program product further<br>
comprises machine executable steps for analysing said LTP<br>
parameters, and selecting one excitation among at least said first<br>
excitation and said second excitation for performing the excitation for<br>
the frames of the audio signal on the basis of the parameter analysis,<br>
and that performing said second excitation comprises machine<br>
executable steps for using a transform coded excitation, and<br>
performing said first excitation comprises machine executable steps for<br>
using other than transform coded excitation.<br>
The present invention provides advantages when compared with prior<br>
art methods and systems. By using the classification method according<br>
to the present invention it is possible to improve reproduced sound<br>
quality without greatly affecting the compression efficiency. The<br>
invention improves especially reproduced sound quality of mixed<br>
signals, i.e. signals including both speech like and non-speech like<br>
signals.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In the following an encoder 200 according to an example embodiment<br>
of the present invention will be described in more detail with reference<br>
to Fig. 2. The encoder 200 comprises an input block 201 for digitizing,<br>
filtering and framing the input signal when necessary. It should be<br>
noted here that the input signal may already be in a form suitable for<br>
the encoding process. For example, the input signa! may have been<br>
digitised at an earlier stage and stored to a memory medium (not<br>
shown). The input signal frames are input to a LPC analysis block 208<br>
which performs LPC analysis to the input signal and forms LPC<br>
parameters on the basis of the properties of the signal. A LTP analysis<br>
block 209 forms LTP parameters on the basis of the LPC parameters.<br>
The LPC parameters and LTP parameters are examined in a<br>
parameter analysis block 202. On the basis of the result of the analysis<br>
an excitation selection block 203 determines which excitation method is<br>
the most appropriate one for encoding the current frame of the input<br>
signal. The excitation selection block 203 produces a control signa! 204<br>
for controlling a selection means 205 according to the parameter<br>
analysis. If it was determined that the best excitation method for<br>
encoding the current frame of the input signal is a first excitation<br>
method, the selection means 205 are controlled to select the signal<br>
(excitation parameters) of a first excitation block 206 to be input to a<br>
quantisation and encoding block 212. If it was determined that the best<br>
excitation method for encoding the current frame of the input signal is a<br>
second excitation method, the selection means 205 are controlled to<br>
select the signal (excitation parameters) of a second excitation block<br>
207 to be input to the quantisation and encoding block 212. Although<br>
the encoder of Fig. 2 has only the first 206 and the second excitation<br>
block 207 for the encoding process, it is obvious that there can also be<br>
more than two different excitation blocks for different excitation<br>
methods available in the encoder 200 to be used in the encoding of the<br>
input signal.<br>
The first excitation block 205 produces, for example, a TCX excitation<br>
signal (vector) and the second excitation block 207 produces, for<br>
example, a ACELP excitation signal (vector). It is also possible that the<br>
selected excitation block 206, 207 first try two or more excitation<br>
vectors wherein the vector which produces the most compact result is<br>
selected for transmission. The determination of the most compact<br>
result may be made, for example, on the basis of the number of bits to<br>
be transmitted or the coding error (the difference between the<br>
synthesised audio and the real audio input).<br>
LPC parameters 210, LTP parameters 211 and excitation parameters<br>
213 are, for example, quantised and encoded in the quantisation and<br>
encoding block 212 before transmission e.g. to a communication<br>
network 604 (Fig. 6). However, it is not necessary to transmit the<br>
parameters but they can, for.example, be stored on a storage medium<br>
and at a later stage retrieved for transmission and/or decoding.<br>
In an extended AMR-WB (AMR-WB+) codec, there are two types of<br>
excitation for LP-synthesis: ACELP pulse-like excitation and transform<br>
coded TCX-excitation. ACELP excitation is the same than used already<br>
in the original 3GPP AMR-WB standard (3GPP TS 26.190) and TCXexcitation<br>
is the essential improvement implemented in the extended<br>
AMR-WB.<br>
In AMR-WB+ codec, linear prediction coding (LPC) is calculated in<br>
each frame to model the spectral envelope. The LPC excitation (the<br>
output of the LP filter of the coded) is either coded by algebraic code<br>
excitation linear prediction (ACELP) type or transform coding based<br>
algorithm (TCX). As an example, ACELP performs LTP and fixed<br>
codebook parameters for LPC excitation. For example, the transform<br>
coding (TCX) of AMR-WB+ exploits FFT (Fast Fourier transform). In<br>
AMR-WB+ codec the TCX coding can be done by using one of three<br>
different frame lengths (20, 40 and 80 ms).<br>
In the following an example of a method according to the present<br>
invention will be described in more detail. In the method an algorithm is<br>
used to determine some properties of the audio signal such as<br>
periodicity and pitch. Pitch is a fundamental property of voiced speech.<br>
For voiced speech, the glottis opens and closes in a periodic fashion,<br>
imparting periodic character to the excitation. Pitch period, TO, is the<br>
time span between sequential openings of glottis. Voiced speech<br>
segments have especially strong long-term correlation. This correlation<br>
is due to the vibrations of the vocal cords, which usually have a pitch<br>
period in the range from 2 to 20 ms.<br>
LTP parameters lag and gain are calculated for the LPC residual. The<br>
LTP lag is closely related to the fundamental frequency of the speech<br>
signal and it is often referred to as a "pitch-lag" parameter, "pitch delay"<br>
parameter or "lag", which describes the periodicity of the speech signal<br>
in terms of speech samples. The pitch-delay parameter can be<br>
calculated by using an adaptive codebook. Open-loop pitch analysis<br>
can be done to estimate the pitch lag. This is done in order to simplify<br>
the pitch analysis and confine the closed loop pitch search to a small<br>
number of lags around the open-loop estimated Jags. Another LTP<br>
parameter related to the fundamental frequency is the gain, also called<br>
LTP gain. The LTP gain is an important parameter together with LTP<br>
lag which are used to give a natural representation of the speech.<br>
Stationary properties of the source signal is analysed by e.g.<br>
normalised correlation, which can be calculated as follows:<br>
NormCorr <br>
where TO is the open-loop lag of the frame having a length N. Xj is the<br>
ith sample of the encoded frame. XrTO is the sample from recently<br>
encoded frame, which is TO samples back in the past from the sample<br>
A few examples of LTP parameter characteristics as a function of time<br>
can be seen in Figures 3, 4 and 5. In the figures the curve A shows a<br>
normalised correlation of the signal, the curve B shows the lag and the<br>
curve C shows the scaled gain. The normalised correlation and the<br>
LTP gain are scaled (multiplied by 100) so that they can fit in the same<br>
figure with the LTP lag. In Figures 3, 4 and 5, also LTP lag values are<br>
divided by 2. As an example, a voiced speech segment (Figure 3)<br>
includes high LTP gain and stable LTP lag. Also normalised correlation<br>
and LTP gain of the voiced speech segments are matching and<br>
therefore having high correlation. The method according to the<br>
invention classify this kind of signal segment so that the selected<br>
coding method is the ACELP (the first coding method). If LTP lag<br>
contour (composed by current and previous lags) is stable, but the LTP<br>
gain is low or unstable and/or the LTP gain and the normalised<br>
correlation have a small correlation, the selected coding method is the<br>
TCX (the second coding method). This kind of situation is illustrated in<br>
the example of Fig. 4 in which parameters of an audio signal of one<br>
instrument (saxophone) are shown. If the LTP lag contour of current<br>
and previous frames is very unstable, the selected coding method is<br>
also in this case the TCX. This is illustrated in the example of Fig. 5 in<br>
which parameters of an audio signal of a multiplicity of instruments are<br>
shown. The word stable means here that e.g. the difference between<br>
minimum and maximum lag values of current and previous frames is<br>
below some predetermined threshold (a second threshold TH2).<br>
Therefore, the lag is not changing much in current and previous<br>
frames. In AMR-WB+ codec, the range of LTP gain is between 0 and<br>
1.2. The range of the normalised correlation is between 0 and 1.0. As<br>
an example, the threshold indicating high LTP gain could be over 0.8.<br>
High correlation (or similarity) of the LTP gain and normalised<br>
correlation can be observed e.g. by their difference. If the difference is<br>
below a third threshold TH3, for example, 0.1 in current and/or past<br>
frames, LTP gain and normalised correlation have a high correlation.<br>
If the signal is transient in nature, it is coded by a first coding method,<br>
for example, by the ACELP coding method, in an example embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Transient sequences can be detected by<br>
using spectral distance SD of adjacent frames. For example, if spectral<br>
distance, SDn, of the frame n calculated from immittance spectrum pair<br>
(ISP) coefficients (LP filter coefficients converted to the ISP<br>
representation) in current and previous frame exceeds a predetermined<br>
first threshold TH1, the signal is classified as transient. Spectral<br>
distance SDn can be calculated from ISP parameters as follows:<br>
where ISPn is the ISP coefficients vector of the frame n and ISPn(i) is<br>
the ith element of it.<br>
15<br>
Noise like sequences are coded by a second coding method, for<br>
example, by transform coding TCX. These sequences can be detected<br>
by LTP parameters and average frequency along the frame in<br>
frequency domain. If the LTP parameters are very unstable and/or<br>
average frequency exceeds a predetermined threshold TH16, it is<br>
determined in the method that the frame contains noise like signal.<br>
An example algorithm for the classifying process according to the<br>
present invention is described below. The algorithm can be used in the<br>
encoder 200 such as an encoder of the AMR WB+ codec.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The algorithm above contains some thresholds TH1—TH15 and<br>
constants HIGHJJMIT, LOWJJMIT, Buflimit, NO_of_elements. In the<br>
following some example values for the thresholds and constants are<br>
shown but it is obvious that the values are non-limiting examples only.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The meaning of the variables of the algorithm are as follows:<br>
HIGHJJMIT and LOW_LIMIT relate to the maximum and minimum<br>
LTP lag values, respectively, LagDifbui is the buffer containing LTP lags<br>
from current and previous frames. Lagn is one or more LTP lag values<br>
of the current frame (two open loop lag values are calculated in a frame<br>
in AMR WB+ codec). Gainn is one or more LTP gain values of the<br>
current frame. NormCorrn is one or more normalised correlation values<br>
of the current frame. MaxEnergybu{ is the maximum value of the buffer<br>
containing energy values of current and previous frames. lphn indicates<br>
the spectral tilt. vadFlag0|d is the VAD flag of the previous frame and<br>
vadFlag is the VAD flag of the current frame. NoMtcx is the flag<br>
indicating to avoid TCX transformation with long frame length (e.g.<br>
80ms), if the second coding model TCX is selected. Mag is a discrete<br>
Fourier transformed (DFT) spectral envelope created from LP filter<br>
coefficients, Ap, of the current frame which can be calculated according<br>
to the following program code:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where DFTN = 62, N_MAX = 11 52, LPC_N = 16. The vectors cos and<br>
sin contain the values of cosine and sinusoidal functions respectively.<br>
The length of vectors cos and sin is 1 152. DFTSum is the sum of first<br>
NO_of_elements (e.g. 40) elements of the vector mag, excluding the<br>
very first element (mag(O)) of the vector mag.<br>
In the description above, AMR-WB extension (AMR-WB+) was used as<br>
a practical example of an encoder. However, the invention is not limited<br>
to AMR-WB codecs or ACELP- and TCX- excitation methods.<br>
Although the invention was presented above by using two different<br>
excitation methods it is possible to use more than two different<br>
excitation methods and make the selection among them for<br>
compressing audio signals.<br>
Figure 6 depicts an example of a system in which the present invention<br>
can be applied. The system comprises one or more audio sources 601<br>
producing speech and/or non-speech audio signals. The audio signals<br>
are converted into digital signals by an A/D-converter 602 when<br>
necessary. The digitised signals are input to an encoder 200 of a<br>
transmitting device 600 in which the compression is performed<br>
according to the present invention. The compressed signals are also<br>
quantised and encoded for transmission in the encoder 200 when<br>
necessary. A transmitter 603, for example a transmitter of a mobile<br>
communications device 600, transmits the compressed and encoded<br>
signals to a communication network 604. The signals are received from<br>
the communication network 604 by a receiver 605 of a receiving device<br>
606. The received signals are transferred from the receiver 605 to a<br>
decoder 607 for decoding, dequantisation and decompression. The<br>
decoder 607 comprises detection means 608 to determine the<br>
compression method used in the encoder 200 for a current frame. The<br>
decoder 607 selects on the basis of the determination a first<br>
decompression means 609 or a second decompression means 610 for<br>
decompressing the current frame. The decompressed signals are<br>
connected from the decompression means 609, 610 to a filter 611 and<br>
a D/A converter 612 for converting the digital signal into analog signal.<br>
The analog signal can then be transformed to audio, for example, in a<br>
loudspeaker 613.<br>
The present invention can be implemented in different kind of systems,<br>
especially in low-rate transmission for achieving more efficient<br>
compression and/or improved audio quality for the reproduced<br>
(decompressed/decoded) audio signal than in prior art systems<br>
especially in situations in which the audio signal includes both speech<br>
like signals and non-speech like signals (e.g. mixed speech and<br>
music). The encoder 200 according to the present invention can be<br>
implemented in different parts of communication systems. For<br>
example, the encoder 200 can be implemented in a mobile<br>
communication device having limited processing capabilities.<br>
The invention can also be implemented as a module 202, 203 which<br>
can be connected with an encoder to analyse the parameters and to<br>
control the selection of the excitation method for the encoder 200.<br>
It is obvious that the present invention is not solely limited to the above<br>
described embodiments but it can be modified within the scope of the<br>
