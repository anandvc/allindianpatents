				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to the use of cross-linked rubber mass as a<br>
one-sided or two-sided adhesive coating on a strip-shaped support<br>
in the course of the production of a self-adhesive strip for<br>
bundling cables in motor vehicles.<br>
In usual parlance, a self-adhesive strip refers to an adhesive<br>
strip that is equipped with an adhesive coating on one or both<br>
sides. Such an adhesive is characterized by a permanently sticky<br>
film layer. This permanently sticky film layer forms after<br>
evaporation of a liquid phase of a solution or dispersion, or<br>
after cooling of a melt. In the first case mentioned, the<br>
adhesive, i.e. the adhesive mass is applied to the strip-shaped<br>
support as a solution or dispersion, respectively, and leaves the<br>
film described, after evaporation of the solvent. The same holds<br>
true for the case that the adhesive, i.e. the adhesive mass, is<br>
heated for application to the strip-shaped support, in order to<br>
reduce its viscosity, and then forms the sticky film after<br>
cooling.<br>
A self-adhesive strip is described in EP 0 937 761 B1, which is<br>
suitable for sheathing cables in automobiles. Here, an adhesive<br><br>
mass on the basis of acrylic hot melt is used, which can be cross-<br>
linked by means of radiation chemistry.<br>
In addition, it has become known by means of U.S. patent 5,681,654<br>
to apply a rubber mass onto a strip-shaped support, as an adhesive<br>
coating, in the course of the production of a self-adhesive strip.<br>
It remains open whether and how cross-linking is carried out, in<br>
detail.<br>
Adhesive masses on the basis of acrylate hot melt are preferably<br>
used for the production of self-adhesive strips for sheathing<br>
cables in automobiles, i.e. motor vehicles, because they have good<br>
aging resistance and temperature stability. Temperatures of up to<br>
125Â°C and more can easily occur in the automotive applications<br>
described, and these cannot be mastered by adhesive masses on a<br>
rubber basis without significant technical and economic<br>
expenditure. This is attributable to the fact that rubbers<br>
demonstrate viscous flow behavior at higher temperatures and/or<br>
under the influence of deforming forces. On the other hand,<br>
rubber masses are convincing because of the possibility of cost-<br>
advantageous production.<br>
At the same time, rubber-based adhesive masses develop a high<br>
immediate adhesion, as compared with acrylic-based adhesives, and<br><br>
are convincing because of their maximal adhesion forces. As a<br>
result, reliable processing particularly in the area of use of<br>
cable set bundling in motor vehicles is predestined.<br>
The prior art according to DE 198 46 901 A1, which essentially<br>
forms the type of the state of the art, deals with a method for<br>
the production of adhesive strips, whereby adhesive strips coated<br>
with an adhesive mass on one side are subjected to cross-linking<br>
by means of radiation chemistry. Adhesive masses that are<br>
mentioned are, among others, natural rubber systems. In total,<br>
the irradiation of the adhesive strip is supposed to take place<br>
through the support material of the adhesive strip, onto the<br>
adhesive mass, in such a manner that the support material and the<br>
adhesive mass that faces the support material receive a dose of 30<br>
to 200 kGy. The known method of procedure utilizes so-called<br>
electron beam cross-linking. In this connection, no chemical<br>
cross-linking agents are added. Because of the high-energy<br>
electron radiation, this cross-linking method sets special<br>
requirements with regard to work protection, and is consequently<br>
quite cost-intensive, as far as the systems, etc. that are<br>
required are concerned.<br>
In total, what is supposed to be achieved by means of the high<br>
radiation dose described in DE 198 46 901 A1 is intensive cross-<br><br>
linking of the adhesive mass layer on the side facing the support,<br>
and what is supposed to be prevented is that adhesive mass<br>
components can migrate onto the open support side. Because of the<br>
cost-intensive electron beam source and in view of the enormous<br>
cost pressure in the production of such self-adhesive strips, such<br>
electron beam sources are unsuitable for use in the automotive<br>
industry, for practical purposes.<br>
The invention is based on the technical problem of indicating a<br>
self-adhesive strip that can be produced in cost-advantageous<br>
manner and is particularly suitable for the purpose of use in<br>
automobile production.<br>
To solve this technical problem, the object of the invention is<br>
the use of cross-linked rubber mass as a one-sided or two-sided<br>
adhesive coating on a strip-shaped support in the course of the<br>
production of a self-adhesive strip for bundling cables in motor<br>
vehicles, whereby a cross-linking agent is added to the rubber<br>
mass as a photoinitiator.<br>
The term rubber, i.e. rubber mass used according to the invention<br>
refers to polymers having rubber-elastic properties at room<br>
temperatures, which are as usual not cross-linked, but can be<br>
cross-linked. Within the scope of the invention, a specially<br><br>
cross-linked rubber mass, i.e. rubber adhesive mass is now used on<br>
the strip-shaped support, as an adhesive coating.<br>
In this connection, it is advantageous to use a thermoplastic<br>
rubber on the basis of a styrene block copolymer as the rubber<br>
mass. Adhesive masses on a rubber basis, whose formulation is<br>
based on a styrene block copolymer such as that distributed by the<br>
Shell company under the trade name Kraton D-KX 222C should be<br>
mentioned as being very particularly preferred.<br>
By means of combining the block copolymer described, i.e. the<br>
rubber mass in general, with resins, tackifiers that make the mass<br>
sticky, and one or more system-suitable photoinitiators, an<br>
adhesive appropriate for the use can be produced, which can be<br>
cross-linked by means of radiation, in advantageous manner,<br>
specifically with UV rays.<br>
The thermoplastic rubber mass used according to the invention,<br>
preferably on the basis of the styrene block copolymer, can be<br>
variably adjusted in terms of its adhesion properties, depending<br>
on the photoinitiator used and as a function of the concentration<br>
of the latter in the rubber mass in question, in order to support<br>
the radiation cross-linking. After all, depending on the degree<br>
of cross-linking, an improvement in the adhesion properties can be<br><br>
achieved in the case of such rubbers. Usually, the photoinitiator<br>
added to the rubber mass as a cross-linking agent assures that a<br>
plurality of photochemical transformations occurs in the rubber<br>
mass (under irradiation with UV light). Thus, the photoinitiator<br>
can form reactive fragments of free radicals, for example, which<br>
promote the cross-linking of the rubber mass, i.e. its<br>
polymerization. In this connection, a greater concentration of<br>
the photoinitiator(s) naturally increases the cross-linking<br>
density in the rubber mass.<br>
It has generally proven itself if the photoinitiator or the<br>
several photoinitiators in the rubber mass are present at more<br>
than one wt.-%, whereby a preferred composition contains 2 to 20<br>
wt.-% of the photoinitiator, with reference to the rubber mass. A<br>
composition in which 2 to 15 wt.-%, particularly 2 to 7 wt.-% of<br>
the photoinitiator are present in the rubber mass is very<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
Suitable photoinitiators are those on the basis of benzophenones<br>
as well as an amine, if applicable, i.e. those that are described<br>
as examples in DE 699 16 245 T2 (cf. paragraph [0024] there). - At<br>
this point, photoinitiators from the Ciba company, which are<br>
distributed under the trade name IRGACURE, have proven themselves<br><br>
to be particularly advantageous. These are highly reactive benzyl<br>
dimethyl ketals.<br>
Furthermore, it is recommended to work with photoinitiators that<br>
do not react to sunlight and not to the spectrum of fluorescent<br>
lamps. This is because uncontrolled subsequent cross-linking can<br>
occur due to both radiation sources. Therefore, it is<br>
advantageous to use photoinitiators that are sensitive at<br>
wavelengths 
primarily used for cross-linking, and here, so-called mercury<br>
radiators are mainly used, which emit radiation in the wavelength<br>
range of 250 nm to 400 nm, which is important for the cross-<br>
linking reaction, with particular intensity.<br>
When this UV light impacts the rubber mass to be cross-linked,<br>
with the photoinitiator that has been introduced into it, the<br>
photoinitiators already discussed above are split up by means of<br>
the UV light, and then start the polymerization and, as a<br>
consequence of this, the desired cross-linking, which raises the<br>
plastification point and melting point of the rubber mass. For<br>
this reason, one also speaks of cross-linking the rubber mass by<br>
means of radiation chemistry. - The thermoplastic rubber mass used<br>
according to the invention, for example on the basis of the<br><br>
styrene block copolymer, can always be variably adjusted in terms<br>
of its adhesion properties, depending on the photoinitiator used<br>
and its weight proportion in the rubber mass, to support radiation<br>
cross-linking.<br>
This is only possible to a slight extent in the case of cross-<br>
linking acrylate adhesives. This is because influencing the<br>
degree of cross-linking is accompanied by an increased molecular<br>
weight and only succeeds to a slight degree. In fact, the<br>
photoinitiator mentioned is chemically bound in the polymer in the<br>
case of such acrylate melt adhesives, and therefore cannot be<br>
varied by type and concentration, and consequently adapted to the<br>
application case in question. As a result, the adhesion<br>
properties are more or less fixed (cf. EP 0 937 761 B1).<br>
In contrast, the cross-linked, i.e. radiation cross-linked rubber<br>
adhesive mass used according to the invention can be adjusted in a<br>
wide range, with regard to its degree of cross-linking, by means<br>
of the use of variable and consequently different photoinitiators,<br>
with regard to the adhesion properties, and therefore can be<br>
optimally adapted to the substrate to be processed (the cables to<br>
be bundled). This is particularly true in view of the background<br>
that the addition to photoinitiators can be varied within the<br>
framework of the indicated weight proportions, in terms of weight,<br><br>
in comparison with the rubber adhesive mass, and that a. cross-<br>
linking density that is also variable corresponds to this. In<br>
addition, there is a high immediate adhesion according to the<br>
invention, and consequently a greater working reliability, which<br>
cannot be provided by the acrylate adhesives according to the<br>
state of the art, according to EP 0 937 761 B1.<br>
For processing of the claimed rubber mass, i.e. rubber adhesive<br>
mass, the latter can be applied to the strip-shaped support as a<br>
so-called hot melt, i.e. adhesive melt, in the low-viscosity<br>
state. Subsequently, cross-linking of the rubber mass according<br>
to radiation chemistry, by means of ultraviolet irradiation, takes<br>
place. Processing of the rubber mass as a polymer dispersion from<br>
an aqueous or solvent phase, with subsequent drying process and<br>
after that, cross-linking, i.e. radiation cross-linking, is<br>
possible just as well, and is covered.<br>
By means of the use of the cross-linked, i.e. radiation cross-<br>
linked rubber mass in place of the acrylate-based adhesive in EP 0<br>
937 761 Bl, a clear cost advantage is already achieved, because<br>
the rubber masses in question are available in large amounts and<br>
at low prices. At the same time, the temperature stability is<br>
increased by means of radiation cross-linking of the rubber mass.<br>
Here, the invention recommends cross-linking the rubber mass using<br><br>
the general electromagnetic radiation already mentioned,<br>
particularly UV radiation. This can be carried out<br>
supplementally, in the course of the radiation chemistry process<br>
described.<br>
It has proven to be advantageous if the rubber mass is applied to<br>
the support in the low-viscosity state, as a hot melt, i.e. a<br>
polymer melt, and subsequently subjected to (radiation chemistry)<br>
cross-linking. After all, in this way it is possible to do<br>
without additional solvents and to simplify handling overall. The<br>
absence of a related dilution/transport medium therefore results<br>
in particular economic and ecological advantages, although<br>
application as a dispersion is fundamentally also possible and is<br>
covered, as was already described.<br>
In all cases, the radiation cross-linking described leads to<br>
chemical cross-linking in the molecular structure of the polymer<br>
used, and therefore to an increase in molecular weight. This is<br>
accompanied by a great increase in cohesion of the adhesive, even<br>
at temperatures above 125Â°C, actually even at temperatures above<br>
160Â°C. Consequently, the increased adhesion capacity at these<br>
temperatures can be explained as the result of the increased<br>
cross-linking.<br><br>
Furthermore, the cross-linked rubber mass used according to the<br>
invention essentially no longer possesses a plastification point,<br>
because of the cross-linking procedure described. The viscous<br>
flow behavior at higher temperatures, which was described<br>
initially and is possibly disadvantageous for uses in the<br>
automotive sector, is therefore no longer present, so that the use<br>
of the rubber mass in question for the purpose indicated can be<br>
explained. Furthermore, the radiation chemistry cross-linking<br>
results in significantly better stability of the rubber adhesive<br>
mass with regard to aggressive media such as engine oil, gasoline,<br>
and the like, so that in this way, it is once again particularly<br>
suitable for the claimed use.<br>
In addition, it has turned out that soft PVC vehicle cable<br>
sheathings or general sheathings with a high content of monomer<br>
plasticizers (e.g. DOP) can be used in the motor vehicle sector,<br>
in the case of vehicle cable sets. These monomer plasticizers<br>
demonstrate a marked tendency to migrate into the adhesives of the<br>
adhesive strips used for bundling the vehicle cable sets or<br>
cables, and to soften them. As a consequence of this, the<br>
adhesives lose their cohesion, become capable of flow, and<br>
experience an impairment of their adhesion properties.<br><br>
Also taking these premises into consideration, the cross-linked<br>
rubber masses used according to the invention demonstrate clear<br>
advantages. This is because the polymer network that is present<br>
after chemical cross-linking, into which the mixed-in resins and<br>
tackifiers have partially been integrated, clearly reduces the<br>
plastification process described, so that the cables to be bundled<br>
are perfectly held together even many years later. - Natural<br>
resins and/or aromatic as well as aliphatic hydrocarbon resins can<br>
be used, as examples and without restriction.<br>
In addition, in contrast to the UV cross-linked acrylate melt<br>
adhesives described in EP 0 937 761 B1, there is the fact that<br>
radiation chemistry cross-linking of rubber adhesive masses is<br>
significantly more reliable in terms of process. This can be<br>
attributed to the fact that any variations in the radiation energy<br>
during cross-linking have significantly less of an influence on<br>
the adhesive values achieved and the thermal stability of the<br>
rubber mass cross-linked in this manner than is the case for<br>
cross-linked acrylate melt adhesives. Furthermore, the structure<br>
of the cross-linked rubber masses, which is non-polar as compared<br>
with acrylate adhesives, also assures reliable adhesion on non-<br>
polar cable sheathings, therefore it is particularly suitable for<br>
general use.<br><br>
Comparatively high adhesion values are achieved, in particular, on<br>
the vehicle cables with non-polar radiation cross-linked<br>
polyethylene sheathings and polypropylene sheathings, i.e. general<br>
polyolefin sheathings, which are increasingly in use in the<br>
automotive industry, because of this circumstance. Loosening of<br>
the adhesive strips according to the invention is not to be<br>
expected, even after many years of use. Because of this, the<br>
self-adhesive strips described are predestined for use in the<br>
bundling of cables having a soft PVC sheathing and/or a cross-<br>
linked polyolefin sheathing.<br>
As a support for the production of the self-adhesive strip, the<br>
invention recommends recourse to a woven, non-woven, film, paper,<br>
or felt support, whereby of course, combinations of the stated<br>
materials can also function as a support material. For example, a<br>
combined woven/non-woven support is possible, as is a paper/film<br>
support. Furthermore, processing of the support at least on the<br>
side on which the rubber mass will subsequently be applied as a<br>
hot melt, i.e. polymer melt, is possible. Thus, the support strip<br>
side in question can be ground smooth or chintzed, in order to<br>
make as sealed a surface as possible available, so that the<br>
adhesive, i.e. the rubber mass, which has been converted to the<br>
low-viscosity state, cannot penetrate into the support, and the<br><br>
consumption of adhesive is low. Such a chintzed support and its<br>
production are described, for example, in WO 03/033 611 A1.<br>
Furthermore, the self-adhesive strip can be structured to be<br>
flame-inhibiting, in that flame-inhibiting additives are<br>
introduced into the rubber mass and/or into the support. As a<br>
result, the use of the self-adhesive strip described for<br>
automotive applications is improved even more.<br>
Finally, the self-adhesive strip described is characterized in<br>
that it is structured to be resistant to fogging, in total. It is<br>
known that fogging describes the condensation of volatile<br>
components from the self-adhesive strip, which result in<br>
undesirable deposits on windows, particularly the windshield, in<br>
the vehicle interior, for example. In order to preclude<br>
disadvantageous lighting conditions that result from this, the<br>
self-adhesive strip described is structured to be resistant to<br>
fogging, and structured with a fogging value of 

total.<br>
Within the framework of this standard PV 3015, issued by VW AG,<br>
which corresponds to the DIN standard 75201 B, the self-adhesive<br>
strip described is placed into a beaker or comparable container,<br><br>
whereby the beaker edge is covered with an aluminum foil disk.<br>
The beaker is now placed in a heated bath at a temperature of<br>
100 Â± 0.5Â°C for a period of 16 hours Â± 10 min.<br>
Before that, the aluminum foil disk applied to the beaker edge is<br>
weighed. The same thing takes place after fogging of this<br>
aluminum foil disk, at the end of the test period of 16 hours Â± 10<br>
min, resulting in a second weight for the aluminum foil disk,<br>
which has now been fogged. In this connection, the fogging is<br>
explained by residues that leave the adhesive strip at the<br>
temperatures indicated, and should be. as low as possible in order<br>
to achieve the resistance to fogging as described.<br>
According to the invention, the difference between the two weights<br>
is less than 5 mg, preferably less than 2 mg, and consequently<br>
reproduces the amount of condensate that has deposited on the<br>
aluminum foil disk.<br>
Other testing methods for determining the fogging value are also<br>
fundamentally possible. These are based, for example, on the<br>
"Ford Laboratory Test Method" described by the Ford company, which<br>
methods are described in detail in the U.S. patent 5,681,654 as<br>
well as EP 0 937 761 B1. In both cases, in the final analysis the<br><br>
light permeability of a sheet of glass and its change caused by<br>
the condensate that has deposited are determined.<br><br>
