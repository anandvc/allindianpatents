CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 61/043,209, filed on April 9, 2008. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to vehicle altitude sensors and<br>
corresponding control systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] As altitude of a vehicle increases, air pressure experienced by<br>
the vehicle decreases, which affects the engine performance of the vehicle.<br>
Engine operating parameters, such as air intake and fuel supply, may be<br>
modified based on the altitude to improve engine performance.<br>
[0005] A vehicle may include an altitude or barometric pressure sensor<br>
to detect a current altitude. Over time the altitude sensor and/or corresponding<br>
circuitry may degrade and provide an inaccurate indication of altitude. This can<br><br>
negatively affect engine operation and can also negatively affect operation of an<br>
automatic transmission<br>
[0006] An automatic transmission of the vehicle may operate based on<br>
information received from the engine and/or an engine control system. For<br>
example, the transmission may determine an appropriate gear ratio and/or a rate<br>
of transitioning between gear ratios based on an estimated power output signal<br>
from the engine control system. When an inaccurate altitude signal is generated,<br>
the estimated power output signal may also be inaccurate, resulting in improper<br>
transmission operation.<br>
[0007] The inclusion of an altitude sensor on a vehicle also increases<br>
vehicle hardware, which increases vehicle costs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] In one embodiment, a control system of a vehicle is provided<br>
and includes a pressure sensor that detects hydraulic fluid pressure and that<br>
generates a pressure signal based on a pressure in a transmission of the vehicle.<br>
A control module determines atmospheric pressure based on the pressure<br>
signal. The control module controls operation of at least one of the transmission<br>
and an engine of the vehicle by generating a control signal based on the<br>
atmospheric pressure.<br>
[0009] In another embodiment, a control system of a vehicle is<br>
provided and includes an elevation estimation module that receives pressure<br><br>
signals from a transmission via a pressure sensor that detects hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure and that generates an estimated elevation signal. A control module<br>
generates a control signal based on the estimated elevation signal and a sensor<br>
signal received from a non-transmission elevation sensor.<br>
[0010] In a further embodiment, a method of operating a control system<br>
of a vehicle includes generating a pressure signal based on a pressure in a<br>
transmission of the vehicle via a pressure sensor that detects hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure. Atmospheric pressure is determined based on the pressure signal. A<br>
sensor signal is generated from a non-transmission elevation sensor. Elevation<br>
of the vehicle is determined based on the atmospheric pressure and said sensor<br>
signal. A control signal is generated to adjust operation of at least one of the<br>
transmission and an engine of the vehicle based on the elevation.<br>
[0011] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br><br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0020] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0021] In addition, although the following embodiments are described<br>
primarily with respect to an internal combustion engine, the embodiments of the<br>
present disclosure may apply to other internal combustion engines. For<br>
example, the present invention may apply to compression ignition, spark ignition,<br>
homogenous spark ignition, homogeneous charge compression ignition, stratified<br>
spark ignition, and spark assisted compression ignition engines.<br>
[0022] Also, in the following description the term "non-transmission<br>
elevation sensor" refers to a sensor that provides an indication of vehicle<br>
elevation and is located external to a transmission. The indication may be a<br>
direct or indirect measure of vehicle elevation. For example, a non-transmission<br>
elevation sensor may include an altitude pressure sensor, which may provide a<br>
direct indication of vehicle elevation. As another example, a non-transmission<br>
elevation sensor may include, as a couple of examples, a barometric pressure<br>
sensor or a mass air flow (MAF) sensor that indirectly indicates elevation based<br><br>
on air pressure. The barometric pressure sensor indicates atmospheric pressure<br>
and the MAF sensor indicates air pressure entering an intake of an engine. The<br>
measure of air flow into an engine may be used to indirectly measure<br>
atmospheric pressure and thus vehicle elevation. A non-transmission elevation<br>
sensor may include a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor, an airflow<br>
sensor, a barometric pressure sensor, etc.<br>
[0023] Referring now to FIG. 1, a vehicle control system 10 is shown.<br>
The vehicle control system 10 is on a vehicle 12 and includes and controls<br>
operation of an engine 14, a transmission 16 and an exhaust system 18. The<br>
engine 14 may include a fuel injection system 20, an air intake (injection) system<br>
22, and an ignition system 24. The transmission 16 includes one or more<br>
pressure sensors 26, which are used to control operation of the engine 14 and<br>
the transmission 16. The pressure sensors 26 are sensitive to barometric<br>
pressure and altitude. The pressure sensors 26 are used to indicate pressures<br>
within the transmission 16 for gear ratio selection, gear ratio transitioning, etc.<br>
The pressure sensors 26 are also use to indicate elevation, which may include<br>
altitude, of the vehicle 12 during certain operating conditions.<br>
[0024] The engine 14 includes an intake manifold 30 and combusts an<br>
air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. The engine 14, as shown, includes<br>
four cylinders 32 in an in-line configuration. Although FIG. 1 depicts four<br>
cylinders (N = 4), it can be appreciated that the engine 14 may include additional<br>
or fewer cylinders. Each of the cylinders 32 may have one or more<br><br>
corresponding intake valves, exhaust valves, and pistons that ride on a<br>
crankshaft 34.<br>
[0025] An output of the engine 14 is coupled by a torque converter 40,<br>
the transmission 16, a driveshaft 44 and a differential 46 to driven wheels 48.<br>
The transmission 16 may, for example, be a continuously variable transmission<br>
(CVT) or a step-gear automatic transmission. The transmission 16 is controlled<br>
by a main control module 50.<br>
[0026] Air is drawn into the intake manifold 30 via the electronic throttle<br>
controller (ETC) 60, or a cable-driven throttle, which adjusts a throttle plate 62<br>
that is located adjacent to an inlet of an intake manifold 30. The adjustment may<br>
be based upon a position of an accelerator pedal 64 and a throttle control<br>
algorithm that is executed by the control module 50. The throttle 62 adjusts<br>
airflow and intake manifold pressure that affects output torque that drives the<br>
wheels 48. An accelerator pedal sensor 66 generates a pedal position signal<br>
that is output to the control module 50 based on a position of the accelerator<br>
pedal 64. A position of a brake pedal 70 is sensed by a brake pedal sensor or<br>
switch 72, which generates a brake pedal position signal that is output to the<br>
control module 50.<br>
[0027] Air is drawn into the cylinders 32 from the intake manifold 30<br>
and is compressed therein. Fuel is injected into cylinders 32 by a fuel injection<br>
circuit 80 and the spark generated by the ignition system 24 ignites the air/fuel<br>
mixtures in the cylinders 32. Exhaust gases are exhausted from the cylinders 32<br><br>
into the exhaust system 18. In some instances, the engine system 50 can<br>
include a turbocharger that uses an exhaust driven turbine to drive a compressor<br>
that compresses the air entering the intake manifold 30. The compressed air<br>
may pass through an air cooler before entering into the intake manifold 30.<br>
[0028] The fuel injection system includes a fuel injection circuit 80,<br>
which may include fuel injectors that are associated with each of the cylinders 32.<br>
A fuel rail provides fuel to each of the fuel injectors after reception from, for<br>
example, a fuel pump or reservoir. The control module 50 controls operation of<br>
the fuel injectors including the number and timing of fuel injections into each of<br>
the cylinders 32 and per combustion cycle thereof. The fuel injection timing may<br>
be relative to crankshaft positioning.<br>
[0029] The ignition system 24 includes an ignition circuit 82, which may<br>
include spark plugs or other ignition devices for ignition of the air/fuel mixtures in<br>
each of the cylinders 32. The ignition system 24 also may include the control<br>
module 50. The control module 50 may, for example, control spark timing<br>
relative to crankshaft positioning.<br>
[0030] The exhaust system 18 may include exhaust manifolds and/or<br>
exhaust conduits, such as conduit 90 and a filter system 92. The exhaust<br>
manifolds and conduits direct the exhaust exiting the cylinders 32 into filter<br>
system 92. Optionally, an EGR valve re-circulates a portion of the exhaust back<br>
into the intake manifold 32. A portion of the exhaust may be directed into a<br>
turbocharger to drive a turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of the<br><br>
fresh air received from the intake manifold 32. A combined exhaust stream flows<br>
from the turbocharger through the filter system 92.<br>
[0031] The filter system 92 may include a catalytic converter or an<br>
oxidation catalyst (OC) 94 and a heating element 96, as well as a particulate<br>
filter, a liquid reductant system and/or other exhaust filtration system devices.<br>
The heating element 96 may be used to heat the oxidation catalyst 94 during<br>
startup of the engine 14 and be controlled by the control module 50. The liquid<br>
reductant may include urea, ammonia, or some other liquid reductant. Liquid<br>
reductant is injected into the exhaust stream to react with NOx to generate water<br>
vapor (H2O) and N2 (nitrogen gas).<br>
[0032] The vehicle control system 10 may include non-transmission<br>
elevation sensors 100, as well as other sensors. The non-transmission elevation<br>
sensors 100 may include, for example, a barometric sensor 102, a MAF sensor<br>
104 and a MAP sensor 106. Other non-transmission elevation sensors, such as<br>
altitude sensors, may be incorporated. In one embodiment, elevation sensors<br>
that directly measure elevation, such as altitude sensors, are not incorporated.<br>
For example only, elevation may be determined and/or estimated based on<br>
signals from the pressure sensors 26. Elevation may also be estimated based<br>
on signals from non-transmission elevation sensors that provide indirect<br>
indications of elevation. For example only, elevation may be indirectly<br>
determined by the MAF sensor 104 or the MAP sensor 106.<br><br>
[0033] The vehicle control system 10 may include an engine<br>
temperature sensor 118 and an exhaust temperature sensor 120. The engine<br>
temperature sensor 118 may detect oil or coolant temperature of the engine 54<br>
or some other engine temperature. The exhaust temperature sensor 120 may<br>
detect temperature of the oxidation catalyst 94 or some other component of the<br>
exhaust system 58.<br>
[0034] Other sensor inputs collectively indicated by reference number<br>
122 and may be used by the main control module 80 and include an engine<br>
speed signal 124, a vehicle speed signal 126, a power supply signal 128, oil<br>
pressure signal 130, an engine temperature signal 132, and a cylinder<br>
identification signal 134. The sensor input signals 124-134 are respectively<br>
generated by engine speed sensor 136, vehicle speed sensor 138, a power<br>
supply sensor 140, an oil pressure sensor 142, an engine temperature sensor<br>
144, and cylinder identification sensor 146. Some other sensor inputs may<br>
include an intake manifold pressure signal, a throttle position signal, a<br>
transmission signal, and manifold air temperature signal.<br>
[0035] The vehicle control system 10 may also include one or more<br>
timing sensors 148. Although the timing sensor 148 is shown as a crankshaft<br>
position sensor, the timing sensor 148 may be a camshaft position sensor, a<br>
transmission sensor, or some other timing sensor. The timing sensor 148<br>
generates a timing signal that is indicative of position of one or more pistons<br>
and/or a crankshaft and/or a camshaft.<br><br>
[0036] The main control module 50 operates the engine 14 and the<br>
transmission 16 based on elevation estimates. The elevation estimates may be<br>
generated based on signals from each of the pressure sensors 26 and the non-<br>
transmission elevation sensors 100. The transmission 16 is controlled based on<br>
determined output power of the engine 14 and the elevation estimates. The<br>
determined output power may be based on the elevation estimates.<br>
[0037] Referring now to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram and<br>
sectional view of a portion of a transmission 150 is shown. The transmission 150<br>
includes a clutch assembly 152 operable for transferring torque with a clutch<br>
pack 154 that is disposed within a clutch housing 156. The clutch housing 156 is<br>
splined at 158 to receive the clutch pack 154, although a separate member, such<br>
as a clutch drum or another clutch member, may be used in place of the clutch<br>
pack 154. The clutch pack 154 has clutch plates 160 and friction plates 162.<br>
Additional clutch assemblies may be incorporated.<br>
[0038] The clutch plates 160 are interposed between the friction plates<br>
162, which are splined to a clutch hub 164. The clutch plates 160 and the friction<br>
plates 162 may be selectively engaged by an apply piston 166. The clutch<br>
assembly 152 further includes a return spring 168 disposed between the apply<br>
piston 166 and a balance piston 170. The return spring 168 applies a return<br>
force to the apply piston 166 in the direction of arrow R. An external retaining<br>
ring 172, which may also be adapted for retaining the balance piston 170, is<br>
disposed within a retainer groove 174 that is defined by the clutch housing 176.<br><br>
[0039] The clutch assembly 152 is in communication with and<br>
controlled by a control module 180, which is configured to include a transmission<br>
control algorithm. The control module 180 includes a pressure control algorithm.<br>
The pressure control algorithm may be configured as a portion of the<br>
transmission control algorithm. The transmission control algorithm controls shift<br>
states and phases, commanded pressure profiles, sensors and associated signal<br>
conditioning, etc. Progression through the pressure control algorithm may be<br>
modified, changed, and/or aborted based on the transmission control algorithm<br>
and transmission inputs, such as turbine speed, pressure sensor inputs, etc.<br>
[0040] The pressure control algorithm may be used to control pressure-<br>
related events. Atmospheric conditions may be checked and verified by pressure<br>
sensor inputs from pressure sensors, such as from a pressure sensor 192. The<br>
pressure sensor may measure pressures approximately between -5000 to<br>
5000psi ±1%. Examples of additional Inputs to the pressure control algorithm<br>
include turbine speed and output speed, which are monitored to properly<br>
diagnose the state of the transmission.<br>
[0041] The control module 180 is in direct or indirect/wireless<br>
communication with a pressure control solenoid 190 and one or more pressure<br>
sensors (a single pressure sensor 192 is shown). The sensor 192 may be<br>
located downstream of the pressure control solenoid 190. The sensor 192 may<br>
be located in the clutch assembly 152 or in a valve body assembly (valve body<br>
not detailed in FIG. 2).<br><br>
[0042] The pressure control solenoid 190 is configured for selectively<br>
admitting or preventing a flow of pressurized fluid F, from a pump. The pressure<br>
control solenoid 190 can be configured to selectively allow fluid exhaust and<br>
therefore atmospheric pressure into the clutch control assembly 152 and/or to the<br>
pressure sensor 192.<br>
[0043] Each shift from one speed ratio to another includes pressurizing<br>
passage way 194 to fill an on-coming clutch with pressurized fluid in preparation<br>
for torque transmission. The pressurized fluid compresses the internal return<br>
spring 168, thereby stroking the apply piston 166. Once sufficiently filled, the<br>
apply piston 166 applies a clutch apply force to the clutch plates 160 and friction<br>
plates 162 in the direction of arrow A. This develops a torque capacity exceeding<br>
the return force (arrow R) of the return spring 168. Thereafter, the clutch<br>
assembly 152 may transmit torque in relation to a clutch apply pressure.<br>
[0044] During pressurization of the passageway 194, atmospheric<br>
pressure is not measured by the pressure sensor 192. Hydraulic fluid may be<br>
exhausted at a low flow rate through an orifice or exhaust control port denoted as<br>
CE. This allows trapped air to exhaust, thereby depressurizing to atmospheric<br>
pressure during moments of clutch de-stroking.<br>
[0045] During non-pressurized events, the fluid in passageway 194 is<br>
exhausted to transmission sump 193 by way of a self-exhausting mechanism.<br>
The exhausting mechanism may be passive and/or active and include a solenoid,<br>
a valve with a check ball (when unseated pressure is released), etc. In the<br><br>
example shown in FIG. 2, the exhausting mechanism is passive and includes an<br>
orifice 196 that allows for fluid exhaust of passageway 194. The opening of the<br>
orifice may be controlled via a valve. The orifice may be fluidically coupled to a<br>
fluid overflow port 195. The fluid that is exhausted via the exhausting<br>
mechanism may be provided to the fluid overflow port 195. Because of a fluid<br>
overflow port 195 the pressure inside of the transmission is equal to the pressure<br>
of the atmosphere. Therefore the pressure in the passageway 194 is equal to<br>
the atmosphere pressure.<br>
[0046] The exhausting of fluid allows the applied pressure on the clutch<br>
due to transmission operation to decrease to a non-pressurized state. This may<br>
be referred to as an exhausted state. Atmospheric pressures may be detected<br>
when a pressure sensor indicates that an exhausted state is present and<br>
atmospheric pressure is present. At this point the clutch is fully disengaged. The<br>
pressure sensors disclosed herein may be calibrated to generate a pressure of<br>
zero when clutch applied hydraulic fluid pressure is zero (exhausted) and<br>
elevation of the corresponding vehicle is at sea level.<br>
[0047] The pressure control solenoid 190 may be a two-way control<br>
valve and be used in combination with or in replacement of the exhausting<br>
mechanism and/or orifice 196. The pressure control solenoid 190 may, in<br>
addition to controlling the flow of fluid into passageway 194, allow for the release<br>
of fluid from passageway 194 into the sump 193.<br><br>
[0048] A back-pressure exhaust port 197 may also be included. The<br>
exhaust port 197 allows fluid to flow to sump 193 and thus neutralize pressures<br>
near the piston 170. The exhaust port may be open or fluidically coupled to the<br>
overflow port 195.<br>
[0049] Referring now to FIG. 3, an exemplary vehicle control system<br>
200 is shown. An engine 202 is coupled to a transmission 204 by a torque<br>
converter 206. A main control module 208 communicates with the engine 202,<br>
the transmission 204 and the torque converter 206. The main control module<br>
208 receives an estimated elevation signal from an elevation estimation module<br>
210. The main control module 208 may include the elevation estimation module.<br>
The main control module 208 also receives signals from the non-transmission<br>
elevation sensors 212. The non-transmission elevation sensors 212 provide<br>
signals that indicate vehicle elevation.<br>
[0050] The elevation estimation module 210 receives transmission<br>
pressure signals from transmission pressure sensors 214. The transmission<br>
pressure signals may be based on hydraulic and/or atmospheric pressures within<br>
the transmission 204. The transmission 204 is open to atmospheric pressure via<br>
one or more holes or non-sealed elements, such as the inlet 216, of the<br>
transmission 204.<br>
[0051] The elevation estimation module 210 generates the estimated<br>
elevation signal based on the pressure signals. The elevation estimation module<br>
210 may generate the estimated elevation signal when the pressure signals are<br><br>
and/or an average of the pressure signals is below one or more predetermined<br>
threshold levels. During operation hydraulic pressures in the transmission can<br>
be higher than atmospheric pressure and affect the estimate of elevation. The<br>
elevation estimation module 210 estimates elevation during certain operating<br>
conditions or when pressure on one or more of the pressure sensors 214 is less<br>
than a predetermined threshold.<br>
[0052] During operation, one or more of hydraulic clutches of the<br>
transmission 204 may be in an OFF state. When in an OFF state hydraulic<br>
pressure associated with that clutch is low. When the hydraulic pressure is low,<br>
the corresponding pressure sensor is able to detect atmospheric pressure or an<br>
approximation thereof. Each of the pressure sensors 214 may correspond to one<br>
or more hydraulic clutches of the transmission 204.<br>
[0053] Each of the pressure sensors 214 thus operate in dual modes.<br>
In a first mode, the pressure sensors 214 may be used to detect hydraulic<br>
pressure applied to a hydraulic clutch. In a second mode, the pressure sensors<br>
214 may be used to detect atmospheric pressure. The pressure sensors 214<br>
may all operate in the same mode during the same time period or may operate in<br>
different modes during the same time period.<br>
[0054] Pressure sensor signals may be measured when the<br>
corresponding vehicle is not accelerating or decelerating. During this operating<br>
condition, a predetermined pressure may be expected. When the actual<br>
pressure detected by a pressure sensor is higher than the expected pressure or<br><br>
is outside of a predetermined range, the vehicle may be at a low elevation level.<br>
When the actual pressure detected by a pressure signal is lower than the<br>
expected pressure or is outside of a predetermined range, the vehicle may be at<br>
a high elevation level. This may be performed at a particular engine speed that<br>
is predetermined. The actual pressure detected may be applied to a model to<br>
extrapolate atmospheric pressure.<br>
[0055] The pressure signals may be used for cross-check, diagnostic<br>
check, performance check, etc. During a cross-check, the pressure signal from<br>
one pressure sensor may be compared with a pressure signal from other<br>
pressure sensors. In another embodiment, during a cross-check, an elevation<br>
estimate generated based on a signal from one pressure sensor is compared<br>
with elevation estimates from other pressure sensors and/or from non-<br>
transmission elevation sensors.<br>
[0056] The pressure sensors 214 and the non-transmission elevation<br>
sensors 212 provide redundancy in case of a sensor failure. The pressure<br>
sensors 214 may backup each other and/or the non-transmission elevation<br>
sensors 212. The non-transmission elevation sensors 212 may backup each<br>
other and/or the pressure sensors 214.<br>
[0057] Referring now also to FIG. 4, a functional block diagram of the<br>
elevation estimation module 210 is shown. The elevation estimation module 210<br>
may include an error detection module 220, an averaging module 222, an<br>
estimation control module 224, and look-up tables 226. The error detection<br><br>
module 220 may detect when a one of multiple transmission pressure sensors is<br>
operating inappropriately. For example when one transmission pressure sensor<br>
provides a different atmospheric pressure than other transmission pressure<br>
sensors an error may be detected. This error may be indicated to a vehicle main<br>
control module, a vehicle operator, and/or may be stored in memory.<br>
[0058] The averaging module 222 receives the hydraulic pressure<br>
signals from one or more of the pressure sensors of 214. The averaging module<br>
222 may average the signals receives from the pressure sensors 214. The<br>
estimation control module 224 may estimate vehicle elevation based on the<br>
average of the signals from the pressure sensors 214 and based on the look-up<br>
tables 226.<br>
[0059] The estimation control module 224 may generate elevation<br>
estimations corresponding to each pressure signal from each transmission<br>
pressure sensor. The look-up tables 226 may include predetermined values<br>
relating pressure sensor output signals to barometric pressure, elevation,<br>
altitude, etc. The averaging module 222 may generate an average elevation<br>
estimation signal based on an average of the elevation estimates from the<br>
estimation control module 224.<br>
[0060] Referring now also to FIG. 5, a functional block diagram of a<br>
main control module 230, such as the control modules 50 and 180 is shown. The<br>
main control module 230 includes an environmental operation module 232. The<br>
environmental operation module 232 may receive an estimated elevation signal,<br><br>
such as from the elevation estimation module 210. The environmental operation<br>
module 232 also receives non-transmission elevation signals from non-<br>
transmission elevation sensors, such as sensors 212. The environmental<br>
operation module 232 generates control signals based on one or more of the<br>
estimated elevation signal and the non-transmission elevation signals.<br>
[0061] In one embodiment, the environmental operation module 232<br>
may generate the control signals based an average of elevation estimates<br>
determined from transmission and non-transmission based elevation signals.<br>
Examples of transmission and non-transmission based elevation signals are the<br>
estimated elevation signals and the non-transmission elevation signals described<br>
herein. Selected elevation signals may be disregarded, such as when a sensor<br>
is providing an inaccurate signal.<br>
[0062] To determine when an elevation sensor (transmission or non-<br>
transmission based) is operating inappropriately, elevation estimates generated<br>
based on transmission and/or non-transmission elevation sensors may be<br>
compared. The environmental operation module 232 may generate the control<br>
signals based on an average of elevation estimates that are from sensors that<br>
are operating appropriately. When all of the elevation estimates are determined<br>
to be inaccurate, the environmental operation module 232 may generate the<br>
control signals based on other vehicle parameters and sensor outputs.<br>
[0063] The control signals may control operation of a fuel injection<br>
system, an air injection system, an ignition system, etc. The control signals may<br><br>
include fuel control signals, airflow control signals, ignition timing signals, etc.<br>
For example, the control signals may be throttle control signals that increase or<br>
decrease airflow into the engine based on the elevation. The control signals may<br>
also be fuel injector control signals that increase or decrease a fuel supply to the<br>
engine based on the elevation. The control signals modify the air-to-fuel ratio<br>
(A/F) of the engine based on elevation. For example, at a higher elevation, more<br>
air is required because the air pressure is lower.<br>
[0064] Referring now to FIG. 6, a flowchart illustrating the operation of<br>
a vehicle control system is shown. Control may begin at step 352. In step 354,<br>
the control system determines whether the engine has been started. If true,<br>
control proceeds to step 356, otherwise control returns to step 354.<br>
[0065] In step 356, the control system determines whether the<br>
hydraulic pressure in the transmission is below a threshold. If true, control<br>
proceeds to step 360, otherwise control proceeds to step 358. In step 358, the<br>
control system generates control signals based on the elevation signals from the<br>
elevation sensors (normal mode), and control returns to step 354.<br>
[0066] In step 360, the control system generates elevation estimations<br>
corresponding to each transmission pressure signal from transmission pressure<br>
sensors and may also generate elevation estimates based on each non-<br>
transmission elevation sensor. The elevation estimates may be based on look-<br>
up tables, such as the look-up tables. The vehicle control system then generates<br><br>
an average elevation estimation signal by averaging the elevation estimations.<br>
Control then proceeds to step 362.<br>
[0067] In step 362, the control system performs at least one of two<br>
operations. The control system may cross-check each elevation estimate with<br>
other elevation estimates and/or with the average elevation estimation signal to<br>
determine if there was an error (i.e. a false reading) in any of the sensors. If the<br>
difference between an elevation estimate and other elevation estimates, or<br>
between an elevation estimate and an average elevation estimate exceeds a<br>
threshold value, an error is detected.<br>
[0068] The control system may also average the elevation estimates to<br>
generate an elevation value for use in generating the control signals. The control<br>
system may also disregard elevation signals determined to be false readings,<br>
and average the remaining elevation estimates to generate the elevation value.<br>
[0069] In step 364, the control system generates control signals, such<br>
as the control signals, based on the elevation value. The control signals may<br>
improve vehicle environmental operating characteristics. For example, at a high<br>
elevation more intake air is required because there is less air pressure.<br>
Therefore, the control signals may increase airflow by increasing throttle. Control<br>
then returns to step 354.<br>
[0070] The above-described steps are meant to be illustrative<br>
examples; the steps may be performed sequentially, synchronously,<br><br>
simultaneously, continuously, during overlapping time periods or in a different<br>
order depending upon the application.<br>
[0071] The embodiments of the present disclosure allow for the<br>
checking for an error or failure in sensors of various systems. These errors or<br>
failures may be due to debris on a sensor or due to wear and tear, age, or<br>
damage to a sensor or corresponding circuitry. Deviation from expected sensor<br>
readings and or expected elevation estimates may be used to indicate an error or<br>
failure. Outputs from transmission pressure sensors and/or elevation sensors<br>
may be average for improved accuracy, and used as a performance check for<br>
redundancy purposes. Outputs from transmission pressure sensors may be<br>
used as a sense check of a stand alone barometric sensor or altitude sensor.<br>
[0072] The above-described embodiments include estimation of vehicle<br>
elevation using transmission pressure sensors. This elevation estimation may be<br>
determined with or without use of non-transmission elevation sensors, such as a<br>
barometric pressure sensor located external to a transmission. Pressure signals<br>
from the pressure sensors may be used to estimate elevation when non-<br>
transmission elevation sensors are providing an inaccurate elevation indication.<br>
The pressure signals may also be used to check accuracy of the non-<br>
transmission elevation sensors.<br>
[0073] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented<br>
in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in<br><br>
