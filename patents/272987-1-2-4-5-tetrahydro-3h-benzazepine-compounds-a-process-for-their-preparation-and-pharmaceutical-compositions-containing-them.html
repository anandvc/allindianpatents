PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY<br>
EXAMPLE 86 : Effect of compounds on the spontaneous beating rate of the right atrium in the rat<br>
Male WISTAR rats weighing from 325 to 375 g are anaesthetised by ip injection of<br>
 <br>
pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg). The heart is rapidly excised and placed in a physiological solution at 4°C which contains (in mM): NaCl 120.3, KC1 4.8, CaCl2 2.5,<br>
KH2PO4 1.0, MgSO4 1.3, NaHC03 24.2, glucose 11.1, Ca-EDTA 0.016, and which is<br>
oxygenated (carbogene 95 %O2 + 5 % CO2), pH 7.4. The right atrium (RA), which beats<br>
spontaneously, is isolated, placed in a basin, thermostatically controlled at 35°C, containing 20 ml of physiological solution and connected to an isometric tension sensor (model IT-25, EMKA Technologies, Paris, France). The initial tension is set at 0.4 g. The spontaneous beating rate is measured by IOX software (EMKA Technologies, Paris, France). Preparations whose spontaneous beating rate is not between 200 and 300 beats per minute are excluded.<br>
The compounds are dissolved daily at 10-2M. The following dilutions are stored in ice over the duration of the experiment.<br>
After stabilisation for 30 minutes, the compound under test is added to the medium in cumulative manner every 15 minutes (4 concentrations). The reductions in beating rate are expressed as a percentage relative to the initial rate. The concentration that reduces the initial beating rate by 30 % (I-C30) is calculated and expressed in terms of molarity (uM).<br>
