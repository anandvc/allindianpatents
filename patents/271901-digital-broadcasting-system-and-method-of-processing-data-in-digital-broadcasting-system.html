DIGITAL BROADCASTING SYSTEM AND METHOD OF<br>
PROCESSING DATA IN DIGITAL BROADCASTING SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] The present invention relates to a digital broadcasting system, and more particularly,<br>
to a digital broadcasting system and a data processing method.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2] The Vestigial Sideband (VSB) transmission mode, which is adopted as the standard<br>
for digital broadcasting in North America and the Republic of Korea, is a system using<br>
a single carrier method. Therefore, the receiving performance of the digital broadcast<br>
receiving system may be deteriorated in a poor channel environment. Particularly,<br>
since resistance to changes in channels and noise is more highly required when using<br>
portable and/or mobile broadcast receivers, the receiving performance may be even<br>
more deteriorated when transmitting mobile service data by the VSB transmission<br>
mode.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[3] An object of the present invention is to provide a digital broadcasting system and a<br>
data processing method that are highly resistant to channel changes and noise. An<br>
object of the present invention is to provide a digital broadcasting system and a method<br>
of processing data in a digital broadcasting system that can enhance the receiving<br>
performance of a receiving system (or receiver) by having a transmitting system (or<br>
transmitter) perform additional encoding on mobile service data. Another object of the<br>
present invention is to provide a digital broadcasting system and a method of<br>
processing data in the digital broadcasting system that can also enhance the receiving<br>
performance of a digital broadcast receiving system by inserting known data already<br>
known in accordance with a pre-agreement between the receiving system and the<br>
transmitting system in a predetermined region within a data region.<br>
[4] Another object of the present invention is to provide a digital broadcasting system<br>
and a data processing method which can quickly acquire status information of a virtual<br>
channel transferring mobile service data when the mobile service data is multiplexed<br>
with main service data and the multiplexed resultant data is transmitted.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[5] The present invention provides a data processing method. The data processing<br>
method includes receiving a broadcast signal in which main service data and mobile<br>
service data are multiplexed, acquiring transmission-parameter-channel signaling in-<br>
formation including transmission parameter information of the mobile service data,<br>
and fast-information-channel signaling information, acquiring binding information<br>
describing a relationship between at least one ensemble transferring the mobile service<br>
data and a first virtual channel contained in the at least one ensemble by decoding the<br>
fast-information-channel, and acquiring status information of the first virtual channel,<br>
displaying content data contained in the mobile service data according to the binding<br>
information and the status information of the first virtual channel.<br>
[6] If the status information of the first virtual channel is the active channel, the method<br>
further includes acquiring ensemble identification information transferring the first<br>
virtual channel using the binding information, and receiving at least one mobile service<br>
data group transferring an ensemble associated with the ensemble identification in-<br>
formation, parsing service table information contained in the ensemble and decoding<br>
content data contained in the first virtual channel using the parsed service table in-<br>
formation, and displaying the decoded content data.<br>
[7] If the status information of the first virtual channel is the inactive channel, the<br>
method further includes acquiring ensemble identification information transferring the<br>
second virtual channel using the binding information, and receiving at least one mobile<br>
service data group transferring an ensemble associated with the ensemble identification<br>
information, parsing service table information contained in the ensemble and decoding<br>
content data contained in the second virtual channel using the parsed service table in-<br>
formation, and displaying the decoded content data.<br>
[8] The method further includes acquiring version information of service guide in-<br>
formation associated with the mobile service data from the fast-information-channel<br>
signaling information, acquiring ensemble identification information exclusively<br>
transferring the service guide information according to the version information of the<br>
service guide information, and receiving at least one mobile service data group<br>
transferring an ensemble associated with the ensemble identification information and<br>
displaying the service guide information transferred in the ensemble.<br>
[9] The status information of the first virtual channel includes either of inactive time in-<br>
formation and active time information of the first virtual channel.<br>
[10] The present invention includes a digital broadcasting system. The digital<br>
broadcasting system includes a baseband processor configured to extract fast-<br>
information-channel signaling information including binding information describing a<br>
relationship between a first virtual channel of mobile service data and an ensemble<br>
transferring the first virtual channel, and status information of the first virtual channel,<br>
from a broadcast signal, a management processor configured to acquire the binding in-<br>
formation and the channel status information by decoding the fast-information-channel<br>
signaling information, and a presentation processor configured to display content data<br>
contained in the mobile service data according to the channel status information.<br>
[11] The status information of the first virtual channel indicates whether the first virtual<br>
channel is any one of a active channel, an inactive channel, a hidden channel, and a<br>
software download channel.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[12] The digital broadcast system and the data processing method according to the present<br>
invention have strong resistance to any errors encountered when mobile service data is<br>
transmitted over the channel, and can be easily compatible with the conventional<br>
receiver.<br>
[13] The digital broadcast system according to the present invention can normally receive<br>
mobile service data without any errors over a poor channel which has lots of ghosts<br>
and noises. The digital broadcast system according to the present invention inserts<br>
known data at a specific location of a data zone, and performs signal transmission,<br>
thereby increasing the Rx performance under a high-variation channel environment.<br>
Specifically, the digital broadcasting system and the data processing method according<br>
to the present invention can be more effectively used for mobile phones or mobile<br>
receivers, channel conditions of which are excessively changed and have weak re-<br>
sistances to noise.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[47] Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, which is capable of achieving the object. Herein structures and operations of<br>
the invention illustrated in figures and described by being referred to the figures are<br>
embodiments, and the technical spirits and core structures of the invention are not<br>
limited in the embodiments.<br>
[48]<br>
[49] Definition of the terms used in the embodiments<br>
[50] Although the terms used in the present invention are selected from generally known<br>
and used terms, some of the terms mentioned in the description of the present<br>
invention have been selected by the applicant at his or her discretion, the detailed<br>
meanings of which are described in relevant parts of the description herein.<br>
Furthermore, it is required that the present invention is understood, not simply by the<br>
actual terms used but by the meaning of each term lying within.<br>
[51] Among the terms used in the description of the present invention, main service data<br>
correspond to data that can be received by a fixed receiving system and may include<br>
audio/video (A/V)data. More specifically, the main service data may include A/V data<br>
of high definition (HD) or standard definition (SD) levels and may also include diverse<br>
data types required for data broadcasting. Also, the known data correspond to data pre-<br>
known in accordance with a pre-arranged agreement between the receiving system and<br>
the transmitting system.<br>
[52] Additionally, among the terms used in the present invention, "MFf'corresponds to the<br>
initials of "mobile" and "handheld" and represents the opposite concept of a fixed-type<br>
system. Furthermore, the MH service data may include at least one of mobile service<br>
data and handheld service data, and will also be referred to as "mobile service data" for<br>
simplicity. Herein, the mobile service data not only correspondto MH service data but<br>
may also include any type of service data with mobile or portable characteristics.<br>
Therefore, the mobile service data according to the present invention are not limited<br>
only to the MH service data.<br>
[53] The above-described mobile service data may correspond to data having information,<br>
such as program execution files, stock information, and so on, and may also<br>
correspond to A/V data. Most particularly, the mobile service data may correspond to<br>
A/V data having lower resolution and lowerdata rate as compared to the main service<br>
data. For example, if an A/V codec that is used for a conventional main service<br>
corresponds to a MPEG-2 codec, a MPEG-4 advanced video coding (AVC) or scalable<br>
video coding (SVC) having better image compression efficiency may be used as the A/<br>
V codec for the mobile service. Furthermore, any type of data may be transmitted as<br>
the mobile service data. For example, transport protocol expert group (TPEG) data for<br>
broadcasting real-time transportation information may be transmitted as the main<br>
service data.<br>
[54] Also, a data service using the mobile service data may include weather forecast<br>
services, traffic information services, stock information services, viewer participation<br>
quiz programs, real-time polls and surveys,interactive education broadcast programs,<br>
gaming services, services providing information on synopsis, character, background<br>
music, and filming sites of soap operas or series, services providing information on<br>
past match scores and player profiles and achievements, and services providing in-<br>
formation on product information and programs classified by service, medium, time,<br>
and theme enabling purchase orders to be processed. Herein, the present invention is<br>
not limited only to the services mentioned above.<br>
[55] In the present invention, the transmitting system provides backward compatibility in<br>
the main service data so as to be received by the conventional receiving system.<br>
Herein, the main service data and the mobile service data are multiplexed to the same<br>
physical channel and then transmitted.<br>
[56] Furthermore, the digital broadcast transmitting system according to the present<br>
invention performs additional encoding on the mobile service data and inserts the data<br>
already known by the receiving system and transmitting system (e.g., known data),<br>
thereby transmitting the processed data.<br>
[57] Therefore, when using the transmitting system according to the present invention, the<br>
receiving system may receive the mobile service data during a mobile state and may<br>
also receive the mobile service data with stability despite various distortion and noise<br>
occurring within the channel.<br>
[58]<br>
[59] Receiving System<br>
[60] FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram showing a general structure of a digital<br>
broadcasting receiving system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The digital broadcast receiving system according to the present invention includes a<br>
baseband processor 100, a management processor 200, and a presentation processor<br>
300.<br>
[61] The baseband processor 100 includes an operation controller 110, a tuner 120, a de-<br>
modulator 130, an equalizer 140, a known sequence detector (or known data detector)<br>
150, a block decoder (or mobile handheld block decoder) 160, a promary Reed-<br>
Solomon (RS) frame decoder 170, a secondary RS frame decoder 180, and a signaling<br>
decoder 190. The operation controller 110 controls the operation of each block<br>
included in the baseband processor 100.<br>
[62] By tuning the receiving system to a specific physical channel frequency, the tuner<br>
120 enables the receiving system to receive main service data, which correspond to<br>
broadcast signals for fixed-type broadcast receiving systems, and mobile service data,<br>
which correspond to broadcast signals for mobile broadcast receiving systems. At this<br>
point, the tuned frequency of the specific physical channel is down-converted to an in-<br>
termediate frequency (IF) signal, thereby being outputted to the demodulator 130 and<br>
the known sequence detector 140. The passband digital IF signal being outputted from<br>
the tuner 120 may only include main service data, or only include mobile service data,<br>
or include both main service data and mobile service data.<br>
[63] The demodulator 130 performs self-gain control, carrier wave recovery, and timing<br>
recovery processes on the passband digital IF signal inputted from the tuner 120,<br>
thereby modifying the IF signal to a baseband signal. Then, the demodulator 130<br>
outputs the baseband signal to the equalizer 140 and the known sequence detector 150.<br>
The demodulator 130 uses the known data symbol sequence inputted from the known<br>
sequence detector 150 during the timing and/or carrier wave recovery, thereby<br>
enhancing the demodulating performance.<br>
[64] The equalizer 140 compensates channel-associated distortion included in the signal<br>
demodulated by the demodulator 130. Then, the equalizer 140 outputs the distortion-<br>
compensated signal to the blcok decoder 160. By using a known data symbol sequence<br>
inputted from the lnown sequence detector 150, the equalizer 140 may enhance the<br>
equalizing performance. Furthermore, the equalizer 140 may receive feed-back on the<br>
decoding result from the block decoder 160, thereby enhancing the equalizing<br>
performance.<br>
[65] The known sequence detector 150 detects known data place (or position) inserted by<br>
the transmitting system from the input/output data (i.e., data prior to being de-<br>
modulated or data being processed with partial demodulation). Then, the known<br>
sequence detector 150 outputs the detected known data position information and<br>
known data sequence generated from the detected position information to the de-<br>
modulator 130 and the equalizer 140. Additionally, in order to allow the block decoder<br>
160 to identify the mobile service data that have been processed with additional<br>
encoding by the transmitting system and the main service data that have not been<br>
processed with any additional encoding, the known sequence detector 150 outputs such<br>
corresponding information to the block decoder 160.<br>
[66] If the data channel-equalized by the equalizer 140 and inputted to the block decoder<br>
160 correspond to data processed with both block-encoding and trellis-encoding by the<br>
transmitting system (i.e., data within the RS frame, signaling data), the block decoder<br>
160 may perform trellis-decoding and block-decoding as inverse processes of the<br>
transmitting system. On the other hand, if the data channel-equalized by the equalizer<br>
140 and inputted to the block decoder 160 correspond to data processed only with<br>
trellis-encoding and not block-encoding by the transmitting system (i.e., main service<br>
data), the block decoder 160 may perform only trellis-decoding.<br>
[67] The signaling decoder 190 decoded signaling data that have been channel-equalized<br>
and inputted from the equalizer 140. It is assumed that the signaling data inputted to<br>
the signaling decoder 190 correspond to data processed with both block-encoding and<br>
trellis-encoding by the transmitting system. Examples of such signaling data may<br>
include transmission parameter channel (TPC) data and fast information channel (FIC)<br>
data. Each type of data will be described in more detail in a later process. The FTC data<br>
decoded by the signaling decoder 190 are outputted to the FIC handler 215. And, the<br>
TPC data decoded by the signlaing decoder 190 are outputted to the TPC handler 214.<br>
[68] Meanwhile, according to the present invention, the transmitting system uses RS<br>
frames by encoding units. Herein, the RS frame may be divided into a primary RS<br>
frame and a secondary RS frame. However, according to the embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the primary RS frame and the secodnary RS frame will be divided<br>
based upon the level of importance of the corresponding data.<br>
[69] The primary RS frame decoder 170 receives the data outputted from the block<br>
decoder 160. At this point, according to the embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
primary RS frame decoder 170 receives only the mobile service data that have been<br>
Reed-Solomon (RS)-encoded and/or cyclic reduncancy check (CRC)-encoded from the<br>
block decoder 160.<br>
[70] Herein, the primary RS frame decoder 170 receives only the mobile service dataand<br>
not the main service data. The primary RS frame decoder 170 performs inverse<br>
processes of an RS frame encoder (not shown) included in the digital broadcast<br>
transmitting system, thereby correcting errors existing within the primary RS frame.<br>
More specifically, the primary RS frame decoder 170 forms a primary RS frame by<br>
grouping a plurality of data groups and, then, correct errors in primary RS frame units.<br>
In other words, the primary RS frame decoder 170 decodes primary RS frames, which<br>
are being transmitted for actual broadcast services.<br>
[71] Additionally, the secondary RS frame decoder 180 receives the data outputted from<br>
the block decoder 160. At this point, according to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the secondary RS frame decoder 180 receives only the mobile service data<br>
that have been RS-encoded and/or CRC-encoded from the block decoder 160. Herein,<br>
the secondary RS frame decoder 1 SO receives only the mobile service data and not the<br>
main service data. The secondary RS frame decoder 180 performs inverse processes of<br>
an RS frame encoder (not shown) included in the digital broadcast transmitting system,<br>
thereby correcting errors existing within the secondary RS frame. More specifically,<br>
the secondary RS frame decoder 180 forms a secondary RS frame by grouping a<br>
plurality of data groups and, then, correct errors in secondary RS frame units. In other<br>
words, the secondary RS frame decoder 180 decodes secondary RS frames, which are<br>
being transmitted for mobile audio service data, mobile video service data, guide data,<br>
and so on.<br>
[72] Meanwhile, the management processor 200according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention includes an MH physical adaptation processor 210, an IP network<br>
stack 220, a streaming handler 230, a system information (SI) handler 240, a file<br>
handler 250, a multi-purpose internet main extensions (MIME) type handler 260, and<br>
an electronic service guide (ESG) handler 270, and an ESG decoder 280, and a storage<br>
unit 290.<br>
[73] The MH physical adaptation processor 210 includes a primary RS frame handler 211,<br>
a secondary RS frame handler 212, an MH transport packet (TP) handler 213, a TPC<br>
handler 214, an FIC handler 215, and a physical adpatation control signal handler 216.<br>
[74] The TPC handler 214 receives and processes baseband information required by<br>
modules corresponding to the MH physical adaptation processor 210. The baseband in-<br>
formation is inputted in the form of TPC data. Herein, the TPC handler 214 uses this<br>
information to process the FIC data, which have been sent from the baseband processor<br>
100.<br>
[75] The TPC data are transmitted from the transmitting system to the receiving system<br>
via a predetermined region of a data group. The TPC data may include at least one of<br>
an MH ensemble ID, an MH sub-frame number, a total number of MH groups (TNoG),<br>
an RS frame continuity counter, a column size of RS frame (N), and an FIC version<br>
number.<br>
[76] Herein, the MH ensemble ID indicates an identification number of each MH<br>
ensemble carried in the corresponding channel. The MH sub-frame number signifies a<br>
number identifying the MH sub-frame number in an MH frame, wherein each MH<br>
group associated with the corresponding MH ensemble is transmitted. The TNoG<br>
represents the total number of MH groups including all of the MH groups belonging to<br>
all MH parades included in an MH sub-frame.<br>
[77] The RS frame continuity counter indicates a number that serves as a continuity<br>
counter of the RS frames carrying the corresponding MH ensemble. Herein, the value<br>
of the RS frame continuity counter shall be incrementedby 1 modulo 16 for each<br>
successive RS frame.<br>
[78] N represents the column size of an RS frame belonging to the corresponding MH<br>
ensemble. Herein, the value of N determines the size of each MH TP.<br>
[79] Finally, the FIC version number signifies the version number of an FTC body carried<br>
on the corresponding physical channel.<br>
[80] As described above, diverse TPC data are inputted to the TPC handler 214 via the<br>
signaling decoedr 190 shown in FIG. 1. Then, the received TPC data are processed by<br>
the TPC handler 214. The received TPC data may also be used by the FIC handler 215<br>
in order to process the FTC data.<br>
[81] The FIC handler 215 processes the FIC data by associating the FIC data received<br>
from the baseband processor 100 with the TPC data.<br>
[82] The physical adaptation controlsignal handler 216 collects FIC data received through<br>
the FIC handler 215 and SI data received through RS frames. Then, the physical<br>
adaptation control signal handler 216 uses the collected FIC data and SI data to<br>
configure and process IP datagrams and access information of mobile broadcast<br>
services. Thereafter, the physical adaptation control signal handler 216 stores the<br>
processed IP datagrams and access information to the storage unit 290.<br>
[83] The primary RS frame handler 211 identifies primary RS frames received from the<br>
primary RS frame decoder 170 of the baseband processor 100 for each row unit, so as<br>
to configure an MH TP. Thereafter, the primary RS frame handler 211 outputs the<br>
configured MH TP to the MH TP handler 213.<br>
[84] The secondary RS frame handler 212 identifies secondary RS frames received from<br>
the secondary RS frame decoder 180 of the baseband processor 100 for each row unit,<br>
so as to configure an MH TP. Thereafter, the secondary RS frame handler 212 outputs<br>
the configured MH TP to the MH TP handler 213.<br>
[85] The MH transport packet (TP) handler 213 extracts a header from each MH TP<br>
received from the primary RS frame handler 211 and the secondary RS frame handler<br>
212, thereby determining the data included in the corresponding MH TP. Then, when<br>
the determined data correspond to SI data (i.e., SI data that are not encapsulated to IP<br>
datagrams), the corresponding data are outputted to the physical adaptation control<br>
signal handler 216. Alterantively, when the determined data correspond to an IP<br>
datagram, the corresponding data are outputted to the IP network stack 220.<br>
[86] The IP network stack 220 processes broadcast data that are being transmitted in the<br>
form of IP datagrams. More specifically, the IP network stack 220 processes data that<br>
are inputted via user datagram protocol (UDP), real-time transport protocol (RTP),<br>
real-time transport control protocol (RTCP), asynchronous layered coding/layered<br>
coding transport (ALC/LCT), file delivery over unidirectional transport (FLUTE), and<br>
so on. Herein, when the processed data correspond to streaming data, the cor-<br>
responding data are outputted to the streaming handler 230. And, when the processed<br>
data correspond to data in a file format, the corresponding data are outputted to the file<br>
handler 250. Finally, when the processed data correspond to Si-associated data, the<br>
corresponding data are outputted to the SI handler 240.<br>
[87] The SI handler 240 receives and processes SI data having the form of IP datagrams,<br>
which are inputted to the IP network stack 220. When the inputted data associated with<br>
SI correspond to MIME-type data, the inputted data are outputted to the MIME-type<br>
handler 260. The MIME-type handler 260 receives the MIME-type SI data outputted<br>
from the SI handler 240 and processes the received MIME-type SI data.<br>
[88] The file handler 250 receives data from the IP network stack 220 in an object format<br>
in accordance with the ALC/LCT and FLUTE structures. The file handler 250 groups<br>
the received data to create a file format. Herein, when the correspondingfile includes<br>
ESG, the file is outputted to the ESG handler 270. On the other hand, when the cor-<br>
responding file includes data for other file-based services, the file is outputted to the<br>
presentation controller 330 of the presentation processor 300.<br>
[89] The ESG handler 270 processes the ESG data received from the file handler 250 and<br>
stores the processed ESG data to the storage unit 290. Alternatively, the ESG handler<br>
270 may output the processed ESG data to the ESG decoder 280, thereby allowing the<br>
ESG data to be used by the ESG decoder 280.<br>
[90] The storage unit 290 stores the system information (SI) received from the physical<br>
adaptation control signal handler 210 and the ESG handler 270 therein. Thereafter, the<br>
storage unit 290 transmits the stored SI data to each block.<br>
[91] The ESG decoder 280 either recovers the ESG data and SI data stored in the storage<br>
unit 290 or recovers the ESG data transmitted from the ESG handler 270. Then, the<br>
ESG decoder 280 outputs the recovered data to the presentation controller 330 in a<br>
format that can be outputted to the user.<br>
[92] The streaming handler 230 receives data from the IP network stack 220, wherein the<br>
format of the received data are in accordance with RTP and/or RTCP structures. The<br>
streaming handler 230extracts audio/video streams from the received data, which are<br>
then outputted to the audio/video (A/V) decoder 310 of the presentation processor 300.<br>
The audio/video decoder 310 then decodes each of the audio stream and video stream<br>
received from the streaming handler 230.<br>
[93] The display module 320 of the presentation processor 300 receives audio and video<br>
signals respectively decoded by the A/V decoder 310. Then, the display module 320<br>
provides the received audio and video signals to the user through a speaker and/or a<br>
screen.<br>
[94] The presentation controller 330 corresponds to a controller managing modules that<br>
output data received by the receiving system to the user.<br>
[95] The channel service manager 340 manages an interface with the user, whichenables<br>
the user to use channel-based broadcast services, such as channel map management,<br>
channel service connection, and so on.<br>
[96] The application manager 350 manages an interface with a user using ESG display or<br>
other application services that do not correspond to channel-based services.<br>
[97] Meanwhile,.The streaming handler 230 may include a buffer temporarily storing<br>
audio/video data. The digital broadcasting reception system periodicallysets reference<br>
time information to a system time clock, and then the stored audio/video data can be<br>
transferred to A/V decoder 310 at a constant bitrate. Accordingly, the audio/video data<br>
can be processed at a bitrate and audio/video service can be provided.<br>
[98]<br>
[99] Data Format Structure<br>
[100] Meanwhile, the data structure used in the mobile broadcasting technology according<br>
to the embodiment of the present invention may include a data group structure and an<br>
RS frame structure, which will now be described in detail.<br>
[101] FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary structureof a data group according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
[102] FIG. 2 shows an example of dividing a data group according to the data structure of<br>
the present invention into 10 MH bio In this example, each MH block has the length of<br>
16 segments. Referring to FIG. 2, only the RS parity data are allocated to portions of<br>
the first 5 segments of the MH block 1 (B1) and the last 5 segments of the MH block<br>
10 (B10). The RS parity data are excluded in regions A to D of the data group.<br>
[ 103] More specifically, when it is assumed that one data group is divided into regions A,<br>
B, C, and D.each MH block may be included in any one of region A to region D<br>
depending upon the characteristic of each MH block within the data group.<br>
[104] Herein, the data group is divided into a plurality of regions to be used for different<br>
purposes. More specifically, a region of the main service data having no interference or<br>
a very low interference level may be considered to have a more resistant (or stronger)<br>
receiving performance as compared to regions having higher interference levels. Ad-<br>
ditionally, when using a system inserting and transmitting known data in the data<br>
group, wherein the known data are known based upon an agreement between the<br>
transmitting system and the receiving system, and when consecutively long known<br>
data are to be periodically inserted in the mobile service data, the known data having a<br>
predetermined length may be periodically inserted in the region having no interference<br>
from the main service data (i.e., a region wherein the main service data are not mixed).<br>
However, due to interference from the main service data, it is difficult to periodically<br>
insert known data and also to insert consecutively long known data to a region having<br>
interference from the main service data.<br>
[105] Referring to FIG. 2, MH block 4 (B4) to MH block 7 (B7) correspond toregions<br>
without interference of the main service data. MH block 4 (B4) to MH block 7 (B7)<br>
within the data group shown in FIG. 2correspond to a region where no interference<br>
from the main service data occurs. In this example, a long known data sequence is<br>
inserted at both the beginning and end of each MH block. In the description of the<br>
present invention, the region including MH block 4 (B4) to MH block 7 (B7) will be<br>
referred to as "region A (=B4+B5+B6+B7)". As described above, when the data group<br>
includes region A having a long known data sequence inserted at both the beginning<br>
and end of each MH block, the receiving system is capable of performing equalization<br>
by using the channel information that can be obtained from the known data. Therefore,<br>
the strongest equalizing performance may be yielded (or obtained) from one of region<br>
A to region D.<br>
[106] In the example of the data group shown in FIG. 2, MH block 3 (B3) and MH block 8<br>
(B8) correspond to a region having little interference from the main service data.<br>
Herein, a long known data sequence is inserted in only one side of each MH block B3<br>
and B8. More specifically, due to the interference from the main service data, a long<br>
known data sequence is inserted at the end of MH block 3 (B3), and another long<br>
known data sequence is inserted at the beginning of MH block 8 (B8). In the present<br>
invention, the region including MH block 3 (B3) and MH block 8 (B8) will be referred<br>
to as "region B (=B3+B8)". As described above, when the data group includes region<br>
B having a long known data sequence inserted at only one side (beginning or end) of<br>
each MH block, the receiving system is capable of performing equalization by using<br>
the channel information that can be obtained from the known data. Therefore, a<br>
stronger equalizing performance as compared to region C/D may be yielded (or<br>
obtained).<br>
[ 107] Referring to FIG. 2, MH block 2 (B2) and MH block 9 (B9) correspond to a region<br>
having more interference from the main service data as compared to region B. A long<br>
known data sequence cannot be inserted in any side of MH block 2 (B2) and MH block<br>
9 (B9). Herein, the region including MH block 2 (B2) and MH block 9 (B9) will be<br>
referred to as "region C (=B2+B9)".<br>
[108] Finally, in the example shown in FIG. 2, MH block 1 (Bl) and MH block 10 (B10)<br>
correspond to a region having more interference from the main service data as<br>
compared to region C. Similarly, a long known data sequence cannot be inserted in any<br>
side of MH block 1 (Bl) and MH block 10 (B10). Herein, the region including MH<br>
block 1 (B1) and MH block 10 (B10) will be referred to as "region D (=B1+B10)".<br>
Since region C/D is spaced further apart from the known data sequence, when the<br>
channel environment undergoes frequent and abrupt changes, the receiving<br>
performance of region C/D may be deteriorated.<br>
[109] Additionally, the data group includes a signaling information area wherein signaling<br>
information is assigned (or allocated).<br>
[110] In the present invention, the signaling information area may start from the 1st<br>
segment of the 4th MH block (B4) to a portion of the 2nd segment.<br>
[111] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the signaling information area<br>
for inserting signaling information may start from the 1st segment of the 4th MH block<br>
(B4) to a portion of the 2nd segment. More specifically, 276(=207+69) bytes of the<br>
4thMH block (B4) in each data group are assigned as the signaling information area. In<br>
other words, the signaling information area consists of 207 bytes of the lstsegment and<br>
the first 69 bytes of the 2nd segment of the 4th MH block (B4). The 1st segment of the<br>
4th MH block (B4) corresponds to the 17th or 173rd segment of a VSB field. I<br>
[112] Herein, the signaling information may be identified by two different types of<br>
signaling channels: a transmission parameter channel (TPC) and a fast information<br>
channel (FIC).<br>
[113] Herein, the TPC data may include at least one of an MH ensemble ID, an MH sub-<br>
frame number, a total number of MH groups (TNoG), an RS frame continuity counter,<br>
a column size of RS frame (N), and an FIC version number.However, the TPC data (or<br>
information) presented herein are merely exemplary. And, since the adding or deleting<br>
of signaling information included in the TPC data may be easily adjusted and modified<br>
by one skilled in the art, the present invention will, therefore, not be limited to the<br>
examples set forth herein. Furthermore, the FIC is provided to enable a fast service ac-<br>
quisition of data receivers, and the FIC includes cross layer information between the<br>
physical layer and the upper layer(s). For example, when the data group includes 6<br>
known data sequences, as shown in FIG. 2, the signaling information area is located<br>
between the first known data sequence and the second known data sequence. More<br>
specifically, the first known data sequence is inserted in the last 2 segments of the 3rd<br>
MH block (B3), and the second known data sequence in inserted in the 2nd and<br>
3rdsegments of the 4th MH block (B4). Furthermore, the 3rd to 6thknown data<br>
sequences are respectively inserted in the last 2 segments of each of the 4th, 5th, 6th,<br>
and 7th MH blocks (B4, B5, B6, and B7). The lstand 3rd to 6th known data sequences<br>
are spaced apart by 16 segments.<br>
[114]<br>
[115] FIG. 3 illustrates an RS frame according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[116] The RS frame shown in FIG. 3 corresponds to a collection of one or more data<br>
groups. The RS frame is received for each MH frame in a condition where the<br>
receiving system receives the FIC and processes the received FIC and where the<br>
receiving system is switched to a time-slicing mode so that the receiving system can<br>
receive MH ensembles including ESG entry points. Each RS frame includes IP streams<br>
of each service or ESG, and SMT section data may exist in all RS frames.<br>
[117] The RS frame according to the embodiment of the present invention consists of at<br>
least one MH transport packet (TP). Herein, the MH TP includes an MH header and an<br>
MH payload.<br>
[118] The MH payload may include mobile service data as wekk as signaling data. More<br>
specifically, an MH payload may include only mobile service data, or may include<br>
only signaling data, or may include both mobile service data and signaling data.<br>
[119] According to the embodiment of the present invention, the MH header may identify<br>
(or distinguish) the data types included in the MH payload.More specifically, when the<br>
MH TP includes a first MH header, this indicates that the MH payload includes only<br>
the signaling data. Also, when the MH TP includes a second MH header, this indicates<br>
that the MH payload includes both the signaling data and the mobile service data.<br>
Finally, when MH TP includes a third MH header, this indicates that the MH payload<br>
includes only the mobile service data.<br>
[120] In the example shown in FIG. 3, the RS frame is assigned with IP datagrams (IP<br>
datagram 1 and IP datagram 2) for two service types.<br>
[121] The IP datagram in the MH-TP in the RS frame may include reference time in-<br>
formation (for example, network time stamp (NTP)), the detailed description for the<br>
reference time information will be disclosed by being referred to FIGs. 25 to 29.<br>
[122]<br>
[123] Data Transmission Structure<br>
[124] FIG. 4illustrates a structure of a MH frame for transmitting and receiving mobile<br>
service data according to the present invention.<br>
[125] In the example shown in FIG. 4, one MH frame consists of 5 sub-frames, wherein<br>
each sub-frame includes 16 slots. In this case, the MH frame according to the present<br>
invention includes 5 sub-frames and 80 slots.<br>
[126] Also, in a packet level, one slot is configured of 156 data packets (i.e., transport<br>
stream packets), and in a symbol level, one slot is configured of 156 data segments.<br>
Herein, the size of one slot corresponds to one half (1/2) of a VSB field. More<br>
specifically, since one 207-byte data packet has the same amount of data as a data<br>
segment, a data packet prior to being interleaved may also be used as a data segment<br>
At this point, two VSB fields are grouped to form a VSB frame.<br>
[127]<br>
[128] FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary structure of a VSB frame, wherein one VSB frame<br>
consists of 2 VSB fields (i.e., an odd field and an even field). Herein, each VSB field<br>
includes a field synchronization segment and 312 data segments. The slot corresponds<br>
to a basic time unit for multiplexing the mobile service data and the main service data.<br>
Herein, one slot may either include the mobile service data or be configured only of the<br>
main service data.<br>
[129] If the first 118 data packets within the slot correspond to a data group, the remaining<br>
38 data packets become the main service data packets. In another example, when no<br>
data group exists in a slot, the corresponding slot is configured of 156 main service<br>
data packets.<br>
[130] Meanwhile, when the slots are assigned to a VSB frame, an off-set exists for each<br>
assigned position.<br>
[131]<br>
[132] FIG. 6 illustrates a mapping example of the positions to which the first 4 slots of a<br>
sub-frame are assigned with respect to a VSB frame in a spatial area. And, FIG. 7 il-<br>
lustrates a mapping example of the positions to which the first 4 slots of a sub-frame<br>
are assigned with respect to a VSB frame in a chronological (or time) area.<br>
[ 133] Referring to FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, a 38th data packet (TS packet #37) of a lstslot (Slot<br>
#0) is mapped to the 1st data packet of an odd VSB field. A 38th data packet (TS<br>
packet #37) of a 2nd slot (Slot #1) is mapped to the 157th data packet of an odd VSB<br>
field. Also, a 38th data packet (TS packet #37) of a 3rd slot (Slot #2) is mapped to the<br>
lstdata packet of an even VSB field. And, a 38th data packet (TS packet #37) of a<br>
4thslot (Slot #3) is mapped to the 157th data packet of an even VSB field. Similarly,<br>
the remaining 12 slots within the corresponding sub-frame are mapped in the<br>
subsequent VSB frames using the same method.<br>
[134]<br>
[ 135] FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary assignement order of data groups being assigned to<br>
one of 5 sub-frames, wherein the 5 sub-frames configure an MH frame. For example,<br>
the method of assigning data groups may be identically applied to all MH frames or<br>
differently applied to each MH frame. Furthermore, the method of assinging data<br>
groups may be identically applied to all sub-frames or differently applied to each sub-<br>
frame. At this point, when it is assumed that the data groups are assigned using the<br>
same method in all sub-frames of the corresponding MH frame, the total number of<br>
data groups being assigned to an MH frame is equal to a multiple of '5'.<br>
[136] According to the embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of consecutive data<br>
groups is assigned to be spaced as far apart from one another as possible within the<br>
MH frame. Thus, the system can be capable of responding promptly and effectively to<br>
any burst error that may occur within a sub-frame.<br>
[137] For example, when it is assumed that 3 data groups are assigned to a sub-frame, the<br>
data groups are assigned to a 1st slot (Slot #0), a 5th slot (Slot #4), and a 9th slot (Slot<br>
#8) in the sub-frame, respectively. FIG. 8 illustrates an example of assigning 16 data<br>
groups in one sub-frame using the above-described pattern (or rule). In other words,<br>
each data group is serially assigned to 16 slots corresponding to the following<br>
numbers: 0, 8,4, 12,1,9, 5, 13, 2, 10, 6,14, 3, 11,7, and 15. Equation 1 below shows<br>
the above-described rule (or pattern) for assigning data groups in a sub-frame.<br>
[138] [Equation 1]<br>
[139] <br>
[140] Herein, j indicates the slot number within a sub-frame. The value of j may range from<br>
0 to 15 (i.e.,<br><br>
). Also, variable i indicates the data group number. The value of i may range from 0<br>
to 15 (i.e.,<br><br>
).<br>
[141] In the present invneiton, a collection of data groups included in a MH frame will be<br>
referred to as a "parade". Based upon the RS frame mode, the parade transmits data of<br>
at least one specific RS frame.<br>
[142] The mobile service data within one RS frame may be assigned either to all of regions<br>
A/B/C/D within the corresponding data group, or to at least one of regions A/B/C/D. In<br>
the embodiment of the present invention, the mobile service data within one RS frame<br>
may be assigned either to all of regions A/B/C/D, or to at least one of regions A/B and<br>
regions C/D. If the mobile service data are assigned to the latter case (i.e., one of<br>
regions A/B and regions C/D), the RS frame being assigned to regions A/B and the RS<br>
frame being assigned to regions C/D within the corresponding data group are different<br>
from one another.<br>
[143] According to the embodiment of the present invention, the RS frame being assigned<br>
to regions A/B within the corresponding data group will be referred to as a "primary<br>
RS frame", and the RS frame being assigned to regions C/D within the corresponding<br>
data group will be referred to as a "secondary RS frame", for simplicity. Also, the<br>
primary RS frame and the secondary RS frame form (or configure) one parade. More<br>
specifically, when the mobile service data within one RS frame are assigned either to<br>
all of regions A/B/C/D within the corresponding data group, one parade transmits one<br>
RS frame. Conversely, when the mobile service data within one RS frame are assigned<br>
either to at least one of regions A/B and regions C/D, one parade maytransmit up to 2<br>
RS frames. More specifically, the RS frame mode indicates whether a parade transmits<br>
one RS frame, or whether the parade transmits two RS frames. Such RS frame mode is<br>
transmitted as the above-described TPC data. Table 1 below shows an example of the<br>
RS frame mode.<br>
[144] Table 1<br>
[Table 1]<br>
[Table ]<br><br>
[145] Table 1 illustrates an example of allocating 2 bits in order to indicate the RS frame<br>
mode. For example, referring to Table 1, when the RS frame mode value is equal to<br>
'00', this indicates that one parade transmits one RS frame. And, when the RS frame<br>
mode value is equal to '01', this indicates that one parade transmits two RS frames, i.e.,<br>
the primary RS frame and the secondary RS frame.<br>
[146] More specifically, when the RS frame mode value is equal to '01', data of the primary<br>
RS frame for regions A/B are assigned and transmitted to regions A/B of the cor-<br>
responding data group. Similarly, data of the secondary RS frame for regions C/D are<br>
assigned and transmitted to regions C/D of the corresponding data group.<br>
[147] As described in the assignment of data groups, the parades are also assigned to be<br>
spaced as far apart from one another as possible within the sub-frame. Thus, the system<br>
can be capable of responding promptly and effectively to any burst error that may<br>
occur within a sub-frame. Furthermore, the method of assigning parades may be<br>
identically applied to all MH frames or differently applied to each MH frame.<br>
[148] According to the embodiment of the present invention, the parades may be assigned<br>
differently for each MH frame and identically for all sub-frames within an MH frame.<br>
More specifically, the MH frame structure may vary by MH frame units. Thus, an<br>
ensemble rate may be adjusted on a more frequent and flexible basis.<br>
[149] FIG. 9 illustrates an example of multiple data groups of a single parade being<br>
assigned (or allocated) to an MH frame. More specifically, FIG. 9 illustrates an<br>
example of a plurality of data groups included in a single parade, wherein the number<br>
of data groups included in a sub-frame is equal to '3', being allocated to an MH frame.<br>
[150] Referring to FIG. 9, 3 data groups are sequentially assigned to a sub-frame at a cycle<br>
period of 4 slots. Accordingly, when this process is equally performed in the 5 sub-<br>
frames included in the corresponding MH frame, 15data groups are assigned to a single<br>
MH frame. Herein, the 15 data groups correspond to data groups included in a parade.<br>
Therefore, since one sub-frame is configured of 4 VSB frame, and since 3 data groups<br>
are included in a sub-frame, the data group of the corresponding parade is not assigned<br>
to one of the 4 VSB frames within asub-frame.<br>
[151] For example,when it is assumed that one parade transmits one RS frame, and that a<br>
RS frame encoder (not shown) included in the transmitting system performs RS-<br>
encoding on the corresponding RS frame, thereby adding 24 bytes of parity data to the<br>
corresponding RS frame and transmitting the processed RS frame, the parity data<br>
occupy approximately 11.37% (=24/(187+24)x100) of the total code word length.<br>
Meanwhile, when one sub-frame includes 3 data groups, and when the data groups<br>
included in the parade are assigned, as shown in FIG. 9, a total of 15 data groups form<br>
an RS frame. Accordingly, even when an error occurs in an entire data group due to a<br>
burst noise within a channel, the percentile is merely 6.67% (=1/15x100). Therefore,<br>
the receiving system may correct all errors by performing an erasure RS decoding<br>
process. More specifically, when the erasure RS decoding is performed, a number of<br>
channel errors corresponding to the number of RS parity bytes may be corrected. By<br>
doing so, the receiving system may correct the error of at least one data group within<br>
one parade. Thus, the minimum burst noise length correctable by a RS frame is over 1<br>
VSB frame.<br>
[152] Meanwhile, when data groups of a parade are assigned as shown in FIG. 9, either<br>
main service data may be assigned between each data group, or data groups cor-<br>
responding to different parades may be assigned between each data group. More<br>
specifically, data groups corresponding to multiple parades may be assigned to one<br>
MH frame.<br>
[153] Basically, the method of assigning data groups corresponding to multiple paradesis<br>
very similar to the method of assigning data groups corresponding to a single parade.<br>
In other words, data groups included in other parades that are to be assigned to an MH<br>
frame are also respectively assigned according to a cycle period of 4 slots.<br>
[154] At this point, data groups of a different parademay be sequentially assigned to the<br>
respective slots in a circular method. Herein, the data groups are assigned to slots<br>
starting from the ones to which data groups of the previous parade have not yet been<br>
assigned.<br>
[155] For example, when it is assumed that data groups corresponding to a parade are<br>
assigned as shown in FIG. 9, data groups corresponding to the next parade may be<br>
assigned to a sub-frame starting either from the 12th slot of a sub-frame.However, this<br>
is merely exemplary. In another example, the data groups of the next parade may also<br>
be sequentially assigned to a different slot within a sub-frame at a cycle period of 4<br>
slots starting from the 3rd slot.<br>
[156] FIG. 10 illustrates an example of transmitting 3 parades (Parade #0, Parade #1, and<br>
Parade #2) to an MH frame. More specifically, FIG. 10 illustrates an example of<br>
transmitting parades included in one of 5 sub-frames, wherein the 5 sub-frames<br>
configure one MH frame.<br>
[157] When the 1st parade (Parade #0) includes 3 data groups for each sub-frame, the<br>
positions of each data groups within the sub-frames may be obtained by substituting<br>
values '0' to '2' for iin Equation 1. More specifically, the data groups of the 1st parade<br>
(Parade #0) are sequentially assigned to the 1st, 5th, and 9thslots (Slot #0, Slot #4, and<br>
Slot #8) within the sub-frame.<br>
[158] Also, when the 2nd parade includes 2 data groups for each sub-frame, the positions<br>
of each data groups within the sub-frames may be obtained by substituting values '3'<br>
and '4' for iin Equation 1. More specifically, the data groups of the 2nd parade (Parade<br>
#1) are sequentially assigned to the 2nd and 12thslots (Slot #3 and Slot #11) within the<br>
sub-frame.<br>
[159] Finally, when the 3rd parade includes 2 data groups for each sub-frame, the positions<br>
of each data groups within the sub-frames may be obtained by substituting values '5'<br>
and '6' for iin Equation 1. More specifically, the data groups of the 3rd parade (Parade<br>
#2) are sequentially assigned to the 7th and 1 lthslots (Slot #6 and Slot #10) within the<br>
sub-frame.<br>
[160] As described above, data groups of multiple parades may be assigned to a single MH<br>
frame, and, in each sub-frame, the data groups are serially allocated to a group space<br>
having 4 slots from left to right.<br>
[161] Therefore, a number of groups of one parade per sub-frame (NoG) may correspond<br>
to any one integer from '1' to '8'. Herein, since one MH frame includes 5 sub-frames,<br>
the total number of data groups within a paradethat can be allocated to an MH frame<br>
may correspond to any one multiple of '5' ranging from '5' to '40'.<br>
[162] FIG. 11 illustrates an example of expanding the assignment process of 3 parades,<br>
shown in FIG. 10, to 5 sub-frames within an MH frame.<br>
[163] FIG. 12 illustrates a data transmission structure according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, wherein signaling data are included in a data group so as to be<br>
transmitted.<br>
[164] As described above, an MH frame is divided into 5 sub-frames. Data groups cor-<br>
responding to a plurality of parades co-exist in each sub-frame. Herein, the data groups<br>
corresponding to each parade are grouped by MH fram units, thereby configuring a<br>
single parade. The data structure shown in FIG. 12 includes 3 parades, one ESG<br>
dedicated channel (EDC) parade (i.e., parade with NoG=1), and 2 service parades (i.e.,<br>
parade with NoG=4 and parade with NoG=3). Also, a predetermined portion of each<br>
data group (i.e., 37 bytes/data group) is used for delivering (or sending) FIC in-<br>
formation associated with mobile service data, wherein the FIC information is<br>
separately encoded from the RS-encoding process. The FIC region assigned to<br>
eachdata group consists of one FIC segments. Herein, each segment is interleaved by<br>
MH sub-frame units, thereby configuring an FIC body, which corresponds to a<br>
completed FIC transmission structure. However, whenever required, each segment<br>
may be interleaved by MH frame units and not by MH sub-frame units, thereby being<br>
completed in MH frame units.<br>
[165] Meanwhile, the concept of an MH ensemble is applied in the embodiment of the<br>
present invention, thereby defining a collection (or group) of services. Each MH<br>
ensemble carries the same QoS and is coded with the same FEC code. Also, each MH<br>
ensemble has the same unique identifier (i.e., ensemble ID) and corresponds to con-<br>
secutiveRS frames.<br>
[166] As shown in FIG. 12, the FIC segment corresponding to each data group described<br>
service information of an MH ensemble to which the corresponding data group<br>
belongs. When FIC segments within a sub-frame are grouped and deinterleved, all<br>
service information of a physical channel through which the corresponding FICs are<br>
transmitted may be obtained. Therefore, the receiving system may be able to acquire<br>
the channel information of the corresponding physical channel, after being processed<br>
with physical channel tuning, during a sub-frame period.<br>
[167] Furthermore, FIG. 12 illustrates a structure further including a separate EDC parade<br>
apart from the service parade and wherein electronic service guide (ESG) data are<br>
transmitted in the 1st slot of each sub-frame.<br>
[168] If the digital broadcasting reception system recognizes a frame start point or a frame<br>
end point of the MH frame (or the MH subframe), then the digital broadcasting<br>
reception system can set the reference time information to the system time clock at the<br>
frame start point or the frame end point. The reference time information can be the<br>
network time protocol (NTP) timestamp. The detailed description for the reference<br>
time information will be disclosed by being referred to FIGs. 25 to 29.<br>
[169]<br>
[170] Hierarchical Signaling Structure<br>
[171] FIG. 13 illustrates a hierarchical signaling structure according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. As shown in FIG. 13, the mobile broadcasting techonology<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention adopts a signaling method using<br>
FIC and SMT. In the description of the present invention, the signaling structure will<br>
be referred to as a hierarchical signaling structure.<br>
[172] Hereinafter, a detailed description on how the receiving system accesses a virtual<br>
channel via FIC and SMT will now be given with reference to FIG. 13.<br>
[173] The FIC body defined in an MH transport (Ml) identifies the physical location of<br>
each the data stream for each virtual channel and provides very high level descriptions<br>
of each virtual channel.<br>
[174] Being MH ensemble level signaling information, the service map table (SMT)<br>
provides MH ensemble level signaling information. The SMT provides the IP access<br>
information of each virtual channel belonging to the respective MH ensemble within<br>
which the SMT is carried. The SMT also provides all IP stream component level in-<br>
formation required for the virtual channel service acquisition.<br>
[175] Referring to FIG. 13, each MH ensemble (i.e., Ensemble 0, Ensemble 1,...,<br>
Ensemble K) includes a stream information on each associated (or corresponding)<br>
virtual channel (e.g., virtual channel 0 IP stream, virtual channel 1 IP stream, and<br>
virtual channel 2 IP stream). For example, Ensemble 0 includes virtual channel 0 IP<br>
stream and virtual channel 1 IP stream. And, each MH ensemble includes diverse in-<br>
formation on the associated virtual channel (i.e., Virtual Channel 0 Table Entry,<br>
Virtual Channel 0 Access Info, Virtual Channel 1 Table Entry, Virtual Channel 1<br>
Access Info, Virtual Channel 2 Table Entry, Virtual Channel 2 Access Info, Virtual<br>
Channel N Table Entry, Virtual Channel N Access Info, and so on).<br>
[176] The FIC body payload includes information on MH ensembles (e.g., ensemble_id<br>
field, and referred to as "ensemble location" in FIG. 13) and information on a virtual<br>
channel associated with the corresponding MH ensemble (e.g., when such information<br>
correspondsto a major_channel_num field and a minor_channel_num field, the in-<br>
formation is expressed as Virtual Channel 0, Virtual Channel 1,..., Virtual Channel N<br>
in FIG. 13).<br>
[177] The application of the signaling structurein the receiving system will now be<br>
described in detail.<br>
[178]<br>
[179] When a user selects a channel he or she wishes to view (hereinafter, the user-selected<br>
channel will be referred to as "channel 0"for simplicity), the receiving system first<br>
parses the received FIC. Then, the receiving system acquires information on an MH<br>
ensemble (i.e., ensemble location), which is associated with the virtual channel cor-<br>
responding to channel 0 (hereinafter, the corresponding MH ensemble will be referred<br>
to as "MH ensemble 0" for simplicity). By acquiring slots only correspondingto the<br>
MH ensemble 0 using the time-slicing method, the receiving system configures<br>
ensemble 0. The ensemble 0 configured as described above, includes an SMT on the<br>
associated virtual channels (including channel 0) and IP streams on the corresponding<br>
virtual channels. Therefore, the receiving system uses the SMT included in the MH<br>
ensemble 0 in order to acquire various information on channel 0 (e.g., Virtual<br>
Channel 0 Table Entry) and stream access information on channel 0 (e.g., Virtual<br>
Channel 0 Access Info). The receiving system uses the stream access information on<br>
channel 0 to receive only the associated IP streams, thereby providing channel 0<br>
services to the user.<br>
[180]<br>
[181] Fast Information Channel (FIC)<br>
[182] The digital broadcast receiving system according to the present invention adopts the<br>
fast information channel (FIC) for a faster access to a service that is currently being<br>
broadcasted.<br>
[183] More specifically, the FIC handler215 of FIG. 1 parses the FIC body, wh ich<br>
corresponds to an FIC transmission structure, and outputs the parsed result to the<br>
physical adaptation control signal handler 216.<br>
[184] FIG. 14 illustrates an exemplary FIC body format according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. According to the embodiment of the present invention, the FIC<br>
format consists of an FIC body header and an FIC body payload.<br>
[185] Meanwhile, according to the embodiment of the present invention, data are<br>
transmitted through the FIC body header and the FIC body payload in FIC segment<br>
units. Each FIC segment has the size of 37 bytes, and each FIC segment consists of a<br>
2-byte FIC segment header and a 35-byte FIC segment payload. More specifically, an<br>
FIC body configured of an FIC body header and an FIC body payload, is segmented in<br>
units of 35 data bytes, which are then carried in at least one FIC segment within the<br>
FIC segment payload, so as to be transmitted.<br>
[186] In the description of the present invention, an example of inserting one FIC segment<br>
in one data group, which is then transmitted, will be given. In this case, the receiving<br>
system receives a slot corresponding to each data group by using a time-slicing<br>
method.<br>
[187] The signaling decoder 190 includedin the receiving system shown in FIG. 1 collects<br>
each FIC segment inserted in each data group. Then, the signaling decoder 190 uses<br>
the collected FIC segments to created a single FIC body. Thereafter, the signaling<br>
decoder 190 performs a decoding process on the FTC body payload of the created FIC<br>
body, so that the decoded FIC body payload correspondsto an encoded result of a s<br>
ignaling encoder (not shown) included in the transmitting system. Subsequently, the<br>
decoded FIC body payload is outputted to theFIC handler 215. The FIC handler 215<br>
parses the FIC data included in the FIC body payload, and then outputs the parsed FIC<br>
data to the physical adaptation control signal handler 216. The physical adaptation<br>
control signal handler 216 uses the inputted FTC data to perform processes associated<br>
with MH ensembles, virtual channels, SMTs, and so on.<br>
[188] According to an embodiment of the present invention, when an FTC body is<br>
segmented, and when the size of the last segmented portion is smaller than 35 data<br>
bytes, it is assumed that the lacking number of data bytes in the FIC segment payload<br>
is completed with by adding the same number of stuffing bytes therein, so that the size<br>
of the last FIC segment can be equal to 35 data bytes.<br>
[189] However, it is apparent that the above-described data byte values (i.e., 37 bytes for<br>
the FTC segment, 2 bytes for the FIC segment header, and 35 bytes for the FIC segment<br>
payload) are merely exemplary, and will, therefore, not limit the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[190]<br>
[191] FIG. 15 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure with respect to an FTC<br>
segment according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[192] Herein, the FIC segment signifies a unit used for transmitting the FIC data. The FTC<br>
segment consists of an FTC segment header and an FIC segment payload. Referring to<br>
FIG. 15, the FIC segment payload corresponds to the portion starting from the 'for'loop<br>
statement. Meanwhile, the FIC segment header may include a FIC_type field, an<br>
error_indicator field, an FIC_seg_number field, and an FIC_last_seg_numberfield. A<br>
detailed description of each field will now be given.<br>
[193] The FIC_type field is a 2-bit field indicating the type of the corresponding FTC.<br>
[ 194] The error_indicator field is a 1 -bit field, which indicates whether or not an error has<br>
occurred within the FIC segment during data transmission. If an error has occurred, the<br>
value of the error_indicator field is set to '1'. More specifically, when an error that has<br>
failed to be recovered still remains during the configuration process of the FTC<br>
segment, the error_indicator field value is set to '1'. The errorjndicator field enables<br>
the receiving system to recognize the presence of an error within the FTC data.<br>
[195] The FIC_seg_number field is a 4-bit field. Herein, when a single FIC body is divided<br>
into a plurality of FIC segments and transmitted, the FIC_seg_number field indicates<br>
the number of the corresponding FIC segment<br>
[196] Finally, the FIC_last_seg_numberfield is also a 4-bit field. The<br>
FIC_last_seg_number field indicates the'number of the last FTC segment within the<br>
corresponding FIC body.<br>
[197] FIG. 16 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure with respect to a payload<br>
of an FIC segment according to the present invention, when an FIC type field value is<br>
equal to '0'.<br>
[198] According to the embodiment of the present invention, the payload of the FTC<br>
segment is divided into 3 different regions. A first region of the FIC segment payload<br>
exists only when the FIC_seg_number field value is equal to '0'. Herein, the first region<br>
may include a current_next_indicator field, an ESG_version field, and a<br>
transport_stream_id field. However, depending upon the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, it may be assumed that each of the 3 fields exists regardless of the<br>
FIC_seg_number field.<br>
[199] The current_next_indicator field is a 1-bit field. The current_next_indicator field acts<br>
as an indicator identifying whether the corresponding FIC data carry MH ensemble<br>
configuration information of an MH frame including the current FIC segment, or<br>
whether the corresponding FIC data carry MH ensemble configuration information of a<br>
next MH frame.<br>
[200] The ESG_version field is a 5-bit field indicating ESG version information. Herein,<br>
by providing version information on the service guide providing channel of the cor-<br>
responding ESG, the ESG_version field enables the receiving system to notify whether<br>
or not the corresponding ESG has been updated.<br>
[201] Finally, the transport_stream_id field is a 16-bit field acting as a unique identifier of<br>
a broadcast stream through which the corresponding FIC segment is being transmitted.<br>
[202] A second region of the FIC segment payload corresponds to an ensemble loop<br>
region, which includes an ensemble jd field, an SLversion field, and a num_channel<br>
field.<br>
[203] More specifically, the ensemble_id field is an 8-bit field indicating identifiers of an<br>
MH ensemble through which MH services are transmitted. The MH services will be<br>
described in more detail in a later process. Herein, the ensemble_id field binds the MH<br>
services and the MH ensemble.<br>
[204] The SI_version field is a 4-bit field indicating version information of SI data<br>
included in the corresponding ensemble, which is being transmitted within the RS<br>
frame.<br>
[205] Finally, the num_channel field is an 8-bit field indicating the number of virtual<br>
channel being transmitted via the corresponding ensemble.<br>
[206] A third region of the FIC segment payload a channel loop region, which includes a<br>
channel_type field, a channel_activity field, a CA_indicator field, a<br>
stand_alone_service_indicator field, a major_channel_num field, and a<br>
minor_channel_num field.<br>
[207] The channel_type field is a 5-bit field indicating a service type of the corresponding<br>
virtual channel. For example, the channel_type field may indicates an audio/video<br>
channel, an audio/video and data channel, an audio-only channel, a data-only channel,<br>
a file download channel, an ESG delivery channel, a notification channel, and so on.<br>
[208] The channel_activity field is a 2-bit field indicating activity information of the cor-<br>
responding virtual channel. More specifically, the channel_activity field may indicate<br>
whether the current virtual channel is providing the current service.<br>
[209] The CA_indicator field is a 1-bit field indicating whether or not a conditional access<br>
(CA) is applied to the current virtual channel.<br>
[210] The stand_alone_service_indicator field is also a 1-bit field, which indicates whether<br>
the service of the corresponding virtual channel corresponds to a stand alone service.<br>
[211] The major_channel_num field is an 8-bit field indicating a major channel number of<br>
the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[212] Finally, the minor_channel_num field is also an 8-bit field indicating a minor<br>
channel number of the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[213]<br>
[214] Service Table Map<br>
[215] FIG. 17 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of a service map table<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "SMT") according to the present invention.<br>
[216] According to the embodiment of the present invention, the SMT is configured in an<br>
MPEG-2 private section format. However, this will not limit the scope and spirit of the<br>
present invention. The SMT according to the embodiment of the present invention<br>
includes desription information for each virtual channel within a single MH ensemble.<br>
And, additional information may further be included in each descriptor area.<br>
[217] Herein, the SMT according to the embodiment of the present invention includes at<br>
least one field and is transmitted from the transmitting system to the receiving system.<br>
[218] As described in FIG. 3, the SMT section may be transmitted by being included in the<br>
MH TP within the RS frame. In this case, each of the RS frame decoders 170 and 180,<br>
shown in FIG. 1, decodes the inputted RS frame, respectively. Then, each of the<br>
decoded RS frames is outputted to the respective RS frame handler 211 and 212.<br>
Thereafter, each RS frame handler 211 and 212 identifies the inputted RS frame by<br>
row units, so as to create an MH TP, thereby outputting the created MH TP to the MH<br>
TP handler 213. When it is determined that the corresponding MH TP includes an<br>
SMT section based upon the header in each of the inputted MH TP, the MH TP<br>
handler 213 parses the corresponding SMT section, so as to output the SI data within<br>
the parsed SMT section to the physical adaptation control signal handler 216.<br>
However, this is limited to when the SMT is not encapsulated to IP datagrams.<br>
[219] Meanwhile, when the SMT is not encapsulated to IP datagrams, and when it is<br>
determined that the corresponding MH TP includes an SMT section based upon the<br>
header in each of the inputted MH TP, theMH TP handler 213 outputs the SMT section<br>
to the IP network stack 220. Accordingly, the IP network stack 220 performs IP and<br>
UDP processes on the inputted SMT section and, then, outputs the processed SMT<br>
section to the SI handler 240. The SI handler 240 parses the inputted SMT section and<br>
controls the system so that the parsed SI data can be stroed in the storage unit 290.<br>
[220] The following corresponds to exampleof the fields that may be transmitted through<br>
the SMT.<br>
[221] The table_id field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer number, which indicates<br>
the type of table section. The table_id field allows the corresponding table to be<br>
defined as the service map table (SMT).<br>
[222] The ensemble_id field is an 8-bit unsigned integer field, which corresponds to an ID<br>
value associated to the corresponding MH ensemble. Herein, the ensemble_id field<br>
may be assigned with a value ranging from range '0x00' to '0x3F. It is preferable that<br>
the value of the ensemble_id field is derived from the parade_id of the TPC data,<br>
which is carried from the baseband processor of MH physical layer subsystem. When<br>
the corresponding MH ensemble is transmitted through (or carried over) the primary<br>
RS frame, a value of '0' may be used for the most significant bit (MSB), and the<br>
remaining 7 bits are used as the parade_id value of the associated MH parade (i.e., for<br>
the least significant 7 bits). Alternatively, when the corresponding MH ensemble is<br>
transmitted through (or carried over) the secondary RS frame, a value of T may be<br>
used for the most significant bit (MSB).<br>
[223] The num_channels field is an 8-bit field, which specifies the number of virtual<br>
channels in the corresponding SMT section.<br>
[224] Meanwhile, the SMT according to the embodimentof the present invention provides<br>
information on a plurality of virtual channels using the 'for' loop statement.<br>
[225] The major_channel_num field corresponds to an 8-bit field, which represents the<br>
major channel number associated with the corresponding virtual channel. Herein, the<br>
major_channel_num field may be assigned with a value ranging from '0x00' to 'OxFF.<br>
[226] The minor_channel_num field corresponds to an 8-bit field, which represents the<br>
minor channel number associated with the corresponding virtual channel. Herein, the<br>
minor_channel__num field may beassigned with a value ranging from '0x00' to 'OxFF'.<br>
[227] The short_channel_name field indicates the short name of the virtual channel.<br>
[228] The service_id field is a 16-bit unsigned integer number (or value), which identifies<br>
the virtual channel service.<br>
[229] The service_type field is a 6-bit enumerated type field, which designates the type of<br>
service carried in the corresponding virtual channel as defined in Table 2 below.<br>
[230] Table 2<br><br>
[231] The virtual_channel_activity field is a 2-bit enumerated field identifying the activity<br>
status of the corresponding virtual channel. When the most significant bit (MSB) of the<br>
virtual_channel_activity field is '1', the virtual channel is active, and when the most<br>
significant bit (MSB) of the virtual_channel_activity field is '0', the virtual channel is<br>
inactive. Also, when the least significant bit (LSB) of the viitual_channel_activity field<br>
is '1', the virtual channel is hidden (when set to 1), and when the least significant bit<br>
(LSB) of the virtual_channel_activity field is '0', the virtual channel is not hidden.<br>
[232] The num_components field is a 5-bit field, which specifies the number of IP stream<br>
components in the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[233] The IP_version_flag field corresponds to a 1-bit indicator. More specifically, when<br>
the value of the IP_version_flag field is set to T, this indicates that a<br>
source_IP_address field, a virtual_channel_target_IP_address field, and a<br>
component_target_IP_address field are IPv6 addresses. Alternatively, when the value<br>
of the EP_version_flag field is set to '0', this indicates that the source_IP_address field,<br>
the virtual_channel_target_rP_address field, and the component_target_IP_address<br>
field are IPv4.<br>
[234] The source_IP_address_flag field is a 1-bit Boolean flag, which indicates, when set,<br>
that a source IP address of the corresponding virtual channel exist for a specific<br>
multicast source.<br>
[235] The virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field is a 1-bit Boolean flag, which<br>
indicates, when set, that the corresponding IP stream component is delivered through<br>
IP datagrams with target IP addresses different from the<br>
virtual_channel_target_IP_address. Therefore, when the flag is set, the receiving<br>
system (or receiver) uses the componenLtarget_IP_address as the target_IP_address in<br>
order to access the corresponding IP stream component. Accordingly, the receiving<br>
system (or receiver) may ignore the virtual_channel_target__IP_address field included<br>
in the num_channels loop.<br>
[236] The source_IP_address field corresponds to a 32-bit or 128-bit field. Herein,the<br>
source_IP_address field will be significant (or present), when the value of the<br>
source_IP_address_flag field is set to '1'. However, when the value of the<br>
source_IP_address_flag field is set to '0', the source_IP_address field will become in-<br>
significant (or absent). More specifically, when the source_IP_address_flag field value<br>
is set to T, and when the IP_version_flag field value is set to '0', the<br>
source_IP_address field indicates a 32-bit IPv4 address, which shows the source of the<br>
corresponding virtual channel. Alternatively, when the IP_version_flag field value is<br>
set to '1', the source_IP_address field indicates a 128-bit IPv6 address, which shows the<br>
source of the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[237] The virtual_channel_target_IP_address field also corresponds to a 32-bit or 128-bit<br>
field. Herein, the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field will be significant (or<br>
present), when the value of the virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field is set to<br>
'1'. However, when the value of the virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field is set<br>
to '0', the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field will become insignificant (or<br>
absent). More specifically, when the virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field<br>
value is set to '1', and when the IP_version_flag field value is set to '0', the<br>
virtual_channel_target_IP_address field indicates a 32-bit target IPv4 address<br>
associated to the corresponding virtual channel. Alternatively, when the<br>
virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field value is set to T, and when the<br>
IP_version_flag field value is set to T, the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field<br>
indicates a 64-bit target IPv6 address associated to the correspondingvirtual channel. If<br>
the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field is insignificant (or absent), the<br>
component_target_IP_address field within the num_channels loop should become<br>
significant (or present). And, in order to enable the receiving system to access the IP<br>
stream component, the component_target_IP_address field should be used.<br>
[238] Meanwhile, the SMT according to the embodiment of the present invention uses a<br>
'for'loop statement in order to provide information on a plurality of components.<br>
[239] Herein, the RTP_payload_type field, which is assigned with 7 bits, identifies the<br>
encoding format of the component based upon Table 3 shown below. When the IP<br>
stream component is not encapsulated to RTP, the RTP_payload_type field shall be<br>
ignored (or deprecated).<br>
[240] Table 3 below shows an example of an RTP payload type.<br>
[241] Table 3<br><br>
[242]<br>
[243] The component_target_IP_address_flag field is a 1-bit Boolean flag, which indicates,<br>
when set, that the corresponding IP stream component is delivered through IP<br>
datagrams with target IP addresses different from the<br>
virrual_channel_target_IP_address. Furthermore, when the<br>
component_target_IP_address_flag is set, the receivingsystem (or receiver) uses the<br>
component_target_IP_address field as the target IP address for accessind the cor-<br>
responding IP stream component. Accordingly, the receiving system (or receiver) will<br>
ignore the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field included in the num_channels loop.<br>
[244] The component_target_IP_address field corresponds to a 32-bit or 128-bit field.<br>
Herein, when the value of the IP_version_flag field is set to '0', the<br>
component_target_IP_address field indicates a 32-bit target IPv4 address associated to<br>
the corresponding IP stream component. And, when the value of the IP_version_flag<br>
field is set to '1', the component_target_IP_address field indicates a 128-bit target IPv6<br>
address associated to the correspondinglP stream component.<br>
[245] The port_num_count field is a 6-bit field, which indicates the number of UDP ports<br>
associated with the corresponding IP stream component. A target UDP port number<br>
value starts from the target_UDP_port_num field value and increases (or is in-<br>
cremented) by 1. For the RTP stream, the target UDP port number should start from<br>
the target_UDP_port_num field value and shall increase (or be incremented) by 2. This<br>
is to incorporate RTCP streams associated with the RTP streams.<br>
[246] The target_UDP_port_num field is a 16-bit unsigned integer field, which represents<br>
the target UDP port number for the corresponding IP stream component. When used<br>
for RTP streams, the value of the target_UDP_port_num field shall correspond to an<br>
even number. And, the next higher value shall represent the target UDP port number of<br>
the associated RTCP stream.<br>
[247] The component_level_descriptor() represents zero or more descriptors providing<br>
additional information on the corresponding IP stream component<br>
[248] The virtual_channel_level_descriptor() represents zero or more descriptors providing<br>
additional information for the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[249] Theensemble_level_descriptor() represents zero or more descriptors providing<br>
additional information for the MH ensemble, which is described by the corresponding<br>
SMT.<br>

[251] FIG. 18 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH audio<br>
descriptor according to the present invention. When at least one audio service is<br>
present as a component of the current event, the MH_audio_descriptor() shall be used<br>
as a component_level_descriptor of the SMT. The MH_audio_descriptor() may be<br>
capable of informing the system of the audio languagetype and stereo mode status. If<br>
there is no audio service associated with the current event, then it is preferable that the<br>
MH_audio_descriptor() is considered to be insignificant (or absent) for the current<br>
event. Each field shown in the bit stream syntax of FIG. 18 will now be described in<br>
detail.<br>

the MH_audio_descriptor(). The channel_configurarion field corresponds to an 8-bit<br>
field indicating the number and configuration of audio channels. The values ranging<br>
from '1' to '6' respectively indicate the the number and configuration of audio channels<br>
as given for "Default bit stream index number" in Table 42 of ISO/IEC 13818-7:2006.<br>
All other values indicate that the number and configuration of audio channels are<br>
undefined.<br>
[253] The sample_rate_code field is a 3-bit field, which indicates the sample rate of the<br>
encoded audio data. Herein, the indication may correspondto one specific sample rate,<br>
or may correspond to a set of values that include the sample rate of the encoded audio<br>
data as defined in Table A3.3 of ATSC A/52B. The bit_rate_code field corresponds to<br>
a 6-bit field. Herein, among the 6 bits, the lower 5 bits indicate a nominal bit rate.<br>
More specifically, when the most significant bit (MSB) is '0', the corresponding bit rate<br>
is exact On the other hand, when the most significant bit (MSB) is '0', the bit rate<br>
corresponds to an upper limitas defined in Table A3.4 of ATSC A/53B. The<br>
ISO_639_language_code field is a 24-bit (i.e., 3-byte) field indicating the language<br>
used for the audio stream component, in conformance with ISO 639.2/B [x]. When a<br>
specific language is not present in the corresponding audio stream component, the<br>
value of each byte will be set to '0x00'.<br>

MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor() exists only when the dynamic value of the<br>
RTP_payload_type field within the num_components loop of the SMT is in the range<br>
of 96' to '127'. The MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor() is used as a<br>
component_level_descriptor of the SMT.<br>
[256] The MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor translates (or matches) a dynamic<br>
RTP_payload_type field value into (or with) a MIME type. Accordingly, the receiving<br>
system (or receiver) may collect (or gather) the encoding format of the IP stream<br>
component which is encapsulated in RTP.<br>
[257] The fields included in the MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor() will now be<br>
described in detail.<br>

indicates the length (in bytes) of the portion immediately following the<br>
descriptorjength field up to the end of the MH_current_event_descriptor().<br>
[268] The current_event_start_time field corresponds to a 32-bit unsigned integer quantity.<br>
The current_event_start_time field represents the start time of the current event and,<br>
more specifically, as the number of GPS seconds since 00:00:00UTC, January 6,1980.<br>
[269] The current_event_duration field corresponds to a 24-bit field. Herein, the<br>
current_event_duration field indicates the duration of the current event in hours, min<br>
utes, and seconds (wherein the format is in 6 digits, 4-bit BCD = 24 bits).<br>
[270] The title Jength field specifies the length (in bytes) of the title_text field. Herein, the<br>
value '0' indicates that there are no titles existing for the corresponding event<br>
[271] The title_text field indicates the title of the corresponding event in event title in the<br>
format of a multiple string structure as defined in ATSC A/65C [x].<br>
[272]<br>
[273] FIG. 21 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH next event<br>
descriptor according to the present invention.<br>
[274] The optional MH_next_event_descriptor() shall be used as the<br>
virtual_channel_level_descriptorO within the SMT. Herein, the<br>
MH_next_event_descriptorO provides basic information on the next event (e.g., the<br>
start time, duration, and title of the next event, etc.), which is transmitted via the<br>
respective virtual channel. The fields included in the<br>
[275] MH_next_evenc_descriptor() will now be described in detail.<br>
[276] The descriptor_tag field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer having the value<br>
TBD, which identifies the current descriptor as the MH_next_event_descriptor().<br>
[277] The descriptorjength field also corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer, which<br>
indicates the length (in bytes) of the portion immediately following the<br>
descriptorjength field up to the end of the MH_next_event_descriptor().<br>
[278] The next_event_start_time field corresponds to a 32-bit unsigned integer quantity.<br>
The next_event_start_time field represents the start time of the next event and, more<br>
specifically, as the number of GPS seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 6, 1980.<br>
[279] The next_event_duration field corresponds to a 24-bit field. Herein, the<br>
next_event_duration field indicates the duration of the next event in hours, minutes,<br>
and seconds (wherein the format is in 6 digits, 4-bit BCD = 24 bits).<br>
[280] The titlejength field specifies the length (in bytes) of the title_text field. Herein, the<br>
value '0' indicates that there are no tides existing for the corresponding event.<br>
[281] The title_text field indicates the title of the corresponding event in event title in the<br>
format of a multiple string structure as defined in ATSC A/65C [x].<br>
[282]<br>
[283] FIG. 22 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH system time<br>
descriptor according to the present invention.<br>
[284] The MH_system_time_descriptor() shall be used as the ensembleJeveLdescriptor()<br>
within the SMT. Herein, the MH_system_time_descriptor() provides information on<br>
current time and date.<br>
[285] The MFLsystem_time_descriptor() also provides information on the time zone in<br>
which the transmitting system (or transmitter) transmitting the corresponding broadcast<br>
stream is located, while taking into consideration the mobile/portable characterstics of<br>
the MH service data. The fields included in the MH_system_time_descriptor() will<br>
now be described in detail.<br>
[286] The descriptorjag field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer having the value<br>
TBD, which identifies the current descriptor as the MH_system_time_descriptor().<br>
[287] The descriptorjength field also corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer, which<br>
indicates the length (in bytes) of the portion immediately following the<br>

[288] The system_time field corresponds to a 32-bit unsigned integer quantity. The<br>
system_time field represents the current system time and, more specifically, as the<br>
number of GPS seconds since 00:00:00UTC, January 6, 1980.<br>
[289] The GPS_UTC_offset field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer, which defines<br>
the current offset in whole seconds between GPS and UTC time standards. In order to<br>
convert GPS time to UTC time, the GPS_UTC_offset is subtracted from GPS time.<br>
Whenever the International Bureau of Weights and Measures decides that the current<br>
offset is too far in error, an additional leap second may be added (or subtracted). Ac-<br>
cordingly, the GPS_UTC_offset field value will reflect the change.<br>
[290] The time_zone_offset_polarity field is a 1-bit field, which indicates whether the time<br>
of the time zone, in which the broadcast station is located, exceeds (or leads or is<br>
faster) or falls behind (or lags or is slower) than the UTC time. When the value of the<br>
time_zone_offset_polarity field is equal to '0', this indicates that the time on the current<br>
time zone exceeds the UTC time. Therefore, the time_zone_offset_polarity field value<br>
is added to the UTC time value. Conversely, when the value of the<br>
time_zone_offset_polarity field is equal to '1', this indicates thatthe time on the current<br>
time zone falls behind the UTC time. Therefore, the time_zone_offset_polarity field<br>
value is subtracted from the UTC time value.<br>
[291 ] The time_zone_offset field is a 31 -bit unsigned integer quantity. More specifically,<br>
the time_zone_offset field represents, in GPS seconds, the time offset of the time zone<br>

(5x8)-bit field indicating the time zone, in which the transmitting system (or<br>
transmitter) transmitting the corresponding broadcast stream is located.<br>
[293] FIG. 23 illustrates segmentation and encapsulationprocesses of a service map table<br>
(SMT) according to the present invention.<br>
[294] According to the present invention, the SMT is encapsulated to UDP, while including<br>
a target IP address and a target UDP port number within the IP datagram.<br>
[295] More specifically, the SMT is first segmented into a predetermined number of<br>
sections, then encapsulated to a UDP header, and finally encapsulated to an IP header.<br>
In addition, the SMT section provides signaling informationon all virtual channel<br>
included in the MH ensemble including the corresponding SMT section. At least one<br>
SMT section describing the MH ensemble is included in each RS frame included in the<br>
corresponding MH ensemble. Finally, each SMT section is identified by an<br>
ensemble_id included in each section. According to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, by informing the receiving system of the target IP address and target UDP<br>
port number, the corresponding data (i.e., target IP address and target UDP port<br>
number) may be parsed without having the receiving system to request for other<br>
additional information.<br>
[296]<br>
[297] FIG. 24 illustrates a flow chart for accessing a virtual channel using FTC and SMT<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
[298] More specifically, a physical channel is tuned (S501). And, when iris determined that<br>
an MH signal exists in the tuned physical channel (S502), the corresponding MH<br>
signal is demodulated (S503). Additionally, FIC segments are grouped from the de-<br>
modulated MH signal in sub-frame units (S504 and S505).<br>
[299] According to the embodiment of the present invention, an FIC segment is inserted in<br>
a data group, so as to be transmitted. More specifically, the FIC segment corresponding<br>
to each data group described service information on the MH ensemble to which the<br>
corresponding data group belongs. When the FIC segments are grouped in sub-frame<br>
units and, then, deinterleaved, all service information on the physical channel through<br>
which the corresponding FIC segment is transmitted may be acquired. Therefore, after<br>
the tuning process, the receiving system may acquire channel information on the cor-<br>
responding physical channel during a sub-frame period. Once the FIC segments are<br>
grouped, in S504 and S505, a broadcast stream through which the corresponding FIC<br>
segment is being transmitted is identified (S506). For example, the broadcast stream<br>
may be identified by parsing the transport_stream_id field of the FIC body, which is<br>
configured by grouping the FIC segments.<br>
[300] Furthermore, an ensemble identifier, a major channel number, a minor channel<br>
number, channel type information, and so on, are extracted from the FIC body (S507).<br>
And, by using the extracted ensemble information, only the slots corresponding to the<br>
designated ensemble are acquired by using the time-slicing method, so as to configure<br>
an ensemble (S508).<br>
[301] Subsequently, the RS frame corresponding to the designated ensemble is decoded<br>
(S509), and an IP socket is opened for SMT reception (S510).<br>
[302] According to the example given in the embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
SMT is encapsulated to UDP, while including a target IP address and a target UDP<br>
port number within the IP datagram. More specifically, the SMT is first segmented into<br>
a predetermined number of sections, then encapsulated to a UDP header, and finally<br>
encapsulated to an IP header. According to the embodiment of the present invention,<br>
by informing the receiving system of the target IP address and target UDP port<br>
number, the receiving system parses the SMT sections and the descriptors of each<br>
SMT section without requesting for other additional information (S511).<br>
[303] The SMT section provides signaling information on all virtual channel included in<br>
the MH ensemble including the corresponding SMT section. At least one SMT section<br>
describing the MH ensemble is included in each RS frame included in the cor-<br>
responding MH ensemble. Also, each SMT section is identified by an ensemble_id<br>
included in each section.<br>
[304] Furthermore each SMT provides IP access information on each virtual channel<br>
subordinate to the corresponding MHensemble including each SMT. Finally, the SMT<br>
provides IP stream component level information required for the servicing of the cor-<br>
responding virtual channel.<br>
[305] Therefore, by using the information parsed from the SMT, the IP stream component<br>
belonging to the virtual channel requested for reception may be accessed (S513). Ac-<br>
cordingly, the service associated with the corresponding virtual channel is provided to<br>
the user (S514).<br>
[306]<br>
[307] Relationship between FIC data and Other data<br>
[308] As shown in the above-mentioned description, mobile service data and main service<br>
data are multiplexed in the MH broadcasting signal and the multiplexed data in the MH<br>
broadcasting signal is transmitted. In order to transmit mobile service data,<br>
transmission-parameter-channel signaling information is established in TPC data, and<br>
fast-information—channel signaling information is established in FIC data. TPC data<br>
and FIC data are multiplexed and randomized, 1/4 Parallel Concatenated Con-<br>
volutional Code (PCCC) is error-correction-encoded, such that the PCCC-encoded data<br>
is transmitted to a data group. Otherwise, mobile service data contained in the<br>
ensemble is SCCC (Serial Concatenated Convolutional Code) -outer-encoded, such<br>
that the SCCC-encoded data is transmitted to a data group. Mobile service data<br>
includes content data constructing a service and service table information describing<br>
this service. This service table information includes channel information of the<br>
ensemble indicating at least one virtual channel group, and includes service description<br>
information based on channel information.<br>
[309] For the convenience of description, if several data segments pass through different<br>
modulation processes in a transmission unit or different demodulation processes in a<br>
reception unit although the data segments located in the same signal frame (or the same<br>
data group), it is represented that the data segments are transferred to different data<br>
channels because these data segments are signaling-processed via different paths. For<br>
example, it can be represented that the TPC data and FIC data are transmitted to a data<br>
channel other than a data channel in which the content data and the service table in-<br>
formation are transmitted. Because error correction coding/decoding processes to<br>
which the TPC data and FIC are applied are different from those applied to the content<br>
data and the service table information contained in the ensemble.<br>
[310] Under the above-mentioned assumption, a method for receiving the MH broadcasting<br>
signal will hereinafter be described. A digital broadcasting system according to the<br>
present inventionreceives a broadcasting signal in which mobile service data and main<br>
service dataare multiplexed. The system acquires version information of FIC data from<br>
TPC data received in a first data channel among mobile service dataand acquires<br>
binding information of an ensemble and a virtual channel contained in the en-<br>
semblefrom the FIC data. Therefore, it can be recognized which one of ensembles<br>
transmits a service of a user-selected virtual channel.<br>
[311] Thus, the system can receive the ensemble transferring the corresponding virtual<br>
channel according to a parade format. The systemcan acquire data groups contained in<br>
a series of slots from the parade received in a receiver. If the data groups are collected<br>
during only one MH frame, the system can acquire the RS frame equippedwith this<br>
ensemble. Therefore, the system decodes the RS frame, and parses the service table in-<br>
formationcontained in the decoded RS frame. The system can acquire a service of the<br>
virtual channel from the parsed service table information using information describing<br>
the user-selected virtual channel.<br>
[312] The FIC data transferred to a first data channel may indicate binding information an<br>
ensemble and the virtual channelassociated with the ensemble, in which the ensemble<br>
is transferred to a second data channel. Using the binding information, the system can<br>
parse me service table information contained in a specific ensemble, such that the<br>
service can be quickly displayed.<br>
[313]<br>
[314] FIG. 25 is an FIC segment according to the present invention. The FIC segment may<br>
include an FIC header, an FIC segment payload, and a stuffing byte. The FIC segment<br>
includes an FIC segment header, for example, it may include the size of 37 bytes. If the<br>
FIC segment is not filled with information, the stuffing byte is contained in the FIC<br>
segment, such that the size of 37 bytes can be assigned to the FIC segment.<br>
[315] The above-mentioned description has exemplarily disclosed information contained in<br>
the FIC segment header and the FIC segment payload. Next, another example of the<br>
above information will hereinafter be described.<br>
[316]<br>
[317] FIG. 26 is a header of an FIC segment according to a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The FIC segment header may include the size of 4 bytes.<br>
[318] The FIC segment header may include an FIC_type field of 2 bits, a reserved field of<br>
one bit, an ESG_version field of 5 bits, a transport_stream_ID field of 16 bits, an<br>
FIC_segment_number field of 4 bits, and an FIC_Last_segment_number field of 4 bits.<br>
Detailed description of the individual fields will hereinafter be described.<br>
[319]<br>
[320] FIG. 27 is an FIC segment according to a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention. An FIC_type field of 2 bits according to the second embodiment of the FIC<br>
segment includes a type of FIC data. Information following the FIC data or the size of<br>
this information may be changed according to the type of FIC data. In this case, the<br>
FIC data type is shown as 00 as an example.<br>
[321] After the reserved field (1 bit) having the value of 1, the ESG_version field of 5 bits<br>
indicates version information of service guide information. As shown in the above-<br>
mentioned description, any of ensembles may include service guide information. The<br>
service guide information may include service schedule information, service access in-<br>
formation, service purchase information, etc. Version information transferred to the<br>
ensemble may be contained in the FTC segment header. Therefore, the digital<br>
broadcasting reception system can recognize whether or not a version of the service<br>
guide information is updated on the basis of the FIC segment, before receiving the<br>
service guide information contained in the ensemble.<br>
[322] A Transport_stream_ID field of 16 bits is an identifier of a broadcast stream<br>
transferring the FIC segment. The Transport_stream_ID field of 16 bits may have an<br>
identifier capable of identifying only a corresponding broadcast stream from among all<br>
broadcasting streams for use in all broadcasting systems.<br>
[323] An FIC_segment_number field of 4 bits indicates a serial number of divided FIC<br>
segments on the condition that an FIC body is divided into a plurality of FIC segments.<br>
[324] An FIC_last_segment_number field of 4 bits is the last one of divided FIC segments<br>
equal to a plurality of FIC segments formed by division of an FIC body.<br>
[325] An Ensemble_id field of 8 bits indicates an identifier of the ensemble transferring<br>
mobile service data.<br>
[326] After the reserved field of 3 bits, an SI_version field of 5 bits indicates version in-<br>
formation contained in service table information transferred to the ensemble. This<br>
service table information has been disclosed as an SMT as an example.<br>
[327] A numchannels field of 8 bits indicates the number of virtual channels identified by<br>
the ensemble identifier.<br>
[328] A channel_type field of 4 bits indicates a service type of the virtual channel.<br>
[329] A channel_activity field of 2 bits is used as activity information of a corresponding<br>
virtual channel, such that it indicates whether or not a corresponding channel provides<br>
a service. By means of this channel_activity field of 2 bits, a digital broadcasting<br>
reception system is able to recognize whether a virtual channel is an active or inactive<br>
channel on the basis of FTC data.<br>
[330] That is, before the digital broadcasting reception system receives/displays a service<br>
from a corresponding channel using channel information or acquires service in-<br>
formation by parsing service table information, it can quickly acquire specific in-<br>
formation indicating whether the corresponding channel is an active or inactive<br>
channel from FTC data acting as physical-layer signaling information.<br>
[331] A CA_indicator field of one bit indicates conditional access information of a cor-<br>
responding virtual channel. For example, this CA_indicator field can quickly recognize<br>
whether or not a service of the corresponding channel has been scrambled on the basis<br>
of the above-mentioned physical-layer signaling information.<br>
[332] A stand_alone_Service_Indicator field of one bit indicates whether a broadcast<br>
service can be provided to a user using only a service of a corresponding virtual<br>
channel.<br>
[333] A major_channel_num field of 8 bits indicates a major channel number of a cor-<br>
responding virtual channel, and a minor_channel_num field of 8 bits indicates a minor<br>
channel number of the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[334] If the FIC segment has data of less than 37 bytes, an FIC_stuffing field indicates<br>
specific data capable of filling the FTC segment, such that the FTC segment is able to<br>
have the size of 37 bytes.<br>
[335] Version information of the above-mentioned FIC data can be acquired from<br>
transmission-parameter-channel (TPC) signaling information. For example, data<br>
capable of being contained in the transmission parameter channel signaling in-<br>
formation is as follows.<br>
[336] The transmission-parameter-channel signaling information may include an<br>
MH_ensemble_ID used as identification information of the ensemble, the number of<br>
MH subframes (MH subframe number), a total number of MH groups (TNoG)<br>
contained in one parade of one MH subframe, a counter (RS-frame continuity counter)<br>
indicating a number of an RS frame transferring the ensemble, an RS-frame column<br>
size (N) indicating the RS frame size, and a version number of FTC data (FTC data<br>
number).<br>
[337] The transmission-parameter-channel signaling information is transferred from the<br>
signaling decoder 190 to the TPC handler 214 of the digital broadcasting reception<br>
system. This transmission parameter channel information may include specific in-<br>
formation such as an FIC version number of FTC data.<br>
[338] Therefore, if the transmission-parameter-channel signaling information is decoded,<br>
the digital broadcasting reception system is able to recognize whether or not FIC data<br>
is updated. If the FIC data is updated, the digital broadcasting reception system can<br>
acquire the above-mentioned FIC data.<br>
[339]<br>
[340] FIG. 28 shows exemplary values of the channel_activity field according to the<br>
present invention. Exemplary values of the channel_activity field of a virtual channel<br>
capable of being contained in FIC data are as follows.<br>
[341] If the channel_activity field has a value of '00' this means that a corresponding virtual<br>
channel is an active channel currently providing the service. And, this channel_activiry<br>
field of 00 indicates that service guide information of a corresponding virtual channel<br>
is being provided.<br>
[342] If the channel_activity field has a value of '01' this means that a corresponding virtual<br>
channel is an inactive channel incapable of providing the service. And, the service<br>
guide information provides the service guide information associated with this virtual<br>
channel. That is, although the digital broadcasting reception system can provide the<br>
user with a channel having the above channel_activity information through service<br>
guide information, it is unable to tune this virtual channel.<br>
[343] If the channel_activiry field has a value of '10' this means that this virtual channel is a<br>
hidden channel. In more detail, a current channel is an inactive channel and a service<br>
provided to this inactive channel is not equal to a general service. Also, service guide<br>
information of this virtual channel is not provided. If the digital broadcasting reception<br>
system is unable to receive a predetermined service over the hidden channel, it is<br>
unable to rune a corresponding channel and is also unable to receive service guide in-<br>
formation of the corresponding channel.<br>
[344] If the channel_activity field has a value of '11' this means that a corresponding virtual<br>
channel is a software download channel. The digital broadcasting reception system is<br>
unable to tune a corresponding channel to receive a desired service, and does not<br>
provide the user with service guide information of the corresponding channel.<br>
Operations of the software download channel correspond to background operations,<br>
and performed by the digital broadcasting reception system.<br>
[345] Information of a channel active status is contained in FIC data, such that the digital<br>
broadcasting reception system can quickly recognize whether or not a corresponding<br>
virtual channel is an active channel using this channel active status information.<br>
[346]<br>
[347] On the other hand, activity information of a channel can be contained in service<br>
guide information. The channel_activity information contained in the service guide in-<br>
formation may include active- or inactive- time information of this channel. The<br>
channel_activity information contained in the service guide information will<br>
hereinafter be described.<br>
[348J<br>
[349] FIG. 29 shows a structure of service guide information according to the present inven<br>
tion. An example of the service guide information is as follows.<br>
[350] If entry point information of service guide information is contained in the ensemble,<br>
the digital broadcasting reception system receives a service guide delivery descriptor<br>
(ServiceGuideDeliveryDescriptor) which describes service guide information using<br>
corresponding entry point information. The digital broadcasting reception system is<br>
able to obtain structure- and acquisition- information of the service guide information<br>
from the above-mentioned service guide delivery descriptor<br>
(ServiceGuideDeliveryDescriptor), such that it receives service guide information<br>
using the obtained structure- and acquisition- information.<br>
[351 ] The service guide information can be provided in segmented lower level units. In this<br>
case, each of the segmented lower level units of the service guide information is called<br>
a fragment.<br>
[352] The example of this figure includes a service fragment, a schedule fragment, a<br>
content fragment, a purchase fragment, a purchase-data fragment, a purchase-channel<br>
fragment, an access fragment, a preview fragment, and an interactiveData fragment.<br>
The arrow represents referring relation. According to this example, the service<br>
fragment can refer to the content fragment. The number above an arrow represents a<br>
number of pieces of lower level information. Namely, the number is the number of the fragments therein.<br>
[353] Principal fragments from among the above-mentioned fragments are as follows.<br>
[354] The service fragment includes a service provided to a user, for example, service in-<br>
formation such as a conventional one television channel. Bundle services include in-<br>
formation of a service group. The service group may be a sports service bundle or a<br>
cinema service bundle, etc.<br>
[355] A contents fragment includes metadata of contents. Various types of the contents<br>
may be contained in the contents fragment, for example, an A/V type, a text type, and<br>
an image type of the contents may be contained in the contents fragment.<br>
[356] A schedule fragment includes schedule information of one content. For example, a<br>
broadcast time of the contents may correspond to this schedule fragment<br>
[357] A purchase fragment includes purchase-associated information of the service capable<br>
of being purchased by the user. A purchase channel indicates that a fragment of a<br>
terminal or user is an interface communicating with a purchase system. The purchase<br>
channel fragment includes parameters associated with the purchase system or<br>
management information of a purchase channel.<br>
[358] An access fragment includes access information capable of accessing a service or<br>
content. By means of the service guide information received from the terminal, the<br>
user can access the service or content through information associated with the ac-<br>
quisition fragment, and can purchase the service or content.<br>
[359]<br>
[360] FIG. 30 shows channel_activity information contained in the service guide in-<br>
formation according to the present invention.<br>
[361] The channel_activity information may have channel activity attributes indicating<br>
whether a corresponding virtual channel is an active or inactive channel.<br>
[362] If a corresponding virtual channel is determined to be the inactive channel, the<br>
channel_activity information is considered to be valid, and may have<br>
channel_activiation_time information at which a corresponding virtual channel is<br>
activated in a dataTime field.<br>
[363] If a corresponding virtual channel is determined to be the active channel, the<br>
channel_activity infomraiton is considered to be valid, and may have<br>
channel_inactiviation_time information at which a corresponding virtual channel is in-<br>
activated in the dataTime field.<br>
[364]<br>
[365] FIG. 31 is an XML (extensible Markup Language) schema of the channel_activity<br>
information according to the present invention. As shown in the above-mentioned de-<br>
scription, the channel_activity information may have a channel activity attribute<br>
element, an inactive-time element, and an active-time element. The channel_activity<br>
information is contained in the service fragment, such that it may indicate charac-<br>
teristics of a corresponding service.<br>
[366]<br>
[367] FIG. 32 shows exemplary channel activity elements contained in a service fragment<br>
according to the present invention. The service fragment may have attribute in-<br>
formation of a service ID (ID), a version (Version), and a starting- and ending- time<br>
(validFrom and validTo) of a valid period.<br>
[368] The service fragment may have a name element of a service name, a parental rating<br>
element including service rating information, and a channel activity element. In<br>
addition, the service fragment may further include a description element for describing<br>
the service, and a genre element for describing a genre. The channel activity element<br>
has already been described in the above-mentioned description.<br>
[369]<br>
[370] FIG. 33 shows another example of an SMT contained in service table information<br>
according to the present invention. A table_id field of the above-mentioned SMT<br>
indicates table information of a corresponding service. A section_syntax_indicator<br>
field indicates whether a corresponding section is based on an MPEG-long form. A<br>
private_indicator field may be set to 1 , a reserved field may be set to 11, a<br>
version_number field may have a version number of this service table information. A<br>
last_section_number field indicates a number of the last section. An ensemble_id field<br>
indicates an identifier of the ensemble described by the SMT.<br>
[371] A transport_stream_id field indicates an identifier of a transport stream in a physical<br>
channel. A source_id field indicates an identifier for identifying a source of a service<br>
(or program) associated with a virtual channel.<br>
[372] A major_channel_num field indicates a major channel number associated with a cor-<br>
responding virtual channel, and a minor_channel_num field indicates a minor channel<br>
number of the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[373] A num_streams field indicates the number of streams contained in the corresponding<br>
virtual channel. An IP_version_flag field indicates whether a version describing the<br>
following IP address is an IPv4 or IPv6. A target_IP_address field indicates an IP<br>
address of this virtual channel.<br>
[374] A stream_type field of each stream indicates a type of a corresponding stream, and a<br>
target_port_num field indicates a port number of the corresponding stream. If the<br>
stream type is determined to be an audio stream, an ISO_630_language_code field<br>
indicates language information of the audio stream.<br>
[375] The SMT may include a descriptor in a virtual channel level or an ensemble level.<br>
[376]<br>
[377] FIG. 34 is a flow chart illustrating a data processing method according to the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 34, a digital broadcasting reception system performs<br>
tuning of a specific physical channel. A broadcast signal may be an MH broadcasting<br>
signal including both mobile service data and main service data.<br>
[378] If the broadcast signal is tuned at step S602, the digital broadcasting reception system<br>
demodulates the received broadcast signal at step S603.<br>
[379] The digital broadcasting reception system gathers FIC segments contained in the<br>
broadcast signal at step S605. The signaling decoder 190 shown in FIG. 1 is able to<br>
collect FIC segments on the basis of one frame or one subframe.<br>
[380] If the last FIC segment is gathered, the digital broadcasting reception system is able<br>
to perform parsing of the FIC body used as an FIC transmission body. The digital<br>
broadcasting reception system can identify the broadcast signal on the basis of the FIC<br>
data at step S608. For example, the digital broadcasting reception system can identify<br>
the broadcast signal using transmission_stream_ID information of the FIC data.<br>
[381] The digital broadcasting reception system identifies channel map information at step<br>
S609. In order to identify a corresponding channel, the<br>
system acquires an ensemble identifier, a major/minor-<br>
channel number, and type information of a channel<br>
contained in the ensemble.<br>
[382] The digital broadcasting reception system parses<br>
channel_activity information from FIC data at step S610.<br>
The digital broadcasting reception system can acquire<br>
channel activity information from FIC data, such that it<br>
can quickly acquire activity information of the channel<br>
contained in the ensemble.<br>
[3 83] If a channel contained in the ensemble is determined to<br>
be an active channel (i.e., channel_activity = 00)<br>
according to the channel_activity information at step S611,<br>
the system decodes an RS frame to which data of a<br>
corresponding channel is transferred at step S621.<br>
[384] The digital broadcasting reception system identifies the<br>
SMT corresponding to the service table information, which<br>
describes a service capable of being provided from a<br>
corresponding ensemble, from the decoded RS frame, and<br>
parses the SMT at step S622.<br>
[385] The digital broadcasting reception system can access the<br>
IP stream according to IP address information contained in<br>
the parsed SMT at step S623. The system quickly acquires<br>
channel activity information of the selected channel. If<br>
a corresponding channel is the active channel, the system<br>
can acquire the service at step S650.<br>
[386] During the above steps S621 - S650, the system<br>
determines whether version information cf the service<br>
guide information is updated on the basis of FIC data at<br>
step S613.<br>
[387] If the version information of the service guide<br>
information is not updated at step S613, a decoder (i.e.,<br>
a secondary RS frame decoder 212) for additionally<br>
decoding the service guide information is not operated at<br>
step S63 2. The version information of the service guide<br>
information may be contained in FIC data, and can be<br>
parsed by the FIC handler 215 of FIG. 1.<br>
[388] If BSG version information of the service guide<br>
information contained in the FIC data is updated at step<br>
S613, the system decodes the RS frame transferring the<br>
ensemble which exclusively transmits the service guide<br>
information at step S637.<br>
[3 89] If the decoded RS frame is decoded at step S637, the<br>
system parses the service table information (SMT) which<br>
describes the service transferred in the ensemble of a<br>
corresponding RS frame at step S641.<br>
[390] The system accesses an IP stream according to IP address<br>
information contained in the parsed SMT at step S642. The<br>
system displays corresponding service guide information<br>
of a user-selected command at step S64 3, and provides a<br>
mobile service at step S650.<br>
[391] If a channel contained in the ensemble is determined to<br>
be an inactive channel<br>
according to the channel_activity information, and is not<br>
equal to a specific channel provided from service guide<br>
information (i.e., channel_activity = 0.1) at step S651,<br>
the system determines whether service guide information<br>
is updated or not at step S613.<br>
[392] As a result of the step S651, the channel_activity<br>
information can indicate whether the channel contained in<br>
the ensemble is a hidden channel at step S652.<br>
[393]<br>
[394] Referring back to FIG. 1, the channel_activity<br>
information contained in FIC data and version information<br>
of service guide information can be parsed from the FIC<br>
handler 215. If the version information of the service<br>
guide information is changed to another, the secondary RS<br>
frame handler 212 can decode the ensemble which<br>
exclusively provides service guide information having an<br>
updated version, while the primary RS frame handler 212<br>
decodes the ensemble providing the service.<br>
[395] The service guide information contained in the ensemble<br>
exclusively providing the service guide information is<br>
stored in the storage unit 290 by the ESG handler 270.<br>
The ESG decoder 280 provides the presentation controller<br>
330 with the service guide information stored in the<br>
storage unit 290.<br>
[396] An application driven by the application manager 350<br>
transmits the service guide information to the display<br>
module 320 using the decoded service guide information.<br>
The display module 320 can display the application<br>
associated with the service guide information.<br>
[397] According to the present invention, before the digital<br>
broadcasting reception system tunes/outputs the selected<br>
virtual channel or parses service table information<br>
describing the virtual channel, it can quickly obtain<br>
status information of the above virtual channel on the<br>
basis of data (herein, fast-information-channel signaling<br>
information) transferred to a specific data channel of<br>
the signal frame. That is, the digital broadcasting<br>
reception sys"tem can quickly obtain specific information<br>
indicating whether a channel is an active or inactive<br>
channel on the basis of the obtained channel activity<br>
information, and at the same time can also decode the<br>
ensemble including other channels.<br>
[398] The system quickly acquires version information of<br>
service guide information associated with channel<br>
activity information from the FIC data, and is able to<br>
output the service guide information.<br>
