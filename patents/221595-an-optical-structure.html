DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to presently preferred embodiments of the present invention. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
The present inventors have realized that applying an inorganic high index of refraction material, i.e., a material with an index of refraction greater than 1.7, preferably greater than 2, adjacent an organic light management film with an index of refraction less than 1.7, preferably less than 1.5, can enhance the optical effects achieved with the organic light management film. The organic light management film with the adjacent high index inorganic film can manipulate the directionality of the light toward a viewer, or select certain polarizations over others. The high index film, by further affecting the directionality of light, may improve the viewing angle for a viewer of and LCD and the contrast of an LCD display. Thus, a high index film on a low index light management film enhances the specific performance of the coated light management film. In particular the high index film may be used in an LCD to increase efficiency or enhance wavelength or polarization selectivity.<br><br>
Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of an optical structure according to an embodiment of the invention. The optical structure 10 includes a light source 14 in a substrate 12, with an organic light management film 16 disposed above the light source 14. The organic light management film 16 may be a quarter wave plate, brightness enhancing film, retardation foil, diffuser film, color filter, high pass filter, band pass filter, or low pass filter, for example. If the organic light management film 16 is a color filter, it may be a color filter array with individual red, blue and green pixel sized filters. If it is a filter, the filter might be used as a color selective transflector, a neutral density filter, an TR. blocking filter or a UV blocking filter, for example.<br>
The optical structure 10 also includes a high index (i.e., an index of refraction greater than 1.7) transparent inorganic film 18 adjacent the organic light management film 16. The organic light management film 16 and the transparent inorganic film 18 may also be arranges as a number of alternating layers, i.e., a plurality of films IS alternating with a plurality of films 16. The organic light management film 16 may have a plurality of raised features 20, such as prismatic features, for example. The transparent inorganic film 18 may be disposed conformally on the organic light management film 16 with the plurality of raised features 20.<br>
hi the embodiment of Figure 1, the organic light management film 16 comprises two sublayers, a substrate layer 16A and an overlayer 16B. While the substrate layer 16A does not have raised features, the overlayer 16 does have the raised features 20.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates another embodiment where the organic light management film 16 includes only a substrate layer 16A, and the substrate layer 16A includes a plurality of raised features 20.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates another embodiment where the organic light management film 16 includes only a substrate layer 16A. In this embodiment the substrate layer 16A does not include raised features, but the transparent inorganic film 18 disposed on the substrate layer 16A includes a plurality of raised features 20.<br>
The structure 10 of the embodiments of Figures 1, 2 or 3 may also include an interlayer IS disposed between the substrate 12 and the organic light management<br><br>
film 16. The interlayer 15 may be a thin metal layer, for example. Alternatively, the interlayer may be disposed between the organic light management film 16 and the transparent inorganic film 18.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the effect of the inorganic film 18 on the light emitted from the light source 10. For ease of illustration, only the inorganic film 18 and the organic light management film 16 are shown in Figure 4. In the structure of Figure 4, the organic light management film 16 and the inorganic film 18 have indices of refraction of nj and n2, respectively, with ni  1.7. A light ray 30 travels in the organic light management film 16 at an angle 61 with respect to the nonnal 34 to the bottom surface 36 of the organic light management film 16. The light ray 30 is refracted at the interface of the organic light management film 16 and the inorganic film 18 due to the different indices of refraction for these materials according to known optical principles, and makes an angle 62 with respect to the normal to the surface 38 of the inorganic film 18.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates me effect of the inorganic film 18 on the light emitted from the light source 10 in the case where the organic light management film 16 includes a number of raised features 20. Figure 5 has the same structure as Figure 4 except for the raised features 20. In this case the raised features 20 are prismatic structures having prismatic surfaces, and the inorganic film 18 is conformal to the organic light management film 16. In a similar fashion to the light ray 30 in Figure 4, the light ray 30 in Figure 5 travels in the organic light management film 16 at an angle 61 with respect to the normal 34 to the bottom surface 36 of the organic light management film 16. Again, the light ray 30 is refracted at interface of the organic light management film 16 and the inorganic film 18 due to the different indices of refraction for these materials according to known optical principles. In Figure 5, the light ray 30 passes from the inorganic film 18 to air or vacuum with an index of refraction of about 1.0. Because the top surface 39 of the organic light management film 16 is not parallel to that of the bottom surface 36, and because (he inorganic film 18 is conformal to the organic light management film 16, in Figure 5, the light ray 30 may leave the inorganic film 18 in a direction which is nonnal to the bottom surface<br><br>
36 of the organic light management film 16. Thus, a light ray which enters the organic light management film 16 at an oblique angle, may leave the inorganic film 18 at an angle normal to bottom surface 36 of the organic light management film 16. Thus, Figure 5 illustrates an example of how oblique light rays may be redirected using the high index inorganic film 18.<br>
The inorganic film 18 not only affects the directionality of light leaving the film 18, but also can selectively affect the polarization of the light, as disclosed in U.S. application serial no. 10/065,957, filed on December 4, 2002, entitled "POLARIZATION SENSITIVE OPTICAL SUBSTRATE", which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Figures 6-8 illustrate embodiment of the invention where the inorganic films 18 and the organic light management films 16 alternate in optical structures, wherein the optical structures act as interference filters. An interference filter, as is known in the art, is a filter that controls the spectral composition of transmitted (and reflected) light energy hi part through interference of light reflected at the layer interfaces of the films making up the filter.<br>
For ease of illustration, only the inorganic films 18 and the organic light management films 16 are shown in Figures 6-8, not the light source 14 and substrate 12 of the embodiments of Figures 1-3.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates an embodiment with two inorganic films 18 and two organic light management films 16 arranged in alternate fashion. The optical structure 70 of Figure 6 is arranged to operate as a narrow antireflection filter.<br>
Figure 9 is a graph showing the % reflectance as a function of wavelength for normal light incidence on the optical structure 70 of Figure 6. Figure 9 shows the % reflectance specifically for the case where the index of refraction of the inorganic films 18 and the organic light management films 16 is 2.5 and 1.45, respectively, and where the layer thicknesses from the top to the bottom layer in Figure 6 is 17.35 nm, 35.32 nm, 132.66 nm and 94.50 nm, respectively.<br><br>
Figure 7 illustrates an embodiment with a single inorganic film 18 and a single organic light management film 16 arranged as shown. Hie optical structure 80 of Figure 7 is arranged to operate as a wide antireflection filter.<br>
Figure 10 is a graph showing the % reflectance as a function of wavelength for normal light incidence on the optical structure 80 of Figure 7. Figure 10 shows the % reflectance specifically for the case where the index of refraction of the inorganic film 18 and the organic light management film 16 is 2.05 and 1.38, respectively, and where the layer thicknesses of the inorganic film 18 and the organic light management film 16 in Figure 7 is 134.15 nm, 99.64 nm, respectively.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates an embodiment with several inorganic films 18 and several organic light management films 16 arranged in alternate fashion. The optical structure 90 of Figure 8 is arranged to operate as a wide band reflection filter.<br>
Figure 11 is a graph showing the % transmittance as a function of wavelength for normal light incidence on the optical structure 90 of Figure 9. Figure 11 shows the % reflectance specifically for the case where the index of refraction of the inorganic films 18 and the organic light management films 16 is 2.35 and 1.45, respectively, and where the layer thicknesses from the top to the bottom layer in Figure 8 ranges between about 20 nm and about 225 nm, respectively. The total number of inorganic films 18 and the organic light management films 16 together is 59 for the graph of Figure 11. Of course in practice the total number of layers will vary depending upon the application.<br>
Figure 12 is a schematic of an optical device 40 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The optical device 40 includes a modulation array 42 comprising a liquid crystal material. The modulation array selectively allows light to pass through a pixel of the array as is known in the art The optical device 40 may be a liquid crystal display (LCD), for example. The optical device 40 may include elements of the optical structure described above with respect to Figure 1.<br>
The optical device 40 includes a substrate 12, which may be a backlight, for example, including a light source 14. Disposed between the modulation array 42 and the<br><br>
substrate 12, or on the opposite side of the modulation array 42 from the substrate 12 are one or more organic light management films 16 (with an index of refraction less than 1.7) with a corresponding adjacent transparent inorganic film 18 (with an index of refraction greater than 1.7). The organic light management film 16 may be one or more of a quarter wave plate, brightness enhancing film, retardation foil, diffuser film, color filter, high pass filter, band pass filter, low pass filter, for example. If the organic light management film 16 is a color filter, it may be a color filter array with individual red, blue and green pixel sized filters, for example. If a filter, me filter might be used as a color selective transflector.<br>
The organic light management film 16 and the transparent inorganic film 18 may also be disposed alternately in a number of layers.<br>
The organic light management films 16 may have a plurality of raised features 20, such as prismatic features, for example. The transparent inorganic films 18 may be disposed conformally on their respective organic light management film 16 with die plurality of raised features 20.<br>
The organic light management film 16 may comprise a substrate layer and a overlayer as in the embodiment of Figure 1, or just a substrate layer as in die embodiments of Figures 2 and 3. The organic light management film 16 and the transparent inorganic film 18 may also be arranged alternately as in the embodiments of Figures 6-8.<br>
The transparent inorganic film 18 in die above embodiments of may be formed of inorganic materials such as, for example, metal oxides, such as titanium oxide and zinc oxide, or nitrides, such as silicon nitride, or oxynitrides, such as silicon oxynitride. The transparent inorganic film 18 may also be formed of ceramic compounds, such as boron carbon nitride. Thin transparent metal films may also be used for die transparent inorganic film 18. The transparent inorganic film 18 may also be formed of transparent conducting oxide coatings such as Indium Tin Oxide, Indium Oxide, Tin Oxide, or Cadmium Tin Oxide.<br>
The material for the organic light management film 16 will depend upon die application, and may be, for example, an organic polymer such as polycarbonate.<br><br>
Method of forming transparent inorganic film<br>
The transparent inorganic film 18 is preferably formed by depositing under vacuum in an enclosed deposition chamber. Because the film IS is inorganic, there are a variety of deposition methods under vacuum in an enclosed deposition chamber which may be used. Suitable techniques for deposition of the transparent inorganic film 18 include physical vapor deposition techniques. These physical vapor deposition techniques include, for example, electron beam evaporation, thermal evaporation, and sputtering. Suitable techniques for deposition of the transparent inorganic film 18 also include chemical vapor deposition techniques. These chemical vapor deposition techniques irtfclude, for example, chemical vapor deposition, plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition, expanding thermal plasma deposition and atmospheric plasma chemical vapor deposition.<br>
The raised features 20 either on the organic light management film 16, or on the transparent inorganic film 18, can be formed by conventional photolithography' techniques, such as be depositing photoresist, exposing through a photomask, developing the photoresist to pattern it, followed by etching through the patterned photoresist.<br>
The transparent inorganic film 18 may be deposited in a conformal fashion over existing raised features 20 in the organic light management film 16. However, for specific applications directional deposition either from normal angle or oblique angle relative to the substrate 12 may be preferred.<br>
Either before or after the step of depositing the transparent inorganic film 13 under vacuum, the organic light management film 16 may be disposed into an optical structure which includes a light source, such as onto a backlight, for example.<br>
With directional coatings, specific portions of the features may be coated without coating the entire feature 20. Figure 13 illustrates an optical structure 50 where the raised features 20 are prismatic features, and only those portions of the features with a surface perpendicular to the direction from which the material is deposited are coated with a first transparent inorganic film 18 A. In this case, the organic light management<br><br>
film 16 will be effected by the first transparent inorganic film ISA only for those portions covered by the first transparent inorganic film ISA.<br>
The organic light management film 16 may comprise a substrate layer and an overlayer as in the embodiment of Figure 1, or just a substrate layer as in the embodiment of Figure 2.<br>
Optionally, those portions of the organic light management film 16 not covered with the first transparent inorganic film ISA, may be covered with a second transparent inorganic film 18B. Together the first transparent inorganic film ISA and the second transparent inorganic film 18B make up the transparent inorganic film 18. The second transparent inorganic film 18B may be made of the same or a different material from the first transparent inorganic film ISA. Preferably the second transparent inorganic film 1SB is made of a different material from the first transparent inorganic film ISA with a different index of refraction. Thus, a light ray passing through the optical structure 50 will encounter a different index of refraction passing through the first transparent inorganic film ISA as compared to the second transparent inorganic film 1SB.<br>
The second transparent inorganic film 18B may be formed by directional deposition after the first transparent inorganic film ISA. In mis case, after the first transparent inorganic film ISA is formed, the orientation of the substrate is changed relative to the direction from which the material is deposited so that a different surface is perpendicular to the direction from which the material is deposited to form the second transparent inorganic film 18B.<br>
The thickness of the organic light management films 16 and the transparent inorganic films IS in the above embodiments will depend on the application but are typically between 10 nm and 10,000 nm. The thickness of the optical structures in the above embodiments will also depend on the application but are typically between 100 nm<br>
and 5 cm.<br>

and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
