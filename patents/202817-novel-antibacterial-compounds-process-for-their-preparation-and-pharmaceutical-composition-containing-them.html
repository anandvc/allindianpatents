Baclcground of the Invention<br>
Since the discovery of penicillin, pharmaceutical companies have produced more than one hundred antibacterial agents to combat a wide variety of bacterial infections. In the past several years, there has been rapid emergence of bacterial resistance to several of these antibiotics. The multidrug resistance among these bacterial pathogens may also be due to mutation leading to more virulent clinical isolation, the most disturbing milestone has been the acquisition of resistance to vancomycin, an antibiotic generally regarded as the agent of last resort for serious Gram-positive infections. This growing multidrug resistance has recently rekindled interest in the search for new structural class of antibiotic that inhibit or kill these bacteria possibly by novel mechanisms.<br>
A problem of larger dimension is the increasing incidence of the more virulent, methicillin-resistant   Staphylococcus   aureas   (MRSA)   among   clinical   isolates   found<br><br>
worldwide. As with vancomycin resistant organisms, many MRSA strains are resistant to most 0^ the known antibiotics, but MRSA strains have remained sensitive to vancomycin. However, in view of the increasing reports of vancomycin resistant clinical isolates and growing problem of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need for new molecular entities effective against the emerging and currently problematic Gram-positive organisms.<br>
Recently, several oxazolidinones have been discovered, which inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50S-ribosomaI subunit which is close to the site to which chloramphenicol and Hncomycin bind but their mode of action is mechanistically distinct from these two antibiotics.<br>
Various 1,2,3-triazoles, 1,2,4-triazoles and benzotriazoles have been reported to show various biological activities and have therefore found applications in medicinal chemistry. The literature survey shows the use of 1,2,3-triazoles, for the treatment of neuropathic pain and associated hyperalgesia, including trigeminal and herpectic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathic pain, migraine, causalgia and deafferentation syndromes such as brachial plexus avulsion, an anticoccidiostat, as antiproliferative agents, for antimetastatic activity in a model of ovarian cancer progression, for anti-inflammatory effect, controUing activity against noxious organisms, for the treatment of ischemia, anti-human inununodeficiency virus activity etc.<br>
However, there are no reports of 1,2,3-triazole derivatives of the present invention being used for treating bacterial infections, specifically against multidrug resistant strains.<br>
The new class of triazoles of the present invention is usefiil for the treatment of a number of resistant and sensitive gram-positive strains both in vitro and in vivo. (a)       Chem. Pharm.

The compounds of the formula (I) as defined above are clinically administered to mammals, including human beings, via either oral or parenteral routes. Administration by the oral route is preferred, bemg more convenient and avoiding the possible pain and irritation of injection. However, in circumstances where the patient cannot swallow the medication, or absorption following oral administration is impaired, as by disease or other abnormality, it is essential that the drug be administered parenterally. By either route, the dosage is in the range of about 5 mg/kg to about 20 mg / kg body weight of the subject per day administered singly or as a divided dose. However, the optimum dosage for the individual subject being treated will be determined by the person responsible for treatment.<br><br>
generally smaller doses being administered initially and thereafter increments made to determine the most suitable dosage.<br>
