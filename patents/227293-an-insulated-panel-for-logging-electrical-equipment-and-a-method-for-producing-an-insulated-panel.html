				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an insulating panel<br>
based on mineral fibers such as glass fibers, glass<br>
wool, rockwool and the like, and to a method of<br>
producing such an insulating panel. For simplicity in<br>
that which follows, mention will chiefly be made of<br>
glass fiber panels.<br>
Thermal insulating panels which are generally used for<br>
lagging electrical equipment, particularly household<br>
electrical equipment, for example electric or microwave<br>
ovens, refrigerators, boilers, air-conditioning<br>
equipment and the like, are widely used in the market.<br>
Such panels have a core made of insulating material,<br>
for example glass fibers, which is possibly faced on<br>
one or both faces with an aluminum film. The aluminum<br>
facing layer is there to make the panels easier to<br>
handle, to hold in the dust created by the glass<br>
fibers, to reduce the risks of the glass fibers<br>
becoming teased out and stuck together when the panels<br>
are superposed or stacked.<br>
These panels are generally positioned on the outside of<br>
the opening of the household electrical equipment, the<br>
aluminum facing of the panel generally being positioned<br>
on that face of the panel that faces toward the outside<br>
of the household electrical appliance. In general,<br>
these panels are not visible and are positioned in a<br>
gap formed in the casing of the household electrical<br>
appliance.<br>
In general, before being assembled with the household<br>
electrical appliance, these panels are preformed with<br>
holes suitable for accommodating the fasteners and, for<br>
example, to allow for the passage of the electrical<br><br>
cables of the household electrical appliance.<br>
The insulating panels in the prior art have various<br>
disadvantages due in the main to the electrical and<br>
thermal conductivity properties of the aluminum facing<br>
layer.<br>
Specifically, since these panels often have electrical<br>
cables passing through them and are in contact with<br>
such cables, if these electric cables are not suitably<br>
insulated, the aluminum facing, which is electrically<br>
conductive, carries the risk of creating dangerous<br>
short circuits. The aluminum facing is also not elastic<br>
and therefore flexible enough and is also liable to<br>
split, creating the additional risk of sustaining cuts<br>
on its edges.<br>
Furthermore, since the core of glass fibers is a good<br>
thermal insulator, whereas the aluminum facing is a<br>
good conductor of heat, a thermal bridge is created<br>
between the core of glass fibers and the aluminum<br>
facing and this compromises the insulating<br>
characteristics of the panel.<br>
In order to produce these panels in the prior art,<br>
molten glass is first of all introduced into a<br>
fiberizing machine from which glass fibers emerge which<br>
are mixed with the binder and drop onto a conveyor belt<br>
on which air is sucked out of them before they are<br>
conveyed into an oven to stabilize the binder.<br>
In an alternative to the use of a binder, in order to<br>
interconnect the glass fibers in the core of the panel,<br>
these glass fibers collected on the conveyor belt may<br>
undergo a needle punching operation in order to obtain<br>
a mechanical connection by recourse to special hooked<br>
needles.<br>
In any case, what is obtained is a core or mat of glass<br><br>
fibers interconnected by chemical means (using a<br>
binder) or by mechanical means (by needle punching) and<br>
which is possibly wound into a roll so that it can be<br>
transported to a subsequent working phase in which the<br>
aluminum facings are bonded onto the wad of glass<br>
fibers using an appropriate silicate-containing<br>
adhesive.<br>
Next, the mat of glass fibers with its aluminum facing<br>
is wound into rolls or possibly cut to form semi-<br>
finished panels which are cut in such a way as to<br>
obtain the desired dimensions with appropriate fixing<br>
and cable lead-through holes.<br>
Finally, the rolls or the panels of semi-finished<br>
product are sent to a final drying phase to dry the<br>
adhesive used to apply the aluminum facing.<br>
It has become evident that these processes for<br>
producing insulating panels are lengthy and expensive<br>
particularly as a result of the great number of phases<br>
needed for bonding the aluminum facing on.<br>
The object of the present invention is to eliminate the<br>
disadvantages of the prior art by proposing an<br>
insulating panel based on glass fibers which has good<br>
lagging properties while at the same time providing<br>
good electrical insulation.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose an<br>
insulating panel which is extremely flexible and<br>
eliminates any cutting risk.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to<br>
propose such an insulating panel which is versatile,<br>
practical for the user, economical and simple to<br>
produce.<br>
According to the invention, these objects are achieved<br><br>
with the insulating panel that has the characteristics<br>
summarized in the attached independent claim 1.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a<br>
method for producing an insulating panel based on<br>
mineral fibers which is effective, quick and at the<br>
same time economical and simple.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved<br>
using the methods of producing an insulating panel the<br>
phases of which are summarized in the attached<br>
claims 13 and 19 respectively.<br>
A final object of the invention is the use of such an<br>
insulating panel in an electrical appliance,<br>
particularly a household electrical appliance, such as<br>
those mentioned above.<br>
The insulating panel based on glass fibers according to<br>
the invention comprises a core of interconnected glass<br>
fibers and a facing layer connected to at least one<br>
face of the core of glass fibers.<br>
The particular characteristic of the invention is that<br>
the facing layer comprises a woven-nonwoven (WNW), a<br>
woven fabric of mineral fibers or a web of mineral<br>
fibers, particularly of glass fibers. For convenience,<br>
in that which follows, the facing layer will be chiefly<br>
denoted a woven-nonwoven (WNW) layer, also commonly<br>
known as "nonwoven".<br>
It yields numerous advantages, both in the end-product<br>
and in the production process.<br>
Specifically, the woven-nonwoven is a good insulator,<br>
both electrically and thermally. The result of this is<br>
that risks of short circuiting the electrical cables<br>
that pass through the panel are eliminated and, at the<br>
same time, no abrupt jumps in temperature between the<br><br>
core of glass wool and the woven-nonwoven facing layer<br>
are seen.<br>
Furthermore, the WNW facing improves the ease with<br>
which the panel can be handled by guaranteeing the user<br>
a better feel than panels with aluminum facing.<br>
Furthermore, since the WNW is more elastic and flexible<br>
than aluminum, in addition to making the panel easier<br>
to handle, the risks of the edges of the panel<br>
splitting are avoided.<br>
Other characteristics of the invention will become more<br>
clearly apparent from reading the detailed description<br>
which follows, which relates purely by way of<br>
nonlimiting example to the embodiments depicted in the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 is a	functional diagram schematically<br>
representing the	method of producing an insulating<br>
panel based on	mineral fibers according to the<br>
invention, and<br>
figure 2 is a functional diagram schematically<br>
depicting a second embodiment of the method of<br>
producing an insulating panel based on mineral fibers.<br>
A first embodiment of the method of producing the<br>
insulating panel based on glass fibers according to the<br>
invention will now be described using figure 1.<br>
A molten glass paste 1 is sent to a fiberizing machine<br>
2 which produces a plurality of glass fibers 10.<br>
The machine employs rotary fiberizing of the so-called<br>
internal centrifugation type, in which the molten<br>
material is received in a rotary component exhibiting<br>
symmetry of revolution and termed a spinner, having a<br>
wall pierced with a plurality of orifices through which<br><br>
the molten material is ejected and taken in hand by an<br>
stretching gas stream.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the machine<br>
is set to produce fibers characterized by a micronaire<br>
of the order of 3 to 4.5 under a load of 5 g. According<br>
to the embodiment of figure 1, the fibers<br>
advantageously have a micronaire of the order of 3 to<br>
3.8 under a load of 5 g.<br>
The glass fibers 10 which leave the fiberizing machine<br>
2 are transported through a spraying ring 3 in which<br>
one or more binders are sprayed these binders combining<br>
with the glass fibers 10 in order to promote chemical<br>
inter-bonding between them. By way of binder, use may<br>
be made of mineral binders such as, for example, an<br>
aqueous solution of aluminum polyphosphate salts.<br>
In this way, glass fibers mixed with the binders 11<br>
leave the spraying machine 3 and are gathered together<br>
on a support 9 to form a sparse mass 12 of glass fibers<br>
and binder in which the binder performs its binding<br>
action on the glass fibers. The support 9 has the form<br>
of a tape which is paid out from a master reel 90 and<br>
advanced in the direction of the arrow FA using a<br>
conveyor 4.<br>
The support 9 is a strip made of a woven-nonwoven<br>
(WNW), a woven glass fabric or a glass web. The support<br>
9 is preferably made up of a woven-nonwoven based on<br>
plastic, for example derivatives of polyethylene and/or<br>
polyester, to which metal oxide fillers are possibly<br>
added.<br>
In the region of the conveyor 4, under the support 9,<br>
there is a suction device 5 the function of which is to<br>
suck air from the sparse mass 12 of glass fibers and<br>
binder through the support 9 so as to extract the<br>
fiberglass dust and at the same time encourage a first<br><br>
reduction in the humidity of the fibers and binders.<br>
It should be pointed out that, by virtue of the fact<br>
that use is being made of a support 9 made of a woven-<br>
nonwoven of a weight that allows air to be filtered,<br>
the air suction phase can be performed at the same time<br>
as the mass of glass fibers 12 is received on the<br>
support 9. This operation is clearly impossible if, by<br>
way of support 9, use is made of a metallic material,<br>
for example an aluminum film, as in the prior art,<br>
which does not allow air to pass. By way of indication,<br>
a weight of the order of 10 to 100 g/m2 effectively<br>
fulfils the function of allowing the air to be sucked<br>
through.<br>
Downstream of the suction device 5, and also downstream<br>
of the mass of glass fibers 12, there is a press roller<br>
6 whose function is to perform a first compacting of<br>
the glass fibers so as to obtain a core or mat of<br>
essentially homogeneous glass fibers 13 arranged on the<br>
support 9. Adhesion between the lower support 9 and the<br>
mat of glass fibers 13 is guaranteed by the suction<br>
phase performed by the suction device 5 during which<br>
the humidity of the binder is reduced.<br>
If, by way of end-product, a fiberglass panel with a<br>
facing on both sides is desired, then use is made of a<br>
second master reel 90' from which a strip of WNW 9' is<br>
unwound, advantageously essentially identical to the<br>
facing 9 unwound from the first master reel 90.<br>
Downstream of the press roller 6, above the mat of<br>
compacted glass fibers 13, there is an "inking roller"<br>
unit 7 which comprises a binder distributing roller<br>
which picks up the binder from a vat situated<br>
underneath and spreads it over the underside of the<br>
strip of WNW 9'. The binder used in this phase may be<br>
the same binder as the one used in the spraying machine<br>
3 in other aqueous solutions, or may be a different<br><br>
mineral binder.<br>
The need to use the inking roller unit 7 is due to the<br>
fact that, downstream of the suction device 5, the<br>
binder added to the glass fibers during the spraying<br>
phase has generally dried to too great an extent or has<br>
completely dried and is therefore generally unable to<br>
attach the upper support to the mat of glass fibers 13.<br>
Downstream of the inking roller unit 7 there is a press<br>
roller 70 which determines the coupling between the<br>
support 9' and the mat of fibers 13. At this stage, the<br>
core of mineral fibers generally has a thickness of the<br>
order of 15 to 35 mm, particularly of the order of 20<br>
to 30 mm.<br>
In order to adhere the upper support 9' to the mat of<br>
glass fibers 13, the mat of glass fibers 13 firmly<br>
sandwiched between the lower support 9 and the upper<br>
support 9' is advanced by means of a lower conveyor<br>
belt 80 and of an upper conveyor belt 80' into an oven<br>
8 which dries the binder deposited by the inking roller<br>
unit 7 and therefore allows the upper support 9' to<br>
adhere to the mat of glass fibers 13 and stabilizes the<br>
adhesive between the fibers. The operating temperature<br>
of the binder-drying oven 8 ranges between 100°C and<br>
200°C.<br>
Finally, the layer of glass fibers 13 to which the<br>
lower support and the upper support 9, 9' are bonded is<br>
taken up into a roll or is cut and trimmed directly to<br>
obtain insulating felt of appropriate dimensions,<br>
consisting of a layer of glass fibers 13 which are<br>
bonded together and bonded to at least one support 9,<br>
9' by means of binders of mineral type.<br>
A second embodiment of the methods of producing an<br>
insulating panel based on glass fibers configured as<br>
variants to the method of figure 1 will now be<br><br>
described with reference to figure 2. Because of the<br>
similarity with the embodiment of figure 1, identical<br>
elements corresponding to those already described with<br>
reference to figure 1 are denoted by the same numerical<br>
references and are not described again in detail.<br>
In this second embodiment, the glass fibers 10 leave<br>
the fiberizing machine 2 and are not mixed with binders<br>
able to create a chemical bond between the fibers. In<br>
this case, use is made of a minimum amount of agents<br>
the sole purpose of which is to hold in the dust rather<br>
than to create a chemical bond between the fibers. In<br>
general, by way of anti-dust additives, use is made of<br>
a type of agent known per se and termed Fomblin®.<br>
According to the embodiment of figure 2, the fibers<br>
advantageously have a micronaire of the order of 3.5 to<br>
4.5 under a load of 5 g.<br>
At this point, the glass fibers are gathered together<br>
to form a mat 112 (figure 2) which can be rolled into a<br>
roll.<br>
The mat of glass fibers 112 is advanced between two<br>
supports 9, 9' paid out from first and second master<br>
reels 90, 90'. Obviously, if the facing is wanted on<br>
just one face of the fibers, one of the two reels 90,<br>
90', preferably the upper reel 90', may be omitted.<br>
Downstream of the reels 90, 90', respective coupling<br>
rollers 170, 170', able to tension the respective<br>
supports 9, 9' are provided beneath and above the mat<br>
of glass fibers 112. The mat of glass fibers 112 with<br>
the respective supports 9, 9' is advanced by means of a<br>
conveyor 140 in the direction of the arrow FA toward a<br>
needle-punching machine 108.<br>
The needle-punching machine 108 comprises a plurality<br>
of hooked needles 180 positioned under the plane of the<br><br>
lower support 9, and a plurality of hooked needles 180'<br>
positioned above the plane of the upper support 9'. The<br>
lower needles 180 and the upper needles 180' travel<br>
vertically in a reciprocating movement in the direction<br>
of the arrows Fv.<br>
In this way, the needles 180, 180' pass through the<br>
respective supports 9, 9' and connect the glass fibers<br>
of the mat 112 together and to the respective supports<br>
9, 9'. As a result, upon leaving the needle-punching<br>
machine 108, we will have a mat or core of compact<br>
glass fibers 113 is obtained in which the glass fibers<br>
are mechanically connected together, mechanically<br>
connected to the lower support and mechanically<br>
connected to the upper support 9, 9', respectively.<br>
It should be pointed out that, by virtue of the fact<br>
that use is made of a woven-nonwoven support 9, 9' of a<br>
weight that is suitable to allow the needles 180, 180'<br>
to pass, advantageously of the order of 10 to 100 g/m2,<br>
the needle-punching phase can be performed directly on<br>
the supports 9, 9', thus avoiding the subsequent phase<br>
of bonding the supports 9, 9' to the mat of fibers 112.<br>
This operation is clearly impossible if, by way of<br>
supports 9, 9', use is made of a metallic material, for<br>
example an aluminum film, as in the prior art, which<br>
would be punctured by the passage of the needles 180,<br>
180' without in any way creating a connection between<br>
the film and the core of fibers.<br>
Such a mat of fibers 113 with mechanically-connected<br>
respective supports 9, 9' is transported out of the<br>
needle-punching machine 108 by means of a conveyor 141<br>
and from there is sent on to the subsequent phases of<br>
rolling it into a roll and then cutting and/or<br>
trimming, in order to obtain the desired products.<br>

15.The method as claimed in claims 13 or 14, wherein said steps of chemical-<br>
type bonding involve the following phases:<br><br><br>
-	adding a mineral binder to the mineral fibers (10),<br>
-	receiving the mineral fibers (11) together with the mineral binder<br>
on a strip of said facing layer (9).<br>
-	sucking air through said facing layer (9) and then drying said<br>
mineral binders in order to create the bond between the mineral<br>
fibers and the bond between the mineral fibers and the facing layer<br>
(9).<br>
16.The method as claimed in claim 15, comprising:<br>
-	depositing the mineral binder on a second facing layer (9') and<br>
-	applying said second facing layer (9') onto the opposite surface of<br>
the core of mineral fibers (13) to the one to which said first facing<br>
layer (9) is bonded so that said mineral binder is located between<br>
said second facing layer (9') and one face of the core of mineral<br>
fibers (13).<br>
17.The method as claimed in claim 16, comprising the step of drying said<br>
mineral binder deposited between said second facing layer (9') and a<br>
surface of the core of mineral fibers (13), by heating.<br><br><br>
18.The method as claimed in claim 17, wherein said step of drying the<br>
mineral binder by heating is performed at a temperature ranging between<br>
100°C and 200°C.<br>
19.	A method for producing an insulating panel based on mineral fibers as<br>
claimed in any one of claims 10 to 12, which comprises the following<br>
steps:<br>
-	spinning mineral fibers (10) from a molten mineral substance (1),<br>
-	producing a mechanical-type connection between said mineral<br>
fibers (10) so as to obtain a core of mechanically interconnected<br>
mineral fibers (113),<br>
-	producing a mechanical-type connection between said core of<br>
mineral fibers (113) and a facing layer (9, 9') positioned on at least<br>
one face of said core of mineral fibers (113).<br>
20.	The method as claimed in claim 19, wherein said phase of bonding the<br>
mineral fibers (113) together takes place at the same time as the step of<br>
bonding the mineral fibers to the facing layer (9, 9') using a connection of<br>
a mechanical type.<br>
21.The method as claimed in claims 19 or 20, wherein said connection of a<br>
mechanical type is achieved by needle punching, in which hooked needles<br><br>
(180, 180') pass through said facing layer (9, 9') to mechanically connect<br>
the mineral fibers of the core (113) to one another and to the facing layer<br>
(9, 9').<br>
22.The method as claimed in any one of claims 19 to 21, comprising the step<br>
of adding anti-dust agents to the mineral fibers prior to the mechanical-<br>
connection step.<br>
23.The method as claimed in any one of claims 13 to 22, wherein the step of<br>
spinning the mineral fibers (10) from a molten mineral substance is<br>
performed using a rotary process involving internal centrifugation.<br><br>
The invention relates to an insulating panel for lagging electrical equipment, the<br>
panel being based on mineral fibers, selected from glass fibers, glass wool,<br>
rockwool and comprising a core (13; 113) of interconnected mineral fibers by a<br>
mineral binder and a facing layer (9, 9') applied to at least one face of said core<br>
of mineral fibers (13; 113), said facing layer (9; 9') comprises a woven-nonwoven (WNW),<br>
a woven mineral fiber fabric or a web of mineral fibers, and<br>
in that the facing layer is chemically bonded to the mineral fibers of the core by a<br>
mineral binder or is mechanically connected to the mineral fibers of the core.</td>
