				<td>	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]      The present invention relates to a keyboard<br>
apparatus having a key frame to which is mounted a key unit<br>
that includes a plurality of key main bodies supported via<br>
hinges for pivotal motion by a common base end.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002]      Conventionally, there has been known a keyboard<br>
apparatus in which a key frame is mounted with a key unit<br>
having a plurality of key main bodies supported for pivotal<br>
motion by a common base end via thin plate-like hinges.<br>
For example, Japanese Patent No. 2628656 discloses a key<br>
unit comprised of two white key units and one black key<br>
unit, which are disposed in a stacked relation.  The white<br>
and black key units each have hinges horizontally extended<br>
rearward substantially parallel to key depression surfaces<br>
of the keys, and therefore, these key units are long in<br>
size in a longitudinal direction of keys.  As a<br>
consequence, the keyboard apparatus is large in depth size.<br>
[0003]      On the other hand, Japanese Laid-open Patent<br>
Publication No. 2001-215968 discloses a key unit in which<br>
hinges and a common base end are vertically extended<br>
downward from rear parts of key main bodies, thereby<br>
reducing the size of the key unit in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the keys.<br>
[0004]      However, in the key unit disclosed in Japanese<br>
Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2001-215968, the common<br>
base end is fixed at a plurality of portions to the key<br>
35frame using screws.  This poses a problem that many man-<br>
1<br><br>
hours are required in mounting the key unit to the key<br>
frame and the number of component parts increases.  When<br>
mounting the key unit to the key frame, an operator<br>
ordinarily performs an operation of placing the key unit in<br>
a desired position from the front side of the keyboard<br>
apparatus.  Nevertheless, the keyboard apparatus disclosed<br>
in Japanese Laid-open Publication No. 2001 215968 is<br>
constructed to threadedly engage screws from the rear side<br>
of the keyboard apparatus, which requires an additional<br>
step of such as inverting the keyboard apparatus front to<br>
back, posing a problem of poor workability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 [0005]      The present invention provides a keyboard<br>
apparatus capable of reducing a depth size of the keyboard<br>
apparatus and mounting a key unit to a key frame with a<br>
simple operation.<br>
[0006]     According to the present invention, there is<br>
provided a keyboard apparatus comprising a key unit having<br>
a plurality of key main bodies each of which is adapted to<br>
be supported for pivotal motion in a key depression/release<br>
direction by a common base end via a corresponding one of<br>
thin plate-like hinges, and a key frame having a base end<br>
support adapted to fixedly support the common base end of<br>
the key unit, wherein the hinges of the key unit are formed<br>
in a direction to cross the key depression surfaces of the<br>
key main bodies and parallel to a key arrangement<br>
direction, and wherein the common base end is fitted and<br>
fixed to the base end support using elastic deformation of<br>
at least one of the common base end of the key unit and the<br>
base end support of the key frame.<br>
[0007]     According to the present invention, it is<br>
possible to reduce the depth size of the keyboard apparatus<br>
and mount the key unit to the key frame with a simple<br><br>
operation.<br>
[0008]      One of the common base end and the base end<br>
support can be formed with a recessed groove extending in<br>
the key arrangement direction, and another of the common<br>
base end and the base end support can be formed in the key<br>
arrangement direction with a ridge-like protrusion<br>
extending in the key arrangement direction and adapted to<br>
be fitted to the recessed groove.<br>
[0009]      In this case, the fitting and fixing<br>
construction of the keyboard apparatus can be simplified.<br>
[0010]      The key unit can be comprised of at least one<br>
white key unit and one black key unit which are disposed in<br>
a stacked relation, the common base end fitted and fixed to<br>
the base end support can be comprised of a common-to-white-<br>
keys base end of the white key unit and a common-to-black-<br>
keys base end of the black key unit, which are stacked<br>
together, the base end support can be formed with a<br>
recessed groove extending in the key arrangement direction,<br>
and the common base end can be formed with a ridge-like<br>
protrusion fitted to the recessed groove extending in the<br>
key arrangement direction.<br>
[0011]      In this case, the fitting and fixing<br>
construction of the keyboard apparatus can be simplified,<br>
and a plurality of key units can be put into one piece and<br>
can be mounted to the key frame with a simple operation.<br>
[0012]      The key unit can include position restriction<br>
means adapted to restrict a positional relationship between<br>
the white key unit and the black key unit in the key<br>
arrangement direction, in a state where the white key unit<br>
and the black key unit have been stacked together but have<br>
not been mounted to the key frame.<br>
[0013] In this case, a plurality of key units can<br>
easily be handled when they are put into one piece for<br>
being mounted to the key frame, thereby further improving<br>
the workability.<br>
3<br><br>
[0014]     One of the common base end and the base end<br>
support can be formed with protrusions, and another of the<br>
common base end and the base end support can be formed with<br>
fit portions adapted to be fitted with the protrusions when<br>
the common base end is fitted and fixed to the base end<br>
support, a position of the common base end relative to the<br>
base end support in the key arrangement direction and in a<br>
vertical direction can be restricted when the protrusions<br>
are fitted to the fit portions.<br>
[0015]     In this case, the common base end can naturally<br>
be prevented from being detached from the base end support<br>
by being fitted and fixed to the base end support, whereby<br>
a fixed state can be stabilized and workability can be<br>
improved.<br>

will be determined in reference to the player.<br>
	5<br><br>
[0035]      FIG. 2A is a perspective view of the key unit<br>
UNT, and FIG. 2B is a perspective view of the key frame 10.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2A, the key unit UNT is constructed to<br>
cover one octave, for instance, and includes first and<br>
second white key units WU1, WU2 each having a plurality of<br>
white key main bodies 27 and a black key unit BU having a<br>
plurality of black key main bodies 28, these three units<br>
being assembled in a stacked relation.  The key frame 10 is<br>
made of resin or metal, is constructed into one piece, and<br>
has a length extending over the entire width of all keys.<br>
In FIG. 2B, only a one-octave part of the key frame 10 is<br>
shown.<br>
[0036]      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2B, at a location below<br>
a front portion of the key frame 10, there is provided a<br>
key depression stopper 11 adapted to restrict lower limit<br>
positions of the white and black key main bodies 27, 28 at<br>
the time of key depression.  At a location above the front<br>
portion of the key frame 10, an upper limit stopper 14 is<br>
provided for restricting upper limit positions of the white<br>
and black key main bodies at the time of key release.  At<br>
an intermediate portion of the key frame 10 as seen in the<br>
front-to-back direction, there are disposed two-make-<br>
contact key depression switches 12, 13, which correspond to<br>
respective ones of the white and black key main bodies 27,<br>
28.  It should be noted that FIG. 2B omits illustrations of<br>
portions of the key frame 10 to which the key depression<br>
switches 12, 13 are mounted.  The key frame 10 has its rear<br>
portion 10a formed with a recessed groove 15 over the<br>
entire key width.  A common-to-all-keys base end 20 (a base<br>
end common to all the keys) of the key unit UNT, described<br>
in detail later, is adapted to be fitted to and supported<br>
by the recessed groove 15.  The recessed groove 15 is a<br>
substantially U-shape as seen from side and has an opening<br>
that opens upward.<br>
[0037]      FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the black key<br>
6<br><br>
unit BU, and FIG. 4 is a side view showing rear halves of<br>
the white key units WU1, WU2, the black key unit BU, and<br>
the key unit UNT.<br>
[0038]      As shown in FIGS. 2A, 3 and 4, the black key<br>
unit BU includes black key main bodies 28 corresponding to<br>
respective ones of tone pitches C#, D#, F#, G#, and A#.  As<br>
shown in FIGS. 2A and 4, the first white key unit WU1<br>
includes white key main bodies 27-1 corresponding to tone<br>
pitches C, E, G, and B, and the second white key unit WU2<br>
lOincludes white key main bodies 27-2 corresponding to tone<br>
pitches D, F, and A.  In the following, the white key main<br>
bodies 27-1, 27-2 are simply referred to as "white key main<br>
bodies 27" when they are referred to as without<br>
distinction.  The white and black key main bodies 27, 28<br>
have front haves whose upper surfaces function as key<br>
depression surfaces 27a, 28a.  The white key units WU1, WU2<br>
and the black key unit BU are made of resin and constructed<br>
by integral forming.<br>
[0039]      As shown in FIGS. 1 to 3, the white and black<br>
key main bodies 27, 28 each have a front portion formed<br>
with a stopper contact member 29 or 30 extending downward<br>
for contact with the key depression stopper 11 at the time<br>
of key depression.<br>
[0040]     As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the black key main<br>
25bodies 28 of the black key unit BU each have a rear end<br>
from which a thin plate-like hinge 2 6 is extended downward.<br>
The hinges 26 are connected at their lower ends to a<br>
common-to-black-keys base end 23 (a base end common to the<br>
black keys) having a length corresponding to one octave.<br>
The hinges 2 6 and the common-to-black-keys base end 23 are<br>
the same in thickness and extend in a vertical direction<br>
and in parallel to the key arrangement direction (the left-<br>
to-right direction).  Each of the black key main bodies 28<br>
is supported via the hinge 26 for pivotal motion relative<br>
to the common-to-black-keys base end 23 in the vertical<br>
7<br><br>
direction (in the key depression/release direction).  The<br>
common-to-black-keys base end 23 is formed at its left and<br>
right ends with temporary joint members 31 that prevent the<br>
assembled key unit UNT from being disassembled in the left-<br>
to-right direction.  The temporary joint members 31 are<br>
formed into a plate-like shape and extended forward from<br>
the left or right end of the common-to-black-keys base end<br>
23.<br>
[0041]     As shown in FIG. 4 and as in the case of the<br>
black key unit BU, each of the white key main bodies 27-1<br>
of the first white key unit WU1 is formed at its rear end<br>
with a hinge 24 extending downward therefrom.  The hinge 24<br>
is connected at its lower end thereof to a first common-to-<br>
white-keys base end 21 (a base end common to white keys<br>
corresponding to tone pitches C, E, G, and B).  Each of the<br>
white key main bodies 27-2 of the second white key unit WU2<br>
is formed at its rear end with a hinge 25 extending<br>
downward therefrom.  The hinge 25 is connected at its lower<br>
end to a second common-to-white-keys base end 22 (a base<br>
end common to white keys corresponding to tone pitches D,<br>
F, and A).  Each white key main body 27 is supported via a<br>
corresponding hinge 24 or 25 for vertically pivotal motion<br>
relative to the first or second common-to-white-keys base<br>
end 21 or 22.  The hinges 24 and the first common-to-white-<br>
keys base end 21 are the same in thickness and extend<br>
vertically or extend perpendicular to the key depression<br>
surfaces 27a and parallel to the key arrangement direction.<br>
The hinges 25 and second common-to-white-keys base end 22<br>
are the same in thickness and extend vertically or extend<br>
perpendicular to the key depression surfaces 27a and<br>
parallel to the key arrangement direction.<br>
[0042]      In assembling the first and second white key<br>
units WU1, WU2 and the black key unit BU into the key unit<br>
UNT, the first and second common-to-white-keys base ends<br>
21, 22 and the common-to-black-keys base end 23, which are<br>
8<br><br>
common base ends of the units WU1, WU2 and BU, are<br>
sequentially disposed in a stacked relation from the front<br>
side of the keyboard apparatus, as shown in FIG. 4.  The<br>
common base ends 21 to 23 made in contact with one another<br>
and stacked together form the above described common-to-<br>
all-keys base end 20.<br>
[0043]      When any of the key depression switches 12, 13<br>
is depressed or released by a corresponding one of the<br>
white and black key main bodies 27 and 28, a key<br>
depression/release operation is detected.  Based on the<br>
detected key depression/release operation, a musical tone<br>
is generated by a musical tone generating section, not<br>
shown.<br>
[0044]      FIG. 5 is a plan view separately showing the<br>
key frame 10 and the key unit UNT in a state before they<br>
are assembled, and FIG. 6 is a section view taken along<br>
line A-A shown in FIG. 5.  On the leftmost and rightmost<br>
sides in FIG. 5, there are shown front-side and rear-side<br>
parts of the rear portion 10a of the key frame 10 with<br>
respect to the recessed groove 15.  Between the front-side<br>
and rear-side parts of the rear portion of the key frame,<br>
rear portions of the key units WU1, WU2, and BU are shown.<br>
[0045]     As shown in FIGS. 2B and 5, the key frame 10 is<br>
integrally formed with elastic members 17 so as to project<br>
therefrom at a plurality of locations (for example, three<br>
locations) which are on the front-side part of the rear<br>
portion 10a thereof in the key arrangement direction<br>
respect to the recessed groove 15.  The elastic members 17<br>
are formed so as to extend upward and formed thin along the<br>
key arrangement direction in such a manner that upper ends<br>
of the elastic members can be deformed in the front-to-back<br>
direction.  The elastic members 17 are each integrally<br>
formed at a rear surface with a protrusion 17a, which is<br>
formed in a circular shape as seen from rear so as to<br>
project from the elastic member (also refer to FIG. 6).<br>
9<br><br>
[0046]      As shown in FIGS. 2B, 5 and 6, the key frame 1<br>
is integrally formed with elastic members 16 so as to<br>
project therefrom at a plurality of locations (for example,<br>
two locations) on the rear-side part of the rear portion<br>
10a thereof in the key arrangement direction with respect<br>
to the recessed groove 15.  The elastic members 16 each<br>
have a flexible portion 16b extended upward.  The flexible<br>
portion 16b is formed thin along the key arrangement<br>
direction in such a manner that an upper end thereof can be<br>
deformed in the front-to-back direction.  As shown in FIG.<br>
6, the flexible portion 16b is formed with an operation<br>
pawl portion 16a extending from an upper part of the<br>
flexible portion 16b so as to be bent rearward.  The<br>
flexible portion 16b is formed with a circular fitting hole<br>
16c extending therethrough in the front-to-back direction.<br>
[0047]      A distance between the rear surface of the<br>
elastic member 17 and the front surface of the flexible<br>
portion 16b is the same as the width of the recessed groove<br>
 as seen in the front-to-back direction.  The just-<br>
20mentioned distance and the width are each set to be equal<br>
to the total thickness of the common base ends 21 to 23,<br>
i.e., the thickness of the common-to-all-keys base end 20<br>
in the front-to-back direction.<br>
[0048]      As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the first common-to-<br>
white-keys base end 21 of the first white key unit WU1 is<br>
formed with circular fitting holes 21b corresponding to the<br>
protrusions 17a of the key frame 10 so as to extend<br>
therethrough in the front-to-back direction.  The first<br>
common-to-white-keys base end 21 is integrally formed at<br>
its rear surface with protrusions 21a, which are the same<br>
in shape as the protrusion 17a, so as to project therefrom<br>
at locations different from the locations of the fitting<br>
holes 21b as viewed in the key arrangement direction (also<br>
refer to FIG. 4).<br>
[0049]      The second common-to-white-keys base end 22 of<br>
10	10<br><br>
the second white key unit WU2 is formed with fitting holes<br>
22a similar to the fitting holes 21b and corresponding to<br>
the protrusions 21a of the first white key unit WU1 so as<br>
to extend therethrough in the front-to-rear direction.  The<br>
common-to-black-keys base end 23 of the black key unit BU<br>
is integrally formed at its rear surface with protrusions<br>
23a, corresponding to the fitting holes 16c of the key<br>
frame 10 and being the same in shape as the protrusions<br>
17a, so as to project therefrom (also refer to FIGS. 2A, 3,<br>
and 4).<br>
[0050]      The key unit UNT is assembled in advance and<br>
then mounted to the key frame 10.  First, the second<br>
common-to-white-keys base end 22 of the second white key<br>
unit WU2 is superimposed on the rear surface of the first<br>
common-to-white-keys base end 21 of the first white key<br>
unit WU1, and the protrusions 21a are caused to be fitted<br>
into the fitting holes 22a.  As a result, the positions of<br>
the first white key unit WU1 and the second white key unit<br>
WU2 are restricted in all of the front-to-back direction,<br>
the left-to-right direction and the vertical direction.<br>
Then, the common-to-black-keys base end 23 of the back key<br>
unit BU is superimposed on the rear surface of the second<br>
common-to-white-keys base end 22 and is positioned so that<br>
the common base ends 21, 22 held between the temporary<br>
joint members 31 disposed on the both sides thereof.  As a<br>
result, the positions of the white key units WU1, WU2 and<br>
the black key unit BU are restricted in the front-to-back<br>
direction, and are temporarily restricted in the left-to-<br>
right direction.<br>
[0051]     Then, the common-to-all-keys base end 20 of the<br>
key unit UNT, which is comprised of the white and black key<br>
units stacked in three layers, is caused to be fitted to<br>
the recessed groove 15 of the key frame 10 from above.  As<br>
a result, the protrusions 17a of the elastic member 17 are<br>
caused to be fitted in the fitting holes 21b of the first<br>
11<br><br>
common-to-white-keys base end 21 and the protrusions 23a of<br>
the common-to-black-keys base end 23 are caused to be<br>
fitted into the fitting holes 16c of the elastic members 16<br>
(refer to FIG. 6).  At that time, the elastic members 17 ,<br>
16 having elasticity are once deformed to the front side<br>
and the rear side, and then restored to their original<br>
states when the protrusions 17a, 23a are fitted into the<br>
fitting holes 21c, 16c.  As a consequence, the common-to-<br>
all-keys base end 20 is elastically fitted and fixed to the<br>
recessed groove 15, whereupon the mounting of the key unit<br>
UNT to the key frame 10 is completed.<br>
[0052]      In the mounting state, as shown in FIG. 6,<br>
since the protrusions 23a and the fitting holes 16c are<br>
fitted to one another, the position of the black key unit<br>
BU relative to the key frame 10 is restricted in the left-<br>
to-right direction and in the vertical direction.  Since<br>
the protrusions 17a and the fitting holes 21b are fitted to<br>
one another, the positions of the first and second white<br>
key units WU1, WU2 relative to the key frame 10 are<br>
restricted in the left-to-right direction and in the<br>
vertical direction.<br>
[0053]      In a strict sense, the lower end surface of the<br>
common-to-all-keys base end 20 is slightly floated from a<br>
bottom surface of the recessed groove 15.  However, when an<br>
excessive force is applied to the common-to-all-keys base<br>
end 20 from above, the common-to-all-keys base end 20 is<br>
displaced downward and the lower end surface thereof can be<br>
made in contact with the bottom surface of the recessed<br>
groove 15.  Specifically, the protrusions 17a, 23a urge<br>
lower portions of the fitting holes 21b, 16c, thereby<br>
slightly expanding the elastic members 17, 16 in the front-<br>
to-back direction, and the protrusions 17a, 23a and the<br>
fitting holes 21b, 16c are temporarily dislocated from one<br>
another.  Thus, a force applied to the common-to-all-keys<br>
base end 20 is mainly received by the bottom surface of the<br>
12<br><br>
recessed groove 15.  As a result, an excessive external<br>
force is prevented from being applied, as a large load, to<br>
the protrusions 17a, 23a and the fitting holes 21b, 16b.<br>
[0054]      In order to dismount the key unit UNT from the<br>
key frame 10, two pawl portions 16a are operated so as to<br>
cause the flexible portions 16b to be deformed in the rear<br>
direction, and then the common-to-all-keys base end 20 is<br>
pulled off upward.<br>
[0055]     After the key unit UNT is assembled, when a key<br>
depression operation is performed, a corresponding one of<br>
the white and black key bodies 27, 28 is pivoted downward<br>
due to the presence of elasticity of the hinge 24, 25, or<br>
2 6, and thus a lower end of the stopper contact member 2 9<br>
or 30 is brought in contact with the key depression stopper<br>
11, whereby a key depression completed state is reached.<br>
When a key depression is released, a corresponding one of<br>
the white and black key main bodies 27, 28 is caused to be<br>
pivoted upward due to the presence of elasticity of the<br>
hinge 24, 25, or 26, and thus an upper end of the stopper<br>
contact member 29 or 30 is brought in contact with the<br>
upper limit stopper 14.  Therefore, the white or black key<br>
main body 27 or 28 is restored to its key-nondepressed<br>
position.<br>
[0056]      Since the hinges 24 to 26 extend downward at<br>
positions below the key depression surfaces 27a, 28a, much<br>
proper loci of the key depression surfaces 27a, 28a at the<br>
time of key depression can be attained as compared to a<br>
hinge arrangement in which hinges extend upward and an<br>
ordinary horizontal hinge arrangement.  Specifically, at<br>
the time of key depression, an arbitrary point on the key<br>
depression surface 27a or 28a (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"the key depression point") ordinarily performs a pivotal<br>
motion on a circle centered on a pivotal fulcrum.  Thus,<br>
considering a motion in the front-to-rear direction, the<br>
key depression point moves rearward with the advancement of<br>
13<br><br>
key depression.<br>
[0057]      In addition, the key depression point is<br>
displaced by hinge deformation in the case of a hinge-type<br>
key.  For example, in the case of a horizontal hinge, a<br>
rearward displacement of the key depression point is caused<br>
by a front hinge portion being deformed downward.  In the<br>
arrangement in which the hinge extends upward, a rearward<br>
displacement of the key depression point is caused by a<br>
lower hinge portion being deformed rearward.  The rearward<br>
displacement of the key depression point disadvantageously<br>
affects delicate performance expression, if an amount of<br>
the rearward displacement is large.<br>
[0058]      On the other hand, according to the present<br>
embodiment, an upper portion of the hinge 24, 25, or 26 is<br>
deformed forward at the time of key depression, and the key<br>
depression point is rather displaced forward depending on<br>
the deformation of the hinge 24, 25, or 26.  Thus, the<br>
deformation of the hinge 24, 25, or 26 exerts in a<br>
direction to cancel the rearward displacement caused by the<br>
pivotal motion around the pivotal fulcrum.  As a result,<br>
the rearward displacement of the key depression point in a<br>
forward stroke of key depression is suppressed.<br>
[0059]     As a consequence, a substantial displacement of<br>
the key depression point in the front-to-rear direction is<br>
25made small, so that the locus of the key depression point<br>
is such that the key depression point nearly straightly<br>
falls down.  Such locus is close to a locus of the key<br>
depression point that is observed in the case of a key of<br>
an acoustic grand piano, which is elongated and adapted to<br>
be pivoted around a fulcrum provided at a lower portion of<br>
the key.  Accordingly, proper loci of the key depression<br>
surfaces 27a, 28a can be attained, which contributes to<br>
improvement in expression.<br>
[0060]      According to the key unit UNT of this<br>
embodiment, the hinges 24 to 26 extend downward in the<br>
14<br><br>
vertical direction perpendicular to the key depression<br>
surfaces 27a and in parallel to the key arrangement<br>
direction, thus making it possible to shorten the dimension<br>
of the key unit UNT as viewed in the longitudinal direction<br>
of the keys and to suppress the depth dimension of the<br>
keyboard apparatus.  Due to elastic deformation of the<br>
elastic members 16, 17, the common-to-all-keys base end 20<br>
of the key unit UNT is fitted and fixed to the recessed<br>
groove 15.  Thus, as compared to an arrangement where it is<br>
essentially required to fix the key unit to the key frame<br>
using screws or the like, the key unit UNT can be assembled<br>
to the key frame 10 with a simple operation.  In<br>
particular, since it is unnecessary to perform screw clamp<br>
from rear, a process such as for inverting the keyboard<br>
apparatus front to back can be eliminated, thus improving<br>
workability.  It should be noted that in actual products,<br>
in addition to the fixing by means of elastic fitting, more<br>
perfect fixing means such as screw clamp may be added<br>
without any trouble.<br>
[0061]      The common-to-all-keys base end 20 is a ridge-<br>
like protrusion having a shape that can be fitted to the<br>
recessed groove 15 and thus the fitting and fixing<br>
arrangement is simple.  When the common-to-all-keys base<br>
end 20 is fitted to the recessed groove 15, the protrusions<br>
17a, 23a and the fitting holes 21b, 16c are fitted<br>
together, and therefore, the common-to-all-keys base end 20<br>
is naturally prevented from being detached from the<br>
recessed groove 15, which achieves a stable fixing state<br>
and improved workability.<br>
[0062]     The common-to-all-keys base end 20 is formed by<br>
stacking the common base ends 21 to 23 in layer, and<br>
besides the three key units WU1, WU2, BU are temporarily<br>
positioned by the temporary joint members 31 so as not to<br>
be disassembled in the left-to-right direction.  Thus, it<br>
is easy to handle the three key units WU1, WU2, BU when<br>
15<br><br>
they are assembled together and mounted to the key frame<br>
10,	thereby further improve workability.<br>
[0063]     It should be noted that an arrangement for<br>
temporarily restricting the positions of the white and<br>
black key units WU1, WU2, BU in the left-to-right direction<br>
before they are assembled to the key frame 10 is not<br>
limited to one using the temporary joint members 31.  For<br>
example, a member similar to the temporary joint member 31<br>
may be provided in either one of the white key units WU1,<br>
WU2 so as to extend rearward therefrom.  Alternatively, the<br>
second common-to-white-keys base end 22 and the common-to-<br>
black-keys base end 23 may be provided with a protrusion<br>
and a fitting hole in combination, which are similar to the<br>
above described protrusion 21 and the fitting hole 22a.<br>
[0064]      It should be noted that both the fitting holes<br>
16c of the key frame 10 and the protrusions 23a of the<br>
common-to-black-keys base end 23 may be removed.<br>
Specifically, when the key depression surface 27a of a key,<br>
especially a part thereof close to the front end of the<br>
key, is depressed, the white key main body 27 is applied<br>
with a force to lift up the rear end thereof around a<br>
fulcrum formed by the stopper contact member 29 (refer to<br>
FIG. 2A) made in contact with the key depression stopper<br>
11.	On the other hand, since the stopper contact member 30<br>
extends downward from the frontmost end of the black key<br>
main body 28 (refer to FIG. 3), the black key main body 28<br>
is not applied at its rear end with an upward urging force<br>
exerting around a fulcrum formed by the stopper contact<br>
member 30, even if the key depression surface 28a of the<br>
key concerned is depressed at its distal end.<br>
[0065]      As a consequence, during the normal performance<br>
use, the common-to-black-keys base end 23 is not applied<br>
with a force to cause the same to be detached upward from<br>
the recessed groove 15.  Thus, as described above, it is<br>
possible to eliminate the fitting holes 16c and the<br>
16<br><br>
protrusions 23a without any trouble.  To adopt such an<br>
arrangement, the common-to-black-keys base end 23 may be<br>
constructed such that a lower end thereof is made in<br>
contact with a bottom surface of the recessed groove 15 to<br>
apply a restriction for maintaining the base end in its<br>
proper vertical position.  In that case, in place of the<br>
temporary joint members 31, a mechanism, which is a<br>
combination of a contacting part and a contacted part or a<br>
combination of a protrusion and a recess for positioning<br>
the base end 23 and the key frame 10 or the base end 22<br>
relative to each other in the left-to-right direction, may<br>
be provided between the common-to-black-keys base end 23<br>
and the key frame 10 or the second common-to-white-keys<br>
base end 22.<br>
[0066]      The just-mentioned arrangement permits the<br>
black key unit BU alone to be easily detached even after<br>
the assemblage of the key unit UNT.  Also in a mounting<br>
process, the black key unit BU can be mounted to the key<br>
frame 10 after the key units WU1, WU2 are mounted thereto.<br>
[0067]      [Second embodiment]<br>
[0068]      FIG. 7 is a perspective view showing a one-<br>
octave part of a keyboard apparatus according to a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention.  The keyboard<br>
apparatus of this embodiment is comprised of a key frame<br>
110 corresponding to the above described key frame 10 to<br>
which is mounted a key unit UNT2 corresponding to the key<br>
unit UNT.  The key unit UNT2 is formed by first and second<br>
white key units WU11, WU 12 and a black key unit BU 10,<br>
which are assembled in a stacked relation.<br>
[0069]      FIG. 8 is a perspective view of the white key<br>
unit WUll.  FIG. 9A is a side view showing rear halves of<br>
the white key units WUll, WU12, the black key unit BU10,<br>
and the key unit UNT2.  FIG. 9B is a right side view<br>
showing a rear end of the keyboard apparatus.  FIG. 10 is a<br>
plan view separately showing the key frame 110 and the key<br>
17<br><br>
unit UNT 2 in a state before they are assembled together.<br>
In FIG. 10, the rear ends of the key units WU11, WU12, BU10<br>
are shown in this order from the left side of FIG. 10, and<br>
a rear portion 110a of the key frame 110 is shown on the<br>
rightmost side of FIG. 10.  In FIGS. 7 to 10, like elements<br>
which are the same as or similar to those of the first<br>
embodiment are denoted by like numerals.<br>
[0070]      As shown in FIGS. 7, 9B, and 10, the key frame<br>
110 is formed at the rear portion 110a with a recessed<br>
lOgroove 115 corresponding to the recessed groove 15 of the<br>
first embodiment.  On the rear side of the recessed groove<br>
115, elastic members 16 are integrally formed in the key<br>
frame 110 so as to project therefrom.  The construction of<br>
the elastic members 16 is the same as that of the first<br>
embodiment.  It should be noted that no elastic member 17<br>
is provided.  In other respects, the construction of the<br>
key frame 110 is the same as that of the above described<br>
key frame 10.<br>
[0071]      The key units WU11, WU12, BU10 are each made of<br>
resin in one piece.  White and black key main bodies 27, 28<br>
and hinges 24 to 26 are the same in construction as those<br>
of the first embodiment, but common base ends are different<br>
in construction from those of the first embodiment.<br>
[0072]      As shown in FIGS. 8 to 10, hinges 24 of the<br>
white key unit WU11 are connected at their lower ends to a<br>
first common-to-white-keys base end 121.  The first common-<br>
to-white-keys base end 121 is bent into a substantially U-<br>
shape as seen from side and has a recessed portion 121a<br>
that opens upward.  A shown in FIG. 8, the first common-to-<br>
white-keys base end 121 has a rear side plate portion (on<br>
the rear side of the recessed portion 121a) thereof formed<br>
with elastic members 51 so as to project therefrom at a<br>
plurality locations (for example, two locations) in the key<br>
arrangement direction, the elastic members 51 having the<br>
same construction of the above described elastic members<br>
18<br><br>
16.<br>
[0073]      Each of the elastic members 51 has a flexible<br>
portion 51b.  The flexible portion 51b is extended upward<br>
from the elastic member and integrally formed at its rear<br>
surface with protrusions 121b, which are formed into a<br>
circular shape as seen from rear and correspond to fitting<br>
holes 16c of the key frame 110.  Operation pawl portions<br>
51a extended from upper ends of the flexible portions 51b<br>
are bent rearward.  The flexible portions 51b are each<br>
formed with a circular fitting hole 51c so as to extend<br>
therethrough in the front-to-rear direction (also refer to<br>
FIG. 10).<br>
[0074]      As shown in FIGS 9A and 10, the second white<br>
key unit WU12 has hinges 25 thereof connected at their<br>
lower ends with the second common-to-white-keys base end<br>
122.  The second common-to-white-keys base end 122 has its<br>
rear surface integrally formed with protrusions 122a which<br>
are the same in shape as the above described protrusions<br>
121b.  In other respects, the second common-to-white-keys<br>
base end 122 has the same or similar construction as the<br>
above described second common-to-white-keys base end 22.<br>
[0075]      As shown in FIGS. 9A and 10, hinges 26 of the<br>
black key unit BU 10 are connected at their lower ends to a<br>
common-to-black-keys base end 123 which extends over a<br>
length corresponding to one octave.  The common-to-black-<br>
keys base end 123 is formed with circular fitting holes<br>
123b corresponding to the protrusions 122a of the second<br>
common-to-white-keys base end 122 so as to extend<br>
therethrough in the front-to-rear direction (refer to FIG.<br>
10).  The common-to-black-keys base end 123 is integrally<br>
formed at its rear surface with protrusions 123a having the<br>
same shape as the above described protrusions 121b so as to<br>
correspond to the fitting holes 51c of the key frame 110 at<br>
positions different from that of the fitting holes 123b in<br>
the key arrangement direction.  In other respects, the<br>
19<br><br>
common-to-black-keys base end 123 has the same construction<br>
as the above described common-to-black-keys base end 23.<br>
[0076]     The key unit UNT2 is integrally assembled in<br>
advance and then mounted to the key frame 110.  First, the<br>
common-to-black-keys base end 123 of the black key unit BU<br>
10	is superimposed on the rear surface of the second<br>
common-to-white-keys base end 122 of the second white key<br>
unit WU12, and the protrusions 122a and the fitting holes<br>
123b are fitted to one another.  Next, the second common-<br>
to-white-keys base end 122 and the common-to-black-keys<br>
base end 123 which are superimposed together are fitted to<br>
the recessed portion 121a of the first common-to-white-keys<br>
base end 121 of the first white key unit WU11.  At that<br>
time, the front-side and rear-side plate portions of the<br>
first common-to-white-keys base end 121 are once opened due<br>
to their elasticity.  Upon completion of the fitting of the<br>
base ends to the recessed portion, the protrusions 123a are<br>
fitted into the fitting holes 51c.<br>
[0077]     As a result, the first and second common-to-<br>
white-keys base ends 121, 122 and the common-to-black-keys<br>
base end 123 are stacked in three layers, and the stacked<br>
layers form a common-to-all-keys common base end 120<br>
corresponding to the above described common-to-all-keys<br>
base end 20 (refer to FIGS. 9A and 9B).  By the fitting of<br>
the protrusions 122a to the fitting holes 123b and the<br>
fitting of the protrusions 123a to the fitting holes 51c,<br>
the positions of the second white key unit WU12 and the<br>
black key unit BU10 relative to the first white key unit WU<br>
11	are restricted in the vertical direction and the left-<br>
to-right direction.<br>
[0078]     The common-to-all-keys base end 120 of the key<br>
unit UNT2 which is comprised of the white and black key<br>
units stacked in three layers is fitted from above to the<br>
recessed groove 115 of the key frame 110.  As a result, the<br>
elastic member 16 is elastically deformed, and then the<br>
20<br><br>
protrusions 12b of the first common-to-white-keys base end<br>
121	are fitted to the fitting holes 16c of the key frame<br>
110.  By the fitting of the protrusions 121b to the fitting<br>
holes 16c, the positions of the common-to-all-keys common<br>
base end 120 relative to the key frame 110 are restricted<br>
in the left-to-right direction and the vertical direction.<br>
In this manner, the common-to-all-keys base end 120 is<br>
elastically fitted and fixed to the recessed groove 115,<br>
whereby the mounting of the key unit UNT2 to the key frame<br>
110 is completed.<br>
[0079]      An operation of removing the key unit UNT2 from<br>
the key frame 110 is the same as the first embodiment.  To<br>
detach the second common-to-white-keys base end 122 and the<br>
common-to-black-keys base end 123 from the recessed portion<br>
121a of the first common-to-white-keys base end 121 of the<br>
first white key unit WUll in order to disassemble the key<br>
unit UNT2, the two pawl portions 51a are urged rearward and<br>
the base ends are pulled out upward.  The other functions<br>
at the time of assemblage and disassemblage are the same as<br>
the first embodiment.<br>
[0080]     According to this embodiment, effects similar<br>
to those attained by the first embodiment can be attained.<br>
In addition, since the second common-to-white-keys base end<br>
122	and the common-to-black-keys base end 123 are fitted to<br>
25and retained by the recessed portion 121a of the first<br>
white key unit WUll, the key unit UNT2 can further easily<br>
be handled before it is assembled to the key frame 110.<br>
[0081]      [Third Embodiment]<br>
[0082]     In the above described first and second<br>
embodiments, protrusions and fitting holes are provided<br>
between adjacent ones of the common-to-white-keys base end,<br>
the common-to-black-keys base end, and the key frame.<br>
However, one protrusion may be fitted to two or more<br>
fitting holes.<br>
 [0083]      FIG. 11A is a right side view showing a rear<br>
21<br><br>
end of a keyboard apparatus according to a third<br>
embodiment.  The keyboard apparatus of this embodiment<br>
includes a key frame 210 corresponding to the key frame 10,<br>
to which a key unit UNT3 corresponding to the key unit UNT<br>
is mounted.  FIG. 11B is a view schematically showing an<br>
arrangement in which a common-to-all-keys base end 220 is<br>
assembled to the key frame 210.<br>
[0084]      As shown in FIGS. 11A and 11B, in the key unit<br>
UNT3, first and second common-to-white-keys base end 221,<br>
222, and a common-to-black-keys base end 223 corresponding<br>
the above described first and second common-to-white-keys<br>
base end 21, 22 and the common-to-black-keys base end 23<br>
are stacked together, whereby a common-to-all-keys base end<br>
220 is formed which corresponds to the common-to-all-keys<br>
base end 20.<br>
[0085]      The first and second common-to-white-keys base<br>
ends 221, 222 are formed with fitting holes 221a, 222a<br>
corresponding to the fitting holes 21b (refer to FIG. 6).<br>
The common-to-black-keys base end 223 is integrally formed<br>
at a rear surface thereof with protrusions 223a<br>
corresponding to the protrusions 23a.  The key frame 210 is<br>
formed with a recessed groove 215 corresponding to the<br>
above described recessed groove 15.  As in the case of the<br>
first embodiment, on the rear side of the recessed groove<br>
25215, there are provided elastic members 16 each formed with<br>
a fitting hole 16c corresponding to the protrusion 223a<br>
concerned.<br>
[0086]      The key frame 210 is formed with protrusions<br>
210a at portions of the key frame on the front side of the<br>
recessed groove 215.  It should be noted that the above<br>
described elastic members 17 may be provided and the<br>
protrusions 210a may be formed in the elastic members 17 so<br>
as to project therefrom.  The protrusions 210a correspond<br>
to the fitting holes 221a, 222a.  Each protrusion 210a is<br>
1onger than the length of the fitting hole 221a in the<br>
22<br><br>
front-to-rear direction, but is shorter than the total<br>
length of the fitting hole 221a and the fitting hole 222a.<br>
In other respects, the construction is the same as that of<br>
the first embodiment.<br>
 [0087]     With the above construction, when the key unit<br>
UNT3 is mounted to the key frame 210, as shown in FIG. 11B,<br>
the first common-to-white-keys base end 221 is first<br>
inserted from above into the recessed groove 215 and is<br>
then moved forward, whereby the fitting holes 221a are<br>
fitted to the protrusions 210a.  Similarly, the second<br>
common-to-white-keys base end 222 is inserted from above<br>
into the recessed groove 215 and is then moved forward to<br>
cause the fitting holes 222a to be fitted to the<br>
protrusions 210a.  Next, the common-to-black-keys base end<br>
223 is inserted from above and fitted into the recessed<br>
groove 215, whereby the elastic members 16 are elastically<br>
deformed and the protrusions 223a are fitted into the<br>
fitting holes 16c.<br>
[0088]     As a result, the common base ends are stacked<br>
together in layer to form the common-to-all-keys base end<br>
220.  At the same time, the common-to-all-keys base end 220<br>
is elastically fitted and fixed to the recessed groove 215,<br>
whereby the mounting of the key unit UNT3 to the key frame<br>
210 is completed.<br>
25 [0089]     According to the present invention, it is<br>
possible to suppress the depth size of the keyboard<br>
apparatus and mount the key unit to the key frame with a<br>
simple operation, and therefore, effects similar to those<br>
of the first embodiment can be achieved, except for the<br>
white key units and the black key unit are assembled into<br>
the key unit, which is then mounted.<br>
[0090]     It should be noted that in order to assemble<br>
the key unit UNT3 into one piece using the protrusions<br>
210a, the protrusions 210a may be made longer than the<br>
total length of the fitting holes 221a, 222a but shorter<br>
23<br><br>
than the total thickness of the common-to-all-keys base end<br>
220, and the common-to-black-keys base end 223 may be<br>
formed with fitting holes to which the protrusions 210a are<br>
fitted, instead of forming therein the protrusions 223a and<br>
the fitting holes 16c.  In that case, elastic members<br>
capable of being deformed in the front-to-rear direction<br>
are provided in portions of the key frame 210 facing the<br>
first common-to-white-keys base end 221, and the<br>
protrusions 210a are formed in the elastic members.  As a<br>
result, when the common-to-black-keys base end 223 is<br>
inserted into the recessed groove 215, the elastic members<br>
are deformed forward to permit the base end to be inserted<br>
and fitted.<br>
[0091]      It should be noted that in the above described<br>
first to third embodiments, the common base ends are fitted<br>
and fixed to the key frame, mainly using elasticity of the<br>
key frame.  This is not limitative.  For example, the<br>
elastic deformation of either the common base ends or the<br>
key frame or the elastic deformations of both the common<br>
base ends and the key frame may be utilized for fitting and<br>
fixing the common base ends to the key frame.  Although the<br>
two white key units are employed in the embodiments, these<br>
key units may be put into one piece.  In other words, the<br>
key unit may be a divided-into-two construction comprised<br>
of the one-piece white key unit and the black key unit.<br>
[0092]      For example, in a keyboard apparatus according<br>
to a modification having a rear end thereof shown in a side<br>
view of FIG. 12, a one-piece white key unit WUx<br>
corresponding to the first and second white key units WU1,<br>
WU2 is formed separately from a black key unit BUx.  A<br>
common-to-white-keys base end 61 of the white key unit WUx<br>
is formed with a recessed groove 61c, which is formed into<br>
a U-shape and opens downward as seen from side.  Similarly,<br>
a common-to-black-keys base end 62 of the black key unit<br>
BUx is formed with a U-shaped recessed groove 62c.  The<br>
24<br><br>
common-to-white-keys base end 61 is formed with fitting<br>
holes 61a, 61b so as to extend therethrough, and the<br>
common-to-black-keys base end 62 is also formed with<br>
fitting holes 62a, 62b so as to extend therethrough.<br>
[0093]     A key frame 300 is formed at its upper portion<br>
with ridge-like supports 301, 302 so as to protrude<br>
therefrom and extend in the key arrangement direction.  The<br>
supports 301, 302 are provided at their opposite sides in<br>
the front-to-rear direction with protrusions 301a, 301b,<br>
302a, 302b so as to project therefrom, which correspond to<br>
the fitting holes 61a, 61b, 62a, 62b.<br>
[0094]      In the above arrangement, when the supports<br>
301, 302 are inserted into the recessed grooves 61c, 62c,<br>
the common-to-white-keys base end 61 and the common-to-<br>
black-keys base end 62 are elastically deformed, and then<br>
the supports 301, 302 are fitted into the recessed grooves<br>
61c, 62c.  At that time, the protrusions 301a, 301b, 302a,<br>
302b are fitted into the fitting holes 61a, 61b, 62a, 62b.<br>
[0095]     As described above, elastic deformations of the<br>
white key unit WUx and the black key unit BUx may mainly be<br>
utilized for fitting and fixing the common base ends 61, 62<br>
to the key frame 300.<br>
[0096]      It should be noted that although the key units<br>
UNT, UNT2, UNT3 in the above described embodiments are each<br>
constructed to cover one octave, this is not limitative.<br>
Each of the key units may be constructed to cover a<br>
predetermined tone region including a plurality of keys.<br>
Furthermore, the number of the white key units and the<br>
number of the black key unit of one key unit UNT or the<br>
like are not limited.  It is not essentially required to<br>
form the key unit UNT or the like by dividing the same into<br>
the white key unit and the black key unit.  The key unit<br>
UNT or the like may be formed by one key unit that includes<br>
a plurality of white keys and a plurality of black keys<br>
belonging to the predetermined tone region.<br>
25	25<br><br>
[0097]     It should be noted that in the above described<br>
embodiments, as a mechanism for restricting the positional<br>
relation between the common base ends or between the common<br>
base ends and the key frame, a combination of protrusions<br>
and fitting holes (such as the protrusions 17a and the<br>
fitting holes 21b, and the protrusions 23a and the fitting<br>
holes (refer to FIG. 6)) has been described as an example,<br>
but this is not limitative.  For example, the relationship<br>
of protrusions and fitting holes (relationship of concavity<br>
and convexity) may be reversed.  Furthermore, the fitting<br>
holes may not be through holes and may be engagement<br>
portions such as recesses which permit protrusions to abut<br>
thereagainst or to be fitted therewith, and the number of<br>
the engagement portions is not limited.  In particular, a<br>
mechanism for preventing the common-to-all-keys base end<br>
from being detached from the key frame is not limited to<br>
being constructed by protrusions and fitting holes.  For<br>
example, the common-to-all-keys base end may be formed with<br>
engagement portions, and the key frame may be provided with<br>
a mechanism such as pawls for being engaged with the<br>
engagement portions, by which the common-to-all-keys base<br>
end is pressed downward.<br>
[0098]     In considering, with reference to the above<br>
described embodiments, a minimum construction for mounting<br>
the key unit to the key frame and preventing the key unit<br>
from being detached from the key frame using elastic<br>
deformation with a simple operation, it is enough to<br>
construct at least one of the common-to-all-keys base end<br>
and the key frame so as to be able to be elastically<br>
deformed and provide a mechanism for restricting the<br>
position of the common-to-white-keys base end of the<br>
stacked common-to-all-keys base end relative to the key<br>
frame in the vertical direction and the left-to-right<br>
direction at some part of the common-to-white-keys base<br>
end.  Such a position restricting mechanism is not<br>
26<br><br>
necessary to have the common-to-black-keys base end, as<br>
described above.  In particular, in the case of the white<br>
key unit formed by two or more divided units, it is enough<br>
to provide a mechanism for restricting the positional<br>
relationship between the common base ends of the divided<br>
units.<br>
[0099]     It should be noted that although the hinges 24<br>
to 26 are extended in the vertical direction in the above<br>
described embodiments, it is enough, from the viewpoint of<br>
reducing the depth size of the keyboard apparatus as small<br>
as possible and improving the locus of the key depression<br>
surfaces 27a, 28a, to construct these hinges so as to cross<br>
the key depression surfaces 27a and extend in parallel to<br>
the key arrangement direction.  For example, therefore, the<br>
hinges 24 to 26 may obliquely extend downward rearward.<br>
Furthermore, the common base end may not extend parallel to<br>
the hinges 24 to 26 and may not be equal in thickness from<br>
one another.  There may be a step difference between the<br>
hinges 24 to 26 as viewed in the front-to-rear direction.<br>
27<br><br>
