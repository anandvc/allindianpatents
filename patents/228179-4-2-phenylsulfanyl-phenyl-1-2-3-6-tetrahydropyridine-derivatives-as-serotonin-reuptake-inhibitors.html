4-(2-Phenylsulfanyl-phenyI)-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine derivatives as serotonin reuptake inhibitors<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds which are serotonin reuptake inhibitors and as such effective in the treatment of for example depression and anxiety.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (hereinafter referred to as SSRIs) have become first choice therapeutics in the treatment of depression, certain forms of anxiety and social phobias, because they are effective, well tolerated and have a favourable safety profile compared to the classic tricyclic antidepressants.<br>
However, clinical studies on depression indicate that non-response to SSRIs is substantial, up to 30%. Another, often neglected, factor in antidepressant treatment is compliance, which has a rather profound effect on the patient's motivation to continue<br>
pharmacotherapy.<br>
First of all, there is the delay in therapeutic effect of SSRIs. Sometimes symptoms even worsen during the first weeks of treatment. Secondly, sexual dysfunction is a side effect common to all SSRIs. Without addressing these problems, real progress in the pharmacotherapy of depression and anxiety disorders is not likely to happen.<br>
In order to cope with non-response, psychiatrists sometimes make use of augmentation strategies. Augmentation of antidepressant therapy may be accomplished through the co-administration of mood stabilizers such as lithium carbonate or triiodothyronin or by the use of electroshock.<br>
The effect of combined administration of a compound that inhibits serotonin reuptake and a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist has been evaluated in several studies (Innis et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol 1987, 143, 1095-204 and Gartside Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995, 115, 1064-1070, Blier et al. Trends in Pharmacol Science 1994, 15, 220). In these studies,<br><br>
it was found that 5-HT1A receptor antagonists would abolish the initial brake on 5-HT leurotxansmission induced by the serotonin reuptake inhibitors and thus produce an mmediate boost of 5-HT transmission and a rapid onset of therapeutic action.<br>
Several patent applications have been filed, which cover the use of a combination of a 5-HTIA antagonist and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor for the treatment of depression (see e.g. EP-A2-687472 and EP-A2-714663).<br>
Another approach to increase terminal 5-HT would be through blockade of the 5-HTIB autoreceptor. Microdialysis experiments in rats have indeed shown that increase of hippocampal 5-HT by citalopram is potentiated by GMC 2-29, an experimental 5-HTIB receptor antagonist.<br>
Several patent applications covering the combination of an SSRI and a 5-HTIB antagonist or partial agonist have also been filed (WO 97/28141, WO 96/03400, EP-A-701819 and WO 99/13877).<br>
It has previously been found that the combination of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with a compound having 5-HT2C antagonistic or inverse agonistic effect (compounds having a negative efficacy at the 5-HT2C receptor) provides a considerable increase in the level of 5-HT in terminal areas, as measured in microdialysis experiments (WO 01/41701). This would imply a shorter onset of antidepressant effect in the clinic and an augmentation or potentiation of the therapeutic effect of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI).<br>
The combined effect of serotonin reuptake inhibition and norepinephrine uptake inhibition on depression is explored in clinical studies of compounds such as Duloxetine (Wong, Duloxetine (LY-248686): an inhibitor of serotonin and noradrenaline uptake and an antidepressant drug candidate Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs, 1993,7,10,1691-1699) and Venlafaxine (Khan-A et al, Venlafaxine in depressed outpatients Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1991, 27,141-144).<br><br>
The present invention provides compounds which are serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Some of the compounds also have a combined effect of serotonin reuptake inhibition and 5-HT2c receptor modulation, which according to WO01/41701 would imply a faster onset of antidepressant activity. Moreover, some of the compounds posses the combined effect of serotonin reuptake inhibition and norepinephrine uptake inhibition. Basically, the present compounds are suitable for the treatment of affective disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders including general anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, panic attacks, specific phobias, social phobia and agoraphobia.<br>

Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceuticallyacceptable carriers or excipients, in either single or multiple doses. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable earners or diluents as well as any other known adjuvants and excipients in accordance with conventional techniques such as those disclosed in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19 Edition, Gennaro, Ed.5 Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1995.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be specifically formulated for administration by any suitable route such as the oral, rectal, nasal, pulmonary, topical (including buccal and sublingual), transdermal, intracisternal, intraperitoneal, vaginal and parenteral (including subC1-6taneous, intramusC1-6lar, intrathecal, intravenous and intradermal) route, the oral route being preferred. It will be appreciated that the preferred route will depend on the general condition and age of the subject to be treated, the nature of the condition to be treated and the active ingredient chosen.<br>
Pharaiaceutical compositions for oral administration include solid dosage forms such as capsules, tablets, dragees, pills, lozenges, powders and granules. Where appropriate, they can be prepared with coatings such as enteric coatings or they can be formulated so as to provide controlled release of the active ingredient such as sustained or prolonged release according to methods well known in the art.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include solutions, emulsions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous and nonaqueous injectable solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders to be reconstituted in sterile injectable solutions or dispersions prior to use.
