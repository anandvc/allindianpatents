BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a piping structure for<br>
supplying and discharging a fluid to a bladder provided in a<br>
tire vulcanizing machine.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
The tire vulcanizing rrachine is provided with upper and<br>
lower metal molds and a bladder expanded and contracted by<br>
supplying and discharging the fluid, and is structured such as<br>
to vulcanize a raw tire by pressing the bladder expanded by<br>
supplying the fluid to an inner surface of the raw tire which<br>
is set to an inner portion of the metal molds.<br>
A main pipe is connected to an inner portion of the bladder,<br>
and a plurality of branch pipes (a steam supply pipe, a gas supply<br>
pipe, a shaving gas supply pipe, a gas recovery pipe, an exhaust<br>
pipe and the like) are connect ed to the main pipe via a plurality<br>
of valves.<br>
As mentioned above, a plurality of branch pipes are<br>
connected to the main pipe via a plurality of valves,<br>
respectively.<br>
In conventional, the piping structure of each of the valves<br>
and each of the branch pipes with respect to the main pipe employs<br><br>
a two-way, three-way or four-way switch valve having a flange<br>
or an inside screw and an cutside screw, and a valve unit is<br>
formed by assembling them ;.n one position.<br>
In the case that the valve unit is formed in the manner<br>
mentioned above, it is possible to intend an effective<br>
utilization of a space, however, in the conventional structure,<br>
when connecting each of the valves and the branch pipes to the<br>
main pipe, the structure is made such that the pipe is processed<br>
in an optional shape such as thread cutting the pipe and welding<br>
the flange, and the valve unit is finally formed by combining<br>
a lot of these pipes and valves.<br>
Accordingly, in the conventional structure, the piping<br>
structure becomes complicated and constrained by a lot of pipes<br>
and flanges, so that there are problems that a lot of labor hour<br>
is required for keeping the pipes warm, a lot of labor hour is<br>
required for replacing the valves for maintenance. Further,<br>
in the case of securing an area for operating and maintaining<br>
the valves, there is a problem that the valve unit is enlarged<br>
in size.<br>
Further, since a lot cf pipes are complexly placed and<br>
the pipes are arranged approximately horizontally, there is also<br>
a problem that a drain is hard to be get out from the pipes due<br>
to an accumulation of the drain.<br>
The present invention is made for the purpose of solving<br>
the conventional problems mentioned above, and an object of the<br>
present invention is to provide a piping structure in a tire<br>
vulcanizingmachine which has a simple structure, has an improved<br><br>
operability of a valve, can easily execute a maintenance work<br>
such as a valve replacement, and can form a compact valve unit<br>

valves 5 is arranged at. the lowest position as in the embodiment,<br>
it is also possible to discharge the drain flowing down to the<br>
lower end of the main f Low path at a stroke, thus the time required<br>
for discharging the drain can be shorten, so that a cycle time<br>
for vulcanizing the tire can be shorten.<br>
In this case, in the embodiment mentioned above, the number<br><br>
of the block main body 30 of the panel block 3 is set to one,<br>
and the fluid supply flow path 31 and the fluid discharge flow<br>
path 32 which serve as the main flow path are formed in the block<br>
main body 30, however, the structure may be made such that the<br>
number of the block main body is set to two, the fluid supply<br>
flow path serving as the main flow path is formed in one block<br>
main body, and the fluid discharge flow path serving as the main<br>
flow path is formed in the other block main body.<br>
Further, a plurality of panel valves are not limited to<br>
five valves mentioned above (the steam supply valve, the gas<br>
supply valve, the shaving gas supply valve, the gas recovery<br>
valve and the exhaust Valve) , and include the other fluid<br>
supplying valves and the discharge valves for the other purposes<br>
