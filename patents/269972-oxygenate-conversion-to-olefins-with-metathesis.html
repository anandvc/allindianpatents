				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]      This inventi(Mi relates generally to the conversion of oxygoiates to olefins and, more particularly, to light olefins.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0QQ2]      A miyor portion ctf the woddwide petrochemical industry is in involved with the productujn of li^t olefm materials and their sidsequent use in the productitm of numerous important chemical products via polymerization, oligomerization, alkylation and the like well-known chemical reactions. Light olefms include ethylene, propylene and mixtures thereof. These light olefins are essential building blocks for the modem petrodiemical and chemical industries. The major source for these materials in present day refining is the stream cracking of petroleum feeds. For various reasons including geographical, economic, political and diminished supply considerations, the art has long sought a source other than petroleum for the massive quantities of raw materials that are needed to supply the demand for these light olefin materials.<br>
[0003]      The search for alternative materials for light olefin production has led to the use of oxygenates such as alcohols and, more particularly, to the use of methanol, ethanol, and higher alcohols or their derivatives such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, etc., for example. Molecular sieves such as niicroporous crystalliiK zeolite ami non-zeolite catalysts, particularly silicoaluminophosf^ates (S APO), are known to promote the conversion of oxygenates to hydrocarbon mixtures, particularly hydrocarbon mixtures composed largely of light olefins.<br>
[0004]       Such processing of oxygenates to form light olefins is commonly referred to as a methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process, as methanol alone or together with other oxygenate materials such as dimethyl ether (DME) is typically an oxygenate material most commonly employed therein. In practice, such oxygenate conversion processing arrangements commonly produce ethylene and propylene as main products and, as stand alone processing, can achieve propylene to ethylene product ratios up to 1.4. In addition to the production of ethylene and propylene as main products, such processing also typically produces or results in smaller relative amounts of highly olefinic C4 and heavier hydrocarbon streams.<br>
 [0005]       A process for the production of light olefms comprising olefins having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms per moleoile from oxygenate feedstock generally typically involves passing the oxygenate feedstock to an oxygenate conversion zone containing a metal aluminophosphate catalyst to {M-oduce a light olefin stream. The light olefm stream is fractionated and a portion 5      of the products arc met^esized to enhance the yield of ethylene, propylene and/or butylene products. Propylene can be metathesized to produce more ethylene, or a combination of ethylene and biUei can he metathesized to produce more propylene. The combination of light olefln {H'oduction and metathesis or dispropoitionation is disclosed as providing flexibility sudi as to overcome the equilibrium limitations of the metal aluminophosphate<br>
      catalyst in the oxygenate conversion zone. In addition, the invention thereof is disclosed as providing the advantage of extended catalyst life and greater catalyst stability in the oxygenate conversion zone.<br>
[0006]      While such processing can desirably result in die formation of increased relative amounts of propylene, further improvements such as to fiorther enhance the relative amount<br>
      of propylene production and recovery are desired and have been sought.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]       A general object of the invention is to provide or result in improved processing of<br>
an oxygenate-containing feedstock to light olefins.<br>
[0(M)8]      A more specific objective of the invention is to overcome one or more of the<br>
      problems described above.<br>
[0008]      The general object of the invention can be attained, at least in part, through a specified process for producing light olefms from an oxygenate-containing feedstock. In accordance with one embodiment, such a process involves contacting the oxygenate-containing feedstock in an oxygenate conversion reactor with an oxygenate<br>
      conversion catalyst and at reaction conditions effective to convert the oxygenate-containing feedstock to form an oxygenate conversion effluent stream which includes light olefins and C4+ hydrocarhons, wherein the light olefins comprises ethylene and the C4+ hydrocarbons comprise a quantity of butenes including a quantity of 1-butenes and a quantity of isobutenes. The oxygenate conversion effluent stream is separated and forms a first process stream<br>
      comprising at least a portion of the butenes, including at least a portion of the quantity of 1 -butenes and at least a portion of the quantity of isobutenes, from the oxygenate conversion<br>
effluent stream. At least a portion of the quantity of butenes from the first process stream is contacted with a metathesis catalyst in a metathesis zone at effective conditions to produce a metathesis effluent stream comprising propylene. At least a portion of this propylene is desirably recovered from the metathesis effluent stream. In accordance with certain 5      embodiments, the first process stream additionally comprises a quantity of 2-butenes which, upon coiUact with the metathesis catalyst, cross-metathesize with at least a portion of the 1-butenes from the first process stream to produce propylene.<br>
[0010]      The prior art generally fails to provide processing schemes and arrangements for the conversion of an oxygenate-containing feedstock to olefins that maximizes production of<br>
      propylene to as great an extent as may be desired. Moreover, the prior art generally fails to provide a processing scheme and arrangement as effective and efficient as may be desired in increasing the relative yield of propylene in association with the conversion of oxygenate materials to light olefins.<br>
 [00ll]       A process for producing light olefins from an oxygenate-containing feedstock in<br>
       accordance with another embodiment involves contacting the oxygenate-containing feedstock in an oxygenate conversion reactor with an oxygenate conversion catalyst and at reaction conditions effective to convert the oxygenate-containing feedstock to produce an oxygenate conversion effluent stream comprising light olefins and C4+ hydrocarbons. The light olefins desirably include ethylene. The C4+ hydrocarbons desirably include a quantity of butenes<br>
      including a quantity of 1-butenes and a quantity of isobutenes. The oxygenate conversion effluent stream is treated to form a first process stream comprising at least a portion of the butenes including a portion of the quantity of 1-butenes and a portion of the quantity of isobutenes from the oxygenate conversion eflluent stream. At least a portion of the quantity of isobutenes from the first process stream is converted in an isobutene conversion zone to<br>
      form a second process stream including a quantity of 1-butenes and a third process stream including a conversion product. At least a portion of the quantity of I-butenes from the second process stream is isomerized in an isomerization zone to produce an isomerized stream comprising a quantity of 2-butenes. At least a portion of the 2-butenes from the isomerized stream is contacted with ethylene in a metathesis zone at effective conditions to<br>
       produce a metathesis effluent stream comprising propylene. Propylene is desirably recovered from the metathesis effluent stream.<br>
[0012]       There is also provided a system for producing light olefins from an oxygenate-containing feedstock. In accordance with one embodiment, such a system includes a reactor for contacting an oxygenate-containing feedstock with an oxygenate conversion catalyst and converting the oxygenate-containing feedstock to form an oxygenate conversion 5      effluent stream comprising light olefins and C4+ hydrocarbons, wherein the light olefins comprises ethylene and tt^ €4-4- hydrocarbons comprise a quantity of butenes including a quantity of l-butenes and a quantity of isobutenes. A separation zone is {nrovided for separating the oxygenate conversion effluent stream and forming a first process stream comprising at least a portion of the quantity of butenes, iiK;luding at least a portion of the<br>
      quantity of l-butenes and at least a portion of the quantity of isobutenes, fi^om the oxygenate conversion effluent stream. A metathesis zone is provided for contacting at least a portion of the butenes from the first process stream with a metathesis catalyst to produce a metathesis effluent stream comprising propylene. The system further includes a recovery zone wherein in propylene is recovered from the metathesis effluent stream. In accordance with certain<br>
      embodiments, the metathesis zone can comprise a reaction with distillation column<br>
containing a fixed bed of the metathesis catalyst wherein at least a portion of the quantity of butenes from the first process stream is contacted with ethylraie to produce the metathesis effluent stream comprising opylene. The system can additionally include an isomerization zone, interposed between the separation zone and the metathesis zone, for isomerizing at least<br>
      a portion of the quantity of l-butenes from the first process stream to form an isomerized stream comprising a quantity of 2-butenes which can be subsequently metathesized in the metathesis zone to produce prcylene. The system can also include an isobutene conversion zone wherein at least a portion of the quantity of isobutenes from the first process stream is converted to methyl tert-butyl ether.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
       [0022]      Oxygeuate-containing feedstock can be converted to light olefins in a catalytic reaction. Heavier hydrocarbons (e.g., C4+ hydrocarbons) formed during such processing can be subsequently treated such that at least a portion of a quantity of butenes formed upon such conversion are metathesized to produce additional {nx)pylene. [0023]       As will be appreciated such processing may be embodied in a variety of<br>
      processing syrangements. As representative, FIG. 1 illustrates a simplified schematic process flow diagram for a processing scheme, generally designated with the reference numeral 10, for the conversion of oxygenates to olefins and employing a metathesis zone to enhance the yield of propylene, in accordance with one embodiment. [0024]      More piuticulariy, an oxygenate-containing feedstock or feedstream 12 such as<br>
      generally composed of light oxygenates such as one or more of methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, or combinations thereof, is introduced into an oxygenate conversion zone or reactor section 14 via lines 11,13 and 15 wherein the oxygenate-containing feedstock 12 contacts an oxygenate conversion catalyst at reaction conditions effective to convert the oxygenate-containing feedstock to form an oxygenate conversion effluent stream comprising<br>
      fuel gas hydrocarbons, light olefins, and C4+ hydrocarbons, in a manner as is known in the ait, such as, for example, utilizing a fixed, moving or fluidized bed reactor. [0025]       As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art and guided by the teachings herein provided, such a feedstock may be commercial grade methanol, crude methanol or any methanol purity therebetween. Crude methanol may be an unrefined product from a methanol<br>
      synthesis imit. Those skilled in the art and guided by the teachings herein provided will<br>
understand and appreciate that in the interest of factors such as improved catalyst stability, embodiments utilizing higher purity methanol feed may be preferred. Thus, suitable feeds in such embodiments may comprise methanol or a methanol and water blend, with possible such feeds having a methanol content of between 65% and 100% by weight, preferably a methanol<br>
      content of between 80% and 100% by weight and, in accordance with certain embodiments, a methanol content of between 95% and 100% by weight.<br>
 [0026]       A methanol-to-olefm unit feedstream may comprise between 0 and 35 wt-% and more preferably between 5 and 30 wt-% water. The methanol in the feedstream may comprise between 70 and 100 wt-% and more preferably between 75 and 95 wt-% of the feedstream. The ethanol in the feedstream may comprise between 0.01 and 0.5 wt-% and 5      more typically between 0.1 and 0.2 wt-% of the feedstream although higher concentrations may be beneficial. When medianol is the primary compon^t in the feedstream, the higher alcdiols in the feedstream comprise between 200 and 2000 wppm and more typically between 500 sfsid 1500 wppm. Additionally, when methanol is the primary component in the feedstream, diqicthyl ether may comprise between 100 and 20,000 wppm and more typically<br>
      between 200 and 10000 wppm.<br>
[0027]       The invention, however, also contemplates and encompasses embodiments wherein the oxygenate-containing feedstock includes dimethyl ether, either alone or in combination with water, methanol or in combination with both water and methanol, for example.<br>
       [0028]       Reaction conditions for the conversion of oxygenate to light olefins are known to those skilled in the art. Preferably, in accordance with particular embodiments, reaction conditions comprise a temper^xire between 200° and 700°C, more preferably between 300° and 600°C, and most preferably between 400° and 550°C. In addition, reactor operating pressures typically are preferably superatmospheric and such as generally range from 69 to<br>
      6S9 kPa (10 to 100 psig), as may be required to accommodate sufficient pressure at the compressor section.<br>
[0029] Hie oxygenate conversion reactor section 14 produces or results in formation of an oxygenate conversion reactor product or effluent stream 16 such as generally comprising fuel gas hydrocarbons, light olefins, and C4+ hydrocarbons. The oxygenate conversion<br>
      reactor effluent stream 16 is passed to an oxygenate treatment or recovery zone, generally designated by the reference numeral 18. The oxygenate recovery or treatment zone 18 generally typically includes one or more sections or units such as are known to those skilled in the art which can isolate, separate, remove and/or recycle various additional compounds or materials, such as, for example, excess oxygenate materials, water, oxygenate conversion<br>
      catalyst fines and/or acid gases, from the oxygenate conversion reactor effluent stream 16. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 1, the oxygenate conversion reactor effluent stream 16 may be treated in the oxygenate recovery zone 18 to produce or result in the formation of an<br>
oxygenate recycle stream 20 and an oxygenate conversion effluent stream 22 which comprises a quantity of light olefms including ethylene and a quantity of C4+ hydrocarbons including a quantity of butenes such as including a quantity of 1-butenes, a quantity of 2-butenes and a quantity of isobutenes. In accordance with certain embodiments, at least a 5      portion of the oxygenate recycle stream 20 can be combined with at least a portion of the oxygenate-containing feedstock 12 and such combined stream can be introduced into the oxygenate conversion zone 14 via the line 15.<br>
[0030]       The oxygenate conversion effluent stream 22 can be flirther processed in a separation or treatment zone 24 wherein the oxygenate conversion effluent stream 22, or at<br>
      least a portion thereof, may be separated or fractionated, such as by conventional distillation methods, to provide one or more process streams.<br>
[0031]       In accordance with certain embodiments, the oxygenate conversion effluent stream 22, or a select portion thereof, is passed to a deethanizer zone 26. In the deethanizer zone 26, the oxygenate conversion effluent stream 22 is fractionated, such as by conventional<br>
      distillation methods, such as to provide or form a deethanizer overhead stream 28 comprising C2- hydrocarbons including methane, ethane, ethylene, and possibly also some inert species (N2, CO, etc.), and a deethanized C3+ bottoms stream 30 comprising con^)onents heavier than ethane, such as propylene, propane, mixed butenes and/or butane. The deethanizer overhead stream 28 or a portion thereof, such as, for example, a first portion 32, can be<br>
0      recycled to the oxygenate conversion zone 14. In practice, the first portion 32 of the<br>
deethanizer overhead stream 28 can be introduced directly into the oxygenate conversion zone 14. Alternatively, the first portion 32 of the deethanizer overhead stream can be combined with the oxygenate-containing feedstock 12 and/or the oxygenate recycle stream 20 and such combined stream can be introduced into the oxygenate conversion zone 14 via<br>
      lines 13 and 15. Additionally or alternatively, the deethanizer overhead stream 28 or a portion thereof, such as, for example, a second portion 34, can be used as fuel. [0032]       The deethanized C3+ bottoms stream 30, or at least a portion thereof, is passed to a depropanizer zone 36. In the depropanizer zone 36 the deethanized C3+ bottoms stream 30 is treated or fractionated, such as by conventional distillation methods, to provide or form a<br>
      depropanizer overhead stream 38 comprising C3 materials and a depropanized stream 40 generally comprising C4+ components. The depropanizer overhead stream 38, or at least a portion thereof, is passed to a C3 splitter 42. In the C3 splitter 42, the depropanizer overhead<br>
stream 38 is treated, e.g., fractionated, such as by conventional distillation methods, to provide an overhead propylene product stream 44 such as generally composed of propylene and a bottoms stream 46 such as generally composed of propane. The propane-containing bottoms stream 46 or a pwtion thereof can be recycled to a front-end synthesis gas unit or, if 5      such unit is not readily avail^le, can be used as fuel.<br>
[0033]      Tlie deiwopanizcd stream 40, or at least a portion thereof, is passed to a C4 fractionation zone 48. In the C4 fractionation zone 48, the depropanized stream 40 is fractionated, such as by conventional distillation methods, to provide or form a mixed butenes stream 50 generally composed of 1-butenes, 2-butenes and is(*utenes, and a C4+<br>
      stream 52 generally comprising C4+ components (Hher than butene.<br>
[0034]       In practice, sudi C4+ stream 52 or a portion thereof can be passed to a heavy hydrocarixjn separation zone 54. In the heavy hydrocarbon separation zone 54, the C4+ stream 52 is fractionated, such as by conventional distillation methods, to provide or form an overhead stream 56 generally composed of C5 and/or C^ hydrocarbons and a bottoms stream<br>
      58 generally comprising components heavier than hexane. In practice, the overhead stream 56 or a portion there of can be directly recycled to the oxygenate conversion zone 14 for further processing- Alternatively, at least a portion of the overhead stream 56 can be combined with one or more of the oxygenate-containing feedstock 12, the oxygenate recycle stream 20, and the first portion 32 of the deethanizer overhead stream 28 and such combined stream can be<br>
      introduced into the oxygenate conversion zone 14 via Imes 11,13 and 15. In practice, the bottoms stream 58 or a portico thereof can be used as fuel. For example, for locations in proximity to refineries, such materials or select portions thereof can be blended into a gasoline pool. Additionally or alternatively, depending upon the specifications as to the olefin content in a feed to a synthesis gas unit, the bottoms stream 58 or a portion thereof can be<br>
      recycled to a front-end synthesis gas unit.<br>
[0035]      The mixed butenes stream 50, or at least a portion thereof, is introduced into a metathesis zone 60 and under effective conditions to produce a metathesis effluent stream 62 comprising propylene. [0034S[|       The metathesis reaction can generally be carried out under conditions and<br>
      employs catalysts such as are known in the art. In accordance with one embodiment, a metathesis catalyst such as containing a catalytic amount of at least one of nralybdenum oxide and tungsten oxide is suitable for the metathesis reaction. Conditions for the metathesis<br>
reaction generally include a reaction temperature ranging from 20° to 450°C, preferably 250° to 350°C, and pressures varying from atmospheric to upwards of 20.6 MPa gauge (3000 psig), preferably between 3000 to 3500 kPa gauge (435 to 510 psig), although higher pressures can be employed if desired. Catalysts which are active for the metathesis of olefins 5      and which can be used in the process of this invention are of a generally known type. In this regard, reference is made to JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS, 13 (1969) pages 99-114, to APPLIED CATALYSIS, 10 (1984) pages 29-229 and to CATALYSIS REVIEW, 3 (1) (1969) pages 37-60. The dispropMtionation (metathesis) of 1-buteiw with 2-butene can, for example, be carried out in the liquid phase over a metathesis catalyst at 20° to SO'C and at 0.5 to 2 MPa (75 to<br>
      290 psi).<br>
[0037]       Such metathesis catalysts may be homogeneous or heterogeneous, with the heterogeneous catalysts being preferred. The metathesis catalyst preferably comprises a catalytically effective amount of a transiticwi metal component. The preferred transition metals for use in the present invention include tungsten, molybdenum, nickel, rhenium, and<br>
      combinations thereof. TTie transition metal component may be present as elemental metal and/or one or more compounds of the metal. If the catalyst is heterogeneous, it is preferred that the transition metal component be associated with a suppcHt. Any suitable support material may be employed provided that it does not substantially interfere with the feedstock components or the lower olefin component conversion. Preferably, the support material is an<br>
      oxide, such as silica, alumina, titania, zirconia, and combinations thereof. Silica is a<br>
particularly preferred suppt material. If a support material is employed, the amount of transition metal component used in combination with the support material may vary widely, depending, for example, on the particular application involved and/or the transition metal being used. Preferably, the transition metal comprises 1% to 20%, by weight (calculated as<br>
      elemental n^tal) of the total catalyst. The metathesis catalyst advantageously comprise a catalytically effective amount of at least one of the above-noted transition metals, and are capable of promoting olefin metathesis. The catalyst may also contain at least one activating agent present in an amount to improve the effectiveness of the catalyst. Various activating agents may be employed, including activating agents which are well known in the art to<br>
      facilitate metathesis reactions. Light olefins metathesis catalysts can, for example, desirably be complexes o( tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), or rhenium (Re) in a heterogeneous or homogeneous phase.<br>
 [0038]       In accordance with one embodiment, the metathesis reaction carried out within the metathesis zone 60 is a cross-metathesis reaction wherein 1-butenes from the mixed butenes stream 50 are reacted with 2-butcnes from the mixed butenes stream 50 in the presence of a metathesis catalyst and at effective conditions to produce the metathesis effluent stream 62 5      predominantly composed of propylene and pentene. Generally, such cross-metathesis reaction is typically ccnulucted in the absence of or without the presence of signiflcant quantities of etfayl^ie. In practice, pentenes from the metathesis effluent stream 62 can be recycled to the oxygenate ctmversion zone 14. Alternatively, in acccvdance with certain embodiments, the pentenes from the metathesis effluent stream 62 can be recycled to the<br>
      separaticm zone 24.<br>
[0039]       Propylene is desirably recovered firom the metathesis effluent stream 62. In accordance with one embodiment, propylene is recovered by introducing the metathesis effluent stream 62, or a select portion thereof, into the separation zone 24. For example, the metathesis effluent stream 62, or at least a portion thereof, can be combined with the<br>
      oxygenate conversion effluent stream 22 and such combined stream can be introduced into the separation section 14 via a liiw 64 wherein propylene is recovered from such combined stream according to the processes described above in conjunction with the deethanizer zone 26, tlvs depropanizer zone 36 and the C3 splitter 42. [0040]       Alternatively, the metathesis effluent stream 62, or at least a portion thereof, can<br>
      be passed to a metathesis fracticniation zone (not shown) wherein the metathesis effluent stream 62 is resolved, e.g., fractionated, by conventional separation means into a product propylene stream and a higher hydrocaion fraction including butene which can be recycled back into the vocessing scheme such as, for example, back into the any one of the deethanizer zone 26, the dropanizer zone 36, the C4 fracticwiation zone 48, or the metathesis<br>
      zone 60. In enibodiments wherein such higher hydrocarbon fraction firom the metathesis fractionation zone is recycled to the metathesis zone 60, a drag stream may be provided to reduce the build-up of higher hydrocarlxm components such as, for example, isobutene. [0041]       In accordance with certain embodiments, and as described in further detail below in conjunction with FIG. 3, the mixed butenes stream 50, or at least a portion thereof, can be<br>
      treated in an isobutene conversion zone to remove at least a portion of the quantity of<br>
isobutenes from the mixed butenes stream 50 prior to contacting the metathesis catalysts in<br>
the metathesis zone 60. Removal of such isobutenes fraction firom the mixed butenes stream 50 prior to metathesis is generally, typically found to result in improved propylene yields. [0042]       In accordance with another embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 2, a processing scheme 100 for producing light olefins from an oxygenate-containing feedstock involves 5      introducing an oxygenate-containing feedstock or feedstream 102 such as generally<br>
composed of light oxygenates such as one or more of methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, or combinj^ons thereof, is introduced via lines 103 and 174 into an oxygenate conversion zone or reactor section 104 wherein the oxygenate-containing feedstock contacts an oxygenate conversion catalyst at reaction conditions effective to convert the<br>
      oxygenate-containing feedstock to form an oxygenate conversion reactor effluent stream 106 comprising fuel gas hydrocarbons, light olefins, and C4+ hydrocarbcms. [0043]       The oxygenate conversion reactor effluent stream 106, or at least a portion thereof, is passed to an oxygenate treatment or recovery zone, generally designated by the reference numeral 108. The oxygenate conversion reactor effluent stream 106 is treated in the<br>
      oxygenate recovery zone 108 to produce or result in the formation of an oxygenate recycle stream 110 and an oxygenate conversion effluent stream 112 which comprises a quantity of light olefins including ethylene and a quantity of C4+ hydrocarbons including a quantity of butenes such as including a quantity of 1-butenes, a quantity of 2-butenes and a quantity of isobutenes.<br>
      [0044]      In practice, the oxygenate recycle stream 110, or at least a portion thereof, can be introduced directly into the oxygenate conversion zone 104 for further processing. Alternatively, the oxygenate recycle stream 110 may be combined with the oxygenate feedstock 102 and introduced into the oxygenate conversion zone 104 via a line 174. [(0045]      The oxygenate conversion effluent stream 112, or at least a portion thereof, may<br>
      he further processed in a separation or treatment zone 114 wherein the oxygenate cwiversion effluent stream 112 may be separated or fractionated such as by conventional distillation methods, to provide one or m(»:e process streams.<br>
[0046]       In accordance with certain embodiments, the oxygenate conversion effluent stream 112, or at least a portion thereof, is passed to a depropanizer zone 116. In the<br>
      depropanizer zone 116, the oxygenate conversion effluent stream 112 is fractionated, such as by conventional distillation methods, such as to provide or form a depropanizer overhead stream 118 comprising C3- hydrocarbons including methane, ethane, ethylene, propane.<br>
propylene and possibly also some inert species (N2, CO, etc.), and a depropanized C4+ bottoms stream 120 comprising components heavier than propane, such as mixed butenes and/or butane.<br>
[0047]       The depropanizer C3- overhead stream 118, or at least a portion thereof, is passed 5      to a deethanizcr zone 122. In ttie deethanizcr zone 122 the depropanizer C3- overhead stream 118 is treated or fraction^ed, such as by conventional distillation methods, to provide or form a deethanizcr overhead stream 124 comprising C2- materials including ethylene and a deethanized stream 126 generally comprising €3 materials including propane and propylene. The deethanized stream 126, or at least a porticxi thereof, is passed to a C3 splitter 128. In the<br>
      C3 splitter 128, the deethanized stream 126 is treated, e.g., fractionated, such as by<br>
conventional distillation methods, to provide an overiiead propylene product stream 130 such as generally composed of propylene and a bottoms stream 132 such as generally composed of propane. The propane-containing bottoms stream 132, or a portion thereof, can be recycled to a front-end synthesis gas unit or, if such unit is not readily available, can be used as fuel.<br>
       [0048]      The depropanized stream 120, or at least a portion thereof, is passed to a C4 fractionation zone 134. In the C4 fractionation zone 134, the depropanized stream 120 is fractionated, such as by conventional distillation methods, to provide or form a mixed butenes stream 136 generally composed of 1-butenes, 2-butenes and isobutenes, and a C4+ stream 138 generally comprising C4+ components other than butene.<br>
      [0049]      In practice, the C4+ stream 138 or a portion thereof can be passed to a heavy hydrocarbon separation zone 140. In the heavy hydrocarbon separation zone 140, the C4+ stream 138 is fractionated, such as by conventional distillation methods, to jMrovide or form an overiiead stream 142 generally composed of C5 and/or C6 hydrocarbons aiKi a bottoms stream 144 generally comprising components heavier than hexane. In practice the overhead<br>
      stream 142 or a portitxi there of can be recycled to the oxygenate CMiversion zraie 104 such as, for example, via lines 172, 103 and 174, for further processing. In practice, the bottoms stream 144 or a portion thereof can be used as fuel. For example, for locations in proximity to refineries, such materials or select portions thereof can be blended into a gasoline pool. Additionally or alternatively, depending upon the specifications as to the olefin content in a<br>
      feed to a synthesis gas unit, the bottoms stream 144 or a portion thereof can be recycled to a front-end synthesis gas unit.<br>
[0050]       It has been found that the metathesis reaction of butenes with ethylene over a metathesis catalyst to pnMfaice propylene is favored where the butenes are in the form of 2-butenes rathw than l-butencs. Thus, in accordance with one embodiment, and as described in greater detail below, the mixed butenes stream 136, or at least a portion thereof, is passed 5      via the line 137 to an isomerization zone 146 for isomerizing at least a portion of the quantity of 1-butenes therein contained to form an isomerized stream 148 comprising an increased quantity of 2-butenes.<br>
[0051]       As will be appreciated, such isomerization of 1-butenes to 2-butenes can desirably occur ov a suitable isomerization catalyst at selected appropriate isomerization reaction<br>
      conditions. The l-butene to 2-butene isomerization reaction is actually a hydroisomerization as it is generally conducted in the presence of a hydrogen atmosphere to facilitate the double bond migration, but such that the use of hydrogen is minimized to avoid undesirable hydiogenation side reactions. The catalysts typically employed in such processing are commonly based on noble metals (palladium, rhodium, platinum, etc.) deposited on an inert<br>
      alumina suf^rt; palladium is normally preferred. Typical or usual reaction conditions may involve a temperature of 100° to 150°C and typically a pressure of 1.5 to 2 MPa (215 to 300 psia). The feed to the hydroisomerization reactor is usually preheated by exchange with the reactor effluent and by steam. Such a heated feed then enters the reactor, which typically operates in a mixed [ase with one or more catalyst beds. After cooling the isomerization<br>
      products are typically flashed to remove excess hydrogen gas. The reaction temperature is generally chosen so as to maximize conversion to 2-butene (favored by lower temperatures) while still having a reasonable rate of reaction; hence it is commonly desirable to operate at a temperature of less than 150°C. Desirably, the isomerized stream will contain 2-butene and 1-butene in a molar ratio of at least 8, e.g., at least 8 moles of 2-butenes per mole of 1-butenes,<br>
 and, in accordance with at least certain embodiments, a molar ratio of greater than 10, e.g., more than 10 moles of 2-butene per mole of l-butene. If fractionated, the residual l-butene can be recycled to the isomerization reactor.<br>
[0052]       At least a portion of the isomerized stream 148 and a quantity of ethylene, such as a portion of the above-described deethanizer overhead stream 124 via a line 150, are<br>
      introduced into a metathesis zone 154 to produce a metathesis effluent stream 156 comprising propylene. In accordance with certain embodiments, a drag or purge line 152 drawn off line 150 can be provided to avoid undesired build-up of carbon dioxide (CO) or other nonreacting<br>
materials (e.g., ethane) that might otherwise accumulate in the process loop. Alternatively or additionally, a demethanizer zone can be disposed between the deethanizer zone 122 and the metathesis zoiw 154 to treat, e.g., fractionate, the deethanizer overhead stream 124 to provide a demethanized stream comprising ethylene which can be introduced into the metathesis zone 5       154 via the line 150. Such tre^ment of the deethanizer overhead stream 124 in the<br>
demethanizer zone can generally typically be employed to avoid ibs undesired build-up of carbon dioxide in the metathesis zone 154 and to prolong the life of the metathesis catalyst. [0053]      The metathesis reaction can generally employ catalysts such as described in detail above in conjunction with the metathesis zone 60 as illustrated in FIG. 1. Generally, the<br>
      disproportionation (metathesis) of 2-butene with ethylene can, for example, be carried out in the vapor phase at 300° to 350'C and 0.5 MPa absolute (75 psia) with a WHSV of 50 to 100 and a once-thrdngh conversion of 15%, depending on the ethylene to 2-but«ie ratio. [0054]      Propylene is desirably recovered from the metathesis effluent stream 156. In accordaaice with one embodiment, at least a portion of the metathesis effluent stream 156 can<br>
      be recycled into the separation or treatment zone 114. For example, at least a portion of the metathesis effluent stream 156 can be combined with at least a portion of the oxygenate conversion effluent stream 112 and a combined stream 160 can be introduced into the separation zone 114 wherein propylene can be recovered from the combined stream 160 according to the process described above in conjunction with operation of the deprq)anizer<br>
      zone 116, the deethanizer zorw 122 and the C3 splitter 128.<br>
[0(055]       In accordance with certain embodiments, the metathesis zone 154 can comprise a reaction with distillation column 162 containing a fixed bed 164 of the metathesis catalyst. The reaction with distillation column 162 generally includes a stripping section 166, disposed below the fixed catalyst bed 164, containing a distillation structure such as, for example, trays<br>
      or inert packing as is known in the art and a distillation section 168, disposed above the fixed catalyst bed 164, containing a distillation structure as is known in the art. [0056]       Suitable metathesis catalysts for use in the fixed bed 164 generally, typically include supported oxides of cobalt, molybdenum, rhenium or mixtures of cobalt and molybdenum oxides. Suitable supports for the oxides include, for example, silica and<br>
       alumina. Typically, the reaction with distillation colurrm is operated at a pressure effective to result in a fixed catalyst bed temperature of 100° to 200°C.<br>
 [0057]       Li practice, 2-butenes from the isomerized stream 148 arc introduced into the reaction with distillation column 162 above the fixed catalyst bed 164 and ethylene, via the line 150, is introduced below the fixed catalyst bed 164. The ethylene flows upward into the fixed bed 164 and reacts with 2-butenc to produce propylene which is removed via the 5      overhead metathesis effluent stream 156. The distillation section 168 above the fixed bed 164 separates unreacted 2-butenc ftom propylene and recycles the 2-butene to fixed catalyst bed 164. Generally, 2-butcnc is present in an excess relative to ethylene, e.g., a ratio of 25:1 2-butene to ethylene. A metathesis bottoms stream 170 is provided to remove any heavier components, i.e., compopeitfs heavier than pentane, produced during tiiie metathesis reaction<br>
      from the reaction with distillation column 162.<br>
[0058]      In accordance with certain embodiments, at least a portion of the metathesis bottoms stream 170 can be recycled to the oxygenate conversion zone 104 for further processing. For example, at least a portion of the metathesis bottoms stream 170 can be combined with at least a portion of the overhead stream 142 and such combined stream can<br>
      be fed directly to the oxygenate conversion zone 104. Alternatively, the combined stream can be combined with the oxygenate feedstock 102 and introduced into the oxygenate conversion zone 104 via lines 172,103 and 174. Alternatively, in accordance with certain other embodiments, the metathesis bottoms stream 170, or at least a portion thereof, can be recycled to the isomerization zone 146.<br>
      [0059]      In accordance with another embodiment, the processing scheme 100 may further include an isobutene ccmversim zone disposed between the C4 fractionation zone 134 and the isomerization zone 146. As discussed in greater detail below, and in conjunction with FIG. 3, at least a portion of the mixed butojcs stream 136 may be treated in the isobutene conversion zone to remove at least a portion of the quantity of isobutencs from the mixed butencs stream<br>
       146 prior to isomerization of at least a portion of the 1-butencs in the isomerization zone 146. [0060]       In accordance with certain other embodiments, the processing scheme can further include a C4 purge stream 176 to avoid undesired build-up of heavy hydrocarbons or other nonreacting materials (e.g., saturates) and, particularly, isobutenes that might otherwise accumulate in the process loop. The C4 purge stream 176 can be disposed between the C4<br>
 fractionation section 134 and the isomerization section 146, i.e., drawn off from the mixed butenes stream 136, as illustrated in FIG. 2. Alternatively, the C4 purge stream 176 may be disposed between the isomerization zone 146 and the metathesis zone 154, i.e., drawn off<br>
from the isomerized stream 148. Alternatively or additionally, a purge stream can be drawn off the metathesis bottoms stream 170.<br>
[0061]       In accordance with a further embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 3, a processing scheme 200 for producing light olefms from an oxygenate-containing feedstock involves 5      introducing an oxygenate-containing feedstock or feedstream 202 such as generally<br>
composed of light oxygenates such as one or more of methanol, ethail, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether,  combinations thereof, is introduced via lis 203,205 and 211 into an oxygenate conversion zone w reactor section 204 wherein the oxygenate-containing feedstock cont£M;:ts an oxygenate conversicm catalyst at reaction ccsiditimis effective to<br>
      convert the oxygenate-containing feedstock to form an oxygenate ccmversion reactor effluent stream 206 comprising fuel gas hydrocarbons, light olefms, and C4+ hydrocarbons. In accordance with certain embodiments, the oxygenate-containing feedstock 202 desirably comprises methanol. [0062]      The oxygenate conversicm reactor effluent stream 206, or at least a portion<br>
      thereof, is passed to an oxygenate treatment or recovery zone, generally designated by the<br>
reference numeral 208. The oxygenate conversion reactor effluent stream 206 is treated in the oxygenate recovery zone 208 to produce or result in the formation of an oxygenate recycle stream 210 and an oxygenate conversion effluent stream 212 which comprises a quantity of light olefms including ethylene and a quantity of C4+ hydrocarbons including a quantity of<br>
      butenes such as including a quantity of 1-butcnes, a quantity of 2-butenes and a quantity of isobutenes.<br>
[0063] In (M'actice, the oxygenate recycle stream 210 can be intnxluced directly into the oxygenate conversion zone 204 for further processing. Alternatively, the oxygenate recycle stream 210 may be combined with the oxygenate feedstock 202 and introduced into the<br>
      oxygenate conversion zraie 204 via the line 211. In accordance with certain embodiments, the oxygenate recycle stream 210 desirably comprises a quantity of methanol. [0064]      The oxygenate conversion effluent stream 212 can be ftirther processed in a separation or treatment zone 214 wherein at least a portion of the oxygenate ccmversion effluent stream 212 is passed via a line 268 to a deethanizer zone 216. In the deethanizer zone<br>
      216, the oxygenate conversion effluent stream 212 is fractionated, such as by conventional distillation methods, such as to provide or form a deethanizer overhead stream 218 comprising C2- hydrocarbons including methane, ethane, ethylene, and possibly also some<br>
inert species (N, CO, etc.), and a deethanized C3+ bottoms stream 220 comprising components heavier than ethane, such as propylene, propane, mixed butenes and/or butane. [0065]      The deethanized C3+ bottoms stream 220, or at least a portion thereof, is passed to a depropanizer zone 222. In the depropanizer zone 222 the deethanized C3+ bottoms stream 5      220 is treated or fractioned, such as by conventional distillation methods, to provide or form a depropanizer overtiead stream 224 comprising C3 materials and a depropanized stream 226 generally comprising C4+ con^nents. The depropanizer oveiiiead stream 224 is passed to a C3 splitter 228. In the C3 splitter 228, the depropanizer overhead stream 224, or at least a portion thereof, is treated, e.g., fractionated, such as by conventional distillation methods, to<br>
      provide an overhead propylene product stream 230 such as generally composed of propylene and a bottoms stream 232 such as generally composed of propane. The propane-containing bottoms stream 232, or a portion thereof, can be recycled to a front-end synthesis gas unit or, if such unit is not readily available, can be used as fuel. [0066]      The depropanized stream 226, or at least a portion thereof, is passed to a C4<br>
       fractionation zone 234. In the C4 fractionation zone 234, the depropanized stream 226 is fractionated, such as by conventional distillation methods, to provide or form a mixed butenes stream 236 generally composed of 1-butenes, 2-butenes and isobutenes, and a C4+ stream 238 generally comfMising C4+ components other than butene. [0067]       In practice, the €4+ stream 238, or at least a portion thereof, can be passed to a<br>
      heavy hydrocarbon separation zone 240. In the heavy hydrocarbon separation zone 240, the C4+ stream 238 is fractionated, such as by conventional distillation methods, to provide or form an overhead stream 242 generally composed of C5 and/or Q hydrocarbons and a bottoms stream 244 generally comjnising components heavier than hexane. In practice, the overhead stream 242, or a portion thereof, can be recycled to the oxygenate conversion zone<br>
      204 such as, for example, via lines 243, 203, 205 and 211, for fiirther processing. In practice, the bottoms stream 244, or at least a portion thereof, can be used as fuel. For example, for locations in proximity to refineries, such materials or select portions thereof can be blended into a gasoline pool. Additionally or alternatively, depending upon the specifications as to the olefin content in a feed to a synthesis gas unit, the bottoms stream 244 or a portion thereof<br>
      can be recycled to a front-end synthesis gas unit.<br>
[0068]       It has been found that reduction or removal of at least a portion of the quantity of isobutenes from the mixed butenes stream 236 can beneficially improve the yield of<br>
propylene from the process. Accordingly, in one embodiment, at least a portion of the mixed butenes stream 236 is passed to an isobutene conversion zone 246 wherein at least a portion of the quantity of isobutenes from the mixed butenes stream 236 is converted to produce a conversion product at least a portion of which can be removed from and/or recycled into the 5      process 200.<br>
[0069]      For example, at least a portion of the quantity of isobutenes from the mixed butenes stream 236 can be converted by reacting the isobutenes with an oxygenate-containing material such as, for example, methanol, ethanol or a combination thereof, to produce a second process stream 248 including a quantity of 1-butenes and a third process stream 250<br>
      including a tertiary ether or alcohol product. In accordance with certain embodiments, at least a portion of the mixed butenes stream 236 including a quantity of isobutenes is combined with a methanol-ccmtaining material in the presence of an acid catalyst to [»:oduce the third process steam 250 including methyl tert-butyl ether. In accordance with certain other embodiments, at least a portion of the third process stream 250 can form a methyl tert-butyl<br>
      ether product stream wherein such methyl tert-butyl ether can be utilized as a gasoline additive.<br>
[0070]       In accordance with one embodiment, a portion of the oxygenate-containing feedstock 202 can be passed via a line 252 to the isobutene conversion 246 to react with at least a portion of the quantity isobutenes from the mixed butenes stream 236. At least a<br>
      portion of the third process stream 250 can be recycled to the oxygenate conversion zone 204 to produce an additional quantity of light olefins. For example, at least a portion of the third process stream 250 can be introduced directly into the oxygenate conversion zone 204. Alternatively, at least a portion of the third process stream 250 can be combined with the oxygenate-containing feedstock 202 and/or the overhciKl stream 242 and introduced into the<br>
      oxygenate conversion zcmc 204 via the lines 243, 203,205 and 211.<br>
[0071]       In accordance with another embodiment, the isobutene conversion zone 246 may desirably incorporate both a reaction step and a fractionation step. For example, the isobutene conversion zoi^ 246 can include a reaction with distillation column) wherein at least a portion of the quantity of isobutenes from the mixed butenes stream 236 are reacted with an<br>
      oxygenate-containing material such as methanol and the resulting reaction products are fractionated to form the second process stream 248 and the third process stream 250.<br>
 [0072]       In accordance with a further embodiment, at least a portion of the quantity of isobutenes from the mixed butenes stream 236 can be converted by dimerizing the isobutenes with 1-butenes aikl/or 2-butenes from the mixed butenes stream 236 over an acid catalyst to produce a dimerization effluent stream comprising 1-butenes, 2-butenes, a reduced quantity 5      of isobutenes, and a conversion jn'oduct such as comprising Cg and/or C|2 hydrocarbons. The dimerization effluent stream can be resolved, i.e., fractionated, by conventional distillation means to produce the second process stream 248 and the third process stream 250 comprising the conversion product. [0073]       The dimerization reaction can generally be carried out in a dimerization unit or<br>
