				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a videophone interpretation system and a videophone<br>
interpretation method which provide an interpretation service for a conversation with a<br>
videophone between persons using different languages, and in particular to a videophone<br>
interpretation system and a videophone interpretation method which provide administration<br>
services such as those offered by a public office, a hospital and a police station, to a foreigner<br>
incapable of using the local language, without an interpreter being resident in an administrative<br>
body mentioned above.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, persons in remote locations have come to converse with each other at a practical<br>
level by using a videophone, on the strength of development of communications technologies.<br>
In order for persons who use different languages to converse smoothly with each other, an<br>
interpreter is required. It is thus desired that an interpretation service with a videophone will<br>
become widely available.<br>
In the prior art, in order to obtain an interpretation service with a videophone, a three-way call<br>
had to be established by using a multipoint conferencing unit offering a teleconference service<br>
between a caller wishing to have a conversation, a callee as a conversation partner, and an<br>
interpreter who interprets between a language used by the caller and a language used by the<br>
callee.<br>
Fig. 22 shows a prior art configuration whereby an interpretation service is obtained by using a<br>
video conference service with a multipoint conferencing unit. In Fig. 22, a numeral 10<br>
represents a videophone terminal for the caller (hereinafter referred to as a caller terminal), 20 a<br>
videophone terminal for the callee (hereinafter referred to as a callee terminal), 30 a videophone<br>
terminal for the interpreter (hereinafter referred to as an interpreter terminal), 50 a public<br>
telephone line, and 1 a multipoint conferencing unit. Each videophone terminal comprises a<br>
camera (a) for picking up the user, a display (b) for displaying a received video, a dial pad (c) for<br>
dialing the number of a distent party, a headset (d) including a microphone for acquiring the<br>
voice of the user and listening to the received audio. The multipoint conferencing unit 1 offers a<br>
videoconferencing service and has a function to accept a call from a reserved terminal,<br>
synthesizing videos and audios transmitted from the terminals connected and transmitting to each<br>
terminal the synthesized video and audio.<br>
Next, the procedure used to obtain an interpretation service using the multipoint conferencing<br>
unit will be described. First, a caller searches for and calls an interpreter capable of interpreting<br>
between the language used by the caller and that used by the callee. Next, the called interpreter<br>
calls the callee based on the request made by the caller and determines a conversation date/time.<br>
When the conversation date/time is determined, the caller reserves a teleconferencing at the<br>
multipoint conferencing unit 1. The caller, the callee and the interpreter check in to the<br>
multipoint conferencing unit 1 with respective videophone terminal by using the specified login<br>
information when the reserved date/time is reached. This starts a teleconferencing between the<br>
caller terminal 10, callee terminal 20 and the interpretation terminal 30. On the display of each<br>
terminal, a video obtained by synthesizing the video of the caller, the video of the callee and the<br>
video of the interpreter is displayed. To the earphone of the headset of each terminal, an audio<br>
obtained by synthesizing the audio of the caller, the audio of the callee and the audio of the<br>
interpreter is output. Thus, the caller and the callee can have a videophone conversation while<br>
obtaining interpretation by the interpreter.<br>
In such a prior art videophone interpretation service using a multipoint conferencing unit, it is<br>
necessary to reserve a teleconference on the multipoint conferencing unit before starting a<br>
videophone conversation, and the caller had to search for an interpreter and contact the callee<br>
and hold consultation to set a videoconference in advance.<br>
Thus, it has been difficult to apply this approach to an interpretation service which requires<br>
urgent support such as in case a foreigner incapable of using the local language urgently obtains<br>
an administration service from a public office, a hospital or a police station. The interpreter<br>
must join from the stage of prior consultation between the caller and the callee. This restrains<br>
the interpreter for a long time so that the interpretation service cost rises high.<br>
Thus, a main object of the invention is to provide a videophone interpretation system and a<br>
videophone interpretation method which eliminates the need for a caller to search for an<br>
interpreter and consult with a callee in advance and which are available also in an emergency,<br>
thereby minimizing the restraint time of the interpreter and reducing the interpretation service<br>
cost.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
A videophone interpretation system according to this invention is a system where an interpreter<br>
interprets a videophone conversation between a caller and a callee using different languages, the<br>
videophone interpretation system preferably comprising connection means for connecting a<br>
caller terminal, a callee terminal and an interpreter terminal, and communication means for<br>
communicating a video and an audio between the terminals connected by the connection means,<br>
characterized in that the connection means includes an interpreter registration table where at least<br>
the language types interpretable by an interpreter and the terminal number of the interpreter are<br>
registered, a function to accept a call from a caller terminal, a function to acquire the terminal<br>
number of a callee, language type of the caller and the language type of the callee from the caller<br>
terminal for which the call was accepted, a function to extract the terminal number of the<br>
interpreter by referencing the interpreter registration table from the acquired language type of the<br>
caller and language type of the callee, a function to call the interpreter terminal by using the<br>
terminal number of the interpreter extracted, and a function to call the callee terminal by using<br>
the acquired terminal number of the callee and that the communication means transmits a video<br>
including at least a video from the callee terminal and an audio including at least an audio from<br>
the interpreter terminal to the caller terminal, a function to transmit a video including at least a<br>
video from the caller terminal and an audio including at least an audio from the interpreter<br>
terminal to the callee terminal, and a function to transmit an audio including at least an audio<br>
from the caller terminal and an audio from the callee terminal to the interpreter terminal.<br>
With this configuration, upon a call from a caller terminal, the terminal number of an interpreter<br>
capable of interpreting between the language of the caller and the language of the callee is<br>
extracted from the interpreter registration table, and the caller terminal, the callee terminal and<br>
the interpreter terminal are automatically connected, and a video and an audio required for<br>
interpretation are communicated. The caller need not previously search for an interpreter and<br>
hold consultation with the callee thus providing a videophone interpretation service which may<br>
be available even in an emergency. The interpreter can join a videophone conversation<br>
anywhere he/she may be, as long as he/she can be called. This minimizes the restraint time of<br>
the interpreter and reduces the interpretation service cost.<br>
In the videophone interpretation system according to this invention, the communication means<br>
preferably includes a function to transmit a video obtained by synthesizing a video from the<br>
callee terminal as a main window and a video from the interpreter terminal as a sub window to<br>
the caller terminal, a function to transmit a video obtained by synthesizing a video from the<br>
caller terminal as a main window and a video from the interpreter terminal as a sub window to<br>
the callee terminal, and a function to transmit a video obtained by synthesizing a video from the<br>
caller terminal and a video from the callee terminal to the interpreter terminal.<br>
This allows the caller and the callee to check the expression of the interpreter in a<br>
Picture-in-Picture fashion so that it is easy to understand the voice of the interpreter. The<br>
interpreter can check the expression of the caller and the expression of the callee so that a precise<br>
interpretation is enabled.<br>
In the videophone interpretation system according to this invention, the communication means<br>
preferably including a first audio transmission function to synthesize an audio from the callee<br>
terminal and an audio from the interpreter terminal and transmit the resultant to the caller<br>
terminal, a second audio transmission function to synthesize an andio from the caller terminal<br>
and an audio from the interpreter terminal and transmit the resultant to the callee terminal, a third<br>
audio transmission function to synthesize an audio from the caller terminal and an audio from the<br>
callee terminal and transmit the resultant to the interpreter terminal, and an unnecessary side<br>
audio suppression function to suppress an unnecessary side audio either an audio from the<br>
interpreter terminal supplied to the first audio transmission function or an audio from the<br>
interpreter terminal supplied to the second audio transmission function based on a command<br>
from the interpreter terminal, characterized in that the first audio transmission function includes<br>
a callee audio suppression function to suppress an audio from the callee terminal when an audio<br>
from the interpreter terminal is detected and that the second audio transmission function includes<br>
a caller audio suppression function to suppress an audio from the caller terminal when an audio<br>
from the interpreter terminal is detected.<br>
In an interpretation with a prior art videoconference, an audio obtained by synthesizing the<br>
audios of the three parties is transmitted to each terminal. Thus, when a user at a terminal<br>
speaks while a user at any other terminal is speaking, the content of the conference is difficult to<br>
understand with each other. Thus, the interpreter awaits the completion of the speech of the<br>
caller before interpretation, a callee awaits the completion of the interpretation before speech,<br>
and the interpreter awaits the completion of the speech of the callee before interpretation. Since<br>
such a procedure must be repeated in a conference, it has been difficult to perform a speedy and<br>
precise interpretation. According to the invention, the unnecessary side audio suppression<br>
function suppresses an unnecessary side transmission of an audio of the interpreter to either the<br>
caller or the callee, based on a command from the interpreter terminal. When the audio of the<br>
interpreter is detected, transmission of the original audio of the callee to the caller is suppressed<br>
by the callee audio suppression function. When the audio of the interpreter is detected,<br>
transmission of the original audio of the caller to the callee is suppressed by the caller audio<br>
suppression function. With these functions, the caller and the callee can grasp the interpretation<br>
even when their speech overlap that of the interpreter, thereby providing a speedy and precise<br>
videophone interpretation service.<br>
The suppression includes a case where the level of an audio signal is lowered in order to allow<br>
hearing to some extent and a case where the audio signal is shut off so as to mute the audio. The<br>
unnecessary audio suppression function includes a case where the audio of the interpreter is<br>
transmitted selectively to either the caller or the callee.<br>
In the videophone interpretation system according to this invention, the communication means<br>
preferably including a first audio transmission function to selectively transmit either an audio<br>
from the callee terminal or an audio from the interpreter terminal to the caller terminal, a second<br>
audio transmission function to selectively transmit either an audio from the caller terminal or an<br>
audio from the interpreter terminal to the callee terminal, a third audio transmission function to<br>
synthesize an audio from the caller terminal and an audio from the callee terminal and transmit<br>
the resultant to the interpreter terminal, and an unnecessary side audio suppression function to<br>
suppress an unnecessary side audio either an audio from the interpreter terminal supplied to the<br>
first audio transmission function or an audio from the interpreter terminal supplied to the second<br>
audio transmission function by a command from the interpreter terminal, characterized in that the<br>
first audio transmission function includes a function to shut off an audio from the callee terminal<br>
and transmit an audio from the interpreter terminal when an audio from the interpreter is detected<br>
and that the second audio transmission function includes a function to shut off an audio from the<br>
caller terminal and transmit an audio from the interpreter terminal when an audio from the<br>
interpreter terminal is detected.<br>
According to the invention, the unnecessary side audio suppression function suppresses an<br>
unnecessary side transmission of an audio of the interpreter to either the caller or callee, based on<br>
a command from the interpreter terminal. When an audio of the interpreter is detected in the<br>
first audio transmission function, the original audio of the callee switches to the audio of the<br>
interpreter. When an audio of the interpreter is detected in the second audio transmission<br>
function, the original audio of the callee switches to the audio of the interpreter. With these<br>
functions, the caller and the callee can grasp the interpretation even when their speech overlap<br>
that of the interpreter, thereby providing a speedy and precise videophone interpretation service.<br>
The unnecessary audio suppression function includes a case where the audio of the interpreter is<br>
transmitted selectively to either the caller or the callee.<br>
In the videophone interpretation system according to this invention, the communication means<br>
preferably includes a first audio transmission function to perform audio multiplexing on an audio<br>
from the callee terminal and an audio from the interpreter terminal and transmit the resultant to<br>
the caller terminal, a second audio transmission function to performs audio multiplexing on an<br>
audio from the caller terminal and an audio from the interpreter terminal and transmit the<br>
resultant to the callee terminal, a third audio transmission function to perform audio multiplexing<br>
on an audio from the caller terminal and an audio from the callee terminal and transmit the<br>
resultant to the interpreter terminal, and an unnecessary side audio suppression function to<br>
suppress an unnecessary side audio either an audio from the interpreter terminal supplied to the<br>
first audio transmission function or an audio from the interpreter terminal supplied to the second<br>
audio transmission function, based on a command from the interpreter terminal.<br>
According to the invention, the unnecessary side audio suppression function suppresses an<br>
unnecessary side transmission of an audio of the interpreter to either the caller or callee, by a<br>
command from the interpreter terminal. In the first audio transmission function, the original<br>
audio of the callee and the audio of the interpreter are multiplexed and the resultant is<br>
transmitted to the caller. In the second audio transmission function, the original audio of the<br>
caller and the audio of the interpreter are multiplexed and the resultant is transmitted to the callee.<br>
With these functions, the caller and the callee can grasp the interpretation even when their speech<br>
overlap that of the interpreter, thereby providing a speedy and precise videophone interpretation<br>
service.<br>
The unnecessary side audio suppression function includes a case where the audio of the<br>
interpreter is selectively transmitted to either the caller or callee.<br>
In the videophone interpretation system according to this invention, the communication means<br>
preferably includes a function to record a video including a video from the caller terminal, a<br>
video from the callee terminal and a video from the interpreter terminal and an audio including<br>
an audio from the caller terminal, an audio from the callee terminal and an audio from the<br>
interpreter terminal, and a function to reproduce and transmit the recorded video and audio by a<br>
request from a terminal.<br>
With this configuration, videos and audios from the caller, callee and interpreter in an<br>
interpretation service are recorded. As the details of recording can be checked by a request from<br>
a terminal, it is possible to review the contents which were not clear on the spot or check later<br>
the details of the communications service.<br>
A video may be recorded by recording a synthesized video of a video to be transmitted to a caller<br>
terminal and a video to be transmitted to a callee terminal. By doing so, it is possible to check<br>
the video received by the caller or callee.<br>
An audio may be recorded by recording an audio obtained by performing audio multiplexing on<br>
an audio to be transmitted to a caller terminal and an audio to be transmitted to a callee terminal.<br>
By doing so, it is possible to check the contents by the language of the caller and that of the<br>
callee separately from a terminal equipped with an audio demultiplexing function.<br>
Or, an audio to be transmitted to a caller terminal and an audio to be transmitted to a callee<br>
terminal may be recorded separately and the audio of a side specified based on a command from<br>
a terminal may be reproduced for transmission. By doing so, it is possible to check the contents<br>
by the language of the caller and that of the callee separately even from a terminal not equipped<br>
with an audio demultiplexing function.<br>
A videophone interpretation system according to this invention is a system where a videophone<br>
conversation between a caller and a callee using different languages is interpreted by a first<br>
interpreter who interprets the language of the callee to the language of the caller and a second<br>
interpreter who interprets the language of the caller into the language of the callee, the<br>
videophone interpretation system preferably comprising connection means for connecting a<br>
caller terminal, a callee terminal, a first interpreter terminal and a second interpreter terminal and<br>
communication means for communicating a video and an audio between the terminals connected<br>
by the connection means, characterized in that the connection means includes an interpreter<br>
registration table where at least the language types interpretable by an interpreter and the<br>
terminal number of the interpreter are registered, a function to accept a call from a caller terminal,<br>
a function to acquire the terminal number of a callee, language type of the caller and the<br>
language type of the callee from the caller terminal for which the call was accepted, a function to<br>
extract the terminal number of the first interpreter by referencing the interpreter registration table<br>
from the acquired language type of the callee and language type of the caller, a function to call<br>
the first interpreter by using the terminal number of the interpreter extracted, a function to extract<br>
the terminal number of the second interpreter by referencing the interpreter registration table<br>
from the acquired language type of the caller and language type of the callee, a function to call<br>
the second interpreter by using the terminal number of the interpreter extracted, and a function to<br>
call the callee terminal by using the acquired terminal number of the callee, and that the<br>
communication means includes a function to transmit a video including at least a video from the<br>
callee terminal and an audio including at least an audio from the first interpreter to the caller<br>
terminal, a function to transmit a video including at least a video from the caller terminal and an<br>
audio including at least an audio from the second interpreter to the callee terminal, a function to<br>
transmit an audio including at least an audio from the callee terminal to the first interpreter<br>
terminal, and a function to transmit an audio including at least an audio from the caller terminal<br>
to the second interpreter terminal.<br>
With this configuration, based on a call from the caller terminal, the terminal number of the first<br>
interpreter who interprets the language of the callee into the language of the caller and the<br>
terminal number of the second interpreter who interprets the language of the caller into the<br>
language of the callee are extracted from the interpreter registration table. The caller terminal,<br>
the callee terminal, the first interpreter terminal and the second interpreter terminal are<br>
automatically connected and a video and an audio required for interpretation are communicated.<br>
The caller need not previously search for an interpreter and hold consultation with the callee thus<br>
providing a videophone interpretation service which may be available even in an emergency.<br>
The interpreter can join a videophone conversation anywhere he/she may be, as long as he/she<br>
can be called. This minimizes the restraint time of the interpreter and reduces the interpretation<br>
service cost.<br>
In the videophone interpretation system according to this invention, the communication means<br>
preferably includes a function to transmit a video obtained by synthesizing a video from the<br>
callee terminal as a main window and a video from the first interpreter terminal as a sub window<br>
to the caller terminal, a function to transmit a video obtained by synthesizing a video from the<br>
caller terminal as a main window and a video from the second interpreter terminal as a sub<br>
window to the callee terminal, a function to transmit a video obtained by synthesizing a video<br>
from the callee terminal and a video from the caller terminal to the first interpreter terminal, and<br>
a function to transmit a video obtained by synthesizing a video from the caller terminal and a<br>
video from the callee terminal to the second interpreter terminal.<br>
This allows the caller and the callee to check the expressions of the first interpreter and the<br>
second interpreter respectively in a Picture-in-Picture fashion so that it is easy to understand the<br>
voice of the interpreter. Each interpreter can check the expression of the caller and the<br>
expression of the callee so that a precise interpretation is enabled.<br>

callee terminal when an audio from the first interpreter terminal is detected and that the second<br>
audio transmission function includes a caller audio suppression function to suppress an audio<br>
from the caller terminal when an audio from the second interpreter terminal is detected.<br>
According to the invention, when the audio of the first interpreter is detected, transmission of the<br>
original audio of the callee to the caller is suppressed by the callee audio suppression function.<br>
When the audio of the second interpreter is detected, transmission of the original audio of the<br>
caller to the callee is suppressed by the caller audio suppression function. With these functions,<br>

callee and the audio of the first interpreter are audio multiplexed and the resultant is transmitted<br>
to the caller. In the second audio transmission function, the original audio of the caller and the<br>
audio of the second interpreter are audio multiplexed and the resultant voice is transmitted to the<br>
callee. With these functions, the caller and the callee can grasp the interpretation even when<br>
their speech overlap that of each interpreter, thereby providing a speedy and precise videophone<br>
interpretation service.<br>
In the videophone interpretation system according to this invention, the communication means<br>
preferably includes a function to record a video including a video from the caller terminal, a<br>
video from the callee terminal, a video from the first interpreter terminal and a video from the<br>
second interpreter terminal and an audio including an audio from the caller terminal, an audio<br>
from the callee terminal, an audio from the first interpreter terminal and an audio from the<br>
second interpreter terminal, and a function to reproduce and transmit the recorded video and<br>
audio by a request from a terminal.<br>
With this configuration, videos and audios from the caller, callee, first interpreter and second<br>
interpreter in an interpretation service are recorded. As the details of recording can be checked<br>
by a request from a terminal, it is possible to review the contents which were not clear on the<br>
spot or check later the details of the communications service.<br>
A video may be recorded by recording a synthesized video of a video to be transmitted to a caller<br>
terminal and a video to be transmitted to a callee terminal. By doing so, it is possible to check<br>
the video received by the caller or the callee.<br>
An audio may be recorded by recording an audio obtained by performing audio multiplexing on<br>
an audio to be transmitted to a caller terminal and an audio to be transmitted to a callee terminal.<br>
By doing so, it is possible to check the contents by the language of the caller and that of the<br>
callee separately from a terminal equipped with an audio demultiplexing function.<br>
Or, an audio to be transmitted to a caller terminal and an audio to be transmitted to a callee<br>
terminal may be recorded separately and the audio of a side specified by a command from a<br>
terminal may be reproduced and transmitted. By doing so, it is possible to check the contents by<br>
the language of the caller and that of the callee separately even from a terminal not equipped<br>
with an audio demultiplexing function.<br>
In the videophone interpretation system according to this invention, selection information for<br>
selecting an interpreter is registered in the interpreter registration table and the connection means<br>
preferably includes a function to acquire the conditions for selecting an interpreter from the<br>
caller terminal and a function to extract the terminal number of an interpreter who satisfies the<br>
acquired selection conditions by referencing the interpreter registration table.<br>
This selects an interpreter who satisfies the object of a videophone conversation between a caller<br>
and a callee from among the interpreters registered in the interpreter registration table.<br>
Selection interpretation for selecting an interpreter includes information on a sex, an age, a<br>
habitation, a specialty, and a qualification.<br>
By registering the interpretation level of an interpreter by language in the interpreter registration<br>
table, the user can select an interpreter of a desired level for an interpretation between specified<br>
languages. An interpreter can register a plirality of languages, if any, which he/she can provide.<br>
This allows flexible and efficient selection of an interpreter.<br>
In a videophone interpretation system via bidirectional simultaneous interpretation, a listening<br>
comprehension level and a speaking level may be separately registered as interpretation levels by<br>
language to be registered in the interpreter registration table. By doing so, it is possible to<br>
individually select a person who is optimum as a first interpreter and another who is optimum as<br>
a second interpreter, thereby allowing flexible and efficient selection of an interpreter.<br>
In the videophone interpretation system according to this invention, an availability flag to<br>
indicate whether an interpreter is available is registered in the interpreter registration table and<br>
the connection means preferably includes a function to refer an availability flag in the interpreter<br>
registration table to extract the terminal number of an available interpreter.<br>
In this way, by registering whether an interpreter is available in the interpreter registration table,<br>
an available interpreter is automatically selected and called. This eliminates useless calling and<br>
provides a more flexible and efficient videophone interpretation system.<br>
In the videophone interpretation system according to this invention, the connection means<br>
preferably includes a function to generate a text message to be transmitted to each of the<br>
terminals and the communication means includes a function to transmit the generated text<br>
message to each of the terminals.<br>
This transmits a text message which prompts each terminal to enter necessary information when<br>
connecting a caller terminal, a callee terminal and an interpreter terminal.<br>
In the videophone interpretation system according to this invention, the connection means<br>
preferably includes a function to generate a voice message to be transmitted to each of the<br>
terminals and the communication means includes a function to transmit the generated voice<br>
message to each of the terminals.<br>
This transmits a voice message to a caller terminal, a callee terminal and an interpreter terminal<br>
when the caller terminal, callee terminal and interpreter terminal are to be connected. This<br>
makes it possible to provide a videophone interpretation service even when any of the caller, the<br>
callee and the interpreter is a visually impaired person.<br>
In the videophone interpretation system according to this invention, the connection means<br>
preferably includes a function to register a term used during a conversation based on a command<br>
from each of the terminals and a function to extract the registered term and generate a telop<br>
based on a command from each of the terminals and that the communication means includes a<br>
function to transmit the generated telop to each of the terminals.<br>
In this way, by registering a term in advance that is difficult to interpret, it is possible to display a<br>
telop on each of the terminal and provide the videophone interpretation service which is more<br>
quickly and accurate.<br>
In the videophone interpretation system according to this invention, accounting information on<br>
an interpreter is registered in the interpreter registration table and the connection means<br>
preferably includes a function to measure the time that the caller terminal or callee terminal<br>
obtains an interpretation service and a function to calculate a fee from the measured time and<br>
accounting information registered in the interpreter registration table.<br>
By registering the accounting information on an interpreter in the interpreter registration table, it<br>
is possible to account an appropriate fee for a videophone interpretation service.<br>
The interpreter registration table may register the interpretation level of an interpreter by<br>
language and an accounting table which specifies the relationship between the interpretation<br>
level and the hourly rates may be used to determine accounting information. By doing so, it is<br>
possible to account an appropriate fee corresponding to the level of the interpreter.<br>
A videophone interpretation method according to this invention is a method where an interpreter<br>
interprets a videophone conversation between a caller and a callee using different languages, the<br>
method using an interpreter registration table where at least the language types interpretable by<br>
an interpreter and the terminal number of the interpreter are registered, characterized in that the<br>
method comprises steps of accepting a call from a caller terminal, acquiring the terminal number<br>
of a callee, language type of the caller and the language type of the callee from the caller<br>
terminal for which the call was accepted, extracting the terminal number of the interpreter by<br>
referencing the interpreter registration table from the acquired language type of the caller and<br>
language type of the callee, calling the interpreter terminal by using the terminal number of the<br>
interpreter extracted, calling the callee terminal by using the acquired terminal number of the<br>
callee, transmitting a video including at least a video from the callee terminal and an audio<br>
including at least an audio from the interpreter terminal to the caller terminal, transmitting a<br>
video including at least a video from the caller terminal and an audio including at least an audio<br>
from the interpreter terminal to the callee terminal, and transmitting an audio including at least<br>
an audio from the caller terminal and an audio from the callee terminal to the interpreter<br>
terminal.<br>
With this configuration, upon a call from a caller terminal, the terminal number of an interpreter<br>
capable of interpreting between the language of the caller and the language of the callee is<br>
extracted from the interpreter registration table, and the caller terminal, the callee terminal and<br>
the interpreter terminal are automatically connected, and a video and an audio required for<br>
interpretation are communicated. The caller need not previously search for an interpreter and<br>
hold consultation with the callee thus providing a videophone interpretation service which may<br>
be available even in an emergency. The interpreter can join a videophone conversation<br>
anywhere he/she may be, as long as he/she can be called. This minimizes the restraint time of<br>
the interpreter and reduces the interpretation service cost.<br>
A videophone interpretation method according to this invention is a method where a videophone<br>
conversation between a caller and a callee using different languages is interpreted by a first<br>
interpreter who interprets the language of a callee into the language of a caller and a second<br>
interpreter who interprets the language of the caller into the language of the callee, the method<br>
using an interpreter registration table where at least the language types interpretable by an<br>
interpreter and terminal number of the interpreter are registered, characterized in that the method<br>
comprises steps of accepting a call from a caller terminal, acquiring the terminal number of a<br>
callee, language type of the caller and the language type of the callee from the caller terminal for<br>
which the call was accepted, extracting the terminal number of a first interpreter by referencing<br>
the interpreter registration table from the acquired language type of the callee and language type<br>
of the caller, calling the first interpreter terminal by using the terminal number of the first<br>
interpreter extracted, extracting the terminal number of a second interpreter by referencing the<br>
interpreter registration table from the acquired language type of the caller and language type of<br>
the callee, calling the second interpreter terminal by using the terminal number of the second<br>
interpreter extracted, calling the callee by using the acquired terminal number of the callee,<br>
transmitting a video including at least a video from the callee terminal and an audio including at<br>
least an audio from the first interpreter terminal to the caller terminal, transmitting a video<br>
including at least a video from the caller terminal and an audio including at least an audio from<br>
the second interpreter terminal to the callee terminal, transmitting an audio including at least an<br>
audio from the callee terminal to the first interpreter terminal, and transmitting an audio<br>
including at least an audio from the caller terminal to the second interpreter terminal.<br>
With this configuration, upon a call from a caller terminal, the terminal number of a first<br>
interpreter who interprets the language of the callee to the language of the caller and the terminal<br>
number of a second interpreter who interprets the language of the caller into the language of the<br>
callee are extracted. The caller terminal, the callee terminal, the first interpreter terminal, and<br>
the second interpreter terminal are automatically connected, followed by communications of a<br>
video and an audio required for interpretation. The caller need not previously search for an<br>
interpreter and hold consultation with the callee thus providing a videophone interpretation service<br>
which may be available even in an emergency The interpreter can join a videophone conversation<br>
anywhere he/she may be, as long as he/she can be called This minimizes the restraint time of the<br>
interpreter and reduces the interpretation service cost<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Fig. 1 is a system block diagram of a videophone interpretation system according to a first<br>
embodiment of the invention. This embodiment shows a system configuration example<br>
assuming that a terminal used by a caller, a callee or an interpreter is a telephone-type<br>
videophone terminal connected to a public telephone line.<br>
In Fig. 1, a numeral 100 represents a videophone interpretation system installed in an<br>
interpretation center which provides an interpretation service. The videophone interpretation<br>
system 100 interconnects a videophone terminal used by a caller (hereinafter referred to as a<br>
caller terminal) 10, a videophone terminal used by a callee (hereinafter referred to as a callee<br>
terminal) 20, and a videophone terminal used by an interpreter (hereinafter referred to as an<br>
interpreter terminal) 30 via a public telephone line 40 in order to provides a videophone<br>
interpretation service where a videophone conversation between a caller and a callee is<br>
interpreted by an interpreter.<br>
The caller terminal 10, callee terminal 20 and interpreter terminal 30 each comprises a television<br>
camera (a) for capturing each user, a display screen (b) for displaying the received video, a dial<br>
pad (c) for input of a number or information, and a headset (d) for audio input/output. While<br>
input/output of voice is not necessarily made using a headset but a handset on a typical telephone<br>
set may be used instead.<br>
Such a videophone terminal connected to a public line may be an ISDN videophone terminal<br>
based on ITU-T recommendation H.320. The invention may use a videophone terminal which<br>
employs a unique protocol.<br>
The public telephone line may be of a wireless type. The videophone terminal may be a cellular<br>
phone or a portable terminal equipped with a videophone function.<br>
The interpretation videophone system 100 comprises a caller terminal line interface (interface<br>
being hereinafter referred to as I/F) 120 to connect to a caller terminal, a callee terminal line I/F<br>
140 to connect to a callee terminal, and an interpreter terminal line I/F 160 to connect to an<br>
interpreter terminal. To each I/F,. a multiplexer/demultiplexer 122, 142, 162 for<br>
multiplexing/demultiplexing a video signal, an audio signal or a data signal, a video CODEC<br>
(coder/decoder) 124, 144, 164 for compressing/expanding a video signal, and an audio CODEC<br>
126, 146, 166 for compressing/expanding an audio signal are connected. Each line I/F, each<br>
multiplexer/demultiplexer, and each video CODEC or each audio CODEC performs call control,<br>
streaming control and compression/expansion of a video/audio signal in accordance with a<br>
protocol used by each terminal.<br>
To the video input of the caller terminal video CODEC 124, a video synthesizer 128 for<br>
synthesizing the video output of the callee terminal video CODEC 144, the video output of the<br>
interpreter terminal video CODEC 164 and the output of the caller terminal telop memory 132<br>
are connected. To the video input of the callee terminal video CODEC 144, a video synthesizer<br>
148 for synthesizing the video output of the caller terminal video CODEC 124, the video output<br>
of the interpreter terminal video CODEC 164, and the output of the callee terminal telop<br>
memory 152 are connected.<br>
To the video input of the interpreter terminal video CODEC 164, a video synthesizer 168 for<br>
synthesizing the video output of the caller terminal video CODEC 124, the video output of the<br>
callee terminal video CODEC 144, and the output of the interpreter terminal telop memory 172<br>
are connected.<br>
While video display of an interpreter may be omitted on a caller terminal or a callee terminal,<br>
understanding of the voice interpreted by the interpreter is made easy by displaying the video of<br>
the interpreter, so that it is preferable to be able to synthesize the video of an interpreter.<br>
While video display of a caller or a callee may be omitted on an interpreter terminal,<br>
understanding of the voice interpreted by the interpreter is made easy by displaying the videos,<br>
so that it is preferable to be able to display the video of a caller or a callee.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an example of a video displayed on the screen of each terminal during a videophone<br>
conversation by way of the videophone interpretation system 100. Fig. 2(a) shows the screen of<br>
a caller terminal, on which a synthesized video of a callee and an interpreter obtained by the<br>
video synthesizer 128 is displayed. While the video of the callee is displayed as a main window<br>
and the video of the interpreter is displayed as a sub window in a Picture-in-Picture fashion in<br>
this example, a Picture-in-Picture display is also possible assuming the video of the interpreter as<br>
a main window and the video of the callee as a sub window. Or, these videos may be displayed<br>
in equal size. Fig. 2(b) shows the screen of a callee terminal, on which a synthesized video of a<br>
caller and an interpreter obtained by the video synthesized 148 is displayed. While the video of<br>
the caller is displayed as a main window and the video of the interpreter is displayed as a sub<br>
window in a Picture-in-Picture fashion in this example, a Picture-in-Picture display is also<br>
possible assuming the video of the interpreter as a main window and the video of the caller as a<br>
sub window. Or, these videos may be displayed in equal size. Fig. 2(c) shows the screen of an<br>
interpreter terminal, on which a synthesized video of a caller and a callee obtained by the video<br>
synthesizer 168 is displayed.<br>
To the audio input of the caller terminal audio CODEC 126, an audio synthesizer 130 for<br>
synthesizing the audio output of the callee terminal audio CODEC 146 and the audio output of<br>
the interpreter terminal audio CODEC 166 are connected. To the audio input of the callee<br>
terminal audio CODEC 146, an audio synthesizer 150 for synthesizing the audio output of the<br>
caller terminal audio CODEC 126 and the audio output of the interpreter terminal audio CODEC<br>
166 are connected.<br>
To the audio input of the interpreter terminal audio CODEC 166, an audio synthesizer 170 for<br>
synthesizing the audio output of the caller terminal audio CODEC 126 and the audio output of<br>
the callee terminal audio CODEC 146 are connected.<br>
The audio output of the interpreter terminal audio CODEC 166 is input to a selector 174. Based<br>
on a command from an interpreter terminal, the audio output is supplied to the caller terminal<br>
audio synthesizer 130 in case the interpreter interprets the language of the callee to the language<br>
of a caller, and to the callee terminal audio synthesizer 150 in case the interpreter interprets the<br>
language of a caller to the language of the callee. As a result, the audio of the interpreter is<br>
transmitted to either the caller or the callee requiring the audio. Thus, it is possible to prevent<br>
the speech of a caller or a callee from being disturbed by the unnecessary voice of an interpreter,<br>
thereby providing a smooth conversation.<br>
The caller terminal audio synthesizer 130 is equipped with a function to suppress an audio level<br>
from the callee terminal or switch an audio from the callee terminal to an audio from the<br>
interpreter terminal when an audio from the interpreter terminal is detected. The callee terminal<br>
audio synthesizer 150 is equipped with a function to suppress an audio level from the caller<br>
terminal or switch an auido from the callee terminal to an audio from the interpreter terminal<br>
when an audio from the interpreter terminal is detected. This prevents overlapping of the audio<br>
of the interpretation by the interpreter pver the audio of the opponent party which causes<br>
difficulty in listening. The interpreter can simultaneously interpret the speech of the speaker<br>
thus allowing a speedy and precise interpretation.<br>
Fig. 15 shows specific examples of the function to switch the destination of the interpreter audio<br>
in the selector 174 and the function to suppress the audio of the callee or caller in the audio<br>
synthesizers 130, 150. As shown in Fig. 15, the audio output of the interpreter terminal audio<br>
CODEC 166 is connected to a caller terminal audio signal adder 190 and an callee terminal audio<br>
signal adder 193 via the switch 174. The audio of the interpreter is supplied to either the caller<br>
of callee by a signal from a PB detector 175. The PB detector 175 detects a predetermined<br>
number for selecting a caller or a callee on the dial pad of a terminal is pressed based on a data<br>
signal or a tone signal included in an audio signal from the interpreter terminal, and switches the<br>
selector 174 into the specified side. The interpreter specifies the caller or callee as a destination<br>
of his/her voice by the dial pad before he/she interprets. Thus, the caller or the callee who need<br>
not listen to the audio of the interpreter does not receive the audio of the interpreter.<br>
To the caller terminal audio signal adder 190 is connected the audio output of the callee terminal<br>
audio CODEC 146 is connected via an attenuator 191, which attenuates the audio from the callee<br>
terminal when the audio from the interpreter is detected by the signal detector 192. To the<br>
callee terminal audio signal adder 193, the audio output of the caller terminal audio CODEC 126<br>
is connected via an attenuator 194, which attenuates the audio from the caller terminal when the<br>
audio of the interpreter is detected by the signal detector 195. The signal detectors 192, 195 are<br>
set to an appropriate detection level in order to prevent the audio of the opponent party from<br>
being attenuated by mistake due to a noise and the like.<br>
In order to ensure that the caller or the callee can hear the audio of the interpreter immediately<br>
after the audio of the interpreter is detected by the signal detector 192, 195, an appropriate signal<br>
delay unit may be provided at the interpreter audio input of the audio signal adder 190, 193.<br>
While the audio of the opponent party is attenuated by the attenuator 191, 194 so that the caller<br>
or the callee can hear the original voice of the opponent party to some extent in the background<br>
of the audio of the interpreter in this embodiment, a switch may be used instead to shut off the<br>
audio of the opponent party.<br>
Fig. 16 shows an example where the audio of the opponent party is shut off when the audio of<br>
the interpreter is transmitted and only the audio of the interpreter is transmitted. As shown in<br>
Fig. 16, switches 197, 198 are used instead of the audio signal adders 190, 193. When the audio<br>
of the interpreter is detected by the signal detectors 192, 195, the switches 197, 198 are turned<br>
from the audio of the opponent party to the audio of the interpreter. The remaining<br>
configuration is the same as that shown in Fig. 15.<br>
In this case also, in order to ensure that the caller or the callee can hear the audio of the<br>
interpreter immediately after the audio of the interpreter is detected by the signal detector 192,<br>
195, an appropriate signal delay unit may be provided at the interpreter audio input of the<br>
switches 197, 198.<br>
While the audio signal adder 190, 193 simply adds the audio of the interpreter and the audio of<br>
the opponent party in the above example, audio multiplexing of two signals may be employed as<br>
well. For example in case a terminal supports a stereophonic audio, a stereophonic synthesis is<br>
performed to the audio of the opponent party as the left channel and the audio of the interpreter<br>
as the right channel and the resultant signal is transmitted to a terminal, where the receiving party<br>
selects a necessary audio. In this configuration, it is not necessary to provide an attenuator to<br>
attenuate the audio of the opponent party in the videophone interpretation system. The<br>
receiving party listens to the audios while adjusting the volume balance of the right and left<br>
channels of a headset.<br>
While the audio of the interpreter is transmitted to either the caller or the caJlee as selected by the<br>
switch 174 in the above example, the audio of the interpreter may be supplied to each of the<br>
audio signal adder 190 (or the switch 197) and the audio signal adder 193 (or the switch 198) via<br>
an attenuator in order to attenuate an audio signal to a party where the audio is not required<br>
based on detection by the PB detector 175. In this way, some of the audio of the interpreter is<br>
transmitted to the speaker by using an attenuator. The speaker thus checks that his/her speech is<br>
interpreted while he/she is speaking.<br>
The videophone interpretation system 100 is equipped with an interpreter registration table 112<br>
where the terminal number of an interpreter is registered and includes a controller 110 connected<br>
to each of the line I/Fs 120, 140, 160, multiplexers/demultiplexers 122, 142, 162, video<br>
synthesizers 128, 148, 168, audio synthesizers 130, 150, 170, and telop memories 132, 152, 172.<br>
The controller 110 provides a function to connect a caller terminal, a callee terminal and an<br>
interpreter terminal by way of a function to accept a call from a caller terminal, a function to<br>
acquire the language type of the caller and the language type of the callee, a function to acquire<br>
the selection conditions for selecting an interpreter, a function to extract the terminal number of<br>
the interpreter by referencing the interpreter registration table 112 by using the acquired language<br>
type and selection conditions, a function to call the interpreter terminal by using the terminal<br>
number of the interpreter extracted, and a function to call the callee terminal by using the<br>
acquired terminal number of the callee.<br>
Operation of the video synthesizers 128, 148, 168 and audio synthesizers 130, 150, 170 is<br>
controlled by the controller 110. A function is included where the user changes the video output<br>
method or audio output method by pressing a predetermined number button of a dial pad of each<br>
terminal. This is implemented that the multiplexer/demultiplexer 122, 142, 162 detects the<br>
number button on the dial pad of each terminal is pressed based on a data signal or a tone signal<br>
and signals the detection to the controller. This ensures flexibility in the usage of the system on<br>
each terminal. For example, only necessary videos or audios are selected and displayed/output<br>
in accordance with the object or it is possible to replace a main window with a sub window, or<br>
change the position of the sub window.<br>
To the input of the audio synthesizers 128, 148, 168, a caller terminal telop memory 132, a calee<br>
terminal telop memory 152, and a interpreter terminal telop memory 172 are connected<br>
respectively. Contents of each telop memory 132, 152, 172 can be set from the controller 110.<br>
With this configuration, by setting a message to be displayed on each terminal to the telop<br>
memory 132, 152, 172 and issuing a command to select a signal of the telop memory 132, 152,<br>
172 to the audio synthesizer 128, 148, 168 in the setup of a videophone conversation via<br>
interpretation, it is possible to transmit necessary messages to respective terminals to establish a<br>
three-way call.<br>
In case there is a term which is difficult to explain or a word which is difficult to pronounce in a<br>
videophone conversation, it is possible to register in advance the term in the term registration<br>
table 113 of the controller 110 in association with the number of the dial pad on each terminal.<br>
By doing so, it is possible to detect that the dial pad on each terminal is pressed during a<br>
videophone conversation by using a data signal or a tone signal on the multiplexer/demultiplexer<br>
122, 142, 162, extract a term corresponding to the number of the dial pad pressed from the term<br>
registration table 113, generate a text telop, and set the text telop to each telop memory, thereby<br>
displaying the term on each terminal. This communicates, by way of a text telop, to the<br>
opponent party a term which is difficult to explain or a word which is difficult to pronounce, thus<br>
providing a speedier and more precise videophone conversation.<br>
Next, the connection processing by the controller 110 for establishing a videophone conversation<br>
via interpretation is described.<br>
Prior to processing, an interpreter selection information and a terminal number of a terminal used<br>
by each interpreter are registered in the interpreter registration table 112 of the controller 110<br>
from an appropriate terminal (not shown), Fig. 3 shows an example of registration item to be<br>
registered in the interpreter registration table 112. The interpreter selection information is<br>
information for selecting a interpreter desired by a user, which includes a gender, an age,<br>
supported languages, a habitation, a specialty, and the like. For the supported languages, the<br>
level of an interpreter is registered by language to allow the user to select an interpreter of a<br>
desired level between the target languages. In this example, the levels of interpretation are<br>
represented by 1 (Advanced), 2 (Middle) and 3 (Basic). The habitation assumes a case where<br>
the user desires a person who has geographic knowledge on a specific area and, in this example,<br>
a ZIP code is used to specify an area. The specialty assumes a case where, in case the<br>
conversation pertains to a specific field, the user desires a person who has expert knowledge on<br>
the field or is familiar with the topics in the field. In this example, the fields an interpreter is<br>
familiar with are classified into several categories to be registered, such as politics, law, business,<br>
education, science and technology, medical care, language, sports, and hobby. The specialties<br>
are diverse, so that they may be registered hierarchically and searched through at a level desired<br>
by the user when selected.<br>
In addition, qualifications of interpreter may be registered in advance so that the user can select a<br>
qualified person as an interpreter.<br>
The terminal number to be registered is the telephone number of the terminal, because in this<br>
example a videophone terminal to connect to a public telephone line is assumed.<br>
In the interpreter registration table 112 is provided an availability flag to indicate whether an<br>
interpreter accepts interpretation. A registered interpreter can call the interpretation center from<br>
his/her terminal and enter a command by using a dial pad to set/reset the availability flag. Thus,<br>
an interpreter registered in the interpreter registration table can set the availability flag only when<br>
he/she is available for interpretation, thereby eliminating useless calling and allowing the user to<br>
select an available interpreter without delay.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a processing flowchart of the connection processing by the controller 110. The<br>
videophone interpretation system 100 accepts an order for an interpretation service when the<br>
caller calls a telephone number of the caller terminal line I/F. The videophone interpretation<br>
system 100 then calls the interpreter terminal and the callee terminal, and establishes a<br>
connection for the videophone interpretation service.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the presence of a call to the caller terminal line I/F 120 is detected<br>
initially(S100). When a call is detected, a screen to prompt input of the language type of the<br>
caller is displayed on the caller terminal (S102). This is accomplished for example by setting a<br>
message shown in Fig. 5(a) to the caller terminal telop memory 132. The language type of the<br>
caller input by the caller is acquired (S104). Afterwards, messaging to the caller terminal and<br>
the interpreter terminal is made using the language type of the caller acquired. Next, a screen to<br>
prompt input of a language type of the callee is displayed on the caller terminal (S106). This is<br>
accomplished for example by setting a message shown in Fig. 5(b) to the caller terminal telop<br>
132. The language type of the callee input by the caller is acquired (S108). Afterwards,<br>
messaging to the callee terminal is made using the language type of the callee acquired.<br>
A screen to prompt input of interpreter selection conditions is displayed on the caller terminal<br>
(S110). This is accomplished for example by setting a message shown in Fig. 6(a) to the caller<br>
terminal telop memory 132. The interpreter selection conditions input by the caller are acquired<br>
(S112). The interpreter selection conditions input by the caller are a gender, an age bracket, an<br>
area, a specialty and an interpretation level. The area is specified by using a ZIP code and an<br>
interpreter is selected starting with the habitation closest to the specified area. For any<br>
selections, in case it is not necessary to specify a condition, N/A may be selected.<br>
Next, an interpreter who has a specified interpretation level of the language of the caller and the<br>
language of the callee, and whose gender, age, habitation and specialty satisfy the acquired<br>
selection conditions, with his/her availability flag being set is extracted referring to the<br>
interpreter registration table 112, and the caller terminal displays a list of interpreter candidates<br>
to prompt input of the selection number of a desired interpreter (S114). This is accomplished<br>
for example by setting a message and an interpreter list shown in Fig. 6(a) to the caller terminal<br>
telop memory 132. In this practice, the hourly rates of the interpreter (not shown) registered in<br>
the interpreter registration table 112 is extracted and displayed as a fee. This allows the user to<br>
consider the cost of the interpretation service before selecting an appropriate interpreter. The<br>
hourly rates of the interpreter may be determined from the interpretation level of the selected<br>
interpreter by referencing an accounting table which specifies the relationship between the<br>
interpretation level and the hourly rates. The selection number input by the caller referring to<br>
the interpreter candidate list is acquired (S116). The terminal number of the selected interpreter<br>
is extracted from the interpreter registration table 112 and called (S118). Personal information<br>
on a caller, language types of the caller and callee, and interpreter selection conditions may be<br>
communicated to the interpreter terminal by using the interpreter terminal telop memory 172 so<br>
as to accept the interpretation. Personal information on the caller may be available for example<br>
from pre-registered member information for the interpretation service being a membership<br>
service.<br>
When a response is received from the interpreter terminal (S120), a screen to prompt input of the<br>
terminal number of the callee is displayed on the caller terminal (S122). This is accomplished<br>
for example by setting a message shown in Fig. 7 to the caller terminal telop memory 132. The<br>
terminal number of the callee input by the caller is extracted and the callee is called (S124).<br>
Same as the above procedure, personal information on a caller, language types of the caller and<br>
callee, and interpreter selection conditions may be communicated to the callee terminal by using<br>
the callee terminal telop memory 152 so as to confirm whether to accept the call and an error in<br>
the set conditions, if any.<br>
When a response is received from the callee terminal (S126), a videophone interpretation service<br>
starts (S128).<br>
In case a response is not received from the interpreter terminal in S120, whether another<br>
candidate is available is determined (S130). In case another candidate is available, execution<br>
returns to S118 and the procedure is repeated. In case another candidate is unavailable, the<br>
caller terminal is notified as such and the call is released (SI32). In case a response is not<br>
received from the callee terminal in S126, the caller terminal and the selected interpreter terminal<br>
are notified as such and the call is released (SI34).<br>
The controller 110 has a timer (not shown) for calculating the fee of the interpretation service.<br>
The timer measures the time from when the connection is established to when it is released. On<br>
completion of an interpretation service, the fee is calculated from the time measured by the timer<br>
and the hourly rates mentioned above and registered in a accounting database 114, and charged<br>
to the user later.<br>
While in case the selected interpreter terminal does not accept the call, the caller is simply<br>
notified as such and the call is released in the above embodiment, an interpretation reservation<br>
table to register a caller terminal number and a callee terminal number may be provided and the<br>
caller and the callee may be notified on a later response from the selected interpreter to set a<br>
videophone conversation.<br>
While the caller is prompted to input the language types of the caller and the callee for selection<br>
of an interpreter in this embodiment, a telephone number of an interpretation center may be<br>
specified per language type of the caller or per combination of the language type of the caller and<br>
the language type of the callee in order to acquire the language type of the caller or the callee.<br>
While the caller is prompted to input the interpreter selection conditions for selecting an<br>
interpreter in this embodiment, the caller may be first inquired of whether to specify the<br>
interpreter selection conditions, and in case he/she has determined not to specify the interpreter<br>
selection conditions, only the input language types may be used to select an interpreter.<br>
Configuration is allowed where, in an emergency, the caller first dials a specific number to<br>
automatically call an interpreter dedicated to an emergency case.<br>
While the videophone interpretation system 100 comprises a line I/F, a multiplexer/demultiplexer,<br>
a video CODEC, an audio CODEC, a video synthesizer, an audio synthesizer and a controller in<br>
the above embodiment, these components need not be implemented by individual hardware<br>
(H/W) but the function of each component may be implemented by software processing running<br>
on a computer.<br>
While the interpreter terminal 30, same as the caller terminal 10 and the callee terminal 20, is<br>
located outside the interpretation center and called from the interpretation center over a public<br>
telephone line to provide an interpretation service in the above embodiment, the invention is not<br>
limited thereto but some or all of the interpreter terminals may be installed in the interpretation<br>
center so that the interpretation services are provided from the interpretation center.<br>
In the above embodiment, an interpreter can join an interpretation service anywhere he/she may<br>
be, as long as he/she has a terminal which can be connected to a public telephone line. Thus the<br>
interpreter can provide an interpretation service by using the availability flag to make efficient<br>
use of free time. This allows efficient and stably operation of interpretation services which<br>
often have difficulty in securing necessary personnel.<br>
While a video signal of the home terminal is not input to the video synthesizers 128, 148, 168 in<br>
the above embodiment, a function may be provided to input the video signal of the home<br>
terminal and synthesize and display to check the video on the terminal.<br>
While the video synthesizers 128, 148, 168 are used to synthesize videos for each terminal in the<br>
above embodiment, the invention is not limited thereto but videos from all terminals may be<br>
synthesized at once and the resultant maybe transmitted to each terminal. In this case, as shown<br>
in Fig. 21 (a) for example, a video of the caller, a video of the callee and a video of the interpreter<br>
may be displayed in a four split screen.<br>
While a function is provided whereby the telop memories 132, 152, 172 are provided and their<br>
outputs are added to the corresponding video synthesizers 128, 148, 168 respectively in order to<br>
display a text telop on each terminal in the above embodiment, a function may be provided<br>
whereby telop memories to store audio information are provided and each output is added to the<br>
audio synthesizers 130, 150, 170 in order to output an audio message on each terminal. This<br>
makes it possible to provide a videophone interpretation service even in case any of the caller,<br>
the callee or the interpreter is a visually impaired person.<br>
Fig. 8 is a system block diagram of a videophone interpretation system according to a second<br>
embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the system configuration example includes<br>
the terminals used by a caller, a callee and an interpreter are IP(Internet Protocol) type<br>
videophone terminals to be connected to the Internet equipped with a web browser.<br>
In Fig. 8, a numeral 200 represents a videophone interpretation system installed in an<br>
interpretation center to provide an interpretation service. The videophone interpretation system<br>
200 connects a caller terminal 60 used by a caller, a callee terminal 70 used by a callee, and any<br>
of the interpreter terminals used by an interpreter 231, 232,... via the Internet 80 in order to<br>
provide a videophone interpretation service to the caller and the callee.<br>
While the caller terminal 60, the callee terminal 70 and the interpreter terminal 231, 232,... each<br>
comprises a general-purpose processing device (a) such as a personal computer having a video<br>
input I/F function, an audio input/output I/F function and a network connection function, the<br>
processing device equipped with a keyboard (b) and a mouse (c) for input of information as well<br>
as a display (d) for displaying a web page screen presented by a web server 210 and a<br>
videophone screen supplied by a communications server 220, a television camera (e) for<br>
capturing the video of a each terminal user, and a headset (f) for performing audio input/output<br>
for each terminal user, and the processing device has IP videophone software and a web browser<br>
installed in this example, a dedicated videophone terminal may be used instead.<br>
The videophone terminal connected to the Internet may be an IP videophone terminal based on<br>
ITU-T recommendation H.323, the invention is not limited thereto but may use a videophone<br>
terminal which employs a unique protocol.<br>
The Internet may be of a wireless LAN type. The videophone terminal may be a cellular phone<br>
or a portable terminal equipped with a videophone function and also including a web access<br>
function.<br>
The videophone interpretation system 200 comprises: a communications server 220 including a<br>
connection table 222 for setting the terminal addresses of a caller terminal, a callee terminal and<br>
an interpreter terminal as well as a function to interconnect the terminals registered in the<br>
connection table 222 and synthesize a video and an audio received from each terminal and<br>
transmit the synthesized video and audio to each terminal; a web server 210 including an<br>
interpreter registration table 212 for registering the interpreter selection information, terminal<br>
address and availability flag of each interpreter as mentioned earlier, as well as a function to<br>
select a desired interpreter based on an access from a caller terminal by using a web browser and<br>
set the terminal address of each of the caller terminal, the callee terminal and interpreter terminal<br>
in the connection table 222 of the communications server 220; a router 250 for connecting the<br>
web server 210 and the communications server 220 to the Internet; and a plurality of interpreter<br>
terminals 231,232,..., 23N connected to the communications server 220 via a network.<br>
Fig. 9 shows an example of a connection table 222. As shown in Fig. 9, the terminal address of<br>
a caller terminal, the terminal address of a callee terminal and the terminal address of an<br>
interpreter terminal are registered as a set in the connection table 222. This provides a single<br>
interpretation service. The connection table 222 is designed to register a plurality of such<br>
terminal address sets depending on the throughput of the communications server 220, thereby<br>
simultaneously providing a plurality of interpretation services.<br>
While the terminal address registered in the connection table 222 is an address on the Internet<br>
and is generally an IP address, the invention is not limited thereto but for example a name given<br>
by a directory server may be used.<br>
The communications server 220 performs packet communications using a predetermined<br>
protocol with the caller terminal, the callee terminal and interpreter terminal set to the connection<br>
table 222 and provides, by way of software processing, the functions similar to those provided by<br>
a multiplexer/demultiplexer 122,142,162, a video CODEC 124, 144,164, an audio CODEC 126,<br>
146, 166, a video synthesizer 128, 148, 168, an audio synthesizer 130, 150, 170 in the<br>
videophone interpretation system 100.<br>
With this configuration, same as the videophone interpretation system 100, prescribed videos and<br>
audios are communicated between a caller terminal, a callee terminal and an interpreter terminal,<br>
and a videophone interpretation service is provided between the caller and the callee.<br>
While the videophone interpretation system 100 uses the controller 110 and the telop memories<br>
132, 152, 172 to extract a term registered in the term registration table 113 during a videophone<br>
conversation by a command from a terminal and displays the term as a telop on the terminal, the<br>
same function may be provided by way of software processing by the communications server<br>
220 in this embodiment also. A term specified by each terminal may be displayed as a popup<br>
message on the other terminal by way of the web server 210. Or, a telop memory may be<br>
provided in the communications server 220 and a term specified by each terminal may be written<br>
into the telop memory via the web server 210 to display a text telop on each terminal.<br>
While the aforementioned interpretation center uses the controller 110 to interconnect a caller<br>
terminal, a callee terminal and an interpreter terminal, the connection procedure is made by the<br>
web server 210 in this embodiment because each terminal has a web access function.<br>
Fig. 10 is a processing flowchart of a connection procedure by the web server 210. In the<br>
videophone interpretation system 200, a caller terminal may access and log into the web server<br>
210 in the interpretation center, which starts the acceptance of the interpretation service.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the web server 210 first acquires the terminal address of a caller (S200) and<br>
sets the terminal address to the connection table 222 (S202). Next, the web server delivers a<br>
screen to prompt input of the language type of the caller similar to that shown in Fig. 5(a)<br>
(S204)to the caller terminal. The language type of the caller input by the caller is acquired<br>
(S206). The web server delivers a screen to prompt input of the language type of the callee<br>
similar to that shown in Fig. 5(b) (S208) to the caller terminal. The language type of the callee<br>
input by the caller is acquired (S210). The web server delivers a screen to prompt input of the<br>
selection conditions similar to that shown in Fig. 6(a) to the caller terminal (S212). The<br>
interpreter selection conditions input by the caller are acquired (S214).<br>
Next, an interpreter with availability flag set is selected from among the interpreters satisfying<br>
the language type and selection conditions referring to the interpreter registration table 212. The<br>
web server 210 delivers a list of interpreter candidates similar to that shown in Fig. 6(b) to the<br>
caller terminal to prompt input of the selection number of a desired interpreter (S216). The<br>
selection number of the interpreter input by the caller is acquired and the terminal address of the<br>
selected interpreter is acquired from the interpreter registration table 212 (S218). Based on the<br>
acquired terminal address of the interpreter, the web server 210 delivers a calling screen to the<br>
interpreter terminal (S220). In case the call is accepted by the interpreter (S222), the terminal<br>
address of the interpreter is set to the connection table 222 (S224). The web server 210 delivers<br>
a screen to prompt input of the terminal address of the callee similar to that shown in Fig. 7 to<br>
the caller terminal (S226). The terminal address of the callee input by the caller is acquired<br>
(S228). Based on the acquired terminal address of the callee, the web server 210 delivers a<br>
calling screen to the callee terminal (S230). In case the call is accepted by the callee terminal<br>
(S232), the callee terminal address is set to the connection table 222 (S234). Then, a<br>
videophone interpretation service starts (S236).<br>
In case the interpreter terminal does not accept the call in S222, whether another candidate is<br>
available is determined (S238). In case another candidate is available, the web server delivers a<br>
message to prompt the caller to select another candidate to the caller terminal (S240), then<br>
execution returns to S218. In case another candidate is not found, the web server notifies the<br>
caller terminal as such (S242) and the call is released. In case the callee terminal does not<br>
accept the call in S232, the caller terminal and the selected interpreter terminal are notified as<br>
such (S244) and the call is released.<br>
While in case the selected interpreter terminal does not accept the call, the caller is notified as<br>
such and the call is released in the above embodiment, an interpretation reservation table to<br>
register a caller terminal address and a callee terminal address may be provided and the caller<br>
and the callee may be notified on a later response from the selected interpreter to set a<br>
videophone interpretation service.<br>
While the interpreter terminal is located in the videophone interpretation system 200 of the<br>
interpretation center in the above embodiment, the invention is not limited thereto but some or<br>
all of the interpreters may be installed outside the interpretation center and connected via the<br>
Internet. Theses terminals may be addressed by the same processing.<br>
In the above embodiment, the configuration of the videophone interpretation system has been<br>
described for a case where a videophone terminal used by a caller, a callee or an interpreter is a<br>
telephone-type videophone terminal connected to a public telephone line and a case where the<br>
videophone terminal is an IP-type videophone terminal connected to the Internet, the<br>
telephone-type videophone terminal and the IP-type videophone terminal can communicate with<br>
each other by arranging a gateway to perform protocol conversion therebetween. A videophone<br>
interpretation system conforming to one protocol may be provided to support a videophone<br>
terminal which uses another protocol.<br>
In this way, the videophone interpretation system allows the user to enjoy or provide an<br>
interpretation service anywhere he/she may be, as long as he/she has a terminal which can be<br>
connected to a public telephone line or the Internet. An interpreter does not always have to visit<br>
an interpretation center but can join a conversation via interpretation from his/her home or a<br>
facility or site where a videophone terminal is located, or provide an interpretation service by<br>
using a cellular phone or a portable terminal equipped with a videophone function.<br>
A person with the ability of interpretation may wish to register in the interpreter registration table<br>
in the interpretation center in order to provide an interpretation service anytime when it is<br>
convenient to him/her. From the viewpoint of the operation of the interpretation center, it is not<br>
necessary to summon interpreters to the center. This allows efficient operation of the<br>
interpretation center both in terms of time and costs.<br>
While one interpreter performs both interpretation from the language of the callee into the<br>
language of the caller and interpretation from the language of the caller into the language of the<br>
callee in the above embodiment, a first interpreter to interpret the language of the callee into the<br>
language of the caller and a second interpreter to interpret the language of the caller into the<br>
language of the callee may be individually set to perform a bidirectional simultaneous<br>
interpretation.<br>
Fig. 11 shows an example of the system configuration of a videophone interpretation system<br>
which provides a bidirectional simultaneous interpretation according to a third embodiment of<br>
the invention. While this example uses a telephone-type videophone, an IP-type videophone<br>
may be used instead as mentioned above.<br>
In Fig. 11, a numeral 300 represents a videophone interpretation system installed in an<br>
interpretation center which provides a bidirectional simultaneous interpretation service. The<br>
videophone interpretation system 300 interconnects a videophone terminal used by a caller<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a caller terminal) 10, a videophone terminal used by a callee<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a callee terminal) 20, a videophone terminal used by a first interpreter<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a first interpreter terminal) 32, and a videophone terminal used by a<br>
second interpreter (hereinafter referred to as a second interpreter terminal) 34 via a public<br>
telephone line 40 in order to provide a videophone interpretation service where a videophone<br>
conversation between a caller and a callee is interpreted by the first interpreter and the second<br>
interpreter.<br>
The videophone interpretation system 300 comprises a caller terminal line I/F 320, a callee<br>
terminal line I/F 340, a first interpretation terminal line I/F 360 and a second interpretation<br>
terminal line I/F 380. To each I/F a multiplexer/demultiplexer 322, 342, 362, 382 for<br>
multiplexing/demultiplexing a video signal, an audio signal or a data signal, a video CODEC<br>
(coder/decoder) 324, 344, 364, 384 for compressing/expanding a video signal, and an audio<br>
CODEC 326, 346, 366, 386 for compressing/expanding an audio signal are connected. Each<br>
line I/F, each multiplexer/demultiplexer, and each video CODEC or each audio CODEC<br>
performs call control, streaming control and compression/expansion of a video/audio signal in<br>
accordance with a protocol used by each terminal.<br>
To the video input of the caller terminal video CODEC 324, a video synthesizer 328 for<br>
synthesizing the video output of the callee terminal video CODEC 344, the video output of the<br>
first interpreter terminal video CODEC 364 and the output of the caller terminal telop memory<br>
332 is connected.<br>
To the video input of the callee terminal video CODEC 344, a video synthesizer 348 for<br>
synthesizing the video output from the caller terminal video CODEC 324, the video output from<br>
the second interpreter terminal video CODEC 384, and the output of the callee terminal telop<br>
memory 352 is connected.<br>
To the video input of the first interpreter terminal video CODEC 364, a video synthesizer 368 for<br>
synthesizing the video output of the caller terminal video CODEC 324, the video output of the<br>
callee terminal video CODEC 344, and the output of the first interpreter terminal telop memory<br>
372 is connected.<br>
To the video input of the second interpreter terminal video CODEC 384, a video synthesizer 388<br>
for synthesizing the video output of the callee terminal video CODEC 344, the video output of<br>
the caller terminal video CODEC 324, and the output of the second interpreter terminal telop<br>
memory 392 is connected.<br>
While video display of a first interpreter or a second interpreter may be omitted on a caller<br>
terminal or a callee terminal, understanding of the voice interpreted by the interpreter is made<br>
easy by displaying the video of the interpreter, so that it is preferable to be able to synthesize the<br>
video of an interpreter.<br>
While video display of a caller or a callee may be omitted on a first interpreter terminal or a<br>
second interpreter terminal, understanding of the voice interpreted by the interpreter is made easy<br>
by displaying the videos, so that it is preferable to be able to display the video of a caller or a<br>
callee.<br>
Fig. 12 shows an example of a video displayed on the screen of each terminal during a<br>
videophone conversation by way of the videophone interpretation system 300. Fig. 12(a) shows<br>
the screen of a caller terminal, on which a synthesized video of a caller and a first interpreter<br>
obtained by the video synthesizer 328 is displayed. While the video of the callee is displayed as<br>
a mam window and the video of the first interpreter is displayed as a sub window in a<br>
Picture-in-Picture fashion in this example, a Picture-in-Picture display is also possible assuming<br>
the video of the first interpreter as a main window and the video of the callee as a sub window.<br>
Or, these videos may be displayed in equal size. Fig. 12(b) shows the screen of a callee terminal,<br>
on which a synthesized video of a caller and a second interpreter obtained by the video<br>
synthesizer 348 is displayed. While the video of the caller is displayed as a main window and<br>
the video of the second interpreter is displayed as a sub window in a Picture-in-Picture fashion in<br>
this example, a Picture-in-Picture display is also possible assuming the video of the second<br>
interpreter as a main window and the video of the callee as a sub window. Or, these videos may<br>
be displayed in equal size. Fig. 12(c) shows the screen of a first interpreter terminal, on which a<br>
synthesized video of a callee and a caller obtained by the video synthesizer 368 is displayed.<br>
While the video of the callee is displayed as a main window and the video of the caller is<br>
displayed as a sub window in a Picture-in-Picture fashion in this example, the videos may appear<br>
in opposite windows. Or, these videos may be displayed in equal size. Fig. 12(d) shows the<br>
screen of a second interpreter terminal, on which a synthesized video of a caller and a callee<br>
obtained by the video synthesizer 388 is displayed. While the video of the caller is displayed as<br>
a main window and the video of the callee is displayed as a sub window in a Picture-in-Picture<br>
fashion in this example, the videos may appear in opposite windows. Or, these videos may be<br>
displayed in equal size.<br>
To the audio input of the caller terminal audio CODEC 326, an audio synthesizer 330 for<br>
synthesizing the audio output of the callee terminal audio CODEC 346 and the audio output of<br>
the first interpreter terminal audio CODEC 366 is connected. To the audio input of the cllee<br>
terminal audio CODEC 346, an audio synthesizer 350 for synthesizing the audio output of the<br>
caller terminal audio CODEC 326 and the audio output of the second interpreter terminal audio<br>
CODEC 386 is connected.<br>
To the audio input of the first interpreter terminal audio CODEC 366, the audio output of the<br>
callee terminal audio CODEC 346 is connected. To the audio input of the second interpreter<br>
terminal audio CODEC 386, the audio output of the caller terminal audio CODEC 326 is<br>
connected.<br>
With this configuration, the audio of the first interpreter is transmitted only to the caller, and the<br>
audio of the second interpreter is transmitted only to the callee. Thus, the speech of the caller is<br>
not disturbed by the audio of the second interpreter and the speech of the callee is not disturbed<br>
by the audio of the first interpreter, thereby providing a smooth conversation.<br>
The caller terminal audio synthesizer 330 is equipped with a function to suppress the audio level<br>
from the callee terminal when the audio from the first interpreter terminal is detected, and the<br>
callee terminal audio synthesizer 350 is equipped with a function to suppress the audio level<br>
from the caller terminal when the audio from the second interpreter terminal is detected. This<br>
prevents overlapping of the audio of the first interpreter or the second interpreter over the audio<br>
of the opponent party which causes difficulty in listening. The first interpreter and the second<br>
interpreter can simultaneously interpret the speech of the speaker thus allowing a speedy and<br>
precise interpretation.<br>
Fig. 17 shows specific examples of the function to suppress the audio of the callee or caller in the<br>
audio synthesizers 330, 350. As shown in Fig. 17, the audio output of the first interpreter<br>
terminal audio CODEC 366 is connected to a callee terminal audio signal adder 390. The audio<br>
output of the second interpreter terminal audio CODEC 386 is connected to a callee terminal<br>
audio signal adder 393. As a result, the unnecessary voice of the second interpreter is not<br>
transmitted to the caller and the unnecessary voice of the first interpreter is not transmitted to the<br>
callee.<br>
To the caller terminal audio signal adder 390, the audio output of the callee terminal audio<br>
CODEC 346 is connected via an attenuator 391, which attenuates the audio from the callee<br>
terminal when the audio of the first interpreter is detected by the signal detector 392. To the<br>
callee terminal audio signal adder 393, the audio output of the caller terminal audio CODEC 326<br>
is connected via an attenuator 394, which attenuates the audio from the caller terminal when the<br>
audio of the second interpreter is detected by the signal detector 395. The signal detectors 392,<br>
395 are set to an appropriate detection level in order to prevent the audio of the opponent party<br>
from being attenuated by mistake due to a noise and the like.<br>
In order to ensure that the caller or the callee can hear the audio of an interpreter immediately<br>
after the audio of the interpreter is detected by the signal detector 392, 395, an appropriate signal<br>
delay unit may be provided at the interpreter audio input of the audio signal adder 390, 393.<br>
While the audio of the opponent party is attenuated by the attenuator 391, 394 so that the caller<br>
or callee can hear the original voice of the opponent party to some extent in the background of<br>
the audio of the first interpreter or second interpreter in this embodiment, a switch may be used<br>
instead to shut off the audio of the opponent party.<br>
Fig. 18 shows an example where the audio of the opponent party is shut off when the audio of<br>
the interpreter is transmitted and only the audio of the interpreter is transmitted. As shown in<br>
Fig. 18, switches 397, 398 are used instead of the audio signal adders 390, 393. When the audio<br>
of the interpreter is detected by the signal detectors 392, 395, the switches 397, 398 are turned<br>
from the audio of the opponent party to the audio of the interpreter. The remaining<br>
configuration is the same as that shown in Fig. 17.<br>
In order to ensure that the caller or the callee can hear the audio of an interpreter immediately<br>
after the audio of the interpreter is detected by the signal detector 392, 395, an appropriate signal<br>
delay unit may be provided at the interpreter audio input of the switch 397, 398.<br>
While the audio signal adder 390, 393 simply adds the audio of the interpreter and the audio of<br>
the opponent party in the above example, audio multiplexing of two signals may be employed as<br>
well. For example in case a terminal supports a stereophonic audio, stereophonic synthesis is<br>
performed to the audio of the opponent party as the left channel and the audio of the interpreter<br>
as the right channel and the resultant is transmitted to a terminal, where the receiving party<br>
selects a necessary audio. In this configuration, it is not necessary to provide an attenuator to<br>
attenuate the audio of the distant party in the videophone interpretation system. The receiving<br>
party listens to the audios while adjusting the volume balance of the right and left channels of a<br>
headset.<br>
While the first interpreter listens only to the audio of the callee to perform interpretation and the<br>
second interpreter listens only to the audio of the caller to perform interpretation, a configuration<br>
is allowed where the audio of the caller, and the audio of the second interpreter may be attenuated<br>
and added to or audio multiplexed into the audio to be transmitted to the first interpreter, and also<br>
the audio of the callee and the audio of the first interpreter may be attenuated and added to or<br>
audio multiplexed into the audio to be transmitted to the second interpreter. By doing so, each<br>
interpreter can perform interpretation while, checking the progress of the whole conversation and<br>
the response of the interpretee.<br>
The videophone interpretation system 300 is equipped with an interpreter registration table 312<br>
where the terminal number of a terminal used by an interpreter is registered and includes a<br>
controller 310 connected to each of the line I/Fs 320, 340, 360, 380, multiplexers/demultiplexers<br>
322, 342, 362, 382, video synthesizers 328, 348, 368, 388, audio synthesizers 330, 350, and telop<br>
memories 332, 352, 372, 392. The controller 310 provides a function to connect a caller<br>
terminal, a callee terminal, a first interpreter terminal, and a second interpreter terminal by way<br>
of a function to accept a call from a caller terminal, a function to acquire the language type of the<br>
caller and the language type the a callee, a function to acquire the selection conditions for<br>
selecting an interpreter, a function to extract the terminal number of the first interpreter and the<br>
terminal number of the second interpreter by referencing an interpreter registration table 312 by<br>
using the acquired language types and selection conditions, a function to call the first interpreter<br>
terminal and second interpreter terminal by using the terminal numbers of the interpreters<br>
extracted, and a function to call the callee terminal by using the acquired terminal number of the<br>
callee.<br>
Operation of the video synthesizers 328, 348, 368, 388 and audio synthesizers 330, 350 is<br>
controlled by the controller 310. A function is included where the user changes the video output<br>
method or audio output method by pressing a predetermined number button of a dial pad of each<br>
terminal. This is implemented that the multiplexer/demultiplexer 322, 342, 362, 382 detects the<br>
number button on the dial pad of each terminal is pressed based on a data signal or a tone signal<br>
and signals the detection to the controller. This ensures flexibility in the usage of the system on<br>
each terminal. For example, only necessary videos or audios are selected and displayed/output<br>
in accordance with the object or it is possible to replace a main window with a sub window, or<br>
change the position of the sub window.<br>
To the input of the audio synthesizers 328, 348, 368, 388, a caller terminal telop memory 332, a<br>
callee terminal telop memory 352, a first interpreter terminal telop memory 372 and a second<br>
interpreter terminal telop memory 392 are connected respectively. Contents of each telop<br>
memory 332, 352, 372, 392 can be set from the controller 310. With this configuration, by<br>
setting a message to be displayed on each terminal to the telop memory 332, 352, 372, 392 and<br>
issuing a command to select a signal, of the telop memory 332, 352, 372, 392 to the audio<br>
synthesizer 328, 348, 368, 388 in the setup of a videophone conversation via interpretation, it is<br>
possible to transmit necessary messages to respective terminals to establish a four-way call.<br>
In case there is a term which is difficult to explain or a word which is difficult to pronounce in a<br>
videophone conversation, it is possible to register in advance the term in the term registration<br>
table 313 of the controller 310 in association with the number of the dial pad on each terminal.<br>
By doing so, it is possible to detect that the dial pad on each terminal is pressed during a<br>
videophone conversation by using a data signal or a tone signal on the multiplexer/demultiplexer<br>
322, 342, 362, 382, extract a term corresponding to the number of the dial pad pressed from the<br>
term registration table 313, generate a text telop, and set the text telop to each telop memory,<br>
thereby displaying the term on each terminal. This communicates, by way of a text telop, to the<br>
opponent party a term which is difficult to explain or a word which is difficult to pronounce, thus<br>
providing a speedier and more precise videophone conversation.<br>
Next, the connection processing by the controller 310 for establishing a videophone conversation<br>
via bidirectional simultaneous interpretation is described.<br>
In this case also, prior to processing, an interpreter selection information and a terminal number<br>
of a terminal used by each interpreter are registered in the interpreter registration table 312 of the<br>
controller 310 from an appropriate terminal (not shown). Fig. 13 shows an example of<br>
registration item to be registered in the interpreter registration table 312. As shown in Fig. 13,<br>
items registered in the interpreter registration table 312 are same as those registered in the<br>
interpreter registration table 112 shown in Fig. 3 except that a listening comprehension level and<br>
a speaking level are separately registered for a supported language. By doing so, it is possible<br>
to individually select an optimum interpreter as a first interpreter who interprets the language of<br>
the callee into the language of the caller or a second interpreter who interprets the language of<br>
the caller into the language of the callee.<br>
Fig. 14 shows a processing flowchart of the connection processing by the controller 310. The<br>
videophone interpretation system 300 accepts an order for an interpretation services, when the<br>
caller calls to a telephone number of the caller terminal line I/F. The videophone interpretation<br>
system 100 then calls the first interpreter terminal, second interpreter terminal, callee terminal,<br>
and establishes a connection for a bidirectional simultaneous interpretation service is established.<br>
As shown in Fig. 14, the presence of the call to the caller terminal line I/F 320 is detected<br>
initially (S300). When a call is detected, a screen to prompt input of the language type of the<br>
caller similar to that shown in Fig. 5(a) is displayed on the caller terminal (S302). The language<br>
type of the caller input by the caller is acquired (S304). A screen to prompt input of the<br>
language type of the callee similar to that shown in Fig. 5(b) is displayed on the caller terminal<br>
(S306). The language type of the callee input by the caller is acquired (S308). Next, a screen<br>
to prompt the interpreter selection conditions similar to that shown in Fig. 6(a) is displayed on<br>
the caller terminal (S310). The interpreter selection conditions input by the caller are acquired<br>
(S312). In this example, the interpreter selection conditions are, same as the previous single<br>
interpretation, a gender, an age bracket, an area, a specialty and an interpretation level. The area<br>
is specified by using a ZIP code and an interpreter is selected starting with the habitation closest<br>
to the specified area. For any selections, in case it is not necessary to specify a condition, N/A<br>
may be selected.<br>
Next, an interpreter who has a specified listening comprehension level of the language of the<br>
callee and a speaking level of the language of the caller, and whose gender, age, habitation and<br>
specialty satisfy the acquired selection conditions, with his/her availability flag being set is<br>
selected as a first interpreter referring to the interpreter registration table 312 (S314). The<br>
terminal number of the selected interpreter is extracted and called (S316). When a response is<br>
received from the first interpreter terminal (S318), an interpreter who has a specified listening<br>
comprehension level of the language of the caller and a speaking level of the language of the<br>
callee, and whose gender, age, habitation and specialty satisfy the acquired selection conditions,<br>
with his/her availability flag being set is selected as a second interpreter referring to the<br>
interpreter registration table 312 (S320). Then the terminal number of the selected interpreter is<br>
extracted and called (S322).<br>
When a response is received from the second interpreter terminal (S324), a screen to prompt<br>
input of the terminal number of the callee similar to that shown in Fig. 7 is displayed on the<br>
caller terminal (S326). The terminal number of the callee input by the caller is extracted and<br>
called (S328).<br>
When a response is received from the callee terminal (S330), a videophone interpretation service<br>
via bidirectional simultaneous interpretation starts (S332).<br>
In case a response is not received from the first interpreter terminal in S318, whether another<br>
candidate is available is determined (S334). In case another candidate is available, execution<br>
returns to S314 and the procedure is repeated. In case another candidate is unavailable, the<br>
caller terminal is notified as such and the call is released (S336). In case a response is not<br>
received from the second interpreter terminal in S324, whether another candidate is available is<br>
determined (S338). In case another candidate is available, execution returns to S320 and the<br>
procedure is repeated. In case another candidate is unavailable, the caller terminal and first<br>
interpreter terminal are notified as such and the call is released (S340). In case a response is not<br>
received from the callee terminal in S330, the caller terminal, first interpreter terminal and<br>
second interpreter terminal are notified as such and the call is released (S342).<br>
While, in a step of selecting a first interpreter (S314) and a step of selecting a second interpreter<br>
(S320), an interpreter who satisfies predetermined conditions is selected referring to the<br>
interpreter registration table 312 for simplicity in the above example, a configuration is also<br>
possible where, same as the first embodiment, a candidate list similar to that shown in Fig. 6(b)<br>
is displayed and the caller selects an interpreter from the list. In this case, the hourly rates (not<br>
shown) of each of the first interpreter and second interpreter registered in the interpreter<br>
registration table 312 may be extracted and displayed as a charge. This allows the user to<br>
consider the cost of the interpretation service before selecting an appropriate interpreter. The<br>
hourly rates of the interpreter may be determined from the interpretation level of the selected<br>
interpreter by referencing an accounting table which specifies the relationship between the<br>
interpretation level and the hourly rates.<br>
The controller 310 comprises a timer (not shown) for calculating the fee of the interpretation<br>
service. The timer measures the time from when the connection is established to when it is<br>
released. On completion of an interpretation service, the fee is calculated from the time<br>
measured by the timer and sum of the hourly rates of the first interpreter and the second<br>
interpreter mentioned above and registered in a accounting database 314, and charged to the user<br>
later.<br>
While in case the selected interpreter terminal does not accept the call, the caller is simply<br>
notified as such and the call is released in the above embodiment, an interpretation reservation<br>
table to register a caller terminal number and a callee terminal number may be provided and the<br>
caller and the callee may be notified on a later response from both the selected first interpreter<br>
and second interpreter to set a videophone conversation.<br>
While the videophone interpretation system 300 comprises a line I/F, a multiplexer/demultiplexer,<br>
a video CODEC, an audio CODEC, a video synthesizer, an audio synthesizer and a controller in<br>
the above embodiment, these components need not be implemented by individual hardware<br>
(H/W) but the function of each component may be implemented by software processing on a<br>
computer.<br>
While the first interpreter terminal 32 and the second interpreter terminal 34, same as the caller<br>
terminal 10 and the callee terminal 20, is located outside the interpretation center and called from<br>
the interpretation center over a public telephone line to provide an interpretation service in the<br>
above embodiment, the invention is not limited thereto but some or all of the interpreter<br>
terminals may be installed in the interpretation center so that the interpretation services are<br>
provided from the interpretation center.<br>
In the above embodiment, an interpreter can join an interpretation service anywhere he/she may<br>
be, as long as he/she has a terminal which can be connected to a public telephone line. Thus the<br>
interpreter can provide an interpretation service by using the availability flag to make efficient<br>
use of free time. This allows efficient and stably operate of interpretation services which often<br>
have difficulty in securing necessary personel.<br>
While a video signal of the home terminal is not input to the video synthesizers 328, 348, 368,<br>
388 in the above embodiment, a function may be provided to input the video signal of the home<br>
terminal and synthesize and display to check the video on the terminal.<br>
While the video synthesizers 328, 348, 368, 388 are used to synthesize videos for each terminal<br>
in the above embodiment, videos from all terminals may be synthesized at once and the resultant<br>
may be transmitted to each terminal. In this case, as shown in Fig. 21(b) for example, a video of<br>
the caller, a video of the callee, a video of the first interpreter and a video of the second<br>
interpreter may be displayed in a four split screen.<br>
While a function is provided whereby the telop memories 332, 352, 372, 392 are provided and<br>
their outputs are added to the corresponding video synthesizers 328, 348, 368, 388 respectively<br>
in order to display a text telop on each terminal in the above embodiment, a function may be<br>
provided whereby telop memories to store audio information are provided and their outputs are<br>
added to the audio synthesizers 330, 350 and an audio synthesizers is provided at the input of<br>
each of the first interpreter terminal audio CODEC 366 and the second interpreter terminal audio<br>
CODEC 386, and the outputs of the corresponding telop memories are added in order to output<br>
an audio message on each terminal. This makes it possible to provide a videophone<br>
interpretation service even in case any of the caller, the callee, the first interpreter or the second<br>
interpreter is a visually impaired person.<br>
Finally, a recording/reproduction function to record a video or an audio in a videophone<br>
interpretation service and reproduce the audio or video and transmit the resultant upon request by<br>
the user will be described.<br>
Fig. 19 shows an example of a recording/reproduction function in the videophone interpretation<br>
system according to the first embodiment. As shown in Fig. 19, a video from the caller terminal<br>
video CODEC 124, a video from the callee terminal video CODEC 144, and a video from the<br>
interpreter terminal video CODEC 164 are synthesized by the video synthesizer 116 and the<br>
resultant is transmitted to a video/audio recorder/player 118. The audio output of the audio<br>
synthesizer 130 to be transmitted to the caller terminal and the audio output of the audio<br>
synthesizer 150 to be transmitted to the callee terminal are audio multiplexed by an audio<br>
multiplexer 117 assuming the former as the left-channel and the latter as the right-channel, and<br>
the resultant is transmitted to the video/audio recorder/player 118.<br>
The video output of the video synthesizer 116 and the audio output of the audio multiplexer 117<br>
during an interpretation service are automatically recorded onto the video/audio recorder/player<br>
118 and stored for each user based on a command from the controller 110. The video and audio<br>
stored in the video/audio recorder/player 118 are reproduced based on a command from the<br>
controller 110 when the multiplexer/demultiplexer 122 or 142 detect a predetermined dial<br>
number is pressed on the caller terminal or callee terminal, and the reproduced video and audio<br>
are transmitted to each terminal via the video synthesizer 128 or 148 and the audio synthesizer<br>
130 or 150 for the detected terminal.<br>
This allows the user to check a video from each terminal during an interpretation in a four split<br>
screen shown in Fig. 21 (a) and the like, In case the user terminal is equipped with an audio<br>
multiplexing/demultiplexing function, an audio from each terminal can be checked, by the<br>
language of the caller in left-channel and by the language of the callee in right-channel. The<br>
user may call the interpretation center at a later time and input a predetermined access code from<br>
his/her terminal to reproduce and check a video, and an audio stored in the video/audio<br>
recorder/player 118.<br>
11<br>
A method for synthesizing a video or audio to be recorded onto a video/audio recorder/player is<br>
not limited to the above example but may be any method as long as the user can check the<br>
contents of the interpretation service. , In order to support a case where the user terminal is not<br>
equipped with the audio multiplexing/demultiplexing function, an audio transmitted to the caller<br>
and an audio transmitted to the callee may be individually recorded and the audio specified by a<br>
terminal may be reproduced and transmitted.<br>
The user may be a person other than the person who has obtained the interpretation service.<br>
When a person granted an access right has called the interpretation center from a videophone<br>
terminal and input an access code, he/she may receive a video and an audio stored in the<br>
video/audio recorder/player 118.<br>
Fig. 20 shows an example of a recording/reproduction function in the videophone interpretation<br>
system with bidirectional simultaneous interpretation according to the third embodiment. As<br>
shown in Fig. 20, a video from the caller terminal video CODEC 24, a video from the callee<br>
terminal video CODEC 344, a video from the first interpreter terminal video CODEC 364, and a<br>
video from the second interpreter terminal video CODEC 384 are synthesized by the video<br>
synthesizer 316 and the resultant is transmitted to a video/audio recorder/player 318. The audio<br>
output of the audio synthesizer 330 to be transmitted to the caller terminal and the audio output<br>
of the audio synthesizer 350 to be transmitted to the callee terminal are audio multiplexed by an<br>
audio multiplexer 317 assuming the former as the left-channel and the latter as the right-channel,<br>
and the resultant is transmitted to the video/audio recorder/player 318.<br>
The video output of the video synthesizer 316 and the audio output of the audio multiplexer 317<br>
during an interpretation service are automatically recorded onto the video/audio recorder/player<br>
318 and stored for each user based on a command from the controller 310. The video and audio<br>
stored in the video/audio recorder/player 318 are reproduced based on a command from the<br>
controller 310 when the multiplexer/demultiplexer 322 or 342 detect a predetermined dial<br>
number is pressed on the caller terminal or callee terminal is detected, and the reproduced video<br>
and audio are transmitted to each terminal via the video synthesizer 328 or 348 and the audio<br>
synthesizer 330 or 350 for the detected terminal.<br>
This allows the user to check a video from each terminal during an interpretation in a four split<br>
screen shown in Fig. 21(b) and the like. In case the user terminal is equipped with an audio<br>
multiplexing/demultiplexing function, an audio from each terminal can be checked, by the<br>
language of the caller in left-channel and by the language of the callee in right-channel. The<br>
user may call the interpretation center at a later time and input a predetermined access code from<br>
his/her terminal to reproduce and check a video and an audio stored in the video/audio<br>
recorder/player 318. <br>
A method for synthesizing a video or audio to be recorded onto a video/audio recorder/player is<br>
not limited to the above example but may be any method as long as the user can check the<br>
contents of the interpretation service. ,In order to support a case where the user terminal is not<br>
equipped with the audio multiplexing/demultiplexing function, an audio transmitted to the caller<br>
and an audio transmitted to the callee may be individually recorded and the audio specified by a<br>
terminal may be reproduced and transmitted.<br>
The user may be a person other than the person who has obtained the interpretation service.<br>
When a person granted an access right has called the interpretation center from a videophone<br>
terminal and input an access code, he/she may receive a video and an audio stored in the<br>
video/audio recorder/player 318.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As mentioned above, the videophone interpretation system or videophone interpretation method<br>
of the invention is advantageous in that a caller does not have to search for an interpreter in<br>
advance and hold consultation with a callee and that the system and the method are available also<br>
in an emergency, thereby minimizing the restraint time of the interpreter to reduce the<br>
interpretation service cost.<br>
