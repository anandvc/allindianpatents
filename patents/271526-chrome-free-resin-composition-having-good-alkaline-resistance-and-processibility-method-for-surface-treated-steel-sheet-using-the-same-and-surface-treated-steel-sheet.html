[Background Art]<br>
Recently, the controls over the use of environmental pollutants, for example Cr, Pb, Cd, Hg, PBB, PBDE, etc. have been strengthened all over the world with an increasing concern in environmental issues. As representative examples of the controls, there are, in particular, Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS, enforced on July 01, 2006), Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE, enforced on July 01, 2006), Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH), End-of-Life Vehicles (ELV, enforced on January 01, 2007), etc., all of which were adopted by EU. These require all enterprises all over the world to positively cope with new policies for environmental management such as development of environment-friendly product,  reduction  of wastes  in  factories,  green purchasing,  etc.<br>
In the past, a surface-treating method for coating a surface of a steel sheet   with   chromate   film  including   chrome   as   a   major   component   has   been<br>
widely used to give corrosion resistance and paint adhesion to galvanized steel sheets, galvannealed steel sheets, aluminized steel sheets, aluminum alloy coated steel sheets, cold-rolled steel sheets and hot-rolled steel sheets, which have been used for automotive materials, home appliances, building materials, etc. Major chromate treatments are carried out using electrolytic chromate and coating-type chromate. Among them, an electrolytic chromate treatment is generally carried out by cathodically electrolyzing a metal plate with a treatment solution that includes hexavalent chrome as a major component and also include various negative ions such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid and halogen as the other components. Meanwhile, the coating-type chromate treatment is generally carried out by dipping a metal plate into a treatment solution, or spraying a treatment solution onto a metal plate, wherein the treatment solution is prepared by adding inorganic colloids and inorganic ions to a solution in which some of hexavalent chrome is  reduced  into  trivalent  chrome  in  advance.<br>
These methods require a variety of countermeasures against work environments, sewage disposals, etc. due to the toxicity of hexavalent chrome in the chromate treatment solution. Also, the recycling and waste disposal of automobiles, electronic appliances, building materials, all of which use the surface-treated metals, cause problems regarding harmfulness to human body and environmental pollutions. Furthermore, the use of trivalent chrome is also problematic since some of the trivalent chrome is converted into hexavalent chrome by surrounding conditions such as temperature, microorganisms,  etc.<br>
Therefore,     steel    companies    have    concentrated    their    efforts    on<br>
developing  a  chrome-free,   surface-treated  steel  sheet  that  does  not  include<br>
hexavalent    chrome    and   simultaneously    satisfies   various    requirements    of<br>
desired characteristics such as corrosion resistance, alkaline resistance, conductivity, etc. In the prior art, a chrome-free, surface-treated metal sheet was manufactured by primarily coating a surface of a steel sheet with a metal salt film containing phosphate as a major component and secondarily coating the primarily coated steel sheet surface with a resin film containing acryl, epoxy and urethane resin as a major component, or forming each of the primary  and  secondary  films  with  a  resin  film.<br>
However, the products have problems that it is not suitable to suppress electromagnetic waves and inner noises from photocopiers, printers, VCRs, computers and the like, and ensure their processibilities since the electrical conductivity and weldability of the metal sheet are often deteriorated  according  to  the  thickness  of metal  salt  or  film.<br>
With a recent increasing demand for a chrome-free, surface-treated steel sheet having excellent conductivity, there have been attempts to develop a chrome-free coated steel sheet using a method of primarily coating the resin film in the field of most home appliances companies. However, as far as a resin-based surface treating composition does not have especially excellent components, the quality characteristics (i.e. corrosion resistance, etc) of the surface-treated steel sheet are more highly deteriorated than that in conventional steel sheets that are not treated with chrome or phosphate. However, the major foreign and domestic home appliances companies have recently established their own quality standard and purchased only certified products in the case of the chrome-free, surface-treated steel sheet  as  an  alternative  to  develop  their  own  environment-friendly products.<br>
Japanese   Patent   Laid-open   Publication   No.    Hei8-92479   and   Japanese<br>
Patent  Laid-open  Publication  No.  Hei8-500770  disclose  a  method  for  coating  a<br>
metal   plate   with   a  polyaniline   coating   composition   that   does   not   contain<br>
hexavalent  chrome  at  all  in  consideration  of  the  conductivity.  However,  since<br>
the  polyaniline  having  high  rigidity  and  low  adhesion  is  present  between  the<br>
metal   and   a   resin   film,   the   resin   film  may   be   easily   peeled   out   from<br>
interfaces  between  the  polyaniline  and  the  metal,  and  between  the  polyaniline<br>
and  the  resin.   Therefore,   problems  occur  when  an  upper  surface  of  a  steel<br>
sheet  is  painted  in  order  to  give  designs,   corrosion  resistance  and  other<br>
functions  to  the  steel  sheet.   Films  having  low  adhesion  have  been  generally<br>
known  to  have  a  low  corrosion  resistance.  Also,   the  low  solution  stability<br>
may   cause   precipitates   and   bad   smell,    which   leads   to   the   deteriorated<br>
workability  such  as  general  impediments  to  the  work  environment,   etc.  A  Zn-<br>
coated  layer  shows  its  excellent  effect  to  improve  characteristics  such  as<br>
conductivity,   corrosion  resistance,   alkaline  resistance,   resistance  to  high<br>
temperature  and  high  humidity  by  using  the  method  of  only  primarily  coating<br>
the  Zn-coated  layer  with  resin,   and  since  some  severely  processed  products<br>
lack  processibilities,   damages   are   caused  to  a   resin   layer  and  a   coating<br>
layer  of  a  processed  friction  portion,  which  leads  to  the  loss  of  the  resin<br>
layer  and  the  change  of  a  surface  into  a  black  surface.<br>
Furthermore,   US   Publication   No.    2004-54044   discloses   a   composition<br>
prepared  by  mixing  a  hexafluoro  complex   (i.e.  titanium,   zirconium,  etc.)  and<br>
at  least  one  inorganic  compound  with  an  organic  film  forming  agent  in  water.<br>
However,   the  composition  adversely  affects  the  environment  since  it  contains<br>
a  fluorine  complex,  and  should  be  also  carefully  handled  due  to  its  acidity.<br>
Also,    Japanese   Patent   Laid-open   Publication   No.   2002-030460   discloses   a<br>
composition  prepared by mixing  a  vanadium compound  and  Zi  and Ti  with  a mixed<br>
resin.   However,   the  problem  is   that  an  etching  process  on  a  surface  of  a<br>
steel  sheet  should  be  carried  out  in  an  acidic  solution  so  as  to  reduce  a<br>
vanadium  compound  and  ensure  the  adhesion.  Also,  Korean  Patent  Publication No.<br>
2006-76953 discloses a surface-treating composition including an antirust agent and a metal chelating agent, in which a complex of organic resin and inorganic binder is prepared using a silane coupling agent, etc. However, the problem is that the complex of organic resin and inorganic binder should be prepared in advance. Also, some products whose alkaline resistance is necessarily required have problems that a resin layer is damaged due to the lack of alkaline resistance when it is in contact with an alkali solution, which leads to the loss of the resin layer or the severely discolored surface of the product. Furthermore, Japanese Patent No. 3706518 discloses a resin composition including an organic resin and a phosphate compound selected from the group consisting of ammonium phosphate, sodium phosphate and potassium phosphate. However, the use object of the phosphate compound is restricted to play a role in improving corrosion resistance by forming a thin passivation layer  on  a  steel  sheet.<br>

[Best Mode]<br>
Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail.<br>
The present invention is related to a resin composition for surface-treating a steel sheet capable of improving alkaline resistance and processibilities and manufacturing a metal sheet having physical properties such as conductivity, corrosion resistance and chemical resistance by coating a steel sheet with a chrome-free resin composition including a urethane resin mixture of soft urethane resin and hard urethane resin, a corrosion-resistant curing agent (such as Ti or Zr organic oxides), at least one compound selected from the group consisting of monoaluminum phosphate, aluminum dihydrogen phosphate, monozinc phosphate and hydrated manganese phosphate, and  a  solvent.<br>
The urethane resin mixture of soft urethane resin and hard urethane resin is used for the resin composition according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Here, the urethane resin has strong physical properties such as water resistance, chemical resistance, acid resistance and alkaline resistance, and include soft and tough coating film, and therefore the urethane resin is used to prevent scratches of a surface of a steel sheet or an aluminum plate by painting the steel sheet or the aluminum plate, or widely used to give chemical resistance to the steel sheet or the aluminum plate.<br>
The urethane resin mixture is present in a solid concentration of 10 to 90 % by weight, based on the total solid content of the resin composition. When the total solid concentration of the urethane resin mixture is less than 10 % by weight, the urethane resin does not show salt water resistance against the penetration of corrosive ions and chemical resistance against the penetration of chemical substances, which leads to the deteriorated chemical resistance and alkaline resistance of the resin composition. Therefore, a resin film may be discolored or peeled off when the resin film was degreased at 60▒ for 5 minutes in an alkali solution with pH 10 or higher. On the contrary, when the total solid concentration of the urethane resin mixture exceeds 90 % by weight, the solution stability of the resin composition is deteriorated due to its agglomeration, and the manufacturing cost may be increased  due  to  the  use  of  the  excessive  urethane  resin.<br>
However,   since  the  exclusive  use  of  the  urethane  resin  has  its  limits<br>
to  realize  a  soft  and  tough  property  of  the  resin  film,   the  urethane  resin<br>
mixture  of  soft  urethane  resin  and  hard  urethane  resin  is  used  in  the  present<br>
invention.  The  soft  urethane  resin  is  present  in  a  content  of  5  to  95  %  by<br>
weight,  based  on  the  solid  concentration  of  the  urethane  resin  mixture.  When<br>
the solid concentration of the soft urethane resin is less than 5 % by weight, the processibilities of a surface-treated steel sheet are improved, but its heat resistance and water resistance are deteriorated, whereas the corrosion resistance of the surface-treated steel sheet is highly degraded without improving its processibilities when the solid concentration of the soft urethane  resin  exceeds  95  %  by weight.<br>
Also, a molecular weight of the soft urethane resin is preferably in a range of 5,000 to 300,000. When the molecular weight of the soft urethane resin is less than 5,000, the processibilities of the surface-treated steel sheet are highly degraded, but the solution stability of the resin composition becomes low when the molecular weight of the soft urethane resin exceeds  300,000.<br>
The soft urethane resin that may be used herein includes, but is not particularly limited to, a polyurethane dispersion resin, a polyurethane resin (i.e. polyethylene-modified polyurethane resin, etc.) prepared from isoprene diisocyanate, adipic acid and polyhydric alcohol, and a polyurethane resin (i.e. an acryl-urethane resin, a polyethylene-acryl-modified polyurethane resin, etc.) prepared from acryl polyol and pooyisocyanate. Here, acryl polyol, polyesterpolyol, polyetherpolyol, polyolefin polyol and the like may be  used  as  the  polyhydric  alcohol.<br>
Also, a molecular weight of the hard urethane resin is preferably is in a range of 200,000 to 2,000,000. When the molecular weight of the hard urethane resin is less than 200,000, the processibilities of the surface-treated steel sheet are not improved, whereas, when the molecular weight of the hard urethane resin exceeds 2,000,000, the low solution stability of the resin  composition  and  the  increased  viscosity  of  the  resin  solution  results<br>
in  the  deteriorated workability of  the  resin  composition.<br>
The hard urethane resin that may be used herein includes, but is not particularly limited to, a polyurethane resin prepared from polycaprolactone polyol or polycarbonate polyol and isocyanate (in particular, p-phenylenediisocyanate) , a polyurethane resin prepared from 4,4'-bis(ω-hydroxyalkyleneoxy)biphenyl and methyl-2,6-diisocyanatehexanoate, a polyurethane  resin  having  an  acetal  bond,  etc.<br>
Also, the hard urethane resin having a Shore A hardness of 40 to 90 is used preferably to manufacture a dried film. When the Shore A hardness of the hard urethane resin is less than 40, the processibilities of the resin composition are not improved, whereas, when the Shore A hardness of the hard urethane resin exceeds 90, a thin film is too hard to broke during its processing, and therefore the resin composition has no effect to improve processibilities. As a result, the hard urethane resin preferably has a hardness  within  the  range.<br>
Ti or Zr organic oxide as a corrosion-resistant curing agent is added to the urethane resin. The corrosion-resistant curing agent is present in a content of 1 to 20 % by weight, based on the total solid content of the resin composition. In this case, when the content of the corrosion-resistant curing agent is less than 1 % by weight, its addition effect is not sufficient due to the deteriorated corrosion resistance. On the contrary, when the content of the corrosion-resistant curing agent exceeds 20 % by weight, the corrosion-resistant curing agent may be abundantly precipitated due to its saturated concentration in the resin composition, and the properties (such as corrosion resistance, alkaline resistance and water resistance) of the resin composition  are  degraded with deterioration  of  the  solution  stability.<br>
Desirable  examples  of  the  Ti  or  Zr-based  organic  oxide  include,  but  is<br>
not   particularly   limited   to,   titanium  diisopropoxide   bis(acetylacetonate),<br>
titanium       orthoester,        titanium        (IV)        butoxide,        titanium        (IV) (triethanolaminato)  isopropoxide,  tetrakis  (triethanolaminato)  zirconium  (IV), titanium   (IV)   2-ethylhexoxide,   titanium   (IV)   isopropoxide,   zirconium   (IV) bis(diethyl  citrato)-dipropoxide,   etc.  The  resin  composition  may  include  at least  one  compound  selected  from the  listed  compounds.<br>
Also, the resin composition for surface-treating a steel sheet according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes at least one compound selected from the group consisting of monoaluminum phosphate, aluminum dihydrogen phosphate, monozinc phosphate, hydrated manganese phosphate, etc. These compounds are added to improve adhesion between a resin (particularly, a zinc coating layer) and a steel sheet, and has effects to improve corrosion resistance, as well as conductivity and heat resistance owing to the metal salt effect by forming a passivation film on the  zinc  coating  layer.<br>
The   compounds   such   as   monoaluminum   phosphate,    aluminum   dihydrogen<br>
phosphate,  monozinc  phosphate  and  hydrated  manganese  phosphate  is  preferably<br>
added  in  a  content  of  0.1   to   10.0   %  by  weight,   based  on  the  total   solid<br>
content  of  the  resin  composition.  When  the  compounds  are  added  in  a  content<br>
of  less  than  0.1  %  by  weight,  they  have  a  low  adhesion  to  a  steel  sheet,  and<br>
therefore  the  resin  film  may  be  easily  peeled  off  during  processes  such  as<br>
alkali  degreasing,   etc.   On  the  contrary,   when  the  compounds  are  added  in  a<br>
content  of  greater  than  10.0  %  by weight,  the  solution  stability  of  the  resin<br>
composition  may  be  deteriorated  since  the  excessive  compounds  do  not  improve<br>
the   adhesion   between   the   resin   and   the   steel   sheet,    but   promote   the<br>
agglomeration  of  the  resin,   and  also  the  adhesion  between  the  resin  and  the<br>
steel  sheet may be  rather  deteriorated.<br>
A  component  except  for  the  solid  content  in  the  resin  composition  is  a<br>
solvent, and water may be used as the solvent. In addition, an alcohol solvent and an aqueous alkaline solution may be further separately added to the resin composition in order to enhance wetting and dispersing properties of the coating composition. Ethanol, methanol, propanol, isopropanol, glycerol and the like may be used as the alcohol solvent, amine compound, N-methylpyrrolidone, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, ammonium hydroxide  and the  like may be  used  as  the  aqueous  alkaline  solution.<br>
The resin composition has excellent resin solution stability and shows its effects to further improve corrosion resistance, conductivity, alkaline resistance, resistance to high temperature and high humidity of an anticorrosive coating layer since particles of the corrosion-resistant curing agent are uniformly dispersed by its reaction with organic functional groups of  the  resin.<br>
Also,    the    resin    composition    for    surface-treating    a    steel    sheet<br>
according  to  one  exemplary  embodiment  of  the  present  invention  may  further<br>
include  at  least  one  additive  such  as  a  wetting  agent,  a  cross-linking  agent,<br>
a  lubricant,   an  antifoaming  agent,   etc.   The  wetting  agent  has  an  effect  to<br>
form  stripes  and  improve  the  adhesion,  the  cross-linking  agent  has  an  effect<br>
to  improve  the  corrosion  resistance  and  alkaline  resistance,   the  lubricant<br>
has  an  effect  on  a  coefficient  of  friction  and  the  processibilities,  and  the<br>
antifoaming  agent  has  an  effect   to  further  improve  the  workability.   These<br>
additives  are  preferably  used  in  a  content  of  5  to  25  %  by  weight,  based  on<br>
the  solid  content  of  the  resin  composition.  When  the  content  of  the  additive<br>
is   less   than   5   %   by  weight,   an   effect   of   the   additive   on  the   corrosion<br>
resistance,   alkaline  resistance,   etc.   is  not  shown,  but  when  the  content  of<br>
the  additive  exceeds  25  %  by weight,  an  insignificant  effect  on  the  addition<br>
of  the  additive  is  shown  due  to  its  saturation,   and  the  solution  stability<br>
may be  also  degraded.<br>
The   wetting   agent   includes   a   deflocculating   wetting   and   dispersing agent,  polymeric  wetting  and  dispersing  gent,  etc.  Desirable  examples  of  the wetting   agent   include,   but   are   not   particularly   limited   to,   wetting   and dispersing  agents  commercially  available  from EFKA and  Tego,  EFKA  3580  (Ciba), BW-W500  (Buhmwoo  Chemical),  WET  500  (Ciba),  etc.<br>
The cross-linking agent that may be used herein includes, but is not particularly limited to, vinylsilane, methoxysilane, acrylsilane, epoxysilane, chlorosilane, alkoxysilane, silazane, silylating agent, melamine, melamine resin, alkylmelamine, alkylmelamine resin, fluorinated melamine and fluorinated melamine resin, polyamine-based, alkylated aromatic polyamine-based,  polyamide-based  or  acid  anhydride-based  curing  agent,  etc.<br>
The  lubricant  includes,  but  is  not  particularly  limited  to,  silicon  wax, polyethylene   wax,    polypropylene   wax,    amide   wax,    polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)  wax,  paraffin wax,  etc.<br>
The antifoaming agent that may be used herein includes, but is not particularly limited to, oil-type, modified oil-type, solution-type, powder-type,  emulsion-type  silicon  antifoaming  agents.<br>
An amount of an attached coating layer coated with the resin composition  according  to  one  exemplary  embodiment  of  the  present  invention  is<br>
preferably  in  a  range  of  300  to  1, 800mg/m2  after  the  drying  of  the  coating<br>
layer, and a drying temperature (PMT) is in a range of 80▒ to 200▒, which are similar to the drying temperature of the conventional resin surface-treating   solution.   In  this   case,   when  the  amount   of  the   attached  coating<br>
layer is less than 300mg/m2, the corrosion resistance and processibilities of the   resin   composition   are   not   improved,   whereas   when   the   amount   of   the<br>
attached   coating   layer   exceeds    1,800mg/m2,    an   effect    on   the   corrosion<br>
resistance is saturated, and the economical efficiency is low due to the low conductivity and the high manufacturing cost. Also, although the corrosion resistance of the resin film is increasingly improved as the drying temperature increases, it is reasonable to satisfy clients' requirements for products when the products are manufactured within the drying temperature of 80  to  200▒.<br>
Also, a metal plate that is applicable in the present invention includes, but is not particularly limited to, a galvanized steel sheet, an electrogalvanized steel sheet such as a zinc/nickel-coated steel sheet, a zinc/iron-coated steel sheet, a zinc/titanium-coated steel sheet, a zinc/magnesium-coated steel sheet, a zinc/manganese-coated steel sheet, a zinc/aluminized-steel sheet and the like, a hot-dip-coated steel sheet, an aluminized steel sheet, a coated steel sheet whose coating layer includes different metals or impurities, for example, cobalt, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel, titanium, aluminum, manganese, iron, magnesium, tin, copper, etc., a coated steel sheet having a coating layer dispersed with inorganic substances such as silica and alumina, an aluminum alloy plate including silicon, copper, magnesium, iron, manganese, titanium, zinc, etc., a phosphate-coated galvanized steel sheet, a cold-rolled steel sheet, a hot-rolled steel sheet, etc. Also, a multilayer coating layer in which at least two coated steel sheets  are  sequentially  stacked  is  applicable  in  the  present  invention.<br>
