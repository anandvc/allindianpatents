The innovation is a method of producing the Coir Tufted<br>
Rubber Mats.<br>
A. Purpose and back ground of invention<br>
At present the PVC tufted coir mats are made by using liquid compounded PVC and sized coir bits. The liquid PVC is made to pass through non-stick Teflon conveyor. Simultaneously coir yarns from spools are fed to the cutting chamber, wherein the yarn is evenly cut. Thereafter uniformly cut coir yarn is passed through conveyor and the same is perpendicularly embedded over the liquid PVC, by application of little pressure over the top of the bristles. The substance are later passed through a heating chamber where they gets cured and comes out as sheared PVC tufted coir mats and rolls. These mats are not eco-friendly and are not anti-skid.<br>
The rubber tufted coir mats are also available which is made by using mould of a definite size and shape. The process of making rubber tufted mats is as follows: The rubber sheet is spread in the mould. Then coir yarn is thickly and tightly wounded on several iron strips. These iron stripes are then placed into the mould over the rubber sheets. Then the assembly is put to the process of vulcanization by pressing in a hot hydraulic press. Thereafter the top of the coir yarn is cut and the iron strips are released from the mould. The so produced rubber tufted coir mats, though are eco friendly and anti-skid, suffer the following deficiencies:<br>
i. It is the twisted coir which gets embedded into the rubber. So as soon as the top of the yarn is cut the bottom portion gradually loses the grip and comes out of the rubber basement of the mat.<br><br>
ii.  Since the iron stripes are used the coir yarn is tufted in lines .<br>
in. Since coir yarn is embeded in the rubber compounded sheets, the coir fiber of the coir yarn gets loosened and sheds away.<br>
iv. The rubber tufted mats can be produced only in a definite size and shape to that of the mould.<br>
B.Innovation.<br>
(a) The innovation consists of a new process for the manufacture of coir tufted Rubber mats which are free from all the above deficiencies. The product under the invention is manufactured by embedding the straight and evenly cut coir fiber from the coir yarn into rubber-compounded sheets. The coir tufted rubber mat is of continuous length in rolls. The coir tufted mat in rolls can be cut into any size and shape. There is no need to use mould or hot hydraulic press.<br>
(b)<br>
The components used are the following:-<br>
Natural Rubber	-1<br>
Synthetic Rubber	-2<br>
Reclaimed Rubber	-3<br>
Rubber Chemicals	-4<br>
[Zinc oxide, Stearic Acid, Accelerators, Anti oxidants, Sulphur, Booster etc]<br><br>
tiller [Rubber waste powder China-clay etc]<br>
Plasticisers	-6<br>
Rubber process oil	-7<br>
Coir-yarn	-8<br>
Rubber Mixing Mill	-9<br>
Calendering Machine	-10<br>
Coir-Tufting Machine	-11<br>
Heating Chambers	-12<br>
Side Cutters	-13<br>
Shearing Machine	-14<br>
Winders	-15<br>
Cutting Machine	-16<br>
Kneader Machine	-17<br>
The components 1 to 7 are mixed in number 9 machine for 20 to 50 minutes in order to get flexible rubber compound. The duration of the mixing process can be reduced to 6 to 15 minutes, by first applying the (1 to 7) components in (no. 17) kneader machine.<br>
The rubber compound can also be produced by mixing rubber latex with hardener and other rubber chemicals mentioned above in agitators of planetary movements.<br>
The mixed rubber compound is applied through (no. 10) calendaring machine and sheeted-out in required thickness and width. Thus the rubber-compounded sheet is produced. The next phase of the process begins from the passing of the sheeted rubber compound to Teflon<br><br>
conveyor to the (no-11) stuffing machine. The heating chamber, provided at the starting point of the conveyor, melts the sheeted rubber compound and makes more flexible and soft so as to penetrate the coir fiber. If the rubber compound used is that mixed in the agitator, it can be directly pumped and spread to the Teflon conveyor at the required thickness.<br>
The coir yarn from the spools, positioned in the stand, are fed to the cutting chamber of the tufting machine, (no. 11)<br>
The coir yarn is cut into bits of required length and passed through a cavity specially designed to perpendicularly position the coir fiber. The length of the coir fiber ranges from 15mm to 40mm. The evenly cut yarn is of this very small length loosens and become individual fibers. The vertical coir fiber is fed in a running Teflon conveyor in which soft and highly flexible rubber compound are fed. By a very sensitive and delicate pressing operation the coir fiber is tufted into flexible rubber compound. The embedded rubber compound is passed through heating zone for vulcanizing at a temperature ranging from 100'C to 150' C, and coir tufted rubber mat is obtained in roll. The roll is unwound, sheared and cut to any perfect size or shape. Thus, the coir tufted rubber mat in roll is produced. The roll thus obtained can be cut into desired size and shapes. The mats made according to this invention can be used as door mats, mattings, panels, carpets and the like, and may also be made by using natural fibers like sisal, jute and hemp.<br><br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM :<br>
1.	The process of making coir tufted rubber mats in rolls, by tufting<br>
perpendicularly the evenly cut coir yarn into a soft flexible<br>
sheeted rubber compound, obtained through mixing of natural<br>
rubber, synthetic rubber, reclaimed rubber, rubber chemicals fillers<br>
and process oil, in a kneader machine or in a mixing mill OR by<br>
mixing rubber latex, rubber chemicals, fillers and hardener in a<br>
planetary moving agitator.<br>
2.	The process and method as claimed in claim no. I above, wherein<br>
the rubber compound is vulcanized in the heating chamber of the<br>
tufting machine at a temperature ranging from 100' C to 150' C.<br>
3.	The process and method as claimed in claim No. 1 and 2 above<br>
whereby the coir tufted rubber mat in roll are produced.<br>
