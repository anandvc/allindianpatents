				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the papermaking arts. More specifically, the<br>
present invention is a papermaker's or dryer fabric for use on the dryer section<br>
of a paper machine, such as on a single-run dryer section.<br>
During the papermaking process, a fibrous web is formed by depositing a<br>
fibrous slurry on a forming fabric in the forming section of a paper machine.<br>
A large amount of water drains from the slurry through the forming fabric,<br>
leaving the fibrous web on the surface thereof.<br>
The newly formed web proceeds from the forming section to a press section,<br>
which includes a series of press nips. The fibrous web passes through the<br>
press nips supported by a press fabric, or, as is often the case, between two<br>
press fabrics. In the press nips, the fibrous web is subjected to compressive<br>
forces which squeeze water therefrom. This water is accepted by the press<br>
fabric or fabrics and, ideally, does not return to the web.<br>
The web, by now a sheet, finally proceeds to a dryer section, which includes at<br>
least one series of rotatable dryer drums or cylinders which are heated from<br>
within by steam. The sheet is directed in a serpentine path sequentially around<br>
each in the series of drums by one or more dryer fabrics, which hold it closely<br>
against the surfaces of the drums. The heated drums reduce the water content<br>
of the sheet to a desirable level through evaporation.<br>
In a dryer section, the dryer cylinders may be arranged in a top and a bottom<br>
row or tier. Those in the bottom tier may be staggered relative to those in the<br>
top tier, rather than being in a strict vertical relationship. As the sheet proceeds<br>
through the dryer section, it may pass alternately between the top and bottom<br>
tiers as it passes first around a dryer cylinder in one of the two tiers, then<br>
around a dryer cylinder in the other tier, and so on sequentially through the<br>
dryer section.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, in dryer sections, the top and bottom tiers of dryer<br>
cylinders may each be clothed with a separate dryer fabric 99. In such a<br>
situation, paper sheet 98 being dried passes unsupported across the space, or<br>
"pocket", between each dryer cylinder and the next dryer cylinder on the other<br>
tier.<br>
In a single tier dryer section, a single row of cylinders along with a<br>
number of turning rolls may be used. The turning rolls may be solid or vented.<br>
In order to increase production rates and to minimize disturbance to the<br>
sheet, single-run dryer sections are used to transport the sheet being dried at<br>
high speeds. In a single-run dryer section, such as that shown in Figure 8, a<br>
paper sheet 198 is transported by use of a single dryer fabric 199 follows a<br>
serpentine path sequentially about dryer cylinders 200 hi the top and bottom<br>
tiers.<br>
It will be appreciated that, in a single-run dryer section, the dryer fabric<br>
holds the paper sheet being dried directly against the dryer cylinders in one of<br>
the two tiers, typically the top tier, but carries it around the dryer cylinders in<br>
the bottom tier. The fabric return run is above the top dryer cylinders. On the<br>
other hand, some single-run dryer sections have the opposite configuration in<br>
which the dryer fabric holds the paper sheet directly against the dryer cylinders<br>
in the bottom tier, but carries it around the top cylinders. In this case, the fabric<br>
return run is below the bottom tier of cylinders. In either case, a compression<br>
wedge is formed by air carried along by the backside surface of the moving<br>
dryer fabric in the narrowing space where the moving dryer fabric approaches a<br>
dryer cylinder. The resulting increase in air pressure in the compression wedge<br>
causes air to flow outwardly through the dryer fabric. This air flow, in turn,<br>
forces the paper sheet away from the surface of the dryer fabric, a phenomenon<br>
known as "drop off1. "Drop off' can reduce the quality of the paper product<br>
being manufactured by causing edge cracks. "Drop off1 can also reduce<br>
machine efficiency if it leads to sheet breaks.<br>
Many paper mills have addressed this problem by machining grooves<br>
into the dryer cylinders of the lower tier and/or rolls or by adding a vacuum<br>
source to the dryer rolls. Both of these expedients allow the air otherwise<br>
trapped in the compression wedge to be removed without passing through the<br>
dryer fabric, although both are expensive.<br>
The present invention provides a solution to this problem in the form of<br>
a dryer fabric having void volume on at least one of its surfaces, that is on its<br>
back side surface which does not come into contact with the paper web and/or<br>
on its front side surface which does come into contact with the paper web. The<br>
void volume gives the air carried into the compression wedge somewhere to go<br>
other than through the fabric.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is a dryer fabric, although it may find<br>
application in any of the forming, press and dryer sections of a paper machine.<br>
The papermaker's fabric includes a first layer and a second layer of<br>
cross-machine-direction (CD) yarns and a plurality of machine-direction (MD)<br>
yarns arranged in groups each having a first MD yarn, two second MD yarns,<br>
and two third MD yarns. The first MD yarn in each group is interwoven with<br>
CD yarns of the first and second layers in a duplex weave, binding with two CD<br>
yarns of the first layer and with two CD yarns of the second layer when<br>
interweaving therewith within a repeat pattern. The second MD yarns hi each<br>
group are also interwoven with CD yarns of first and second layers in a duplex<br>
weave, binding with only one CD yarn of the first layer when interweaving<br>
therewith and floating over at least two consecutive CD yarns of the second<br>
layer when interweaving therewith within the repeat pattern. The third MD<br>
yarns in each group are also interwoven with CD yarns of the first and second<br>
layers in a duplex weave, binding with only one CD yarn of the first layer when<br>
interweaving therewith and floating over at least two consecutive CD yarns of<br>
the second layer when interweaving therewith within the repeat pattern. The<br>
second MD yarns are offset from the third MD yarns in a direction parallel to<br>
the MD yarns. The first MD yam is between two second MD yarns which are<br>
between the two third MD yarns in each group. As such, in each group, a<br>
continuous air channel is formed by the first MD yam between the second MD<br>
yarns.<br>
Each group may further include a fourth MD yarn which is interwoven<br>
with the CD yams of the first and second layers in a duplex weave such that the<br>
fourth MD yam binds with two CD yarns of the first layer and with two CD<br>
yarns of the second layer when interweaving therewith within a repeat pattern.<br>
The fourth MD yarn may be offset from the first MD yarn in the direction<br>
parallel to the MD yarns. Additionally, the fourth MD yam in each group is<br>
between one of the third MD yarns thereof and one of the third MD yarns of an<br>
adjacent group, whereby a second continuous air channel may be formed in<br>
each group.<br>
The fabric may be disposed on the dryer section hi endless form, such<br>
that the continuous air channels reside on the back-side (or inner) surface and/or<br>
the front side surface thereof. The continuous air channels provide void volume<br>
for air carried into the compression wedge formed between the fabric and a<br>
dryer cylinder when the fabric is used on a dryer section such as a single-run<br>
dryer section.<br>
The present invention will now be described in more complete detail<br>
with frequent reference being made to the drawing figures, which are identified<br>
below.<br>

group<br>
The present invention will now be described in more complete detail with frequent reference being made<br>
to the drawing figures, which are identified below.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a plan view of a surface of a papermaker's fabric according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a plan view of another surface of the papermaker's fabric of Figure 1 ;<br>
Figure 3A is a cross-sectional view taken in the warpwise direction as indicated by line 3-3 in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3B is a cross-sectional view of a papermaker's fabric according to another embodiment of the<br>
present invention<br>
5<br>
shape of MD yarns 41-52 is shown in Figure 4, a cross-sectional view taken in<br>
the weftwise direction as indicted by line 4-4 in Figure 1.<br>
MD yarns 41-52 are arranged in groups of three in which two MD yarns<br>
are twinned and weave as one with the CD yarns 21-32. Specifically, MD yarns<br>
42,43; MD yarns 45,46; MD yarns 48,49; and MD yarns 51,52 are twinned<br>
pairs, which are separated from those adjacent thereto by MD yarns<br>
41,44,47,50. These latter MD yarns 41,44,47,50 define continuous air channels<br>
60 on the surface 12 of the fabric 10 in a manner to be described below.<br>
The twinned MD yam pairs form long floats on the surface 12 of the<br>
fabric 10. Specifically, MD yarns 42,43 weave under CD yarns 21 and 22, over<br>
CD yarns 23-31, and under CD yarns 32 in each repeat of the weave pattern,<br>
whereby MD yarns 42,43 float over four consecutive CD yarns 24,26,28,30 of<br>
the second layer 16 on the surface 12 of the fabric 10. MD yarns 48,49 weave in<br>
the same manner as MD yams 42,43.<br>
Similarly, MD yarns 45,46 weave over CD yarns 21-25, under CD yarns<br>
26-28, and over CD yarns 29-32 in each repeat of the weave pattern, whereby<br>
MD yarns 45,46 float over four consecutive CD yarns 30,32,22,24 of the second<br>
layer 16 on the surface 12 of the fabric 10. MD yarns 51,52 weave in the same<br>
manner as MD yarns 45,46. The floats formed by MD yams 45,46 and MD<br>
yarns 51,52 are offset in the machine direction from those formed by MD yarns<br>
42,43 and MD yarns 48,49 by six CD yarns.<br>
MD yarns 41,44,47,50, which separate the twinned MD yarn pairs from<br>
one another, weave over three CD yarns and under the following three CD yams<br>
I<br>
in a repeating pattern. Specifically, MD yams 41,47 weave over CD yarns<br>
21,22,23, under CD yarns 24,25,26, over CD yarns 27,28,29, and under CD<br>
yarns 30,31,32 in each repeat of the weave pattern. On the other hand, MD<br>
yarns 44,50 weave over CD yam 21, under CD yams 22,23,24, over CD yarns<br>
25,26,27, under CD yarns 28,29,30, and over CD yarns 31,32. As such, MD<br>
yams 44,50 weave with the CD yams in a manner that is offset in the machine<br>
direction from the manner in which MD yams 41,47 so interweave by two CD<br>
yarns.<br>
With particular reference to Figures 1 and 3, it will be noted that MD<br>
yarn 41, and MD yarn 47 which weaves in the same manner, does not have a<br>
long float on the surface 12 of fabric 10. Instead, MD yarns 41,47 weave over<br>
only CD yarns 22,28 of the second layer 16, and tend to pull CD yarns 22, 28<br>
inwardly with respect to the surface 12, so that the knuckles formed by MD<br>
yarns 41,47 when weaving with CD yarns 22,28 are inward of the floats formed<br>
by MD yams 42,43; 45,46; 48,49; and 50,51. As a consequence, MD yams<br>
41,47 are protected from heat and abrasion on the surface 12 of the fabric 10.<br>
Similarly, MD yarn 44, and MD yarn 50 which weaves in the same<br>
manner, also does not have along float on the surface 12 of fabric 10. Instead,<br>
MD yarns 44,50 weave over only CD yarns 26,32 of the second layer 16, and<br>
tend to pull CD yarns 26,32 inwardly with respect to the surface 12, so that the<br>
knuckles formed by MD yarns 44,50 when weaving with CD yarns 26,32 are<br>
also inward of the floats formed by MD yarns 42,43; 45,46; 48,49; and 50,51.<br>
As a consequence, MD yarns 44,50 are also protected from heat and abrasion on<br>
the surface 12 of the fabric 10.<br>
Because the knuckles formed when MD yarns 41,47 weave over CD<br>
yarns 22,28, and when MD yarns 44,50 weave over CD yarns 26,32 are inward<br>
of the long floats formed by MD yarns 42,43; 45,46; 48,49; 50,51, MD yarns<br>
41,44,47,50 define continuous air channels 60 between these twinned pairs.<br>
Continuous air channels 60 provide a solution to the problem of "drop-off1 in<br>
dryer sections such as single-run dryer sections. Continuous air channels 60,<br>
which are oriented in the machine direction, perform the same function as is<br>
carried out by grooved dryer rolls and cylinders. That is, they provide volume<br>
for air carried into and trapped in a compression wedge, thereby reducing the<br>
tendency for air to be forced through the fabric 10 entirely, where it may cause<br>
"drop off'. The void volume provided by continuous air channels 60 is different<br>
from that in other dryer fabric structures, both woven and spiral-link, because<br>
the void volume is continuous. Most dryer fabrics have some void volume, but<br>
generally the void volume is provided in discrete discontinuous pores or<br>
openings in the fabric. In the present invention, the void volume is continuous<br>
in a predetermined direction, such as in the machine direction.<br>
Figure 2 is a plan view of surface 18 of the fabric 10, and is the reverse<br>
of Figure 1. Figures 2 and 3A taken together show that MD yarns 41-52 bind<br>
with a single CD yarn 21,23,25,27,29,31 of the first layer 14 each time they<br>
weave to the first layer 14. Specifically, MD yarns 41,47 bind with CD yarns<br>
25,31 as they weave to the first layer 14 twice in each repeat of the weave<br>
pattern. Similarly, MD yarns 44,50 bind with CD yarns 23,29 as they weave to<br>
the first layer 14jwice in each repeat of the weave pattern. On the other hand,<br>
the twinned pairs of MD yarns 42,43; 48,49 bind with CD yam 21 as they<br>
weave to the first layer 14 once in each repeat of the weave pattern, while the<br>
twinned pairs of MD yarns 45,46; 51,52 bind with CD yarn 27 as they weave to<br>
the first layer 14 once in each repeat of the weave pattern. As a consequence,<br>
CD yarns 21,23,25,27,29,31 make up most of the area of the surface 18 of the<br>
fabric, which surface 18 may appropriately be described as a shute-runner<br>
surface. In reality, CD yarns 22,24,26,28,30,32 of the second layer 16 may<br>
barely be visible on the surface 18 of the actual fabric 10 as the spacing between<br>
the yarns is quite small. In any event, the CD yarn-dominated nature of the<br>
surface 18 of the fabric 10 protects MD yarns 41-52 from heat and abrasion.<br>
As an alternative to the arrangement previously described, the CD and<br>
MD yarns could be arranged so as to form a so-called monoplane surface<br>
wherein the CD and MD yarns both form the paper-contacting surface. Such<br>
monoplane surface arrangement would not affect the air channels.<br>
The fabric 10 preferably comprises only monofilament yarns.<br>
Specifically, the CD yarns may be anticontaminant polyester monofilament.<br>
Such anticontaminant may be more deformable than standard polyester and, as a<br>
result, may more easily enable the fabric to be woven so as to have a relatively<br>
low permeability (such as 100 CFM) as compared to the more non-deformable<br>
yarns. The CD yarns may have a circular cross-sectional shape with one or<br>
more different diameters. For example, CD yarns 24,30 may have a diameter of<br>
0.90 mm while CD yarns 21-23, 25-29,31,32 may have a diameter of 0.50 mm<br>
8<br>
or 0.60 mm. That is, CD yarns 24,30 may be of larger diameter than the other<br>
CD yarns 21-23, 25-29, 31,32 as suggested in Figures 1,2, 3A, and 4. As<br>
twinned pairs of MD yarns 42,43; 45,46; 48,49; and 51,52 weave over CD yarns<br>
24,30 when weaving up from or down to CD yams 21,27 in the first layer 14,<br>
the larger diameter of CD yarns 24,30 provides additional depth to the<br>
continuous air channels 60. Alternatively, and as shown in Figure 333, all of the<br>
CD yarns (i.e. CD yarns 21-32) may each have the same diameter such as 0.80<br>
mm. The MD yarns 41-52 may be flat monofilament yarns of substantially<br>
rectangular cross-sectional shape. For example, the MD yams 41-52 may have<br>
substantially rectangular cross sections which measure 0.44 mm by 0.88 mm,<br>
the longer dimension lying parallel to the plane of the surface 12 as shown in<br>
Figure 4.<br>
The fabric 10 may be woven in a 6-harness repeat arrangement.<br>
Alternately, the fabric 10 may be woven in other harness repeat arrangements.<br>
For example, it may be woven in a 4-harness repeat arrangement.<br>
Further, in addition to a circular cross-sectional shape, one or more of<br>
the CD yarns may have other cross-sectional shapes such as a rectangular crosssectional<br>
shape or a non-round cross-sectional shape. As previously indicated,<br>
MD yarns 41-52 may be flat monofilament yarns of substantially rectangular<br>
cross-sectional shape. Alternatively, any or all of such MD yams may have<br>
other cross-sectional shapes such as a circular cross-sectional shape or a nonround<br>
cross-sectional shape.<br>
In the above 4-harness repeat example, single MD yarns having a<br>
relatively large width may be used in place of the twinned pairs of MD yarns.<br>
As a further alternate, a fabric 100 may be fabricated without any<br>
twinned pairs of MD yarns. An example of such arrangement is illustrated in<br>
Figure 6 which is a plan view of a surface 112 of the papermaker's fabric 100<br>
according to another embodiment of the present invention. The paper side of<br>
the papermaker's fabric 100 may be smoother than that of fabric 10. In Figure<br>
6, the machine direction (MD) and cross-machine direction (CD) may be as<br>
indicated. The spacing between the yarns of the papermaker's fabric 100 in this<br>
and other figures is exaggerated for the sake of clarity. Figure 6 shows three<br>
repeats of the weave pattern side by side one another.<br>
MD yarns 141-158 are arranged in groups of six in which no two MD<br>
yarns are arranged as a twinned pair as in the embodiment of Figure 1.<br>
frregardless, one or more of MD yarns 141,144,147,150,153, and 156 may<br>
define continuous air channels 160 on the surface 112 of the fabric 100 in a<br>
manner to be described below.<br>
MD yams 142,143,145,146,148,149,151,152,154,155,157 and 158 form<br>
long floats on the surface 112 of the fabric 100. More specifically, MD yarn<br>
142 weaves over CD yarns 121-125, under CD yarns 126-128, and over CD<br>
yarns 129-132 in each repeat of the weave pattern, whereby MD yarn 142 floats<br>
over four CD yarns 122,124,130,132 of the second layer 116 on the surface 112<br>
of the fabric 100. MD yarns 146,148,152,154,158 weave in the same manner as<br>
MD yarn 142. MD yarn 143 weaves under CD yarn 121-122, over CD yarns<br>
123-131, and under CD yarn 132 in each repeat of the weave pattern, whereby<br>
MD yam 143 floats over four consecutive CD yarns 124,126,128,130 of the<br>
second layer 116 on the surface 112 of the fabric 100. MD yarns<br>
145,149,151,155,157 weave in the same manner as MD yarn 143. The floats<br>
formed by MD yarns 142,146,148,152,154,158 are offset in the machine<br>
direction from those formed by MD yarns 143,145,149,151,155,157 by six CD<br>
yarns.<br>
MD yarns 141,147,153 weave over CD yarn 121, under CD yarns 122-<br>
124, over CD yams 125-127, under CD yarns 128-130, and over CD yams 131-<br>
132 in each repeat of the weave pattern. On the other hand, MD yarns<br>
144,150,156 weave over CD yarnsl21-123, under CD yarns 124-126, over CD<br>
yarns 127-129, and under CD yarns 130-132. As such, MD yarns 141,147, 153<br>
weave with the CD yarns in a manner that is offset in the machine direction<br>
from the manner in which MD yarns 144,150,156 so interweave by two CD<br>
yarns.<br>
With reference to Figures 6 and 7, MD yarns 141,147, 153 do not have a<br>
long float on the surface 112 of fabric 100. Instead, MD yarns 141,147,153<br>
10<br>
weave over only CD yarns 126,132 of the second layer 116, and tend to pull CD<br>
yarns 126,132 inwardly with respect to the surface 112, so that the knuckles<br>
formed by MD yams 141,147,153 when weaving with CD yams 126,132 are<br>
inward of the floats formed by MD yarns 142,143,145,<br>
146,148,149,151,152,154,155,157,158. As a consequence, MD yarns<br>
141,147,153 are protected from heat and abrasion on the surface 112 of the<br>
fabric 100.<br>
Similarly, MD yarns 144,150,156 also do not have a long float on the<br>
surface 112 of fabric 100. Instead, MD yams 144,150,156 weave over only CD<br>
yarns 122,128 of the second layer 116, and tend to pull CD yarns 122,128<br>
inwardly with respect to the surface 112, so that the knuckles formed by MD<br>
yarns 144,150,156 when weaving with CD yarns 122,128 are also inward of the<br>
floats formed by MD yarns 142,143,145,146,148,149,151,152,154,155,<br>
157,158. As a consequence, MD yams 144,150,156 are also protected from<br>
heat and abrasion on the surface 112 of the fabric 100.<br>
The knuckles formed when MD yarns 141,147,153 weave over CD<br>
yarns 126,132 and when MD yarns 144,150,156 weave over CD yarns 122,128<br>
are inward of the long floats formed by MD yarns 142,143,145,<br>
146,148,149,151,152,154,155,157,158. As a result, MD yarns<br>
141,144,147,150,153,156 may define continuous air channels 160 there<br>
between. Such continuous air channels 160 are oriented in the machine<br>
direction and may perform in a manner similar to air channels 60.<br>
MD yarns 141-158 bind with the CD yarns of the first layer 114 each<br>
time they weave to the first layer. Specifically, MD yarns 141,147,153 bind<br>
twice with CD yarns in the first layer 114 in each repeat of the weave pattern,<br>
that is, these MD yarns bind with CD yarns 123,129 in each repeat of the weave<br>
pattern. Similarly, MD yams 144,150,156 bind twice with CD yarns in the first<br>
layer 114 in each repeat of the weave pattern, that is, these MD yarns bind with<br>
CD yams 125,131 in each repeat of the weave pattern. On the other hand, MD<br>
yarns 142,146, 148,152,154,158 bind once with CD yams in the first layer 114<br>
in each repeat of the weave pattern, that is, these MD yams bind with CD yarn<br>
11<br>
127 in each repeat of the weave pattern, and MD yams<br>
143,145,149,151,155,157 bind once with CD yarns in the first layer 114 in each<br>
repeat of the weave pattern, that is, these MD yarns bind with CD yarn 121 in<br>
each repeat of the weave pattern. As a consequence, CD yarns<br>
121,123,125,127,129,131 make up most of the area of the surface 118of the<br>
fabric 100. CD yarns 122,124,126,128,130,132 of the second layer 116 may<br>
barely be visible on the surface 118 of the actual fabric 100 as the spacing<br>
between the yarns is quite small. In any event, the CD yarns of the surface 118<br>
of the fabric 100 may protect the MD yarns from heat and abrasion.<br>
Yams used in the fabric 100 may be monofilament-type yarns, such as<br>
anticontaminant polyester monofilament yarns. As previously described, such<br>
anticontaminant may be more deformable than standard polyester and the<br>
woven fabrics may have a relatively low permeability (such as 100 CFM).<br>
Additionally, some or all of the CD yarns 121-132 may have a rectangular<br>
cross-sectional shape or a non-round cross-sectional shape or a circular crosssectional<br>
shape with one or more different diameters, such as in a manner<br>
similar to that previously described with regard to fabric 10. Furthermore, some<br>
or all of the MD yarns 141-158 may have cross-sectional shapes such as a<br>
circular cross-sectional shape or a non-round cross-sectional shape or may be<br>
flat monofilament yarns having substantially rectangular cross-sectional shape,<br>
such as in a manner similar to that previously described with regard to fabric 10.<br>
Therefore, CD yams 21-32 and 121-132 may be monofilament yams of<br>
any of the synthetic polymeric resins used in the production of such yarns for<br>
paper machine clothing. Polyester and polyamide are but two examples of such<br>
materials. Other examples of such materials are polyphenylene sulfide (PPS),<br>
which is commercially available under the name RYTON®, and a modified<br>
heat-, hydrolysis- and contaminant- resistant polyester of the variety disclosed<br>
in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,169,499, and used in dryer fabrics sold<br>
by Albany International Corp. under the trademark THERMONETICS®. Such<br>
fibers have a hindered carboxyl group and are a copolymer of terephthalic acid,<br>
1, 4-dimethylolcyclohexane and isophthalic acid. The teachings of U.S. Patent<br>
12<br>
No. 5,169,499 are incorporated herein by reference. Further, such materials as<br>
poly (cyclohexanedimethylene terephthalateisophthalate) (PCTA),<br>
polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and others could also be used. Furthermore, one<br>
or more of the CD yams may have a circular, rectangular or other crosssectional<br>
shapes.<br>
As previously indicated, MD yarns 41-52 and 141-158 may be flat<br>
monofilament yarns of substantially rectangular cross-sectional shape.<br>
Alternatively, any or all of such MD yarns may have other cross-sectional<br>
shapes. Additionally, MD yarns 41-52 and 141-158 may be any of the synthetic<br>
polymeric resins used in the production of yarns for paper machine clothing.<br>
Polyester and polyamide are but two examples, along with the other materials<br>
disclosed above.<br>
The fabric 10 and/or 100 may be used with a single run or single tier<br>
dryer section. Alternatively, the fabric 10 and/or 100 may be used with other<br>
types of dryer sections, such as that shown in Figure 5. As is to be appreciated,<br>
in such situation, fabrics 99 would be replaced with fabrics 10 or 100.<br>
Further, as previously described, the fabric 10 and the fabric 100 each<br>
have a number of air channels. The number of air channels in the fabric 10 per<br>
unit length may be the same as or different from that in the fabric 100.<br>
Furthermore, the surface having the air channels may be smoother than<br>
the non-air channel surface; whereas, the non-ak channel surface may provide a<br>
better grip than the air-channel surface. As a result, it may be desirable to have<br>
the air-channel surface face the paper in some circumstances and to have the<br>
non-air channel surface face the paper in other circumstances. Therefore,<br>
during operation, the fabric 10 and/or fabric 100 may be arranged such that<br>
either side thereof may face the paper sheet. That is, surface 12 or surface 18 of<br>
the fabric 10 may face the paper sheet, and surface 112 or surface 118 of the<br>
fabric 100 may face the paper sheet.<br>
Additionally, the MD yarns and the CD yarns may be interwoven such<br>
that the MD and CD yarn knuckles lie in substantially the same plane. Such<br>
arrangement may provide a relatively smooth surface. Alternatively, the MD<br>
13<br>
yarns and the CD yarns may be interwoven such that the CD yarn knuckles lie<br>
in a plane higher (or closer to the surface) than that of the MD knuckles. This<br>
arrangement protects the MD yarns.<br>
Although in the above embodiments the fabrics were described as<br>
having two CD layers, certain number of repeat patterns, certain length of the<br>
MD floats, certain offset values, and so forth, the present invention is not so<br>
limited. That is, the present fabrics may have more than two CD layers, may<br>
have different number of repeat patterns, may have different length MD floats,<br>
and different offset values.<br>
Further, although in the above embodiments the fabrics were described<br>
as having air channels on one surface thereof, the present invention is not so<br>
limited. That is, the present fabrics may have air channels on either surface or<br>
on two surfaces. For example, the present fabric may have three CD yarn layers<br>
with MD yarns interwoven therewith so as to have air channels on both a papercontacting<br>
surface and a non-paper-contacting surface. In such situation, the<br>
arrangement of air channels on the paper-contacting surface may be the same or<br>
different than that on the non-paper-contacting surface.<br>
Modifications to the above would be obvious to those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art, but would not bring the invention so modified beyond the scope of the<br>
present invention. For example, while fabric 10 and 100 may be flat-woven and<br>
joined into endless form for use on the dryer section of a paper machine, it is<br>
also possible to produce the fabric 10 and/or 100 by endless weaving, in which<br>
:ase the MD yarns 41-52 and/or 141-158 would be weft yams during the<br>
weaving process and the CD yarns 21-32 and/or 121-132 would be warp yarns.<br>
The claims to follow should be construed to cover such a situation.<br><br>
