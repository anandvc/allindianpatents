				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a detergent composition containing a mid-chain branched surfactant and an electrolyte. More particularly, the detergent compqsition includes a mixture of linear alkybenzene sulfonate ("LAS") surfactant and mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactant and an electrolyte capable of increasing the ionic strength of the compositions resulting in improved performance, especially under low water temperature wash conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventional detersive surfactants comprise molecules having a water-solubilizing substituent (hydrophilic group) and an oleophilic substituent (hydrophobtc group). Such surfactants typically comprise hydrophilic groups such as carboxylate, sulfate, sulfonate, amine oxide, polyoxyethylene, and the like, attached to an alkyl, alkenyl or alkaryl hydrophobe usually containing from about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms. Accordingly, the manufacturer of such surfactants must have access to a source of hydrophobe groups to which the desired hydrophile can be attached by chemical means. The earliest source of hydrophobe groups comprised the natural fats and oils, which were converted into soaps (i.e., carboxylate hydrophile) by saponification with base. Coconut oil and palm oil are still used to manufacture soap, as well as to manufacture the alkyl sulfate ("AS") class of surfactants. Other hydrophobes are available from petrochemicals, including alkylated benzene which is used to manufacture alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactants ("LAS").<br>
Generally, alkyl sulfates are well known to those skilled in the art of detersive surfactants. Alkyl sulfates were developed as a functional improvement over traditional soap surfactants and have been found to possess improved solubility and surfactant characteristics. Linear alkyl sulfates are the most commonly used of the alkyl sulfate surfactants and are the easiest to obtain. For example, long-chain linear alkyl sulfates, such as tallow alkyl sulfate, have been used in laundry detergents. However, these have significant cleaning performance limitations, especially with the trend to lower wash<br>
temperatures. Accordingly, there is a need for a detergent composition which includes a surfactant capable of delivering improved cleaning at low wash water temperatures (e.g.,<br>
20°C-5°C), Moreover, even detergent compositions containing surfactants having the desired performance have room for improved performance. In particular, certain detergent compositions containing selected surfactants such as mid-chain branched surfactants typically include other ingredients such as adjunct surfactants (e.g., LAS) builders, enzymes and the like which can have deleterious effects on the overall cost of the composition. To that end, a need continues to exist for a detergent composition having a mid-chain surfactant, which is less expensive and yet, exhibits improved performance.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
U.S. 3,480,556 to deWitt, et al., November 25, 1969, EP 439,316, published by Lever July 31, 1991, and EP 684,300, published by Lever November 29, 1995, describe beta-branched alkyl sulfates. EP 439,316 describes certain laundry detergents containing a specific commercial C14/C15 branched primary alkyl sulfate, namely LIAL 145 sulfate. This is believed to have 61% branching in the 2-position; 30% of this involves branching with a hydrocarbon chain having four or more carbon atoms, U.S. 3,480,556 describes mixtures of from 10 to 90 parts of a straight chain primary alkyl sulfate and from 90 to 10 parts of a beta branched (2-position branched) primary alcohol sulfate of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the total number of carbon atoms ranges from 12 to 20 and Rl is a straight chain alkyl radical containing 9 to 17 carbon atoms and Rl is a straight chain alkyl radical containing 1 to 9 carbon atoms (67% 2-methyl and 33% 2-ethyl branching is exemplified).<br>
As noted hereinbefore, R,G. Laughlin in "The Aqueous Phase Behavior of Surfactants", Academic Press, N.Y. (1994) p. 347 describes the observation that as branching moves away from the 2-alkyl position towards the center of the alkyl hydrophobe there is a lowering of Krafft temperatures.

EP 342,917 A, Unilever, published Nov. 23,1989 describes laundry detergents containing a surfactant system in which the major anionic surfactant is an alkyl sulfate having an assertedly "wide range" of alkyl chain lengths (the experimental appears to involve mixing coconut and tallow chain length surfactants).<br>

Methyl- substituted sulfates include the known "isostearyl" sulfates; these are typically mixtures of isomeric sulfates having a total of 18 carbon atoms. For example, EP 401,462 A, assigned to Henkel, published December 12, 1990, describes certain isostearyl alcohols and ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and their sulfation to produce the corresponding alkyl sulfates such as sodium isostearyl sulfate.

It is also an object of the invention to provide a detergent composition which cleans across a wider range of soils and stains and which is more stable with other detergent ingredients such as enzymes,<br>
Ail percentages, ratios and proportions herein are by weight, unless otherwise specified. All temperatures are in degrees Celsius (°C) unless otherwise specified. All documents cited are in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to a detergent composition, preferably granular, which contains a mixture of LAS surfactant and a mid-chain branched surfactant as detailed hereinafter. Another essential component of the detergent composition is an electrolyte. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that by selecting an appropriate electrolyte at a selected level in the composition, the ionic strength of the detergent composition, and ultimately, the wash water into which it is dissolved. This increased ionic • strength facilitates improved surfactant packing unexpectedly resulting in improved cleaning performance. The improved cleaning resulting from the electrolyte is especially seen with formulations containing linear alkylbenzene sulfonate ("LAS") surfactant which is a common workhorse surfactant used in many modern detergent compositions.<br>
To this end, the detergent composition of the invention contains from about 1% to about 60%, more preferably from about 1% to about 25%, even more preferably from about 1% to about 10%, and most preferably from about 3% to about 10%, by weight of the electrolyte. The electrolyte preferably meets the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein M is a cation, X is an anion, and a and b are coefficients or integers which balance the charge. The cation, M, is preferably lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, ammonium, alkyl ammonium or calcium, The anion, X, is preferably chloride, bromide, sulfate, carbonate. Most preferred are those cations which do not form precipitating complexes with anionic surfactants or retard particulate stain removal. In that regard, alkali metals such as sodium and potassium are most preferred. The choice for the anion is not of critical importance to the invention. Although sodium chloride and magnesium sulfate are most preferred, many other electrolytes meeting the aformentioned formula can<br>
be used without departing from the scope of the invention. By way of example, the electrolyte can be selected from the group consisting of magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, potassium chloride, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate, magnesium chloride and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, the weight ratio of LAS surfactant to mid-chain branched surfactant is from about 1:5 to about 20:1, more preferably from about 1:1 to about 5:1. Optionally, the detergent composition of the invention can include adjunct detergent ingredients selected from the group consisting of builders, enzymes, fillers, brighteners, bleaching agents and mixtures thereof. Also, it is preferred that the pH of the detergent composition be kept in a range of from about 8 to about 10, preferably from about 8.5 to about 9.5, and most preferably from about 9,0 to about 9.5.<br>
As mentioned previously and detailed hereinafter, it has been unexpectedly determined that certain relatively long-chain alkyl sulfate compositions containing mid-chain branching are preferred for use in laundry products, especially under cool or cold water washing conditions (e.g., 20°C-5°C). Optionally, the combination of two or more of these mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants can be included in the compositions herein to provide a surfactant mixture that is higher in surfactancy and has better low temperature water solubility than any single branched alkyl sulfate. The mixtures as produced comprise the mid-chain branching desirable for use in the surfactant mixtures of the present invention or the surfactant mixtures disclosed herein can be formulated by mixing the desired amounts of individual mid-chain branched surfactants. Such superior mixtures are not limited to combinations with other mid-chain branched surfactants but (preferably) they can be suitably combined with one or more other traditional detergent surfactants (e.g., other primary alkyl sulfates; linear alkyl benzene sulfonates; alkyl ethoxylated sulfates; nonionic surfactants; etc.) to provide improved surfactant systems.<br>
The surfactant paste includes surfactant mixtures comprising mid-chain branched surfactant compounds as described herein before. In such compositions, certain points of branching (e.g., the location along the chain of the R, R1, and/or R2 moieties in the above formula) are preferred over other points of branching along the backbone of the surfactant. The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range (i.e., where points of branching occur), preferred mid-chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for mono-methyl branched alkyl Ab moieties useful according to the present invention,<br>

The preferred branched surfactant compositions useful in cleaning compositions according to the present invention are described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
(1) Mid-chain Branched Primary Alkvl Sulfate Surfactants<br>
The present invention branched surfactant compositions may comprise two or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The surfactant mixtures of the present invention comprise molecules having a linear primary alkyl sulfate chain backbone (i.e., the longest linear carbon chain which includes the sulfated carbon atom). These alkyl chain backbones comprise from 12 to 19 carbon atoms; and further the molecules comprise a branched primary alkyl moiety having at least a total of 14, but not more than,20, carbon atoms. In addition, the surfactant mixture has an average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary aikyl moieties within the range of from greater than 14,5 to about 17.5. Thus, the present invention mixtures comprise at least one branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactant compound having a longest linear carbon chain of not less than 12 carbon atoms or more than 19 carbon atoms, and the total number of carbon atoms including branching must be at least 14, and further the average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl chains is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 17.5.<br>
For example, a C16 total carbon primary alkyl suifate surfactant having 13 carbon atoms in the backbone must have 1, 2, or 3 branching units (i.e., R, R1 and/or R2) whereby total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is at least 16. In this example, the C16 total carbon requirement may be satisfied equally by having, for example, one propyl branching unit or three methyl branching units.<br>
R, Rl, and R2 are each independently selected from hydrogen and C1-C3 alkyl (preferably hydrogen or C1-C2 alkyl, more preferably hydrogen or methyl, and most preferably methyl), provided R, R1, and R2 are not all hydrogen. Further, when z is 1, at least R or R1 is not hydrogen.<br>
Although for the purposes of the present invention surfactant compositions the above formula does not include molecules wherein the units R, R1, and R2 are all hydrogen (i.e., linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfates), it is to be recognized that the present invention compositions may still further comprise some amount of linear, non-branched primary alkyl suifate, Further, this linear non-branched primary alkyl suifate surfactant may be present as the result of the process used to manufacture the surfactant mixture having the requisite one or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfates according to the present invention, or for purposes of formulating detergent compositions some amount of linear non-branched primary alkyl suifate may be admixed "into the final product -formulation.<br>
Further it is to be similarly recognized that non-sulfated mid-chain branched alcohol may comprise some amount of the present invention compositions. Such materials may be present as the result of incomplete sulfation of the alcohol used to prepare the alkyl suifate surfactant, or these alcohols may be separately added to the present invention detergent compositions along with a mid-chain branched alkyl suifate surfactant according to the present invention.<br>
M is hydrogen or a salt forming cation depending upon the method of synthesis. Examples of salt forming cations are lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, quaternary alkyl amines having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R3, R4, R5 and R6 are independently hydrogen, C1-C22 alkylene, C4-C22 branched alkylene, C1-C6 alkanol, C1-C22 alkenytene, C4-C22 branched alkenyJene, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Preferred cations are ammonium (R3, R4, R.5 and R6 equal hydrogen), sodium, potassium, mono-, di-, and trialkanol ammonium, and mixtures thereof. The monoalkanol ammonium compounds of the present invention have R3 equal to C1-C6 alkanol, R4, R5 and R6 equal to hydrogen; dialkanol ammonium compounds of the present invention have R3 and R4 equal to C1-C6 alkanol, R5 and R6 equal to hydrogen; trialkano! ammonium compounds of the present invention have R3, R4 and R5 equal to C1-C6 alkanol, R6 equal to hydrogen. Preferred alkanol ammonium salts of the present invention are the mono-, di- and tri- quaternary ammonium compounds having the formulas:<br>
H3N+CH2CH2OH,    H2N+(CH2CH2OH)2,    HN+(CH2CH2OH)3 . Preferred M is sodium, potassium and the C2 alkanol ammonium salts listed above; most preferred is sodium.<br>
Further regarding the above formula, w is an integer from 0 to 13; x is an integer from 0 to 13; y is an integer from 0 to 13; z is an integer of at least 1; and w + x + y + z is an integer from 8 to 14.<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the total number of carbon atoms, including branching, is from 15 to 18, and wherein further for this surfactant mixture the average total number of carbon atoms in the branched primary alkyl moieties having the above formula is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 17.5; R1 and R2 are each independently hydrogen or C1-C3 alkyl; M is a water soluble cation; x is from 0 to 11; y is from 0 to 11 ; z is at least 2; and x + y + z is from 9 to 13; provided R1 and R2 are not both hydrogen, More preferred are compositions having at least 5% of the mixture comprising one or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfates wherein x + y is equal to 9 and z is at least 2.<br>
Preferably, the mixtures of surfactant comprise at least 5% of a mid chain branched primary alkyl sulfate having R1 and R2 independently hydrogen, methyl, provided R1 and R2 are not both hydrogen; x + y is equal to 8, 9, or 10 and z is at least 2.

The detergent composition of the invention can include one or more adjunct detergent ingredients 35 discussed herein. The following are representative examples of adjunct detergent surfactants useful in the present surfactant paste. Water-soluble salts of the higher fatty acids, i.e., "soaps", are useful anionic surfactants in the compositions herein. This includes alkali metal soaps such as the sodium, potassium, ammonium, and alkylolammonium salts of higher fatty acids containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, and preferably from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms. Soaps can be made by direct saponification of fats and oils or by the neutralization of free fatty acids. Particularly useful are the sodium and potassium salts of the mixtures of fatty acids derived from coconut oil and tallow, i.e., sodium or potassium tallow and coconut soap.<br>
Additional anionic surfactants which suitable for use herein include the water-soluble salts, preferably the alkali metal, ammonium and alkylolammonium salts, of organic sulfuric reaction products having in their molecular structure a straight-chain alkyl group containing from about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms and a sulfonic acid or sulfuric acid ester group. (Included in the term "alkyl" is the alkyl portion of acy! groups.) Examples of this group of synthetic surfactants are the sodium and potassium alkyl sulfates, especially those obtained by sulfating the higher alcohols (C8-18 carbon atoms) such as those produced by reducing the glycerides of tallow or coconut oil; and the sodium and potassium alkylbenzene sulfonates in which the alkyl group contains from about 9 to about 15 carbon atoms, in straight chain, e.g., those of the type described in U.S. Patents 2,220,099 and 2,477,383. Especially valuable are linear straight chain alkylbenzene sulfonates in which the average number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group is from about 11 to 13, abbreviated as C11-13 LAS.<br>
Other anionic surfactants suitable for use herein are the sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulfonates, especially those ethers of higher alcohols derived from tallow and coconut oil;<br>
sodium coconut oil fatty acid monoglyceride sulfonates and sulfates; sodium or potassium of ethylene oxide per molecule and wherein the alkyl groups contain from about 8 to about 12 carbon atoms; and sodium or potassium salts of alkyl ethylene oxide ether sulfates containing about 1 to about 10 units of ethylene oxide per molecule and wherein the alkyl group contains from about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms.<br>
In addition, suitable anionic surfactants include the water-soluble salts of esters of alpha-sulfonated fatty acids containing from about 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the fatty acid group and from about 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the ester group; water-soluble salts of 2-acyloxyaikane-1 -sulfonic acids containing from about 2 to 9 carbon atoms in the acyl group and from about 9 to about 23 carbon atoms in the alkane moiety; alkyl ether sulfates containing from about 10 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and from about 1 to 30 moles of ethylene oxide; water-soluble salts of olefm and paraffin sulfonates containing from about 12 to 20 carbon atoms; and beta-alkyloxy alkane sulfonates containing from about 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and from about 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkane moiety.<br>
Preferred adjunct anionic surfactants are C10-18 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate and C10-18 alkyl sulfate. If desired, low moisture (less than about 25% water) alkyl sulfate paste can be the sole ingredient in the surfactant paste, Most preferred are C10-18 alkyl sulfates, linear or branched, and any of primary, secondary or tertiary. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is wherein the surfactant paste comprises from about 20% to about 40% of a mixture of sodium C10-13 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate and sodium C12-16 alkyl sulfate in a weight ratio of about 2:1 to 1:2. Another preferred embodiment of the detergent composition includes a mixture of C10-18 alkyl sulfate and C10-18 alkyl ethoxy sulfate in a weight ratio of about 80:20.<br>
Water-soluble nonionic surfactants are also useful in the instant invention. Such nonionic'materials include compounds produced by the condensation of alkylene oxide groups (hydrophilic in nature) with an organic hydrophobic compound, which may be aliphatic or alkyl aromatic in nature. The length of the polyoxyalkylene group which is condensed with any particular hydrophobic group can be readily adjusted to yield a water-soluble compound having the desired degree of balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements.<br>
Suitable nonionic surfactants include the polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols, e,g,, the condensation products of alkyl phenols having an alkyl group containing from about 6 to 15 carbon atoms, in either a straight chain or branched chain configuration, with from about 3 to 12 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alkyl phenol. Included are the water-soluble and water-dispersible condensation products of aliphatic alcohols containing from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, in either straight chain or branched configuration, with from 3 to 12 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol.<br>
An additional group of nonionics suitable for use herein are semi-polar nonionic surfactants which include water-soluble amine oxides containing one alkyl moiety of from abut 10 to 18 carbon atoms and two moieties selected from the group of alkyl and hydroxyalkyl moieties of from about 1 to about 3 carbon atoms; water-soluble phosphine<br>
oxides containing one alkyl moiety of about 10 to 18 carbon atoms and two moieties selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups and hydroxyalkyl groups containing from about 1 to 3 carbon atoms; and water-soluble sulfoxides containing one alkyl moiety of from about 10 to 18 carbon atoms and a moiety selected from the group consisting of alkyl and hydroxyalkyl moieties of from about 1 to 3 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferred nonionic surfactants are of the formula R1(OC2H4)n OH, wherein R1  is a<br>
C10-C16 alkyl group oraC8-C12 alkyl phenyl group, and n is from 3 to about 80. Particularly preferred are condensation products of C12-C15 alcohols with from about 5 to<br>
about 20 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, e.g., C12-C13 alcohol condensed with about 6.5 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol.<br>
Additional suitable nonionic surfactants include polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, Examples are N-methyl N-1-deoxyglucityl cocoamide and N-methyl N- 1 -deoxyglucityl oleamide. Processes for making polyhydroxy fatty acid amides are known and can be found in Wilson, U.S. Patent No, 2,965,576 and Schwartz, U.S, Patent No. 2,703,798, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Ampholytic surfactants include derivatives of aliphatic or aliphatic derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines in which the aliphatic moiety can be straight chain or branched and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and at least one aliphatic substituent contains an anionic water-solubilizing group.<br>
Zwitterionic surfactants include derivatives of aliphatic, quaternary, ammonium, phosphonium, and sulfonium compounds in which one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
Cationic surfactants can also be included in the present invention. Cationic surfactants comprise a wide variety of compounds characterized by one or more organic hydrophobic groups in the cation and generally by a quaternary nitrogen associated with an acid radical. Pentavalent nitrogen ring compounds are also considered quaternary nitrogen compounds. Suitable anions are halides, methyl sulfate and hydroxide. Tertiary amines can have characteristics similar to cationic surfactants at washing solution pH values less than about 8.5. A more complete disclosure of these and other cationic surfactants useful herein can be found in U.S. Patent 4,228,044, Cambre, issued October 14,1980, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Cationic surfactants are often used in detergent compositions to provide fabric softening and/or antistatic benefits. Antistatic agents which provide some softening benefit and which are preferred herein are the quaternary ammonium salts described in U.S. Patent 3,936,537, Baskerville, Jr. et al., issued February 3, 1976, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The compositions of the invention can contain all manner of organic, water-soluble detergent compounds, inasmuch as the builder material are compatible with all such materials. In addition to a detersive surfactant, at least one suitable adjunct detergent ingredient is preferably included in the detergent composition. The adjunct detergent ingredient is preferably selected from the group consisting of builders, enzymes, bleaching agents, bleach activators, suds suppressors, soil release agents, brighteners, perfumes, hydrotropes, dyes, pigments, polymeric dispersing agents, pH controlling agents, chelants, processing aids, crystallization aids, and mixtures thereof. The following list of detergent ingredients and mixtures thereof which can be used in the compositions herein is representative of the detergent ingredients, but is not intended to be limiting.<br>
One or more builders can be used in conjunction with the builder material described herein to further improve the performance of the compositions described herein. For example, the builder can be selected from the group consisting of aluminosilicates, crystalline layered silicates, MAP zeolites, citrates, amorphous silicates, polycarboxylates, sodium carbonates and mixtures thereof. The sodium carbonate ingredient can serve as the inorganic alkaline material when a liquid acid precursor of the mid-chain branched surfactant is used. Other suitable auxiliary builders are described hereinafter.<br>
Preferred builders include aluminosilicate ion exchange materials and sodium carbonate. The aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein as a detergent builder preferably have both a high calcium ion exchange capacity and a high exchange rate. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that such high calcium ion exchange rate and capacity are a function of several interrelated factors which derive from the method by which the aluminosilicate ion exchange material is produced. In that regard, the aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein are preferably produced in accordance with Corkill et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,605,509 (Procter &amp; Gamble), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Preferably, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material is in "sodium" form since the potassium and hydrogen forms of the instant aluminosilicate do not exhibit the as high of an exchange rate and capacity as provided by the sodium form. Additionally, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material preferably is in over dried form so as to facilitate production of crisp detergent agglomerates as described herein. The aluminosilicate ion<br>
exchange materials used herein preferably have particle size diameters which optimize<br>
their effectiveness as detergent builders. The term "particle size diameter" as used herein represents the average particle size diameter of a given aluminosilicate ion exchange material as determined by conventional analytical techniques, such as microscopic determination and scanning electron microscope (SEM), The preferred particle size diameter of the aluminosilicate is from about 0.1 micron to about 10 microns, more<br>
preferably from about 0.5 microns to about 9 microns, Most preferably, the particle size diameter is from about 1 microns to about 8 microns.<br>
Preferably, the aluminosiiicate ion exchange material has the formula<br>
wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is from about 1 to about 5 and x is from about 10 to about 264. More preferably, the aluminosilicate has the formula<br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, preferably about 27. These preferred aluminosilicates are available commercially, for example under designations Zeolite A, Zeolite B and Zeolite X. Alternatively, naturally-occurring or synthetically derived aluminosilicate ion exchange materials suitable for use herein can be made as described in Krummel et al, U.S. Patent No. 3,985,669, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The aluminosilicates used herein are further characterized by their ion exchange capacity which is at least about 200 mg equivalent of CaCO3 hardness/gram, calculated on an anhydrous basis, and which is preferably in a range from about 300 to 352 mg equivalent of CaCO3 hardness/gram. Additionally, the instant aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are still'further characterized by their calcium ion exchange rate which is at least about 2 grains Ca++/gallon/minute/-gram/gallon, and more preferably in a range from about 2 grains Ca++/gallon/minute/-gram/gallon to about 6 grains Ca++/gallon/minute/-gram/gallon .<br>
