				<td>The present inventions relates to a fused pyrimidinone compound.<br>
 Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel fused heterocycles, their pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use. In addition, the present invention relates to therapeutic methods for the treatment and prevention of cancers.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
One sub-class of anti-cancer drugs now used extensively in the clinic (taxanes, vinca-alkaloids) are directed at microtubules and block the cell division cycle by interfering with normal assembly or dissassernbly of the mitotic spindle (see Chabner, B. A., Ryan, D. P., Paz-Ares, 1., Garcia-Carbonero, R., and Calabresi, P: Antineoplastic agents. In Hardman, J. G., Limbird, L.E., and Gilman, A. G., eds. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10th edition, 2001, The MacGraw-Hill Companies,Inc). TaxolÂ® (paclitaxel), one of the most effective drugs of this class, is a microtubule stabilizer. It interferes with the normal growth and shrinkage of microtubules thus blocking cells in the metaphase of mitosis. Mitotic block is often followed by slippage into the next cell cycle without having property divided, and eventually by apoptosis of these abnormal cells (Blagosklonny, M.V. and Fojo, T.: Molecular effects of paclitaxel: myths and reality (a critical review). Int. J Cancer 1999, 83:151-156.)<br>
Some of the side effects of treatment with paclitaxel are neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy. Paclitaxel is known to cause abnormal bundling of microtubules in interphase cells. In addition, some tumor types are refractory to treatment with paclitaxel, and other tumors become insensitive during treatment. Paclitaxel is also a substrate for the multi-drug resistance pump, P-glycoprotein ((see Chabner et. at, 2001).<br>
Thus, there is a need for effective anti-mitotic agents that are more specific and have fewer side effects than anti-microtubule drugs, and also for agents that are effective against taxane-resistaiit tumors.<br>
Kinesins are a large family of molecular motor proteins, which use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move in a stepwise manner along microtubules. For a review, see Sablin, E.P.:<br>
 Kinesins and microtubules: their structures and motor mechanisms. Cwr Opin Cell Biol 2000, 12:35-41 and Schief, W. R. and Howard, J.: Conformational changes during kinesin motility. Cwr Opin Cell 5/0/2001, 13:19-28.<br>
Some members of this family transport molecular cargo along microtubules to the sites in the cell where they are needed. For example, some kinesins bind to vescicles and transport them for long distances along microtubules in axons. Several family members are mitotic kinesins, as they play roles in the reorganization of microtubules that establishes a bipolar mitotic spindle. The minus ends of the microtubules originate at the centrosornes, or spindle poles, whilst the plus ends bind to the kinetochore at the centromeric region of each chromosome. Thus the mitotic spindle lines up the chromosomes at metaphase of mitosis and coordinates their movement apart and into individual daughter cells at anaphase and telophase (cytokinesis). See Alberts, B., Bray, D., Lewis, .1., Raff, M, Roberts, K., and Watson, J. D., Molecular Biology of the Cell, 3rd edition, Chapter 18, The Mechanics of Cell Division, 1994, Garland Publishing, Inc. New York.<br>
HsEgS (Accession X85137; see Blangy, A., Lane H.A., d'Heron, P., Harper, M., Kress, M. and Nigg, E.A.: Phospborylation by p34cdc2 regulates spindle association of human Eg5, a kmesin-related motor essential for bipolar spindle formation in vivo. Cell 1995, 83(7): 1159-1169) or, KSP, is a mitotic kinesin whose bomologs in many organisms have been shown to be required for centrosome separation in the prophase of mitosis, and for the assembly of a bipolar mitotic spindle. For a review see Kashina, A.S., Rogers, G.C., and Scholey, J.M.: The bimC family of kinesins: essential bipolar mitotic motors driving centrosome separation, Biochem BioplrysActa 1997,1357: 257-271. Eg5 forms a tetrameric motor, and it is thought to cross-link microtubules and participate in their bundling (Walczak, C. E., Vemos, I, Mitchison, T. J., Karsenti, E., and Heald, R.: A model for the proposed roles of different microtubule-based motor proteins in establishing spindle bipolarity. Cwr Biol 1998, 8:903-913). Several reports have radicated that inhibition of Eg5 function leads to metaphase block in which cells display monastral spindles. Recently an Eg5 inhibitor called monastrol was isolated in a cell-based screen for mitotic blockers (Mayer, T.U., Kapoor, T. M., Haggarty, S.J., King, R.W., Schreiber, S.L., and Mitchison, T.J.: Small molecule inhibitor of mitotic spindle bipolarity identified in a phenotype-based screen. Science 1999, 286: 971-974).<br><br>
Monastrol treatment was shown to be specific for Eg5 over kinesin heavy chain, another closely related motor with different functions (Mayer et a!., 1999). Monastrol blocks the release of ADP from the Eg5 motor (Maliga, Z., Kapoor, T. M., and Mitchison, T.J.: Evidence that monastrpl is an allosteric inhibitor of the mitotic kinesin Eg5. Chem &amp; BioJ 2002, 9: 989-996 and DeBonis, S., Simorre, J.-P., Crevel, L, Lebeau, L, Skoufias, D. A., Slangy, A., Ebel, C, Gans, P., Cross, R., Hackney, D. D., Wade, R. H., and Kozielski, F.: Interaction of the mitotic inhibitor monastrol with human kinesin Eg5. Biochemistry 2003,42: 338-349) an important step in the catalytic cycle of kinesin motor proteins (for review, see Sablin, 2000; Schief and Howard, 2001). Treatment with monastrol was also shown to be reversible and to activate the mitotic spindle checkpoint which stops the progress of the cell division cycle until all the DNA is in place for appropriate division to occur (Kapoor, T.M., Mayer, T. U., Coughlin, M. L., and Mitchison., T.J.: Probing spindle assembly mechanisms with monastrol, a small molecule mhibi tor of the mitotic kinesin, Eg5. J Cell Bio! 2000, 150(5): 975-988). Recent reports also indicate that inhibitors of Eg5 lead to apoptosis of treated cells and are effective against several tumor cell lines and tumor models (Mayer et al., 1999).<br>
Although Eg5 is thought to be necessary for mitosis in all cells, one report indicates that it is over-expressed in tumor cells (International Patent Application WO 01/31335), suggesting that they may be particularly sensitive to its inhibition. Eg5 is not present on the microtobules of interphase cells, and is targeted to microtubules by phosphorylation at an early point in mitosis (Blangy et al., 1995). See also; Sawin, K. E. and Mitchison, T.J.: Mutations in the kinesin-like protein Eg5 disrupting localization to the mitotic spindle. Proc Natl AcadSci USA 1995, 92(10): 4289-4293, thus monastrol has no detectable effect on microtubule arrays in interphase cells (Mayer et al., 1999). Another report suggests that Eg5 is involved in neuronal development in die mouse, but it disappears from neurons soon after birth, and thus Eg5 inhibition may not produce the peripheral neuropathy associated with treatment with paclitaxel and other anti-micro tubule drugs (Ferhat, L., Expression of the mitotic motor protein Eg5 in postmitotic neurons: implications for neuronal development. J Neurosci 1998, 18(19): 7822-7835). Herein we describe the isolation of a class of specific and potent inhibitors of Eg5, expected to be useful in the treatment of neoplastic disease.<br>

Utility<br>
The compounds of the present invention have utility for the treatment of neoplastic disease by inhibiting the microtubule motor protein HsEg5. Methods of treatment target Eg5 activity, which is required for the formation of a mitotic spindle and therefore for cell division. Thus, inhibitors of Eg5 have been shown to block cells in the metaphase of mitosis leading to apoptosis of effected cells, and to therefore have anti-proliferative effects. Thus Eg5 inhibitors act as modulators of cell division and are expected to be active against neoplastic disease such as<br>
carcinoina of the breast, ovary, lung, colon, prostate or other tissues, as well as leukemias and lyraphomas, tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system, and other tumor types such as melanoma, fibrosarcoma and osteosarcoma. Eg5 inhibitors are also expected to be useful for the treatment other proliferative diseases including but not limited to autoimmune, inflammatory:, neurological, and cardiovascular diseases.<br>
Compounds of the present invention have been shown to inhibit Eg5, as determined by Malachite Green Assay described herein.<br>
Compounds provided by this invention should also be useful as standards and reagents in determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical to inhibit Eg5. These would be provided in commercial kits comprising a compound of this invention<br>
Assays<br>
Malachite Green Assay<br>
Enzymatic activity of the Eg5 motor and effects of inhibitors was measured using a roalchite green assay, which measures phosphate liberated from ATP, and has been used previously to measure the activity of kinesin motors (Hackney and Jiang, 2001). Enzyme was recombinant HsEg5 motor domain (atnino acids 1 -369-8His) and was added at a final concentration of 6 uM to 100 Âµl reactions. Buffer consisted of 25 mM PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dtt, 0.01% Triton X-100 and 5 fiM paclitaxel. Malachite green/ammonium molybdate reagent was prepared as follows: for 800 ml final volume, 0.27 g of Malachite Green (J.T. Baker) was dissolved in 600 ml of H2O in a polypropylene bottle. 8.4 g ammonium molybdate (Sigma) was dissolved in 200 ml 4N HC1. The solutions were mixed for 20 min and filtered through 0.02 Âµm filter directly into a polypropylene container.<br>
5 Âµ1 of compound diluted in 12% DMSO was added to the wells of 96 well plates. 80 Âµl of enzyme diluted in buffer solution above was added per well and incubated ,with compound for 20 min. After mis pre-incubation, substrate solution containing 2 mM ATP (final concentration: 300ÂµM) and 6.053 ÂµM polymerized tubulin (final concentration: 908 nM) in 15Âµ1 of buffer<br>
were then added to each well to start reaction. Reaction was mixed and incubated for a particular 20 min at room temperature. The reactions were then quenched by the addition of 150 Âµl malachite green/ammonium molybdate reagent, and absorbance read at 650 nanometers exactly 5 min after quench using a Spectramax Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices). Data was graphed and IC50S calculated using ExCel Fit (Microsoft).<br><br><br><br>
