				<td>REFRACTORY COMPOSITION FOR CONSTRUCTING DOME PORTION OF<br>
FLUIDIZED BED REDUCTION FURNACE FOR REDUCTION OF IRON ORE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to refractories for constructing a dome portion of a<br>
fluidized bed reduction furnace for reduction of iron ore powder, and more particularly,<br>
to a refractory composition of castable refractories having high strength, good abrasion<br>
resistance, good chemical resistance against reductive gas, good thermal impact<br>
resistance, and good workability for constructing a dome portion of a fluidized bed<br>
reduction furnace for use in the FINEX process.<br>
Background Art<br>
In the modern steel production, an indirect method is used, in which molten<br>
iron prepared at first is subjected to decarbonization, to produce steel. The molten iron<br>
is produced by a blast furnace method, in which coke is used as fuel.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a diagram for describing a method for producing iron by using<br>
the blast furnace method schematically, wherein iron ore passes through a pretreatment<br>
process in which the iron ore is crushed, concentrated, briquetted of iron ore powder,<br>
sintered, to form hard pellets that are lumps of a predetermined size chargeable into the<br>
blast furnace, when coke from flaming coal is used as fuel. The pellets and the coke are<br>
charged into the blast furnace, and fired to produce the molten iron.<br>
Though the blast furnace method is used as the best iron production method for<br>
mass production of iron presently, the blast furnace method costs high due to<br>
complicated processes, and requirements for additional separate large sized facilities for<br>
sintering ore and cokes production, and causes a problem of discharging sulfur oxides<br>
SOx, nitrides NOx, carbon dioxide CO2, and the like, which are environment pollution<br>
substances, from the sintering ore and coke production.<br>
Equipment is developed by POSCO, a Korean steel production company, in<br><br>
which the production method of the blast furnace method is changed to reduce natural<br>
state iron ore powder directly by fluidized reaction without the pretreatment of the iron<br>
ore and coke, of which patent was filed with Korean patent application No. 10-1995-<br>
41931, patented with a Korean Patent registration No. 10-236160, of which process is<br>
named as FINEX process, and the equipment is constructed and put into test operation,<br>
recently.<br>
FIG 2 illustrates a diagram of the FINEX process, an iron production process,<br>
having the present invention applied thereto schematically, and FIG 3 illustrates an<br>
enlarged view of the fluidized bed reduction furnace in FIG 2. The FINEX process is a<br>
new iron production process for producing the molten iron economically, in which iron<br>
ore powder is reduced step by step through many stages of the fluidized bed reduction<br>
furnaces 1, and charges into a melting furnace 3 together with 8~50mm sized briquette<br>
coal, to form molten iron, wherein iron ore powder with a grain size of about 8mm is<br>
passed through many stages of fluidized bed reduction furnaces 1, to change into<br>
reduced iron ore, formed into pellets(HCI ; Hot Compact Iron), and charged into the<br>
melting furnace.<br>
The fluidized bed reduction furnace with a closed dome portion 4 is provided<br>
with a distribution plate 2 supported on columns (not shown) inside of the fluidized bed<br>
reduction furnace. The distribution plate is a member provided for making uniform<br>
distribution of high pressure, high temperature reductive gas introduced into the inside<br>
of the fluidized bed reduction furnace to fluidize and reduce the iron ore powder, and<br>
has a plurality of pass through holes for pass of gas.<br>
The dome portion 4 of the fluidized bed reduction furnace can be formed by<br>
attachment of refractory to a dome frame, when, since the refractory can not be brought<br>
into the inside of the fluidized bed reduction furnace 1 directly, the refractory is required<br>
to be sprayed by means of a gunning machine of the fluidized bed reduction furnace. It<br>
is required that the refractory construction of the gunning machine is stable even in a<br><br>
high pressure, high temperature reductive gas environment, and endures even under<br>
rapid rise and drop of temperature.<br>
Therefore, the refractory sprayed by the gunning machine to construct the dome<br>
4 of the fluidized bed reduction furnace 1 is a material having chemical resistance,<br>
particularly, corrosion resistance against CO gas, thermal impact resistance, and<br>
mechanical strength.<br>
Since the FINEX process equipment is the first one in the world, there has been<br>
no related art material for construction of the dome portion 4 yet. However, high<br>
alumina basis castable material was used in an experimental equipment, which causes a<br>
problem of shrinkage and cracking to break away during service due to poor CO gas<br>
resistance, and thermal impact resistance during service.<br>
Therefore, since the reaction furnace is not for small sized experimental<br>
equipment, but for full scale commercial production equipment for production of one<br>
million tones yearly, the material of the dome portion 4 is required to have no chemical<br>
reaction with the reductive gas and various components of the iron ore in the vicinity of<br>
600 ~ 1000°C during service, good abrasion resistance in a high temperature, high<br>
speed fluidized condition of the iron ore powder, and good thermal impact resistance<br>
enough to endure fast temperature rise and drop following re-operation of the equipment<br>
because cracks occur, not in a continuous operation, but in an intermittent operation.<br>
Moreover, the dome portion 4 of the fluidized bed reduction furnace 1 can not<br>
be formed completely at a place outside of the furnace 1 in a refractory state, and mount<br>
it on the furnace 1 in view of structural nature of design, but be formed by attaching the<br>
refractory to a dome frame of the dome 4. Therefore, it is required that workability of<br>
the refractory is secured as a material of a non-fixed form that enables spraying by the<br>
gunning machine, and there is no deformation of the structure even during curing and<br>
drying process after construction or no burst of the structure during construction<br>
because the dome is a large sized construction.<br><br>
Since a more rigorous service condition, particularly, thermal impact caused by<br>
rapid rise and drop of a temperature of, not the experimental equipment, but commercial<br>
equipment, is foreseen, a material for the dome portion is required to meet product<br>
design criteria of a structural density of below 2.55, dry compression strength of<br>
750kg/cm2 or higher at a service temperature, over 30% of porosity, CO gas resistance<br>
higher than A-B grade of ASTM C288.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a refractory composition, which<br>
is different from related art experimental refractory composition, for constructing a<br>
dome portion of a fluidized bed reaction furnace, which has corrosion resistance so as to<br>
be chemically stable in a reductive gas environment, thermal impact resistance, and<br>
mechanical strength at the time iron ore powder having a wide range of grain size<br>
distribution is reduced in many steps by fluidized bed reduction furnaces.<br>
The object of the present invention can be achieved by providing refractory<br>
composition for constructing a dome portion of a fluidized bed reduction furnace for<br>
reduction of iron ore powder including 1.5 ~ 2.5wt% of silica SiO2, below 0.05wt% of<br>
Fe2O3, 8 ~ 11wt% of CaO, and balance of alumina Al2O3, to make up 100wt% of the<br>
refractory composition.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further<br>
understanding of the invention, illustrate embodiments of the invention and together<br>
with the description serve to explain the principle of the invention. In the drawings;<br>
FIG 1 illustrates a diagram for describing a method for producing iron by using<br>
the blast furnace method schematically;<br>
FIG 2 illustrates a diagram an iron production process of the FINEX process<br>
having the present invention applied thereto schematically; and<br>
FIG 3 illustrates an enlarged view of the fluidized bed reduction furnace in FIG.<br><br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Final refractory composition of the present invention has 1.5 ~ 2.5wt% of silica<br>
SiO2, below 0.05wt% of Fe2O3, 8 ~ 11wt% of CaO, and balance of alumina A12O3, to<br>
make up 100wt% of the refractory composition, wherein contents of the silica SiO2, and<br>
Fe2O3 are defined for securing workability and the CO gas resistance because spray<br>
workability by using a spray gun becomes poor at a silica SiO2 content of below<br>
1.5wt%, and CO gas resistance at high temperature, and high pressure becomes poor, or<br>
sintering shrinkage at a high temperature occurs due to free silica components at a silica<br>
content higher than 2.5wt%, to drop the thermal impact resistance. The Fe2O3 is for the<br>
CO gas resistance, and content below 0.05wt% is preferable.<br>
The CaO is CaO content in a material, for an example, in a case of using<br>
alumina cement. Below 8wt% of the CaO causes to fail in securing workability (i.e.,<br>
regardless of kind of cement used or regardless of kind of CaO in a raw material used),<br>
resulting to drop attachment ratio in the construction, to increase rebound loss, to fail in<br>
securing a required strength.<br>
Over 11wt% of CaO content causes relative drop of the alumina A12O3 content<br>
to result in drop of strength at a high temperature, to make the thermal impact resistance<br>
poor, even if workability and strength can be secured.<br>
As a main component of alumina Al2O3, sintered or melted alumina may be<br>
used, and since the fluidized bed reduction furnace 1 having the present invention<br>
applied thereto is used in a strong reductive environment, it is preferable that the<br>
alumina content is higher than 95%.<br>
With reference to a whole composition of 100wt%, it is hot preferable that the<br>
alumina content, the main component, is too low, that increases contents of other sub-<br>
components (rest of components excluding the main component) to fail to obtain above<br>
described properties, and that increases the CaO content to drop the strength, and<br><br>
opposite to this, if the alumina content, the main component, is too high, that decreases<br>
contents of other sub-components relatively, to fail to meet required properties, and<br>
increases the density to drop the porosity below 30%.<br>
The refractory composition of the present invention, a material for constructing<br>
the dome portion 4-of the fluidized bed reduction furnace 1 for reduction of iron ore<br>
powder, is an alumina basis refractory composition having properties of a structural<br>
density of below 2.55, 30% or higher porosity at 1000°C, 750kg/cm2 or over dry<br>
compression strength, below 10% of dome construction rebound loss, and A ~ B grade<br>
or higher CO gas resistance with reference to ASTM C288.<br>
Table 1 below shows comparison of refractory composition for construction of<br>
a dome portion of the fluidized bed reduction furnace of a FINEX process applied to<br>
experimental equipment (comparative example), and a commercial equipment<br>
(embodiment).<br>
Table 1<br><br><br>
The gunning machine used in spraying the refractory composition of the present<br>
invention in construction of the dome portion 4 of the fluidized bed reduction furnace 1<br>
has an air discharge pressure 2kg/cm or higher, and a water discharge pressure 2kg/cm2<br>
or higher.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
Since the alumina basis refractory obtained from the refractory composition of<br>
the present invention permits to secure workability required for basic design, and has<br>
properties of 30% or over of porosity at 1000°C, 750kg/cm2 or over of dry compression<br>
strength, 10% or below of dome construction rebound loss, and A ~ B grade of CO gas<br>
resistance with reference to ASTM C288, the dome portion of the fluidized bed<br>
reduction furnace of the refractory composition prevents deformation of the structure<br>
during curing or construction process or burst during construction, and has properties of<br>
a corrosion resistance so as to be chemically stable in a reductive gas environment,<br>
thermal impact resistance, and mechanical strength, thereby providing very high<br>
industrial applicability.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the<br>
modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of<br>
the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
