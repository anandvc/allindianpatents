				<td>This invention relates to a process for removing chloride from a chloride-containing iron oxide to produce iron oxide with a reduced chloride content.<br>
During the last twenty years, the regenerated iron oxides (RIO) produced from hydrochloric acid waste liquid generated from steel pickling have been recognized as an important source of raw material for preparing products containing iron oxides such as iron-oxide based catalysts and high-grade ferrites. The raw material cost savings associated with the substitution of a low cost, regenerated iron oxide for most of the conventional commercial sources of iron oxides are substantial.<br>
One drawback of utilizing regenerated iron oxides from hydrochloric acid waste liquids generated from steel pickling is that the ferric oxides inevitably contain chloride ions, typically in the range of about 0.1 to 0.5% measured as grams of chloride per 100 grams of regenerated iron oxide. In the field of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation catalysts, it is known that the small amounts of residual chloride present in all regenerated iron oxides affect catalyst performance adversely. For the ferrite producers, the chloride ion present in the regenerated iron oxide is not only corrosive to the ferrite manufacturing installations but also injurious to the quality of the ferrite produced.<br>
Reducing the chloride-ion content in regenerated ion oxides by an economical procedure, without significantly changing the ferric oxide quality is believed to be one of the most critical issues for the development of regenerated iron oxides as commercially useful raw materials.<br>
Japanese patent application J59,050,031, published September 13, 199.2, discloses a method for purifying iron oxide from waste hydrochloric acid pickling solution containing ferric chloride by treatment with ferrous sulfate, ferric sulfate or ammonium sulfate solution. The iron oxide purified by this prior art method<br>
still contains a substantial amount of chloride. Moreover, it is time consuming to dissolve these salts in water. Furthermore, the raw material costs for these sulfate salts are relatively high.<br>
Suganuma, et al. in 4th International Conference on Ferrites, Advances in Ceramics, Vol. 15, 81-85 (1986), reported a method for removing chloride ions from hematite powders by heating the ferric oxide in air with the addition of sulphur dioxide and/or moisture. However, sulphur oxide is a toxic gas which is unhealthy and environmentally undesirable.<br>
Thus, there remains a need for a commercial process which will substantially reduce the chloride contents in regenerated iron oxides (RIO) at a low cost without significantly changing the quality of the iron oxides.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for removing chloride from a chloride-containing iron oxide to produce iron oxide with a reduced chloride content, which process comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	mixing the chloride-containing iron oxide with a solution in a conventional manner for a period of time sufficient to form a mixture, the said solution comprising sulphuric acid (H2SO4); and<br>
b)	separating the iron oxide from the mixture formed in step (a) and then optionally heating at a temperature from 1°C above the ambient temperature to 1400°C for a period of time from 1 minute to 100 hours to obtain the iron oxide having a reduced chloride content.<br>
The iron oxides to be treated by the process of the present invention in its broadest aspect are selected from any iron oxides of mineral or synthetic origin which contain either trace or substantial amounts of chloride. Various methods for the obtaining of iron oxides from scrap steel, steel scaling liquors, or iron chloride as industrial waste product have been described in U.S. Patent No. 4,935,219. The iron oxides obtained from some of these methods inevitably contain residual chlorides originating from the chloride-containing reagents or raw materials present during the process of generating the iron oxides.<br>
As a preferred embodiment, the iron oxides treated in the instant invention are the regenerated iron oxides (RIO) produced from hydrochloric acid waste liquids generated from steel pickling. During the process of producing the regenerated iron oxides, hydrochloric acid pickling wastes are sprayed into a roaster, whereby water and free HCl in the wastes are driven off quickly, while FeCl2 is hydrolyzed to produce iron oxide and hydrogen chloride.  The regenerated iron oxides contain chloride ions, typically in the range of from about 800 pairts per million to abou':: 20,000 parts per million, particularly in the range of from about 800 to 5,000 parts per million, by weight of the:  regenerated iron oxides.<br>
The sulfuric acid used in treating iron oxides in the instant invention can be any commercial or reagent grade: sulfuric acid. Preferably, concentrated sulfuric acid is diluted with water, more preferably with deionized water or distilled water, before being used as the reagent for treating iron oxides.  In a specific embodiment of the present invention, concentrated sulfuric acid with specific gravity of about 1.84 g/ml is diluted with about ten time; to 100 times by volume of deionized water prior to being used for treating the iron oxide.<br>
The molar amount of sulfuric acid in the sulfuric acid solution used for treating iron oxides is generally a molar amount of from 0.5 co 10, preferably from 1.0 to 5.0, more preferably from i.8 to 2.5, still more preferably 2.0 times relative to the total molar amount cf chloride present in the iron oxides to be treated.<br>
The iron oxides may be treated with a sulfuric acid solution by any method known to one skilled in the art which would achieve thorough mixing of the iron oxides with the sulfuric acid solution As a non- limiting example, the iron oxides may be slurried with the sulfuric solution followed by either decantation or filtering.  As another non-limiting example, the iron oxides may also be wetted with the sulfuric acid solution and mulled to form a paste.<br>
In the broadest aspect of the present invention, the iron oxides are treated with the sulfuric acid solution for at least a<br>
period of time sufficient to achieve thorough mixing of the sulfuric acid solution with the iron oxides.   Typically, the treatment lasts from 1 minute to 4 8 hours.  In a specific embodiment of the present: invention, the treatment lasts from 3 minutes to 5 hours, more specifically from 10 minutes to 30 minutes.<br>
The treatment of iron oxides with sulfuric acid solution can be conducted under a pressure from about 50 kPa to about 10000 kPa. Lr one specific embodiment of the present invention, it is conducted under ambient pressure.  The treatment can be conducted in any suitable atmosphere.  Non-limiting examples of the suitable atmosphere include: air, other oxygen containing gaseous streams, and inert gaseous streams.<br>
After the iron oxides are treated with sulfuric acid solution, they can be separated from the solution by any suitable separation method.  Without intending to limit the scope of the invention, the treated iron oxides can be separated out by filtration, centrifugation, etc.<br>
As a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the treated iron oxides, after being separated from the sulfuric acid solution are subsequently heated at an elevated temperature.  The heating and/or calcining is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from 1° above the ambient temperature to 14 00 °C for a period of tim«: sufficient to dry or calcine the treated iron oxides completely. Typically, the iron oxides are calcined and/or dried for from 1 minute to 100 hours. This heating step can be a simple drying process, a calcination process, or a staged drying and calcination process.  The heating is conducted under a pressure typically from 10 k?a to 1100 kPa.  As a non-limiting example, the heating step can be conducted under ambient pressure.  The heating step can be conducted under any suitable atmospheres.  Non-limiting examples or: the suitable atmospheres for the heating step include air, oxygen containing gaseous streams, inert gaseous streams, and vacuum.<br>
In one specific embodiment of the present invention, the iron oxides are treated with a sulfuric acid solution and the treated iron oxides are separated from the solution without subsequent<br>
heating.   The treated iron oxides can optionally be dried in air at ambient temperature and ambient pressure.  In another specific embodiment of the present invention, the iron oxides are dried in air at a temperature between 30 °C and 300 °C, preferably between 50 °C and 300 °C, more preferably between 100 °C and 300 °C, for a period of time ranging from 1 minute to 72 hours, preferably from 2 minutes to one hour, more preferably from 10 minutes to 30 minutes.  In a preferred embodiment, the treated iron oxides are subsequently calcined for a period of time from 1 minute to 72 hours, preferably from 15 minutes to 10 hours, more preferably from 30 minutes to 2 hours.  In another preferred embodiment, the iron oxides are first dried at a temperature between 30 °C and 300 °C, preferably between 120 °C and 200 °C for a period of time ranging from 1 minute to 72 hours, preferably from 2 minutes to one hour, more preferably from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, and then calcined for a period of time from 1 minute to 72 hours, preferably from 15 minutes to 10 hours, more preferably from 30 minutes to 2 hours.<br>
After the iron oxides are dried and optionally calcined, a sample of the treated iron oxides can be analyzed with a suitable analytical method(s) to determine the chloride content.  The post-treatment chloride content is then compared with the chloride content measured prior to the treatment.<br>
The; invention will be exemplified by the following illustrative embodiments. Illustrative Embodiments<br>
