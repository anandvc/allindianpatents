METHOD AND APPARATUS<br>
FOR<br>
MANUFACTURING CUTTING INSERTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for<br>
manufacturing pre-sintcred cutting insert green bodies, to be subsequently sintered mio<br>
cutting inserts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fabrication ofciitting inserts from sintcrable powders, i.e., metallurgical,<br>
cermets or ceramics powders, comprises compaction of the smterablc powder, with or<br>
without a fugitive binder, into a prc-sintcred green body, and subsequent smtermg of<br>
the green body to produce a cutting insert. Compaction takes place under high<br>
pressures obtained through large opposing forces generated by top and bottom punches<br>
urged towards a die cavity formed in a die containing the sintcrable powder, as is well<br>
known in the art. However, while parts having undercut elements may generally be<br>
pressed, the undercut elements inhibit release and subsequent extraction of the<br>
compacted green body from the die cavity.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method for<br>
manufacturing compacted powder green bodies having undercut elements This object<br>
is attained with the subject matter in accordance with the claims<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
in accordance with the present invention, there is preferably provided a<br>
method for manufacturing a cutting insert green body, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) Providing top mid bottom dies and top and bottom punches associated<br>
therewith and slidably reciprocable relative (hereto. Kach die comprises opposing die<br>
abutment and die mounting faces and a die inner periphcial surface extending<br>
therebetween. Each die inner peripheral surface comprises an inner first peripheral surface<br><br>
WO 2006/080002	PCT/112006/000036<br>
extending from the die abutment face, an inner second peripheral surface extending iron)<br>
the inner first peripheral sari ace and converging inwardly to a die inner edge, and an inner<br>
third peripheral surface extending from the die inner edge to ihe die mounting face and<br>
forming a punch tunnel. Each punch comprises opposing punch pressing and punch<br>
mounting faces, with a punch peripheral surface extending therebetween and forming a<br>
punch edge at an intersection of the punch peripheral surface and the punch pressing face.<br>
(ii) Positioning the top and bottom dies in a closed position, in winch<br>
respective die abutment faces abut, and respective inner first and second peripheral<br>
surfaces form a die cavity. The bottom punch is located m the punch luimol of the bottom<br>
die, and the top punch is external to the punch tunnel of the top die.<br>
(iii)      Filling the die cavity with a pre-detcrmincd amount of sinterablc powder.<br>
(iv)      Moving the top punch into the punch tunnel of the top die<br>
(v) Compacting the sinterablc powder by urging the punches through the<br>
respective punch tunnels towards each other to a compaction position In the compaction<br>
position, the punch edge of the top punch and the die inner edge of the top die are<br>
contiguous, and the punch edge of the bottom punch and the die inner edge of the bottom<br>
die are contiguous, thereby forming the green body.<br>
(vi) Moving the top die and punch away from the bottom die and punch to an<br>
open position, thereby enabling removal of the green body.<br>
Preferably, the green body comprises opposing green body end faces and a<br>
peripheral side surface extending therebetween. The green body end faces are formed by<br>
the punch pressing faces. The green body peripheral surface is formed by the die inner<br>
first and second peripheral surfaces of the top and bottom dies<br>
Further preferably, the green body comprises top and bottom gieen body<br>
edges formed at intersections of the top and bottom green body end faces with the gieen<br>
body peripheral surface, respectively. Associated contiguous top and bottom punch edges<br>
and top and bottom die inner edges form top and bottom common die cavity edges,<br>
respectively. The top and bottom green body edges are formed at the top and bottom<br>
common die cavity edges.<br>
Yet further preferably, the green body comprises a median plane M<br>
extending between the top and bottom green body end faces. In the compaction position,<br>
the abutting top and bottom die abutment faces coincide with the green body median plane<br>
M.<br>

WO 2006/080002	PCT/112006/000036<br>
If desired, the green body peripheral surface comprises top and bottom<br>
green body relief surfaces adjacent the green body edges. Each green body ichef surface<br>
forms a relief angle p with the green body median plane M. The relief angle p is obtuse at<br>
least a portion of each green body relief surface.<br>
Tf further desired, the relief surfaces arc formed by the inner second<br>
peripheral surfaces.<br>
Typically, the green body end faces comprise rake surfaces adjacent the<br>
green body edges. Adjacent rake and relief surfaces form a wedge having a non-obtuse<br>
wedge angle co.<br>
Generally, the wedge angle eo is acute at least along a portion of the wedge.<br>
In accordance with another preferred embodiment, the green body may<br>
comprise a longitudinal through-hole extending between the green body end faces. The<br>
longitudinal through-hole is formed by a longitudinal rod extending between the punch<br>
pressing faces through the die cavity.<br>
Tf desired, the longitudinal rod comprises slidably rcciprocable top and<br>
bottom longitudinal pins disposed in top and bottom punch pin through-bores formed in<br>
the top and bottom punches.<br>
Alternatively, the green body may comprise a lateral through-hole<br>
extending between two opposing green body major side surfaces of the green body<br>
peripheral surface. The lateral through-hole is formed by a lateral rod extending through<br>
the die cavity between opposing inner side portions of the inner first peripheral surfaces of<br>
the top and bottom dies.<br>
Preferably, the lateral rod comprises opposing shdabiy recipiocubie lateral<br>
pins disposed in top and bottom die pin channels ol'the top and bottom dies.<br>
The present invention provides the following preferred advantages'<br>
facilitating pressing and subsequent ejection of green bodies having undercut<br>
elements;<br>
forming green bodies which have sharp, well-defined edges and acute wedge<br>
angles desirable for cutting inserts manufactured from the green bodies;<br>
increasing tool-set rigidity while reducing risks of powder adhesion to the dies or<br>
punches and subsequent tear-off damage to the compacted green body, by eliminating<br>
acute re-entrant elements in the design of the tool-set.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Attention is drawn to Figs. 1 to 4. A pre-sintered green body 20 is<br>
preferably formed by compaction of a sinterable powder consisting of metallurgical,<br>
ceramic or cermet powder, and a binder. The green body 20 is generally rectangular in<br>
an end view and has identical, opposing (i.e., facing in opposite directions) top and<br>
bottom green body end faces 22', 22"    In the present description, when following a<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2006/080002	PCT/112006/000036<br>
reference numeral, a single prime (') denotes a feature associated with the lop side of<br>
the green body cutting insert, while a double prime (") denotes a feature associated with<br>
the bottom side of the green body cutting insert. Each green body end face 22', 22" has<br>
a 180° rotational symmetry about an axis of symmetry S which passes through the two<br>
green body end faces 22', 22". A peripheral green body side surface 24 extends<br>
between the two green body end faces 22', 22". The peripheral green body side surface<br>
24 comprises two opposing, identical major side faces 24.J of a general parallelogram<br>
shape; two opposing, identical minor side faces 2-4N, also generally parallelogram in<br>
shape; and four curved corner surfaces 24C. Each corner surface 24C extends between<br>
a major side face 24J and an adjacent minor side face 24N.<br>
Major and minor green body axes .1, N are defined as being<br>
perpendicular to each other and to the axis of symmetry S. The major axis J extends<br>
through the major side faces 24J and the minor axis N extends through the minor side<br>
faces 24JN'. liach major side face 24,1 has a 180" rotational symmetiy about the major<br>
axis J, and each minor side face 24N has a 180° rotational symmeti\ about the minor<br>
axis N. The major and minor axes J, N define a median plane M extending beuvcen die<br>
top and bottom green body end faces 22', 22".<br>
Intersections of each green body end face 22", 22" and the peripheral<br>
green body side surface 24 define top and bottom green body edges 26', 26",<br>
respectively. Following sintering, the green body 20 becomes an indexable and<br>
reversible cutting insert and at least a portion of each of the top and bottom green body<br>
edges 26', 26" becomes a cutting edge.<br>
Each green body edge 26', 26" comprises two major edges 26.J', 26J"<br>
formed by the intersection of the major side faces 24J and each of the top and bottom<br>
end faces 22'. 22"; two minor edges 26!S", 26N'" formed by the intersection of the<br>
minor side faces 24N and each of the top and bottom end faces 22'. 22"". and four<br>
corner edges 26C, 26C" formed by the intersection of the corner surfaces 24C and<br>
each of the top and bottom end faces 22', 22".<br>
The peripheral green body side surface 24 has top and bottom relief<br>
surfaces 28', 28" adjacent the top and bottom green body edges 26', 26", respectively.<br>
Bach major side face 24J has two major relief surfaces 28.1', 28.f" adjacent the major<br>
edges 26.P, 26J"; each minor side faces 24N has two minor relief surfaces 28N', 28N"<br>
adjacent the minor edges 26N', 26N"; and each corner surface 24C has two corner<br>

WO 2006/080002	PCT/112006/000036<br>
relief surfaces 28C, 28C" extending along the corner edges 26C, 26C" A central<br>
peripheral surface 30 extends between the top and bottom relief surfaces 28', 28". Each<br>
major side face 24.1 has a major central surfaces 30J extending between the top and<br>
bottom major relief surfaces 28J', 28J"; each minor side face 24N has a minor central<br>
surfaces 30N extending between the top and bottom minor relief surfaces 28IN", 28N",<br>
and each corner surface 24C has a corner central surface 30C extending between the top<br>
and bottom corner relief surfaces 28C, 28C". In a preferred embodiment, the green<br>
body median plane M intersects the central peripheral surface 30.<br>
Each of the major relief surfaces 28J', 28.1" forms a major relief angle p,j<br>
with the green body median plane M. In accordance with the preferred embodiment,<br>
the major relief angles pJ are obtuse, and therefor one of the top and bottom major<br>
relief surfaces 28J', 28J" constitutes an undercut element of the green body 20. It is<br>
understood that, similarly, the minor and corner relief surfaces 28N', 28N", 28C, 2SC"<br>
form minor and corner relief angles with the green body median plane M<br>
As best seen in Fig 2, the green body top end face 22' has a top land 32'<br>
that extends parallel to, and inwardly from the top green body edge 26' towards the axis<br>
of symmetry S. The top land 32' comprises a pair of top major lands 32,)' formed along<br>
the top major edges 26.1', a pair of Lop minor lands 32N' fonued along the top minor<br>
edges 26N' and four top corner lands 32C formed along the top corner edges 26C A<br>
Top rake surface 34' extends inwardly from the top land 32' towards the axis of<br>
symmetry S while sloping towards the median plane M. The top rake surface 34'<br>
comprises a pair of top major rake surfaces 34.P adjacent the top major lands 32J", a<br>
pair of top minor rake surfaces 34N' adjacent the top minor lands 32N', and four top<br>
corner rake surfaces 34C adjacent the top corner lands 32C 11 is understood that the<br>
green body top end face 22', and in particular its top rake surface 32', may comprise<br>
various geometries and features, such as chjp breakers. It is further understood that the<br>
green body bottom end face 22" has a land and rake surface structure similar to that of<br>
the green body top end face 22'.<br>
As seen m Fig. 4, adjacent top major relief surface 28.1" and top major<br>
rake surface 34.F form a top major wedge 36J' having a top major wedge angle o)J' It<br>
is understood that a top minor wedge having a top minor wedge angle is formed<br>
between adjacent top minor relief surface 28N' and top minor rake surface 34N' while a<br>
top corner wedge 36C having a top corner wedge angle is formed between each<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2006/080002	PCT/112006/000036<br>
adjacent top corner relief surface 28C and top corner rake surface 34C', In accordance<br>
with a preferred embodiment, the top major wedge angle a)J', the top minor wedge<br>
angle and the top corner wedge angle are all acute. It is understood that the green body<br>
bottom end face 22 also has such wedges and wedge angles.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs 5 and 11. The green body 20 is<br>
compacted in a tool-set 38 having top and bottom dies 40', 40". Each die 40', 40"<br>
comprises a die mounting face 42', 42" used to attach the die 40', 40" to a press (not<br>
shown) opposing a die abutment face 44', 44" and die outer and inner peripheral<br>
surfaces 46', 46", 48', 48" extending therebetween. Each die inner peripheral surface<br>
48', 48" comprises an inner first peripheral surface SO', 50" extending from, and<br>
transversely to, the die abutment face 44', 44"; an inner second peripheral surface 52',<br>
52" extending from the inner first peripheral surface SO', 50" and converging inwardly<br>
to a die inner edge 54', 54"; and an inner third peripheral surface 56', 56" extending<br>
from the die inner edge 54', 54" to the die mounting face 42', 42" The inner third<br>
peripheral surface 56', 56" forms a punch tunnel 58', 58".<br>
Top and bottom punches 60', 60'" arc associated with the top and bottom<br>
dies 40', 40", respectively, and adapted to be slidably reciprocable m relation thereto,<br>
through the respective punch tunnels 58', 58" Thus, each punch can slide m either<br>
direction within its punch tunnel. Each punch comprises a punch mounting face 62'.<br>
62", used to attach the punch to the press, opposing a punch pressing face 64'. 64" and<br>
a punch peripheral surface 66', 66" extending therebetween, forming a punch edge 68',<br>
68" at the intersection thereof with the punch pressing face 64', 64" Each die or<br>
punch 40', 40", 60', 60" is capable of independent reciprocating motion relative to each<br>
of the other top and bottom dies or punches 40'. 40", 60', 60".<br>
Attention is additionally drawn to Figs. 6 to 8. To manufacture the green<br>
body 20, the tool-set 38 is cycled through closing, filling, compaction and opening<br>
steps. In the closing step (Fig 6), the tool-set 38 is brought to a closed position, in<br>
which the die abutment faces 44', 44" abut, and the first and second inner die peripheral<br>
surfaces 50', 50", 52', 52", form a die cavity 70 extending between the top and bottom<br>
die inner edges 54', 54". The bottom punch 60" is located in the punch tunnel 58" of<br>
the bottom die 40", with its punch edge 68" located below the die inner edge 54", while<br>
the top punch 60' is positioned outside the punch tunnel 58' of the top die 40'.<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2006/080002	PCT/112006/000036<br>
In the filling step (Fig. 7), the die cavity 70 is filled through the punch<br>
tunnel 58' of the top die 40' with a pre-dctermined amount of sinterable powder 72<br>
Subsequent to filling the die cavity 70, the top punch 60' is lowered into the punch<br>
tunnel 58' of the top die 40', thereby scaling the sintcrable powder 72 in the die cavity<br>
70.<br>
In the compaction step, the sintcrable powder 72 is compacted to form<br>
the green body 20, as shown in Fig. 5, as the tool-set 38 is brought to a compaction<br>
position, by urging the top and bottom punches 60', 60" towards each other, until each<br>
punch edge 68', 68" and its associated die inner edge 54', 54" are contiguous, thereby<br>
forming top and bottom common die cavity edges 74', 74" In accordance with the<br>
preferred embodiment, during the compaction step, the green body end faces 22', 22"<br>
are formed by the punch pressing faces 64', 64". Each green body edge 26% 26" is<br>
formed at the common die cavity edges 74', 74". The green body relief sui face 28',<br>
28'" are formed by the inner second peripheral surfaces 52', 52", and the green body top<br>
and bottom central surfaces 30', 30" are formed by the inner first peripheral surfaces<br>
50', 50" of the top and bottom dies 40', 40", respectively, while the top and bottom die<br>
abutment faces 44', 44" coincide with the green body median plane M.<br>
Due to the presence of the undercut elements of the green body, i.e the<br>
top and bottom major relief surfaces 28J', 28.1" having obtuse relief angles pJ, and due<br>
to the matching geometry of the die inner second peripheral surfaces 52', 52", the green<br>
body 20 cannot be released from the die cavity 70 and extracted theiefrom through the<br>
punch tunnel 58' of the top die 40'. In order to release the green body 20 and extract it<br>
from the tool-set 38, an opening step has to be performed, m which the lool-sci is<br>
brought to an open position (see Fig. 8). To arrive at the open position, the lop die 40'<br>
and the top punch 60' are moved up and away from the bottom die 40" and the bottom<br>
punch 60", opening the die cavity 70 and thereby exposing the green body 20, leaving it<br>
free to be removed from the bottom die 40".<br>
The method of manufacturing a cutting insert green body has been<br>
illustrated above for a cutting insert having no through-hole However, it will be<br>
apparent to a person skilled m the art that the above described method can easily be<br>
applied to manufacturing of cutting insert green bodies having through-holes formed<br>
therein.<br>

WO 2006/080002	PCT/112006/000036<br>
Attention is drawn to Figs. 9 and 11. A longitudinal through-hole gieen<br>
body 220 is compacted by a longitudinal through-hole tool-set 238 Since the<br>
longitudinal through-hole green body 220 and the longitudinal through-hole tool-set<br>
238 have many features which are similar to those of the green body 20 without a<br>
through-hole and its associated tool-set 38, similar features will be icferred to heroin<br>
below by reference numerals which arc shifted by 200 from those of the green body 20<br>
without a through-hole and the associated tool-set 38. The longitudinal ihrough-liole<br>
green body 220 comprises a longitudinal through-hole 76 extending between the<br>
longitudinal through-hole green body top and bottom end faces 222', 222"<br>
perpendicularly to the green body median plane M. The longitudinal through-hole tool-<br>
set 238 comprises top and bottom longitudinal pins 78', 78" slidably disposed in punch<br>
pm through-bores 80', 80" extending through the punch mounting face 262', 262" and<br>
the punch pressing face 264', 264" of the respective top and bottom punches 260',<br>
260". During compaction of the longitudinal through-hole green body 220, the<br>
longitudinal pins 78', 78" extend into the die cavity 270 and constitute a longitudinal<br>
rod 82 which extends between the top and bottom punch pressing faces 264", 264", to<br>
form the longitudinal through-hole 76 in the compacted longitudinal through-hole gieea<br>
body 220.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 10 and 13 A lateral through-hole green<br>
body 420 is compacted by a lateral through-hole tool-set 438. Since the lateral through-<br>
hole green body 420 and the lateral through-hole tool-set 438 have many features which<br>
are similar to those of the green body 20 without a through-hole and its associated tool-<br>
set 38, similar features will be referred to herein below by reference numerals which arc<br>
shifted by 400 from those of the green body 20 without a through-hole and the<br>
associated tool-set 38. Thus, the tool-set 438 includes top and bottom dies 440', 440"<br>
and top and bottom punches 460", 460"<br>
The lateral through-hole green body 420 comprises a iaieia] tiuough-<br>
hole 84 extending between lateral through-hole green body major central sui faces 430J<br>
of opposing lateral through-hole green body major side faces 424J along the major axis<br>
J. The lateral through-hole tool-set 438 comprises first and second lateral pins 86V,<br>
86S slidably disposed in first and second top and bottom die pin channels 88'F, 88'S,<br>
88"F, 88"S. During compaction of the lateral through-hole green body 420, the first<br>
and second lateral pins 86F, 86S protrude into the die cavity 470 and abut each other to<br>
-9-<br><br>
WO 2006/080002	PCT/112006/000036<br>
form a lateral rod 90. The lateral rod 90 extends through first and second top and<br>
bottom opposing portions 92'F, 92'S, 92"F, 92"S of the die inner first peripheral<br>
surface to form the lateral throngli-holc 84 of the lateral through-hole green body 420.<br>
The above-described apparatus and method may facilitate pressing and subsequent<br>
ejection of green bodies having undercut elements They also may allow for the formation<br>
of green bodies which have sharp, well-defined edges and acute wedge angles of the soil<br>
generally found desirable in cutting inserts manufactured from the green bodies. Finally,<br>
by eliminating acute re-entrant elements in its design, a tool set in accordance with the<br>
present invention may have adequate rigidity without suffering from increased risks of<br>
powder adhesion to the dies or punches and subsequent tear-off damage to the compacted<br>
green body.<br>
Although the present invention has been described to a cerlam degree of<br>
particularity, it should be understood that alterations and modifications to the present<br>
invention may possibly be made without departing from the scope of the invention as<br>
hereinafter claimed.<br>
