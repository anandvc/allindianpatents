The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display, and particularly, to a structure of attaching and connecting a liquid crystal display unit which is configured so that, when connection terminals formed on a flexible circuit board are to be connected to a printed circuit board through a conductor-embedded elastic member, a corrugated elastic member is interposed between a holding member and the flexible circuit board, thereby enabling the attachment and the connection to be uniformly attached and conducted.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to Figs, 1 to 3.<br>
Fig. 1 is a view showing the configuration of a liquid crystal display device which is an embodiment of the invention-Referring to Fig. 1, the liquid crystal display device comprises: a holding member 10 to which a liquid crystal display unit 11, a flexible circuit board 12, and a light guiding plate 15 are attached and held; a printed circuit board 20 having light emitting elements (LED chips) 22 and exposed contact portions 23; conductor-embedded elastic members 30; and a corrugated elastic member 40.<br><br>
In the vicinity of the tip end of the flexible circuit board 12, contact portions 13 and positioning holes 14 are formed. In the holding member 10/hooks 17 are disposed in a bottom portion, and positioning bosses 16 are disposed on the rear face.<br>
Next, the operation of attaching and connecting the liquid crystal display device of the embodiment of the invention will be described. Referring to Fig, 1, first, the light guiding plate 15 is placed on the surface of the holding member 10, Next, the liquid crystal display unit 11 into which the flexible circuit board 12 is incorporated is placed on the holding member 10. The flexible circuit board is previously connected to transparent electrodes of a liquid crystal display element by a conductive adhesive agent or the like.<br>
In this placement, a tip end portion of the flexible, circuit board 12 is projected from a portion of a side face of the holding member 10 where an opening is set so as to correspond to the width (short side) of the flexible circuit board 12. The flexible circuit board is bent back to the rear side into a substantially U~like shape.<br>
The corrugated elastic member 40 is previously placed on the rear face of the holding member 10. The tip end portion of the holding member 10 is placed below the corrugated elastic member 40, and then fixed with passing the positioning bosses 16 on the rear side of the holding member through the positioning holes 14 disposed in the tip end of the flexible circuit board 12.<br><br>
Therefore, the contact portions 13 disposed on the tip end of the flexible circuit board 12 are opposed to the exposed contact portions 23 of the printed circuit board 20.<br>
The contact portions 13 disposed on the flexible circuit board 12 are arranged evenly in a lateral direction along a short side of the flexible circuit board, and the exposed contact portions 23 of the printed circuit board 20 are arranged evenly in a lateral direction along a short side of the printed circuit board 20.<br>
Next, the conductor-embedded elastic members 30 also are arranged evenly in a lateral direction on the exposed contact portions 23 of the printed circuit board 20. The hooks 17 of the holding member 10 into which the liquid crystal display unit 11 and the like are incorporated as described above are engaged with recesses which are formed in predetermined positions of the printed circuit board 20, i.e., along the long sides of the printed circuit board 20. The positioning bosses 16 of the holding member 10 are passed through positioning holes 24 which are formed along the short side of the printed circuit board 20.<br>
As a result, the contact portions 13 disposed on the tip end of the flexible circuit board 12 that is bent back to the rear side of the holding member 10 into which the liquid crystal display unit 11 and the like are incorporated and held, and the exposed contact portions 23 of the printed circuit board 20 are urged by the elastic force of the corrugated elastic member 40. The<br><br>
elastic force of the corrugated elastic member 40 is varied only by applying a force to the member to change the wave height, and hence has the property of applying the elastic force evenly in a predetermined range.<br>
Figs, 2 and 3 shows the liquid crystal display device which is attached and connected as described above. Fig. 2 is a section view of the liquid crystal display unit of Fig. 1, and taken along the direction A.<br>
As seen from Fig. 2, the corrugated elastic member 40 is interposed between the holding member 10 and the flexible circuit board 12, the bosses 16 of the holding member 10 are passed through the positioning holes of the printed circuit board 20, the hooks 17 are engaged with the predetermined positions of the printed circuit board 20, and the connection terminals formed on the flexible circuit board are attached and connected to the printed circuit board through the conductor-embedded elastic members 30.<br>
In the liquid crystal display unit shown in Fig. 2, actually, a glass plate and the transparent electrodes are arranged across the LCD (liquid crystal display) element. This assembly is placed on the light guiding plate 15, and below a transparent plate which is placed on a cover 36 via a cushion 35 that is disposed on the periphery of the holding member 10.<br>
Fig. 3 is a section view of the device for attaching and connecting a liquid crystal display unit of Fig. 1, and taken along the direction B. As seen from Fig. 3 , the light emitting elements<br><br>
(LED chips) 22 disposed on the printed circuit board 20 are housed in the holding member 10  and light emitted from the light emitting elements (LED chips) 22 is guided to the light guiding plate 15 via a reflecting surface formed on the holding member 10.<br>
Furthermore, the manner will be seen in which the contact portions 13 disposed in the tip end of the flexible circuit board 12 are contacted and connected to the conductor-embedded elastic members 30 placed on the exposed contact portions 23 of the printed circuit board 20, by an adequate pressure exerted by the elastic force of the corrugated elastic member 40.<br>
In the same manner as Fig. 2, in Fig. 3 also, actually, the liquid crystal display unit is configured so that the glass plate and the transparent electrodes are arranged across the LCD (liquid crystal display) element. This assembly is placed on the light guiding plate 15, and below the transparent plate which is placed on the cover 36 via the cushion 35 that is disposed on the periphery of the holding member 10.<br>
In Figs. 1 to 3, it is not shown that a control LSI for the liquid crystal display unit is mounted on the flexible circuit board 12 . The mounting of such a control LSI is known in the fields of a TAB (Tape-Automated-Bonding), etc- Therefore, the LSI is not shown in the figures.<br>
The thus configured liquid crystal display device of the invention comprises: a liquid crystal display unit; a flexible circuit board which is connected to the liquid crystal display<br><br>
unit, contact portions being formed in a tip end portion of a flexible circuit board, the flexible circuit board being bent back outside the holding memUer described later; the holding member which holds the liquid crystal display unit; a printed circuit board to which the holding member is attached, and on which contact portions are exposed; conductor-embedded elastic members through which the contact portions on the printed circuit board are connected to the contact portions of the flexible circuit board, respectively; and a corrugated elastic member which is interposed between the holding member and the flexible circuit board to press the flexible circuit board, and the flexible circuit board is bent back outside the holding member and urged by the corrugated elastic member, whereby the printed circuit board is electrically connected to the flexible circuit board.<br>
This configuration attains an effect that the corrugated elastic member is interposed between the holding member and the flexible circuit board, thereby enabling the connection terminals formed on the flexible circuit board, and the printed circuit board to be uniformly attached and connected together.<br><br><br><br>
