(a)	IPCA LABORATORIES LTD.<br>
(b)	48, Kandivli Industrial Estate, Mumbai - 400 067, Maharashtra, India<br>
(c)	Indian Company incorporated under the Companies Act 1956<br>
	The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in<br>
	which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Technical field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to novel stable pharmaceutical compositions comprising a dihydropyridine class calcium channel blocker drug, such as amlodipine either racemic or its enantiomer or its salts and a synthetic beta selective adrenoreceptor blocker, bisoprolol fumarate. The said salts of amlodipine are besylate or maleate and the said enantiomer is s-isomer. This invention also relates to different processes for preparing the said stable pharmaceutical composition. Further the present invention relates to stable composition useful in certain cardiovascular diseases like hypertension, chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Amlodipine besylate is chemically described as 3-ethyl-5-methyl-2-(2-aminoethoxy methyl ) - 4- (2-chloro phenyl)- 1,4- dihydro - 6 -methyl- 3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate benzenesulphonate. Its empirical formula is: C20H25CIN2O5C6H6O3S. It inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscles and cardiac muscles. Therefore, is used for the treatment of angina and hypertension.<br>
Amlodipine besylate is commercially available as Norvasc (Pfizer) in the form of oral tablets in 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg base preparations.<br>
Amlodipine is well absorbed in gastrointestinal tract. After oral administration, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%. The bioavailability of amlodipine besylate is not altered by the presence of food. Plasma protein binding for Amlodipine is high in man corresponding to 97%. It is extensively converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism.<br>
Amlodipine besylate has good solubility, stability, non-hygroscopicity, processibility<br><br>
for tablet formulation. Due to a unique combination of good formulation properties, it is extremely suitable for the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations of Amlodipine.<br>
US patent application 2003220312 describes co-administration or sequential administration of two compounds for treating a variety of circulatory disorders including cardiovascular disorders, such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy. The first compound is characterized by a steroid-type nucleus with an epoxy moiety attached to the nucleus and having competitive aldosterone receptor binding activity. The second compound is a calcium channel blocker, preferably, amlodipine besylate. Administration may be accomplished by oral route, or by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injections. This combination has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy and safety with therapeutic benefit of the combination treatment over a mono-therapeutic regimen.<br>
Amlodipine is used in combination with statin compounds. This synergistic combination is useful for treating subjects suffering from angina pectoris, atherosclerosis, combined hypertension and hyperlipidemia and for subjects with symptoms of cardiac risk.<br>
Such pharmaceutical compositions of amlodipine and atorvastatin are described in patent CA2444554. The said patent also describes methods of preparing stable pharmaceutical compositions comprising atorvastatin and amlodipine, and a kit suitable for commercial sale.<br>
A beta blocker can also be combined with lipid lowering agent, where beta blocker can be bisoprolol, to get useful prevention of clinical events associated with the progression of atherosclerosis and/or acute vascular accidents related to atherosclerotic disease and plaque which is disclosed in patent application US 20030191177.<br>
US patent 6,670,355 discloses a novel method of treating cardiovascular disease. In accordance with this invention, rapamycin may be used as the sole active ingredient to<br><br>
provide the cardiovascular, cerebral, or peripheral vascular benefits. It can also be administered in combination with other agents. These other agents can be from various therapeutic classes having activity such as ACE inhibitors; angiotensin II receptor antagonists; fibric acid derivatives; HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors; beta adrenergic blocking agents; calcium channel blockers; antioxidants; anticoagulants; and agents useful in hormone replacement therapy containing estrogens. Rapamycin has been used in combination with amlodipine as well as bisoprolol, individually.<br>
Angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, plays an important role in a variety of normal processes. However, undesirable or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with a number of disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, etc.<br>
US patent application 20030144298 describes therapeutic combinations of antihypertensive and anti angiogenic agents in which, antihypertensive agent can be from calcium channel blocker group, beta blocker etc.<br>
Thus adrenergic blocking agents and calcium channel blocking agent are used in combination with various therapeutic agents to obtain desired effect. Combination of adrenergic blocking agents and calcium channel blocking agent is also very useful.<br>
US Patent 4,794,111 (Bayer) discloses a composition comprising a synergistically effective mixture of dihydropyridine adrenergic drugs selected from the group containing Nisolidipine, Nimodipine and Nitrenidipine and a blocker drug selected from the group containing Atenolol, Sotalol, Timolol and Nadolol.<br>
AU6767198 discloses pharmaceutical combination product of a beta -blocker drug atenolol with a calcium channel blocker drug-Amlodipine besylate. It is useful in conditions like Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and hypertension. This patent also discloses different processes for preparing such combination product.<br><br>
There are various patents like US6,350,398; US6,284,803; US6,120,802; US6,001,391 which describe innovative manufacturing processes which are useful in manufacturing of different dosage forms of various drugs including amlodipine or bisoprolol, but not the combined preparation of these two drugs. None of the above mentioned prior art disclose a stable combination of the two drugs amlodipine, either racemic or its enantiomer or its salts and bisoprolol fumarate and the process for preparation and pharmaceutical composition of the said combination.<br>
Thus there exists a need to introduce a stable pharmaceutical composition comprising a combination of amlodipine and bisoprolol.<br>
Objective<br>
The main objective of this invention is to develop novel stable pharmaceutical compositions of adrenergic blocking agent, preferably bisoprolol fumarate and calcium channel blocking agent, preferably amlodipine either racemic or its enantiomer or its salts to treat various cardiovascular diseases.<br>
Amlodipine besylate and bisoprolol fumarate both being acid addition salt may react with each other leading to chemical instability thus making it difficult to use conventional tabletting methods. Hence a further objective of the present invention is to develop a method to avoid the possibility of detrimental chemical reaction between these two drugs which will provide the said stable pharmaceutical composition.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel stable solid pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration comprising a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine; a synthetic betal - selective adrenoreceptor blocking agent, such as bisoprolol fumarate; and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients to the individuals suffering with certain cardiovascular ailments. The said amlodipine may be in the form of racemic mixture or<br><br>
S(-) isomer or its salts. The said salts are amlodipine besylate or maleate, preferably amlodipine besylate. The amount of the said amlodipine besylate is in the range of 3.0 to 15.0 mg equivalent to amlodipine free base, preferably 5 mg. The amount of the said bisoprolol fumarate is in the range of 2 to 15 mg, preferably 5 mg.<br>
The said pharmaceutical composition of amlodipine besylate and bisoprolol fumarate according to the invention is preferably in the solid dosage form, such as tablets, pills, granules, capsules or sachets, preferably tablets.<br>
The present invention further discloses different processes for preparing the said stable pharmaceutical composition of amlodipine besylate with bisoprolol fumarate.<br>
The term "amlodipine" used herein is intended to include amlodipine in racemic form or its enantiomer particularly s-enantiomer or its salts such as maleate, besylate, preferably besylate.<br>
