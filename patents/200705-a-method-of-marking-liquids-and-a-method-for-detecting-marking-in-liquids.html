Marking of liquids with at least two markers and detection thereof<br>
Specification<br>
The present invention relates to a method of marking liquids using at least two markers, wherein said markers absorb in the 600-1200 nm region of the spectrum and reemit fluorescent light and the absorption range of at least one marker overlaps with the absorption range of at least one other marker.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for detecting markers in liquids marked by the method of the invention, which comprises using light sources which emit radiation in the absorption ranges of said markers and detecting the fluorescent light reemitted by said markers, at least one of said light sources emitting radiation in the overlapping absorption range of at least one marker with that of at least one other marker and the number of light sources being less than or equal to the number of markers.<br>
The present invention further relates to liquids marked by the method of the invention-<br>
It is frequently necessary to mark, or tag, liquids to allow their subsequent detection, for example in use, by means of suitable methods. This makes it possible, for example, to differentiate heating oil, which normally enjoys a favorable tax status, from the generally more highly taxed diesel oil, or to tag liquid product streams in large industrial plants, for example petroleum refineries, and to trace them thereby.<br>
If the marking of the liquids is to be invisible to the human eye, it is necessary to resort to the use of markers which absorb and/or emit radiation outside the visible region of the spectrum. Owing to the extreme sensitivity of detection and the attendant possibility of achieving reliable marking with low levels of added marker, pride of place belongs here especially to markers which reemit the absorbed radiation as fluorescent light. This emitted radiation generally has a lower frequency than the absorbed radiation (STOKES radiation), less frequently the same frequency (resonance fluorescence) or even a higher frequency (ANTI-STOKES radiation).<br><br>
Great economic importance attaches to the barking of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon mixtures (e.g., various grades of diesel and gasoline motor fuels and of other mineral oils). Since these liquids usually themselves have high absorption and/or fluorescence in the region of the spectrum below about 600 nm, it is not surprising that the markers used absorb and/or fluoresce above about 600 nm-<br>
Ideally, compounds useful as markers should therefore possess the following basic properties:<br>
strong absorption in the 600-1200 nm region of the spectrum,<br>
little or no absorption/fluorescence in the visible region of the spectrum,<br>
strong emission of fluorescent light in the region of the spectrum which extends from about 600 to about 1200 nm,<br>
give detectable emission levels of fluorescence when added to the liquid in question at less than 1 ppm by weight, and<br>
adequate solubility in the liquid to be marked.<br>
In addition, depending on the specific application requirements, compounds useful as markers may have to satisfy one or more of the following requirements:<br>
miscibility with other markers and any other additives present (the marked and possibly additived liquids should also be miscible with each other),<br>
adequate stability to the action of external conditions, e.g., temperature, light, moisture, etc., alone and dissolved in the liquid to be marked,<br>
not be harmful to the environment in which they are used, e.g., internal combustion engines, storage tanks, etc., and<br>
be both toxicologically and ecologically safe.<br>
WO 94/02570 describes marking liquids by using markers having their absorption maximum within the range from 600 to 1200 nm and/or a fluorescence maximum within the range from 620 to 1200 nm selected from the group consisting of the metal-free and metal-containing phthalocyanines, the metal-free and metal-containing naphthalocyanines, the nickel-dithiolene complexes.<br><br>
the aminium compounds of aromatic amines, the tnetnme ayes and the azulenesquaric acid dyes. It further describes a method essentially comprising detecting the fluorescent light of the marker present in the liquid, which marker absorbs radiation in the stated region of the spectrum. The cited reference also describes a detector for the marker. However, the simultaneous use of two or more markers is not explicitly mentioned.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,525,516 likewise describes a method for marking mineral oils with compounds which fluoresce in the NIR region. Substituted phthalocyanines, substituted naphthalocyanines and squaric or croconic acid derivatives are used as such markers. This U.S. Patent states in the description part (column 3, lines 35 to 40) that it is also within the scope of the invention described therein to mark one or more mineral oils not just with one, but also with two or more compounds which fluoresce in the IR region. It is further stated in this passage that these two or more compounds are selected so that they absorb IR radiation and/or reemit fluorescent light at wavelengths different enough from each other so as not to interfere with individual detection. Using the (then) state of the art detection equipment it is believed (column 4, lines 25 to 28) that such differences in absorption/fluorescence of as little as 20 nm in wavelength can be discerned. This reference explicitly rules out using markers having overlapping'regions of absorption. What is more, it is pointed out (column 3, lines-41 to .44) that this or these fluorescent compound(s) should preferably absorb at wavelengths below 850 nm, since mineral oils absorb above this wavelength.<br>
 U.S. Patent 5,525,516 further claims a method for identifying mineral oils which have been marked with one or more markers. The marked mineral oil, or the markers incorporated therein, are exposed to electromagnetic radiation within the range (absorption range) of 670-850 nm. But beyond that no further information is provided as to how to proceed when mineral oils have been marked with more than one marker.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,710,046 describes a method for tagging gasoline, again essentially by detecting an essentially metal-free fluorescent dye dissolved in the gasoline. An appropriately tagged gasoline is excited with radiation from a wavelength band of 600 to 2500 nm, the fluorescent light emitted by the dye in the wavelength band from about 600 to 2500 nm is detected, and the resulting detection signal is used to identify the tagged sample. This reference further describes at length the construction of a detector for detecting the fluorescent dyes in<br><br>
the tagged gasoline samples. However, the use of a plurality of markers (dyes) is not discussed.<br>
If liquids, for example hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon mixtures (e.g., diesel and gasoline fuels and other mineral oils), from different sources or different manufacturers are to be marked, a multiplicity of different markers are required if only one marker is used per liquid. These different markers have to be sufficiently different in their absorption and/or fluorescence characteristics in order that the liquids may be identified with regard to their provenience and/or producer. Moreover, marking liquids with just one marker makes it easier for others to falsify unmarked liquids by adding the appropriate marker. This is of immense significance when chemically and qualitatively equivalent liquids carry different fiscal duties. An example are heating oil and diesel fuel.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to use two or more markers to mark liquids with a 'fingerprint" signature which is difficult to reproduce.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by a method of marking liquids using at least two markers, wherein<br>
said markers absorb in the 600-1200 nm region of the spectrum and reemit fluorescent light and<br>
the absorption range of at least one marker overlaps with the absorption range of at least one other marker.<br>
Preferably, markers are used whose respective maximum absorption wavelength is in the 600-1200 nm region of the spectrum.<br>
The use of two or more markers having an overlap between the absorption range of at least one marker and the absorption range of at least one further marker makes it possible, on the one hand, to use a larger number of markers within the wavelength range mentioned. More importantly, however, any compounds used by others in an attempt at fraudulent misrepresentation need to have not just similar absorption maxima to the original markers, but also similar characteristics to the latter in the rest of the absorption range as well.<br>
Let it be assumed, for example, that each fraudulent marker has only one, relatively narrow absorption maximum which corresponds to that of an original marker. Let it be further assumed that the original markers additionally have absorption ranges which<br><br>
overlap to some extent, i.e., that marking in the sense of the present invention has been effected. If, then, light sources are used which emit only in the regions of the absorption maxima, similar fluorescence spectra are likely in the two cases. If, however, light sources are used which emit at wavelengths at which the fraudulent markers have no absorption, but the original markers have overlapping absorption ranges, then fluorescent light emitted by these markers would be expected to be detected in the latter case but not in the former case.<br>
Another example. Let it be assumed that the absorption maximum of an original marker Ml is located in the region of absorption overlap between the absorption maximum of Ml and that of a further original marker M2. If, then, said markers Ml and M2 are each excited in their absorption maximum, then the fluorescent signal of Ml would be due only to its excitation, whereas the fluorescent signal of said marker M2 will have a component due to its individual excitation (in the absorption maximum of M2) and a further component which is due to the excitation of said marker Ml (in its absorption maximum and simultaneously in the region of absorption overlap between said markers Ml and M2). In contradistinction thereto, corresponding fraudulent markers without absorption ranges overlapping in such a way will on excitation in their absorption maxima exhibit only their respective, individual Jiuorescent signals. This will be discussed in greater detail later in this text.<br>
Preference is given in the method of the invention for marking liquids to using a combination of n markers, where n is an integer from 2 to 10, i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10.<br>

Liquids markable by the method of the invention using a combination of at least two of the above-identified compounds as markers are customarily organic liquids, for example<br>
alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, pentanol, isopentanol, neopentanol or hexanol.<br><br>
glycols, such as 1,2-ethylene glycol, 1,2- or 1,3-profiyiene glycol, 1,2-, 2,3- or 1,4-butylene glycol, di- or triethylene glycol or di- or tripropylene glycol,<br>
ethers, such as methyl tert-butyl ether, 1,2-ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, 1,2-ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, 1,2-ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, 1,2-ethylene glycol diethyl ether, 3-methoxypropanol, 3-isopropoxypropanol, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane,<br>
ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or diacetone alcohol,<br>
esters, such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate or butyl acetate,<br>
aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, isooctane, petroleum ether, toluene, xylene, ethyl benzene, tetralin, decalin, dimethylnaphthalene, white spirit,<br>
natural oils, such as olive oil, soybean oil or sunflower oil, or natural or synthetic engine, hydraulic or gear oils, for example .automotive vehicle engine oil or sewing machine oil, or brake fluids<br>
and mineral oils, such as gasoline, kerosine, diesel oil or heating oil.<br>
The abovementioned compounds are particularly useful for marking mineral oils where some form of identification is mandatory, for example for tax reasons- To keep the costs for this to a minimum+ but also to minimize possible interactions of the marked mineral oils with any other ingredients present, it is desirable to keep the amount of markers as small as possible. A further reason for keeping the amount of markers as small as possible can be to suppress their possible damaging effects, for example on the fuel intake and exhaust gas outlet region of internal combustion engines•<br>
As already mentioned above, it is generally desirable to mark liquids using marker compounds which produce a high fluorescence quantum yield, i.e., which reemit a large proportion of the absorbed quanta of radiation as fluorescence light quanta-<br>
These compounds to be used as markers are added to the liquids in such amounts that reliable detection is ensured. The<br><br>
(weight-based) total amount of markers in the marked liquid is usually within the range from about 0.1 to 5000 ppb, preferably within the range from 1 to 2000 ppb, particularly preferably within the range from 1 to 1000 ppb.<br>
To mark the liquids, the compounds identified above as markers, or, to be more precise, the combination of at least two markers, are generally added in the form of a (stock) solution. In the case of mineral oils especially, the solvents for preparing these stock solutions are preferably aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, xylene or higher boiling aromatic mixtures.<br>
To avoid such stock solutions having too high a viscosity (and hence poor meterability and handleability), the total concentration of markers is generally set within the range from 0.5 to 50% by weight, based on the total weight of these stock solutions.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for detecting markers in liquids marked by the method of the invention or its preferred embodiments, which comprises using light sources which emit radiation in the absorption ranges of said markers and detecting the fluorescent light reemitted by said markers, at least one of said light sources emitting radiation in the overlapping absqrp.tion ..range of at least one marker with, that of at least one other ,marker and the -number of light 'sources being less than or equal to the number of markers.<br>
The following definitions shall apply: the marker M+L'S wavelength range(s) wherein the extinction coefficient amounts to x% or more of the value at the absorption maximum of the marker M+ shall be designated "x% wavelength interval" L|J.(X). Since, for example, the number n of markers is in the preferred embodiments from 2 to 10 or from 2 to 6 or from 2 to 4, p. can accordingly assume integral numerical values from 1 to 10 or from 1 to 6 or from 1 to 4, respectively (corresponding respectively to the markers Ml, M2, M3,..., M9, MIO or Ml, M2, M3,...,M5, M6 or Ml, M2, M3, M4). The corresponding intervals are then respectively Ll(x), L2(x),..., L9(x), LlO(x) or Ll(x), L2(x),..., L5(x), L6(x) or Ll(x), L2(x), L3(x), L4(x). These intervals are generally connected, but can also be unconnected. For instance, a specific interval L|a(x) can also consist of two or more sub intervals, in which case their totality (union set) is then designated Lji(x).<br>
1 Depending on the markers and/or liquid to be marked, the value of X can be chosen individually or be used to "define" the absorption range of the marker M+i as a function of the specific<br><br>
requirements. In the case of high absorption by the liquid to be marked, for instance, values of, for example, 10, 20, 25 or even 50 can be sensible for x. Conversely, x values of, for example, 5 or 3 can be sufficient in the case of markers having high absorption power and/or liquids to be marked which have little if any absorption in the contemplated wavelength range. In accordance with these x values, for example, L3{10), L3(20) and L3(25) signify wavelength intervals in which the extinction coefficient of marker M3 is at least, respectively, 10%, 20% or 25% of the value at the absorption maximum of M3. Similarly, L3(5) and L3(3), for example, are used to define wavelength intervals in which the extinction coefficient of marker M3 is at least, respectively, 5% and 3% of the value at the absorption maximum of M3. It can even be sensible to use different x values within an ensemble of markers. For simplicity, L+-Cµ) (representing the x% interval of the marker M|A) is hereinbelow merely written as L+i.<br>
The definition of the intervals Lµ (x) of the various markers Mµ contemplated for marking according to the invention is further founded on their respective absorption spectra, determined under comparable conditions, that have been corrected with regard to the blank value of the solvent used in the-determination.<br>
In line with the above observations, the wavelength interval in which th4 absorption maximum of'marker Mµis positioned can likewise be designated as interval L[x(x) . In this case, x can then assume values of, for example, 80, 90, 95 or even 99, as required.<br>
The illustrative case of six different markers Ml, M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6, which corresponds to a preferred embodiment in which the number n of the markers assumes the value six, results in the intervals LI, L2, L3, L4, L5 and L6. The regions of overlap of the intervals are, in mathematical terms, their intersections and are herein accordingly designated as Ljxv. They can be systematically listed as:<br><br><br><br>
The number N of the possible regions of overlap between any two markers among a total of n markers generally works out as N = n/2 • (n-1). In the present case of n equal 6, therefore, the above-recited 15 overlapping intervals are obtained. It will be appreciated that the respective regions of overlap Ljiv (e.g., L34) are of course equivalent to the regions of overlap Lv\x  (e.g.# L43) and will therefore not be considered any further.<br>
According to the invenjbion, the absorption range of at leas't one marker shall overlap with the absorption range of at least one further marker. For the example of the six markers Ml to M6 this means that at least one of the 15 regions of overlap must be a non-empty set.<br>
The possibilities are as follows, for example:<br>
A)  All adjacent wavelength intervals L\x  and L([j.+ 1) form nonempty overlaps (intersections); all nonadjacent wavelength intervals Ljx and Lv (v &gt; (x + 1) have no "higher" overlaps (intersections), i.e., form empty sets in each case, viz:<br><br>
This means in the above, illustrative case that the only existing overlaps are L12, L23, L34, L45 and L56 (and, of course Lll, L22, L33, L44, L55 and L 66 equivalently to the intervals LI, L2, L3, L4, L5 and L6). All the other overlaps are empty sets. By using five light sources which emit in these regions of overlap, therefore, all six markers Ml to M6<br><br>
can be excited to reemit fluorescent light, in which case each light source excites two markers at one and the same time. In general, n-1 light sources which emit in the regions L12, L23,..., L(n-2)(n-l) and L(n-l)n will excite n markers Mµ. Furthermore, the markers Ml and Mµ (e.g., M6) will each have only a single region of overlap (L12 or L(n-l)n, e.g., L56), while the other markers (e.g. M2 to M5) will each have two regions of overlap (e.g., Mp. has the regions L(p,-l)p, and L^(!A+1)).<br>
B)  At least one marker M^i will have a wavelength interval LJJ, which intersects with the wavelength interval L(|a+2) of the marker M(n + 2) to form a "higher" overlap L(a(n+2). If this "higher" region of overlap overlaps with the wavelength interval L(|a.+ 1) of the marker M(|j-+1) which will generally be the case, this will produce a "triple" overlap L\i(\x-^1) (\i+2) of the intervals L\i,  L([i+1) and L((x+2) . By using a light source which emits in this region it is therefore possible to excite the markers Mjx, M(p,+ 1) and M(p,+2) simultaneously to reemit fluorescent light. In mathematical terms, this can be formulated as:<br><br>
In the above, illustrative case of six markers Ml to M6, this means that there is, for example, a region of overlap L13 which overlaps with the interval L2 (the overlap L22), i.e., forms intersection (LI Pi L3) D L2 = LI 0 L3 n L2 = LI n L2 n L3, which can be abbreviated, analogously to the above-introduced intersections of two intervals, as intersection L123 of three intervals (or generally as L|xva)) . It is further immediately apparent that:<br><br>
By using, for example, three light sources which emit in the overlaps L123, L45 and L56, all six markers Ml to M6 can be excited to reemit fluorescent light, with the light source a(L123) simultaneously exciting the markers Ml, M2 and M3 and the<br><br>
light source a(L45) and a(L56) simultaneously exciting-respectively the markers M4 and M5 on the one hand and M5 and M6 on the other.  Alternatively, it is also possible, in the latter case, to use a light source which emits, not in the region L56, but only, for example, in the region L66-L56, i.e., in the interval L6 minus the overlap (intersection) between L5 and L6. This will excite only marker M6, but not marker M5.<br>
If there is in addition an overlap L456, just two light sources, each emitting in the regions L123 and L456, respectively, will be sufficient to excite the fluorescent emissions of all six markers Ml to M6, with simultaneous excitation of the markers Ml, M2 and M3 on the one hand and M4, M5 and M6 on the other.<br>
In what follows, Mµ shall designate markers which do not overlap with each other, but which each have absorption maximum wavelengths comparable to the markers M|i..<br>
For a mixture corresponding to the above-discussed scenario A), i.e., a mixture of six markers Ml to M6 having the regions L12, L23, L34, L45 and L56 (and of course the regions Lll, L22, L33, L44, L55 and L66 equivalently to the intervals LI, L2, L3, L4, L5 and L6), excitation of all the markers dan be achieved with just-  • five suitable light sources (designated a(L|iv), i.e+ a(L12), a(L23), a(L34), a(L45) an+ a(L56))• In contrast, a mixture of six markers Ml", M2','M3', M4', M5' and M6' cannot be excited by the light sources a(L12) to a(L56) to reemit fluorescent light. Such a mixture corresponds to a mixture as suggested by the prior art, for example in U.S. Patent 5,525,516.<br>
The same is true of the above-discussed scenario B). Here a single light source a(L123) brings about an excitation of the markers Ml, M2 and M3. In the case of the markers Ml', M2' and M3' only the marker M2' will be excited if its absorption maximum wavelength is in the region L123. The markers Ml' and M3', however, would not be excited by such a light source to reemit fluorescent light.<br>
It is further possible, according to the invention, to mark liquids by using, for example, markers Ml to M6 which have overlaps L123, L34, L55 (= L5) and L66 (= L6), The light sources a(L123), a(L34), a(L55) and a(L66) will excite all the markers. In contrast, in the case of the markers Ml' to M6' these light sources will only bring about an excitation of the markers M5', M6' and perhaps M2', but not of the markers Ml', M3' and M4'.<br><br>
Furthermore, according to the invention, it-is possible, for example, to use a mixture of markers Ml and M2 which (by definition) has an overlap L12. If, for example, the wavelength interval of the absorption maximum of the marker Ml (this "main absorption range" can be defined as required for example as Ll(80), Ll(90), Ll(95) or Ll(99) (see above) falls within the region L12, then it is possible to use two light sources a(LI) and a(L2) which emit in the range of the respective absorption maxima (or the respective "main absorption ranges") of the markers Ml and M2 (e.g. Ll(80), Ll(90), Ll(95) or Ll(99) on the one hand and L2(80), L2(90), L2(95) or L2(99) on the other). The intensity of the fluorescence reemitted by Ml is determined completely by the intensity of radiation absorbed from the light source a(Ll). In contrast, the intensity of the fluorescent light reemitted by M2 results from the intensity of radiation absorbed by M2 from the light source a(L2) and the light source a(LI) in the region of overlap L12. In the case of a mixture of Ml' and M2', the respective intensity of the fluorescent light reemitted by Ml' or M2' is completely determined by the intensity of radiation absorbed from the light source a(Ll) and a(L2), respectively. Such a mixture of Ml' and M2' corresponds to a mixture as suggested by the prior art, for example in U.S. 5,525,516.<br>
It is further possible to use a mixture of markers corresponding t6 the scenarios A) and/or B) with such markers which have no regions of overlap with the other markers. As further protection" against fraudulent misrepresentation, it is also possible to perform the detection of the markers by detecting the fluorescent light excited by various, defined combinations of light sources-This is illustratively embodied hereinbelow without, however, implying any restriction of the invention.<br>
Example 1: The markers Ml to M4 have overlaps L12, L23 and L34. The wavelength intervals Ll(x), L2(x), L3(x) and L4(x) which accommodate the respective absorption maxima of the markers Ml to M4 (these "main absorption ranges" can be defined, for example, as L+(x) where x is, for example, 80, 90, 95 or 99(%), see above) have no overlap (intersection) with the regions L12, L23 and L34.<br>
Combination 1.1: The light sources a(Ll(x)), a(L2(x)), a(L3(x)) and a(L4(x)) are used. The markers reemit their respective fluorescent light. There is no combined excitation of fluorescence.<br>
 Combination 1.2: The light sources a(L12), a(L23) and a(L34) are used. The markers reemit their respective fluorescent light due to the combined excitation. a(Ll2) excites the markers Ml and M2,<br><br>
a(L23) the markers M2 and M3 and a(L34) the markers M3 and M4 to reemit fluorescence. If the markers Ml to M4 are excited simultaneously by the light sources, both the excitation due to a(L12) and a(L23) on the one hand and the excitation due to a(L23) and a(L34) on the other contribute to the intensity of fluorescence of marker M2 and M3, respectively. If the markers are excited by the light sources in succession, then the reemitted fluorescent light is obtained in the form of respective subspectra which show a fluorescent light intensity distribution due to the markers M2 and M3 which differs from the former case. These (three) sub-spectra, however, can be combined (arithmetically, for example, by means of appropriate computer programs) to form the overall spectrum of the former case- In the general case the intensity distribution of the fluorescent emissions of the markers Ml to M4 of the combination 1-2 (combined excitation) will differ from the intensity distributions of combination 1.1. The sequence of detection in accordance with combinations 1.1 and 1.2 therefore creates a "twofold fingerprint" for the marker mixture or the liquid comprising such a marker mixture. Of course, the light sources described in the combinations 1.1 and 1.2 can also be combined with one another.<br>
Example 2: The markers Ml to M4 have overlaps+L12, L23 and L34. The wavelength intervals Ll(x), L2(x), L3(x) and L4(x) which accommodate the respe.ctive absorption maxima of the markers Ml to M4 (t'hese' "main absorption ranges" can be defined, for example, as Lµ(x) where x is, for example, 80, 90, 95 or 99(%), see above) have overlaps (intersections) with the regions L12, L23 and L34, e.g., L12 n Ll(x) 9+  {0}, L23 fl L2(x) + {0}, L23 O L3(x) + {0} and L34 n L4(x) + {0}.<br>
Combination 2.1: The light sources a(Ll(x)), a{L2(x)), a(L3(x)) and a(L4(x)) are used. The markers reemit their respective fluorescent light due to the combined excitation. a(Ll(x)) excites the markers Ml and M2, a(L2(x)) and a(L3(x)) excite the markers M2 and M3 and a(L4(x)) excites the markers M3 and M4 to reemit fluorescent light.<br>
Combination 2,2: The light sources a(Ll(x)), a(L3(x)) and a(L4(x)) are used. The markers reemit their respective fluorescent light due to the combined excitation. a(Ll(x)) excites the markers Ml and M2, a(L3(x)) excites the markers M2 and M3 and a(L4(x)) excites the markers M3 and M4 to reemit fluorescent light. With regard to the simultaneous or successive excitation by the light sources, the remarks made in connection with combination 1.2 of Example 1 apply here, too. However, the<br><br>
intensity ratios differ from those arising out 6t  combination 2.1.<br>
combination 2.3: The light sources a(L12), a(L23) and a(L34) are used. The markers reemit their respective fluorescent light due to the combined excitation. a(L12) excites the markers Ml and M2, a(L23) the markers M2 and M3 and a(L34) the markers M3 and M4 to ceemit fluorescence. With regard to the simultaneous or successive excitation by the light sources, the remarks made in connection with combination 1.2 of Example 1 apply here, too. In the general case, the intensity distribution of the fluorescent emissions of the markers Ml to M4 of the combination 2.3 will differ from the intensity distributions of combinations 2.1 and 2.2, The sequence of detection in accordance with combinations 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 therefore creates a "triple fingerprint" for the marker mixture or the liquid comprising such a marker mixture. Of course, the light sources described in the combinations 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 can also be combined with one another.<br>
To mark liquids according to the present invention, it is also possible, as will be appreciated, to use combinations of markers which differ in the relative amounts of the markers. For instance, a liquid can be marked with a mixture of the markers'. Ml to M4 in a molar ratio of M1:M2:M3:M4 = 1:1:1:1, while another liquid can be marked with a mixture in a ratio of, for example, 2:1:1:1, 4:l:l:l", 8:1:1:1, 2:2:1:1, 2:4:1:1, 2:8:1:1, 4:4:1:1, 4:8:1:1, 8:8:1:1, 2:2:2:1, 2:2:4:1, 2:2:8:1, 2:2:2:2, 2:2:2:4, 2:2:2:8 or else in the ratio of an appropriate permutation thereof.<br>
If the intention is to mark different liquids only with different concentrations of a fixed mixture of markers (e.g,. Ml to M4), the respective concentration will usually be chosen so that it differs from liquid to liquid by at least a factor of two so that the unambiguity of detection may be safeguarded. However,- it is preferable to mark different liquids by using marker mixtures of different molar ratios of the markers relative to one another.<br>
The basic construction for exciting and detecting fluorescence in a liquid marked according to the invention comprises:<br>
a sample cuvette which contains the marked liquid,<br>
an excitation unit (A) comprising:<br>
a1) a light source, usually equipped with collimator optics, and<br><br>
a2) usually a plane mirror which is positioned opposite to the light source on that side of the sample cuvette which is remote from the light source, and reflects the transmitted radiation to increase the intensity irradiated into the sample,<br>
a detection unit (D) comprising:<br>
61)	a photodetector (usually provided with collimator optics) in front of which there are usually positioned optical filters (e.g., cutoff or interference filters) and optionally NIR polarizers and which is disposed in such a way that the fluorescent light reemitted in its direction is incident (or imaged) thereon and detected, and<br>
62)	usually a concave mirror which is positioned opposite the photodetector on that side of the sample cuvette which is remote from the photodetector, and reflects the fluorescent light reemitted in the opposite direction (away from the photodetector) and hence serves to enhance the sensitivity of detection.<br>
Such a construction is illustrated in.principle in WO 94/02570 (differing with regard to the irradiating direction of the light .source)* The fluorescent light need not be detected perpen-diculally, but can be detected at virtually any,desired angle with regard to the radiating direction. It is sensible, however, not to contemplate the angles of 0° and 180°.<br>
The observations hereinbelow will operate with the following definitions:<br>
Excitation and detection units in the general sense are designated, respectively, as A and D (see above). Markers in the general sense are designated M.<br>
An excitation unit adjusted by means of an appropriate light source to specifically the wavelength interval Lµ (synonymously with the "overlap" L+|x or L+µµµ, the overlap L+iv or the overlap Lµivto (i.e., the light source emits radiation in wavelength interval L\x  of marker Mfx, in the region of overlap between markers Mµ and Mv or in the region of overlap between markers M+i, Mv and Mo) ) is uniformly referred to as A(L|a.va)) or shorter Afivw, or various such units are referred to as A+ivico],... ,A+µnWn/ where, for example, for n equal 2 to 10 or 2 to 6 or 2 to 4 the parameters +i, v, and o (or M-µ1-+-zM-n/ vi,...,Vn and a)i,...,a&gt;n) can each assume values of, respectively, 1 to 10, 1 to 6 and 1 to 4.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
II) in different sample volumes.<br>
In case I), the following methods and illustrative constructions for the detection equipment can be used (here n is for example from 2 to 10 or from 2 to 6 or from 2 to 4):<br>
I.l)     Amvia)i/Dl,A|X2V2a32/D2, . - . , A(in-lVn-lWn-l/Dn-l, AUnVn+On/Dn (the n markers H\i  are each excited in the overlaps Ljxvo) by their corresponding units A[xva) and the fluorescent emissions of the markers Mp, are each detected by the units D|x).<br>
a)	The construction corresponds essentially to the construction mentioned at the beginning and illustrated in WO 94/02570. The difference is that appropriate units Ajavco and D+x are used for each marker Mjx. This can take the form of a spatially offset arrangement of a plurality (equal to the number of markers to be detected) of pairs of units A+vo) and D\x  radially around the sample cuvette. The latter then preferably has a circular cross section. The sample volumes (or sample paths) irradiated by the units Anyco are strictly not identical, however. But the excitation rays (lying in one plane) intersect in a common piece of ,the sample volume. A plurality of units" A+ivco can (and generally are) identical. For instance, in the case of three markers Ml to M3 (e.g., with the overlaps L12 and L23) the appropriate (three) pairs A12/D1, A12/D2 and A23/D3 or else A12/D1, A23/D2 and A23/D3 can be used for excitation and detection. The combination of excitation and detection of the n markers Mjx can take place not only in succession but also simultaneously.<br>
b)	The construction corresponds essentially to the construction mentioned at the beginning and illustrated in WO 94/02570. The difference is that the light sources ai+ivu) and photodetectors bi\x  of the units A+vco and D[x are each positioned on appropriate carousels (in place of individual plane mirrors a2M.va) and concave mirrors 82(x it is sensible in this case to use in each case only one fixed plane or concave mirror) . To detect the marker Mji, the corresponding light source ai|j,vo) and the corresponding photodetector bi\i  are moved into the excitation and detection position, respectively, by rotation of the respective carousels. The ray trajectory through the<br><br>
marked sample and the irradiated sample volume are identical for each marker to be determined. The combination of excitation and detection of the n markers Mµ can only take place in succession.<br>
c)  By using, for example, a cylindrical sample cuvette which can be sealed at either or both ends with windows made of the same material as the cuvette or which is sealed at both ends and preferably has lateral sample inlets and outlets, it is possible to arrive at a modified construction. Similarly to the description under a), the light sources 1αµvω of the units Afµvω can be positioned on a carousel (in which case it is sensible to use only one fixed plane mirror instead of individual plane mirrors a2Hva)). The respective unit Ajavo) then irradiates the sample parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cuvette. The respective units Dµ  (this time of course with their respective subunits 62M.va)) can be placed radially thereto (and hence always perpendicularly to the radiation direc- tion of the excitation light) around the sample cuvette to detect the fluorescent light reemitted in each case. The combination of excitation and detec- tion of the n markers Mµ can only take place in succession (potentially, of course, the "fl.uorescent +14.ght reemitted simultaneousry by a plurality of markers can be detected simultaneously by the units Dµ).<br>
A/Dl,A/D2, . . . ,A/Dn-1,A/Dn (all n markers Mµ are simultaneously excited by a "polychromatic" light source and detected by means of their respective detection channel Dµ) .<br>
a)	The construction can be similar to that described in b) under I.l). However, instead of an appropriate carousel for the subunits a1µvω only one polychromatic excitation unit A is used. Detection is effected in accordance with the construction described under b) of I.l). The combination of excitation and detection of the n markers Mµ can only take place in succession.<br>
b)	If, in line with the construction described in c) under I.l), a cylindrical sample cuvette is used, for example, then the unit A will irradiate the sample parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cuvette. The<br><br>
respective units Dµ  can again be placed radiatly thereto (hence perpendicular to the radiating direction of the excitation light) around the sample cuvette. The combination of excitation and detection of the n markers Mµ can take place both in succession and simultaneously.<br><br>
a)	The construction can be similar to that described in<br>
b) under I.l). However, instead of an appropriate<br>
carousel for the photodetectors bµ  only one<br>
detection unit D, for example a multiwavelength<br>
detector is used. Excitation is effected in<br>
accordance with the construction described under b)<br>
of I.l). The combination of excitation and detection<br>
of the n markers Mµ can only take place in<br>
succession.<br>
b)	If, in line with the construction described in c)<br>
under I.l), a cylindrical sample cuvette is used, for<br>
example, .then the unit D detects the reemitted<br>
flu'orescerit light parallel to the longitudinal axis<br>
of the cuvette. The respective units Afxvo) (together<br>
with their corresponding plane mirrors a2µvω) can be<br>
placed radially thereto (hence perpendicular to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the cuvette) around the sample<br>
cuvette. The combination of excitation and detection<br>
of the n markers Mµ can take place both in succession<br>
and simultaneously.<br><br><br><br><br>
reemitted fluorescent light is parsed for example (case a2) by means of optical fibers or optical fiber bundles. Excitation takes place in accordance with the construction described under b) of I.l). The combination of excitation and detection of the n markers M|x can only take place in succession.<br>
b)  If, in line with the construction described in c)<br>
under I.l), a cylindrical sample cuvette is used, for example, a unit D described under a) (case ai or case a2) will detect the fluorescent light reemitted in each case parallel to the longi- tudinal axis of the cuvette. The respective units A^IUCD can again be placed radially thereto (and hence in each case perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the cuvette) around the sample cuvette. Using the unit D corresponding to case ai, a combi- nation of excitation and detection of the n markers Mµ can only take place in succession. Using a unit D corresponding to a2, the combination of excitation and detection of the n markers Mµ can take place in succession and potentially also simultaneously.<br><br>
The construction can be effected using an excitation unit A which for example (case a1) contains interchangeable light sources ai(xva) or light sources aijxaivo) whose respective radiation is for example (case a2) directed by means of optical fibers or optical fiber bundles or collinear superposition of the individual rays of the light sources by means of optical elements for example beam splitters, dichroic beam splitters, diaphragms, etc., in such a way that the radiation enters the sample cuvette in each case at the same location thereof. It is accordingly possible to use a detection unit D which contains for example (case a1) interchangeable photo-detectors and/or interchangeable optical filters (and optionally polarizers) δ1µ or else a plurality of photodetectors δ1µ to which the respective reemitted fluorescent light is for example passed (case a2) by means of optical fibers or optical fiber bundles. For the cases A(case a1)/D(case a1), A(case a1)/D(case a2) and A(case a2)/D(case a1) the combination of excitation and detection of the n markers Mµ can only take place in<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
a)	The arrangement of the units Ajivco can be fashioned in<br>
accordance with the directions given under II.1). If<br>
the units AJJ-VO) are arranged in a row (case ai), the<br>
unit D can be fixedly mounted in the appropriate<br>
X-position, provided its radiation inlet window is<br>
sufficiently large or appropriate imaging optics are<br>
used. Otherwise (case a2) a (translationally)<br>
readjustment into the appropriate position has to<br>
take place. In the case of the other arrangements of<br>
the units Aµvω) (case aω) a (translational and<br>
rotational) readjustment of the unit D into the<br>
corresponding x-positions has to take place. Thus, in<br>
case a1, the combination of excitation and detection<br>
of the n markers Mµ can take place not only simul<br>
taneously but also in succession, but only in<br>
succession in cases a2 and a3.<br>
b)	In principle an arrangement "along the "lines of b)<br>
under point 1.3) is also possible; that is, the'<br>
optical axis of unit D is parallel to the<br>
longitudinal axis of a cylindrical sample cuvette,<br>
and the units Afivo are arranged in accordance with<br>
the directions given under II.l). However, this will<br>
result in different path lengths which have to be<br>
traveled through the sample by the fluorescent light<br>
reemitted by the respective markers Mµ on its way to<br>
the unit D, and different solid angles at which the<br>
fluorescent light will fall on the unit D (or, to be<br>
more precise, its detection window). This can lead to<br>
inaccuracies in the detected intensities or has to be<br>
taken into account appropriately in the evaluations.<br>
In principle, however, in these arrangements, the<br>
combination of excitation and detection of the n<br>
markers Mµ can take place not only simultaneously but<br>
also in succession.<br><br><br>
overlap Lp,va) by the corresponding units+'AfA\(03 and detected).<br>
a)	The arrangements correspond essentially to those recited in a) under point II.2). Instead of one unit D (e.g., a multiwavelength detector), however, there is used a detection unit which for example (case ai) contains interchangeable photodetectors and/or interchangeable optical filters (and optionally polarizers) 8x|i. Furthermore, however, D can also contain a plurality of photodetectors 5i|i. to which the respective reemitted fluorescent light is for example directed (case 32) by means of optical fibers or optical fiber bundles. With a unit D corresponding to case ai, the combination of excitation and detection of the n markers HyL  can only take place in succession, since there will be a need to change the subunits 6ip, and optionally also for a (translational or translational and rotational) readjustment of the unit D. With a unit D corresponding to case a2f the combination of excitation and detection of the n markers H\x  can be carried out in succession and potentially also (given a suitable arrangement of the units Aµvω) simultaneously if, for example through suitable optical facilities, a bundling (e.g., by means of an optical lens) of the fluorescent light simultaneously reemitted by the markers M+ onto the optical fibers or fiber bundles takes place.<br>
b)	The arrangements correspond essentially to those recited in b) under point II.2). Instead of one unit D (e.g., a multiwavelength detector), however, there is used again a detection unit which for example (case a1) contains interchangeable photodetectors and/or inter- changeable optical filters (and optionally polarizers) Sµ.. Furthermore, however, D can also contain a plurality of photodetectors Sxtx to which the respective reemitted fluorescent light is for example directed (case a2) by means of optical fibers or optical fiber bundles. With a unit D corresponding to case ai, the combination of excitation and detection of the n markers yi\x  can only take place in succession. With a unit D corresponding to case a2, the combination of excitation and detection of the n markers M+i can be carried out in succession and potentially also simultaneously. The observations in b) under II.2) concerning the<br><br><br>
customarily detected using the lock-in method.<br><br>
A preferred embodiment of the inventive method or detecting Tiarkers in liquids which have been marked according to the method of the invention comprises the chronologically successive excitation of the n markers Mµ by their corresponding units Aµvco in the same sample volume and the (chronologically successive) detection of the fluorescent light reemitted by each Mµ-<br><br><br>
wavelength of the absorption maximum of the respective markers Mu. These maximum emissions are then generally within the corres-<br><br>
On excitation of A with a 685 nm laser and of B'with a 754 nm laser, the fluorescent signal from B is made up of a component which is due to excitation of B by the 685 nm laser and a component due to excitation of B by the 754 nm laser.<br>
On using A and a (fraudulent) marker B', which has no region of overlap with A, and excitation of A with a 685 nm laser and of B' with a 754 nm laser, the fluorescent signal measured in the fluorescent region of B' would be smaller by the amount of the absent excitation of B' by the 685 nm laser.<br>
Furthermore, to make doubly sure of the identity of the marker mixture of A and B (or, to be precise, of the marked liquid), it is possible, on the one hand, to determine the overall intensity of the fluorescent light passing through appropriate filters in the fluorescent regions of markers A and B, on simultaneous excitation, and, on the other, determine the individual intensities on excitation with the one laser and excitation with the other laser. These three measurements together form a (possible) unique fingerprint-<br>
Example 2:<br>
A mixture of 0.5 ppm of B (PcH2-(3'-methylpiperidino)4) and O.S.ppm.. of C (NcH2"(OC4H9')-8) is dissolved in unleaded gasoline motor fuel (RON'95) -'NcH2 being the naphthA10cyanine system where Me+ (formula II) is two hydrogens and all the pairs Y+ and Y+, Y+ and Y4, Y5 and Y+ and also Y+ and Y+ in the formula II are OC4H9,<br>
The absorption spectra of the markers B and C have the absorbances (in arbitrary units) recited in Table 2 at the wavelengths of 754 and 855 nm of the lasers used:<br><br>
It can be seen that excitation of B with a 754 nm laser will also excite C at the same time, albeit to a lesser extent.<br>
On excitation of B with a 754 nm laser and of C with an 855 nm laser, the fluorescent signal from C is made up of a component which is due to excitation of C by the 754 nm laser and a component due to excitation of C by the 855 nm laser.<br><br>
On using B and a (fraudulent) marker C+ which has no+ region of overlap with B, and excitation of B with a 754 nm laser and of C with an 855 nm laser, the fluorescent signal measured in the fluorescent region of C would be smaller by the amount of the absent excitation of C by the 754 nm laser.<br>
Furthermore, to make doubly sure of the identity of the marker mixture of B and C, it is possible to determine the fluorescent signals in simultaneous and individual excitation, as carred out earlier, in Example 1.<br>
Example 3:<br>
A mixture of 0,5 ppm each of compounds A, B and C is dissolved in unleaded gasoline motor fuel (RON 95) and simultaneously excited with 3 lasers at 685, 754 and 855 nm. The resulting fluorescent light is filtered through three bandpass filters (transmitted wavelengths at 720, 790 and 860 nm) and detected with the aid of a silicon pin diode. The fluorescence intensities recited in Table 3 are obtained (arbitrary units):<br><br>
Example 4:<br>
A mixture of 2/9 (0-22) ppm of compound A, 8/9 (0.88) ppm of compound B and 8/9 (0.88) ppm of compound C is dissolved in unleaded gasoline motor fuel (RON 95) and simultaneously excited with 3 lasers at 685, 754 and 855 nm. The resulting fluorescent light is filtered through three bandpass filters (transmitted wavelengths at 720, 790 and 860 nm) and detected with the aid of a silicon pin diode. The fluorescence intensities recited in Table 4 are obtained (arbitrary units):<br><br><br>
It is clear from Examples 3 and 4 that (given appropriate calibration) it is possible to distinguish different relative ratios of the markers and also different absolute amounts of the markers through the intensities of their fluorescent signals.<br><br><br><br>
