PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the sustained-release pharmaceutical<br>
compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Peptides are generally administered parenterally, e.g., by subcutaneous<br>
injection, since they are often degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. Many<br>
peptide treatments (e.g., insulin, LHRH, and somatostatin) require either the<br>
continuous or repeated administration of the peptide in the patient over an<br>
extended period of time. However, such continual injections cause both<br>
inconvenience and discomfort to the patient.<br>
Sustained-release formulations have been developed to deliver peptides<br>
over prolonged periods of time without the need for repeated injections. Solid<br>
polymeric microcapsules and matrixes, for example, utilizing biodegradable<br>
polylactic polymers, have been developed. See e.g., Hutchinson,tJ.S. Fat. No.<br>
4,767,628 and Kent, et aL, U.S. Pat No. 4,675,189. Hydrogels have also been<br>
used as sustained-release formulations for peptides. These hydrogels comprise<br>
polymers such as poly-N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPA), cellulose ether,<br>
hyaluronic acid, lecithin, and agarose to control the delivery. See, e.g., PCT<br>
Applications WO 94/08623.<br>
Some peptides have been reported to form soluble aggregates or<br>
insoluble particulates once mixed into a solution. See, Eckhardt, et al., Pharm.<br>
mps., 8:1360 (1991). Others have studied the possibility of utilizing these<br>
peptide aggregates as sustained-release formulations. See European Patent<br>
Application 0510913 A2 (1992); and Wan, et al., Pharmaceutical Research,<br>
Vol. 11,10 Suppl., abstracts P. S291 and P. S243 (1994). However, these<br>
aggregate sustained-release compositions require that the peptide be dissolved<br>
in saline or biologically compatible buffers, and then incubated until a liquid<br>
crystalline gel structure is formed.<br>
Elsewhere it has been reported that certain soluble peptide salts can be<br>
formulated as sustained-release gel formulations without the addition of a<br>
biodegradable polymer or other carrier matrix to control the peptide"s release<br>
profile. See Cherif-Cheikh, U.S. Patent 5,595,760.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which<br>
automatically form a sustained-release gel within a patient without the need for<br>
any extemporaneous dissolution or incubation of the composition. The<br>
invention is based on the discovery that certain soluble peptides or salts thereof<br>
can themselves serve as sustained-release carriers to control not only the<br>
peptide"s own release profile but also the release profile of one or more<br>
therapeutic agents. The new compositions formed with such "carrier peptides"<br>
automatically gel upon interaction with a patient"s bodily fluids and then<br>
release both the peptide and the therapeutic agent or agents over an extended<br>
period of time. The new compositions thus reduce the volume, cost, and<br>
manufacturing time of known sustained-release polymer-based formulations.<br>
In general, the invention features a method of administering a carrier<br>
peptide and a therapeutic agent or agents to a patient and delivering the carrier<br>
peptide and therapeutic agent or agents continuously over an extended period<br>
of time. The method comprises obtaining a solid pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a carrier peptide, i.e., a soluble, gelable peptide or salt of the<br>
peptide, and a therapeutic agent or agents and parenterally administering the<br>
solid composition to the patient by injection, e.g., intramuscular, subcutaneous,<br>
intradermal, or intraperitoneal, wherein the solid composition automatically<br>
forms a gel after interaction with the patient"s bodily fluids and releases the<br>
carrier peptide and the therapeutic agent or agents continuously within the<br>
patient over an extended period.<br>
One preferred group of therapeutic agents that may be included in a<br>
composition of the invention are dopamine agonists or antagonists, and their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Preferred compounds from this group<br>
include, e.g., amantadine, bromocriptine, cabergoline, lisuride, mesulefgine,<br>
pergolide, pramipexole, quinagolide, and ropinirole, and their pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts and analogs thereof. A particularly preferred compound from<br>
among this group is cabergoline and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
The compositions of the present invention advantageously allow for the<br>
administration of soluble and non-soluble therapeutic agents to a subject, e.g.,<br>
over an extended period of time. Further, a composition of the present<br>
invention, e.g., as might contain a compound with poor solubility, gel or<br>
aggregation properties, may be manufactured so as to avoid undesirable<br>
solvents, temperatures, shear-stresses, and other undesirable conditions, i.e.,<br>
conditions likely to destabilize molecules.<br>
In one aspect the carrier peptide and the therapeutic agent or agents are<br>
released over a period of at least three days, preferably at least 7 days, more<br>
preferably at least 14 days, more preferably still at least 30 days.<br>
In another aspect the carrier peptide itself is a therapeutic agent; i.e., is<br>
itself biologically active. In another embodiment the carrier peptide is itself<br>
essentially biologically inactive.<br>
A by no means exhaustive nor limiting list of the types of peptides<br>
suitable for use as a carrier peptide in the invention include growth hormone<br>
(GH), growth hormone releasing peptide (GHRP), growth hormone releasing<br>
factor (GRF), epidermal growth factor, interferon, insulin, somatostatin,<br>
bombesin, calcitonin, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), amylin,<br>
parathyroid hormone (PTH), parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrp),<br>
gastrin, gastrin releasing peptide (GRP), melanocyte stimulating hormone<br>
(MSH), adrenocorticotrophic honnone (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (Lit),<br>
luteinizing hormone-releasing honnone (LHRH), cytokinases, sorbine,<br>
cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon, glucagon-like peptide (GLP), gastrin,<br>
enkephalin, neuromedin, endothelin, substance P, neuropeptide Y (NPY),<br>
peptide YY (PYY), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), pituitary adenylate<br>
cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), bradykinin, thyrotropin releasing<br>
hormone (TRH), beta-cell tropin (a fragment of ACTH), or biologically active<br>
or inactive analogs of any of the foregoing.<br>
Preferred soluble, gelable carrier peptide salts according to the invention<br>
include salts of somatostatin and analogs such as SOMATULINE (Kinerton,<br>
Ltd., Dublin, Ireland; see, e.g., Johnson et al., Eur. J. Endocrinol. 130:229-34,<br>
1994), salts of calcitonin and its analogs, salts of LHRH analogs such as the<br>
antagonist GANIRELIX, (GRX; see, e.g., Nestor et al., J. Med. Chem.,<br>
35(21):3942-3948,1992), and salts of GH, GRF, PTH, PTHrp, and biologically<br>
active or inactive analogs thereof.<br>
Examples of preferred salts are those with therapeutically acceptable<br>
organic acids (e.g., acetic, lactic, maleic, citric, malic, ascorbic, succinic,<br>
benzoic, methanesulfonic, or toluenesulfonic, and salts with inorganic acids<br>
such as the hydrohalic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid), sulfuric acid, or<br>
phosphoric acid.<br>
The gelable carrier peptides of the invention can be compounded with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable, monomeric, soluble carrier for ease of<br>
manufacture and/or administration. Examples of carriers include polyalcohols<br>
such as mannitol and sorbitol, sugars such as glucose and lactose, surfactants,<br>
organic solvents, and polysaccharides. Thus in another aspect the composition<br>
of the invention further comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable, soluble,<br>
monomeric carrier, e.g., mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, and the like, said<br>
monomeric carrier preferably being present in an amount of up to 30 percent by<br>
weight of the dry weight of said composition.<br>
Solid compositions of the invention can be manufactured in the form of<br>
a cylinder with a diameter of less than 3 mm, and preferably less than 2 mm,<br>
for administration by standard trocar.<br>
A semisolid suspension can also be used in the method of the invention.<br>
The terms "semisolid suspension" and "semisolid composition" are used<br>
interchangeably herein to refer to viscous, paste-like suspensions of a carrier<br>
peptide and a therapeutic agent or agents in a liquid solvent, such as sterilized<br>
water. A semisolid suspension according to the invention includes (1) a solid,<br>
soluble, carrier peptide, a therapeutic agent or agents, and up to 30 percent by<br>
weight of a pharmaceuticalry acceptable, soluble carrier; and (2) a solvent, e.g.,<br>
an aqueous solvent like sterilized water, in an amount less than 50 percent, and<br>
preferably 20 or 10 percent, of the amount of solvent required to dissolve the<br>
peptide salt or any therapeutic agent or agents, to provide the semisolid<br>
consistency. The suspension may also be parenterally administered to the<br>
patient in one injection, and automatically forms a gel after interaction with the<br>
patient"s bodily fluids.<br>
The invention further features a sustained-release gel formed within a<br>
patient. The gel is made of (1) a pharmaceutical composition including a carrier<br>
peptide or carrier peptide salt, i.e., a soluble, gelable peptide or peptide salt, a<br>
therapeutic agent or agents, and up to 30 percent, by weight, of a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable, soluble carrier, and (2) one or more bodily fluids<br>
of the patient, wherein the carrier peptide or peptide salt automatically forms<br>
the gel after interaction with the bodily fluids, and the gel releases the carrier<br>
peptide and the therapeutic agent or agents continuously within the patient over<br>
an extended period of time, preferably for at least three days after formation,<br>
more preferably for at least seven days, more preferably for at least 14 days,<br>
more preferably still for at least 30 days. The pharmaceutical composition that<br>
forms the gel can be a solid, or it can further include a solvent, e.g., sterilized<br>
water, in an amount less than 50 percent of the amount of solvent required to<br>
dissolve the carrier peptide or peptide salt or the therapeutic agent or agents,<br>
and to provide the pharmaceutical composition with a semisolid consistency.<br>
In addition, the invention features a solid, non-particulate, sustained-<br>
release pharmaceutical composition for parenteral administration to a patient.<br>
This composition-comprises (1) a soluble, gelable peptide or peptide salt (i.e., a<br>
carrier peptide or salt thereof), and a therapeutic agent or agents and (2) up to<br>
30 percent, by weight, of a pharmaceutically acceptable, monomeric, soluble<br>
carrier, compounded into a solid cylindrical form, wherein the solid<br>
composition automatically forms a gel after interaction with the patient"s bodily<br>
fluids, and releases the peptide continuously within the patient over an<br>
extended period time. Preferably the gel releases the carrier peptide and<br>
therapeutic agent or agents for at least three days after formation, more<br>
preferably at least seven days, more preferably at least 14 days, more<br>
preferably still at least 30 days.<br>
The invention also features a semisolid, sustained-release<br>
pharmaceutical suspension for parenteral administration to a patient. This<br>
suspension consists essentially of (1) a soluble, gelable peptide salt (i.e., a<br>
carrier peptide or salt thereof), a therapeutic agent or agents, and up to 30<br>
percent, by weight, of a pharmaceutically acceptable, soluble carrier; and (2) a<br>
solvent in an amount less than 50 percent, and preferably 20 or 10 percent, of<br>
the amount of solvent required to dissolve the carrier peptide or salt thereof or<br>
the therapeutic agent or agents and to provide the semisolid consistency of the<br>
suspension, wherein the semisolid suspension automatically forms a gel after<br>
interaction with the patient"s bodily fluids and releases the carrier peptide and<br>
therapeutic agent or agents continuously within the patient over an extended<br>
period. Preferably the gel releases the carrier peptide and therapeutic agent or<br>
agents for at least three days after formation, more preferably at least seven<br>
days, more preferably at least 14 days, more preferably still at least 30 days.<br>
In another aspect, the invention features a method of making a solid<br>
pharmaceutical composition by a) mixing a soluble, gelable peptide salt (i.e., a<br>
carrier peptide or salt thereof), a therapeutic agent or agents, and up to 30<br>
percent, by weight, of a pharmaceutically acceptable, soluble carrier to form a<br>
mixture; b) compounding the mixture with a liquid vehicle to form a semisolid<br>
formulation; c) extruding the semisolid formulation to form an elongated<br>
filament; d) cutting the elongated filament into semisolid cylindrical rods; and<br>
e) drying the semisolid rods to form solid cylindrical rods. Preferably, the solid<br>
rods have a diameter of less than 2 or 3 mm.<br>
The term "peptide" means a natural or synthetic molecule comprising<br>
two or more amino acids linked by the carboxyl group of one amino acid and<br>
the amino group of another. Thus, the term includes both polypeptides and<br>
proteins. A "soluble" peptide or peptide salt is one having a solubility of 0.1<br>
mg/ml, and preferably 1.0 mg/ml, in water at a pH of 7.0 and a temperature of<br>
25 degrees C.<br>
As used herein, the term "carrier peptide" refers to a gelable peptide or<br>
gelable peptide salt, i.e., a peptide or peptide salt which will form a gel upon<br>
contact with bodily fluids. The carrier peptide is preferably soluble in water, as<br>
herein defined. Whether a peptide or peptide salt is gelable and will have the<br>
desired biological properties can be determined by testing the peptide or<br>
peptide salt in one or more of the in vitro and/or in vivo assays described<br>
below.<br>
The term "analog" is used herein to cover any naturally occurring,<br>
recombinant, or synthetically synthesized peptide or non-peptide compound, or<br>
derivatives or fragments thereof, which compound may be biologically active<br>
or biologically inactive. By way of example in respect of, e.g., a naturally<br>
occurring peptide, the term would include, without limitation, peptides in<br>
which one or more of the N- or C- terminal group or side chain has been<br>
structurally modified, and/or in which one or more non-peptide or<br>
pseudopeptide bond has been included, and/or in which one or more amide<br>
nitrogen has had a substituent attached thereto.<br>
The term "biologically active analog" is used herein to cover any analog<br>
that exhibits an agonist or antagonist effect relative to the corresponding<br>
unmodified or naturally occurring peptide or non-peptide compound.<br>
Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein<br>
have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or<br>
equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the<br>
present invention, the preferred methods and materials are described below. All<br>
publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned<br>
herein are incorporated by reference, each in its entirety. In addition, the<br>
materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be<br>
limiting.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the<br>
detailed description, and from the claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions, e.g., solid<br>
cylinders or semisolid suspensions, that automatically form sustained-release<br>
gels once administered to a patient. As is well known in the art, syringe and<br>
syringe-like devices may be used to administer semisolid suspensions while<br>
trocars and trocar-like devices may be used to administer solid compositions.<br>
Each unit of the new compositions will contain at least me daily dose of<br>
the desired therapeutic agent or agents multiplied by the desired number of<br>
days of activity. After the composition automatically gels upon contact with<br>
bodily fluids, the carrier peptide and the therapeutic agent or agents are<br>
delivered from the gel according to a blood level profiles that are comparable<br>
to the blood level profiles of the carrier peptide and the therapeutic agent or<br>
agents when administered by continuous daily injection, by known sustained-<br>
release compositions, e.g., polymeric peptide formulations, or by an infusion<br>
pump operating under a steady mode of delivery.<br>
Peptides Suitable for Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Peptides or the salt forms thereof that can be used as carrier peptides in<br>
the compositions of the invention form a gel in bodily fluids, e.g., lymph or<br>
blood serum, when administered to a patient, and, once gelled, are capable of<br>
controlling the delivery of the carrier peptide and of a therapeutic agent or<br>
agents at a rate suitable for a therapeutic use of the carrier peptide and/or of the<br>
therapeutic agent or agents. For instance, gels using, e.g., somatostatin analogs<br>
such as SOMATULINE as the carrier peptide and DECAPEPTYL as the<br>
therapeutic agent are able to maintain a sustained release of therapeutic levels<br>
of SOMATULINE and DECAPEPTYL in the blood for one month or longer.<br>
See Example 1, below. i<br>
Peptides that are preferred for use as the carrier peptide in the new<br>
compositions include somatostatin, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone (PTH),<br>
parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP), soluble agonists or antagonists<br>
of LHRH, GRF, and other soluble analogs that have the agonist or antagonist<br>
effect of any of these peptides. Preferably, the carrier peptide comprises at least<br>
one hydrophobic residue, e.g., non-naturally occurring residues such as<br>
napthylalanine (Nal), norleucine (Nle), and halogen substituted phenylalanines,<br>
and naturally occurring residues such as Trp, He, Phe, Val, Leu, Met, Ala, Gly,<br>
or Cys, that allow the carrier peptide to better form a gel. Hydrophobicities of<br>
amino acids can be determined as discussed in Eisenberg, Ann. Rev. Biochem.,<br>
53:595-623 (1984).<br>
The configuration of a carrier peptide of the composition is also<br>
preferably altered, e.g., by a D-amino acid to decrease enzymatic degradation,<br>
by a disulfide bridge to create a cyclic peptide, or by an internal amide bond<br>
between the side chains of two amino acid residues. These features of suitable<br><br>
carrier peptides are believed to allow or enhance the ability of the carrier<br>
peptide or peptide salt to automatically form a gel once administered to a<br>
patient.<br>

In vitro Assays for Suitable Peptide Salts<br>
A simple in vitro assay can be used to determine the suitability of a<br>
given peptide or peptide salt for use as a carrier peptide in a composition of the<br>
present invention. The peptide or peptide salt, e.g., in the form of a powder or a<br>
suspension, is mixed with a clear bodily fluid, e.g., lymph, plasma, or serum, in<br>
a container. This container is heated to 37 degrees C, e.g., by a water or oil<br>
bath. A visual inspection is made to determine whether the peptide salt forms a<br>
gel.<br>
An in vitro light diffraction assay can also be used to determine whether<br>
a peptide or peptide salt will be suitable for use in the present invention. The<br>
peptide or peptide salt, e.g., in the form of a powder, is mixed on a glass<br>
microscope slide with between 20 and 50 percent, by weight, of water. After<br>
being well mixed, e.g., after about 5 minutes, the slide is analyzed on an<br>
inverted microscope, such as the ZEISS AXIOVERT 100, using polarized<br>
light. If the polarized light is diffracted, as indicated by the presence of bright<br>
colors, the peptide salt has formed a gel, and is suitable for use in the present<br>
invention.<br>
Another in vitro assay can be used to study the release characteristics of<br>
the solid and semisolid compositions of the invention. The MLCROETTE<br>
transdermal diffusion cell (Hanson Research, Palo Alto, Calif.) is utilized in the<br>
assay as an autosampling system composed of, e.g., six thermostatic cells, a<br>
mechanical stirring device, and a sample collector.<br>
When used to study the delivery profile of, e.g., solid SOMATULINE<br>
cylinders, the assay conditions for the autosampling system would be as<br>
follows: release medium=NaCl 0.9%, initial volume=7 ml, rod weight=1.6 to<br>
1.8 mg., temperature=37 C, stirring rate=60 rpm, final stirring rate=400 rpm<br>
(for the last 15 min.), and replacement volume=481 mul. Samples can be taken<br>
at, e.g., 4,10,20,40; 65,90,180 and 270 minutes.<br>
The samples collected in the autosampler can be analyzed by high<br>
pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and quantified in a Hewlett Packard<br>
Series 1090 Liquid Chromatograph (Teknokroma, Barcelona, Spain) with<br>
automatic injector. A UV-VIS Diode Array detector may be used for the<br>
analysis. A NUCLEOSIL C-18 column, 25 cm x 4.0 mm diameter, was used.<br>
Typical assay conditions for the HPLC are as follows: Component A=0.1%<br>
TFA in AcCN:Water (80:20); Component B=0.1% TFA in water, flow=0.9<br>
ml/min.; injection volume=20 microliters; temperature=room temperature;<br>
detection=UV-280 nm; and acquisition time=20 minutes. The retention time of<br>
SOMATULINE was calculated to be 14 minutes. The gradient system used for<br>
the HPLC are depicted in Table I.<br>
In vivo Assay of Sustained Peptide Release<br>
Once a particular peptide or peptide salt is found to gel in an in vitro<br>
assay, e.g., an assay as described above, an in vivo assay can be used to<br>
determine the suitability of that peptide salt for use as a sustained-release<br>
carrier peptide of a therapeutic agent or agents in animals or humans. A blood<br>
level release profile for the carrier peptide and/or the therapeutic agent or<br>
agents can be determined by injecting the composition into an animal, e.g., a<br>
Sprague Dawley rat, a dog, etc., and testing blood samples taken at specific<br>
time intervals, e.g., hourly intervals over 1 to 5 days, or 12 or 24 hour intervals<br>
over 5 to 45 days, for the concentration of the peptide and/or therapeutic agent<br>
or agents. The suitability of a particular peptide gel, or a peptide/carrier gel, for<br>
therapeutic delivery of the carrier peptide and/or therapeutic agent or agents<br>
can thus be determined.<br>
Generally, in such an assay animals are anaesthetized with pentobarbital<br>
(60 mg/kg i.p. for rats), and a jugular vein is cannulated for blood sampling. A<br>
test semisolid suspension or solid composition (or standard solution for<br>
comparison purposes), e.g., a SOMATULINE/DECAPEPTYL mixture, is<br>
injected subcutaneously at a specific dosage, e.g., 1.0,3.0, or 6.0 mg/kg of<br>
SOMATULINE. After administration of the composition or solution,<br>
heparinized blood samples are obtained through the cannula at set time<br>
intervals, and plasma is separated after centrifugation. The amount of carrier<br>
peptide and/or therapeutic agent(s) in the plasma samples is/are determined by,<br>
e.g., a standard radioimmunoassay (RIA) technique that allows a direct<br>
measurement of the carrier peptide and/or therapeutic agent(s) without<br>
extraction from the rat plasma. The resulting data are plotted (e.g., blood<br>
concentration (ng/ml) vs. time) to establish a blood level release profile.<br>
In addition, the presence of the carrier peptide and/or therapeutic<br>
agent(s) in the animal can be determined indirectly by assaying for any<br>
biological response of the animal. For example, if the carrier peptide or a<br>
therapeutic agent is a somatostatin analog, its effect, and thus presence, can be<br>
determined by assaying the inhibition of growth hormone release in response to<br>
GRF using standard assays. Such indirect methods of determining the presence<br>
of a biologically active carrier peptide or of a therapeutic agent can also be<br>
used in human patients.<br>
When monitored for 1 to 3 days, this in vivo assay can be used to<br>
determine whether a particular carrier peptide will form a gel once<br>
administered in vivo that provides the desired sustained-release of the carrier<br>
peptide and/or one or more therapeutic agents. A carrier peptide is suitable for<br>
the present invention if it provides for sustained-release of the carrier peptide or<br>
a therapeutic agent over a desired period of time. Preferably the carrier peptide<br>
or a therapeutic agent is released at therapeutic levels for at least 3 days, more<br>
preferably for at least 7 days, more preferably at for least 14 days, more<br>
preferably still for at least 30 days.<br>
This assay can also be used to determine the effectiveness of a particular<br>
peptide carrier or combination of peptide carrier and other carrier, and the<br>
necessary dosages, for use in a specific therapy for a particular animal, by<br>
comparing the blood level release profile to known dosage requirements for<br>
treatment of a particular disease using a particular therapeutic agent. Likewise,<br>
mis assay can be used to estimate the expected effectiveness of a particular<br>
type and dosage of therapeutic agent for use in specific human therapies.<br>
Carriers Suitable for Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Although certain carrier peptides, e.g., salts of SOMATULINE, can be<br>
formulated into a solid composition without the need for any other carrier, the<br>
compositions of the invention also can be manufactured using carriers that are<br>
homogeneously compounded wife the carrier peptide and therapeutic agent(s).<br>
The carrier should be water-soluble, monomeric, and directly eliminated by the<br>
body. Preferably, the carrier has a molecular weight of less than 1000 daltons.<br>
The carrier is chosen to give the composition its physical characteristics, but<br>
does not typically affect the sustained-release characteristics of the<br>
compositions. However, certain carriers can be used to decrease or increase<br>
both the release rate and the duration of delivery of the compositions. A nonexclusive<br>
list of such suitable carriers would include, without limitation,<br>
surfactants, e.g., TWEEN 80, polyalcohols, e.g., mannitol and sorbitol,<br>
monosaccharides, e.g., lactose and glucose, organic solvents, and<br>
polysaccharides.<br>
Method of Preparing Solid Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The manufacturing process of the invention avoids solubility problems<br>
of many peptides since there is no need to dissolve the peptide prior to<br>
f 9<br>
injection. Another advantage of the solid compositions of the invention is their<br>
stability. The anhydrous, solid compositions of the invention avoid the<br>
problems of degradation, crystallization, aggregation, and coagulation<br>
associated with hydrated sustained-release formulations such as hydrogels.<br>
One method for preparing a composition of the invention using a carrier<br>
s<br>
in addition to the carrier peptide and loading the resulting drug composition for<br>
injection via a trocar needle is as follows.<br>
The carrier, e.g., mannitol, is dissolved in a liquid manufacturing<br>
vehicle, e.g., water or an organic solvent. The resulting solution is mixed with<br>
the desired peptide carrier and therapeutic agent or agents to form a<br>
homogeneous semisolid mixture. If the final solid composition does not include<br>
a carrier, then the peptide carrier and therapeutic agent or agents are mixed<br>
solely with water or another liquid vehicle to form a semisolid mixture.<br>
The semisolid mixture is then transferred to an extrusion chamber, e.g.,<br>
a stainless syringe or a feeding extrusion area, with an plunger or a screw, and<br>
an extrusion nozzle with a 0.5 to 3.0 mm internal diameter. The mixture is<br>
extruded, cut into rods of a precise length, and collected. The resulting rods are<br>
thoroughly dried in a vacuum and preferably have a final diameter of 2 or 3<br>
mm. Various known techniques can be used to move the non-solid mass of<br>
material through the orifice to produce the elongated rods with a desired cross-<br>
section once dried.<br>
The manufacturing vehicle can be removed by evaporation, freeze-<br>
drying, or vacuum drying. The rods are then tested to determine the precise<br>
mass percentage of carrier peptide and therapeutic agent(s), i.e., dosage per unit<br>
length of cylinder. Five cylinders are taken from a batch, weighed, and then<br>
processed to remove the total amount of carrier peptide and therapeutic<br>
agent(s), e.g., by solubilization in an appropriate solvent such as 0.1% acetic<br>
acid in water. The amounts of extracted carrier peptide and therapeutic agent(s)<br>
are measured, e.g., using standard HPLC methodology as used in the in vitro<br>
assay described above.<br>
Prior to use, the rods are also tested for uniformity by calculating their<br>
weight/length ratio. The lengths and weights of five cylinders are measured and<br>
the ratio of length to weight is calculated. Criteria are established regarding<br>
acceptable deviations from uniformity, e.g., the control is considered positive if<br>
the relative standard deviation (RSD) is less than 5%. This RSD equals<br>
[SDiengn/weight ratio /Meanlength/weight ratio] x 100, so it is a measure of the uniformity<br>
of the length/weight ratio.<br>
Once the rods have been accepted, the dosage is determined by length<br>
and weight measurement. Having already calculated the peptide concentration,<br>
the rods are cut into precise lengths corresponding to desired dosage units. The<br>
rods are tested once more prior to administration by weighing them on a<br>
balance. The rods are then ready to be loaded into hollow needles, e.g., of a<br>
trocar.<br>
Trocar needles are loaded through the back end after the tip of the<br>
needle is sealed, e.g., with a cap. The back end of the needle preferably has a<br>
funnel shape, which makes it easy to insert the solid rods. A metallic plunger<br>
then pushes the rod out of the tip of the needle and into a patient.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the back end of the trocar needle is attached<br>
to a sterile stainless steel, plastic, or glass cylinder into which a semisolid<br>
composition is extruded, cut, and dried. The cylinder is situated such that when<br>
dried, the rod falls into the needle by gravity. The pre-loaded trocar needle is<br>
then ready to be connected with its metallic plunger system and its activating<br>
system to a standard trocar.<br>
Method of Preparing Semisolid Suspensions and Freeze-Dried<br>
Compositions<br>
Semisolid suspensions can be made using the same peptides and carriers<br>
used to make the solid compositions. However, compared to the solid<br>
compositions, the semisolid peptide suspensions are hydrated with between 10<br>
and 90%, by weight, of an aqueous solvent (e.g., sterilized water) to form<br>
highly viscous or paste-like compositions. Preferably the water is added just<br>
prior to administration of the composition to a patient.<br>
The semisolid suspensions can be manufactured by the same process as<br>
described above for solid compositions, i.e., by extrusion, but without the final<br>
vehicle removal step. The semisolid extruded rods can be directly injected into<br>
a patient with a syringe-like device, e.g., as described below. Alternatively, the<br>
dried, solid rods can be rehydrated to form a semisolid suspension prior to<br>
injection.<br>
Semisolid compositions can also be manufactured by a freeze-drying<br>
process which simplifies the unit dosage control and allows simple sterilization<br>
before the composition is loaded into a needle. In this process, the carrier<br>
peptide and therapeutic agent, with or without an additional carrier, is first<br>
dissolved in water. The resulting solution is sterilized by passage through a<br>
0.22 micron filter under pressure, e.g., using a syringe with a plunger. Once<br>
 filtered, the solution must be handled under sterile conditions. Volume is<br>
precisely controlled, e.g., with a micropipette, and the sterile solution is filled<br>
into a sealed syringe cylinder. The liquid in the cylinder is then freeze-dried.<br>
The resulting lyophilized solid volume is compacted, e.g., using a plunger, in<br>
the syringe under vacuum.<br>
 The syringe containing the compacted, sterile solid is then packaged<br>
under vacuum. The solid composition will remain stable in mis condition for<br>
extended periods of time without need of refrigeration or other special storage<br>
conditions. The solid composition is hydrated with water just prior to<br>
administration, e.g., using the two-part device described in U.S. 5,595,760,<br>
 which contains the requisite volume of sterile water in a separate syringe-like<br>
cylinder. The freeze-dried solid is rehydrated to form a viscous, semisolid<br>
suspension that can then be injected into a patient.<br>
A solution of the composition of the invention is undesirable, because<br>
such a solution, once injected, will disperse and not form the sustained-release<br>
 gel of the invention. Thus, the amount of water is carefully selected to be less<br>
than that required to dissolve a specific amount of any active component of the<br>
composition. For example, at 25 degrees C, pH 7.0,1.0 ml or less of water is<br>
required when mixed with 26 mg of the acetate salt of SOMATULINE to avoid<br>
the formation of a solution. By using an amount of water that is less than 50<br>
 percent, and preferably less than 20 or 10 percent, of the amount of water<br>
required to dissolve the carrier peptide or any therapeutic agent, a semisolid or<br>
paste-like suspension, rather than a solution, is ensured.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a needle is attached to the syringe cylinder<br>
with a funnel shaped connector. The funnel shaped connector can be part of the<br>
 needle or part of the syringe. The needle can be fixed on the syringe or attached<br>
to the syringe just prior to use. The needle is adapted, in length and outer<br>
diameter, to the injection route, e.g., intramuscularly, intradennally or<br>
subcutaneously. The inside surface of the needle is preferably smooth to aid the<br>
injection of the semisolid composition.<br>
The syringe preferably has a plunger of small diameter (1 to 5 mm) so<br>
that the small volume of semisolid composition (10 microliters to 300<br>
microliters) will represent a significant length in the syringe barrel. This allows<br>
more accurate visualization and dosage measurement.<br>
COMPOSITION EXAMPLES<br>
Compositions of the present invention may be prepared using techniques<br>
well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation. In general compositions<br>
of the invention are prepared by mixing a carrier peptide with one or more<br>
therapeutic agents and, if desired, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable,<br>
monomeric, soluble carriers, adding an appropriate solvent thereto, and then<br>
mixing until a uniform consistency is achieved.<br>
One convenient method to prepare a composition of the invention involves the<br>
steps of mixing<br>
(1) weighing of the product (Xg A + Yg B);<br>
(2) Putting both dry powder into a reservoir preferentially a stainless steal<br>
syringe and making a physical mixture, e.g., using a TURBULA® shaker<br>
mixer;<br>
(3) reducing the volume to the one of the future semisolid mixture (i.e. moving<br>
the plunger to a position where the dead volume will correspond then to the<br>
water contain of the semisolid);<br>
(4) putting the powder mixture under vacuum with a vacuum pump (tube-<br>
connection through a filter);<br>
(5) connecting with a valve this mixture to a liquid reservoir (other stainless<br>
steal syringe) with water or aqueous medium; and<br>
(6) connecting both reservoirs and performing the mixture by push-pull on<br>
syringes plungers rods. When the mixture is ready, it can be loaded into<br>
syringes the way we make it with the one component semisolid.<br>
Example 1 SOMATULINE/DECAPEPTYL Composition<br>
87.5 mg of DECAPEPTYL-acetate was dissolved in 2.6 ml water and<br>
placed in a first 5 ml syringe. 1.0 g of SOMATULINE was placed in a second 5<br>
ml syringe and the second syringe placed under vacuum. The two syringes<br>
were connected via a valve and Millipore filter, the valve was opened, and the<br>
DECAPEPTYL solution allowed to flow into the evacuated SOMATULINE<br>
syringe. 10 transfers of the resultant solution was made between the two<br>
syringes via alternate depression of their respective plungers producing a<br>
homogeneous, semi-solid mixture.<br>
Example 2 SOMATULINE/CABERGOLINE Composition<br>
1.0 g. SOMATULINE and 0.1 g CABERGOLINE are added to a 5.0 ml<br>
syringe. The two powders are dry-mixed wit a spatula and put under vacuum,<br>
e.g., using a vacuum pump. The mixed powder is connected via a valve to<br>
another 5 ml syringe containing 2.6 ml water. The valve is opened and the<br>
water is mixed with powder through the valve. 10 transfers of the resultant<br>
solution are made between the two syringes via alternate depression of their<br>
respective plungers to produce a homogeneous, semi-solid mixture. The<br>
semisolid is then loaded into 0.3 ml insulin syringes at doses of 0.225 ml.<br>
IN VIVO EXAMPLE<br>
0.15 ml of the foregoing semisolid mixture from Example 1 was loaded<br>
into a 0.3 ml insulin syringe and was injected into beagle dogs. Blood samples<br>
were collected and standard radioimmunoassay (RIA) analysis was performed<br>
thereon. The results are depicted in Table 1, below.<br>
As will be readily appreciated, the peak concentration and duration of<br>
release may be easily modulated by varying the relative amounts of peptide<br>
carrier and therapeutic agent, as well as the total amount of composition given.<br>
A similar study may be performed, e.g., for the composition of Example<br>
2. Alternatively, the pharmacokinetic profile of the therapeutic agent may be<br>
approximated by assaying only the pharmacokinetic profile of SOMATULINE<br>
of the composition, the Cabergoline release expected to be proportional thereto.<br>
