METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IMPROVING THE AIR QUALITY WITHIN AN ENCLOSED SPACE;<br>
OXYVITAL LIMITED, A HONG KONG LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, OF 15B WYNDHAM PLACE, 44 WYNDHAM STREET, CENTRAL, HONG KONG, CHINA<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED. <br><br>
FILED OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for improving the air quality within an enclosed space and, in particular, although not necessarily solely, a standalone device for improving air quality in a domicile such as a home, apartment or similar. However, the invention may also apply to a vehicle such as an aeroplane, train, bus, car, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
In most urban environments, there is a decreasing quality of air available in the general atmosphere. This reduction in air quality is repeated within buildings and, in some instances, can even be worse. Smoking within an enclosed building is harmful not only in respect of passive smoking but also due to the reduction in oxygen content and general impurities provided into the air aside from nicotine or tar.<br>
The decrease in air quality is not only due to a decrease in oxygen content but also a corresponding increase in a number of potentially harmful constituents or pollutants. These include an increase in suspended particles, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, bacteria, formaldehyde, total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), ozone, radon, toxic moulds, ammonia, sulphur dioxide and organic odour causing compounds.<br><br><br>
Traditional forms of manipulating the atmosphere within a room utilize air conditioning for temperature control and, either integrally or separately, air filtration units that seek to remove larger particulate material. Although the air conditioning units may be provided with some filtration, these filters are generally an afterthought merely to preclude coarse particles from going through the air conditioning system. Regardless, these filters are generally static filters in each of the air inlets or outlets throughout the building and quickly become clogged with particulate matter. This requires regular maintenance to clean and replace the filters. Failure to do so can quickly turn the filters into a breeding ground for harmful organisms rather than any attempt to improve air quality.<br>
For domestic appliances, separate air filtration units utilising HEPA filters are also known. However, these merely seek to filter particulate materials and do not improve or alter the composition of the air passing through the filter.<br>
Other apparatus seeks to improve air quality only in a controlled and highly localized environment through such apparatus as oxygen ventilators. Such ventilators are provided with face masks or similar to improve the air quality to a single user. However, such ventilators are not generally suitable or adapted for use in a larger environment such as an apartment or similar.<br>
One solution towards the improvement of indoor air quality has been already been described in International Publication No. WO 02/12796. This apparatus is generally directed to the treatment of air within an entire building although does apply in principle to single room environments also. However, in the case of domestic appliances in particular, matters of cost are of paramount importance perhaps requiring some simplification of the apparatus. Furthermore, it is important<br><br><br>
to reduce the maintenance and service requirements of the apparatus as much as possible to bring these within the scope and capabilities of a typical home user rather than an experienced service technician.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for improving the air quality within an enclosed space that overcomes some of the disadvantages of the prior art by providing a simplified apparatus having simplified maintenance requirements suitable for a domestic appliance. It is at least an object of the present invention to provide the public with a useful choice.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the following drawing in which:-<br>
-    Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of an apparatus forming part of a preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for improving the air quality within an enclosed space including transport vehicles such as planes, trains, etc. Referring to the drawing, a first embodiment of an apparatus to improve air quality is shown. This diagram shows a portion of the apparatus that may be incorporated to act within an air circulation system in a building or provided as a freestanding<br><br><br>
unit in a single room or any other controlled environment. Although the preferred embodiment may be described in terms of a stand alone domestic appliance, the apparatus may also be included in existing air handling, moving or conditioning apparatus. For example, such apparatus may be incorporated into or connected with an air conditioning unit intended for specific control of air temperature.<br>
In the endeavour to provide better treatment or conversion of the air within an enclosed space, the present invention looks towards the use of zeolites as attenuators for the air. Such an apparatus is disclosed in International Publication WO 02/12796, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The apparatus as shown in Fig. 1 is intended as a domestic appliance although it will be appreciated that it may also be used for larger units installed in air conditioning if desired. As such, the simplicity of the device and ease of maintenance are of considerable importance.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the appliance 1 is shown. Polluted air, or at least air drawn from within the enclosed space is drawn into the unit under the influence of a fan, turbine or other air driving means (not shown) to move air through the apparatus.<br>
Initially, the air is drawn through one or more particulate pre-filters such as the three stage filters 2, 3 and 4 being a coarse dust filter, fine dust filter and HEPA filter as shown. As is understood in the art, these are arranged in sequence such that the finer filter follows the coarser filter, etc. The purpose of these pre-filters is to remove as much particulate material as possible from the air stream. The subsequent apparatus seeks to work on the compounds that are constituents within<br><br><br>
the air stream and particulate material entering into the subsequent optional air compressor and molecular sieves is undesirable for performance.<br>
Although this apparatus uses three stages of filtration, alternative numbers could be used provided some particulate pre-filtration is provided to keep such materials from the sieves.<br>
The air may also be passed through an optional compressor 5 and, if the compressor is provided, cooling unit 6 to condition the temperature of the air. Similarly, the air may be heated or otherwise altered to a desired temperature range either before or after processing.<br>
The air is then passed to the molecular sieves as shown in Fig. 1. The apparatus contains at least three sieves 7, 8 and 9, containing zeolite material. Typically for a small domestic appliance, intended for a space for up to 90 m , each of the sieves may contain between 0.5 and 1 kg of zeolite material. In the preferred form, approximately 2.2 kgs of material are evenly provided over the three sieves.<br>
It should be noted that a minimum of three sieves are provided to operate in the manner as soon to be described. It will be obvious that a great number may be used of varying volumes depending on the control of the operations.<br>
The sieves 7, 8 and 9 are connected in parallel between an inlet 10 into which the air is first drawn and the outlet 20 through which cleaned air may be exhausted.<br>
Each of the sieves is individually connected to the inlet through controlled valves 11, 12 and 13 and to the outlet through controlled valves 14, 15 and 16.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, each of the sieves is interconnected to each other through conduits 22. A regulator 17 is also provided in association with the conduits 22 so as to reduce pressure and bleed some of the air passing through the conduits to a sensing device and control circuit 18 as will be described later.<br>
A control means 18 controls operations of the valves and regulator to achieve the desired processing sequence.<br>
The operation of the control means 18 initially passes air into one of the sieves such as the first sieve 7. As air passes into the sieve, it will be appreciated that the air contained within the sieve is displaced. This air is simultaneously directed to the second sieve 8. In fact, free 02 and free N2 move through the zeolite media faster than other constituents hence the air within sieve 1 is mixed with some of the faster moving oxygen and free nitrogen into sieve 2. The air within sieve 2 is simultaneously displaced towards the outlet 20. Throughout this phase, the third sieve 9 is locked to retain the air within substantially immobile.<br>
Following a designated retention time for the air to remain immobile in the third sieve 9, the valves and regulator are controlled to move the air once again. In this phase, valves 11 and 13 are closed and valve 12 opened such that incoming air is directed into the second sieve 8. The air within sieve 8 is directed towards the third sieve 9 which itself is connected to the outlet by the opening of valve 16. The first sieve is locked throughout this period to retain the air within.<br>
In the third phase of the operation, incoming air is directed through valve 13 with both valves 11 and 12 closed, air is passed from sieve 9 into sieve 7 and sieve 8 is locked.<br><br><br>
Hence it can be seen that a continuous cycle exists that includes a period of retention of the air and pollutants in the zeolite media.<br>
To provide a domestic appliance or other installation, it is preferred to minimize any need to clean, replace or otherwise interrupt the operation of the molecular sieves. The integrity of the sieves is important and such maintenance would be beyond a normal home user or even in other installations, would require a service contract or similar for continued operation.<br>
To ensure complete processing of the air through the sieves such that no residue builds up in the molecular sieves or exhausted as harmful pollutants after processing, the retention time for the air in each sieve is set to a minimum of 2 seconds and, to obtain a reasonable flow rate though the apparatus, a maximum of 10 seconds. More preferably the retention time is in the range of 3 to 5 seconds or even more preferably, between 3.5 and 4.5 seconds. An approximate time of 4 seconds may be used.<br>
In providing such a retention, the zeolite media has the opportunity to act on relatively immobile compounds trapped within. A catalytic action may take place using the electron field and van der Vaals forces within the media to break the valence bonding in the pollutant compounds. By ensuring the retention time is sufficient, not only is oxygen released from more complex compounds and pollutants such as CO and C02 but each of the pollutants may be broken into simple components. During the subsequent phase in which the sieve is flushed from the top by air being displaced from another sieve, all the constituents, including carbon, may be released from the media. Carbon tends to be released in the form of carbon<br><br><br>
clusters such as C66 which itself is a relatively harmless material and part of the natural environment, that will exhaust out of the apparatus and fall to the floor in the form of dust. It will eventually be removed upon vacuuming or otherwise cleaning the floor in the surrounding area or re-circulated through the apparatus and caught in the pre-filters.<br>
The advantage of exhausting these carbon and other materials is that the sieve itself retains little or nothing from each usage.<br>
Further, such processing exhausts nitrogen which forms a natural part of air as the zeolite has broken the bonds of molecules such as NO and N02 by an adsorption process. The adsorption process is important in also ensuring there is no collection in the molecular sieves. The adsorption occurs when air from the inlet is first directed to a sieve. The zeolite material catches the nitrogen compounds with the material and the bonds between the elements are broken during the retention period. When the valve at the outlet from the sieve is opened and air passing from the initial filters through an alternative sieve is passed into the sieve, the smaller harmless compounds are exhausted. This is as opposed to traditional filters that absorb harmful materials in the existing form and retain these until the filter is cleaned or replaced.<br>
Even upon extensive running for a period of twelve months in an experimental stage, a sieve was inspected and there was no noticeable build up of contaminants within the sieve. Furthermore, there was no need noticeable drop in performance of the sieve.<br><br><br>
Hence the apparatus controlled in this manner may continue to operate in a domestic or other setting without the need for any maintenance of the sieves for a considerable period of time, perhaps the design life of the apparatus itself.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 1, the apparatus can also be seen to provide a sensing and control circuit. This circuit may be used to sense a characteristic such as pressure, perhaps downstream from the particular filters. Unlike the sieves, the particulate pre-filters as in any similar filtering apparatus, do become clogged with particulate material over time and may require cleaning or replacement. However, as such pre-filters are easily washed in the case of the dust filters or replaced in the case of the HEPA filters, this is within the expectations of an appliance purchaser.<br>
In this preferred embodiment, the sensing unit 18 seeks to sense pressure or similar to determine if the performance or flow through the filters has reduced sufficiently to indicate that maintenance of those filters is required. The sensing unit may be connected to a control circuit and indicating means (not shown) such that a light or similar is illuminated on the device. This may also be accompanied by shutting down of the apparatus either immediately, or only upon further degradation of performance to the point where too much particulate material may be getting through the filters and entering the sieves. This protects the sieves while also ensuring the users attention is brought to the need to attend to pre-filter maintenance.<br>
In addition to sensing and control on pressure or flow rate, the sensing and control circuit can additionally or alternatively sense and control the apparatus in response to other parameters. For example, the machine temperature may be monitored to check for errors in functions or failure of items such as the cooling unit and compressor.   Further, the quality of the air being passed from one sieve to<br><br><br>
another in the process through conduits 22 as bled off by the regulator 17 may be checked by sensing the % of oxygen and providing a warning if this falls below a threshold of, for example, 80% or more. Preferably the threshold for such a warning is set at about 82%. Further, if the oxygen percentage continues to fall below a lower threshold, the control circuit may stop operation of the apparatus 1. Such a lower threshold may be between 70 and 80% and preferably, about 72%.<br>
An optional sound absorber 19 may be included on the exhaust to reduce noise emissions from the apparatus.<br>
Hence it can be seen that the apparatus may provide improved indoor air quality while minimizing the need for maintenance to only the particulate filters. Sensing and indicating means and controls may be included on those filters to ensure they are maintained as well.<br>
The method and apparatus provide a control over indoor air quality that, as a minimum, remove or reduce to acceptable levels for human occupation, the nine pollutants described by the World Health Organisation and regarded worldwide, as the main problems associated with indoor air quality. These pollutants are suspended particles, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, bacteria, formaldehyde, total volatile organic compounds, radon and ozone.<br>
This invention has generally been described with reference to preferred embodiments that should not be considered limiting to the scope of the invention. Specific integers referred to throughout the description are deemed to incorporate known equivalents where appropriate.<br><br><br>
