BIOALLIANCE PHARMA of 5 9 BOULEVARD DU GENERAL MARTIAL VALIN, F-75015, PARIS, FRANCE, FRENCH Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is  to be<br><br><br><br><br><br>
VECTORIZATION SYSTEM COMPRISING NANOPARTICLES OF<br>
HOMOGENOUS SIZE OF AT LEAST ONE POLYMER AND AT LEAST<br>
ONE POSITIVELY CHARGED POLYSACCHARIDE AND METHOD FOR<br>
THE PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
The invention pertains to the delivery of active principles used especially in the field of pharmaceuticals for preventive, curative or diagnostic purposes. The invention more specifically has as object a delivery and vectorization system of substances of interest constituted by nanoparticles based on at least one polymer, preferably a poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate), and at least one positively charged polysaccharide, preferably a low molecular weight chitosan, and anionic substances of interest, or comprising an anionic region, adhered to or incorporated at the level of said nanoparticles.<br>
The development of new systems for the delivery or release of active principles has as first object the controlled delivery of an active agent, especially a pharmacological agent, to its site of action at a therapeutically optimal rate and dosage (J. Kreuter, 1994). We can also cite the improvement of the therapeutic index which can be obtained by modulation of the distribution of the active principle in the organism. The association of the active principle with the delivery system makes possibly notably its specific delivery to the site of action or of its controlled release after targeting the site of action. The reduction in the amount of active principle in the compartments in which its presence is not desirable makes it possible to increase the efficacy of said active principle, to reduce its toxic side effects and even to modify or restore its activity.<br>
One of the major issues of delivery is its application to molecular biology and most particularly its application to active principles such as deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs), oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), peptides, proteins - all negatively charged.    Our comprehension of the molecular<br><br><br>
biology bases in genetic diseases makes it possible to modulate or replace a dysfunctional gene. The development of gene therapy as routine in clinical practice is dependent on the possibility of repeated administration via the systemic route, the capacity to reach a target and to effectively transfect cells in vivo (Feigner, 1990; Kabanov and Alakhov, 1993; Crook, 1995; Douglas and Curiel, 1995; Lasic and Templeton, 1996) as well as the possibility of fabricating vectors which will be capable of being adapted to an industrial scale. The techniques of in vitro transfection used to date, such as electroporation and co-precipitation of DNA with calcium phosphate, are approaches the application of which in vivo would appear to be difficult (Fynan et al., 1993).<br>
The systems used at present for in vivo transfection take into account the natural negative charge of DNAs and ODNs. These are either viral systems (Morgan and Anderson, 1993) or nonviral constructions such as cationic lipids (Ledley, 1994; Zelphati and Szoka, 1996). The viral vectors are very effective in terms of in vitro transfection but they have limitations in vivo because of their immunogenicity (Wilson et al., 1990; Douglas and Curiel, 1995; Verma and Somia, 1997). Among the nonviral vectors, the cationic lipids such as Transfectam (Behr et al., 1989) present good transfection properties but their application in vivo is limited by their toxicity, the activation of the complement and their notable tropism for the liver and the lungs.<br>
Since the studies carried out with poly(l-lysine) at the end of the 1980s (Wu and Wu, 1987), many cationic polymers have been studied as nonviral transfection vectors. These vectors include polyethyleneimine (Boussif et al., 1995; Remy et al., 1998), polybrene (Mumper et al., 1996) and the dendrimers of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) (Tang et al., 1996).<br>
Until now, the efficacy of transfection with polymers is relatively low and many of these cationic polymers have exhibited a relative toxicity with low potentials  of  repeated  administration  via  the  intravenous  route.     The<br><br><br>
polymers used directly with the active principles notably DNA are limited by their transfection efficacy and consume a large amount of active principle and thus require the use of a large amount of polymer, which is itself toxic. The colloidal systems used for the delivery notably of genes in vivo use smaller amounts of polymer and active principle.<br>
The colloidal delivery systems of active principles comprise the liposomes, microemulsions, nanocapsules, nanospheres, microparticles and nanoparticles. Nanoparticles presents advantages of targeting, modulation of distribution and flexibility of formulation and have a polymer structure which can be designed and implemented in a manner adapted to the goal. They have been found to be most especially promising for obtaining a better therapeutic index in the sense defined above because of their aptitude to ensure a controlled release, a specific delivery to the site of action or targeted delivery, enabling both an augmentation of the efficacy and a reduction in the toxic side effects at the level of the other organs.<br>
Among these, the poly(alkyl cyanoacrylates) described in EP-B-0 007 895 (US-A-4,329,332 and US-A-4,489,055) and EP-B-0 064 967 (US-A-4,913,908) are particularly interesting because their bioerosion takes place rapidly in relation to other biodegradable polymers and unfolds over durations compatible with therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The nanoparticles are colloidal vectors the diameter of which ranges between 10 nm and 1000 nm. These particles are formed by macromolecules in which the biologically active substance is trapped, encapsulated or adsorbed at the surface. Nanoparticles or nanospheres were described by Birrenbach and Speiser (1976) in terms of nanopellets and nanocapsules and qualified by Kreuter and Speiser (1976) as adjuvants and delivery systems of active substances by Kreuter (1983).<br>
With the goal of increasing the stability of the oligonucleotides, of increasing their penetration into the cells and avoiding nonspecific distribution, the use of particular vectors, like nanoparticles, is considered to<br><br>
be one of the most promising approaches. However, their use has been limited by the toxicity of the substance used to affix the active principle to the nanoparticle.<br>
The polymer nanoparticles that have been subjected to the greatest amount of research are the polyisohexylcyanoacrylates (PIHCA). However, as nanoparticles presenting a negative surface charge, a cationic copolymer (diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) dextran) or a cationic hydrophobic detergent (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)) were combined with polyalkylcyanoacrylates (PACA) in order to facilitate the association of ODNs by formation of ion pairs on the nanoparticles. Thus, the ODNs were effectively associated with the PACA nanoparticles containing a hydrophobic cation such as CTAB (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, Chavany et al., 1992). Since CTAB presented toxicity problems, Zobel et al., 1987 replaced the CTAB with DEAE dextran which was introduced into the polymerization medium prior to the formation of the nanospheres. DEAE dextran was also found to be toxic.<br>
The ideal nanoparticle vector for the delivery of active principles such as DNAs, ODNs, peptides and proteins must be:<br>
-	capable of forming a complex with the molecule of interest taking into account its physicochemical characteristics and the substance selected for affixing the active principle must be adapted to the charge and the toxicity data,<br>
-	capable of protecting the active principle from degradation during its transport in the circulating blood,<br>
-	biocompatible (nontoxic, nonimmunogenic and preferably<br>
biodegradable),<br>
-	capable of delivering the active principle to the level of the target tissue in sufficient quantity, and<br>
-	capable of targeting specifically a cell type.<br><br><br>
This goal is reached by using nanoparticles made of polymers, in particular poly(alkyl cyanoacrylates), associated with one or more positively charged polysaccharides.<br>
The invention thus has as object a vectorization and delivery system of substances of therapeutic or diagnostic interest, of the type constituted by nanoparticles, characterized in that said nanoparticles present a homogeneous size distribution and comprise (i) at least one polymer and (ii) at least one nontoxic positively charged polysaccharide.<br>
In the system according to the invention, the substances of interest are incorporated or adsorbed at the level of said nanoparticles.<br>
The vectorization and delivery system according to the invention is most particularly suitable for anionic substances of interest or those comprising an anionic region.<br>
The polymer is preferably a poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) in which the linear or branched alkyl group comprises from 1 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
The polysaccharide(s) entering into the composition of the nanoparticles of the invention is(are) nontoxic, unlike the substances proposed in the prior art such as CTAB or DEAE dextran.<br>
Thus, the invention most particularly pertains to a positively charged polysaccharide which is linear. It is preferably a derivative of chitin and most preferably of chitosan or its derivatives as long as they are positively charged.<br>
Chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature after cellulose. The skeleton is composed of pi-4-glucosamine sugars with a high degree of N-acetylation. This structure is close to that of cellulose, the difference being the replacement of the hydroxyl functional group by an amino group (Roberts, 1992). These polycationic biopolymers constitute the exoskeleton of crustaceans and insects, but they are also present in certain mushrooms (Roberts, 1992). Chitosan, the principal derivative of chitin, is usually obtained by alkaline deacetylation. The two types of polymers (chitin<br><br>
and chitosan) are differentiated by their solubility or insolubility in a dilute acid solution (Roberts, 1992).<br>
Chitosan has been the object of extensive studies in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields because of its favorable biological properties such as its nontoxicity (Knapczyk et al., 1984), its biocompatibility (Candy and Sharma, 1990; Hirano et al., 1991) and its biodegradability (Struszczyk et al, 1991). In the medical field, chitosan was described as possessing interesting pharmacological properties such as its cholesterol-reducing activity (Kobayashi et al., 1979), its cicatrizing properties (Balassa and Grove, 1972) and its antacid and antiulcer activities (Hillyard et al., 1964). Moreover, its polycationic nature confers on it the capacity to strongly associate itself with mammal cells thereby enabling potentialities of use for its hemostatic activity (Fradet et al., 1986) and its spermicidal activity (Smith, 1984).<br>
The molecular weight of the polysaccharides used in the invention was carefully selected so as to obtain homogeneous nanoparticles of a size sufficiently small to facilitate their administration. Thus, these polysaccharides, and most particularly chitosan or its derivatives, have a molecular mass lower than 100,000 Da, preferably lower than 30,000 Da. Chitosan of 5,000,10,000 and 30,000 Da was synthesized in the framework of the invention.<br>
As an example of chitosan derivatives, we can cite PEGylated chitosan, i.e., chitosan to which was grafted polyethylene glycol or chitosan functionalized with folic acid for targeting cancer cells.<br>
The delivery and vectorization system according to the invention makes it possible to modulate the delivery of the substance of interest as a function of the amount of positively charged polysaccharide in the nanoparticles. This charge modulation was impossible in the prior art because of the toxicity of the detergents like CTAB or the copolymers like DEAE dextran. Thus, in the<br><br><br>
system of the invention, the amount of polysaccharide is comprised between 0.1 and 1% in relation to the amount of polymer.<br>
The nanoparticles of the invention can also comprise at least one compound capable of complexing the substance of interest. This is, for example, a compound described in the French patent published as no. 2 775 435. The compound capable of complexing the active substance is advantageously a cyclic oligosaccharide, preferably a neutral or charged native cyclodextrin which is branched or polymerized or chemically modified. It can be a cyclodextrin modified chemically by substitution of one or more hydroxypropyls by alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or glycoside groups, or by esterification with alcohols or aliphatic acids.<br>
The vectorization and delivery system according to the invention is most particularly suitable for anionic substances of interest or substances comprising an anionic region. Thus, it can be a question of substances of interest that are not charged or are charged positively but modified so as to confer in totality or in part a negative charge enabling their association with the positively charged nanoparticles according to the invention. The substance of interest is affixed on the nanoparticles in a covalent or noncovalent manner.<br>
As examples, we can cite DNA or oligodeoxyribonucleotides or oligoribonucleotides notably antisense substances or interfering RNA (siRNA) or peptides, polypeptides or proteins and chemical compounds. Nucleic acids are anionic substances, but certain peptides, polypeptides and proteins are also anionic or comprise a negatively charged region. As examples of substances of interest capable of being associated with the nanoparticles of the invention, we can cite insulin, calcitonin and triptorelin at pH greater than their pHi.<br>
The nanoparticles according to the invention present a homogeneous diameter comprised between 10 and 300 nm as a function of the molecular<br><br><br>
weight of chitosan and the concentration used. The nanoparticles can be prepared by emulsion polymerization techniques (Couvreur et al., 1979) of the type described in French patent no. 2 775 435 as well as in the experimental part below.<br>
The invention has most particularly as object a method for the preparation of these nanoparticles comprising polymerization at an acid pH; greater than that of one of the monomers in the presence of the positively charged polysaccharide.<br>
The polysaccharide is preferably added at the beginning of polymerization and the acid pH is preferably greater than 3. According to an especially preferred form of implementation of this method, polymerization is performed in the presence of a polymerization retarder such as SO2 or hydroquinone, which affixes on the OH groups of the aqueous polymerization medium or the polysaccharide.<br>
By means of the above process, one obtains a suspension of nanoparticles of polymer and polysaccharide the positive charge of which is dependent on the amount of polysaccharide added. The amount of polysaccharide is advantageously comprised between 0.1 and 1% in relation to the weight of the suspension.<br>
The cationic substance of interest can be added at any moment of the above process. In fact, polymerization at an acid pH but with a value greater than 1 makes it possible to introduce even at the beginning of the process substances of interest sensitive to excessively acid pH values. The amount of substance of interest is advantageously comprised between 0.5 land 50% in relation to the weight of the suspension.<br>
The following process can be cited as a specific example:<br>
100 µl of polyisohexylcyanoacrylate containing 0 to 20,000 ppm of SO2 was added to a solution of citric acid (with a pH ranging from 1 to 5) containing 1% of nonionic surface-active agent, poloxamer 188, and optionally 0.5% of<br><br><br>
cyclodextrin and containing 0.2% of chitosan of low molecular weight (5000 or 10,000 Da).<br>
It should be remembered that the use of chitosan to obtain positively charged nanoparticles was already described in the prior art (Yang S. C. et al., 2000). However, the process of the prior art is performed at a very acid pH (pH 1) of the polymerization medium at which the active principles are not stable.<br>
In the method according to the present invention, the pH of the polymerization medium is comprised between 2.5 and 5, at which the active principles are stable. Furthermore, the method described by Yang S. C. et al. employs a chitosan of molecular weight higher than 30,000 Da. The use of chitosan of molecular weight greater than 10,000 Da exhibits toxicity (Richardson S. C. W. et al., 1999). In contrast, the nanoparticles according to the present invention comprise chitosan of low molecular weight (5000 and 10,000 Da), which moreover makes it possible to obtain nanoparticles presenting a monodisperse size distribution and thus greater tolerance.<br>
The method described by Yang S. C. et al. is limited by the concentration of chitosan present in the polymerization medium because at a concentration of chitosan lower than 0.25% the resultant nanoparticles are unstable. The method according to the invention produces stable nanoparticles at concentrations of chitosan lower than 0.25%.<br>
The vectorization and delivery system of a substance of interest according to the invention can present itself in the form of a suspension of nanoparticles or in the form of a lyophilizate of nanoparticles. It allow intravenous, oral or local administration without denaturing the substance of interest.<br>
Other advantages and characteristics of the invention will become apparent from the examples below concerning the preparation of nanoparticles    of    the    invention    and    their    capacity    to    transport<br><br><br>

Example I. Study of the comparative toxicity of chitosan of different molecular weights and CTAB on different cell lines<br>
1. Materials and methods<br>
The NIH 3T3 and NIH 3T3 EWS-Fli-1 (adherent cells) were sown on 6-well plates at 100,000 cells per well in their culture medium without puromycin and the IW35 cells (cells in suspension) in 12-well plates at the rate of 750,000 cells per well. Other cells in suspension CEM 4FX were also tested; they were sown at 10,000 cells per well in 96-well plates.<br>
For the first two cell types, the cells were sown 24 hours prior to their transfection. The medium was then eliminated and 100 pi of solution of the complex to be tested was brought into contact with the cells in 900 pi of medium.<br>
Different concentrations of CTAB and chitosan of various molecular weight were tested.<br>
Two controls were used and corresponded to the cells in the culture medium on the one hand and in the culture medium containing 100 pi of NaCl 150 mM on the other hand. After 24 hours of incubation, the measurements of cytotoxicity were performed by a test measuring the activity of the mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes of the living cells by oxidation of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; SIGMA) in formazan. The amount of formazan produced is directly proportional to the number of metabolically active live cells. The cells were washed with PBS and 1 ml of the medium was added. The cells were then incubated at 37°C with 100 pi of a solution of MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) for 3 hours. 1 ml of a lysis solution (10% SDS, 10 mM Tris) was then added to each<br><br><br>
well.    The cells were incubated at 37°C overnight.    The medium was homogenized and the optical density was read at 560 nm (Dynatech MRX).<br>
2. Results<br>
The toxicity of the different preparations on the different cells (NIH 3T3, NIH 3T3 EWS-Flil, IW 35 and CEM 4FX) is shown as a function of the concentration of positively charged molecules (figures 1-4). For the NIH 3T3 cells with and without EWS-Flil (adherent cells) (figures 1-2), there can be seen a notable toxicity of CTAB compared to chitosan of 5 or 10 kDa. Furthermore, chitosan 5 kDa is not toxic and stimulates the cellular viability.<br>
For the cells in suspension (IW35 and CEM 4FX) (figures 3 and 4), the two types of chitosan 5 and 10 kDa do not exhibit notable toxicity compared to CTAB which exhibits elevated toxicity at low concentrations.<br>
Example II. Formulation of positively charged nanoparticles in the presence of chitosan of different molecular weights<br>
The   nanoparticles   were   prepared   by   the   emulsion   polymerization<br>
technique (Couvreur et al., 1979).     100 ml of polyisohexylcyanoacrylate<br>
containing SO2 (Monorex®) was added to a solution of citric acid diluted to<br>
pH = 3 containing 1% of nonionic surface-active agent, poloxamer 188,<br>
containing or not containing 0.5% cyclodextrin and containing 0.2% chitosan<br>
of low molecular weight (5,000 or 10,000 Da). The duration of polymerization<br>
was 6 hours. After polymerization, the size was determined after dilution of<br>
the particles in MilliQ water and the zeta potential was determined after<br>
dilution of the particles in NaCl 1 mM.  Table 1 below presents the size and<br>
the zeta potential of the nanoparticles in relation to the molecular weight of<br>
the chitosan.<br><br>

Chitosan MW 5-10 kDa nanoparticles	60	15	0.065	+22<br>
The diameter of the particles does not vary as a function of the molecular weight of the chitosan. Irrespective of the MW of the chitosan used at the concentration of 0.2%, the resultant nanoparticles were very small and monodisperse as can be seen from the value of the polydispersity index.<br>
The zeta potential of these particles was positive and the charge was independent of the molecular weight of the chitosan.<br>
Example III. Study of the comparative toxicity of nanoparticles charged with chitosan and with CTAB<br>
1. Materials and methods<br>
CEM 4FX cells in suspension were sown at the rate of 10,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. Different concentrations of nanoparticles possessing positive charges from addition of CTAB or chitosan 5 kDa and 10 kDa were tested.<br>
Two controls were used and corresponded to the cells in the culture medium on the one hand and in the culture medium containing 100 ul of NaCl 150 mM on the other hand. After 24 hours of incubation, the measurements of cytotoxicity were performed by a test measuring the activity of the mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes of the living cells by oxidation of MTT in formazan. The amount of formazan produced is directly proportional to the number of metabolically active living cells. The cells were washed with PBS and 1 ml of the medium was added. The cells were then incubated at 37°C with 100 ul of a solution of MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) for 3 hours. 1 ml of a lysis solution (10% SDS, 10 mM Tris) was then added to each<br><br><br>
well.    The cells were incubated at 37°C overnight.    The medium was homogenized and the optical density was read at 560 nm (Dynatech MRX).<br>
2. Results<br>
On the CEM 4FX cell line, the nanoparticles of chitosan 5 and 10 kDa only exhibited toxicity starting at 10 ug/ml, whereas the nanoparticles charged with CTAB were toxic beginning at 1 µg/ml (figure 5).<br>
Example IV. Formulation of nanoparticles charged with oligonucleotides<br>
The oligonucleotides were negatively charged macromolecules capable of interacting with positively charged surfaces.<br>
We studied the formation of complexes of the chitosan nanoparticles with the antisense EF3008AS oligonucleotides.<br>
The antisense oligonucleotides are nucleic sequences capable of hybridizing selectively with target cell messenger RNAs so as to inhibit their translation into protein. These oligonucleotides form double-strand regions locally with the target mRNA by interactions of the classic Watson-Crick type.<br>
1. Materials and methods<br>
The mother solutions of nanoparticles (10 mg/ml) were diluted to the final concentration of 1 mg/ml in Tris-HCl buffer pH = 7 at 10 mM in final concentration. The adsorption of the oligonucleotides on the chitosan nanoparticles was performed in 150 mM of NaCl for 30 minutes at ambient temperature after having vortexed the solutions for approximately 30 seconds. The complexes were then incubated for 30 minutes at ambient temperature.<br>
The formation of CTAB-oligonucleotide nanoparticle complexes was performed in the presence of CTAB (at the level of 3 umoles of CTAB per 5 ug of nanoparticle) and oligonucleotides in 150 mM of NaCl. The oligonucleotides were adsorbed on the CTAB nanoparticles at the end of 2<br><br><br>
hours under agitation at ambient temperature. The preparation of the complexes was performed in a final volume of 200 µl.<br>
Different quantities of 30-mer oligonucleotides (EF3008AS) (20, 50, 100, 125,150 and 200 ug) were mixed with 100 ug of chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles and chitosan 5-10 kDa nanoparticles.<br>
The nanoparticles charged with oligonucleotides as well as the oligonucleotides alone were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm (Beckman Optima L80, rotor TW50, 1) for 30 minutes at 4°C. The quantity of oligonucleotide adsorbed on the nanoparticles was calculated by determining the amount of DNA released in the supernatants (figure 6).<br>
2. Results<br>
For the oligonucleotide/nanoparticle ratios of 0.2/1 and 0.5/1 there was obtained an adsorption of close to 100% of EF3008AS antisense oligonucleotides on the chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles. For the chitosan 5-10 kDa nanoparticles, there was obtained an adsorption of 100% for the oligonucleotide /nanoparticle ratio of 0.2/1; the adsorption percentage dropped to 80% at the oligonucleotide/nanoparticle ratio of 0.5/1. For these two oligonucleotide/nanoparticle ratios (0.2/1 and 0.5/1) the adsorption of oligonucleotides on the CTAB nanoparticles reached a maximum of 10%. It is important to note that for an oligonucleotide/nanoparticle ratio of 1/1 there was obtained a percentage of oligonucleotide adsorption of 80% with the chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles (figure 6).<br>
Example V. Study of the protection of the oligodeoxynucleotides adsorbed on the nanoparticles<br>
1. Materials and methods<br>
The integrity of the oligodeoxynucleotide EF3008AS alone and associated with chitosan nanoparticles was determined in 10% decomplemented neonatal calf serum. At different incubation times, samples of 15 ul were collected, mixed with the same volume of a formamide/water (4/1) solution,<br><br>
0.01% of bromophenol blue and 0.01% of xylene cyanol and frozen at -20°C. The nanoparticles were degraded by NaOH at pH = 12 for 2 hours at 37°C. The oligodeoxynucleotides were then recovered by a double extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1) and were then precipitated in 10 volumes of acetone containing 2% of lithium perchlorate for 30 minutes at -20°C.<br>
The oligodeoxynucleotides were then taken up again with 5 ml of formamide/water (4/1) solution, 0.01% of bromophenol blue and 0.01% of xylene cyanol, heated for 5 minutes at 95°C then put in the freezer. They were analyzed on a denaturing gel at 20% of polyacrylamide, 7M of urea and TBE IX. The gel was scanned by a photoimager (Storm 840, Molecular Dynamics). The degradation of the oligodeoxynucleotides was quantified by determining the ratio of the signal of the bands corresponding to the intact oligodeoxynucleotides and the degraded oligodeoxynucleotides.<br>
2. Results<br>
Figure 7 shows that there is a good protection of 30-mer oligodeoxynucleotides by the chitosan nanoparticles.<br>
Example VI. Transfection of human cells by chitosan nanoparticles charged with oligodeoxynucleotides<br>
1. Materials and methods<br>
a.	Preparation of the cells<br>
Human CEM4FX cells were used. 500,000 cells in suspension were sown in 12-well plates (TPP, Suisse) in 850 ul of an RPMI medium containing 10% of fetal calf serum (FCS).<br>
b.	Transfection of the cells<br>
150 ul of the suspension of nanoparticles prepared above was brought into contact with the cells for 24 hours.<br><br>
c. Fixation of the cells<br>
The cells were then fixed prior to performing a fluorescence observation. At the end of 24 hours of incubation of the cells in the presence of the nanoparticles, 1 ug of propidium iodide was added to each well which enabled recognition of the dead cells by staining them red.<br>
The cells were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was collected and the cells were washed once more with PBS. 200 µl of PBS containing 4% of formaldehyde was then added and the cells were left at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. The cells were then washed twice with PBS 0.1X. Another washing with sterile water was also performed to terminate. 20 µl of polylysine was added at the end. The observation of the cells was performed with a microscope equipped with a filter at 480 nm.<br>
2. Results<br>
Each of the observations of the figures 8, 9 and 10 was performed for the two types of oligonucleotides 7 bases and 11 bases.<br>
The cells in the presence of chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles-oligodeoxynucleotides were very fluorescent and no toxicity was visible. In the presence of the formulation chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles-Cyd-oligodeoxynucleotides, they were also fluorescent but multiple dead cells were visible.<br>
The formulation chitosan 10 kDa nanoparticles-Cyd-oligodeoxynucleotides also presented good fluorescence but also a slightly higher toxicity than the 5 kDa-Cyd-oligodeoxynucleotides nanoparticles. In the presence of 30 kDa-Cyd-oligodeoxynucleotides nanoparticles the cells were also very fluorescent but the number of dead cells was even higher than in the two preceding cases.<br>
In the case of the cells incubated in the presence of CTAB-Cyd-oligonucleotides, the fluorescence was weak and the toxicity was very high.<br><br><br>
The  complex CTAB-oligodeoxynucleotides  did not  exhibit  any  cellular fluorescence.<br>
In the case of the cells incubated in the presence of cytofectin-oligodeoxynucleotides no cellular fluorescence was observed.<br>
Example VII. Transfection in vitro of NIH-3T3 EWS-FIi1 cells by plasmid-chitosan nanoparticle complexes<br>
1.	Materials and methods<br>
a. Plasmid coupled to rhodamine<br>
10 pg of (3-galactosidase plasmid was tagged with a red fluorophore Oregon Green 546 (ULYSIS® Nucleic Acid Labeling Kits, Molecular Probes). This fluorophore yields a red fluorescence (Ex/Em est 555/570).<br>
1 pg of labeled plasmid and 3 pg of unlabeled plasmid were mixed with chitosan nanoparticles in 200 µl of NaCl at 15 pM and vortexed then incubated for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. The adherent NIH-3T3 EWS-Flil cells were sown in 6-well plates (TPP, Suisse) 24 hours prior to transfection so as to reach 70% confluence.<br>
Thirty minutes prior to transfection, the cells were washed with 2 ml of PBS IX per well then 800 µl of DMEM containing 2% of FCS was added to each well. The complexes (200 µl) were brought into contact with the NIH-33 EWS-Flil cells for 16 hours at 37°C. The images of the fluorescent cells are presented in the photograph (figures 11B and 11D).<br>
2.	Results<br>
Fluorescence of the cells was observed when they were coupled to the chitosan nanoparticles (figures 11B and 11D).<br>
Example VIII. Induction of the expression in vivo of fi-galactosidase by the plasmid pCMVp-gal vectorized by the chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles<br>
1. Materials and methods<br>
a. Treatment of the animals<br>
The EWS-Flil cells were obtained by transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with the<br>
oncogene EWS-Flil.   They were then cultured.  When the cells had reached<br><br>
70% confluence, they were put in suspension in PBS at the concentration of 6.5 • 106 cells/ml. The cells were then inoculated in nude mice via the subcutaneous route at a rate of 1.3 • 106 cells/mouse. Seven days after inoculation of the cells (the tumor had to be visible to the naked eye), the animals were treated either with 100 pi of chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles (60 ug) associated with 10 ug of plasmid pCMVp-gal or with 100 ul of plasmid pCMVp-gal (10 ug). Twenty-four hours after the treatment, the tumors were collected for histological study after immersion in Glyo-Fixx (Shandon).<br>
b. Detection of the expression of GFP in the tumor by the immunohistochemistry technique<br>
The tumor fragments were poured into paraffin and labeled by a solution<br>
of hematein-eosin-safranin.   The protein P-gal was detected on a section of<br>
tumor fragment of 4 µm by an anti-p-gal antibody (Clontech) (1:30) and<br>
monitored by the Power Vision Histostaining kit (ImmunoVision Technology,<br>
CA) after counter-labeling; the samples were observed by microscope (Zeiss)<br>
associated with a CDD Camera Imaging System (Sony).<br>
2. Results<br>
P-gal activity after 24 hours was seen solely when the animals were transfected with the plasmid pCMVp-gal associated with the chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles (figure 12B) while no P-gal activity was seen when the animals were transfected with the plasmid pCMVp-gal alone (figure 12A).<br>
Example IX. Intracellular penetration of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides vectorized by the chitosan 5 and 10 kDa nanoparticles in the NIH3T3 EWS/Fli-1 cells<br>
1. Materials and methods<br>
The NIH 3T3 EWS/Fli-1 cells were sown 24 h prior to their transfection in culture medium without puromycin in culture chambers mounted on plates (labtek® 4 wells, Nunc Inc.) at the rate of 100,000 cells per well. The cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 24 h in 400 ul of OPTl-MEMl medium<br><br>
supplemented with 2.5% of FCS, 100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 ug/ml of streptomycin in the presence of the different chitosan nanoparticle-oligodeoxynucleotides-FITC complexes in the mass ratios of 5:1,10:1 and 20:1. These complexes were prepared in NaCl 150 mM for a final volume of 100 ul. Two controls were used corresponding on the one hand to the cells incubated with free oligodeoxynucleotides AS-FITC (1 ug) and on the other hand to the cells incubated with 1 nmol of fluorescein (Aldrich). The penetration of the oligodeoxynucleotides AS-FITC into the cells was visualized by confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS NT device (Leica) mounted on an inverted Leica DM IRB/E microscope.<br>
2. Results<br>
No fluorescent cells were seen after their incubation with FITC alone and the non-vectorized AS-FITC oligodeoxynucleotides. The images of figure 13A and figure 13B present a field of cells incubated respectively with the complexes chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles: oligodeoxynucleotides AS-FITC and chitosan 10 kDa nanoparticles: oligodeoxynucleotides AS-FITC in the ratio (5:1). They show that the fluorescence is dispersed in the cytosol when the oligodeoxynucleotides-FITC are vectorized by the chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles and concentrated at the level of the nucleus in the case of chitosan 10 kDa nanoparticles. The curves of figures 14A and 14B present the sum of the intensities of the fluorescence recorded in the different planes Z of the cell. For a depth of 0 to 1 urn, the fluorescence is located at the level of the apical membrane in the cells. A depth of 8 to 9 µm corresponds to their basal membrane. Between 1 to 8 µm, the fluorescence is localized at the intracellular level. These curves show that for both types of chitosan nanoparticles at the chitosan nanoparticle: oligodeoxynucleotides ratio 5:1, the fluorescence is weakest at the level of the basal membrane of the cells as in the   apical  membrane   exposed   to   the   culture   medium  containing  the<br><br>
oligodeoxynucleotides-FITC. For both types of chitosan at the chitosan nanoparticles: oligodeoxynucleotides ratio (5:1), the fluorescence is primarily localized in the intracellular fraction. These curves confirm that the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides penetrate into the cells. The intensity of fluorescence in the interior of the cells is greater when the oligodeoxynucleotide-FITC is vectorized by chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles. The cellular localization of the fluorescence is the same for the (10:1) and (20:1) chitosan nanoparticles: oligodeoxynucleotides ratios as for the (5:1) ratio for both types of chitosan nanoparticles.<br>
Example X. Inhibition of tumor growth after intratumoral administration of chitosan nanoparticles to nude mice who had developed the subcutaneous form ofEwing's sarcoma<br>
1. Materials and methods<br>
Thirty-five female nude mice aged 6-8 weeks were irradiated at 5 gray. Twenty-four hours after the irradiation, the mice received via the subcutaneous route in the right flank 200 µl of a suspension of NIH 3T3 EWS-Fli cells at 5 • 106 cells/ml in PBS. The animals developed tumors at the end of 14-21 days. Four groups of 7 animals were constituted (PBS group, oligodeoxynucleotide EF3008AS group, chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles-oligodeoxynucleotide EF3008AS group and chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles-oligodeoxynucleotide control group. The groups were randomized and the treatment was begun when the tumor reached 2 mm3. The treatment consisted of 5 intratumoral administrations of the products at two-day intervals. The efficacy of the treatments was evaluated by measuring the tumor growth of the treated animals in relation to the controls. The tumor growth was evaluated by the tumor volume (TV). TV was calculated as follows: TV(mm3) = a2xb/2 in which a and b represent respectively the smallest and the largest diameter of the tumor. The statistical analysis of the<br><br><br>
results was performed with the Stat View® computer program (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, USA).<br>
2. Results<br>
The results of inhibition of tumor growth (figure 15) show an inhibition of the growth when the animals were treated with oligodeoxynucleotide EF3008AS and the chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles oligodeoxynucleotide EF3008AS. However, the inhibition of growth was greater when the animals were treated with the chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles oligodeoxynucleotide EF3008AS compared to the animals who received oligodeoxynucleotide EF3008AS. The control animals which received PBS or control chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles oligodeoxynucleotides exhibited only a slight inhibition of tumor growth.<br>
Example XI. Inhibition of tumor growth after intravenous administration of the treatment to mice which had developed the subcutaneous form of Ewing's sarcoma.<br>
1. Materials and methods<br>
Thirty-six female nude mice aged 6-8 weeks were irradiated at 5 gray. Twenty-four hours after the irradiation, the mice received by the subcutaneous route in the right flank 200 µl of a suspension of EWS-Flil cells at 5 • 106 cells/ml in PBS. The animals developed tumors at the end of 10-20 days. Six groups of 6 animals were constituted: chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticle oligodeoxynucleotide EF3008AS group (ON AS/NP), oligodeoxynucleotide EF3008AS (ON AS), control oligodeoxynucleotide (ON CON), chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticle oligodeoxynucleotide control group (ON CON/NP), chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles (NP) and NaCl at 0.9% (NaCl). The groups were randomized and the treatment was begun when the tumor reached 10-40 mm3. The treatment consisted of 5 intravenous administrations of the products at intervals of 2 or 3 days. The efficacy of the treatments was evaluated at the end of 15 days by the means of the ratios between the<br><br><br>
measurements of the tumor volume on day 14 and the measurements of the tumor volume on day 1 of the groups of treated animals in relation to the control groups. The tumor volume was calculated as in example X.<br>
2. Results<br>
The tumor growth results (figure 16) show an inhibition of the growth when the animals were treated with oligodeoxynucleotide EF3008AS (ON AS group) and the chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles oligodeoxynucleotides EF3008AS (ON AS/NP group). However, there was greater inhibition of the tumor growth when the animals were treated with chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles oligodeoxynucleotides EF3008AS (ON AS/NP group) compared to the animals who received the oligodeoxynucleotide EF3008AS without chitosan nanoparticles (ON AS group). The animals in the control groups which received NaCl, chitosan nanoparticles alone (NP group) or the control oligodeoxynucleotide with or without chitosan nanoparticles (ON CON/NP and ON CON groups respectively) exhibited only a slight inhibition of the tumor growth.<br>
Example XII. Inhibition of the expression of the protein GFP and inhibition of the expression of the mRNA of the protein GFP in vivo by siRNA vectorized by the nanoparticles.<br>
1. Materials and methods<br>
Adherent HeLa cells transfected with GFP (HeLa-GFP) in monolayer culture were collected when they reached 70% confluence and put back in suspension in PBS at the rate of 1  107 cells/ml. The cells were then administered via the subcutaneous route in the right flank of nude mice at the rate of 2 • 106 cells/mouse. Seven days after inoculation of the cells, the animals were distributed in different groups and treated by the intratumoral administration of different preparations in the following manner:<br>
Group 1 (100 ul of a preparation containing 10 ug of double strand GFP oligonucleotide target of siRNA), Group 2 (100 ul of control siRNA alone),<br><br>
Group 3 (100 µl of control siRNA vectorized with 10 ug of chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles), Group 4 (100 µl of antisense GFP oligonucleotide alone), Group 5 (100 µl of GFP antisense oligonucleotide vectorized by chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles). Twenty-four hours after the treatment, the tumors were collected and divided into two parts. The part intended for histological study was immersed in a solution of GlyoFixx (Shandon) and the part to be used for the Northern blot test was stored in liquid nitrogen.<br>
a.	Detection of the expression of GFP in the tumor by the<br>
immunohistochemistry technique<br>
The tumor fragments were poured into paraffin and labeled with a<br>
hematein-eosin-safranin solution. GFP was detected on a 4-um section by an<br>
anti-GFP antibody (Clontech) (1:30) and monitored by the Power Vision<br>
Histostaining kit (ImmunoVision Technology, CA) after counter-labeling; the<br>
samples were observed with a microscope (Zeiss) associated with a CDD<br>
Camera Imaging System (Sony).<br>
b.	Detection of the expression of the mRNA of GFP in the tumor by the<br>
Northern blot technique<br>
The tumor fragments were ground in a solution containing 400 pi of<br>
guanidium thiocyanate 4M, 25 mM of N citrate (pH 7), 0.5% of sarcosyl and<br>
0.1M of p-mercaptoethanol at 0°C.    After homogenization, the RNA was<br>
extracted in phenol as follows: 40 ul of solution of Na acetate 2M (pH 4) was<br>
added   to   400   µl   of   H2O   saturated   with   phenol   and   120   µl   of<br>
chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (49:1).  The mixture was centrifuged at 1300 rpm<br>
for 15 minutes. Then 300 µl of the aqueous phase was precipitated with 300<br>
µl of isopropanol at -20°C. The residue obtained in this manner was washed<br>
with ethanol 70%.   After drying the residue was taken up with 10 µl of<br>
distilled water.  Electrophoresis of 2 pg of total RNA was performed on agar<br>
gel 1% in MOPS buffer containing 6.3% of formaline.    The RNA was<br>
transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BA-S85, Schleicher &amp; Shuell) in<br><br>
an SSC buffer (10X). The mRNA of GFP was detected by the Northern blot technique with a fragment of cDNA of GFP of 770 pb labeled by α32-P dCTP 300 ci/mM (ICN, France) and Prime-a-gene labeling system (Promega). After washing, the nitrocellulose membrane was analyzed by the Storm 840 phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamic).<br>
2. Results<br>
Inhibition of the synthesis of GFP was seen solely when the siRNA was vectorized with chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles as shown in figure 17D. There was no evidence of inhibition of GFP in any of the other cases (figures 17 A, B, C and E). The antisense activity of siRNA vectorized by the chitosan 5 kDa nanoparticles was confirmed by the Northern blot technique. There can be seen an inhibition of the synthesis of mRNA of GFP of 50% at the end of 24 h when the siRNA was vectorized by the nanoparticles (figure 18). These results demonstrate that siRNA vectorized by the nanoparticles interferes with the gene of expression of GFP in vivo.<br><br>
