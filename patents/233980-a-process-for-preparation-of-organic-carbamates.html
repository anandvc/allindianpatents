				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of organic carbamates. This invention particularly relates to the preparation of carbamates of formula 1, wherein R is an alkyl group containing 1-16 carbon atoms or an aromatic group such as phenyl, naphthyl, phenathryl, or a heteroaromatic such as quinoline, benzopyrans, n is 1 to 16, R1 is a lower alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, amyl or a branched chain lower alkyl such as isopropyl, isoamyl, or a cycloalkyl containing 3 to 8 carbon atoms, or an alkylaryl such as benzyl, ethylphenyl or an aromatic group such as phenyl, substituted phenyl, naphthyl.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Organic carbamates find use as intermediates in organic synthesis as blocking groups (Greene, T.W., Wuts, PGM. Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed. John Wiley and Sons Inc. New York 1991, p315, in combinatorial chemistry (PoZo, M., Gotor, V. Tetrahedron 1993, 49, 4321-4326).<br>
Synthesis of carbamates has been described by direct alcoholysis of phosgene<br>
and its derivatives (Satchell, S, Chem. Rev. 1975, 4, 231) anubiktsus if<br>
cgkirifimates (Rabcgerm H, Synthetic Commun. 1985, 15, 1025) and alcoholysis<br>
of isocyanates (Entelis, N, Russ. Chem. Rev. 1966, 35, 917-950) as shown in<br>
equations 1 and 2 respectively.	(Formula Removed)<br><br>
In all these above processes,  highly toxic and  harmful  reagents such as phosgene or its derivative are used.<br>
In the recent past carbon dioxide, a cheap and harmless reagent has been used for carbamate synthesis (Aresta, M. Quranta, E. Tetrahedron 1992, 48, 1515-<br><br>
 1530; Inesi, A, Muccinate, V;Rossi,LJ.Org.Chem, 1998 63, 1337-1338) utilizing<br>
alkyl halides as starting material.<br>
The main objective of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
organic carbamtes.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a convenient, economical<br>
method avoiding use of hazardous material.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of<br>
carbamate of formula 1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Wherein R is an alkyl group containing 1-16 carbon atoms or an aromatic group such as phenyl, naphthyl, phenathryl, or a heteroaromatic such as quinoline, benzopyrans, n is 1 to 16, R1 is a lower alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, amyl or a branched chain lower alkyl such as isopropyl, isoamyl, or a cycloalkyl containing 3 to 8 carbon atoms, or an alkylaryl such as benzyl, ethylphenyl or an aromatic group such as phenyl, substituted phenyl, naphthyl, which comprises; reacting a tosyl ester of formula II<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Wherein R is as defined above in formula 1 and n is 1-16 with an amine of<br>
formula III,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Wherein R1 is selected from a group consisting of a lower alkyl, branched chain lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, an alkylaryl, or an aryl group as defined above for the formula 1 in an organic aprotic solvent selected from dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF) acetonitrile, hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) in presence of CO2/metal carbonate selected from K2CO3 Na2CO3, in presence of a base selected from tetrabutylammonium   iodide   (TBAI),   benzyltrimethylammonium   hydroxide<br><br>
(Triton B), at a temperature ranging between 50-120°C for a period ranging<br>
between 3-7 hrs, diluting the reaction mixture with water, extracting with<br>
water-immicible organic solvent as herein described and removing the solvent<br>
to get the desired carbamate.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the aprotic organic solvent used may be<br>
selected    from    dimethylsulphoxide    (DMSO),    dimethylformamide    (DMF)<br>
acetonitrile, hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA).<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the aprotic solvent used may be preferably dimethylsulphoxide for alkylamines.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention aprotic solvent used  may be preferably HMPA for aromatic amines.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention the metal carbonate used may be selected from Na2CO3, K2CO3.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention a preferred base used may be TBA for alkylamines.<br>
In further embodiment of the invention a preferred base used may be Triton B for aromatic amines.<br>
In still embodiment of the embodiment of the invention the preferred temperature used may be ranging between 80 to 120°C.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention extraction of carbamtes may be carried out using organic solvent selected from benzene, toluene, ethyl acetate.<br><br>
The starting tosylate esters were prepared from corresponding alcohols, by<br>
reacting with p-toluene sulphonyl chloride following known routes.<br>
Organic carbamates may be prepared by reacting the tosylate ester with alkyl<br>
amine in an aprotic solvent in presence of metal carbonate and a base and<br>
CC/2 at a temperature ranging between 50 to 120°C.<br>
