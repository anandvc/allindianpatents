THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
'A'-PYRROLINES AS PESTICIDES'<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a German company of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
GRANTED<br>
19-1-2007<br><br>
The present invention relates to A1-pyrrolines, to a plurality of processes for their preparation and to their use as pesticides.<br>
Hitherto, only a few 4-substituted 2,5-bis-aryl-A1-pyrrolines have been disclosed:<br><br>
10	It is not known whether they are suitable for use as pesticides.<br>
WO 00/21958, WO 99/59968, WO 99/59967 and WO 98/22438 disclose other A'-pyrrolines and the fact that they are suitable for use as pesticides.<br><br><br>
However, the efficacy and/or duration of action of these prior-art compounds, in particular against certain organisms and/or at low application rates, is not entirely satisfactory in all areas of use.<br><br>
10<br><br>
Owing to the multifarious requirements that modern pesticides have to meet, for example with respect to efficacy, duration of action, activity spectrum, use spectrum, toxicity, combination with other active compounds, combination with formulation auxiliaries or synthesis, and owing to the possible occurrence of resistance, however, the development of such substances can never be considered to be concluded, and there is a permanent great need for novel compounds which offer advantages over the known compounds, at least in some respects.<br><br>

All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can  be plants which can be obtained by<br>
30	conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and<br>
recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant<br><br><br>
breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of<br>
plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples<br>
which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies,<br>
fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested<br>
5	material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings,<br>
tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active<br>
compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the<br>
10	surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for<br>
example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
15	The active compounds can be converted to the customary formulations, such as<br>
solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
20	These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active<br>
compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam-formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ for example organic solvents<br>
25	as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene,<br>
toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions,<br>
mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and<br>
30	esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or<br>
cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water.<br><br>
As solid carriers there are suitable:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc,<br>
chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic<br>
5	minerals, such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates; as solid carriers for<br>
granules there are suitable: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks;<br>
10<br>
as emulsifiers and/or foam-formers there are suitable: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and also protein hydrolysates;<br>
15<br>
as dispersants there are suitable: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
20	form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
25	It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
30	The formulations generally comprise between 0.1  and 95% by weight of active<br>
compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br><br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as such or in their<br>
formulations, as a mixture with other known active compounds, such as insecticides,<br>
attractants, sterilizing agents, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth-<br>
regulating substances or herbicides, for example to widen the activity spectrum or to<br>
5	prevent the development of resistance. In many cases, synergistic effects are obtained,<br>
i.e. the activity of the mixture is higher than the activity of the individual components. The insecticides include, for example, phosphoric acid esters, carbamates, carboxylates, chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenylureas and substances produced by microorganisms, inter alia. 10<br>

30	It is also possible to admix other known active compounds, such as herbicides,<br>
fertilizers and growth regulators.<br><br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can<br>
furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use<br>
forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents.<br>
Synergistic agents are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds<br>
5	according to the invention, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added<br>
to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially<br>
available   formulations   can   vary   within   wide   limits.   The   active   compound<br>
10	concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active<br>
compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
15	When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound<br>
is distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as a good stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according<br>
20	to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or<br>
those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or<br>
protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment,<br>
transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate<br>
in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and<br>
25	parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has<br>
been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably,  plants  of the  plant cultivars  which  are  in  each  case<br>
commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant<br>
30	cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having certain properties ("traits")<br>
which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by genetic engineering. These can be cultivars, bio- or geotypes.<br><br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth<br>
conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the<br>
invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example,<br>
5	reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an<br>
increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to<br>
the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures,<br>
increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering<br>
performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better<br>
10	quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage<br>
stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering)<br>
15	which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which,<br>
in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful traits to these plants. Examples of such traits are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier<br>
20	harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a<br>
higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such traits are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses,<br>
25	and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds.<br>
Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape.<br>
30	Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against<br>
insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a),<br><br>
CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryHA, CrylllA, CryIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF<br>
and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that<br>
are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants against fungi,<br>
bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexius,<br>
5	elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins.<br>
Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination<br>
10	with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be<br>

Industrial materials in the present connection are to be understood as meaning non-<br>
5	living materials, such as, preferably, plastics, adhesives, sizes, papers and cards,<br>
leather, wood and processed wood products and coating compositions.<br>
Wood and processed wood products are materials to be protected, especially preferably, from insect infestation. 10<br>
Wood and processed wood products which can be protected by the agents according to the invention or mixtures comprising these are to be understood as meaning, for example:<br>
15	building timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, boat jetties,<br>
wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telegraph poles, wood panelling, wooden windows and doors, plywood, chipboard, joinery or wooden products which are used quite generally in house-building or in building joinery.<br>
20	The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or in<br>
generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example<br>
25	by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier,<br>
dispersing agent and/or binder or fixing agent, a water repellent, if appropriate siccatives and UV stabilizers and if appropriate dyestuffs and pigments, and also other processing auxiliaries.<br>
30	The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the preservation of wood and<br>
wood-derived timber products comprise the active compound according to the<br>
/9<br><br>
invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the nature and<br>
5	occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum amount employed can be<br>
determined for the use in each case by a series of tests. In general, however, it is sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be preserved.<br>
10	Solvents and/or diluents which are used are an organic chemical solvent or solvent<br>
mixture and/or an oily or oil-like organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water, and if appropriate an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
15	Organic chemical solvents which are preferably used are oily or oil-like solvents<br>
having an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C. Substances which are used as such oily or oil-like water-insoluble solvents of low volatility are appropriate mineral oils or aromatic fractions thereof, or solvent mixtures containing mineral oils, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or<br>
20	alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils having a boiling range from 170 to 220°C, white spirit having a boiling<br>
range from 170 to 220°C, spindle oil having a boiling range from 250 to 350°C,<br>
petroleum and aromatics having a boiling range from 160 to 280°C, turpentine oil<br>
25	and the like, are advantageously employed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from<br>
180 to 210°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons having<br>
a boiling range from 180 to 220°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene,<br>
30	preferably a-monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br><br>
The organic oily or oil-like solvents of low volatility which have an evaporation<br>
number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be<br>
replaced in part by organic chemical solvents of high or medium volatility, provided<br>
that the solvent mixture likewise has an evaporation number above 35 and a<br>
5	flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide<br>
mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, some of the organic chemical solvent or<br>
solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organic chemical solvent or solvent<br>
10	mixture. Aliphatic organic chemical solvents containing hydroxyl and/or ester and/or<br>
ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like, are preferably used.<br>
Organic chemical binders which are used in the context of the present invention are<br>
15	the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se, are water-<br>
dilutable and/or are soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the organic chemical<br>
solvents employed, in particular binders consisting of or comprising an acrylate resin,<br>
a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or<br>
polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenolic<br>
20	resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene-cumarone resin, silicone resin, drying<br>
vegetable oils and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion,<br>
25	dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders<br>
in an amount of up to 10% by weight. Dyestuffs, pigments, water-repelling agents, odour correctants and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like which are known per se can additionally be employed.<br>
30	It is preferred according to the invention for the composition or concentrate to<br>
comprise, as the organic chemical binder, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more than<br><br>
45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight, are preferably used according to the invention.<br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a<br>
5	plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the<br>
active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as<br>
dibutyl, dioctyl or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as tributyl<br>
10	phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as<br>
butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic acid esters.<br>
Fixing agents are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example,<br>
15	polyvinyl methyl ether or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Possible solvents or diluents are, in particular, also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organic chemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersing agents. 20<br>
Particularly effective preservation of wood is achieved by impregnation processes on a large industrial scale, for example vacuum, double vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
The ready-to-use compositions can also comprise other insecticides, if appropriate,<br>
25	and also one or more fungicides, if appropriate.<br>

octyIisothiazolin-3-one.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can at the same time be employed for<br>
protecting objects which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, such as<br>
10	hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling systems, against fouling.<br>
Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from<br>
the Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum<br>
species, or by species from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as<br>
15	Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional drag of ships and, as a<br>
consequence, leads to a marked increase in operational costs owing to higher energy consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling<br>
20	by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia<br>
(cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance.<br>

30	The preparation and use of the substances according to the invention are illustrated<br>
by the examples below.<br><br>
Preparation Examples<br><br><br><br><br>
(vm-b-i)<br><br>
With stirring, a solution of 63.5 g (0.50 mol) of oxalyl chloride in 50 ml  of<br>
10	dichloromethane is added dropwise to a mixture of 100.5 g (0.50 mol) of 4-<br>
bromobenzoic acid, 1 ml of dimethylformamide and 1200 ml of dichloromethane.<br>
After 4 hours of stirring and once the evolution of gas (HC1, CO, C02) has ceased,<br>
the mixture is cooled under argon to -60°C, and a mixture of 70.8 g (0.50 mol) of<br>
2-chlorobenzylamine and 161.0 g (1.25 mol) of N,N-diisopropylethylamine is added<br>
15	dropwise over a period of 10 minutes. The mixture is stirred overnight and the<br>
resulting yellow solution is washed successively three times with in each case 250 ml<br>
of 2N hydrochloric acid, once with 300 ml of water and once with 300 ml of<br>
saturated sodium chloride solution. Drying of the organic phase over sodium sulphate<br>
and evaporation to dryness gives a residue which is stirred at room temperature with<br>
20	200 ml of dichloromethane and then filtered off with suction. The resulting residue is<br>
taken up in 200 ml of methyl tert-butyl ether, heated briefly to the boil, allowed to<br>
cool and once again filtered off with suction.<br>
This gives  108 g (83% of theory) of 4-bromo-N-(2-chlorobenzyl)benzamide of melting point 133°C.<br>
25<br><br><br>
Synthesis step 2:<br><br>
A mixture of 106.4 g (0.34 mol) of the compound (VIII-b-1) and 200 ml of thionyl<br>

chloride is removed under reduced pressure. The resulting yellow oil crystallizes on brief standing at room temperature.<br>
This    gives     112.5 g    (97%     of    theory)    of    4-bromo-N-(2-chlorobenzyl)-phenylcarboximidoyl chloride of melting point 58-61°C. 10<br>

15	with exclusion of light and air, allowed to stand at room temperature for 7d. The<br>
mixture is then washed three times with 100 ml of 2N hydrochloric acid, once with 100 ml of water and once with 100 ml of concentrated sodium chloride solution. The mixture is dried over sodium sulphate and then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure,  and the residue  is chromatographed repeatedly on  silica gel  using<br>
20	dichloromethane/cyclohexane.<br>

10	phase is then extracted to exhaustion with methyl tert-butyl ether. The combined<br>
organic phases are dried over sodium sulphate and evaporated to dryness under<br>
reduced pressure. Crystallization from dichloromethane/methyl tert-butyl ether gives<br>

then extracted to exhaustion with methyl tert-butyl ether. The combined organic<br>
5	phases are dried over sodium sulphate and evaporated to dryness under reduced<br>
pressure. Chromatography of the resulting residue on silica gel using the mobile phase cyclohexane/ethyl acetate gives the desired product.<br>
