TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00100] The present invention relates to modulators of ATP-Binding Cassette<br>
("ABC") transporters or fragments thereof, including Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane<br>
Conductance Regulator ("CFTR"), compositions thereof, and methods therewith. The present<br>
invention also relates to methods of treating ABC transporter mediated diseases using such<br>
modulators.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00101] ABC transporters are a family of membrane transporter proteins that regulate<br>
the transport of a wide variety of pharmacological agents, potentially toxic drugs, and<br>
xenobiotics, as well as anions. ABC transporters are homologous membrane proteins that bind<br>
and use cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for their specific activities. Some of these<br>
transporters were discovered as multidrug resistance proteins (like the MDR1-P glycoprotein,<br>
or the multidrug resistance protein, MRP 1), defending malignant cancer cells against<br>
chemotherapeutic agents. To date, 48 ABC Transporters have been identified and grouped into<br>
7 families based on their sequence identity and function.<br>
[00102] ABC transporters regulate a variety of important physiological roles within<br>
the body and provide defense against harmful environmental compounds. Because of this, they<br>
represent important potential drug targets for the treatment of diseases associated with defects<br>
in the transporter, prevention of drug transport out of the target cell, and intervention in other<br>
diseases in which modulation of ABC transporter activity may be beneficial.<br>
[00103] One member of the ABC transporter family commonly associated with<br>
disease is the cAMP/ATP-mediated anion channel, CFTR. CFTR is expressed in a variety of<br>
cells types, including absorptive and secretory epithelia cells, where it regulates anion flux<br>
across the membrane, as well as the activity of other ion channels and proteins. In epithelia<br>
cells, normal functioning of CFTR is critical for the maintenance of electrolyte transport<br>
throughout the body, including respiratory and digestive tissue. CFTR is composed of<br>
approximately 1480 amino acids that encode a protein made up of a tandem repeate of<br>
transmembrane domains, each containing six transmembrane helices and a nucleotide binding<br><br>
domain. The two transmembrane domains are linked by a large, polar, regulatory (R)-domain<br>
with multiple phosphorylation sites that regulate channel activity and cellular trafficking.<br>
[00104] The gene encoding CFTR has been identified and sequenced (See Gregory, R.<br>
J. et al. (1990) Nature 347:382-386; Rich, D. P. et al. (1990) Nature 347:358-362), (Riordan, J.<br>
R. et al. (1989) Science 245:1066-1073). A defect in this gene causes mutations in CFTR<br>
resulting in Cystic Fibrosis ("CF"), the most common fatal genetic disease in humans. Cystic<br>
Fibrosis affects approximately one in every 2,500 infants in the United States. Within the<br>
general United States population, up to 10 million people carry a single copy of the defective<br>
gene without apparent ill effects. In contrast, individuals with two copies of the CF associated<br>
gene suffer from the debilitating and fatal effects of CF, including chronic lung disease.<br>
[00105] In patients with cystic fibrosis, mutations in CFTR endogenously expressed in<br>
respiratory epithelia leads to reduced apical anion secretion causing an imbalance in ion and<br>
fluid transport. The resulting decrease in anion transport contributes to enhanced mucus<br>
accumulation in the lung and the accompanying microbial infections that ultimately cause death<br>
in CF patients. In addition to respiratory disease, CF patients typically suffer from<br>
gastrointestinal problems and pancreatic insufficiency that, if left untreated, results in death. In<br>
addition, the majority of males with cystic fibrosis are infertile and fertility is decreased among<br>
females with cystic fibrosis. In contrast to the severe effects of two copies of the CF associated<br>
gene, individuals with a single copy of the CF associated gene exhibit increased resistance to<br>
cholera and to dehydration resulting from diarrhea - perhaps explaining the relatively high<br>
frequency of the CF gene within the population.<br>
[00106] Sequence analysis of the CFTR gene of CF chromosomes has revealed a<br>
variety of disease causing mutations (Cutting, G. R. et al. (1990) Nature 346:366-369; Dean,<br>
M. et al. (1990) Cell 61:863:870; and Kerem, B-S. et al. (1989) Science 245:1073-1080;<br>
Kerem, B-S et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:8447-8451). To date, &gt; 1000 disease<br>
causing mutations in the CF gene have been identified rhttp:///vt'^-w.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/).<br>
The most prevalent mutation is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of the CFTR amino<br>
acid sequence, and is commonly referred to as AF508-CFTR. This mutation occurs in<br>
approximately 70% of the cases of cystic fibrosis and is associated with a severe disease.<br>
[00107] The deletion of residue 508 in AF508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein<br>
from folding correctly. This results in the inability of the mutant protein to exit the<br>
endoplasmic reticulum ("ER"), and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, the number of<br>
channels present in the membrane is far less than observed in cells expressing wild-type CFTR.<br><br><br>
In addition to impaired trafficking, the mutation results in defective channel gating. Together,<br>
the reduced number of channels in the membrane and the defective gating lead to reduced anion<br>
transport across epithelia leading to defective ion and fluid transport. (Quinton, P. M. (1990),<br>
FASEB J. 4: 2709-2727). Studies have shown, however, that the reduced numbers of AF5O8-<br>
CFTR in the membrane are functional, albeit less than wild-type CFTR. (Dalemans et al.<br>
(1991), Nature Lond. 354: 526-528; Denning et al., supra; Pasyk and Foskett (1995), J. Cell.<br>
Biochem. 270: 12347-50). In addition to AF508-CFTR, other disease causing mutations in<br>
CFTR that result in defective trafficking, synthesis, and/or channel gating could be up- or<br>
down-regulated to alter anion secretion and modify disease progression and/or severity.<br>
[00108] Although CFTR transports a variety of molecules in addition to anions, it is<br>
clear that this role (the transport of anions) represents one element in an important mechanism<br>
of transporting ions and water across the epithelium. The other elements include the epithelial<br>
Na+ channel, ENaC, Na+/2C17K+ co-transporter, Na+-K+-ATPase pump and the basolateral<br>
membrane K+ channels, that are responsible for the uptake of chloride into the cell.<br>
[00109] These elements work together to achieve directional transport across the<br>
epithelium via their selective expression and localization within the cell. Chloride absorption<br>
takes place by the coordinated activity of ENaC and CFTR present on the apical membrane and<br>
the Na+-K+-ATPase pump and Cl- channels expressed on the basolateral surface of the cell.<br>
Secondary active transport of chloride from the luminal side leads to the accumulation of<br>
intracellular chloride, which can then passively leave the cell via Cl" channels, resulting in a<br>
vectorial transport. Arrangement of Na+/2C17K+ co-transporter, Na+-K+-ATPase pump and the<br>
basolateral membrane K+ channels on the basolateral surface and CFTR on the luminal side<br>
coordinate the secretion of chloride via CFTR on the luminal side. Because water is probably<br>
never actively transported itself, its flow across epithelia depends on tiny transepithelial<br>
osmotic gradients generated by the bulk flow of sodium and chloride.<br>
[00110] In addition to Cystic Fibrosis, modulation of CFTR activity may be beneficial<br>
for other diseases not directly caused by mutations in CFTR, such as secretory diseases and<br>
other protein folding diseases mediated by CFTR. These include, but are not limited to,<br>
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dry eye disease, and Sjogren's Syndrome.<br>
[00111] COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is progressive and not fully<br>
reversible. The airflow limitation is due to mucus hypersecretion, emphysema, and<br>
bronchiolitis. Activators of mutant or wild-type CFTR offer a potential treatment of mucus<br>
hypersecretion and impaired mucociliary clearance that is common in COPD. Specifically,<br><br>
increasing anion secretion across CFTR may facilitate fluid transport into the airway surface<br>
liquid to hydrate the mucus and optimized periciliary fluid viscosity. This would lead to<br>
enhanced mucociliary clearance and a reduction in the symptoms associated with COPD. Dry<br>
eye disease is characterized by a decrease in tear aqueous production and abnormal tear film<br>
lipid, protein and mucin profiles. There are many causes of dry eye, some of which include age,<br>
Lasik eye surgery, arthritis, medications, chemical/thermal burns, allergies, and diseases, such<br>
as cystic fibrosis and Sjogrens's syndrome. Increasing anion secretion via CFTR would<br>
enhance fluid transport from the corneal endothelial cells and secretory glands surrounding the<br>
eye to increase corneal hydration. This would help to alleviate the symptoms associated with<br>
dry eye disease. Sjogrens's syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system<br>
attacks moisture-producing glands throughout the body, including the eye, mouth, skin,<br>
respiratory tissue, liver, vagina, and gut. Symptoms, include, dry eye, mouth, and vagina, as<br>
well as lung disease. The disease is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus,<br>
systemic sclerosis, and polymypositis/dermatomyositis. Defective protein trafficking is<br>
believed to cause the disease, for which treatment options are limited. Modulators of CFTR<br>
activity may hydrate the various organs afflicted by the disease and help to elevate the<br>
associated symptoms.<br>
[00112] As discussed above, it is believed that the deletion of residue 508 in AF508-<br>
CFTR prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly, resulting in the inability of this<br>
mutant protein to exit the ER, and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, insufficient<br>
amounts of the mature protein are present at the plasma membrane and chloride transport<br>
within epithelial tissues is significantly reduced. In fact, this cellular phenomenon of defective<br>
ER processing of ABC transporters by the ER machinery, has been shown to be the underlying<br>
basis not only for CF disease, but for a wide range of other isolated and inherited diseases. The<br>
two ways that the ER machinery can malfunction is either by loss of coupling to ER export of<br>
the proteins leading to degradation, or by the ER accumulation of these defective/misfolded<br>
proteins [Aridor M, et al., Nature Med., 5(7), pp 745- 751 (1999); Shastry, B.S., et al,<br>
Neurochem. International, 43, pp 1-7 (2003); Rutishauser, I, et al, Swiss Med Wkly, 132, pp<br>
211-222 (2002); Morello, JP et al, TIPS, 21, pp. 466- 469 (2000); Bross P., et al, Human<br>
Mut, 14, pp. 186-198 (1999)]. The diseases associated with the first class of ER malfunction<br>
are cystic fibrosis (due to misfolded AF508-CFTR as discussed above), hereditary emphysema<br>
(due to al-antitrypsin; non Piz variants), hereditary hemochromatosis, coagulation-fibrinolysis<br>
deficiencies, such as protein C deficiency, Type 1 hereditary angioedema, lipid processing<br>
deficiencies, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, Type 1 chylomicronemia,<br><br>
abetalipoproteinemia, lysosomal storage diseases, such as I-cell disease/pseudo-Hurler,<br>
mucopolysaccharidoses (due to lysosomal processing enzymes), Sandhof/Tay-Sachs (due to p-<br>
hexosaminidase), Crigler-Najjar type II (due to UDP-glucuronyl-sialyc-transferase),<br>
polyendocrinopathy/hyperinsulemia, diabetes mellitus (due to insulin receptor), Laron<br>
dwarfism (due to growth hormone receptor), myleoperoxidase deficiency, primary<br>
hypoparathyroidism (due to preproparathyroid hormone), melanoma (due to tyrosinase). The<br>
diseases associated with the latter class of ER malfunction are glycanosis CDG type 1,<br>
hereditary emphysema (due to ocl-antitrypsin (PiZ variant), congenital hyperthyroidism,<br>
osteogenesis imperfecta (due to Type I, II, IV procollagen), hereditary hypofibrinogenemia<br>
(due to fibrinogen), ACT deficiency (due to al-antichymotrypsin), diabetes insipidus (DI),<br>
neurophyseal DI (due to vasopvessin hormone/V2-receptor), neprogenic DI (due to aquaporin<br>
IT), Charcot-Marie Tooth syndrome (due to peripheral myelin protein 22), Perlizaeus-<br>
Merzbacher disease, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease ( due to (3APP and<br>
presenilins), Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive supranuclear plasy,<br>
Pick's disease, several polyglutamine neurological disorders such as Huntington,<br>
spinocerebullar ataxia type I, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubal pallidoluysian,<br>
and myotonic dystrophy, as well as spongiform encephalopathies, such as hereditary<br>
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (due to prion protein processing defect), Fabry disease (due to<br>
lysosomal a-galactosidase A), Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary<br>
disease (COPD), dry eye disease, and Sjogren's Syndrome.<br>
[00113] In addition to up-regulation of CFTR activity, reducing anion secretion by<br>
CFTR modulators may be beneficial for the treatment of secretory diarrheas, in which epithelial<br>
water transport is dramatically increased as a result of secretagogue activated chloride<br>
transport. The mechanism involves elevation of cAMP and stimulation of CFTR.<br>
[00114] Although there are numerous causes of diarrhea, the major consequences of<br>
diarrheal diseases, resulting from excessive chloride transport are common to all, and include<br>
dehydration, acidosis, impaired growth and death.<br>
[00115] Acute and chronic diarrheas represent a major medical problem in many areas<br>
of the world. Diarrhea is both a significant factor in malnutrition and the leading cause of death<br>
(5,000,000 deaths/year) in children less than five years old.<br>
[00116] Secretory diarrheas are also a dangerous condition in patients of acquired<br>
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Sixteen<br>
million travelers to developing countries from industrialized nations every year develop<br><br>
diarrhea, with the severity and number of cases of diarrhea varying depending on the country<br>
and area of travel.<br>
[00117] Diarrhea in barn animals and pets such as cows, pigs and horses, sheep, goats,<br>
cats and dogs, also known as scours, is a major cause of death in these animals. Diarrhea can<br>
result from any major transition, such as weaning or physical movement, as well as in response<br>
to a variety of bacterial or viral infections and generally occurs within the first few hours of the<br>
animal's life.<br>
[00118] The most common diarrheal causing bacteria is enterotoxogenic E-coli<br>
(ETEC) having the K99 pilus antigen. Common viral causes of diarrhea include rotavirus and<br>
coronavirus. Other infectious agents include cryptosporidium, giardia lamblia, and salmonella,<br>
among others.<br>
[00119] Symptoms of rotaviral infection include excretion of watery feces,<br>
dehydration and weakness. Coronavirus causes a more severe illness in the newborn animals,<br>
and has a higher mortality rate than rotaviral infection. Often, however, a young animal may be<br>
infected with more than one virus or with a combination of viral and bacterial microorganisms<br>
at one time. This dramatically increases the severity of the disease.<br>
[00120] Accordingly, there is a need for modulators of an ABC transporter activity,<br>
and compositions thereof, that can be used to modulate the activity of the ABC transporter in<br>
the cell membrane of a mammal.<br>
[00121] There is a need for methods of treating ABC transporter mediated diseases<br>
using such modulators of ABC transporter activity.<br>
[00122] There is a need for methods of modulating an ABC transporter activity in an<br>
ex vivo cell membrane of a mammal.<br>
[00123] There is a need for modulators of CFTR activity that can be used to modulate<br>
the activity of CFTR in the cell membrane of a mammal.<br>
[00124] There is a need for methods of treating CFTR-mediated diseases using such<br>
modulators of CFTR activity.<br>
[00125] There is a need for methods of modulating CFTR activity in an ex vivo cell<br>
membrane of a mammal.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00126] It has now been found that compounds of this invention, and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof, are useful as modulators of ABC transporter<br>

compounds as described herein, and optionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,<br>
adjuvant or vehicle. In certain embodiments, these compositions optionally further comprise<br>
one or more additional therapeutic agents.<br>
[00235] It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present invention<br>
can exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative thereof. According to the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative<br>
includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, salts of such esters, or<br>
any other adduct or derivative which upon administration to a patient in need is capable of<br>
providing, directly or indirectly, a compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or<br>
residue thereof.<br>
[00236] As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those<br>
salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with<br>
the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and<br>
the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. A "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt" means any non-toxic salt or salt of an ester of a compound of this invention<br>
that, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a<br>
compound of this invention or an inhibitorily active metabolite or residue thereof. As used<br>
herein, the term "inhibitorily active metabolite or residue thereof means that a metabolite or<br>
residue thereof is also an inhibitor of an ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters.<br><br>
[00237] Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S.<br>
M. Berge, et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 1977, 66, 1-19, incorporated herein by reference. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
of the compounds of this invention include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic<br>
acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are<br>
salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic<br>
acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic<br>
acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using<br>
other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>

[00244] The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on<br>
the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular<br>
agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The compounds of the invention are preferably<br>
formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The<br>
expression "dosage unit form" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of agent<br>
appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily<br>
usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the<br>
attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective dose<br>
level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the<br>
disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound<br>
employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and<br>
diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of<br>
the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or<br>
coincidental with the specific compound employed, and like factors well known in the medical<br>
arts. The term "patient", as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most<br>
preferably a human.<br>
[00245] The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be<br>
administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally,<br>
intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an<br>
oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In<br>
certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or<br>
parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about<br><br>
1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain<br>
the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
[00246] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and<br>
elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents<br>
commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and<br>
emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl<br>
alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in<br>
particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol,<br>
tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting<br>
agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
[00247] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous<br>
suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting<br>
agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable<br>
solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for<br>
example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may<br>
be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In<br>
addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium.<br>
For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or<br>
diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
[00248] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration<br>
through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile<br>
solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile<br>
injectable medium prior to use.<br>
[00249] In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is<br>
often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular<br>
injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or<br>
amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then<br>
depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline<br>
form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is<br>
accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot<br>
forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable<br><br>
polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer<br>
and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be<br>
controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and<br>
poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound<br>
in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.<br>
[00250] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories<br>
which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating<br>
excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are<br>
solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or<br>
vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
[00251] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills,<br>
powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least<br>
one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium<br>
phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol,<br>
and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating<br>
agents such as agar—agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain<br>
silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption<br>
accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example,<br>
cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i)<br>
lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols,<br>
sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage<br>
form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
[00252] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft<br>
and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high<br>
molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees,<br>
capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings<br>
and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally<br>
contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active<br>
ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a<br>
delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric<br>
substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in<br><br>
soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as<br>
high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[00253] The active compounds can also be in microencapsulated form with one or<br>
more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and<br>
granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling<br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid<br>
dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as<br>
sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice,<br>
additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids<br>
such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and<br>
pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain<br>
opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s)<br>
only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.<br>
Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and<br>
waxes.<br>
[00254] Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this<br>
invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants<br>
or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic<br>
formulation, eardrops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this<br>
invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches,<br>
which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body.<br>
Such dosage forms are prepared by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper<br>
medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across<br>
the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by<br>
dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
[00255] As described generally above, the compounds of the invention are useful as<br>
modulators of ABC transporters. Thus, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory,<br>
the compounds and compositions are particularly useful for treating or lessening the severity of<br>
a disease, condition, or disorder where hyperactivity or inactivity of ABC transporters is<br>
implicated in the disease, condition, or disorder. When hyperactivity or inactivity of an ABC<br>
transporter is implicated in a particular disease, condition, or disorder, the disease, condition, or<br>
disorder may also be referred to as a "ABC transporter-mediated disease, condition or<br><br>
disorder". Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating<br>
or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where hyperactivity or inactivity of<br>
an ABC transporter is implicated in the disease state.<br>
[00256] The activity of a compound utilized in this invention as a modulator of an<br>
ABC transporter may be assayed according to methods described generally in the art and in the<br>
Examples herein.<br>
[00257] It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies,<br>
that is, the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be administered<br>
concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical<br>
procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a<br>
combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or<br>
procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the<br>
therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an<br>
inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another agent used to treat the<br>
same disorder), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects). As<br>
used herein, additional therapeutic agents that are normally administered to treat or prevent a<br>
particular disease, or condition, are known as "appropriate for the disease, or condition, being<br>
treated".<br>
[00258] The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this<br>
invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a<br>
composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the amount<br>
of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range from about<br>
50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that agent as the<br>
only therapeutically active agent.<br>
[00259] The compounds of this invention or pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
compositions thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating an implantable<br>
medical device, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for coating an<br>
implantable device comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally<br>
above, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable<br>
device. In still another aspect, the present invention includes an implantable device coated with<br>
a composition comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above,<br><br>
and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device.<br>
Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices are described in US<br>
Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically biocompatible<br>
polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane, polycaprolactone,<br>
polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and mixtures thereof. The coatings<br>
may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of fluorosilicone, polysaccarides,<br>
polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to impart controlled release<br>
characteristics in the composition.<br>
[00260] Another aspect of the invention relates to modulating ABC transporter<br>
activity in a biological sample or a patient (e.g., in vitro or in vivo), which method comprises<br>
administering to the patient, or contacting said biological sample with a compound of formula I<br>
or a composition comprising said compound. The term "biological sample", as used herein,<br>
includes, without limitation, cell cultures or extracts thereof; biopsied material obtained from a<br>
mammal or extracts thereof; and blood, saliva, urine, feces, semen, tears, or other body fluids or<br>
extracts thereof.<br>
[00261] Modulation of ABC transporter activity in a biological sample is useful for a<br>
variety of purposes that are known to one of skill in the art. Examples of such purposes<br>
include, but are not limited to, the study of ABC transporters in biological and pathological<br>
phenomena; and the comparative evaluation of new modulators of ABC transporters.<br>
[00262] In yet another embodiment, a method of modulating activity of an anion<br>
channel in vitro or in vivo, is provided comprising the step of contacting said channel with a<br>
compound of formula (I). In preferred embodiments, the anion channel is a chloride channel or<br>
a bicarbonate channel. In other preferred embodiments, the anion channel is a chloride<br>
channel.<br>
[00263] According to an alternative embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>
method of increasing the number of functional ABC transporters in a membrane of a cell,<br>
comprising the step of contacting said cell with a compound of formula (I). The term<br>
"functional ABC transporter" as used herein means an ABC transporter that is capable of<br>
transport activity. In preferred embodiments, said functional ABC transporter is CFTR.<br>
[00264] According to another preferred embodiment, the activity of the ABC<br>
transporter is measured by measuring the transmembrane voltage potential. Means for<br>
measuring the voltage potential across a membrane in the biological sample may employ any of<br><br>
the known methods in the art, such as optical membrane potential assay or other<br>
electrophysiological methods.<br>
[00265] The optical membrane potential assay utilizes voltage-sensitive FRET sensors<br>
described by Gonzalez and Tsien (See, Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1995) "Voltage sensing<br>
by fluorescence resonance energy transfer in single cells" Biophys J 69(4): 1272-80, and<br>
Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1997) "Improved indicators of cell membrane potential that<br>
use fluorescence resonance energy transfer" Chem Biol 4(4): 269-77) in combination with<br>
instrumentation for measuring fluorescence changes such as the Voltage/Ion Probe Reader<br>
(VIPR) (See^ Gonzalez, J. E., K. Oades, et al. (1999) "Cell-based assays and instrumentation<br>
for screening ion-channel targets" Drug Discov Today 4(9): 431-439).<br>
[00266] These voltage sensitive assays are based on the change in fluorescence<br>
resonant energy transfer (FRET) between the membrane-soluble, voltage-sensitive dye,<br>
DiSBAC2(3), and a fluorescent phospholipid, CC2-DMPE, which is attached to the outer leaflet<br>
of the plasma membrane and acts as a FRET donor. Changes in membrane potential (Vm)<br>
cause the negatively charged DiSBAC2(3) to redistribute across the plasma membrane and the<br>
amount of energy transfer from CC2-DMPE changes accordingly. The changes in fluorescence<br>
emission can be monitored using VIPR™ n, which is an integrated liquid handler and<br>
fluorescent detector designed to conduct cell-based screens in 96- or 384-well microtiter plates.<br>
[00267] In another aspect the present invention provides a kit for use in measuring the<br>
activity of a ABC transporter or a fragment thereof in a biological sample in vitro or in vivo<br>
comprising (i) a composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or any of the above<br>
embodiments; and (ii) instructions for a) contacting the composition with the biological sample<br>
and b) measuring activity of said ABC transporter or a fragment thereof. In one embodiment,<br>
the kit further comprises instructions for a) contacting an additional composition with the<br>
biological sample; b) measuring the activity of said ABC transporter or a fragment thereof in<br>
the presence of said additional compound, and c) comparing the activity of the ABC transporter<br>
in the presence of the additional compound with the density of the ABC transporter in the<br>
presence of a composition of formula (I). In preferred embodiments, the kit is used to measure<br>
the density of CFTR.<br>

following examples are set forth. It should be understood that these examples are for<br>

[00275] Assays for Detecting and Measuring AF508-CFTR Correction Properties of<br>
Compounds<br>
[00276] Membrane potential optical methods for assaying AF508-CFTR modulation<br>
properties of compounds.<br>
[00277] The assay utilizes fluorescent voltage sensing dyes to measure changes in<br>
membrane potential using a fluorescent plate reader (e.g., FLIPR in, Molecular Devices, Inc.)<br>
as a readout for increase in functional AF508-CFTR in NIH 3T3 cells. The driving force for the<br>
response is the creation of a chloride ion gradient in conjunction with channel activation by a<br>
single liquid addition step after the cells have previously been treated with compounds and<br>
subsequently loaded with a voltage sensing dye.<br>
[00278] Identification of Correction Compounds<br>
[00279] To identify small molecules that correct the trafficking defect associated with<br>
AF5O8-CFTR; a single-addition HTS assay format was developed. Assay Plates containing cells<br>
are incubated for ~2-4 hours in tissue culture incubator at 37oC, 5%CO2, 90% humidity. Cells are<br>
then ready for compound exposure after adhering to the bottom of the assay plates.<br>
[00280] The cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 16-24 hrs in tissue culture<br>
incubator at 37oC, 5%CCte, 90% humidity in the presence or absence (negative control) of test<br>
compound. The cells were subsequently rinsed 3X with Krebs Ringers solution and loaded<br>
with a voltage sensing redistribution dye. To activate AF5O8-CFTR, 10 uM forskolin and the<br>
CFTR potentiator, genistein (20 uM), were added along with Cl"-free medium to each well. The<br>
addition of Cl-free medium promoted Cl" efflux in response to AF508-CFTR activation and the<br>
resulting membrane depolarization was optically monitored using voltage sensor dyes.<br>
[00281] Identification of Potentiator Compounds<br>
[00282] To identify potentiators of AF508-CFTR, a double-addition HTS assay<br>
format was developed. This HTS assay utilizes fluorescent voltage sensing dyes to measure<br>
changes in membrane potential on the FLIPR III as a measurement for increase in gating<br>
(conductance) of AF508 CFTR in temperature-corrected AF508 CFTR NIH 3T3 cells. The<br>
driving force for the response is a Cl" ion gradient in conjunction with channel activation with<br>
forskolin in a single liquid addition step using a fluoresecent plate reader such as FLIPR III<br>
after the cells have previously been treated with potentiator compounds (or DMSO vehicle<br>
control) and subsequently loaded with a redistribution dye.<br><br>

and 90 % humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM<br>
glutamine, 10 % fetal bovine serum, 1 X NEAA, p-ME, 1 X pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in<br>
175 cm2 culture flasks. For all optical assays, the cells were seeded at -20,000/well in 384-well<br>
matrigel-coated plates and cultured for 2 hrs at 37 °C before culturing at 27 °C for 24 hrs. for<br>
the potentiator assay. For the correction assays, the cells are cultured at 27 °C or 37 °C with<br>
and without compounds for 16 - 24 hours.<br>
[00288] Electrophysiological Assays for assaying AF508-CFTR modulation<br>
properties of compounds.<br>
[00289] 1 .Ussing Chamber Assay<br>
[00290] Ussing chamber experiments were performed on polarized airway epithelial<br>
cells expressing AF508-CFTR to further characterize the AF508-CFTR modulators identified in<br>
the optical assays. Non-CF and CF airway epithelia were isolated from bronchial tissue,<br>
cultured as previously described (Galietta, L.J.V., Lantero, S., Gazzolo, A., Sacco, O., Romano, L.,<br>
Rossi, G.A., &amp; Zegarra-Moran, O. (1998) In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 34, 478-481), and plated onto<br>
Costar® Snapwell™ filters that were precoated with NIH3T3-conditioned media. After four<br>
days the apical media was removed and the cells were grown at an air liquid interface for &gt;14<br>
days prior to use. This resulted in a monolayer of fully differentiated columnar cells that were<br>
ciliated, features that are characteristic of airway epithelia. Non-CF HBE were isolated from<br>
non-smokers that did not have any known lung disease. CF-HBE were isolated from patients<br>
homozygous for AF508-CFTR.<br>
[00291] HBE grown on Costar® Snapwell™ cell culture inserts were mounted in an<br>
Ussing chamber (Physiologic Instruments, Inc., San Diego, CA), and the transepithelial<br>
resistance and short-circuit current in the presence of a basolateral to apical Cl" gradient (ISc)<br><br>
were measured using a voltage-clamp system (Department of Bioengineering, University of<br>
Iowa, IA). Briefly, HBE were examined under voltage-clamp recording conditions (Vhoid = 0<br>
mV) at 37 °C. The basolateral solution contained (in mM) 145 NaCl, 0.83 K2HPO4, 3.3<br>
KH2PO4) 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, 10 Glucose, 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.35 with NaOH) and<br>
the apical solution contained (in mM) 145 NaGluconate, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10<br>
HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.35 with NaOH).<br>
[00292] Identification of Correction Compounds<br>
[00293] Typical protocol utilized a basolateral to apical membrane Cl" concentration<br>
gradient. To set up this gradient, normal ringer was used on the basolateral membrane, whereas<br>
apical NaCl was replaced by equimolar sodium gluconate (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH) to<br>
give a large Cl" concentration gradient across the epithelium. All experiments were performed<br>
with intact monolayers. To fully activate AF508-CFTR, forskolin (10 fiM), PDE inhibitor,<br>
IBMX (100 yM) and CFTR potentiator, genistein (50 uM) were added to the apical side.<br>
[00294] As observed in other cell types, incubation at low temperatures of FRT cells<br>
and human bronchial epithelial cells isolated from diseased CF patients (CF-HBE)expressing<br>
AF508-CFTR increases the functional density of CFTR in the plasma membrane. To determine<br>
the activity of correction compounds, the cells were incubated with test compound for 24-48<br>
hours at 37°C and were subsequently washed 3X prior to recording. The cAMP- and genistein-<br>
mediated Isc in compound-treated cells was normalized to 37°C controls and expressed as<br>
percentage activity of CFTR activity in wt-HBE. Preincubation of the cells with the correction<br>
compound significantly increased the cAMP- and genistein-mediated Isc compared to the 37CC<br>
controls.<br>
[00295] Identification of Potentiator Compounds<br>
[00296] Typical protocol utilized a basolateral to apical membrane Cl" concentration<br>
gradient. To set up this gradient, normal ringers was used on the basolateral membrane,<br>
whereas apical NaCl was replaced by equimolar sodium gluconate (titrated to pH 7.4 with<br>
NaOH) to give a large Cl" concentration gradient across the epithelium. Forskolin (10 \iM) and<br>
all test compounds were added to the apical side of the cell culture inserts. The efficacy of the<br>
putative AF508-CFTR potentiators was compared to that of the known potentiator, genistein.<br>
[00297] 2. Patch-clamp Recordings<br>
[00298] Total Cl" current in AF5O8-NIH3T3 cells was monitored using the perforated-<br>
patch recording configuration as previously described (Rae, J., Cooper, K., Gates, P., &amp;<br><br>
Watsky, M. (1991)./ Neurosci. Methods 37, 15-26). Voltage-clamp recordings were<br>
performed at 22 °C using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc.,<br>
Foster City, CA). The pipette solution contained (in mM) 150 TV-methyl-D-glucamine<br>
(NMDG)-Cl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 240 ng/ml amphotericin-B (pH<br>
adjusted to 7.35 with HC1). The extracellular medium contained (in mM) 150 NMDG-C1, 2<br>
MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.35 with HC1). Pulse generation, data acquisition,<br>
and analysis were performed using a PC equipped with a Digidata 1320 A/D interface in<br>
conjunction with Clampex 8 (Axon Instruments Inc.). To activate AF508-CFTR, 10 |aM<br>
forskolin and 20 (iM genistein were added to the bath and the current-voltage relation was<br>
monitored every 30 sec.<br>
[00299] Identification of Correction Compounds<br>
[00300] To determine the activity of correction compounds for increasing the density<br>
of functional AF508-CFTR in the plasma membrane, we used the above-described perforated-<br>
patch-recording techniques to measure the current density following 24-hr treatment with the<br>
correction compounds. To fully activate AF508-CFTR, 10 nM forskolin and 20uM genistein<br>
were added to the cells. Under our recording conditions, the current density following 24-hr<br>
incubation at 27°C was higher than that observed following 24-hr incubation at 37 °C. These<br>
results are consistent with the known effects of low-temperature incubation on the density of<br>
AF508-CFTR in the plasma membrane. To determine the effects of correction compounds on<br>
CFTR current density, the cells were incubated with 10 nM of the test compound for 24 hours<br>
at 37°C and the current density was compared to the 27°C and 37°C controls (% activity).<br>
Prior to recording, the cells were washed 3X with extracellular recording medium to remove<br>
any remaining test compound. Preincubation with 10 uM of correction compounds<br>
significantly increased the cAMP- and genistein-dependent current compared to the 37°C<br>
controls.<br>
[00301] Identification of Potentiator Compounds<br>
[00302] The ability of AF5O8-CFTR potentiators to increase the macroscopic AF508-<br>
CFTR Cl" current (IAFSOS) in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing AF508-CFTR was also<br>
investigated using perforated-patch-recording techniques. The potentiators identified from the<br>
optical assays evoked a dose-dependent increase in IAFSOS with similar potency and efficacy<br>
observed in the optical assays. In all cells examined, the reversal potential before and during<br>
potentiator application was around -30 mV, which is the calculated EQ (-28 mV).<br><br>
[00303] Cell Culture<br>
[00304] NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing AF508-CFTR are used for<br>
whole-cell recordings. The cells are maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 90 % humidity in<br>
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10 % fetal bovine<br>
serum, 1 X NEAA, 0-ME, 1 X pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm2 culture flasks. For<br>
whole-cell recordings, 2,500 - 5,000 cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips<br>
and cultured for 24 - 48 hrs at 27 °C before use to test the activity of potentiators; and<br>
incubated with or without the correction compound at 37 °C for measuring the activity of<br>
correctors.<br>
[00305] 3.Single-channel recordings<br>
[00306] Gating activity of wt-CFTR and temperature-corrected AF508-CFTR<br>
expressed in NIH3T3 cells was observed using excised inside-out membrane patch recordings<br>
as previously described (Dalemans, W., Barbry, P., Champigny, G., Jallat, S., Dott, K., Dreyer, D.,<br>
Crystal, R.G., Pavirani, A., Lecocq, J-P., LazdunsM, M. (1991) Nature 354, 526 - 528) using an<br>
Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc.). The pipette contained (in<br>
mM): 150 NMDG, 150 aspartic acid, 5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.35<br>
with Tris base). The bath contained (in mM): 150 NMDG-C1, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 TES, and<br>
14 Tris base (pH adjusted to 7.35 with HC1). After excision, both wt- and AF508-CFTR were<br>
activated by adding 1 mM Mg-ATP, 75 nM of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein<br>
kinase (PKA; Promega Corp. Madison, WI), and 10 mM NaF to inhibit protein phosphatases,<br>
which prevented current rundown. The pipette potential was maintained at 80 mV. Channel<br>
activity was analyzed from membrane patches containing 
number of simultaneous openings determined the number of active channels during the course<br>
of an experiment. To determine the single-channel current amplitude, the data recorded from<br>
120 sec of AF5O8-CFTR activity was filtered "off-line" at 100 Hz and then used to construct<br>
all-point amplitude histograms that were fitted with multigaussian functions using Bio-Patch<br>
Analysis software (Bio-Logic Comp. France). The total microscopic current and open<br>
probability (Po) were determined from 120 sec of channel activity. The Po was determined<br>
