The compounds of formula (I-A) can be prepared according to art-known procedures.<br>
In particular, the compounds of formula (I-A) can generally be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (II), wherein W1 is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halo atom with an amino derivative of formula (III) in a reaction inert solvent such as, for example, 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 2-propanol, JV-methyl-pyrrolidinone and the like, optionally in the presence of a suitable base such as, for<br><br>
example, sodiumhydroxide, sodiumhydride, triethylamine or M/V-di-isopropyl-ethylamine or the like.<br>
In case Q is NR2R2 and R2 contains a hydroxy moiety, it may be convenient to perform the above reaction with a protected form of intermediate (III) whereby the hydroxy moiety bears a suitable protecting group P being, for instance, a benzyl, and subsequently removing the protective group according to art-known methodologies, such as, for example, reacting with BBr3 in dichloromethane under nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
Compounds of formula (I-A) wherein Y is CR5, said compounds being represented by formula (I-A-a), may also be prepared by reacting an intermediate of.formula (IV) wherein W1 is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halo atom, with an amino derivative of formula (V), optionally in a solvent such as, for example, water, 2-propanol, diethylether, l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and the like, and optionally in the presence of an acid such as, for example, 1 N hydrochloric acid in diethylether. It may be convenient to perform the reaction under a reaction-inert atmosphere such as, for example, oxygen free argon or nitrogen.<br><br>
Compounds of formula (I-A-a) wherein L is -X'-R6, said compounds being represented by formula (I-A-a-1), can also be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (VI) with an intermediate of formula (VII) in a suitable solvent such as, for example, 1,4-dioxane.<br><br><br>
Depending on the nature of X1 a suitable base or acid may be used to improve the reaction rate. For instance, in case X1 is -0-, sodium hydride may be used as suitable base; or in case X1 is -NR3-, HC1 may be used as a suitable acid.<br>
The compounds of formula (I-A), wherein Y is N, said compounds being represented by formula (I-A-b), can also conveniently be prepared using solid phase synthesis techniques. In general, solid phase synthesis involves reacting an intermediate in a synthesis with a polymer support. This polymer supported intermediate can then be carried on through a number of synthetic steps. After each step, impurities are removed by filtering the resin and washing it numerous times with various solvents. At each step the resin can be split up to react with various intermediates in the next step thus allowing for the synthesis of a large number of compounds. After the last step in the procedure the resin is treated with a reagent or process to cleave the resin from the sample.<br>
Suitable polymer supports include for instance Rink Amide resin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., San Diego, California).<br>
For instance, the compounds of formula (I-A-b) wherein n is 1 and the R4 substituent is placed in the meta position of A, and NR*R2 is NH2, said compounds being represented bv formula fl-A-b-D. were prepared according to the procedure depicted in Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
In scheme 1, Rink Amide resin is reacted in a suitable solvent such as, for example N,N-dimethylforrnamide in the presence of piperidine to obtain the primary amine of formula (VHI-a) which can then further be reacted with an intermediate of formula (IX) wherein W1 is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halo atom, in the presence of a base such as for example, iy^V-diisopropylethylamine, in a suitable solvent such as, for example, dimethylsulfoxide. Impurities can be removed by washing numerous times with various solvents such as, for example, 7VJV-dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, dimethylsulfoxide and the like. The resulting polymer-bound intermediate of formula (VTH-b) was then further reacted with L-H (X). To facilitate this transformation, silver triflate, sodium hexamethyldisilazide or cesium carbonate may be used. The resin is finally treated with a cleavage reagent such as for example trifluoroacetic acid in tetrahydrofuran, thus obtaining compounds of formula (I-A-b-1).<br>
In this and the following preparations, the reaction products may be isolated from the reaction medium and, if necessary, further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as, for example, extraction, crystallization, distillation, trituration and chromatography.<br>
The compounds of formula (I-A) may further be prepared by converting compounds of formula (I-A) into each other according to art-known group transformation reactions.<br>
The compounds of formula (I-A) may be converted to the corresponding N-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its N-oxide form. Said N-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I-A) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. t.butyl hydro-peroxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alcohols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
For instance, compounds of formula (I-A-a) wherein Q is NR*R2 and R1 and R2 are taken together to form mono- or di(C1-12alkyl)arninoC1-4alkylidene, said compounds<br><br>
being represented by formula (I-A-a-2), may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (I-A-a) wherein R1 and R2 are hydrogen, said compound being represented by formula (I-A-a-3), with an intermediate of formula (XI) or a functional derivative thereof.<br><br>
Also, compounds of formula (I-A-a) wherein Q is NR'R2 and R1 and R2 are hydrogen may further be reacted with an acyl halide or an alkyl chloroformate in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example dichloromethane, in the presence of a suitable base, such as, for example, pyridine, to form the corresponding amide, respectively, carbamate derivative.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I-A) and some of the intermediates in the present invention may contain an asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enantiomers can be obtained from racemic mixtures by first converting said racemic mixtures with suitable resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally converting said separated diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starting materials, provided that the intervening reactions occur stereospecifically.<br><br>
An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I-A) and intermediates involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase.<br>
Some of the intermediates and starting materials are known compounds and may be commercially available or may be prepared according to art-known procedures.<br><br><br>
Intermediates of formula (II), wherein Y is CR5, said intermediates being represented by formula (Il-a), can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (XII) with an intermediate of formula (V) analogously to the preparation of compounds of formula d-a).<br>
wherein n' is0,l,2,or3.<br>
Particular intermediates of formula (II'-a) are those wherein W1 is a halo atom, more in particular, a chloro atom.<br>
Intermediates of formula (II), wherein Y is N, R4 is placed in paraposition of NR , and n is 1, said intermediates being represented by formula (II-b-1) can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (XIII) wherein W1 is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, with an amine derivative of formula (XIV) in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane or the like, in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, triethylamine; and subsequently reacting the thus obtained intermediate of formula (XV) with an intermediate of formula (XVI) in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, acetonitrile, 1,4-dioxane or the like, in the presence of a base such as, for example, potassium carbonate, sodium hydride, A^,//-diisopropyl-ethylamine or the like.<br>
-25'<br><br><br>
The order of the above reaction scheme may also be reversed, i.e. first an intermediate of formula (XHI) may be reacted with an intermediate of formula (XVI), and then, the resulting intermediate of formula (XVH) may further be reacted with an amine derivative of formula (XIV); thus forming an intermediate of formula (II-b-1).<br><br>

The order of the above reaction scheme may also be reversed, i.e. first an intermediate of formula (11(c)) may be reacted with an intermediate of formula (V(c)), and then, the resulting intermediate may further be reacted with an amine derivative of formula (irj(c)); thus forming a compound of formula (I-C-a).<br><br>
The reaction products may be isolated from the reaction medium and, if necessary, further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as, extraction, crystallization, distillation, trituration and chromatography.<br>
Compounds of formula (I-C) wherein L is an optionally substituted C1-10alkyl, C2-10alkenyl, C2-10alkynyl, C3-7cycloalkyl, said compounds are represented by formula (I-C-b), can be prepared by first making a Grignard reagent of an intermediate of formula (VI(c)) wherein W2 is a suitable substituent such as, a halogen, e.g. bromine, in the presence of magnesium in a reaction-inert solvent such as, diethyl ether, and subsequently reacting said Grignard reagent with an intermediate of formula (11(c)) wherein W1 is a suitable leaving group such as, a halogen, e.g. chlorine, in a reaction-inert solvent, for example, benzene, thus forming an intermediate of formula (VII(c)). It may be convenient to perform the above reaction under a inert atmosphere, for instance, argon. Intermediate (VII(c)) may be isolated from its reaction medium, or may be in situ further reacted with an intermediate of formula (111(c)) in a reaction-inert solvent such as, 1,4-dioxane, and in the presence of a suitable base such as, diisopropylethylamine or the like, thus forming a compound of formula (I-C-b).<br><br>

The compounds of formula (I-C) may be converted to the corresponding N-oxides by the procedures as described hereinabove.<br>
Some of the intermediates as mentioned hereinabove are commercially available or can be prepared according to art-known procedures.<br>
Compounds of formula (I-C) and some of the intermediates may have one or more stereogenic centers in their structure, present in a R or a S configuration.<br>
The compounds of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes may be synthesized as a mixture of stereoisomeric forms, in particular in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of<br><br>
formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes described above the functional groups of intermediate compounds to prepare compounds of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) may need to be blocked by protecting groups.<br>
Functional groups which it is desirable to protect include hydroxy, amino and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl groups (e.g. tert-butyldimethylsilyl, terr-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), benzyl and tetrahydropyranyl. Suitable protecting groups for amino include fert-butyloxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include C1-6alkyl or benzyl esters.<br>
The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after a reaction step.<br>
The use of protecting groups is fully described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry', edited by J W F McOmie, Plenum Press (1973), and 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' 2nd edition, T W Greene &amp; P G M Wutz, Wiley Interscience (1991).<br>
The compounds of formula (I-A), (I-B) and (I-C) and the intermediates of formula (IT-a) unexpectedly show antiretroviral properties, in particular against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HTV), which is the aetiological agent of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in humans. The HTV virus preferentially infects human T-4 cells and destroys them or changes their normal function, particularly the coordination of the immune system. As a result, an infected patient has an everdecreasing number of T-4 cells, which moreover behave abnormally. Hence, the immunological defense system is unable to combat infections and neoplasms and the<br><br>
HIV infected subject usually dies by opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, or by cancers. Other conditions associated with HIV infection include thrombocytopaenia, multiple sclerosis, Kaposi's sarcoma and infection of the central nervous system characterized by progressive demyelination, resulting in dementia and symptoms such as, progressive dysarthria, ataxia and disorientation. HTV infection further has also been associated with peripheral neuropathy, progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and AIDS-related complex (ARC).<br>
The compounds of formula (I-A), (I-B) and (I-C) also show activity against HTV-1 strains that have acquired resistance to art-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. They also have little or no binding affinity to human cc-1 acid glycoprotein.<br>
Those of skill in the treatment of HIV-infection could determine the effective daily amount from the test results presented here. In general it is contemplated that an effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 1 to 1000 mg, in particular 5 to 600 rag of active ingredient per unit dosage form, and more in particular from 200 to 400 mg per unit dosage form or from 5 to 200 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form depending on the particular compound being used..<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines and are not intended to limit the scope or use of the invention to any extent.<br>
The compounds of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) can also be used in the present invention in combination with another compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) or with another antiretroviral compound. Thus, the present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing (a) a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or<br><br>
(I-C), (b) another compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) or another antiretroviral compound, and (c) one or more water-soluble polymers, as a combined preparation for anti-HTV treatment. Said other antiretroviral compounds may be known antiretroviral compounds such as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, e.g. zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, AZT), didanosine (dideoxy inosine; ddl), zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine, ddC) or lamivudine (3'-thia-2'-3'-dideoxycytidine, 3TC) and the like; non-nucleoside reverse transciptase inhibitors such as suramine, foscamet-sodium (trisodium phosphono formate), nevirapine (ll-cyclopropyl-5,ll-dihydro-4-methyl-6H-dipyrido[3,2-b : 2',3'-e] [l,4]diazepin-6-one), sustiva (efavirenz), tacrine (tetrahydroaminoacridine) and the like; compounds of the TIBO (tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5,l-jk][l,4]-benzodiazepine-2(lH)-one and thione)-type e.g. (S)-8-chloro-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro~5-methyl-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)imidazo-[4,5,l-jk][l,4]benzodiazepine-2(lH)-thione; compounds of the a-APA (a-anilino phenyl acetamide) type e.g. a-[(2-nitro-phenyl)amino]-2,6-dichlorobenzene-acetamide and the like; TAT-inhibitors, e.g. RO-5-3335 and the like; protease inhibitors e.g. indinavir, ritanovir, saquinovir and the like; NMDA receptor inhibitors e.g. pentamidine; a-glycosidase inhibitor e.g. castanospermine and the like; Rnase H inhibitor e.g. dextran (dextran sulfate) and the like; or immunomodulating agents, e.g. levamisole, thymopentin and the like.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" defines a system in a solid state (as opposed to a liquid or gaseous state) comprising at least two components, wherein one component is dispersed more or less evenly throughout the other component or components. When said dispersion of the components is such that the system is chemically and physically uniform or homogenous throughout or consists of one phase as defined in thermoÂ¬dynamics, such a solid dispersion will be called "a solid solution" hereinafter. Solid solutions are preferred physical systems because the components therein are usually readily bioavailable to the organisms to which they are administered. This advantage can probably be explained by the ease with which said solid solutions can form liquid solutions when contacted with a liquid medium such as gastric juice. The ease of dissolution may be attributed at least in part to the fact that the energy required for dissolution of the components from a solid solution is less than that required for the dissolution of components from a crystalline or microcrystalline solid phase.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" also comprises dispersions which are less homogenous throughout than solid solutions. Such dispersions are not chemically and physically uniform throughout or comprise more than one phase. For example, the term "a solid<br><br>
dispersion" also relates to particles having domains or small regions wherein amorphous, microcrystalline or crystalline (a), or amorphous, microcrystalline or crystalline (b), or both, are dispersed more or less evenly in another phase comprising (b), or (a), or a solid solution comprising (a) and (b). Said domains are regions within the particles distinctively marked by some physical feature, small in size compared to the size of the particle as a whole, and evenly and randomly distributed throughout the particle.<br>
As described hereinabove, the particles of the present invention also comprise one or more water-soluble polymers.<br>
The water-soluble polymer in the particles according to the present invention is a polymer that preferably has an apparent viscosity, when dissolved at 20Â°C in an aqueous solution at 2 % (w/v), of 1 to 5000 mPa.s more preferably of 1 to 700 mPa.s, and most preferred of 1 to 100 mPa.s. For example, the water-soluble polymer can be selected from the group comprising<br>
-	alkylcelluloses such as methylcellulose,<br>
-	hydroxyalkylcelluloses such as hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose and hydroxybutylcellulose,<br>
-	hydroxyalkyl alkylcelluloses such as hydroxyethyl methylcellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,<br>
-	carboxyalkylcelluloses such as carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
-	alkali metal salts of carboxyalkylcelluloses such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
-	carboxyalkylalkylcelluloses such as carboxymethylethylcellulose,<br>
-	carboxyalkylcellulose esters,<br>
-	starches,<br>
-	pectines such as sodium carboxymethylamylopectine,<br>
-	chitin derivates such as chitosan,<br>
-	di-, oligo- and polysaccharides such as trehalose, cyclodextrins and derivatives thereof, alginic acid, alkali metal and ammonium salts thereof, carrageenans, galactomannans, tragacanth, agar-agar, gummi arabicum, guar gummi and xanthan gummi,<br>
-	polyacrylic acids and the salts thereof,<br>
-	polymethacrylic acids, the salts and esters thereof, methacrylate copolymers,<br>
-	polyvinylalcohol,<br>
-	polyalkylene oxides such as polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.<br><br>
Preferred water-soluble polymers are Eudragit E   and hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses (HPMC).<br>
Said Eudragit EÂ® (Rohm GmbH, Germany) is an aminqalkyl methacrylate copolymer, more in particular poly(butyl methacrylate, (2-dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate, methyl methacrylate) (1:2:1). This basic polymethacrylate is soluble in gastric fluid up to pH 5. Eudragit EÂ® 100, which is a solvent-free Eudragit EÂ® solid substance is preferred.<br>
     Said HPMC contains sufficient hydroxypropyl and methoxy groups to render it water-soluble. HPMC having a methoxy degree of substitution from about 0.8 to about 2.5 and a hydroxypropyl molar substitution from about 0.05 to about 3.0 are generally water-soluble. Methoxy degree of substitution refers to the average number of methyl ether groups present per anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule. Hydroxy-propyl molar substitution refers to the average number of moles of propylene oxide which have reacted with each anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is the United States Adopted Name for hypromellose (see Martindale, The Extra pharmacopoeia, 29th edition, page 1435). In the four digit number "2910", the first two digits represent the approximate percentage of methoxyl groups and the third and fourth digits the approximate percentage composition of hydroxypropoxyl groups; 5 mPa.s is a value indicative of the apparent viscosity of a 2 % aqueous solution at 20Â°C.<br>
The molecular weight of the HPMC normally affects both the release profile of the milled extrudate as well as its physical properties. A desired release profile can thus be designed by choosing an HPMC of an appropriate molecular weight; for immediate release of the active ingredient from the particles, a low molecular weight polymer is preferred. High molecular weight HPMC is more likely to yield a sustained release pharmaceutical dosage form.  The molecular weight of a water-soluble cellulose ether is generally expressed in terms of the apparent viscosity at 20Â°C of an aqueous solution containing two percent by weight of said polymer. Suitable HPMC include those having a viscosity from about 1 to about 100 mPa.s, in particular form about 3 to about 15 mPa.s, preferably about 5 mPa.s The most preferred type of HPMC having a viscosity of 5 mPa.s., is the commercially available HPMC 2910 5 mPa.s, because this yields particles from which superior oral dosage forms of compounds of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) can be prepared as will be discussed hereunder and in the experimental part.<br><br>
The weight-by-weight ratio of (a) (i.e. the antiviral compound): (b) (i.e. the water-soluble polymer) is in the range of 1 : 1 to 1: 899, preferably 1: 1 to 1 : 100, more preferably 1: 1 to 1: 5. In the case of (compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C)): (HPMC 2910 5 mPa.s), said ratio preferably ranges from about 1 : 1 to about 1: 3, and optimally is about 1:1,5 (or 2 : 3). The most appropriate weight by weight ratio of a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) to water-soluble polymer(s) may be determined by a person skilled in the art by straightforward experimentation. The lower limit is determined by practical considerations. Indeed, given the therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) (from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg per unit dosage form, preferably about 200 mg to 400 mg or 5 to 200 mg per unit dosage form), the lower limit of the ratio is determined by the maximum amount of mixture that can be processed into one dosage form of practical size. When the relative amount of water-soluble polymer is too high, the absolute amount of mixture needed to reach the therapeutic level will be too high to be processed into one capsule or tablet. Tablets, for example, have a maximum weight of about 1 g, and the extrudate can account for maximally about 90 % (w/w) thereof. Consequently, the lower limit of the amount of a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) over water-soluble polymer will be about 1 : 899 (1 mg of a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) + 899 mg water-soluble polymer).<br>
On the other hand, if the ratio is too high, this means the amount of the compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) is relatively high compared to the amount of water-soluble polymer, then there is the risk that the compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) will not dissolve sufficiently in the water-soluble polymer, and thus the required bioavailability will not be obtained. The degree to which a compound has dissolved into" a water-soluble polymer can often be checked visually : if the extrudate is clear then it is very likely that the compound will have dissolved completely in the water-soluble polymer. It will be appreciated that the upper limit of 1 ; 1 may be underestimated for particular compounds of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) and particular water-soluble polymers. Since this can be established easily but for the experimentation time involved, solid dispersions wherein the ratio (a): (b) is larger than 1: 1 are also meant to be comprised within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The particles according to the present invention can be prepared by first preparing a solid dispersion of the components, and then optionally grinding or milling that dispersion. Various techniques exist for preparing solid dispersions including melt-extrusion, spray-drying and solution-evaporation, melt-extrusion being preferred.<br><br>
The melt-extrusion process comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	mixing the components (a) and (b),<br>
b)	optionally blending additives, with the thus obtained mixture,<br>
c)	heating the thus obtained blend until one obtains a homogenous melt,      d) forcing the thus obtained melt through one or more nozzles; and<br>
e) cooling the melt till it solidifies.<br>
The terms "melt" and "melting" should be interpreted broadly. For our purposes, these terms not only mean the alteration from a solid state to a liquid state, but can also refer      to a transition to a glassy state or a rubbery state, and in which it is possible for one component of the mixture to get embedded more or less homogeneously into the other. In particular cases, one component will melt and the other component(s) will dissolve in the melt thus forming a solution, which upon cooling may form a solid solution<br>
having advantageous dissolution properties.<br><br>
One of the most important parameters of melt extrusion is the temperature at which the melt-extruder is operating. It was found that the operating temperature can easily range between about 20Â°C and about 300Â°C, more preferably about 70Â°C and 250Â°C. The lower temperature limit depends on the solubility of a compound of formula (I-A),      (I-B) or (I-C) in the water-soluble polymer and on the viscosity of the mixture. When the compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) is not completely dissolved in the water-soluble polymer, the extrudate will not have the required bioavailability; when the viscosity of the mixture is too high, the process of melt extrusion will be difficult. At temperatures of more than 300Â°C the water-soluble polymer may decompose to an unacceptable level. It may be noted that there is no need to fear decomposition of a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) at temperatures up to 300Â°C. A person skilled in the art will easily recognize the most appropriate temperature range to be used.<br>
The throughput rate is also of importance because even at relatively low temperatures the water-soluble polymer may start to decompose when it remains too long in contact with the heating element.<br>
It will be appreciated that the person skilled in the art will be able to optimize the parameters of the melt extrusion process within the above given ranges. The working temperatures will also be determined by the kind of extruder or the kind of configuration within the extruder that is used. Most of the energy needed to melt, mix and dissolve the components in the extruder can be provided by the heating elements.<br><br>
However, the friction of the material within the extruder may also provide a substantial amount of energy to the mixture and aid in the formation of a homogenous melt of the components.<br>
A person skilled in the art will easily recognize the most appropriate extruder, such as, for example, a single screw, a twin screw extruder or a multi-screw extruder, for the preparation of the subject-matter of the present invention.<br>
Spray-drying of a solution of the components also yields a solid dispersion of said components and may be a useful alternative to the melt-extrusion process, particularly in those cases where the water-soluble polymer is not sufficiently stable to withstand the extrusion conditions and where residual solvent can effectively be removed from the solid dispersion. Yet another possible preparation consists of preparing a solution of the components, pouring said solution onto a large surface so as to form a thin film, and evaporating the solvent therefrom.<br>
The solid dispersion product is milled or ground to particles having a particle size of less than 1500 Âµm, preferably less than 400 Âµm, more preferably less than 250 Âµm, and most preferably less than 125 Âµm. The particle size proves to be an important factor determining the speed with which a particular dosage form can be manufactured on a large scale. For instance, for capsules, the particle size may range preferably from 100 to 1500 Âµm; for tablets the particle size is preferably less than 250 Âµm. The smaller the particles, the faster the tabletting speed can be without detrimental effects on their quality. The particle size distribution is such that more than 70% of the particles (measured by weight) have a diameter ranging from about 50 Âµm to about 1400 Âµm, in particular from about 50 Âµm to about 200 Âµm, more in particular from about 50 Âµm to about 150, and most in particular from about 50 um to about 125 jam. Particles of the dimensions mentioned herein can be obtained by sieving them through nominal standard test sieves as described in the CRC Handbook, 64th ed., page F-114. Nominal standard sieves are characterized by the mesh/hole width (Âµm), DIN 4188 (mm), ASTM E 11-70 (No), TylerÂ® (mesh) or BS 410 (mesh) values. Throughout this description, and in the claims hereinafter, particle sizes are designated by reference to the mesh/hole width in Âµm and to the corresponding Sieve No. in the ASTM El 1-70 standard. .<br>
Preferred are particles whereinthe compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) is in a non-crystalline phase as these have an intrinsically faster dissolution rate than those<br><br><br>
wherein part or all of the compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) is in a microcrystalline or crystalline form.<br>
Preferably, the solid dispersion is in the form of a solid solution comprising (a) and (b). Alternatively, it may be in the form of a dispersion wherein amorphous or microcrystalline (a) or amorphous or microcrystalline (b) is dispersed more or less evenly in a solid solution comprising (a) and (b).<br>
Preferred particles are those obtainable by melt-extrusion of the components and grinding, and optionally sieving. More in particular, the present invention concerns particles consisting of a solid solution comprising two parts by weight of a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) and three parts by weight of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose HPMC 2910 5 mPa.s, obtainable by blending said components, melt-extruding the blend at a temperature in the range of 20Â°C - 300Â°C, grinding the extrudate, and optionally sieving the thus obtained particles. The preparation is easy to perform and yields particles of a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) that are free of organic solvent.<br>
The particle as described hereinabove may further comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as, for example, plasticizers, flavors, colorants, preservatives and the like. Said excipients should not be heat-sensitive, in other words, they should not show any appreciable degradation or decomposition at the working temperature of the melt-extruder.<br>
In the current formulations (compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C):HPMC 2910 5 mPa.s), the amount of plasticizer is preferably small, in the order of 0 % to 15 % (w/w), preferably less than 5 % (w/w). With other water-soluble polymers though, plasticizers may be employed in much different, often higher amounts because plasticizers as mentioned hereinbelow lower the temperature at which a melt of (a), (b) and plasticizer is formed, and this lowering of the melting point is advantagous where the polymer has limited thermal stability. Suitable plasticizers are pharmaceutically acceptable and include low molecular weight polyalcohols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,2 butylene glycol, 2,3-butylene glycol, styrene glycol; polyethylene glycols such as diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol; other polyethylene glycols having a molecular weight lower than 1,000 g/mol; polypropylene glycols having a molecular weight lower than 200 g/mol; glycol ethers such as monopropylene glycol monoisopropyl ether; propylene glycol monoethyl ether; diethylene glycol monoethyl ether; ester type plasticizers such as sorbitol lactate, ethyl lactate, butyl lactate, ethyl<br><br>
     glycolate, allyl glycollate; and amines such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, monoisopropanolamine; triethylenetetramine, 2-amino-2-methyI-l,3-propanediol and the like.  Of these, the low molecular weight polyethylene glycols, ethylene glycol, low molecular weight polypropylene glycols and especially propylene<br>
     glycol are preferred.<br>
Once the extrudate is obtained, it can be milled and sieved, and it can be used as ingredient to make pharmaceutical dosage forms.<br>
    The particles of the present invention can be formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms comprising a therapeutically effective amount of particles. Although, at first instance, pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration such as tablets and capsules are envisaged, the particles of the present invention can also be used to prepare pharmaceutical dosage forms e.g. for rectal administration. Preferred dosage forms are those adapted for oral administration shaped as a tablet. They can be produced by conventional tabletting techniques with conventional ingredients or excipients and with conventional tabletting machines. As mentioned above, an effective antiviral dose of a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) ranges from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg per unit dosage form, and preferably is about 200 to 400 mg or 5 to 200 mg per unit dosage form depending on the particular compound being used. When one considers that the weight-by-weight ratio of (a) : (b) is maximally about 1:1, then it follows that one dosage form will weigh at least 10 to 800mg. In order to facilitate the swallowing of such a dosage form by a mammal, it is advantageous to give the dosage form, in particular tablets, an appropriate shape. Tablets that can be swallowed comfortably are therefore preferably elongated rather than round in shape. Especially preferred are biconvex oblate tablets. As discussed hereunder in more detail, a film coat on the tablet further contributes to the ease with which it can be swallowed.<br>
Tablets that give an immediate release of a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) upon oral ingestion and that have good bioavailability are designed in such a manner that the tablets disintegrate rapidly in the stomach (immediate release) and that the particles which are liberated thereby are kept away from one another so that they do not coalesce, give local high concentrations of a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) and the chance that the drug precipitates (bioavailability). The desired effect can be obtained by distributing said particles homogeneously throughout a mixture of a disintegrant and a diluent.<br><br>
Suitable disintegrants are those that have a large coefficient of expansion. Examples thereof are hydrophilic, insoluble or poorly water-soluble crosslinked polymers such as crospovidone (crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone) and croscarmellose (crosslinked sodium carboxymethylcellulose). The amount of disintegrant in immediate release tablets according to the present invention may conveniently range from about 3 to about 15 % (w/w) and preferably is about 7 to 9 %, in particular about 8.5 % (w/w). This amount tends to be larger than usual in tablets in order to ensure that the particles are spread over a large volume of the stomach contents upon ingestion. Because disintegrants by their nature yield sustained release formulations when employed in bulk, it is advantageous to dilute them with an inert substance called a diluent or filler.<br>
A variety of materials may be used as diluents or fillers. Examples are spray-dried or anhydrous lactose, sucrose, dextrose, mannitol, sorbitol, starch, cellulose (e.g. micro-crystalline cellulose Avicelâ¢), dihydrated or anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate, and others known in the art, and mixtures thereof. Preferred is a commercial spray-dried mixture of lactose monohydrate (75 %) with microcrystalline cellulose (25 %) which is commercially availble as Microcelacâ¢. The amount of diluent or filler in the tablets may conveniently range from about 20 % to about 40 % (w/w) and preferably ranges from about 25 % to about 32 % (w/w).<br>
The tablet may include a variety of one or more other conventional excipients such as binders, buffering agents, lubricants, glidants, thickening agents, sweetening agents, flavors, and colors. Some excipients can serve multiple purposes.<br>
Lubricants and glidants can be employed in the manufacture of certain dosage forms, and will usually be employed when producing tablets. Examples of lubricants and glidants are hydrogenated vegetable oils, e.g hydrogenated Cottonseed oil, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, colloidal silica, talc, mixtures thereof, and others known in the art. Interesting lubricants and glidants are magnesium stearate, and mixtures of magnesium stearate with colloidal silica. A preferred lubricant is hydrogenated vegetable oil type I, most preferably hydrogenated, deodorized Cottonseed oil (commercially available from Karlshamns as Akofine NF â¢ (formerly called Sterotexâ¢)). Lubricants and glidants generally comprise 0.2 to 7.0 % of the total tablet weight.<br>
Other excipients such as coloring agents and pigments may also be added to the tablets of the present invention. Coloring agents and pigments include titanium dioxide and dyes suitable for food. A coloring agent is an optional ingredient in the tablet of the<br><br>
present invention, but when used the coloring agent can be present in an amount up to 3.5 % based on the total tablet weight.<br>
Flavors are optional in the composition and may be chosen from synthetic flavor oils      and flavoring aromatics or natural oils, extracts from plants leaves, flowers, fruits and so forth and combinations thereof. These may include cinnamon oil, oil of wintergreen, peppermint oils, bay oil, anise oil, eucalyptus, thyme oil. Also useful as flavors are vanilla, citrus oil, including lemon, orange, grape, lime and grapefruit, and fruit essences, including apple, banana, pear, peach, strawberry, raspberry, cherry,      plum, pineapple, apricot and so forth, The amount of flavor may depend on a number of factors including the organoleptic effect desired. Generally the flavor will be present in an amount from about 0 % to about 3 % (w/w).<br>
As known in the art, tablet blends may be dry-granulated or wet-granulated before tabletting. The tabletting process itself is otherwise standard and readily practised by forming a tablet from desired blend or mixture of ingredients into the appropriate shape using a conventional tablet press.<br>
Tablets of the present invention may further be film-coated to improve taste, to provide ease of swallowing and an elegant appearance. Many suitable polymeric film-coating materials are known in the art. A preferred film-coating material is hydroxypropyl methylcellulose HPMC, especially HPMC 2910 5 mPa.s. Other suitable film-forming polymers also may be used herein, including, hydroxypropylcellulose, and acrylate-methacrylate copolymers. Besides a film-forming polymer, the film coat may further comprise a plasticizer (e.g. propylene glycol) and optionally a pigment (e.g. titanium dioxide). The film-coating suspension also may contain talc as an anti-adhesive. In immediate release tablets according to the invention, the film coat is small and in terms of weight accounts for less than about 3 % (w/w) of the total tablet weight.<br>
Preferred dosage forms are those wherein the weight of the particles is at least 40 % of the total weight of the total dosage form, that of the diluent ranges from 20 to 40 %, and that of the disintegrant ranges from 3 to 10 %, the remainder being accounted for by one or more of the excipients described hereinabove.<br>
The present invention further concerns a process of preparing particles as described hereinbefore, characterized by blending the components, extruding said blend at a temperature in the range of 20 - 300 Â°C, grinding the extrudate, and optionally sieving the particles.<br><br>
The invention also concerns solid dispersions obtainable by melt-extrusion of (a) a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) or one of its stereoisomers or a mixture of two or more of its stereoisomers, and      (c) one or more pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymers.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process of preparing a pharmaceutical dosage form as described hereinbefore, characterized by blending a therapeutically effective amount of particles as described hereinbefore, with phannaceuticaUy      acceptable excipients and compressing said blend into tablets or filling said blend in capsules.<br>
Further, this invention concerns particles as described hereinbefore, for use in preparing a pharmaceutical dosage form for oral administration to a mammal suffering from a viral infection, wherein preferably a single such dosage form can be administered once daily to said mammal.<br>
The present invention also concerns the use of particles according to as described hereinbefore, for the preparation of a pharmaceutical dosage form for oral administration to a mammal suffering from a viral infection, wherein preferably a single such dosage form can be administered once daily to said mammal.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of treating a viral infection in a mammal which comprises administering to said mammal an effective antiviral amount of a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C), preferably in a single oral dosage form which can be administered once daily.<br>
The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical package suitable for commercial sale comprising a container, an oral dosage form of a compound of formula (I-A), (I-B) or (I-C) as described hereinbefore, and associated with said package written matter.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate the present invention.<br>

A rapid, sensitive and automated assay procedure was used for the in vitro evaluation of anti-HTV agents. An HIV-1 transformed T4-cell line, MT-4, which was previously shown (Koyanagi et al., Int. J. Cancer, 36, 445-451,1985) to be highly susceptible to and permissive for HTV infection, served as the target cell line. Inhibition of the HIV-induced cytopathic effect was used as the end point. The viability of both HIV- and mock-infected cells was assessed spectrophotometrically via the in situ reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50 in uM) was defined as the concentration of compound<br>
that reduced the absorbance of the mock-infected control sample by 50%. The percent protection achieved by the compound in HIV-infected cells was calculated by the following formula :<br>
(QDT)Hiv-(ODc)Hrv (0DCW-(0DC)HIV       expressed m%,<br>
whereby (ODT)HTV is the optical density measured with a given concentration of the test compound in HIV-infected cells; (ODc)Hrv is tne optical density measured for the control untreated HIV-infected cells; (ODc)MOCK is the optical density measured for the control untreated mock-infected cells; all optical density values were determined at 540<br><br>
nm. The dose achieving 50% protection according to the above formula was defined as the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50 in uM). The ratio of CC50 to IC50 was defined<br>
as the selectivity index (SI). The compounds of formula (I-A) were shown to inhibit HIV-1 effectively. Particular IC50, CC50 and SI values are listed in Table 1<br>
