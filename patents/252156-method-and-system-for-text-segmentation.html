				<td>METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR TEXT SEGMENTATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to text segmentation and, more<br>
particularly, to segmenting strings of characters.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Text processing methods and systems exist that attempt to interpret data<br>
representing text. Text processing is made more difficult when a string of characters is<br>
received that has no breaks indicating words or other tokens. One of the first steps in<br>
processing such strings of characters is to segment the string into tokens in order to<br>
interpret the string. Such tokens can be words, acronyms, abbreviations, proper names,<br>
geographical names, stock market ticker symbols or other tokens.<br>
[0003]	Depending on the length of the string of characters, the number of<br>
possible combinations of tokens can be high. However, it is generally necessary to<br>
perform the segmentation process at a fast rate.<br>
[0004]	An example of a short string of text is a domain name. A domain name<br>
can locate an organization or other entity on the Internet. For example, the domain<br>
name <www.google.com> locates the company Google Inc. at a specific IP address on<br>
the World Wide Web. It is desirable to be able to process a domain name into tokens,<br>
so that the tokens can be interpreted.<br>
The reference Theeramunkong (XP002508135 Thanaruk Theeramunkong &amp; Sasiporn<br>
Usanavasin, "Non dictionary based Thai word segmentation using decision trees" Human<br>
Language Technology Conference, Proceedings of the First International Conference on<br>
Human Language Technology Research, 18th March 2001 - 21st March 2001) is directed to a<br>
non-dictionary based Thai word segmentation using decision trees. A word segmentation<br>
method that uses a set of rules to combine contiguous characters to an inseparable unit (a<br>
Thai character cluster) and then applies a learned decision tree to combine these contiguous<br>
units to words.<br><br>
US62'69189 (Chanod) relates to a method of finding selected character strings by performing<br>
an automatic search of a text to find character strings that match any of a list of selected<br>
strings. The automatic search includes a series of iterations, each with a starting point in the<br>
text. Each iteration determines whether its starting point is followed by a character string<br>
that matches any of the list of selected strings and that ends at a probable string ending. Each<br>
iteration also finds a starting point for the next iteration that is a probable string beginning.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	Embodiments of the present invention comprise systems and methods for<br>
text segmentation. Embodiments identify tokens in strings of text. One aspect of an<br>
embodiment of the present invention comprises accessing a string of characters,<br>
determining any long tokens, pinning down contiguous characters in the long token,<br>
and determining tokens from the string of characters by keeping the pinned down<br>
contiguous characters together, and deterrnining a plurality of combinations of tokens<br>
for the string of characters, wherein the number of combinations of tokens is reduced<br>
by the pinned down contiguous characters. Multiple long tokens can be determined and<br>
contiguous characters are pinned down in each long token. Additional aspects of the<br>
present invention are directed to computer systems and to computer-readable media<br>
having features relating to the foregoing aspects.<br>

present invention. The same reference numbers are used throughout the drawings and<br>
the following description to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
[0011]	Various systems in accordance with the present invention may be<br>
constructed. FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary system in which exemplary<br>
embodiments of the present invention may operate. The present invention may operate,<br>
and be embodied in, other systems as well.<br>
[0012]	The system 100 shown in FIG. 1 includes multiple client devices 102a-n,<br>
a server device 104, and a network 106. The network 106 shown includes the Internet.<br>
In other embodiments, other networks, such as an intranet may be used. Moreover,<br>
methods according to the present invention may operate in a single computer. The<br>
client devices 102a-n shown each include a computer-readable medium, such as a<br>
random access memory (RAM) 108 in the embodiment shown, coupled to a processor<br>
110.<br>
[0013]	The processor 110 executes a set of computer-executable program<br>
instructions stored in memory 108. Such processors may include a microprocessor, an<br>
ASIC, and state machines. Such processors include, or may be in communication with,<br><br>
media, for example computer-readable media, which stores instructions that, when<br>
executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform the steps described herein.<br>
[0014]	Embodiments of computer-readable media include, but are not limited to,<br>
an electronic, optical, magnetic, or other storage or transmission device capable of<br>
providing a processor, such as the processor in communication with a touch-sensitive<br>
input device, with computer-readable instructions. Other examples of suitable media<br>
include, but are not limited to, a floppy disk, CD-ROM, magnetic disk, memory chip,<br>
ROM, RAM, an ASIC, a configured processor, all optical media, all magnetic tape or<br>
other magnetic media, or any other medium from which a computer processor can read<br>
instructions. Also, various other forms of computer-readable media may transmit or<br>
carry instructions to a computer, including a router, private or public network, or other<br>
transmission device or channel, both wired and wireless. The instructions may<br>
comprise code from any computer-programming language, including, for example, C,<br>
C++, C#, Visual Basic, Java, and JavaScript.<br>
[0015]	Client devices 102a-n may also include a number of external or internal<br>
devices such as a mouse, a CD-ROM, a keyboard, a display, or other input or output<br>
devices. Examples of client devices 102a-n are personal computers, digital assistants,<br>
personal digital assistants, mobile phones, smart phones, pagers, digital tablets, laptop<br>
computers, a processor-based device and similar types of systems and devices. In<br>
general, a client device 102a-n may be any type of processor-based platform connected<br>
to a network 106 and that interacts with one or more application programs. The client<br>
devices 102a-n shown include personal computers executing a browser application<br>
program such as Internet Explorer™, version 6.0 from Microsoft Corporation, Netscape<br><br>
Navigator™, version 7.1 from Netscape Communications Corporation, and Safari™,<br>
version 1.0 from Apple Computer.<br>
[0016]	Through the client devices 102a-n, users 112a-n can communicate over<br>
the network 106 with each other and with other systems and devices coupled to the<br>
network 106. As shown in FIG. 1, a server device 104 is also coupled to the network<br>
106.<br>
[0017]	The server device 104 shown includes a server executing a segmentation<br>
engine application program located in memory 118. Similar to the client devices 102a-<br>
n, the server device 104 shown includes a processor 116 coupled to a computer<br>
readable memory 118. Server device 104, depicted as a single computer system, may<br>
be implemented as a network of computer processors. Examples of a server device 104<br>
are servers, mainframe computers, networked computers, a processor-based device and<br>
similar types of systems and devices. Client processors 110 and the server processor<br>
116 can be any of a number of well known computer processors, such as processors<br>
from Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, California and Motorola Corporation of<br>
Schaumburg, Illinois. The server device 104 may also be connected to a database 126.<br>
[0018]	The server device 104, or related device, can access the network 106 to<br>
receive strings of characters from other devices or systems connected to the network<br>
106. Characters can include, for example, marks or symbols used in a writing system,<br>
including data representing a character, such as ASCII, ANSI, and EBCDIC or any<br>
other suitable character set.<br>
[0019]	In one embodiment, the segmentation engine 120 segments a string of<br>
characters into potential combinations of tokens. A token can comprise a word, a<br><br>
proper name, a geographic name, an abbreviation, an acronym, a stock market ticker<br>
symbol, or other tokens. The segmentation engine 120 includes a long token processor<br>
122 and a token processor 124. In the embodiment shown, each comprises computer<br>
code residing in the memory 118. The long token processor 122 matches known long<br>
tokens in a string of characters and pins down contiguous characters contained in the<br>
long token. The token processor 124 utilizes the pinned down characters to determine a<br>
list of possible combinations of tokens from the string of characters. In one<br>
embodiment, the token processor 124 determines a probability for each combination in<br>
the list. Other functions and characteristics of the long token processor 122 and the<br>
token processor 124 are further described below.<br>
[0020]	Server device 104 also provides access to other storage elements, such as<br>
a token storage element, in the example shown a token database 120. The token<br>
database can be used to store tokens. Data storage elements may include any one or<br>
combination of methods for storing data, including without limitation, arrays,<br>
hashtables, lists, and pairs. Other similar types of data storage devices can be accessed<br>
by the server device 104.<br>
[0021]	It should be noted that the present invention may comprise systems<br>
having different architecture than that which is shown in FIG. 1. For example, in some<br>
systems according to the present invention, the long token processor 122 may not be<br>
part of the segmentation engine 120 or may not be located on the same server device.<br>
The system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and is used to explain the<br>
exemplary method shown in FIGS. 2-3.<br><br>
[0022]	Various methods in accordance with the present invention may be carried<br>
out One exemplary method according to the present invention comprises accessing a<br>
string of characters, determining at least one long token, pinning down contiguous<br>
characters in the long token, determining tokens from the string of characters by<br>
keeping the pinned down contiguous characters together, and determining a plurality of<br>
combinations of tokens for the string of characters, wherein the number of<br>
combinations of tokens is reduced by the pinned down contiguous characters. Multiple<br>
long tokens can be determined and contiguous characters are pinned down in each long<br>
token. The exemplary method can also further comprise deterrnining a likelihood or a<br>
probability for each combination and providing the combination with the highest<br>
likelihood. Combinations with the highest likelihoods can also be provided to other<br>
applications or alternatively a user can be provided with combinations having relative<br>
high likelihoods and be allowed to choose the desired combination.<br>
[0023]	In one embodiment, the long token is greater than seven characters. The<br>
pinned down contiguous characters can be a set of characters from a second character<br>
of the long token to the next to the last character of the long token.<br>
[0024]	In one embodiment, determining token comprises accessing adjacent<br>
characters until a match between a first group of adjacent characters and a first token is<br>
found, and storing the first token if it is determined that the first token contains none of<br>
the pinned down characters or if it is determined that the first token contains all of the<br>
pinned down contiguous characters for a long token. Determining tokens can also<br>
further comprise receiving a next adjacent character to provide a revised first group of<br>
adjacent characters, deterrnining if the revised first group matches with a token, if the<br><br>
revised group matches with a second token then storing the second token if it is<br>
determined that the second token contains none of the pinned down characters or if it is<br>
determined that the second token contains all of the pinned down contiguous characters<br>
for a long token, and if the revised group does not match with a token men receiving a<br>
second group of adjacent characters. The second group of adjacent characters can<br>
begin with a character after a last character of the first stored token or it can begin after<br>
a previously determined token break. In one embodiment, these steps in determining<br>
tokens are repeated until a plurality of combinations of tokens have been determined.<br>
[0025]	FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary method according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. This exemplary method is provided by way of example, as there<br>
are a variety of ways to carry out methods according to the present invention. The<br>
method 200 shown in FIG. 2 can be executed or otherwise performed by any of various<br>
systems. The method 200 is described below as carried out by the system 100 shown in<br>
FIG. 1 by way of example, and various elements of the system 100 are referenced in<br>
explaining the example method of FIG. 2.<br>
[0026]	The method 200 shown provides a method for identifying tokens from a<br>
string of characters. Each block shown in FIG. 2 represents one or more steps carried<br>
out in the exemplary method 200. Referring to FIG. 2, in block 202, the example<br>
method 200 begins. Block 202 is followed by block 204, in which a string of<br>
characters is obtained by the segmentation engine 120. The string of characters can be<br>
obtained from a device connected to network 106, for example, or from another device.<br>
[0027]	Block 204 is followed by block 206, in which the long token processor<br>
122 determines any long tokens. A long token can be, for example, any token equal to<br><br>
or greater than eight characters. Any number of characters can be chosen as a long<br>
token. The long tokens can be received from token database 126, from a device<br>
connected to network 106, or from another device. The long token processor 122<br>
attempts to match long tokens with adjacent characters in the string of characters, m<br>
one embodiment, the long token processor 122 may start with the first character of the<br>
string and attempt to match the next adjacent seven adjacent characters with a known<br>
long token. If no token is found with the first eight characters, the long token<br>
processor 122 can move down the string starting with the second character and the next<br>
adjacent seven characters and so on until the end of the string is reached. Multiple long<br>
tokens can be found for each string of characters.<br>
[0028]	For example, for the string of characters '%ansformationofprobability',<br>
the long token processor 122 can start with the character "t" and the adjacent seven<br>
characters "ransfor". The long token processor 122 can determine that the characters<br>
"transfor" can potentially be matched to some long tokens, such as "transform" and<br>
"transformation". The long token processor 122 continues reading characters and<br>
attempting to match the characters. When, for example, the long token processor 122<br>
receives the character "m", the processor would match the characters with the long<br>
token "transform". However, when the next character is received, "a", the long token<br>
processor 122 continues receiving characters attempting to determine if the characters<br>
can be matched to a larger token, such as "transformation". In the example given, the<br>
characters could be matched to the token "transformation". When the next character<br>
"o" is received, the long token processor 122 would be unable to match the characters<br>
"transformationo" with a long token, so it can determine that the first fourteen<br><br>
characters should be matched with the token "transformation" and proceed processing.<br>
The long token processor 122 would be unable to match the next two sets of eight<br>
characters beginning with "o" and "f to any long tokens. The long token processor<br>
122 can then determine that the next group of characters "probabil" can be matched<br>
with a long token and would continue receiving characters. The long token processor<br>
122 can then match the long token "probability" with the remaining characters in the<br>
string.<br>
[0029]	Block 206 is followed by block 208, in which the long token processor<br>
pins down characters in the determined long tokens. By pinning the characters down,<br>
the long token processor 122 signifies that the characters should be used together in a<br>
single token. By pinning down characters of the long tokens of a text string the number<br>
of possible combinations of tokens in the text string is reduced, thereby, increasing the<br>
speed of the process. The long token processor 122 pins down contiguous characters in<br>
the center of a determined long token. In one embodiment, the long token processor<br>
122 pins down all the characters in a determined long token except a character at each<br>
end of the token. In the example above, for example, the long token processor can pin<br>
down the characters "ransformatio" of the determined long token "transformation" and<br>
can pin down the characters "robabilit" of the determined long token "probability".<br>
Alternatively, the long token processor 122 can leave two or three characters unpinned<br>
at the each end of a determined long token. In the described embodiment, characters<br>
are left unpinned at the ends of a token to avoid pinning down characters that appear to<br>
be a prefix or suffix of the long token, but are actually part of another token.<br><br>
[0030]	Block 208 is followed by block 210, in which the potential combinations<br>
of tokens are determined by the token processor 124. The long token processor 122<br>
transfers to the token processor 124 any pinned down characters determined in block<br>
208. The token processor 124 matches the string of characters to multiple tokens while<br>
considering any pinned down characters. The subroutine 210 continues until all<br>
potential token combinations have been identified and a list of all potential<br>
combinations of tokens is created. In one embodiment, the token processor 124 can<br>
"cut" one or more adjacent characters that it cannot match to a token in a particular<br>
combination. By cutting one or more adjacent characters, the cut characters are<br>
removed from consideration for matching with a token for a particular combination of<br>
tokens. For example, for the string of characters "formeheart" where the cutting of<br>
characters (represented with an "x") is permitted, the list of potential combinations of<br>
tokens may comprise: "for the heart", "fort heart", "fort he art", and "for x heart".<br>
[0031]	FIG. 3 illustrates a subroutine 210 for carrying out the method 200<br>
shown in FIG. 2. The subroutine 210 determines potential combinations of tokens for<br>
the string of characters. An example of the subroutine is as follows.<br>
[0032]	The subroutine begins at block 300. In block 300 a group of adjacent<br>
characters is received or accessed by the token processor 124. In one embodiment, at<br>
least two characters are received. Alternatively, one character can be received. In one<br>
embodiment, the token processor 124 begins at one end of the string of characters and<br>
works its way through the multiple potential paths of tokens for the string until all of<br>
the multiple possibilities of combinations of tokens for the string have been determined.<br><br>
[0033]	Block 300 is followed by block 303, in which the token processor 122<br>
determines if the received characters match to any token paths. In one embodiment, the<br>
tokens are stored in a tree-like structure where, for example, each character is at the top<br>
of the tree and each step down the tree adds a character of a token. For the token<br>
"apple", for example, "a" is at the top of the tree, followed by "p" the next step down,<br>
followed by "p" the next step down, followed by "1" the next step down, and followed<br>
by "e" the next step down. At each step down, the tree can branch off to other paths<br>
that form various other tokens. For example, for the token "applied", the token path is<br>
the same as "apple" for the characters "appl" and then branches to "i", then "e", and<br>
then "d" for "applied" instead of "e" for apple. One example of such a tree-like<br>
structure is a Ternary Tree. If in block 300, for example, the characters "tra" are<br>
received, at block 302 the token processor 122 can determine that at least one token<br>
path exists that begins with the characters "tra". In one embodiment, if only two<br>
characters are received, the token processor 124 attempts to match these two characters<br>
with a limited number of two letter tokens and does not attempt to match two characters<br>
with a token path.<br>
[0034]	If the characters processed in block 302 do not match to any token paths,<br>
then the token processor returns to block 300 and receives a new set of adjacent<br>
characters. For example, if the characters "12d" are received and these characters do<br>
not match to any token path, meaning that no tokens begin with the characters "12d,"<br>
the token processor returns to block 300 and receives a new group of adjacent<br>
characters. This can be, for example, the group starting with "2d". Subroutine 210 can<br>
be a recursive loop, such that the next set of adjacent characters can begin from any<br><br>
number of places in the string, such as the next character after the end of a found token.<br>
All potential token paths can be followed to determine all combinations of tokens that<br>
can be formed from the characters in the string. The number of combinations of tokens<br>
is reduced by pinning down the characters in long tokens.<br>
[0035]	If a token path is determined to exist in block 302, then in block 304 the<br>
token processor 124 determines if the group of characters match to a token. For<br>
example, if the characters "tra" have been received, the token processor determines<br>
whether a token exists for "tra".<br>
[0036]	If a token is not determined to exist in block 304, then in block 306 the<br>
next adjacent character is received by the token processor 124 to form a revised group<br>
of adjacent characters. The token processor 124, then can determine if the revised<br>
group matches any token paths in block 302. For the example,<br>
"transformationofprobability" after the characters "tra" are received the next adjacent<br>
character is "n" and the token processor 124 determines if "tran" matches a token path<br>
or paths. In this example, it does match several paths and the loop continues until a<br>
token is determined. For example, the loop continues until all of the characters<br>
"transform" are received, because, for example, "transform" is a token.<br>
[0037]	After a token is determined in block 304, the token processor 124 next<br>
determines whether any of the characters are pinned down. If none of the received<br>
characters are pinned down, then the token processor 124 notes the potential token<br>
break, receives the next adjacent character, and continues at block 302.<br>
[0038]	If the token processor 124 determines that some of the characters have<br>
been pinned down in block 308, the token processor 124 then determines in block 310<br><br>
whether all pinned down contiguous characters have been received. In the example<br>
above for "transformationofprobability" where the characters "transformation" are<br>
received, the token processor 124 determines that all of the adjacent pinned down<br>
characters have been received. If only the characters "trans" are received, for example,<br>
the token processor 124 determines that not all of the adjacent pinned down characters<br>
have been received. By not allowing tokens to be formed (or token breaks to occur)<br>
within the adjacent pinned down characters, the number of combinations of tokens for<br>
the character string can be greatly reduced.<br>
[0039]	If all adjacent pinned down characters have been received, the token<br>
processor 124 stores the token in block 312. The token processor then receives the next<br>
adjacent character in block 306 and continues the recursive loop at block 302.<br>
[0040]	If all adjacent pinned down characters have not been received, the token<br>
processor 124 receives the next adjacent character in block 306 and continues the<br>
recursive loop at block 302. In one embodiment, the determination of whether all<br>
adjacent pinned down characters have been received is not determined until after the<br>
next adjacent character is received. For example, if the characters "transform" are<br>
received, the token processor can note the potential token break. However, when the<br>
next adjacent character "a" is received and it is determined that this character has been<br>
pinned down, the potential token break after "transform" can be disregarded. When the<br>
remaining characters of "transformation" are received "transformation" is stored as a<br>
token. Alternatively, a potential token break after "transformation" can be stored<br>
instead of storing the token.<br><br>
[0041]'	After a known complete token is stored, the next adjacent character is<br>
received in block 306 and the token processor 124 continues with subroutine 210 at<br>
block 302. When a match with tokens is not found, the token processor 124 receives a<br>
new group of adjacent characters. In one embodiment, for example, the new group of<br>
adjacent characters can begin with the character after the last character of the smallest<br>
previously identified token. So that all potential token paths are explored and all<br>
potential combinations of tokens for the string are identified and a list of all potential<br>
token combinations is compiled.<br>
[0042]	Referring again to FIG. 2, block 210 is followed by block 212, in which<br>
the likelihood or probability for each combination in the list is determined by the token<br>
processor 124. In one embodiment, the likelihood of each combination is based on the<br>
frequency of the tokens in the combination. The frequency of tokens can be<br>
predetermined from an analysis of the World Wide Web. The frequency of each token<br>
in a combination can be multiplied together and then biased based on the number of<br>
words in the combination. Cut characters can be given a low likelihood.<br>
[0043]	The combination or combinations with the highest likelihood can then be<br>
used in further processing or passed on to a user, for example, depending on the<br>
application. Alternatively, a plurality of the top combinations based on likelihood can<br>
be presented to a user and the user can select the desired combination.<br>
[0044]	The present invention can be used in a variety of applications where the<br>
segmentation of text, such as a domain name, is needed. For example, the present<br>
invention can be used with a domain name advertising product on the Internet. If a user<br>
enters a domain name for a non-existing website, the segmentation engine can be used<br><br>
to segment the domain name entered, so that a website or advertisement relevant to the<br>
entered text can be presented to the user. Similarly, the present invention can be used<br>
to segment an entered domain name so that advertising relevant to the domain name<br>
can be displayed to the user. The present invention can also be used when a user<br>
desires to purchase a domain name, but the domain name is unavailable. The<br>
segmentation engine can segment the entered domain name and this information can be<br>
used to suggest other similar domain names that are available.<br>

should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but merely as<br>
