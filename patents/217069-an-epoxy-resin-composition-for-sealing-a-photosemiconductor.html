				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an epoxy resin composition for sealing a photosemiconductor, the epoxy resin composition having great solder resistance after moisture absorption.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Generally, airtight sealing is used for protecting opto-electronics parts such as photosemiconductor. When opto-electronics parts are sealed with a sealing agent, it is then required that the resulting sealing membrane has high light transmittance (transparency). Regarding opto-electronics parts requiring high reliability, generally, a process of airtight sealing with glass has been widely adopted. However, because the airtight sealing is costly and the productivity of opto-electronics parts is low, an economical resin sealing of general purpose parts has been gradually used for sealing common such parts. For resin sealing, generally, epoxy resin compositions are used. Then, acid anhydrides are used as curing agents. Cured materials of the epoxy resin compositions contain ester bonds formed by the reaction of acid anhydrides and epoxy group, so the ester bonds are hydrolyzed when the cured materials<br><br>
(for example, resin membranes for airtight sealing) are stored at high humidity. Therefore, the adhesion and transparency are disadvantageously deteriorated. Because wires in connection to photosemiconductor devices sealed with resins are sometimes cut by the thermal expansion of the sealing resins, an epoxy resin composition with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of<br>
105°C or more, preferably 110°C or more is needed.<br>
In case of airtight sealing having no epoxy resin composition using a phenol compound without ester bond as a curing agent, the resulting cured material (resin membrane for airtight sealing) can retain transparency after storage at high humidity. Therefore, the said curing agent is superior to curing agents using acid anhydrides. However, in recent years, a new problem of the occurrence of peeling in the adhesive face between the sealed resin and the lead frame during solder reflow after moisture absorption has now been drawing attention because of higher solder melting temperatures (solder resistance after moisture absorption). Particularly, not any cured resin (sealing material) satisfying all the required conditions has been obtained yet from epoxy resin compositions using any of the curing agents for Ag-plated lead frames. Additionally, JP-A-2001-2758 proposes an epoxy resin composition using terpene backbone-containing polyvalent phenol as a curing agent. The cured material obtained from the epoxy resin composition can overcome some of the disadvantages of the conventional art,<br><br>
however, it is not sufficiently satisfactory. It is an object of the invention to provide an epoxy resin composition for sealing photosemiconductor, which can produce a resin-sealed photosemiconductor with great solder reflow resistance after moisture absorption and has great processability (productivity of sealed photosemiconductor device).<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>

Consequently, the inventors have found that an epoxy resin composition capable of overcoming the problems described above for photosemiconductor can be obtained by using at least one resin as the component D, which is selected from the group consisting of epoxy resins except for the component (A) and novolak resins as curing agents, in combination with an epoxy resin as the component (A), a terpene backbone-containing polyvalent phenol curing agent as the component (B) and a curing-promoting agent (C).

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
The epoxy resin as the component (A) for use In the present invention (also referred to as epoxy resin (A) hereinafter) contains the said low molecular epoxy resins where n is 0, 1 or 2 in the formula (1) at 10% by weight or more (the term "%" means "% by weight" hereinbelow unless otherwise stated), preferably 15% or more, more preferably 20% or more of the total weight of the epoxy resin (A). Satisfactorily, the epoxy resin (A) may wholly comprise such low moleculau: epoxy resins. The content thereof is preferably 80% or less, more preferably 60% or less, still more preferably 50% or less, and most preferably 40% or less. The low molecular epoxy resins may comprise any one type of such epoxy resins where n is 0, 1 or 2 or may comprise a mixture of two or more thereof where n is 0, 1 and 2. Generally, the low molecular epoxy resins comprise the three thereof in<br><br>
mixture. The contents of the individual epoxy resins in the total of the low molecular epoxy resins are not specifically limited. Generally, however, the content of the low molecular epoxy resin with n = 0 is 30% or less; the content of such low molecular epoxy resin with n = 1 is 25 to 40%; and such low molecular epoxy resin with n = 2 occupies the remaining part. The content of the low molecular epoxy resin with n = 2 is preferably 30% or more, more preferably 40% or more. Epoxy resins containing such low molecular epoxy resins can be commercially available, for example epoxy resins manufactured by Toto Chemical, Co., Ltd. and Mitsui Chemical, Inc. Hereinafter, in some cases, the epoxy resin with n = 0 is referred to as 0 nucleus; n = 1, as 1 nucleus; and n = 2, as 2 nucleus.<br>
Because the bisphenol-type epoxy resin is generally in a mixture of a great number of epoxy resin molecules with n = 0 to about 20 in the formula (1), it is necessary to elucidate the ratio of such low molecular epoxy resins (0 nucleus, 1 nucleus and 2 nucleus) in the epoxy resin used in accordance with the invention. As the method, GPC (gel permeation chromatography) analysis is effective.<br>
Analytical conditions are exemplified. Example of GPC assay conditions<br>

By using such coupling agents, a cured material with highly reliable moisture resistance and smaller decrease of the adhesion strength after moisture absorption can be obtained.<br>
The epoxy resin composition of the invention can be prepared by homogenously mixing together the epoxy resin of the formula (1) of the component (A), the curing agent of the component (B) (other curing agents may be used in combination if necessary), the curing-promoting agent of the component (C) and either one or both of another epoxy resin except for the epoxy resin of the component (A) and the novolak resin curing agent as the component (D), and additionally other additives if necessary, for example coupling agents, colorants and leveling agents as components to be blended, and appropriately molding the resulting mixture if necessary. When the blend components are solid, for example, the said composition is mixed together with blenders<br><br>
such as Henschel mixer and nauta mixer.  Subsequently, the<br>
resulting mixture is kneaded at 80 to 120°C with kneaders, extruders, and heated rolls and is then cooled, which is pulverized into a powder form, to obtain the epoxy resin composition of the invention. When the blend components are liquid, meanwhile, the said components are homogenously mixed together with a planetary mixer and the like, to prepare the epoxy resin composition of the invention.<br>
The resin composition has good workability and great productivity of sealed photosemiconductor and the photosemiconductor sealed with the cured material of the composition has great solder reflow resistance.<br>
The solder reflow resistance is now specifically described.<br>
The solder reflow resistance is generally evaluated on the basis of the ratio of the peeled area of the cured resin from the lead frame on the resin-sealed photosemiconductor device. When the resin-sealed photosemiconductor device obtained using the epoxy resin composition of the invention is immersed in a<br>
soldering bath at a temperature of 260°C for 30 seconds, the ratio of the peeled area is 10% or less, preferably 5% or less. The ratio of the peeled area when the said device is left to stand under conditions of 30°Cx 70% RH for 48 hours (after moisture absorption) is 60% or less. When preferable one of the epoxy resin composition of the invention is used, the ratio of the<br><br>
peeled area is the same as described above even under conditions of a soldering bath temperature of 270°C and 30-second immersion, while the ratio of the peeled area after moisture absorption is 60% or less.<br>
Further, the glass transition point (Tg) (measured with TMA (thermomechanical analyzer) at a condition of temperature-raising rate of 2°C /min)) of the cured material of the said preferable resin composition is 105°C or more, preferably 110°C or more. Thus, the cured material sufficiently passes through the heat cycle test for resin-sealed photosemiconductors.<br>
So as to produce a sealed semiconductor device using the epoxy resin composition thus obtained in accordance with the invention, the semiconductor face of a semiconductor device is covered with the said resin composition, which is then cured, to seal the semiconductor face in air tight. In case that the epoxy resin composition of the invention is solid, more specifically, the epoxy resin composition of the invention is filled in a molding machine such as low-pressure transfer molding machine to completely cover the semiconductor face of a semiconductor device, and then primarily cured at 100 to 200°C, to prepare a molded article. Drawing out the molded article from the mold of the molding machine and again heating the molded<br>
article in an oven and the like at 100 to 200°C for complete curing, the sealed photosemiconductor device of the invention<br><br>
can be obtained. In case that the epoxy resin composition is liquid, meanwhile, the epoxy resin composition of the invention is poured in a mold placing an photosemiconductor device therein, for casting or dispensing so as to completely cover the photosemiconductor face with the composition. Heating then at<br>
100 to 200°C, the epoxy resin composition is cured to prepare the sealed photosemiconductor device of the invention.<br>
The sealed photosemiconductor device of the invention includes a receiving optics and a light emitting element, which are sealed with the epoxy resin composition of the invention. Additionally, semiconductor parts integrating the device thereon include for example DIP (dual in-line package), QFP (quad flat package), BGA (ball grid array), CSP (chip size package), SOP (small out-line package), TSOP (thin small out-line package), and TQFP (thin quad flat package).<br>

Curing agent 2: terpene backbone-containing novolak type polyf unctional phenol curing agent (174 g/eq phenol equivalent) (novolak type polyfunctional phenol-dded to limonene) Curing agent 3: bisphenol novolak curing agent (118 g/eq phenol equivalent) (bisphenol A novolak resin) Promoting agent: triphenylphosphine (TPP)<br>
Examples Example A<br>
The epoxy resins (EPOXY 1, EPOXY 2, EPOXY 3. EPOXY 4), the curing agents (Curing agents 1, 2 and 3) and the curing promoting agent (TPP) shown below in Table 1 were placed at blend ratios shown in Table 1 in a blender, for mixing to homogeneity.<br><br>
The resulting mixtures were kneaded together under melting at a resin temperature of 60°C to 100°C with a biaxial kneader. The resulting kneaded materials were once cooled, pulverized with a pulverizer and tableted with a tableting machine, to prepare the epoxy resin compositions of the invention.<br>
Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3<br>
40 g each of the compositions (numerical figures means "part") in Table 1 shown below was filled in a mold loading a imitation lead frame (8 cm in longitudinal direction, 2 cm in crosswise direction) prepared by plating a 12-PIN SOP copper-made lead frame plated by Ag without gloss, using a low-pressure transfer, for molding at a mold temperature of 150°C and a release time period of 5 minutes. The resulting molded articles were post-cured at 150°C for one hour, to completely cure the epoxy resin compositions and to prepare pseudo-devices sealed with the cured materials of the inventive resin compositions.<br>
These devices were left to stand alone for 48 hours under a condition (a) without moisture absorption or (b) of 30°C x 70% RH. Then, the devices were immersed in a solder bath at given temperatures for 30 seconds to observe the ratio of the resin-peeled area from the lead frame with a microscope. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
on the basis of the mean ratio of resin peeled area from lead<br>
frame in a sealed photosemiconductor device number (n) =5. The<br>
results were ranked on the following standards.<br>
Peeled at 0 to 30%: O<br>
Peeled at 30 to 60%: A<br>
Peeled at 60 to 90%: x<br>
Peeled at 90% or more: xx.<br>
Herein, the mean ratio of the resin peeled area was calculated as follows.<br>
The lead frame made immersion treatment in a soldering bath was photographed. Based on the photopicture, the peeled area was determined to calculate the area. The ratio of the area to the total lead frame area was expressed by %.<br>
Table 2<br><br><br>
The test of the thermal resistance for HC was carried out as follows. Test method<br>
Using a low-pressure transfer, the epoxy resin compositions of the invention were filled in a mold for sealing photosemiconductor device, for molding at a mold temperature of 150°Candarelease time periodof 5 minutes, and then post-cured. The curing was on completion under a condition of 150°C x one hour to complete the curing. The resulting cured materials were cut into a piece of a size of 10 mm x 25 mm2 (the height x the bottom area) . Tg was measured under a condition of a temperature raise of 2°C /min, by TMA (thermal mechanical analyzer).<br>
