				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a low temperature process for the production of hydrogen from methane or methane rich hydrocarbons and steam. More particularly the present invention relates to a low temperature process for the production of hydrogen from methane or methane rich hydrocarbons and steam using a group VIII metal oxide (s) containing solid catalysts in two parallel reactors. The present invention also particularly relates to a process for the continuous production of hydrogen from methane or methane rich hydrocarbons and steam at low temperature below 650°C using a group VIII metal oxide(s) containing solid catalyst in two parallel reactors operated in a cyclic manner for the decomposition of methane or methane rich hydrocarbons to hydrogen and carbon, which is deposited on the catalyst, and fro the gasification of the carbon deposited on the catalyst by steam in the presence or absence of oxygen.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The demand for hydrogen is increasing day by day for hydrotereating processes in petroleum industries and also for hydrogen fuel cells, both stationary and non-stationary fuel cells. Since hydrogen is a non-polluting fuel, its use as a fuel particularly fro fuel cells used in the automobile transport has been increasing very fast. However, hydrogen fuel cells require carbon monoxide free hydrogen as a fuel to avoid deactivation of the noble metal catalyst in the fuel cells.<br>
The main natural sources of hydrogen are hydrocarbons and water. Amongst hydrocarbons, methane has the highest hydrogen to carbon ratio and is hence the most preferred choice amongst hydrocarbons for hydrogen conversion.<br>
Conventional processes for the production of hydrogen are based on steam reforming of hydrocarbons, such as naphtha and methane or natural gas and auto thermal reforming of hydrocarbons, particularly heavier hydrocarbons. Hydrogen production processes have been recently reviewed by Fierro and co-workers [Pena, M.A., Gomez, J.P., and Fierro, J.L.G., Applied Catalysis A: General; volume 144, page 7-57, 1996].<br>
The prior art processes of hydrocarbon steam reforming and auto thermal reforming are operated at high temperatures of over about 900°C and the product stream of these processes contains appreciable amounts of carbon monoxide along with hydrogen. The prior art processes also suffer from the disadvantage that removal of carbon monoxide at low concentrations from hydrogen is very expensive. The high cost factor involved in the separation of carbon    monoxide   from    hydrogen and   limitations   of high   temperature required<br><br><br>
for operation renders both prior art processes uneconomical for the production of carbon monoxide free hydrogen.<br>
The prior art also discloses processes for the production of carbon monoxide free hydrogen from methane at low temperatures of below 600°C. Recently, Kikuchi has described a process based on steam reforming of methane in a membrane reactor to produce hydrogen free of carbon monoxide (Kikuchi, E., Hydrogen permselective membrane reactors, CATTECH, March 1997, pages 67 - 74, Balzer Science Publishers). Kikuchi discloses the use of a Pd/ceramic composite membrane for steam reforming of methane over a commercial supported nickel catalyst at temperatures as low as 500°C, to obtain methane conversion to carbon monoxide free hydrogen of upto 100 %. The hydrogen produced in this process by the steam reforming of methane is continuously removed form the reaction system by the selective permeation of hydrogen through the Pd-membrane. However, this process suffers from the following limitations or drawbacks: 1) Because of the use of a number of Pd-membrane tubes, the capital costs are very high; 2) potential for the deactivation of the Pd-membrane due to the deposition of carbonaceous matter exists; 3) membrane stability is a problem; 4) there is a possibility of membrane failure due to the formation of pin holes in the membrane.<br>
Japanese patent JP 09234372 A2 of September 2, 1997 discloses a process for the manufacture of hydrogen by thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons at 200°C - 1000°C using a catalyst containing nickel, alkali or alkaline earth compounds.<br>
Russian patent RU 2071932 Cl of January 20, 1997 discloses the production of hydrogen and carbon by the thermal decomposition of methane on nickel catalyst. Japanese patent JP 11228102 A2 discloses reactors for the thermal decomposition of methane to form carbon and hydrogen.<br>
Hydrogen production by catalytic cracking of methane or natural gas and other hydrocarbons below 900°C is disclosed in a few publications [Zhang, T and Amiridis, M. D., Applied Catalysis A: General, Volume 167, pages 161-172, 1998; Muradov, N. Z., Energy Fuels, Volume 12, pages 41 - 48, 1998; Kuvshinov, G. G., et al, Hydrogen Energy Progress XI Proceedings of the World Hydrogen.Eneigy. Conference, 11th, Volume 1, pages 655 - 660, edited by Veziroglu, T., 1996; Muradov, N. Z., " ^edings of US DOE Hydrogen Program Review, volume 1, page 513 - 535, 1996].<br>
While the hydrogen produced in the above prior art processes, based on catalytic cracking or thermo-catalytic decomposition of methane and other hydrocarbons, is free from carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, the rate of deactivation of the catalyst is high due to the<br><br>
carbon formed and deposited on the catalyst accompanied by an increase in the pressure drop across the catalyst bed. This makes the above processes unsuitable for hydrogen production on a commercial scale.<br>
Choudhary and Goodman recently report a process for the production of carbon monoxide free hydrogen involving step wise methane stream reforming [Choudhary, T. V. and Goodman, D. W., Catalysis Letter, volume 59, page 93 - 94, 1999]. In this process, methane pulse and water pulses are alternately passed over a pre-reduced nickel based catalyst at 375°C. When methane pulse is passed over the catalyst, the methane from the pulse decomposes to hydrogen and carbon, leaving the carbon deposited on the catalyst. When the water pulse is passed over the catalyst with carbon deposited thereon, the carbon on the catalyst reacts with steam to form COz, hydrogen and methane. In this process, although the carbon monoxide free hydrogen is produced by the catalytic cracking of methane and the carbon deposited on the catalyst is removed by the cyclic operation of the methane and water pulses in the same reactor, the process is not operated in steady state and hydrogen production is not continuous. It is therefore not practical or economical to produce carbon monoxide free hydrogen on large scale by this transient process involving cyclic operation of the methane and water pulses.<br>
In view of the above mentioned drawbacks and limitations of prior art processes, there is a pressing need to develop a continuous process for the production of carbon monoxide-free hydrogen by catalytic decomposition of methane or natural gas at low temperature of below 600°C, thereby avoiding the carbon build up on the catalyst by its periodic removal. Objects of the invention<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a low temperature process for the continuous production of hydrogen from methane or methane rich hydrocarbons and steam.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a process for the continuous production of hydrogen from methane or methane rich hydrocarbons and steam that is cost effective.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a process for the continuous production of hydrogen that is carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide free and is useful as a fuel.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the production of hydrogen that is carbon monoxide or carbon'dioxide free in while avoiding build up of carbon on the catalysts.<br>
It is another object to provide a low temperature process for the continuous production of hydrogen from methane or methane rich hydrocarbons and steam that avoids<br><br>
The problem of high cost involved in the removal of carbon monoxide from hydrogen at low concentration and is therefore cost effective.<br>

EXAMPLES 1 - 10<br>
These example illustrate the process of this invention for the production of hydrogen from methane and steam, using NiO - ZrOj (Ni/Zr mole ratio =1.0) catalyst at different process conditions.<br>
The NiO-ZrO2 catalyst was prepared by coprecipitating mixed hydroxides of nickel and zirconium from a 650cm3 aqueous solution containing 58.78g Ni(NO3)2.6H2O and 46.76g ZrO(NO3)2-H2O using an aqueous solution of NaOH at a pH of 9.0 at room temperature, filtering and thoroughly washing.the precipitate at,105°C for 18h, pressing and crushing to particles of 0.3 - 0.4 mm size and calcining in air at 600°C for 2h. The surface area of the catalyst was 63 m2g"1.<br>
The process of this invention using the NiO-ZrCh catalyst was carried out in two parallel stainless steel fixed bed reactors. Each reactor was packed with 0.4g catalyst particle and was kept in a tubular furnace. Each of the two parallel reactors had a different gaseous feed but both the reactors had a common outlet. A flow switch valve was connected to the two reactors for switching the two different feeds between the two reactors regularly at an interval of time. The reactor temperature was measured by a Chromel - Alumel thermocouple located at the centre of the catalyst bed in both the reactors. The catalyst in both the reactors was reduced by passing a H2-N2 mixture over the catalyst in both the reactors at the conditions given in Table - 1. After the reduction of catalyst in both the reactors, Feed - A containing methane with or without nitrogen was passed over the reduced catalyst in Reactor - A and simultaneously Feed - B containing steam with or without nitrogen and/or oxygen was passed over the reduced catalyst in Reactor - B, while switching Feed - A and Feed - B between two reactor regularly at an interval of time, at the catalytic process conditions given in Table- 1.<br>
The gaseous products obtained from both the reactors were combined and cooled by passing them through a chilled water condenser to 2-3°C for removing the water from them by condensation. The water-free gaseous products were collected in a gas holder for a reaction period of six hours. The collected gaseous products were analysed by gas chromatograph using a spherocarb column and thermal conductivity detector. For the gas "hromatographic analysis of hydrogen in the products, high purity nitrogen was used as a carrier gas. Whereas, for the gas chromatographic analysis of the methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide present in the products, helium was used as a carrier gas. The results obtained at the different process conditions are presented in Table -1.<br><br>

The NiO/Ce-NaY (10 wt% Ni, 72% Ce-exchanged NaY) ws prepared by impregnating 5.0g particles (0.3 - 0.4mm of size) 72% Ce-exchange NaY (prepared by the procedure given in the reference: Choudhary, V.R., Srinivasan, K.R. and Akolekar, D.B., Zeolites, volume 9, page 115-119, year 1989) with 2.75g Ni(NO3)2.6H2O from its aqueous solution by the incipient wetness technique, followed by drying at 105°C for 12h and calcining at 500°C for 2h.<br>
The process of this invention over each of the above catalysts was carried out in the parallel reactors and following the procedure same as that described in the earlier examples (Examples 1-10), at the catalyst reduction conditions and catalytic process conditions given in Table - 2. The results, the methane conversion and the hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced in the process of this invention over the above mentioned catalysts are included in Table 2.<br>
Table 1: Hydrogen production by the process of this invention using NiO-ZrOj catalyst, at different process conditions.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
1.	Unlike the prior art steam reforming and auto thermal reforming processes, the<br>
process of this present investigation operates at low temperature, below about 650°C.<br>
Because of the low temperature operation, the process of this invention requires less<br>
energy and lower capital. Also since the water gas shift reaction CO + H2O = COj +<br>
Hj is thermodynamically favoured at lower temperatures, there is almost no net<br>
formation of carbon monoxide in the process of this invention; at below 600°C there<br>
is no formation of carbon monoxide in the process of this invention.<br>
2.	Unlike the prior art steam reforming and auto thermal reforming processes, carbon<br>
monoxide-free hydrogen can be produced by the process of this invention.<br>
3.	Unlike the prior art steam reforming and auto thermal reforming processes, the<br>
conversion of methane and steam take place separately in two different reactors, two<br>
parallel reactors, each having a different feed, and the two different feeds one<br>
comprising methane and second comprising steam with or without oxygen, are<br>
switched regularly between the two reactors at an interval of time so that when<br>
methane decomposition reaction take place in one reactor producing hydrogen and<br>
carbon deposited on the catalyst, at the same time the gasification of the carbon by its<br>
reaction with steam and oxygen, producing carbon dioxide and hydrogen, takes place<br>
in the second reactor, and this two reactions in two separate reactors take place in<br>
cyclic manner, so that there is no build up of carbon on the catalyst in both the parallel<br>
reactors.<br>
4.	Unlike the prior art processes based on low temperature methane decomposition, the<br>
production of carbon monoxide free hydrogen in the process of this invention is<br>
continuous without build up of carbon on the catalyst and consequently without the<br>
build up of a large pressure drop across the catalyst bed and also without the catalyst<br>
deactivation by carbon deposition or cooking.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A low temperature continuous process for the production of hydrogen from<br>
methane and/ or natural gas and / or methane-rich hydrocarbons and steam using a<br>
solid catalyst comprising group VIII metal oxides(s) in two parallel reactors,<br>
which comprises:<br>
i)	Characterized in that reducing the solid catalyst in both the reactors by<br>
contacting the catalyst comprising group VIII metal oxides(s) with a gaseous feed comprising a reducing agent at a concentration in the range of 1 mole%<br>
to 100 mole%, at a gas hourly space velocity in the range of 100  cm3g-1h-1 to 1000  cm3g-1h-1 at a temperature in the range of 350°C to 650°C and at a pressure of at least 1.0 atm from a time period in the range of 1 to 100 hour, ii) contacting a first gaseous feed comprising methane and/or natural gas and/or methane rich hydrocarbons, at a gas hourly space velocity in the range of 50  cm3g-1h-1 to 50,000  cm3g-1h-1 with the said solid catalyst reduced in step i) in a first reactor at a temperature in the range from 300°C to 650°C and at a pressure of at least 1 atmosphere, and simultaneously contacting a second gaseous feed comprising steam with the said solid catalyst reduced in step i) in a second reactor, at the same gas hourly space velocity, temperature and pressure as that employed in first reactor while regularly switching over the two feeds, first and second gaseous feeds between the two parallel reactors, at an interval of time in the range of 0.1 min to about 100 min, to obtain a mixed product stream comprising hydrogen from the two reactors.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the group VIII metal oxides are selected from oxides of Fe, Ni, Ru, Pd, Pt, Ir and Os.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein in step i), the reducing agent is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or a mixture thereof.<br><br>
4.	A process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein in step i), the mole concentration of the reducing agent is in the range of 5 mole% to 50 mole%.<br>
5.	A process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein in step i), the gas hourly space velocity is in the range from 500 cm3g-1h-1 to 20,000 cm3g-1h-11.<br>
6.	A process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein in step i), the temperature is in the range of 400°C to 600°C.<br>
7.	A process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein in step i), the reduction period is in the range of 1h to 20h.<br>
8.	A low temperature process for the production of hydrogen substantially as herein described with reference to the examples.<br></td>
