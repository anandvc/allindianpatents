Conservatives estimates predict a nearly 50% increase in the current world population of approximately six billion people by the year 2050 (1998 United Nations. 1998 Revision of the official United Nations population estimates and projections. World population nearing 6 billion projected close to 9 billion by 2050, Population Division of the Department of Economics and Social Affairs. United Nations, New York, 1998). This potential over-population, particularly in developing countries, is further complicated by the non-availability of proper easy-to-use, simple, cheap, least toxic and non-invasive method of contraception.

On the other hand, vasectomy and ligation of Fallopian tube never became popular because of their various complications, irreversibility and problems of recannuiation.<br>
The intrauterine devices (lUDs) also cause several complications, including uterine perforations, occasional bleeding etc.<br><br>
The vaginal preparations are however relatively popular all over the world amongst the motivated couples, and because of their local and non-systemic application. However, these never give 100% contraceptive assurance.<br>
The vaginal contraceptive compositions marketed in the USA primarily utilize nomonic detergents (surfactants) as their active ingredient. Of these, the most commonly used is nonoxynol-9 (N-9). Although N-9 is an extremely potent sperm immobilizing agent in vitro, but the marketed preparations are encountered with failures due to several reasons including the possibility of escape of first fraction of ejaculated sperms from its interaction with the active agents. In addition, N-9 can interfere with the natural vaginal environment and can cause irritation at a concentration that is recommended for use. N-9 and other spermicidal agents that have surfactant and cytotoxic properties have been proposed to prevent conception as a dispersing agent in spermicidal preparations (namely, Delfen, Gentersal and Ortho-Creme). However, relatively high failure rate of these surfactants in preventing pregnancies as well as evidence of adverse side effects have been documented (Stafford et al., 1998 - Stafford, MK, Ward, H, Flanagan, A, Rosenstein, U, Taylor-Robinson, D, Smith, JR, Weber, J and Kitchen, VS. Safety study of nonoxynol-9 as a vaginal microbicide : evidence of adverse effects. Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, 17 : 327-331, 1998., Roddy et al., 1998 -Roddy, RE, Zekeng, L, Ryan, KA, Tamoufe, U, Weir, SS and Wong, EL. A controlled trial of nonoxynol-9 film to reduce male-to-female transmission of sexually transmitted diseases -New England Journal of Medicine, 339: 504-510, 1998 and Homn. RE, Foldesy, RG and Hahn, DW. ORF 13904, a new long-acting vaginal contraceptive. Contraception, 32: 267-274,1985).<br>
For the last few decades, clove oil is being used in dental cream, mouthwash and various medicinal preparations at concentrations much higher than that cause sperm immobilization.<br>
For these reasons, it is imperative that a new type of highly active ingredient be identified and developed for vaginal contraceptive use, as it will be noninvasive and is expected to have least or no side effects.<br><br>

Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Fig. 1 shows the results of this experiment where different dilution of clove oil was examined on human, hamster and rat sperm motility. Clove oil addition in different dilution immobilized the sperm in a dose dependent manner. 10° dilution effected 100% immobilization of human, hamster and rat sperm in 15 sec. There was practically very little difference between the doses and the source of sperm sample.<br>
The invention is further described in the form of the following examples, which shall not be construed as a limit to the scope of the invention.<br>
Sperm Immobilizing Assays:<br>
Inhibition and immobilization of human sperm motility were evaluated by mixing 100 U.L of test solution with 100 jaL of freshly ejaculated semen. Immediately after mixing (within 10 seconds), the percentage of motile spermatozoa was determined by microscopic examination (400x and lOOx). At higher dilution incubation time was 60 seconds. The dose-response data have been presented in <br>
Other Techniques:<br>
Hyaiuronidase (EC 3,2.1.35) activity was quantified with hyaluronic acid as a substrate. This was measured by determining the concentration of N-acetylglucosamine reactive material, resulting from enzyme action Table 4(a).<br>
Human acrosin (EC 3.4.21.10) activity was measured by following the kinetics of change in optical density at 253nm; the hydrolysis of N-«=-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester (BAEE) was quantified Table 4(b).<br>
Nucleoddases were assayed by using 5'-AMP and (3-glycerophosphate as substrate, and the enzyme activities are expressed in terms of free phosphates that are released Table 4(c).<br>
Caudal spermatozoa from rats and hamsters and ejaculated sperm from six normospermic human donor (aged between 30-37) were used to observe clove oil effect in the motility of sperm. Clove oil was diluted to 1000 times and added to the sperm sample. Human sperm after collection were allowed to liquefy at 37°C for 30 minutes. The liquefied samples were diluted with equal volume of Ham's F-10 medium and centnfuged at 5000 g for 10 minutes. Sperm pellets were then layered with 1.0 ml of Ham's F-10 medium and were incubated at 37°C which permitted the progressive swimming up of the motile cells and counted in a Makler's chamber. Only the cells with high motility were used in the experiments. Hamster and rat sperm were diluted in HWW medium (94 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCI, 1.7 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSCu, 7H2O, 25 mM NaHCCb, 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate, 19 mM sodium acetate, 5 mM glucose, 0.4% BSA, 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin, pH 7.2), pre equilibrated in a C02 incubator for 30 minutes to swim them up and only highly motile sperm were selected and centnfuged at 1000 g for 2 minutes. The pellet containing highly motile sperm were diluted in BWW medium and counted in a Makler's chamber. In all the cases, i.e. human, hamster and rat, 25-35 million sperm were taken for clove oil experiment.<br>
her this immobilization was due to the death of the sperm by clove oil or not was tested by using cosin-nigrosin vital dye uptake and this clearly showed mortality of the sperm. The same concentration of clove oil did not show any adverse effect on vaginal epithelial cells; therefore appears to be safe for its probable use as vaginal contraceptive.<br>
How clove oil at a dilution of 10"J can completely immobilize, human, hamster and rat sperm by causing death to them is not yet clear. Since there is a possibility to immobilize through the destabilization of sperm membrane architecture, we selected two sperm membrane bound enzyme, acrosin and 5'-nucleotidase as markers to study this aspect. The outer envelope of most of the mammalian spermatozoa is rich in polar phospholipid and any alteration to this phospholipid affects sperm motility or survival. Acrosome matrix is a part of this complex where acrosin remains in the bound form. Any disturbance in membrane architecture induces acrosome reaction, which in turn results acrosin release. Similarly, 5'-nucleotidase is an enzyme bound to the membrane of sperm. This enzyme anchors glycophosphatidylinositol network in the sperm membrane and therefore when it gets free from its anchorage, an alteration in membrane structure is expected. Tables 6 and 7 demonstrate the result of clove oil addition (at a dilution of 10~J) to the sperm of six human donors. Both acrosin and 5'-nucleotidase activities could be located in the supernatant fraction on clove oil treatment. In the control sperm, both the marker enzyme activities was obtained in the sperm pellet where supernatant showed very little activity. On treating the human sperm with clove oil, the marker enzyme activities were found to be located in the supernatant which clearly shows the detachment of the enzymes from the membrane architecture. These results strongly suggest clove oil target to be the sperm membrane and by acting through the membrane, it destabilizes the sperm structure causing immobilization and death. All these are novel findings with clove oil that supports its use as an effective contraceptive.<br>
