• PATENT APPLICATION OF<br>
GARRY TSAUR—<br>
FOR	<br>
SEALED CONTAINER<br><br>
BACKGROUND-FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a sealed container. More specifically, the present invention relates to a sealed container that may be used as the body of a cotton swab.<br>
BACKGROUND-DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Containers that enclose fluids to be stored and transported are often inconvenient to use and most requires an applicator or other tools to extract the fluid. Storage of fluids such as solvents and alcohol present a special consideration due to the evaporation of the fluids. Various designs exist for various applications. Containers may be as large as a tank for storing liquids such as water. Containers may also be as small as bottles for perfumes or smaller. Containers may also be made of various suitable materials for any particular environment and liquid.<br><br>
The present invention is a small elongated sealed container that can be used as the body of a cotton swab and also for storing fluids wherein the fluid in the sealed container may be released into the cottons attached to the ends of the cotton swab when desired. The sealed container of the present invention is particularly suited for the storage of solvents, alcohol, and other fluids that evaporates easily.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a sealed container that stores fluid in a sealed environment and is easily transportable. The contents of the sealed container can be easily extracted completely without any tools or contact with the user. The sealed container can be used as the body of a cotton swab and also for storing fluids wherein the fluid in the sealed container may be released into the cottons attached to the ends of the cotton swab when desired.<br>
The sealed container of the present invention is an elongated sealed container with one or more opening means near its ends. The sealed container is divided into two compartments that allow fluid to move between them. The sealed container may be used for storage of fluids such as solvents and alcohol without evaporation of the fluid.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
embodiment of the sealed<br>
means in the form of scores on the sealed container with an elongated tube that is open at both<br><br><br><br>
in {J3.rntr flnd sho-rtp-r in Ifinoth thsn th£ s^sl^d cont3.in£F inserted, into th<br><br>

STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a sealed container used as the body of a cotton swab and also for storing fluids, said container comprising of a sealed elongated housing with one or more opening means such as herein described; a divider separating the sealed elongated housing into multiple compartments that allow free flow of fluids between them; wherein the sealed container may be used to store fluids until the fluid is released through the opening means.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the preferred embodiment of the sealed container with two opening means in the form of scores on the sealed container with an elongated tube that is open at both ends and is smaller in diameter and shorter in length than the sealed container inserted into the sealed container separating the sealed container into two cylindrical compartments.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows another embodiment of the sealed container with two opening means in the form of scores on the sealed container with a divider separating the sealed container into two compartments.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Figure 1 shows the preferred embodiment of the sealed container. The sealed container has an elongated housing 1 with two ends that are sealed. An opening means 2 in the form of a score on the sealed container is located near each of the two ends. An elongated tube 3 that is open at both ends and is smaller in diameter and shorter in length than the elongated housing 1 is inserted into the elongated housing 1 separating the elongated housing 1 into two cylindrical compartments. A fluid 4 is sealed within the elongated housing 1 until released through the opening means 2. In the preferred embodiment, a cotton ball 5 is attached to the ends of the sealed container enclosing the opening means 2 to absorb the fluid 4 when it is released from the sealed container.<br>
Figure 2 shows another embodiment of the sealed container wherein the elongated housing 1 is divided into two compartments by a divider 6 that span across the width of the elongated housing 1 and is shorter than the length of the elongated housing 1 and which allows the movement of fluids 4 between the two compartments within the elongated housing 1 at both ends of the elongated housing 1.<br>
The sealed container of the present invention allows a fluid 4 that evaporates easily, such as solvents and alcohol, to be stored in a sealed environment to prevent evaporation. The fluid 4 may be released easily through either one of the opening means 2 by simply breaking open the end at the scoring to allow the fluid 4 to flow into the cotton ball 5. Without the two<br><br>
compartment design of the present invention, the fluid 4 within the sealed container will not be released from the sealed container due to the small diameter of the sealed container and the resulting capillary action and atmospheric pressure, which will prevent the exit of the fluids 4 from the sealed container.<br>
Although the description above contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of the presently preferred embodiments of this invention. Thus the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents, rather than by the examples given.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
A sealed container used as the body of a cotton swab and also for storing fluids, said container comprising of:<br>
a sealed elongated housing with one or more opening means such as herein described <br>
J<br><br>
a divider separating the sealed elongated housing into multiple compartments that<br>
allow free flow of fluids between.them;<br>
     is wherein the sealed container may be used to store fluids until the fluid is released<br><br>
through the opening means.A sealed container as claimed in claim 1 wherein the opening means is a scoring that can be broken open to release the fluid in the sealed container.<br><br>
4.	A sealed container as claimed in claim 1 wherein the opening means is covered<br>
with an absorbent material such as a ball of cotton or a sponge.<br>
5.	A   sealed   container   as   claimed   in   claim    1    wherein   the   divider   is<br>
optionally/preferably in the form of an elongated tube.<br>
6.	A sealed container as claimed in claim 5 wherein the elongated tube is open at<br>
both ends.<br><br>
7.	A sealed container as claimed in claim 5 wherein the elongated tube is smaller in<br>
diameter and shorter in length than the sealed elongated housing.<br>
8.	A sealed container as claimed in claim 5 wherein the elongated tube is inserted<br>
into the sealed elongated housing thereby separating the sealed elongated housing<br>
into two cylindrical compartments.<br>
9.	A sealed container as claimed in claim 1 wherein the sealed elongated housing is<br>
a sealed elongated tube.<br>
10.	A sealed container substantially as herein described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br></td>
