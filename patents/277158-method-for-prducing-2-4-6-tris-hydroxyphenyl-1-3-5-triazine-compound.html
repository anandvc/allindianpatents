 <br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing 2,4,6-tris (hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine compound. Particularly, the present invention relates to a method of producing 2,4,6-tris(hydroxyphenyl)-l,3,5-triazine compound in , which the compound is easily produced without rapid solidification or the like and generation of by-products is suppressed, thereby enabling to reduce decrease in the yield, and also in which the compound can be synthesized with a low amount of catalyst such that the amount of waste materials can be reduced.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, for the purpose of energy saving, weight reduction and the like, flat-panel displays using liquid crystals, plasma or the like have become popular. For these display-related materials, many functional films having optical properties are used. Since these materials are easily deteriorated by UV rays, in order to improve the resistance to light, there are increased demands for an UV-absorbing agent having excellent absorbing capacity in a variety of wavelength regions.<br>
As such UV-absorbing agent, triazine compounds such as 2-(2-hydroxyaryl)-4,6-diaryl-l,3,5-triazine, 2,4-bis(2-hydroxyaryI)-6-aryl-l,3,5-triazine, 2,4,6-tris(2-hydroxyaryl)-l,3,5-triazine and 2,4,6-tris(2,4-dihydroxyaryl)-l,3,5-triazine are known. Particularly, since 2,4,6-tris(2-hydroxyaryl)-l,3,5-triazine and 2,4,6-tris(2,4-dihydroxyaryl)-l,3,5-triazine function as UV-absorbing agent having excellent UV-absorbing capacity in a long-wavelength region, these triazine compounds are expected to be used in an application such as polarizing plate protecting film, where absorbing capacity in a long-wavelength region is required.<br>
In view of this, for the purpose of providing such triazine compound. Patent Documents 1 to 7 disclose methods of producing such triazine compound. For example. Patent Document 1 discloses a production method in which aluminium chloride is used as Lewis acid, and Patent Document 2 discloses a production method in which benzene is used as the solvent.<br>

In cases where the mass ratio of cycloalkyl alkyl ether is less than 1 wt%, the effects of the present invention are lost and a drastic exothermic reaction occurs making the reaction uncontrollable, and at the same time, stirring may become difficult due to generation of viscous matter. In contrast, when the mass ratio of cycloalkyl alkyl ether exceeds 50 wt%, there may be an increased generation of by-products, which may decrease the yield. Therefore, such mass ratios are not preferred.<br>
The reaction solvent which is used in the present invention and contains sulfolane as the main component is used, with respect to the theoretical yield, preferably at an amount of not less than 200 parts by mass, more preferably at an amount of 200 to 500 parts by mass, and particularly preferably, from the economical standpoint, at an amount of 200 parts by mass. An amount less than 200 parts by mass is not preferred since there may be a problem, for example, that the reaction time becomes extended due to insufficient dissolution of a Lewis acid such as aluminum trichloride or that the reaction solution becomes highly viscous and loses fluidity, thereby damaging the stirrer and/or making it impossible to be loaded into the treatment solution.<br>
 <br>
The total amount of the inert solvent and cycloalkyl alkyi ether solvent used in the present invention is, with respect to 100 parts by mass of the theoretical yield, preferably at an amount of 100 to 2,000 parts by mass, more preferably at an amount of 300 to 1,500 parts by mass, and particularly preferably at an amount of 500 to 1,000 parts by mass. An amount less than 100 parts by mass' is not preferred since there may be a problem, for example, that the raw materials cannot be sufficiently dissolved, causing a heterogeneous reaction and extended reaction time, or that, in order to dissolve the raw materials uniformly, the reaction temperature becomes high and by-products are generated in a large amount. On the other hand, an amount greater than 2,000 parts by mass is not preferred since, even at such an amount, the effect of further improving the desired performance is hardly attained while the cost becomes inflated.<br>
Further, in cases where a solvent containing sulfolane as the main component is used, it is preferred that the addition of the hydroxy phenyl compound represented by Formula (3) in the production method according to the present invention be carried out, since it tends to be difficult to control the reaction rate (and temperature) in the reaction performed by simultaneous addition thereof with the cyanuric halide compound represented by Formula (2), by dissolving the hydroxyphenyl compound into the same solvent as the reaction solvent in advance and subsequently dropping the thus obtained hydroxyphenyl compound solution into the reaction solution. The amount of the solvent used is not particularly restricted; however, it is, with respect to the theoretical yield, preferably at an amount of not less than 150 parts by mass, more preferably 150 to 300 parts by mass, and particularly preferably, from the economical standpoint, at an amount of 150 parts by mass. An amount less than 150 parts by mass is not preferred since there may be a problem, for example, that the dissolution of the hydroxyphenyl-based raw material becomes difficult or that the reaction solution becomes highly viscous to lose fluidity, thereby damaging the stirrer or making it impossible to be loaded into the treatment solution.<br>
 <br>
In cases where a solvent containing sulfolane as the main component is used, the reaction temperature is preferably 60 to 100°C more preferably 70 to 80°C. At a temperature lower than 600'C, since the initial reaction is slow and the product becomes solidified due to drastic exothermic reaction in the middle phase of the reaction, it tends to become difficult to produce the desired compound, and at a temperature higher than 100°C, the product may become colored or the selectivity may be lowered, thereby increasing the amount of by-products; therefore, such temperatures are not preferred.<br>
In cases where a mixed solvent of inert solvent and cycloalkyl alkyl ether represented by the aforementioned Formula (4) is used, the reaction temperature is preferably 20 to 120°C more preferably 40 to 80°C. At a temperature lower than 20°C, since the initial reaction is slow and the product becomes solidified due to the drastic exothermic reaction in the middle phase of the reaction, it tends to become difficult to produce the desired compound, and at a temperature higher than 120°C, the product may become colored or the selectivity may be lowered, thereby increasing the amount of by-products; therefore, such temperatures are not preferred.<br>
The pressure during the reaction is preferably normal pressure at which the reaction solvent is not evaporated or the reaction is preferably carried out under an increased pressure. Normal pressure is particularly preferred since the reaction can be carried out using a simple device.<br>
In the present invention, a Lewis acid catalyst is preferably used as the reaction catalyst. Examples of the Lewis acid include aluminum halide, boron halide, tin halide, zinc halide, lead halide, manganese halide, magnesium halide, copper halide, titanium halide, alkylaluminum halide, gallium halide, iron halide, arsenic halide, antimony halide, thallium halide, zirconium halide, tungsten halide, molybdenum halide, niobium halide and a mixture thereof. Specific examples include aluminum trichloride (AICl3), aluminum tribromide, trimethyl aluminum, boron trifluoride,<br>
 <br>
boron trichloride, zinc dichloride, titanium tetrachloride, tin dichloride, tin tetrachloride, ferric chloride and a mixture thereof. Thereamong, it is preferred to use aluminum trichloride from the standpoint of catalyst activity, cost and handling.<br>
In conventional Friedel-Crafts reaction, a Lewis acid is generally used at an amount of not less than 1 equivalent with respect to 1 equivalent of halogen atom of the cyanuric halide compound; however, in the present invention, when using a solvent containing sulfolane as the main component, the amount of the Lewis acid is 0.3 to 0.7 equivalent with respect to 1 equivalent of halogen atom of the cyanuric halide compound, thereby enabling to obtain the desired product at a high purity. Further, taking the moisture absorption of the Lewis acid which is the catalyst into consideration, it is preferred that the Lewis acid be used at an amount of 0.4 to 0.5 equivalent. An amount of less than 0.3 equivalent is not preferred since the reaction activity becomes too low, while it is not industrially preferred to use the Lewis acid at an amount exceeding 0.7 equivalent since it unnecessarily increases the waste materials.<br>
In cases where a mixed solvent of inert solvent and cycloalkyl alkyl ether represented by the aforementioned Formula (4) is used, the Lewis acid is used, with respect to the cyanuric halide compound represented by the aforementioned Formula (2), at an amount of 0.1 to 10 equivalents, preferably at an amount of 1 to 6 equivalents. An amount of less than 0.1 equivalent is not preferred since the reaction activity may become too low, while it is not also preferred to use the Lewis acid at an amount exceeding 10 equivalents since it unnecessarily increases the waste materials.<br>
In cases where a mixed solvent of inert solvent and cycloalkyl alkyl ether represented by the aforementioned Formula (4) is used, the procedure for producing 2,4,6-tris(hydroxyphenyl)-l,3,5-triazine compound is not particularly restricted in the present invention; however, examples thereof include: a) a method in which hydroxyphenyl compound / solvent is dropped into cyanuric halide compound /<br>
 <br>
solvent; b) a method in which cyanuric halide compound / solvent is dropped into hydroxyphenyl compound / solvent; and c) a method in which cyanuric halide compound and hydroxyphenyl compound are simultaneously added to the solvent and allowed to react. Preferred thereamong is the method of c) a method in which cyanuric halide and hydroxyphenyl compound are simultaneously added, since it tends to produce the desired product at a high yield.<br>

There is no particular restriction on the method of blending the triazine compound obtained in the present invention into the synthetic resin. The optimum blending method is appropriately selected, depending on the melt viscosity, the presence or absence of other compounding agent(s), the type thereof and the like, from methods in wihich the triazine compound and synthetic resin are liquefied using a solvent, such as a melt-kneading method by an extruder or the like and a casting method; and resin polymerization methods such as one in which the triazine compound is added at the time of or immediately after polymerization, such as emulsion polymerization, suspension polymerization solution polymerization or the like, one in which the triazine compound is mixed with other additive component(s) in advance and granulated, and one in which the triazine compound is melt-kneaded at a high concentration into the resin and master-batched before being blended into the resin.<br>

Light-yellow powder was obtained in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the amount of aluminum trichloride was changed to 13.6 g (0.102 mol). The yield was 43.7 g (98% yield) and the purity was 91.8%. The yield of the by-products was<br>
4.6%.<br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
Yellow powder was obtained in the same maimer as in Example 1 except that the solvent was changed from sulfolane to diglyme. The yield was 19.7 g (44% yield) and the purity was 29.1%. The yield of the by-products was 19.4%.<br>
(Comparative Example 2)<br>
The same procedure as in Example 1 was carried out except that the amount of aluminum trichloride was changed to 4 g (0,03 mol); however, the reaction hardly progressed.<br>
(Comparative Example 3)<br>
With the same amount of catalyst as in Comparative Example 1, the reaction temperature was increased to 120°C to carry out the reaction. Generation of HCl was observed in association with the reaction progress. The reaction solution was treated in the same manner as in Example 1; however, obtained was not powder, but red-brown viscous substance. The purity thereof was 22 % and the substance contained as its main component a by-product having a large molecular weight which is not normally observed.<br>
 <br>
(Example 3)<br>
Into a reaction vessel, 18.4 g (0.1 mol) of cyanuric chloride represented by the aforementioned Compound No7, 43.4 g (0.35 mol) of 2-methyIresorcinoI represented by the aforementioned No. 8, 20 g (0,15 mol) of aluminum trichloride, 340 g of chlorobenzene and 18 g of cyclopentyl methyl ether were added and allowed to react for 2 hours. Thereto added at 80°C was 80 g of 6N hydrochloric acid, and the thus obtained mixture was heated to 90°C to allow decomposition of aluminum chloride complex for 1 hour. Subsequently, 200 g of toluene was added and the resultant was reflux-dehydrated for 2 hours. The thus reflux-dehydrated mixture was cooled and then filtered using a Buchner funnel to obtain light-yellow powder. The yield was 42.5 g (95% yield) and the purity based on the area ratio obtained by HPLC (column; Jordi-Gel DVB 100A manufactured by Jordi Associates, Inc., developing solvent; tetrahydrofuran (THF)) was 99%, Further, the yield of the compound believed to be By-product 1 was 1%,<br>
The infrared absorption spectrum of the thus obtained compound was (KBr, cm.1): 3364, 2924, 1612, 1542, 1501, 1423, 1300, 1080, and the 1H-NMR was (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm): 12.65 (s, -OH), 9.49 (s, -OH), 6.82 (d, Ph), 5.76 (d, Ph), 1.24 (s, -CH3); therefore, the thus obtained compound was confirmed to be the aforementioned Compound No.l.<br>
(Example 4)<br>
Light-yellow powder was obtained in the same manner as in Example 3 except that the amounts of chlorobenzene and cyclopentyl methyl ether were changed to 322 g and 36 g, respectively. The yield was 43.4 g (97% yield) and the purity was 89%. The yield of By-product 1 was 11%.<br>
 <br>
(Example 5)<br>
Light-yellow powder was obtained in the same manner as in Example 3 except that the reaction temperature and the reaction time were changed to 40°C and 9 hours, respectively. The yield was 42.1 g (94% yield) and the purity was 95%. The yield of By-product 1 was 5%.<br>
(Comparative Example 4)<br>
When it was tried to raise the temperature to 80°C in order to carry out the reaction in the same manner as in Example 3 except that the solvent was changed to 358 g of chlorobenzene (without cycloalkyl alkyl ether), a drastic exothermic reaction occurred, increasing the temperature to 133°C. The thus obtained product was in the form of red oily viscous substance, The yield was 23.3 g (52% yield) and the purity was 53%. The yields of By-product 1 and By-product 2 were 23% and 24%, respectively.<br>
(Comparative Example 5)<br>
Orange powder was obtained in the same manner as in Example 3 except that diglyme was used in place of cyclopentyl methyl ether. The yield was 26.0 g (58% yield) and the purity was 82%. The yield of By-product 1 was 18%.<br>
(Comparative Example 6)<br>
Red oily viscous substance was obtained in the same manner as in Example 3 except that tetrahydrofuran was used in place of cyclopentyl methyl ether and the reaction temperature was changed to 40°C. The yield was 17.0 g (38% yield) and the purity was 41%. The yield of By-product 1 was 59%.<br>
 <br>
(Comparative Example 7)<br>
Red oily viscous substance was obtained in the same manner as in Example 3 except that the solvent was changed to 224 g of diglyme (without chlorobenzene / cycloalkyl alkyl ether). The yield was 20.6 g (46% yield) and the purity was 51%. The yields of By-product 1 and By-product 2 were 17% and 32%, respectively.<br>
From the results of Example 1 and Comparative Example 1, it is seen that the use of sulfolane solvent as in the case of the present invention enables to suppress the generation of by-products, which was difficult to control with conventionally used solvents, and that the present invention can provide a production method in which the yield and purity of the obtained product is superior. In addition, from Examples 1 and 2, as well as Comparative Example 2, it is apparent that the triazine compound can be produced at a high yield and high purity only with the amount of catalyst in the range of the present invention. Further, the present invention can produce the desired product at a high yield and high purity using a Lewis acid only at an amount of approximately half of what is generally required in a Friedel-Crafts reaction; therefore, it is an industrially valuable production method which generates only a small amount of waste materials. Furthermore, in Examples 1 and 2, the triazine compound was easily produced and purified without rapid solidification or the like.<br>
From Examples 3 to 5 and Comparative Examples 4 to 7, it is seen that a high yield was not attained when using an ether-based solvent other than the one used in the present invention and that the triazine compound was obtained at a high yield and high purity with the generation of by-products being suppressed only in those cases of Examples 3 to 5 in which cycloalkyl alkyl ether solvent was used. It is clear that, by the present invention, the triazine compound can be produced at a high purity and high yield. Further, in Examples 3 to 5, the triazine compound was easily produced and purified without rapid solidification or the like,<br>
