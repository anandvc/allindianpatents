2<br>
blood vessel (a bringing together of the walls of the blood vessel), a transection (a cutting) of the coaptated blood vessel, and a coagulation (a sealing) of the coaptated cut ends of the blood vessel.<br>
[0008] Still, scientists and engineers continue to seek improved ultrasonic surgical instruments and methods.<br>
[0009] Summary of the Invention<br>
[0010] A first embodiment of an ultrasonic surgical shears of the invention includes a bifurcated ultrasonic surgical blade, a clamping arm, and a substantially "T-shaped tissue pad. The blade has a first distal tip portion and a second distal tip portion transversely spaced apart from the first distal tip portion creating a space therebetween. The clamping arm is operable to open and close toward the blade to define a clamped position and an undamped position. The tissue pad is attached to the clamping arm and has first and second arms and a foot each having a clamping surface. In the clamped position, the clamping surface of the first arm faces substantially toward the first distal tip portion, the clamping surface of the second arm faces substantially toward the second distal tip portion, and the clamping surface of the foot faces substantially toward the space between the first and second distal tip portions.<br>
[0011] A first method of the invention is for sealing a blood vessel of a patient and includes steps a) through e). Step a) includes obtaining an ultrasonic surgical clamp including an ultrasonic member, a clamping arm operable to open and close toward the ultrasonic member, and a tissue pad attached to the clamping arm and having a clamping surface.

3<br>
member to seal but not transect the blood vessel. Step d) includes obtaining a surgical cutter distinct from the ultrasonic member. Step e) includes transecting the sealed blood vessel using the surgical cutter.<br>
[0012] A second method of the invention is for transecting patient tissue and sealing a blood vessel therein and includes steps a) through e). Step a) includes obtaining an ultrasonic surgical clamp including an ultrasonic member, a clamping arm operable to open and close toward the ultrasonic member, and a tissue pad attached to the clamping arm and having a clamping surface. Step b) includes positioning the patient tissue between the ultrasonic member and the clamping surface. Step c) includes operating the clamping arm to clamp the patient tissue between the ultrasonic member and the clamping surface and ultrasonically vibrating the ultrasonic member to seal the blood vessel but not transect the patient tissue including the blood vessel. Step d) includes obtaining a surgical cutter distinct from the ultrasonic member. Step e) includes transecting the patient tissue including the sealed blood vessel using the surgical cutter.<br>
[0013] An embodiment of an ultrasonic surgical instrument of the invention includes an ultrasonic surgical clamp and a surgical cutter. The clamp includes an ultrasonic member, a clamping arm operable to open and close toward the ultrasonic member, and a tissue pad attached to the clamping arm and having a clamping surface, wherein the ultrasonic surgical clamp is adapted to ultrasonically seal a blood vessel clamped between the clamping surface of the tissue pad and the ultrasonic member by ultrasonically vibrating the ultrasonic member. The surgical cutter is distinct from the ultrasonic member, connected to the ultrasonic surgical clamp, and adapted to transect a blood vessel which has been sealed by the ultrasonic surgical clamp.<br><br>

[0014] A second embodiment of an ultrasonic surgical shears of the invention includes an ultrasonic surgical blade, a clamping arm, and a tissue pad. The clamping arm is operable to open and close toward the blade to define a clamped position and an undamped position. The tissue pad is attached to the clamping arm and has first and second transverse outer portions and a transverse central portion positioned between the first and second transverse outer portions. The transverse central portion is movable, with respect to the first and second transverse outer portions, toward the blade.<br>
[0015] An embodiment of an ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissue pad of the invention includes an ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissue pad body. The tissue pad body has a top surface attachable to a clamping arm of an ultrasonic surgical shears, a bottom surface including a clamping surface, and a clamping direction. The tissue pad has first and second transverse outer portions each extending from the top to the bottom surface, and has a transverse central portion positioned between the first and second transverse outer portions and extending from the top to the bottom surface. The first and second transverse outer portions are more resiliency flexible along the clamping direction than is the transverse central portion.<br>
[0016] Several benefits and advantages are obtained from one or more of the embodiments and methods of the invention which provide, in certain examples, separating over space and/or time the ultrasonic sealing of a blood vessel from an ultrasonic or non-ultrasonic transection of the blood vessel. This allows for proper sealing of a larger vessel before it is transected. This should provide improved blood vessel sealing over conventional ultrasonic surgical shears which perform a substantially simultaneous transection and sealing of a blood vessel which can result in a larger blood vessel receiving inadequate sealing before it is transected.<br><br>

[0027] Before explaining the present invention in detail, it should be noted that the invention is not limited in its application or use to the details of construction and arrangement of parts illustrated in the accompanying drawings and description. The illustrative embodiments of the invention may be implemented or incorporated in other embodiments, variations and modifications, and may be practiced or carried out in various ways. Furthermore, unless otherwise indicated, the terms and expressions employed herein have been chosen for the purpose of describing the illustrative embodiments of the present invention for the convenience of the reader and are not for the purpose of limiting the invention.<br>
[0028] It is understood that any one or more of the following-described embodiments, methods, examples, etc. can be combined with any one or more of the other following-described embodiments, methods, examples, etc.<br>
[0029] Referring now to the Figures, in which like numerals indicate like elements, Figures 1-2 illustrate a first embodiment of an ultrasonic surgical shears 10 of the invention. The ultrasonic surgical shears 10 includes a bifurcated ultrasonic surgical blade 12, a clamping arm 14, and a substantially "T"-shaped tissue pad 16. The blade 12 has a first distal tip portion 18 and a second distal tip portion 20 transversely spaced apart from the first distal tip portion 18 creating a space 22 therebetween. The clamping arm 14 is operable to open and close toward the blade 12 to define a clamped position and an undamped position. The tissue pad 16 is attached to the clamping arm 14 and has first and second arms 24 and 26 and a foot 28 each having a clamping surface 30. In the clamped position, the clamping surface 30 of the first arm 24 faces substantially toward the first distal tip portion 18, the clamping surface 30 of the second arm 26 faces substantially toward the second distal tip portion 20, and the clamping surface 30 of the foot 28<br><br>
WO 2005/084262	PCT/US2005/006382<br>
7<br>
faces substantially toward the space 22 between the first and second distal tip portions 18 and 20.<br>
[0030] In one example of the embodiment of Figures 1-2, the first and second distal tip portions 18 and 20 of the blade 12 each have a substantially rectangular transverse cross section. In one variation, the clamping surface 30 of the foot 28 of the tissue pad 16 has a transverse length which is substantially equal to the transverse distance between the first and second distal tip portions 18 and 20 of the blade 12 creating, in a fully clamped position as viewed in a transverse cross section, a first pinch point 32 between the first arm 24 of the tissue pad 16 and the first distal tip portion 18 of the blade 12 and a second pinch point 34 between the second arm 26 of the tissue pad 16 and the second distal tip portion 20 of the blade 12. In one modification, in a transverse cross section, the foot 28 of the tissue pad 16 has a substantially rectangular shape. In another variation, the clamping surface 30 of the foot 28 has a transverse length which is less than the transverse distance between the first and second distal tip portions 18 and 20. In a further variation, the clamping surface 30 of the foot 28 has a transverse length which is equal to or greater than the transverse distance between the first and second distal tip portions 18 and 20. In another modification, not shown, in a transverse cross section, the foot of the tissue pad has a substantially trapezoidal shape which narrows toward the clamping surface of the foot. In one enablement of the ultrasonic surgical shears 10, not shown, the tissue pad sits across from the blade over the entire length of the blade.<br>

surgical clamp 38, and adapted to transect a blood vessel which has been sealed by the ultrasonic surgical clamp 38.<br>
[0035J In one illustration of the embodiment of Figure 4, the surgical cutter 54 is a non-energy-based surgical cutter such as, without limitation, a surgically-sharp blade. In a different illustration of the embodiment of Figure 4, the surgical cutter is an energy-based surgical cutter such as, without limitation, an ultrasonic surgical blade or an RF (radio-frequency) blade. In one arrangement of the embodiment of Figure 4, the tissue pad 44 and the ultrasonic member 40 each have a substantially rectangular transverse cross sectional shape. In one variation of the ultrasonic surgical instrument 58, not shown, the surgical cutter is not attached to the clamping arm.<br>
[0036] A second embodiment of an ultrasonic surgical shears 60 of the invention, shown in Figure 5, includes an ultrasonic surgical blade 62, a clamping arm 64, and a tissue pad 66. The clamping arm 64 is operable to open and close toward the blade 62 to define a clamped position and an undamped position. The tissue pad 66 is attached to the clamping arm 64 and has first and second transverse outer portions 68 and 70 and a transverse central portion 72 positioned between the first and second transverse outer portions 68 and 70. The transverse central portion 72 is movable, with respect to the first and second transverse outer portions 68 and 70, toward the blade 62. In one arrangement, corresponding portions of the clamping arm 64 move corresponding portions of the tissue pad 66, as is within the level of construction skill of the artisan.<br>
[0037] In one example of the embodiment of Figure 5, the ultrasonic surgical blade 62 is a bifurcated ultrasonic surgical blade having a first distal tip portion 74 and a second distal tip portion 76 transversely spaced apart from the first distal tip portion 74 creating a space 78<br><br>
WO 2005/084262	PCT/US2005/006382<br>
11<br>
therebetween, wherein the transverse central portion 72 is movable into the space 78 between the first and second distal tip portions 74 and 76. In another example, not shown, the ultrasonic surgical blade is not bifurcated.<br>
[0038] In one variation of the embodiment of Figure 5, each of the first and second transverse outer portions 68 and 70 is movable, with respect to the transverse central portion 72, away from the blade 62. In the same or a different variation, the blade 62 has a substantially rectangular transverse cross sectional shape. In one modification, the transverse central portion 72 and the first and second transverse outer portions 68 and 70 each have a substantially rectangular transverse cross sectional shape.<br>
[0039] An embodiment of an ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissue pad 80 of the invention, shown in Figure 6, includes an ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissue pad body 82. The tissue pad body 82 has a top surface 84 attachable to a clamping arm 86 of an ultrasonic surgical shears 88, a bottom surface 90 including a clamping surface 92, and a clamping direction 94. The tissue pad 80 has first and second transverse outer portions 96 and 98 each extending from the top to the bottom surface 84 and 90, and has a transverse central portion 100 positioned between the first and second transverse outer portions 96 and 98 and extending from the top to the bottom surface 84 and 90. The first and second transverse outer portions 96 and 98 are more resiliency flexible along the clamping direction 94 than is the transverse central portion 100.<br>
[0040] In one example of the embodiment of Figure 6, the tissue pad body 82 has a substantially rectangular transverse cross section and has a "T"-shaped segment 102 having first and second arms 104 and 106 and a central stem 108, wherein the transverse central portion 100 includes the entire central stem 108 and none of the first and second<br><br>
WO 2005/084262	PCT/US2005/006382<br>
12<br>
arms 104 and 106, and wherein the central stem 108 projects away from the first and second arms 104 and 106 along the clamping direction 94. In one variation, first and second rectangular segments 110 and 112 are attached to the "T-shaped segment 102 as shown in Figure 6.<br>
[0041] In an alternate embodiment of an ultrasonic-surgical-shears tissue pad 114 of the invention, shown in Figure 7, the tissue pad body 116 has an inverse "T-shaped segment 118 having first and second arms 120 and 122 and a central stem 124, wherein the transverse central portion 126 includes the entire central stem 124 and none of the first and second arms 120 and 122, and wherein the central stem 124 projects away from the first and second arms 120 and 122 along a direction opposite to the clamping direction 126. In this alternate embodiment, only the top surface 126 of the central stem 124 is attachable to a clamping arm 128 of an ultrasonic surgical shears 130. In one variation, the tissue pad body 116 has a substantially inverse "T-shaped transverse cross section. In a different variation, not shown, the tissue pad body has a substantially rectangular transverse cross section. In this variation, first and second rectangular segments would be attached to the "T"-shaped segment to achieve the substantially rectangular cross section of the tissue pad body.<br>
[0042] Several benefits and advantages are obtained from one or more of the embodiments and methods of the invention which provide, in certain examples, separating over space and/or time the ultrasonic sealing of a blood vessel from an ultrasonic or non-ultrasonic transection of the blood vessel. This allows for proper sealing of a larger vessel before it is transected.
