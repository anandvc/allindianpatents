claims, which hereby are incorporated by reference.<br>
Description.<br>
Definitions<br>
Before the invention is disclosed and described in detail,<br>
it is to be understood that this invention is not limited<br>
to particular configurations, process steps and materials<br>
disclosed herein as such configurations, process steps and<br>
materials may vary somewhat. It is also to be understood<br>
that the terminology employed herein is used for the<br>
purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is<br>
not intended to be limiting since the scope of the present<br>
invention is limited only by the appended claims and<br>
equivalents thereof.<br>
It must be noted that, as used in this specification and<br>
the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an" and<br>
"the" include plural referents unless the context clearly<br>
dictates otherwise.<br>
The following terms are used throughout the description<br>
and the claims.<br><br>
"Biocompatible" as used herein is the ability of a<br>
material to perform with an appropriate host response in a<br>
specific application.<br>
"Biofilm" as used herein is a thin layer in which<br>
microorganisms are embedded. Biofilms occur when<br>
microorganisms colonise a surface.<br>
"Complement activation" as used herein is a complex system<br>
of factors in blood plasma that may be activated by a<br>
chain reaction from component C1 to C9, which give rise to<br>
a number of biological effects. Complement activation<br>
occurs in two ways a) the classical C1 to C9, or b) the<br>
alternative by direct activation of C3.<br>
"Contact angle". For a given droplet on a solid surface<br>
the contact angle is a measurement of the angle formed<br>
between the surface of a solid and the line tangent to the<br>
droplet radius from the point of contact with the solid.<br>
"Electron donating material" as used herein is a material,<br>
which in connection with another more noble material has<br>
the ability to transfer electrons to the more noble<br>
material. An example is a less noble metal together with a<br>
more noble metal.<br>
"Electron donating surface" as used herein is a surface<br>
layer comprising an electron donating material.<br>
"Hydrophobicity" of a surface as used herein describes the<br>
interactions between the surface and water. Hydrophobic<br>
surfaces have little or no tendency to adsorb water and<br>
water tends to "bead" on their surfaces. The term<br>
hydrophobicity of a surface is also closely linked with<br><br>
its surface energy. Whereas surface energy describes<br>
interactions of the surface with all molecules, the<br>
hydrophobicity describes the interactions of the surface<br>
with water.<br>
"Hysteresis of contact angle" as used herein is the<br>
difference between the advancing and receding contact<br>
angle values. The advancing contact angle of a drop of<br>
water on a surface is the contact angle when the boundary<br>
between water and air is moving over and wetting the<br>
surface, while the receding angle is the contact angle<br>
when boundary between water and air is withdrawn over a<br>
pre-wetted surface.<br>
"Inflammatory response" occurs when tissues are injured by<br>
viruses, bacteria, trauma, chemicals, heat, cold or any<br>
other harmful stimulus. Chemicals including bradykinin,<br>
histamine, serotonin and others are released by<br>
specialised cells. These chemicals attract tissue<br>
macrophages and white blood cells to localise in an area<br>
to engulf and destroy foreign substances.<br>
"Modify" either means reducing or enhancing a property.<br>
"Noble" is used herein in a relative sense. It is used to<br>
relate materials including metals to each other depending<br>
on how they interact with each other. When two metals are<br>
submerged in an electrolyte, while electrically connected,<br>
the term "less noble" metal is used to denote the metal<br>
which experiences galvanic corrosion. The term "more<br>
noble" is used to denote the other metal. Electrons will<br>
be transferred from the "less noble" metal to the more<br>
noble metal.<br><br>
"Protein adsorption" as used herein is the phenomenon<br>
where proteins adhere to a surface due to overall<br>
attractive forces between the proteins and the surface.<br>
"Substrate" as used herein is the base, which is treated<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
"Tissue ingrowth" is the process where cells start to grow<br>
on a surface, forming new tissue.<br>
"Thrombogenicity" as used herein is the ability of a<br>
substrate to induce clotting of blood.<br>
Detailed description of the present invention<br>
According to the present invention a substrate is treated<br>
to give it desired properties. The substrate can be made<br>
of a wide range of materials. In one embodiment the<br>
substrate is made of a material, which has an electron-<br>
donating surface. In an alternative embodiment it is made<br>
of a material, which does not have an electron-donating<br>
surface. In the case of an electron-donating surface the<br>
metal particles can be applied directly on to the<br>
electron-donating surface. In the case where the surface<br>
it not electron donating, a layer of an electron donating<br>
material has to be applied to create an electron donating<br>
surface.<br>
The present invention comprises a substrate having an<br>
electron donating surface, characterized in that there are<br>
metal particles on said surface, said metal particles<br>
comprise palladium and at least one metal selected from<br>
the group consisting of gold, ruthenium, rhodium, osmium,<br>
iridium, and platinum and wherein the amount of said metal<br>
particles is from about 0.001 to about 8 µg/cm2. A<br><br>
preferred amount of said metal particles is from about<br>
0.01 to about 4 µg/cm2. A particularly preferred amount of<br>
said metal particles is from about 0.01 to about 1 µg/cm2.<br>
Either the substrate itself is electron donating or there<br>
is applied a layer of an electron donating material on the<br>
substrate. In the case where the electron donating<br>
material is applied on the substrate it is applied in an<br>
amount of from about 0.05 to about 12 µg/cm2.<br>
An electron donating material does not necessarily have an<br>
electron-donating surface. An example is aluminium, which<br>
in air gets an oxide layer, which is not an electron-<br>
donating surface.<br>
The electron donating material is any material with the<br>
ability to form an electron-donating surface, such as a<br>
conducting polymer or a metal. In the case of a metal it<br>
must be less noble than any of the metals in the group<br>
consisting of palladium, gold, ruthenium, rhodium, osmium,<br>
iridium, and platinum.<br>
A preferred metal for use as an electron-donating surface<br>
is a metal selected from the group consisting of silver,<br>
copper and zinc.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the substrate<br>
is a polymeric substrate.<br>
In one embodiment the substrate is selected from the group<br>
consisting of latex, vinyl, polymers comprising vinyl<br>
groups, polyurethane urea, silicone, polyvinylchloride,<br>
polypropylene, styrene, polyurethane, polyester,<br>
copolymerisates of ethylene vinyl acetate, polystyrene,<br><br>
polycarbonate, polyethylene, polyacrylate,<br>
polymethacrylate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene,<br>
polyamide, and polyimide, or mixtures thereof.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the<br>
substrate is selected from the group consisting of a<br>
natural polymer, a degradable polymer, an edible polymer,<br>
a biodegradable polymer, an environmental friendly<br>
polymer, and a medical grade polymer.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the<br>
substrate is a metal.<br>
A preferred metal for the substrate is selected from the<br>
group consisting of stainless steel, medical grade steel,<br>
titanium, medical grade titanium, cobalt, chromium and<br>
aluminium or mixtures thereof.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the<br>
substrate is selected from the group consisting of glass,<br>
minerals, zeolites, stone and ceramics.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the<br>
substrate is selected from the group consisting of paper,<br>
wood, woven fibres, fibres, cellulose fibres, leather,<br>
carbon, carbon fibres, graphite, polytetrafluoroethylene,<br>
and polyparaphenyleneterephthalamide.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the<br>
substrate has the shape of a particle.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention there is<br>
provided an object comprising a substrate according to the<br>
present invention. Examples of an object comprising a<br><br>
substrate according to the present invention are medical<br>
devices, medical instruments, disposable articles, medical<br>
disposable articles.<br>
The particles must always comprise palladium. In addition<br>
to palladium there is at least one other metal. A ratio of<br>
palladium to other metals in the metal particles of from<br>
about 0.01:99.99 to about 99.99:0.01 can be used in the<br>
present invention. A ratio from about 0.5:99.5 to about<br>
99.8:0.2 is preferred. Particularly preferred ratios are<br>
from about 2:98 to about 95:5. Very particularly preferred<br>
ratios are 5:95 to 95:5. In another embodiment the ratios<br>
are from about 10:90 to about 90:10.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention said metal<br>
particles, in addition to palladium, comprise gold.<br>
The present inventors have discovered that advantageous<br>
properties are achieved when said metal particles have an<br>
average size of from about 10 to about 10000A.<br>
In one embodiment the average sizes for said metal<br>
particles are from about 100 to about 600A.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention there is<br>
provided an object comprising any of the substrates<br>
described herein.<br>
There is also provided a medical device comprising any of<br>
the substrates described herein.<br>
A disposable article comprising any of the substrates<br>
described herein is also provided.<br><br>
The present invention also provides a dental article, as<br>
well as dental equipment, dental implants, and dental<br>
devices, comprising any of the substrates described<br>
herein.<br>
The applied amount of the metal particles is expressed in <br>
µg/cm2 and it must be realised that the metal particles do<br>
not form a covering layer, but instead are uniformly<br>
distributed particles or clusters on said electron<br>
donating surface.<br>
An applied layer of an electron donating material is<br>
preferably applied so that it is uniform, essentially<br>
without agglomerates or clusters on the surface. If the<br>
electron donating surface layer is homogenous and uniform<br>
the applied amount in µg/cm2 may be converted to a<br>
thickness in A. An applied amount of 0.05-4ug/cm2<br>
corresponds to about 4.8-380A, 0.5-8ug/cm2 corresponds to<br>
about 48-760A, and 0.8-12ug/cm2 corresponds to about 76-<br>
1140A.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the electron-<br>
donating surface is a layer of commercially available<br>
essentially pure silver, which does not exclude the<br>
possibility of small amounts of impurities.<br>
If the substrate does not have an electron donating<br>
surface and thus a deposition of an electron donating<br>
surface layer is necessary, the deposition is performed<br>
using a method selected from the group consisting of<br>
chemical vapour deposition, sputtering, and deposition of<br>
metal from a solution comprising a metal salt. A uniform<br>
layer essentially without clusters or agglomerates is the<br>
result of the deposition. Preferably the deposition is<br><br>
carried out so that the first layer has good adhesion to<br>
the substrate.<br>
Now there is described one embodiment of the present<br>
invention for preparation of the coated substrate. For<br>
substrates which do not have an electron donating surface<br>
the method include some or all the steps:<br>
1. pre-treatment<br>
2 . rinsing<br>
3.	activation<br>
4.	deposition of an electron donating surface<br>
5.	rinsing<br>
6.	deposition of metal particles<br>
7.	rinsing<br>
8.	drying<br>
For objects with an electron-donating surface the method<br>
comprises the steps<br>
1.	rinsing<br>
2.	deposition of metal particles<br>
3.	rinsing<br>
4.	drying<br>
In the following, one embodiment of steps 1 to 9 for<br>
substrates which do not have an electron-donating surface<br>
is described more in detail.<br>
The pre-treatment can be made in an aqueous solution of a<br>
stannous salt containing 0.0005 to 30 g/1 of stannous<br>
ions. The pH is 1 to 4 and adjusted by hydrochloric and/or<br>
sulphuric acid. The treatment time is 2-60 minutes at room<br>
temperature. After the pre-treatment the surface is rinsed<br>
in demineralised water, but not dried.<br><br>
The activated and rinsed substrate is transferred to the<br>
deposition solution. The deposition solution has a pH of<br>
not less than 8. It includes a metal salt selected from<br>
the group consisting of a silver salt, a zinc salt, and a<br>
copper salt. In one embodiment of the present invention<br>
the salt is silver nitrate (AgNO3) . The metal salt is used<br>
in an effective amount of no more than about 0.10 grams<br>
per litre, preferably about 0.015 grams per litre. If the<br>
metal content is above,about 0.10 grams per litre, the<br>
elemental metal may form nonuniformly, in the solution or<br>
on the container walls. If the metal content is below an<br>
effective amount, there is insufficient metal, to form a<br>
film in the desired time.<br>
A second component of the deposition solution is a<br>
reduction agent that reduces the metal-containing salt to<br>
elemental metal. The reduction agent must be present in an<br>
amount sufficient to accomplish the chemical reduction.<br>
Acceptable reduction agents include formaldehyde,<br>
hydrazine sulphate, hydrazine hydroxide, and hypo<br>
phosphoric acid. In one embodiment of the present<br>
invention it is present in an amount of about 0.001<br>
millilitres per litre of solution. Too large a<br>
concentration of the reduction agent causes deposition of<br>
metal throughout the solution and on the container walls,<br>
while too small a concentration may result in an<br>
insufficient formation of metal on the substrate. A person<br>
skilled in the art can in the light of this description by<br>
routine experimentation determine the desired amount of<br>
reduction agent.<br>
Another component of the deposition solution is a<br>
deposition control agent that is present in an amount<br>
sufficient to slow the deposition reaction to prevent the<br><br>
reduced metal from precipitating directly from solution as<br>
a fine metallic powder, or precipitating onto the walls of<br>
the container. Operable deposition control agents include<br>
inverted sugar, also known as invertose, succinic acid,<br>
sodium citrate, sodium acetate, sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, sodium tartrate, potassium tartrate,<br>
and ammonia. The deposition control agent is preferably<br>
present in an amount of about 0.05 grams per litre of<br>
solution. If too little is present, there may occur<br>
precipitation of metal clusters instead of a uniform<br>
metallic surface. If too much is present, the metal-<br>
containing salt may become too stable for the desired<br>
precipitation onto the substrate of interest.<br>
The concentrations of the reduction agent and the<br>
deposition control agent are adjusted as necessary to<br>
achieve the desired results, depending upon the substrate<br>
material, the thickness of the film desired, the<br>
conditions of deposition, and the concentration of metal<br>
in the solution. For example, for thin films the metal<br>
salt concentration will be relatively low, as will the<br>
concentrations of the reduction agent and the deposition<br>
control agent. A person skilled in the art can in the<br>
light of this description by routine experimentation<br>
determine the desired amount of deposition control agent.<br>
In preparing the deposition solution, each of the<br>
components of the solution are preferably individually<br>
dissolved in demineralised water. The various pre-<br>
solutions are then mixed, and diluted where necessary, in<br>
the correct amounts to achieve the concentrations<br>
mentioned above.<br>
The combination of a metal salt and reduction agent<br><br>
permits the metal to be reduced from the salt in a<br>
suitable state to be deposited upon the surface of the<br>
substrate. This method is particularly beneficial to<br>
achieve good adhesion of the completed metal film to the<br>
substrate surface. Good adhesion is important in nearly<br>
all uses.<br>
The substrate surface is exposed to the deposition<br>
solution by any appropriate procedure. Dipping into the<br>
solution is normally preferred, but the solution may be<br>
applied by any convenient technique such as spraying or<br>
brushing. The metal film deposits uniformly from the<br>
solution at a rate that may be controlled by the<br>
concentration of the metal salt. If a thin film is<br>
required, the temperature of deposition is maintained<br>
sufficiently low so that deposition is controllably slow.<br>
Other methods of applying a metal layer that acts as an<br>
electron-donating surface can also be applied in the<br>
present invention. Other ways of achieving an electron-<br>
donating surface are chemical vapour deposition and<br>
sputtering.<br>
After the above-described metal deposition the substrate<br>
has an electron-donating surface consisting of a metal.<br>
This metal deposition is only necessary if the substrate<br>
does not have an electron-donating surface from the start.<br>
If the substrate already possesses an electron-donating<br>
surface, metal particles can be deposited on the surface<br>
without the extra addition of a metal layer. In the latter<br>
case the substrate is cleaned thoroughly before<br>
application of the particles.<br><br>
The next step in the manufacturing method is deposition of<br>
metal particles.<br>
In one embodiment colloidal suspensions of metals are used<br>
to obtain particles comprising palladium and at least<br>
another metal on the surface. The metal particles are<br>
deposited from a suspension of the desired particles. The<br>
composition of the metal particles in the suspension is<br>
adjusted according to the preferred value. The substrate<br>
with the electron-donating surface is dipped in the<br>
suspension of metal particles for a period of time from<br>
about a few seconds to about a few minutes or longer.<br>
The suspension of metal particles can be manufactured in<br>
several ways. In one embodiment the suspension of metal<br>
particles is made from an aqueous solution of a metal salt<br>
which is reduced under conditions such that metal<br>
particles of a desired size are formed. Mixing a suitable<br>
amount of metal salt, reducing agent and stabilising agent<br>
achieves this. The same reducing agents and stabilising<br>
agents as described above can be used when making the<br>
particle suspension. A person skilled in the art can in<br>
the light of this description by routine experimentation<br>
determine the desired amount of reducing agent and<br>
stabilising agent to get the desired particle size. In an<br>
alternative embodiment a commercially available colloidal<br>
suspension of metal particles is used. Metal particles of<br>
the desired composition are used to make the suspension.<br>
In one embodiment the suspension of metal particles is<br>
made by diluting with demineralised water a commercially<br>
available concentrated colloidal solution of metal<br>
particles comprising palladium and at least one metal<br>
selected from the group consisting of gold, ruthenium,<br><br>
rhodium, osmium, iridium, and platinum. The substrate is<br>
treated with the suspension for a period of time from<br>
about a few seconds to about a few minutes or longer.<br>
After the treatment the substrate is rinsed in a solvent<br>
or water such as demineralised water and left to dry in<br>
room temperature.<br>
In one particular non-limiting embodiment the commercially<br>
available metal particles consist of 75% palladium and 25%<br>
gold.<br>
Thus according to the present invention, a substrate with<br>
a particular desired surface can be obtained. For example,<br>
one can prepare a substrate having a silver electron<br>
donating surface with particles consisting of 75%<br>
palladium and 25% gold, or a copper electron donating<br>
surface with particles consisting of 85% palladium and 15%<br>
ruthenium.<br>
One of the advantages offered by the flexible yet<br>
controlled and repeatable method for producing such<br>
substrates is that a wide variety of substrates can be<br>
produced. As described further herein, certain substrates<br>
have improved properties over existing substrates. For<br>
example a particular substrate according to the present<br>
invention can produce surprising and advantageous<br>
modifications of the hydrophobicity of a substrate to<br>
which is it applied. Other properties that can be modified<br>
in this way by substrates according to claim 1 include<br>
protein adsorption, tissue ingrowth, complement<br>
activation, inflammatory response, thrombogenicity,<br>
friction coefficient, and surface hardness.<br><br>
That is, it is possible to adjust the particle size, the<br>
composition of the particles and the amount of particles<br>
to modify the surface properties of objects to which the<br>
substrate is applied.<br>
The present inventors have discovered that it is possible<br>
to achieve this by using a substrate according to claim 1.<br>
In particular it is possible to adjust the particle size,<br>
the composition of particles, and the amount of particles<br>
to modify the surface properties.<br>
Substrates according to the present invention can be used<br>
for many purposes. They are suitable for use in any<br>
application where it is desired to modify hydrophobicity,<br>
protein adsorption, tissue ingrowth, complement<br>
activation, inflammatory response, thrombogenicity,<br>
friction coefficient, and surface hardness of a substrate.<br>
Properties of the substrate can be both reduced or<br>
increased. Thus objects are provided which display at<br>
least one area which enhances a feature, and at least one<br>
area which reduces a feature. An example is an object with<br>
an area that reduces protein adsorption and an area that<br>
enhances protein adsorption. Another example is an object<br>
with an area that reduces tissue ingrowth and an area that<br>
enhances tissue ingrowth.<br>
A substrate according to the present invention also<br>
comprises a substrate having an electron donating surface,<br>
with metal particles on said surface, said metal particles<br>
comprise palladium wherein the amount of said metal<br>
particles is from about 0.001 to about 8 µg/cm2.<br><br>
The present invention provides use of a substrate<br>
according to the present invention for modifying the<br>
protein adsorption to an object comprising said substrate.<br>
The present invention provides use of a substrate<br>
according to the present invention for modifying the<br>
tissue ingrowth on an object comprising said substrate.<br>

complement activation caused by an object comprising said<br>
substrate.<br>

inflammatory response caused by an object comprising said<br>
substrate.<br>
The present invention provides use of a substrate<br>
according to the present invention for modifying the blood<br>
clotting caused by an object comprising said substrate.<br>
Another advantage of the substrate according to the<br>
appended claims is that it provides a possibility to<br>
modify the friction coefficient. Thus there is provided<br>
the use of a substrate according to the present invention<br>
for the modification of the friction coefficient of an<br>
object comprising said substrate.<br>
Other features of the invention and their associated<br>
advantages will be evident to a person skilled in the art<br>
upon reading the description and the examples.<br><br>
It is to be understood that this invention is not limited<br>
to the particular embodiments shown here. The following<br>
examples are provided for illustrative purposes and are<br>
not intended to limit the scope of the invention since the<br>
scope of the present invention is limited only by the<br>
appended claims and equivalents thereof.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Hydrophobicity of the surface as a function of the amount<br>
of metal particles<br>
A uniform layer of silver was deposited on a glass<br>
substrate according to the following method. The substrate<br>
was immersed in a cleaning solution of chromic acid for 5<br>
minutes at 58°C, followed by rinsing in demineralised<br>
water. The surface of the substrate was activated by<br>
immersion in a solution of aqueous stannous chloride and<br>
then rinsed in demineralised water. The surface of the<br>
substrate was then plated with a uniform layer of silver<br>
by immersion in 3 deposition solutions comprising silver<br>
ions. This yielded a silver surface with an applied amount<br>
of 1.2ug/cm2 corresponding to a thickness of about 115A.<br>
Particles consisting of 23% palladium and 77% gold were<br>
subsequently deposited on the first silver surface by<br>
immersion in a dilute suspension comprising metal<br>
particles of gold/palladium. The suspension of metal<br>
particles was made by reducing a gold salt and a palladium<br>
salt with a reducing agent and stabilising the suspension<br>
with a stabilising agent. The substrate was subsequently<br>
rinsed in demineralised water and dried.<br><br>
Substrates with different amounts of deposited particles<br>
were made using the method outlined above. Amounts of<br>
particles were 0, 0.02, 0.11, 0.15, and 0.19 µg/cm2<br>
respectively. For the sample with 0 µg/cm2 no particles<br>
were deposited on the surface and hence it consists of a<br>
silver surface.<br>
The static contact angle of a drop of water in equilibrium<br>
on the different substrates was measured. The advancing<br>
and receding contact angles were measured using the<br>
Wilhelmy technique.<br>
The difference between the advancing and receding contact<br>
angle values is called the contact angle hysteresis and<br>
was calculated for the measurements. The result of the<br>
experiment is depicted in Table 1.<br><br>
The surface hydrophobicity of the substrate is thus<br>
modified while the surface displays several other useful<br>
properties, such as biocompatibility, inherent of the<br>
substrates according to this example.<br>
Example 2<br><br>
Protein adsorption as a function of the amount of metal<br>
particles<br>
A uniform layer of silver was deposited on a silicon<br>
dioxide substrate. The substrate was immersed in a<br>
cleaning solution of 20% sulphuric acid for 10 minutes at<br>
room temperature, followed by rinsing in demineralised<br>
water. The surface of the substrate was activated by<br>
immersion in an aqueous solution of stannous chloride and<br>
the rinsed in demineralised water. The surface of the<br>
substrate was then plated with a uniform layer of silver<br>
by immersion in 4 baths of deposition solutions comprising<br>
silver ions. This yielded a silver surface with an applied<br>
amount of 0.8 µg/cm2 corresponding to a thickness of about<br>
77 A. Particles consisting of 95% palladium and 5% gold<br>
were subsequently deposited on the first silver surface by<br>
immersion in a dilute suspension of Pd/Au-particles. The<br>
applied amount of metal particles was 0.05, 0.12, 0.4 8 and<br>
0.59 µg/cm2 respectively. The substrate was rinsed in<br>
demineralised water and dried.<br>
Adsorption of fibrinogen was studied by the QCM-D<br>
technique. Fibrinogen is a glycoprotein synthesised in the<br>
liver and is found in blood plasma. QCM-D is a quartz<br>
crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring.<br>
The adsorbed amount of fibrinogen as a function of applied<br>
metal particles is shown in table 2.<br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
A net of polyester fabric was first rinsed in a 5%<br>
potassium hydroxide solution for 5 min at 30°C. After<br>
repeated rinsing in demineralised water the substrate was<br>
immersed in an acidified solution of 1 g/l stannous<br>
chloride at room temperature for 10 min. After rinsing in<br>
demineralised water it was soaked in a plating bath<br>
containing 2 g/l copper sulphate, 5 g/l sodium hydroxide,<br>
50 g/l sodium citrate and 0.005 ml/1 formaldehyde for 10<br>
min at 35°C. A copper layer of about 200 A was obtained<br>
and after new rinsing in demineralised water the substrate<br>
was immersed in a particle suspension comprising 0.05 g/l <br>
each of palladium particles and gold particles. The<br>
applied amount of metal particles was 0.4 µg/cm2.<br>
Example 4<br>
A substrate of PMMA was cleaned in 5% hydrochloric acid<br>
for 2 min and then rinsed in demineralised water before<br>
dipping in a solution containing 0.02 g/l of the stannous<br>
ion at a pH of 2.5. After rinsing the substrate was<br>
immersed in a solution containing 0.005 g/l of silver<br>
ions, 0.02 ml/1 ammonia, 0.05 g/l potassium hydroxide and<br>
0.0005 ml/1 formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature.<br>
This gave a surface with 0.12 µg/cm2 of silver. After<br>
rinsing it was immersed in a particle suspension<br><br>
comprising 0.005 g/l palladium and 0.002 g/l gold<br>
particles. The applied amount of metal particles was 0.05 <br>
µg/cm2.<br>
Example 5<br>
A non-woven polyimide substrate was immersed in a 12%<br>
solution of NaOH at 40°C for 10 min. After repeated<br>
rinsing in demineralised water it was immersed in an<br>
alcoholic solution containing 0.5 g/l stannous chloride<br>
for 5 min at room temperature. After rinsing it was soaked<br>
in a copper bath according to example 3. A copper layer of<br>
2 µg/cm2 was obtained. After rinsing it was immersed in a<br>
suspension comprising 1% of Pd and 0.2% of gold particles,<br>
calculated on the weight of the total suspension. The<br>
applied amount of metal particles was 0.6 µg/cm2.<br>
Example 6<br>

and after rinsing in demineralised water immersed in a<br>
solution of 0.6 g/l stannous chloride at pH 2.2 for 15 min<br>
at room temperature. After this the surface comprised a<br>
silver amount of 0.8 µg/cm2. After a new rinsing it was<br>
dipped in a silver bath according to example 2 and then<br>
after new rinsing dipped in a suspension comprising 1% Pd<br>
and 0.05% Au particles. The applied amount of metal<br>
particles was 0.12 µg/cm2.<br>
Example 7<br>
A substrate of aluminium was treated in a solution of 10%<br>
nitric acid and 3% hydrofluoric acid at 60°C for 20 min.<br>
After rinsing, the substrate was dipped in an acidified<br>
solution of 3 g/l stannous chloride and after renewed<br>
rinsing in a silver bath according to example 2. After<br>
this step an amount of around 80 A silver was obtained on<br><br>
the surface. After another rinsing the substrate	was<br>
immersed in a suspension comprising 1% Pd and 2%	Au<br>
particles. The applied amount of metal particles	was 0.7 <br>
µg/cm2.<br>
Example 8<br>
A substrate of PTFE was etched in an aqueous solution of<br>
sodium hydroxide for 5 min. After rinsing and drying it<br>
was immersed in a solution containing 0.7 g/l stannous<br>
chloride for 20 min at room temperature. The substrate was<br>
after rinsing dipped in a plating bath containing 0.2 g/l <br>
silver nitrate, 0.5 ml/1 ammonia and sodium hydroxide to<br>
pH 10.5 for 5 min. After this step an amount of around 2.2 <br>
µg/cm silver was obtained on the surface. After a new<br>
rinse it was immersed in a suspension comprising 3% Pd and<br>
0.1% Au particles for 5 min at room temperature. The<br>
applied amount of metal particles was 0.03 µg/cm2.<br>
Example 9<br>
A glass plate was rinsed in 10% sulphuric acid and 1%<br>
hydrofluoric acid at room temperature for 15 min. After<br>
rinsing it was immersed in a 1% stannous fluoride solution<br>
and after a new rinse immersed in a silver bath according<br>
to example 2. After this step an amount of around 140 A<br>
silver was obtained on the surface. After renewed rinsing<br>
it was dipped in a suspension comprising 1% ruthenium and<br>
2% palladium particles. The applied amount of metal<br>
particles was 0.25 µg/cm2.<br>
Example 10<br>

Example 12<br>
Detection of surface induced complement activation with<br>
Quartz Crystal Microbalance with dissipation monitoring<br>
(QCM-D)<br>
The quantification of a foreign body response is<br>
indirectly achieved by monitoring the binding of rabbit-<br>
anti human antibodies directed to the surface bound<br>
complement factor C3b.<br>
Within seconds from introduction to a soft tissue a<br>
foreign body is subject to great attention from the<br>
complement system. The complement system comprises about<br>
30 different proteins where C3 is the most abundant. After<br>
high concentration body fluid proteins (i.e. Albumin,<br>
Fibrinogen and Fibronectin) the complement system is one<br>
of the first actors on the scene and aims to protect the<br>
host from invading bacteria and fungi, but also to alert<br>
the immune system about a foreign body entering the<br>
system.<br>
Without being bound by any specific scientific theory the<br>
inventors assume that when complement factor 3 (C3) binds<br>
to an introduced surface it is cleaved by C3 convertase to<br><br>
form soluble C3a, and surface bound C3b. The surface bound<br>
C3b will then act as a convertase itself, triggering<br>
subsequent cleavage of C3 in a cascade-like fashion.<br>
Receptors to C3b is found on erythrocytes, macrophages,<br>
monocytes, polymorphonulear leukocytes and B cells, all of<br>
which are important in controlling inflammation and wound<br>
healing in tissue. The exact mechanisms controlling the<br>
binding of C3 to the surface are still much unknown.<br>
However, antibodies directed specifically towards C3b can<br>
easily be measured in vitro with QCM-D and give<br>
quantitative information of a biomaterial's immune<br>
response properties. This new methodology show good<br>
agreement with all other known methods for the detection<br>
of surface bound C3b.<br>
Material and methods<br>
Preparation of surfaces<br>
As model surfaces standard QCM-D crystals sputtered with<br>
Au (s), Ti (s) (QSX301 and QSX310 respectively) was used.<br>
A coating according to the present invention was applied<br>
on standard SiO2 QCM-D crystals (QSX 303, Q-Sense Sweden)<br>
using the method outlined in example 2.<br>
Blood products<br>
We received fresh whole blood from five healthy donors<br>
(Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden). The<br>
blood was left to clot in room temperature for<br>
approximately 4 hours to obtain complement active serum.<br>
The serum was then centrifuged at 4 00 0 rpm for 20 min<br>
(Hettich Universal 16 R) after which the supernatant was<br>
removed and re-centrifuged as above and stored at -70 °C.<br><br>
For detection of surface induced complement activation the<br>
serum was diluted 1:5 in Veronal Buffer Saline<br>
supplemented with CaCl2 (0.15 mM) and MgCl2 (0.5 mM)<br>
(VBS++) , and the adsorption of serum proteins to the<br>
modified QCM-D-crystals were monitored for 20 minutes<br>
followed by a rinse with buffer for 5 minutes. The rinse<br>
was followed by the addition of rabbit-anti-human C3b<br>
antibodies diluted 1:20 in VBS++ (Sigma). For negative and<br>
positive controls, standard gold QCM-D crystals pre-coated<br>
with human IgG (lmg/ml) (Sigma) were used. The negative<br>
control was heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min prior to<br>
measurements.<br>
All experiments were carried out at room temperature in<br>
Veronal Buffer Saline with CaCl2 (0.15 mM) and MgCl2 (0.5<br>
mM) (VBS++) except for negative controls were VBS- - were<br>
used. All QCM-D measurements were preformed on the<br>
apparatus D300 (Q-sense, Sweden).<br>
Results<br>
The SiO2 surfaces coated as described above had an amount<br>
of silver of 0.35-0.61 µg/cm2. The amount of gold in the<br>
particles was varied according to the table below and the<br>
complement activation was measured according to the table.<br><br><br>
Example 13<br>
Platelet adhesion and soluble complement factor C3a<br>
production on biomaterial surfaces<br>
The consumption of platelets in fresh whole blood exposed<br>
to a biomaterial is used to quantify the thrombogenicity<br>
of a desired biomaterial. Moreover, the soluble fraction<br>
of activated complement factor 3 (C3a) is used to monitor<br>
the complement activation from the biomaterial surface.<br>
Background<br>
Platelets (or thrombocytes) are small disc-shaped anuclear<br>
cell fragments normally present in healthy blood. They<br>
play a crucial role in preserving the walls in blood<br>
vessels and are recruited to a damaged area and activated<br>
to form a plug, preventing hemorrhage and blood loss.<br>
Platelets are also known to adhere and become activated on<br>
certain biomaterial surfaces, sometimes forming an<br>
undesired and potentially hazardous clot.<br>
Soluble C3a is a small protein cleaved off from the<br>
complement factor 3 (C3) when this is bound and activated<br>
on a bacteria or a foreign body surface. C3a acts as a<br>
chemo-attractant for polymorphonuclear (PMN) monocytes and<br>
also have anaphylatoxic properties signalling for the<br>
release of histamine from mast cells.<br>
Material and methods<br>
Experimental chambers<br>
The experimental chamber is briefly constructed of two<br>
PMMA rings glued onto a PMMA microscopic slide,<br>
constructing two wells. After addition of whole blood, the<br>
material to be tested is placed as a lid over the two<br>
wells and held in position with a clip. The chamber is<br><br>
then mounted on a disc rotating in 37°C water for 60<br>
minutes at 22 rpm.<br>
Blood<br>
Blood was drawn from one healthy donor and collected in a<br>
2x heparinized vial containing soluble heparin (Leo<br>
Pharma), to give a final concentration of 1.0 IU<br>
heparin/ml. The collected blood was then immediately<br>
transferred to the experimental chambers.<br>
Platelet counting<br>
After incubation in the experimental chamber the blood was<br>
added EDTA (Fluka) to a final concentration of 4mM.<br>
Platelets were then counted on a Coulter AcT diff™<br>
(Coulter Corporation) automated cell counter.<br>
C3a analysis<br>
After platelet counting, the blood was centrifuged at 4600<br>
g for 10 min at +4°C and the supernatant (plasma) was<br>
saved and stored in -70°C prior to measurements.<br>
Plasma was diluted 1/300 and analysed in a sandwich ELISA<br>
which employs the monoclonal 4SD17.3 (Uppsala university,<br>
Sweden) as capture antibody. Bound C3a was detected with<br>
biotinylated rabbit anti-human C3a (Dako), followed by<br>
HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences).<br>
Zymosan-activated serum, calibrated against a solution of<br>
purified C3a, served as a standard.<br>
Results<br>
The coated objects manufactured following the method<br>
outlined in example 2 on glass had a silver surface<br>
concentration of about 1.3 µg/cm2.<br><br><br>

Material<br>
NHSp-2 (Normal human serum pool from Immunologisk<br>
institutt, Rikshospitalet, Oslo , Norway), serum from<br>
helthy blood donors.<br>
30 cm tubes made of PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) were<br>
coated according to the procedure outlined in example 2.<br>
30cm PVC tubes were used as control.<br><br>
Setup: 7 types of tubes, untreated and PVC in triplicate<br>
(in total 21).<br>
Method:<br>
1)	The serum was placed on ice.<br>
2)	A zero sample was removed. 750 ul was added directly<br>
to a tube with 15ul EDTA 0.5M. The sample was kept on<br>
ice.<br>
3)	750 ul serum was added to each tube.<br>
4)	The tubes were attached to a rotor (5 rpm) 37°C and<br>
were incubated for 30 minutes.<br>
5)	The serum was removed with a pipette and added to a<br>
tube with 15ul EDTA 0.5M. The samples were placed on<br>
ice and analysed with respect to TCC (the soluble<br>
terminal C5b-9 complement complex).<br>
TCC was analyzed using a double antibody enzyme<br>
immunoassay based on the monoclonal aEll antibody, highly<br>
specific for a neoepitope exposed on activated but not<br>
native C9, as catching antibody. The method was originally<br>
described in:<br>

Primary normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF, Karocell<br>
Tissue Engineering AB, Stockholm, Sweden), passage 7, were<br>
used. The cells were cultured in tissue culture flasks in<br>
complete fibroblast medium containing DMEM+GlutaMAX™-1<br>
(Gibco, UK), 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, UK) and<br>
1% Antibiotic-Antimyocotic (Gibco, UK) at 37°C, 5% CO2 and<br>
95% humidity. Ten different substrates of silicon dioxide<br>
were coated following the method outlined in example 2 and<br>
were sterilely punched into discs with a diameter of 15 mm<br>
to fit in a 24-well plate. Discs were dipped in sterile<br>
PBS (Phospate buffered saline solution, Gibco, UK) and 1<br>
ml of cell suspension (17000 cells/ml) was dispersed over<br>
the silicon dioxide disks and in empty PS-wells<br>
(polystyrene, Falcon, BD Biosciences, Belgium) and<br>
incubated for 24 h and 72 h in triplicates. Medium from<br>
all samples were collected, centrifuged at 400g, 5 min and<br>
stored at -70° C for ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent<br>
assay) analyses of cell released factors. Two discs of<br>
each material were incubated with complete medium without<br>
cells to estimate background values.<br>
Cell amount<br>
Cell amounts in association with the surfaces and<br>
surrounding medium were determined by a NucleoCounter®-<br>
system (ChemoMetec A/S, Denmark). Briefly, cells were<br>
treated with lysis buffer and stabilizing buffer (provided<br>
with the system). Lysed samples were loaded in a<br>
NucleoCassette™ precoated with fluorescent propidium<br>
iodide that stains the cell nuclei, and were then<br>
quantified in the NucleoCounter®.<br><br>
Cell viability<br>
Cell viability was determined by measuring lactate<br>
dehydrogenase content (LDH) in medium, a marker of cell<br>
membrane injury, using a spectrophotometry evaluation of<br>
LDH mediated conversion of pyruvic acid to lactic acid (C-<br>
Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg,<br>
Sweden).<br>
Cytokine determination<br>
The amount of TGF-β1 (Transforming Growth Factor beta 1)<br>
and type I collagen were detected by ELISA kits (Human<br>
TGF-β1, Quantikine®, R&amp;D Systems, UK; Human collagen typel<br>
ELISA KIT, Cosmo Bio Co., Japan) according to the<br>
manufacturer's instruction, in a SpectraVmax ELISA reader<br>
(Molecular Devices, UK).<br>
In vivo<br>
Six different substrates of silicon dioxide (10 mm in<br>
diameter) were coated using the method outlined in example<br>
2 and sterilized. Female Spraque-Dawley rats (200-250 g),<br>
fed on a standard pellet diet and water were anaesthetized<br>
with a mixture of 2,7% isofluran and air (Univentor 400<br>
Anaesthesia Unit, Univentor, Malta) and 0.01 mg Temgesic<br>
was given as analgesic s.c. pre-operatively. Rats were<br>
shaved and cleaned with 5 mg/ml chlorohexidine in 70%<br>
ethanol and each rat received one of each implant type<br>
subcutaneously (s.c.) on the back. The wounds were closed<br>
with 2 sutures (Ethilon 5-0 FS-3, Ethicon®, Johnson &amp;<br>
Johnson, Belgium). The implantation periods were 1 and 3<br>
days to evaluate the early inflammatory process and 21<br>
days for the examination of the fibrous capsule formation<br>
and the late inflammatory response (n=8 rats per time<br>
period). When the explantation was performed the animals<br>
were sacrificed by an overdose of pentobarbital (60 gL-1)<br><br>
after short anaesthetics with a mixture of 2,7% isofluran<br>
and air. The implants and the surrounding exudates were<br>
retrieved. The exudate cells were obtained from the<br>
pockets by repeated aspiration of HBSS (Hank's balanced<br>
salt solution, Gibco, UK) and kept on ice. The exudates<br>
were centrifuged at 400g, 5 min and supernatants were kept<br>
at -70°C. All implantation studies were approved by the<br>
Local Ethical Committee for Laboratory Animals.<br>
Cell amount and cell type<br>
The concentration and type of cells in the exudates<br>
(cells/ml) were counted by light microscopy with Turk<br>
staining in a Biirker chamber and cell amount in<br>
centrifuged exudates and on implants were determined by<br>
NucleoCounter®-system.<br>
Cell viability<br>
Cell viability was determined by Trypan Blue exclusion<br>
using light microscopy and by LDH evaluation (C-<br>
Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg,<br>
Sweden).<br>
Cytokine determination<br>
The amount of TGF-β1 (Transforming Growth Factor beta 1)<br>
and MCP-1 (Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1) were<br>
detected by ELISA kits (Rat TGF-β1, Quantikine®, R&amp;D<br>
Systems, UK; Amersham Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1<br>
[(r)MCP-l], Rat, Biotrak ELISA System, GE Healthcare, UK)<br>
according to the manufacturer's instruction, in a<br>
SpectraVmax ELISA reader (Molecular Devices, UK).<br>
