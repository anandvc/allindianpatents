				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel yellow inorganic pigment from samarium and molybdenum compound and a process for preparing the same. The present invention particularly relates to a process for preparing a yellow inorganic pigment based on the oxides of samarium and molybdenum. The novel compound exhibits a very good chromatic characteristics, in particular a remarkable yellow colour and is non - toxic.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Inorganic pigments/colorants are currently widely used in many industries, especially in those of paints, inks, plastics, rubbers, ceramics, enamels, and glasses. These pigments may impart colouristic properties, and protect the coating from the effects of visible as well as ultraviolet and infrared light. For such applications, their properties like chemical and thermal stability, dispersibility, chromaticity, tint strength and covering or masking power are particularly important criteria to be taken into account in the selection of a suitable pigment.<br>
Yellow is particularly important colour in the ceramic pigment field and the consumption of the yellow exceeds that of any other coloured pigments. There are three important yellow pigment families: tin vanadia yellows (References may be made to DCMA 11-22-4), praseodymium zircon (DCMA 14-43-4), zircon vanadia yellow (References may be made to DCMA 1-01-4). Other yellow ceramic pigments commonly used such as Pb2Sb2O7, PbCrO4, CdS are now being expelled from the market because of their toxicity (References may be made to J.A. Badenes, M. Llusar, M.A. Tena, J. Calbo, G. Monros, J. Eur. Ceram. Soc. 2002,22,1981-1990).<br>
There exist a large number of inorganic pigments formulations in the state of art, in which transtion metals have been employed as chromophores. In contrast, rare earths are quite sparingly used in the inorganic pigments. A notable exception is praseodymium in praseodymium zircon yellow (Dry colour Manufactures Association).<br>
The use of praseodymium doped zirconium silicate crystals as a pigment for use in ceramic glazes was disclosed by C. A. Seabright in U.S. Patent No. 2,992,123, July 1961. Since that time, there have been numerous patents issued for praseodymium doped zircons for ceramic applications and now it is manufactured in world wide. Stable pigment particles comprising praseodymium doped zirconium silicate particles, at least about 50 percent by volume of which range from 0.2 to 2 µm size has been disclosed in a U.S. Patent 5,316,570, May 31,1994, which can be used for plastics and paints.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No. 5,275,649 wherein, they claim a process for the preparation of environment-friendly inorganic yellow pigment based on praseodymium zircons (ZrSiO4: Pr), which can be applied to ceramics because of its thermal stability. However, in the process, mineralizer sodium chloride or sodium fluoride has been employed.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. Patent No. 5,560,772 wherein, they claim a non-toxic yellow/orange pigment compositions well suited for the coloration of wide variety of substrates, for example paints, varnishes, ceramics, etc. comprise a major amount of zirconium oxide and an additive amount of cerium, praseodymium and or terbium values in the form of oxides. However, this pigment preparation requires high temperature for calcinations (1700°C).<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. Patent No. 5,693,102 wherein, they claim oxonitrides with a perovskite of the general formula LnTaON2, where Ln is a rare-earth element, and exhibit yellow-orange to reddish brown in color with an enhanced brightness.These compounds are produced in the presence of mineralizing agent from the series of alkali metal or alkaline earth halides, by annealing a powder mixture consisting of a Ta (V) compound and a Ln compound in a reducing atmosphere of ammonia. However, drawback in the preparation of these perovskites, it is necessary to heat the starting material in the flow of toxic and inflammable ammonia gas for longer periods (20-60 hrs).<br>
Reference may be made to U. S. Patent No. 6,419,735, wherein they claim a process for the preparation of yellow samarium sesquisulphide pigment. The process consists of reacting samarium, trivalent rare earth metal, and alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compounds with a gaseous mixture of hydrogen sulphide and carbon disulphide. The compositions of the invention exhibit a strong yellow colour. However one of the shortcomings of this process is that it utilizes toxic gases for the synthesis of the pigment.<br>
Reference may be made to Patent No. WO9800367 wherein, they claim yellow inorganic pigments consisting of double molybdates of cerium and of an alkali metal, of general formula, CeM(MoO4)2, in which M denotes an alkali metal, preferably sodium. The pigments disclosed in the process were synthesized by precipitation and calcination methods under nitrogen atmosphere. The crystallographic structure of the double molybdates of cerium pigment has been characterized as deformed Scheelite type and monoclinic type.<br>
Reference may be made to Japanese Patent No. JP3954837 wherein, they claim a process for a yellow cerium pigment having a general formula: ACexLn1-xMo2Og wherein x ranges from 0 to 1; A in the composition is at least one selected from the group consisting of Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs and Ln is at least one selected from the group consisting of Y, La, Gd and Lu.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No. 247933 wherein, they claim a process for the synthesis of a series of yellow inorganic pigments, comprising oxides of alkaline earth, praseodymium, and transition metals of the general formula (i) Pr2MoTmxO6+δ (Tm = Ti or Zr and x = 0 or 1) and (ii) APr2MoO7 [A = Mg, Ca, Sr or Ba], well suited for colouring applications of a wide variety of substrates for example paints, varnishes, plastics, ceramics etc.<br>
Although some alternative yellow pigments based on cerium oxide and other transition metal oxides have been reported, but their chromatic properties are not satisfactory for industrial use (References may be made to T. Masui, H. Tategaki, N. Imanaka, J. Mater.<br>
Sci. 2004, 39, 4909-4911; Imanaka et al. Chem. Lett. 2005, 34, 1322-1323; T. Masui, S. Furukawa, and N. Imanaka, Chem. Lett. 2006, 35, 1032-1033; S. Furukawa, T. Masui, N. Imanaka, Journal of Alloys and Compounds 2008, 45, 640-643; P. Prabhakar Rao and M.L.P.Reddy, Dyes and Pigments, 2004, 63, 169-174; Giable George, L. Sandhya Kumari, V.S. Vishnu, S. Ananthakumar and M.L.P. Reddy, J. Solid State Chem. 2008, 181, 487-492).<br>
Unfortunately, the inorganic pigments which are suitable for the above applications and which are in use today on an industrial scale, generally comprise of metals like cadmium, lead, chromium, cobalt etc, the use of which is becoming strictly controlled and are even prohibited, by legislation in many countries, due to their high toxicity. Thus, serious need arises to design environment friendly inorganic yellow pigments devoid of the above cited disadvantages and drawbacks.<br>
Thus the novelty of the present invention is to provide a non-toxic yellow inorganic pigment based on mixed oxides of samarium and molybdenum compounds.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The samarium molybdenum yellow pigments having formula Sm6MoO12 comprising of a cubic crystal structure. Inorganic pigment according to the invention are formed by mixing stoichiometric amounts of high purity (NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O and Sm2O3; ball milled and calcined at a temperature in the range of 1500-1650 C for 10-12 hrs in air. The well ground calcined powders were used for the characterization of pigments. The particle size distribution of the pigment, Sm6MoO12 was investigated in water as a medium and calgon as the dispersing agent measured by the laser scattering particle size distribution analyser (CILAS 930 Liquid). The results show a distribution with 90% of the particles being smaller than 28.63 urn, 50% smaller than 9.55 µm and 10% smaller than 1.25 µm. The mean particle diameter of the pigment sample was found to be 12.72 µm.<br>
The phase purity and optical properties of the prepared pigments were investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis of the typical pigment Sm6MoO12 was carried out in the range of 50-1000°C using Pyris Diamond TG/DTA Perkin Elmer make. It is clear from the thermogram that the pigment is thermally stable up to 1000°C.The typical pigment Sm6MoO12 was tested for its acid and alkali resistance. A pre-weighed quantity of the pigment was treated with 3% HCI/H2SO4/HNO3 and NaOH, and soaked for half an hour with constant stirring using a magnetic stirrer. The pigments were then filtered, washed with water, dried and weighed. No weight loss was noticed for all the acids and alkali tested. The typical L* a* b* values after acid and alkali resistance tests were found to be<br>
 (L* = 85.13; a* = -3.13; b* = 65.06 and L* = 85.09; a* = -3.13; b* = 64.10 for HC1 and NaOH, respectively) same as that of pigment powder sample. Thus the designed yellow pigments are found to be chemically and thermally stable.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is to provide colouring to a substrate (like plastics, polymers etc.). The method includes the steps of providing a substrate, and adding a samarium molybdate yellow pigment to the substrate. The samarium molybdate yellow pigment may be dispersed in the substrate or coated on the substrate. Thermogravimetric analysis of the pigmented polymer sample was carried out in the range of 50-500°C. The thermogravimetric analysis clearly indicates the thermally stability of the coloured polymer up to 225°C. The light resistance of the above Sm6MoO12 dispersed PMMA matrix was tested by exposing it to sunlight at various time intervals and measured the colour coordinates. The L* a* b* values (L* = 68.24; a* = -3.28; b* = 64.10 after 24 h; L* = 67.85; a* = -3.47; b* = 64.18 after 48 h; L* = 68.05; a* = -3.49; b* = 65.89 after 72 h) were same as that of the unexposed sample. This indicates that the pigmented polymer is light resistant. Thus the developed pigments may find potential applications in colouring of various plastic materials as well as coatings.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Sm6MoO12 colorant/pigment - Sm2O3 and (NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O were thoroughly mixed in the stoichiometric ratio in agate mortar with a pestle. The mixture was calcined at 1650°C for 12 h in air atmosphere. The calcined mass was then grinded with mortar and pestle to reduce the particle size of the pigment .The obtained powders were examined by means of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using Ni filtered CuKal radiation with a Philips X'pert Pro diffractometer. The XRD patterns can be indexed to cubic fluorite phase as depicted in Figure 1. The sharp and intense peaks reveal the<br>
crystalline nature of the pigment.Optical reflectance of the powder was measured with UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2450) using barium sulphate as a reference and is shown in Figure 2. The optical absorption edge critically depends on the concentration of molybdenum present in the pigment samples and it absorbs blue light efficiently, which is originated from the O2P-Mo3d charge transitions. As a result, the colour of the pigment samples becomes yellow because blue is a complimentary colour to yellow. The chromaticity coordinates, determined by the CIE-LAB 1976 color scales are L* = 86.67, a* = -3.40, b* = 64.67. The values a* (the axis red-green) and b* (the axis yellow-blue) indicate the color hue. The value L* represents the lightness or darkness of the color as related to a neutral grey scale.<br>
The phase purity and optical properties of the prepared pigments were investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis of the typical pigment Sm6MoO12 was carried out in the range of 50-1000°C using Pyris Diamond TG/DTA Perkin Elmer make. It is clear from the thermogram that the pigment is thermally stable up to 1000°C.The typical pigment Sm6MoO12 was tested for its acid and alkali resistance.

The typical L* a* b* values after acid and alkali resistance tests were found to be (L* = 85.13; a* = -3.13; b* = 65.06 and L* = 85.09; a* = -3.13; b* = 64.10 for HC1 and NaOH, respectively) same as that of pigment powder sample. Thus the designed yellow pigments are found to be chemically and thermally stable.<br>
Example 2 Preparation of Sm6MoO12 colorant/pigment - Sm2O3 and (NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O were thoroughly mixed in the stoichiometric ratio in agate mortar with a pestle. The mixture was calcined at 1650°C for 10 h in air atmosphere. The calcined mass was then grinded with mortar and pestle to reduce the particle size of the pigment.

The optical absorption edge critically depends on the concentration of molybdenum present in the pigment samples and it absorbs blue light efficiently, which is originated from the O2P-Mo3d charge transitions. As a result, the colour of the pigment samples becomes yellow because blue is a complimentary colour to yellow. The chromaticity coordinates, determined by the CIE-LAB 1976 color scales are L* = 83.34, a* = -5.33, b* = 64.21.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of Sm6MoO12 colorant/pigment- Sm2O3 and (NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O were thoroughly mixed in the stoichiometric ratio in agate mortar with a pestle. The mixture was calcined at 1500°C for 10 h in air atmosphere. The calcined mass was then grinded with mortar and pestle to reduce the particle size of the pigment. The obtained powders were examined by means of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using Ni filtered CuKccl radiation with a Philips X'pert Pro diffractometer. The XRD patterns can be indexed to cubic fiuorite phase. The chromaticity coordinates, determined by the CIE-LAB 1976 color scales are L* = 82.15, a* = -7.10, b* = 47.19. The values a* (the axis red-green) and b* (the axis yellow-blue) indicate the color hue. The value L* represents the lightness or darkness of the color as related to a neutral grey scale.<br>
Example 4<br>
Coloration of substrate material- Poly (methyl methacrylate); (PMMA; Sigma Aldrich) was utilized as a binder phase for fabricating the pigmented compact. The typical pigment sample, Sm6MoO12 (prepared in example 1) was ultrasonicated (Vibronics, 250 W, India) in an alcohol/water (1:4) mixture for 10 min to ensure the complete dispersion of the pigment particles. A viscous solution consists of PMMA (90 wt %) was made using a conventional electrical coil heater. The pigment dispersion (10 wt %) was slowly added while stirring and converted into a thick paste. The paste after 2 h of curing, compressed uniaxially into the form of cylindrical discs using a hydraulic press (Lawrence &amp; Maya, India) at a pressure of 25 MPa. Both sides of the pigmented<br>
polymer were lapped using a fine grade emery sheet for obtaining a polished surface. The colour coordinates of the test piece was measured at different locations and an average value was found to be : L* - 67.97; a* = -3.10; b* = 63.18. The colour hue values obtained are more or less the same, indicating the uniform distribution of the pigment particles in the polymer matrix. The intensity of the colour of the plastic depends on the concentration of the pigment being incorporated.<br>
Thermogravimetric analysis of the pigmented polymer sample was carried out in the range of 50-500°C. The thermogravimetric analysis clearly indicates the thermally stability of the coloured polymer up to 225°C. The light resistance of the above Sm6MoO12 dispersed PMMA matrix was tested by exposing it to sunlight at various time intervals and measured the colour coordinates. The L* a* b* values (Z* = 68.24; a* = -3.28; b* = 64.10 after 24 h; L* = 67.85; a* = -3.47; b* = 64.18 after 48 h; L* = 68.05; a* = -3.49; b* = 65.89 after 72 h) were same as that of the unexposed sample. This indicates that the pigmented polymer is light resistant. Thus the developed pigments may find potential applications in colouring of various plastic materials as well as coatings<br>
