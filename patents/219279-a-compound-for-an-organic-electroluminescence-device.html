				<td>DESCRIPTION ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENCE DEVICE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel compound which is used as a light source such as a planar light emitting member of wall televisions and a back light of displays, exhibits excellent efficiency of light emission and heat resistance, has a long life and emits bluish light having excellent purity of color and to an organic electroluminescence device utilizing the novel compound.<br>
BACKaROUNDART<br>
Electroluminescence (referred to as EL, hereinafter) devices using organic substances are expected to he used for inexpensive full color display devices of the solid light emission type which can display a large area and development thereof has been actively conducted. In general, an EL device is constituted with a light emitting layer and a pair of electrodes faced to each other at both sides of the light emitting layer. When a voltage is applied between the electrodes, electrons are injected at the side of the cathode and holes are injected at the side of the anode. The electrons are combined with the holes in the light emitting layer and an excited state is formed. When the excited state returns to the ground state, the energy is emitted as light.<br>
Organic EL devices used heretofore have higher driving voltages, lower luminances of emitted light and lower efficiencies of light emission<br><br>
than inorganic light emitting diodes and, moreover, the properties of organic EL devices deteriorate rather rapidly. Therefore, organic EL devices have not been used for practical applications. Although the properties of recent organic EL devices have been improved remarkably, the efficiency of light emission, the heat resistance and the life are not sufficient for practical applications.<br>
For example, an organic EL device using a dimer or a trimer of phenylanthracene is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei 8(1996)-12600. However, since the above compound used in the device contains two or three anthracene structures bonded through a conjugated group, the organic EL device has a small energy gap and exhibits poor purity of color in emission of blue light. Moreover, since this compound is easily oxidized, impurities tend to be contained and a problem arises with respect to purification. To overcome the above problems, preparation of organic EL devices using a compound in which the 1-position and the 9-position of anthracene are substituted with naphthalene or a compound in which m-position of phenyl group in diphenylanthracene is substituted with an aryl group have been examined. However, the prepared organic EL devices exhibit low efficiencies of light emission and cannot be used for practical applications.<br>
An organic EL device using a monoanthracene derivative substituted with naphthalene is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei ll(1999)-3782. However, this device exhibits an efficiency of light emission as low as 1 cd/a and cannot be used for practical applications. An organic EL device using a compound having a phenylanthracene  structure is  disclosed in United States Patent No.<br><br>
5,972,247. However, this device exhibits an efficiency of light emission as low as 2 cd/A and cannot be used for practical applications although the device exhibits excellent heat resistance due to the substitution with an aryl group at the m-position.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to overcome the above problems and has an object of providing a novel compound which exhibits excellent efficiency of light emission and heat resistance, has a long life and emits bluish light having excellent purity of color and an organic electroluminescence device utilizing the novel compound.<br>
As the result of extensive studies by the present inventors to develop a novel compound having above advantageous properties and an organic EL device using the novel compound, it was found that the object can be achieved by using a compound having the diphenylanthracene structure at the center and a specific structure substituted with an aryl group at end portions.

However, the novel compound of the present invention is not limited to the compounds shown as the examples.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The organic EL device of the present invention is a device in which one or a plurality of organic thin films are disposed between an anode and a cathode. When the device has a single organic layer, a light emitting layer is disposed between an anode and a cathode. The light emitting layer contains a light emitting material and may also contain a hole injecting material to transport holes injected at the anode to the light emitting material or an electron injecting material to transport electrons injected at the cathode to the light emitting material. It is preferable that the light emitting layer is formed with a light emitting material having a very high quantum efficiency of fluorescence emission and excellent ability to transfer holes and electrons and a uniform thin film is formed. The organic EL device having a multi-layer structure has a laminate structure such as: (an anode / a hole injecting layer / a light emitting layer / a cathode), (an anode / a light emitting layer / an electron injecting layer / a cathode) and (an anode / a hole injecting layer / a light emitting layer / an electron injecting layer / a cathode).<br>
In the light emitting layer, where necessary, conventional light emitting materials, doping materials, hole injecting materials and electron injecting materials may be used in addition to any of the compounds represented by general formulae [1], [1"] and [2] to [5] used in the present invention. Deterioration in the luminance and the life caused by quenching can be prevented by the multi-layer structure of the organic EL. Where necessary, light emitting materials, other doping materials, hole injecting materials and electron injecting materials may be used in combination. By using other doping materials, the luminance and the efficiency of light emission can be improved and red light and white light<br><br>
can be emitted. The hole injecting layer, the light emitting layer and the electron injecting layer may each have a multi-layer structure having two or more layers. When the hole injecting layer has a multi-layer structure, the layer into which holes are injected from the electrode is referred to as the hole injecting layer and the layer which receives holes from the hole injecting layer and transports holes from the hole injecting layer to the light emitting layer is referred to as the hole transporting layer. When the electron injecting layer has a multi-layer structure, the layer into which electrons are injected from the electrode is referred to as the electron injecting layer and the layer which receives electrons from the electron injecting layer and transports electrons from the electron injecting layer to the light emitting layer is referred to as the electron transporting layer. These layers are each selected and used in accordance with factors such as the energy level, heat resistance and adhesion with the organic layers or the metal electrodes of the material.<br>
Examples of the material which can be used in the organic layer as<br>
the light emitting material or the host material in combination with any of<br>
the compounds represented by general formulae [1], [1"] and [2] to [5]<br>
include anthracene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, tetracene,<br>

of oxinoid compounds with imidazoles, quinacridone, rubrene, stilbene derivatives and fluorescent pigments. However, the above material is not limited to the compounds described above as the examples.<br>
As the hole injecting material, a compound which has the ability to transfer holes, exhibits an excellent effect of hole injection from the anode and an excellent effect of hole injection to the light emitting layer or the light emitting material, prevents transfer of excited components formed in the light emitting layer into the electron injecting layer or the electron injecting material and has excellent ability to form a thin film is preferable. Examples of the above compound include phthalocyanine derivatives, naphthalocyanine derivatives, porphyrin derivatives, oxazole, oxadiazole, triazole, imidazole, imidazolone, imdazolethione, pyrazoline, pyrazolone, tetrahydroimidazole, oxazole, oxadiazole, hydrazone, acylhydrazone, polyarylalkanes, stilbene, butadiene, triphenylamines of the benzidine-type, triphenylamines of the styrylamine type, triphenylamines of the diamine type, derivatives of these compounds and macromolecular compounds such as polyvinylcarbazole, polysilane and conductive macromolecules. However, the above compound is not limited to the compounds described above as the examples.<br>
Among the hole injection materials which can be used in the organic EL device of the present invention, aromatic tertiary amine derivatives and phthalocyanine derivatives are more effective.<br>
Examples of the aromatic tertiary amine derivative include triphenylamine, tritolylamine, tolyldiphenylamine, N,N"-diphenyl-N,N"-(3-methylphenyl)-l,l"-biphenyl-4,4"-diamine, N,N,N",N"-(4-methylphenyl)-l,l"-phenyl-4,4"-diamine,       N,N,N",N"-(4-methylphenyl)-l,l"-biphenyl-4,4"-<br><br>

In the organic EL device of the present invention, the organic layer may contain at least one of light emitting materials, doping materials, hole injecting materials and electron injecting materials in the same layer in addition to any of the compounds represented by general formula [1], [1"] and [2] to [5]. In order to improve stability of the organic EL device of the present invention with respect to temperature, humidity and atmosphere, a protecting layer may be formed on the surface of the device or the entire device may be protected with silicon oil or a resin.<br>
As the conductive material used for the anode of the organic EL device, a material having a work function of 4 eV or greater is suitable. Examples of such a material include carbon, aluminum, vanadium, iron, cobalt, nickel, tungsten, silver, gold, platinum, palladium, alloys of these metals, metal oxides used for ITO substrates and NESA substrates such as tin oxide and indium oxide and organic conductive resins such as polythiophene and polypyrrol. As the conductive material used for the cathode, a material having a work function smaller than 4 eV is suitable. Examples of such a material include magnesium, calcium, tin, lead, titanium, yttrium, lithium, ruthenium, manganese, aluminum and alloys of these metals. However, the materials used for the anode and the cathode are not limited to the materials described above as the examples. Typical examples of the alloy include alloys of magnesium and silver, alloys of magnesium and indium and alloys of lithium and aluminum. However, the alloy is not limited to these alloys described as the examples. The composition of the alloy is controlled by the temperature of the source of vapor deposition, the atmosphere and the degree of vacuum and can be<br><br>
adjusted suitably.   The anode and the cathode may have a multi-layer structure having two or more layers, where necessary.<br>
In the organic EL device, to achieve efficient light emission, it is<br>
preferable that at least one face of the device is sufficiently transparent in<br>
the wave length region of the emitted light. It is preferable that the<br>
substrate is also transparent. The transparent electrode is disposed in<br>
accordance with vapor deposition or sputtering using the above conductive<br>
material in a manner such that the prescribed transparency is surly<br>
obtained. It is preferable that the electrode disposed on the light emitting<br>
face has a transmittance of light of 10% or greater. The substrate is not<br>
particularly limited as long as the substrate has sufficient mechanical<br>
strength and strength at high temperatures and is transparent. Glass<br>
substrates or transparent films of resins may be used. Example of the<br>
transparent films of resins include films of polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl<br>
acetate copolymers, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymers, polypropylene,<br>
polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyvinyl butyral, nylon, polyether ether ketones, polsulfones, polyether<br>
sulfones, tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymers,<br>
polyvinyl	fluoride,	tetrafluoroethylene-ethylene	copolymers,<br>
tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene copolymers, polychlorotrifluoro-ethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyurethanes, polyether imides, polyimides and polypropylene.<br>
Each layer of the organic EL device of the present invention can be formed suitably in accordance with a dry process of film formation such as vacuum vapor deposition, sputtering, plasma plating and ion plating or a wet process of film formation such as spin coating, dipping and flow<br><br>
coating. The thickness of the film is not particularly limited. However, it is necessary that the thickness be set at a suitable value. When the thickness is greater than the suitable value, a high voltage must be applied to obtain a prescribed output of light and the efficiency decreases. When the thickness is smaller than the suitable value, pin holes are formed and a sufficient luminance cannot be obtained even when the electric field is applied. In general, the suitable range of the thickness is 5 nm to 10 |i,m. A thickness in the range of 10 nm to 0.2 |am is preferable.<br>
When the device is produced in accordance with a wet process, materials forming each layer are dissolved or dispersed in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane and a film is formed from the solution or the suspension. The solvent is not particularly limited. In any organic thin layer, suitable resins and additives may be used to improve the property to form a film and to prevent formation of pin holes. Examples of the resin which can be used include insulating resins such as polystyrene, polycarbonates, polyarylates, polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes, polysulfones, polymethyl methacrylate, polymethyl acrylate and cellulose; copolymers derived from these resins; photoconductive resins such as poly-N-vinylcarbazole and polysilane; and conductive resins such as polythiophene and polypyrrol. Examples of the additive include antioxidants, ultraviolet light absorbents and plasticizers.<br>
As described above, when the compound of the present invention is used for the organic layer of the organic EL device, the organic EL device exhibiting excellent efficiency of light emission and heat resistance, having a long life and emitting bluish light having excellent purity of color can be<br><br>
obtained.<br>
The organic EL device of the present invention can be used for a planar light emitting member such as a flat panel display of wall televisions, a back light for copiers, printers and liquid crystal displays, a light source of instruments, display panels and a marker light.<br>
