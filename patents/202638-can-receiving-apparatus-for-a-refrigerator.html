P2001-55224, filed on September 7, 2001; P2001-55966, filed on September 11, 2001; P2001-56888, filed on September 14, 2001; P2001-56889, filed on September 14, 2001; and P2001-56907, filed on September 14, 2001, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to refrigerators. More particularly, the present invention relates to refrigerators having can receiving devices. Discussion of the Related Art<br>
[0003] Generally, a refrigerator includes a freezing compartment and a refrigerating compartment that are maintained at constant, low temperatures. To accomplish this, a refrigerator operates along a refrigerating cycle by the action of a compressor, a condenser, capillaries, and an evaporator, A refrigerant at low temperature and low pressure passes through refrigerant pipes. The refrigerant evaporates, removing heat, and thus cooling, the air surrounding the evaporator. The cooled air is supplied to the freezing compartment and to the refrigerating compartment to cool them.<br>
2<br><br>
[0004] Most refrigerators have front doors that enable opening and closing of the freezing compartment and/or the refrigerating room. Often, such doors have interior can-receiving devices for storing cans. The structure and operation of a typical door having a can-receiving device is explained with reference to FIG. 1. As shown, a refrigerator door 1 includes an outer case 2 and an inner case 3 that is fastened to the outer case 2. While not shown, between the outer case 2 and the inner case 3 is an insulation material, typically polyurethane.<br>
[0005] Still referring to Fig. 1, the inner case 3 has a plurality of projecting ribs 4a, 4b, and 4c that define predetermined spaces between those ribs. The rib 4c is at the center of the inner case 3, the rib 4a is on the left, and the rib 4b is on the right. Beneficially, the ribs 4a, 4b, and 4c are integral parts of the inner case 3.<br>
[0006] A can-receiving space 10 is formed by a support member 6 that is installed between ribs 4a and 4c. Additionally, a stop member 7 is installed below the support member 6.<br>
[0007] The support member 6 includes a longitudinally extending bar 6a that is fixed in position by upper and lower transverse bars 6b and 6c, and which extends between rib 4a and rib 4c. The bar 6a is for guiding and retaining cans in the can-receiving space 10, The stop member 7 is a bar that extends between rib 4a and rib 4c that stops cans from dropping through the can receiving space 10. The ribs 4a and 4c<br><br>
have fastening holes 5a, 5b, and 5c for retaining the support member 6 and the stop member 7.<br>
[0008] Referring now to FIG. 2, a side cut-away view of FIG. 1, the longitudinal bar 6a and the interior wall of the inner case 3 form a can inlet 8 and a can outlet 9. The can outlet 9 is partially blocked by the stop member 7. Accordingly, a can 11 put through the inlet 8 drops freely through the can receiving space 10 until it is stopped by the stop member 7. When desired, a user can remove the can 11 from the outlet 9.<br>
[0009] While generally successful, the can-receiving assembly described above has problems. First, to install the support member 6 and the stop member 7, a plurality of fastening holes 5a to 5c are formed on ribs 4a and 4c. Since the fastening holes pass through a wall of the inner case 3, the insulation material between the inner case 3 and the outer case 2 can come out of the fastening holes.<br>
[0010] Second, to insert the support member 6 and the stop member 7 into the fastening holes 5a to 5c, a space wider than the support member 6 and the stop member 7 should be temporarily formed between the ribs 4a and 4c. To do so, the space between the ribs 4a and 4c should be expanded by flexing the ribs 4a and 4c. However, because those ribs are hard, this can be difficult to do.<br>
4<br><br>
[0011] Third, a can 11 dropped into the can-receiving assembly can strike the stop member 7 and the inner case 3 with great impact. Thus, the inner case 3 may be damaged and significant noise can be generated.<br>
[0012] Fourth, it is relatively difficult for a user to remove a can 11 due to the structure of the stop member 7. As shown in FIG. 3, to remove a can 11, the user should hold the can 11 in one hand while lifting all of the other cans with the other hand. In other words, a user should use both hands to remove a can 11. This is inconvenient. Also, a user must push their hand into a narrow space below the stop member 7. This is also inconvenient.<br>
[0013] FIG. 4 illustrates another type of can-receiving apparatus. That apparatus is designed to attach with a shelf in the refrigerator. As shown, the can-receiving apparatus takes the form of a receptacle 20 having a rear can inlet 21 and a front can outlet 22. Hooks 24 are used to fixing the receptacle 20 to the shelf. The hooks 24, which are located on the front and rear of the receptacle 20, include hook grooves 24a for grabbing a shelf. The front of the receptacle 20 includes a support guide 23 for preventing cans from freely dropping out of the can outlet 22.<br>
[0014] The receptacle 20 beneficially hangs down from the shelf at an incline such that a can placed in the inlet 21 rolls down to the outlet 22 where it is stopped by the support guide 23.<br>
5<br><br>
[0015] While generally successful, the can-receiving apparatus of FIG. 4 has a significant problem in that it does not easily accommodate cans of different sizes. This is primarily because the receptacle 20 has a constant width W. Thus, if the length of the can is longer than the width of the receptacle 20s the corresponding can cannot be received in the receptacle. Additionally, if a can is shorter than the width W, the can is liable to turn in the receptacle and jam its operation.<br>
[0016] Therefore, a new can-receiving apparatus would be beneficial<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0043] Reference will now be made in detail to illustrated embodiments of the present invention, examples of which axe shown in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts, and the additional explanation thereof will be omitted.<br>
[0044] First Embodiment<br>
[0045] FIG. 5 is a perspective view illustrating a can receiving apparatus for a refrigerator according to a first embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 6 is a side sectional view of the can receiving apparatus of FIG. 5. Referring now to FIG. 5, the first embodiment can receiving apparatus includes a refrigerator door 1 comprised of an outer case 2 and an inner case 3 that is fastened to the outer case 2. The inner case 3 forms an interior wall of the door 1. An insulation material (not illustrated) is beneficially disposed between the outer case 2 and the inner case 3. Ribs 4a, 4b, and 4c are formed on and protrude from the interior wall of a door 1. The rib 4a is on the left of the inner case 3, the rib 4b on the right side, and rib 4c is disposed between ribs 4a and 4b.<br>
[0046] Still referring to FIG. 5, a support member 110 is installed on ribs 4a and 4c such that a can receiving space 100 is formed between the interior wall and the support member 110. A stop member 120 is installed below the support member 110.<br>
11<br><br>
[0047] The support member 110 comprises a longitudinal bar 111 and upper and lower transverse bars 112 and 113. The upper and lower transverse bars 112 and 113 extend between rib 4a and rib 4c and spatially fix the longitudinal bar 111a predetermined distance from the interior wall formed by the inner case 3. This spatial arrangement forms the can receiving space 100. Cans in a horizontal state can be located in the can receiving space 100.<br>
[0048] The stop member 120 is comprised of a bar having ends fixed to ribs 4a and 4c. The stop member 120 prevents cans from dropping through the can receiving space 100.<br>
[0049] Still referring to FIG. 5, the support member 110 and the stop member 120 are indirectly fixed to ribs 4a and 4c by fastening elements 150 that are attached to those ribs. The fastening elements 150 comprise U-shaped fastening projections 151 to 153. Three U-shaped fastening projections 151 to 153 are installed on rib 4c (shown in FIG. 5) and three additional U-shaped fastening projections 151-153 are installed on rib 4a (shown in FIG. 6). For convenience, the top U-shaped fastening projections are referred to as first fastening projections 151, the bottom U-shaped fastening projections are referred to as third fastening projection 153, and the interposed U-shaped fastening projections are referred to as second fastening projections 152. The upper transverse bar 112 extends between the first fastening projections 151, the lower transverse bar 113 of the support rib extends between the second fastening projections 152, and the stop member 120 extends between the third fastening projections 153.<br>
[0050] The "U"-shaped fastening projections 151 to 153 have fastening grooves 151a, 152a, and 153a for receiving ends of the upper and lower transverse bars 112 and 113 the ends of the stop member 120. Open portions 151b, 152b, and<br>
12<br><br>
153b are used to receive the ends of the upper and lower transverse bars 112 and 113 and the ends of the stop member 120. It is beneficial that the open portions 151b to 153b are inclined at a predetermined angle so that they lead toward the interior wall formed by the inner case 3. This simplifies installation of the support member 110 and of the stop member 120. When the support member 110 and the stop member 120 are pulled obliquely downward into the open portions 151b to 153b, the support member 110 and the stop member 120 can be completely fit into the fastening grooves 151a to 153a.<br>
[0051] The fastening elements 150 may be integrally formed with the inner case 3, or they may be selectively attached to the ribs 4a and 4c.<br>
[0052] FIG. 6 shows a side cut-away view of the support member 110 and the stop member 120 fastened" to the inner case 3 of the door 2, As shown, the can receiving space 100 is formed between the longitudinal bar 111 and the interior wall formed by the inner case 3. The support member 110 is fixed to the ribs by inserting the upper and lower transverse bars into the fastening U-shaped grooves of the first and second U-shaped fastening projections 151 and 152. Also, the stop member 120 is firmly fixed to the rib of the inner case 3 since both of its ends are inserted into the fastening U-shaped grooves of the third U-shaped fastening projection 153.<br>
[0053] An inlet 101 is formed between an upper end of the longitudinal bar 110 and the interior wall of the inner case 3. An outlet 103 is formed between a lower end of the longitudinal bar 110 and the stop member 120. Accordingly, a can 11 put into the inlet 8 drops through the can receiving space 100 until it is stopped by the stop member 120 (or until stopped by another can 11). A can 11 can be removed from the outlet 103.<br>
13<br><br>
[0054] In summary, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, fastening holes in the ribs 4a and 4c are not required since the support member 110 and the stop member 120 are fastened to the ribs 4a and 4c by the U-shaped fastening projections 150. Thus, insulation material leakage is prevented. In addition, since the support member 110 and the stop member 120 are shorter than the space between the ribs 4a and 4c, flexing of the ribs 4a and 4c is not required and installation problems are reduced.<br>
[0055] Second Embodiment<br>
[0056] FIG. 7 is a perspective view illustrating a can receiving apparatus for a refrigerator according to a second embodiment of the present invention, while FIGs. 8A and 8B show sectional views of the can receiving apparatus of FIG. 7. Referring now to FIG. 7, the second embodiment of the present invention includes a door 1 that has the same general structure as the door shown in FIG. 5. Thus, the door 1 includes an outer case 2, and a plurality of projecting ribs 4a, 4b, and 4c on an inner case 3. A support member 210 for forming a can receiving space 200 is installed between ribs 4a and 4c. Additionally, a stop member 220 is installed below the support member 210. The second embodiment of the present invention includes speed-reducing features that reduce the speed of a can dropping through the can receiving space 200.<br>
[0057] The support member 210 comprises a longitudinal bar 211 that is spaced apart by a rotary bar 212 from the interior wall formed by the inner case 3. The longitudinal bar 211 and the interior wall guide and retain cans within the can receiving space 200. The rotary bar 212 supports the longitudinal bar 211 and is attached to the ribs 4a and rib 4c such that the rotary bar 212 can rotate over a small angle. As is explained in more detail subsequently, the rotary bar 212 forms part of<br>
14<br><br>
the speed reducing features. The stop member 220 is a bar member having ends fixed to the ribs 4a and rib 4c. The stop member forms a compulsorily stop for the cans in the can receiving space 200.<br>
[0058] Still referring to FIG. 7, a plurality of fastening holes 5a, 5b, and 5c are formed in the ribs 4a and rib 4c. Fastening holes 5a and 5c retain the rotary bar 212 and the stop bar 220 in position. Additionally, a fixing bar 230 is installed in the fastening holes 5b. The purpose of the fixing bar 230 is described below.<br>
[0059] Referring now to FIG. 8A, a spring 240 is placed between a lower portion of the longitudinal bar 211 and the fixing bar 230. The spring 240 has a restoring force that pushes the end of the support member 210 toward the interior wall of the inner case 3. The distance between the fixing bar 230 and the interior wall is greater than the distance between the longitudinal bar 211 and the interior wall.<br>
[0060] The longitudinal bar 211 is installed with an incline relative to the interior wall. In other words, the distance between the longitudinal bar 211 and the interior wall is less at the outlet 203 than at the inlet 201. Thus, the space of the .can receiving space 200 is less at the bottom than at the top. This enables a reduction in the dropping speed of a can 11.<br>
[0061] As shown in FIG. 8A, a can 11 put into the inlet 201 drops down the can receiving space 200. During this process, the can contacts the longitudinal bar 211 and the interior wall of the inner case 3. The dropping can 11 then pushes against the longitudinal bar 211, resulting in compression of the spring 240 and rotation of the rotary bar 212. The can 11 eventually passes through the support member 210 and reaches the stop member 220. The spring 240 then forces the support member 210 to return to its original position.<br>
15<br><br>
[0062] An alternative to the structure shown in FIG. 8A is shown in FIG. 8B. In FIG. 8B there is no fixing bar 230. However, a spring 250 is installed between a lower portion of the longitudinal bar 211 of the support member 210 and the interior wall of the inner case 3. The spring 250 has a restoring force that pulls the longitudinal bar 211 toward the inner case 3. Thus, the can receiving space 200 is narrower at the bottom than at the top. A can 11 dropped into the inlet falls through the can receiving space 200 with a reduced speed.<br>
[0063] Beneficially, the tension of the spring 240 or 250 can be adjusted to achieve a desired operation. Furthermore, other structures can be used in place of the spring 240 or spring 250. For example, a torsion spring could be located on the rotary bar 212.<br>
[0064] In summary, according to the second embodiment of the present invention, the dropping speed of a can is reduced by speed reducing features that include a spring. Accordingly, can impacts on the inner case 3 can be reduced, resulting in reduced damage and noise.<br>
[0065] Third Embodiment<br>
[0066] FIG. 9 is a perspective view illustrating a can receiving apparatus for a refrigerator according to a third embodiment of the present invention, while FIG. 10 shows a sectional view of the can receiving apparatus of FIG. 9. Referring now to FIG. 9, the third embodiment of the present invention includes a door 1 that has the same general structure as the door shown in FIG. 5. Thus, the door 1 includes an outer case 2. and a plurality of projecting ribs 4a, 4b, and 4c on an inner case 3 that forms an interior wall. A support member 310 is installed between ribs 4a and 4c. The support member 310 and the inner case 3 form a can receiving space 300. A stop member 320<br>
16<br><br>
is installed below the support member 310. Additionally, the third embodiment includes speed reduction features that are explained in more detail subsequently.<br>
[0067] The support member 310 is spaced apart from the interior wall of the inner case 3 so as to form the can receiving space 300. The support member 310 includes a longitudinal bar 311 for guiding and retaining cans in the can receiving space 300. The support member 310 further comprises upper and lower transverse bars 312 and 313 that are attached between the ribs 4a and 4c and that fix the longitudinal bar 311 in place.<br>
[0068] The stop member 320 is a bar having ends that are fixed to the ribs 4a and 4c. The stop member 320 prevents cans from dropping through the can receiving space 300.<br>
[0069] The ribs 4a and 4c include a plurality of fastening holes 5a, 5b, and 5c. The holes 5a and 5b retain the upper and lower transverse bars 312 and 313, while the holes 5c retain the stop bar 320.<br>
[0070] The speed reduction features of the third embodiment include at least one buffering protrusion 330 on the interior wall formed by the inner case 3. FIG .9 shows three buffering protrusions 330. A buffering protrusion 330 temporarily disturbs a can dropping through the can receiving space 300.<br>
[0071] As shown in FIG. 10, a can 11 that is put into the inlet 301 drops down the can receiving space 300 until it reaches the stop member 320. To do so, the can 11 drops in a zigzag fashion as it strikes the buffering protrusions 330. This causes the dropping speed of the can 11 to be reduced.<br>
[0072] In summary, according to the third embodiment of the present invention, the dropping speed of a can is reduced by buffering protrusions 330.<br>
17<br><br>
Accordingly, the impacts of the can on the inner case 3 can be reduced, and thus damage and noise is reduced.<br>
[0073] Fourth Embodiment<br>
[0074] FIG. 11 is a perspective view illustrating a can receiving apparatus for a refrigerator according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention, while FIG. 12 is an enlarged perspective view illustrating a stop member in FIG. 11. Referring now to FIG. 11, the fourth embodiment of the present invention includes a door 1 that has the same general structure as the door shown in FIG. 5. Thus, the door I includes an outer case 2, and a plurality of projecting ribs 4a, 4b, and 4c on an inner case 3 that forms an interior wall. A support member 410 is installed between the ribs 4a and 4c, while a stop member 420 is installed between the ribs 4a and 4c below the support member 410.<br>
[0075] The support member 410 comprises a longitudinal bar 411 that acts with the interior wall of the inner case 3 to form a can receiving space 400. The longitudinal bar 411 guides and retains cans placed into the can receiving space 400. The support member 410 further includes upper and lower transverse bars 412 and 413 that are attached to the ribs 4a and 4c and that fix the location of the longitudinal bar 411.<br>
[0076] A plurality of fastening holes 5a, 5b, and 5c are formed on the ribs 4a and 4c. The upper and lower transverse bars 412 and 413 are retained by the fastening holes 5a and 5b, while the stop member 420 is retained by the fastening holes 5c.<br>
[0077] The stop member is shown in more detail FIG. 12. As shown, the stop member 420 includes a fastening section 421, which prevents cans from falling out of<br>
18<br><br>
the can receiving space 400, and a support section (described  in more detail subsequently) that extends from the fastening section 421.<br>
[0078] The fastening section 421 comprises a first fastening section 421a that is inserted in the third fastening hole 5c of rib 4a and that extends a predetermined length from rib 4a, and a second fastening section 421b that is inserted in the third fastening hole 5c of rib 4c and that extends a predetermined length from rib 4c. The distance between the first fastening section 421a and the second fastening section 421b should be less than the length of the can 11.<br>
[0079] The support section comprises vertical connection sections 423 that extend downward from the first fastening section 421a and from the second fastening section 421b, inward connection sections 425 that extend from the vertical connection sections 423 toward the interior wall of the inner case 3, and a horizontal connection section 427 that extends between the connection sections 425. As shown, a can 11 can be held by the inward connection sections 425 and the horizontal connection section 427. Preferably, for easy withdrawal of a can 11, the inward connection section 425 and the horizontal connection section 427 are spaced apart from the bottom surface of the inner case 3.<br>
[0080] While the stop member 420 is shown as being constructed from a single piece of material, such is not required. The various sections and features can be constructed of multiple members.<br>
[0081] In the embodiment of the present invention, a can 11 dropping through the can receiving space 400 falls onto the support section of the stop member 420 and is stopped by the fastening section 421. As shown in FIG. 12, the front and the bottom of the can 11 are exposed. Accordingly, a user can withdraw the can 11 by lifting up and pulling out. During this procedure, it is not required for the user to place his/her<br>
19<br><br>
hand between the stop member 420 and the inner case 3. Since the center of the stop member 420 is open, and thus the front side of the can is exposed, withdrawing a can is easy.<br>
[0082] Fifth Embodiment<br>
[0083] FIG. 13 illustrates a can receiving apparatus for a refrigerator according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention, while FIG. 14 is a perspective view illustrating the bottom of the can receiving apparatus of FIG. 13. Referring now to FIGs. 13 and 14, the fifth embodiment of the present invention includes a receptacle 500 that is comprised of two main bodies, the bodies 510 and 520, that form a can receiving space. Fixing features are provided for fixing the receptacle 500 to a shelf inside a refrigerator, and fastening structures 530, 540, and 550 fasten the bodies 510 and 520 together such that the can receiving space can be varied to accommodate cans of different lengths.<br>
[0084] The body 510 and the body 520 have walls that, when the bodies 510 and 520 are fit together, define a rectangular box that forms a can receiving space. Additionally, the bodies 510 and 520 are configured such that, when they are fit together, an inlet 501 for receiving cans 11 is located at the rear of the receptacle 500 and an outlet 503 for removing cans 11 is located at the front of the receptacle 500. The outlet 503 has a support guide 505 for preventing free dropping of cans 11. The support guide 505 upwardly inclines a predetermined distance at the front of the receptacle 500. The support guide 505 includes a first support guide 505a that extends from the body 510 and a second support guide 505b that extends from the body 520.<br>
[0085] The fixing features comprise hook members 511, 513, 521, and 523 having respective hook grooves 51 la, 513a, 521a, and 523a that are used for attaching<br>
20<br><br>
to a refrigerator shelf. The hook members 511-523 are formed at the front and rear of the receptacle 500. The hook members 511 and 513 extend from the body 510, while the hook members 521 and 523 extend from the body 520.<br>
[0086] The fastening feature 530 comprises fastening sections 533 on the bodies 510 and 520, and a slide bar 531 that extends between the fastening sections 533. The fastening sections 533 include slide holes 533a that receive the slide bar 531. The fastening feature 530 can adjust the distance between the body 510 and the body 520. The slide bar 531 thus serves to fasten the body 510 and the body 520 together while enabling the separation between the bodies 510 and 520 to change. However, a flange 531a is formed on each end of the slide bar 531. The flanges 531a prevent the slide bar 531 from completely seceding from the slide holes 533a.<br>
[0087] The inner bottom surface of the receptacle 500 is partially formed by a plate 560 on the bodies 510 and 520. If the distance between the bodies 510 and 520 becomes too large, the plate 560 prevents cans from dropping through the corresponding gap.<br>
[0088] While the foregoing has described a single fastening feature 530, to improve the fastening between the bodies 510 and 520, a plurality of fastening features can be used. For example, referring now to FIG. 14, fastening features 540 and 550 are on the bottom of the receptacle 500. The fastening features 540 and 550 respectively include fastening sections 543 and 553 on the bodies 510 and 520. Additionally, the fastening features 540 and 550 respectively include slide bars 541 and 551 (both of which beneficially include flanged ends).<br>
[0089] The operation of the receptacle 500 will now be explained. First, the receptacle 500 is attached to a refrigerator shelf with the outlet 503 in the front. Preferably the hook members 511  and 521 on the front of the receptacle 500 are<br>
21<br><br>
somewhat longer than the hook members 513 and 523 on the rear of the receptacle 500. Thus, a can placed in the inlet 501 rolls forward to the outlet 503, where the support guide 505 stops the can. Thereafter, a user can withdraw the can.<br>
[0090] If the length of the can is different than the width of the can receiving space, the bodies 510 and 520 can move along the slide bars 531, 541, and 551 to adjust the width of the can receiving space.<br>
[0091] Alternative structures for adjusting the width W of the can receiving space include the use of a dovetail on body 510 and a dovetail groove on the body 520. Then, the width of the can receiving space can be adjusted by changing the fastening<br>
degree of the dovetail and the dovetail groove. Alternatively, a guide rail (for example, a "   "-shaped guide rail) may be formed on the body 510 while the body 520 has a<br>
guide section that is configured to fit into the guide rail. Then, the width of the can receiving space can be adjusted by varying the position of the guide section in the guide rail.<br>
[0092] In summary, according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention, the width of a receptacle 500 is adjusted according to the size of the can, and thus cans of diverse sizes can be received in the receptacle.<br>
[0093] As described above, the present invention has various advantageous.<br>
[0094] First, fastening holes on an inner case are not required. Accordingly, insulation material leakage is prevented.<br>
[0095] Second, the speed of a can dropping through a can receiving space can be reduced. Thus, the impact of cans on the inner case and any resulting noise can be reduced.<br>
22<br><br>
[0096] Third, the difficulty of removing a can from a can receiving space is reduced.<br>
[0097] Fourth, since the size of the can receiving space is adjusted according to the size of the can, cans of diverse sizes can be accommodated in a can receiving space.<br>
[0098] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art than various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
