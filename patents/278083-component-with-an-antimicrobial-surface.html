				<td>Description<br>
Component with an antimicrobial surface and use thereof<br>
The invention relates to a component with an antimicrobial<br>
surface and to a method for use thereof. It is generally known<br>
from the prior art to mix different substances together in<br>
order to generate an antimicrobial effect. These substances are<br>
also potentially suitable for processing in a coating for a<br>
component. For example, JP 2001-152129 A discloses a powder<br>
mixture which, among other things, also contains MgO and Ni.<br>
Mixing together a large number of different substances is<br>
intended to achieve an antimicrobial action for the widest<br>
possible spectrum of microorganisms (cf. also Derwent Abstract<br>
for JP 2001-152129 A) . The powder can therefore be used to<br>
combat microorganisms. Combat is to be understood in the broad<br>
sense as suppressing the multiplication of the microorganisms,<br>
killing the microorganisms or inactivating them, i.e.<br>
preventing them from exerting a possibly harmful effect. In<br>
addition to microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria, an<br>
antimicrobial action in respect of fungi can also be achieved.<br>
However, the large number of the substances according to JP<br>
2001-152129 A makes it difficult to predict the specific<br>
antimicrobial effects. Moreover, although a mixture of<br>
antimicrobial substances covers a broader spectrum, this may<br>
mean that its action is not so strong. It is therefore an<br>
object to make available a component, and a use thereof, having<br>
a relatively simply configured antimicrobial surface and a<br>
relatively strong antimicrobial action.<br>
 <br>
According to WO 2006/050477 A2, it is known that surfaces with<br>
an antimicrobal action can be used, for example, to keep<br>
drinking water free of germs. As antimicrobial components, it<br>
is proposed to use transition metals, oxides of transition<br>
metals, salts of transition metals, or combinations of these<br>
substances. The transition metals also include manganese,<br>
silver and nickel and, as the oxide of a transition metal, also<br>
manganese oxide. Preferably, a larger number of active<br>
substances can be used simultaneously in order to achieve a<br>
broad-spectrum action on different microorganisms.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved, with the<br>
component mentioned at the outset, by virtue of the fact that<br>
this surface comprises metallic fractions and, touching the<br>
latter, MnO2 fractions, wherein the metallic fraction consists<br>
of Ag and/or Ni. In testing different substance pairings<br>
consisting of a metal and of a ceramic, it has surprisingly<br>
been found that a pairing of MnO2 with Ag and/or Ni has a<br>
particularly strong antimicrobial action. In this way,<br>
components with antimicrobial layers can be produced in a<br>
relatively simple way, and, because of the relatively few<br>
antimicrobial substances used, it is easier to predict the<br>
effect of these components and their compatibility with other<br>
components in the particular case of use.<br>
The surface of the component does not have to be completely<br>
covered with the metallic fractions and the MnO2 fractions. A<br>
partial coating is already sufficient to achieve the<br>
antimicrobial action. Depending on the particular use, the size<br>
of this coating is to be chosen such that the available<br>
antimicrobial surface is sufficient for the desired<br>
 <br>
effect of combating microorganisms and/or fungi. The MnO2<br>
fraction in relation to the overall surface formed by both<br>
fractions should be at least 10%, preferably 30 to 70%, in<br>
particular 50%.<br>
According to the invention, provision is also made that the<br>
MnO2 is present at least partially in the γ modification. The γ<br>
modification is a structural configuration of the crystal<br>
formed by the MnO2 that advantageously has a strong catalytic<br>
action. However, the real structure of the MnO2 does not lie<br>
exclusively in the y modification but in part also in other<br>
modifications (e.g. in the [3 modification of MnO2) . However,<br>
according to a particular embodiment of the invention, the<br>
structural fraction of the MnO2 present in the y modification<br>
should be more than 50% by weight.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, provision is<br>
made that the component consists of the metal providing the<br>
metallic fraction of the antimicrobial surface, and an only<br>
partially covering layer of MnO2 is applied to this component.<br>
These are components made of Ag or Ni which, because of their<br>
material composition, already provide one constituent required<br>
for the production of the antimicrobial surface. The surface<br>
according to the invention can be produced in a particularly<br>
advantageously simple way on these components, by applying a<br>
non-covering layer of the other fraction of the surface, namely<br>
MnO2.<br>
Conversely, it is also conceivable that the component consists<br>
of ceramic providing the MnO2 fraction of the antimicrobial<br>
surface, and an only partially covering layer of the metal is<br>
applied to this component. For example, the component could be<br>
designed as a ceramic component subject to wear. This ceramic<br>
component also<br>
 <br>
does not have to consist exclusively of MnO2. For example, it<br>
is conceivable that the ceramic is produced as sintered ceramic<br>
from different types of particles, with MnO2 representing one<br>
type of said particles. In this variant, however, it should be<br>
noted that the processing temperature for the component must be<br>
below 535°C, since MnO2 is converted to MnO at this temperature<br>
and, consequently, loses its excellent antimicrobial properties<br>
in the material pairing according to the invention.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, provision is<br>
made that the component comprises a coating, which provides the<br>
metallic fractions and the MnO2 fractions of the surface. In<br>
this variant, components of different materials can be coated,<br>
in which case the inventive antimicrobial properties of the<br>
layer are advantageously obtained solely through the nature of<br>
the layer or of the antimicrobial surface formed by the latter.<br>
A suitable coating method must in each case be chosen for the<br>
particular material of the component.<br>
As a method for producing the layer on the component, it is<br>
possible, for example, to use cold-gas spraying in which the<br>
antimicrobial surface is generated by spraying MnO2 particles.<br>
The MnO2 forms only fractions of the antimicrobial surface, and<br>
the metallic fractions are formed by Ni and/or Ag. As has<br>
already been described, the metallic fractions can either be<br>
provided by the component itself or are added as particles to<br>
the cold-gas stream, such that the metallic fractions of the<br>
surface are formed by the developing layer.<br>
 <br>
It is also possible in particular to use MnO2 particles that<br>
have only partially the γ modification of the MnO2 structure.<br>
In this case, the cold-gas spraying has to be carried out at<br>
operating temperatures below the decomposition temperature of<br>
the Γ modification. This temperature is 535°C. When choosing<br>
the temperature of the cold-gas stream, a certain safety<br>
interval in relation to this decomposition temperature can be<br>
maintained. It has been found, however, that if this<br>
temperature is briefly exceeded when the MnO2 particles strike<br>
the surface, this has no effect on the structure, because this<br>
temperature increase occurs only extremely locally in the<br>
surface area of the processed MnO2 particles. The respective<br>
core of the particles, which core remains in an uncritical<br>
temperature range, appears to be able to sufficiently stabilize<br>
the Γ modification of the particle structure, such that the γ<br>
modification of the MnO2 structure is also maintained on the<br>
antimicrobially active surface of the particles.<br>
Moreover, heating the MnO2 to over 450°C leads to conversion of<br>
the MnO2 to Mn2O3. This process, however, takes place only<br>
slowly, such that briefly exceeding the temperature, as happens<br>
in cold-gas spraying, does not cause any damage.<br>
In order to maintain the excellent antimicrobial properties of<br>
the MnO2, the y modification of the structure must be contained<br>
at least partially in the MnO2 particles. This can be achieved<br>
by mixing the MnO2 particles with manganese oxide particles of<br>
other modifications. Another possibility is that the particles<br>
consist of phase mixtures, such that the y modification of the<br>
MnO2 is not the only one present in the particles.<br>
 <br>
It is also advantageous if nanoparticles with a diameter of &gt;<br>
100 nm are processed as MnO2 particles. Nanoparticles within<br>
the meaning of this invention are to be understood as particles<br>
that have a diameter of 
surprisingly found that such small particles of MnO2 can be<br>
deposited on the antimicrobial surface with high efficacy of<br>
deposition. It is normally assumed, by contrast, that particles<br>
of less than 5 µm cannot be deposited by cold-gas spraying,<br>
since the low mass of these particles means that the kinetic<br>
energy imparted by the cold-gas stream is insufficient for<br>
deposition. It has not been possible to establish the reason<br>
why this does not apply specifically to MnO2 particles. In<br>
addition to the effect of the kinetic deformation, it would<br>
appear that other adherence mechanisms are also at play in the<br>
process of layer formation.<br>
The processing of MnO2 nanoparticles has the advantage that,<br>
with relatively little material, it is possible to achieve a<br>
relatively large specific surface area and, as a result, a<br>
pronounced increase in the antimicrobial action. The boundary<br>
lines between the MnO2 fractions and metallic fractions of the<br>
antimicrobial surface are also advantageously greatly<br>
lengthened in this way, which also results in a pronounced<br>
increase in the antimicrobial properties.<br>
It is advantageous if a mixture of MnO2 particles and metallic<br>
particles is used for the metallic fractions of the<br>
antimicrobial surface, that is to say Ni and/or Ag. In<br>
particular, by a suitable choice of temperature and particle<br>
speed in the cold-gas stream, the energy input into the<br>
particles can be controlled in such a way that the specific (or<br>
inner) surface of the produced layer forming the antimicrobial<br>
surface is controlled. By means of<br>
 <br>
a higher porosity of the produced layer, the inner surface can<br>
be enlarged in order to make available an enlarged<br>
antimicrobial surface. In this way, the antimicrobial action<br>
can be increased. By contrast, however, it can also be<br>
advantageous if the surface is as smooth as possible, in order<br>
to counteract a tendency to soiling.<br>
In addition to deposition by cold-gas spraying, other<br>
production methods are of course also conceivable. For example,<br>
the antimicrobial surface can be produced electrochemically. In<br>
this case, the metallic fraction of the antimicrobial surface<br>
is deposited as a layer electrochemically from an electrolyte<br>
in which particles of MnO2 are suspended. During the electro-<br>
chemical deposition process, these particles are then<br>
incorporated in the developing layer and thus also form an MnO2<br>
fraction on the surface of the layer.<br>
Another method is possible in which the layer is produced from<br>
a ceramic containing at least MnO2. For this purpose, a mixture<br>
of pre-ceramic polymers, which form precursors of the desired<br>
ceramic, and metal particles can be applied in a solution to<br>
the component that is to be coated. The solvent is first<br>
evaporated, followed by conversion to the ceramic by heat<br>
treatment, preferably below the decomposition temperature of<br>
the Γ modification of MnO2 (535°C). Better still, the<br>
temperature remains below 450°C, in order to prevent the<br>
formation of Mn2O3.<br>
With said methods, it is also possible to realize, among<br>
others, the following embodiments of the component according to<br>
the invention. Thus, the produced coating can comprise a<br>
metallic layer to which an only partially covering layer of<br>
 <br>
MnO2 is applied. The metallic layer thus forms the metallic<br>
fraction of the surface that appears where the layer of MnO2 is<br>
not covered. In this design of the component, it is<br>
advantageous that only a very small fraction of MnO2 is needed.<br>
It is also conceivable for the abovementioned production<br>
methods to be used in combination.<br>
Another possibility is that the coating comprises a ceramic<br>
layer which provides the MnO2 fraction and to which an only<br>
partially covering metallic layer is applied. This design of<br>
the component is important when the properties of the ceramic<br>
layer are of advantage for the component from the point of view<br>
of construction (for example for protection against corrosion) .<br>
It is also possible that the coating consists of a ceramic<br>
which provides the MnO2 fraction and in which metallic<br>
particles are embedded. This is particularly advantageous if<br>
the ceramic layer is subject to wear and if, in the event of<br>
continuing wear, i.e. removal of the layer, it is intended to<br>
maintain its antimicrobial properties. This is ensured by the<br>
fact that, upon removal of the ceramic layer, more and more<br>
MnO2 particles are exposed, which guarantee the MnO2 fraction<br>
on the surface. It is of course also conceivable that the layer<br>
comprises a metallic matrix in which the particles of MnO2 are<br>
embedded. For this layer too, the argument applies to the<br>
effect that the antimicrobial properties of the layer are<br>
maintained as it is removed.<br>
The component can also be designed such that the component or a<br>
layer applied thereto consists of a<br>
 <br>
material different from the metallic fraction and from MnO2,<br>
and particles are present in and/or on said material (when<br>
subject to wear, see above), which particles each provide the<br>
metallic fractions and the MnO2 fractions on their surface<br>
(meaning the surface of the particles). These are<br>
advantageously tailor-made particles that have antimicrobial<br>
properties and that can be introduced universally onto any<br>
surface or into any matrix. The method must be chosen that is<br>
suitable in each case for the introduction or application. By<br>
this means, for example, components made of plastic can also be<br>
produced with antimicrobial properties. The particles<br>
introduced into the layer or the component are either exposed<br>
when subject to wear or, if the component has a porous<br>
structure, can also be involved in the antimicrobial action if<br>
they form the walls of the pores.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the component has a surface<br>
that has low wettability. This surface is suitable for<br>
components that are intended to have self-cleaning properties,<br>
for example because they are exposed to weathering. It has been<br>
found that self-cleaning properties, which depend greatly on<br>
the low wettability of the surface, are reduced if<br>
microorganisms colonize this surface. This can be prevented by<br>
an antimicrobial action of this surface, such that the self-<br>
cleaning effect is advantageously maintained over a long period<br>
of time.<br>
Finally, the invention also relates to the use of the above-<br>
described component for combating microorganisms and/or fungi<br>
that come into contact with the component. The statements made<br>
above also apply to the use of the component.<br>
 <br>
Further details of the invention are described below with<br>
reference to the drawing. Identical or corresponding elements<br>
in the drawing are provided with the same reference signs in<br>
the individual figures and are explained more than once only<br>
insofar as there are differences between the individual<br>
figures. Figures 1 to 5 show different illustrative embodiments<br>
of the component according to the invention with different<br>
antimicrobial surfaces.<br>
Figures 1 to 5 each show a component 11 with a surface 12 that<br>
has antimicrobial properties. These properties are brought<br>
about by the fact that the surface in each case comprises a<br>
fraction 13 consisting of MnO2, and, furthermore, a metallic<br>
fraction 14 of Ag or Ni is also provided.<br>
However, there are differences as regards the structure of the<br>
components 11, which structure is in each case shown in cross<br>
section. The component according to Figure 1 consists itself of<br>
Ni or Ag, such that the surface 12 thereof automatically<br>
provides the metallic fraction 14. Moreover, islands of MnO2<br>
are formed on the surface 12 and provide the fraction 13. These<br>
can be applied, for example, as a non-covering coating by cold-<br>
gas spraying.<br>
Figure 2 shows a component 11 that is made of a material<br>
unsuitable for generating the antimicrobial properties of the<br>
surface. Therefore, a metallic layer 15 of Ni or Ag is applied<br>
to this component 11. Onto this layer, which provides the<br>
fraction 14, MnO2 is applied in the manner described with<br>
reference to Figure 1, such that fractions 13 are also<br>
obtained.<br>
Figure 3 shows that the metallic layer can also be doped with<br>
particles 16 of MnO2, i.e. that<br>
 <br>
these particles are located in the metallic matrix 17 of the<br>
metallic layer 15. To this extent they also form the part of<br>
the surface 12 that provides the fraction 13. The rest of the<br>
surface forms the fraction 14.<br>
In Figure 4, the coating 15 is formed by a ceramic matrix 21,<br>
the latter having pores 22 that increase the inner surface<br>
compared to the outer surface 12 of the component and thus also<br>
strengthen an antimicrobial effect. In the ceramic matrix 21,<br>
metallic particles 23 are provided which, on the surface 12,<br>
provide the fraction 13 and which also, in the pores, can exert<br>
an antimicrobial effect. As is also the case in Figure 2 and<br>
Figure 3, the component 11 according to Figure 4 can be made of<br>
any desired material, it is necessary only to ensure that the<br>
coating 15 adheres to the component 11.<br>
The component 11 according to Figure 5 comprises a matrix made<br>
of any desired material 24, e.g. plastic. Particles 25 are<br>
introduced into this matrix, the surface of each of these<br>
particles having metallic fractions of Ni or Ag and also<br>
fractions of MnO2. In the illustrative embodiment according to<br>
Figure 5, the particles themselves consist of the metal, and<br>
the ceramic fractions are formed on the surface of the<br>
particles. The reverse configuration is of course also<br>
conceivable. Some of the particles lie exposed on the surface<br>
12 of the component 11, as a result of which the metallic<br>
fractions 14 and the MnO2 fractions 13 are formed 13. There are<br>
also fractions 26 of the surface 26 made of plastic that have<br>
no antimicrobial action. The ratio of the fractions mentioned<br>
can be influenced directly by the degree of filling of<br>
particles 25 in the material 24.<br>
The table below shows the antimicrobial properties achieved by<br>
surface samples<br>
 <br>
according to the invention. The following surfaces were<br>
examined in tests. A pure Ni surface, a surface formed from Ni<br>
and Pd, the surface according to the invention with Ni and<br>
MnO2, as further reference a surface consisting of Ni, Pd and<br>
MnO2, and, finally, the surface according to the invention<br>
consisting of Ag and MnO2. The reference surfaces with Pd were<br>
examined for the reason that a strong antimicrobial action is<br>
ascribed to this material on its own and in combination with<br>
Ag. The pure Ni surface was examined in order to obtain a<br>
reference value for the antimicrobial action of this metal per<br>
se. The antimicrobial action of Ag and Ag/Pd is generally known<br>
and has also been proven, for which reason no such sample was<br>
tested.<br>
The surfaces tested were generated by producing layers by means<br>
of cold-gas spraying. Depending on the desired surface<br>
composition, suitable powder mixtures were sprayed on. It was<br>
found that MnO2 in particular could be processed in<br>
unexpectedly high concentrations, such that a relatively large<br>
fraction of MnO2 on the surface was achievable.<br>
To demonstrate the antimicrobial action, the surfaces were<br>
colonized by bacterial cultures of Escherichia coli and<br>
Staphylococcus aureus. The materials were tested according to<br>
ASTM E 2180-01. The test microbes were incubated for 30 minutes<br>
or 4 hours on the relevant surfaces before determination of the<br>
viable microbes. The test surfaces were stored at 20°C during<br>
the tests. The test microbes were suspended, and the suspension<br>
contained a microbe count of between 106 and 107 per ml. The<br>
test surfaces were contaminated by application in each case of<br>
0.5 ml of the microbe suspension, which were stored<br>
horizontally for the duration of the test. The number of<br>
microbes that could be recovered was<br>
 <br>
determined after different times, specifically after 30 minutes<br>
and after 4 hours. To determine the number of colony-forming<br>
units (CFU), the residual microbes removed from the samples<br>
were incubated. The number of CFU recovered was compared to the<br>
microbes originally present arithmetically on the whole test<br>
surface, such that the percentage value shown in the table is<br>
an indicator of the amount of still viable microbes remaining.<br>
 <br>
A comparison of the test results as shown in the table shows<br>
the following. The surfaces consisting only of Ni and MnO2 or<br>
of Ag and MnO2 show by far the strongest antimicrobial<br>
properties, which is confirmed in particular by the values<br>
after 3 0 minutes. Therefore, the microbicidal action is not<br>
only virtually complete, it also takes place rapidly. It has<br>
also been shown that the pairing of Ni and MnO2 is not inferior<br>
to the pairing of Ag and MnO2, although Ni on its own, unlike<br>
Ag on its own, does not have excellent antimicrobial<br>
properties.<br>
 <br>
This has the advantage that, instead of the silver that is<br>
often used for microbicidal purposes, it is possible to use the<br>
physiologically entirely safe Ni. This makes the surfaces<br>
according to the invention available also for applications in<br>
the food industry for example, which has refrained from using<br>
silver ions because of silver-containing surfaces.<br>
It will also be seen that it is not possible to generate the<br>
antimicrobial action using any pairings of MnO2 with metals. As<br>
is shown by the example of Ni + Pd and also by the example of<br>
Ni + Pd + MnO2, the antimicrobial action is reduced by the<br>
presence of Pd, and this has to be taken into account in<br>
generating antimicrobial surfaces. In such a case, a metallic<br>
component whose own surface impairs the antimicrobial<br>
properties of the Ni—MnO2 or Ag-MnO2 systems should be covered<br>
completely by a layer that provides the antimicrobial surface.<br>
 <br>

thereto consists of a material (24) different from the<br>
metallic fraction (14) and from MnO2, and particles (25)<br>
are present in and/or on said material (24) , which<br>
particles (25) each provide the metallic fractions (14)<br>
and the MnO2 fractions (13) on their surface (12) .<br>
11.	The component as claimed in one of the preceding claims,<br>
characterized in that the surface has low wettability.<br>
 <br>
12. Use of the component as claimed in one of the preceding<br>
claims for combating microorganisms and/or fungi that come<br>
into contact with the component.<br>
 <br>
<br>
The invention relates to a component (11) with an antimicrobial surface (12).<br>
According to the invention, the surface (12) comprises metal portions (14) and<br>
fractions composed of MnO2 (13) that touch the former, wherein the metal<br>
fractions consist of Ag and/or Ni. It has been surprisingly shown that these<br>
material pairs achieve a much improved antimicrobial effect in comparison to<br>
the pure metals. In particular when using the toxicologically safe Ni, these<br>
antimicrobial surfaces can even be used in the food industry, for example. The<br>
surface can, for example, be applied by way of a coating (15) of the<br>
component, wherein the metal fraction and the fraction of MnO2 are applied<br>
in two layers (19, 20).<br>
