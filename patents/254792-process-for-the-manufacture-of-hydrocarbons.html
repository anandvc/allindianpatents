Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of hydrocarbons,<br>
particularly branched hydrocarbons from renewable sources and to a process for<br>
the manufacture of hydrocarbons, suitable for diesel fuel pool. The process com-<br>
prises a skeletal isomerisation step and a deoxygenation step carried out by decar-<br>
boxylation/decarbonylation or hydrodeoxygenation.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Fatty acids have been used as raw materials in various applications in the chemi-<br>
cal industry, typically in the manufacture of products ranging from lubricants,<br>
polymers, fuels and solvents to cosmetics. Fatty acids are generally obtained from<br>
wood pulping processes or by hydrolysis of triglycerides of vegetable or animal<br>
origin. Naturally occurring triglycerides are usually esters of glycerol and straight<br>
chain, even numbered carboxylic acids having 10-26 carbon atoms. Most common<br>
fatty acids contain 16, 18, 20 or 22 carbon atoms. Fatty acids may either be satu-<br>
rated or they may contain one or more unsaturated bonds. Unsaturated fatty acids<br>
are often olefinic having carbon-carbon double bonds with cis configuration. The<br>
unsaturated centres appear in preferred positions in the carbon chain. The most<br>
common position is ω9, like in oleic acic (C18:1) and erucic acid (C22:1). Poly-<br>
unsaturated acids generally have a methylene-interrupted arrangement of cis-<br>
olefinic double bonds.<br>
Saturated long straight chain fatty acids (C10:0 and higher) are solid at room tem-<br>
perature, which makes their processing and use difficult in a number of applica-<br>
tions. Unsaturated long chain fatty acids like e.g. oleic acid are easily processable<br>
liquids at room temperature, but they are unstable because of double bond(s).<br><br>
Branched fatty acids mimic the properties of straight chain unsaturated fatty acids<br>
in many respects, but they are more stable. For example branched C18:0 fatty<br>
acid, known as isostearic acid, is liquid at room temperature, but it is not as unsta-<br>
ble as C18:l acid, since the unsaturated bonds are absent in branched C18:0.<br>
Therefore, branched fatty acids are more desirable for many applications than<br>
straight chain fatty acids.<br>
Diesel fuels based on biological material are generally referred to as biodiesel. A<br>
definition for "biodiesel" is provided in Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)<br>
guidelines as follows: Biodiesel is mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids de-<br>
rived from vegetable oils or animal fats, which conform to ASTM D6751 or EN<br>
14214 specification for use in diesel engines as described in following Table 1.<br>
Biodiesel refers to pure fuel before blending with diesel fuel (B100).<br><br>
High cetane number, proper viscosity range and good low-temperature properties<br>
are required for a good diesel fuel. Cetane number (CN) has been established for<br>
describing the ignition quality of diesel fuel or its components. Branching and<br>
chain length influence CN, the CN decreasing with decreasing chain length and<br><br>
increasing branching. Hexadecane C16H34 has a CN of 100, and 2,2,4,4,6,8,8 -<br>
heptamethylnonane C16H34 has a CN of 15. From structural features also double<br>
bonds decrease CN. Further, compounds with unsaturation can cause gumming in<br>
engines.<br>
Besides CN, gross heat of combustion (HG) of a compound is essential in provid-<br>
ing the suitability of the compound to be used as diesel fuel. For comparison the<br>
HGs of paraffinic and ester biodiesels are as follows: HG of hexadecane is 2559<br>
kg cal/mol at 20 °C and of methyl palmitate (C16:0) 2550 kg cal/mol.<br>
Cloud point presents the temperature where a petroleum product shows just a<br>
cloud or haze of wax crystals when it is cooled under standard test conditions, as<br>
described in standard ASTM D2500. Cloud point measures the ability of the fuel<br>
to be used in cold weather without plugging filters and supply lines.<br>
Pour point is the lowest temperature at which a fuel will just flow when tested<br>
under the conditions described in standard ASTM D97. It is recommended by<br>
engine manufacturers that the cloud point should be below the temperature of use<br>
and not more than 6 °C above the pour point. Branching, saturation and chain<br>
length influence also cloud and pour points and they decrease with decreasing<br>
chain length, increasing unsaturation and increasing branching.<br>
The viscosity of vegetable oils is approximately one order of magnitude greater<br>
than that of conventional diesel fuels. High viscosity results in poor atomization in<br>
combustion chamber, thus causing coking of nozzles and deposits.<br>
Biodiesel is an alternative fuel, produced from renewable sources and it contains<br>
no petroleum. It can be blended in minor amounts with petroleum diesel to create<br>
a biodiese blend, further it is non-toxic and essentially free of sulfur and aromat-<br>
ics. It can be used in compression-ignition (diesel) engines with little or no modi-<br>
fications.<br><br>
Diesel fuels based on biological material have been demonstrated to have signifi-<br>
cant environmental benefits in terms of decreased global warming impacts, re-<br>
duced emissions, greater energy independence and a positive impact on agricul-<br>
ture.<br>
It has been demonstrated that the use of diesel fuels based on biological material<br>
will result in a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. A biodiesel life-<br>
cycle study of 1998, jointly sponsored by the US Department of Energy and the<br>
US Department of Agriculture, concluded that biodiesel reduces net CO2 emis-<br>
sions by 78 percent compared to petroleum diesel. This is due to biodiesel's<br>
closed carbon cycle. CO2, released into the atmosphere when burning biodiesel, is<br>
recycled by growing plants, which are later processed into fuel. As such, the in-<br>
creased use of diesel fuels based on biological material represents an important<br>
step to meet the emission reduction target as agreed under the Kyoto agreement. It<br>
is also believed that particulate emissions and other harmful emissions, such as<br>
nitrogen oxides, alleviating human health problems, are reduced.<br>
Methyl esters of long-chain acids have higher cloud and pour points than the cor-<br>
responding triglycerides and conventional diesel fuels. Cloud and pour points are<br>
important features when operating engines in cooler environment.<br>
Several approaches, as such transesterification, dilution, micro-emulsification and<br>
co-solvent blending, as well as pyrolysis have been suggested for obtaining diesel<br>
fuel from vegetable oils and other triacylglycerol based feedstocks. The object of<br>
said approaches is to reduce the high kinematic viscosity of neat vegetable oils,<br>
which can cause severe operational problems and improper atomization of the<br>
fuel.<br>
In transesterification, triglycerides forming the main component in vegetable oils<br>
are converted into the corresponding esters with an alcohol in the presence of<br><br>
catalysts. Methanol is the most commonly used alcohol due to its low cost and<br>
easy separation from the resulting methyl ester and glycerol phases.<br>
Diluting 0 - 34 % of vegetable oils with conventional diesel fuel leads to proper<br>
atomization but causes engine problems similar to those with neat vegetable oils.<br>
Micro-emulsion fuels are composed of conventional diesel fuel and/or vegetable<br>
oil, a simple alcohol, an amphiphilic compound such as a surfactant and a cetane<br>
improver. Trace quantities of water are usually required for formation of the mi-<br>
croemulsion.<br>
Pyrolytic methods, Kolbe electrolysis and thermal and catalytic cracking of bio-<br>
materials like vegetable oils, their methyl esters and animal fats result in a wide<br>
spectrum of products, such as alkanes, alkenes, aromatics and carboxylic acids.<br>
The reactions are generally unselective and less valuable by-products are formed<br>
too.<br>
Unsaturated and aromatic hydrocarbons present in the liquid fraction make the<br>
products obtained by the above methods unattractive for the diesel pool. Poor<br>
low-temperature properties of the products limit their wider use as biodiesel in<br>
regions with colder climatic conditions. In addition, the presence of oxygen in<br>
esters results in undesirable higher nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions compared to<br>
conventional diesel fuels.<br>
Sulphur free fuels are required in order to gain the full effect of new and efficient<br>
anti-pollution technologies in modem vehicles and to cut emissions of nitrogen<br>
oxides, volatile hydrocarbons and particles, as well as to achieve direct reduction<br>
of sulphur dioxide in exhaust gases. The European Union has decreed that these<br>
products must be available io the market from 2005 and must be the only form on<br>
sale from 2009. This new requirement will reduce annual sulphur emissions from<br>
automotive fuels.<br><br>
Branched fatty acids and fatty acid esters, mainly methyl and ethyl esters, are ob-<br>
tained by isomerisation of straight chain, unsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid<br>
esters having a corresponding chain length, as described in patent US 5,856,539.<br>
For example, branched C18:0 acids are prepared from straight chain C18:l acids<br>
or also C18:2 acids.<br>
Decarboxylation of carboxylic acids to hydrocarbons by contacting carboxylic<br>
acids with heterogeneous catalysts was suggested by Maier, W. F. et al:<br>
Chemisette Berichte (1982), 115(2), 808-12. Ni/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2 catalysts were<br>
tested for decarboxylation of several carboxylic acids. During the reaction the<br>
vapours of the reactant passed through a catalytic bed together with hydrogen at<br>
180 °C and 0.1 MPa. Hexane represented the main product of the decarboxylation<br>
of heptanoic acid. When nitrogen was used instead of hydrogen no decarboxyla-<br>
tion was observed.<br>
US 4,554,397 discloses a process for the manufacture of linear olefins from satu-<br>
rated fatty acids or esters by decarboxylation using a catalytic system, which con-<br>
sists of nickel and at least one metal selected from the group consisting of lead, tin<br>
and germanium. Additives may be included in the above-mentioned catalysts and<br>
for example sulphur derivatives may be added to decrease the hydrogenating<br>
power of nickel and make the reaction more selective for olefin formation reac-<br>
tion. The presence of hydrogen was necessary to maintain the activity of the cata-<br>
lyst The reaction was carried out at a temperature of 300 - 380 °C and the pres-<br>
sure was atmospheric pressure or higher.<br>
Decarboxylation accompanied with hydrogenation of oxo-compcund is described<br>
in Laurent, E., Delmon, B.: Applied Catalysis, A: General (1994), 109(1), 77-96<br>
and 97-115, wherein hydrodeoxygenation of biomass derived pyrolysis oils over<br>
sulphided C0M0/AI2O3 and NiMo/Al2O3 catalysts was studied. Hydrotreating<br>
conditions were 260-300 °C and 7 MPa in hydrogen. The presence of hydrogen<br><br>
sulphide promoted the decarboxylation, particularly when a NiMo catalyst was<br>
used.<br>
Unsaturated and aromatic hydrocarbons produced in the side reactions in the<br>
above-mentioned processes make the obtained products unattractive for the diesel<br>
pool. In addition, the unbranched and highly saturated structures cause poor low-<br>
temperature properties.<br>
FI 100248 describes a two-step process for producing middle distillate from vege-<br>
table oil by hydrogenating fatty acids or triglycerides of vegetable oil using com-<br>
mercial sulphur removal catalysts (NiMo and CoMo) to give n-paraffms and then<br>
by isomerising said n-paraffms using metal containing molecule sieves or zeolites<br>
to obtain branched-chain paraffins. The hydrotreating was carried out at reaction<br>
temperatures of 330 - 450 °C.<br>
Based on the above it can be seen that here is a need for a new alternative process<br>
for the preparation of saturated and branched hydrocarbons from renewable<br>
sources, suitable as biodiesel of high quality.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
An object of the invention is a process for the manufacture of branched saturated<br>
hydrocarbons from renewable sources.<br>
A further object of the invention is a process for the manufacture of branched<br>
saturated hydrocarbons suitable for the diesel fuel pool.<br>
Characteristic features of the process according to the invention are provided in<br>
the claims.<br><br>

The term "branched fatty acids" is herein to be understood to comprise fatty acids<br>

chain at any position. Said alkyl groups are generally C1-C4 alkyl chains.<br>
Pressures are here understood to mean overpressures above atmospheric pressure.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a catalytic process for the manufacture of<br>
branched saturated hydrocarbons, which are suitable for diesel fuel pool, from<br>
renewable sources, such as plant, vegetable, animal and fish fats and oils and fatty<br>
acids. The invention concerns the transformation of a feedstock comprising fatty<br>
acids or fatty acid esters with lower alcohols into branched fatty acids or fatty acid<br>
esters with a acidic catalyst, followed by converting the obtained branched fatty<br>
acids or fatty acid esters into branched hydrocarbons either by contacting with a<br>
heterogeneous decarboxylation/decarbonylation catalyst or with a hydrodeoxy-<br>
genation catalyst.<br><br>
The branched hydrocarbon product formed via the decarboxyla-<br>
tion/decarbonylation reaction has one carbon atom less than the original fatty acid,<br>
and the branched hydrocarbon product formed via the hydrodeoxygenation reac-<br>
tion has an equal number of carbon atoms compared to the original fatty acid.<br>
A high quality hydrocarbon product with good low temperature properties and<br>
high cetane number is obtained, employing minimum amount of hydrogen in the<br>
process.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
It has now been surprisingly found that saturated and branched hydrocarbon, suit-<br>
able for biodiesel fuel, can be obtained from oxygen containing feedstocks origi-<br>
nating from renewable sources by skeletal isomerisation followed by removal of<br>
oxygen utilising deoxygenation carried out by decarboxylation/decarbonylation or<br>
hydrodeoxygenation.<br>
In the first process step a feedstock comprising unsaturated fatty acids or fatty<br>
acid esters with lower alcohols, or mixtures thereof are subjected to skeletal isom-<br>
erisation wherein they are isomerised to fatty acids or fatty acid alkyl esters con-<br>
taining short alkyl branches in their carbon chain. In the subsequent process step<br>
the branched products are deoxygenated. The deoxygenation is carried out by de-<br>
carboxylation/decarbonylation wherein oxygen is removed in the form of CO and<br>
CO2, or alternatively by hydrodeoxygenation wherein oxygen is removed in the<br>
form of H2O from the isomerised fatty acids or fatty acid alkyl esters. The process<br>
may also comprise an optional prehydrogenation step before the deoxygenation<br>
step to remove unsaturation after skeletal isomerisation and to liberate lower alco-<br>
hol in hydrodeoxygenation.<br>
The process according to the invention provides a convenient way for the manu-<br>
facture of branched hydrocarbons from fstty scids or fatty acid esters with lower<br><br>
alcohols. The fatty acid and fatty acid esters originate from biological feedstock<br>
such as plant, vegetable, animal and fish oils and fats.<br>
Feedstock<br>
The feedstock comprises fatty acids or fatty acid esters with C1 - C5, preferably C1<br>
- C3 alcohols, or mixtures thereof. The feedstock preferably originates from bio-<br>
logical raw materials such as plant, vegetable, animal and fish oils and fats. Bio-<br>
logical raw materials my be treated using any pre-treatment or purification<br>
method known in the art to obtain the fatty acids or fatty acid esters useful as the<br>
feedstock, such as hydrolysis etc. The feedstock comprises at least 20 % by<br>
weight, preferably at least 50 % by weight and particularly preferably 80 % by<br>
weight of unsaturated fatty acids or fatty acid esters. The feedstock may also<br>
comprise mixtures of fatty acids and fatty acid esters, but it is preferable to use<br>
either fatty acids or fatty acid esters.<br>
The unsaturated fatty acid used as the feedstock is a fatty acid having unsaturated<br>
bonds and a total carbon number of 8 to 26, preferably 12 to 20 and particularly<br>
preferably 12 to 18. With respect to the degree of unsaturation, i.e., the number of<br>
unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds, any unsaturated fatty acids may be used as long<br>
as one or more unsaturated carbon-carbon are present in the molecule.<br>
The feedstock may comprise C1 - C5, preferably C1 - C3 alkyl esters of unsaturated<br>
fatty acids having a total carbon number of 8 - 26, preferably 12-20 and particu-<br>
larly preferably 12-18, corresponding to the above-mentioned unsaturated fatty<br>
acids. Examples of suitable alkyl esters include methyl esters, ethyl esters and<br>
propyl esters of said unsaturated fatty acids, with preference given to methyl es-<br>
ters.<br>
Typically, the number of unsaturated bonds in the feedstock is 1 to 3. Preferably<br>
the feedstock comprises at least 40 % by weight of monounsaturated fatty acids or<br><br>
fatty acid esters, more preferably at least 70 % by weight. The feedstock may also<br>
comprise polyunsaturated fatty acids or fatty acid esters. The presence of an un-<br>
saturated bond in the molecule causes the formation of a cation as an intermediate,<br>
thereby facilitating the skeletal isomerisation reaction.<br>
Skeletal isomerisation<br>
In the first step of the process according to the present invention branched chain<br>
fatty acids or alkyl esters of fatty acids are prepared. The earlier described feed-<br>
stock is subjected to a skeletal isomerisation step. The skeletal isomerisation is<br>
carried out at a temperature of 150 - 400 °C, under the pressure of 0 - 5 MPa, pref-<br>
erably at 200 - 350 °C and 0.1 - 5 MPa and particularly preferably at 220 - 300 °C<br>
and 0.1-2 MPa using an acidic catalyst. Suitable acidic catalysts are silico alu-<br>
mino phosphates and zeolites, preferably faujasite, offeretite, montmorillonite and<br>
mordenite. Particularly preferably the catalyst is mordenite.<br>
Water or a lower alcohol may be added to the feedstock to suppress acid anhy-<br>
dride formation due to dehydration or dealcoholation. It is preferable to add water<br>
when the feedstock comprises unsaturated fatty acids and alcohol when the feed-<br>
stock comprises esters of unsaturated fatty acids. Typically the amount of added<br>
water or lower alcohol is 0 - 8 %, and preferably 1-3 % by weight based on the<br>
total reaction mixture. The lower alcohol is C1 - C5 alcohol, and preferable alco-<br>
hols are methanol, ethanol and propanol, with a greater preference given to those<br>
having the same alkyl group as that of the starting fatty acid ester to be isomer-<br>
ised. Excess water (more than 10 %) should be avoided in order to prevent<br>
estolide formation. The skeletal isomerisation step may also be carried out in the<br>
absence of water or lower alcohol.<br>
The skeletal isomerisation step may be carried out in a closed batch reactor under<br>
the reaction pressure. This is to prevent vaporization of water, alcohols and other<br>
low boiling substances in the system, including those substances contained in a<br><br>
catalyst. The reaction time is preferably less than 24 hours, more preferably less<br>
than 12 hours and most preferably less than 30 minutes.<br>
In general, the amount of catalyst employed in the process is 0.01 - 30 % by<br>
weight based on the total reaction mixture, preferably the amount of catalyst used<br>
is 1 -10% by weight.<br>
When a continuous flow reactor is used the space velocity WHSV is 0.1 - 100 1/h,<br>
more preferably 0.1 - 50 1/h and most preferably 1 - 101/h.<br>
The product from the skeletal isomerisation step contains both saturated as well as<br>
unsaturated branched chain fatty acids or esters of fatty acids. Possible by-<br>
products are cyclic acids and polymeric fatty acids, such as dimer acids and poly-<br>
meric fatty acid esters, when the feedstock comprises esters of unsaturated fatty<br>
acids. The obtained branched chain compounds normally have short alkyl side<br>
chains, the length being from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and they are obtained as mix-<br>
tures of many isomers with different branching positions.<br>
Preferably, the obtained branched chain fatty acids or fatty acid esters are sepa-<br>
rated from dimer acids for example by distillation, their unsaturated bonds are<br>
prehydrogenated and then separated from linear, saturated alkyl fatty acids or their<br>
esters by solvent fractionation. The order of distillation, prehydrogenation and<br>
fractionation may be changed. Distillation and solvent fractionation steps may<br>
also be at the end of the process after deoxygenation.<br>
The skeletal isomerisation product may optionally be prehydrogenated in order to<br>
remove unsaturation, which may cause formation of coke on the catalyst surface<br>
in the subsequent catalytic steps. The prehydrogenation is carried out in the pres-<br>
ence of a hydrogenation catalyst at a temperature 50 - 400 °C under a hydrogen<br>
pressure of 0.1 - 20 MPa, preferably at 150 - 250 °C and 1 - 10 MPa. The heteroge-<br>
neous hydrogenation catalyst contains one or more Group VIII and/or VIA metals.<br><br>
Preferably the hydrogenation catalyst is Pd-, Pt-, Ni-, NiMo- or CoMo-catalyst on<br>
aluminum and/or silicon oxide support.<br>
In the case where fatty acid esters are used as feedstock in the isomerisation step,<br>
the branched product from skeletal isomerisation may optionally be prehydro-<br>
genated before the final deoxygenation step to saturate the double bonds and to<br>
liberate the lower alcohol used in esterification. Fatty acid alkylesters are con-<br>
verted to fatty alcohols for hydrodeoxygenation. Liberated lower alcohol may be<br>
recycled after distillation. Fatty acid alkylesters are prehydrogenated with metal<br>
catalysts at 25-30 MPa hydrogen pressure and at temperature of 200 - 230 °C. The<br>
metal catalyst is preferably copper-chromite catalyst or chrome, ferrous or rho-<br>
dium activated nickel catalyst<br>
Deoxygenation<br>
The branched product obtained from the skeletal isomerisation step is then sub-<br>
jected to deoxygenation carried out by decarboxylation/decarbonylation or hydro-<br>
deoxygenation.<br>
In the first embodiment, the saturated and branched fatty acids or esters of fatty<br>
acids and optionally a solvent or a mixture of solvents are brought into contact<br>
with a heterogeneous decarboxylation/decarbonylation catalyst selected from sup-<br>
ported catalysts containing one or more Group VIII and/or VIA metals of the Pe-<br>
riodic System. Preferably, the decarboxylation/decarbonylation catalysts are sup-<br>
ported Pd, Pt, Ni, NiMo or a CoMo catalysts, the support being alumina and/or<br>
silica and/or carbon. Particularly preferably Pd on carbon and sulphided NiMo on<br>
alumina are used. Hydrogen may optionally be used. The decarboxyla-<br>
tion/decarbonylation reaction conditions may vary with the feedstock used. The<br>
reaction is carried out in liquid phase. The decarboxylaiion/decarbonylation reac-<br>
tion is carried out at a temperature of 100 - 400 C. preferably 250 - 350 C. The<br>
reaction may be conducted under atmospheric pressure. However, in order to<br><br><br>
than the saturation vapour pressure of the feedstock at a given reaction tempera-<br>
ture and thus the reaction pressure ranges from atmospheric pressure to 20 MPa<br>
and preferably from 0.1 to 5 MPa of inert gas/hydrogen mixture. The product ob-<br>
tained from this embodiment is a mixture of hydrocarbons, preferably branched<br>
paraffins boiling in the range of 180 - 350 °C, the diesel fuel range, and having<br>
one carbon atom less than the original fatty acid chain.<br>
In the second embodiment, in the hydrodeoxygenation step the branched fatty<br>
acids or esters thereof obtained from the skeletal isomerisation step, or the fatty<br>
alcohols obtained by the optional prehydrogenation step, and optionally a solvent<br>
or a mixture of solvents are brought into contact with an optionally pre-treated<br>
heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts containing metals from Group VIII and/or<br>
VTA of the Periodic System, known in the art for hydrodeoxygenation. Preferably,<br>
the hydrodeoxygenation catalysts are supported Pd, Pt, Ni, NiMo or a CoMo cata-<br>
lysts, the support being alumina and/or silica. Particularly preferably NiMo/Al2O3<br>
and CoMo/Al2O3 catalysts are used. In the hydrodeoxygenation step, the pressure<br>
range can be varied between 1 and 20 MPa, preferably 2-10 MPa, and the tem-<br>
perature 200 - 500 °C, preferably 250 - 350 °C.<br>
The optional solvent in each deoxygenation embodiment can be selected from the<br>
group consisting of hydrocarbons, such as paraffins, isoparaffins, naphthenes and<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons in the boiling range of 150 - 350 °C, and recycled process<br>
streams containing hydrocarbons, and mixtures thereof, preferably the recycled<br>
product streams obtained from the process according to the invention are used.<br>
Product<br>
The process according to the invention yields a branched and paraffinic hydrocar-<br>
bon product suitable for diesel fuel pool. The product contains typically some<br>
short carbon-carbon side branches, resulting in an exceptionally low cloud point<br>
and cold filter plugging point but still a good cetane number compared to the<br><br>
products obtained by the known methods. In Table 2 properties of the product<br>
produced with the process according to the invention (1) are compared to those<br>
obtained by processes according to the state of the art (2-6). All products are 100<br>
% (B100) diesel components.<br><br>
The products of Table 2 are prepared as follows:<br>
•	(1) is prepared by the method according to the invention, by skeletal isomeri-<br>
sation and deoxygenation of fatty acids<br>
•	(2) is prepared by hydrodeoxygenation and hydroisomerisation of triglycerides<br>
•	(3) is fatty acid methyl ester prepared by transesterification of rape seed oil<br>
•	(4) is natural gas based diesel fuel nrepared by gas to liquid and hydroisomeri-<br>
sation processes<br>
• (5) and (6) are mineral oil based diesel fuels with different specifications for<br>
use in the arctic conditions<br><br>
The structure of the branched, saturated hydrocarbon product obtained using the<br>
process according to the invention is different from the one obtained for example<br>
when hydroisomerising C16-C22 normal paraffins. In the present case the<br>
branches are mainly in the middle of the long carbon chain, due to the common<br>
ω9 olefinic unsaturation positions responsible of branching. In the hydroisomer-<br>
ised isoparaffins, the branches are mainly near the end of the carbon main chain.<br>
The carbon number of the hydrocarbon product of the invention is C13-C22, typi-<br>
cally C15-C18 and the carbon number in the product can be adjusted by changing<br>
the hydodeoxygenation and/or decarboxylation/decarbonylation reaction condi-<br>
tions.<br>
The branched, saturated hydrocarbon product contains paraffins more than 80 vol-<br>
%, typically more than 99 vol-%.<br>
The branched, saturated hydrocarbon product contains n-paraffins less than 30 wt-<br>
%, typically less than 15 wt-%.<br>
The branched, saturated hydrocarbon product contains aromatics less than 20 vol-<br>
%, typically less than 10 vol-% according to method IP-391.<br>
Biodiesel components also contain 14C-isotope, which can be used as an evidence<br>
of the bio origin of the fuel. The typical 14C content of the branched, saturated<br>
hydrocarbon product is at least 100 % based on radiocarbon content compared to<br>
radiocarbon content of air in the year 1950.<br>
The process according to the invention has several advantages. With the process, a<br>
branched, saturated hydrocarbon product comprising branched chains and suitable<br>
for the diesel fuel pool is obtained from renewable sources. Due to the absence of<br>
unsaturation in the hydrocarbon product, the oxidation stability is good and the<br>
tendency for polymerisation low compared to the conventional fatty acid methyl<br>
ester based bicdiesei compounds.<br><br>
Branching in the paraffinic carbon chain enhances low temperature properties,<br>
such as cloud point, pour point and cold-filter plugging point. The extremely good<br>
low temperature properties make it possible to use the branched, saturated hydro-<br>
carbon product as diesel fuel or diesel fuel component also in arctic fuels.<br>
The branched, saturated hydrocarbon products manufactured according to the in-<br>
vention are designed for use in compression-ignition engines, where air is com-<br>
pressed until it is heated above the auto-ignition temperature of diesel fuel and<br>
then the fuel is injected as a high pressure spray, keeping the fuel-air mix within<br>
the flammable limits of diesel. Because there is no ignition source, the diesel fuel<br>
is required to have a high cetane number and a low auto-ignition temperature.<br>
Due to saturation and long paraffinic chain length, the cetane number of the<br>
branched, saturated hydrocarbon product is high, thus making the product suitable<br>
as cetane number improver. The cetane number gauges the ease with which the<br>
diesel fuel will auto-ignite when compressed. Higher cetane numbers indicate<br>
easier self-ignition and better engine operation.<br>
The high flash point of the branched, saturated hydrocarbon product is important<br>
primarily from a fuel-handling standpoint. In the ethanol/mineral oil diesel or<br>
ethanol/vegetable oil diesel micro-emulsions, the flash point is remarkably lower.<br>
A too low flash point will cause fuel to be a fire hazard, subject to flashing, and<br>
possible continued ignition and explosion. In addition, a low flash point may indi-<br>
cate contamination by more volatile and explosive fuels, such as gasoline.<br>
Because of the natural fatty acid based raw materials, the branched, saturated hy-<br>
drocarbon product contains no sulphur. Thus, in the pretreatment of exhaust gas<br>
the catalysts and particulate filters can easily be adjusted to the sulphur-free hy-<br>
drocarbon compound according to invention. Catalyst poisoning is reduced and<br>
catalyst service lifetime is significantly prolonged.<br><br>
Even though the branched, saturated hydrocarbon product is produced from the<br>
natural tatty acid based raw materials it contains no oxygen, thus the nitrogen ox-<br>
ide (NOx) emissions are much lower than those of conventional biodiesel fuels.<br>
The composition of the branched, saturated hydrocarbon product produced ac-<br>
cording the invention resembles highly those of conventional diesel fuels, thus it<br>
can be used in compression-ignition (diesel) engines with no modifications, which<br>
is not the case with fatty acid methyl ester based bio-diesel compounds.<br>
Further, due to the pure paraffinic composition without any oxygen containing<br>
compounds, no gum is formatted in the fuel delivery systems. Engine parts are not<br>
contaminated by carbon deposits as with fatty acid methyl ester based bio-diesel<br>
compounds.<br>
The branched, saturated hydrocarbon product can be blended at any level with<br>
petroleum diesel and with fatty acid methyl ester based bio-diesel compounds.<br>
The latter may be advantageous if the lubricity of the product needs to be en-<br>
hanced.<br>
Particularly, when the process is carried out using the decarboxyla-<br>
tion/decarbonylation route, consumption of hydrogen is reduced significantly.<br>
Decarboxylation/decarbonylation reactions decrease hydrogen consumption by<br>
20-40 %.<br>
The invention is illustrated in the following examples presenting some preferable<br>
embodiments of the invention. However, it is evident to a person skilled in the art<br>
that the scope of the invention is not meant to be limited to these examples only.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Skeletal isomerisation and deoxygenation of tall oil fatty acid<br>
Distilled tall oil fatty acids were isomerised in a Parr high-pressure reactor with<br>
mordenite type zeolite. Tall oil tatty acids, 5 wt-% of the catalyst and 3 wt-% of<br>
water, calculated of total reaction mixture, were placed in a reactor and air was<br>
removed from the autoclave with purging nitrogen. The mixture was stirred with<br>
300 rpm. The reactor was heated to 280 °C and kept under nitrogen atmosphere of<br>
1.8 MPa for 6 hours. After cooling, the reaction mixture obtained was taken from<br>
the autoclave, and the zeolite was filtered off. The filtrate was distilled under re-<br>
duced pressure to yield monomeric acids.<br>
The monomeric acids thus obtained were placed in an autoclave, and double<br>
bonds were hydrogenated at 150 °C with a catalyst containing 5 wt-% Pd on car-<br>
bon for 3 hours under hydrogen atmosphere of 2 MPa until the reaction was com-<br>
plete. Catalyst amount was 2 wt-% of monomeric acid. Then, the reaction mixture<br>
was cooled, and the catalyst was filtered off.<br>
The obtained crude branched chain fatty acids were subjected to a conventional<br>
solvent fractionation procedure to yield isomerised fatty acids. To the crude<br>
branched chain fatty acids, about 2-fold amount by weight of hexane was added.<br>
After this mixture was cooled to -15 °C, the resulting crystals were filtered off.<br>
Then, the hexane was distilled off from the filtrate to yield purified isomerised<br>
fatty acids.<br>
In the subsequent deoxygenation step carried out by hydrodeoxygenation the<br>
isomerised fatty acids were hydrodeoxygenated in a Parr high-pressure reactor<br>
with dried and presulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst to the corresponding paraffins at<br>
a hydrogen pressure of 3.3 MPa and 340 °C temperature. The amount of catalyst<br>
was 2.5 wt-% of fatty acids.<br><br>
The product was a branched, mainly paraffinic hydrocarbon mixture with the<br>
properties shown in Table II. The color of the product was lightly yellow and it<br>
contained 
batch hydrodeoxygenation.<br>
Example 2<br>
Skeletal isomerisation and deoxygenation of tall oil fatty acids at lower tem-<br>
perature<br>
The distilled tall oil fatty acids were isomerised, the double bonds hydrogenated<br>
and the branched, saturated fatty acids hydrodeoxygenated otherwise as in exam-<br>
ple 1 except that the reactor temperature in the hydrodeoxygenation was lower,<br>
325 °C.<br>
A crystal clear product with properties presented in Table 3 was obtained.<br>
Example 3<br>
Skeletal isomerisation of tall oil fatty acids without water, deoxygenation at<br>
lower temperature and cold filtration of the end product<br>
In the skeletal isomerisation step tall oil tatty acids and 5 wt-% of the mordenite<br>
type zeolite catalyst were mixed and air was removed from the Parr high-pressure<br>
autoclave with purging nitrogen. The mixture was stirred with 300 rpm. The reac-<br>
tor was heated to 275 °C and kept in a nitrogen atmosphere 0.1 MPa for 6 hours.<br>
After cooling, the reaction mixture obtained was taken out from the autoclave, and<br>
the zeolite was filtered off. The filtrate was distilled under reduced pressure to<br>
yield monomeric acids.<br>
The double bonds of the monomeric acids thus obtained were hydrogenated as in<br>
example I.<br><br>
In the deoxygenation step the isomerised fatty acids were hydrodeoxygenated in a<br>
Parr high-pressure reactor with dried and presulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst to<br>
paraffins at a hydrogen pressure of 3.3 MPa and 325 °C temperature. The amount<br>
of catalyst was 2.5 wt-% of fatty acids. The mixture was cooled to -15 °C and the<br>
resulting crystals were filtered off.<br>
The product was a branched, mainly paraffmic hydrocarbon mixture with the<br>
properties shown in Table 3. The color of the product was crystal clear.<br>
Example 4<br>
Skeletal isomerisation of tall oil fatty acids without water and deoxygenation<br>
by decarboxylation/decarbonylation<br>
Tall oil fatty acids were isomerised and prehydrogenated as in example 3. In the<br>
deoxygenation step carried out by decarboxylation/decarbonylation the isomerised<br>
fatty acids were loaded in a Parr high-pressure reactor and the carboxyl groups<br>
were removed with dried and presulphided N1Mo/Al2O3 catalyst.<br>
Isomerised fatty acids were decarboxylated/decarbonylated to paraffins at a gas<br>
pressure of 0.3 MPa and 335 °C temperature. The amount of catalyst was 2.5 wt-<br>
% of fatty acids. The gas consisted of 10 % hydrogen in nitrogen.<br>
The product was a branched, mainly paraffmic hydrocarbon mixture with the car-<br>
bon chain length typically one carbon atom less than in the hydrodeoxygenation<br>
and with the properties shown in Table 3. The color of the product was crystal<br>
clear.<br><br><br><br>
