Unless a sync signal in address information can be reproduced accurately, address data having an ECC appended thereto cannot be reproduced either. In other words, the error rate of address information depends upon whether a sync signal in the address information can be reproduced accurately or not. Therefore, a method of accurately reproducing a sync signal in address signal should desirably be established.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The address recording apparatus according to the present invention is constructed as shown in FIG. 1. When an optical disc is being produced, there is formed on the optical disc 5 a groove G having a spiral form intended for tracking as shown in FIG. 2 and wobbled adaptively to address information as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
As shown, the address recording apparatus according to the present invention includes an address generator 1. The address generator 1 generates address information to be recorded to an optical disc 5 shown in FIG. 2. The address information is binary digital data composed of a sync signal, address data and an error correction code (ECC) for the address data. The address generator 1 converts the address information into a binary signal a(t) and supplies the signal to a modulator 3. Digital data "1" included in the address data is converted into a binary signal a(t) (= 1) while digital data "0" is converted into a binary signal a(t) (= -1). It should be noted that the binary signal a(t) resulted from conversion of address information being binary digital data will also be referred to as "address information a(t)" hereunder.<br>
The address recording apparatus includes also a carrier signal generator 2 to<br><br>
generate a carrier signal x(t) (= cos0(t)) which is to carry the address information, and supplies the signal to a modulator 3 also included in the apparatus.<br>
The modulator 3 is provided to make phase modulation of the carrier signal x(t) by multiplying the address information a(t) supplied from the address generator 1 by the carrier signal x(t) (= cos6(t)) supplied from the carrier signal generator 2 and outputs, to a wobbling unit 4 also included in the apparatus, a phase modulation signal y(t) (= a(t)-cos0(t)) corresponding to resultant address information. Since the address information is a binary signal indicative of "1" or "-1" as mentioned above, the phase modulation signal y(t) is either in phase with the carrier signal x(t), namely, y(t) = x(t) = cos8(t) or in opposite phase to the carrier signal x(t), namely, y(t) = -x(t) = - cos6(t). The wobbling unit 4 forms, on the optical disc 5, a spiral groove wobbled according to the phase modulation signal y(t) supplied from the modulator 3.<br>
The address recording apparatus further includes a controller 6 to control a drive 7 to read a control program from a magnetic disc 8, optica] disc 9, magneto-optical disc 10 or a semiconductor memory 11, and then control the entire address recording apparatus on the basis of the control program thus read.<br>
FIG. 4 shows the configuration of address information recorded correspondingly to a write-read cluster RUB (read unit block) of the optical disc 5. Two pieces of address information (ADIP: address in pre-groove) are recorded in the read-write cluster RUB. Each piece of address information is of 83 bits of which 8 bits are for a sync part (SYNC) indicating a sync signal, and 75 bits are for a data part<br><br>
indicating address data and ECC for the address data.<br>
Information of 1 bit is formed as 42 wobbles (for 42 cycles) on the optical disc 5. One bit for the 42 wobbles is classified into a monotone bit for a succession of in-phase wobbles as shown in FIG. 5A, an ADIP bit, not any monotone bit, (a phase modulation takes in the period of 42 wobbles) as shown in FIG. 5B, etc.<br>
FIG. 6 shows the configuration of a sync part of 8 bits. As shown, the sync part is composed of four sync blocks "1" to "4" each including a monotone bit and a sync bit.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 7A to 7D, a sync bit (for 42 wobbles) is composed of a sync unit for 12 wobbles and a monotone for 30 wobbles (succession of in-phase wobbles). FIGS. 7A to 7D show wobbles for sync blocks "1" to "4", namely, a phase modulation signal y(t). In FIGS. 7Ato 7D and subsequent drawings and description, the upward arrow " I" indicates a wobble for one cycle of the phase modulation signal y(t) (= cos0(t)), and the downward arrow "1" indicates a wobble for one cycle of a phase modulation signal in opposite phase to the carrier signal, that is, a phase modulation signal y(t) (= -cosθ(t)).<br>
The sync unit (for 12 wobbles) in the sync block "1" is formed as a first sync unit pattern ' as shown in FIG. 7A. The sync unit (for 12 wobbles)<br>
in the sync block "2" is formed as a second sync unit pattern ' as<br>
shown in FIG. 7B. The sync unit (for 12 wobbles) in the sync block "3" is formed as a third sync unit pattern as shown in FIG. 7C. The sync unit (for 12<br><br>
wobbles) in the sync block "4" is formed as a fourth sync unit pattern   as shown in FIG. 7D. The 8-bit sync part will include all the above-mentioned first to fourth sync unit patterns. For reproducing address information, when at least one of the first to fourth sync unit patterns can be reproduced, the position of the sync part, that is, the address information, can accurately be determined.<br>
FIG. 8 shows the configuration of the 75-bit data part. As will be seen from FIG. 8, the data part include fifteen ADIP blocks "1" to "15" each composed of a monotone bit and four ADIP bits.<br>
FIG. 9A shows a wobble corresponding to a monotone bit, that is, a phase modulation signal y(t).<br>
FIG. 9B shows a wobble corresponding to one of the four ADIP bits included in one ADIP block, that is, a phase modulation signal y(t); An ADIP bit (for 42 wobbles) corresponding to 1-bit digital data "1" of address data on the address information is composed of an ADIP unit having a first ADIP unit pattern "1 If 1" and a monotone for 38 wobbles next to the ADIP unit. An ADIP bit (for 42 wobbles) corresponding to digital data "0" is composed of an ADIP unit having a second ADIP unit pattern and a monotone for 38 wobbles next to the ADIP unit.<br>
FIG. 10 shows address data and an ECC for the address data. As shown, an ECC (parity) of 32 bits (= 8 nibbles) is added to address data of 28 bits (= 7 nibbles). It should be noted that the 28-bit address data includes a 20-bit RUB number, 2-bit<br><br>
RUB address number, 2-bit information for a multilayer disc and a four reserved bits. The error correction method is the nibble-based Reed-Solomon Coding RS (15, 7, 9).<br>
Referring now to FIG. 11, there is illustrates in the form of a flow chart operations made for recording of address information in the address recording apparatus according to the present invention. The address recording will be described below with reference to FIG. 11.<br>
In step S1 shown in FIG. 11, the address generator 1 geneRates address information which is to be recorded to the optical disc 5 and composed of a sync signal, address data and an ECC for the address data, and converts the address information into a binary signal a(t) and supplies the signal to the modulator 3. At the same time, the carrier signal generator 2 generates a carrier signal x(t) (= cos0(t)) which is to carry the address information, and supplies the signal to the modulator 3,<br>
In step S2, the modulator 3 generates a phase modulation signal y(t) (= a(t).cosθ(t)) corresponding to resultant address information by multiplying the address information a(t) supplied from the address generator 1 by the carrier signal x(t) (= cos0(t)) supplied from the carrier signal generator 2 and supplies it to the wobbling unit 4.<br>
Next in step S3, the wobblingunit 4 forms, on the optical disc 5, a spiral groove wobbled according to the phase modulation signal y(t) supplied from the modulator 3.<br>
With the above address recording operations made by the address recording<br><br>
apparatus according to the present invention, address information having four different sync unit patterns included in a sync signal can be recorded as wobbles of the groove on the optical disc 5.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 12, there is schematically illustrated in the form of a block diagram an example of the construction of the optical disc drive which writes and reads arbitrary data to and from the optical disc 5 having address information written as wobbles of a groove thereon by the address recording apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 12, the optical disc drive includes a control circuit 21 which controls components of the optical disc drive according to a control program recorded in a recording medium 22. More specifically, the control circuit 21 controls the components of the optical disc drive according to a write command supplied from an external AV apparatus or the like (not shown) via an AV interface 23 to write, to the optical disc 5, a mark corresponding to recording data supplied from the AV apparatus. Also, the control circuit 21 controls the optical disc drive components to read a mark recorded in the optical disc 5 according to a read command supplied from the AV apparatus via the AV interface 23, reproduce the recorded data, and supply it to the AV apparatus via the AV interface 23.<br>
The optical disc drive includes also a spindle circuit 24 to control the rotation of a spindle motor 26 according to a command from the control circuit 21, and a servo circuit 25 to cause an optical pickup 27 to seek an address specified by the control<br><br>
circuit 21 and control the focus servo and tracking servo of the optical pickup 27 according to a focus error signal and tracking error signal supplied from an optical head circuit 28. The spindle motor 26 rotates the optical disc 5 under the control of the spindle circuit 24.<br>
The optical pickup 27 consists of a laser output system, return line detecting system, biaxial actuator, etc. For data recording, the optical pickup 27 is controlled by the optical head circuit 28 to radiate laser light to the optical disc 5, thereby forming a mark on the optical disc 5. For data reproduction, the optical pickup 27 radiate laser light onto the optical disc 5, detects return light from the optical disc 5 and generate a corresponding return light signal, and supplies it to the optical head circuit 28.<br>
For data recording, the optical head circuit 28 controls the laser output from the optical pickup 27 correspondingly to a header signal or write-compensated signal supplied from the write-read circuit 29. For data reproduction, the optical head circuit 28 generates an RF signal corresponding to an embossed pit and mark recorded on the optical disc 5 on the basis of the return light signal from the optical pickup 27, and supplies the RF signal to the write-read circuit 29. Further, for data reproduction, the optical head circuit 28 generates a focus error signal and tracking error signal on the basis of the return light signal from the optical pickup 27, and supplies it to the servo circuit 25 which will then generate a pushpull (will be referred to as "pp" hereunder) signal. The pp signal is supplied to a wobbling circuit 32.<br>
For data recording, the write-read circuit 29 is controlled by the control circuit<br><br>
21 to make write compensation of a signal supplied from a modem circuit 30 and supply the compensated signal to the optical head circuit 28. For data reproduction, the write-read circuit 29 converts the RF signal from the optical head circuit 28 into binarized data and supplies the data to the modem circuit 30.<br>
For data recording, the modem circuit 30 is controlled by the control circuit 21 to modulate ECC-added recording data supplied from an error correction circuit 31 and supply the resultant signal to the write-read circuit 29. For data reproduction, the modem circuit 30 demodulates the binarized data supplied from the write-read circuit 29 and supplies the resultant read data to the error correction circuit 31.<br>
For data recording, the error correction circuit 31 is controlled by the control circuit 21 to add ECC to the recording data supplied from the external AV apparatus or the like via the AV interface 23, and supplies the data to the modem circuit 30. For data reproduction, the error correction circuit 31 corrects any error of read data supplied from the modem circuit 30 on the basis of the ECC, and supplies the corrected data to the external AV apparatus or the like via the AV interface 23.<br>
The wobbling circuit 32 generates a wobbling signal (equal to the phase modulation signal y(t)) corresponding to wobbles of a groove on the basis of the pp signal supplied from the optical head circuit 28, recovers the address information a(t) from the wobbling signal y(t), and supplies the recovered information to a address decoder/timing generator (DEC/TG) 33.<br>
The DEC/TG 33 detects the position of a sync part by detecting at least one of<br><br>
the four types of sync unit patterns included in the sync part from the address information a(t) supplied from the wobbling circuit 32, generates an address based on address data and ECC for the address data included in a data part next to the sync unit, and supplies the address to the control circuit 21. Also, the DEC/TG 33 generates a timing signal on the basis of the detected sync part, and supplies the timing signal to various circuits in the optical disc drive via the control circuit 21.<br>
Next, how the wobbling circuit 32 recovers address information from a wobbling signal will be described with reference to the flow chart shown in FIG. 13. The address information recovery is effected for recording arbitrary data to the optical disc 5 and also for reproducing data recorded in the optical disc 5.<br>
In step S11, the wobbling circuit 32 generates a wobbling signal corresponding to wobbles of a groove on the basis of the pp signal supplied from the optical head circuit 28, namely, a phase modulation signal y(t) as shown in FIG. 14A.<br>
In step S12, the wobbling circuit 32 extracts a carrier signal x(t) (= cos0(t)) as shown in FIG. 14B from the phase modulation signal y(t) (= a(t)-cosθ(t)), and multiplies the phase modulation signal y(t) by the carrier signal x(t) to generate a signal z(t).<br>
z(t) = a(t)-cos2θ(t) = a(t)-(cos2θ(t) + l)/2<br>
In step S13, the wobbling circuit 32 removes a high-frequency noise component from the signal z(t) by means of an incorporated Iowpass filter. In step S14, the wobbling circuit 32 binarizes the signal z(t) from which the noise component has been<br><br>
removed to recover address information a(t) as shown in FIG. 14D. With the above operations, the wobbling circuit 32 recovers the address information.<br>
As having been described in the foregoing, the optical disc drive according to the present invention can detect the position of a sync part by detecting at least one of the four types of sync unit patterns included in the sync part. Thus, it is possible to acquire address data and ECG for the address data included in a data part next to the sync part and generate an address from the address data and ECC. So, it is possible to improve the address error rate for reproduction of data and accurately access a given address on the optical disc 5.<br>
In the aforementioned modulator 3 of the address recording apparatus, address information a(t) is subjected to phase modulation and a groove wobbled adaptively to a resultant phase modulation signal is formed on the optical disc 5. However, it should be noted that address information a(t) may be subjected to FM modulation (frequency modulation) and a groove wobbled adaptively to a resultant FM modulation signal may be formed on the optical disc 5.<br>
More particularly, in case the address information a(t) is "1" as shown in FIG. 15 for example, there is generated an FM modulation signal having the same frequency as that of a carrier signal and in phase with the latter. When the address information a(t) is "0", there is an FM modulation signal whose frequency is a half of that of the carrier signal and which is in phase with the latter.<br>
Even in case the FM modulation is used, 1-bit information is classified into a<br><br>
monotone bit for a succession of 42 wobbles whose frequency is the same as that of a carrier signal and which is in phase with the latter, and an ADIP bit or the like which is not any monotone bit and in which an FM modulation takes place in a period of 42 wobbles in carrier frequency units, as shown in FIG. 16.<br>
In the optical disc drive to read the optical disc 5 having formed thereon a groove wobbled adaptively to the FM modulation signal of address information a(t), a wobbling signal to be read is FM demodulated to recover the address information. Note that the present invention may be applied for recording and reproducing address information to and from the optical disc 5 as well as from disc-shaped recording media of all types.<br>
The aforementioned series of operations can be carried out by a hardware, and also by a software. In the latter case, a program forming the software is installed from a recording medium in a computer having dedicated hardware for execution of the program or in a general-purpose personal computer, for example, which can execute various functions by installing a variety of programs.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the recording medium is not only a package medium such as a magnetic disc 8 (including a floppy disc), optical disc 9 (CD-ROM (= compact disc - read-only memory), DVD (digital versatile disc), magneto-optical disc 10 (including mini disc (MD)) or a semiconductor memory 11, distributed to the users for serving the program and having the program recorded therein, but a ROM or hard disc built in a computer in advance and having the program recorded therein.<br><br>
Note that in the present invention, the steps of describing the program to be recorded in a recording medium include, of course, operations made time-serially in the described order of them, and also operations made not time-serially but in parallel or individually.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
