THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"METALLOPROTEINASE INHIBITORS"<br>
AstraZeneca AB, a Swedish company of S-151  85 Sodertalje, Sweden,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to compounds useful in the inhibition of metalloproteinases and in particular to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these, as well as their use.<br>
The compounds of this invention are inhibitors of one or more metalloproteinase enzymes. Metalloproteinases are a superfamily of proteinases (enzymes) whose numbers in recent years have increased dramatically. Based on structural and functional considerations these enzymes have been classified into families and subfamilies as described in N.M. Hooper (1994) FEBS Letters 354:1-6. Examples of metalloproteinases include the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as the collagenases (MMP1, MMP8, MMP13), the gelatinases (MMP2, MMP9), the stromelysins (MMP3, MMP10, MMP11), matrilysin (MMP7), metalloelastase (MMP12), enamelysin (MMP19), the MT-MMPs (MMP14, MMP15, MMP16, MMP17); the reprolysin or adamalysin or MDC family which includes the secretases and sheddases such as TNT converting enzymes (ADAM 10 and TACE); the astacin family which include enzymes such as procollagen processing proteinase (PCP); and other metalloproteinases such as aggrecanase, the endothelin converting enzyme family and the angiotensin converting enzyme family.<br>
Metalloproteinases are believed to be important in a plethora of physiological disease processes mat involve tissue remodelling such as embryonic development, bone formation and uterine remodelling during menstruation. This is based on the ability of the metalloproteinases to cleave a broad range of matrix substrates such as collagen, proteoglycan and fibronectin. Metalloproteinases are also believed to be important in the processing, or secretion, of biological important cell mediators, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF); and the post translational proteolysis processing, or shedding, of biologically important membrane proteins, such as the low affinity IgE receptor CD23 (for a more complete list see N. M. Hooper et al, (1997) Biochem J. 321:265-279).<br>
Metalloproteinases have been associated with many diseases or conditions. Inhibition of the activity of one or more metalloproteinases may well be of benefit in these diseases<br><br>
WO 02/074767<br>
or conditions, for example: various inflammatory and allergic diseases such as, inflammation of the joint (especially rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout), inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract (especially inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and gastritis), inflammation of the skin (especially psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis); in tumour metastasis or invasion; in disease associated with uncontrolled degradation of the extracellular matrix such as osteoarthritis; in bone resorptive disease (such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease); in diseases associated with aberrant angiogenesis; the enhanced collagen remodelling associated with diabetes, periodontal disease (such as gingivitis), corneal ulceration, ulceration of the skin, post-operative conditions (such as colonic anastomosis) and dermal wound healing; demyelinating diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems (such as multiple sclerosis); Alzheimer's disease; extracellular matrix remodelling observed in cardiovascular diseases such as restenosis and atheroscelerosis; asthma; rhinitis; and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD).<br>
MMP12, also known as macrophage elastase or metalloelastase, was initially cloned in the mouse by Shapiro et al [1992, Journal of Biological Chemistry 267: 4664] and in man by the same group in 1995. MMP-12 is preferentially expressed in activated macrophages, and has been shown to be secreted from alveolar macrophages from smokers [Shapiro et al, 1993, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 268: 23824] as well as in foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions [Matsumoto et al, 1998, Am J Pathol 153:109]. A mouse model of COPD is based on challenge of mice with cigarette smoke for six months, two cigarettes a day six days a week. Wildtype mice developed pulmonary emphysema after this treatment. When MMP12 knock-out mice were tested in this model they developed no significant emphysema, strongly indicating that MMP-12 is a key enzyme in the COPD pathogenesis. The role of MMPs such as MMP12 in COPD (emphysema and bronchitis) is discussed in Anderson and Shinagawa, 1999, Current Opinion in Anti-inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Investigational Drugs 1(1): 29-38. It was recently discovered that smoking increases macrophage infiltration and macrophage-derived MMP-12 expression<br><br><br>

in human carotid artery plaques Kangavari [Matetzky S, Fishbein MC et al, Circulation 102.-(18). 36-39 Suppl. S, Oct 31, 2000].<br>
MMP13, or collagenase 3, was initially cloned from a cDNA library derived from a breast tumour [J. M. P. Freije etal. (1994) Journal of Biological Chemistry 269(24):1 6766-16773]. PCR-RNA analysis of RNAs from a wide range of tissues indicated that MMP13 expression was limited to breast carcinomas as it was not found in breast fibroadenomas, normal or resting mammary gland, placenta, liver, ovary, uterus, prostate or parotid gland or in breast cancer cell lines (T47-D, MCF-7 and ZR75-1). Subsequent to this observation MMP13 has been detected in transformed epidermal keratinocytes [N. Johansson et al, (1997) Cell Growth Differ. 8(2):243-250], squamous cell carcinomas [N. Johansson et al, (1997) Am. J. Pathol. 151(2):499-5081 and epidermal tumours [K. Airola et al, (1997) J. Invest. Dermatol. 109(2):225-231], These results are suggestive that MMP13 is secreted by transformed epithelial cells and may be involved in the extracellular matrix degradation and cell-matrix interaction associated with metastasis especially as observed in invasive breast cancer lesions and in malignant epithelia growth in skin carcinogenesis.<br>
Recent published data implies that MMP13 plays a role in the turnover of other connective tissues. For instance, consistent with MMP13's substrate specificity and preference for degrading type II collagen [P. G. Mitchell et al, (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 97(3):761-768: V. Knauper et al, (1996) The Biochemical Journal 271: 1544-1550], MMP13 has been hypothesised to serve a role during primary ossification and skeletal remodelling [M. Stahle-Backdahl et al, (1997) Lab. Invest. 76(51:717-728: N. Johansson et al, (1997) Dev. Dyn. 208(3):387-397], in destructive joint diseases such as rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis [D. Wernicke et al, (1996) J. Rheumatol. 23:590-595; P. G. Mitchell et al, (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 97(3):761-768: O. Lindy et al, (1997) Arthritis Rheum 40(8):1391-1399]; and during the aseptic loosening of hip replacements [S. Imai et al, (1998) J. Bone Joint Surg. Br. 80(41:701-7101. MMP13 has also been implicated in chronic adult periodontitis as it has been localised to the epithelium of chronically inflamed mucosa human gingival tissue [V. J. Uitto et al, (1998) Am. J. Pathol<br><br><br>
WO 02/074767<br>
152(6):1489-1499] and in remodelling of the collagenous matrix in chronic wounds [M. Vaalamo et al., (1997) J. Invest. Dermatol. 109(1):96-101].<br>
MMP9 (Gelatinase B; 92kDa TypeIV Collagenase; 92kDa Gelatinase) is a secreted protein which was first purified, then cloned and sequenced, in 1989 [S.M. Wilhelm et al (1989) J. Biol Chem. 264(29): 17213-17221; published erratum in J. Biol Chem. (1990) 265 (36): 22570].   A recent review of MMP9 provides an excellent source for detailed information and references on this protease: T.H. Vu &amp; 2. Werb (1998) (In : Matrix Metalloproteinases. 1998. Edited by W.C. Parks &amp; R.P. Mecham. pp115 -148. Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-545090-7). The following points are drawn from that review 10       by T.H. Vu &amp; Z. Werb (1998).<br>
The expression of MMP9 is restricted normally to a few cell types, including trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils and macrophages. However, it's expression can be induced in these same cells and in other cell types by several mediators, including exposure of the cells to growth factors or cytokines. These are the same mediators often implicated in initiating an inflammatory response. As with other secreted MMPs, MMP9 is released as an inactive Pro-enzyme which is subsequently cleaved to form the enzymatically active enzyme. The proteases required for this activation in vivo are not known. The balance of active MMP9 versus inactive enzyme is further regulated in vivo by interaction with TIMP-1 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases -1), a naturally-occurring 20     protein. TIMP-1 binds to the C-terminal region of MMP9, leading to inhibition of the catalytic domain of MMP9. The balance of induced expression of ProMMP9, cleavage of Pro- to active MMP9 and the presence of TIMP-1 combine to determine die amount of catalytically active MMP9 which is present at a local site. Proteolytically active MMP9 attacks substrates which include gelatin, elastin, and native Type IV and Type V collagens; it has no activity against native Type I collagen, proteoglycans or laminins.<br>
There has been a growing body of data implicating roles for MMP9 in various physiological and pathological processes. Physiological roles include the invasion of embryonic trophoblasts through the uterine epithelium in the early stages of embryonic<br><br><br>
WO 02/074767<br>
implantation; some role in the growth and development of bones; and migration of inflammatory cells from the vasculature into tissues.<br>
MMP-9 release, measured using enzyme immunoassay, was significantly enhanced in fluids and in AM supernantants from untreated asthmatics compared with those from other populations [Am. J. Resp. Cell &amp; Mol. Biol., Nov 1997, 17(5):583-591]. Also, increased MMP9 expression has been observed in certain other pathological conditions, thereby implicating MMP9 in disease processes such as COPD, arthritis, tumour metastasis, Alzheimer's, Multiple Sclerosis, and plaque rupture in atherosclerosis leading to acute coronary conditions such as Myocardial Infarction.<br>
MMP-8 (collagenase-2, neutrophil collagenase) is a 53 kD enzyme of the matrix metalloproteinase family that is preferentially expressed in neutrophils. Later studies indicate MMP-8 is expressed also in other cells, such as osteoarthritic chondrocytes [Shlopov et al, 1997, Arthritis Rheum, 40:2065]. MMPs produced by neutrophils can cause tissue remodelling, and hence blocking MMP-8 should have a positive effect in fibrotic diseases of for instance the lung, and in degradative diseases like pulmonary emphysema. MMP-8 was also found to be up-regulated in osteoarthritis, indicating that blocking MMP-8 many also be beneficial in this disease.<br>
MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) is a 53 kD enzyme of the matrix metalloproteinase enzyme family. MMP-3 activity has been demonstrated in fibroblasts isolated from inflamed gingiva [Uitto V. J. et al, 1981, J. Periodontal Res., 16:417-424]. and enzyme levels have been correlated to the severity of gum disease [Overall C. M. et al, 1987, J. Periodontal Res., 22:81-88]. MMP-3 is also produced by basal keratinocytes in a variety of chronic ulcers [Saarialho-Kere U. K. et al, 1994, J. Clin. Invest., 94:79-88]. MMP-3 mRNA and protein were detected in basal keratinocytes adjacent to but distal from the wound edge in what probably represents the sites of proliferating epidermis. MMP-3 may thus prevent the epidermis from healing. Several investigators have demonstrated consistent elevation of MMP-3 in synovial fluids from rheumatoid and osteoarthritis patients as compared to controls [Walakovits L. A. et al, 1992, Arthritis Rheum., 35:35-42; Zafarullah M. et al, 1993, J. Rheumatol., 20:693-697]. These studies provided the basis for the belief that an<br><br>
WO 02/074767<br>
inhibitor of MMP-3 will treat diseases involving disruption of extracellular matrix resulting in inflammation due to lymphocytic infiltration, or loss of structural integrity necessary for organ function.<br>
A number of metalloproteinase inhibitors are known (see for example the review of MMP inhibitors by Beckett R.P. and Whittaker M., 1998, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 8(3):25 9-2821. Different classes of compounds may have different degrees of potency and selectivity for inhibiting various metalloproteinases.<br>
Whittaker M. et al (1999, Chemical Reviews 99(9):2735-2776] review a wide range of known MMP inhibitor compounds. They state that an effective MMP inhibitor requires a zinc binding group or ZBG (functional group capable of chelating the active site zinc(II) ion), at least one functional group which provides a hydrogen bond interaction with the enzyme backbone, and one or more side chains which undergo effective van der Waals interactions with the enzyme subsites. Zinc binding groups in known MMP inhibitors include carboxylic acid groups, hydroxamic acid groups, sulfhydryl or mercapto, etc. For 15      example, Whittaker M. et al discuss the following MMP inhibitors:<br><br>
The above compound entered clinical development. It has a mercaptoacyl zinc binding group, a trimethylhydantoinylethyl group at the P1 position and a leucinyl-tert-20     butyllglycinyl backbone.<br><br><br><br>
WO 02/074767<br><br>
The above compound has a mercaptoacyl zinc binding group and an imide group at the P1 position.<br><br>
5     The above compound was developed for the treatment of arthritis. It has a non-peptidic succinyl hydroxamate zinc binding group and a trimethylhydantoinylethyl group at the P1 position.<br><br>
The above compound is a phthalimido derivative that inhibits collagenases. It has a non-o     peptidic succinyl hydroxamate zinc binding group and a cyclic imide group at P1.<br>
Whittaker M. et al also discuss other MMP inhibitors having a P1 cyclic imido group and various zinc binding groups (succinyl hydroxamate, carboxylic acid, thiol group, phosphorous-based group).<br><br><br><br>
WO 02/074767<br><br>
The above compounds appear to be good inhibitors of MMP8 and MMP9 (PCT patent applications W09858925, W09858915). They have a pyrimidin-2,3,4-trione zinc binding group.<br>
The following compounds are not known as MMP inhibitors:-<br><br>
10     Lora-Tamayo, M et al (1968, An. Quim 64(6): 591 -606) describe synthesis of the following compounds as a potential anti-cancer agent:<br><br><br>
WO 02/074767<br>
Czech patent numbers 151744 (19731119) and 152617 (1974022) describe the synthesis and the anticonvulsive activity of the following compounds:<br><br>
US patent number 3529019 (19700915) describes the following compounds used as intermediates:<br><br>
10     PCT patent application number WO 00/09103 describes compounds useful for treating a vision disorder, including the following (compounds 81 and 83, Table A, page 47):<br><br>
We have now discovered a new class of compounds that are inhibitors of 15     metalloproteinases and are of particular interest in inhibiting MMPs such as MMP-12. The compounds are metalloproteinase inhibitors having a metal binding group that is not found in known metalloproteinase inhibitors. In particular, we have discovered compounds that<br><br>
WO 02/074767<br>
are potent MMP12 inhibitors and have desirable activity profiles. The compounds of this invention have beneficial potency, selectivity and/or pharmacokinetic properties.<br>
The metalloproteinase inhibitor compounds of the invention comprise a metal binding group and one or more other functional groups or side chains characterised in that the metal binding group has the formula (k)<br><br>

10	Rl is selected from H, alkyl, haloalkyl;<br>
Any alkyl groups outlined above may be straight chain or branched; any alkyl group outlined above is preferably (Cl-7)alkyl and most preferably (Cl-6)alkyl.<br>
A metalloproteinase inhibitor compound is a compound that inhibits the activity of a 15    metalloproteinase enzyme (for example, an MMP). By way of non-limiting example the inhibitor compound may show IC50s in vitro in the range of 0.1-10000 nanomolar, preferably 0.1-1000 nanomolar.<br>
A metal binding group is a functional group capable of binding the metal ion within the active site of the enzyme. For example, the metal binding group will be a zinc binding 20     group in MMP inhibitors, binding the active site zinc(II) ion. The metal binding group of formula (k) is based on a five-membered ring structure and is preferably a hydantoin group, most preferably a -5 substituted l-H,3-H-imidazolidine-2,4-dione.<br><br><br>

The purified enzyme activity and inhibition thereof is determined by incubating the partially purified enzyme in the presence or absence of test compounds using the substrate 4',5'-Dimethoxy-fluoresceinyl Ser.ProXeu.Ala.GIn.Ala.Val.Arg.Ser.Ser.Ser.Arg.Cys(4-(3-succinimid-l-yl)-fluorescein)-NH2 in assay buffer (50mM Tris HC1, pH 7.4 containing        0.1 % (w/v) Triton X-100 and 2mM CaCl2), at 26°C for 18 hours. The amount of inhibition is determined as for MMP 13 except λex 490nm and λem 530nm were used. The substrate was synthesised as follows. The peptidic part of the substrate was assembled on Fmoc-NH-Rink-MBHA-polysryrene resin either manually or on an automated peptide synthesiser by standard methods involving the use of Fmoc-amino acids and O-benzotriazol-1-yl-       N,N,N',N'-tetramethyiuronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) as coupling agent with at least a 4- or 5-fold excess of Fmoc-amino acid and HBTU. Ser1 and Pro1 were double-coupled. The following side chain protection strategy was employed; Ser1 (But), Gln5(Trityl), Arg8.l2(Pmc or Pbf), Ser9,10'11(Trityl), Cys13(Trityl). Following assembly, the N-terminal Fmoc-protecting group was removed by treating the Fmoc-peptidyl-resin with 30     in DMF. The amino-peptidyl-resin so obtained was acylated by treatment for 1.5-2hr at 70°C with 1.5-2 equivalents of 4',5,-dimethoxy-fluorescein-4(5)-carboxylic acid [Khanna<br><br><br>

The dimethoxyfluoresceinyl-peptide was then simultaneously deprotected and cleaved from the resin by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid containing 5% each of water and triethylsilane.      The dimethoxyfluoresceinyl-peptide was isolated by evaporation, trituration with diethyl ether and filtration. The isolated peptide was reacted with 4-{N-maleimido)-fluorescein in DMF containing diisopropylethylamine, the product purified by RP-HPLC and finally isolated by freeze-drying from aqueous acetic acid. The product was characterised by MALDI-TOF MS and amino acid analysis.<br><br>

Test as an agent to inhibit whole blood TNF sheddase activity<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention to inhibit TNFa production is assessed in a human whole blood assay where LPS is used to stimulate the release of TNFa. Heparinized (l0Units/ml) human blood obtained from volunteers is. diluted 1:5 with medium (RPMI1640 + bicarbonate, penicillin, streptomycin and glutamine) and incubated (160μl) with 20μl of test compound (triplicates), in DMSO or appropriate vehicle, for 30 min at 37°C in a humidified (5%CO2/95%air) incubator, prior to addition of 20ul LPS (E. coli. 0111:B4; final concentration l0μg/ml). Each assay includes controls of diluted blood incubated with medium alone (6 wells/plate) or a known TNFa inhibitor as standard. The plates are then incubated for 6 hours at 37°C (humidified incubator), centrifuged (2000rpm for 10 min; 4°C ), plasma harvested (50-100μl) and stored in 96 well plates at -70°C before subsequent analysis for TNFa concentration by ELISA.<br>

Pharmacodynamic test<br>
To evaluate the clearance properties and bioavailability of the compounds of this invention an ex vivo pharmacodynamic test is employed which utilises the synthetic substrate assays above or alternatively HPLC or Mass spectrometric analysis. This is a generic test which can be used to estimate the clearance rate of compounds across a range of species. Animals (e,g. rats, marmosets) are dosed iv or po with a soluble formulation of compound (such as 20% w/v DMSO, 60% w/v PEG400) and at subsequent time points (e.g. 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, 720, 1220 mins) the blood samples are taken from an<br><br><br>
WO 02/074767<br>
appropriate vessel into 10U heparin. Plasma fractions are obtained following centrifiigation and the plasma proteins precipitated with acetonitrile (80% w/v final concentration). After 30 mins at -20°C the plasma proteins are sedimented by centrifiigation and the supernatant fraction is evaporated to dryness using a Savant speed vac. The sediment is reconstituted in assay buffer and subsequently analysed for compound content using the synthetic substrate assay. Briefly, a compound concentration-response curve is constructed for the compound undergoing evaluation. Serial dilutions of the reconstituted plasma extracts are assessed for activity and the amount of compound present in the original plasma sample is calculated using the concentration-response curve taking into account the total plasma dilution factor.<br>
In vivo assessment<br>
Test as an anti-TNF agent<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention as ex vivo TNFa inhibitors is assessed in the rat. Briefly, groups of male Wistar Alderley Park (AP) rats (180-210g) are dosed with compound (6 rats) or drug vehicle (10 rats) by the appropriate route e.g. peroral (p.o.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), subcutaneous (s.c). Ninety minutes later rats are sacrificed<br>
using a rising concentration of CO2 and bled out via the posterior vena cavae into 5 Units, of sodium heparin/ml blood. Blood samples are immediately placed on ice and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and the harvested plasmas frozen at -20°C for subsequent assay of their effect on TNFa production by LPS-stimulated human blood. The rat plasma samples are thawed and 175μl of each sample are added to a set format pattern in a 96U well plate. Fifty μl of heparinized human blood is then added to each well, mixed and the plate is incubated for 30 min at 37°C (humidified incubator). LPS (25μl; final concentration 10μg/ml) is added to the wells and incubation continued for a further 5.5 hours. Control wells are incubated with 25μl of medium alone. Plates are then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm and 200μl of the supernatants are transferred to a 96 well plate and frozen at -20° C for subsequent analysis of TNF concentration by ELISA.<br>

Piperazine (4 eq) is charged in the reaction vessel as a solid. At room temperature pyridine (1.43 vols) is added to the vessel followed by toluene (2.14 vols). The final slurry is stirred and heated to reflux at 120°C to obtain a complete solution. To a separate vessel charge 2,5-dichloropyridine (DCP) followed by Toluene (1.43 vols) to dissolve the solid. The dissolution is endothermic, and it is necessary to warm up the solution to ~ 30°C to get complete solution. The solution containing DCP is then slowly discharged into the reaction<br>
vessel over 5hours. At this point the remaining amount of DCP should be about 20%. The<br>
reaction is left refluxing overnight to reach completion.<br>
The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, then water is added (6 vols).<br>
The two layers are separated, and the aqueous phase is re-extracted with Toluene (5 vols).<br>
The two organic layers are combined and re-washed with H2O (6 vols). Finally, the organic<br>
layer is washed with brine (6 vols).<br><br>
