Conventionally, in a liquid crystal display device to be mounted in a variety of electric appliances, a bare chip constituting a liquid crystal driver therefor is housed in a package so that the light reaching the bare chip is shielded.<br>
With recent progress of low-profiling and downsizing of a variety of electric appliances, a system of mounting or packaging the liquid crystal driver has been shifted from surface mounting, in which a chip is completely light-shielded by a molding material, to COB {Chip on Board), TCP (Tape Carrier Package) and COG (Chip on Glass) . In these systems , in which a bare chip of the liquid crystal driver is-mounted on a circuit board, the bare chip is susceptible to influence by<br><br>
light .<br>
However, in the liquid crystal display device as described above, in which display is generally made by reflection of light, the bare chip which is not housed in a package ts susceptible to influence by reflected light for display. Then, because of the reflected tight, the liquid crystal driver gives rise to photoelectric effects leading to erroneous display. In addition, mounting the bare chip in a package hinders low-profiling and down-sizing of electric appliances.<br>
The present invention intends to solve the conventional problem as stated above and to provide a liquid crystal display device capable of surely shielding or absorbing light to reach a liquid crystal driver to prevent erroneous display due to the  photoelectric effect of the  liquid  crystal<br>
driver.<br>

The one end of a film carrier 108 Is connected to the upper panel 101 opposite to a mounting area of the liquid crystal driver 107, whereas the other end of the film carrier 108 is folded bacic to the bottom surface of the liquid crystal panel 10. The folding-bacic terminal Is connected to a connector 201 mounted on the circuit board 20. The film carrier 108 consists of a resin film and circuit pattern formed on the resin film, and also act as a heat seal. A light shielding film<br>
109	Is affixed to the upper surface of the upper panel 101 opposite to the mounting area of the liquid crystal driver 107 and a connecting portion of "tbe film carrier 108. The light shielding film 109 Is colored In black In order to enhance the light shielding effect. Silicon resin as a light shielding resin 110 is applied to the bottom surface of the upper panel 101 In order protect the first transparent electrode 106. The silicon resin<br>

liquid crystal driver 107.<br>
A diffusion sheet 40 Is affixed to the top surface of the holder which is opposite to the bottom surface of the liquid crystal display panel. A light diffusion area 401 of the diffusion sheet, opposite to the reflection plate 105 of the liquid display panel 10, is colored In white as shown in Fig. 1. A light absorption area 402, which is located at the outer periphery of the light diffusion area 401 and opposite to the bottom surface of the upper panel. Is colored In black.<br>
Four light sources 202 each being an LEO are mounted on a circuit board 20 so as to face to both sides of the holder 30 so that the light radiated by the light sources 202 are diffused with no luminance variation by the light diffusion area 401 of the diffusion sheet 40 and the liquid crystal display panel 10 Is Illuminated from Its bottom side.<br>
