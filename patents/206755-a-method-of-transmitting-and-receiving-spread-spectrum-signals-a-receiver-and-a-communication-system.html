METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ACHIEVING DATA RATE<br>
VARIABILITY IN ORTHOGONAL SPREAD SPECTRUM<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to cellular and other communication systems, and more particularly, to methods and apparatus for achieving additional data rates in communication systems utilizing code division multiple access (CDMA).<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
When multiple users share a transmission medium, some form of multiplexing is required to provide separable user sub-channels. There are many multiplexing techniques available which simultaneously transmit information signals within the available bandwidth, while still maintaining the quality and intelligibility that are required for a given application. Code division multiple access (CDMA) techniques, for example, transmit multiple information signals on the same channel, and differentiate each user sub-channel by encoding it with a unique spreading code.<br>
Code division multiple access (CDMA) techniques have been employed in many digital wireless communication systems to permit a large number of system users to communicate with one another. Current CDMA networks were designed to carry only voice traffic and exhibit limited data rate variability. CDMA networks, however, must evolve to encompass a variety of multimedia applications, each having potentially different data rates. Thus, CDMA networks will be required to carry information associated with the various multimedia applications at various data rates, corresponding to the requirements of diverse wireless services demanded by customers.<br><br>
Many communication systems utilizing code division multiple access (CDMA) comply with the IS-95 standard, adopted by the Telecommunication Industry Association (TIA). Under the IS-95 standard, a communication system substantially eliminates co-channel interference and improves the bir energy-to-noise density ratio, Ei/N0, on the forward link from a base station or cell site to a mobile receiver unit by modulating the information signals with Walsh orthog:nal function sequences. To produce corresponding orthogonal information signals, these CDMA systems require that the forward link information signals be transmitted in a synchronized manner. A more detailed discussion of the IS-95 standard is provided in "Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System/' Telecommunication Industry Association Doc No. TlA'EIA/IS-95 (1993), incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Current implementations of the IS-95 standard, however, allow only a limited number of data rates. Specifically, the Telecommunication Industry Association has recently adopted a new standard, IS-95B, for increasing'the data rates that may be achieved with CDMA networks. The IS-95B standard, however, only permits data rates that are integer or power-of-two multiples of the basic CDMA rate. While such techniques satisfy the data rate needs of many applications, the utility of CDMA networks could be significantly extended if further data rate variability could be achieved.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Generally, a CDMA communication system offering a near continuum of data rates up to a maximum rate is disclosed. The disclosed CDMA communication system increases the data rate variability, without disturbing the orthogonality between users. An increased number of data rates is obtained by time multiplexing the data rates achievable with conventional CDMA systems to provide additional data<br><br>
rates for various multimedia applications.<br>
In accordance with one feature of the present invention, if a user is assigned a specific orthogonal code sequence, such as a Walsh sequence, which permits a nominal data rate, R, and higher data rates., ;/R, the user can obtain additional desired data rates by time multiplexing the specific orthogonal code set. In this manner, desired bit rates are provided for applications requiring bit rates that are not an integer multiple of the rates provided by conventional "fat pipe1' techniques.<br>
In an illustrative sixteen dimension implementation, if a specific code quadruple, such as the code quadruple (w+u'ic - J, U&gt; - s. Wk ~ 12) (k=0. 1. 2, 3), is assigned to an information source, any rate can be achieved, up to a rate of 4R. Rates R. 2R, 4R and 16R can be achieved by assigning other appropriate code sets to the information source, in a conventional manner. According to a feature of the invention, any desired rate up to 4R is achieved by time multiplexing the codes M;, wkr audxvk. The symbol, Wk", denotes the first /7th of the spread spectrum code u';. (hence, n=2 denotes the first half of the sequence). Thus, the user can achieve any data rate that is a rational scale factor combination of the rates R and 4R.<br>
The transmitter of the present invention achieves a rate conversion to match the appropriate codeword to the appropriate data rate, by employing buffering and reclocking of the data, with time multiplexing of the orthogonal Walsh codes corresponding to the available lower and upper rates. The rate conversion must be synchronized with the selection of the orthogonal Walsh code (corresponding to the lower and upper rates). For example, an application requiring a data rate between 2R and 4R, such as 2.3R, would require multiplexing of the 2R and 4R Walsh codes (wk2 andwk4) to achieve the desired 2.3R rate. If the 2.3R application was assigned the specific code quadruple (wIt w$% w9i \vi3), the sequence w!2 is utilized to achieve a rate of 2R and the sequence Wi   is utilized to achieve a rate of 4R, with an appropriate<br><br>
balance to achieve an overall 2.3R rate, and :he codes w*. \v9i M-;S are excluded from use.<br>

detailed Description<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for modulating a ommunication signal in a code division multiple access (CDMA) environment using<br><br>
orthogonal spread spectrum codes. As discussed tiirther below in conjunction with FIGS. 1 through 3. conventional CDMA spread spectrum modulation techniques with orthogonal codes only permit data rates that are integer or power-of-two multiples of the chip rate. The present invention improves on conventional CDMA spread spectrum modulation techniques by time multiplexing the data rates achievable with conventional CDMA systems to provide additional data rates for various multimedia applications.  In one preferred embodiment, a continuum of data rates are provided.<br>
As previously indicated, it is often desirable to differentiate a number of information signals transmitted on the same carrier frequency with unique orthogonal spread spectrum codes This is typically accomplished by encoding each bit ro be transmitted using a predefined codeword, or pattern, consisting of// "chips" or "signal elements:" In standard antipodal encoding, the predefined codeword may be utilized to represent a value of binary "CT and the inverse of the predefined codeword may be utilized to represent a value of binary "1."  ~<br>
A number of orthogonal spread spectrum codes, consisting of a number of consecutive positive and negative signal elements, such as Walsh codes, have been discovered which have unique properties that optimize the detection of the transmitted information. Under the IS-95 standard for CDMA networks, for example, sixty four different Walsh codewords, w0 through w63, each consisting of sixty four chips, permit 64 different information signals to be transmitted on the same carrier frequency. Since a number of channels are reserved for administration, such as the pilot, synch and paging channels, less than the available sixty four channels typically transmit user information.<br><br><br>
frequency. Thus, as shown in FIG- 1, in order to transmit data on the downlink portion of a conventional CDMA system from one or more information sources, such as sources 101-116, to a plurality of end users, such as end users 181-196, a transmitter 100 encodes each of sixteen data streams. dn through d::\ to be transmitted using one of sixteen different Walsh codewords, uv through wi*. The illustrative Walsh codewords, WQ through u'/:-, are shown in FIG. 2. The encoded signals will then be combined and modulated in a conventional manner, prior to transmission over a transmission medium 130. The transmission medium 130 may be embodied as a conventional or wireless communicatwns network. The modulator may employ a modulation technique, for example, which multiplies the codeword by a sinusoidal carrier wave in order to shift the signal frequency upward to the carrier frequency (not shown). In this manner, the original signal spectrum may be translated into a particular frequency band allocated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or another regulatory body.<br>
Upon receipt of the transmitted signal by the receiver 150, the frequency of the received signal is typically first shifted down (not shown) to the base band by a demodulator, thus returning the signal to its original form prior to modulation. Thereafter, the received signal is passed through a series of filters, such as filters 161-176, that are each matched to the characteristics of the appropriate codeword, w0 through wis. It is noted that the receiver 150 may be associated with all sixteen end users 181 through 196, as shown in FIG. 1. More typically, however, each end user, such as end user 181, will have its own receiver 150. For a more detailed discussion of a prior art CDMA communication system, see U.S. Patent No. 4,901,307, incorporated by reference herein.<br>
For the transmitter 100 shown in FIG. 1, each of the information sources 101-116 transmits at a uniform rate, R, and the symbol duration is equal to the Walsh code<br><br>
duration. Additional data rate variability can be achieved within the implementation shown in FIG. 1, by assigning multiple orthogonal spread spectrum codes, such as Walsh codes, to the same high rate information source, such as the source 101. For example, in order to achieve a transmission rate, such as 3R, for a single source 101, three Walsh codewords (sub-channels) can be assigned to the information source 101. Thus, the set of achievable data rates are integer multiples of the symbol rate. R. As shown in FIG. 3, multicode source 101 will require additional buffering, typically in the form of a serial-to-parallel converter 310. It is noted that the transmitter 100; shown in FIG. 3 can combine any of the sixteen sub-channels associated with the codewords, WQ through wI5, to increase the data rate for a single-information source 101 to a maximum of 16R.<br>
A second well-known method for increasing the transmission rate in a code division multiple access (CDMA) network, commonly referred to as the "fat pipe" method, "punctures" the set of illustrative Walsh codes shown in FIG. 2. As-discussed below, the "fat pipe'1 method achieves data rates that are power-of-two-multiples of the chip rate, without requiring buffering of the multiple rate user. In other words, the achievable data rates are R. 2R, 4R, 8R and 16R (for the illustrative 16 dimensional Walsh codes shown in FIG. 2). Specific code pairs, such as the code pairs (wft w8) or (wIt w9)t are assigned to the double rate users, transmitting at rate 2R. Each double rate user, however, will encode data with only the first half of one of the assigned orthogonal spread spectrum codes. The symbol, wk, denotes the first half of the spread spectrum code wk shown in FIG. 2. Thus, as shown in FIG. 4, for the spread spectrum code pair, (wJt w9) assigned to the information source 410, w/2 is utilized to encode data at a rate of 2R, and w? is excluded from use by all information sources. It is noted that for each pair (wk, \vk. $), \vk.,/ = wki and the second half of the spread spectrum code w* + s is the opposite polarity of the spread spectrum code<br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the transmitter 600 of the present invention achieves a rate conversion by employing buffering and reclocking of the data, with time multiplexing of the orthogonal Walsh codes corresponding to the available lower and upper rates. As discussed further below, the rate conversion must be synchronized with the selection of the orthogonal Walsh code (corresponding to the lower and upper rates). For example, the illustrative 2.3R application would require multiplexing of the 2R and 4R Walsh codes to achieve the desired 2.3R rate. If the 2.3R application was assigned the specific code quadruple (wlt w5, w9, WJS), the sequence wi is utilized to achieve a rate of 4R, and the codes w5t w9i wi3 are excluded from use.<br>
Thus, when the high rate service is requested, by either the mobile terminal (end user) or the base station (information source), the sync channel (or another administration channel) is preferably utilized to coordinate the wireless service. The originating entity.will send a message either requesting or confirming the rate, as well as the particular codes desired. For example, if the mobile terminal requests a channel<br><br>
having a 2.3R rate, the base station will grant or deny the request, and supply the assigned sequences, if available. In one preferred embodiment, the base station will supply the mobile terminal with the assigned sequences, xs well as the amount of data that should be transmitted at each of the lower and upper rates. Thus, the sync channel protocol may consist of a message containing a user identifier (indicating, for example, the mobile terminal), a sequence number (indicating the particular Walsh code, w0 though wI5, to utilize), the number of repetitions. NL and Nu, and the rate exponents, RL and RUs for the lower and upper rates, respectively (such as 2R, 4R, or SR). Thus, from the sequence number and the upper rate, Ru, the mobile terminal knows which other sequences must be excluded.      *   .<br>
The number of repetitions, NL and Nu, is the number of symbols to transmit at each of the lower and upper rates, respectively. The number of repetitions is determined by the following equation:<br><br>
where Rfuui is the desired rate to be achieved and R is the fundamental rate. Thus, to achieve a desired rate of 2.3R, RL = 2 and RH = 4, one solution is NL = 17 and Nu = 6. One method for determining this solution recognizes that 2.3 can ba written as a ratio of the integers 23 and 10. Writing R&amp;ui as this ratio, and using the above equation, leads to a system of linear equations:<br><br><br><br>
FIG. 7 illustrates one implementation of the rate converter 620. Thus, the rate converter 620 includes two buffers 710 and 720. The first buffer 710 fills with data at a constant rate, and the second buffer 720 is read by an asymmetric multiplexer 730 for every (NL + Nu) bits. Thus, for the 2.3R example discussed above, 17 bits (NL) are read out of the buffer 720 at a rate of 2R (RL) and the last 6 bits (Nu) are read out of the buffer 720 at a rate of 4R (Ru). Thus, the clock at the input of the buffer 710 is symmetric (evenly spaced), while the clock at the output of the asymmetric buffer 720 is asymmetric. The clock 630 controls the buffer 720, the asymmetric multiplexer "730 and the selection of the Walsh code by the switch 640 for the multiplier 650.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates one implementation of a receiver 800 in accordance with the present invention. The receiver 800 includes a multiplier 810, which selectively multiplies the received data by the appropriate Walsh code, as selected by a switch 820, an integrate, dump, detect block 830 for determining the received bit polarities, a rate converter 840 and a clock 850. The rate converter 840 operates in a similar manner to the rate converter 620, discussed above in conjunction with FIGS. 6 and 7. The selection of the low rate or upper rate Walsh waveform at the multiplier 810 is<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
