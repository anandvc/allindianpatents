				<td>Description<br>
Arrangement and method for storing measured values, in<br>
particular for monitoring power transmission systems<br>
The invention relates to an arrangement comprising a control<br>
device, a memory device driven by the control device, and at<br>
least two measuring devices which are connected to the control<br>
device and, in a temporally correlated manner in each case at<br>
the same measurement instants, record measured values and<br>
transmit them to the control device.<br>
Arrangements of this type are used for example in the field of<br>
protection technology. They serve for example to detect and<br>
evaluate current and voltage in and on power transmission lines<br>
or in power transmission systems in order to detect<br>
impermissible or hazardous operating states and, if<br>
appropriate, to turn off installation parts as rapidly as<br>
possible, with the aim of keeping damage at a low level or<br>
avoiding it - as far as possible.<br>
Since, in order to establish a fault or a disturbance, in part<br>
not only the respective present measured values but also<br>
moreover temporally preceding, old measured values have to be<br>
taken into account, it is necessary to buffer-store the<br>
measured values at least for a certain time period. With regard<br>
to a subsequent analysis of cases of disturbance, it is usually<br>
desirable here for the storage time period to be as long as<br>
possible and to amount to a number of days, for example.<br>
However, the longer the storage time period, the larger the set<br>
of measured values becomes which has to be managed and the<br>
longer the access times become to individual measured values<br>
which are contained or - described illustratively - hidden<br>
within the set of measured values. Although standard database<br>
systems<br><br>
that are commercially available readily enable even extremely<br>
large volumes of data to be handled, the access times thereof<br>
are usually too long for a use for example in the field of<br>
protection technology for power transmission installations, as<br>
has been ascertained by the inventor, in the case of large sets<br>
of measured values.<br>
Accordingly, the invention is based on the object of specifying<br>
an arrangement which enables a long storage time period and<br>
nevertheless permits a minimal access time to stored measured<br>
values.<br>
Proceeding from an arrangement of the type specified in the<br>
introduction, this object is achieved according to the<br>
invention by means of the characterizing features of claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are specified in<br>
dependent claims.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides for the control device to<br>
be configured in such a way that it stores the measured values<br>
of the at least two measuring devices in the memory device in<br>
the form of a logical matrix having rows and columns, wherein<br>
it assigns to each measuring device an individual column in<br>
which the measured values of the respective measuring device<br>
are stored, wherein a new measured value of each measuring<br>
device is in each case entered into the next row of the<br>
respective column, and wherein the storage of the measured<br>
values of different measuring devices is carried out in a<br>
manner correlated row by row by virtue of the fact that<br>
measured values of different measuring devices which relate to<br>
the same measurement instant are stored in the same row.<br>
An essential advantage of the arrangement according to the<br>
invention can be seen in the fact that stored measured values<br>
can be accessed relatively rapidly. This can be attributed to<br>
the fact<br><br>
that the measured values are stored in a structured manner<br>
based on measurement instants. This is because if an evaluation<br>
module, whether it be a hardware evaluation device or a<br>
software evaluation application, wishes to have recourse to<br>
temporally preceding measured values, then it will generally<br>
not interrogate individual measured values from a wide variety<br>
of measurement instants, but rather measured value sets with<br>
measured values of different measuring devices from a specific<br>
time interval. Since, on account of the structured storage of<br>
the measured values that is provided according to the<br>
invention, all measured values which go back to the same<br>
measurement instant or to a specific measurement time interval<br>
are stored logically directly alongside and beneath one another<br>
in the memory device, for interrogating the measured values it<br>
is not necessary for the entire measured value data set<br>
available to be taken into account and searched; rather, it<br>
suffices for only the relevant memory section to be transmitted<br>
into a buffer memory, for example of the control device, and<br>
for only this relevant memory section to be used further. The<br>
access time to the requested or required measured values is<br>
significantly reduced as a result. In other words, the<br>
invention thus makes use of the insight that in practice, in<br>
particular in the field of protection and control technology,<br>
data records are not interrogated arbitrarily, but rather<br>
usually according to a predetermined pattern relating to the<br>
measurement instants. This forms the starting point of the<br>
invention in that the expected or highly probable interrogation<br>
pattern is already taken into account during the storage of the<br>
data, whereby the subsequent interrogation process is<br>
accelerated.<br>
Preferably, the memory area that is permissible or enabled for<br>
storing the measured values is limited in order to ensure that<br>
other devices such as evaluation modules and the like retain a<br>
sufficient memory area<br><br>
available within the memory device. Accordingly, in accordance<br>
with one preferred configuration of the arrangement, it is<br>
regarded as advantageous if the number of rows in the matrix is<br>
limited to a fixedly predetermined maximum number of rows, and<br>
if the control device, after writing to the last row of each<br>
column of the matrix, jumps back to the first row of the<br>
respective column and enters the respective next measured value<br>
of the respective measuring device into the first row of the<br>
respective column.<br>
Although the measuring devices are intended to and will always<br>
record their measured values at the same instants, such that<br>
these always relate to identical instants, the measured values<br>
will not be able to reach the control device simultaneously.<br>
This is because if one of the measuring devices is arranged<br>
significantly nearer to the control device than another<br>
measuring device, then the measured values of the locally<br>
nearer measuring device will generally arrive at the control<br>
device more rapidly than those of the remote measuring device.<br>
In order to have the effect, in a simple manner and thus<br>
advantageously, that all measured values arriving at the<br>
control device are nevertheless always stored at the correct<br>
matrix location or as a correct matrix element, in accordance<br>
with one preferred configuration of the arrangement it is<br>
provided that the control device is configured in such a way<br>
that it firstly accesses a phasor field, in which has been<br>
entered, for each measuring device and thus for each column of<br>
the matrix, an information item indicating indirectly or<br>
directly that row in which the respective next measured value<br>
is to be entered.<br>
Since the measured values are stored temporally row by row,<br>
storage of the absolute measurement instants or storage of the<br>
times of day of the measured value detection for each measured<br>
value individually is not necessary. Rather, in accordance with<br>
one<br><br>
preferred variant, it suffices if the control device is<br>
configured in such a way that it stores, only for a subset of<br>
the rows but at least for one row of the matrix (e.g. for the<br>
i-th row), in each case an absolute time indication indicating<br>
the measurement instant of the measured values stored in this<br>
row. By way of example, a single absolute time indication is<br>
held for each column of the matrix. The measurement instants tj<br>
of the remaining measured values in other rows of the matrix<br>
can then be determined in a simple manner by multiplying the<br>
difference between the row numbers by the temporal measured<br>
value detection interval and adding the absolute time<br>
indication ZA, for example in accordance with:<br><br>
where Zj denotes the j-th row of the matrix, Zi denotes the<br>
i-th row of the matrix for which the absolute time indication<br>
ZA is stored, T denotes the time period between two successive<br>
measurement instants which is predetermined for the measuring<br>
devices, and f denotes the measurement clock cycle which is<br>
predetermined for the measuring devices.<br>
Preferably, the control device is configured in such a way that<br>
it overwrites the stored absolute time indication in each case<br>
with a new absolute time indication as soon as a measured value<br>
with a more up-to-date measurement instant by comparison with<br>
the stored time indication is entered into the row.<br>
Particularly preferably, the following is entered into a phasor<br>
field in each case column-individually by an indirect or direct<br>
indication: the row, into which the respective next measured<br>
value of the respective column of the matrix or of the<br>
respective measuring device is to be entered, and also an<br>
absolute time<br><br>
indication indicating the measurement instant of the last<br>
entered measured value of the respective column. An indirect<br>
indication should be understood in this context to mean an<br>
indication from which the row and/or the time indication can be<br>
derived: it is thus possible to indicate for example the last<br>
row in which the last measured value was input, or instead the<br>
new row into which a new measured value is to be input.<br>
The invention additionally relates to a method for storing<br>
measured values of at least two measuring devices.<br>
In order, in the case of such a method, to have the effect that<br>
a long storage time period is made possible and a minimal<br>
access time to stored measured values is nevertheless achieved,<br>
the invention provides for the measured values of the measuring<br>
devices to be recorded in a temporally correlated manner and to<br>
be stored in a memory device in the form of a logical matrix<br>
having rows and columns, wherein an individual column is in<br>
each case assigned to each measuring device and the measured<br>
values of the respective measuring device are stored in said<br>
column, wherein a new measured value of each measuring device<br>
is in each case entered into the next row of the respective<br>
column, and wherein the storage of the measured values of<br>
different measuring devices is carried out in a manner<br>
correlated row by row by virtue of the fact that measured<br>
values of different measuring devices which relate to the same<br>
measurement instant are stored in the same row.<br>
With regard to the advantages of the method according to the<br>
invention and with regard to advantageous configurations of the<br>
method, reference should be made to the above explanations in<br>
connection with the arrangement according to the invention.<br><br>
A control device is additionally regarded as invention.<br>
With regard to such a control device, the invention provides for<br>
the control device to be configured in such a way that it stores<br>
the measured values of at least two measuring devices in a memory<br>
device in the form of a logical matrix having rows and columns,<br>
wherein it assigns to each measuring device an individual column<br>
in which the measured values of the respective measuring device<br>
are stored, wherein a new measured value of each measuring device<br>
is in each case entered into the next row of the respective<br>
column, and wherein the storage of the measured values of<br>
different measuring devices is carried out. in a manner correlated<br>
row by row by virtue of the fact that measured values of different<br>
measuring devices which relate to the same measurement instant are<br>
stored in the same row.<br>
With regard to the advantages of the control device according to<br>
the invention and with regard to advantageous configurations of<br>
the control device, reference should be made to the above<br>
explanations in connection with the arrangement according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below on the basis of<br>
exemplary embodiments; in this case, by way of example:<br>
figure 1 shows a first exemplary embodiment of an arrangement in<br>
which evaluation modules are formed by separate<br>
evaluation devices which are realized as hardware and<br>
which are connected to a control device - the method<br>
according to the invention is also explained by way of<br>
example on the basis of this exemplary embodiment -,<br>
figure 2 schematically shows a matrix structure in accordance with<br>
which the measured values of the arrangement in<br>
accordance with figure 1 are stored, and also an<br>
associated phasor field,<br><br>
figure 3 schematically shows the temporal profile of measured<br>
value storage,<br>
figure 4 shows another configuration of a phasor field,<br>
figure 5 shows a further configuration of a phasor field, and<br>
figure 6 shows a second exemplary embodiment of an arrangement<br>
according to the invention in which evaluation<br>
modules of the arrangement are formed by software<br>
applications for a control device.<br>
In figures 1 to 6, the same reference symbols are always used<br>
for identical or comparable components, for reasons of clarity.<br>
Figure 1 reveals a control device 10, which is connected to<br>
three measuring devices PMU1, PMU2 and PMU3 via a data<br>
transmission network 20. The three measuring devices PMU1, PMU2<br>
and PMU3 are so-called phasor measurement units, for example,<br>
which measure current and voltage values of a power<br>
transmission line, which is not illustrated any further in<br>
figure 1, and generate corresponding phasor measured values.<br>
The phasor measured values are transmitted together with the<br>
respective measurement instants ti in the form of data records<br>
Dl, D2 and D3 via the data transmission network 20 to the<br>
control device 10.<br>
It is assumed below by way of example that the measuring device<br>
PMU1 transmits in its data records Dl a voltage phasor measured<br>
value - called voltage phasor for short hereinafter - Vll and<br>
also an associated current phasor measured value - called<br>
current phasor hereinafter - 111 to the control device 10. The<br>
data records D2 of the second measuring device PMU2<br>
respectively contain a voltage phasor V21 and a current phasor<br>
121. The third measuring device PMU3 transmits<br><br>
two voltage phasors V31 and V32 arid a current phasor 131 in its<br>
data records D3.<br>
Two evaluation modules 60 and 70 are connected to the control<br>
device 10, said evaluation modules, as separate evaluation<br>
devices embodied as hardware, being connected to the control<br>
device 10 via electrical connecting lines 80.<br>
Furthermore, a memory device 100 with a database 110, in which<br>
the control device 10 stores the measured values, that is to<br>
say the voltage and current phasors, of the three measuring<br>
devices PMU1, PMU2 and PMU3, is connected to the control device<br>
10.<br>
The arrangement in accordance with figure 1 can be operated as<br>
follows, for example:<br>
The control device 10 evaluates the data records Dl, D2 and D3<br>
received from the three measuring devices PMU1, PMU2 and PMU3<br>
and thus receives the voltage phasors VI1, V21, V31 and V32 and<br>
also the current phasors 111, 121 and 131. Since the data<br>
records Dl, D2 and D3 also in each case contain the respective<br>
measurement instants ti, the control device 10 can also<br>
ascertain the respective measurement instant for each phasor<br>
measured value.<br>
The control device 10 makes the corresponding phasor measured<br>
values available directly to the two evaluation modules 60 and<br>
70, such that the latter can access the corresponding measured<br>
values immediately even before the latter are stored in the<br>
memory device 100; a considerable gain in speed is achieved by<br>
this procedure, namely because the evaluation modules 60 and 70<br>
can already directly process further the present phasor<br>
measured values and do not first<br><br>
have to read out said values from the memory device 100 in a<br>
relatively time-consuming manner.<br>
However, the control device 10 does not only make the phasor<br>
measured values available to the evaluation modules 60 and 70,<br>
but also subsequently stores them in the database 110. In this<br>
case, the storage of the data in the database 110 is effected<br>
in a structured manner. Specifically, all phasor measured<br>
values which relate to the same measurement instant ti are<br>
stored logically in the same row of a memory matrix file -<br>
called matrix for short hereinafter. In this case, the<br>
respective column of the matrix indicates from which of the<br>
measuring devices PMU1, PMU2 or PMU3 the respective measured<br>
value originates. The storage of the matrix is preferably<br>
effected not only logically but also physically in matrix form<br>
in a corresponding memory section.<br>
The structure of the matrix is shown in greater detail in<br>
figure 2 and identified by the reference symbol 200. It can be<br>
seen that the voltage phasors Vll of the measuring device PMU1<br>
are entered in the first column Si of the matrix 200. The<br>
current phasors 111 of the measuring device PMU1 are entered in<br>
the second column S2.<br>
In a corresponding manner, the phasor measured values of the<br>
second measuring device PMU2 are stored in the columns S3 and<br>
S4 and the phasor measured values V31, V32 and 131 of the third<br>
measuring device PMU3 are stored in the columns S5, S6 and S7.<br>
When storing the phasor measured values in the matrix 200 it is<br>
ensured here that all measured values which relate to the same<br>
instant ti are stored in the same row. It can be seen that the<br>
phasor measured values at the instant ti are stored in the i-th<br>
row Zi and the measured values at the instant ti+1<br><br>
are stored in the (i+l)-th row Zi+1. The same correspondingly<br>
holds true for the (i+2)-th instant, which is stored in the row<br>
Zi+2, etc.<br>
Figure 2 furthermore illustrates a one-dimensional phasor field<br>
210, which has exactly the same number of columns as the matrix<br>
200. The fields of the phasor field 210 in each case store, for<br>
each column of the matrix 200, that is to say column-<br>
individually, that row Zj of the matrix 200 in which the<br>
respective next measured value is to be entered. The phasor<br>
field 210 thus makes it possible to ensure that arriving phasor<br>
measured values which relate to different measurement instants<br>
are nevertheless entered at the correct location within the<br>
matrix 200. This will be explained in greater detail below on<br>
the basis of an example:<br>
If it is assumed that the first measuring device PMU1 is<br>
arranged particularly close to the control device 10, then the<br>
phasor measured values Vll and 111 will arrive before the<br>
corresponding phasor measured values of the remaining measuring<br>
devices PMU2 and PMU3. This is shown by way of example in<br>
figure 3, in which the phasor measured values that have<br>
currently arrived are represented by a vertically running bar.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment in accordance with figure 3,<br>
therefore, the phasor measured values Vll and 111 of the first<br>
measuring device PMU1 have already arrived up to the<br>
measurement instant t6.<br>
The third measuring device PMU3 is further away from the<br>
control device 10, such that its phasor measured values V31,<br>
V32 and 131 arrive at the control device 10 somewhat later than<br>
the corresponding phasor measured values of the first measuring<br>
device PMU1. In the example in accordance with figure 3, the<br>
phasor measured values V31, V32 and 131 are present only up to<br>
the instant t5,<br><br>
whereas no phasor measured values have arrived yet at the<br>
control device 10 for the measurement instant t6.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment in accordance with figure 3,	the<br>
second measuring device PMU2 is particularly far away from	the<br>
control device 10, such that phasor measured values V21 and	121<br>
from this measuring device are only present up to	the<br>
measurement instant t4.<br>
In order, despite the temporally offset arrival of the phasor<br>
measurement variables, nevertheless to ensure that each phasor<br>
measured value is always entered at the correct location within<br>
the matrix 200, firstly the phasor field 210 is read.<br>
Consequently, upon arrival of each new phasor measured value,<br>
the control device 10 will firstly look up in the phasor field<br>
210 that row in which the respective next phasor measured value<br>
has to be entered. If new phasor measured values of the first<br>
measuring device PMU1 arrive, for example, then the control<br>
device 10 will ascertain, after the read-out of the phasor<br>
field 210, that the next phasor measured values Vll and 111<br>
have to be entered into the seventh row Z7 since the measured<br>
values relate to the seventh measurement instant t7.<br>
The control device 10 will read the phasor field 210 in a<br>
corresponding manner if new phasor measured values V21 and 121<br>
of the second measuring device PMU2 are received: in this case,<br>
the control device 10 will ascertain that the respective new<br>
phasor measured values have to be stored in the fifth row Z5<br>
since they relate to the fifth measurement instant t5.<br>
New phasor measured values of the third measuring device PMU3<br>
are stored in the sixth row Z6 in a corresponding manner since<br>
they relate to the sixth measurement instant t6.<br><br>
As can be seen in figure 2, the measurement instants tl to t6<br>
as such are not stored in the matrix 200, in order to save<br>
memory space. On account of the matrix structure, such storage<br>
of the measurement instants ti is not necessary either, since<br>
the measured values are stored successively in structured<br>
fashion in the matrix 200. Since only measured values of one<br>
and the same measurement instant ti are respectively stored in<br>
each of the rows Zi, it is possible, namely, to calculate the<br>
measurement instant for all measured values of the matrix 200<br>
if the absolute measurement instant or the absolute time of day<br>
of the recording of the measurement is known for at least one<br>
row and if the measured values of the three measuring devices<br>
PMU1, PMU2 and PMU3 are recorded in a temporally correlated<br>
manner in a predetermined clock cycle or temporally<br>
equidistantly. This will be illustrated on the basis of the<br>
example below:<br>
If the measuring devices PMU1, PMU2 and PMU3 detect a new<br>
measured value in each case every 25 ms, then it is possible to<br>
calculate, for each row of the matrix 200 and hence for each<br>
measured value, the absolute measurement instant tj or the time<br>
of day of the measured value detection, by evaluating the<br>
respective row value in accordance with:<br>
tj = (Zj-Zi) * T + ZA<br>
tj = (Zj-Zi) * 25ms + ZA<br>
where Zj denotes the j-th row of the matrix, Zi denotes the<br>
i-th row of the matrix, T denotes the time period of 25 ms<br>
between two successive measurement instants which is<br>
predetermined for the measuring devices PMU1, PMU2 and PMU3,<br>
and ZA denotes the stored absolute measurement instant.<br>
As a result it can be established that the arrangement in<br>
accordance with figure 1 enables the data records Dl to D3 to<br>
be processed<br><br>
very rapidly because the control device 10 on the one hand<br>
makes the phasor measured values available immediately to the<br>
evaluation modules 60 and 70 in order to enable rapid or near-<br>
instantaneous evaluation, and on the other hand performs the<br>
storage of the phasor measured values in matrix form in the<br>
memory device 100, thereby enabling rapid access to all<br>
measured values which were recorded in the same measurement<br>
time period. As a result of the blockwise or bundled storage of<br>
temporally interrelated measured values within the matrix 200<br>
it is possible, namely, for a database interrogation, to copy<br>
the relevant section of the database or the relevant section of<br>
the matrix into a buffer memory, implemented in the control<br>
device 10, for example, in order to enable a rapid access to<br>
all the phasor measured values lying in the area relevant to<br>
the respective evaluation. Consequently, it is not necessary to<br>
open the entire database 110 or the entire matrix 200, but<br>
rather only parts of the database 110 or parts of the matrix,<br>
whereby access to the respectively desired data records or<br>
phasor measured values is significantly accelerated.<br>
If the measured values in the database were not distributed in<br>
matrix form but rather arbitrarily, then the entire database<br>
would have to be accessed, which would involve a very high<br>
outlay in the case of a large database; this is shown by the<br>
following numerical example: if, by way of example, the<br>
measured values are intended to be stored in a 10-bit format<br>
and the measured values from 1000 measuring devices are<br>
intended to be detected every 100 ms and kept for 30 days, this<br>
results in a file size of 2.59 TB. If the measured values were<br>
distributed in unstructured fashion in this file, then the<br>
entire file would have to be taken into account in the context<br>
of an evaluation, which would necessitate a considerable buffer<br>
memory and also a considerable read-out time. On account of the<br>
measured values being stored logically in matrix form, however,<br><br>
it is known precisely in which file section the measured values<br>
from a relevant time segment will be found, such that only this<br>
relatively small file section of interest has to be copied into<br>
a buffer memory and evaluated.<br>
As a result of the measured values being stored in matrix form,<br>
it is furthermore possible to achieve a very simple limitation<br>
of the file size or the size of the database 110, by carrying<br>
out a "ring-shaped" storage: this means that when a maximum row<br>
number is reached, the system begins again with the first row<br>
of the matrix 200 in accordance with figure 2 and the old<br>
content stored therein is overwritten. Consequently, the<br>
storage of the measured values is effected cyclically, the<br>
measured values of each preceding measurement cycle being<br>
overwritten by the measured values of the respective present<br>
measurement cycle.<br>
During an overwriting of old data, the function of the phasor<br>
field 210 consists, moreover, in indicating that row of the<br>
matrix 200 up to which the measured values are up-to-date or<br>
belong to the present cycle and that row of the matrix starting<br>
from which the measured values of the preceding cycle are<br>
stored.<br>
With regard to simple monitoring as to whether or not measured<br>
values of a measurement instant have already been stored, in<br>
accordance with an alternative configuration of the phasor<br>
field 210, the instant of the last measured value can also be<br>
stored alongside the present row number; this is shown by way<br>
of example in figure 4: it can be seen that the instant of the<br>
last entered measured value is also indicated alongside the row<br>
number for the next measured value.<br><br>
The data can be stored in a one-dimensional phasor field, as is<br>
shown in figures 2 and 4; as an alternative, it is also<br>
possible to use a two- or multidimensional phasor field, as<br>
shown by way of example in figure 5.<br>
A second exemplary embodiment of an arrangement is shown in<br>
figure 6. In this exemplary embodiment, the two evaluation<br>
modules 60 and 7 0 are not embodied as separate components, but<br>
rather as software modules or software applications which are<br>
executable on a processor unit 10' in the control device 10.<br>
For the function of these software modules it is unimportant<br>
where they are physically stored; by way of example, they can<br>
be stored within the control device 10, in a separate memory<br>
area of the memory device 100 or in any other memory in the<br>
arrangement.<br><br>
