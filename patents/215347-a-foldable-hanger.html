				<td>The present invention relates to a foldable hanger.<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The invention has generally to do with clothes hangers, particularly with clothes hangers for use in conjunction with luggage cases. Background Art:<br>
Hangers for clothes and garments have been manufactured for centuries. While over time there have been some alterations in composition and material (e.g., the change from wood to plastic-coated wire), the commonly encountered clothes hanger has remained mostly unchanged in form and utility for decades. Modern lifestyles have encouraged the development of collapsible and/or foldable hangers. The object of most foldable hangers has been to provide a hanger that is reduced in size for storage when not in use.<br>
For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,098 to Tung discloses a hanger device that is foldable about two axes in order to reduce its size to promote portability. No provision is made to allow use of the hanger while in the folded configuration.<br>
Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5, 085, 357 to Chen teaches a collapsible garment hanger which occupies little space for storage, but offers little utility while in the folded configuration.<br>
As people generally have been traveling more and more, especially for business reasons, it has become the practice to provide luggage cases in which hangers may be removably placed to allow easy clothes packing from closet to suitcase. U.S. Pat. No. 2,001,156 to Ritter, Jr., for instance, teaches a hanger that is useable in a suitcase as well as upon a closet clothes rod. It is increasingly desirable to provide luggage cases which are small enough to be "carried on" and stowed aboard modern aircraft, and yet will accommodate formal business attire without undue wrinkling. Compact, wrinkle-free luggage packing may be promoted by hanging clothes in a folded condition within a luggage case.<br>
Hangers have been proposed which may be used while in the folded position, for example the device shown in U.S. Pat. No. 920,894 to Bonsall. Such devices often have been less than satisfactory because their use frequently is limited to suit coats and shirts, and the garments are prone to slide off the folded hanger.<br><br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,186,858 to Tatematsu discloses a flexible hanger that is bendable to hang a suit coat in a folded manner. The flexible hanger does not accommodate pants or slacks thereon and, as disclosed, is not useable upon an ordinary closet clothes rod.<br>
Despite the foregoing, a need remains for a hanger that securely holds clothing, including pants, in an orderly folded position within a luggage case, and yet may be used as well to hang the clothes upon an ordinary closet clothes rod. The following claimed invention was developed to satisfy this unmet need.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention includes a foldable hanger and an innovative trolley for removably attaching the hanger within a luggage case. The hanger broadly comprises to halves connected by a generally vertical hinge, permitting the halves to be folded between an open coplanar position, and a closed, juxtaposed, overlapping position. The hanger may be used, with clothing thereon, in either the open position or the closed position. A hook has a hinged connection to one of the halves for pivotal movement between a retracted position and an extended position. The hook serves the dual functions of: (1) when in the extended position, allowing the hanger to be suspended from an ordinary clothes closet rod; and (2) when in the retracted position, preventing a garment from sliding off the hanger when the hanger is in the closed position. An optional slidable pant loop permits the hanger to carry pants regardless of whether the hanger is in the open or closed position. A trolley assembly mounted within a luggage case permits the hanger in the folded position to be removably attached within the luggage case despite the retracted position of the hook.<br>
â€¢ use in<br>
A primary object of the invention is to provide a hanger which can be folded for use in hanging vertically folded clothing within a tall, narrow compartment, and unfolded for hanging unfolded clothing upon a conventional clothes hanger rod.<br>
A primary advantage of the invention is that an effective means is provided for preventing folded clothing from sliding off the folded hanger.<br><br>
Another advantage of the invention is that a means is provided for suspending pants from a folding hanger without interfering with the foldability of the hanger or its balance when used in the unfolded position.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a hanger upon which a garment may be hanged, the hanger comprising a first central body member pivotally connected to a second central body member, whereby the central body members are pivotable between a generally coplanar position and a juxtaposed position, and a hook pivotally connected to one of the central body members for pivotal movement between an extended position substantially coplanar with the one body member and a retracted position substantially parallel with the one central body member, whereby the hook is disposable between the two central body members in the juxtaposed position. The hook is movable from the extended position to the retracted position for engagement against the garment, and the central body members are pivotable from the coplanar position to the juxtaposed position while the hook is engaged against the garment. In one preferred embodiment, when the central body members are in the coplanar position, the first central body member overlaps a portion of the second central body member, one of the body members having at least one aperture therein and the other one of the central body members comprising at least one tab extending therefrom insertable through the aperture to secure the overlapping relation. The hanger optionally is provided with a loop holder upon one of the central body members, with a pant loop slidably disposed in the loop holder. The pant loop is movable between a central position and an offset position upon the hanger.<br>
Also according to the present invention, there is provided an improved means for removably securing clothing within luggage, including a hanger comprising a first central body member pivotally connected to a second central body member, whereby the central body members are pivotable between a generally coplanar position and a juxtaposed position and a hook pivotally connected to one of the central body members for pivotal movement between an extended position substantially coplanar with the one of the body members and a retracted position substantially parallel with the one central body member, whereby the hook is disposable between the two central body members in the juxtaposed position; and a trolley within the enclosed space for removably attaching the hanger to the luggage. In one embodiment, the<br><br>
hanger further comprises a first support arm extending from a respective one of the central body members. The hanger may have at least one aperture therein, where the trolley means for attaching comprises a rod insertable through the aperture. More preferably, a first support arm has a pair of spaced-apart apertures therein, and the trolley means for attaching comprises two spaced-apart horizontal rods insertable through the apertures. There optionally is provided a second support arm extending from the other one of the central body members, the second support member having a pair of spaced-apart apertures therein, the apertures in said first support arm being alignable with the apertures in the second support arm when the central body members are in the juxtaposed position, each of the two spaced-apart horizontal rods insertable through respective aligned apertures in the first support arm and the second support arm.<br>
Other objects, advantages and novel features, and further scope of the applicability of the present invention will be set forth in part in the detailed description to follow, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a foldable hanger for clothes and garments comprising first and second central body members pivotally connected to each other being pivotable between an open coplanar position and a closed juxtaposed position, shoulder members respectively extending from the central body members and hanger hook pivotally connected to one of said central body members for pivotal movement between an extended position coplanar with one of said central body members and a retracted position parallel with one of 'said central body members wherein said hanger hook is positioned between said central body members in said juxtaposed position.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT (BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION)<br>
The invention finds particularly beneficial use in luggage, although it will be apparent that the invention may find practical application in any situation where a simple, reliable, foldable hanger is desired (e.g. in narrow lockers or closets). In this specification and in the claims, the terms "luggage," "luggage case," "suitcase" or "case" shall mean luggage generically, and include vertical or "upright" cases, pullman suitcases, garment bags and the like, whether wheeled or not. For purposes of illustration but not by way of limitation, the invention shall be described with reference to a wheeled vertical case 20, shown generally in Figs. 1 and 2. It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, however, that aspects of the invention are<br>
applicable to a wide variety of luggage apparatus. Case 20 is depicted as an upright, generally rectangular prismatic container having a bottom, four sides, and a top defining an enclosed space wherein items of clothing and other personal articles may be organized and stowed for transport. Case 20 may be composed of any materials known in the art, and may be hard-sided plastic, but is illustrated as a "soft sided" luggage manufactured from nylon or other durable fabric disposed upon a lightweight frame.<br>
Fig. 3 further shows that case 20 may have a front section 22 and rear section 24. Front section 22 is flexibly joined to rear section 24 along a common edge, as by a fabric hinge or the like, so that front section 22 may be swung or pivoted out from rear section 24 in a door- or lid-like fashion to allow convenient access to the interior. To close the case 20, front section 22 and rear section 24 are aligned and secured together (e.g. by a zipper) along their common periphery. Figs. 1-3 illustrate that front section 22 may include one or more pocket storage compartments 26,28 which may be accessible only from the outside of bag 20 while the bag is closed (Figs. 1 and 2), or only from the inside while the bag is open (Fig. 3), or from both outside and inside. Figures 1-3 also show that the case 20 may be equipped with two or more wheels and skids in accordance with known art, to allow case 20 to be tipped and towed across a supporting surface by the user, or to allow the case to rest steadily in an upright position as shown in the figures. The case 20 also is provided with one or more conventional carry and/or wheel handles.<br>
An advantage of the invention is that the interior compartment of the case 20 may be, from side-to-side, narrower than usual in the art. This narrowed dimension is achieved without sacrificing substantial contained volume. Clothing, e.g. a man's suit coat, is folded about a vertical axis for placement within the case 20, as shown in Fig. 3, allowing the case to be narrower in width and thus more easily manipulated, stored, and towed. The compartment within the rear section 24 of the case preferably is sufficiently tall to accommodate the hanging placement of a man's suit coat therein without need for horizontal folding. Nevertheless, in other luggage types, such as garment bags, the garments may be folded again medially to fit into a shorter compartment height. As seen in Fig. 3, the innovative mode of folding and hanging clothing 32,33 is possible through the use of an inventive trolley assembly 38 and hanger 40, which are mountable within the upper interior of the rear section 24 of wardrobe case 20. The<br>
trolley assembly 38 and hanger 40 together function as a means for removably securing clothing within the enclosed space of the case 20.<br>
Attention is invited to Figs. 4-12, which collectively illustrate the folding hanger aspect of the invention. The folding hanger, generally depicted at 40, preferably is composed of a durable, slightly flexible thermoplastic. Hanger 40 has a pair of rigid, generally planar central body members 44,45 from each of which a respective one of legs 50,51 extends laterally. Shoulder members 46,47 extend in an angle downward from the upper portion of each of the central body members 44, 45 to intersect with respectively associated legs 50, 51. Shoulder members 46, 47 and legs 50, 51 preferably are integrated with their respective central body members 44,45 so that each of shoulder members 46, 47 and legs 50, 51 is a rigid molded extension of its corresponding body member 44 or 45. The distal end of each shoulder member similarly is integrally molded with the distal end of an associated shoulder member.<br>
As indicated in Figs. 6-9, the body members 44, 45 are pivotally joined by a preferably vertically disposed body hinge 54. Body hinge 54, whose knuckles preferably are integrally molded with the body members 44,45, permits one body member 45 to pivot with respect to the other body member 44, as indicated by the directional arrow of Fig. 9, so that the entire hanger 40 may be folded about a vertical axis to juxtapose the shoulder members 46, 47 and legs 50, 51, as indicated in Figs. 8, 9 (phantom lines). In the preferred embodiment, the body hinge 54 is a conventional pin-and-knuckles arrangement, but it is immediately appreciated that alternative hinge forms, such as a flexible fabric or plastic living hinge, may suffice in the invention. Moreover, alternative embodiments of the invention may employ a main body hinge 54 that is disposed non-vertically to join pivotally the central body members 44, 45. Accordingly, the hanger 40 preferably is foldable about a vertical axis between an open position in which the central body members 44,45, shoulders 46,47, and legs 50,51 are all substantially coplanar, as seen in Figs. 5, 7, and 9, and a folded or closed position in which the body members 44,45, and their respective shoulders and legs, are mutually parallel or nearly parallel, as suggested in Figs. 4,12, and 13, and shown in phantom lines in Fig. 9.<br>
As best seen in Figs. 4, 5, 7 and 8, one central body member 44 preferably but not necessarily is more extensive in size than the other body member 45. The smaller member 45,<br>
preferably fashioned in the shape of a right-angled triangle, has hinge 54 disposed upon its vertical edge, forming a right angle with the bottom of the body member 45. The larger body member 44, preferably fashioned in the shape of an isosceles or equilateral triangle, so that the larger body member 44 essentially is twice as large as, and a double reflection of, the smaller member 45. The body hinge 54 preferably is disposed along the vertical axis of symmetry of the larger body member 44, so that the smaller body member 45 is pivotable from an overlapping position substantially coextensive with a half of the larger member 45.<br>
An advantage of this preferred configuration is the congruent overlap provided between the smaller member 45 and one half of the larger member 44 when the hanger 40 is folded to the open position. This overlap preferably is secured by means of one or more snap tabs 58,58' distending from one of the body members (member 44 in the illustrations), for snap or frictional engagement into corresponding apertures 59, 59' through the other body member (member 45 as illustrated). A preferred and fully functional embodiment may include a single centrally located tab insertable through a single corresponding aperture, but the use of paired apertures and tabs as shown in the drawings provides a doubly secure snapped connection. As shown in Fig. 8, the tabs 58, 58' preferably are disposed along an edge of the larger member 44 while the apertures 59, 59' are along the hypotenuse of the smaller body 45. When the members 44, 45 are pivoted to the coplanar fully open position, the snap tabs 58, 58' snap into place within apertures 59, 59' to reliably hold the smaller body member 45 in a flush overlap against the larger member 45. This snap-secured, overlapping configuration provides a strong, generally inflexible, hanger that reliably bears weight, and which is resistant to inadvertent or accidental folding or collapse. When it is desired to fold the hanger 40 to the closed position, the smaller member 45 is firmly pulled away from the larger central body member 44 to pull the tabs 58, 58' back through the apertures 59, 59' to disengage the overlapped connection.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5-8, a hanger hook 60 is pivotally connected to central body member 44 by means of a neck hinge 62. Neck hinge 62 permits hanger hook 60 to be folded between an extended position as shown in Figs. 5 and 8, and a retracted position as shown in Fig. 7. In the extended position, the hanger hook 60 is substantially coplanar with the body member 44 . When pivoted to the retracted position, as indicated by the directional arrows of<br>
Fig. 6, the hanger hook 60 is generally parallel to the body member 44. In practice, when the hanger 40 is in the open position to hang a garment thereon, the hook 60 and central body members 44, 45 are generally contained within the same imaginary plane. When the hanger 40 is in the folded position, the body members 44, 45 are approximately parallel, with the hook 60 sandwiched parallel between them (Figs. 12 and 13).<br>
Hanger hook 60 preferably is composed of the same material as body members 44, 45 and is configured with a semicircular inside surface 63 engageable with a circular or other horizontal rod to allow the entire hanger 40 to be hung upon a conventional clothes closet bar 30, clothes rack rod, or the like, as indicated in Fig. 5. Thus, by means of hanger hook 60, hanger 40, may be used to hang an item of clothing in a standard closet. The hanger 40 is best used in the open, unfolded position to hang garments in a normal closet, but may less satisfactorily by used in the folded position with the hanger hook 60 extended for use upon the clothes rod 30.<br>
Fig. 5, 7, and 8 show that from the top of at least one, and preferably both, of body members 44,45 extend support arms 65, 66, which like shoulder members 46,47, are bilaterally symmetrical about a vertical axis. Also like each of shoulder members 46, 47, each support arm 65, 66 preferably is integrated with a corresponding one of central body members 44, 45 so that each support arm is a rigid extension of its corresponding body member. Each support arm 65, 66 preferably is completely pierced by at least one, and preferably by two, trolley apertures 68,68' and 69,69'. Trolley apertures 68,68', 69,69' are holes of a shape corresponding to the cross sectional shape of trolley rods 82,82' (Fig. 4), preferably round, which holes penetrate each of support arms 65,66 near each of the horizontal ends of arms 65, 66. Support arms 65, 66 and apertures 68,68', 69, 69' permit the hanger 40 to be secured placed within a luggage case as further described herein. As best illustrated by Fig. 4, trolley apertures 68,68', 69, 69' are separated by a distance substantially equal to the distance between trolley rods 82, 82'.<br>
Thus, while hanger 40 is useable to hang an unfolded garment upon a standard clothes rod 30, the hanger is specially adapted to hang inside a luggage case upon an innovative trolley assembly 38 when in the closed position, as shown generally in Figs. 3 and 4. Trolley<br><br>
assembly 38 is mounted in the upper portion of the rear section 24 of the case 20. A folded garment 32 may be reliably retained upon the hanger 40 and the hanger 40 securely but removably attached to the case 20 by means of the trolley assembly. The folded garment 32 thus may be packed within the case with ease, security, and minimal wrinkling.<br>
Reference is made to Fig. 4. In one embodiment, the trolley assembly 38 includes a pair of horizontal, spaced-apart trolley rods 82, 82'. Disposed immediately above and parallel to the trolley rods 82,82' are a corresponding pair of latch rods 84, 84' mounting a respective pair of slotted swing latches 86, 86'. Swing latches 86, 86' may be fixed in their respective positions upon the lengths of latch rods 84,84' or alternatively may be slidably movable along latch rods 84, 84' for adjustably securable positioning at various positions along the lengths of the rods 84,84'. The latches 86, 86' swing or rotate about horizontal axes. The latches 86,86' are manually pivotable between an open position (latch 84' Fig. 4) and a closed position (latch 84 in the figure).<br>
As Figs. 3 and 4 indicate, the hanger 40 is removably mountable upon the trolley rods 82, 82'. Swing latches 86, 86', when both in the open position, permit the hanger 40 to be slipped into position upon the trolley rods 82,82'. With the hanger 40 upon the trolley rods 82,82', the latches 86, 86' are swung down into the closed position. When latches 86, 86' are in the closed position, the adjacent trolley rod 82 extends through the slot in the latch, so that the latch (latch 86 in Fig. 4) effectively encircles or encompasses the trolley rod 82 to prevent the hanger from sliding off the end of the rod 82.<br>
Accordingly, when hanger 40 has been folded back upon itself to the closed position, as shown in Figs. 4, 9 (phantom lines) and 12, the corresponding pairs of apertures 68, 68', 69, 69' are co-aligned, and rods 82, 82' are alignable with and insertable through all the apertures. The engagement of hanger 40 upon trolley rods 82,82', by slidably inserting trolley rods 82,82' through trolley apertures 68, 68', 69, 69' in both support arms 65, 66', allows hanger 40 to be removably mounted within case 30 in a secure horizontal position. Hanger hook 60 is folded into the retracted position to allow unimpeded use of the support arms 65,66 to engage hanger 40 upon trolley rods 82,82'.<br><br>
Particular reference to Figs. 10-12 shows that an advantage of the invention is that neck hinge 62 permits hanger hook 60 to be folded down against an article of clothing 32 to hold the clothing in place upon hanger 40. The garment is first placed upon the shoulder members 46,47 of hanger 40 generally according to convention, as shown in Fig. 10. Hanger hook 60 is pivoted to the retracted position, and folded against the garment, to sandwich the garment between hook 60 and the body member 44, as depicted in Fig. 11. Notably, and as best shown in Fig. 11, an outside surface 64 of the hanger hook 60 is shaped so as to be substantially vertical when the hanger hook 60 is in the retracted position. Thus, when the hanger hook 60 is retracted, the outside surface 64 preferably is substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the body hinge 54, engaged against the garment 32, and parallel to the vertical line about which the garment is folded. The hanger 40 may then be folded about body hinge 54, with hanger hook 60 disposed between portions of the garment and also sandwiched between the body members 44,45, so that the folded hanger and garment assume the position shown in Fig. 12. With the hanger 40 so folded, the article of clothing disposed thereon also is folded vertically. With the hanger 40 and the garment in a folded position, and the hanger hook 60 in the retracted position, the outside surface 64 of the hook 60 is engaged against the garment 32 to hold the garment upon the folded hanger; the hook prevents the garment from sliding down and off the shoulder members 46,47 (i.e. from sliding down and to the right in Fig. 12). Advantageously, the garment is maintained upon the overlapping shoulder members 46,47 in the position shown in Fig. 4. The garment 32 and hanger 40 may then be placed upon trolley rods 82, 82' as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Attention is invited to Figs. 5 and 7, showing that the hanger 40 optionally is provided with a pant loop 70 upon which ties, pants, skirts, or other garments may be placed. In one alternative embodiment, pant loop 70 comprises a substantially closed, elongated, loop of, for example, rigid plastic or heavy gage wire, the loop being sufficiently wide to receive a pair of pants 33 therethrough (Fig. 4). The loop 70 is slidably disposed within loop holder 73. Loop holder 73 includes a grooved, or preferably substantially tubular, member affixed to the bottom of the larger central body member 44 and to the bottom of the respective leg 50. As best seen in Fig. 5, the upper portion of the loop 70 is retained within the channel or groove of the loop holder 73, but is slidable therein to allow the loop 70 to move side-to-side with respect to the<br><br>
hanger 40. The pant loop 70 thus is movable between an offset position substantially adjacent to one of the central body members 44 and/or one of the legs 50 (solid lines in Fig. 5) and a central position substantially adjacent to both body members 44, 45 or legs 50, 51 (phantom lines in Fig. 5). The bottom portion of the pant loop 70 is provided with a substantially cylindrical pad member 76 which has a larger radius than the loop 70 to offer a clean, padded surface upon which a garment may securely drape with minimal wrinkling.<br>
Notably, the provision of the pant loop 70 as so configured does not interfere with the folding operation of the hanger 40. When the hanger 40 is in the open position, the pant loop 70 may be moved within the holder 73 to a central position, as shown in Fig. 7 and by the phantom lines of Fig. 5, where a portion of the loop 70 is subjacent to both the legs 50, 51. In the central position, the pant loop 70 is in a substantially symmetric position with respect to the balancing point of the hanger 40 which allows the hanger 40 to hang evenly from the rod 30 shown in Fig. 5. Thus, in the central position the pant loop 70 does not detract from the symmetry and balance of the hanger 40, although the loop holder 73 is somewhat offset from the hanger's vertical axis of symmetry. Pants 33 or other garments may be placed through the loop 70 and hung upon the bottom rung thereof. The hanger 40 may be disposed upon a conventional clothes hanger rod 30 in a balanced position with the pad member 76 substantially horizontal. Because the pant loop 70 is laterally movable, its position can be adjusted to optimize the gravitational balance of the hanger 40 when a garment is upon the loop 70. Indeed, if no garment is placed upon the shoulder members 46, 47, it is possible to use the hanger 40 in either an open or a closed position to hang only pants 33 or the like upon a conventional clothes hanger rod 30.<br>
When it is desired to fold the hanger 40 to the closed position, the loop 70 is shifted within the loop holder 73 until it is offset to the position shown in Fig. 5, where it is subjacent only to only one body portion 44 and its corresponding leg 50. In this offset position, the pant loop 70 is eccentric with respect to the balance point of the hanger 40, and does not interfere at all with the operation of the hinge 54. The pant loop 70 has a lateral extent substantially corresponding to, or less than, the width of the larger body member 44. With the pant loop in the offset position, the hanger 40 may freely be folded to the closed position, and the loop 70, while wide enough to carry a pair of pants 33, does not appreciably increase the overall width of the<br><br>
folded hanger 40. The hanger 40, carrying garments upon the pant loop 70, nevertheless may be used in its folded position and disposed within the narrow case 20 as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. In other, less expensive alternative embodiments, the pant loop may be immovably secured to one of the central bodies in a permanently offset position.<br>
Fig. 13 shows that an advantage of the invention is that the hanger 40 may be adapted for use in alternative trolley embodiments. The hanger 40 is shown in the closed position with the hook 60 retracted in a position between the two central body members 44, 45, but without any garments disposed thereon. A planar panel 88 may be immovably mounted or, preferably, hinged for swinging motion within the interior of a luggage case. In this alternative embodiment, the panel 88 is provided with horizontally aligned loop brackets 89, 89' through which one or more support arms 65, 66 may be frictionally inserted to secure the hanger 40 within the case.<br>
The hanger 40 may be used in either the open unfolded position or the closed folded position. The user can use the hanger 40 to hang a garment upon a conventional rod 30 or within the luggage case 20. A garment such as a sport coat is placed unfolded upon the hanger 40 in the open position as shown in Fig. 10, and the hanger hook 60 placed upon a conventional rod 30 (Fig. 5). If desired, the pant loop 70 may be shifted to the central position shown in Fig. 7, and a pair of pants or other garment may be suspended therefrom while the hanger 40 hangs in the balance from the rod 30. Optionally, user instructions may be printed on either or both central body members 44,45 where the instructions remain visible in the space between the lapels of the hanging garment.<br>
To transfer the hanger 40 and garment from, for a example a closet, the hanger 40 may be removed from the rod 30, and the hook 60 pivoted to the retracted position shown in Fig. 11, in which position the outside surface 64 of the hook comes into contact with the garment. The pant loop 70 is slidably shifted to the offset position shown in Fig. 5 The hanger 40 with the garment 32 remaining thereon is then folded into the closed position as shown in Fig. 12. Notably, portions of the garment 32 are sandwiched between the respective central body portions 44,45 of the hanger 40, and the hook 60 is sandwiched between layers of the garment 32. The hook 60, being attached to one of the central body portions 44, prevents the garment from sliding under its weight down the sloping shoulders 46,47. The knuckles of the<br><br>
main hinge 54 preferably extend somewhat away from the large central body member 44 to provide additional space between the central body members 44, 45 in which the garment layers are disposed.<br>
With the garment 32 and the hanger 40 both in a folded position as shown in Fig. 12, the hanger may be placed upon the trolley assembly 38 as shown in Fig. 4, or alternatively in accordance with Fig. 13. Also as depicted in Fig. 4, swing latches 86, 86' may be pivoted into the closed position (latch 86 in the figure) to prevent the hanger 40 from inadvertently sliding off the trolley rods 82, 82'. The garment 32 (and pants upon the pant loop 70 in embodiments incorporating the pant loop element) are thus securely but removably retained within the case 20 for transport.<br>
It is therefore to be understood that while preferred forms of invention have herein been set forth and described, modifications and changes may be made in the construction, arrangement and composition of parts without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims and reasonable equivalents thereof.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
