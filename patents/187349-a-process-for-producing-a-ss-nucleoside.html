				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates a process for producing a ß-nucleoside and further relates to methods and compositions for preparing nucleoside analogues containing dioxolane sugar rings. In particular, the invention relates to the stereoselective synthesis 1,3-dioxolane nucleosides having f3 or cis configuration.<br>
Nucleosides and their analogues represent an important class of chemotherapeutic agents with antiviral, anticancer, immunomodulatory and antibiotic activities. Nucleoside analogues such as 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2', 3'-dideoxyinosine (ddl), 2', 3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), 3'-deoxy-2', 3'-didehydrothymidine (d4T) and (-)-2'- deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC™) are clinically approved for the treatment of infections caused by the human immunodeficiency viruses. 2'-Deoxy-2'-methylidenecytidine (DMDC, Yamagami eL al. Cancer Research 1991, 51, 2319) and 2'-deoxy-2', 2'-difluorocytidine (gemcytidine, Hertel et al. 1. J. Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 2406) are nucleoside analogues with antitumor activity. A number of C-8 substituted guanosines such as 7-thia-B-oxoguanosine (Smee et al. -J. Biol. Response Mod. 1990, 9, 24) 8-bromoguanosine and 8- mercaptoguanosine (Wicker et al. Cell Immunol. 1987, 106, 318) stimulate the immune system and induce the production of interferon. All of the above biologically active nucleosides are single enantiomers.<br>
Recently, several members of the 3'-heterosubstituted class of 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside analogues such as 3TC™ (Coates et al. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992, 36, 202),    (-)-FTC (Chang et al. J. Bio. Chem. 1992, 267, 13938-13942) (-)-dioxolane C (Kim et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992, 33, 6899) have been reported to possess potent activity against HIV and HBV replication and possess the p-I/ absolute configuration.  (-)-Dioxolane C has been reported to possess antitumor activity (Grove et al. Cancer Res. 1995, 55, 3008-3011) .  The dideoxynucleoside analogues (-)-dOTC and (-)-dOTFC (Mansour et al. J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 1-4) were selective in activity against HIV-1.<br>
For a stereoselective synthesis of nucleoside analogues, it is essential that the nucleobase be introduced predominately with the desired relative stereochemistry without causing anomerization in the carbohydrate portion. One approach to achieve this is to modify the carbohydrate portion of a preassembled nucleoside by a variety of deoxygenation reactions (Chu et al. J. Org. Chem. 1989, 54, 2217-2225; Marcuccio et al. Nucleosid.es Nucleotides 1992, 11, 1695-1701; Starrett et al. Nucleosides Nucleotides 1990, 9, 885-897, Bhat et al. Nucleosides Nucleotides 1990, 9, 1061-1065).  This approach however is limited to the synthesis of those analogues whose absolute configuration resembles that of the starting nucleoside and would not be practical if lengthy procedures are required to prepare the starting nucleoside prior to deoxygenation as would be the case for p-L dideoxynucleosides.  An alternative approach to achieve stereoselectivity has been reported which requires assembling the nucleoside analogue by a reaction of a base or its synthetic precursor with the carbohydrate portion under Lewis acid coupling procedures or SN-2 like conditions.<br>
It is well known in the art that glycosylation of bases to dideoxysugars proceed in low stereoselectivity in the absence of a 2'-substituent on the carbohydrate rings capable of neighboring group participation. Okabe et al. (J. Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 4780-4786) reported the highest ratio  of p:a isomers of ddC of 60:40 with ethylaluminium dichloride as the Lewis acid.  However, with a phenylselenenyl substituent at the C-2 position of the carbohydrate (Chu et al. J. Org. Chem. 1980, 55, 1418-1420; Beach et al. J. Org. Chem. 1992, 57, 3887-3894) or a phenylsulfenyl moiety (Wilson et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990, 31, 1815-1818) the P:CX ratio increases to 99:1.  To overcome problems of introducing such substituents with the desired a-stereochemistry, Kawakami et al. (Nucleosides Nucleotides 1992, 11, 1673-1682) reported that disubstitution at C-2 of the sugar ring as in 2,2-diphenylthio-2,3-dideoxyribose affords nucleosides in the ratio of (5:0, = 80:20 when reacted with silylated bases in the presence of trimethylsilyltriflate (TMSOTf) as a catalyst.  Although this strategy enabled the synthesis of the p-anomer, removal of the phenylthio group proved to be problematic.<br>
Due to the limited generality in introducing the C-2 substituent stereoselectively, synthetic methodologies based on electrophilic addition of phenyl sulfenyl halides or N-iodosuccinimides and nucleobases to furanoid glycal intermediates have been reported (Kim et al. Tetrahedron<br>
i  Lett. 1992, 33, 5733-5376; Kawakami et al. Heterocycles 1993, 36, 665-669; ; Wang et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993, 34, 4881-4884; El-laghdach et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993, 34, 2821-2822).  In this approach, the 2'-substituent is introducejd in situ however, multistep procedures are<br>
i  needed for removal of such substituents.<br>
SN-2 like coupling procedures of 1-chloro and 1-bromo 2,3-dideoxysugars have been investigated (Farina et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988, 29, 1239-1242; Kawakami et al. Heterocycles 1990, 31, 2041-2053). However, the highest ratio of p to a nucleosides reported is 70:30 respectively.<br>
In situ complexation of metal salts such as SnCl, or Ti(O-Pr)2Cl2 to the ot-face of the sugar precursor when the sugar portion is an oxathiolanyl or dioxolanyl derivative produces (3-pyrimidine nucleosides (Choi et al. J". Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 9377-9379).  Despite the high ratio of p- to oc-anomers obtained in this approach, a serious limitation with enantiomerically pure sugar precursor is reported leading to racemic nucleosides (Beach et al. J". Org. Chem. 1992, 57, 2217-2219; Humber et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992, 32, 4625-4628; Hoong et al.  J". Org. Chem. 1992, 57, 5563-5565).  In order to produce one enantiomeric form of racemic nucleosides, enzymatic and chemical resolution methods are needed.  If successful, such methods would suffer from a practical disadvantage of wasting half of the prepared material.<br>
As demonstrated in the above examples, the art lacks an efficient method to generate p-nucleosides. In particular, with sugar precursors carrying a protected hydroxymethyl group at C-4', low selectivity is encountered during synthesis of fj-isomers or racemization problems occur. Specifically, the art lacks a method of producing stereoselectively dioxolanes from sugar intermediates carrying a C-2 protected hydroxymethyl moiety without racemization.  Therefore, a general stereoselective synthesis of biologically active p-nucleoside analogues is an important goal'.<br>
[international patent application publication no. tfO92/20669 discloses a method of producing dioxolanes 3tereoselectively by coupling sugar intermediates carrying 1-2 ester moieties with silylated nucleobases and subsequently reducing the C-2 ester group to the desired tiydroxymethyl group.  However, over reduction problems in the pyrimidine base have been disclosed (Tse et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 36, 7807-7810).<br>
Nfucleoside analogues containing 1,3-dioxolanyl sugars as mimetics of 2',3'-dideoxyfuranosyl rings have been prepared by glycosylating silylated purine and pyrimidine bases with 1,3-dioxolanes containing a C-2 hydroxymethyl and C-4 acetoxy substituents.  The crucial coupling reaction is mediated by trimethylsilytriflate (TMSOTf) or iodotrimethylsilane (TMSI) and produces a mixture of P and a-anomers in 1:1 ratio (Kim et al. J". Med. Chem. 1992, 35, 1987-1995 and J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 30-37; Belleau et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992, 33, 6948-6952; and Evans et al. Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1992, 4, 2319-2322).  By using metal salts as catalysts the p-nucleoside is favoured<br>
(Choi et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 9377-9379) but racemization or loss of selectivity become a serious limitation (Jin et al. Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1993, 4, 2111-2114).<br>

The present invention provides a novel method for producing dioxolane nucleoside analogues by coupling sugar _<br>

A « nucleoside » is defined as any compound which consists of a purine or pyrimidine base or analogue or derivative thereof, linked to a pentose sugar.<br>
A « nucleoside analogue or derivative » as used hereinafter is a compound containing a 1,3-dioxolane linked to a purine or pyrimidine base or analog thereof which may be modified in any of the following or combinations of the following ways: base modifications, such as addition of a substituent (e.g. 5-fluorocytosine) or replacement of one group by an isosteric group (e.g. 7-deazaadenine); sugar modifications, such as substitution of hydroxyl groups by any substituent or alteration of the site of attachment of the sugar to the base (e.g. pyrimidine bases usually attached to the sugar at the N-l site may be, for example, attached at the N-3 or C-6 site and purines usually attached at the N-9 site may be, for example, attached at N-7.<br>
A purine or pyrimidine base means a purine or pyrimidine base found in naturally occurring nucleosides. An analogue thereof is a base which mimics such naturally occurring bases in that its structure (the kinds of atoms and their arrangement) is similar to the naturally occurring bases but may either possess additional or lack certain of the functional properties of the naturally occurring bases. Such analogues include those derived by replacement of a CH moiety by a nitrogen atom, (e.g. 5-azapyrimidines, such as 5-azacytosine) or conversely (e.g., 7-deazapurines, such as 7-deazaadenine or 7-deazaguanine) or both (e.g., 7-deaza, 8-azapurines). By derivatives of such bases or analogues are mea'nt those bases wherein ring substituent are either incorporated, removed, or modified by<br>
conventional substituents known in the art, e.g. halogen, lydroxyl, amino, C,_6 alkyl. Such purine or pyrimidine oases, analogs and derivatives are well known to those of skill in th«5 art.<br>

In a preferred embodiment L' is acetoxy.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a stereoselective process for producing p-nucleoside analogues of formula (III), and salt or ester thereof, by glycosylation of the purine or pyrimidine base or analogue or derivative thereof, with an intermediate of formula (II) as defined previously under low temperature conditions.  Preferably, the glycosylation reaction takes<br><br>
place at temperatures below -10°C i.e. about -10 to -100aC and more preferably below -20°C.  In a most preferred embodiment the glycosylation reaction occurs between about -20 to -789C.<br>
The intermediate of formula II is reacted with a silylated purine or pyrimidine base, conveniently in a suitable organic solvent such as a hydrocarbon, for example, toluene, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane (DCM), a nitrile, such as acetonitrile, an amide such as dimethylformamide, an ester, such as ethyl acetate, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, or a mixture thereof, at low temperatures, such as -40° C to -78° C.  Silylated purine or pyrimidine bases or analogues and derivatives thereof may be prepared as described in WO92/20669, the teaching of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such silylating agents are 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane, trimethylsilyl triflate, t-butyldimethylsilyl triflate or trimethylsilyl chloride, with acid or base catalyst, as appropriate.  The preferred silylating agent is 1,1,1,3,3,3,-hexamethyldisilazane.<br>
To form the compound of formula (I), appropriate deprotecting conditions include methanolic or ethanolic ammonia or a base such as potassium carbonate in an appropriate solvent such as methanol or tetrahydrofuran for N-4 deacetytion.<br>
Transfer deacetylation hydrogenolysis with a hydrogen donor such as cyclohexene or ammonium formate in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium oxide over charcoal are appropriate for the removal of the 5'-aryl group.<br>
It will be appreciated that the intermediate of formula (II) is constituted by intermediates Ila and lib:<br>
(Formula  Removed)<br>
It will be further appreciated that, if the glycosylation step is carried out using equimolar amounts of intermediates Ila and lib, a racemic mixture of p-nucleosides of formula I is obtained.<br>
It will be apparent to those of skill in the art that separation of the resulting diastereomic mixture, for example after the coupling reaction between compounds of formula II and a silylated base, can be achieved by chromatography on silica gel or crystallization in an appropriate solvent (see, for example:  J. Jacques et al. Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions, pp 251-369, John Wiley and Sons, New York 1981).<br>
However, it is preferred that glycosylation is effected using an optically pure compound of either formula Ila or lib, thereby producing the desired nucleoside analog in high optical purity.<br>
The compounds of formula Ila or lib exist as mixture of two diastereomers epimeric at the C-4 centre.  We have now found that a single diastereomer, as well as any mixture of the diastereomers comprising the compounds of formula Ila, react with silylated bases to produce p-L nucleosides in high optical purity.  The base at C-4 having the cis-stereochemistry relative to the hydroxymethyl moiety at C-2.  The rate of the reaction of the two diastereomers of formula Ila with silylated bases may however, be different.  Similar findings exist for the intermediates of formula lib for the synthesis of P~D nucleosides.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a step for producing anomeric iodides of formula II by reacting known anomeric 2S-benzyloxymethyl-l,3-dioxolane-4S and -4R acetoxy derivatives of formula (V) with iodotrimethylsilane or diiodosilane at low temperatures (-78°C) prior to glycosylation with silylated pyrimidine or purine base or analogue or derivative thereof (Scheme 1).<br>

Suitable methods for producing the anomeric acetoxy intermediate (VI) will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and include oxidative degradation of benzyloxymethylacetals derived from L-ascorbic acid<br>
(Belleau et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992, 33, 6949-6952) or<br>
D-mannitol (Evans et al. Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1993, 4, 2319-2322).<br>
We have also found that the known 2S-benzyloxymethyl-l,3-dioxolane-4S-carboxyclic acid (V) can be generated in preference to its 2S,4R isomer by reacting commercially available 2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolane-4S-carboxylic acid with a protected derivative of hydroxyacetaldehyde, such as benzyloxyacetaldehyde, under acidic conditions.<br>
