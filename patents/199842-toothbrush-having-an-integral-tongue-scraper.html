				<td>Almost everyone of us uses both a toothbrush and tongue cleaner as separate tools. This invention relates to combining both of them. In a manner whieh is both easy to use and simple to manufacture. I have purposed six possible designs of combining both of them. Out of these six designs three can be used with single hand and rest three with both the hands. All the six designing are made my modifying the back side of the toothbrush. So as to house the tongue cleaner. A simple slide, pull or rotate movement exposures the functional tongue cleaner. In all expect six designs which is the fixed design. All the six designs are completely different thus giving the user wide choice to choose the one of his convenience. Design no. 1 and 2, which can be used as two hand held tongue cleaner i&amp;a slide in / out model. Design 3, can be used as one to hand held tongue cleaner the semicircular type tongue cleaner can be slided in/out of its case. Design 4, can be used as one hand held tongue cleaner. A simple rotate and pull movement will expose the functional tongue cleaner for use. Design 5, can be use as two hand held tongue cleaner it incorporates slip in/out type of tongue cleaner. Design 6, can be use as single hand held tongue cleaner which is permanently fixed to back of the toothbrush.</td>

				<td>TOOTHBRUSH HAVING AN INTRGRAL TONGUR SCRAPER<br>
Field of invention:- the present invention relates toothbrush having an integral tongue scraper and more particularly pertains to promoting better oral hygiene through a combination of toothbrush and hygienic tongue scraper.<br>
Background of invention:-it is well known that accumulation of food particles on the<br>
surface of tongue can be source of various problems. The fermentation of food particles<br>
can cause bad odors as well as create an atmosphere conducive to tooth decay, for this<br>
reason various instruments have been invented to clean the upper surface of the tongue<br>
through mechanical action of scraping.<br>
A in Indian patent no.36232, the conventional slender tongue cleaner was combined as<br>
such at the back of toothbrush. This forces the user to hold the main tongue cleaner itself<br>
for its usage, which is both difficult and unhygienic as well.<br>
Similar devices have been invented as in U.S patent no. 5709004 and U.S patent<br>
no.5915433 which depicts main tongue scraper which are exposed.<br>
In all these devices the upper surface of the tongue is cleaned through mechanical action<br>
of scraping. And the tongue consists of live tissue unlike teeth. Thus in order to promote<br>
better oral hygiene there exists a strong need for a better device which have unexposed<br>
main tongue scraper and thus more hygienic to use.<br>
Summary of invention:- in view of forgoing disadvantages inherent in the known type of toothbrush and tongue scrapers now present in the prior art, the present invention provides improved combined toothbrush and hygienic tongue scraper. The present invention essentially comprises a new and improved combined toothbrush and hygienic tongue scraper which incorporates following features:-<br>
(1)	the main tongue scraper is unexposed thus less chances of possible<br>
contamination.<br>
(2)	the main tongue scraper is distinctively separate part of the device<br>
thus one does not need to hold the main tongue scraper for its<br>
usage<br>
Also, most importantly the present invention presents SELF CLEANING hygienic tongue scrapers. The self cleaning of tongue scraper is through the CLEANING FINS. The process of opening or closing device will make the tongue scraper to slide against the cleaning fins. These cleaning fins could be of rubber/plastic/sponge or same material as of its adjoining case. Thus the main tongue scraper will remain clean and more hygienic to use.<br>
The handle of toothbrush is equipped with plural hemispherical or linear or curved bumps<br>
or bumps of any other design. This allows slip free usage of the device.<br>
The tongue scraper itself could be of various materials eg. Plastic, steel etc and of various<br>
shapes eg rectangular or tapering at its ends or having teeth of various radii, wherein the<br>
ultimate purpose being cleaning of tongue through mechanical action of scraping.<br>
In this respect before explaining at least one embodiment in detail it is to be understood<br>
that the invention not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the<br>
arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in<br>
drawings, the present invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced<br>
and carried out in various ways.<br>
Brief description of drawings:-<br>
FIG 1 and 2: side view of first embodiment of toothbrush having integral tongue scraper. FIG 3: open view of main tongue scraper. FIG 4 and 5: different types of main tongue scrapers. FIG 6 and 7: back view of second embodiment. FIG 8 and 9: back view of third embodiment.<br>
FIG 10 and 11: side view of forth embodiment in closed and open position. FIG 12 and 13: main tongue scraper with different stopper types. FIG 14: back view of outer case showing cleaning fins. FIG 15: top view of fifth embodiment.<br>
FIG 16 and 17: back view showing cleaning fins and main tongue scraper respectively. FIG 18: main tongue scraper in ready to use position. FIG 19: view showing cleaning fins.<br>
Accordingly there is provided a "toothbrush having an integral tongue scraper" comprising,<br>
a linear toothbrush handle having a first brush handle terminus(A), a second brush handle terminus(C) and an intermediate extend(B) therebetween,<br>
the said first brush handle terminus equipped with cleaning bristles, for cleaning teeth, the said second brush handle terminus attached to a tongue scrapers(a) first end, the second end of this said tongue scraper attached to a stopper(c), this said stopper is free to slide inside a hollow rectangular tube(b), the open end of the said rectangular tube is fitted with cleaning fins for self cleaning of the said tongue scraper, the said hollow rectangular case capable of sliding on the said second brush handle , allowing exposure of the said tongue scraper for its usage,<br>
the said intermediate handle consisting of plurality of hemispherical, linear or curved bumps(f) integrally formed in opposed planar faces to preclude slipping in users hand when using the device.<br>
Description of preferred embodiments:-<br>
FIRST EMBODIMENT<br>
Refer FIG 1 through 5. the main tongue scraper(a) is attached at its one end permanently to the back of toothbrush(e). the other end of this tongue scraper is attached to a stopper(c), which is free to slide inside the hollow rectangular case(b). role of stopper is to prevent the main tongue scraper to come out completely from its case(b). while using the toothbrush, the main tongue scraper will remain enclosed in its case(b). for using the tongue scraper to clean the tongue, the brush is reversed in user hand and its case is pulled away thus exposing the main tongue scraper(a). the process of opening or closing the case, also cleans both the faces of main tongue scraper member(a) through the cleaning fins, attached the open end of the hollow rectangular case(b). various shapes of main tongue scraper are possible eg as shown in FIG 4 and 5.<br>
a-	Main tongue scraper member,<br>
b-	Hollow rectangular tube/case enclosing (a),<br>
c-	Stopper.<br>
d-	Projection of rectangular case(b) for locking in groove d'.<br>
e-	Back of the toothbrush,<br>
f-	Plural hemispherical bumps.<br>
  -	cleaning fins.<br>
SECOND EMBODIMENT.<br>
Refer FIG 6 and 7. the main tongue scraper member(g) is fitted at the one end with a holder(h) through a pin(i) and with the back of toothbrush(k) through a pin (i). These two pins forming two hinges, which helps in collapsing the assembly. This holder and tongue scraper member assembly remains seated in the back of toothbrush as shown, while using the toothbrush. For using the tongue scraper member(g) the assembly is pulled out from its case.<br>
