				<td>System And Method For Liquid Delivery Evaluation Using<br>
Solutions With Multiple Light Absorbance Spectral Features<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a system for determining the volume of a<br>
liquid delivery. More particularly, the present invention relates to systems and related<br>
methods to test or calibrate liquid delivery devices using a sample solution having multiple<br>
distinct detectable light absorbance spectral features using one or more dyes to cover a<br>
volume range, or a dilution range, of interest.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
[0002] All currently manufactured colorimetric systems for testing or calibrating<br>
liquid delivery devices (e.g., the PCS® system and the MVS® system, both offered by Artel,<br>
Inc. of Westbrook, Maine, assignee of the present invention and application, and the Pipette<br>
Volume Calibration Kit offered by VistaLab of Mt. Kisco, New York) use a multiplicity of<br>
sample solutions for the purpose of testing a wide range of deliverable solution volumes. The<br>
sample solution is delivered by the device being tested into a diluent in a measurement vessel,<br>
and the solutions are mixed before measuring the absorbance of the resulting mixture. A<br>
concentrated sample solution is used to test a small liquid delivery volume, and a more dilute<br>
sample solution is used to test a large liquid delivery volume. As used herein, a "vessel" is<br>
any vial, cell, bottle, microtiter plate or other type of container for retaining a fluid therein,<br>
whether such vessel is sealed or not. Also, the vessel may be designed for collecting optical<br>
absorbance measurements by use of a horizontal beam spectrophotometer (such as a<br>
conventional UV-Vis spectrophotometer like the Cary 5000, Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) or a<br>
vertical beam spectrophotometer (such as a microtiter plate reader like the ELx800, BioTek<br>
Instruments, Winooski, VT).<br>
[0003] In simplified terms, the PCS® system includes one or more devices and one or<br>
more solutions used to calibrate a single-channel liquid dispensing device. On the other<br>
hand, the MVS® system includes one or more devices and one or more solutions used to<br>
calibrate a multi-channel liquid dispensing device, The difference between the two systems<br>
relates to the calculations performed subsequent to conducting absorbance measurements at<br>
one or more wavelengths corresponding to features present in the spectrum of the solution(s).<br>
[0004] In the case of one commercial embodiment of the Artel PCS® system, for<br>
example, four different concentrations of a sample solution, each targeting the same spectral<br>
feature, are provided to cover the volume range from 2 microliters (ul) to 5000 ul. Two<br>
additional concentrations of the same sample solution extend the range down to 0.1 µL The<br>
reason for using different concentrations is to maintain a measurable signal level (absorbance<br>
change resulting from the delivery of an aliquot of sample solution or diluent) within a<br>
defined signal range over the full range of liquid delivery volumes. That is to say, each<br>
concentration of sample solution is manufactured to produce a final measurable absorbance<br>
within a defined absorbance range for any delivered volume that is within the volume range<br>
for which the solution is designed. All concentrations of sample solution of the PCS®<br>
system are designed to produce measurable absorbance values over the same absorbance<br>
range. The disadvantage to using a multiplicity of solutions is that the user needs to stock<br>
them, rotate stock to make sure that the solutions are within their expiration date, and then<br>
choose which one or ones to use, and to dispense the correct solution(s) into one or more<br>
vessels from which the delivery device can aspirate the correct solution. There is ample<br>
opportunity for error, waste of unused solutions from the vessels, and waste of time and<br>
unnecessary distraction from the job of testing the delivery device. It is thus desirable to<br>
devise a method that would reduce the number of sample solutions required to test the entire<br>
volume range that can be delivered by a liquid delivery device.<br>
[0005] In addition to volume delivery testing, colorimetric measurement systems<br>
using multiple concentrations of the same sample solution can be used to test dilution<br>
protocols, which are commonly employed in life science laboratories. Such dilution protocols<br>
are often employed in drug discovery testing where a compound of interest is serially diluted<br>
across a microtiter plate. For example, the user dispenses 200 µL of sample solution into the<br>
first column of a microtiter plate and then aspirates 100 µL from that first column and<br>
dispenses it into 100 µL of diluent in the second column, creating a 1:2 dilution ratio of the<br>
sample solution in the second column. Serially repeating this process across all columns in<br>
the plate results in a range of dilutions from a 1:1 ratio up to a 1:2048 ratio. An effective<br>
dilution protocol system is described in pending US patent application no. 11/854,594, filed<br>
September 13,2007, having as assignee the assignee of the present application. The entire<br>
content of the referenced 11/854,594 pending application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
If the MVS® system were used to" test the dilutions made in this example, five sample<br>
solutions would be needed to cover the entire range of dilution ratios because each sample<br>
solution can only test a four- or five-fold range of dilution ratios before the absorbance signal<br>
of the single spectral feature in the sample solution is too low to be measured by the<br>
microtiter plate reader. Thus, to measure all dilution steps of this process, the serial dilution<br>
protocol has to be repeated for each of the five sample solutions such that a limited range of<br>
the dilution ratio series is tested with each sample solution. That is to say, each of the five<br>
sample solutions is serially diluted using the defined protocol. For each of the sample<br>
solutions, only a portion of the produced dilutions will be within a measurable absorbance<br>
range, but the combination of data from all sample solutions will provide measurements for<br>
every step of the entire process. As a result, many test vessels are filled with sample solution<br>
to cover the entire dilution range of interest but only a fraction are actually used. Thus, there<br>
is a waste of solution and of time.<br>
[0006] Alternative methods for testing serial dilution protocols include fluorescence,<br>
which covers a far greater range (1,000 - 10,000 fold greater range) of dilution ratios before<br>
the signal is too low to measure. However, the fluorescence method introduces variability<br>
because of the instability of fluorescent dyes due to photo-bleaching, quenching, etc, and also<br>
lacks the traceability to international standards of an absorbance-based photometric approach.<br>
Therefore, it is also desirable to devise an absorbance-based photometric method that would<br>
measure an extended range of dilution ratios using one sample solution containing multiple<br>
spectral features, each capable of testing a unique four or five fold range of dilution ratios as<br>
an alternative to fluorimetry testing of dilution processing as noted herein.<br>
[0007] Other systems have been described for enhancing calibration accuracy. See,<br>
for example, US patent no. 5,298,978 for "Pipette Calibration System" of Curtis et al.,<br>
incorporated herein by reference, US patent no. 4,354,376 for "Kit for Calibrating Pipettes"<br>
of Greenfield, and US patents nos. 6,741,365 and 7,187,455 for "Photometric Calibration of<br>
Liquid Volumes" of Curtis, also incorporated herein by reference. These systems have<br>
limitations resolved by the use in the present invention of a dye, or a plurality of dyes,<br>
capable of producing multiple distinct detectable light absorbance spectral features in a<br>
smaller set of sample solutions, wherein each distinct detectable light absorbance spectral<br>
feature allows calibration or testing over a specific volume range. A dye is any molecule or<br>
chemical compound that imparts one or more features to the absorbance spectrum of the<br>
solution. This definition is not intended to limit the feature to the visible region of the<br>
spectrum, nor to limit the spectral feature to the dye or dyes alone. The solvent could also<br>
impart a spectral feature that could be used as is described in this invention. One skilled in the<br>
art may recognize that a dye may be the functional equivalent of a chromophore. As used<br>
herein, "distinct detectable light absorbance spectral features" are distinct and detectable<br>
peaks, valleys, plateaus, or any combination of peaks and valleys and plateaus in the<br>
absorbance spectrum of a solution under test. In the case of US patent no. 4,354,376 of<br>
Greenfield, there is only one distinct detectable light absorbance spectral feature. In the case<br>
of US patent no. 5,298,978 of Curtis et al., there is a second feature present in the spectrum of<br>
the diluent solely for the purpose of determining the pathlength of light through the vessel<br>
before any sample solution is added to the vessel, minimizing uncertainty in the results due to<br>
uncertainty in vessel dimensions. This second spectral feature is not contained in the sample<br>
solution dispensed with the liquid delivery device under test. In the case of US patent nos.<br>
6,741,365 and 7,187,455 to Curtis, two spectral features are used to eliminate uncertainty in<br>
results that would otherwise occur due to uncertainty in the volume of diluent added to the<br>
tapered wells of the microtiter plate used as a measurement vessel. Both spectral features are<br>
contained in the sample solutions, however the function of the second spectral feature (in that<br>
particular case, CuCl2) is to correct for the unknown volume of diluent, not to cover a wider<br>
range of dispensing volumes.<br>
[0008] What is needed is a system and related method to resolve the limitations of the<br>
existing liquid delivery measurement systems in which the use of colorirnetric techniques to<br>
evaluate liquid delivery devices or protocols requires the use of an excess number of sample<br>
solutions for volume and dilution ranges of interest.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] The purpose of the present invention is to resolve the above-noted limitations<br>
by simplifying the testing or calibrating of liquid delivery devices. This greater simplicity<br>
will reduce costs, allow users to do their work more effectively, and reduce the likelihood of<br>
errors. This invention achieves this greater simplicity by reducing the number of different<br>
sample solutions required to test a large range of volumes, or a large range of dilutions, to a<br>
minimal number, ideally only one, from typically four. The present invention is designed to<br>
be in conformance with International Standards Organization (ISO) standard 8655 part 7 and,<br>
further, it is designed to provide results traceable to international standards, thereby making it<br>
advantageous over fluorimetric techniques. Finally, this invention is designed to extend the<br>
testable dilution range or volume range of a sample solution by increasing the number of<br>
spectral features in the sample solution. Specifically, an extended testable volume range<br>
enables the use of a single sample solution, optimally, to cover pipettes (or other relevant<br>
delivery devices) most commonly tested or calibrated in the volume range of about 2 µL to<br>
about 5000 µl. Similarly, an extended range of dilutions can be tested using a single sample<br>
solution, optimally, for a range of 1:1 up to 1:2500. In the event a single sample solution<br>
cannot be used for a desired volume or dilution range, the present invention nevertheless<br>
enables use of a smaller set of sample solutions than has heretofore been required.<br>
[0010] The present invention is a system and related method for improved liquid<br>
delivery evaluations using solutions containing one or more dyes or other light absorbing<br>
compounds or chemicals, which in combination or individually, exhibit multiple distinct<br>
detectable light absorbance spectral features, each solution capable of calibrating or testing<br>
over a wide volume range, or dilution range, of interest. The system includes: a photometric<br>
instrument capable of measuring optical absorbance at multiple wavelengths; one or more<br>
reagents including one or more sample solutions to be dispensed using the liquid delivery<br>
system whose performance is being tested or calibrated; and, optionally, vessels pre-filled<br>
with diluent solution. The sample solution contains at least one dye, chosen so that when any<br>
volume within a volume range of interest is dispensed into a vessel, a distinct detectable light<br>
absorbance spectral feature exists at a wavelength and absorbance level within the dynamic<br>
range of the photometric instrument. In a solution containing multiple dyes, for example, the<br>
concentrations of the different dyes are chosen so that a relatively large volume delivered by<br>
a liquid delivery device is calibrated using a spectral feature in the solution with a low<br>
absorbance per unit pathlength, while a relatively small volume delivery is calibrated with the<br>
same sample solution but using a different spectral feature with a high absorbance per unit<br>
pathlength.<br>
[0011] The use of a minimal number of sample solutions suitable to calibrate or test<br>
over an extended volume range, or over an extended dilution range, due to the multiple<br>
distinct detectable light absorbance spectral features, provides a simpler user protocol with<br>
less chance for user error and greater convenience. This resolves a problem noted in regard to<br>
at least one of the systems of the prior references, in which four different concentrations of<br>
sample solution are used to cover an extended volume or dilution range commonly delivered<br>
by various pipette sizes. This also resolves a problem noted for the MVS® system in which a<br>
substantial number of different concentrations of sample solution must be used to cover an<br>
extended dilution range of 1:1 up to 1:2048.<br>
[0012] As noted, the purpose of putting one or more dyes providing multiple distinct<br>
detectable light absorbance spectral features into a minimal number of sample solutions is to<br>
simplify operation of the system. Specifically, the operator does not need to choose a<br>
corresponding concentration of dye in a solution for each delivery volume range, or dilution<br>
range, of interest, since a lesser number of solutions serves the entire range of delivery<br>
volumes or dilution ratios. The system can use either a vertical beam photometer or a<br>
horizontal beam photometer, and can use either a fixed or a removable measurement vessel.<br>
The diluent can contain a dye or not. The system can be configured to test or calibrate a<br>
single delivery at a time or multiple deliveries at once as is the case with a multi-channel<br>
delivery device.<br>
[0013] These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be more<br>
readily understood in view of the following detailed description, accompanying drawings and<br>
appended claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0020] An embodiment of a set of devices associated with a system suitable for<br>
conducting the steps of the methods of the present invention is shown in FIG. 1. It is to be<br>
understood that other devices performing the same functions may be employed without<br>
deviating from the intended functions of the devices represented in FIG. 1, in which a volume<br>
determining apparatus 10 includes as primary components a liquid holder 20, a<br>
spectrophotometer 30, and a computing system 40 capable of carrying out calculations<br>
defined through computer-executable software and/or firmware, which software or firmware<br>
may be associated with the computing system 40 or alternatively with a liquid dispenser such<br>
as the type shown in FIG. 2. It is to be understood that the computing system 40 and<br>
associated programming may reside in other devices of the system including, for example,<br>
the spectrophotometer 30. Further, any one or more of the example devices described herein<br>
may be integrated into a single device without deviating from the primary aspects of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0021] The liquid holder 20 is a vessel that may be used to retain liquid 21 to be<br>
analyzed. The liquid holder 20 may be placed into the spectrophotometer 30. The<br>
spectrophotometer 30 is capable of being instructed to initiate absorbance measurements on<br>
the liquid 21 in the liquid holder 20. These instructions may be carried out through one or<br>
more input devices of the spectrophotometer 30 or through the computing system 40. The<br>
computing system 40 includes one or more input devices, such as a keyboard 41, a mouse 42,<br>
or a combination thereof, which may be used to control the spectrophotometer 30 and/or to<br>
perform calculations of volume determination based on the absorbance measurements. The<br>
computing system 40, including a computer processor 43 and memory storage, is configured<br>
to carry out executable-system instructions for volume determination. Input information and<br>
output information may be viewed on a computer display 44. Optionally, a local or remote<br>
printer 45 may be employed to print out input information and/or output information, or the<br>
information may simply be observed on the display 44.<br>
[0022] A liquid dispenser 100 as shown in FIG. 2 may be used for aspirating and<br>
dispensing volumes of liquid into the liquid holder 20. The liquid dispenser includes a<br>
channel member 110 and a liquid holding tip 200, or simply, a tip 200. The liquid dispenser<br>
100 may be any of the liquid handling devices used by those ordinarily skilled in the art. It<br>
should therefore be understood that the liquid dispenser 100 may include one channel<br>
member 110 or may have a plurality of channel members 110, and that regardless of the<br>
number of channel members 110 that are included, each channel member 110 may have its<br>
own tip 200. Further, the liquid dispenser 100 may be operated manually or automatically in<br>
dispensing and aspirating the liquid 21 into and out of the liquid holder 20.<br>
[0023] While a form of photometric instrument suitable for use as part of the system<br>
is shown in FIG. 1 as a desktop spectrophotometer 30 device, it may alternatively be a small,<br>
hand held device that measures absorbance through vessels such as liquid holder 20<br>
containing liquid 21. Such a device may also be a vertical beam spectrophotometer that<br>
measures absorbance through vessels such as the wells of microtiter plates. However, it is to<br>
be understood that the system and related method are not limited to such a specific<br>
photometric instrument and other types of such instruments may be employed including use<br>
of a flow cell with a fixed pathlength, or a fiber optic probe to take an absorbance<br>
measurement without deviating from the basic function of the system.<br>
[0024] A specific vessel represented as liquid holder 20 for containing a solution<br>
having a pathlength (inside diameter) of 1.8 centimeters (cm) is used for illustration purposes<br>
throughout this description. However, that is only an example and it is to be understood that<br>
the present invention is not limited to a specific vessel size or pathlength. The photometric<br>
system of the present invention includes an optical sub-system, preferably with four filters to<br>
select four wavelengths at which absorbance can be measured. It is to be understood that the<br>
system may use more or fewer filters for measurement at different wavelengths or may use<br>
another means of wavelength selection. The system includes firmware embodied in the<br>
photometric instrument that is programmed to measure absorbance at all necessary<br>
wavelengths every time that a volume measurement is made. It is to be understood that the<br>
programming may be in software or embedded in hardware. It may be contained locally in<br>
the photometric instrument, in another device, or remotely.<br>
[0025] The system further includes a kit with one or more vessels of known<br>
pathlength (inside diameter) containing a known amount of diluent or a fill mark for the user<br>
to add diluent, one or more bottles of sample solution that will be dispensed by a dispenser<br>
under test, and a vessel containing a calibration solution. The one or more vessels may or<br>
may not be capped and/or capped and sealed.<br>
[0026] In the example described herein in which an operator has a kit, the operator of<br>
the system removes a vessel containing diluent from the kit of reagents, inserts it into the<br>
photometric instrument and presses the "zero" key or other corresponding initiation or<br>
activation mechanism. The instrument reads the absorbance at all four wavelengths and sets<br>
absorbance at all four wavelengths to zero. In the simplest implementation of this invention,<br>
the diluent contains no dye; only a buffer and preservative.<br>
[0027] Next, the operator removes the vessel containing diluent from the instrument,<br>
dispenses an aliquot of sample solution into the vessel using the delivery device being tested,<br>
caps the vessel, mixes the contents by inverting the vessel several times, and returns it into<br>
the photometric instrument. Alternatively, the photometric instrument has a built-in mixing<br>
means, in which case the operator does not need to remove the vessel from the photometric<br>
instrument. In the case where the mixing is accomplished by the device, the vessel may or<br>
may not include as part of the design, a structure within the vessel to assist with mixing by<br>
generating increased turbulence when spun or otherwise moved during the mixing step. The<br>
operator then presses the "read" key or other corresponding initiation or activation<br>
mechanism to initiate the photometric measurement following the mixing.<br>
[0028] In a specific example using the indicated components, the sample solution<br>
contains four dyes, each at a different concentration. More specifically, each dye is selected<br>
to be appropriate for a unique range of dispensed volumes. The instrument reads absorbance<br>
values for the sample solution starting at the wavelength corresponding to the feature having<br>
the lowest absorbance per unit pathlength and if the value is out of range, the instrument<br>
would measure the absorbance at the wavelength corresponding to the feature with the next<br>
lowest absorbance per unit pathlength. It is to be noted that one or more of the absorbance<br>
values may be out of range for the photometric instrument and so measurements should be<br>
taken at each of the wavelengths until a useable value is obtained. It should be noted that this<br>
example is not intended to limit the ways the measurements are made, as they could start at<br>
any wavelength of interest and continue in any pattern until the desired absorbance reading is<br>
obtained.<br>
[0029] The programming of the software or firmware of the invention is optionally<br>
configured to automatically choose the wavelength that has the highest absorbance, yet which<br>
is not out of range. Using the Beer-Lambert Law, which states that the absorbance A is the<br>
product of dye molar absorptivity e, dye concentration C, and pathlength l:<br>
A = eCl (0.1),<br>
the program calculates the volumetric results based on the optical properties of the<br>
sample and diluent solutions at the chosen wavelength, a dimension of the vessel, the results<br>
of the absorbance measurements and the volume of diluent in the vessel at the start, all as<br>
described in one or more of the references incorporated herein. For ease of discussion, the<br>
terms e and C are combined to represent absorbance per unit pathlength at the wavelength<br>
of interest. It is to be understood that the relevant dimension of the vessel employed in the<br>
equation is dependent upon the type of spectrophotometer used. For a horizontal beam<br>
measurement, the vessel dimension relevant to the pathlength of light through the solution is<br>
the inside diameter of the vessel. For a vertical beam measurement, the pathlength of light<br>
determination is dependent upon the height of the solution in the vessel, also as described in<br>
one or more of the incorporated references.<br>
[0030] The operator can repeat the dispense operation into the same vessel a number<br>
of times. The upper limit on how many times may be set in the program and may depend on:<br>
1) the maximum volume capacity of the vessel, 2) the maximum absorbance limit for the<br>
instrument, 3) the minimum absorbance change required for acceptable results, or 4) a<br>
limiting number that is preprogrammed.<br>
[0031] Once the operator is finished testing a given volume, the results may be sent to<br>
the printer 45, display 44 and/or a separately linked computing device. The mean volume,<br>
standard deviation, and coefficient of variation are among the types of information that may<br>
be sent to the printer 45, display 44 and/or separately linked computing device.<br>
[0032] The operator can test delivery devices at several different volumes if desired,<br>
dispensing the same sample solution into the vessel as above, subject to the limitations noted<br>
above regarding dispensing, and preferably, as long as the smaller volumes are dispensed first<br>
and the larger ones subsequently. The reason for this restriction is that to measure a small<br>
volume accurately, a spectral feature in the solution must have a sufficiently high absorbance<br>
per unit pathlength to get a large enough change in absorbance to measure accurately. If,<br>
however, the operator already added so much sample solution that the absorbance is out of<br>
range for the photometer, then the system cannot get an accurate measure of that small<br>
volume. As stated previously, the term absorbance per unit pathlength is the product of the<br>
molar absorptivity of the dye and the concentration of the dye. In this application, the<br>
absorbance per unit pathlength is associated with a spectral feature which may or may not<br>
result from a combination of dyes.<br>
[0033] In the Artel PCS® system, each concentration of sample solution covers a<br>
roughly four- or five-fold range of liquid delivery volumes. Therefore, a single sample<br>
solution with a single absorbance spectral feature is sufficient for equipment calibration over<br>
a four- or five-fold range of volumes. However, if calibration over a greater volume range is<br>
desired, more than one solution is required to cover the greater range. For example, if a<br>
greater range of volumes were tested with a given relatively dilute concentration of solution<br>
suitable for relatively large volumes, the smaller volumes would produce too small a change<br>
of absorbance to be measured accurately, leading to an unacceptably large uncertainty in the<br>
results. Or, alternatively, if the solution were made more concentrated to boost the signal for<br>
the smaller volumes, then the relatively large volumes would produce too high an overall<br>
absorbance, leading to non-linear or non-reproducible results. The exception to this volume<br>
range limit is for the most dilute solutions, which are used to measure the largest volumes. In<br>
this case, the volume of solution being measured is so large that instead of the limit being set<br>
by absorbance, it is set by the capacity of the vessel that receives the solution.<br>
[0034] In order to address the absorbance or volume range limitation, the<br>
simplification provided by the present system and related method involves providing a dye or<br>
a plurality of dyes producing multiple distinct detectable light absorbance spectral features in<br>
a sample solution such that the combination of detectable light absorbance spectral features in<br>
the solution allow calibration or testing over a larger volume range or dilution range of<br>
interest than would otherwise be allowed using a single spectral feature. When a relatively<br>
large volume is dispensed, the system uses a spectral feature with a low absorbance per unit<br>
pathlength as the basis for calculating the volume dispensed. When a small volume is<br>
dispensed, the system uses a spectral feature with a high absorbance per unit pathlength as the<br>
basis for calculating the volume dispensed. If each spectral feature can cover a volume or<br>
dilution range of about 4:1 or about 5:1, and four non-overlapping and distinct spectral<br>
features exist within the absorbance spectrum, then a volume range of 2 µL to 5000 µL or a<br>
dilution range of 1:1 to 1:2500 can be evaluated for a delivery device using only one sample<br>
solution containing all four such spectral features. By incorporating multiple spectral<br>
features into one sample solution, the testable volume range is significantly expanded as<br>
compared to the sample solutions used by either of the PCS® or the MVS® systems.<br>
[0035] For the purpose of making an absorbance measurement, it is always desirable<br>
to measure at a wavelength where the spectrum has zero slope, so that a slight error in<br>
wavelength will result in little or no corresponding error in absorbance value. Zero slope<br>
occurs either at a minimum or a maximum or a plateau in the absorbance spectrum. A single<br>
sample solution created through the present system with a dye or a plurality of dyes should<br>
provide a complete absorbance spectrum with at least four distinct detectable light<br>
absorbance spectral features (i.e., any combination of peaks and/or valleys and/or plateaus)<br>
where the slope at each spectral feature is zero. The absorbance values for the peaks or<br>
valleys or plateaus must fall within a defined absorbance range which is suitable for<br>
measuring a designated range of volumes. If a combination of four different dyes is chosen,<br>
then there is complete control over the magnitude of absorbance at all four peaks and/or<br>
valleys and/or plateaus. On the other hand, it may be possible to use a single dye having two<br>
or more distinct detectable light absorbance spectral features that happen to have suitable<br>
magnitudes, but the relationship between the magnitudes of each feature is beyond the control<br>
of the user.<br>
[0036] By way of example and not intending to be limiting, Table 1 summarizes<br>
design parameters based on a system using four absorbance peaks, a path length of 1.8 cm; a<br>
maximum absorbance of 1.5 Optical Density (OD); and a diluent volume of 5000 µl. One<br>
skilled in the art would recognize that the term Optical Density (OD) could also be referred to<br>
as Absorbance Units (AU) or Extinction (E).<br>
[0037] Most simple and reasonably priced photometric instruments are able to<br>
measure in the visible and near infrared region of the spectrum: Glass absorbs light at<br>
ultraviolet wavelengths and silicon photodiodes are not as sensitive at that part of the<br>
spectrum. A special source is required for UV wavelengths, typically a deuterium lamp,<br>
which would add to the cost of the system. The most basic system will stay within the<br>
wavelength range of 340 to 800 nanometers (nm). The dyes chosen for the examples given in<br>
this disclosure have principal peaks within this range; however there is no reason that dyes<br>
with peaks or valleys or plateaus outside of this range could not be used, provided they were<br>
used in conjunction with an instrument that could measure in the expanded range.<br>
[0038] Many organic dyes have an absorbance spectrum with a principal peak at one<br>
wavelength, and lesser peaks and valleys at shorter wavelengths which need to be considered<br>
when combining dyes. Often, the absorbance decreases sharply to zero at wavelengths longer<br>
than the principal peak. An example of such a spectrum is that for Tartrazine, represented by<br>
the absorbance curve shown in FIG. 3, in which the principal peak is at about 425 nm. This<br>
property is useful when combining multiple dyes in one sample solution since, when the most<br>
concentrated dye is chosen to be the one at the short end of the wavelength range, it does not<br>
interfere with the spectra of the dyes that are added with principal absorbance peaks at longer<br>
wavelengths. In this way, multiple dyes can be combined in a way that their spectra have<br>
relatively little interference with one another.<br>
[0039] Two examples of sample solutions with multiple distinct detectable light<br>
absorbance spectral features are described herein; one uses four dyes and the other uses two.<br>
These are only examples and are not intended to represent all options for using one or more<br>
dyes in a single sample solution to establish multiple distinct detectable light absorbance<br>
spectral features.<br>
[0040] The four dyes of the first example are chosen based on the following criteria:<br>
Peaks are approximately equally spaced and are within the visible range when the<br>
dyes are combined;<br>
Peaks are broad enough so that they are easily measured with an instrument of modest<br>
wavelength accuracy (e.g. ± 5 nm);<br>
They are all adequately soluble in aqueous solution;<br>
Their physical properties in aqueous solution do not adversely affect the ability of a<br>
liquid delivery device to accurately dispense the resulting solution (e.g. if surface tension of<br>
the solution is reduced, there will be a tendency for small droplets to remain behind in the tip<br>
of the delivery device);<br>
They are not unstable in solution (e.g. due to light exposure) or pH dependent (e.g.<br>
indicators); and<br>
The tail on the long wavelength side of the principal peak of one dye does not overlap<br>
with the peak of the next dye. This helps to assure that the next peak really is a peak, and not<br>
just a bump on the tail of the peak below it.<br>
[0041] In the conceptually simplest example of a single solution containing four dyes,<br>
there are four peaks and each peak does not interfere with its neighboring peaks. The<br>
absorbance spectral features for this four-dye example are represented in FIG. 4. In that<br>
figure, Feature 1, which is the peak for Cu(EDTA)2- and has the lowest absorbance per unit<br>
pathlength of the four dyes, could be used for the largest volumes (200-5000 µl) to be tested.<br>
Feature 2, which is the peak for Methyl Green, could be used for the next volume range down<br>
(50 - 200 ul). Feature 3, which is the peak for Ponceau S, could be used for the next volume<br>
range down (10-50 ul). Finally, Feature 4, which is the peak for Tartrazine and has the<br>
highest absorbance per unit pathlength of the four dyes, could be used for the smallest<br>
volumes (2-10 µl) to be tested.<br>
The four dyes used in this example and meeting the criteria identified above are given<br>
in Table 2:<br>
Dilution ratios for the concentrations of this sample solution which target each dye are 0.5 for<br>
the Cu(EDTA)2-, 0.17 for the Methyl Green, 0.05 for the Ponceau S, and 0.01 for the<br>
Tartrazine. It is to be understood that other dyes may be used, other or the same dyes may be<br>
used in different concentrations, to achieve the intended outcome of the present invention and<br>
that the example represented in the table is in no way intended to be limiting.<br>
[0042] In the event the four-dye relationship shown in FIG. 4 is difficult to achieve,<br>
such as due to limitations of the spectrophotometer or the dyes available, a smaller number of<br>
dyes may be used, provided their characteristics provide the desired number of distinct<br>
detectable light absorbance spectral features to cover the volume ranges of interest. An<br>
example alternative for that purpose is the two-dye combination represented in FIGS. 5 and 6.<br>
FIG. 5 represents the absorbance curve for the two-dye sample solution for a complete<br>
absorbance range using a logarithmic scale and FIG. 6 represents four different dilutions of<br>
the two-dye sample solution, each dilution being chosen to bring one of the spectral features<br>
within the absorbance range typically available with commercial photometric instruments. In<br>
this alternative example, the two dyes produce two peaks and two valleys to give distinct<br>
spectral features from which to calculate the volume dispensed. Feature 1, a valley between<br>
the peak of the Cu(EDTA)2- and the principal Ponceau S peak, could be used for the largest<br>
volumes (200-5000 µl). Feature 2, the Cu(EDTA)2- peak, could be used for the next volume<br>
range down (50 - 200 µl). Feature 3, a valley from the Ponceau S minimum between the<br>
principal and secondary peaks, could be used for the next range (10-50 µl). Finally, Feature<br>
4, the principal Ponceau S peak could be used for the smallest volumes (2-10 µl).<br>
[0043] The two dyes used for this example have the characteristics given Table 3:<br>
<br>
In this example, the desired absorbance per cm for the valley between the Cu(EDTA)2- and<br>
Ponceau S is fixed based on the ratio of the two dyes in the solution. Also, the absorbance per<br>
cm for the Ponceau S valley is related to the absorbance per cm of the peak as it is a property<br>
of that dye.<br>
[0044] The results of a volume measurement using a multi-dye solution of the present<br>
invention are calculated using the Beer Lambert Law identified in' equation (0.1) herein.<br>
Specifically, for the first delivery of sample solution with volume V1 the expected absorbance<br>
at wavelength i is<br>
<br>
Where 4 is the absorbance after the first delivery measured at wavelength i, ei Ci is<br>
the absorbance per unit pathlength of the sample solution at wavelength i; and VD is the<br>
volume of diluent originally in the vessel.<br>
This can be solved for the delivery volume Vt:<br>
<br>
[0045] This equation holds for all of the absorbance measurements at all wavelengths.<br>
However, some of the absorbance measurements are unsuitable for use; either they are so<br>
small that there is too much uncertainty associated with them, or they are too large for the<br>
instrument to measure accurately. If the concentrations of the different dyes have been chosen<br>
correctly, then at least one of the absorbance measurements is in a measurable absorbance<br>
range and can be used to calculate an accurate value of volume.<br>
[0046] After the nth delivery of sample solution, the total volume of sample solution<br>
delivered up to and including the nth can be calculated in the same way:<br>
<br>
The system of the present invention includes the option, manually or automatically through<br>
programming, such as associated with the firmware, for example, but not limited thereto, to<br>
keep a running tally of how much sample has been added through the n-1th delivery, so it can<br>
simply be subtracted to find the value added at the nth delivery:<br>
<br>
Note that the value of Vn is only dependent on the nth and n-1th absorbance measurements,<br>
and that these two sequential measurements need not have been made at the same<br>
wavelength. In equation (0.5) the n' measurement was made at wavelength i, and the n-1th<br>
was made at wavelength j.<br>
[0047] An example of how volumetric results could be calculated for the example<br>
case of four dyes noted above follows. In this example, the user dispenses one aliquot of 5 µl,<br>
one of 20 µl, one of 100 µl and one of 1000 µl. The initial volume of diluent is 5000 µl. The<br>
vessel pathlength is 1.8 cm. The expected absorbance values at the four wavelengths and the<br>
calculated volumes are provided in Table 4:<br>
[0048] Table 4 gives the absorbance values at each of the four wavelengths after each<br>
delivery. For each volume determination, the absorbance selected for use in the calculation is<br>
the one that is as large as possible yet also within the measurable absorbance range (less than<br>
1.5 in this example). Those values are shown in the table. In making the calculation, the<br>
absorbance per cm for the spectral feature at the measured wavelength is used in the<br>
equations above.<br>
[0049] The scenarios presented above have described using multiple light absorbance<br>
spectral features present in the sample solution to determine the accuracy of volume delivery<br>
from a test device. The examples presented demonstrate that by using multiple light<br>
absorbance spectral features in the sample solution, a significantly enlarged testable volume<br>
range can be achieved, as compared to individual solutions with only one light absorbance<br>
spectral feature. Yet another way to further expand the testable volume range would be to<br>
include one or a plurality of dyes in the diluent solution, which present one or a plurality of<br>
distinct light absorbance spectral features, these features being unique to the diluent solution.<br>
Because these light absorbance spectral features are unique to the diluent solution, they are<br>
not in common with, nor overlap significantly with any light absorbance spectral feature or<br>
features in the sample solution. The light absorbance spectral features in the diluent can also<br>
be used to quantify volume additions.<br>
[0050] As an example of this alternative approach, the absorbance values of the light<br>
absorbance spectral features in the diluent are measured prior to any sample volume addition.<br>
As in the examples above, some of these features will be too highly absorbing, but others will<br>
be within range. The desired test volume of sample solution is then added to the diluent and<br>
mixed, and the absorbance values of the light absorbance spectral features in the mixture of<br>
sample and diluent are measured. The addition of sample solution dilutes the concentration<br>
of dyes in the diluent, reducing the absorbance values for the light absorbance spectral<br>
features of the diluent dyes. The decrease in absorbance for the diluent spectral features in<br>
the mixture is directly related to the volume of sample solution that was added. Thus, by<br>
applying the same concepts as explained for the sample solution above, multiple light<br>
absorbance spectral features in the diluent can be used to measure sample volume.<br>
[0051] A clear extension of the above example would be to use a sample solution<br>
with multiple light absorbance spectral features as well as a diluent with multiple light<br>
absorbance spectral features that are unique to the diluent and different from the sample. By<br>
monitoring the absorbance of the multiple light absorbance spectral features in the sample<br>
and in the diluent, an even further extension of testable volume range can be achieved.<br>
Because the light absorbance spectral features in the diluent are measured by their dilution,<br>
measurable changes to these features occur typically due to larger sample volume additions.<br>
Thus, the features in the diluent should be most applicable to large sample volume additions,<br>
whereas the small sample volume additions will be more appropriately measured by the light<br>
absorbance spectral features in the sample solution.<br>
[0052] It can be seen from this alternative example that the present invention may be<br>
used to calculate the volume of a sample solution added to a vessel wherein the sample<br>
solution may include one or a plurality of dyes presenting one or a plurality of distinct light<br>
absorbance spectral features, the diluent may also include one or more dyes presenting one or<br>
a plurality of distinct light absorbance spectral features, further distinct from the features of<br>
the sample solution, all in any combination to cover a wider range of volumes than has<br>
heretofore been available.<br>
[0053] It is desirable that means be provided to allow the user to periodically test the<br>
instrument for correct and accurate functionality. One method of doing that is to provide a<br>
vessel containing calibration solution in the reagent kit. This calibration solution preferably<br>
contains all of the same dyes present in the sample solution(s); however, the concentrations<br>
will be such that the absorbance values are within a measurable range at all of the<br>
wavelengths without dilution, at least with respect to the four-dye example. The user inserts<br>
the vessel into the instrument, and instructs it to check the calibration. Readings are made at<br>
all of the wavelengths and compared to the values measured in the kit manufacturer's<br>
laboratory using an instrument whose results are traceable to international standards. Pass /<br>
Fail criteria are provided by the manufacturer of the system. The calibration vessel will not be<br>
consumed or altered in this process, so the calibration can be carried out as often as desired.<br>
For the situation in which fewer than four dyes are used, more than one calibration standard<br>
might be required in order to provide a calibration point within the measurable absorbance<br>
range for each utilized wavelength.<br>
[0054] As previously indicated, the concept of using one or more sample solutions,<br>
with each sample solution including multiple light absorbance spectral features, may also, be<br>
applied to evaluations of dilution protocols. US patent application no. 11/854,594<br>
incorporated herein provides details of three dilution-related methods involving the use of<br>
different calculation mechanisms for determining either volume or dilution ratios based on<br>
dilution protocols performed. The reference describes dilution evaluations based on the use<br>
of a single light absorbance spectral feature in solutions used to carry out the determinations.<br>
The present invention includes methods in which solutions having multiple light absorbance<br>
spectral features are used in the dilution evaluations in which a sample solution is combined<br>
with a diluent one or more times.<br>
[0055] A first dilution-related method provides the capability to measure the volume<br>
of a sample solution in a vessel over a volume range that is wider than can be measured when<br>
a single light absorbance spectral feature component is employed while also eliminating<br>
uncertainty due to vessel dimension variability. Specifically, the first dilution-related method<br>
for use with a vessel having a bottom and known dimensions, includes the steps of: a) adding<br>
to the vessel a diluent including a known concentration of a diluent dye, resulting in a diluent<br>
with a light absorbance spectral feature at a wavelength unique to the diluent and having no<br>
measurable absorbance at the wavelengths of interest for the sample solution; b) measuring<br>
the absorbance at the wavelength unique to the diluent; c) adding a volume of the sample<br>
solution to the vessel, wherein the sample solution has no measurable absorbance at the<br>
wavelength unique to the diluent, and includes one or more dyes, at known concentration(s),<br>
to establish multiple light absorbance spectral features at a corresponding plurality of<br>
wavelengths; d) mixing the diluent and the sample solution in the vessel to produce a mixture<br>
of the sample solution and the diluent; e) measuring the absorbance of the mixture of the<br>
sample solution and the diluent at all wavelengths; and f) calculating the volume of the<br>
sample solution added to the vessel based on the measured absorbance values.<br>
[0056] Calculating the volume in the first dilution-related method requires that the<br>
volume of diluent added to the vessel be known. If it is not known, it is calculated from the<br>
absorbance per unit pathlength of the diluent at the wavelength unique to the diluent, the<br>
pathlength of light through the diluent as determined using the measured absorbance of the<br>
diluent dye at the wavelength, prior to adding the sample solution to the vessel, and the<br>
dimensions of the vessel. The first dilution-related method includes using the following<br>
equation to calculate the volume:<br>
<br>
where (Vs) is the volume of the sample solution added to the vessel, (Vd) is the volume of the<br>
diluent added to the vessel, (ad) is the absorbance per unit pathlength of the spectral feature in<br>
the diluent, (as) is the absorbance per unit pathlength of a spectral feature of the sample<br>
solution having a measurable absorbance for a volume range, (A?1) is the absorbance of the<br>
spectral feature of the sample solution at a wavelength that is measurable, and (A?2) is the<br>
absorbance of the spectral feature in the diluent at the wavelength distinct from the<br>
measurable wavelength of the spectral feature of the sample solution. That is, the single<br>
sample solution may be used over a broad volume range by providing at least one distinct<br>
light absorbance spectral feature per volume range subset without requiring replacement of a<br>
first sample solution with one known dye concentration with a second sample solution with a<br>
second known concentration of the same dye, which second concentration is greater or less<br>
than the known concentration of the first sample solution. In the example previously<br>
described regarding a sample solution with four dyes, the sample solution may be employed<br>
in the first dilution-related method for volume measurements over a volume range that would<br>
previously have only been achievable with four separate sample solutions, each having a<br>
single distinct light absorbance spectral feature. Similarly, the two-dye sample solution from<br>
above could cover the same volume range because each dye results in two distinct detectable<br>
light absorbance features, for a total of four distinct spectral features in the solution, with<br>
each distinct feature covering a different volume range.<br>
[0057] An additional approach that can be added to this first dilution-related method<br>
is to incorporate multiple dyes into the diluent which impart multiple light absorbance<br>
spectral features to the diluent which are unique to the diluent and different from the light<br>
absorbance spectral features present in the sample solution. The added light absorbance<br>
spectral features of the diluent provide the capability to measure the volume of a sample<br>
solution in a vessel over a volume range that is wider than can be measured when only light<br>
absorbance spectral features in the sample are used. This approach involves the steps of: a)<br>
adding to the vessel a diluent including a known concentration or concentrations of one or a<br>
plurality of diluent dyes, resulting in a diluent with a plurality of light absorbance spectral<br>
features at wavelengths unique to the diluent and having no measurable absorbance at the<br>
wavelengths of interest for the sample solution; b) measuring the absorbance at the<br>
wavelengths unique to the diluent; c) adding a volume of the sample solution to the vessel,<br>
wherein the sample solution has no measurable absorbance at the wavelengths unique to the<br>
diluent, and includes one or more dyes, at known concentration(s), to establish multiple light<br>
absorbance spectral features at a corresponding plurality of wavelengths; d) mixing the<br>
diluent and the sample solution in the vessel to produce a mixture of the sample solution and<br>
the diluent; e) measuring the absorbance of the mixture of the sample solution and the diluent<br>
at all wavelengths; and f) calculating the volume of the sample solution added to the vessel<br>
based on the measured absorbance values.<br>
[0058] A second dilution-related method of the present invention provides the<br>
capability to determine the dilution of a sample solution over a volume range or a dilution<br>
range that is wider than is available in a similar volume or dilution determination when only a<br>
single light absorbance spectral feature can be measured. The sample solution includes a<br>
plurality of dyes and the diluent includes a dye that is the same as one of the plurality of dyes<br>
of the sample solution and is included in substantially the same concentration as in the<br>
sample solution for that common dye. Specifically, the second dilution-related method<br>
includes the steps of: a) measuring in the sample solution the absorbance values of each of<br>
the plurality of spectral features at respective independent wavelengths for which measurable<br>
absorbance values may be obtained, wherein the sample solution is contained in a first vessel<br>
of a plurality of vessels; b) transferring a target volume of the sample solution from the first<br>
vessel to a second vessel of the plurality of vessels; c) mixing into the sample solution in the<br>
second vessel a target volume of the diluent; d) measuring the absorbance values of the<br>
spectral features in the second vessel for which measurable absorbance values may be<br>
obtained, but for which a measurable absorbance must be obtained for the common dye; and<br>
e) calculating a dilution ratio for the sample solution contained in the second vessel, wherein<br>
the dilution ratio represents the extent to which the sample solution has been diluted by the<br>
diluent mixed into the second vessel.<br>
[0059] The calculation of the dilution ratio associated with the transfer of the sample<br>
solution from the first vessel into the second vessel, and then diluting that mixture involves<br>
using the equation<br>
<br>
where (A1,?1) is the absorbance of any of the plurality of spectral features, only of the sample<br>
solution, that provide an absorbance within a defined measurable absorbance range and that<br>
are measured in the first vessel, (A2,?1) is the absorbance of any of the plurality of spectral<br>
features, only of the sample solution, that provide an absorbance within a defined measurable<br>
absorbance range and that are measured in the second vessel, (A1,?2) is the absorbance of the<br>
spectral feature that is common to both the sample solution and the diluent measured in the<br>
first vessel containing only the sample solution, (A2,?2) is the absorbance of the spectral<br>
feature that is common to both the sample solution and the diluent measured in the second<br>
vessel, and (R12) is the dilution ratio.<br>
[0060] The second dilution-related method may be extended across further dilution<br>
steps beyond a transfer from the first vessel to the second vessel by: a) repeating X more<br>
times the steps of i) transferring a target volume of the mixture of the sample solution and the<br>
diluent into a subsequent vessel, ii) mixing in a target volume of the diluent into the<br>
subsequent vessel, and iii) measuring the absorbance values for all spectral features for which<br>
measurable absorbance values may be obtained, wherein X is &gt;1, such that the last vessel of<br>
the plurality of vessels with the mixture of the sample solution and the diluent and the added<br>
diluent is vessel n and a preceding vessel is vessel m; and b) calculating a dilution ratio for<br>
the mixture of the sample solution and the diluent contained in vessel n, wherein the dilution<br>
ratio represents the extent to which the mixture of the sample solution and the diluent has<br>
been diluted by the diluent mixed into vessel n. A running tally may be kept of how much<br>
diluted sample has been added from a preceding vessel into a specific vessel through the nth<br>
delivery based on the dilution ratio. The dilution ratio may be calculated for any number of<br>
dilution steps of a dilution protocol across a relatively larger volume range with the second<br>
dilution-related method of the present invention using the equation<br>
<br>
where (Rmn) is the dilution ratio for the mixture of the sample solution and the diluent in<br>
vessel m after mixing with the diluent in vessel n, (Am?1) is the measurable absorbance of any<br>
of the plurality of spectral features only of the sample solution measured in vessel m, (An,?1) is<br>
the measurable absorbance of any of the plurality of spectral features only of the sample<br>
solution measured in vessel n, (Am,?2) is the absorbance of the spectral feature that is common<br>
to both the sample solution and the diluent measured in vessel m, and (An,?2) is the absorbance<br>
of the spectral feature that is common to both the sample solution and the diluent measured in<br>
vessel n.<br>
[0061] It can be seen that a single sample solution may be diluted over a broad<br>
volume range by providing at least one distinct light absorbance spectral feature per volume<br>
range subset without requiring replacement of a first sample solution with one known dye<br>
concentration with a second sample solution with a second known concentration of the same<br>
dye, which second concentration is greater or less than the known concentration of the first<br>
sample solution. In the example previously described regarding a sample solution with four<br>
dyes, the sample solution may be employed in the second dilution-related method, provided it<br>
also included a fifth dye with a distinct measurable light absorbance spectral feature in<br>
common with the dye of the diluent, to assess dilution over a volume range that would<br>
previously have only been achievable with four separate sample solutions, each having a<br>
single distinct light absorbance spectral feature (again, each being distinct from the light<br>
absorbance spectral feature of the dye in common with the dye of the diluent). Similarly, the<br>
two-dye sample solution example from above could cover the same volume range if a third<br>
dye were added, which third dye would be present in both the sample solution and the diluent<br>
in substantially equal concentrations. In using either a four-dye or a two-dye version of the<br>
invention, this second dilution-related method may be used to reduce uncertainty due to<br>
variable dilution volume, or variable vessel pathlength, for example, when used for testing in<br>
microtiter plates measured using vertical beam spectrophotometers.<br>
[0062] In an example of the second dilution-related method, a single sample solution<br>
and a single diluent could be mixed together and used to calculate the dilution of the sample<br>
solution by the diluent over a complete volume range.<br>
[0063] A third dilution-related method of the present invention provides a capability<br>
similar to that of the second dilution-related method in order to determine the dilution of a<br>
sample solution over a volume range and a dilution range that is wider than is available in a<br>
similar corresponding dilution determination when only a single light absorbance spectral<br>
feature can be measured. The sample solution includes a plurality of dyes and the diluent<br>
includes a dye that is the same as one of the plurality of dyes of the sample solution and is<br>
included in substantially the same concentration as in the sample solution for that common<br>
dye. Specifically, the third dilution-related method includes the steps of: a) transferring a<br>
target volume of the sample solution from a source into a vessel; b) mixing into the sample<br>
solution in the vessel a target volume of the diluent; c) measuring the absorbance values of<br>
the spectral features of the solution in the vessel; and d) calculating a dilution ratio of the<br>
sample solution from the source, wherein the dilution ratio represents the extent to which the<br>
sample solution of the source has been diluted by the diluent mixed into the vessel.<br>
[0064] The third dilution-related method may be extended across further dilution<br>
steps beyond a transfer from the source to a single vessel by: a) repeating X more times the<br>
steps of i) transferring a target volume of the mixture of the sample solution and the diluent to<br>
a subsequent vessel, ii) adding a target volume of the diluent with the known concentration of<br>
the common dye to the mixture of the sample solution and the diluent in the subsequent<br>
vessel and iii) measuring the absorbance values, wherein X is &gt;1, such that any vessel but<br>
the source is vessel m and the source is represented as vessel 0; and b) calculating a dilution<br>
ratio for the sample solution from the source; wherein the dilution ratio represents the extent<br>
to which the sample solution of the source has been diluted by the diluent through all mixing<br>
steps. The dilution ratio may be calculated for any number of dilution steps of a dilution<br>
protocol across a relatively larger volume range with the third dilution-related method of the<br>
present invention using the equation<br>
<br>
where (Rom) is the dilution ratio for the sample solution of vessel 0 after all diluent additions,<br>
(0d) is the absorbance per unit pathlength of the common spectral feature, (as) is the<br>
absorbance per unit pathlength of a spectral feature unique to the sample solution, (Am,?1) is<br>
the measurable absorbance of the spectral feature unique to the sample solution measured in<br>
vessel m, and (Am,?2) is the measurable absorbance of the common spectral feature measured<br>
in vessel m.<br>
[0065] It can be seen that a single sample solution may be diluted over a broad<br>
volume range by providing at least one distinct light absorbance spectral feature per volume<br>
range subset without requiring replacement of a first sample solution with one known dye<br>
concentration with a second sample solution with a second known concentration of the same<br>
dye, which second concentration is greater or less than the known concentration of the first<br>
sample solution. In the example previously described regarding a sample solution with four<br>
dyes, the sample solution may be employed in the third dilution-related method, provided it<br>
also includes a fifth dye with a distinct measurable light absorbance feature in common with<br>
the spectral feature of the diluent, to assess dilution over a volume range that would<br>
previously have only been achievable with four separate sample solutions, each having a<br>
single distinct light absorbance spectral feature (again, each being distinct from the light<br>
absorbance spectral feature of the dye in common with the dye of the diluent).<br>
[0066] In an example of the third dilution-related method, a single sample solution<br>
and a single diluent could be mixed together and used to calculate the dilution of the sample<br>
solution by the diluent over a complete volume range.<br>
[0067] A fourth dilution-related method of the present invention provides a capability<br>
similar to that of the second and third dilution-related methods in order to determine the<br>
dilution of a sample solution over a volume range and a dilution range that is wider than is<br>
available in a similar corresponding dilution determination when only a single light<br>
absorbance spectral feature can be measured. This fourth dilution related method is similar to<br>
the second dilution related method in that it can be used to determine the dilution ratio<br>
between any two steps in a multiple dilution step protocol. However, this fourth approach is<br>
needed because the dilution steps are too large to allow for an accurate determination of the<br>
dilution ratio using equation (0.8). In this fourth dilution-related method, a multi-step<br>
dilution protocol is conducted. The sample solution includes a plurality of dyes and the<br>
diluent includes a dye that is the same as one of the plurality of dyes of the sample solution<br>
and is included in substantially the same concentration as in the sample solution.<br>
Specifically, the fourth dilution-related method includes the steps of: a) transferring a target<br>
volume of the sample solution from a source into a first vessel; b) mixing into the sample<br>
solution in the first vessel a target volume of the diluent; c) transferring a target volume of the<br>
mixed sample and diluent from the first vessel into a second vessel, d) mixing into the<br>
solution in the second vessel a target volume of the diluent, e) measuring the absorbance<br>
values of the spectral features of the solution in the first and second vessels; and f) calculating<br>
a dilution ratio for the sample solution contained in the second vessel, wherein the dilution<br>
ratio represents the extent to which the mixed sample and diluent from the first vessel has<br>
been diluted by the diluent mixed into the second vessel.<br>
[0068] This fourth dilution-related method requires a different calculation because<br>
neither equation (0.8) nor equation (0.9) is capable of determining the described dilution<br>
protocol under all conditions. For example, assume that the delivery of solution from the first<br>
vessel to the second vessel involves a dilution step that is larger than can be measured by any<br>
one absorbance spectral feature. When using absorbance-based dyes, a measurable linear<br>
absorbance can typically only be achieved over a concentration change of 2-3 orders of<br>
magnitude. Thus, assume a scenario where the delivery from the source to the first vessel is<br>
large. In this case, one light absorbance spectral feature, which will be called s is selected for<br>
the analysis. The absorbance per unit pathlength of s is known for the undiluted solution in<br>
the source vessel and is given by as. Since the dilution of the sample solution from the source<br>
vessel to the first vessel is sufficiently large, equation (0.8) cannot be used to determine the<br>
dilution that has been performed because the absorbance associated with s will be too high to<br>
directly measure for the sample solution in the source vessel. However, assuming the<br>
dilution step results in a measurable absorbance associated with s in the first vessel, equation<br>
(0.9) can be used to determine the dilution that has occurred. Now, assume that the dilution<br>
protocol is carried out from the first vessel into the second vessel, and that this dilution step is<br>
also large. In this scenario, the absorbance associated with s is measurable in the first vessel,<br>
but the dilution protocol may have caused the absorbance associated with s to be too small to<br>
be accurately measured in the second vessel.<br>
[0069] Because the absorbance associated with s cannot be accurately measured in the<br>
second vessel, the dilution cannot be determined using any of the equations presented so far.<br>
A new equation needs to be considered for such a scenario, which involves using a second<br>
absorbance spectral feature, which will be called s'. The absorbance per unit pathlength of s<br>
and s' are known for the sample solution in the source vessel, but are sufficiently large such<br>
that the absorbance values of s and s' cannot be directly measured solely for the undiluted<br>
sample solution. As described, the dilution that occurs in transferring the sample solution<br>
from the source vessel into the first vessel results in a measurable absorbance associated with<br>
s. However, in this case, the absorbance associated with s' is still too large to be measurable.<br>
Continuing the protocol between the first vessel and the second vessel results in an<br>
absorbance associated with s that is too small to be accurately measured, but results in a<br>
measurable absorbance associated with s'. For this scenario, the dilution of the sample<br>
solution that occurs between the first vessel and the second vessel can be determined by<br>
dividing the overall dilution between the source vessel and the second vessel by the overall<br>
dilution between the source vessel and the first vessel, as expressed by:<br>
<br>
where (R01) is calculated using equation (0.9) with the first vessel as vessel m, the<br>
wavelength associated with the common spectral feature in the diluent is ?2 and the<br>
wavelength associated with the spectral feature s that is unique to the sample solution is ?1<br>
Similarly, (R02) is calculated using equation (0.9) with the second vessel as vessel m and the<br>
wavelength associated with the common spectral feature in the diluent is ?2 and the<br>
wavelength associated with the spectral feature s' that is unique to the sample solution is ?1.<br>
[0070] The fourth dilution-related method may be extended across further dilution<br>
steps beyond a transfer from the first vessel to the second vessel by: a) repeating X more<br>
times the steps of i) transferring a target volume of the mixture of the sample solution and the<br>
diluent into a subsequent vessel, ii) mixing in a target volume of the diluent into the<br>
subsequent vessel, and iii) measuring the absorbance values for all spectral features for which<br>
measurable absorbance values may be obtained, wherein X is-&gt;l, such that the last vessel of<br>
the plurality of vessels with the mixture of the sample solution and the diluent and the added<br>
diluent is vessel n and a preceding vessel is vessel m; and b) calculating a dilution ratio for<br>
the mixture of the sample solution and the diluent contained in vessel n, wherein the dilution<br>
ratio represents the extent to which the mixture of the sample solution and the diluent has<br>
been diluted by the diluent mixed into vessel n. The dilution ratio may be calculated for any<br>
number of dilution steps of a dilution protocol across a volume range with the fourth dilution-<br>
related method of the present invention using the equation<br>
<br>
where (R 'mm) is the dilution ratio that has occurred as the mixture of sample solution and<br>
diluent is transferred from vessel m and mixed into the diluent in vessel n. This equation is a<br>
quotient of equation (0.9) expressed for the overall dilution from the source vessel, denoted<br>
by the subscript 0, to vessel n, and also equation (0.9) expressed for the overall dilution from<br>
the source vessel to vessel m, which directly precedes vessel n in the dilution protocol. A<br>
more useful form of equation (1.1) can be derived by substitution of the terms in equation<br>
(0.9) and algebraically simplifying to give:<br>
<br>
where (as) is the absorbance per unit pathlength of the spectral feature s, unique to the<br>
sample solution, which results in a measurable absorbance in vessel m, (as) is the absorbance<br>
per unit pathlength of the spectral feature s', also unique to the sample solution but different<br>
than spectral feature s, which results in a measurable absorbance in vessel n, (Am,?s) is the<br>
measured absorbance in vessel m at the wavelength ?s which corresponds to the spectral<br>
feature s of the sample solution, (Am, ?d) is the measured absorbance in vessel m at the<br>
wavelength ?d which corresponds to the spectral feature that is common between the sample<br>
and diluent solutions, (An,?d) is the measured absorbance in vessel n at the wavelength ?d<br>
which corresponds to the spectral feature that is common between the sample and diluent<br>
solutions, (An,?s) is the measured absorbance in vessel n at the wavelength ?s which<br>
corresponds to the spectral feature s' of the sample solution.<br>
[0071] By using a solution containing multiple dyes and multiple light absorbance<br>
spectral features, dilution ratios for all steps of a dilution scheme can be measured using<br>
equations (0.8), (0.9) and (1.2). Not all spectral features will be within the measurable<br>
absorbance range of the spectrophotometer. However, while one spectral feature may result<br>
in measurable absorbance values within the first few dilution steps, another spectral feature<br>
would provide measurable absorbance values only after multiple steps in the dilution scheme<br>
have already been made. Thus, if the dilution method is followed and different spectral<br>
features are used, the accuracy of each step can be determined.<br>
[0072] The present invention may further be used to determine volume through<br>
features associated with a diluent as follows. A method of the invention for determining a<br>
liquid volume of a sample solution in a vessel, wherein the vessel includes a bottom and<br>
known dimensions, involves the steps of: a) adding to the vessel a diluent including a known<br>
concentration or concentrations of one or more diluent dyes, resulting in a diluent with<br>
multiple light absorbance spectral features at a corresponding number of distinct<br>
wavelengths; b) measuring absorbance at one or more of the distinct wavelengths; c) adding a<br>
volume of the sample solution to the vessel, wherein the sample solution has no measurable<br>
absorbance at the distinct wavelengths of the multiple light absorbance spectral features of<br>
the diluent; d) mixing the diluent and the sample solution in the vessel to produce a mixture<br>
of the sample solution and the diluent; e) measuring measurable absorbances of the mixture<br>
of the sample solution and the diluent; and f) calculating the volume of the sample solution<br>
added to the vessel based on the measured absorbances. In this method, the sample solution<br>
may contain no dye or one dye having one light absorbance spectral feature at a<br>
corresponding wavelength distinct from any wavelength of the distinct wavelengths of the<br>
multiple spectral features of the diluent. Alternatively, the sample solution may contain one<br>
or more dyes producing a plurality of light absorbance spectral features at corresponding<br>
distinct wavelengths. The distinct wavelengths of the light absorbance spectral features of<br>
the one or more dyes of the sample solution may all be different from the distinct<br>
wavelengths of the multiple spectral features of the diluent, or one of the distinct wavelengths<br>
of the light absorbance spectral features of the one or more dyes of the sample solution may<br>
be the same as one of the distinct wavelengths of the multiple spectral features of the diluent.<br>

<br>
A system and related method for improved liquid delivery evaluation using a solution containing one or more dyes<br>
such that the solution exhibits multiple distinct detectable light absorbance spectral features for calibrating or testing over extended<br>
volume or dilution ranges are described. The system includes: a photometric instrument capable of measuring optical absorbance<br>
at multiple wavelengths; one or more sample solutions to be dispensed using the liquid delivery system whose performance<br>
is being tested or calibrated; and vessels optionally pre-filled, or filled by the user, with diluent solution. The sample solutions<br>
contain one or more dyes, chosen so that multiple distinct detectable light absorbance spectral features, such as peaks and/or<br>
valleys and/or plateaus of the solution can be distinguished for volume or dilution ranges of interest. The concentrations of the<br>
dyes may be chosen so that a large volume delivery device is calibrated using a spectral feature in the solution with a low absorbance<br>
per unit pathlength, while a small volume delivery device is calibrated with the same sample solution but using a different<br>
spectral feature with a high absorbance per unit pathlength.</td>
