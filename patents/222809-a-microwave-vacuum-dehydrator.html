The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br><br>
Dated this 27th May, 2006<br><br>
A Microwave Vacuum Dehydrator<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to Vacuum drying of any given material by using microwaves<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to evaporating liquid from a liquid containing material by means of microwave under vacuum conditions.<br>
Still particularly, the present invention seeks to provide self-contained Microwave Vacuum Dehydrator with magnetic placement in order to concentrate the microwave on the target product.<br>
This invention is related to the food, rubber and pharmaceutical industry and is particularly concerned with an apparatus for Microwave Vacuum Dehydrating, in which (i) the flow of the microwaves are directed towards the target item; (ii) the inner side of the apparatus is powder coated, which enhances the effect of microwaves and is useful for obtaining a dried end-product; (iii) the vacuum conditions are created via a Nozzle which is perforated at the mouth part which is visible in the Main Chamber and (iv) the sucked air from the Main Chamber is passed through a Side Chamber containing Silica gel.<br>
2<br><br>
The technique of dehydration is probably the oldest method of food preservation practiced by mankind. The use of artificial drying to preserve agricultural products has expanded widely, creating a need for more rapid drying techniques and methods that reduce the large amount of energy required in drying processes. New and/or innovative techniques that increase drying rates and enhance product quality have achieved considerable attention.<br>
Use of microwave applied in a vacuum for dehydration heats the product to cause water to vaporize, without causing changes in composition. Microwave energy penetrates deeply into the material and can reduce process time phenomenonly. It offers opportunity to process material like food, rubber and pharmaceutical products, among other things, in ways not possible by other means. Microwave heating offers distinct benefits in dehydration because the penetration of energy and uniform heating results in water vaporizing from throughout the product. This induces an inner pressure that maintains puffed character of the dried product and preserves colour, flavor, and nutritional value.<br>
Application of microwave energy in a vacuum results in an increase in product temperature; however, the temperature rise is limited to the boiling point of the water. At a pressure of 3 kPa, free water boils at 22Â°C. This maintains a product temperature at a level below the temperature used under atmospheric conditions of 101 kpa.<br>

7<br><br>
These systems are complex and are lacking in the development of high quality self-contained Microwave Vacuum Dehydrator due to failure to optimise utilization of the microwaves.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Drying is one of the crucial steps in many industries, but especially the food processing and preservation. It is the means of providing dried end product as per the requirement of the particular industry by reducing the moisture content from the material, which is to be dried. In preserving certain products, like grain without deterioration, rubber, or pharmaceutical products, drying is the cheapest among other methods, ie, chemical application and controlled atmosphere storage. Drying methods and operation are rather specific for each kind of material and its use. Skilled operators are often required for the drying operation.<br>
DRYING<br>
Drying has huge applications in the area of food, rubber and pharmaceutical industry. However, one of the best examples of drying could be given in terms of the food industry. Drying is the oldest method of preserving food. The early American settlers dried foods such as corn, apple slices, currants, grapes, and meat. Compared with other methods, drying is quite simple. In fact, you may already have most of the<br>
10<br><br>
equipment on hand. Dried foods keep well because the moisture content is so low that spoilage organisms cannot grow.<br>
Drying will never replace canning and freezing because these methods do a better job of retaining the taste, appearance, and nutritive value of fresh food. But drying is an excellent way to preserve foods that can add variety to meals and provide delicious, nutritious snacks. One of the biggest advantages of dried foods is that they take much less storage space than canned or frozen foods.<br>
Recommended methods for canning and freezing have been determined by research and widespread experience. Home drying, however, does not have firmly established procedures. Food can be dried several ways, for example, by the sun if the air is hot and dry enough, or in an oven or dryer if the climate is humid.<br>
With the renewed interest in gardening and natural foods and because of the high cost of commercially dried products, drying foods at home is becoming popular again. Drying is not difficult, but it does take time and a lot of attention. Although there are different drying methods, the guidelines remain the same. Although solar drying is a popular and very inexpensive method, India does not have a suitable climate for it. Dependable solar dehydration of foods requires 3 to 5 consecutive days when the temperature is 95 degrees F. and the humidity is very low. Solar drying is thus not feasible.<br>
11<br><br>
Drying food in the oven of a kitchen range, on the other hand, can be very expensive. In an electric oven, drying food has been found to be nine to twelve times as costly as canning it. Food dehydrators are less expensive to operate but are only useful for a few months of the year.<br>
THREE CATEGORIES OF DRYING:<br>
Air and contact drying under atmospheric pressure: In air and contact drying, heat is transferred through the foodstuff either from heated air or from heated surfaces. The water vapour is removed with the air.<br>
Vacuum drying: In vacuum drying, advantage is taken of the fact that evaporation of water occurs more readily at lower pressures than at higher ones. Heat transfer in vacuum drying is generally by conduction, sometimes by radiation.<br>
Freeze-drying. In freeze-drying, the water vapour is sublimed off frozen food. The food structure is better maintained under these conditions. Suitable temperatures and pressures must be established in the dryer to ensure that sublimation occurs.<br>
In accordance with one practical embodiments of such a device, this invention envisages the effective use of the Microwaves generated by the Magnetron to save energy, time and money for dehydrating a given product.<br>
12<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will now be explained with reference to figures 1 to 5 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of the Main Chamber, which shows the various components of the Microwave Vacuum Dehydrator with their internal co-relation with other parts and their respective functions.<br>
The Main Chamber shown in the Figure 1 consists of:<br>
a.	A door means<br>
b.	Powder coated inner body<br>
c.	Wave Guide<br>
d.	Poly propylene sheet to cover the Wave Guide<br>
e.	Perforations on mouth of the Nozzle<br>
f.	Circular tray to keep target product.<br>
g.	Magnet<br>
The Main Chamber is constructed having dimensions 200 by 220 by300 mm and is made out of mild steel of 10 gauge thickness. The chamber is constructed by employing arc welding to maintain leak proof conditions within since the Chamber is expected to have desired vacuum conditions. The Chamber has a cavity on the right side for the disbursement of the microwaves within the chamber. To this cavity in the Chamber, another small chamber is attached. This chamber is called the Wave Guide (Fig.l, numeral 5). The main purpose of this Wave Guide is to guiding the flow of the microwaves in desired manner.   In the absence of such Wave Guide, the microwaves<br>
13<br><br>
would concentrate at a particular spot and would result in undesirable hot spots. In layman's term, uneven heating zones are created within the Chamber in absence of the Wave Guide thus creating uneven heating pattern in the product.<br>
For creating vacuum conditions in the Main Chamber there has to be a provision of a Nozzle (Fig.l, numeral 4) from the chamber coming out which goes to the Vacuum Generating Device (Fig.5). If the Nozzle diameter exceeds to around 3-4 cm there are chances of the microwaves entering the Vacuum Generating Device, which would damage the Vacuum Generating Device to a large extent. To avoid such damage and to avoid microwaves entering the Vacuum Generating Device, perforations are enunciated on the mouth of the Nozzle (Fig.2, numeral 3). The microwaves have a wavelength of 1-10 cm. whereas the diameters of the perforations are about 2-3 mm thus offering no chances to the microwaves to escaping through the perforations, which protects the Vacuum Generating Device.<br>
The Main Chamber has door means to enable the user to place the target product in the Main Chamber and then shut the door snug so as to prevent the microwaves from escaping out and to maintain the vacuum conditions inside the Main Chamber. The door has grooves that perfectly match the dimensions of the Main Chamber.<br>
The inner surface of the Main Chamber has to be powder coated (Fig.l, numeral 2) to maximize the effect and facilitate the movement of the microwaves within the Main Chamber and to deflect such waves on the target product so as to optimize the effect of the microwaves in dehydrating the target product.  In the absence of the smooth texture<br>
14<br><br>
the microwaves again result is sparks. It is a well-known property of the microwaves that whenever they come across any rusty metal or metals separated by small distance they produce sparks. Thus, for reflection, the microwaves require a smooth surface.<br>
The Powder coating also provides a hygienic environment and easily cleanable equipment which is an important criterion for food, rubber and pharmaceutical industries. It also gives a pleasing and aesthetic look to the Microwave Vacuum Dehydrator.<br>
The Wave Guide is the orifice from which the microwaves are released into the Main Chamber and is attached to the Main Chamber by spot welding. This type of welding provides smoother joints. Smoother joints are desirable parameters since the absence of smooth joint would create sparks in the Main Chamber. These sparks can be hazardous and can have an ill effect to the product as well as the equipment. The cavity of the Wave Guide has to be sealed with a material, which will allow the entry of the microwaves as well as help in maintaining the vacuum conditions in the Main Chamber. If not sealed, the vacuum conditions are not possible.<br>
A high-grade plastic (polymer), polypropylene, is used to seal the cavity of the Wave Guide (Fig.l, numeral 5). Since the Chamber is made up of mild steel and the cavity of the Wave Guide is sealed by polypropylene, which is a form of plastic, they are stuck by a solution which is called as Cynoacrylate which enhances the sealing of steel and plastic, thus enabling the sticking of plastic on to the metal.<br>
15<br><br>
A Circular Tray (Fig.l, numeral 6)is placed at the bottom of the Main Chamber on which a target product is placed for processing and dehydrating. The size of this Tray is variable factor, which depends upon the capacity and size of the dehydrator.<br>
There is a permanent Magnet placed just below the Circular Tray ((Fig.l, numeral 3) at the bottom of the Main Chamber. The Magnet is so placed that it is actually just below the Circular Tray on which the target product is placed for dehydration. This Magnet could be of desired shape as per the design and shape of the Tray on which the target product is to be placed. This placement of the Magnet attracts the microwaves towards itself thus causing the microwaves to reach the target product and reducing the wastage of such microwaves in the absence of Magnet. In the absence of the Magnet, the microwaves are scattered all over the Main Chamber, which in this case is avoided and thus the microwaves are used to the optimum capacity thus enabling what is claimed.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the set up of the Side Chamber, which shows the various components of the Silica gel compartment and the assembly for the same, which connects this Side Chamber to the Main Chamber and also to the Vacuum creating device.<br>
The Side Chamber shown in the Figure 3 consists of:<br>
a.	Silica gel<br>
b.	Tubes<br>
The Side Chamber consists of a compartment consisting of Silica gel (Fig.3, numeral 2) and tubes attached to this compartment, with one end connecting the Side<br>
16<br><br>
Chamber with the Main Chamber (Fig.3, numeral 1) and the other end of the tube (Fig.3, numeral 3). connecting the side chamber with the Vacuum Generating Device (Fig.5, numeral 2). The main use of this Silica compartment is that it adsorbes (not absorbs) the moisture coming out of the product that needs to be dried. Once the Silica gel is saturated with moisture, the colour of the Silica gel turns from dark blue to white. There is a simple way of regenerating the Silica gel by sun drying it for 4-5 hours. The colour reverts back from white to dark blue. Thus, informing the user that the Silica gel is ready for reuse.<br>
The Main Chamber and the Vacuum Generating Device are thus connected by the Side Chamber with the help of tubes as described hereinabove. The air sucked out of the Main Chamber by the Nozzle is lead to the Side Chamber containing a Silica gel Compartment wherein the moisture from the air is adsorbed by the Silica gel thereby leading the dry air into the Vacuum Generating Device. Thus, Vacuum is generated in the Main Chamber. Then, the Magnetron (Fig.l, numeral 1). starts producing the microwaves, which are lead into the Main Chamber via the Wave Guide, which is sealed by Polypropylene sheet in order to permeate the microwaves but hinder air entering into the Main Chamber. The Magnet placed beneath the Circular Tray attracts the microwaves towards it (and since the target product is placed on the Circular Tray, they are targeted by the microwaves). Thus, due to the placement of the magnets, the microwaves generated by the Magnetron are concentrated within the Main Chamber thereby optimizing the use of the microwaves generated and thereby saving time, energy and money.<br>
17<br><br>
Figure 4 illustrates the composition of the Circuitry which shows the various components of the Microwave Vacuum Dehydrator which, in fact, generate microwaves. The Circuitry as shown in the Figure 3 consists of:<br>
a.	Magnetron<br>
b.	Diode<br>
c.	High voltage transformer<br>
d.	Capacitor<br>
e.	Infrared Temperature detector<br>
In the current invention an electronic tube, the so-called Magnetron, generates an alternating power field. The Magnetron is a diode-type electron tube, which is used to produce the required 2450 MHz of microwave energy (Fig.l, numeral 1 and Fig.4, numeral 4). It is classed as a diode because it has no grid as does an ordinary electron tube. A magnetic field imposed on the space between the anode (plate) and the cathode serves as the grid. While the external configurations of different Magnetrons will vary, the basic internal structures are the same. These include the anode, the filament/cathode, the antenna, and the magnets.<br>
The molecules within the material (viz food, rubber or pharmaceutical product) especially the polar water molecules, but also amino acids, lipids and proteins are forced to align themselves with the rapidly changing alternating electrical field. They oscillate around their axis in response to reversal of the electric field that occurs up to 5 billion times per second. This oscillation creates considerable intermolecular friction that results<br>
18<br><br>
in the generation of heat. Thus, the food is heated from the inside outwards leaving the dishes and the dryer itself cold, because they are not directly heated by microwaves. This is contrary to conventional heating of food, in which heat transfers conventionally from the outer to the inner. In order to avoid interference between different applications of high frequency radio waves a frequency of 2450 MHz, which equals a wavelength of approx. 12 cm, was laid down for industrial and medical use.<br>
The microwaves are produced in Magnetron. This Magnetron works at a 5000 volts D.C. supply. An Indian household supply of electricity is 230 volts A.C. supply. Thus, a user would require a high voltage step up transformer to convert A.C. supply to D.C. supply (Fig.4, numeral 2). . The Capacitor (Fig.4, numeral 1) and the Diode acts as a filter medium for the whole circuit. Magnetron mounting is very important for proper usage of the microwaves. Top mounting or side mounting is preferred.<br>
An infrared temperature detector which is a type of non contact thermometers is also required for measuring the temperature inside the Main Chamber and enable user to control such temperature for the proper use of the Microwave Vacuum Dehydrator.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the Vacuum Generating Device which shows the inter relation of various components of the Microwave Vacuum Dehydrator with their internal co-relation with other parts and their respective functions.<br>
19<br><br>
The target product, from which the moisture/liquid is to be extracted, is placed in the vacuum chamber. The door is shut tight and snug and the Vacuum Generating Device is tuned to the ON mode. The vacuum gauge shows the corresponding reading. Once the desired vacuum is created, the circuit of Magnetron is switched ON which emits the microwaves. Each cycle of microwaves is of 30 seconds. Once a 30 sec cycle is completed, the Magnetron circuit is kept off for 150 sec for proper utilization of the waves. Another reason for running it on an off cycle is the temperature of the substance decreases and the drying takes place uniformly. The same procedure is carried out repeatedly, over the period for some time. The time factor depends upon the amount of moisture to be removed.<br>
