				<td>The present invention relates to a rack for a switchgear cabinet.<br>
The invention relates to a rack for a switchgear cabinet, which may be covered by means of side walls, at least one cabinet door and a lid, and which has a bottom and a top frame, which may be connected by means of vertically extending frame profiles, the top frame having horizontally extending depth and width braces, and the depth and width braces being provided with drain grooves, in which water running off the lid can be collected and removed.<br>
Such a rack is known from EP 0 402 276.  In such racks the top frame comprises two respective depth and width braces.  These are in the form of hollow profile sections, which are connected to one another at right angles at their ends.  A corner connector is provided for connection, to which the depth and width braces can be screwed.  The corner connector part has an outwardly open receiving means into which a second corner connector part can be introduced.  The vertical frame profile is secured to the second corner connector.  The drain grooves of the depth and width braces pass the collected water to the corner connectors.  Here it distributes over the individual corner connectors and then runs in an uncontrolled manner downwards over the vertical frame profile or the associated side walls.<br><br>
The two corner connectors must be carefully sealed from one another and from the depth and width braces, in order to prevent water from penetrating into the interior of the switchgear cabinet.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a rack of the type already mentioned, which in a simple way enables controlled drain of the water from the corner area of the top frame.<br>
This object of the invention is achieved according to the invention in that the drain grooves of adjacent depth and width braces are brought together in the corner area of the rack, and are passed to a drain channel of the vertical frame profile.<br>
The drain grooves are brought together in the corner areas of the top frame, so that specific deflection points are provided for the water.  The corner connection between the mutually-abutting depth and width braces and the vertical frame profiles can thus be separated from the area over which water passes, as the seal surfaces are no longer acted upon by water.  The water is deflected downwards via the drain channel of the vertical frame profile.<br><br>
According to an advantageous development of the invention, the depth and width braces carry a seal web upon which the lid is set in a sealed manner, in that the seal webs are brought together to form a surrounding seal frame at the corners of the seal frame, and in that there connect with the seal webs downwardly directed outer walls, which carry the drain groove.  The drain grooves of the individual depth and width braces extend over the entire circumference of the top frame.  Only in the corner areas of the top frame can water be deflected to the vertical frame profiles.<br>
In a preferred variant of the invention, the drain grooves are in the form of strip-like members, which are connected by one of their broad sides to the depth and width braces, in that the drain grooves are brought together in the corner area of the top frame at their connection point with the depth and width braces, and in that the drain grooves form at their ends an access into the drain channel.  The depth and width braces thus abut directly on one another without the interposition of a corner connector part.  Thus the drain grooves also abut on one another.  From this point introduction into the drain channel is simple.<br>
Access into the drain channel can be designed simply in such a way that the drain grooves formed by the strip-<br><br>
like members are provided on their end faces in the corner area of the top frame with a cut-out.  The cutouts in this case form the access.<br>
In order to form a drain channel, the vertical frame profiles can have on their outer side facing away from the interior of the rack, a profiled external receiving means.  This external receiving means is bridged over by the side walls or the cabinet door.  Thus the external receiving means serves as a drain channel which is not visible from the exterior.  Additional fitted parts such for example as side wall attachments, hinges or closure mechanisms may also be attached to the external receiving means.<br>
The lid covering the rack can for example be provided with a surrounding downwardly-bent edge.  This leads the water collecting on-the lid into the drain grooves.  It thus serves as a feed device ensuring that the water is always directed into the drain grooves.<br>
A possible design of a rack is characterised according to the invention in that the side walls and/or the cabinet door have an upper horizontal edge, which is located above the drain groove and at a spacing therefrom.  This edge has now two purposes. On the one hand it prevents dirt from penetrating into the drain groove.  On the<br><br>
'other hand the horizontal edge enables an optical closure, so that the drain groove is not visible from the exterior.<br>
If the bottom and top frame of the rack are identical in design, a lower outlay on parts is made possible.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a rack for a switchgear cabinet, which may be covered by means of side walls, at least one cabinet door and a lid, and which has a bottom and a top frame, which may be connected by means of vertically-extending frame profiles, the top frame having horizontally-extending depth and width braces, and the depth and width braces being provided with drain grooves, in which water running off the roof may be collected and removed, characterised in that the drain grooves of adjacent depth and width braces are brought together in the corner area of the rack and are passed to a drain channel of the vertical frame profile.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail in the following with reference to an embodiment given by way of example and shown in the drawing.  Shown are:<br>
Figure 1: a perspective side view of a rack for a<br>
switchgear cabinet, made up of frame profiles,<br>
Figure 2: perspective part view of a corner area of the rack according to Figure 1, with cladding<br>
members mounted. Figure 1 shows a rack for a switchgear cabinet.  The rack<br>
is substantially made up of a bottom frame 10, a top frame 20 and four vertical frame profiles 40.  The vertical frame profiles 40 connect the bottom frame 10 to the top frame 20.  The bottom and top frames 10 and 20 are identical in construction, so that they can be interchanged with one another.<br><br>
The bottom and top' frame 10 and 20 respectively have two depth and two width braces 21 and 22.  The depth and width braces 21, 22 are provided on their profiles facing the interior of the rack with rows of attachment means 23, 24.  The vertical frame profiles 40 are also provided with attachment means 44 facing the interior of the rack. Electrical assemblies or assembly aids, such for example as assembly rails, may be attached to the attachment means 23, 24, 44.<br>
The vertical frame profiles 40 are connected by connectors 30 to the bottom or top frame 10, 20.  The connectors 30 are located in the area of corner receiving means 25 of the bottom or top frame 10, 20.  The vertical frame profiles 40 are attached to the connector 30 for example by means of a screw connection.  For this purpose the vertical frame profiles 40 can be provided at the ends with screw receiving means 41.<br>
As the view in Figure 1 shows, the individual depth and width braces 21, 22 have drain grooves 46.<br>
The arrangement of the drain grooves 46 is clearly shown in Figure 2.  This view shows a detail of the rack according to Figure 1, covered by side walls 60, 70 and a lid 50.  The depth and width braces 21, 22 have an identical cross-section.  Facing the interior of the rack<br><br>
are two inner walls 49.1, 49.2 located on the depth and width braces 21, 22.  The interior walls 49.1, 49.2 merge into seal webs 43, 48.  The seal webs 43, 48 are bent over outwards at right angles from the interior walls 49.1, 49.2.  Connecting with the seal webs 43, 48 are two outer walls 45, 47.  The outer walls 45, 47 stand parallel to the inner walls 49.1, 49.2.  The drain groove 46 is integrally connected to the outer wall 45.  In this case the drain groove 46 is formed by a strip-shaped member, which is connected by one wide side to the outer wall 45.  This strip-shaped member extends at an angle to the outer wall 45, so that a drain groove 46 results which is V-shaped in cross-section.  The depth and width braces 21, 22 are preferably in the form of stamped and bent parts.  It is however also possible to use an extruded profile.<br>
As the view in Figure 2 also shows, the individual drain grooves 46 are brought together in the corner area of the top frame 20.  At their end faces they are provided with a cut-out 42, so that a common drain results.<br>
At its sides, the lid 50 is bent vertically downwards, so that the edges 51 result.  In the area connecting with the edges 51, the lid 50 is mounted on the seal web 43 of the depth and width braces 21 and 22 with an interposed seal member.<br><br>
The sides of the rack are covered by side walls 60, 70. Instead of the side walls 60, 70, however, cabinet doors can be provided.  The side walls 60, 70 are provided with horizontal and vertical edges 61, 62 or 71, 72.  In order to achieve a seal relative to the top frame 20, seals 64, 74 are provided.  The seals 64, 74 are applied to the inner side of the side walls 60, 70 and abut on the seal webs 48 of the depth and width braces 21, 22.  The horizontal edges 61, 71 of the side walls 60, 70 cover the drain grooves 46.<br>
Only between the edge 51 of the lid 50 and the edges 61, 71 is a narrow slot left free.  The vertical edges 62, 72 of the side walls 60, 70 are brought together, so that the vertical frame profile 40 is not visible.  The outwardly facing side of the frame profile 40 is profiled.  Thus there results between the side walls 60, 70 and the vertical frame profile a drain channel 40.1.<br>
Rain or splashed water collecting on the lid 50 is passed along the edges 51 of the lid 50 into the drain groove 46.  In this drain groove 46 the collected water passes to the corner areas of the top frame 20.  As in the corner areas the cut-outs 42 are provided on the drain grooves 46, the water can be introduced into the drain channel 40.1.  In this drain channel 40.1 the water is<br><br>
passed downwards. 'As the side walls 60, 70 are sealed by means of seals 63, 73 on the vertical frame profile 40, the water cannot pass into the interior of the switchgear cabinet. .<br><br><br><br>
