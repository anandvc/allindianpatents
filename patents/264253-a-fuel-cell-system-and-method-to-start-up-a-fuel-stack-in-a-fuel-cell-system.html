				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SHORTING A FUEL CELL STACK<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a fuel cell system and, more particularly,<br>
to a method for shorting a fuel cell stack in the fuel cell system during a start-up<br>
thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] A fuel cell has been proposed as a clean, efficient and environmentally<br>
responsible power source for electric vehicles and various other applications. In<br>
particular, the fuel cell has been identified as a potential alternative for a<br>
traditional internal-combustion engine used in modern vehicles.<br>
[0003] A common type of fuel cell is known as a proton exchange membrane<br>
(PEM) fuel cell. The PEM fuel cell includes three basic components: a cathode,<br>
an anode and an electrolyte membrane. The cathode and anode typically<br>
include a finely divided catalyst, such as platinum, supported on carbon particles<br>
and mixed with an ionomer. The electrolyte membrane is sandwiched between<br>
the cathode and the anode to form a membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA). The<br>
MEA is often disposed between porous diffusion media (DM) which facilitate a<br>
delivery of gaseous reactants, typically hydrogen and oxygen from air, for an<br>
electrochemical fuel cell reaction. Individual fuel cells can be stacked together in<br>
series to form a fuel cell stack. The fuel cell stack is capable of generating a<br>
quantity of electricity sufficient to power a vehicle.<br>
[0004] During periods of non-operation, a quantity of air diffuses into the fuel cell<br>
stack and accumulates on the anodes. Upon a start-up operation of the fuel cell<br>
stack, hydrogen is supplied to the anodes. The fuel cell stack may be purged<br>
with hydrogen, for example, as disclosed in assignee's copending application<br>
Serial No. 11/762,845, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The<br>
hydrogen displaces the accumulated air and creates a "hydrogen-air front" that<br>
travels along the anodes. The hydrogen-air front is known to degrade the fuel<br>
cells and impact fuel cell stack performance. In particular, the presence of both<br><br>
hydrogen and air on the anodes results in a localized electrical short between a<br>
portion of the anodes that have hydrogen and a portion of the anodes that have<br>
air. The localized electrical short causes a rapid corrosion of the carbon support<br>
on which the catalyst is disposed. The rate of carbon corrosion has been found<br>
to be proportional to a time that the hydrogen-air front exists and a magnitude of<br>
the localized voltage at the hydrogen-air front. The carbon corrosion reduces the<br>
useful life of the MEAs in the fuel cell stack.<br>
[0005] It is known in the art to short circuit the fuel cell stack during the start-up<br>
operation to minimize the voltage generated by the hydrogen-air front. A typical<br>
system and method for shorting the fuel cell stack is disclosed in assignee's<br>
copending application Serial No. 11/858,974, incorporated herein by reference in<br>
its entirety. In the typical shorting system, an electrical load is used to minimize<br>
the localized voltage during the start-up operation. However, such systems<br>
generally require additional system componentry and may be volumetrically<br>
difficult to package in an engine compartment of a vehicle.<br>
[0006] There is a continuing need for a shorting system that is volumetrically<br>
efficient, less massive, and that employs existing componentry of the fuel cell<br>
system for shorting the fuel cell stack. Desirably, the shorting system enables a<br>
method that minimizes stack degradation by shorting the fuel cell stack during<br>
the start-up operation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] In concordance with the instant disclosure, a fuel cell system and method<br>
that is volumetrically efficient, less massive, and that employs existing<br>
componentry of the fuel cell system to short a fuel cell stack and minimize stack<br>
degradation, is surprisingly discovered.<br>
[0008] In one embodiment, a fuel cell system includes a fuel cell stack in<br>
electrical communication with a power converter. The power converter is<br>
configured to selectively regulate a power of the fuel ceil stack and short circuit<br>
the fuel cell stack as desired.<br><br>
[0009] In another embodiment, a method for starting the fuel cell system includes<br>
the steps of: causing a short circuit of the fuel cell stack by placing the power<br>
converter in a short circuit mode; introducing a hydrogen to the anodes of the fuel<br>
cell stack to displace a quantity of air on the anodes; and placing the power<br>
converter in a power regulation mode. A degradation of the fuel cell stack during<br>
the start-up is thereby militated against.<br>
[0010] In a further embodiment, the power converter is selected from one of an<br>
inverter adapted to convert a direct current (DC) from the fuel cell stack to an<br>
alternating current (AC) and a boost converter adapted to selectively translate a<br>
first voltage of the fuel cell stack to a second voltage. The short circuit mode<br>
includes one of a shoot-through fault of the inverter if the inverter is selected as<br>
the power converter and allowing a current to flow substantially uninterrupted<br>
through the boost converter if the boost converter is selected as the power<br>
converter. The power regulation mode includes one of operating the inverter to<br>
convert a direct current (DC) from the fuel cell stack to an alternating current<br>
(AC) if the inverter is selected as the power converter and operating the boost<br>
converter to translate a first voltage of the fuel cell stack to a second voltage if<br>
the boost converter is selected as the power converter.<br>

[0011] The above, as well as other advantages of the present disclosure, will<br>

hereafter.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not<br>
intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should also be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. In respect of the methods<br>
disclosed, the steps presented are exemplary in nature, and thus, are not<br>
necessary or critical.<br>
[0017] FIG. 1 depicts a fuel cell system 2 of the prior art. The fuel cell system 2<br>
includes a fuel cell stack 4 including a plurality of fuel cells 6. Each of the fuel<br>
cells has an anode and a cathode. The fuel cell stack 4 has an anode inlet 8 in<br>
fluid communication with the anodes adapted to deliver hydrogen 10 thereto.<br>
The fuel cell stack has a cathode inlet 12 in fluid communication with the<br>
cathodes adapted to deliver air 14 thereto. The hydrogen 10 and the air 14 are<br>
employed in an electrochemical fuel cell reaction in the fuel cell stack 4. The fuel<br>
cell stack 4 has a positive terminal 16 and a negative terminal 18.<br>
[0018] A shorting switch 20 is provided in the fuel cell system 2 in electrical<br>
communication with the fuel cell stack 4. The shorting switch 20 is in electrical<br>
communication with the positive terminal 16 and the negative terminal 18. For<br>
example, the shorting switch 20 is in electrical communication with the terminals<br>
16, 18 via a first high voltage bus line 22 and a second high voltage bus line 24,<br>
respectively. The shorting switch 20 is adapted to short circuit the fuel cell stack<br>
4 as desired. As a nonlimiting example, the shorting switch 20 short circuits the<br>
fuel cell stack 4 during a start-up operation of the fuel cell stack 4.<br>
[0019] The fuel cell system 2 may also include at least one additional switch 26 in<br>
electrical communication with the fuel cell stack 4. The additional switch 26 is<br>
adapted to selectively provide electrical current from the fuel cell stack 4 to at<br>
least one electrical load (not shown) such as an electric motor or another<br>
electrical component of an electric vehicle, for example. As nonlimiting<br><br>
examples, known electrical componentry includes air compressors, power<br>
converters, pumps, and heating and cooling devices.<br>
[0020] With reference to FIGS. 2 to 4, various embodiments according to the<br>
present invention are described. For purpose of clarity, like structures from FIG.<br>
1 found in FIGS. 2 to 4 have the same reference numerals and are denoted with<br>
a prime (') symbol.<br>
[0021] As shown in FIG. 2, a fuel cell system 200 includes the fuel cell stack 4' in<br>
electrical communication with a power converter 202. The fuel cell stack 4'<br>
receives the hydrogen 10' via the anode inlet 8' and the air 14' via the cathode<br>
inlet 12'. The positive and negative terminals 16", 18' of the fuel cell stack 4' are<br>
in electrical communication with the power converter 202 via the high voltages<br>
bus lines 22', 24'. The fuel cell system 200 may include the switches 28' in<br>
electrical communication with both the fuel cell stack 4' and the power converter<br>
202. The switches 28' are adapted to selectively provide current from the fuel<br>
cell stack 4' to the power converter 202, as desired.<br>
[0022] The power converter 202 of the present disclosure is configured to<br>
selectively regulate a power of the fuel cell stack 4' when in a normal or power<br>
regulation mode of operation. The power converter also provides the regulated<br>
power to the electrical load, for example, via electrical connections 204. As used<br>
herein, the term power converter includes any device that is configured to<br>
regulate or translate power from one form to another. Suitable examples of<br>
topologies for the power converter 202 include: an inverter for converting a direct<br>
current (DC) to an alternating current (AC); a rectifier for converting AC to DC; a<br>
voltage converter for translating a first voltage to a second voltage such as a<br>
boost converter adapted to translate a voltage input to a greater voltage output;<br>
and a frequency converter for converting an AC of a first frequency to a second<br>
frequency. It should be appreciated that other suitable power conversion<br>
topologies for regulating the power of the fuel cell stack 4' may be employed.<br>
The power converter 202 may be connected in series or in parallel with the fuel<br>
cell stack 4' and the electrical load, depending on the power conversion topology<br>
selected.<br><br>
[0023] A skilled artisan should also understand that conventional power<br>
converters typically have controls, such as dead-time compensation or gate-<br>
signal interlocking, which militate against a short circuit or "shoot-through fault"<br>
and protect the conventional power converter. The power converter 202 of the<br>
present invention, however, is configured to selectively short circuit the fuel cell<br>
stack 4' when placed in a short circuit mode. As a nonlimiting example, the<br>
power converter 202 may include at least one transistor adapted to switch<br>
between an enabled or "on" state and a disabled or "off state, thereby providing<br>
a path for a shorting current to flow therethrough.<br>
[0024] The fuel cell system 200 of the disclosure may include a controller 206.<br>
The controller 206 is in electrical communication with the power converter 202<br>
and adapted to selectively cause the power converter to short circuit the fuel cell<br>
stack 4'. The fuel cell system 200 may also include at least one sensor 208<br>
configured to monitor the fuel cell stack 4'. As a nonlimiting example, the sensor<br>
208 is a voltage sensor in electrical communication with the fuel cell stack 4' and<br>
adapted to measure a voltage thereof. The voltage sensor may further be in<br>
communication with the controller 206, and measurements of the fuel cell stack 4'<br>
voltage employed to control the power converter 202 mode of operation.<br>
[0025] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, the power converter 202 is an inverter<br>
300. The inverter 300 in the power regulation mode is adapted to convert a DC<br>
from the fuel cell stack 4' to an AC. The inverter 300 is in electrical<br>
communication with the electrical load, for example, via the load terminals 301.<br>
The inverter 300 may include a first transistor 302 and a second transistor 304 in<br>
a same inverter phase leg 306. The inverter 300 may include additional<br>
transistors and phase legs employed for conversion of DC to AC in the power<br>
regulation mode of the inverter 300. Although the inverter 300 shown in FIG. 3 is<br>
a three-phase inverter, other suitable inverters 300 may be used as desired.<br>
[0026] A skilled artisan should understand that, when the inverter 300 is in the<br>
power regulation mode, the first transistor 302 and the second transistor 304 are<br>
operated in alternating opposition between the enabled state and the disabled<br>
state to convert DC from the fuel cell stack 4' to AC. The first and second<br><br>
transistors 302, 304 are rapidly switched back and forth in a coordinated manner<br>
known in the art to provide the desired AC output. The frequency of the<br>
switching may be above 10 kHz, for example. In particular embodiments, the<br>
frequency of the switching is about 20 kHz. Other suitable frequencies may be<br>
selected.<br>
[0027] The first and second transistors 302, 304 are simultaneously enabled<br>
when the inverter 300 is placed in the short circuit mode. The shorting current is<br>
thereby allowed to flow substantially uninterrupted through the first and second<br>
transistors 302, 304 and short circuit the fuel cell stack 4'. The voltage of the fuel<br>
cell stack 4' during the short circuit is maintained at substantially zero.<br>
[0028] Referring now to FIG. 4, the power converter 202 of the disclosure may be<br>
a boost converter 400. The boost converter is adapted to selectively translate a<br>
first voltage of the fuel cell stack 4' to a second voltage. For example, the boost<br>
converter 400 boosts a voltage input to a greater voltage output. A current at the<br>
second voltage is then provided to the electrical load via the load lines 402, for<br>
example.<br>
[0029] In a particular embodiment, the boost converter 400 includes a diode 404,<br>
a boost transistor 406, and a resistor 408. Under a "normal" or power regulation<br>
mode of operation, the boost transistor 406 is rapidly switched between the<br>
enabled state and the disabled state, causing an increase in the output voltage<br>
as is known in the art. As a nonlimiting example, a switching rate of the boost<br>
transistor 406 under normal operation is greater than about 10 kHz. In a<br>
particular example the switching rate is greater than about 20 kHz. Suitable<br>
switching rates may be selected as desired.<br>
[0030] When the boost converter 400 is placed in the short circuit mode to short<br>
circuit the fuel cell stack 4', the boost transistor 406 remains switched to the<br>
enabled state. The shorting current is thereby allowed to flow substantially<br>
uninterrupted through the boost transistor 406 and short circuit the fuel cell stack<br>
4'. The voltage of the fuel cell stack 4' during the short circuit is maintained at<br>
substantially zero.<br><br>
[0031] The present disclosure includes a method for starting the fuel cell stack 4'<br>
that militates against a degradation of the fuel cell stack 4' due to a hydrogen-air<br>
front. The method first includes the step of providing the fuel cell stack 4' in<br>
electrical communication with the power converter 202 as described herein. The<br>
short circuit of the fuel cell stack 4' is then caused by placing the power converter<br>
202 in the short circuit mode. The hydrogen 10' is supplied to the anodes of the<br>
fuel cell stack 4'. The hydrogen 10' displaces a quantity of air on the anodes, if<br>
present, and forms the hydrogen-air front that travels along the anodes. The<br>
power converter 202 is subsequently placed in the power regulation mode,<br>
wherein the power converter 202 regulates the power of the fuel cell stack 4'.<br>
[0032] The step of causing the short circuit is typically conducted when the<br>
voltage of the fuel cell stack 4' is below a predetermined voltage limit. Causing<br>
the short circuit when the stack voltage is below the predetermined voltage limit<br>
militates against undesired effects that may impair the power converter's 202<br>
ability to regulate the power of the fuel cell stack 4' in the power regulation mode.<br>
For example, the power converter 202 is placed in the short circuit mode prior to<br>
a supplying of the hydrogen 10' and air 14' to the fuel cell stack 4'. Thus, since<br>
the respective fuels are not present at the anodes and the cathodes of the fuel<br>
cell stack 4', the voltage is essentially zero. The short circuit mode may also be<br>
caused when the voltage of the fuel cell stack 4', as measured by the voltage<br>
sensor, is below the predetermined voltage limit. The predetermined voltage limit<br>
may be selected as desired to militate against the undesired effects on the power<br>
converter 202.<br>
[0033] When the power converter 202 is the inverter 300 described herein, the<br>
step of causing the short circuit further includes the step of enabling the first<br>
transistor 302 and the second transistor 304. The first and second transistors<br>
302, 304 may be enabled substantially simultaneously. Similarly, when the<br>
power converter 202 is the boost converter 400, the step of causing the short<br>
circuit includes the step of enabling the boost transistor 406. The shorting<br>
current is thereby allowed to flow substantially uninterrupted through the power<br>
converter 202, and short circuit the fuel cell stack 4'.<br><br>
[0034] The step of placing the power converter 202 in the power regulation mode<br>
may be performed when the voltage of the fuel cell stack 4' is greater than the<br>
predetermined voltage limit. As a nonlimiting example, the power converter 202<br>
may be placed in the power regulation mode when the hydrogen 10' has<br>
substantially filled the anodes of the fuel cell stack 4'. When the hydrogen 10'<br>
has substantially filled the anodes, the hydrogen-air front created by the<br>
introduction of the hydrogen 10' has passed and the accompanying degradation<br>
may no longer occur. The power converter 202 may then be switched from the<br>
short circuit mode, wherein a degradation of the fuel cell stack is militated<br>
against, to the power regulation mode.<br>
[0035] It should be understood that the step of placing the power converter 202 in<br>
the power regulation mode, when the power converter 202 is the inverter 300,<br>
includes the step of operating the first and second transistors 302, 304 in<br>
alternating opposition between the enable state and the disabled state as is<br>
known in the art. The inverter is thereby able to convert DC from the fuel cell<br>
stack 4' to AC. Similarly, when the power converter 202 is the boost converter<br>
400, the step of placing the power converter in the power regulation mode<br>
includes the step of operating the boost transistor between the enabled state and<br>
the disabled state. The first voltage of the fuel cell stack 4' is thereby translated<br>
to the greater second voltage. The regulated power from the fuel cell stack 4'<br>
may then be further supplied to the at least one electrical load as desired.<br>
[0036] It is surprisingly found that the power converter 202, when modified to<br>
operate in the unconventional manner described herein, is employed to militate<br>
against degradation of the fuel cell stack 4' during the existence of the hydrogen-<br>
air front at start-up. As additional shorting equipment is not employed in the fuel<br>
cell system 200 and the method of the disclosure, and since power converters<br>
have been employed in fuel cell systems of the art, a mass and packaged<br>
volume of the fuel cell system may be minimized.<br>
[0037] While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown<br>
for purposes of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the<br><br>
art that various changes may be made without departing from the scope of the<br>
disclosure, which is further described in the following appended claims.<br><br>
