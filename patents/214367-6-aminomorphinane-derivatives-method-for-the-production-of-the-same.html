				<td>This invention relates to 6-amino morphinane derivatives and a method for the production of the same.<br>
This invention relates to a class of 6-amino-morphinan compounds which can be used as highly active analgesics. This invention also relates to their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and easily accessible derivatives (e.g. esters or amides of the amino acid derivatives), to a process for their manufacture and their application in the manufacture of pharmaceutical specialities.<br>
The existence of opioid receptors as receptors of the central nervous system (CNS), which transfer an analgesic effect, has been clearly proven. These receptors are subdivided into three subtypes, p, K and 5. Activation of these receptors by opioids results in an analgesic effect. The activation of the |j receptors causes the highest analgesic effect, whereby particularly morphinans with an oxygen function in position 6 (morphine, oxymorphone, hydromorphone, etc.) are used as effective analgesics. In the past a great deal of work has been invested in the structure-activity relationship studies of this class of substance.<br>
In the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1984, 27, pp. 1575-1579 various 14-methoxymorphinan-6-ones with various substituents in position 3 are described. These derivatives exhibit higher analgesic activity than their 14-hydroxy counterparts.<br>
A detailed study of 5-methyloxymorphone (= 14-hydroxy-5-methyldihydromorphinone) is described in Helvetica Chimica Acta (1988, 71, pp. 1801 -1804) which arrives at the result that the introduction of a 5-methyl group reduces the opioid agonistic characteristics of oxymorphone.<br>
A further study on 14-alkoxymorphinan-6-ones is described in Helvetica Chimica Acta 1989, 72, pp. 1233-1239 in which the influence of various substituents in position 3 and of the amino nitrogen was evaluated.<br>
The German disclosure document DE 34 12 727 describes 14-alkoxy-N-methylmorphinan-6-ones (14-0-alkyloxymorphone) with higher activity than their 14-hydroxy counterparts.<br>
Recently the existence of opioid receptors in the periphery has also been detected (e.g. in bones, joints, cartilage, muscles, etc.). It could be shown that analgesia is also imparted via these peripheral opioid receptors (C. Stein, New Engl. J. Med. 1995, 332, pp. 1685-1690). For this, only a slight dose of an opioid (e.g. morphine), which is applied directly into the injured tissue by injection, is necessary. This slight dose does not result in any side effects being imparted by the central nervous system. The analgesic effect has been observed especially during the treatment of inflammation and neuropathic pain (R. Likar et al., Brit. J. Anaesth. 1999, 83, pp. 241-244; V. Kayser et al., Neurosci. 1995, 64, 537-545). The type of application (injection) represents a significant disadvantage of the treatment. Repeated injections into the affected tissue or joint are associated with risks such as bleeding, infections or cartilage damage. Analgesically effective substances, which have only a limited access to the central nervous system (due to the fact that they cannot<br><br>
ss, or pass only to a very small extent, the blood-brain barrier) and which can be administered stemically or orally, are of great interest.<br>
e object of this invention was to produce highly active analgesics which preferably possess restricted access to the CNS and which preferably act peripherally and not centrally and which also can be preferably systemically or orally administeredySubstances showing promise of success in this connection would be ones which indicate an exclusively peripheral analgesic effect, without the side effects which occur with a centrally acting effect.<br>

The compounds of this invention contain pharmaceutically and pharmacologically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I). According to this invention both inorganic and also organic salts are suitable. Examples of suitable inorganic salts for this invention are hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulphates, phosphates and tetrafluoroborates. Possible organic salts are, for example, acetates, tartrates, lactates, benzoates, stearates, pamoates, methane sulphonates, salicylates, fumarates, maleinates, succinates, aspartates, citrates, oxalates, trifluoroacetates and orotates.<br>
Acid addition salts are preferred as conventional pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, particularly preferred are the hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, tetrafluoroborates and trifluoroacetates. X and Y are preferably oxygen. Preferably Ri is alkyl as defined above, in particular methyl or ethyl, whereby methyl is preferred, or cycloalkylalkyi, preferably cyclopropylmethyl. R2 is preferably not H and also not a group which forms an ester unit with X. The other definitions for R2 as defined in Claim 1 are, in contrast, preferred, whereby especially alkyl as defined above is preferred, particularly preferred are methyl, ethyl and propyl, where necessary substituted, e.g. with a phenyl group, for example to produce a 3-phenylpropyl group (i.e., put differently, an arylalkyi group is also preferred for R2, in particular 3-phenylpropyl). Ri and R2 are especially preferably both simultaneously alkyl, in particular either both simultaneously methyl or methyl (Ri) and ethyl (R2). A further preferred combination of Ri and R2 is cycloalkylalkyi, in particular cyclopropylmethyl for Ri and arylalkyi, preferably phenylpropyl for R2. R3 and R4 are in each case preferably hydrogen or alkyl, whereby methyl is especially preferred as an alkyl group. R4 is in addition preferred as C(N-Boc)(NH-Boc). R5 and Re are preferably chosen such that one is H and the other is different to H, whereby this radical,<br><br>
different to H, is preferably not halogenated. R5 and Re are preferably selected, independent of one another, from hydrogen, CH2COOC(CH3)3, CH2COOH, CH(CH3)COOC(CH3), CH(CH3)C00H, CH(CH2Ph)COOC(CH3)3, CH(CH2Ph)C00H, C(N-Boc)NH-BOC and C(NH)NH2, whereby Rg is preferably H and R5 is preferably one of the groups mentioned above or is H. Also preferred, R5 and Rg are both H.<br>
In a specially preferred representation X and Y are oxygen. Then preferably, Ri is methyl and cyclopropylmethyl and R2 is alky! and arylalkyi, in particular methyl and 3-phenylpropyl, and R3, R4 and Rg are hydrogen. Preferably, R5 is then chosen as tert.-butoxycarbonylmethyl, hydroxycarbonylmethyl, 2-(tert.-butoxycarbonylethyl), 2-(hydroxycarbonylethyl), 2-(tert.-butoxycarbonyl-1-phenylethyl), 2-(hydroxycarbonyl-2-phenylethyl), hydrogen, benzyl (in this case Re is also a benzyl group), N,N"-bis-(tert.-butoxycarbonyl)formamidinyl and formamidinyl.<br>

( It has now been found that the compounds of the pertinent invention represent effective opioid receptor ligands of the type 6-aminomorphinan and exhibit a high therapeutic application potential as analgesics, as immunomodulators with immunostimulating or immunosuppressive effect, as cancer therapeutics, inflammation inhibitors, as anti-rheumatics, diuretics, anorectics, as an agent against diarrhoea, anaesthetics or as neuroprotective active substances, j<br>
(The compounds quoted in the claims are therefore potentially applicable to the treatment of pain, functional intestinal diseases, such as abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction (ileus) or oDStipation, for the treatment of mammals, in particular humans, for the treatment of Raynaud"s disease, for the treatment of complaints caused by vasoconstriction, for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea, angina pectoris, myocardial infarct, emphysema, bronchial spasms, chronic obstructive bronchitis, rheumatic complaints, nephrosis, nephritis in conjunction with rheumatic diseases, for the treatment of tumours, phaeochromocytoma, Addison"s disease, hepatic cirrhosis, chronic inflammation of the small and large intestines (e.g. irritable colon syndrome - colon irritabile, colitis ulcerosa, morbus Crohn), addiction withdrawal of, for example, opiates, cocaine or alcohol, or for the treatment of psychic diseases such as dysphoria or schizophrenia.)<br>
(The compounds of this invention are suitable for application in the production of a medicament for the treatment of pain, including acute and chronic pain, on the locomotor system such as pain in the neck, back, hip, knee, shoulder or myofacial pain, treatment of complex regional pain syndromes, phantom pain, facial neuralgia, rheumatalgia, cancer pain, pain from burns, pain after accidents, pain due to chronic inflammation, visceralgia, headaches such as for example tension headaches, cervically related headache or migraine, pain after central lesions such as for example with paraplegia or thalamic lesions, neuralgic pain such as zoster neuralgia, postzoster neuralgia, ischaemic pain such as angina pectoris or peripheral occlusive arterial disease, postoperative pain, neuropathic pain such as pain with diabetic neuropathy, pain after virus infections or pain after nerve lesions."j<br><br>
/ or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of it as active ingredient together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substance, are suitable for the treatment of the conditions quoted in the description.<br>
The application according to the invention includes application as analgesic, immunomodulating, antitumour, antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, antirheumatic, diuretic, anorectic, antidiarrhoeal, anaesthetic, neuroprotective active substance and as active substance for the prevention and treatment of intestinal obstruction (ileus).<br>
Preferred applications take place for the production of a medicament for the treatment of pain, functional intestinal diseases, of the Raynaud"s disease, for the treatment of complaints caused by vasoconstriction, angina pectoris, myocardial infarct, emphysema, bronchial spasms, chronic obstructive bronchitis, rheumatic complaints (including rheumatoid arthritis, arthrosis, osteoarthritis, spondylosis, lumbago, lupus erythematosus, spondyarthropathy), nephrosis, nephritis in conjunction with rheumatic diseases, for the treatment of tumours, cancer, phaeochromocytoma, Addison"s disease, hepatic cirrhosis, chronic inflammation of the small and large intestines (e.g. irritable colon syndrome - colon irritabile, colitis ulcerosa, morbus Crohn), for the treatment of drug abuse, psychic diseases, erectile dysfunction and / or for the suppression of rejection of transplants after transplantation on mammals, particularly on humans.<br>
Surprisingly it was also found that the compounds of this invention were not capable of overcoming the blood-brain barrier or only to a slight extent, and therefore a special significance could be attributed to them with regard to their application as peripherally effective therapeutics, for example as medicaments for the treatment of pain, rheumatic therapy, suppression of organ rejection after transplantations on mammals, particularly humans and also for the treatment of erectile disturbances. The limited access to the central nervous system is accompanied by a much reduced rate of side effects relating to central side effects such for example nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, confusion, respiratory depression and mania.<br>
In addition, it was surprisingly found that the compounds of this invention have a very long analgesically effective period. This enables a lower dosage and less frequent administration of the medicament, which results in a lower rate of side effects and toxicity as well as a higher readiness of patients to take the medicament.<br><br>

The introduction of a 3-0 protective group in compounds of formula (XXI) is achieved, for example, with benzyl halogenides or triaikyi halogen siianes in solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, acetone or N,N-dimethylformamide or similar in the presence of a base such as sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, triethylamine or similar and therefore compounds of the formula (XXII) are obtained,<br><br>
where Ri and R3 are defined as above; R4 is a protective group such as benzyl, tri-(Ci-C6-alkyl)silyl or tris-(C7-Ci6-arylalkyl)silyl, where aryl is Ce-Cio-aryl and alkyl is Ci-Ce-alkyl.<br>
These 14-hydroxy compounds are following reacted with dialkylsulphates, alkylhalogenides, alkenylhalogenides, alkinylhalogenides, arylalkylhalogenides, arylaikenylhalogenides, arylalkinylhalogenides or chloroformiates in solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or tetrahydrofuran (THF) in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydride, potassium hydride or sodium amide to obtain the compounds of formula (XXIII),<br><br><br>
where R,, R2 and R3 are defined as above (see, for example, formula (IX)), R4 is defined as in formula (XXII). If R2 and R4 are benzyl, compounds of the formula (XXI) can be directly reacted with two equivalents of benzyl bromide in DMF in the presence of sodium hydride, forming 3,14-0-dibenzyl derivatives of the formula (XXIII), in which R2 and R4 are benzyl and Ri and R3 are defined as above.<br>
The acidic splitting of the 3-0 protective group and the keta! function of the compounds with the formula (XXIII) is carried out in one step with an acid such as hydrochloric acid in methanol, tetrafluoroboric acid in dichloromethane, trifluoroacetic acid and compounds of the formula (X) are obtained (see 1st route),<br><br>
in which Ri, R2 and R3 are defined as above.<br>
Alternatively to this, if R4 in the compounds of formula (XXIII) is benzyl, one can, through hydrogenolysis of<br>
the 3-0-benzyl binding with hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst such as Pd/C, PdO, Pd/Al203, Pt/C,<br><br>
followed by acid hydrolysis of the ketal function in position 6 with, for example, methanol and concentrated hydrochloric acid obtain compounds of the formula (X).<br>
The compounds of the formula (X) are reacted corresponding the first scheme via the compounds of the formulae (XI) to (XIV) to the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention.<br>
The following examples describe the manufacture of the compounds according to the invention in detail.<br>

Opioid receptor binding studies<br>
Opioid receptor binding studies were carried out on rat"s brain homogenisates using [""H]DAMG0 (p-receptor agonist) as radio-ligand and with strict conformance to an earlier publication (M. Spetea et al., Neurochemical Research 1998, Vol. 23, pp. 1213-1218).<br>
The compounds 1-4, 7, 8,11, 16, 17, 22, 23 and 38 indicate very high affinity to p-opioid receptors, which are principally responsible for analgesia (Table 1). In comparison to them, morphine clearly indicates lower affinity to p-opioid receptors.<br>

Analgesia test<br>
A test on rats was applied ("rat tail flick test"). This test was carried out as previously described (Zs. FiJrst at al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993, Vol. 236, pp. 209-215).<br>
The compounds 3, 4, 7 and 8 showed a very high analgesic activity. Compound 4 is 68 times as active as morphine after subcutaneous application (sc) and 238 times as active as morphine after intracerebroventricular application (icv) (Table 2). The high sc / icv ratio figures of Compounds 3, 4, 7 and 8 show that in comparison to morphine these compounds are preferentially distributed in the periphery and also preferentially develop their analgesic effect in the periphery. This means from these figures that Compound 3 can only overcome the blood-brain barrier in a very restricted manner and its effectiveness is therefore primarily evident in the periphery (outside of the central nervous system). This fits in with a very low rate of side effects, which relates to central side effects, such as for example, nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, confusion, respiratory depression and mania.<br>
The Compounds 3 and 4 indicate a substantially longer analgesic effective period than morphine. Whereas the Compounds 3 (0.5 pg / rat) and 4 (0.25 pg / rat) still showed 100% analgesic activity after 120 minutes,<br><br><br>
Example 34<br>
Randall-Selitto Test<br>
The Randall-Selitto Test (L.O. Randall and J.J. Selitto, Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. 1957, Vol. 111, pp. 409-419) was applied to study the analgesic effect on carrageen-induced hyperalgesia on the right hind paw of rats. In this way the "hind-paw withdrawal latency" (HWL; latency period for withdrawing the right hind paw) with mechanical stimulation (e.g. I. Bileviciute-Ljungar and M. Spetea, Br. J. Pharmcol. 2001, Vol. 132, pp. 252-258) is measured.<br><br>
The Compounds 4 and the centrally effective reference substance, 14-methoxymetopone (Zs. FiJrst et a!., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993, Vol. 236, pp. 209-215), both show significant analgesic activity at a dosage in each case of 20 pg / kg after subcutaneous application (a rise in the latency period for withdrawal of the hind paw (HWL) of at least 100% is taken as being significant analgesic activity). Whereas Compound 4 shows a long lasting effect (approx. 14 hours), the effect of 14-methoxymetopone is substantially shorter at 2 hours.<br>
The exclusively peripheral analgesic effect of Compound 4 was proved by the following test. The analgesic effect of Compound 4 (20 pg / kg) was completely neutralised by subcutaneous application of the selectively peripherally acting opioid antagonist naloxone methiodide (an equivalent), whereas the analgesic effect of the 14-methoxymetopone (20 pg / kg) through subcutaneous application of the selectively peripherally acting opioid antagonist naloxone methiodide (an equivalent) was not affected. This is proof that the analgesic effect of Compound 4 is passed via peripheral opioid receptors, whereas the analgesic effect of the 14-methoxymetopone is passed via opioid receptors of the central nervous system. This leads to the conclusion that Compound 4 cannot overcome the blood-brain barrier and therefore cannot show any side effects passed through the central nervous system (e.g. respiratory depression, dizziness, confusion, sedation, sleepiness, mania).<br>
Example 35<br>
Respiratory depression test in rats<br>
In this test the respiratory volume and the frequency of respiration of anaesthetised rats was measured.<br>
The Compounds 3 and 4 were examined for their property of being able to cause a respiratory depression (see Table 4). With subcutaneous application (sc) of the Compounds 3 and 4 very high doses were necessary to cause a respiratory depression. Since with intracerebroventricular application (icv) a respiratory depression is caused with substantially lower dosages, very high sc / icv ratios (1205 resp. 1190) result for Compounds 3 and 4. The sc / icv ratios for morphine and fentanyl are noticeably lower (34 resp. 0.2).<br>
Whereas the analgesic ED50 values ("rat tail flick test") are very similar to the ED50 values of the respiratory depression test after intracerebroventricular application, these values are very different after subcutaneous application. If the high ED50 values of the respiratory depression test after subcutaneous application of 3 and 4 are compared with the low ED50 values of the "rat tail flick test" after subcutaneous application, then it can be seen that for Compound 3 a 12 times higher dose is necessary than the analgesic dose in order to initiate respiratory depression. In the case of Compound 4 a dose 18 times higher is required. Analgesic doses of the Compounds 3 and 4 are therefore not able to initiate a respiratory depression.<br><br><br>
^sc = subcutaneous application, ""icv = intracerebroventricular application.<br>

Determination of the antiailodvnic effect<br>
Two tests were carried out on rats:<br>
a)	Von Frey test (mechanical allodynia)<br>
b)	Cold water allodynia test (thermal allodynia)<br>
The tests involve models to test the effect of a substance on neuropathic pain.<br>
For both tests ligations were applied around the ischias nerve (G.J. Bennett and Y.K. Xie, Pain 1988, Vol.<br>
33, 87-107).<br>
a)	Von Frev test (mechanical allodynia)<br>
A slight pressure (2 to 60 g) was exerted on the skin of the hind paw of the rats (200-250 g) using Von Frey hairs and the latency period of withdrawal of the hind paw was studied at various time intervals (5,15, 30 and 60 minutes after the application of the substance). The substance to be investigated was applied via intraplant (ipl).<br>
The Compound 4 shows significant anti-allodynic activity at a dosage of 100 pg / rat after subcutaneous application (a rise of at least 100% in the latency period of the withdrawal of the hind paw is taken as significant anti-allodynic activity). The peripherally acting opioid antagonist naloxone methiodide (ipl) was able to completely neutralise the anti-allodynic effect of Compound 4.<br>
b)	Cold water allodynia test Cthermal allodvnia")<br><br>
Thermal stimulation (cold water) was used to initiate withdrawal of the hind paw of the rats (200-300 g). After 5,15 and 30 min (after application of the substance) the latency period of the withdrawal of the hind paw was studied (J.C. Hunter et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1997, Vol. 324, 153-160). The substances to be investigated were applied via intraplant (ipl).<br>
The Compound 4 shows significant anti-allodynic activity at a dosage of 100 pg / rat after subcutaneous application (a rise of at least 100% in the latency period of the withdrawal of the hind paw is taken as significant anti-allodynic activity). The peripherally acting opioid antagonist naloxone methiodide (ipl) was able to completely neutralise the anti-allodynic effect of Compound 4.<br><br><br>
