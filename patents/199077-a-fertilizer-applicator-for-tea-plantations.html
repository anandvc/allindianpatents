				<td>A FERTILIZER APPLICATOR FOR TEA PLANTATIONS<br>
This invention relates to a mechanical fertilizer applicator which is more efficient and cost affective. Normally fertilizer applicator is done by placement method which mvolves digging a hole with a crowbar and then applying the fertilizer. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tea is grown for the tender growing shoots. The main objective therefore is to suppress the reproductive phase, exploiting the vegetative growth during growing seasons and balancing the harvest of growing points without detriment to the general health of the bushes. Tea flush normally contains 5% Nitrogen (N), 1% Phosphorous (P) and 2% Potassium (K). When this level of nutrient is exhausted these three major nutrients may affect the entire dynamics of crop productivity. It is important that all the nutrients are replaced periodically to get further crop. Manuring in a broader sense is aimed at making available all the essential nutrients deficient in the soil at optimum quantities as demanded by the bushes for a set productivity level. Harvesting and manuring are two most expensive operations in tea cultivation. Manuring in tea constitutes around 17% of the total expenditure. THE CONVENTIONAL FERTILIZER APPLICATOR<br>
Granular inorganic fertilizer used to be applied by making holes of about 25mm diameter on either side of the tea plant to a depth of 150-200mnm with a crowbar. The fertilizer will then be placed inside the hole. This method of application of fertilizer proved to be laborious and time consuming and hence not applied effectively by the workers. This reduced the yield of the plant   by   4-8%.<br><br>
THE PRESENT FERTILIZER APPLICATOR ensures that the full quantity of fertilizer is dispensed with lesser fatigue in a shorter time and greater efficiency thereby improving the efficacy of the fertilizer. This in turn increases the yield of the crop.<br>
The present invention is a fertilizer applicator for tea plantations comprising of a main assembly made of ERW pipe with a sleeve at its top end, a bush lock welded internally to this sleeve and a washer provided on the top end of the sleeve; an angled pipe integrated to the main assembly at its lower end, a pipe (fertilizer) with a funnel at its top end fit into this angled pipe and clamped to the main assembly by means of two clamps with three hexagonal bolts and nuts; a shaft assembly sliding into the main assembly having a rubber handle on the top end, a compression spring just below the rubber handle, a lock pin fixed below the compression spring, the said shaft assembly having a pointed edge in the end and flutes above the pointed edge.<br>

PERFORMANCE OF THE FARTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the accompanying drawings:<br>
(H)     -	Handle made of rubber /PVC provides a hold for the operator to insert<br>
and  withdraw  the  shaft  assembly  (SA)  within  the  main  assembly<br>
(MA).<br>
(CS)   -	Compression spring aids easy withdrawal of the shaft from the main<br>
assembly (MA).<br>
(W)     -	Washer acts as a stopper for the shaft assembly (SA).<br>
(SL)    -	Sleeve has the bush lock   (BL) which prevents further downward<br>
movement of the shaft assembly (SA).<br>
(MA) -	Main assembly is the casing which accommodates the shaft assembly<br>
(SA)  and to  which the  sleeve,  support and angled pipe (AP)  are<br>
integrated.<br>
(CLl, -	Clamps hold the pipe (fertilizer) (PF) to the main assembly (MA)<br>
CL2)	where the funnel (F) is inserted.<br>
(ST)    -	Support holds the main assembly (MA) at its lower end to the angled<br>
pipe (AP) and provides a foot rest for the operator to use pressure<br>
while plunging the fertilizer applicator into the soil.<br><br>
(FLS) -	Flutes   m  the   shaft   facilitate   easy    penetration   into   the soil  and<br>
prevent   clogging   of  the   soil on   the shaft assembly (SA) while<br>
withdrawal.<br>
(AP)   -	Angled pipe acts as a connecting pipe between the pipe (fertilizer)<br>
(PF) and the main assembly (MA) and helps the fertilizer to reach<br>
the hole made by the shaft assembly (SA) directly.<br>
(PF)    -	Pipe (fertilizer) transfers the fertilizer from the funnel (F) to the<br>
angled pipe (AP).<br>
(BN)   -	Bolts and nuts, three in number, aid in tightening the clamps holding<br>
the main assembly (MA) and the pipe (fertilizer) (PF).<br>
(F)      -	Funnel ensures that the fertilizer is put in without wastage.<br>
(BL)   -	Bush lock holds the lock pin (LP) in place thereby ensuring that the<br>
shaft assembly (SA) seats well inside the main assembly (MA).<br>
WORKING OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The shaft assembly (SA) is inserted into the main assembly (MA) by using downward force on the handle (H) thereby compressing the spring (CS) until it rests on the washer (W) of the sleeve (SL). The handle (H) is then turned in a clock wise movement such that the lock pin (LP) in the shaft assembly (SA) gets locked in the bush lock (BL) welded inside the sleeve (SL) of the main assembly (MA). The pipe (fertilizer) (PF) fitted with the funnel (F) is attached to the angled pipe (AP). The fertilizer applicator now assembled as shown in figure 1 is plunged into the soil 150 to 200mm away from the plant to a depth of 150 to 200 mm. The<br><br>
operator while using the fertilizer applicator, applies pressure to the applicator by resting his foot on the support (ST). The shaft assembly (SA) resting inside the assembly (MA), is then withdrawn by turning the handle (H) in an anti-clockwise movement. The lock pin (LP) which is hooked in the bush lock (BL) is then released. The compression spring (CS) aids in withdrawing the shaft assembly (SA). While withdrawing the shaft assembly (SA), the flutes (FLS) at the pointed end of the shaft assembly (SA) helps in releasing any soil particles stuck to the shaft assembly (SA). The hole then formed by the withdrawal of the shaft assembly is filled by the inorganic fertilizer, which is poured in measured quantity into the funnel (F) attached to the pipe (fertilizer) (PF), which in turn is connected to the angled pipe (AP). After dispensing the inorganic fertilizer into the hole made by the applicator, the shaft assembly (SA) is then pushed back into the main assembly (MA) and the handle (H) turned in the clock-wise direction enabling the lock pin (LP) to seat itself in the bush lock (BL). The applicator is now ready for the next operation.<br>
THE   ADVANTAGES   OF   THE   INVENTED   FERTILIZER   APPLICATOR OVER THE EXISTING TYPE<br>
1. Manuring with the conventional type is laborious and time consuming, as the operator has to manually make the hole first in repeated strokes to the required depth and then apply the fertilizer into the hole. The present invention makes it less strenuous for the operator to make the hole in one stroke with the support and the fluted edges, and fill the hole with the fertilizer by withdrawing the shaft assembly.<br><br>
2. Conventionally, the operator uses a crowbar and makes a hole. The fertilizer is put into that hole with hand or some measuring apparatus. This does not ensure the full quantity being dispensed into the hole. The present invention dispenses the measured quantity through the pipe fertilizer and the angled pipe into the hole created by the fertilizer applicator.<br>
3. The present invention increases the crop yield by 5 to 8% than the conventional one as the required quantity of fertilizer is applied to the plant efficiently.<br>
4.  The present invention is cost effective in comparison to the conventional one as coverage of more area can be achieved with less number of operators.<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
This  invention can be used for other plantations like coffee,  sugarcane, cardamom, forestry projects, which required fertilizer to be placed at the root zone.<br>
The terms and expression in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the invention proposed herein are possible without depending on the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br>
