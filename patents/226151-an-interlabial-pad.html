				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
AN INTERLABIAL PAD<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an interlabial pad, which is used in<br>
attachment within female labia, particularly to an interlabial pad, which can be<br>
used together with a sanitary napkin. and to a wrapping body that the interlabial<br>
pad is contained in a package for wrapping it individually.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, a sanitary napkin and a tampon are used generally as<br>
sanitary products for female. However, There have been problems that as for<br>
the sanitary napkin used by bringing into contact with garment, it tencs to cause<br>
the leak of menstrual blood from the gap caused by poor adhesion near the<br>
ostium vaginae. While it tends to cause the foreign feeling and the discomfort<br>
as for the tampon on the basis of the nature of its products, and it is difficult to fix<br>
into the vagina when a user wears it.<br>
Under such situation, senitary products of the interlabia pad have<br>
attracted people as a sanitary product positioned between the sanitary napkin<br>
and the tampon in recent years.<br>
The interlabial pad is used by inserting its portion between the labia and<br>
bringing into contact with the labia, having advantages that it excels in a wear<br>
feeling and is comfortable because of being small as compared with the sanitary<br>
napkin, and it is sanitary ana clean because the range of the body soiled with<br>
menstrual blood is narrow. Moreover, it has characteristics that it is difficult to<br>
cause the leak of menstrual blood because of higher adhesion to the body than<br>
that of the sanitary napkin, and psychological resistance on wearing the<br>
interlabial pad is lower than that of the tampon which is inserted into the vagina.<br>
For example, an interlabial Dad 24 as shown in Fig. 2 includes a pair of<br>
absorbing panels 26, which comes into contact with at least the inner wall of the<br>
labia, and each absorbing panel 26 is bonded its side with each other via a<br>
bonding portion 28. In the interlabial pad 24, the absorbing panel 26 comes into<br>
contact with at least the inner wall of labia and the bonding portion 28 is inserted<br>
into the deepest portion of the labia wnen a user wears cf the pad. The<br>
bonding portion 28 closely contacts with ostium vaginae, thereby the menstrual<br>
blood flowing out of ostium vaginae can be interrupted and absorbed<br>
However, in the interlabiai pad 24 as shown in Fig. 2, due to the less<br>
sealing ability with the deepest portion of the iabia when the user is moving<br>
wearing the pad, there has been a problem of an occurrence of so-called side<br>
leak or a falling of the pad. Since the labia moves in accordance with the<br>
movement of the femoral region, the absorbing panel 26 cooperates with the<br>
action of the femoral region in walking or in exercising. In accordance therewith,<br>
the bonding portion 28 which is bonded with the absorbing panel 26 moves<br>
together, and the bonding portion 28 canrot continue to closely contact with the<br>
deepest portion of the labia and a so called side leak and falling of the pad<br>
occurs.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In respect of problems described hereinbefore, the object of tne present<br>
invention provides an interlabiai pad having a good sealing efficiency with the<br>
deepest portion of the labia when the wearer is in motion and being in capable of<br>
preventing from a risk of a so-called side leak and falling of the pad.<br>
To overcome the aforementioned problems, in the present invention, an<br>
absorbing sheet portion includes: an absorbent body for contacting an ostium<br>
vaginae, which has a stick shape or a strip shape which is an independent<br>
absorbent body, and wnich contacts neighborhood of the ostium vaginae cf a<br>
user: and an absorbent body for contacting with an inner wall of the labia, which<br>
has a flat shape, which is an independent absorbent body, and which contacts<br>
with at least an inner wall of the labia of a user, wherein the absorbent body for<br>
contacting with the ostium vaginae is arranged along a substantial center line of<br>
the body face side of the absorbent body for contacting with the inner wail of the<br>
iabia. Therefore, even though the user moves while wearing the pad, it<br>
provides the good adhesion of the pad with the deepest portion of the iabia and<br>
to prevent the pad from a risk of the so-called side leak or from falling of the pad.<br>
Concretely the present invention provides the interiabial pad as follows;<br>
(1) An interlabial pad for attaching thereto in labia, comprising: an<br>
absorbing sheet portion facing toward a body side upon wearing the interlabial<br>
pad; and a support sheet portion, backing the absorbing sheet portion, wherein<br>
said absorbing sheet portion includes: an absorbent body for contacting a<br>
discharge opening cf body fluid, the absorbent body having a stick shape or a<br>
strip shape, the absorbenr body being an independent aosorbent body, and the<br>
absorbent body contacting with neighborhood of a discharge opening of boby<br>
fluid of a user, and an absorbent body for contacting an inner wall of the labia,<br>
the absorbent body having a flat shape, the absorbent body being an<br>
independent absorbent body, and the absorbent body contacting with at least the<br>
inner wall of the labia of the user, where n the aosorbent body for contacting a<br>
discharge opening of body fluid is disposed along a substantial center line of the<br>
body side surface of the absorbent body for contacting an inner wall of the labia.<br>
The interlabiai pad of the present invention comprises an absorbing sheet<br>
portion and a support sheet portion backing the absorbing sheet portion. The<br>
absorbing sheet portion is arranged to face to the body side while wearing the<br>
pad, for example as shown by Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the sheet portion, has an<br>
absorbent body 43 for absorbing the menstrual blood and a water-permeable<br>
cover sheet 41 for covering surfaces of the absorbent body. On the other hand,<br>
the support sheet portion backs the absorbing sheet portion, as shown in Figs. 3<br>
and 4, has a water-impermeable support sheet 42.<br>
As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the interlabial pads of the present invention<br>
include an absorbent body 43a and an absorbent body 43b, respectively. The<br>
absorbent body 43a is a stick-shaped or a strip-shaped absorbent: body which<br>
contacts the liquid discharging portion of the user, for example, neighborhood of<br>
the ostium vaginae. The absorbent body 43b is a flat shaped independent<br>
absorbent body which contacts with at least the inner wall of the labia of the user.<br>
Further the absorbent body 43a for contacting ostium vaginae is arranged along<br>
a substantial center line 46 of the body face side of the absorbent body 43b for<br>
contacting the inner wall of the labia.<br>
The interlabial pads 44 as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, are folded along the<br>
substantial center line 46 upon wearing it, and the pads are attached to the labia.<br>
The absorbent body 43a for contacting with ostium vaginae closely contact with<br>
the deepest portion including ostium vaginae of the labia, and the absorbent<br>
body 43b contacting with the inner wall of the labia comes to closely contact with<br>
at least the inner wall of the labia and, in some occasion, further with the<br>
pudenda.<br>
In the form, each absorbent body has high degree of freedom and it is<br>
difficult to transmit a behavior of one absorbent body to the other absorbent body<br>
since the absorbent body 43 is separated into the absorbent body for contacting<br>
the ostium vaginae and the absorbent body 43b for contacting the inner wall of<br>
the labia. Therefore, the absorbent body 43b for contacting the inner wall of the<br>
labia moves in accordance with the action of the femoral region in walking or in<br>
exercising, however, the absorbent body 43a for contacting ostium vaginae is<br>
not effected by the movement of the absorbent body 43b and can closely contact<br>
with the deepest portion of the labia. Therefore, in the case of the user moving,<br>
the sealing efficiency between the deepest portion cf the labia and the pad<br>
comes better to prevent a rise of a so-called side leak or falling of the pad also.<br>
Usually, the menstrual blood discharged from ostium vaginae is absorbed<br>
by the absorbent body for contacting with ostium vaginae and closely contacts<br>
with the deepest portion of the labia. Partcularly in the case that the menstrual<br>
blood retention in the uterus or around the uterus cervix (the innermost of ostium<br>
vaginae) is discharged all at once by the user's instant moving, a volume of the<br>
discharged menstrual blood with a high flow speed flows to the downward of the<br>
body (gravitation direction) along the inner wall of the labia. Such rapid and a<br>
volume of menstrua! blood may overflow the absorbing efficiency of the<br>
absorbent body for contacting with ostium vaginae, however, the menstrual<br>
blood can be absorbed by the absorbent body for contacting the inner wall of the<br>
labia which is arranged at the lower end side of the absorbent body for<br>
contacting with the labia. Therefore, the side leak of the menstrual blood can be<br>
prevented.<br>
(2) An interlabial pad according (1), each of the obsorbed body for<br>
contacting a discharge opening of body fluid end the absorbent oody for<br>
contacting an inner wall of the labia is covered by respective, independent cover<br>
sheet.<br>
For example as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. the absorbent body for contacting<br>
ostium vaginae and absorbent body for contacting the inner wall of the labia may<br>
be covered by a single cover sheet 41 As shown in Fig. 5, however, it is<br>
preferable that the absorbent bodies 43a and 43b are respectively covered by<br>
independent water-permeable sheets 41 a, 41 b. In comparison with the case of<br>
the absorbent bodies being covered by a single cover sheet 41, the degree of<br>
the freedom of each absorbent body is increased and it is difficult to transmit a<br>
behavior of one absorbent body to the other absorbent body, thereby The sealing<br>
efficiency of the labia contacting absorbent body 43a and the deepest portion of<br>
the labia while the user moves is improved.<br>
(3) An interlabial pad according to (1) or (2), wherein a bonding area ratio<br>
of the absorbent body for contacting a discharge opening of body fluid and the<br>
absorbent body for contacting an inner wall of the labia is in a range from 2 to<br>
80% in respect of an area in respect of an apparent area of the absorbent body<br>
for contacting a discharge opening of body fluid which is observed from the body<br>
side.<br>
Preferably a rate of the bonding area of the absorbent body for contacting<br>
ostium vaginae and absorbent body for contacting the inner wall of the labia is<br>
from 2 to 80% in respect of an apparent area of absorbent body for contacting<br>
ostium vaginae observed from the body side, more preferably in a range from 3<br>
to 30 %, particularly preferably in a range from 5 to 10%. If the bonding area is<br>
less than the range, the absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae and<br>
absorbent body for contacting the inner wall of the labia are completely<br>
separated by the user's action ana there is a chance of the pad being incapable<br>
of working the function of it. While the area exceeds the range, the freedom<br>
degree of each absorbent body is deteriorated, and a behavior of one absorbent<br>
body may be easily transmitted to the otner absorbent body.<br>
In the specification of the present invention, "the apparent area" means,<br>
as shown in Fig. 6, an area S which is multiplied a maximum length L by a<br>
maximum width W of the ostium vaginae contact absorbent body 43a which is<br>
observed from the body side. The ratio of the bonding area of the absorbent<br>
body 43a and the absorbent body 43b (in the case of each absorbent body being<br>
covered by the cover sheet 41a, 41b, the bonding area of cover sheets 41a, 41b)<br>
in respect of the area S is defined as a bonding area ratio.<br>
(4). An interlabial pad according to any of (1) to (3), wherein a bending<br>
stiffness value toward left and right directions of the corporeal body of a bonding<br>
portion of the absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae and the absorbent<br>
body for contacting an inner wall of the labia at the center portion of the<br>
longitudinal direction of the absorbent body for contacting a discharge opening of<br>
body fluid is not more than 1.5mN.<br>
On the center portion of the longitudinal direction of the absorbent body<br>
for contacting ostium vaginae, the absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae<br>
and absorbent body for contacting the inner wall of the labia connect with each<br>
other, and preferably a value of the bending stiffness to the right and left<br>
direction of the corporeal body of the bonding portion is 1.5mN or less, more<br>
preferably is 1.0mN or less, and furthermore preferably is 0.5mN or less in<br>
particular. If the value exceeds the above-described range, it is caused<br>
possibly that a behavior of one absorbent body is easily transmitted to the other<br>
absorbent body since degrees of freedom of each absorbent body deteriorate.<br>
The value of the bendinc stiffness that is tested by Gurley's Stiffness<br>
Tester which is manufactured by Yasuda Selki Seisakusho is used.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig. 7, the piece including the bonding portion<br>
48 of the labia pad is cut to a size of the vertical direction 25mm and the<br>
horizontal direction 38mm and set in a fastener 47. Each sinker is set to read a<br>
scale at the moment of the piece of the pad leaving from a rotation rod and a<br>
bending stiffness of the horizontal direction is evaluated by a conversion formula.<br>
In this case, the pad piece is set in the fastener 47 side after the other end<br>
portion of the pad piece is so adjusted its length that one end 6.3mm having a<br>
size cf the horizontal direction of 38mm is set in a pendulum 49. Thereby a<br>
bending stiffness of a size of 25mm in the horizontal direction sizes 38mm and<br>
the vertical direction size 25mm can be tested correctly, in case that absorbent<br>
body for contacting ostium vaginae43a and absorbent body for contacting the<br>
inner wall of the labia 43b are bonded with each other at a part of the bonding<br>
portion 48, the length cf 25mm of the pad piece including non-bonding portion is<br>
cut and may be tested as usually. In case of the piece being not entirely bonded,<br>
the bending stiffness of the portion is regarded as zero.<br>
The supplemental sinker is attached to each sinker so that the scale at the<br>
moment of the piece leaving from the rotation rod of the pendulum 49 is from 3 to<br>
6. The switch is pressed and the scale is read at the moment of the piece<br>
leaving from the rotation rod of the pendulum 49. The test is tried at both ends<br>
portions in the horizontal direction described hereinbefore.<br>
The bending stiffness value is obtained by a following conversion formula.<br>
Following values (1), (2) and (3) are multiplied, and further are multiplied by 9.88,<br>
that is;<br>
(1) an average value obtained from the left side scale and the right<br>
side scale,<br>
(2) in case of the position of the hole being 1 inch at the time of<br>
setting the sinker, the vaiue is the weignt [g] of the sinker, in case of it being<br>
2 inches, twice as weight [g] of the sinker, further in case of it being 4 inches,<br>
four times of the weight [g] thereof, each value is respectively adaed and<br>
thereafter obtained value is divided by five, and<br>
(3) the value raised to the second power a substance size 25mm =<br>
1 inch in the horizontal direction is divided by a vertical direction size of<br>
25mm = 1 inch.<br>
Concretely the bending stiffness is calculated by following formula.<br>
Bending stiffness value[mN]={(left+right)/2}x <br>
/5}x{L2[inch]/W[inch]}x9.88x0.009807<br>
(While, "left" means a scale obtained from the left side of the piece of the<br>
pad, "right" means the scale obtained from the right side of the piece, in<br>
case of setting the sinker, (1)[g]means the first 1 inch of the position of<br>
the whole, (2)[g]means 2 inches and (3)[g]means 4 inches, further "L"<br>
means the substance size 1[inch]of the horizontal direction, and "W"<br>
means the size 1 [inch] of the vertical direction.)<br>
(5) An interlabial pad according to any of (1) to (4), wherein the absorbent<br>
body for contacting a discharge opening of body fluid is in a condition that both<br>
ends portions in the longitudinal direction thereof connects with the absorbent<br>
body for contacting an inner wall of the labia and that the center portion is not<br>
bonded with the absorbent body for contacting an inner wall of the labia.<br>
In the interlabial pad of the present invention, for example, as shown in Fig.<br>
8, preferably the absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae43a (or the cover<br>
sheet 41a to cover the absorbent body) is in a condition that both ends portions<br>
50 in its longitudinal direction is bonded with the absorbent body for contacting<br>
the inner wall of the labia 43b (or the cover sheet 41b to cover the absorbent<br>
body), and the central portion 52 is not bonded with absorbent body for<br>
contacting the inner wall of the labia 43b (or ine cover sheet 41b to cover it). As<br>
described hereinbefore, the absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae 43a is<br>
bonded with absorbent body for contacting the inner wall of the labia 43b at the<br>
center of the longitudinal direction of the absorbent body for contacting ostium<br>
vaginae 43a, and the less bending stiffness value of the bonding portion in<br>
lateral direction of the body, the more it is preferable, while the center portion 52<br>
is designed to be in a condition of being non-bonded with absorbent body for<br>
contacting the inner wall of the labia 43b, thereby the bending stiffness value can<br>
be defined zero. In such embodiment, the freedom degree of each absorbent<br>
body is significantly improved that the behavior of one absorbent body can be<br>
surely prevented from transmitting to the other absorbent body.<br>
(6) An interlabial pad according to any of (1) to (5), wherein an elastic<br>
recovery member is disposed along a front and back direction of the corporeal<br>
body of the absorbent body for contacting the discharge portion of the body fluid.<br>
Preferably in the interlabial pad of the present invention, an elastic<br>
recovery member is disposed along the front and back direction of the body side<br>
of the absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae. In this embodiment, the<br>
absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae is put in the labia deepest portion<br>
which has the highest pinching force and further the elastic recovery member is<br>
arranged in the labia deepest portion, thereby the repulsive force of the elastic<br>
recovery member affects to the outer pressure or the pinching force between<br>
labia. Therefore, the absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae can closely<br>
contact with the labia deepest portion continuously by the reaction in order to<br>
prevent the interlabial pad from falling the labia also.<br>
The position where the elastic recovery member is disposed is not limited<br>
particularly as far as being disposed along the front and back of the body side of<br>
the absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae, for example, as shown in Fig.<br>
9, the member Is preferably embedded in an interior of the absorbent body for<br>
contacting ostium vaginae 43a. Thereby the direct transmission of the shape and<br>
the repulsive force of the elastic recovery member 54 to the inner wall of the<br>
labia can be softened by the thickness of the absorbent body for contacting<br>
ostium vaginae 43a, Therefore, the inner wall of the labia is prevented from<br>
receiving the unnecessary pressure and the user is prevented from a foreign<br>
feeling or from damaging the labia. Furthermore if a polymer composition of the<br>
elastic recovery member 54 is dissolved in wearing the labia pad 44, the<br>
absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae 43a absorbs it, thereby the pad of<br>
the present invention is superior in safety for the corporeal body also.<br>
In the specification of the present invention, "elastic recovery member"<br>
means, on a base of its elasticity, a material having flexibility together with a<br>
shape recovery efficiency that the member is deformed by applying a stress and<br>
can recover to the original shape rapidly.<br>
(7) An interlabial pad according to any one of (1) to (6), further comprising<br>
a mini sheet piece bonded on the garment side of the support sheet, the mini<br>
sheet having one or more bonding portion at each side portion in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the support sheet, and having one or more non-bonding portion in<br>
the lateral direction of the support sheet, wherein between the mini sheet piece<br>
and the support sheet, at least one of said one or more non-bonding portion<br>
forms an opening through which the finger is inserted so that the opening of the<br>
finger breadth is directly maintained in a surface direction of the support sheet.<br>
In the interlabial pad of the present invention, for example, as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 10 or 11, a mini sheet piece 62 may be disposed to form a finger insertion<br>
opening 64. In Figs. 10 and 11, in a lateral direction of the support sheet 42, at<br>
least one of both sleeve portions of the mini sheet piece 52 is not bonded with<br>
the support sheet 42 surface. Thereby the opening is formed between one<br>
sleeve side of the mini sheet piece 62 and the support sheet 42 in a non-bonding<br>
condition to form the finger insertion opening 64 wnich is capable of inserting the<br>
finger.<br>
In a longitudinal direction of the support sheet 42, the mini sheet piece 62<br>
is connected with only both lateral sides of the support sheet 42 and is not<br>
bonded (adhered) with the inside thereof. Therefore, the mini sheet piece 62 is<br>
provided from one lateral side of the support sheet. 42 to the other lateral side<br>
thereof in a condition of extending over, Therefore, at the portion such extending<br>
over from one lateral side to the other, penetrating or non-penetrating space<br>
(space for inserting the finger) is formed. Such space can be inserted the finger<br>
and keep it.<br>
The word "finger breadth" of this specification does not mean the<br>
thickness of the finger but the width direction of the finger in the spread direction<br>
of the nail in concrete. "The opening of the finger breadth" means an opening<br>
having a sufficient size for inserting the finger.<br>
The opening of the finger breadth is "directly kept" in a direction of the<br>
support sheet surface. This means that when the user inserts the finger into the<br>
pad normally to wear the pad (the ball of a finger is directed to the garment face<br>
side of the support sheet and is inserted to maintain the condition), the pad itself<br>
is formed to be adequate for inserting the finger preliminarily. Therefore, the<br>
following case excepts from the above described example, such tnat the opening<br>
for the finger breadth is kept in a surface direction by rotating the finger after the<br>
person inserts the finger and the opening for the finger breadth is formed on the<br>
support sheet surface side secondarily.<br>
As described hereinbefore, in the pad provided with the mini sheet piece,<br>
the finger is inserted into the finger insertion opening, thereby the pad can be<br>
kept and fixed at the finger for the time being. In this case, the finger insertion<br>
opening is formed to be the opening for the finger breadth, and the fat-shaped<br>
finger tip is prevented from directing to the different direction in respect of the<br>
support sheet and is inserted to contact with the support sheet surface naturally.<br>
That is, the finger insertion opening has a wide shape in directions of support<br>
sheet surfaces in accordance with the shape of the finger tip of the person to<br>
wear. Therefore, the direction where the finger is inserted is determined to detect<br>
such that the user is intended to a fix point of the pad by the finger tip. Thereby,<br>
as for attaching the pad between labia where the person is difficult to confirm by<br>
eyes, the pad can be attached at the adequate position by correctly holding a<br>
correct attachment point.<br>
Further in the pad of the present invention, not only the peripheral edge<br>
portion of the pad but also the neighborhood to the peripheral edge portion to<br>
which the mini sheet piece can oe connected are included in "the side portion" in<br>
the longitudinal direction of the support sheet.<br>
(8) An interlabial pad according to any one of (1) to (7), wherein tne pad is<br>
used together with a sanitary napkin.<br>
There have been users to use some of sanitary napkins (as referred to a<br>
napkin in following description) laminated with each other for the case of a large<br>
volume of menstrual blood. However, there has been a problem of the bad wear<br>
feeling such as stiff and it is remarkable to wear the pad from the outer of the<br>
garment. To use laminated napkins in the area except ostium vaginae which<br>
does not need to be treated by laminated napkins has caused a rash or a sweat.<br>
However, when the pad and the napkin are used together, the sanitary product is<br>
laminated only around the ostium vaginae, thereby the problem can be solved.<br>
Further only the pad can be altered without changing the napkin, thereby the<br>
person is prevented from always carrying a remarkable size cf napkin.<br>
The sanitary napkin is not only the napkin for absorbing the menstrual<br>
blood in a market but also it may induce ne sheet absorbing the vaginal<br>
discharge.<br>
(9) An interlabial pad according to any one of (1) to (8), wherein the<br>
interlabial pad is a pad for an incontinence of urine.<br>
According to the interlabial pad of the present invention, the pad can be<br>
used as a pad for absorbing incontinence of urine. That is, both ostium vaginae<br>
where the menstrual blood is discharged and a urethral meatus where urine is<br>
discharged locate between the labia, and the interlabial pad of the present<br>
invention to be used between labia can absorb urine also.<br>
As described hereinbefore, the pad of the present invention can absorb<br>
urine around labia, especially around the urethral meatus and is useful for the<br>
absorbing pad for incontinence, especially for a light incontinence.<br>
(10) An interlabial pad according to any one of (1) to (8), wherein the<br>
interlabial pad is a pad for absoroing vaginal discharge.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the interlabial pad can be used<br>
for the pad of absorbing the vaginal discharge. That is, the interlabial pad is<br>
used between labia and can absorb the excretion other than the menstrual blood<br>
from ostium vaginae for the use Therefore, (for absorbing the vaginal discharge).<br>
As described above, the pad can absorb the vaginai discharge in order to<br>
decrease the discomfort for the person, and is useful for the user who is not<br>
menstruating.<br>

through which the finger is inserted faces toward the break seal opening of the<br>
wrapping container.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 12, "to provide the finger insertion opening toward the<br>
break seal opening of the wrapping body" means that when the wrapping body<br>
72 is opened, the mini sheet piece 62 and further the opening 64 for inserting the<br>
finger which is formed by the piece appear, and the finger can be immediately<br>
inserted into the opening 64. For example. as illustrated in Fig. 12, the wrapping<br>
body 72 can be opened by pulling a tub tape 74, which s provided at the upper<br>
surface side of the wrapping container 76, to the right side of the drawing. The<br>
finger insertion opening 64 appears at the opening of the wrapping body to open<br>

Best Mode of Carrying Out the present invention<br>
The preferable embodiment of the interlabial pad in accordance with the<br>
present invention will be described with reference to accompanied drawings. In<br>
the specification of the present invention, the word "bulkiness" means a size of<br>
the direction which the area of the pad projects to contact with an ostium vaginae,<br>
"the width" means a size of the lateral direction of the pad and "the length"<br>
means a size of the longitudinal direction of the pad.<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross section view of a structure of an interlabial pad 14<br>
according to the present invention that (a) shows a top view of the pad and (b)<br>
shows a cross sectional view along line A-A' of (a).<br>
[ (A) Structure of a basic interlabial pad]<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 (a) and 1 (b), a basic interlabial pad 14 of the present<br>
invention includes an absorbing sheet portion and a support sheet portion<br>
backing the absorbing sheet portion. The absorbing sheet portion includes an<br>
absorbent body 13 for absorbing at ieast menstrual blood, the surface of which is<br>
covered by a water-permeable cover sheet 11 if desired, and is used to face<br>
against the body side upon wearing the pad. The absorbing sheet portion is a<br>
stick-shaped or a strip-shaped independent absorbent body and includes an<br>
absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae 13a and an absorbent body for<br>
contacting an inner wall of the labia 13b, wherein the absorbent body 13a<br>
contacts around ostium vaginae of the user and the absorbent body 13b<br>
contacts with at least the inner wall of the labia of the user. The absorbent body<br>
for contacting ostium vaginae 13a is disposed along the substantial center line of<br>
the body face side of the inner wail of the labia absorbent body 13b. While the<br>
support sheet portion 14b comprises a water-impermeable support sheet 12.<br>
The whole configuration of the interlabial pad 14 is eligible as long as it<br>
attaches to the labia, and is not limited to the specific one. However, it is<br>
preferable to form it into a substantial oblong shape, for example, to an elliptic<br>
type, an ovoid type, a gourd-shape, a drop-shape and the like. Preferably the<br>
length of the pad 14 is 50 to 150 mm, more preferably 80 to 120 mm. If the<br>
length is greater than the range, the area exceeding from the labia scrapes with<br>
the napkin and the underwear, and resultantly the friction which is caused by<br>
scrapping to cause a chance of falling of the pad from the labia. If the length is<br>
less than the range, the bonding area with labia surface is also decreased to<br>
cause a chance of falling of the nterlabial pad from labia in accordance with the<br>
movement of the user.<br>
Preferably a width in appearance (the length in the lateral direction) of the<br>
inner wail of the labia absorbent body in respect of the absorbent body for<br>
contacting ostium vaginae from the body side of the absorbent body for<br>
contacting ostium vaginae is in a range from 150 to 600%. Furthermore the<br>
width in appearance of absorbent body for contacting the inner wall of the labia<br>
is from 10 to 60 mm, preferably in a rage from 20 to 40 mm, thereby the<br>
absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae closely contacts with the deepest<br>
portion of the labia and absorbent body for contacting the inner wall of the labia<br>
closely contacts with the inner wall of the labia to cover the outer labia. Such<br>
shape of the pad can absorb the menstrual blood more certainly since the pad is<br>
worn so that absorbent body for contacting the inner wali of the labia comes to<br>
cover the outer labia and the absorbing surface of absorbent body for contacting<br>
the inner wall of the labia is positioned vertically in respect of a rapid and a<br>
volume of menstrual blood which flows to the downward direction of the body<br>
(gravity direction).<br>
The width in appearance of the absorbent body for contacting ostium<br>
vaginae from the body side is preferably in a range from 1.5 to 40mm, more<br>
preferably from 3 to 25mm. If the width is less than the range, there is a chance<br>
of the absorbing efficiency of the absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae<br>
to be deteriorated, while if it is greater than the range, since the contacting area<br>
of the absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae with the inner wall of the<br>
labia will be increased and the behavior change of the inner wall of the labia is<br>
transmitted to the ostium vaginae contacting absorb layer, the sealing efficiency<br>
of the absorbent body for contacting ostium vaginae n respect of the labia<br>
deepest portion may be damaged. The cross sectional shape of the absorbent<br>
body for contacting ostium vaginae is round-shaped, oval-shaped,<br>
triangle-shaped, rectangular-shaped, donuts-shaped (hollow-shaped) and the<br>
like, and not limited particularly, however, it is preferable to be oval-shaped, or<br>
hollow oval-shaped so that the absorbent body closely contacts continuously<br>
sealed with the labia deepest portion during the steps of wearing or in a time of<br>
wearing to progress the pad into the labia.<br>
The size of the absorbent body 13 contained in the cover sheet 11 is<br>
preferably comprised to be smaller from 2 to 10mm than the outline of the cover<br>
sheet 11 in order to prevent the peripheral portion from being hard to deteriorate<br>
the wear feeling at the time of which is contained in the cover sheet 11.<br>
For a method of bonding the absorbent body for contacting ostium<br>
vaginae 13a with absorbent body for contacting the inner wall of the labia 13b (or<br>
the cove' sheets 11a, 11b to cover them), the individual or a combination of<br>
adhering by a heat embossing or an adhesive can be used, in consideration of<br>
using the inierlabiai pad 14 (wet condition by the menstrual blood is<br>
preferable to connect aforementioned each absorbent body (or the cover sheet<br>
to cover them) by a heat embossing or by a combination of the heat embossing<br>
and the adhesive. For the adhesive used for the pad, a pressure sensitive<br>
adhesive made up mainly of a synthetic rubber such as non water soluble<br>
styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SEBS),<br>
styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS), styrene-isoprene-styrene<br>
block copolymer (SIS) and the like, the heat sensitive adhesive made up mainly<br>
of a thermoplastic resin such as ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and the<br>
like, the adhesive made up main:y of water soluble thermoplastic resir (such as<br>
poly vinyl alcohol (PVA)), water sensitive gel made up mainly of a starch glue, or<br>
acrylic acid and comprised of the chemical stimulation the plasticizer or a water<br>
included therein, non water sensitive gel made up mainly of a silicone and<br>
comprised of the chemical stimulation and the plasticizer included therein, are<br>
eligible. For disposing the adhesive, a surface type, a dot type, a mesh type, a<br>
stripe type and the like may be selected accordingly.<br>
[Cover Sheet]<br>
Preferably the cover sheet is selected from water-permeable and<br>
non-stimulate materials. For example a non-woven fabric obtained by a<br>
manufacturing method such as a melt blown, a spun bond, a through air, a point<br>
bond, a needle punch, a spun bond and the like, can be used, while in<br>
consideration of a contacting ratio with the inner wall of the labia, it is preferable<br>
to use an individual or a combination of non-woven fabric obtained by<br>
manufacturing method such as a spun lace, a melt blown, a needle punch and<br>
the like.<br>
It is also preferable to use an individual or a mixed sheet-shaped fiber<br>
which is selected from a rayon, an acetate, a cotton or a pulp such as a natural<br>
fiber, or a single fiber or combined fiber having a sheath-core structure<br>
comprising a synthetic resin, a hydrophilic treated synthetic fiber and the like.<br>
Concretely a spun lace non-woven fabric and the like is eligible so that fibers<br>
mixed with a synthetic fiber in an amount from 10 to 1 % by mass, a natural<br>
cotton in an amount from 4 to 30 % by mass, a rayon or an acetate in an amount<br>
from 60 to 95 % by mass, are adjusted in a range from 20 to 50g/m" based on<br>
the specific per unit area of composition, thereafter fibers are confounded by a<br>
water flow confounding and are dried to adjust the thickness from 0.1 to 1.0 mm.<br>
In order to keep the bulkiness and the distance between fibers in the case<br>
of the cover sheet contacting with the menstrual blood, the synthe:ic fiber is<br>
compounded in the spun lace non-woven fabric. Further the compound ratio of<br>
the synthetic fibers is slightly low, because even though the menstrual blood<br>
wets the sheet, its single fiber strength is maintained and there is a chance of<br>
damaging the inner wail of the labia by high single fiber strength if the synthetic<br>
fiber is compounded more than necessary. It is preferable that the synthetic<br>
fiber is a single fiber such as PR PE, PET and the like, or a fiber formed by a<br>
graft polymer of PE and PP, a compound synthetic fiber having a sheath-core<br>
 structure which the core portion is PP or PET, and the sheath portion is PE, a<br>
decentering-shaped sheath-core structure, a side-by-side structure. Further it is<br>
also preferable to use a milky fiber by mixing filler in an amount from 0.5 to 10 %<br>
by mass which comprises a titanium oxide and a calcium carbonate if desired.<br>
The fiber which is used for aforementioned spun lace non-woven fabric is<br>
a natural cotton having a fiber length in a range from 15 to 60 mm, a rayon or an<br>
acetate having a fiber length in a range from 25 to 51 mm and is selected from its<br>
fineness in a range from 1.1 to 6.6dtex. In this embodiment, the bonding area<br>
with the inner wall of the labia can be increased by using fibers having much of<br>
surface area, and it is preferable to decrease the chance of falling or the pad<br>
from the labia. For example it is preferable to use rayon or acetate having a<br>
different-shaped cross sectional ?orm such as a Y-shaped or C-shaped fiber<br>
cross-section. In comparison with a circular-shaped fiber, in the<br>
different-shaped cross sectional fiber, the surface area is increased and a<br>
clearance between fibers is increased to deteriorate the strength value of the<br>
cover sheet, thereby the sealing efficiency of the pad with the inner wall of the<br>
labia is improved and it is also preferable to decrease a chance of falling of the<br>
pad from the labia or of a leak of the menstrual blood.<br>
For another example of preferable cover sheet, it is eligible to use the<br>
spun lace non-woven fabric in an amount from 20 to 50g/m 2 based on the<br>
specific weight per area of composition which is compounded by a ratio of a<br>
synthetic fiber in an amount from 15 to 5 % by mass, a natural cotton in an<br>
amount from 50 to 10 % by mass, further rayon or an acetate in an amount from<br>
35 to 85 % by mass, which is widened from 10 to 80% in a width direction and is<br>
enlarged from 10 to 80% in a longitudinal direction. This spun lace non-woven<br>
fabric has high rough and fine slope in a plane condition and the confound<br>
between fibers get loose once, thereby each fiber, particularly a synthetic fiber<br>
having a high strength of single fiber is spring backed to have substantial<br>
loop-shaped fibers which protrude to the inner wall of the labia side.<br>
This protruding substantial loop-shaped fiber can soften the frictional<br>
resistance in a shear direction on the inner wall of the labia and the pad surface,<br>
thereby it is not only to decrease a chance of damaging the inter inner wall of the<br>
labia but also to decrease a flow speed of the menstrual blood which flows along<br>
the substantial flat-shaped inner wall of the labia toward the underwear, and the<br>
menstrual blood can be transferred to the absorbent body in an interior of the<br>
pad.<br>
The height and a pitch of the substantial loop-shaped protrusion can be<br>
controlled by changing a widening ratio and a stretch ratio of non-woven fabric,<br>
by changing a confounding force between fibers in accordance with a<br>
manufacturing method of non-woven fabric, or by using a compound synthetic<br>
fiber having a decentering core-shaped sheath-core structure or a side-by -side<br>
structure as a synthetic resin, in which crimp ratio of each single fiber is adjusted<br>
in use of a difference of a heat shrink ratio between resins.<br>
For another example of preferable cover sheet, a thermoplastic film is<br>
perforated by a perforation or a heat press, or a sheet compounded of the film<br>
and the non-woven fabric are eligible. Particularly, the sheet provided with a lot<br>
of raising fine protrusions by a water jet treatment on the non-woven fabric<br>
portion of the compound sheet is preferable. The surface resistance caused by<br>
the protrusion can decrease a flow speed of the menstrual blood on the cover<br>
sheet surface to stop and absorb the flow of the menstrua! blood certainly.<br>
Preferably the height and the distance of protrusions are in a range from 0.1 to 4<br>
mm. If the height is less than the range, the menstrual blood cannot be certainly<br>
absorbed since the clearance of the pad interior into which the menstrual blood<br>
enters comes to be narrow, while if it is greater than the range, there is a chance<br>
of putting the protrusion down by a body pressure in wearing the pad, and these<br>
are not preferable.<br>
The cover sheet may be perforated partially or entirely and the perforation<br>
ratio is preferable in a range from 3 to 30%. If the ratio is less than the range,<br>
an effect of transferring the menstrual blood to the absorbent body side is<br>
deteriorated, while if the ratio is greater than the range, there is a chance of<br>
falling of the pad from the labia due to a deteriorated contact ratio with the inner<br>
wall of the labia, and these are not preferable.<br>
Among the materials, considering the liquid mobility from the inner face of<br>
the labia, chemical stimulation by an activator, and adhesion with the inner waii<br>
of the labia, it is preferable to laminate rayon with 1.1 to 4.4dtex fineness and 7<br>
to 51 mm fiber length by 40 to 80 % of a total specific weight per unit area on the<br>
body face side, and to laminate a mixture of rayon with 1.1 to 4.4dtex fineness<br>
and 7 to 51 mm fiber length by 14 to 42 % of a total specific weight per unit area<br>
and PET with 1.1 to 4.4dtex fineness and 7 to 51 mm fiber length by 6 to 18 % of<br>
a total specific weight per unit area on the garment face side. After laminating<br>
them so that the total specific weight per unit area of the two layers becomes 20<br>
to 60 g/m2, the fibers are entangled by water - flow interlacing treatment and<br>
then dried to prepare spun lace non woven fabric with the thickness of 0.13 to<br>
0.50 mm. The spun lace non woven prepared as described is preferable. At<br>
this time, by mixing PET on the garment face side, bulkiness can be easily<br>
maintained even if the water permeable sheet becomes well. Therefore,<br>
adhesion to the inner wall of the labia can be maintained.<br>
[Absorbent body]<br>
The absorbent body may be capable of keeping and absorbing a liquid<br>
(the menstrual blood) and preferably may be bulkiness, may hard to deform and<br>
may be less chemical stimulation. For example, it adequately compounds of a<br>
particle-shaped pulp, a rayon, an acetate, a natural cotton, a chemical bond<br>
treated air laid pulp, a super absorbent polymer, a fiber-shaped super absorbent<br>
polymer, a synthetic fiber and the like. Further the sheet-shaped absorbent<br>
body is eligible which is the same as described in the cover sheet.<br>
It is preferable for the absorbent body, although any material can be used<br>
as long as it is capable of absorbing and holding liquid (body fluid), to be bulky,<br>
hard - to - be deformed, less chemically stimulant, and highly flexible to fit into<br>
the labia. Specifically, a non woven sheet in which, 50 to 150 g/m2 of pulp<br>
selected from the range of the fiber length of 1 tc 10 mm is laminated on the<br>
garment face side and, on the body face side, 150 to 250 g/m*' of a mixture<br>
obtained by mixing 60 to 90 % of rayon with 1.1 to 4.4dtex fineness and 20 to 51<br>
mm fiber length with 40 to 10 % of natural cotton by this mixing ratio is laminated,<br>
which then to be formed into a sheet by dotted embossing to have 2 to 10 mm<br>
bulkiness, and more preferable to have 3 to 5 mm bulkiness. Thereby, liquid<br>
can be easily transferred from the body face side to the garment face side<br>
resulting in the improvement of the absorbing and holding capacity.<br>
Furthermore, by providing a mesh spun lace non woven fabric of rayon with 1.1<br>
to 4.4dtex fineness and 25 to 51 mm fiber length by a specific weight per unit<br>
area of 15 to 40 g/m2, the liquid transferred from the body face side can be<br>
diffused by the mesh spun lace to be induced to almost a;! over the region of the<br>
pulp layer. Therefore, more liquid can be effectively absorbed.<br>
[Support Sheet]<br>
In case of using the water permeability material, the same material, which<br>
is used for the cover sheet, is eligible. In this case, it prefers to use the pad<br>
together with a sanitary napkin (a pad used together with the sanitary napkin).<br>
Further if non-water permeability material is used, the menstrual blood,<br>
which is kept in the absorbent body, is prevented from a leak out of the interlabial<br>
pad. Furthermore the pad can be comprised of water vapor permeability<br>
material, thereby in wearing the pad, the sweat and the discomfort can be<br>
decreased.<br>
To apply materials of non-water permeability, non-water permeability film<br>
such as a thin filmed synthetic resin of PE, PP and the like, a porous film<br>
comprised that a synthetic resin is filled with inorganic filler and provided with an<br>
extension treatment, a laminate film compound of a paper or non woven fabric<br>
and non-water permeability film, water repellent, a porous resin film is connected<br>
on a rear surface of the non woven fabric of a spun bond or a spun lace which<br>
are treated with a water repellent, are eligible. Further for a method of providing<br>
ventilation on non-water permeability sheet, it is eligible to form a capillary<br>
having 10 to 30% rate of the hole area and a pore size cf 0.1 to 0.6 mm toward<br>
the absorbent body.<br>
More concrete example of applying non-water permeability materials, a<br>
film mainly of a low density polyethylene (LDPE) is eligible which is obtained<br>
from a range of a density 0.900 to 0.925g/cm3, in an amount from 15 to 30g/m2<br>
by mass, based on the total mass per unit area of the composition. The flexibility<br>
not to hurt a wear feeling is considered. More preferably, during the pad is<br>
attached between labia, to decrease a chance of dropping the interiabial pad<br>
from the labia due to the high friction, when non-water permeability sheets are<br>
contacted with each other, with the pad which is used together or with the under<br>
wear, the film is treated an embossing process and the convex upheaval portion<br>
is disposed, thereby it may decrease a ratio contact by less friction drag.<br>
[Elastic Recovery Member]<br>
For the elastic recovery member, a foaming member such as an<br>
elastomer component, polyethylene foam can be used in a single or<br>
compounded in a predetermined ratio. Concretely it is preferable to include an<br>
elastomer compound in an amount from 10 to 90% by mass, preferably from 15<br>
to 60% by mass. It is less than 10% by mass, a sufficient compression<br>
recovery ratio cannot be obtained, while it is greater than 90% by mass, the<br>
compression recovery ratio cannot be significantly improved, and furthermore<br>
there is an inconvenience to be difficult to form a sheet.<br>
For example, polyester type, urethane type, olefin type, styrene type,<br>
polyamide type thermoplastic elastomer, a low density polyethylene using a<br>
rnetallocenes catalyst, ethylene-a'-olefin copolymer are eligible for an elastomer<br>
compound and may be used in a single or be compounded adequately<br>
A compound of aromatic polyester for a hard segment and an amorphous<br>
polyester or aliphatic polyester for a soft segment is eligible for a polyester type<br>
elastomer. A polyurethane elastomer is obtained from a polyester, low<br>
molecular glycol, methylene-bisphenyl-isocyanete and the like and concretely a<br>
polylactone esterpolyol which is added and polymerized polyisocyanete in the<br>
presence of a short chain polyol.<br>
An ethylene-a-olefin random copolymer and diene copolymer as the third<br>
compound polymerised with the copolymer are eligible for an olefin type<br>
elastomer. A block copolymer such as SEBS, SIS, SEPS, SBS are eligible for a<br>
styrene type elastomer. For a polyamide type elastomer, a compound of a nylon<br>
for a hard segment and a polyester or a polyol for as soft segment is eligible.<br>
For a stable molding of elastic member, a high-density polyethylene, a<br>
low-density polyethylene, or line-shaped low density polyethylene may be<br>
compounded in a polymer for an elastomer compound. Further an antiblocking<br>
agent, an ultraviolet absorbent body, a viscosity branch improver, a flatting agent<br>
and other kinds of improver can be compounded.<br>
The elastic recovery member may be fiber-shaped compound. The<br>
fiber-shaped compound can be made from an elastomer composition or<br>
anti-elastomer composition and it is preferable that the obtained elastic member<br>
is superior in compression recovery efficiency and fibers can be melted by a heat<br>
in molding. For anti-elastomer composition in fiber-shaped compound, for<br>
example, a polyester type composition such as polyethylene terephthalate,<br>
polybutylene terephthalate and the like, olefin type composition such as<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene and the like, further nylon, acryl and the like are<br>
eligible. Further an ultraviolet absorbent body, a viscosity branch improver, a<br>
flatting agent, a coloring agent and other kinds of improver may be compounded<br>
in a composition polymer of an anti-elastomer composition.<br>
The cross sectional shape of the elastic recovery member is a<br>
round-shaped, an oval-shaped, a triangle-shaped, a rectangular-shaped, a<br>
donuts-shaped and the like, and not limited particularly, however, the width in<br>
unloading is preferable to be in a range from 1 to 10mm. If the width is less than<br>
the range, the repulsive force of the elastic recovery member in respect of a<br>
pinching force of the labia in wearing the pad is completely softened by the<br>
absorbent body and the chance of dropping off the pad will be increased. While<br>
it is greater than the range, the elastic recovery member is folded in inverse<br>
letter V type in wearing the pad and the buckling repulsive force occurs on the<br>
member. The buckling repulsive force is a force toward one direction and the<br>
force concentrates to the direction, thereby the user comes to have a foreign<br>
feeling, further there is a chance of damaging the labia.<br>
Preferably the amount of the member is in a range from 10 to 100g/m2<br>
based on the total mass of composition. If the amount of the member is less than<br>
the range, the compression recovery ratio or the repulsive force of the elastic<br>
recovery member will be deteriorated and a chance of dropping off the pad will<br>
be increased. While the amount will be greater than the range, the strength of<br>
the pad will be increased to provide the user a foreign feeling.<br>
Preferably the compression recovery ratio of the elastic recovery member<br>
is greater than 50% and the repulsive force is in a range from 490 to 4900Pa in a<br>
time of the compression. If these are less than the range, the repulsive force is<br>
completely softened by the absorbent body. While these are greater than the<br>
range, the inner wall of the labia is pressed unnecessarily to provide the user a<br>
foreign feeling and there is also a chance of damaging the labia.<br>
By using KES compression characteristics FB-3 AUTO-A Tester<br>
(commercial name) of Kato Tech, the compression recovery ratio and the<br>
repulsive force are measured under the condition of setting the test piece cut<br>
into 100mm x 100mm on the testing basement in the terminal area of 2cm', a<br>
maximum load 4900Pa,and a velocity of 50sec/mm.<br>
[Mini Sheet Piece]<br>
The mini sheet piece is a sheet-shaped composition such as a woven<br>
fabric and non-woven fabric, a plastic sheet and is not limited particularly,<br>
however, it is preferable to be a sheet-shaped composition which the surface<br>
bonding area is decreased by a surface uneven process such as embossing, a<br>
pleats and a crater shaped. Further a sheet-shaped composition having an<br>
expand efficiency or an elasticity in a lateral direction is preferable.<br>
A natural fiber such as a cotton, a silk or a linen, a regenerated fiber such<br>
as a regenerated cellulose fiber, rayon, copper ammonia rayon anc the iike, a<br>
synthetic fiber such as polyolefin type fiber, polyester type fiber, poiyamide type<br>
fiber (nylon and the like), polyvinyl alcoholic type fiber, poiyacrylonitrile type fiber,<br>
poiyurethane and the iike are eligible for a mini sheet piece.<br>
Particularly in the case of composing the mini sheet piece by a non-woven<br>
fabric, a web forming may be any of methods such as a dry method (card<br>
method, spun bond method, melt blown method, air laid method) and a wetting<br>
method, or a combination of a plurality of methods. Further a bonding method<br>
is a thermal bonding, a needle punch method and not limited particularly, and<br>
spun lace formed by water confounding method is adequately eligible.<br>
In the case of the mini sheet piece composed by a plastic sheet, a sheet<br>
of the thermoplastic resin (PEE, PP, PET, poiy lactic acid and polybutylene<br>
succinate and the like) and porous foaming sheet and the like are eligible. For a<br>
method of providing an expanding efficiency and a eiasticity to the lateral<br>
direction, a method of composing the mini sheet piece by a fiber sheet and a film<br>
sheet in which a thermoplastic elastomer resin is used, or a method of<br>
composing it by a combination of anti-elastic expanding materia! and an elastic<br>
expanding material such as a thermoplastic elastomer and a natural rubber and<br>
the like are eiigibie.<br>
With respect to the form of the mini sheet piece, for example, as shown in<br>
Fig. 16, it is eligible to form that along the garment face side of the support sheet<br>
42 comprising the interlabial pad 44, the strip-shaped mini sheet piece 62 is<br>
horizontally disposed in the lateral direction of the interlabial pad 44. In this<br>
example, the mini sheet piece 62 is fixed at both side ends of the interiabiai pad<br>
44 and the opening through 64, that is tne finger insertion opening, is formed<br>
toward the longitudinal direction of the interiabiai pad 44.<br>
In the embodiment, when the finger 78 is inserted into the opening<br>
through 64 with contacting a ball of a finger 73 to the support sheet 42, as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 17, the longitudinal direction of the interlabial pad 44 and a<br>
direction of pudendal slit 80, face in the same direction. Therefore, the interlabial<br>
pad 44 can be pushed into the inside of the labia by a ball of the finger 78 so as<br>
to attach the interlabial pad 44 certainly.<br>
Further the mini sheet piece may be formed as illustrated in Fig. 18, that<br>
the support sheet 42 which comprises the interlabial pad 44, is completely<br>
covered from the near central portion in the longitudinal direction to an edge end<br>
82 in the longitudinal direction of the interlabial pad 44. The embodiment<br>
described hereinbefore is preferable for a sanitary handling of the pad so that the<br>
end of the finger 78 is prevented from exposing out of the mini sheet piece 62<br>
and non-contact condition of the menstrual blood and the finger 73 can be<br>
maintained.<br>
For example, as illustrated in Fig. 19, the end of the finger 91 is also<br>
prevented from exposing out of the mini sheet piece 52 by the interlabial pad 44<br>
which a plurality of strip-shaped mini sheet pieces 52 are formed at distance,<br>
thereby the effect of the sanitary handling can be achieved as same as the<br>
interlabial pad 44 as shown in Fig. 18.<br>
For bonding between the mini sheet piece and the support sheet with an<br>
adequate strength, in respect of the bonding strength, it is preferably to set the<br>
breaking strength in a lateral direction of the pad in a range from 0.3 to 1.2<br>
N/10mm. This breaking strength is a strength per a width of 10mm and a value<br>
which is evaluated by a tensilon testing that the mini sheet piece held on the<br>
upper chuck and the support sheet held on the lower chuck with a chuck<br>
distance of 20mm, are pulled by a velocity of 100mm/min.<br>
To achieve an easy identification of the mini sheet piece by the user, the<br>
mini sheet piece can be adjusted to have a different color or design, chromaticity<br>
from the support sheet by coloring or printing patterns.<br>
[Adhered Portion]<br>
For further decreasing the chance of dropping off the pad from the labia,<br>
preferably the adhered portion is formed by coating the adhesive on absorbent<br>
body for contacting ostium vaginae, absorbent body for contacting the inner wall<br>
of the labia, or the surface of the cover sheet to cover them. This adhered<br>
portion is adhered around the labia of the user to decrease the chance of<br>
dropping off the pad.<br>
A dot type, a mesh type, a stripe type and the like are eligible for a way of<br>
arranging the adhered portion. The position of the adhered portion is not limited<br>
particularly, preferably is the place where the pad can be fixed with the body, in<br>
consideration of the neighborhood of the labia, particularly the presence of the<br>
pubic hair in front of the labia, mere preferably to arrange it in a stripe type with a<br>
width from 1 to 5mm or the like near to both sides of the pad.<br>
"Adhered portion" can be formed by coating the adhesive on the surface<br>
side sheet. A gel adhesive comprising of a water-soluble polymer, a<br>
crosslinking agent, a plasticizer and water are eligible for the adhesive. More<br>
concretely, for example of the water soluble polymer, a gelatin, sodium<br>
polyacrylate, polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethylcellulose and the like, for example<br>
of crosslinking agent, calcium chloride, a water soluble metallic salt such as<br>
magnesium sulfate, for example of a plasticizer, glycerin, wax, paraffin and the<br>
like, are eligible.<br>
Other than the above, the pressure sensitive hot melt adhesive can be<br>
used for forming the adhered portion. A pressure sensitive adhesive is made up<br>
mainly of a synthetic rubber such as styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer<br>
(SIS), styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS),<br>
styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SEBS),<br>
styrene-ethylene-propylene-styrene block copolymer (SEPS) and can be<br>
obtained by melting and blending a tackifier such as a terpene resin, a rosin<br>
resin and a plasticizer such as a wax and the like.<br>

type adhesive is made up mainly of a silicone resin and a fluorine resin and is a<br>
compound by blending a crosslinking agent of a metallic salt and the like such as<br>
a platinum, molybdenum, antimony and the like and a plasticizer such as ester<br>
type wax, glycerin, machine oil and the like.<br>
As described hereinbefore, there are many kinds of adhesives to form the<br>
adhered portion, in consideration of the stable coating, it is preferable to use the<br>
pressure sensitive hot melt adhesive. For the pressure sensitive hot melt<br>
adhesive having a high coating stability, the compound by melting and blending<br>

15 to 35% by mass and the tackifier in the amount from 40 to 70% by mass is<br>
eligible. This pressure sensitive hot melt adhesive may be added an antioxidant<br>
or an antifluorescent in the amount from 0.1 to 1.0 % by mass.<br>
The example of the evaluation for the adhesive efficiency will be described<br>
herein below. In the evaluation, the peel strength of the adhesive (Fig. 20) and<br>
the shear strength of the adhesive (Fig. 21) are measured by using a constant<br>
speed extending and tensioning tester and a stainless plate 84 having a length<br>
of 80mm x 50mm. In an evaluation test, preliminarily a polyethylene film 86<br>
having substantially the same size of the stainless plate 84 is coated by the<br>
adhesive 88 to have a width of 25mm and a length of 50mm and are left under<br>
the room temperature (20°C) during thirty minutes. The polyethylene film 86 is<br>
laminated and loaded lightly on the stainless plate 84 to contact the adhesive 88<br>
with the plate 84, thereafter is pressed once (one way) by a pressure force of<br>
30g/cm2 of the roller. Then the plate is left under the room temperature (20°C)<br>
during thirty minutes to obtain a test piece.<br>
The polyethylene film 86 portion of the obtained test piece is extended to a<br>
direction of the arrow A as shown in Fig. 20 and is peeled (180° peeling) in the<br>
peel strength test, and is extended to a direction of the arrow B as shown in Fig.<br>
21 in a shear strength test. However, the piece is extended by a test condition<br>
of the extending speed of 100mrn/min.<br>
Preferably in the case of the measurement described hereinbefore, a<br>
measured value of the peel strength is from 100 to 2000mN/25mm, and a value<br>
of the shear strength is from 3000 to 15000mN/25mm in consideration of a<br>
burden on a skin of the user.<br>
Furthermore preferably the adhered portion is coated by a sheet<br>
comprised of a tissue paper generally used for a separate paper on which<br>
silicone resin is coated and by a sheet comprised of a plastic film on which<br>
silicone resin is coated. Thereby damage and a separation of the adhered<br>
portion during the pads being stored can be prevented.<br>

portion when the user moves and can prevent the chance that the leak of the<br>
menstrual blood or the dropping off of the pad is occurred. Further the interlabial<br>
pad comprises the absorbing sheet portion facing to the body side upon wearing<br>
the pad and the support sheet portion backing the absorbing sheet portion. The<br>
absorbing sheet portion includes the absorbent body (13a) which is a<br>
stick-shaped or a strip-shaped individual absorbent body and contacts with the<br>
neighborhood of the ostium vaginae of the user, the absorbent body (13b) which<br>
is a flat-shaped individual absorbent body and contacts with at least of the inner<br>
wall of the labia of the user, further said absorbent body for contacting ostium<br>
vaginae(13a) is disposed along the substantial center line of the body face side<br>
of absorbent body for contacting the inner wall of the labia (13b).</td>
