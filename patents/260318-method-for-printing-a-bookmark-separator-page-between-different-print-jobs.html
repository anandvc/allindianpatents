				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention in general relates to the Multi Functional peripheral (MFP) devices including printers, scanners, copiers, etc. Further, this invention relates to separation and marking of print jobs in the MFPs. More particularly, this invention relates to a system and method for inserting a bookmark/separator page between two print jobs.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
A bookmark is a strip of material such as ribbon or leather, or a metal clamp, or paper that is placed between the pages of a book by the reader to mark the said place.<br>
The US patent no. 5,120,040 describes a sheet media tray and mechanism for feeding media of two different sizes which allows to have a system wherein two paper trays can be used to feed paper to the printer.<br>
A printer is used to print the documents and obtain a hard copy of the documents. These printouts are collected from the printer out tray. Once all the printed papers have been collected, the user can file them at his convenience for further reference.<br>
To get a printout of a document, the user selects a printer on his system and issues a print job to the printer. In a networked environment there can be multiple users using the same network printer.<br>
In a networked environment where there are a large number of users, it becomes difficult to locate the print outs corresponding to a print job submitted by a user. The user has to go through the entire stack of papers in the printer out tray to locate his print jobs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is to invent a system and method for inserting a bookmark/separator page between two print jobs.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a system and method for inserting a bookmark between two print jobs which will have information about the print job originator, to allow easy segregation of the printouts corresponding to different print jobs.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to invent a system and method which will allow the user to easily identify and pick up the print outs corresponding to the print jobs submitted by him from a network printer used by a large number of users.<br>
The present invention proposes a system and method by which select print jobs can be easily segregated from a stack of print jobs. The present invention will provide for a method for inserting a bookmark/separator page in between two different print jobs. It will also contain information about the owner/ originator of the print job.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention comprises a method for inserting a bookmark/separator page in between two or more different print jobs comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	issuing a print job by the user;<br>
(b)	storing the job originator's information by the printer;<br>
(c)	printing the print job using the paper from the default feed tray/ user defined tray;<br>
(d)	checking the end of print job;<br>
(e)	picking bookmark page from bookmark tray when end of print job is indicated; and<br>
(f)	printing the user information on the bookmark page.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention comprises a system for inserting a bookmark/separator page in between two or more different print jobs comprising:<br>
(a)	means for issuing a print job by the user;<br>
(b)	means for storing the job originator's information by the printer;<br>
(c)	means for printing the print job using the paper from the default feed tray/ user defined tray;<br>
(d)	means for checking the end of print job;<br>
(e)	means for picking bookmark page from bookmark tray when end of print job is indicated; and<br>
(f)	means for printing the user information on the bookmark page<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows a regular conventional bookmark. Figure 2 shows a printer with a tray for placing bookmark papers. Figure 3 shows a stack of paper with bookmarks inserted in between. Figure 4 shows a flowchart for working of the present invention. Figure 5 shows the outline of paper used for bookmark.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art on how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 represents a typical bookmark which is conventionally used to mark the desired part of any book or stack of papers. This bookmark may be a strip of material such as ribbon or leather, or a metal clamp, or paper that is placed between the pages of a book by the reader to mark the said place.<br>
Figure 2 shows a printer with a tray for placing bookmark papers in additional to the tray for placing the papers. Special bookmark pages are kept in one tray, which are to be inserted between any two print jobs. When one job is over, the printer picks a book mark page. Some useful information such as the hostname/ IP address of the originator of the print job is printed on the bookmark page.<br>
Figure 3 shows stack of paper with bookmarks inserted in between. In this invention, a mechanism is devised to add bookmark page from the special tray after every print job that is over and to place the bookmark page on top of the collection of printouts corresponding to that print job.<br>
The printer has a job queue which allows it to identify and separate two jobs from each other. Using this to identify separate jobs after every print job is over before the next print job starts the printer the printer will insert a page in the printed paper stack with the information about the originator of the job.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the mechanism by which the present invention works. First the user issues a print job. Then the printer stores the job originator's information.<br>
After that the printer starts the print job using the paper from the default/feed tray/ user defined tray. Using the papers, the printer prints the job. After that, the printer is checked for the end of print job. If it indicates the end of print job, the printer picks bookmark page from bookmark tray. After that it prints the user information on the bookmark page.<br>
Figure 5 shows the outline of paper used for bookmark. There is a portion of paper which will make the page stand out in a stack of papers. On this portion of the paper, the information about the originator of the print job i.e. the hostname and IP address will be printed for easy identification. Each paper in the bookmark tray will have part labeled "A" spaced at an offset from the same in the previous page.<br>
The system uses an additional paper tray. Special pages (bookmarks) are kept in this tray, which are to be inserted between any two print jobs. The printer intelligently picks a bookmark page when one job is over and prints some useful information such as the hostname/ IP address of the originator of the print job, on the bookmark page.<br>
The bookmark tray provides the book marks to the printer.<br>
The printer includes the intelligence to pick the paper from the bookmark tray for every new print job and provides the information which goes on this bookmark page.<br>
After the printer finishes printing a print job, it is ready to accept and execute a new print job. So, it checks the print job queue for pending print jobs. Prior to checking, accepting and executing pending print jobs (if any) in the print job queue, printer will initiate another print job which will print the information/statistics of the host who had initiated the print job that's just finished. This add-on print job will use the paper from a special tray that will have bookmark pages, for printing the statistics.<br>
For simplicity, let's name the print jobs that are initiated by hosts (that are placed in the print job queue) as "Primary Print Jobs". Now, for printing the information about the hosts who had initiated the aforesaid "Primary Print Jobs", we will have the provision of creating another set of print jobs and let's name these as "Secondary Print Jobs". So, for every "Primary Print Job" in the print job queue, the printer will initiate another "Secondary Print Job" responsible for printing the information about the host of the "Primary Print Job" on bookmark paper picked up from the special tray and this will be done at the end of every "Primary Print Job".<br>
The present invention puts forward the following concepts which have not been used thus far:<br>
•	Using bookmarks to segregate print jobs.<br>
•	Special tray for keeping the bookmark pages. The bookmark pages are different than the standard pages used for printing purpose. The bookmark pages due their different size will stand out in a stack of printouts and thus help in identifying the print job of a particular user.<br>
•	Mechanism to pick up a bookmark page from the special tray after every print job that is over and place the bookmark page on top of the collection of printouts corresponding to that print job. The mechanism/intelligence refers to the ability of a printer to distinguish two jobs and use this information to place a bookmark page before starting a new job.<br>
The invention also uses the conventional printing device to carry out the function of printing along with the new features listed above. The printer will print the print job fired by a host in the traditional manner. Once this is over, the printer will use the new parts to fetch a paper from the bookmark tray and print the information about the host and the IP information of the originator of the job. The new parts include a Special tray for keeping the bookmark pages as mentioned above. The printer's intelligence to pick up paper from this tray has also been described above.<br>
The printer will insert a bookmark/separator page in between two different print jobs. The bookmark will contain information about the hostname / IP address which issued the print job making easy to identify the prints. The page used will be of a different size and would be picked by the printer from a different page tray. The pages used will have a form as shown in figure 5.<br>
Figure 5 indicates the portion of paper which will make the page stand out in a stack of papers. On this portion of the paper the information about the originator of the print job i.e. the hostname and IP address will be printed for easy identification.<br>
Each paper in the bookmark tray will have part labeled A spaced at an offset from the same in the previous page. This will make it even easier to identify print jobs in a stack as they will not come on the top of one another.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted below. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, printer or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood<br>
as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
