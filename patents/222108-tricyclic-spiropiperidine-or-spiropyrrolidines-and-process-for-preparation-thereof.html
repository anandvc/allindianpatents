				<td>Novel  tricyclic spiropiperidines or spiropyrrolidines .<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy.<br>
Chemokines play an important role in immune and inflammatory responses in various diseases and disorders, including asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. These small secreted molecules are a growing superfamily of 8-14 kDa proteins characterised by a conserved four cysteine motif. The chemokine superfamily can be divided into two main groups exhibiting characteristic structural motifs, the Cys-X-Cys (C-X-C) and Cys-Cys (C-C) families. These are distinguished on the basis of a single arnino acid insertion between the NH-proximal pair of cysteine residues and sequence similarity.<br>
The C-X-C chemokines include several potent chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and neutrophil-activating peplide 2 (NAP-2).<br>
The C-C chemokines include potent chemoattractants of monocytes and lymphocytes but not neutrophils such as human monocyte chemotactic proteins 1-3 (MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3), RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted), eotaxin and the macrophage inflammatory proteins la and ip (MIP-lot and MIP-1<br>
Studies have demonstrated that the actions of the chemokines are mediated by subfamilies of G protein-coupled receptors, among which are the receptors designated CCR1 , CCR2, CCR2A, CCR2B, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR4. These receptors represent good targets for drug development since agents which modulate these receptors would be useful in the treatment of disorders and diseases such as those mentioned above.<br>

Other compounds of formula (II) and compounds of formulae (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), (VIII) and (IX) are either commercially available, are known in the literature or may be prepared using known techniques.<br>
For example, compounds of formula (II) in which m is 1, R is chlorine or fluorine, n is 0, q is 1, one of X and Y represents a bond and the other of X and Y represents an oxygen atom and Z represents CH2, may be prepared according to the following reaction schemes in which DMF denotes dimethylformamide, EtOH denotes ethanol, DME denotes 1,2-dimethoxyethane, i-Pr denotes isopropyl, THF denotes tetrahydrofuran, KOtBu denotes potassium tert butoxide and HOAc denotes acetic acid.: (A)<br><br>

Compounds of formula (II) in which m is 1, R  is chlorine, n is 0, q is 0, one of X and Y represents a bond and the other of X and Y represents an oxygen atom and Z represents CH2, may be prepared according to the following reaction scheme in which DMF denotes dtmethylformamide and EtOH denotes ethanol: (G)<br>
(Figure Remove) Compounds of formula (II) in which m is I, R is methyl, n is 0, q is 1, one of X and Y represents a bond and the other of X and Y represents an oxygen atom and Z represents CH2, may be prepared according to the following reaction scheme in which DMSO denotes dimethylsulphoxide:<br><br><br>
Process routes (C), (D) and (H) above are novel.<br>
Thus, the present invention further provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (IIA) as defined above in which s is I, which comprises reacting a compound of formula<br>
wherein L represents a suitable leaving group (e.g. an electron withdrawing group such as a halogen atom) or an alkoxy, particularly methoxy, group, L  represents a suitable leaving group such as a halogen atom and R    is as defined in formula (IIA), with a<br>
compound of formula<br>
20<br>
wherein R    represents a protecting group such as a benzyl group or a group -C(0)-Q-R in which R    represents an alky! (e.g. Cj-Cg alkyl, particularly terbutyl) or aryl (e.g.<br><br>
phenyl) group and q, w and R 3 are as defined in formula (1IA) to form a compound of formula<br>
followed by a cyclisation reaction and then removal of the protecting group R   .<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes of the present invention certain functional groups such as hydroxyl or amino groups in the reagents may need to be protected by protecting groups. Thus, the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) may involve, at an appropriate stage, the removal of one or more protecting groups.<br>
The protection and deprotection of functional groups is described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry', edited by J.W.F. McOmie, Plenum Press (1973) and 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis', 3rd edition, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience(1999).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) above may be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, preferably an acid addition salt such as a hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, acetate, fumarate, maleate, tarrrate, citrate, oxalate, methanesulphonate or/j-toluenesulphonate.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms. It will be understood that the invention encompasses the use of all geometric and optical isomers (including atropisomers) of the compounds of formula (I) and mixtures thereof including racemates. The use of tautomers and mixtures thereof also form an aspect of the present invention. Enantiomerically pure forms are particularly desired.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) have activity as pharmaceutical, in particular as modulators of chemokine receptor (especially MlP-lct chemokine receptor) activity, and may be used in the treatment of autoimmune, inflammatory, proliferative and hyperproliferative diseases and immunologically-mediated diseases including rejection of transplanted organs or tissues and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).<br>

THP-1 Chemotaxis Assay<br>
Introduction<br>
The assay measured the chemotactic response elicited by MlP-la chemokine in the human monocytic cell line THP-1. The compounds of the Examples were evaluated by their ability to depress the chemotactic response to a standard concentration of MlP-la chemokine.<br>
Methods<br>
Culture of THP-1 cells<br>
Cells were thawed rapidly at 37°C from frozen aliquots and resuspended in a 25 cm flask containing 5 ml of RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with Glutamax and 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum without antibiotics (RPMI+10%HIFCS). At day 3 the medium is discarded and replaced with fresh medium.<br>
THP-1 cells are routinely cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum and glutamax but without antibiotics. Optimal growth of the<br>
cells requires that they are passaged every 3 days and that the minimum subculture density<br>
is 4x10 cells/ml.<br>
Chemotaxis assay<br>
Cells were removed from the flask and washed by centrifugation in RPMl+10%HIFCS+glutamax. The cells were then resuspended at 2x10 cells/ml in fresh medium (RPMI+10%HIFCS+glutamax) to which was added calcein-AM (5 ul of stock solution to 1 ml to give a final concentration of 5x10  M). After gentle mixing the cells were incubated at 37°C in a C02 incubator for 30 minutes. The cells were then diluted to 50 ml with medium and washed twice by centrifugation at 400xg. Labelled cells were then resuspended at a cell concentration of 1x10 cells/ml and incubated with an equal volume of MIP-la antagonist (10    M to 10  M final concentration) for 30 minutes at 37°C in a humidified 2 incubator.<br>
Chemotaxis was performed using Neuroprobe 96-well chemotaxis plates employing 8 urn filters (cat no. 101-8). Thirty microlitres of chemoattractant supplemented with various concentrations of antagonists or vehicle were added to the lower wells of the plate in triplicate. The filter was then carefully positioned on top and then 25ul of cells preincubated with the corresponding concentration of antagonist or vehicle were added to the surface of the filter. The plate was then incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in a humidified CC&gt;2 incubator. The cells remaining on the surface were then removed by adsorption and the whole plate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. The filter was then removed and the cells that had migrated to the lower wells were quantified by the fluorescence of cell associated calcein-AM. Cell migration was then expressed in fluorescence units after subtraction of the reagent blank and values were standardized to % migration by comparing the fluorescence values with that of a known number of labelled cells. The effect of antagonists was calculated as % inhibition when the number of migrated cells were compared with vehicle.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
