MFTHOD AN!) APPARATUS POP ENABLING AN APPLICATION TO COOPLRATL WITH RUNNING OFA PROGRAM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of optica! storage, in particular to a method and apparatus for enabling an application to cooperate with the running of a program.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
With the development of optical storage technology, programs stored on optical discs could have been played without following the fixed order. It almost becomes one necessary function in an optical disc playing apparatus that a user is enabled to perform interactive operation, while the network linking function has gradually become an important part of the newly rising functions of various optical disc formats. For example, an Enhanced Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) optical disc format defines a good interactive operation function and network linking function.<br>
All these functions are usually realized in a manner of menu navigation. An optical disc playing apparatus responds to some commanded triggering events (e.g. the pressing of buttons) according to the menu to realize corresponding functions. All the interactive operation functions and network linking functions are determined during editing the optical disc.<br>
As an optical disc format of new generation, A Blue-ray Disc is, in addition to its well-known incomparably large storage, characterized by providing rich and flexible personalized interactive functions and network linking functions. A Java application, as a completely object-oriented application, is introduced into the Blue-ray Disc format and it can run on various platforms, so a Java application is quite suitable to act as a tool enabling more personalized interactive functions and network linking functions available to the user. It becomes an issue worthy of note how to enable a Java application to run with respect to an optical disc program according to determined time and effect.<br>
Traditional methods of managing the correspondence between Java applications and programs being played are frequently adopted on a Multimedia Home Platform (MHP). In MHP, programs and Java applications are transmitted in real time to the user via code stream. The editors at the server terminal transmit an Application Information Table (AIT)<br><br>
and java applications according to predetermined time lo make the applications cooperate with the playing of the programs, so there is no need for association information between the programs and applications. An AIT contains the information describing a Java application, such as storage information, type information, information of resource required for running, running start information, running end information, etc.. The user terminal unscrambles the received AIT and controls the running of corresponding Java application based on the relevant information therein, what is presented to the user is an integrated effect brought about by the programs being played and corresponding applications.<br>
As far as a Blue-ray Disc is concerned, however, the programs and corresponding Java applications are stored on an optical disc or in network, and are read or downloaded upon request by an optical disc playing apparatus, which is different from the situation in MHP that the programs arid Java applications are transmitted in real time by the server terminal and are received and used in real time by the user terminal. Therefore, unlike in MHP, a Java application in Blue-ray Disc format is impossible to run through the user terminal receiving AIT and unscrambling AIT in real time so as to realize corresponding functions. Furthermore, in a Blue-ray Disc format, an optical disc program may possibly need the support of several applications, whereas a Java application may serve the playing of a plurality of optical disc programs, so the issue of applications corresponding to the playing of optical disc programs becomes more complex.<br>
An optical disc playing apparatus cannot download all the Java applications that may possibly be used into the memory when it starts playing the optical disc, nor is it allowable to find Java applications that shall run during playing an optical disc program, thereby affecting the playing effect.<br>
Therefore, there exists a need to provide a method and apparatus for enabling an application to cooperate with the running of a program so as to solve the problem of cooperation between the running of the application and the playing of the program.<br>

In all the figures, the same reference signs represent the same, similar or corresponding features or functions.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The concept of the invention is to edit the playing control information of a program and the linking information of an application corresponding to the program into a program playing control file. Through executing said playing control file, according to the guide of the linking information and based on the running control information of the application, the application can be downloaded, run or the running thereof can be stopped in cooperation with the playing of the optical disc program. The scheme of combining an application and a program into a playing control file will effectively cause the downloading and running of the application to cooperate with the playing of the program so as to ensure normal realization of corresponding functions.<br>
Fig. 1 is a flow chart of a method for enabling an application to cooperate with the running of a program according to an embodiment of the invention. Taking a Blue-ray Disc as an example, when editing an optical disc, first of all, the playing control information of a program on the optical disc is acquired (step SI 10). The playing control information comprises the information like a storage address of a program on the optical disc or a downloading address of the program in the network, a Title of the program and the length of the Title, a Title playback type, a Title access type, etc.. All the information are some characteristics of the optical disc program per se and have already been determined before editing the optical disc.<br>
Then, the running control information of the application corresponding to said optical disc program is acquired (step S120). The running control information comprises: the type of the application, an identification of the application, a version of the application, a priority arid control type of the application, a storage address, whether to download in advance, the running start time, the running end time, etc.. Some information are the descriptive information of the application per se, whereas some information are determined by editors with respect to the whole playing process or part of chapters, or pictures of the optical disc program in order to realize a certain specific playing effect or provide specific functions .<br><br>
Next, according ic the running control information ol the application, linking information is generated (Step SI 30) to link the application. The generated linking information of the application may. daring the later playing of the optical disc, link the running control information of the application to the optical disc playing apparatus so that the optical disc playing apparatus can download or download in advance, inn or stop running corresponding applications according to the running control information.<br>
Finally, the acquired playing control information of the optical disc program and the generated linking information of the application are edited into an optical disc program playing control file (S140). The optical disc program playing control file can be a file that has already generated according to the playing control information of the optical disc program, to which the linking information of the application and/or the playing control information of a new optical disc program and so on are added, or a file that is newly generated according to the requirement of an optical disc format in this step.<br>
During playing an optical disc, the optical disc playing apparatus will play the optica] disc program according to the playing control file. An optical disc program control file combines the program to be played with the corresponding application via the linking information of the application. By means of this file, the playing of the optical disc program and the running of the corresponding application can be combined together to reach the anticipated playing effect and functions.<br>
In a Blue-ray Disc format, the playing control information of the optical disc program may-be an index table of a title of the optical disc program. In the index table, each of titles of optical disc programs is realized by using a linking sentence for linking an Application Management Table (AMT), the linking sentence can point directly to a corresponding Java application.<br>
Through the aforesaid method, the downloading and running of an application can be combined with the playing of the optical disc program in a determined manner so as to realize the anticipated playing effect, while the situation that the calling and running of the application does not harmonize with the playing of the optical disc program will not appear.<br>
Below, the present invention is described by taking an example of enabling a Java application to cooperate with the running of an optical disc program in a Blue-ray Disc.<br>
According to playing mode, a Blue-ray Disc is classified into a Movie Mode that is set forth in advance and a Full Mode that is set forth later. The Movie Mode does not supply support for a Java application, it does not recognize and ignores the information<br><br>
about the Java application contained possibly on the optica] disc. In addition to containing the contents and functions included in the Movie Mode, the Full Mode further supports a Java application, comprising the Java application corresponding to said optical disc program, and offers the functions provided by the Java application. The method provided by the present invention is implemented under the Full Mode of the Blue-ray Disc.<br>
In a Blue-ray Disc format, optical disc programs are listed in an Index Table in a form of Title, the optical disc playing apparatus can play the optical disc programs to which the titles in the Index Table correspond according to the Index Table and perform playing according to the playing control information therein.<br>
Table I is an Index Table of a Blue-ray Disc title, wherein the rest items in the left column, besides "Title_ref_to_javaObj_id" that is specific to the present invention, are the contents common to the Movie Mode and Full Mode of the Blue-ray Disc format. Said 'Title_ref_to_javaObj_idr5 is the linking information of Java application that is edited in the Index Table according to the invention. If the optical disc playing apparatus can only support the Movie Mode, this sentence is ignored; if the optical disc playing apparatus can support the Movie Mode and Full Mode, this sentence is edited as a default value or is set as an alternative value. The middle column in Table I lists the specified number of bytes of various parameters, and the right column indicates the data types of various parameters.<br>
Table I: the portion related to title 16 in the Index Table of a Blue-ray Disc<br><br><br>
Said "Tit]e_ref_to_javaObj_id" can guide the optical playing apparatus to the management files corresponding to the title program and having a Java application with an identification mark id, and controls the downloading and running of the application according to corresponding running control information in the management file. Usually, a Java application corresponding to an optical disc program can be managed via an AMT that contains the running control information of an application corresponding to each of the titles of the optical disc programs.<br>
Table II is a table in an AMT showing the running control information of two applications corresponding to one optical disc program title. In the case that there are a plurality of the titles of the optical disc programs, the AMT may include information tables for a plurality of applications corresponding to each of the titles respectively.<br>
Table II: a schematic table in an AMT showing the running control information of applications corresponding to one optical disc program title.<br><br>
[<br>
I<br>

Through the linking information sentence "Title_ref_tojavaObj_id" in the index table and the running control information of Java application in AMT, the optical disc playing apparatus can control smoothly the running of the application and the playing of the optical disc program, thereby realizing the playing effect and supported function. For ■ example, if "javaObj" in the linking information sentence points to "App_01_01" included in AMT, then the optical disc playing apparatus may control playing according to the information of "App_01_01" in AMT so as to cooperate with the playing of the program.<br>
For the linking information "Title_ref_toJavaObj_id" in the Index Table, there is a more universal represention, for example: "notifyAMOfNewAMT (AMT_Title.amt)", wherein AM is an acronym of Application Management, "NewAMT" is the most recently updated AMT, because said AMT can at once be a table that is stored in the network and updated at any moment and a table that is locally stored but can be updated via the network.<br><br>
An A All updaie may he the update cA the Java application therein. eornpriMn^ replacement, version upgrade, variation of playing control information, etc..<br>
Fig. 2 is a ."'block -diagram of-an apparatus 200 for enabling an application to cooperate with the running-of a program according to-an embodiment of the invention. Apparatus 200 comprises an acquiring means for acquiring the playing control information of an optical disc program and the running control information of an application corresponding to the optical disc program. The playing control information of the optical disc program includes the information like the storage address of a program on the optical disc or the downloading address of the program in the network, a Title of the program and the length of the Title, a Title playback type and playing time, etc.. The running control information of the application comprises the type of the application, an identification of the application, a version of the application, a priority and control type of the application, the storage address, whether to download in advance, the running start time, the running; end time, etc..<br>
Apparatus 200 further includes means for generating linking information 220. According to the running control information of an application acquired by the acquiring means 210, apparatus 220 generates linking information so that the optical disc playing apparatus can. via said linking information, control the running of the application according to corresponding running control information.<br>
Apparatus 200 further includes an editing means 230 for editing the playing control information of the optical disc program acquired by said acquiring means 210 and the Unking information of the application generated by the generating means 220 into an optical disc program playing control file. When playing the optical disc, the optical disc playing apparatus will play the optical disc program according to the optical disc program playing control file.<br>
When playing the optical disc, the optical disc playing apparatus will play the optical disc program according to the playing control file. The optical disc program playing control file combines the program to be played with the corresponding application via the linking information of the application. Trough the file, the playing of the optical disc program and the running of corresponding application can be combined correspondingly so as to reach the anticipated playing effect and function.<br>
