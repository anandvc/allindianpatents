The NK-1 antagonistic properties of the compounds of the invention were tested using the methods outlined below.<br>
Pharmacological Methods<br><br>
Receptor Binding for human NK-1 Receptors<br>
Affinity of the compounds for human NK-1 receptors was assessed using radioreceptor binding assays. Membrane preparations were prepared from Chinese Hamster Ovarium fibroblast (CHO) cells in which the human NK-1 receptor was stably expressed. Membranes were incubated with pH]-substance P in the absence or the presence of specified concentrations of the compounds, diluted in a suitable buffer in presence of peptidase inhibitor for 10 min at 25°C. Separation of bound radioactivity from free was done by filtration over Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters with two 5 sec washings. Bound radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation counting using a Betaplate counter. Measured radioactivity was plotted against the concentration of the displacing test compound and displacement curves were calculated by four-parameter logistic regression, resulting in IC50 values, i.e. that concentration of displacing compound by which 50% of the radioligand is displaced. Affinity pK| values were calculated by coaecting the IC50 values for radioligand concentration and its affinity for the human NK-1 receptor according to the Cheng-PrusolT equation:<br><br>
in which the IC50 is as described above, S is the concentration pH]-substance P used in the assay expressed in mol/l, and Kj is the equilibrium dissociation constant of pHj-substance P for human NK-1 receptors (in mol/l).<br>
In vitro functional metliods for NK-1 receptors<br>
PI metabolism<br>
The effects of test compounds on the turnover of phosphatidyl-inositol (PI) was assessed in CHO cells, stably expressing the cloned human neurokinin NK-1 receptors. In these cells, NK-1 receptors are positively linked to phospholipase C, liberating inositolphosphates from membrane phospholipids. Inositol phosphates can accumulate in cells when inositol-1-phosphatase is inhibited by preincubating cells with lithium. For tests, cells were cultured in 24-well plates and incubated overnight with pH]-myo- inositol which is metabolically incorporated in membrane phospholipids. After labeling, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and incubated for 1 hr in a-DMEM. Thereafter, LiCI was added and 20 min later the test compounds<br><br>
were added to the incubation medium and incubated for 1 hr. Botfi LiCI and substance P in the absence or presence of test compounds {at specified concentrations) were diluted to appropriate concentrations in serum-free a-DMEI\/l in such a way that LiCI had a final concentration of 5 mM.<br>
After incubation, the medium was aspirated and cells were extracted with 5% trichloracetic acid. The inositol phosphates were recovered from the extract by sequential organic extraction using dichloromethane and water and ion-exchange chromatography over AG-1X2 DOWEX columns that were eluted by 1M ammonium fonnate (pH 7). Radioactivity in eluted fractions was counted using liquid scintillation counting and radioactivity was plotted against compound concentrations to construct concentration-effect relationships. Four-parameter logistic regression was done allowing estimates for potency and Intrinsic activity of compounds. ICso values, i.e. that compound concentration that antagonized 50% of substance P-induced accumulation of inositol phosphates, were obtained and antagonist potencies (pAj) values were calculated using:<br><br>
in which the ICso of the test compound was obtained from concentration-effect relationships, [SP] is the concentration of substance P (in mol/l; typically 10 nM), and the ECsD is the potency of substance P at human cloned NK-1 receptors.<br>
cAMP measurements<br>
The effects of test compounds at formation of cyclic AMP (cM/lP) was assessed using CHO fibroblast cells, stably expressing cloned human NK-1 receptors. In addition to coupling to phospholipase C, human NK-1 receptors are also able to stimulate adenylate cyclase, which converts ATP into cAMP. For tests, cells were cultured in 24-well plates. Prior to experiments, medium was replaced by serum-free a-DMEM culture medium, containing pH]-adenine which is taken up by the cells and converted sequentially into radiolabeled adenosine, AMP, ADP and ultimately into radiolabeled ATP. After 2 hrs, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) in presence of 1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX; inhibitor of phosphodiesterases that hydrolyse cAMP into AMP). Subsequently, cells were stimulated by 10 nM substance P in absence or presence of test compounds in appropriate dilutions In PBS/IBMX for 20 min. After stimulation, medium was aspirated and cells were extracted by 5% trichloracetic acid. Radiolabeled ATP and cAMP were recovered from the extracts<br><br>
using sequential column chromatography. Extracts were separated by ion-exchange chromatography over DOWEX 50WX4 columns, allowing the recovery of ATP. Columns were subsequently put on top of aluminum oxide columns and eluted with water. Recovery of cAMP was performed by eluting the aluminum oxide columns with 100 mM imidazole (pH 7.4). Both ATP and cAMP fractions were counted for radioactivity using liquid scintillation counting and conversion ratios were calculated as:<br><br>
Concentration-response relationships were constructed by plotting cAMP conversion against compound concentration and ICso concentrations were calculated by four-parameter logistic regression. Antagonist potencies (pAj) values were calculated using:<br><br>
in which the IC50 of the test compound was obtained from concentration-effect relationships, [SP] is the concentration of substance P (in mol/l; typically 10 nM), and the EC50 is the potency of substance P at human cloned NK-1 receptors.<br>
NK-1 agonist -induced gerbil Foot-Tapping<br>
The ability of NK-1 antagonists to antagonise foot-tapping induced by centrally administered NK-1 agonists has been demonstrated (Rupniak and Williams, 1994 (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 265:179); Bristowand Young, 1994 (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 254:245)). Therefore, we have used this model to assess the in vivo activity of the compounds of the invention.<br>
60 min prior to anaesthesia with NjO (O.SUmin), halothane (3%) and Oj (0.8 L/min) male gerbils (40-60 g; Charles River) received an injection of vehicle or test compound (pars orale). Upon successful narcosis the anaesthetic was adjusted to NjO (0.6L/min), halothane (1.5%) and O2 (0.6 L/min) and a midline scalp incision made. GR 73632 was infused into the cerebroventricular space (AP - 0.5mm, L -1.2 mm, and vertical -4.5mm from bregma). Following recovery from anaesthesia (about 3-4 min) the foot<br><br>
tapping response was recorded for 5 minutes. Tlie predefined criteria for tfie antagonism of this response was defined as inhibition of foot tapping for &gt; 5 minutes.<br>
The compounds of the invention have a high affinity for NK-1 receptors in the binding assay described above. The compounds of the invention are also active in the cAIVlP assay, their pAz-values being in line with their pKrvalues. Some of the compounds belonging to the invention penetrate the blood brain barrier as is evident from their activity in the neurokinin-agonist induced gerbil foot tapping assay. This property maizes them useful in the treatment of CNS disorders.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by means of the following specific examples. These examples are only intended to further illustrate the invention, in more detail, and therefore are not deemed to restrict the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
