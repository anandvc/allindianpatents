				<td>TECHNICAL HELD<br>
The present invention relates to a solid dispersion in which revaprazan particles<br>
are surface-modified with a water-soluble polymer, a water-soluble saccharide, a<br>
surfactant, or a mixture thereof and a process for preparing the same.   The present<br>
invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing the solid dispersion<br>
and a process for preparing the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Revaprazan, whose chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-2-(4-fluorophenylamino)-4-(1-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)pyrimidine, is represented by the following Formula 1. Revaprazan may be used in a form of an acid addition salt, including e.g., HCI salt (see International Publication No. WO 1996/05177).<br>
Formula 1<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Revaprazan or its salt is reversibfy bound to a H+/K+ exchange site of a proton pump (H+/K+ ATPase) existing in a gastric parietal cell so that secretion of H+ into the gastric lumen is competitively inhibited. Revaprazan or its salt is also bound to a specific site of H+/K+ ATPase, thereby inhibiting transport of H+ and suppressing an acid secretion to the gastric lumen, which results in increasing the intragastric pH. Unlike irreversible proton pump inhibitors, e.g., omeprazole, revaprazan or its salt is not dependent upon acid activation of a drug in a stomach or secretion status of a proton<br>
pump. Therefore, based on the mechanism different from irreversible proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, revaprazan or its salt is classified into an acid pump antagonist (APA).<br>
Meanwhile, revaprazan has very low water-solubility, i.e. less than 0.2 mg/mL, Sand due to such a low solubility, its dissolution in a gastrointestinal tract is low. Therefore, when revaprazan is orally administered, its absorption rate is relatively low. Revaprazan also has strong adhesion and agglutination properties, and thus, when revaprazan is formulated into a capsule or a tablet, it may be stuck to a punch or a die, thereby showing tow formulation processability.<br>
DISCLOSURE<br>
Technical Problem<br>
The present inventors studied to improve physicochemical properties of revaprazan, i.e. low dissolution rate and low formulation processability. As a result, it is found that, when revaprazan particles are surface-modified with a water-soluble polymer, a water-soluble saccharide, and/or a surfactant to prepare into a form of solid dispersion, the solubility and dissolution of revaprazan are notably improved, thereby showing remarkably improved bioavailability. In addition, it is found that the adhesiveness and agglutination properties of revaprazan can be improved to result in increasing its formulation processability.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a revaprazan-containing solid dispersion.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition which includes the revaprazan-containing solid dispersion and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing the revaprazan-containing solid dispersion.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing the pharmaceutical composition.<br>

ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS<br>
In accordance with the present invention, revaprazan particles are surface-modified with a water-soluble polymer, a water-soluble saccharide, and/or a surfactant<br>
to prepare into a form of solid dispersion, thereby increasing penetration and solubility properties of the drug (i.e. revaprazan), which results in increasing the solubility and/or dissolution rate of revaprazan remarkably, thereby improving its bioavailability. And also the adhesiveness and agglutination can be decreased and thus its formulation processability can be improved. Furthermore, the solid dispersion can be prepared using water as a medium, and thus, potential problems caused by using organic solvents, e.g., safety problems caused by residual solvent, can be avoided.<br>

Those formulations can be prepared using conventional methods known in the pharmaceutical field. For example, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated into a tablet by mixing the surface-modified solid dispersion with a diluent, a disintegrant, a lubricant, and the like; and compressing the mixture. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated into a tablet by granulating a surface-modified solid dispersion with a diluent and the like, mixing the obtained granule with a diluent, a disintegrant, a lubricant and the like, and compressing the obtained mixture. The pharmaceutical composition can be also formulated into a capsule by filling a capsule with the mixture. And also, film-coating or enteric coating can be further performed to improve stability, drug-compliance, and appearance.<br>
The present invention includes, within its scope, a process for preparing the solid dispersion. The process includes: suspending revaprazan and one of a water-soluble polymer, a water-soluble saccharide, a surfactant, and a mixture thereof in water to obtain a suspension; and drying the suspension.<br>
As described above, the use of water as a medium make it possible to avoid potential problems caused by using organic solvents, e.g., safety problems caused by residual solvent.<br>
In the process for preparing the solid dispersion, the suspension can be obtained by adding revaprazan to an aqueous solution containing a water-soluble polymer, a water-soluble saccharide, a surfactant, or a mixture thereof, while strongly stirring the aqueous solution. Alternatively, the suspension can be also obtained by adding both revaprazan and one of a water-soluble polymer, a water-soluble saccharide, a surfactant, and a mixture thereof to water and then strongly stirring the resulting mixture. The stirring (i.e., dispersing) can be performed using any conventional methods known in the pharmaceutical field. For example, the stirring can be performed using a stirrer equipped with a stirring wing, an ultrasonic oscillator, a microfluidizer, a high pressure homogenizer, a propeller-containing mixer, or a homogenizer. Homogeneous suspension can be obtained using a stirrer equipped with a stirring wing and also more homogenous suspension can be obtained using a homogenizer or a microfluidizer.<br>
In the process for preparing the solid dispersion, the drying can be performed using any conventional drying methods known in the pharmaceutical field, such as spray-drying, freeze-drying, or vacuum drying. Preferably, the drying can be performed by spray-drying. The spray-drying can be performed using any conventional methods with a fluid bed granulator or a spray-dryer.<br>
The present invention includes, within its scope, a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition including the solid dispersion.<br>
For example, according to an embodiment of the present invention, a granule may be prepared by a method which comprises suspending revaprazan and one of a water-soluble polymer, a water-soluble saccharide, a surfactant, and a mixture thereof in water to obtain a suspension; and spray-drying the suspension on a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The suspension can be obtained in the same manner as in the method of preparing the solid dispersion.<br>
The spray-drying can be performed according to any conventional methods using a fluid bed granulator, a cylindrical granulator, a high-speed granulator and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier used in the spray-drying step can include a diluent, such as a microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, com starch, mannitol, potato starch, pregelatinized starch, cellulose, MicroceLac™, Prosolv™, dextrate, dextrin,<br>
calcium dihydrogenphosphate, citric acid, succinic acid, and the like; a disintegrant, such as crospovidone, sodium starch glycolate, croscarmellose sodium, sodium hydrogencarbonate, or low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellutose, and the like; a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, and the like; and a solid surfactant, such as sucrose fatty acid ester (Ryoto Ester™, Mitsubishi Co.), sodium lauryl sulfate, and the like.<br>
Also, according to another embodiment of the present invention, a granule may be prepared by a method which comprises granulating by adding a binder solution to a mixture of the solid dispersion and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The binder solution may be water; C1-4 alcohol (for example, ethanol); a mixture of water and C1-4 alcohol (for example, ethanol solution); or a solution prepared by adding any conventional binder used in the pharmaceutical field to one of water, C1-4 alcohol (for example, ethanol), and a mixture of water and C1-4 alcohol (for example, ethanol solution). The binder includes at least one selected from the group consisting iofpolyvinyl alcohol, xanthan gum, arabic gum, alginic acid or its salt, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, carbomer, hydroxypropyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and a mixture thereof. The amount of the binder is not limited, and may be about 10 wt% of the total weight of the granulated pharmaceutical composition. When the amount of the binder exceeds 10 wt% of the total weight of the (granulated pharmaceutical composition, the granule may be hardened and thus disintegration thereof can be prolonged. When required, the binder solution can further include polyoxyethylene glycolated natural or hydrogenated castor oil (for example, CremophorRH40™).<br>
Also, according to another embodiment of the present invention, a tablet may be prepared by a method which comprises compressing a mixture of the solid dispersion and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, or compressing a mixture of a granule obtained from the solid dispersion and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (for example, a lubricant such as magnesium stearate).<br>
Also, according to another embodiment of the present invention, a capsule may be prepared by a method which comprises filling a capsule with a mixture of the solid dispersion and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, or filling a capsule with a mixture of a granule obtained from the solid dispersion and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier<br>

A mixture of 500 g of microcrystalline cellulose, 360 g of sucrose-fatty acid ester (Ryoto Ester™, Mitsubishi Co.), 90 g of crospovidone, and 90 g of sodium hydrogencarbonate was sieved with a 20 mesh-sieve, and then 1,300 g of the solid dispersion prepared according to Example 9 was added thereto. The resultant mixture was mixed in a high-speed granulator for 1 minute. A binder solution was prepared by dissolving 20 g of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in 100 ml of 80 %(v/v) ethanol solution. While rotating the mixture in the high-speed granulator at a speed of 300 rpm for 3 minutes, the binder solution was added thereto to obtain the solid dispersion-containing granules.<br>
Example 50: Preparation of Tablet<br>
200 g of the solid dispersion prepared according to Example 1, 150 g of microcrystalline cellulose, 20 g of sodium starch glycolate, 20 g of crospovidone, and 10 g of magnecium stearate were mixed and then compressed using a single tablet press to obtain tablets (Weight per tablet: 800 mg and Amount of revaprazan per tablet: 200 mg).<br>
Experimental Example 1: Dissolution Test<br>
Solubility of a revaprazan-containing solid dispersion was measured in purified water. A solid dispersion containing 1 g of revaprazan was added to a beaker containing 50 ml of purified water, which was then strongly stirred using a magnetic stirrer at 25 °C in a water bath for 6 hours. After 1, 2, and 6 hours, each sample was collected and filtered using a 0.45µm filter. The filtrate was diluted with methanol having such an amount that absorbance of the filtrate is in the range from 0.2 to 1.0. Then, absorbance   of   the   diluted   filtrate   was   measured   at   270   nm   using   a   UV<br>
spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453, Agilent technologies, USA). From the obtained absorbance value, concentrations of revaprazan were obtained using a standard curve. About 20 mg of revaprazan standard was dissolved in methanol until the total volume of the solution reached 10 ml. 1 ml of the resultant solution was added to a 100 ml flask and then purified water was added thereto to obtain a standard stock solution. The standard stock solution was diluted with purified water to obtain 2µg/ml, 5µg/ml, 8 µglml, and 10µg/ml of standard solution. Each absorbance of the standard solutions was measured at an absorption maximum wavelength of 270 nm to obtain a standard curve. The standard curve was moderately linear passing through almost (0.0) (coefficient of correlation r*&gt; 0.98). The results are shown in Table 6.<br>
Table 6<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Referring to Table 6, it can be seen that solubility of the surface-modified solid dispersion according to the present invention is remarkably improved.<br>
Experimental Example 2: Adhesiveness and Agglutination Test<br>
The bulk density and tapped density of revaprazan powder and the surface-modified solid dispersions prepared according to Examples 3 and 6 were measured and their Carr"s indexes were obtained in order to measure flowability thereof. About 3 g of a solid dispersion was carefully added to a plastic measuring cylinder and the volume thereof was measured to obtain the bulk density. And then, this was subjected to tapping 3,000 times using a tapped density meter to measure the volume and the tapped density was obtained. From the obtained bulk density and tapped density, Cairs index was calculated in order to evaluate flowability. The results are shown in Table 7.<br>
Table 7<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
po: Bulk density<br>
pt: Tapped density<br>
Carr's index = (po -pt) / pt * 100<br>
Referring to Table 7, revaprazan powder having very high adhesion and agglutination properties shows 40% or more of Carr's index and its flowability was very low. On the other hand, the surface-modified solid dispersion had high flowability and its compression properties were improved.<br>
Experimental Example 3: Observation of Particle Surface using Scanning Electron Microscope<br>
The surface of particles of a revaprazan-containing solid dispersion was measured using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The samples prepared according to Examples 6 and 11 were mounted on a metal stub to which a double-sided tape had been attached, and then coated with platinum using an ion sputtering device (JFC-1100E, Jeol Co., Japan) in argon gas atmosphere. Each of the coated samples was loaded to SEM (JSM 5410LV, JEOL Co., Japan). The magnification was adjusted at a voltage of 15kV to observe the surface of particles. As a reference, the shape of revaprazan particles was also observed using a polarizing microscope to compare with those of the surface-modified solid dispersions described above. Revaprazan was placed on a slide glass and then a few drops of mineral oil were dropped thereto for dispersing. The sample was covered with a cover glass and then loaded on a mobile plate of a polarizing microscope (Nikon eklipse E600 POL, Nikon Co., Japan) to observe the shape of the crystal while a polarization angle was being adjusted.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, revaprazan does not show any crystalline image. However, the revaprazan-containing solid dispersions show crystalline forms covered with surface-modifying materials.<br>
Experimental Example 4: Comparative Dissolution Test<br>
Comparative dissolution test was performed to evaluate dissolution profile of a surface-modified solid dispersion according to the present invention. A revaprazan-containing capsule was prepared as a comparative sample. Specifically, 50 mg of revaprazan powder was mixed with 10 %(w/w) of sodium starch glycolate as a disintegrant. The mixture was filled into a hard gelatin capsule. The solid dispersion prepared according to Example 3 was mixed with 10 %(w/w) of sodium starch glycolate and then the resulting mixture was filled into a hard gelatin capsule. A dissolution test was performed on the tablet prepared according to Example 36 and the above samples in 900 ml of 0.1N HCI solution at 37±0.5 °C, of temperature and 50 rpm of an agitation speed. 3 ml of the sample was collected in every 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes, and 90 minutes and the same amount of the medium was compensated immediately. From the collected dissolution sample, the dissolution rate was measured by quantifying the concentration of revaprazan at 270 nm using UV spectrometer. The results are shown in FIG. 1.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the revaprazan powder formulation has 30% or less of dissolution rate, but the formulations according to the present invention have as high dissolution rate as 95% or more within 30 minutes.<br>
Experimental Example 5: Pharmacokinetic Study<br>
About 10 kg of male beagle dogs were chosen, their weight was measured, and they were confirmed with naked eyes whether or not they had any wound. Before administration of the test materials, any food was not provided to the beagle dogs except for water for 15 hours. Then, a revaprazan tablet (comparative formulation) prepared from a mixture of revaprazan, lactose, sodium starch glycolate, and magnecium stearate, and the table prepared according to Example 36 were orally administered with 20 to 40 ml of water. The administrated dosage was 200 mg of revaprazan per subject. Before the administration, and 0.25, 0.5,1,1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the administration, about 1.0 ml of blood was collected using a heparin-treated injector. The collected blood was centrifuged at a rotation speed of 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes, and the separated serum was loaded to an effendorf tube and left to sit at -20 °C. Then, the frozen collected blood was defrosted and then the amount of revaprazan in serum was measured using HPLC.<br>
The maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and the time required to reach the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) were measured using values obtained from the<br>
serum concentration-time curve, and the area under the serum concentration-time curve from 0 hour to 8 hours (AUCo-8hr) was measured using a trapezoidal rule. AUC0-∞ the area under the serum concentration-time curve from 0 hours to ∞, was measured using a trapezoidal rule extrapolation. The area under the serum concentration-time curve from the final data to ∞ was obtained by dividing the final serum concentration by the elimination constant. The blood concentration of the drug and pharmacokinetic parameters were represented by mean±S.E.M. values, and a statistical significance of in vivo experiment results was calibrated using Duncun's multiple range test according to analysis of variance.<br>
AUC0-8hr(ng.hr/mℓ) of the tablet prepared according to Example 36 was 1401±332, five-fold higher than AUC0-8hr (ng.hr/mℓ), i.e, 261±52, of a conventional revaprazan tablet (p
