				<td>AN AESTIVUM VERMICELLI WITH AN ADDITIVE PREMIX<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates an aestivum vermicelli with an additive premix and a process thereof.<br>
Background art<br>
India's wheat production in 1998-99 was 73.2 million tonnes, an 18 per cent increase from 55 million tonnes in 1993-94. The 1998-99 output made India the world's second biggest wheat producer after China. But India has not yet established itself as a regular wheat-exporting nation. However, the bumper output in 1998-99 -together with other factors mentioned below - positions India to increase its wheat exports, not withstanding the fact that production in 1999-2000 is expected to have declined by 2.9 per cent.<br>
Demand exists in the international markets for both durum and aestivum varieties of wheat. The durum variety accounts for only 4 per cent of the total world wheat production. Nearly 10-12 million tonnes of durum wheat (valued US $2,600 million) is traded annually worldwide. India is a major durum wheat producer, but almost all the 2.5 million tonnes produced by it is consumed within the domestic market itself).<br>
In India, most of the durum wheat produced was utilized for the production of pasta products. Pasta products are one of the most ancient forms in which wheat has been consumed. Pasta is the Italian word for paste, a mixture of flour and salt. The use of wheat in pasta products in more wide spread in the world, when compared to bread because pasta products are simpler to make and quick to serve, if dried can be conveniently stored for a relatively long period of time without deterioration. Pasta products comprise vermicelli, noodles, macaroni and spaghetti. These are similar, but differ principally in shape and size. They comprise a) Macaroni- made from semolina and are in the shape of hollow tubes of various sizes and diameters, b) Spaghetti- made either from semolina or flour and are in the form of solid rods generally of small diameters, c) Vermicelli-basically made of semolina and is slightly<br><br>
thicker than spaghetti, and d) Noodles-these are made from wheat flour instead of semolina and are strips, either flat (rolled and cut) or oval (extruded).<br>
The pasta products such as noodles, spaghetti and vermicelli are becoming popular world over. Their per capita consumption is about 30 Kg in Italy and Greece and 3- 6 Kg in most of the other countries except UK and Scandinavian countries, where it is less than 2 Kg. In India, however, the per capita consumption of pasta products is as low as 80 gram (Vetrimani.R, Sudha ML and.Haridas Rao. P, 1999 Improvement of quality of Pasta products through use of additives- an appraisal, Indian Miller, July -Aug, 11-19). The market survey conducted by US Wheat Associates, New Delhi has revealed that about 30-40% of the household are consuming the pasta products and is expected to increase to 65% by 2005 AD. This suggests that there is a tremendous scope for expansion of pasta industry in the country. The production of vermicelli and noodles was 4.73 lakh tonnes for 1990 and increased to 5.39 lakh tonnes in 1996.  It is expected to increase further to 7.0 lakh tons in 2005.<br>
Flour/semolina is the major raw material of pasta products accounting for over 98% of the raw material. Therefore quality of flour/ semolina plays an important role in determining the quality of pasta products. The fundamental steps in the technological process required for the transformation of a loose mass into a particular shape involves blending of flour/semolina and water to form a homogeneous mixture. forming into a final shape and drying. Good pasta should have smooth surface and creamish color and the same should yield a product with discrete mass, higher water absorption and minimum solid loss during cooking. The flour/semolina obtained from durum wheat is more desirable as it is extra hard wheat containing high protein and pigments. The products obtained from durum wheat are associated with higher water absorption or swelling capacity and discrete mass of cooked pasta.<br>
However, in recent years several additives are developed and being used to improve the quality of pasta made either from durum wheat. Vermicelli is normally prepared with durum wheat semolina with or without additives. But, in India durum wheat production is very low which is only 4% of the total wheat production. The need of the hour for pasta making industries would be the process for development of good quality vermicelli from aestivum wheat.   The need is to be exploited and there is a<br><br>
good growth potential for the industries, which manufacture the vermicelli. Moreover, the developed process system can be useful to small as well as large-scale pasta making industries.<br>
Creamish color is the important desired quality attribute of vermicelli. The natural pigments in wheat impart the colour of vermicelli and it amounts to 4-8 mg/Kg Î²-carotene in durum wheat and 2-3-mg/Kg (3-carotene in other aestivum wheat (Irvine GN. Durum wheat and pasta products. Wheat: Chemistry and Technology. 2nd ed.Y.Pomeranz, Vol.11 ed. American Association of Cereal Chemists., St.Paul M.N.777-796). Some of the Indian wheats have only 1.5 to 2.0 mg/Kg pigment (Lier JB and Lacrolx LJ, 1974. Carotenoids of durum wheat: Induced high pigment levels obtained by treatment of the growing plant with chlorophenysthio triethlamme (CPTA) hydrochloride. Cereal Chemistry 51, 34-45; Rahim, A., Haridas Rao, P and Shurrpalekar SR, 1974. Physico-chemical and rheological properties and milling quality of Indian durum wheats. Journal Food Science and Technology ( India) 11. 1-4). Walsh DE, Youngs VL and Grilles KA, 1970. Inhibition of durum wheat lipoxidase with L-ascorbic acid. Cereal chemistry 47, 119-125 reported that addition of L-ascorbic acid during mixing of the dough decreased the reduction of semolina pigment during processing and increased the yellowness of spaghetti. Moreover, the greatest color improvement appeared in samples from durum varieties having high lipoxidase activity. The ascorbic acid has been found to be a competitive inhibitor of lipoxidase. Considerable pigment retention was obtained at 100-250 mg/Kg ascorbic acid incorporation (Walsh DE, Youngs VL and Grilles KA, 1970. Inhibition of durum wheat lipoxidase with L-ascorbic acid. Cereal chemistry 47, 119-125) and spaghetti pigment content increased over 90% for the sample with 200 ppm of ascorbic acid. L-ascorbic-2-phosphate was reported to be equally effective in retention of pigment of pasta (Kim HI, Seb PA, Posner E, Deyoe, CLW and Yang HC !989. Improving the color and cooking quality of spaghetti from Kansas Hard Winter wheat. Cereal Food World 34, 2116-223). The colour of the pasta may also be improved by adding riboflavin (Burov, LA, Medvede, GM and Semko VT, 1980. Improvement of colour of pasta from soft wheat flour. Khlebopekarrayani, Konditerskaya, Promshdennost 6. 33, 1979 (Abstract from Food Science and Technology 12 (b); 6M 662); Kim HI, Seib PA, Posner E, Deyoe CW and Yang HC 1986. Milling hard red winter wheat to<br><br>
farina: Comparison of cooking quality and color of farina semolina spaghetti. Cereal Food World 31,810-819).<br>
Emulsifiers are used in pasta products to improve machinability of the dough and quality of pasta products. Incorporation of GMS (Glycerol Mono Stearate) up to 1.0% decreased the cooking loss by 6% for both pasta cooked for optimum period as well as that for overcooked pasta. Increasing the quality of GMS to 2% further improvement in the pasta quality was not observed. The enzyme-modified lecithin was found inferior to GMS in reducing cooking loss and stickiness, probably because of the high mineral content (8% ash) of the modified lecithin. SSL increased the surface firmness and decreased cutting stress. The cooking quality of spaghetti improved when small quantities of other amylose complexing agents as PGMS (Propylene glycol mono stearate) was added to the dough (Nazarov, Nl, Gaidebko. MV, Lekhter AE and Ob'yakova GS 1975. Surfactants to improve macaroni products Khlebopek, Kunditer, Prom. 4, 27-28). These emulsifiers also increase the cooking tolerance and strength of the product thus reduces the stickiness.<br>
The effect of different types of gluten on spaghetti cooking was studied and observed. Gluten of medium strength appeared to produce spaghetti of optimum cooking quality (Matsue RR and Irvine GN, 1970. Effects of gluten on the cooking quality of spaghetti. Board of grain commissioners for Canada, Grain Research Laboratory, Winnipeg 2, Manitobe, 173-180)<br>
Reference may be made here to Kim et al.1992. The improvement of spaghetti quality made from bread wheat flour. Journal of the Korean Society of Food and Nutrition. 21(3) 270-278 wherein the effect of steam treatment after extrusion of the spaghetti from flour of 51 varieties of hard red winter wheat (HRW), 2 varieties of hard white winter wheat (HWW) or commercial durum wheat is compared with spaghetti made from farina of HRW and HWW. Steam treated spaghetti was stronger than control spaghetti. Steam treatment affected quality of hard wheat farina spaghetti more than that of durum spaghetti. The drawback is that the product is spaghetti and not vermicelli.<br><br>
Reference may be made here to Lee., U.S. Pat. No. 4,840,808 (1989) wherein discloses a method for preserving color of vegetable pasta products is described Color is enhanced by the addition of a cation such as magnesium, zinc, copper. calcium and aluminum cations to the pasta mixture. In addition, the patent discloses the presence of salt and glycerol monostearate to the pasta mixture. Salt provides flavor. GMS functions as an emulsifier or lubricant or flow modifier, which reduces the viscosity of alimentary paste, making extrusion easier. It is reported that the use of GMS reduces the pressure within the extruder. The drawback is that the raw material used is durum wheat and final product is not mainly focused on the vermicelli made from aestivum wheat.<br>
Reference may be made here to Lee et al., U.S. Pat.No. 6,022,575 (2000), which discloses the method to prevent starch retrogradation in pasta products. In addition, the patent also states the use of additives such as propylene glycol alginate to further improve anti-retrogradation properties of cooked pasta. The cooked product is coated with an edible acid like lactic acid and edible oil could be pea nut oil. coconut oil, sunflower oil and the like. Pasta of this invention includes products made from semolina, flour from durum wheat, other flours such as oat flour, rice flour or any other cereal flour. The drawback is that wheat products from durum wheat and other cereal flours are used and not aestivum semolina.<br>
Reference may be made here to Sowbhagya et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,083,551 (2000) which discloses the process for the preparation of noodles/vermicelli from maize (corn,. Zea mays L.) . The draw back is that the raw material used was maize not aestivum wheat.<br>
Reference may be made here to CA 2012723 disclosed bread improving compositions comprising xylanase and glucose oxidase, which reduces dough strength'and stickiness. The draw back is that the xylanase was used to improve the quality of bread not vermicelli made from aestivum wheat.<br>
Reference may be made here to Gum et al., U.S.Pat.No.5,817,356(1998) wherein a process for the preparation of a fully cooked shelf stable or refrigerated acidified pasta product is described. The mixed dough is encapsulated with edible acid and<br><br>
then steam to gelatinise surface of pasta. The steamed pasta is treated with water and second steaming is done till it is substantially cooked. The pasta is coated with edible oil to inhibit sticking and is finally packed. The drawback is that the pasta ingredients used in this invention may be one or more of durum semolina, durum flour, regular wheat flour, whole wheat flour, corn flour or any mixture thereof and not vermicelli made from aestivum wheat<br>
Reference may be made here to Hahn et al., US 5,945,144(1999) wherein a calcium fortified pasta and the process for preparing the same is described. The pasta product contains about 75% wheat flour, water and at least 800 mg to 8,000mg of calcium per pound of the product. The pasta product additionally comprises a gelling agent, a vitamin, a flavoring agent, a vegetable, egg white or egg yolk or combination thereof. However, the Patent teaches the pasta product that is prepared from a wheat flour and not aestivum semolina. Also, the additives used in this particular invention are different.<br>

Characteristics of vermicelli with ascorbic acid (100ppm), gluten (3%) and xylanase (0.012%)were light creamy colour and strands had no stickiness. Volume expansion in strands was observed (Table 1). Cooked weight 97.62g. Cooking loss of 4.17% was observed which was the lowest when compared with the cooking losses of combination I and III and the control. The yellow index and shear force value were 22.63 and 65.7g respectively (Table 2). The combination II consisting of additives (ascorbic acid 100 ppm, gluten 3%, xylanase 0.012%) produced the best results As evident from the photograph of the product (Figure 1), the vermicelli made using the combination II had light creamy yellow color and very good quality characteristics in terms of strand quality, cooked weight, low cooking loss etc.<br>

The characteristics of vermicelli made with ascorbic acid (200 ppm), gluten (4%) and xylanase (0.018%) were pale white color, less firm strands. The expansion in the volume of strands was observed. The strands were mushy and possessed sticky mouth feel. The cooked weight was 97.81 g/25g. Cooking loss was 5.46%, which was higher than vermicelli made with combination II indicating leaching of solids owing to lesser strength in strands. Yellow index was 20.12, which was lesser than the yellow index value of combination II showing low color retention in the strands (Table 1 &amp; 2). The shear force value of 61.0g showed that the strands were weak than the strands prepared with combination II.<br><br>
Table  2:   Effect  of  different  additives   on  the   physical   characteristics   of vermicelli<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
Combination I - 50 ppm ascorbic acid, 1.5% gluten, xylanase 0.06% Combination II - 100ppm ascorbic acid, 3% gluten, xylanase 0.012 % Combination III - 200ppm ascorbic acid, 4% gluten, xylanase 0.018%<br>
SEM Studies:<br>
The control vermicelli and the vermicelli prepared with Combination II, which produced the best results, were selected for the SEM Studies. The cross sections of the micrographs with control vermicelli and vermicelli containing improver mix (Combination II) showed that the area of rupture in case of the control was bigger whereas in vermicelli with improver mix it was very small indicating that the strands had strength and the core was smooth during cooking.<br>
The transverse cross-section of control vermicelli and vermicelli containing the improver mix showed the same as above (Figure 2).<br>
The integrity of the protein film that envelops the strands is very crucial as it affects the cooking quality. The micrographs of vermicelli with improver mix - Combination ll showed a continuous, rupture free structure showing that the improver mix had imparted strength to the protein network in aestivum wheat resulting in a product with good cooking quality even though there was a good expansion in volume of strands during cooking because of the improvers.<br><br>
