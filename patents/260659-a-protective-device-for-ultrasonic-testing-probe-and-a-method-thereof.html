FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a protective device for ultrasonic testing probes which device shields the probe from heat and spatter and maintain continuous thin film of couplant during welding operation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Welding is a well-established manufacturing method for joining components. During welding, there are possibilities of unfused layers of welding either between successive layers or between sidewall and the weld deposit. During angle beam ultrasonic testing, sound beam is projected from a distance and at a suitable angle decided by the thickness and edge preparation angle, so that whenever there is an unfused layer between weld and the side wall and solid inclusions not fused with the weld metal, gas holes these are detected for corrective action if required.<br>
In the conventional angle beam UT, the probe is moved between predetermined positions in a direction perpendicular to the axis of welding, so that the full volume of the weld metal in one section is covered during one forward motion of the probe. The probe is moved to the next section of the weld and the forward or backward motion covers the volume of weld metal in the next section. And the operation is continued to other sections so that the entire weld length is tested. This operation is undertaken after completion of the weld and cooling the job to ambient temperature. The presence of the weld defects is identified only after the full weld is completed.<br><br>
JP 2005207795 describes a liquid medium which is cooled and is used for transmitting sound.<br>
JP2005064919 describes a probe design, wherein the probe is constructed with a glass in between the electrode and the oscillator.<br>
JP 8285938, describes a wave guide in rod form with specific acoustic impedance.<br>
JP8285938   describes   an   ultrasonic  distance   measuring   apparatus  whose detection performance at a high temperature is enhanced by a method wherein a * part of a wave-guiding rod is placed in a high-temperature atmosphere.<br>
Hence, there is a requirement to identify the weld defects in every layer deposited over the last layer deposited. This requires testing to be undertaken at either the ambient temperature or at elevated temperature, when the welding is in progress. The application of suitable and sufficient couplant for the complete coverage is essential under this condition. Additionally the probe must be able to work in an environment with weld spatter or slag, flux, heat radiation. Available conventional probes must be employed for the testing for the reasons of economy.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a protective device for ultrasonic testing probes positionable corresponding to the layer of weld under investigation during continuous welding<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a protective device for ultrasonic probes which are capable of in a particular line parallel to the weld axis such that ultrasonic wave is injected to the particular layer of the weld region.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a protective device for ultrasonic probes capable of injecting ultrasonic wave to the particular layer of the weld region immediately after solidification to detect the presence or absence of fusion between the two layers.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to propose a protective device for ultrasonic probes which can be positioned at an optimum distance from the welding region without compromising the detection quality.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a protective device for ultrasonic probes which ensures maintenance of continuous coupling between the probe and testing surface.<br><br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a protective device for ultrasonic probes which enables continuous supply of couplant to ensure the detection.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose a protective device for ultrasonic probes which can accommodate conventional UT probes widely used in the industry.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a protective device for ultrasonic probes which can eliminate wear and tear of the probes.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to propose a protective device for ultrasonic probes which isolates the probe from high temperature and welding environment.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose a protective device for ultrasonic probes which can be connected to welding head so that it follows the welding and directs the ultrasound towards the region immediately after solidification.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to propose a protective device for ultrasonic probes which will detect the presence or absence of fusion in a particular layer.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a protective device for ultrasonic probes which accommodates ultrasonic testing probes so that a continuous thin film of suitable couplant is maintained while the probe is moving to have good acoustic coupling, eliminating the error due to insufficient couplant during testing, making the protective probe device suitable for continuous scanning in ambienent temperature and if required at elevated temperature permitted by the couplant, thereby making high temperature UT possible with conventional UT probes, without wear and tear of the probes.<br>
The invention in the application uses a solid housing for accommodating a conventional probe with a conventional couplant supplied directly in the text zone.<br>
The present application describes a solid material which acts as a barrier between the conventional probe and the job.<br>
The invention in the application is an invention wherein the conventional probe is used as an ultrasonic generator, which enables different probes of same size to be used for testing for the application.<br>
The present invention is not acting as a waveguide and is only a transmitter of sound generated by the probe.<br><br>
In the present invention, no wave guide is employed.<br>
At the outset of the description, which follows, it is to be understood that the ensuring description only illustrates a particular form of this invention. However, such a particular form is only an exemplary embodiment and the teaching of the invention is not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1- Shows the illustration of a protective device for ultrasonic probes, particularly adaptable for angle beam probe according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2- Shows the arrangement for application of the probe housing.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The device comprises an ultrasonic probe also referred to as ultrasonic transducer (1) placed in a housing made of suitable material (2) as illustrated in fig. l. The transducer (1) is clamped using a clamp (3). A tank (4) is located above the probe (1) and is filled with a couplant fluid (5). The couplant (5) is fed on to<br><br>
the test surface just below the probe (1) and between the probe housing (2) and the test surface continuously using many tubes (6) [illustrated in the figure with 4 tubes]. The coupling fluid (5) is also placed in the housing (2) such that a gap between the probe (1) and the housing (2) are totally filled. The housing (2) is machined in such a way the effective refraction angle is within the permitted variation and the new refraction angle of the probe (10 fixed in the probe housing (2) is determined in a standard manner.<br>
To maintain a thin film of couplant (5) for the probe (1) to be effective in injecting the ultrasound on to the material (8) under test, if the contact surface is perfectly flat without air gap then the available couplant (5) at one pace will be removed by the movement of the probe holder. To avoid this, a suitable thin step is provided such that a small gap (7) between the top of the job (8) and the housing (2) is maintained. This makes the availability of the couplant (5) as thin layer continuously for effective injection of the ultrasound in to the material under test.<br>
To control the flow of couplant (5) as thin layer from the tank (4) to the surface under test, the tubes carrying the couplant (5) are configured for smooth flow of the couplant (5). While fixing the probe (1) in the probe housing (2) the position of the probe (1) is adjusted so that reflection from a suitable reflector such as straight edge of the job, is detected with maximum echo height at a given amplifier settings.<br><br>
To facilitate the defect location marking, the required probe index for the probe (10 in the probe housing (20 as a single unit is determined as per the standard procedure.<br>
During operation, the device is connected by a rigid means to a movable trolley or carriage which houses a welding torch. The device is placed on the surface of the job (8) such that the ultrasound which is injected into the job (8) hits the topmost layer of welding (9) that is being welded. The position and movement of the device with probe assembly is such that ultrasound hits the just-solidified weldment. The device is set on the job (8) such that there is a very small gap (7) between the job (8) and the housing (2). The couplant (5) is fed by gravity and is ensured that it is fed on the job (8).<br><br>
