The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it has to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
Technical Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to stable liposomal nebulizing inhalation formulation of salbutamol sulphate for use in the treatment of asthma to give controlled drug delivery to pulmonary systems. This invention is more particularly relates to liposomal nebulizing inhalation formulations carriers that can carry the drug into deep lung and maintain it at the site of action to give a prolonged therapeutic effect.<br>
Background and Prior art:<br>
Inhalation aerosols have been employed to treat localized disease states within bronchi. Since pulmonary route of administration can directly deliver therapeutic agents to the diseased regions whilst reducing their distribution to other organs, it provides an excellent example of targeted drug therapy. A more favourable therapeutic index can be obtained for the treatment of pulmonary diseases when drugs are administered by inhalation rather than by the oral route. Bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory agents, mucolytics, antiviral agents are all routinely given as aerosolised formulations. The possibility of systemic absorption of proteins and peptides via the airways has currently stimulated interest in pulmonary delivery systems.<br>
A significant disadvantage of many existing inhaled drugs is the relatively short duration of resultant clinical effects and most medications in aerosol form require at least 3-4 times daily administration. Although the onset of action is very rapid, the duration is often short lived as the drug can be removed from the lungs through various clearance mechanisms. A reduction in the frequency of dosing would be convenient, particularly for chronic treatments such as those for asthma.<br>
Most bronchodilators, p2-agonists have the potential to induce significant cardiovascular side effects such as hypotension and tachycardia due to stimulation of the p2-adrenoreceptors in the systemic circulation and cross reactivity with cardiac pi- adrenoreceptors. Controlled release of such drugs in the pulmonary region would be particularly beneficial since they could be delivered to and retained at the targeted receptors for a prolonged period of time and thus minimize the biodistribution through systemic circulation.<br>
2<br><br>
Drugs for inhalation therapy are administered in aerosol form of fine particles dispersed in a gas. An obvious prerequisite for therapeutic efficacy is the ability of the aerosolized drug to reach the peripheral airways. Typically only 10% of inhaled dose reaches the lower airways due to complex functional anatomy of the respiratory tract that prevents the entry of particulate matter. The extent of aerosol deposition in the pulmonary tract is difficult to predict because particles can come in vastly different shapes &amp; sizes. To account for shape and size, aerosol particles are described by their aerodynamic diameter.<br>
In recent years several strategies to improve drug delivery to respiratory system have been developed e.g. aerosolised microspheres, nanoparticles and large porous particles. Particulate carriers such as liposomes have many attractive features for pulmonary drug delivery. Liposomes are phospholipid vesicles that are biologically inert in nature, devoid of any antigenic, pyrogenic or allergic reactions and their components can be utilized as those of biological membranes. Liposomes have an aqueous volume, which is entirely enclosed by a membrane composed of lipid molecule. The drug molecules can either be encapsulated in aqueous phase or intercalated into the lipid bilayers.<br>
Liposomal encapsulation of compounds can localize and maintain the drug levels in the lungs for an extended period of time. Pharmacologically, there is also evidence that liposomal drugs can produce selective and prolonged effects with decreased systemic toxicity. Physicochemical properties of the entrapped species, the lipid composition of the vesicles and the site of pulmonary deposition are the factors essential in designing a liposomal formulation.<br>
Lyophilization is an excellent method to extend the shelf-life of liposomes. Lyophilization and reconstitution of drug-containing liposomes has been achieved without significant effect upon liposome size, release properties, ion gradients or trapping ability. In a study, more than 90% of entrapped drug is retained upon rehydration.<br>
Nebulization is probably the simplest and most effective way to deliver liposomes to the respiratory tract; nebulizers employ compressed gas or ultrasound to generate aerosols from aqueous solutions or suspensions of drugs.<br>

US 4895719 disclose a system and method for administering a drug, at a selected dose, via the respiratory tract. Spray-dried liposome particles containing the selected dose of the entrapped drug are released into the air in aerosolized form, either by entrainment in an air or propellant stream, or by release from a pressurized can containing a suspension of the liposomes in a fluorchlorocarbon solvent.<br>
Liposomes are recognized as a DDS that can improve the therapeutic efficacy and safety of a wide range of compounds. Three decades of research into liposomal drug delivery has led to vastly improved technology in terms of drug capture, vesicle stability and the design of the formulations  for  special  tasks.  In  parallel,  remarkable  advances  have  been  made  in<br>
4<br><br>
understanding and controlling behavior in vivo.<br>
For future successful development and commercialization of liposomal products key issues of stability, reproducibility, high encapsulation efficiency, particle size control, sterility assurance and scale-up are being successfully addressed. Further, the utility of liposome formulation technology at the floor of industry is to be explored by simplifying, standardizing and optimizing method of preparation and enhancing the storage stability of the product.<br>
The objective of the invention is to develop liposomal pulmonary drug delivery systems. Physicochemical properties of the entrapped species, the lipid composition of the vesicles and the site of pulmonary deposition are the factors essential in designing a liposomal formulation that will not only optimize pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles but also satisfy pharmaceutical requirements.<br>
The present invention overcomes or minimizes many of the problems which have limited systemic drug delivery by inhalation. Liposomal encapsulation of compounds can localize and maintain the drug for longer period of time. Nebulization is the simplest and most effective way to deliver the liposomes to the respiratory tract.<br>
The present invention is to develop a controlled release inhalation formulation of salbutamol with liposomal carrier system, establish its safety &amp; study its efficacy in comparison with conventional aerosol inhalation formulations.<br>

One objective of the invention is to develop a controlled release inhalation formulation of salbutamol sulphate with liposomal carrier system for a prolonged therapeutic effect.<br>
Other objective of the invention is to lyophilize the salbutamol liposomes to improve their long term stability.<br>
Other objective of the invention is to establish its safety of the salbutamol liposomes via<br>
5<br><br>
pulmonary route.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to establish its efficacy in comparison to the conventional marketed nebulizing solution formulations.<br>
Further objective of the invention is to study the deposition pattern of the drug in the pulmonary region.<br>
SUMMARY:<br>
The present invention discloses to a stable liposomal nebulizing inhalation formulation of salbutamol sulphate for use in nebulizing device for controlled drug delivery for pulmonary systems, wherein the said formulation comprises, Phospolipon 90G-1%; cholesterol- 0.25%; salbutamol sulphate 0.1%; chloroform-100ml; butylated hydroxyl anisole 0.01% to 0.02%; a-tocoferol-0.005% to 0.01%; and phosphate buffer pH (6.4). This invention is more particularly relates to nebulizing inhalation formulations containing liposomal carriers that can carry the drug into deep lung and maintain it at the site of action for a prolonged therapeutic effect.<br>
Three batches of four different formulations Nl, N2, N3 and N4 were prepared and subjected to stability studies. Formulations Nl and N2 are the final optimized formulations contained 0.005% and 0.010% of the anti-oxidant, butylated hydroxyl anisole respectively.<br>
Formulations N3 and N4 contained the anti-oxidant, a-tocoferol 0.01% and 0.02% respectively. As liposomal preparations are prone to oxidation, quantity of anti-oxidant plays an important role in the stability of the product.<br>

A stable liposomal nebulizing inhalation formulation of salbutamol sulphate, in which the formulation comprises, Phospolipon 90G-1%; cholesterol- 0.25%; salbutamol sulphate 0.1%; chloroform- 100ml; a-tocoferol 0.01% in phosphate buffer pH (6.4).<br>
A stable liposomal nebulizing inhalation formulation of salbutamol sulphate ,in which the formulation comprises, Phospolipon 90G-1%; cholesterol- 0.25%; salbutamol sulphate 0.1%; chloroform- 100ml; a-tocoferol 0.02% in phosphate buffer pH (6.4).<br>
The phospholipid is selected from phospholipon 90H, the hydrogenated form of phosphatidylcholine, and phospholipon 90G, the phosphatidyline choline enriched lecithin but, more preferably phospholipid is phospholin 90G.<br>
The solvent used to dissolve the lipid is selected from chloroform and methanol, but preferably chloroform.<br>
Thin film hydration method is selected for the preparation of salbutamol liposomes. The type of lipid, its concentration, drug to lipid ratio, concentration of other additives such as cholesterol, anti-oxidants, pH of the hydrating buffer, salt or base form of the drug were found to affect the drug entrapment as well as drug release from the liposomes to more or less extent. Rotation speed of rotovapour flask, quantity of glass beads, solvent system, shaking and sonication period, ratio of the batch size and the capacity of the rotary flask etc. are the process parameters that need to be optimized for liposomal preparation.<br>
The preparation of liposomes is optimized with respect to the solvent system, glass bead quantity and visicle sizing technique in which, the optimized ratio of glass beads and solvent quantity is 2:3 as it gives liposomes in the size of 10-20 (xm<br>
Drug to lipid ratio of 1:10 has showed the maximum drug entrapment in the liposomes. The salbutamol liposomes are found to be bilayered, circular structures under electron microscopy and the size of the liposomes observed are 1 to 5 urn The percentage drug entrapment in the aqueous layer of liposomes is 50 to 52%. The rate of diffusion of the salbutamol liposomes are extended for a period of 9 to 10 hrs. The net respirable fraction is found to be 20 to 24%.<br>
7<br><br>
The nebulizing formulation of salbutamol liposomes is prepared with isotonicity adjustments by calculating sodium chloride equivalents for all the ingredients.<br>
The pH of the phosphate buffer is 6.3 to 6.4 suitable to prepare isotonic nebulizing dispersions. The structure of the liposomes is bilamellar and trilamellar under optical microscopy. The percent drug entrapment in liposomes is 48 to 52%.<br>
The in vitro studies showed, 65-70% drug release by the end of 6hrs, 85-90% by the end of 8hrs and the entire drug is released by the end of 9-10hrs.<br>
The nebulizing formulation comprises anti oxidants such as butylated hydroxy anisole and a-tocoferol.<br>
The salbutamol liposomal nebulizing dispersions are stable at 5°C, 25°, 60% RH for one year. The shelf life for the product is 12months when stored between 5-8°C. Guinea pig is used as animal model for toxicity studies of the liposomal inhalations. Formulations did not show any chronic toxicity, as there were no significant histopathological changes in the lungs, after administration of nebulized liposomal dispersions for prolonged period of 3 weeks, two times a day.<br>
Acute toxicity studies at a dose level, 7 times more than that of therapeutic dose showed dose dependent reversible degeneration in the histopathology.<br>
At higher dose levels, which are 14 times more than therapeutic dose, irreversible damage to lungs is observed.<br>
The anti-histamic effect of pharmacodynamic studies such as branchial hyper reactivity and whole body plethysmography is in vivo.<br>
Nose-only method is the technique used for in-vivo evaluation of performance of aerosol in animals.<br>
Salbutamol liposomes are lyophilized to improve their long term stability. The percent protection of liposomal nebulizing solution of salbutamol sulphate to histamine induced asthmatic attack is 7 times more than marketed formulations when challenged immediately as well as 4hrs.<br>
Detailed Description:<br>
The present invention relates to a stable pharmaceutical aerosol formulation which can be administered by the pulmonary route.  The  use of aerosols  for the  administration of<br>
8<br><br>
medicaments by peripheral aerial pathways has been known for several decades. Targeted drug delivery for pulmonary diseases can be achieved by administration via inhalation route. Higher therapeutic index is achieved as aerosol inhalations deliver therapeutic agents to the diseased regions of lungs whilst reducing their distribution to other organs.<br>
The deposition of aerosol can be improved with the help of particulate carriers that can carry the drug deep into the lungs and maintain it at the site of action for a longer period; liposomes are one of such drug delivery carriers. Their suitability lies in their natural origin, similar to those in lung secretions.<br>
Inhalation aerosols are generally administered by nebulizers, pressurized Meter Dose Inhalers (MDI) or Dry Powder Inhalers (DPI).<br>

1)	Preparation of salbutamol liposomes<br>
2)	Characterization of salbutamol liposomes<br>
3)	Preparation of nebulising dispersions<br>
4)	Stability studies of the liposomal nebulising dispersions<br>
5)	lyophilization of salbutamol liposomes<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of Salbutamol Liposomes:<br>
A variety of lipids is used in the preparation of liposomes. 'Thin Film Hydration method' is a<br>
method of choice for preparation of liposomes. Phospholipon® 90 H, the hydrogenated form of<br>
phosphatidylcholine gave liposomal vesicles with large size of 20-30 um. Phospholipon® 90<br>
G; the Phosphatidylcholine enriched lecithin gave maximum liposomes in the range 10-20 um.<br>
9<br><br>
In order to prepare salbutamoi -loaded liposomes, salbutamoi base as well as salbutamoi sulphate are used. In case of salbutamoi base liposomes, the dispersions are found to discolour gradually by the end of three weeks. Comparative study of liposomal dispersions prepared with various lipids-food grade lecithin, phospholipon 90H and phospholipon 90 G is given in table 1. A series of formulations of liposomal dispersions (Fl to F7 with salbutamoi base and Gl G7 with salbutamoi sulphate) is prepared with various concentrations of the base as well as salbutamoi sulphate ranging from 0.15 to 1.5% as described under table 2. The liposomal dispersions are studied for physical appearance, texture, settling rate, redispersibility and optical microscopy.<br>

Process is optimized with respect to the solvent system (liposomal formulations with different solvent blends such as HI, H2, H3), glass bead quantity (formulations with varying proportions of glass beads such as II, 12, 13 and 14) and vesicle sizing technique(optimization of viscicle sizing with different shaking times of formulations Jl, J2, J3,and J4). The details are given in table 5. As a solvent system for lipid film formation, chloroform alone is found to give desired film uniformity as compared to its combination with methanol.<br>

Glass beads: solvent quantity ratio when studied, 2: 3 ratio is found to be the optimum as it gave liposomes size in the range of 10-20um and vesicular clusters are separated.<br>
A standardized method of mechanical shaking and sonication is proved to be a suitable technique for vesicle sizing. Four hours shaking with intermittent sonication for 1 min, after every 30min of shaking gives desired vesicle size, which is l-3μm whereas excessive shaking resulted into breaking of the dispersion.<br>
The formula is optimized for the basic components like lipid concentration and drug to lipid ratio. Formulations Kl, K2, K3, K4 and K5 with varying concentrations of phospholipon 90G with salbutamol sulphate is prepared and observed the physical properties of the formulations and size of the liposomes. The physical property of the salbutamol sulphate liposomes is observed under electron microscopy. Electron micrographs of the salbutamol sulphate liposomes confirmed the circular bilamellar structure of the viscicle size 1-3 [i as shown in fig 1 and 2. Formulations of LI, L2 and L3 are prepared with varying proportions of drug to lipid ratio and observed the physico -chemical studies.

% Drug entrapment values were obtained by taking average of six observations.<br>
Drug: lipid ratio 1:10 has shown the maximum drug entrapment in the liposomes (table 6). The formulation is also found to have satisfactory physical properties.<br>
Optimization of other components of the liposomal formulation such as cholesterol concentration, butylated hydroxyl anisole (BHA) concentration and pH of the hydrating buffer is carried out with the help of 3 Factorial Design. The concentrations of the three components are varied at three different levels of low, medium and high.<br>
The concentration of BHA has slight effect on the percent drug entrapment where as pH of hydrating buffer has significant effect and cholesterol concentration has no significant effect on the percent drug entrapment.<br>
The factorial design model is further reduced to 23 by considering the three variables at two levels, low and high. They are studied in terms of the percent drug entrapment. It is observed from these studies that cholesterol concentration in the formulation has significant effect on the percent drug released from the liposomes. The pH of the hydrating buffer also has some effect on the percent drug released. However, BHA concentration has absolutely no significant effect on this study parameter.<br>
The antioxidant BHA is replaced by another antioxidant a-tocoferol. From the previous studies, cholesterol concentration is optimized to 0.25% and hence the study design is reduced to 2 factorial levels. Concentration of a-tocoferol and pH of the hydrating buffer are varied at two levels, high and low and the formulations are studied in terms of the percent drug entrapment and percent drug released. Both a-tocoferol concentration and pH of the hydrating buffer have slight effect on the percent drug entrapped. Release of<br>
17<br><br>
the drug from liposomes is mainly affected by the pH of the hydrating buffer. The pH of the buffer 6.4 has shown maximum drug entrapment and the release is extended for 10 hours.<br>
The effect of process variables viz. rotation speed and ratio of batch volume to rotary flask capacity is studied for the formulations prepared by optimized formula. The maximum drug entrapment is found at a lower rotation speed of 30 rpm where as with the maximum rotation speed, the drug entrapment is found to minimum.<br>
Optimum ratio of batch volume: rotary flask volume is found to be 1: 6.5. Maximum drug entrapment is obtained at this ratio.<br>
Morphology of the liposomes, its drug entrapment, the percent drug released from liposomes is determined by the components of the formulation as well as the processing parameters.<br>
The final formulations of salbutamol liposomes prepared for stability studies and optimized process variables are shown in table 7.<br>

As formulations with BHA and a-tocoferol did not show much difference in the drug entrapment and release profile with respect to their concentration used as well as no added advantages over the other, salbutamol liposomal formulations with both the antioxidants having two different concentrations are further subjected to accelerated stability studies.<br>
Example 2<br>
Characterization of Salbutamol Liposomes:<br>
The liposomes are characterized for their physical attributes such as shape, size and size<br>
distribution, lamellarity, percent drug entrapped and drug release profile. To determine<br>
the percent drug entrapment in the salbutamol liposomes, a technique of centrifugation is<br>
adopted for separating unentrapped drug, followed by colorimetric estimation of the drug<br>
content. Percent drug entrapment for salbutamol liposomes are found in the range of 50-<br>
52%.<br>
The DSC thermogram is carried out for various liposomes such as empty liposomes along<br>
with cholesterol, without cholesterol, salbutamol liposomes along with cholesterol and<br>
again without cholesterol. From the DSC thermograms of liposomal dispersions of<br>
salbutamol confirmed that cholesterol gets into the lipid bilayers and gives rigidity to the<br>
lipoidal walls and salbutamol sulphate is situated in the aqueous compartment of the<br>
liposomes.<br>
Transmission Electron Microscopy studies are confirmed the bilamellar structure of the vesicles. The vesicle size of the liposomes is in the range of 1-2 um. The Dynamic Light Scattering studies have confirmed the size of the liposomes, which is in the range of 1-3μm.<br>
19<br><br>
The rate of diffusion is studied through a diffusion bag showed release extended over the period of 9-10 hours. The unentrapped portion of the drug, which is about 50%, available within first 2hours. Subsequent release of the drug from the entrapped portion is about 70% in 6 hours and 85-90% by the end of 8 hours.<br>
In-vitro pulmonary deposition studies are carried out by Twin Impinge apparatus. It is found that, 72-77 % of drug deposited in the device and 2-4 % in the stage I. The Net Respirable Fraction, which is indicated by stage II, is found to be 20-24%.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of Nebulizing solution:<br>
Nebulizing solutions are usually formulated in water, although other cosolvents such as<br>
glycerine, propylene glycol and ethanol may be used. Nebulizing solutions needs to be<br>
iso-osmotic and hence an osmotic agent has to be added in the formulation. For preparing<br>
nebulizing solution of the salbutamol liposomes, isotonicity adjustments are done by<br>
calculating sodium chloride equivalents for all the ingredients. However, the additional<br>
quantity of sodium chloride required for isotonicity adjustment is taken care by the<br>
sodium chloride from the phosphate buffer pH 6.4 and hence, no extra sodium chloride is<br>
needed in the formulation.<br>
Formulations are prepared and evaluated for physico-chemical characteristics. White colour, fine, uniform dispersion with pH in the range of 6.3-6.5 is prepared. Optical microscopy has showen bi-tri lamellar structure. Laser diffraction studies by Malvern Mastersizer has showed that 90% of the particles are in the range 1-3 urn. Electron Microscopy has confirmed the bilamellar structure of the liposomes. Percent drug entrapment in liposomes is found in the range of 48-52%. Total drug content is 99-102%.<br>
In-vitro diffusion studies have showed the release of about 40% of the dose in first 2 hours, which is the unentrapped portion immediately available for the action. By the end of 6 hours, 65-70% of salbutamol sulphate is released and 85-90% of salbutamol sulphate<br>
20<br><br>
is released by the end of 8 hours and by the end of 9-10 hours, the entire drug is released.<br>
Example 4<br>
Stability studies of the Liposomal Nebulizing solution:<br>
Three batches of four different formulations Nl, N2, N3 and N4 are prepared and<br>
subjected to stability studies.   Formulations Nl and N2 are the final and optimized<br>
formulations contained 0.005% and 0.010% of the anti-oxidant, butylated hydroxyl<br>
anisole (BHA) respectively. Formulations N3 and N4 contained another anti- oxidant, a-<br>
tocoferol 0.01% and 0.02% respectively. As liposomal preparations are prone to<br>
oxidation, the quantity of anti-oxidants plays an important role in the stability of the<br>
product.<br>
Hence, stability study is carried out with two different anti-oxidants at two levels of concentrations.<br>
The four formulations i.e. formulations containing two different antioxidants with two different concentrations are subjected to accelerated stability studies at 5°C, 25°C at 60% RH and 40°C at 75% RH. The samples are withdrawn at the end of 1, 2 and 3 months and evaluated for physical appearance, redispersibility, drug entrapment, drug content, particle size and release profile. The stability data of 3 months is summarized under tables 8-9. The stability study is further continued up to at 5°C and 25°C at 60% RH. Samples are with drawn at the end of 6 and 12 months and analyzed the results, which are given in tables 10-13.<br>

The liposomal nebulizing dispersions of salbutamol sulphate are found to be stable at 5°C and 25°C, 60% RH. The liposomal nebulizing dispersions of salbutamol sulphate are found to be more stable at 5°C for 12 months. Leakage of the entrapped drug is observed at 40°C at 75% RH and found to increase with the increasing exposure, a-tocoferol is found to be more acceptable anti-oxidant, in comparison with BHA.<br>
26<br><br>
Example 5<br>
Lyophilization:<br>
Lyophilization of liposomal dispersion of salbutamol results in a dry, waxy mass. Almost 12-15% of the entrapped drug is lost during the process of lyophilization. DSC thermograms of lyophilized liposomes showed the formation of a new entity when compared with the individual DSC scans.<br>
Scanning Electron Microscopy has confirmed the bilamellar structure of the liposomes even after the process of lyophilization. The lyophilized liposomes of salbutamol sulphate can not be formulated as MDI preparations due to its poor dispensability in the propellant HFA 134a.<br>
Liposomal nebulizing solution for reconstitution can be formulated with 10-15 %, escape of the drug from the liposomes. The lamellar structure of the liposomes in the reconstituted product is unaltered but, showed slight increase in the vesicle size from 1-5 umto 5-10 urn.<br>
Example 6<br>
Toxicity studies of liposomal inhalations<br>
Guinea pig is used as animal model for toxicity studies of the liposomal inhalations.<br>
Ultrasonic nebulizer with nose applicator is found to be convenient for administration of<br>
the test nebulizing substance to the animals.<br>
The formulations did not show any chronic toxicity, as there are no significant histopathological changes in the lungs, after administration of nebulized liposomal dispersions for prolonged period of 3 weeks, two times a day.<br>
Acute toxicity studies at a dose level 7 times more than that of therapeutic dose showed dose dependent reversible degeneration in the histopathology. At a higher dose level, which is 14 times more than the therapeutic dose, irreversible damage to lungs is observed. This indicates high margin of safety.<br>
The placebo studies have confirmed mild to moderate congestion and interstitial pneumonia at the same dose levels indicating the safety of the excipients even at higher<br>
27<br><br>
concentrations.<br>
Example 6<br>
Pharmacodynamic studies on Liposomal Nebulizing Solutions:<br>
Two methods are applied in order to study the efficacy of the liposomal inhalation of<br>
salbutamol.<br>
a.	Bronchial Hyper reactivity by Whole Body exposure method and Nose- Only<br>
Exposure method.<br>
b.	Whole Body Plethysmography.<br>
Bronchial Hyper reactivity:<br>
i) Whole Body Exposure method:<br>
The marketed sample has showed percent protection to bronchial hyper-reactivity in the range of 160-180%, 20min after administration; where as the percent protection by the liposomal nebulizing solution of salbutamol sulphate is in the range of 275-290%.<br>
When histamine challenge is given after 8 hours, the percent protection to bronchial hyper-reactivity of the marketed preparation is reduced to 85-95%; where as the liposomal nebulizing solution of salbutamol sulphate showed the percent protection between 165-180%.<br>
ii) Nose Only Exposure Method:<br>
The protection to bronchial hyper-reactivity is found to improve by Nose-Only Exposure Method. The marketed preparation has showed 225-235%) protection, immediately 30 min after the administration of the drug; where as that for liposomal nebulizing solution, the protection to bronchial hyper-activity is in the range of 380-395%), showing better protection.<br>
The anti-asthmatic effect after 8 hours is found to reduce around 130%) for the<br>
28<br><br>
marketed preparation, where as for the liposomal preparation it is found to be around 225%.<br>

It is clearly revealed from the studies that after the treatment with the antiasthmatic formulations in the form of liposomal nebulizing dispersions, there is a decrease in the pulmonary airway resistance when challenged by histamine, 30min as well as 8 hours after the administration.<br>
This is indicated the potential of proposed controlled release pattern obtained from the salbutamol liposomal nebulizing dispersions.<br>
b. Whole Body Plethysmography:<br>
The average percent protection after 30 minutes of the histamine challenge is<br>
found to be 86.49% and 73.83%, for the marketed conventional nebulizing<br>
preparation and the liposomal nebulizing solution respectively. The average<br>
percent protection after 4 hours is found to be 7.16% and 51.28% for the marketed<br>
preparation and the liposomal nebulizing solution respectively.<br>
The study performed using Whole Body Plethysmometer showed that the<br>
conventional marketed inhalation and liposomal nebulizing dispersion has good<br>
antiasthmatic effect immediately after the inhalation.<br>
The liposomal nebulizing solution of salbutamol sulphate has showed better<br>
percent protection to the histamine induced asthmatic attack in the guinea pigs,<br>
immediately after 30min as well as after 4 hours.<br>
29<br><br>
When compared with the marketed preparation, the liposomal preparation has showed the percent protection almost 7 times more than the marketed preparation, when challenged immediately and after 4 hours. Thus, the prolonged therapeutic effect of the liposomal preparation is confirmed.<br>
Description of drawing:<br>
Fig 1 and Fig 2 illustrates the physical appearance of the salbutamol sulphate liposomes under electron microscopy. Electron micrographs of the salbutamol sulphate liposomes confirmed the circular bilammellar structure of the viscicles and the viscicles size is in the range of 1-3 um.<br>
