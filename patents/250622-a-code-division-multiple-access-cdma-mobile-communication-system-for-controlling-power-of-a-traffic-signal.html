				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a power control device and method for a<br>
mobile communication system, and more particularly, to a power control device<br>
and method of controlling a gain of pilot signals and a compensation gain of<br>
traffic signals in a different manner, respectively.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
It is common to employ code division multiple access (CDMA)<br>
technology for a mobile communication system. In the CDMA mobile<br>
communication system, a receiver receives pilot signals via a pilot channel,<br>
which is among the channels used for receiving frame signals transmitted from a<br>
transmission party, and measures the strength of the received pilot signals. The<br>
receiver generates a power control signal based on the strength of the pilot<br>
signals and sends the generated power control signal back to the transmission<br>
party. The transmission party compares the strength of the pilot channel signal<br>
with a reference value (or threshold) for the power control. If the strength of<br>
the pilot channel signal is lower than the reference value, the receiver sends a<br>
power-up signal; otherwise, the receiver sends a power-down signal.<br>
In the case where the channel surroundings are poor during<br>
communication with a base station at a specific frequency, a mobile station<br>
searches for another base station with better channel surroundings that uses a<br>
different frequency. This is a preliminary step that the mobile station performs<br>
for a hard handoff . The mobile station, while searching for a new frequency,<br>
sends the pilot signals at the new frequency temporarily before returning to the<br>
original frequency. In some cases, transmission of the traffic signals may<br>
temporarily be discontinued to the presently connected base station during an<br>
interval where the pilot signals are transmitted at the new frequency.<br>
As stated above, the traffic signals are punctured during an interval where<br>
the pilot signals are transmitted at another frequency, resulting in a loss of energy.<br>
In order to compensate for the loss of energy, the transmitter increases power of<br>
the non-punctured frame signals. This is further detailed below.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a device for controlling power during transmission of a<br>
punctured frame on a reverse link, in accordance with the related art, in which<br>
signals are composed of pilot signals and traffic signals. Referring to FIG. 1, a<br>
controller 100 controls the entire operation of a receiver. The controller 100<br>
controls a pilot signal generator 110, a traffic signal generator 120, and a first<br>
signal controller 180 according to signalling information, e.g., data rate,<br>
puncturing start time and puncturing interval, etc., received from an upper layer.<br>
Under the control of the controller 100, the pilot signal generator 110 generates<br>
pilot signals and outputs the generated pilot signals to a first power controller<br>
130. Upon receipt of the pilot signals, the first power controller 130 controls the<br>
power of the pilot signals using a predetermined gain GP and outputs the power<br>
controlled pilot signals to a signal combiner 150. Similarly, the traffic signal<br>
generator 120, under the control of the controller 100, generates traffic signals<br>
and outputs the generated traffic signals to a second power controller 140. Upon<br>
receipt of the traffic signals, the second power controller 140 controls the power<br>
of the traffic signals using a predetermined gain GT and outputs the power<br>
controlled traffic signals to the signal combiner 150. A ratio of the pilot power<br>
from the first power controller 130 to the traffic power from the second power<br>
controller 140 is set to a predetermined value. The signal combiner 150 combines<br>
the traffic signals and the pilot signals received from the first and second power<br>
controllers 130 and 140, respectively.<br>
Also, the controller 100 calculates a compensation gain for a puncturing<br>
interval based on information concerning the puncturing start time and<br>
puncturing interval received from the upper layer. After completion of the<br>
calculation, the controller 100 outputs the puncturing interval and the calculated<br>
compensation gain to the first signal controller 180. Then, the first signal<br>
controller 180 outputs the received compensation gain to a multiplier 170 during<br>
the puncturing interval.<br>
The multiplier 170 multiplies the combined signals of the pilot signals and<br>
the traffic signals as, outputted from the signal combiner 150, by the<br>
compensation gain, and outputs the result to a second signal controller 160. The<br>
second signal controller 160 receives the compensated pilot signals and traffic<br>
signals and adjusts power control according to the condition of the transmission<br>
channels. If a mobile station searches for another base station having a different<br>
frequency, puncturing occurs after signal controlling is performed by the second<br>
signal controller 160. Thus, both the pilot signals and the traffic signals are<br>
punctured during the same time interval.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates power distribution for a punctured frame. When a frame<br>
is not punctured, the non-punctured frame will be transmitted with a constant<br>
gain GA without a power loss over the entire frame duration A. However, when<br>
the frame is punctured causing at a puncturing time A<br>
the non-punctured durations B has additional<br>
gain of GB -at the puncturing time A<br>
In conclusion, the total power gain for the punctured frame<br>
outputted from the multiplier 170 is GTotal=GA+GB.<br>
In the case where the punctured frame is transmitted in the above power<br>
control method, the transmission power for the non-punctured portion is<br>
increased consequently causing an increase in the transmission power for the<br>
pilot signals, which results in the estimated power of the pilot channel being<br>
higher than a reference value during most time intervals. Thus, the power control<br>
signal is generated as a power-down signal. This power control method however<br>
cannot provide maintenance of a reception performance at the receiver, since the<br>
reception performance for decoding the punctured frame is maintained only with<br>
a continuous increase in the gain by that time interval for decoding the punctured<br>
traffic frame. To avoid such an impairment, the transmitter performs power<br>
control ignoring the power-down signal among the power control signals fed<br>
back from the receiver, after having decreased during fading and having then<br>
recovered therefrom.<br>
As described above, the transmitter ignores the power-down signal among<br>
the power control signals fed back from the receiver such that only the power-up<br>
signal is activated with the power-down signal inactivated after having recovered<br>
from a deep fading, resulting in a waste of power.<br>
Furthermore, another problem arises in that data transmission with high<br>
power causes an increase in interference on the reverse link and reduces the<br>
capacity of the reverse link.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a device and<br>
method for controlling power during the transmission of a punctured frame, in<br>
which the punctured traffic data frame can be power controlled under a<br>
power-up/down signal in the same manner as a non-punctured traffic data frame<br>
by controlling the gain for the power of the punctured traffic data frame only,<br>
and without compensating the gain for pilot signals.<br>

control method in transmission of a punctured frame in a mobile communication<br>
system is provided, including the steps of: determining whether an input frame<br>
during a hard handoff is punctured or not; when the frame is punctured,<br>
determining whether information is received regarding a data rate of the frame<br>
and a punctured length; when the information is received, calculating a<br>
compensation gain from the data rate and the punctured length; determining<br>
whether a frame boundary is detected or not; and when the frame boundary is<br>
detected, generating the compensation gain to a multiplier to compensate a loss<br>
of power for traffic signals.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, well known functions or constructions are not described in detail<br>
since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
In a power control method according to the present invention, a ratio of<br>
pilot signal power to traffic signal power is different for a punctured frame and a<br>
non-punctured frame. That is, when the traffic frame is not punctured, the pilot<br>
signals and the traffic signals are controlled with respect to their transmission<br>
power with a pilot signal power gain (hereinafter, called GP) and a traffic signal<br>
power gain (hereinafter, called GT), respectively; and when the traffic frame is<br>
punctured, the GP is maintained and only the GT is given a compensation gain for<br>
the transmission signals the loss of power. When power for the pilot channel to<br>
generate a power control signal is measured in this case, it is possible to produce<br>
the same power control signal irrespective of the punctured frame or the<br>
non-punctured frame of the transmission signal, and also to perform power<br>
control with respect to the power control signal fed back to a transmitter that<br>
generates the punctured frame.<br>
There are two methods according to the present invention for performing<br>
a power control where the pilot signals' power gain ratio differs from that of the<br>
traffic signals'.<br>
In a first method, each frame of the traffic signal is monitored during an<br>
inter-frequency hard handoff to determine if any frames are punctured. When a<br>
punctured frame is detected, the compensation gain is calculated and then only<br>
the traffic signals are compensated for a loss of power according to the<br>
compensation gain as calculated prior to the stage where the pilot signals and the<br>
traffic signals are combined together.<br>
In a second method, a predetermined compensation gain for a length of<br>
the puncturing interval is stored in a memory and, when a punctured frame is<br>
input, a corresponding gain value GT is read out from the memory for<br>
compensation. A loss of power is proportional to the puncturing time and may be<br>
restricted according to a maximum gain value that the transmitter can transmit. It<br>
is also possible to determine the compensation gain differently from the loss of<br>
power in order to compensate for the deterioration of performance of the traffic<br>
channel that may be incurred due to an inappropriate power ratio between the<br>
traffic signals and the pilot signals.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a device for controlling power during transmission of a<br>
punctured frame according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A power compensation device according to the present invention<br>
comprises a power compensator 301, a signal generator 305, a signal combiner<br>
350 and a second signal controller 360. The signal generator 305, under the<br>
control of a controller (not shown), generates traffic signals and pilot signals.<br>
The pilot signals are provided to the signal combiner 350 and the traffic signals<br>
are provided to the power compensator 301. The power compensator 301<br>
receives data rate information from an upper layer to control the signal generator<br>
305, which generates the traffic signals and the pilot signals. The power<br>
compensator 301 also receives puncturing information for a puncturing start time<br>
and a puncturing interval from the upper layer in order to calculate a<br>
compensation gain so that the power gain of the traffic signals received from the<br>
signal generator 305 are compensated for using the calculated compensation gain.<br>
The power compensator 301 then outputs the compensated traffic signals to the<br>
signal combiner 350. The signal combiner 350 combines the compensated traffic<br>
signals received from the power compensator 301 with the pilot signals from the<br>
signal generator 305, and outputs the combined signals to the second signal<br>
controller 360. The second signal controller 360 controls the power of the<br>
combined signals received from the signal combiner 350.<br>
As described above, the present invention does not compensate the power<br>
of the combined signals from the signal combiner 350 as illustrated in the prior<br>
art devices in FIG. 1, but compensates the power of the traffic signals only and<br>
then combines the pilot signals with the compensated traffic signals at the signal<br>
combiner 350, thereby leaving the pilot signals uncompensated.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a more detailed block diagram of the power control<br>
device shown in FIG. 6.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the signal generator 305 of FIG. 6 is comprised of a<br>
traffic signal generator 320, a pilot signal generator 310, a first power controller<br>
330 and a second power controller 340. This construction performs the same<br>
operation as detailed in FIG. 1. The power compensator 301 of FIG. 6 comprises<br>
a controller 300, a first signal controller 380 and a multiplier 370. The controller<br>
300 receives data rate information from the upper layer to control the traffic<br>
signal generator 320 and the pilot signal generator 310, which generate traffic<br>
signals and pilot signals respectively. Also, the controller 300 receives<br>
puncturing information for a puncturing start time and a puncturing interval from<br>
the upper layer to calculate a compensation gain for a non-punctured duration,<br>
i.e., an interval to be compensated, and supplies the calculated compensation<br>
gain to the first signal controller 380. The compensation gain is determined by<br><br>
The first signal controller 380 outputs to the multiplier 370 a gain signal<br>
having the compensation gain in the power compensation interval. The multiplier<br>
370 multiplies the traffic signals received from the second power controller 340<br>
by the gain signal from first signal controller 380 having the compensation gain<br>
and outputs the result to the signal combiner 350.<br>
Although the controller 300 calculates the compensation gain in this<br>
embodiment, the controller 300 may supply puncturing information received<br>
from the upper layer to the first signal controller 380, which then calculates the<br>
compensation gain according to the received puncturing information and applies<br>
the compensation gain signal having the compensation gain to the multiplier 370.<br>
The power control device according to the present invention may further<br>
comprises a memory 390. The memory 390 is provided with a table of the<br>
compensation gains based on the puncturing intervals, i.g., punctured lengths.<br>
When another base station with a different frequency is searched for and a<br>
puncture occurs, the controller 300 receives a puncturing start time and a<br>
puncturing length from the upper layer and retrieves the compensation gain for<br>
the puncturing length from the memory 390. Then, the controller 300 applies the<br>
compensation gain to the first signal controller 380 to compensate the<br>
puncturing interval of the traffic signals.<br>
A. First Embodiment<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a method of varying a ratio of GP to GT,<br>
in which the controller 300 calculates the compensation gain in order to perform<br>
power control.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the controller 300 checks in step 401 whether<br>
puncturing information is received from the upper layer, to determine whether a<br>
frame is punctured or not. If the puncturing information is received from the<br>
upper layer, the controller 300 determines a compensation gain from the<br>
puncturing information in step 405 and outputs the determined compensation<br>
gain to the first signal controller 380 in step 407. At this time, the first signal<br>
controller 380 outputs a compensation gain signal having the compensation gain<br>
in a non-puncturing interval of the frame. Alternatively, if no puncturing<br>
information is received from the upper layer, the controller 300 informs the first<br>
signal controller 380 that it will output a compensation gain as "1" at step 402.<br>
During a power compensation for the puncturing interval of the frame, the<br>
controller 300 checks in step 409 whether a boundary between the punctured<br>
frame and the non-punctured frame is detected, that is, the end of the punctured<br>
frame, or the next frame of the punctured frame. Upon detection of the frame<br>
boundary, the controller 300 outputs in step 411 a frame boundary signal to the<br>
first signal controller 380 to inform that the frame boundary has been detected at<br>
step 411. As the frame boundary signal is received, the first signal controller 380<br>
outputs the compensation gain as "1" at step 402. If the frame boundary is not<br>
detected at step 409, the compensation gain calculated in step 405 continues to<br>
be output to the first controller 380 in step 407.<br>
B. Second Embodiment<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a method of varying a ratio of GP to GT<br>
as a power control method in transmission of a punctured frame according to a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the controller 300 checks in step 501 whether<br>
puncturing information is received from an upper layer, to determine whether a<br>
frame is punctured or not. If the puncturing information is received from the<br>
upper layer in step 501, the controller 300 detects a punctured length contained<br>
in the puncturing information, retrieves the compensation gain for the punctured<br>
length from the memory 390 in step 505 and outputs the compensation gain to<br>
the first signal controller 380 in step 506. Alternatively, if no puncturing<br>
information is received from the upper layer, the controller 300 informs the first<br>
signal controller 380 that it will output a compensation gain as "1" at step 502.<br>
During a power compensation for the puncturing interval of the frame, the<br>
controller 300 checks in step 507 whether a boundary between the punctured<br>
frame and the non-punctured frame is detected, that is, the end of the punctured<br>
frame, or the next frame of the punctured frame. Upon detection of the frame<br>
boundary, the controller 300 informs the first signal controller 380 that the frame<br>
boundary has been detected at step 509. As the frame boundary signal is received,<br>
the first signal controller 380 outputs the compensation gain as "1" at step 502.<br>
If the frame boundary is not detected at step 507, the compensation gain<br>
calculated in step 505 continues to be output to the first controller 380 in step<br>
506. More specifically, in step 506, the controller 300 outputs a compensation<br>
gain value to the first signal controller 380 in the same manner as in step 407 of<br>
FIG. 4. The first signal controller 380 then outputs a compensation gain signal<br>
having the compensation gain value at non-punctured durations of the punctured<br>
frame. However, upon failure to receive puncturing information, the controller<br>
300 enables the first signal controller 380 to output a compensation gain value of<br>
"1". During power compensation for the punctured portions, the controller 300<br>
examines in step 507 whether a boundary of the punctured frame, i.e., an end of<br>
the punctured frame or a beginning of a next frame is detected or not, in the same<br>
manner as in step 409. Upon detection of the frame boundary, the controller 300<br>
outputs in step 509 a frame boundary signal to the first signal controller 380 to<br>
inform detection of the frame boundary. The first signal controller 380 then<br>
outputs a compensation gain value of "1".<br>
Accordingly, the mobile communication system according to the present<br>
invention can perform an accurate power control so as to prevent a waste of<br>
transmission power at the mobile station, as a result of which the mobile station<br>
can enhance its standby time for receiving the input signals.<br>
It is furthermore possible to reduce interference from other channels<br>
caused by an unnecessary consumption of transmission power.<br>
