SPECIFICATION Coloring Composition and Coloring Method<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a coloring composition, a coloring method and an article colored with the coloring composition and more partictdarly to a coloring composition which permits the clear and uniform coloration of a substance to be colored such as a fibrous structure, a method for coloring such substance and an article colored with the coloring composition.<br>
Background Art<br>
As techniques for coloring articles (a substance to be colored), for instance, fibrous structures such as yams or threads, cloths, woven goods, knitted goods, and nonwoven fabrics, there have conventionally been tried a variety of coloring methods such as the dip dyeing technique in which a fibrous stmicture is dipped in a coloring composition, and the printing technique in which a fibrous structure is colored using a transfer-controlling plate such as a silk screen printing plate, a stencil printing plate, a rehef printing plate, an intaglio printing plate, and a lithographic printing plate.<br>
In the dip dyeing technique, a dye is used as a coloring dye, a fibrous structure is dipped in such a dye composition under heating and pressurizing conditions to thus make the dye penetrate into the fibrous structure, or such a fibrous structure is stirred and kneaded in the dye composition to uniformly adhere the dye to the structure and to thus prevent the formation of any color spot and/or the occurrence of any insufficient coloration. After the completion of the coloring step, the colored fibrous structure is washed with water or an aqueous solvent to remove any excess coloring component and to thus give a colored fibrous structure having good fastness of color without impairing the aesthetic property of the structure.<br><br>
There have been proposed various kinds of coloring dye compositions suitably used for coloring naturally occurring fibrous materials such as those obtained from cotton, hemp, silk, and wool fibers as well as synthetic fibrous materials such as those made of polyester, acrylic, rayon and nylon fibers, while appropriately selecting the kinds of dyes used as dyestviffs for coloration and they have widely been used for the coloration of a variety of fibrous materials such as those hsted above. However, this technique suffers from such a drawback that a specific dye should be properly selected depending on each particvdar fibrous material for the coloration since the technique makes use of a dye as a dyestuff for coloration. In particular, when coloring a mixed fibrous material comprising at least two different fibrous materials, this technique should use a plurality of coloring compositions or a plurahty of coloring steps.<br>
Moreover, the technique requires, in the coloring and/or washing processes, the use of a large quantity of energy and a large amount of industrial water for the heating, pressurizing, stirring and washing steps. This in turn leads to the discharge of a large amount of waste water and therefore, there has been desired for the development of a novel coloring method and a novel coloring composition in the fight of, for instance, the achievement of a high energy efficiency, the effective use of water resources and the prevention of any environmental pollution.<br>
In the printing (or dye transfer) technique, the transfer-controlling plate can be used for controUing the amount of the dye to be adhered and the area to which the dye is adhered when adheiing a coloring composition to a fibrous structure and accordingly, this technique is an excellent coloring method which permits the high quahty and highly precise coloration of, for instance, fine designs and patterns, pictorial symbols, dabbed patterns and/or gradated patterns. The coloring composition used in the dye trainsfer technique must be prepared so as to have such a viscosity that the transfer-controUing plate can normally show its function and in case of, for instance, a silk screen printing plate, the viscosity of the composition should be controlled to such a level that the composition does not<br><br>
cause any leakage through the mesh of the screen. The coloring agent used in this technique may be either dyes or pigments.<br>
When using a dye, the colored fibrous structure is washed with water or an aqueous solvent, after the coloring step, to remove any excess coloring component and to thus give a colored fibrous structure having good fastness of color without impairing the aesthetic property of the structure, like the dip dyeing technique. There have been proposed various kinds of coloring dye compositions suitably used for coloring naturally occurring fibrous materials such as those obtained from cotton, hemp, silk, and wool fibers as well as synthetic fibrous materials such as those made of polyester, acryUc, rayon and nylon fibers, while appropriately selecting the kinds of dyes to be used and they have widely been used for the coloration of a variety of fibrous materials such as those hsted above.<br>
On the other hand, when using a pigment, a binder shoiold be used for firmly adhering the pigment per se to a fibrous structure and accordingly, there has been used a coloring composition simultaneously comprising a polymer compound as a binder.<br>
However, the dye transfer technique, which makes use of a coloring composition containing a dye, likewise suffers from such a drawback that a specific dye should be properly selected depending on each particular fibrous material for the coloration since the technique makes use of a dye as a dyestuff for coloration. Like the dip dyeing technique. In particular, when coloring a mixed fibrous material comprising at least two different fibrous materials, this technique should use a plurahty of coloring compositions or a plurality of coloring steps.<br>
Accordingly, this technique requires, in the coloring and/or washing processes, the use of a large quantity of energy and a large amount of industrial water for the heating, pressurizing, stirring and washing steps. This in turn leads to the discharge of a large amount of waste water. Therefore, there has likewise been desired for the development of a novel coloring method and a novel coloring<br><br>
composition in the light of, for instance, the achievement of a high energy efficiency, the effective use of water resources and the prevention of any environmental pollution.<br>
Moreover, the dye transfer technique, which makes use of a coloring composition containing a pigment, also suffers from drawbacks such that particles of the pigment and/or the polymer compound used as a binder are adhered to the surface of a transfer-controlling plate and this in turn results in the reduction of the amount of the composition adhered to the fibrous structure and the area thereof to be colored and that the pigment and/or the polymer compound adhered to the fibrous structure may reduce the aesthetic properties and flexibUity of the fibrous structure. For this reason, there has been desired for the development of a novel coloring composition.<br>
Patent Document 1 discloses a coloring agent for use in the dip dyeing technique, whose particle size is not more than 0.5 /i m, a colored article obtained using the composition and a coloring method which makes use of the same. However, the coloring dyestuff used in this coloring agent is a disperse dye and accordingly, this method does not improve or eliminate the problems of the appropriate selection of the material for a fibrous structure due to the use of a dye; the requirement for the use of complicated steps; the requirement for large quantities of energy and industrial water; the delivery of a large quantity of waste water.<br>
In addition, Patent Document 2 discloses an ink composition whose particulate materials as the components thereof have a particle size of not more than 10 jixa and a screen printing method which makes use of the ink, but this technique has not yet satisfactorily solved the problems concerning the impairment of the aesthetic properties and the flexibihty of the fibrous structure to be treated.<br>

Effects of the Invention<br>
The coloring composition and coloring method of the present invention make use of pigment particles, as a dyestuff for coloration, whose average particle size is not more than 200nm and polymer particles, as a binder, preferably having an average particle size of not more than 200nm and therefore, they can form a thin and uniform colored and coated layer on the surface of a fibrous structure \^dthout impairing the aesthetic properties of the fibrous structure; they can ensure a good color-developing ability and excellent fastness of color; they permit<br><br>
)<br><br>
the coloration of even a mixed material using a single coloring composition and by a single coloring step; they can further ensure a high working efficiency, a high energy efficiency and quite effective use of water resources and they are substantially free of any environmental pollution.<br>
It is considered that the following are the reasons why the coloring composition and coloring method of the present invention are excellent as compared with the conventional ones-<br>
The conventional fiber-coloring composition which makes use of a pigment undergoes adhesion to the fibrous structure, forms a thick color-developing coated layer since the particles of the pigment and a binder poljoner used therein have a large particle size. Accordingly, it has not provided any clear color-development and, in turn, any colored fibrous structure having good aesthetic properties.<br>
On the other hand, the coloring composition and coloring method of the present invention make use of a pigment and a polymer binder, which have been finely pulverized to a specific particle size. Accordingly, they can form a thinner colored, coated layer, while the aesthetic properties of the resulting colored fibrous structure can be maintained or even improved, the generation of voids in the coated layer can be hmited to a lowest possible level, the resulting article has an improved fastness of color and they also ensure a clear color-development.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Various modes for carrying out the present invention will hereunder be described in more detail.<br>
In the present invention, the term "fibrous structure" means yarns or threads, cloths, woven goods, knitted goods, nonwoven fabrics, paper, plates, leather and other sheet-like products, as well as articles prepared from these products, which are made of natural fibers, synthetic fibers, semi-synthetic fibers or mixture thereof.<br>
The coloring composition of the present invention is characterized in that it<br><br>
uses a pigment whose average particle size is not more than 200nm as a dyestuff component for coloration and the composition is preferably characterized in that it comprises polymer particles having an average particle size of not more than 200nm as a binder component.<br>
As the dyestuff component for coloration used in the coloring composition of the present invention, usable herein include aU of the inorganic and organic pigments which can be dispersed in water and an aqueous solvent and have chromatic colors. Moreover, it is also possible to use pseudo-pigments obtained by pigmenting resin emulsions with dyes or the like.<br>
Such inorganic pigments may be, for instance, metal powder and powdery metal-containing compounds, while such organic pigments may be, for instance, azo lake pigments, insoluble azo pigments, chelate azo pigments, phthalocyanine pigments, perylene and perinone pigments, anthraquinone pigments, quinacridone pigments, dye lake pigments, nitro pigments, and nitroso pigments.<br>
More specifically, examples of pigments usable herein include inorganic pigments, for instance, carbon black such as channel black, furnace black and thermal black, titanium black, iron black, lead black, copper-chromium black, cobalt black, red iron oxide, chromium oxide, cobalt blue, yellow iron oxide, viridian, cadmium yellow, vermihon, cadmium red, lead yellow, molybdate orange, zinc chromate, strontium chromate, ultramarine blue, barite powder, iron blue, manganese violet, aluminum powder, and brass powder; and organic pigments such as aniline black, perylene black, cyanine black, pseudo-pigments obtained by pigmenting resin emulsions with black dyes, C.I.

CI. Pigment Yellow 55, C.I. Pigment Yellow 74, C.I. Pigment YeUow 83, C.I. Pigment YeUow 95, C.I. Pigment Yellow 166, CI. Pigment Yellow 167, CI. Pigment Orange 5, CI. Pigment Orange 13, CI. Pigment Orange 16, CI. Pigment Violet 1, CL Pigment Violet 3, CI. Pigment Violet 19, CI. Pigment Violet 23, CI. Pigment Violet 50, and CL Pigment Green 7, In the present invention, the foregoing pigments may be used alone or in any combination of at least two of<br>
them.<br>
The average particle size of the pigment particles present in the coloring composition of the present invention is not more than 200nm and preferably not more than lOOnm. This is because if the coloring composition contains pigment particles whose average particle size exceeds 200nm, the surface roughness of the resulting colored fibrous structure increases and this accordingly leads to the increase of the frictional resistance and the corresponding reduction of the fastness to rubbing. On the other hand, if the coloring composition contains pigment particles whose average particle size is less than lOnm, the resulting coloring composition is Hable to cause the reduction of, for instance, the color density developed and the weatherabihty. Therefore, the average particle size of the pigment particles used in the present invention preferably ranges from 10 to 200nm and more preferably 20 to lOOnm.<br>
As the means for controUing the average particle size of the pigment particles, usable herein includes, for instance, a method comprising the steps of adding, to the foregoing pigment, water and an aqueous solvent and optionally a wetting agent, a moisturizing agent, a dispersion stabilizer or the Like and then blending them using a shear force-applying tj^e dispersion device currently used in this field. For instance, the foregoing mixture is processed using, for instance, a stirring type dissolver, a homomixer, a Henschel mixer, a medium-type ball mill, a sand mill, an attritor, a paint-shaker, a medium-less type three-roll or five-roU mill, a jet mill, a water-jet mill or an ultrasonic dispersion device for a predetermined period of time to thus give pigment particles having an intended<br><br>
average particle size.<br>
In addition, desired pigment particles having a predetermined average particle size can more certainly be prepared when by pulverizing and dispersing the pigment in a dispersion device and then optionally removing coarse particles and extremely fine particles present in the resvdting pigment particles. The pigment particles other than those having a desired particle size may be removed by, for instance, the static settling technique, the centrifiigal sedimentation technique, or the removal through filtration.<br>
The pigment particles used in the present invention are quite fine and accordingly, they may again undergo agglomeration due to any external factor or upon the coloring process to thus impair the desire quality of the coloring composition. To prevent such re-agglomeration of the pigment particles, it is preferred to subject the surface of the pigment particles to a hydrophihzation treatment in advance.<br>
Examples of such hydrophilization treatments are those comprising the step of imparting, to the surface of pigment particles, hydrophihc groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and/or amino group through the treatment of the pigment particles with a dispersing agent containing a surfactant and/or a water-soluble polymer to thus improve the stability of the particles. Examples of such surfactants usable herein are anionic ones such as alkyl carboxyhc acid esters, alkyl-sulfuric acid esters and alkyl-phosphoric acid esters; cationic ones such as aliphatic ammonium salts; and nonionic ones such as alkyl ethers, fatty acid ester ethers and sorbitan fatty acid esters. In addition, examples of the foregoing water-soluble polymers usable herein include polymeric dispersing agents such as poljrvinyl pyrrohdone, polyvinyl alcohols, acrylics (such as low molecular weight polyacrylic acids and polyCmethacryhc acids)), poly(maleic adds), copolymers of styrene with acryhc acid, methacryhc acid or the hke, poly amides and rosin-modified maleic acids.<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible to hydrophilize the surface of pigment<br><br>
particles using a treatment with an alkali such as sodium hydroxide, a treatment with an oxidizing agent such as chromic acid, or a topochemical treatment such as the low temperature plasma treatment.<br>
Among the hydrophihc groups which can he imparted to the surface of the pigment particles, hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are particularly preferred since they may cause a cross-hnking reaction with hinder polymer molecules and a crosslinking agent during the coloration of a fibrous structure and this may in Uxm result in the effect of improving the fastness of the color.<br>
The content of the pigment particles in the coloring composition of the present invention preferably ranges from 0.1 to 15% by mass and more preferably 0.5 to 10% by mass based on the total mass of the coloring composition. This is because if the content thereof is less than 0.1% by mass, there is observed such a tendency that the resulting composition does not show any satisfactory color development, while if it exceeds 15% by mass, the resulting coloring composition has such a tendency that the fastness thereof to rubbing is reduced.<br>
The binder polymer used in the present invention should be one capable of being dispersed in water and an aqueous solvent in the form of fine particles preferably having an average particle size of not more than 200nm and more preferably not more than lOOnm. On the other hand, if the coloring composition contains a binder polymer whose average particle size exceeds 200nm, there may be observed the following tendency- the thickness of the coated layer formed by the binder polymer increases and this in turn leads to the deterioration of the aesthetic properties of the fibrous structure colored by the composition and the ability of the binder polymer to bind the pigment particles is reduced and this accordingly results in the reduction of the fastness thereof to rubbing. On the other hand, if binder polymer particles having an average particle size of less than lOnm are present in the coloring composition, there may be such a tendency that the liquid coloring composition becomes unstable due to the agglomeration of such fine particles. For this reason, the average particle size of the binder particles<br><br>
used in the present invention preferably ranges from 10 to 200nm and more preferably 20 to lOOnm. In particular, it is quite preferred to use the binder polymer particles, whose average particle size is controlled in such a manner that it falls within the range of from 10 to lOOnm, since the use thereof permits the formation of a micro-coat as a coated layer formed from the binder polymer, while maintaining the aesthetic properties of the fibrous structure and the use likewise permits the improvement of the abihty of the binder polymer to bind the pigment<br>
particles.<br>
The binder polymer used in the present invention desirably has a glass transition temperature of preferably not higher than 10°C and more preferably not higher than 5°C. If the glass transition temperature of the binder polymer exceeds 10°C, the binder polymer insufficiently forms a coated film when the coloring method of the present invention is appHed to a fibrous structure in such a working environment maintained at room temperature (20'C± 10°C) and a large number of voids are formed in the resulting film. There is observed such a tendency that these voids remains in the film even after the heat-treatment thereof and this accordingly reduces the strength of the coated layer made of the binder polymer. On the other hand, if the glass transition temperature of the binder polymer is less than 10°C, the binder polymer can form a uniform film even at room temperature to thus prevent any reduction of the strength of the resulting film. The binder polymer used in the present invention is not restricted to any specific one inasmuch as it may satisfy the foregoing reqviirements and examples thereof include easily available and commonly used ones such as acrylic polymers, acryhc monomer-styrene copolymer, acryhc monomer-urethame copolymers, acryHc monomer-maleic acid copolymers, acryhc monomer-butadiene copolymers, acryhc monomer-vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, polyurethanes and poly olefins.<br>
The binder polymer used in the present invention may be in the form of, for instance, an emulsion or a dispersion.<br><br>
The content of the binder poljrmer particles in the coloring composition of the present invention preferably ranges from 0.5 to 20% by mass and more preferably 1 to 10% by mass based on the total mass of the coloring composition. This is because if the content thereof is less than 0.5% by mass, there is observed such a tendency that the binder polymer does not show its abihty as a binder and the resulting composition shows a reduced fastness to rubbing, whUe if it exceeds 20% by mass, the resulting coloring composition has such a tendency that the aesthetic properties of the fibrous structure processed with the composition are impaired.<br>
The coloring composition of the present invention can be used for the coloration of a variety of articles. Examples of such articles are fibrous structures such as yarns or threads, cloths, woven goods, knitted goods, nonwoven fabrics, paper, plates, and leather. The coloring methods particularly preferably used for coloring fibrous structures include, for instance, the dye transfer technique and the dip dyeing technique.<br>
When coloring a fibrous structure according to the dye transfer technique, the coloring composition used in the technique should have such a viscosity that the transfer-controUing plate can normally show its function. For instance, in case where a silk screen printing plate is used, the viscosity of the composition should be controlled to such a level that the composition does not cause any leakage through the mesh of the screen used.<br>
For instance, when using a silk screen printing plate having a large pore size on the order of 60 mesh, filaments each having a diameter of 83 M m are usually used, the screen has a rate of opening of 65% and a pore size of 340 jx m and accordingly, the composition should have a viscosity at which the coloring agent does not permeate into the screen even at a penetration volume of 55 cm^/m^.<br>
The coloring composition of the present invention comprises pigment particles and binder polymer particles, having a quite small particle size and<br><br>
therefore, the viscosity thereof should be controlled to a level of not less than 5,000mPa"S and preferably not less than 20,000mPa'S. However, if the viscosity thereof is too high on the order of higher than 200,000mPa'S, the meshes of the screen printing plate are plugged with the coloring composition and accordingly, the coloration of a fibrous structure is liable to be insufficient. For this reason, when using a silk screen printing plate having a large pore size on the order of 60 mesh, the coloring composition used should have a viscosity preferably ranging from 5,000 to 200,000mPa-s and more preferably 20,000 to 100,000mPa-s.<br>
On the other hand, when using a silk screen printing plate having a small pore size on the order of 120 mesh, filaments each having a diameter ranging from 48 to 83 M m are usually used, the screen has a rate of opening of 49% and a pore size of 152 /i m and accordingly, the composition used should have a viscosity at which the coloring composition does not permeate into the screen even at a penetration volume of 39 cm^/m^ and which also permits the appropriate passage of the composition through the screen mesh when appljdng a pressure with a squeegee. To prevent the permeation of any coloring composition through the screen, the viscosity of the composition is desirably controlled to a level of not less than 3,000mPa'S and preferably not less than 15,000mPa'S. However, if the viscosity thereof exceeds 150,000mPa-s, when pressurizing the screen with a squeegee, the meshes of the screen printing plate are plugged with the coloring composition and accordingly, the coloration of a fibrous structure is liable to be insufficient, because of the extremely high viscosity of the composition. Accordingly, when using a silk screen printing plate having a small pore size on the order of 120 mesh, the coloring composition used should have a viscosity preferably ranging from 3,000 to 150,000mPa-s and more preferably 15,000 to 80,000mPa-s.<br>
When using a silk screen printing plate having a pore size of 230 mesh for the purpose of accomplishing the high quahty and high precision dye transfer coloration, filaments each having a diameter ranging from 48 to 67 M m are<br><br>
usually used, the screen has a rate of opening of 28% and a pore size o£ 65 iixn and accordingly, the coloring composition used should have a viscosity at which the composition does not permeate into the screen even at a penetration volume of 22 cm^/m^ and which also permits the appropriate passage of the composition through the screen mesh when applying a pressure with a squeegee. To prevent the permeation of any coloring composition through the screen, the viscosity of the composition is desirably controlled to a level of not less than l,000mPa-s and preferably not less than 2,000mPa-s. However, if the viscosity thereof exceeds 120,OOOmPa'S, when pressurizing the screen with a squeegee, the meshes of the screen printing plate are plugged with the coloring composition and accordingly, the coloration of a fibrous structure is Hable to be insufficient, because of the extremely high viscosity of the composition. Accordingly, when using a silk screen printing plate having a finer pore size on the order of 230 mesh, the coloring composition used should have a viscosity preferably ranging from 1,000 to 120,000mPa-s and more preferably 2,000 to 70,000mPa'S.<br>
When coloring, in this way, fibrous structures using the coloring composition of the present invention according to the dye transfer technique, the viscosity of the coloring composition should be adjusted while taking into consideration the mesh size, pore size and penetration volume of the silk screen printing plate. Thus, high quality and high precision pictorial symbols, dabbed patterns and/or gradated patterns can be colored at high resolution.<br>
The squeegee used in the coloring method according to the present invention should be one which can apply a desired pressure to the coloring composition present on the silk screen printing plate, can satisfactorily make the composition pass through the openings of the screen printing plate and can appropriately scratch off the unnecessary coloring composition from the silk screen and accordingly, the squeegee should have appropriate elastic characteristics. If the squeegee has a Shore hardness of not more than 35 degrees, the resulting squeegee is insufficient in its strength and it may immediately be<br><br>
worn out, while if the Shore hardness thereof is higher than 91 degrees, the resulting squeegee has insufficient elastic characteristics and accordingly, the squeegee does not serve to appropriately scratch off, from the silk screen, the unnecessary coloring composition. For this reason, the hardness of the squeegee used in the coloring method of the present invention more preferably ranges from 40 to 80 degrees and the squeegee would have highly satisfied physical properties and excellent durabihty inasmuch as the hardness thereof falls within the range specified above. The usual elastic molded articles and resins commercially available can be used as the material for forming such a squeegee without any restriction insofar as they satisfy the foregoing requirement for the physical properties or the Shore hardness specified above. Specific examples thereof are acrylic rubber, acryhc urethane rubber, acryhc nitrile rubber, acrylic butadiene rubber (acryhc acid or methacryhc acid-butadiene rubber), urethane rubber, butadiene rubber, butyl rubber, NBR (acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber), epoxy elastomers and fluororubber.<br>
Various kinds of thickening agents can be used for controlling the viscosity of the coloring composition according to the present invention. Such a thickening agent may be, for instance, at least one member selected from the group consisting of synthetic polymers, cellulose materials and polysaccharides and terpene emulsions, which naay be used alone or in any combination of at least two of them.<br>
Specific examples of the foregoing synthetic poljnners are polyacryhc acids, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene oxide, polyAdnyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl methyl ether, and polyacrylamide. Specific examples of cellulose materials are ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, and carboxymethyl cellulose. Specific examples of the foregoing polysaccharides are xanthane gum, guar gum, casein, gum arabic, gelatin, carrageenan, alginic acid, tragacanth gum, locust bean gum, and pectin. Specific examples of the foregoing terpene emulsions include mousse-like emulsions each obtained by emulsifying a mixture of mineral<br><br>
terpene and water with a nonionic surfactant.<br>
In case where a fibrous structure is colored using the coloring composition of the present invention according to the dip dyeing technique, the viscosity of the coloring composition should be controlled so that the fibrous structure is wetted with the coloring composition to thus stably adhere the pigment and the binder poljnner to the fibrous structure. In particular, if the viscosity of the composition is too low and when the pigment as the dyesttxff for the coloration is in the fine particulate state, the pigment adhered to the fibrous structure may migrate from the course area to the dense portion of the structure due to the capillary phenomenon thereof when drjong the structure provided thereon with the coloring composition adhered thereto and this in turn leads to the formation of color spots and any uniformly colored product cannot be obtained at all. For this reason, the viscosity of the composition is preferably adjusted to a level of not less than lOmPa-s. However, when the viscosity of the coloring composition exceeds lOOOmPa-s, the composition would hardly penetrates into the fibrous structure. Therefore, when coloring the fibrous structure according to the dip dyeing technique, the coloring composition of the present invention preferably has a viscosity ranging from 10 to lOOOmPa-s, and more preferably 20 to 500mPa-s.<br>
The use of the coloring composition whose viscosity is adjusted to a level falling within the range specified above permits the formation of a satisfactorily colored fibrous structure according to the dip dyeing technique.<br>
When coloring a fibrous structure with the coloring composition of the present invention according to the dip dyeing technique, the aesthetic properties and color-developing ability of the structure may variously vary depending on the amount of the coloring composition adhered thereto. Accordingly, the rate of pickup of the coloring composition (the adhered amount (by mass) of the composition (prior to drjdng) based on the amount (lOO parts by mass) of the fibrous structure) preferably ranges from 50 to 91% and more preferably 60 to 80%. If the rate of pickup is less than 50%, the adhered amount of the composition<br><br>
is too low to give a colored product having a satisfactory hue corresponding to the sufficient coloration, while if it exceeds 91%, the adhered amoxmt of the composition is too high and this accordingly leads to the formation of a colored fibrous structure provided with an extremely thick coated layer and having impaired aesthetic properties. Thus, the use of the coloring composition of the present invention whose rate of pickup is adjusted to a level specified above permits the formation of a colored fibrous structure excellent in the color-developing ability, the aesthetic properties and the fastness of color.<br>
In the fibrous structures colored using the coloring composition of the present invention according to the dip dyeing technique and the dye transfer technique, the pigment as the coloring dyestxiff is held on the surface of the fibers preferably by the action of the polymer biader and accordingly, the method of the invention does not require the use of any additional step for removing, for instance, any excess coloring agent, any sizing agent and any additive through washing with water after the coloration with the coloring composition and the subsequent drying operation. Moreover, the coloring method of the present invention using the coloring composition of the present invention does not require the selection of any appropriate dye suitably used for each particular fibrous material and the control of heating, pressurizing and stirring conditions for properly making the dye penetrate into the fibrous structure. Accordingly, the coloring method of the present invention permits the coloration of even a mixed material using a single coloring composition and a single step for coloration and accordingly, it can be said that the coloring method of the present invention is an excellent coloring method since it is excellent in the working efficiency and the energy efficiency, and it permits the effective use of the water resources and it is free of any environmental pollution.<br>
The coloring composition of the present invention uses, as the solvent, water (for instance, tap water, distilled water, purified water, deionized water, pure water and deep sea water). In addition to water, however, it is also preferred<br><br>
to use an aqueous medium other than water having a polar group which makes the medium compatible with water, which can impart water retention characteristics to the resulting composition and improve the stabihty of the pigment and the binder polymer. Examples of such aqueous mediums are methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, glycerin, and pyrrohdone. In addition to these aqueous mediums, usable herein also include, for instance, non-aqueous solvents such as hquid paraffin, mineral oils and industrial gasoline, insofar as they can be blended with water or dispersed therein through the use of, for instance, an emulsifying agent. These solvents may be used alone or in any combination.<br>
The content of water in the coloring composition of the present invention preferably ranges from 10 to 90% by mass and more preferably 30 to 80% by mass.<br>
When the binder polymer is used alone in the coloring composition of the present invention, the resulting film may sometimes be insufficient in the strength and fastness thereof. In this case, the fastness of the resulting film can be improved by the incorporation, into the coloring composition, of a crossHnking agent which can undergo a crosshnking reaction with, for instance, hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups present in the pigment and the binder polymer.<br>
In this respect, the following crossHnking reactions can be used- the dehydration condensation reaction of methylol groups with hydroxyl groups; the epoxy ring-opening polymerization reaction of glycidyl groups with hydroxyl groups; the urethane-forming reaction of isocyanate groups with hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups; the amide ester-forming reaction of oxazoHne groups with carboxyl group; the carbamoylamide-forming and isourea-forming reaction of carbodiimide groups with hydroxyl and carboxyl groups; the condensation dehydration reaction of silanol groups with hydroxyl groups; the dehydration condensation reaction of metal alkoxide groups with hydroxyl groups; the melamine-condensation reaction of polj^unctional methylol groups with hydroxyl<br><br>
groups; and the reduction dehydration reaction of diacetone acryiamide with hydrazide and hydroxyl groups. When incorporating these aqueous crosshnking agents into the coloring composition and then heating the restdting mixture, the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of the pigment and/or the binder polymer undergo a crosshnking reaction with the crosshnking agents to form a three-dimensional network and as a result, the fastness of the resulting film may substantially be improved.<br>
The content of the crosshnking agent in the coloring composition of the present invention preferably ranges from 0.1 to 5% by mass and more preferably 0.2 to 2.5% by mass.<br>
The coloring composition of the present invention may further comprise, in addition to the foregoiug components, other optional additives commonly or widely used in the coloring composition in an amount which does not adversely affect the intended effects of the present invention, for instance, an antiseptic agent, an antifungal agent, a sequestering agent, a pH-adjusting agent, a lubricant, and/or a wetting agent.<br>
Examples of such antiseptic and antifungal agents include phenols, sodium<br>
omadine,	sodium	pentachlorophenol,	l,2-benzisothiazohn-3-one,<br>
2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-4-(methyl-sulfonyl) pyridine, sodium benzoate, alkah metal salts of benzoic acid, sorbitan fatty acid and dehydro-acetic acid, and benzimidazole type compounds.<br>
Examples of such sequestering agent are benzotriazole, dicyclohexyl ammonium nitrite, di-isopropyl ammonium nitrite, tolyl triazole, and saponins.<br>
Examples of the foregoing pH-adjusting agent include urea, aqueous ammonia, monoethanolamine, triethanolamine, aminomethyl propanol, alkah metal salts of phosphoric acid such as sodium tripolyphosphoate and alkah metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide.<br>
Examples of the foregoing lubricants and wetting agents are polyalkylene glycol derivatives such as polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, alkah metal salts of fatty<br><br>
acids, silicone oil emulsions, polyether-modified silicones such as polyethylene glycol adducts of dimethylene polysiloxane, poly(tetrafluoroethylene) powder, fluorochemical surfactants, fluorine-modified oils and acetylene glycol.<br>
