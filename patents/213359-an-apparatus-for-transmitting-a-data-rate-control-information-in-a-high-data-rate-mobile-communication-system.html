				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR GATING TRANSMISSION OF A<br>
DATA RATE CONTROL CHANNEL IN AN HDR MOBILE<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for transmitting a data rate control (DRC) channel in a mobile communication system employing a high data rate (HDR) technique, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for gating or repeating transmission of a DRC channel.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In an IS-2000 communication system, in a good channel state, a base station and a mobile station perform power control in order to perform communication at a prescribed data rate. On the other hand, in an HDR mobile communication system, access terminals (corresponding to the mobile stations in the IS-2000 system) transmit DRC to an access network (corresponding to the base station in the IS-2000 system) at intervals of a predetermined number of slots, and the access network then analyzes the DRCs received from the access terminals and selectively transmits data only to the access terminals in a good channel state after controlling a data rate. The HDR system has a forward link with highly increased throughput, so that it transmits a large amount of data per unit time in a good channel state and transmits a small amount of data per unit time in a bad channel state, by varying a length of a packet using a single common data channel within the limit of the maximum power of the access network. That is, the HDR system transmits data to only one of the access terminals within a concerned access network at a certain time, through a common data channel. The HDR mobile communication system transmits channel state information and data rate control (DRC) information using a DRC channel. Regarding the DRC, the access terminal measures a carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I) of a pilot signal transmitted over a forward link, creates the DRC based on the measured C/I, and then reports the created DRC to the access network over the DRC channel.<br>
The pilot signal is used for initial sync acquisition of data transmitted<br>
from the access terminal to the access network, for channel recovery, and for indicating reverse power control information. Meanwhile, a reverse data rate indicator (RRI), used in the HDR system, is a signal for indicating a data rate of a reverse link and synchronizing (or time-aligning) frames each comprised of 16 slots. The DRC and the pilot signal are transmitted on a time division multiplexing (TDM) basis. Further, the RRI signal provides an index inserted in a punctured part of an encoded packet of the pilot signal, so as to help the access network to determine a data rate. Table 1 below shows reverse data rate indexes according to reverse data rates.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
(Table 1 Removed)<br>
In Table 1, when the reverse link is transmitted at a data rate of 153.6Kbsp, a 3-bit symbol is transmitted to the access network over a data rate index channel through Walsh symbol repetition using an orthogonal code of length 4. Table 2 below shows an encoding table of the DRC channel.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
(Table 2 Removed)<br>
The access terminal measures a C/I of a signal transmitted from the access network, converts the measured C/I into a codeword associated with the data rate required by the access network in accordance with Table 2, and then reports the results to the access network. As shown in Table 2, the DRC signal is comprised of a 4-bit symbol. The 4-bit symbol is converted into an 8-bit codeword by block coding. The codewords are mapped with the required data rates of the forward traffic channel on a one-to-one basis.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a structure of a reverse link transmitter in a common HDR mobile communication system. Referring to FIG. 1, a multiplier 102 channel-spreads a pilot channel 101 by multiplying it by an orthogonal function W04 of length 4 at every slot, and outputs a 1024-chip non-modulated signal having a value '0'. RRI 103 is provided to an 8-ary orthogonal modulator 105. The 8-ary orthogonal modulator 105 performs 8-ary orthogonal modulation on the provided RRI and outputs a Walsh symbol. A Walsh symbol repeater 107 repeats the Walsh symbol output from the 8-ary orthogonal modulator 105, and provides its output to a multiplier 109. The multiplier 109 multiplies the Walsh symbol output from the Walsh symbol repeater 107 by an orthogonal function W04 of length 4 at every slot, and outputs 64 chips per slot. A (8,4,4) block encoder 117 block-encodes an input DRC 115. A codeword repeater 119 repeats the block-encoded DRC a predetermined number of times. A multiplier 121 spreads the symbols output from the codeword repeater 119 by multiplying them by an orthogonal function W02 of length 2. A Walsh cover generator 113 outputs an orthogonal function of length 8 corresponding to an input DRC Walsh cover index 111. A multiplier 123 multiplies an output of the multiplier 121 by an output of the Walsh cover generator 113. A multiplier 125 multiplies data output from the multiplier 123 by an orthogonal function W04 of length 4. A time division multiplexer (TDM) 127 time-multiplexes the pilot channel signal, the RRI channel signal and the DRC channel signal output respectively from the multipliers 102, 109 and 125, and provides its output to a complex spreader 141 as an in-phase component. An encoder 131 encodes an input traffic channel signal 129. A modulator 133 performs BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) modulation on the encoded traffic data. An interleaver 135 interleaves the BPSK-modulated data. A data channel gain controller 137 gain-controls the output of the interleaver 135. A multiplier 139 channel-spreads the signal output from the data channel gain controller 137 by multiplying it by an orthogonal function W24 of length 4, and provides its output to the complex spreader 141 as a quadrature<br>
phase component. The complex spreader 141 complex-spreads the in-phase component signal and the quadrature phase component signal. A baseband filter 143 baseband-filters the complex-spread signal from the complex spreader 141.<br>
As described above, the pilot channel signal, the RRI channel signal and the DRC channel signal are transmitted to the access network after time multiplexing.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a method for transmitting a DRC channel in a general HDR system. As illustrated, each frame is comprised of 16 slots each having a length of 2048 chips (=1.66msec). In each slot, the pilot channel signal and the DRC channel signal are time-multiplexed in a unit of 46 chips, before transmission. Every user (regardless of to which user group it belongs) continuously transmits the time-multiplexed signal of the pilot channel signal and the DRC channel signal. In this case, there occurs interference between the users.<br>
That is, as stated above, the HDR system continuously transmits the pilot and the DRC to the access network while the data service is connected. Meanwhile, for the high-speed data transmission, information on the C/I and the DRC signal, transmitted over the reverse link, must be correct. However, as shown in FIG. 2, since each user continuously reports the time-multiplexed signal of the pilot signal and the DRC to the access network, there occurs interference between the pilots. If the access network fails to correctly detect the DRC, the access network cannot correctly schedule the data rate and the sector required by the access terminal, so that it is not possible to service additional new users. That is, in the conventional HDR system, when the number of users is increased, it is difficult for the access network to detect the DRC correctly, making it impossible to service new users.<br>
Although FIG. 2 shows a case where the pilot channel signal and the DRC channel signal are subjected to time multiplexing, the same problem may occur even in the case where the pilot channel signal and the DRC channel signal are subjected to code division multiplexing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for gating transmission of a DRC channel to prevent interference<br>
between DRC channels in an HDR mobile communication system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for transmitting a DRC channel at transmission power lower than that of a pilot channel by repeating the DRC channel, in order to prevent interference between DRC channels in an HDR mobile communication system.<br>
It. is further another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for determining a slotting rate at which an access terminal gates transmission of a DRC channel by inverting a DRC information length in a mobile communication system, wherein an access network transmits the DRC information length indicating a frequency of repeating DRC information at a plurality of time slots, to the access terminal during call setup.<br>
To achieve the above and other objects, there is provided a communication method in a mobile communication system in which an access terminal transmits to an access network (DRC information) indicating a selected one of forward data rates requested by the access terminal. The access network designates a DRC information length (DRCLength) indicating a number of slots where the DRC information is repeated and transmits the designated DRC information length to the access terminal. The access terminal gates transmission of DRC information to the access terminal at one time slot in every DRC information length received from the access network.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
In the following description, the term "slotting rate (DRCSlotRate)" refers to a rate indicating at every how many slots the DRC channel is transmitted during gated transmission of the DRC channel. In addition, the term "user group" refers to a set of users that transmit the DRC channel to the access network in the same slotting period, and have the same DRC transmission start point within the frame. Here, not one but several users exist in each of the user groups.<br>
Further, the term "repetition frequency (DRCLength)" refers to the frequency of transmitting the same DRC channels, which indicates at every how<br><br>
many slots the same DRC channel is repeated during repeated transmission of the same DRC channel. The slotting rate (PJRCSlotRate) is defined as a reciprocal of the repetition frequency (DRCLength) according to the present invention.<br>
In addition, the term "continuous transmission mode" refers to a mode where the user continuously transmits the DRC channel at every slot, and the term "gated (or slotted) transmission mode" refers to a mode where the user periodically gates transmission of the DRC channel according to the slotting rate (or gating rate) designated by the access network. Further, the term "repeated transmission mode" refers to a mode where the user repeatedly transmits the same DRC channel according to the repetition frequency DRCLength designated by the access network. The present invention can switch from the continuous transmission mode to the gated transmission mode, from the continuous transmission mode to the repeated transmission mode and from the repeated transmission mode to the gated transmission mode, and vice versa.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates the timing for which an access terminal (AT) measures a C/I of a signal transmitted from an access network (AN) and transmits a DRC channel requiring a specific data rate to the access network, and the access network then applies the data rate required by the access terminal to transmission data based on the DRC channel received from the access terminal. In FIG. 3, the access network applies the required data rate through the DRC channel, a half slot after receiving the DRC channel from the access terminal. Therefore, the HDR system schedules the user DRCs to be transmitted a half slot before one encoder packet is ended, and provides a data service to the user in a good channel state at the next encoder packet at the maximum power.<br>
Now, a description will be made regarding a method for gating transmission of a DRC channel in order to reduce interference between user DRCs when a capacity of the reverse link is exceeded, according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a structure of a reverse link transmitter for fransmitting a DRC channel in an HDR mobile communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a multiplier 102 orthogonal-spreads pilot channel data 101 by multiplying it by a predetermined orthogonal code W04. A switch 401,<br>
under the control of a controller (not shown), switches the output of the multiplier 102 to a time division multiplexer (TDM) 127 or a 64-chip delay 403. The 64-chip delay 403 delays (or buffers) the output of the multiplier 102 for a predetermined time (e.g., 64-chip interval) and provides its output to the multiplexer 127.<br>
An 8-ary orthogonal modulator 105 performs 8-ary orthogonal modulation on an input reverse rate indicator (RRI) 103 and provides an output symbol. A Walsh symbol repeater 107 repeats the symbol output from the 8-ary orthogonal modulator 105 a predetermined number of times. A multiplier 109 orthogonal-spreads the output of the Walsh symbol repeater 107 by multiplying it by the Walsh code W04.<br>
A (8,4,4) block encoder 117 performs (8,4,4) block encoding on input 4-bit DRC information 115. A codeword repeater 119 repeats the codeword output from the (8,4,4) block encoder 117 a predetermined number of times. A multiplier 121 orthogonal-spreads the output of the codeword repeater 119 by multiplying it by a given Walsh code W02 of length 2. A Walsh cover generator 113 outputs a Walsh cover for sector division by receiving a DRC Walsh cover index. A multiplier 123 multiplies the output of the multiplier 121 by the output of the Walsh cover generator 113. A switch 405, under the control of the controller , gates the output of the multiplier 123. A multiplier 125 multiplies the output of the switch 405 by the Walsh code W04. The multiplexer 127 time-multiplexes the outputs of the multiplier 102 (or the delay 403), the multiplier 109 and the multiplier 125.<br>
An encoder 131 encodes input traffic data, and a modulator 133 BPSK-modulates the output of the encoder 131. An interleaver 135 interleaves the output of the modulator 133. A channel gain controller 137 gain-controls the output of the interleaver 135. A multiplier 139 multiplies the output of the channel gain controller 137 by a predetermined Walsh code W24 of length 4. A complex spreader 141 complex-spreads the output (I-channel signal) of the multiplexer 127 and the output (Q-channel signal) of the multiplier 139 by multiplying them by a predetermined PN (Pseudo Noise) code. A baseband filter 143 baseband-filters the output of the complex spreader 141. The filtered signal is converted into a radio frequency (RF) signal by frequency-up-conversion, and then transmitted to the access network.<br>
In the common HDR mobile communication system, the reverse link is such structured that each user should report the DRC to the access network at every slot. In the present invention, when the capacity of the reverse link is exceeded (or saturated), the access terminal gates transmission of the DRC to the access network. In order to gate transmission of the DRC to the access network, the access terminal must first know information about a slotting rate, a slotting (or gating) start point and a pilot offset. The information on the slotting rate, the slotting start point and the pilot offset is transmitted directly or indirectly from the access network to the access terminal through a signaling message. When the information is directly transmitted to the access terminal, the information related to the slotting rate, the slotting start point and the pilot offset, determined by the access network, is transmitted to the access terminal using the signaling message. When the information is indirectly transmitted to the access terminal, the access network transmits the slotting rate and a MAC (Media Access Control) index to the access terminal, and the access terminal then determines the slotting start point and the pilot offset using the information from the access network.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 4, each user transmits the DRC channel and the pilot channel based on the assigned slotting rate, the slotting start point and the pilot offset information. More specifically, in FIG. 4, the channel-spread pilot and the channel-spread DRC are provided to a pilot signal offset part and a DRC signal gating part, respectively. The DRC signal gating part can be comprised of the switch 405, as shown in FIG. 4. The pilot signal offset part can be comprised of the switch 401 and the 64-chip delay 403 for delaying the pilot signal for a predetermined chip interval, as shown in FIG. 4. The switch 401 and the switch 405, under the control of the controller, control a transmission start point of the pilot signal and gate transmission of the DRC channel according to the information on the slotting rate, the slotting start point and the pilot offset, received from the access network, thereby to minimize interference between the DRC channels.<br>
FIGs. 5 and 6 illustrate a method for continuously transmitting the pilot signal and gating transmission of the DRC channel according to an embodiment of the present invention. This method is divided into one method for transmitting the pilot signal with an offset and another method for transmitting the pilot signal with no offset. In the former case where the pilot signal has an offset, the users are grouped into a plurality of user groups and the DRC channels are gated such that they should be transmitted at different slots according to the user groups, as<br>
shown in FIG. 5. For example, a first user group UG_1 transmits the DRC channel at the first slot, and the second user group UG_2 transmits the DRC channel at the second slot. The DRC channels are transmitted at predetermined intervals determined according to the slotting rate. Since the user groups have different pilot signal transmission start points, the transmission power is uniformly distributed at the slot where the DRC channel is gated. When a specific user group is given a 64-chip pilot offset as shown in FIG. 5, it is possible to reduce interference between pilot signals from the users that transmit only the pilot signal but not the DRC channel.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a method for gating transmission of a DRC channel and continuously transmitting a pilot signal with no offset. In this case, when the second user transmits the DRC channel, there occurs no interference between the DRC channel and another user's DRC channel as in FIG. 5.<br>
Although FIGs. 5 and 6 show a case where the pilot signal and the DRC channel are subjected to time division multiplexing, the invention can also be applied to another case where the pilot signal and the DRC channel are subjected to code division multiplexing. That is, by gating transmission of the DRC channel, it is possible to reduce interference to the reverse link. When the pilot signal and the DRC channel are subjected to code division multiplexing, no offset is given to the continuous pilot signals.<br>
FIGs. 7 and 8 illustrate a method for gating transmission of the DRC channel at a slotting rate DRCSlotRate=l/4 according to an embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, FIG. 7 shows one case where an offset is given to the pilot signals according to the user groups, and FIG. 8 shows another case where no offset is given to the pilot signals. When the slotting rate is 1/4, the users are divided into 4 user groups. Each user is provided with the slotting rate 1/4 and the slotting start point through a signaling message transmitted from the access network.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the users in the first user group UG_1 are assigned the slotting rate 1/4 and the slotting start point (1st slot) through the signaling message. Similarly, the users in the second user group UG_2 are also assigned the slotting rate 1/4 and the slotting start point (2nd slot). In the same method, the users belonging to the third and fourth user groups UG_3 and UG_4 are also assigned the slotting rate 1/4 and the 3rd and 4th slots as their slotting start points.<br>
The users gate transmission of the DRC channels to the access network at the designated periods beginning at their slotting start points according to the assigned slotting rate and slotting start points. In FIG. 3 above, the DRC is applied after a half slot. Therefore, if an encoded packet is comprised of 4 slots as shown in FIG. 7, the DRC is applied only to the first user group UG_1. Specifically, regarding the DRC application point of each user received at the access network, the DRC transmitted a half slot before one encoder packet is ended is applied. Therefore, when the slotting rate is 1/4, only the first user group UG_1 transmits the DRC, a half slot before one encoder packet is ended. That is, the DRC applied to the data transmitted from the access network becomes the DRC transmitted by the first user group UG_1. Therefore, in order for the access network to schedule the DRC at every slot, it is preferable to determine a data rate of the forward link in consideration of the DRC of the user group applied at the corresponding slot and the latest DRC information of the previous user group during a period corresponding to the slotting rate before the corresponding slot.<br>
Although FIG. 7 shows a case where the pilot signal and the DRC channel are subjected to time division multiplexing, the gated transmission can also be equally applied to another case where the pilot signal and the DRC channel are subjected to code division multiplexing. By gating transmission of the DRC channel, it is possible to reduce interference to the reverse link.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a method for gating transmission of the DRC channels at a given slotting rate beginning at a given slotting start point according to the user groups and continuously transmitting the pilot signals with no offset, as described with reference to FIG. 7. When an offset is given to the pilot signal as shown in FIGs. 5 and 7, there occurs no interference with the pilot signals from the users in the other user groups. However, there exists interference with the users transmitting the DRC channels. When no offset is given to the pilot signal, the performance is the same as in the conventional HDR system except for the case where transmitting the DRC is gated. In this case, interference between the pilot signals may increase compared with the case where an offset is given to the pilot signals, but the interference may be reduced in an interval where the DRC is transmitted.<br>
Although FIG. 8 shows a case where the pilot signal and the DRC channel are subjected to time division multiplexing, the gated transmission can also be equally applied to another case where the pilot signal and the DRC<br>
channel are subjected to code division multiplexing. By gating transmission of the DRC channel, it is possible to reduce interference to the reverse link.<br>
In the gated DRC transmission method proposed by the present invention, when the capacity of the reverse link is exceeded (or saturated), each user gates transmission of the DRC channel, thereby to decrease interference between users and also decrease the capacity of the reverse link.<br>
In the conventional HDR system, each access terminal (AT) transmits the DRC at every slot, as mentioned above, and the capacity of the reverse link is restricted. Therefore, if the number of users for the reverse link exceeds the capacity, a new access terminal (AT) cannot receive data over the forward link. Therefore, the access terminal (AT) must increase the capacity of the reverse link by switching from the continuous DRC transmission mode to the gated (or slotted) DRC transmission mode.<br>
When the capacity of the reverse link exceeds a predetermined reference value, the access network (AN) must determine a ratio of a DRC power value to interference by the other access terminals (ATs). A threshold value for an error rate per frame of the DRC channel is defined as DRCSER and a signal-to-noise ratio corresponding to the threshold value DRCSER is defined as Eh/Ntn k .<br>
Further, reception power of the access network (AN) before despreading by each access terminal (AT) is defined as PUi(i= 1,...,N), the sum of received signal<br>
powers including noises before despreading by each access terminal (AT) is defined as I0, and DRC power at the receiver of a certain access terminal (AT) is defined as E ,.• . Therefore, in the process of detecting the DRC for the first<br>
user, the interference is represented by I0- /&gt;„_. Therefore, a ratio of the DRC reception power EI)I(C,.-, to a value determined by subtracting the signal power Pu from the interference I0, including the noises, of the other access terminals is<br>
represented by Equation (1) below. Equation (1) represents a ratio of DRC power to total interference of a certain user.<br>
A method for determining a value for switching from the continuous<br>
DRC transmission mode to the gated DRC transmission mode, i.e., a standard signal-to-noise ratio E^N,^^ of a DRC signal using Equation (1), is divided<br>
into two methods: a first method defines an average ratio of the DRC reception power of each user to interference with other users as EbjNl , and a second<br>
method defines the minimum ratio of the DRC reception power of each user to interference with other users as Eh/Nt<br>
FIGs. 9 and  10 illustrate a structure of a reverse link receiver for determining the value   Eb/Nt        so as to switch to the gated DRC transmission<br>
mode when the capacity of the reverse link exceeds a predetermined reference value according to an embodiment of the present invention. Since every user has the same receiver structure, only the structure of the first user's receiver will be described below with reference to FIGs. 9 and 10.<br>
The first method will be described with reference to FIG. 9. The access network receiver measures signal power  Pu
of the first access terminal ATI, using an I squarer 1001, a Q squarer 1003 and a summer 1005. In the same manner, the signal power PUv from the other users is<br>
measured through the associated I squarer and Q squarer. The measured signal power is provided to a summer 1007 which measures the I0 value by summing up the signal power from the all users. A subtracter 1023 subtracts the Pu from<br>
the I0 , thereby obtaining the value I0- PUt (interference) equivalent to a value<br>
determined by subtracting its signal power from the signal power of the [other] all users. The I squarer 1001, the Q squarer 1003, the summer 1005, the summer 1007 and the subtracter 1023 constitute a "power measurement part" for measuring interference between the access terminal and the other access terminals. In addition, the I and Q signals from the first user USER1 are provided to a complex despreader 1009 for complex despreading. A multiplier 1011 channel-despreads the complex-despread I signal by an orthogonal function [W4° ] W04of length 4, and a multiplier 1013 channel-despreads the complex-despread Q signal by an orthogonal function [W42 ] W^of length 4. The channel-despread I signal has the pilot signal, the DRC and the RRI. A DRC extractor 1015 extracts the DRC from the channel-despread I signal and provides the extracted DRC to a decoder 1019. The decoder 1019 decodes the DRC into the original DRC. A decoder 1017 decodes the channel-despread Q signal and outputs traffic data. A DRC measurer 1021 measures reception power EDRCI of<br>
the DRC provided from the decoder 1019. A DRC Ej/N, measurer 1025 calculates a DRC Eb/Nt for the first user USER1 by receiving the output value lo-P of the subtracter 1023 and the output value EDRC.t of the DRC measurer 1021.<br>
An average DRC Eb/Nt measurement part for measuring an average Eb/Nt (signal-to-noise ratio) of the DRC channels by receiving the signal-to-noise ratios of the DRC channels from all the users is comprised of a summer 1029 and a multiplier 1031 as shown in FIG. 9. The summer 1029 sums up Eb/Nt of the DRC channels from the respective users, and the multiplier 1031 divides the summed signal by the number N of the users and outputs an average Eb/Nt of the DRC channels. A controller 1035 compares the average Eb/Nt of the DRC channels, output from the multiplier 1031, with a predetermined reference value in order to determine whether to gate the DRC channel and also to determine a corresponding slotting rate.<br>
Next, the second method will be described below with reference to FIG. 10. The first method of FIG. 9 calculates the DRC Eb/Nt (or DRC reception power) by averaging DRC Eb/N, values of the respective users, whereas the average DRC Eb/Nt measurement part in the second method of FIG. 10 is comprised of a minimum value detector (MIN) 1101. The minimum value detector 1101 receives the DRC Eb/Nt values of the respective users and outputs the minimum DRC Eb/Nt value as E^N^^ . The controller 1035 then compares<br>
the minimum DRC Eb/N, output from the minimum value detector 1101 with the predetermined reference value to determine whether to gate the DRC channel and also to determine a corresponding slotting rate.<br>
That is, the   EhlN.        value calculated by the method of FIG. 9 or 10 is<br>
n I	'niiwuri-<br>
provided to the controller 1035. The controller 1035 performs an operation of a slotting rate determining algorithm of FIG. 11 by receiving the Eb/N,m^ value.<br>
FIG. 1 1 illustrates a procedure for determining a slotting rate of the DRC channel by measuring strength of a signal received from each user in the access network according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 11, the controller 1035 of the access network (AN) receives the standard signal-to-noise ratio Ef,/N, of the DRC channel, calculated in FIG. 9 or 10.<br>
Thereafter, in step 1101, the controller 1035 compares the standard signal-to-noise ratio   EJN,        of the DRC channel with  EJN.     + A . If EJN.       is<br>
" /	'wi-isuff	'	'Thrvsh	u I	ltneasvre<br>
larger  than   Eh /Nljh k + A ,  the   controller   1035   proceeds  to  step   1111,   and<br>
otherwise, proceeds to step 1103. In step 1103, the controller 1035 compares <br>
controller 1035 sets the slotting rate to 1/2 in step 1107. Otherwise, the controller 1035 proceeds to step 1105. In step 1105, the controller 1035 determines whether EJN. is larger than Eh/N, - $,. If EJN, is larger than EJN, -6,,<br>
the controller 1035 sets the slotting rate to 1/4 in step 1109. If the condition of step 1105 is not satisfied, the controller 1035 repeatedly performs the same process while changing the error margin A. Herein, since one frame is comprised of 16 slots, the slotting rate can be set up to 1/16. For example, regarding a unit of data transmitted from the access terminal to the access network, the data is transmitted in a unit of encoder packet comprised of 32 slots. Since the access network is frame-synchronized with the access terminal, the possible maximum slotting rate is 1/16, and the slotting start point can also become one of 16 positions.<br>
A, 82 and 53 indicate error margins. After determining the slotting rate through the above process, the controller 1035 determines in step 1111 the slotting rate, the slotting start point and the pilot offset for each access terminal using the reverse link data rate and slotting rate information received from the access terminal (AT). Further, the controller 1035 groups the DRCs of the reverse link according to the determined slotting rate. In step 1113, the controller 1035 creates a signaling message including the slotting rate, the slotting start point and the pilot offset, and transmits the created signaling message to the respective access terminals (ATs) . After transmitting the signaling message, the controller 1035 performs the above process again for the next slot in step 1115.<br>
The signaling message has the following format. For example, the signaling message is realized using a reserved field of the existing traffic channel assignment message. That is, it is possible either to realize a DRC slotting control message using the previously defined message or to define a new message. The traffic channel assignment message has a format shown in Table 3 below.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
(Table 3 Removed)<br>
In the conventional traffic channel assignment message format of Table 3, the slotted DRC transmission mode field DRCSlotMode, the slotting rate field DRCSlotRate, the DRC slotting start point field DRCStarting_Point and the pilot offset field Pilot_OFFset are added for the slotted DRC transmission. Each field will be described below in detail.<br>
DRCSlotMode field records whether to gate the reverse DRC channel.<br>
-	DRCSlotMode='0' indicates the continuous DRC transmission mode<br>
-	DRCSlotMode^' 1' indicates the slotted DRC transmission mode<br>
DRCSlotRate field records a slotting rate of the reverse DRC channel.<br>
-	DRCSlotRate='00' indicates a 1/2 slotting rate<br>
-	DRCSlotRate^'01' indicates a 1/4 slotting rate<br>
-	DRCSlotRate^' 10' indicates a 1/8 slotting rate<br>
-	DRCSlotRate=' 11' indicates a 1/16 slotting rate<br>
DRCStarting_Point field records a start slot where the DRC channel is first transmitted when the reverse DRC channel is subjected to slotted transmission.<br>
-	DRCStarting_Point='0000' indicates the 1st slot<br>
-	DRCStarting_Point='0001' indicates the 2nd slot<br>
-	DRCStarting Point='0010' indicates the 3rd slot<br>
- DRCStarting_Point='1110' indicates the 15th slot<br>
- DRCStarting_Point=' 1111' indicates the 16th slot<br>
Pilot_OFFset field records whether to apply an offset when transmitting the reverse pilot signal.<br>
-	Pilot_OFFset='0' indicates that no offset is applied.<br>
-	Pilot_OFFset=' 1' indicates that an offset is applied.<br>
Table 4 below shows the fields added for DRC slotting control in the existing channel assignment message. As shown in Table 4, it is also possible to transmit only the fields for DRC slotting control through the channel assignment message. That is, Table 4 shows a message format used when transmitting only the DRC slotting control message instead of retransmitting the channel assignment message. In Table 4, the MessagelD field is used to identify the DRC slotting control message.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
(Table 4 Removed)<br>
The signaling messages of Tables 3 and 4 transmit DRCSlotMode^'O' for the continuous DRC transmission mode, and DRCSlotMode=T to switch to the slotted DRC transmission mode. In order to provide a service to a new subscriber, the DRCSlotMode field is set to '1'.<br>
FIG. 12 illustrates a procedure for switching from the slotted DRC transmission mode of the reverse link to the continuous DRC transmission mode when the capacity of the reverse link is improved because of a decrease in the number of users, according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to  FIG.   12,  the  controller  1035  determines  in step   1201<br>
whether a condition of N.N,-+ A + S   is satisfied. If the condition is<br>
satisfied, the controller 1035 switches from the slotted DRC transmission mode<br>
to the continuous DRC transmission mode in step 1203. Here, "5," indicates a margin of the boundary value where switching occurs from the slotted DRC transmission mode to the continuous DRC transmission mode.<br>
After switching from the slotted DRC transmission mode to the continuous DRC transmission mode in step 1203, the controller 1035 informs the access terminal (AT) of the switching to the continuous DRC transmission mode through the channel assignment message of Table 3 or 4, in step 1205. However, if the condition is not satisfied in step 1201, the controller 1035 determines in<br>
satisfied. If the condition is satisfied, the controller 1035 switches to a slotting rate=l/2 DRC transmission mode in step 1209. However, if the condition is not satisfied in step 1207, the controller 1035 switches to a slotting rate=l/4 DRC transmission mode in step 1213. After the mode switching, the controller 1305 informs the access terminal of the switched transmission mode through the channel assignment message of Table 3 or 4 in step 1211. After steps 1205 and 1211, the controller 1035 performs the same process again for the next slot in step 1215. Meanwhile, upon receipt of the message of Table 3 or 4, the access terminal performs the procedure of FIG. 14.<br>
For a better understanding of the invention, the process for switching from the continuous transmission mode to the slotted transmission mode and from the slotted transmission mode to the continuous transmission mode will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 13.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates boundary values for switching from the continuous DRC transmission mode to the slotted DRC transmission mode due to a decrease in the capacity of the reverse link, or from the slotted DRC transmission mode to the continuous DRC transmission mode due to an improvement in the capacity of the reverse link.<br>
As illustrated, reference numeral 13-1 indicates variation of a DRC symbol error value according to Eh[N^ , and reference numeral 13-3 indicates<br>
a boundary of EhjN,:k ^  corresponding to a preferable symbol error rate DRCSER<br>
at the access network. Reference numeral 13-2 indicates a boundary where the slotting rate is changed from 1/4 to 1/2, and the DRC reception power corresponding to this boundary becomes Eb/Ntn^-52. For example, if the<br>
EJN.        value measured at the access network is larger than  EjN,     -5-, and<br>
smaller than Eb/NlM , the slotting rate is set to 1/2. However, if the measured Eh/Nlm^ value is smaller than Eb/Nln ^ - 6-,, the slotting rate is set to<br>
1/4. In this manner, it is possible to change the slotting rate according to the measured capacity of the reverse link.<br>
Further, reference numeral 13-4 indicates a boundary for switching from the continuous DRC transmission mode to the slotted DRC transmission mode if the capacity of the reverse link is exceeded. The signal-to-noise ratio (or reception power) of the DRC channel corresponding to this boundary becomes<br>
EbjNljt 4 + A . That is, if Eh/Nt ^    is smaller than  EbjNln 4 + A , switching from<br>
the continuous DRC transmission to the slotted DRC transmission mode takes place. In addition, reference numeral 13-5 indicates a boundary for switching back to the continuous DRC transmission mode if the capacity of the reverse link is less than a reference value in the slotted DRC transmission mode. The signal-to-noise ratio of the DRC channel corresponding to this boundary becomes Eb/N,n k +&amp; +^. In this case, if Eb/N,^^ is larger than Eb/Nt^ + A + £,,<br>
switching to the continuous DRC transmission mode takes place.<br>
As mentioned above, switching from the continuous DRC transmission mode to the slotted DRC transmission mode happens at the point where Eb INt is smaller than Eh[Nln A + A . Further, in the slotted DRC transmission<br>
mode, if Eh/N, is larger than Eb/N,n^ - £, but smaller than Eb/N,n^ + A , the slotting rate is set to 1/2; if Eh/Nt^^ is smaller than Eb/N,n^ - 52 + £, E. /N -5, the slotting rate is set to 1/4. Here, 52 indicates a margin for<br>
changing the slotting rate to 1/4.<br>
In addition, the point where switching takes place from the slotted DRC transmission mode back to the continuous DRC transmission mode because of an improvement in the capacity of the reverse link is as follows. In the case where EJN, has a margin 5, for increasing a data rate, if the number of the reverse<br>
link users is decreased improving the capacity of the reverse link while the user chooses the slotted transmission mode for the reverse link because  EjN.        is<br>
u I	'mtasurt<br>
measured to be smaller than Eh/N,rir „ + A + J, , switching takes place back to the continuous transmission mode. In this case, if E/,/^lmmn *s larger than<br>
h + A + 5\ , switching happens from the slotted DRC transmission mode to<br>
the continuous DRC transmission mode. Here, 8, indicates a margin of the boundary value where switching occurs from the slotted DRC transmission mode to the continuous DRC transmission mode.<br>
FIG. 14 illustrates a procedure for detecting a slotting rate of the DRC channel by analyzing a signaling message from the access network in the access terminal according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 14, upon receipt of a signaling message from the access network (AN) in step 1401, the access terminal (AT) detects, in step 1403, the slotted DRC transmission mode DRCSlotMode, the slotting start point DRCStarting_Point, the slotting rate DRCSlotRate and the pilot offset Pilot_OFFset from the received signaling message, or determines the slotting start point DRCStarting_Point and the pilot offset Pilot_OFFset using the slotted DRC transmission mode DRCSlotMode, the MAC index Maclndex and the slotting rate DRCSlotRate included in the channel assignment message. After detecting the above information, the access terminal (AT) further determines in step 1403 whether the DRC channel is subjected to the slotted transmission (DRCSlotMode=l), based on the slotted transmission mode information DRCSlotMode detected from the channel assignment message. If DRCSlotMode=l, the access terminal (AT) gates transmission of the DRC channel according to the detected slotting start point and slotting rate in step 1405. Thereafter, the access terminal (AT) determines in step 1407 whether to transmit the pilot signal with an offset (Pilot_OFFset=l), based on the pilot offset information Pilot_OFFset included in the channel assignment message. If the pilot signal has an offset (i.e., Pilot_OFFset=l), the access terminal (AT) transmits the pilot signal with an offset as shown in FIGs. 5 and 7, in step 1409. If DRCSlotMode*! in step 1403, or if PilotJDFFsefctl in step 1407 or after transmitting the pilot signal with an offset in step 1409, then the access terminal (AT) prepares to control the next slot in step 1411.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention, the reverse DRC channel is gated (or slotted) in order to improve DRC detection capability of the access network. As another method for reducing reverse interference due to the DRC channel, the HDR system transmits the same DRC channels over at least 2 consecutive slots at transmission power lower than that of the pilot channel. Hereinafter, a case where transmission output of the DRC channel is low will be<br>
described in detail.<br>
FIG. 15 illustrates a method for repeatedly transmitting the same DRC channels in the HDR mobile communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, the number of repeated slots is 4. Therefore, the access terminal (AT) transmits the same DRC channels over 4 slots according to the number of repeated slots, specified by the access network. At this moment, the DRC channel is transmitted at transmission power lower than that of the pilot signal. That is, the same DRC channels are transmitted over the 4 consecutive slots at 25% of the transmission power of the pilot channel, thereby reducing interference due to the DRC channel transmitted by the access terminals in the reverse link. The access network acquires one DRC channel having the same power as that of the reverse pilot channel by accumulating the DRC channels received at the 4 slots. That is, the acquired DRC channel has enough power required for demodulation.<br>
Although FIG. 15 shows a case where the same DRC channels are transmitted at the 4 consecutive slots, the same method can also be applied to another case where the same DRC channels are transmitted at a predetermined number of consecutive slots. For example, the number of repeated slots can be 1, 2 or 4, as shown in Table 5 below. In addition, information on the number of consecutive slots where the same DRC information is transmitted and information on the transmission power for the DRC information are transmitted from the access network to the access terminal through the signaling message. Alternatively, the access network transmits information on the number of repeated slots, and the access terminal then determines the transmission power for the DRC information using the information received from the access network.<br>
For example, if the repetition frequency of the same DRC channels is 4, the transmission power for each DRC channel is set to 25% of the transmission power of the pilot channel as shown in Table 5.<br>
Table 5<br><br>
(Table 5 Removed)<br>
The method for transmitting the same DRC channels at 2 or more consecutive slots at reduced transmission power can also be applied to the slotted DRC transmission mode described in the embodiment of the present invention. In this case, one or more of the same DRC channels are slotted, and transmission power for the non-slotted DRC channels is set to be equal to or lower than the transmission power for the pilot channel.<br>
FIG. 16 illustrates a method for slotting at least one of the same DRC channels in the HDR mobile communication system which repeatedly transmits the same DRC channels according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, the number of repeated slots is 4. Therefore, the access terminal (AT) transmits the same DRC channels for a 4-slot interval. In this case, the access terminal slots the DRC channels at the even-numbered slots (i.e., 2nd and 4th slots), and transmits only the pilot channels at the odd-numbered slots. Further, the transmission power for the DRC channels transmitted at the odd-numbered slots (i.e., 1st and 3rd slots) is adjusted to be lower than the transmission power for the pilot channels. For example, the transmission power for the DRC channels is adjusted to 50% of the transmission power for the pilot channels. That is, the DRC channels of two slots out of the 4 consecutive slots transmitting the same DRC channels are slotted, and the DRC channels of the other two slots are transmitted at the transmission power lower than that of the pilot channels.<br>
That is, in another embodiment of the present invention, when the capacity of the reverse link is exceeded, the access terminal transmits the same DRC channels at two or more consecutive slots at transmission power lower than that of the pilot channel. In order to repeatedly transmit the DRC channels to the access network, the access terminal should first know the number of slots where the same DRC channels are repeated, and the transmission power for the DRC channels. Information on the number of slots where the same DRC channels are repeated and information on the transmission power for the DRC channels are transmitted from the access network to the access terminal through the signaling message. Alternatively, the access network transmits information on the number of DRC-repeated slots, and the access terminal then determines the transmission power for the DRC channels using the information provided from the access network.<br>
FIG. 17 illustrates a structure of a reverse link transmitter according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, FIG. 17 illustrates an apparatus for decreasing transmission power of the DRC channels below the transmission power of the pilot channels, when transmitting the same DRC channels at two or more consecutive slots.<br>
As illustrated, the transmitter of FIG. 17 is similar in structure to the transmitter of FIG. 1, except for the structure of the DRC channel transmitter. Therefore, reference will be made only to the DRC channel transmitter in the following description.<br>
A (8,4,4) block encoder 117 performs (8,4,4) block encoding on 4-bit DRC information. In this embodiment, the (8,4,4) block encoder 117 repeatedly encodes the same 4-bit DRC information a predetermined number of times under the control of the controller. A codeword repeater 119 repeats a codeword output from the (8,4,4) block encoder 117 a predetermined number of times. A multiplier 121 orthogonal-spreads the output of the codeword repeater 119 by multiplying it by a given Walsh code W02 of length 2. A Walsh cover generator 113 outputs a Walsh cover by receiving a DRC Walsh cover index. A multiplier 123 multiplies the output of the multiplier 121 by the output of the Walsh cover generator 113. A DRC gain controller 1700 gain-controls the output of the multiplier 123. For example, when the same DRC channels are repeated 4 times in a 4-slot interval, the DRC gain controller 1700 adjusts the transmission power for the DRC channels to 25% of the transmission power for the pilot channel. A multiplier 125 multiplies the output of the DRC gain controller 1700 by a predetermined orthogonal code W04, and outputs a DRC channel signal. In order to switch from the repeated transmission mode to the slotted transmission mode, i.e., in order to support a transmission method of FIG. 21 which will be described later, a gating device (switch 405 of FIG. 4) can be provided between the DRC gain controller 1700 and the multiplier 125. Upon receipt of an order to switch from the current repeated transmission mode to the slotted transmission mode from the access network, the access terminal slots at least one of the repeated DRC channels by controlling the gating device. Further, the access terminal also readjusts a gain of the DRC channel signal using the DRC gain controller 1700. That is, the access terminal adjusts the gain of the DRC channel signals, so that the transmission power determined by accumulating the same DRC channel signals at the access network should be equal to the transmission power of the pilot channel.<br><br>
As described above, each user transmits the DRC channels and the pilot signals based on the information on the number of DRC-repeated slots and the information on the transmission power for the DRC channels, that is, the information being provided from the access network. The channel-spread DRC channel signal is provided to the DRC gain controller 1700. The DRC gain controller 1700 controls transmission power of the DRC channels based on the DRC information transmission power determined depending upon the number of slots where the same DRC information is repeated. By controlling the transmission power of the DRC channels in this manner, it is possible to reduce interference between the DRC channels from the users.<br>
Even in the method for transmitting the same DRC channels at two or more consecutive slots at transmission power lower than that of the pilot channel, it is possible to reduce interference between pilot signals using the pilot offset in the reverse link. In this case, whether to set the pilot offset can be directly informed to the access terminal using a predetermined field of the signaling message, or can be indirectly determined at the access terminal using the MAC index assigned by the access network. For example, the pilot offset is set according to whether the MAC index is an even number or an odd number.<br>
FIG. 18 illustrates a procedure for switching from the existing continuous DRC transmission mode to a transmission mode for transmitting the same DRC channels over at least 2 consecutive slots at transmission power lower than that of the pilot channel, when a value calculated by the access network by measuring a signal transmitted from each user exceeds a capacity of the reverse link according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 18, the access network (AN) compares the value EJN measured in FIG. 9 or 10 with EJN. +A in step 1801. If<br>
EJN,       is larger than   EhjN,n ^ + A , the access network proceeds to step 1811, and otherwise, proceeds to step 1803. The access network compares   Eb/Nt^^ with   £A//\ ^-52  in step 1803. If Eh/Nlmmn   is larger than   Eb/N,^-8,, the<br>
access network determines to repeatedly transmit the reverse DRC channels two times at 50% transmission power of the pilot channel in step 1807, and then proceeds to step 1811. Otherwise, the access network proceeds to step 1805. The access network compares Eh/Nl with Eb/Nt^^-53 in step 1805. If<br>
Eh/N,         is   larger  than   £A/'V,rt h-$i,   ™e   access   network   determines   to<br><br>
repeatedly transmit the DRC channels four times at 25% transmission power of the pilot channel in step 1809, and then proceeds to step 1811. That is, if the repetition frequency of the same DRC is N, the transmission power of the DRC channels becomes 1/N times the transmission power of the pilot channel. Here, A, 5, and 53 indicate error margins. After determining the repetition frequency of the DRC channel and the transmission power in this manner, the access network assigns a decoder according to the determined repetition frequency of the DRC channel and the determined transmission power in step 1811. Thereafter, in step 1813, the access network transmits to the access terminal (AT) the signaling message including the determined DRC repetition frequency and transmission power information. Subsequently, the access network collects the received DRC channels according to the repetition frequency and then determines reception power of the DRC channels in step 1815.<br>
In FIGs. 15 to 18, the DRC repetition frequency and the DRC transmission power are determined after measurement of interference to the reverse link. Alternatively, however, it is also possible to reduce interference to the reverse link by decreasing transmission power of the DRC channels below the transmission power of the pilot channel, if the same DRC channels are transmitted at the consecutive slots before application of the above method. That is, when the DRC repetition frequency DRCLength is 2 or 4, it is possible to reduce interference to the reverse link by decreasing the transmission power of the DRC channels below the transmission power of the pilot channel. For example, before application of the method for transmitting the same DRC channels over at least 2 consecutive slots at decreased DRC transmission power, if the same DRC channels have been previously transmitted in an N-consecutive slot interval, it is possible to reduce interference to the reverse link by decreasing the transmission power of the DRC channels to 1/N times the transmission power of the pilot channel. In other words, when the DRC channels are repeatedly transmitted at the same transmission power as that of the pilot channel, the transmission power of the DRC channels can be adjusted to be lower than that of the pilot channel through the signaling message during transmission. In addition, during repeated DRC transmission, the access network can also send a slotted transmission order to the access terminal through the signaling message. For example, if the reverse interference increases to exceed a threshold value during the repeated DRC transmission, the access network may order the access terminal to slot transmission of the DRC channels. In this case, the access terminal determines the slotting rate DRCSlotRate by inverting the repetition frequency<br>
DRCLength of the DRC channel assigned by the access network during call setup. A method for controlling the slotted DRC transmission using the DRC repetition frequency DRCLength will be described below.<br>
FIG. 19 illustrates a procedure for informing the access terminal of a slotting rate through the signaling message in the access network according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 19, the access network determines the DRC repetition frequency DRCLength and also determines the slotting rate DRCSlotRate by inverting the DRC repetition frequency DRCLength in step 1901. The slotting rate DRCSlotRate is equal to a reciprocal of the DRC repetition frequency DRCLength. Table 6 below shows the slotting rates DRCSlotRate associated with the repetition frequencies DRCLength indicating the number of the slots where the same DRC information is repeatedly transmitted.<br>
Table 6<br><br>
(Table 6 Removed)<br>
Thereafter, in step 1903, the access network creates a signaling message including the MAC index (Maclndex), the slotted transmission mode DRCSlotMode (continuous transmission mode or slotted transmission mode) and the slotting rate DRCSlotRate (or DRCLength) of the respective access terminals. In step 1905, the access network transmits the created signaling message to the access terminal.<br>
FIG. 20 illustrates a procedure for determining the slotting rate and the slotting start point for slotted transmission of the reverse DRC channels using the information included in the received signaling message in the access terminal. The signaling message including the MAC index Maclndex and the DRC repetition frequency DRCLength is transmitted to the access terminal during an initial access to the system. While repeatedly transmitting the DRC channels according to the DRC repetition frequency included in the signaling message, upon receipt of a slotted transmission order from the access network, the access terminal performs slotted DRC transmission according to the slotting rate DRCSlotRate determined by inverting the DRC repetition frequency DRCLength.<br>
Referring to FIG. 20, the access terminal receives the signaling message including the MAC index Maclndex and the DRC repetition frequency DRCLength from the access network in step 2001. When receiving the DRC repetition frequency DRCLength, the access terminal determines the slotting rate DRCSlotRate by inverting the DRC repetition frequency DRCLength. However, when the slotting rate DRCSlotRate is received, the access terminal determines the DRC. repetition frequency DRCLength by inverting the slotting rate DRCSlotRate. That is, the access network is required to provide the access terminal with any one of the slotting rate DRCSlotRate and the DRC repetition frequency DRCLength. Thereafter, in step 2003, the access terminal calculates a slotting period using the determined slotting rate DRCSlotRate. The slotting period is a reciprocal of the slotting rate DRCSlotRate. Therefore, the DRC repetition frequency has the same value as the slotting period. In step 2005, the access terminal calculates an index value which is equivalent to a remainder obtained by dividing the assigned MAC index (or DRC cover index) by the slotting period. The access terminal determines in step 2007 whether the determined index value is '0'. If the index value is '0', the access terminal determines the slotting start point DRCStarting_Point of the DRC channels undergoing the slotted transmission as a starting slot of one frame in step 2009. Otherwise, the access terminal determines in step 2011 whether the index value is T. If the index, value is T, the access terminal determines the slotting start point DRCStarting_Point of the DRC channels undergoing the slotted transmission as a second slot of one frame in step 2013. After repeating such a process, the access terminal determines in step 2015 whether the index value is 'N-2'. If the index value is 'N-2', the access terminal determines the slotting start point DRCStarting_Point of the DRC channels undergoing the slotted transmission as an (N-l)th slot of one frame in step 2019. Otherwise, the access terminal determines the slotting start point as an Nth slot of one frame in step 2017. For example, when the slotting rate is 1/4 (DRCSlotRate=l/4), the slotting period becomes 4 (=l/DRCSlotRate), and when the access terminal is assigned an MAC index of 27, it starts to transmit the DRC channels, after a lapse of 3 slots from the starting point of one frame.<br>
In FIGs. 19 and 20, the slotted transmission mode is applied to the case where the same DRC channels are repeatedly transmitted at two or more consecutive slots. However, even in the continuous DRC transmission mode, the access network determines the slotting rate by measuring interference of the<br>
reverse link through the processes of FIGs. 9 and 10 and provides the determined slotting rate information to the access terminal, and the access terminal then calculates the starting slot of one frame for the slotted DRC transmission by performing the steps 2001 to 2019 of FIG. 20.<br>
Although FIG. 20 shows how the access terminal determines the starting slot of the DRC channel within one frame, it is also possible to determine whether to set a pilot offset using the same method. In this case, an offset is set up to the pilot according to whether a remainder obtained by dividing the MAC index ass'igned to the access terminal by the slotting period is an odd number or an even number. Besides, it is also possible to decide whether to set up the pilot offset according to whether the remainder obtained by dividing the MAC index assigned to the access terminal by the slotting period is larger than a threshold value. For example, for the slotting rate DRCSlotRate=l/4, if the remainder is smaller than 2, the pilot offset is set up. Otherwise, if the remainder is larger than or equal to 2, the pilot offset is not set up.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to an embodiment where the access terminal determines the DRC slotting start point DRCStarting_Point and whether to set up the pilot offset Pilot_OFFset using the DRC slotting rate DRCSlotRate and the MAC index Maclndex, it is also possible for the access network to determine the DRC slotting rate and the MAC index and transmit them to the access terminal using the signaling message. In this case, the access network measures power levels of the interference signals generated by the respective user groups out of received reverse signals, determines the DRC transmission start point such that the DRC slotting start point DRCStarting_Point and the MAC index Maclndex should belong to the user group generating the least interference power, and transmits this information to the access terminal through the signaling message. In this case, whether to set up an offset to the pilot channel can be determined according to the DRC slotting start point DRCStarting_Point or the user group to which the access terminal belongs. In addition to the method where the access network determines the DRC transmission start slot DRCStarting_Point and the pilot offset Pilot__OFFset and transmits them to the access terminal, the access network may also calculate the number of users in the received user groups and then transmit the DRC transmission start slot and the pilot offset of the user group having the least number of users to the access terminal.<br>
FIG. 21 illustrates a DRC information application start point in the transmission method in which the DRCLength=4 slotted transmission mode is applied according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this case, the DRC information is applied to the forward link, a half slot after the DRC information of every user group is received at the access network. That is, the access network applies the DRC information to the forward link after receiving the DRC information belonging to every user group, transmitted in the same slotting interval (4 slots). Although FIG. 21 shows a case where the access network applies the DRC information to the forward link after receiving the DRC information of every user group, transmitted in the same slotting interval (4 slots), the access network may also determine the data rate of the forward link using the last received DRC information of the respective user groups before receiving the DRC information of every user group, transmitted in the same slotting interval (4 slots).<br>
Although FIGs. 21 illustrate an application of the slotted transmission mode for the case where the same DRC information is repeated 4 times (DRCLength=4), the slotted transmission mode can also be applied even when the same DRC information is repeated N times. When the repetition frequency is DRCLength=N, the slotting rate becomes DRCSlotRate=l/N and the access network applies the DRC information to the forward link after receiving the entire DRC information transmitted in the same slotting interval (N slots). Even in this case, it is possible to reduce interference to the reverse link by applying the pilot offset in the same method.<br>
FIG. 22 illustrates a DRC information application start point in the transmission method to which a DRCLength=2 slotted transmission mode according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this case, the DRC information is applied to the forward link, a half slot after the DRC information of every user group is received at the access network. That is, the access network applies the DRC information to the forward link after receiving the DRC information belonging to every user group, transmitted in the same slotting interval (2 slots). Although FIG. 22 shows a case where the access network applies the DRC information to the forward link after receiving the DRC information of every user group, transmitted in the same slotting interval (2 slots), the access network may also determine the data rate of the forward link using the last received DRC information of the respective user groups before receiving the DRC information of every user group, transmitted in the same slotting interval (2<br>
slots).<br>
FIG. 23 illustrates a method in which the access network receiver applies the DRC information to the forward link at a given point in the slotting interval before receiving the DRC information of every user group corresponding to the same slotting interval (4 slots) according to an embodiment of the present invention. When the DRC channels are subjected to the slotted transmission, the access network may receive the DRC information or may not receive the DRC information at a certain time point. For the non-received DRC information of the user group, the access network determines the data rate of the forward link using the last received DRC information. In this state, the access network has received only the DRC information from the first and second user groups UG1 and UG2 in the access terminal's DRC slotting interval n+1, but has not received the DRC information from the third and fourth user groups UG3 and UG4 in the slotting interval n+1. In this case, the access network determines the data rate of the forward link using the last received DRC information, i.e., the DRC information in the slotting interval n. That is, the access network selects the access terminal expected to receive the forward data by comparing the DRC information from the user groups UG3 and UG4, received in the nth interval, with the DRC information from the user groups UG1 and UG2, received in the (n+l)th interval, and then transmits the data to the selected access terminal at the determined data rate.<br>
Although FIG. 23 shows a case where the access network fails to receive the DRC information from the third and fourth user groups UG3 and UG4, the invention can also be equally applied to the case where the access network fails to receive the DRC information from other user groups. In addition, the invention can also be applied to the case where the number of user groups is not 4.<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to an embodiment where the pilot signals and the DRC channels are subjected to the time division multiplexing, the invention can also be applied to the case where the pilot signals and the DRC channels are subjected to the code division multiplexing.<br>
FIG. 24 illustrates an example of the slotted transmission mode for the case where the pilot signal and the DRC channel are subjected to code division multiplexing according to an embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, FIG. 24 illustrates a transmission method to which the DRCSlotRate=l/4 slotted transmission mode where the same DRC information is repeated 4 times<br>
(DRCLength-4). In this case, since the pilot signal and the DRC channel are subjected to code division multiplexing, it is not necessary to allocate an offset to the pilot signal. Therefore, when the slotted transmission mode is applied, the access terminal continuously transmits the DRC channels without time division multiplexing with the pilot channels, using all of the 2048 chips at the slot assigned to the access terminal itself. Slotting which one of the four slots having the same information is determined using the signaling message transmitted from the access network.<br>

First, with regard to the traffic channel transmitter, an encoder 2701 encodes forward traffic channel data. For example, a convolutional encoder or a turbo encoder having a code rate R=l/3 or 1/5 is typically used for the encoder<br>
2701.	A scrambling code generator 2702 generates  a scrambling code for<br>

outputs of the traffic channel transmitter, the preamble transmitter, the MAC channel transmitter and the pilot channel transmitter according to a predetermined rule. A quadrature spreader 2723 complex-spreads the output of the time division multiplexer 2729 by multiplying it by a given PN code.

A summer 2728 sums up the outputs of the modulators 2726 and 2727, and forwards the modulated signal to the access terminal through an antenna.<br>
FIG. 27 illustrates a procedure for determining the access terminal for receiving the forward channel and the data rate, described with reference to FIG. 28. Referring to FIG. 27, the access network receives the DRC channel transmitted from the access terminal in step 2901, and detects DRC information by demodulating the received DRC channel in step 2903. The access network decides whether to immediately apply the received DRC information to the forward channel in step 2904. If the access network determined to immediately apply the received DRC information to the forward channel, the access network determines the access terminal for receiving the forward channel and the data rate using the received DRC information in step 2907. Otherwise, the access network stores the detected DRC information to use it when making a decision related to the forward channel later, in step 2905. After determining the access terminal for receiving the forward channel and the data rate, the access network transmits data to the determined access terminal at the determined data rate in step 2909.<br>
For a better understanding of the invention, reference will be made separately to a transmission operation and a reception operation of the access terminal.<br>
The access terminal determines a forward data rate by measuring strength of the forward pilot channel, creates DRC information including the determined data rate and then transmits the created DRC information to the access network. Based on the DRC repetition frequency DRCLength (=1, 2 or 4) and the slotted DRC transmission mode DRCSlotMode (=enabled or disabled) previously specified by the access network, the access terminal transmits new DRC information at every slot (DRCLength=l); creates DRC information at every two slots and transmits the created DRC information at one of the 2 slots<br>
(DRCLength=2); or creates the DRC information at every 4 slots and transmits the created DRC information at one of the 4 slots (DRCLength=4). That is, for DRCLength—1, the access terminal newly measures the reception power of the pilot channel at every slot, determines the forward data rate, and then transmits the corresponding DRC information to the access network; for DRCLength=2, the access terminal newly measures the reception power of the pilot channel at every 2 slots, determines the forward data rate, and then transmits the corresponding DRC information to the access network; and for DRCLength^, the access terminal newly measures the reception power of the pilot channel at every 4 slots, determines the forward data rate, and then transmits the corresponding DRC information to the access network.<br>
After transmitting the DRC information to the access network, the access terminal must repeatedly determine for a predetermined time period whether the access network transmits forward data at the data rate specified in the transmitted DRC information. The predetermined time period is variable depending on how long the access network will use the received DRC information when selecting the access terminal to which the forward data is to be transmitted. If the access network has previously informed the access terminal of the time interval where it uses the DRC information in selecting the forward data rate and the access terminal, using the signaling message, the access terminal is not required to determine whether the forward data corresponding to the transmitted DRC information is received, at every slot until before transmission of the next DRC information. That is, since the access terminal knows how long the access network efficiently uses the transmitted DRC information, the access terminal can stop receiving the forward data using the signaling information from the access network. If the access network has not informed the access terminal of the time interval where it uses the DRC information, the access terminal must check the forward data channel at every slot until generating the next DRC information after reporting the DRC information to the access network.<br>
FIG. 28 illustrates the valid time intervals where the access terminal receives the forward traffic channel in response to the transmitted DRC information. In the first case, the valid time interval becomes one slot after the DRC information is transmitted. Therefore, the access terminal determines whether the forward traffic data is received, only for one-slot period after transmitting the DRC information, and stops the receiving operation if it fails to receive the forward traffic in this period. After transmitting the DRC information<br>
in the next DRC transmission period, the access terminal repeats the following process.<br>
FIG. 29 illustrates a procedure for transmitting the DRC information and detecting forward traffic in the access terminal according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 29, the access terminal measures reception power of the forward pilot channel in step 3001. Thereafter, the access terminal determines a forward data rate based on the measured reception power of the pilot channel in step 3003 and creates DRC information corresponding to the determined data rate in step 3005. Subsequently, the access terminal transmits the created DRC information to the access network over the reverse DRC channel in step 3007. After transmitting the DRC information, the access terminal determines in step 3009 whether forward traffic data is received from the access network. If the forward traffic data is received at the requested data rate, the access terminal receives the forward traffic data in step 3015. However, upon failure to receive the forward traffic data, the access terminal determines in step 3011 whether the valid interval of the DRC information has expired. If the valid interval of the DRC information has not expired in the access network, the access terminal returns to step 3009 to determine whether the forward data is received at the next slot. However, if the valid DRC information interval has expired in the access network, the access terminal determines in step 3013 whether the time elapsed after transmission of the DRC information is longer than the DRC transmission period DRCLength. In this process, the access terminal can either repeat or stop reception of the forward channel. If the time elapsed is longer than the transmission period, the access terminal returns to step 3001, to measure the reception power of the forward pilot channel again and then perform the succeeding steps. It is assumed herein that the access network reports the valid DRC information interval to the access terminal through the signaling message. If the valid interval information is not provided to the access terminal, the step 3011 must be canceled.<br>
To sum up, in the slotted DRC transmission mode and the repeated DRC transmission mode, when the capacity of the reverse link is saturated due to DRC interference between the users, the access terminals gate transmission of the DRC channels at predetermined periods, or repeatedly transmits the same DRC channels at the reduced transmission power, thereby contributing to a reduction in interference between users and an increase in capacity of the reverse link.<br><br>
As described above, the slotted DRC transmission method and the repeated DRC transmission method according to the present invention can resolve the capacity reduction problem of the reverse link, which may happen in the HDR system. In the invention, if the capacity of the reverse link is saturated, the access terminal switches to the slotted DRC transmission mode or the repeated DRC transmission mode. The slotted DRC transmission mode can contribute to a reduction in interference between the users and an increase in capacity of the reverse link, and the repeated DRC transmission mode can also contribute to a reduction in interference due to the DRC channels in the reverse link, thus increasing the capacity of the reverse link.<br>
In the above-stated embodiments, the access terminal measures forward channel environment(pilot channel) and on the basis of which, reversly transmitting the maximum forward DRC information which the access terminal may receive is disclosed. However, the access terminal may transmit the receipt signal measurement value of forward pilot signal, that is, pilot signal C/I. The invention can also be applied to another case where the access terminal transmit pilot signal C/I. In this case, the access terminal transmits the value measuring receipt strength of forward pilot signal according to information which can analogize a C/I update period (corresponding to DRCJLength) or other slot rate instructed from the controller.<br>
