				<td>NAME<br>
The title of this invention given by me ,to the best of my knowledge , is absolutely meaning ful.. By the help of this process ,a medicine will come out which is completely new .The action of medicine is safe , harmless,&amp; positive .No other previous invention ,in this aspect ,is so unique than this one . This invention can open another dimension of iron overloading treatment.Before this ,the iron chelation process was painfull ,harmfull,dissatisfying ,costly and timetaking .Now that iron chelation will be done only by 2 minutes per day harmlessly ,painlessly and most important affordably .All this includes in the same medicine come out through this process .That is why a newer dimension is meaningful and accurate.<br><br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the<br>
preparation of an iron chelating tablet for the treatment of existing higher percentage of serrum ferritine in circulating blood.<br>
The accumulation of excessive quantities of iron in the body ultimately originates from increased absorption or from parenteral administration as transfusions or as pharmacologic iron complexes. The capacity of Reticulo- endothylial system to gather the extra iron within its protective confines is immense, but ultimately the degree of transferrin saturation rises, its synthesis is inhibited and the plasma iron concentration approaches 200 ng/100ml. Now parenchymal cells are no longer protected from pathologic iron uptake &amp; damage occurs in various organs like liver, heart, pancreas, pituitary &amp; etc.<br>
The main site of iron storage under normal conditions is the liver and it is here most of the iron is found in iron storage diseases.<br>
Unfortunately the Thalassaemics have got a iron overload with two of the most important complications - heart failure and endocrine deficiencies. The latter are due to iron deposition in pituitary.<br>
Iron is principally deposited in the sites where it is found in<br>
haemochromatosis - the heart,Iiver,endocrine glands and etc and thus destroy its normal function and structure.<br>
Ferritin is a compound consisting of iron and the protein<br>
apoferritin. Rings of ferritin granules in the mitochondria surrounding the nucleus are a characteristic feature of sideroblastic anemia and similar granules lie diffusely in cytoplasm in Thalassamia,<br>
To chelate the iron, only one positive chemical had been found known as desferrioxmine. It is introduced in 1963. This is derived from streptomyces pilosus.But the disadvantages of using the above said chemical are as follow:<br>
1. It is highly expensive.<br>
2. It takes a lot of time to administer<br>
3. The equipments needed for the service is costly.<br>
4. It is painful.<br>
5. Pregnants can'tuse it.( Thalassaemia News letter Dec'93).<br>
6. Unavailability of the set up in rural areas,<br>
7. All the process needs expert help.<br>
8. Some patients have problems with light adaptation and vision.<br>
9. This process in not completely guranted, and often upsetting.<br>
Some oral iron chelation medicines are now in the market, but high price and harmfull side effects of those are nearly not satisfying to all.<br>
Thus the object of the present invention is to provide iron chetation medicine, which is not only effective against above said hazards but also useful to anybody, anytime, suffering from any disease resulting an iron overload.<br><br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for preparation of iron chelation tablet which comprises<br>
1) Ferroso -ferric phosphate<br>
2) Sodium Chloride<br>
3) Extract of Peruvian Bark.<br>
The process is as follows :<br>
PHASE-I<br>
Ten parts of pure crystallized Ferrous Sulphate dissolved is sixty parts of cold distilled water, is to be added a cold solution of thirteen parts of crystalized sodium phosphate in fifty of distilled water. The resulting precipitate is to be thrown on a filter and well washed with cold distilled water.Then spread upon an unglazed tile or upon bibulous paper and dried without aid of artificial heat. The dried mass is to rubbed to a fine powder .<br>
One part by weight of the above said substance is mixed with 9 parts by weight of sugar of milk . The one part by weight of this mixture is mixed with 9 parts by weight of sugar of milk. And then one part by weight of last produced substance is mixed with 9 parts by weight of sugar of milk and kept alone for next phase IV.<br>
PHASE-I1<br>
One part by weight of pure Chloride of sodium is dissolved in 9 parts by weights of distilled water for 30 minutes at a temperature of 28°F. And it is kept in a sealed phial for phase IV .<br>
PHASE-III<br>
Dried bark of puruvian tree is coarsely powdered and weighed .Tben five parts by weight of alcohol are poured over it and having put the mixture into a well stopped bottle . It is allowed to remain 8 days in a dark,cool place , shaking it twice a day. Then it is poured off and filtered . Then it is kept for phase V .<br>
PHASE IV<br>
The substance of phase I is mixed with the substance of phase II by a electric mixture at a ratio of 7:1 at a temperature in between (18 to 36 ) °F for six minutes .<br>
PHASE V<br>
The substance of phase IV is mixed with the substance of phase III at a ratio of 9:1 at a temperature within (18 to 36 ) °F for four minutes by simple mixing in a place devoid of direct sunlight &amp; strong odour .<br><br><br>
PHASE VI<br>
The end substance of phase V is dried , powdered and tabletted for easy acceptability .<br>
This	has been repeatedly tested for its effectiveness against iron loading .It has<br>
been found that out of 6 patience suffering iron overloading (all the patients are suffering from E-B Thalassaemia), this product is extremely effective in all cases. Then in another 5 patients of different age, sex and environment suffering form higher percentage of serum fourteen levels in circulating blood and the results are most satisfying.<br>
Then proved advantage of this	are as follows:<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
l.Very good control or serum ferritin level can be obtain with this composition.<br>
Example : S.P a female of 8 years of age has got an iron level of 407ng/ml in 30-O4-2002.After having this product, her iron level lowers to 82 ng/ml only in 19-12-2002.<br>
2.	The active ingredients are equally absorbed when administered orally with<br>
maximum blood levels occurring 12-30 hours after administration. Within (3-4) days<br>
after the administration iron level decreases significantly in majority of cases. Then<br>
within a very short period, it is most effective in reducing the iron level.<br>
Example: S.P.a male 8years old E-B Thalassaemia patient had a serum ferritin level of5996ng/ml in 14th August2002.The test has been conducted by a reputed investigation center. After medication by this product it lowers to 306ng/ml in 17lh January 2003.<br>
3. This iron chelating composition replace injections entirely in patients who had<br>
been receiving as much as (5-10) units of desferrioxamine per month for the whole life.<br>
4. This is very chip and inexpensive in comparison to the existing iron chelation<br>
medicines<br>
5. This is not painful.<br>
6. It takes only 2 minutes of time per day. The medicine tastes sweet for easy<br>
assimilation<br>
7.1t need no liquid to take this product.<br>
8. It does not hamper the social life by any means.<br>
9. It has got no noticeable side effects till date.<br>
9. <br><br>
10. Anybody can use it anytime if he/she needs iron chelation. It needs no expert help.<br>
Thus the process of manufacturing this provides life to millions of sufferers, who have already deposited higher percentage of iron level in the body at affordable cost. Besides it can be used anywhere, anytime and by anybody suffering from any disease which causes elevation of iron level in the body.<br><br>
