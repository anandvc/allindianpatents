				<td>A holding clip for fixing the position of getters in containers of random diameter in<br>
closed vacuum systems and container for the insertion in enclosed vacuum<br>
system, especially collector tubes<br>
It is known to use getters for the entire serivce life of enclosed vacuum systems.<br>
e.g. electron tubes, lamps or even vacuum tube collectors, in order to maintain a<br>
minimum pressure which is usually below 10-3 rnbar. These concern materials<br>
which are capable of binding considerable quantities of gas by absorption or by<br>
chemical conversion and are used for maintaining or improving the vacuum in<br>
enclosed systems. Known are evaporative getters volume getters or layer getters.<br>
Barium is usually used for so-called evaporative getters as are used in electron<br>
tubes. The delivery of such evaporative getters occurs in so-called containers.<br>
These are metal rings which are open on one side, into which a barium-aluminum<br>
alloy is pressed. They are also known as getter rings. In enclosed systems these<br>
rings are then inductively ignited, so that the barium will deposit on the walls of the<br>
container, and especially a glass container, and will chemically bind the possibly<br>
released gases. For this purpose it is known to provide the getter rings with a<br>
welded wire bracket which is then fastened in the system, and especially in the<br>
glass container, in a suitable fashion. In addition to the welding of the wire on the<br>
ring it is also necessary to make precautions for a suitable fastening. This causes<br>
an increased production effort. The welded wire bracket further leads to a more<br>
difficult handling of the rings due to the likelihood of interlocking, especially during<br>
transport and storage.<br>
Getter holding devices are known in a large variety of embodiments. Reference is<br>
hereby made in a subsidiary fashion to the printed publications<br>
a)	DE32 17 868A1<br>
b)	DE32 17 869A1.<br><br>
The printed publication DE 32 17 868 A1 describes a getter apparatus with a<br>
holding device and with supporting devices which rest against the wall of an<br>
electron tube, especially a television tube. A metal strip acts as a supporting<br>
device which is connected integrally or entirely with the getter apparatus and is<br>
bent in a U-shaped fashion. It tapers off at each end in a rounded supporting foot<br>
The individual getter apparatus is characterized oby a concrete geometric design to<br>
which the design of the holding device and the supporting devices is adjusted in<br>
order to ensure a connection with the getter apparatus. In the pre-mounted state<br>
there is increased difficulty in handling due to the geometry and there is a<br>
likelihood of interlocking, especially during transport and storage.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of developing an apparatus for<br>
fastening and fixing the position of getters, especially getter rings, which in<br>
addition to a simple fixing of the position and fastening of the getter in the<br>
container, and especially glass containers, for forming a vacuum system is<br>
characterized by ease of mounting and handling. Moreover, the effort in<br>
construction and production for such a holding and fixing device is to be kept as<br>
low as possible.<br>
The solution in accordance with the invention is characterized by the features of<br>
claim 1. Advantageous embodiments are described in the sub-claims.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a holding clip is provided for fixing the position of<br>
components carrying getters in containers of any desired geometrical cross<br>
section for vacuum systems, which clip is provided with a partial section<br>
supporting the component carrying the getter and a partial section for support in<br>
the housing, which is also known as supporting part The supporting part and the<br>
partial section supporting the component carrying the getter are mutually<br>
connected in a flexurally rigid fashion. Means are provided on the partial section<br>
supporting the component carrying the getter which allow a non-positive<br>
connection with the component carrying the getter. The non-positive connection is<br><br>
produced by bracing, especially clamping between the partial section supporting<br>
the component carrying the getter and the component carrying the getter.<br>
Furthermore, the supporting part can be damped relative to the container.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the supporting part and the partial section<br>
supporting the component carrying the getter are arranged for this purpose in a<br>
spring-elastic manner This property can be set as a function of the contour, the<br>
cross section of the elements describing the contour of said partial sections, and<br>
the material. The connection between the supporting part and the partial section<br>
supporting the component carrying the getter is provided with a flexurally rigid<br>
arrangement.<br>
In addition to the advantage of a simple and secure fixing of the position and<br>
fastening of the component carrying the getter on the holding clip and, via the<br>
clamping of the same, relative to the inner circumference of the container in a<br>
vacuum system, the solution in accordance with the invention offers the advantage<br>
of a simple fixing of the position of the component carrying the getter without<br>
needing to provide any special devices for fastening the holding apparatus.<br>
Moreover, as a result of the spring-elastic configuration it is possible to realize a<br>
simple assembly and disassembly of the holding clip from the container and/or the<br>
component carrying the getter from the holding clip. The flexurally rigid coupling of<br>
supporting part and the section supporting the component carrying the getter also<br>
produces a forced movement of the partial section supporting the getter in the<br>
case of an elastic deformation of the supporting part, so that the mounting of the<br>
component carrying the getter can occur simultaneously with the clamping of the<br>
holding clip in the container. Depending on the size of the holding clip and its<br>
configuration it can be used for any kind of container with different purposes in<br>
vacuum systems.<br>
According to an especially advantageous embodiment the holding clip is formed<br>
by a wire or a flat spring steel sheet of a low cross section. The shaping of the<br><br>
supporting part and the partial section supporting the component carrying trie<br>
getter occurs by means of a respective forming method, e.g. by bending. The<br>
holding clip is further preferably characterized by the arrangement in one plane of<br>
the supporting part and the partial section supporting the component carrying the<br>
getter. This offers the advantaged a simple production and furthermore a<br>
suitability for a large number of different purposes, especially in containers of<br>
different cross-sectional geometry because in this case there is always only a<br>
surface or line contact with the inner circumference of the container by 180°<br>
relative to each other.<br>
The flexurally rigid connection between the supporting part and the partial section<br>
supporting the component carrying the getter occurs by providing two flexurally<br>
rigid comers, namely a first flexurally rigid corner between the supporting part and<br>
a connecting piece which is aligned at an angle to the same, preferably at 90o. The<br>
second flexurally rigid comer is formed between the connecting piece and the<br>
partial section supporting the component carrying the getter. The head part of the<br>
holding clip is formed by the partial section supporting the component carrying the<br>
getter. This end section is also provided with an enclosed configuration, whereas<br>
the second end section formed by the supporting part is open.<br>
In the case of an arrangement made of a wire element or a spring steel sheet, the<br>
supporting part is formed by two leg elements which are arranged in a manner so<br>
as to be mutually offset by 180° and which are connected via a flexurally rigid<br>
connection, i.e. two flexurally rigid comers, with the partial section supporting the<br>
component carrying the getter, with said partial section also being formed by two<br>
leg elements which are mutually connected via a connecting piece For the<br>
purpose of realizing the supporting function, the distance between the two leg<br>
elements of the supporting part is chosen in such a way that in the relieved state<br>
the same is equal to or larger than the interior dimension of the container which<br>
can be integrated in a vacuum system or delimits the same at two points which are<br>
arranged mutually offset by 180° on the interior circumference of the container<br><br>
The distance between the leg elements of the partial section supporting the<br>
component carrying the getter is equal to or larger than the dimensions between<br>
two points which are arranged mutually offset by 180° on the interior<br>
circumference of the component carrying the getter which for this purpose is<br>
configured at least partly as a hollow body. This solution offers the advantage that<br>
components of different geometry which carry getters can be fastened with the<br>
holding clip arranged in accordance with the invention, because there is merely a<br>
requirement concerning the distance between two places which are mutually offset<br>
by 180° according to an especially preferable embodiment and are thus situated at<br>
mutually opposite places on the interior circumference of the component carrying<br>
the getters. Preferably, the components carrying the getters are used which are in<br>
the form of rings. They are easy to produce and to handle.<br>
When configuring the holding clip from a wire or spring steel sheet of low width<br>
and low cross section according to aforementioned especially preferable<br>
embodiment, the supporting part assumes two functions. On the one hand, it can<br>
be used in the case of elastic deformation for easing the mounting of the<br>
component carrying the getter on the partial section supporting the component<br>
carrying the getter and, on the other hand, it can additionally be used in the case<br>
of elastic deformation and relief of the clamping between holding clip and<br>
container. The positional fixing of the component carrying the getter thus occurs<br>
virtually indirectly through the supporting part in the container.<br>
According to the embodiment of the holding clip, the same is characterized with<br>
respect to its axial extension by<br>
a)	the sum total of the axial extension of the supporting part and the partial<br>
section supporting the component carrying the getter, or<br>
b)	the axial extension of the supporting part.<br><br>
In the first case, the partial section supporting the component carrying the getter is<br>
configured as a projection relative to the supporting part, whereas in the second<br>
case the partial section supporting the component carrying the getter is shaped<br>
into the supporting part. The second solution is characterized by a slight axial<br>
extension and is thus especially suitable for applications with a limited amount of<br>
construction space.<br>
In order to create holding clips for a wide variety of interior distances, the<br>
supporting part, and especially the two leg elements, is provided with a design<br>
which rises towards the end section. In this way a surface or line pressing is<br>
achieved at least always over a partial section of the supporting part depending on<br>
the outside surfaces on the leg elements and/or the interior contour of the<br>
container. According to an especially advantageous embodiment, the leg elements<br>
are provided with an arrangement where they are each rounded off at least in the<br>
end zone of the supporting part and are additionally slightly inwardly sloped in the<br>
supporting part in order to avoid any scratching of the inner surface of the<br>
container.<br>
For the purpose of improved adjustment to containers with a circular cross section,<br>
the leg parts of the supporting part are preferably shaped in a semi-circular<br>
fashion. This offers the advantage that a planar surface contact is produced in a<br>
far-reaching manner between the supporting part and the inner circumference of a<br>
tubular-shaped glass container, and not any linear surface contact which is usually<br>
characterized by higher loads.<br>
The solution in accordance with the invention is suitable for fixing the position of<br>
components carrying getters in containers, and glass containers in particular, for<br>
the use in vacuum systems irrespective of the geometry of the container. In a<br>
particularly advantageous manner, the holding clip for fixing the position of<br>
components carrying getters is used in the form of getter rings in collector tubes,<br>
and especially HV-ICR collector tubes.<br><br>
The solution in accordance with the invention will be explained below by reference<br>
to the enclosed drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a side view of a schematically simplified representation of a first<br>
embodiment of a holding clip in accordance with the invention for<br>

glass containers in particular, for use in vacuum systems;<br>

in accordance with the invention;<br>
Fig. 5 shows a holding clip according to fig. 4 in an installation situation in a<br>
container.<br>
Figs. 6a<br>
and 6b show possible cross-sectional configurations of the holding clip on the<br>
basis of a view along A-A.<br>
Fig. 1 shows in a schematically strongly simplified side view a holding clip 1 as<br>
configured in accordance with the invention for components carrying getters of<br>
different geometrical shapes. The components carrying the getters are arranged at<br>
least partly as hollow bodies for the purpose of fixing the position within containers<br>
of any desired geometrical cross section according to a first embodiment. The<br><br>
holding clip 1 comprises a first partial section 2 which supports the component<br>
carrying the getter and a second partial section which is used for support in the<br>
housing and which is also designated as supporting part 4 The partial section 2<br>
supporting the component carrying the getter and the supporting part 4 are<br>
mutually connected by way of a flexurally rigid connection Preferably, the<br>
connection is made directly, i.e the partial section 2 supporting the component<br>
carrying the getter is adjacent to the supporting part 4 via the flexurally rigid<br>
connection 21. In accordance with the invention, further means 5 are provided for<br>
the non-positive connection of the component carrying the getter with the section 2<br>
supporting the same, which in accordance with an especially advantageous<br>
embodiment is formed by the partial section 2 supporting the component carrying<br>
the getter itself, such that the same is provided with a spring-elastic arrangement<br>
and the geometry is chosen in such a way that the outside surface 6 is clamped on<br>
the partial section 2 supporting the component carrying the getter relative to the<br>
inner circumference of the getter. In this case the configuration of the partial<br>
section 2 supporting the component carrying the getter is made with respect to the<br>
function of the thickness d of the element forming the partial section 2 supporting<br>
the component carrying the getter, the geometry of the same and moreover the<br>
spring-elastic properties. The configuration is made in such a way that for the<br>
purpose of the clamping between the component carrying the getter and the<br>
supporting section which supports the same, the force that needs to be exerted by<br>
the partial section 2 relative to the inner circumference of the element carrying the<br>
getter is equal to or larger than the required theoretical holding force FH for the<br>
getter in its axial position relative to holding clip 1<br>
Supporting part 4 is configured with respect to its geometry and the properties of<br>
its material such that a clamping can be produced with respect to the container in<br>
which the holding clip 1 is introduced. It also applies in this case that the<br>
supporting part 4 is provided with a spring-elastic arrangement. At least one partial<br>
surface can be clamped on the outside surface 712, 712 with the container, i.e. the<br>
same exercises a force on the inner circumference of the container which<br><br>
corresponds to the theoretically required holding force FH for the supporting part U<br>
relative to the inner circumference of the container.<br>
Holding clip 1 is provided with an integral configuration according to fig 1 and<br>
characterized by a substantially plane geometry. This means that supporting part 4<br>
and the partial section 2 supporting the component carrying the getter are<br>
arranged in one plane. The holding clip 1 is further preferably provided with a<br>
symmetrical arrangement. The partial section 2 supporting the component carrying<br>
the getter is characterized by tower outside dimensions A2 than the supporting part<br>
4. For the purpose of providing the planar arrangement of the partial section 2<br>
supporting the component carrying the getter and the supporting part 4, the<br>
holding clip 1 is preferably arranged as a flat spring wire which was subjected to a<br>
respective shaping. The partial section 2 supporting the component carrying the<br>
getter comprises for this purpose two leg elements 9 and 10 which are n utually<br>
connected by way of a connection piece 8.<br>
They each form the outside surfaces 610 and 6.9 which are preferably aligned in<br>
a mutually opposite manner. The supporting part 4 is also formed by two leg<br>
elements 11 and 12. They are each attached to the leg elements 9 and 10.<br>
Relating to the axis of symmetry Si of the holding clip 1, they each have a larger<br>
distance A12 or A11. respectively, than the distances of the leg elements 10 and 9<br>
from the same. The distances of the leg elements 9 and 10 from the axis of<br>
symmetry S1 are each designated with A9 and A10. The coupling between the leg<br>
elements 11 and 12 of the supporting part with the leg elements 9 and 10 of the<br>
partial section 2 supporting the getter occurs via the connection pieces 13 and 14<br>
which are connected with the partial section 2 via one flexurally rigid corner with<br>
the supporting part 4 and a further flexurally rigid corner and thus realize a<br>
flexurally rigid connection 21 between the same. Preferably, the leg elements 11<br>
and 12 are configured via their axial extension in the embodiment shown in fig. 1<br>
in an inclined manner relative to the axis of symmetry S1 from the end section<br>
opposite of the partial section carrying the getter towards the partial section 2<br><br>
carrying the getter. This arrangement ensures that at least over a part of the axial<br>
extension l11.12 of the leg elements 11 and 12 they will rest on the container with<br>
their outside surfaces 711, 712 when they are installed in the container<br>
The production of the holding clip 1 occurs from a wire or a flat sheet metal strip<br>
with respective spring-elastic properties. The individual leg elements are shaped<br>
successively, e.g. in the sequence 12,14,10,8, 9, 13, 11. The configuration from<br>
a flat sheet metal strip allows planar surface contact in the case of tensioning, and<br>
especially in the case of clamping the supporting part 4, whereas in the case of a<br>
wire-like arrangement it is generally only possible to provide a linear contact<br>
Fig. 2 shows for a holding clip according to fig. 1 the state of a component 16<br>
which is clamped with the same and supports the getter. The same reference<br>
numeral is used for the same elements. The component 16 carrying the getter is<br>
configured in this illustration as a getter ring. It is braced on its inner circumference<br>
17 in this state with the outside circumference 6 of the partial section 2 supporting<br>
the component carrying the getter. Fig. 2 shows that the partial section 2 was<br>
deformed for achieving the non-positive connection with the getter 16. The outside<br>
dimensions Ag cr A10 of the two leg elements 9 and 10 are equal to or larger than<br>
the inner diameter D10 of the getter ring 16. An application of the getter ring 16 is<br>
merely possible by the action of force on the two leg elements 9 and 10, and thus<br>
by a deformation of the same and the connection piece 8 As a result of the spring-<br>
elastic properties of the partial section 2 supporting the component carrying the<br>
getter, it generates a force on the inner circumference 17 of the getter ring 16<br>
which prevents an automatic displacement of the getter ring parallel to the axis of<br>
symmetry S1 and merely allows a relative movement in the case of a larger force<br>
exerted from the outside. Said force which is exerted from the outside causes an<br>
elastic deformation, especially a pressing towards each other of the leg elements 9<br>
and 10. Preferably, the section 2 supporting the component carrying the getter is<br>
configured with respect to its spring-elastic properties in such a way that even in<br>
the case of a veitical arrangement of the holding dip 1 there is no displacement of<br><br>
the getter ring 16 relative to the partial section 2 in the direction of gravity as a<br>
result of the weight of getter ring 16.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the mounting situation of a holding clip 1 arranged according to<br>
fig. 1 in accordance with the invention with a component 16 carrying the getter in<br>
the form of a getter ring 2 according to fig. 2 in a container 18, with the container<br>
18 being arranged in the form of a collector tube 19. This shows that the<br>
supporting part 4 is braced relative to the inner surface 20 of the collector tube 19.<br>
Merely a partial section of the leg elements 11 and 12 rests on the inside surface<br>
20 of the collector tube 19. The size of the partial section which is designated here<br>
with t11,12 is a function of the inner diameter d20 of the collector tube 19, the<br>
dimension A 4 between the two leg elements 11 and 12 which are obtained from<br>
the partial distances A11 and A12, as well as the spring-elastic properties,<br>
especially the elastic limit of the material forming the leg elements 11 and 12. The<br>
fixing of the getter ring 16 usually remains unaffected by this function of the<br>
support.<br>
The introduction of the getter ring 16 into the collector tube 19 occurs in a state<br>
when mounted on the holding clip 1, with the holding clip 1 being compressed,<br>
meaning that pressure is exerted on the two elements 11 and 12m mutually facing<br>
manner. The reduction of the outside dimensions that this thus achieved, i.e. the<br>
distance between the outside circumferences 712 and 711 of the leg elements 11<br>
and 12. allows introducing the holding clip 1 with ease into the container 18, and<br>
the tube in particular. When the force on leg elements 11 and 12 is reduced, the<br>
pretensioning of holding clip 1 is eliminated and the two leg elements rest in a<br>
mutually opposite direction on the inner circumference 20 of the collector tube 19.<br>
The configuration of the holding clip 1 as described in figs. 1 to 3 represents an<br>
especially advantageous embodiment which can be formed from a simple wire<br>
element or a narrow spring steel sheet. This embodiment offers the advantage that<br>
the same is suitable for fixing in containers of different geometrical inside contours,<br><br>
meaning that the containers can be arranged as a tube or with other profile cross<br>
sections. Furthermore, the partial section 2 which supports the component<br>
carrying the getter and is represented here also allows securely fixing components<br>
of different geometrical shapes which carry getters with respect to their position.<br>
The relevant aspect is that for both bracings, the bracing of the supporting part 4<br>
with respect to the inner circumference 20 and the bracing of the partial section<br>
supporting the component carrying the getter relative to the getter 16. at least a<br>
linear contact is produced between the elements to be mutually braced. Another<br>
possibility is configuring the holding clips in such a way that a planar surface<br>
contact is also possible. However, a holding clip which is configured in such a way<br>
is no longer as versatile as those described in tigs. 1 to 3 because the<br>
configuration towards a planar surface contact is only suitable for certain<br>
applications in the case of a concrete dimensioning of the hoiding clip.<br>
Figs. 1 to 3 show an embodiment in which the supporting part and the partial<br>
section 2 supporting the component carrying the getter are switched behind one<br>
another in the axial direction and are disposed adjacent to one another. In contrast<br>
to this, figs. 4a to 4c show an alternative embodiment in which the axial extension<br>
of the holding clip l1 is characterized by the axial extension of the supporting part<br>
4.4 and thus the two leg elements 12.4 and 11.4, which are designated here with<br>
I11.4,12.4- The component 16 carrying the getter is also configured in this case as a<br>
getter ring 16.4. The partial section 2.4 supporting the component 16 carrying the<br>
getter is arranged within the axial extension of the supporting part 4.4 The basic<br>
function concerning the non-positive connection between the getter 16.4 and the<br>
partial section 2.4 carrying the getter as well as the supporting part 4.4 and the<br>
container is arranged in an analogous manner to the arrangement as described in<br>
figs. 1 to 4.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a holding clip 1.4 according to fig. 4 in the mounted state in a<br>
container 18. especially a collector tube 19.4. The method for installation is<br>
configured in analogy to the arrangement as described in fig. 3.<br><br>
Figs. 6a and 6b show the possibilities of configuring the leg elements in a strongly<br>
simplified cross-sectional view on the basis of a sectional representation along A A<br>
according to fig. 4. This shows that in the case of an embodiment according to fig.<br>
6a, the cross-sectional shape of the holding clip 1.4 is provided with a sharp-<br>
edged arrangement. Contrariiy, the configuration of the supporting part 4 in fig. 6b<br>
is made with leg elements 12.4 and 11.4 which are shaped in a semicircular<br>
fashion.<br>
This solution is especially advantageous because in this way it is possible to<br>
provide a better adjustment to the curved inside contours of containers, and glass<br>
tubes in particular. Preferably, the leg elements 11 and 12 of the supporting part<br>
are additionally inwardly inclined in the open end region, thus preventing an <br>
scratching of the glass wall.<br><br>
