				<td>The present invention relates to a scaffolding structure such as prefabricated scaffoldings, shorings and support beams, as well to a unitary frame body structure therefor.<br>
Generally, in a construction work or a civil engineering work, a prefabricated scaffolding for workers to walk thereon is installed opposedly to the outer side faces of a structure.<br>
Likewise, in a construction work, a civil engineering work, or a bridge building work, there is used a shoring or a support beam to support heavy objects such as floors and bridge girders during the work.<br>
Prefabricated scaffoldings, shorings and support, beams each employ frames in which support posts are assembled lengthwise and crosswise. For example, what is called PAL SUPPORT is used as a frame exclusive for shoring.<br>
The PAL SUPPORT is constituted by a frame which is triangular in front view and which comprises a single support post, a V-shaped lateral member connected sideways of the support post, and a connector provided at an outer end of the lateral member and having a hole.<br>
Since the frames used in the above shorings, prefabricated scaffoldings and support beams are exclusive frames formed for the respective purposes, they cannot be used in common to all of the structures, that is, they are not versatile and are therefore uneconomical.<br>
In many cases, moreover, conventional frames are not employable as single products but are assembled by combining with other components of<br>
-1A-<br><br>
different structures, thus resulting in an increase in the number of components. Besides, the work for combining discrete components is troublesome. Under the circumstances, a demand exists for the development of a frame which can be assembled easily even by unskilled workers and which is superior in working efficiency and economical.<br>
The foregoing PAL SUPPORT is advantageous in that it can be assembled lengthwise and crosswise as a single product. However, when the connector on one support post side is brought into engagement with another support post and when there later arises the necessity of removing or replacing a certain portion during work or after assembly, the vertical support posts must once be pulled out, which work is very difficult and troublesome.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a frame having versatility, superior in assembling performance, easy to be assembled and disassembled, easy to handle, and not restricted by the place for custody, as well as a structure such as a prefabricated scaffolding, shoring, or support beam, which uses the said frame and is therefore not restricted its assembling performance and which is superior in both economy and safety.<br>
In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, the frame according to the present invention comprises a support post, a first connector support member, mounted at an intermediate or nearly intermediate position of the support post, a second connector support member mounted at an upper or lower position of the support post or at both upper and lower positions of the<br>
2<br><br>
support post, one or plural lateral members secured sideways to the support post detachably or rotatably, and a connector provided at an outer end of the lateral member in a vertical position corresponding to the height of the first or the second connector support member.<br>
Further, in order to achieve the above-mentioned object, the prefabricated scaffolding according to the present invention is constituted by combining a plurality of the above frames lengthwise and crosswise.<br>
Likewise, the shoring according to the present invention is constituted by combining a plurality of the above frames lengthwise and crosswise.<br>
Likewise, the support beam according to the present invention is constituted by combining a plurality of the above frames lengthwise and crosswise.<br>
In particular, the present invention provides a scaffolding structure comprising :<br>
a support post having an axial direction and a radial direction, said support post having first and second ends ;<br>
a first support post connector arranged at said first end of said first support post, said first support post connector comprising a flange welded to said support post;<br>
a second support post connector arranged at a substantially axial middle of said support post, said second support post connector comprising a flange welded to said support post;<br>
an end radial member extending radially from said support post, said end radial member having first and second ends, said first end of said end radial member being connected to said first support post connector;<br>
-3-<br><br>
a first lateral connector arranged on said second end of said end radial member, said first lateral connector and said first support post connector being arranged at an axial distance from one of the ends of said support post;<br>
a diagonal member having a first and second endnsaid first end of said diagonal member extending from said second end of said support post in both said radial and axial directions of said support post;<br>
a second lateral connector arranged on said second end of said diagonal member said second lateral connector and said second end of said diagonal member being arranged at substantially same axial distance from one of the ends of said support post as said second support post connector.<br>
This invention also provides a unitary frame body structure comprising :<br>
a plurality of frame bodies connected together, each frame body comprising :<br>
a support post with first and second ends, said first end of said support post having a spigot portion connectable to a second end of an axially adjacent one of said plurality of frame bodies ;<br>
a first support connector comprising a flange welded to a middle of the support post;<br>
a second support connector comprising a flange welded to an upper portion of the support post;<br>
a lateral member comprising a frame secured to a side portion of the support post, and connectors comprising metallic pieces mounted at an outer end of the frame at vertical positions corresponding to the flanges<br>
-3A-<br><br>
respectively, said frame being composed of a horizontal member whose base end is connected to said flange at said upper portion, a vertical member which is integrally connected to an end portion of the horizontal member, and a diagonal member integrally connected to a lower end of the vertical member and to a lower portion of the support post,<br>
whereby a trapezoidal frame in front view is formed by said support' post and said frame, said connectors of said lateral members being connected to said flanges of a radially adjacent one of said plurality of frame bodies ; and<br>

To get an understanding of how to utilize frames according to the present invention, description will first be directed to the prefabricated scaffoldings shown in FIGS. 60 to 62.<br>
The prefabricated scaffoldings shown in FIGS.60, 61 and 62, which scaffoldings are indicated at A, use the frame shown in FIG.41. This frame comprises two support posts 1, 1 and a horizontal member 4 or 4b connected rotatably or detachably to one support post 1.<br>
A more detailed description will be given below.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 60 and 61, in the prefabricated scaffolding A<br>
11<br><br>
shown therein, a plurality of frames 3 are disposed upright in the lateral direction and at two rows in front and in the rear, the frames 3 each comprising two parallel, upright support posts 1, 1, a balustrade 2' mounted laterally between the support posts 1, 1 and a horizontal member 4 as a lateral member secured to one support post. The opposed front and rear support posts 1, 1 are detachably interconnected through the horizontal member 4 as a lateral member secured to one support post 1, while the support posts 1, 1 adjacent to each other in the lateral direction are interconnected through two horizontal balustrades 2a as lateral members secured detachably to the right-hand support post 1 in FIG. 60. Further, one or plural scaffolding boards 5 are disposed in series in the lateral direction between the front and rear frames 3, 3, and both end portions of each scaffolding board are detachably engaged through engaging portions 6 with the horizontal members 4 corresponding to the said end portions. On the outer periphery of each support post 1 are mounted perforated flanges 7 as first and second connector support members at upper, intermediate and lower positions.<br>
The balustrade 2' comprises two horizontal members which are an upper horizontal member mounted detachably between the upper flanges 7, 7 and a lower horizontal member mounted between adjacent support posts 1, 1, provided the balustrade 2' may be constituted by only the upper or the lower horizontal member.<br>
Likewise, horizontal members 4 mounted between the front and rear support posts 1, 1 are detachably connected at both ends thereof respectively<br>
12<br><br>
to the upper, intermediate and lower flanges 7, provided there may be only one horizontal member or may be two upper and lower horizontal members as shown in the figures.<br>
Although the balustrades 2a are connected to the support posts 1, 1 through flanges 7 as connector support members, there may be used other connector support members such as, for example, pins.<br>
Scaffolding boards 5 are arranged in series in the lateral direction and plural such boards are arranged in the front and rear direction, provided a single board may be used in the front and rear direction if the board is wide in the same direction.<br>
At both ends of each scaffolding boards are formed engaging portions 6 of C- or L-shaped section. Through the engaging portions 6 the scaffolding board 5 is connected detachably to the intermediate or lower horizontal members 4. In the scaffolding boards 5, 5 adjacent to each other in the lateral direction, the right-hand engaging portion 6 of the left-hand scaffolding board 5 and the left-hand engaging portion 6 of the right-hand scaffolding board 5 are formed in an alternate manner.<br>
Frames 3, 3 adjacent to each other in the lateral direction are connected together through the balustrade 2a mounted detachably between the upper flanges 7, 7. The balustrade 2a comprises two upper and lower horizontal members, right and left vertical support rods connected to end portions of the two horizontal members, and bifurcated metallic pieces 12 as connectors provided at both ends of each horizontal member. The two horizontal members may be substituted by a single horizontal member.<br>
13<br><br>
Further, one or plural baseboards 8 are disposed upright and in series laterally on each of both front and rear sides of the scaffolding boards 5. End portions of each baseboard 8 are connected to holes of the flanges 7 detachably through pins.<br>
At each of both right and left ends of the prefabricated scaffolding A is disposed a baseboard 9 upright in the front and rear direction, which is connected in the same manner as above.<br>
The following method is adopted for disposing the prefabricated scaffolding A in an opposed relation to a structure B such as a building. A large number of frames 3 are arranged upright laterally in two front and rear rows. In this case, frames 3 adjacent to each other in the lateral direction are connected together through the balustrade 2a secured detachably to one support post 1, while frames 3, 3 opposed to each other in the front and rear direction are connected together through the horizontal members 4 secured to one support post 1. In this way there is formed a scaffolding frame which is in the shape of rectangular parallelepiped in plan, in which are then mounted scaffolding boards 5 at intermediate positions to complete the scaffolding board.<br>
It is optional whether the front and rear frames 3, 3 are to be arranged at symmetric positions or arranged in an alternate fashion. In the latter case, it is the balustrade 2a that is opposed on the rear side to the front frame 3, and a horizontal member is mounted between the right-hand support post 1 of the front frame 3 and the left-hand support post 1 of the rear frame 3.<br>
14<br><br>
The support posts 1 may be raised directly on the ground. Alternatively, support posts may be raised on the ground through jacks and the support posts 1 which constitute each frame 3 may be detachably inserted respectively into the upper ends of the support rods.<br>
The support posts may be arranged one by one, or a set of two support rods connected through a horizontal support bar may be raised on the ground through jacks. Further, a plurality of frames 3 may be mounted vertically in plural stages. In this case, as shown in FIG. 53, the upper support post 1 is inserted into an upper-end hole of the lower support post 1 through a spigot portion la.<br>
FIG. 62 schematically illustrates a prefabricated scaffolding according to another embodiment of the present invention. This prefabricated scaffolding, indicated at A, has been assembled by using, for example, such a frame as shown in FIG. 3 or 9. More specifically, a frame 3a comprises one support post 1 and a balustrade 2 as a lateral member mounted laterally to the support post 1. Plural such frames 3a are laterally arranged upright in two front and rear rows. Front and rear support posts 1, 1 opposed to each other are interconnected detachably through the same horizontal members 4 as in FIG. 60, and support posts 1, 1 adjacent to each other laterally are interconnected through the balustrade 2 of one support post 1 and a metallic piece 13 as a connector. Further, one or plural scaffolding boards 5 are laterally arranged in series between the front and rear frames 3, 3, and both end portions of each scaffolding board 5 are engaged detachably with the associated horizontal members 4.<br>
15<br><br>
At the leftmost end position of the prefabricated scaffolding A is raised such one support post 1A as shown in FIG. 75, or as illustrated in FIG. 62, the same frame as the frame 3 in FIG. 60 is raised on the ground.<br>
In the case where one frame 3a comprising a single support post 1 and the balustrade 2 mounted at the upper portion of the support post 1 is to be connected to another like frame 3a, an end portion of the balustrade 2 is connected detachably to the support post of the frame 3a adjacent laterally to the one frame. The balustrade 2 comprises one or two parallel horizontal members, and one end of the balustrade 2 is connected to the support post 1 through a flange 7 or by welding or through a pin or the like. At the opposite end of the balustrade 2 is formed a metallic piece 13 as a connector, which is connected to a flange 7 on the other adjacent support post 1 side.<br>
Other structural points and assembling method are the same as in FIG. 60.<br>

FIGS. 63(A) and (B) show a scaffolding frame assembled using a frame embodying the present invention.<br>
The frame used is the frame 3C shown in FIG. 25 and plural such frames 3C are assembled in both vertical and lateral directions. In the vertical direction, upper and lower support posts 1, 1 are connected together, while frames 3C, 3C adjacent in the lateral direction are connected together by connecting the metallic piece 13 at an outer end of the frame member 2C in one support post 1 to the upper flange 7 of the other support post 1. For example, in the case where the outer surface of a building under construction is curved and a scaffolding frame Z is to be assembled along the said outer surface, the mounting angle of the metallic piece 13 in one frame member 2C relative to the flange 7 is changed. Scaffolding boards 125 are mounted along the scaffolding frame Z thus assembled. In this case, the frame members 2C not only are used as balustrades but also function as reinforcing<br>
29<br><br>
braces in a diagonal direction.<br>
FIG. 64 shows a prefabricated scaffolding assembled by using the frame shown in FIG. 32. This is substantially the same as the prefabricated scaffolding shown in FIG. 60 which has already been referred to.<br>
More specifically, such frames 3A as shown in FIG. 32 are assembled lengthwise and crosswise to form two rows of front and rear frames X, Y and scaffolding boards 5 are arranged laterally between the front and rear frames.<br>
A large number of frames 3A are laterally connected together, for example, by connecting the support post 1 of the right-hand frame to the metallic pieces 13, 13 of the left-hand frame. On the other hand, vertically arranged frames 3A are connected together by inserting the upper end of a lower support post 1 into the lower end of an upper support post 1. This connection is effected by using such a spigot portion la as shown in FIG. 53.<br>
Between the two rows of front and rear frames X, Y are mounted horizontal members to reinforce the frames, and end portions of each scaffolding board 5 are hooked to adjacent horizontal members to mount the scaffolding board.<br>
Between the left ends of the two rows of front and rear frames X, Y are mounted the above horizontal members and balustrades 50 and so are between the right ends of the frames.<br>
According to the present invention, in installing a prefabricated scaffolding around a building under construction, first an appropriate width<br>
30<br><br>
of each scaffolding board 5 is determined, then such scaffolding boards 5 having the thus-determined width are installed through frames 3A', 3A' matching the width of each scaffolding board at corners of the building under construction, and thereafter other frames 3A, 3A are made laterally contiguous to the frames 3A', 3A' to constitute an L-shaped scaffolding. As a result, the strength of the prefabricated scaffolding as a whole is improved against lateral loads because it is assembled in L shape.<br>
In this embodiment, each frame 3A' matching the width of each scaffolding board 5 at each corner is shorter in lateral size than each frame 3A, as shown in the figure.<br>
When the frames 3A are arranged continuously in the lateral direction, an adjustment of length may be made in conformity to the width of a side face of the building under construction.<br>
The following points are to be noted in connection with the above prefabricated scaffolding. The frames X and Y can be formed easily by assembling a large number of frames 3A lengthwise and crosswise. Besides, when after the frames X and Y have been formed by assembling frames 3A at a lower stage, the same frames 3A are to be assembled one by one on the so-assembled lower frames, workers get on scaffolding boards 5 located at the lower stage and in this case balustrades are sure to be formed on the scaffolding boards 5 by means of horizontal members P and 2A1. That is, the assembling work can be done safely without using a life rope. Further, after completion of the prefabricated scaffolding, diagonal members R function as reinforcing braces.<br>
31<br><br>
FIG. 65 shows a prefabricated scaffolding which has been constructed by assembling the frame of FIG. 40 lengthwise and crosswise. This is also substantially the same as the prefabricated scaffolding shown in FIG.60. More specifically, frames X and Y are arranged at two rows in front and in the rear, and scaffolding boards 5 are mounted between the frames X and Y so as to be contiguous to one another in the lateral direction. Further, between end portions of the frames X and Y are mounted a balustrade 50 and a large-sized reinforcing member 51.<br>
In arranging the frames X and Y in the lateral direction, right and left support posts 1, 1 adjacent to each other are connected together through connectors for connecting the respective flanges 7, 7, while support posts 1, 1 adjacent to each other in the vertical direction are connected together through a spigot portion la in the same manner as above.<br>
The frames X and Y arranged at two rows in front and in the rear are connected together through horizontal members 4b, 4b secured to the support posts 1, and end portions of the scaffolding boards 5 are hooked to the horizontal members 4b, 4b. Also in this case, the front and rear frames X, Y can be formed easily by assembling a large number of frames 3 in both vertical and transverse directions. Moreover, even when frames 3 are assembled one by one at an upper stage, a worker can get on a lower scaffolding board 5 while balustrades 2' are sure to be formed, and thus the work can be carried out safely.<br>
FIG, 66 illustrates a structure assembled as scaffolding or shoring, which uses a frame 3C closely similar to the frame of FIG. 19 for example.<br>
32<br><br>
More specifically, a large number of jacks J are disposed upright on the ground and are interconnected and reinforced by connecting members J1. Standard frames N are connected onto the jacks J and a plurality of frames 3C according to the present invention are connected horizontally and vertically onto the frames N. Further, a plurality of upper frames N are connected onto the frames 3C stepwise or horizontally and upper jacks J2 are mounted onto the upper frames N so as to be adjustable in height. The jacks J2 each comprise a bearer portion 130, a screw rod connected to the underside of the bearer portion 130, a flange 133 threadedly engaged with an intermediate part of the screw rod in a movable manner, and a nut and handle 132 threadedly engaged with a lower part of the screw rod. The screw rod is threadedly connected to a support post through the nut and handle 132. The reason why the upper frames N are assembled stepwise is because the outer surface of a building S under construction is inclined. Support rods M capable of expansion and retraction are used for the frames N located at the upper end. The support rods M are each connected at both ends thereof to the flanges 133 of jacks J2. Thus, jacks J and J2 are used and flanges 133 are mounted on end portion sides of the screw rods 131, further, the connecting member 11 or the support rod M is connected between the flanges 133, so that it is possible to cope with a local load. Also in this case, the frames 3C each function as both balustrade and brace.<br>
FIGS. 67(A) and (B) illustrate a fixed type shoring of a square shape in plan formed by assembling, for example, such a frame as shown in FIG. 17 in a plural number in front-rear, right-left and up-down directions. In the<br>
33<br><br>
same figures, frames adjacent to each other in the lateral direction are connected together through the metallic pieces of the left-hand frame and the flanges 7 on the support post 1 of the right-hand frame, and in this way a large number of frames are assembled successively in the lateral direction. Support posts 1, 1 adjacent to each other in the vertical direction are connected together by fitting the lower end of the upper support post onto the upper end of the lower support post 1.<br>
The upper end of the shoring in question bears the building S through jacks J, bearer portions 130 and sleepers 52 as is the case with the shoring of FIG. 66.<br>
FIGS. 68(A) and (B) illustrate a movable type shoring of a square shape in plan formed by assembling the same frames as above in front-rear, right-left and up-down directions. In the lower portion of the shoring are mounted frames 53 and casters 54 so that the shoring can be moved up to a desired position. Other structural points are the same as in the shoring of FIG. 67.<br>
FIGS. 69(A) and (B) illustrate a shoring formed by assembling the same frames as above. This shoring comprises four blocks Z1, Z2, Z3 and Z4. Each block comprises a large number of frames assembled vertically, and likewise frames are assembled on the front, rear and right, left sides to form a square shape in cross section. Then, the thus-assembled front, rear and right, left separate blocks Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4 are raised upright and connected together using horizontal members 55 to constitute a shoring in the shape of a square tower as a whole. How to connect adjacent frames laterally and<br>
34<br><br>
vertically is the same as the connecting methods for the shorings illustrated in FIGS. 67 and 68. The building under construction is supported through jacks J, sleepers 52 and support members 56 in the same manner as above.<br>

Other structural points are the same as in the support beam of FIG. 70.<br>
FIG.73 is a three-dimensional diagram of the support beam shown in FIG. 70. In the same figure, the support frames 3B are assembled in a three-dimensional form. To be more specific, support beam frames T each assembled by connecting frames 3B in the lateral direction are arranged at two rows in front and in the rear and are connected with each other through horizontal members 58 connected to flanges 7. Where required, scaffolding boards 5a or reinforcing boards are connected through their end-hooks onto the front and rear frames T with use of support posts 1. Other structural points are the same as in the support beam of FIG. 70.<br>
35<br><br>
FIGS. 74 to 82 illustrate reinforcing members for use in prefabricated scaffoldings, shorings and support beams according to the present invention.<br>
More specifically, FIG. 74(A) illustrates a balustrade 50, as described previously in connection with the prefabricated scaffolding of FIG. 64. The balustrade 50 comprises a horizontal member, a U-shaped reinforcing member, and metallic pieces 13 provided at both ends of the horizontal member.<br>
FIG. 74(B) illustrates another balustrade 50, which comprises three horizontal members, two vertical members each for connecting end portions of the horizontal members with one another, and four metallic pieces 13 provided at both ends of the upper and lower horizontal members. How to use this balustrade 50 is the same as that for the balustrade 50 of FIG. 74(A).<br>
FIG. 75(A) illustrates a reinforcing or auxiliary support post 1A, with flanges 7, 7 being provided at intermediate and upper positions of the support post 1A. For example, in the prefabricated scaffolding A shown in FIG. 60, if the use of frame 3 results in the lateral size becoming too large, the support post 1A is used reinforcementwise at an end portion of the scaffolding A instead of the frame 3. FIG. 75(B) also illustrates a reinforcing or auxiliary support post 1A, with a plurality of metallic pieces 13 being attached to a side face of the support post 1A. The support post 1A is positioned along frames and connected to the frames through the metallic pieces 13.<br>
36<br><br>
FIG. 76 illustrates a connector which is used in an auxiliary manner. For example, in the prefabricated scaffolding shown in FIG. 65, the connector in question is used for connecting flanges 7, 7 of adjacent right and left supports 1, 1 with each other. This connector comprises shoes 59, 59 and wedges 60, 60 for insertion into holes formed in the shoes. Further, the shoes 59, 59 are fitted in perforated flanges 7, 7 and in this state the wedges 60, 60 are inserted into the holes of the shoes 59, 59 and of the flanges 7, 7.<br>
FIGS. 77 and 78 illustrate horizontal members or reinforcing members as lateral members. The horizontal member shown in FIG.77 is a fixed type which comprises a pipe 60 and metallic pieces 13, 13 provided at both ends of the pipe 60. The metallic pieces 13, 13 are connected detachably to support post flanges 7, 7. The horizontal member shown in FIG. 78 is constituted by a pipe 60A capable of expansion and retraction, which pipe comprises an outer tube and an inner tube, with metallic pieces 13, 13 being provided at both ends of the pipe 60A.<br>
FIGS. 79 to 82 illustrate ? -shaped auxiliary members for the connection of support posts, which auxiliary members are each mounted between adjacent support posts, for example, in such a prefabricated scaffolding as shown in FIG. 65 or in a shoring. The auxiliary member shown in FIG. 79 comprises a horizontal pipe 61, metallic pieces 13, 13 provided at both ends of the pipe 61, two support legs 62, 62 suspended from end portions of the pipe, and metallic pieces 13, 13 provided on side faces of the lower ends of the support legs 62, 62. This auxiliary member is disposed between support posts 1, 1 of adjacent frames and the upper and<br>
37<br><br>
lower metallic pieces 13 are connected to the support posts.<br>
In the auxiliary member shown in FIG. 80, which is substantially the same as the auxiliary member shown in FIG. 79, the upper ends of support legs 62, 62 are connected to the pipe 61 rotatably and detachably. In the auxiliary member shown in FIG. 81, which is a modification of the auxiliary member shown in FIG. 79, the support legs 62 are made longer, additional metallic pieces 13 are provided at intermediate positions of the support legs, and the upper ends of the support legs 62, 62 are connected to the underside of the pipe 61 detachably through pins and brackets.<br>
The auxiliary member shown in FIG. 82, which is substantially the same as the auxiliary members shown in FIGS .79 and 81, comprises a beam 63 as a strong horizontal member which serves also as a support beam, two support legs 62, 62 suspended from the underside of the beam 63, metallic pieces 13, 13 provided at both ends of the beam 63, and metallic pieces 13, 13 provided at intermediate and lower positions of each support leg 62. In the case where a prefabricated scaffolding or shoring is large-sized and the spacing between adjacent support posts 1, 1 is large, the auxiliary member in question is connected between the adjacent support posts through the metallic pieces 13. In this case, a large space is formed below the beam 63, which space permits workers and vehicles to pass therethrough.<br>
FIG. 83 illustrates a still further example of a horizontal member or reinforcing member as a lateral member, which comprises two or more horizontal or diagonal members 2H, 2H, a metallic piece 13 hinged to base ends of the horizontal or diagonal members 2H, and metallic pieces 13, 13<br>
38<br><br>
provided at the opposite ends of the horizontal or diagonal members. Thus, the lateral member in question can be connected to a support post 1 not only horizontally but also obliquely.<br>
The following effects are attained by the present invention.<br>
(1) Since the frames defined in the claims are each provided with a<br>
support post, first and second connector support members provided on the<br>
support post, a lateral member, and a connector provided on the lateral<br>
member, a plurality of such frames can be assembled through those<br>
components in both vertical and lateral directions at a time or can be<br>
attached to another structure in a simple manner, thus permitting easy<br>
assembly of structures of various patterns. In other words, it is not<br>
necessary to provide various frames for various structures, and thus the<br>
claimed frames are superior in both versatility and assembling performance.<br>
(2) On the support post are mounted a lateral member and a connector<br>
at an outer end of the lateral member, so it is not necessary to take the<br>
trouble to provide a connecting member for the support post. Besides, even<br>
after the assembly of support posts, any of the support posts can be removed<br>
for replacement by removing the connector. Moreover, by connecting the<br>
lateral member to the associated support post itself or selectively to the first<br>
or the second connector support member, frames can be coupled together at<br>
the same height or at different heights in accordance with the mounted<br>
position of each lateral member.<br>
(3) Since the first connector support member is mounted at an<br>
intermediate position of the support post, it is possible to connect the support<br>
39<br><br>
post and a reinforcing frame to the said connector support member and hence possible to prevent buckling of the support post. Besides, since the first and second connector support members are mounted at an intermediate position and an upper or lower position of the support post, it is possible to assemble a scaffold at a height conforming to the height of the selected first or second connector support member. Particularly, when a scaffolding board is mounted through the first connector support member located at an intermediate position, it is possible to dispose the scaffolding board above the balustrade.<br>
(4) Further, since a lateral member is secured to each support post, when a prefabricated scaffolding, a shoring, or a support beam, is assembled using frames comprising such support posts and lateral members, the lateral members each serve as both a connecting member and a reinforcing brace, so it is not necessary to use braces.<br>
