				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a reinforced transition approach road<br>
for a crossover structure and a method of making the same. Crossover<br>
structure includes bridge, cross drainage or flyover.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A crossover structure is connected to road by an approach road<br>
which may be flexible type or rigid type comprising road elements built on<br>
the prepared subgrade one above another at the site of construction. The<br>
foundation of the abutment of the crossover structure rests on non-yielding<br>
strata whereas the approach road is prone to settlement due to which a level<br>
difference at the interface between the abutment and approach road gradually<br>
develops and increases with time depending upon the subgrade. When the<br>
level difference at the interface between the abutment and approach road is<br>
substantial, vehicles moving on the interface experience sudden jerks causing<br>
discomfort to passengers. It hinders speed of vehicles and affects smooth<br>
flow of traffic. It may also cause accidents/damage to vehicles particularly<br>
when they are moving at high speed. Besides periodic maintenance to level<br>
up the interface is also required. This is expensive, inconvenient and<br>
troublesome.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a reinforced transition<br>
approach road for a crossover structure which does not give rise to any<br>
significant level difference at the interface between the abutment and the<br>
transition approach road and does not cause sudden jerks to vehicles moving<br>
on the interface and discomfort to passengers.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a reinforced<br>
transition approach road for a crossover structure which does not hinder the<br>
speed of vehicles and which allows smooth flow of traffic.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a reinforced<br>
transition approach road for a crossover structure which does not cause<br>
accidents/damage to vehicles particularly when they are moving at high speed due<br>
to level difference at the interface between the abutment and the transition approach<br>
road.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a reinforced transition<br>
approach road for a crossover structure which does not require periodic â€¢<br>
maintenance to level up the interface between the abutment and the transition road<br>
and avoids expenses and inconvenience and efforts for such purpose.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method of making<br>
such a reinforced transition approach road for a crossover structure which is simple,<br>
easy and convenient to carry out.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a reinforced transition<br>
approach road for a crossover structure such as bridges and the like comprising a<br>
stiffner grid system provided on a subgrade prepared at the site of construction, one<br>
end of the said stiffner grid system being rigidly fixed to an abutment of the said "<br>
crossover structure, said grid being provided with load distributor such as herein<br>
described and road elements being built one above the other on the said stiffner<br>
system.<br>
According to the invention there is also provided a method of making<br>
a reinforced transition approach road for a crossover structure comprising<br>
supporting a stiffner grid system on the prepared subgrade at the site of<br>
construction with one end thereof rigidly fixed to the abutment of the crossover<br>
structure providing a load distributing means thereon and building road elements<br>
on the stiffner system one above another.<br>
The following is a detailed description of the invention with reference<br>
to the accompanying schematic drawings in which the sole Fig 1 is a cut section<br>
isometric view of a reinforced transition approach road and approach road of a<br>
bridge according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
Referring to Fig 1 of the accompanying drawings, the reinforced<br>
transition approach road 1 comprises a stiffner system comprising a metallic grid 2<br>
supported on the prepared subgrade 3 at the site of construction. The metallic grid<br>
may be made of metal such as aluminium or galvanised iron or steel. One<br>
end of the metallic grid is rigidly fixed to the abutment 4 of the bridge 5.<br>
The interstices 6 of the metallic grid is having granular material 7<br>
compacted therein. 8 is a load distributor comprising a high strength<br>
geosynthetic material sheet provided on the metallic grid. The geosynthetic<br>
material sheet may comprise geotextile or geogrid of 50-60 KN/m. 9 A, 9B,<br>
9C and 9D are road elements built on the stiffner system one above another.<br>
The bridge and transition approach road are connected to road (not shown)<br>
by approach road 10 comprising road elements 10A, 10B, 10C and 10D built<br>
on the prepared subgrade 3 in continuity with the transition approach road in<br>
known manner.<br>
According to the invention the road elements of the transition<br>
approach road are reinforced by the stiffner system whose rate of change of<br>
settlement/deformation gradually reduces from the distal end to the proximal<br>
end depending upon the moment of inertia thereof. Therefore, effective<br>
settlement of the transition approach road at the interface between the<br>
transition approach road and the abutment is minimal and insignificant. This<br>
continues to be so throughout the life time of the transition approach road.<br>
Due to the transition approach road being reinforced by the stiffner system,<br>
settlement/deformation of the transition approach road at the interface<br>
between the transition approach road and the approach road is also gradual<br>
and smooth and is almost in level with the settlement/deformation, if any, of<br>
the approach road. Therefore, there will not be appreciable or significant<br>
level differences between the transition approach road and the abutment and<br>
transition approach road and approach road at the interfaces thereof. As a<br>
result sudden jerks to vehicles moving on the interfaces and discomfort to<br>
passengers is avoided. There is no hindrance to the movement of the<br>
vehicles and there is fast and smooth flow of traffic at the interfaces.<br>
Accidents/damage to vehicles particularly when they are at high speed due to<br>
level differences at the interfaces is eliminated. The invention obviates the<br>
necessity for periodic maintenance to level up the interfaces and avoids<br>
expenses and efforts required for such purpose. The high strength<br>
geosynthetic material sheet ensures proper load distribution over the entire<br>
surface area of the metallic grid.<br>
The rate of settlement/deformation of the stiffiier system<br>
depends on factors such as the load acting on it, modulus of elasticity of the<br>
material of the stiffner system, moment of inertia of the stiffner system, the<br>
stiffness characteristics of the subgrade or subgrade reaction. The<br>
dimensions and material of construction of the stiffner system are decided<br>
and selected having regard to the above factors.<br>
Instead of metallic grid, the stiffner system may comprise<br>
reinforced cement concrete, neoprene or fibreglass. The load distributor<br>
may comprise a metallic sheet such as aluminium or galvanised iron or steel<br>
instead of high strength geosynthetic material sheet. Such variations in<br>
construction are to be construed and understood to be within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
