				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to power switching apparatus and, more particularly,<br>
to line-powered electronic controlled power switching apparatus. More<br>
specifically, this invention relates to line-powered electronic controlled power<br>
switching apparatus for application in a two-wire system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Electronic controlled power switching apparatus provide useful alternative<br>
to conventional mechanical switches so that power switching, for example,<br>
switching of electrical appliances and lighting apparatus, can be done by remote<br>
or wireless controlled switching, non-contact switching, touch switching or other<br>
intelligent or more sophisticated switching methods.<br>
Electronic controlled power switching apparatus are typically controlled<br>
and operated by electronic control means such as, for example, a microprocessor.<br>
The electronic control means operate the making or breaking of an electronic<br>
controllable power switching device inside the power switching apparatus upon<br>
receipt of a control command or upon fulfilment of certain prescribed conditions.<br>
In order to provide an economical and relatively maintenance-free electronic<br>
controlled power switching apparatus, it is highly desirable that the operation of<br>
the control and other peripheral circuitry of the switching apparatus is self-<br>
powered. Hence, it is advantageous if the operation power is obtained from the<br><br>
alternate current (AC) power source to which the power switching apparatus is<br>
connected so that batteries or an external power supply are not essential to its<br>
operation. This is particularly beneficial since, in many power distribution and<br>
wiring networks, extra power supply lines are not readily available.<br>
Electronic controlled power switching apparatus with power coupling<br>
means to extract power supply from the power network it is operating is known.<br>
Such power coupling means typically comprise a current transformer and a<br>
voltage transformer (for example, with voltage clamping circuitry) for coupling<br>
operating power from the AC power source to the rectifying circuitry of the power<br>
switching apparatus respectively during the "ON" and "OFF" states. An example<br>
of such self-powered switching apparatus is described in US Patent No. 6,819,014<br>
which is incorporated by reference. The primary windings of the current<br>
transformer are usually connected in series with and intermediate the AC power<br>
source and the load. Because of the serial connection, a high current rating<br>
current transformer, typically with windings of copper wire of a large core diameter,<br>
will be required for a high current rating load, since copper wire of a large cross-<br>
section is desirable for reducing adverse heat generation. On the other hand, for<br>
an electronic controlled power switch with a load current rating low, a current<br>
transformer with a large number of turns in the primary winding is necessary to<br>
maintain sufficient operating power to the control and peripheral circuitry. Hence,<br>
an electronic controlled power switch with a large current rating range would mean<br>
that a current transformer with primary windings comprising a large number of<br>
turns of a large core copper wire would be necessary.<br><br>
This dual requirement has been a major obstacle preventing electronic<br>
controlled power switching apparatus with a large operating current range from<br>
being used in practical applications, especially in applications in which a compact<br>
design is desired. Hence, it is not surprising that electronic controlled power<br>
switching apparatus adapted for mounting in wall-sockets rarely exceeds a current<br>
rating range of 0 to 10AX (amperes) due to the requirement of a bulky current<br>
transformer. Hence, it is highly desirable if there can be provided electronic<br>
controlled power switching apparatus with a relatively large current rating range<br>
while maintaining a reasonably compact size to enhance the practical utility of<br>
electronic controlled power switching apparatus.<br>
For power switching apparatus with a relatively large current rating,<br>
electronic controlled relays with mechanical means for making and breaking<br>
electrical connections between the current conducting terminals of the relays are<br>
commonly used. However, the problem of electric arcing during the breaking of<br>
mechano-electrical contacts of the relays, especially in a highly inductive circuit,<br>
may cause premature wear-out or even failure of the relays, for example, due to<br>
carbonization of the contacts. Furthermore, during making and breaking<br>
transitions, bouncing may occur at the relay contacts and arcing may result. In<br>
order to factor in the adverse effect of electrical arcing, relays of a higher power<br>
handling rating (and therefore a significantly larger size) are frequently used to<br>
provide additional safety margins. For example, a 4kVA rated relay at 250Vac<br>
voltage rating may be required for a 250V 5A application at 0.4 power factor to<br>
cater for possible arcing due to back EMF during breaking of the contacts, even<br>
though the maximum switching voltage which may appear across the current<br>
conducting terminals under normal operating conditions would be small.<br><br>
Likewise, when used in a capacitive circuit, the in-rush current during the<br>
making of the relay contacts can be very high and the current rating of a relay may<br>
far exceed the "carry current" of a relay, which is the steady state current flowing<br>
through the current conducting terminals of the relay under normal operating<br>
conditions in order to provide additional safety margin during the making of the<br>
current conducting terminals. For example, in a highly capacitive circuit, the in-<br>
rush current can be as high as 1000A even though the steady state operating<br>
current may be as low as 10A.<br>
Hence, it will be beneficial if there can be provided electronic controlled<br>
power switching apparatus with relays and with means to alleviate the need of<br>
relays of excessive power rating to provide for an adequate safety margin which<br>
will inevitably result in a larger apparatus size.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide electronic<br>
controlled power switching apparatus with line-powered switching controlled<br>
circuitry having a wider current rating range while maintaining a reasonably<br>
compact size. It is also an object of this invention to provide a line-powered<br>
controlled switching apparatus of a compact design using electronic controlled<br>
relays as the power switching elements of a power rating comparable to that of the<br>
steady "ON-" state operating state conditions. At a minimum, it is an object of this<br>
invention to provide the public with a useful choice of electronic controlled power<br>
switching apparatus. More specifically, since the coupling of operating power for<br>
the operation of the controlled circuitry of a power switching circuitry is more<br>
problematic in a two-wire system, it is a specific (but not limiting object) of this<br><br>
invention to provide a line-powered electronic controlled power switching<br>
apparatus with a relatively large current rating range suitable for use in a two-wire<br>
system. In this specification, the term "two-wire" refers generally to a wiring<br>
system in which the switching element of the subject power switching apparatus is<br>
connected intermediate between a single input from the AC power source and a<br>
single output to the load without loss of generality.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to a first preferred embodiment of a line-powered electronic<br>
controlled power switching apparatus 1 of the present invention as shown in Fig.<br>
1, and referring initially for convenience to a first gang or channel of the<br><br>
apparatus, the power switching apparatus includes an input terminal 100 for<br>
connection to an alternate current (AC) power source and a plurality of output<br>
terminals 200a-200n for connection to a corresponding plurality of loads. The<br>
load may be resistive, capacitive or inductive. The power switching apparatus<br>
comprises power switching means for making and breaking the electrical<br>
connection between the AC power source and the load, electronic controlled<br>
circuitry for controlling and operating the power switching means, power coupling<br>
means for coupling operating power from the AC power source to the electronic<br>
controlled circuitry. The power coupling means includes "ON" state 130 and<br>
"OFF state power coupling circuits 140. The "OFF" state coupling circuit includes<br>
a high impedance circuit which couples operating power to the control circuitry<br>
during the "OFF" state when the switching element is broken. An example of a<br>
suitable "OFF" state coupling circuit is described in US Patent Publication No.<br>
2003-0160517 and is incorporated herein. The "ON" state power coupling circuit<br>
130 comprises a current transformer with coupled primary and secondary<br>
windings with its output connected to a rectifying means to provide the necessary<br>
DC operating power for the switching apparatus.<br>
The primary windings are connected in series between the AC power<br>
source and the load and provide a current passage path for the current flowing<br>
from the AC power source to the load. In this preferred embodiment, the primary<br>
windings comprise first sub-primary windings 131 and second sub-primary<br>
windings 132 which are connected in series. The first sub-primary windings 131<br>
are of a significantly larger current rating than the second sub-primary windings so<br>
that a current exceeding the current rating of the second sub-primary windings<br>
132 can pass from the AC power source to the load via the first sub-primary<br><br>
windings 131. As the second sub-primary windings are adapted for handling<br>
current of a lesser magnitude, a finer conductor can be used and the number of<br>
windings in the second sub-primary windings can be significantly more than the<br>
number of windings in the first sub-primary windings without substantially<br>
increasing the size of the transformer. By having a second sub-primary windings<br>
132 of a finer conductor and a higher number of windings, a sufficiently high<br>
operating power can be coupled across to the secondary windings 133 of the<br>
current transformer during the low-current state of the power switching means<br>
when under such conditions only a relatively small current will flow through the<br>
primary windings. Thus, the second sub-primary windings 132 is provided, in<br>
addition to other purposes, to ensure that sufficient operating power is available to<br>
the secondary side of the current transformer when only a small current flows from<br>
the AC power source to the load, for example, when the power switching<br>
apparatus is adapted for a low-current switching application such as a low rating<br>
incandescent lamp with a power rating of as low as 10W.<br>
The power switching means includes an electronic controlled mechanical<br>
switching device such as a relay 110. The making and breaking of the current<br>
conducting terminals of the relay 110 is controllable by a third terminal which is<br>
connected to the controlling means 300 via a relay control circuitry 310a. The<br>
current input terminal 111 of the relay 110 is connected to a junction 134<br>
intermediate the first sub-primary windings 131 and the second sub-primary<br>
windings 132 so that a complete current loop comprising the AC power source,<br>
the first sub-primary windings, the current conducting terminals of the relay and<br>
the load can be formed when a high current path is needed. With this<br>
configuration, a large current which exceeds the current rating of the second sub-<br><br>
primary windings 132 can flow from the AC power source to the load via the first<br>
sub-primary windings 131 while substantially bypassing the second sub-primary<br>
windings. Although the first sub-primary windings 131 have a significantly smaller<br>
number of windings than the second sub-primary windings 132, the high current<br>
flowing through the first sub-primary windings would mean that sufficient power<br>
will be coupled to the secondary windings for operation of the electronic controlled<br>
circuitry under this large current operating condition. The output terminal of the<br>
second sub-primary windings, that is, the terminal not connected to the first sub-<br>
primary windings, is connected to an electronic controllable shunting device so<br>
that the series combination of the second sub-primary windings 132 and the<br>
shunting device 120 forms a controllable shunting or bypassing branch across the<br>
current conducting terminals of the relay as and when necessary.<br>
When the switching element of the relay 110 is in the "ON" state and when<br>
the current flowing from the AC power source to the load is below a level which is<br>
not large enough to provide sufficient operating power to the electronic circuitry<br>
("the lower threshold current"), the current sensing means in the apparatus will<br>
notify the controlling means. Upon detection of this operating state notification,<br>
the controlling means will cause the controllable shunting device to be turned on<br>
and the relay to be turned off. Consequently, current will flow through the first and<br>
the second sub-primary windings and through the shunting means. As a result,<br>
adequate operating power can be coupled across to the secondary side of the<br>
power transformer from the totality of the primary windings, even though the<br>
current flowing in the first sub-primary windings alone is not sufficient to impart the<br>
sufficient operating power to the control circuit. When the power switching<br>
apparatus is in the "OFF" state, that is, when both the relay and the shunting<br><br>
means are not conductive, a relatively large voltage, for example, a voltage<br>
comparable to the AC power source line voltage, will appear across the "OFF"<br>
state power coupling power circuit 140, and a reasonable power level for<br>
operation of the electronic controlled circuitry will be available without loss of<br>
generality.<br>
The electronic control circuitry comprises a controller or a controlling<br>
means such as a microcontroller unit (MCU) or a microprocessor which is<br>
connected to the secondary side of the current transformer via a voltage regulator<br>
150 and a rectifying means 151. The rectifying means 151 may be a full-wave<br>
bridge rectifier and the DC power regulator is adapted to provide regulated DC<br>
supply of a plurality of DC voltages for operation of the MCU and other peripheral<br>
circuits. The peripheral circuits 310 may include remote-control or touch switching<br>
sensing circuitry for receiving control commands from the outside. Of course, the<br>
MCU may also be programmed to perform pre-configured switching of the load.<br>
In order to control the current path, that is, to decide whether a substantial portion<br>
of the current should flow through the relay or the shunting means, a first<br>
monitoring means, which can be power or voltage monitoring means, is provided.<br>
An exemplary first monitoring means may comprise a voltage detector<br>
which provides information on current flowing through the primary windings by<br>
monitoring the voltage at the rectifier output. When the current flowing in the first<br>
sub-primary windings is above a threshold value, the output voltage at the bridge<br>
rectifying output will exceed a pre-determined value. On the other hand, when the<br>
current flowing through the first sub-primary windings drops below a threshold, the<br>
rectifier output voltage will also drop below a prescribed level. When this low<br><br>
current level is detected, the controlling means will cause the shunting means to<br>
operate so that a substantial portion, if not the entirety, of the load current will flow<br>
through the second sub-primary windings as well, thereby imparting sufficient<br>
operating power to the controlled circuitry. On the other hand, if the current<br>
flowing through the second sub-primary windings 132 exceeds the current rating<br>
of the second sub-primary windings 132 (or another pre-determined threshold<br>
value, for example, at a safety margin below the current rating), a current<br>
detection means, for example, the "High Current Detector" of Fig. 1, which is<br>
connected to detect the current flowing through the second sub-primary windings<br>
will show that the current has exceeded a prescribed threshold. At that instant,<br>
the controller unit 300 will turn on the relay 110 so that a substantial portion of the<br>
current will flow through the relay to avoid damage to the second sub-primary<br>
windings. An exemplary operating logic of the switching control by the MCU is<br>
shown in Table A below.<br><br>
In the above Table, the symbols have the following meaning and<br>
significance with reference to the Figures. As described generally in the<br>
description, the primary windings of the current transformer comprise two winding<br><br>
groups, P1 130 and P2 131. P1 comprises windings of copper wire with a larger<br>
cross-sectional area and a small number of turns while P2 comprises windings of<br>
copper wire with a smaller cross-sectional area and a larger number of turns. For<br>
high current rated loads, the current flows through P1 and the relay. For low<br>
current rated loads, the current flows through P1 and P2 and the triac. The<br>
decision logic is determined by two input signals to the controller, namely LVD and<br>
HCD.<br>
In this circuit arrangement, the LVD (Low Voltage Detection) will be high<br>
(logic 1) when the output voltage of the secondary windings of the current<br>
transformer is below the lower threshold. Thus, LVD="1" or High will suggest that<br>
the magnitude of the current flowing through windings P1 alone may not be<br>
sufficient to maintain control circuit operation. Upon detection of a high LVD, the<br>
controller will activate the shunting means so that current will flow through both P1<br>
and P2. HCD (High Current Detection) will be high when the current flowing<br>
through the second sub-primary windings P2 exceed an upper limit. Hence, when<br>
HCD="1" or "High", the current flowing through P2 is considered too high and the<br>
controlling means will activate the relay and de-activate the triac to direct current<br>
flow.<br>
For example, as shown in the first row of Table A, when a substantial<br>
portion of the load current is flowing through the shunting means T, and the<br>
outputs at both voltage monitoring means LVD and HCD are low, this signifies a<br>
low current operation and a small current flowing through the combined primary<br>
windings (that is, the series connection of both the first and the second sub-<br><br>
primary windings), the conduction path will be maintained via a shunting means<br>
and across the combined primary windings.<br>
On the other hand, when a substantial portion of the load current is flowing<br>
through the shunting means T as shown in the second row of Table A and the<br>
HCD output is high, which signifies that a current exceeding a prescribed<br>
threshold level is flowing through the second sub-primary windings, the MCU wilt<br>
turn on the relay so that the load current will be diverted to flow substantially<br>
through the first sub-primary windings and the relay, thereby alleviating possible<br>
damage to the second sub-primary windings. The shunting device used in this<br>
preferred embodiment includes an electronic controllable shunting device which<br>
provides a low-impedance shunt across two of its terminals when an actuating<br>
signal is detected. Triacs, MOSFETs and IGBT are examples of suitable shunting<br>
devices, although a triac is used in the circuit diagram as a preferred example,<br>
since additional zero-current crossing detection circuitry, which are known to<br>
persons skilled in the art, would be required if other shunting components or<br>
devices are use.<br>
Referring to the operating conditions as shown in row 7 of Table A, the<br>
instantaneous power transfer is through the relay and the LVD output is high while<br>
the HPD output is low, this operating conditions signify a low current operation of<br>
the power switching apparatus. Upon detection of such operating conditions, the<br>
MCU will activate the controllable shunting means so that current will begin to flow<br>
through the first and second sub-primary windings so that an adequate level of<br>
operating power can be coupled across to the secondary windings of the power<br>
transformer for operation of the control circuitry.<br><br>
To avoid logic ambiguity or conduction path oscillation during switching<br>
between the various conduction paths due to variations in component<br>
characteristics or parameters such as core material characteristics, leakage flux<br>
from the current transformer, control circuits power demand, etc., it is desirable<br>
that It &gt; Ir, where,<br>
Ir = lower limit of the current (I) through P1 that activates LVD during relay<br>
conduction<br>
It = upper limit of I through P1&amp;P2 that activates HCD during triac conduction, and<br>
I = sum of all the load currents = I1 + I2 + I3 + ... .+ln<br>
More specifically, it is highly preferable if It min &gt; Ir max under all extreme<br>
conditions of circuit component variations that can be predictable.<br>
The protection of the relays from electric arcing and/or in-rush currents<br>
during making or breaking of the current conducting terminals of the relays will be<br>
described in further details below and with reference to the timing diagram of Fig.<br>
3 and Fig. 4.<br>
When a relay is connected to a capacitive load, such as fluorescent lamps<br>
with parallel capacitors for power factor correction, the in-rush current during the<br>
making of the conducting terminals of the relays can be very high. Experiments<br>
showed that the in-rush current can be as high as 2-4kA and can last for tens of<br>
microseconds which may be sufficient to melt the metal contacts of the relays and<br>
causes permanent damage. To alleviate the potential hazards associated with<br>
possible current in-rush due to a capacitive load, a voltage zero-crossing detection<br><br>
circuit is provided so that the instant of voltage zero-crossing of the AC power<br>
source can be detected monitored and utilized.<br>
Referring to the timing diagram of Fig. 3, upon detection of the voltage<br>
zero-crossing of the AC power source, the zero-crossing detection circuitry will<br>
send out a signal to the MCU. When the MCU detects a control command which<br>
requests for making of a conduction path between the AC power source and the<br>
load, the MCU will first wait for the voltage zero-crossing signal. Once the voltage<br>
zero-crossing signal has been detected, the MCU will trigger the shunting means<br>
at the next anticipated voltage zero-crossing point so that a low-impedance<br>
shunting branch comprising the shunting means and the second sub-primary<br>
windings will be formed across the current conducting terminals of the relay.<br>
After this shunting branch has been formed, the MCU will then close the<br>
current conducting terminals of the relay via the relay controlled circuitry to make<br>
the connection between the current conducting terminals of the relays. After the<br>
electrical conditions across the relay contact terminals have been stabilized, the<br>
shunting device can be opened again so that a substantial portion of the current<br>
will then flow through the relay, instead of the shunting device. As the shunting<br>
means was turned on during the voltage zero-crossing of the AC source, the in-<br>
rush current will not be damaging and the current flowing through the shunting<br>
means will gradually change, thereby alleviating the risk of damage to the relay<br>
contact terminals due to current in-rush.<br>
Turning next to the protection of the relay from electric arcing due to<br>
change of the current conducting terminals of the relay from making to the<br>
breaking when an inductive load is connected and with reference to Fig. 4.<br><br>
When the relay is to be opened, the controller will prepare for the breaking<br>
of the relay by firstly sending an actuation signal to the triac 120 gate. At this<br>
instant, because of the inherently low resistance requirements of the switchable<br>
conductive element of a relay, the voltage across the two current conducting<br>
terminals of the relay 110 will be inherently low. As the current conducting<br>
terminals of the triac 120 are connected generally in parallel with the relay 110,<br>
such a low voltage drop will not be sufficient to drive the triac into conduction<br>
mode, but the triac will be conducting once its terminal voltage exceeds a pre-<br>
determined threshold. After the triac has been prepared for conduction, the relay<br>
connection can be broken. The voltage across the relay terminals will then rise to<br>
a level which is sufficient to cause and sustain triac conduction, (this voltage will<br>
be in the range of a few to tens of volts depending on the triac gate current), the<br>
triac will then be in conduction mode and provides a low-resistance and low<br>
voltage shunting branch to the relay, whereby arcing and back can be alleviated.<br>
As shown in the voltage and current timing diagrams of Figs. 4A and 4B,<br>
upon detection of a command to break the load connection from the AC power<br>
source, the MCU sends an actuation signal to drive the triac so that the triac is<br>
ready for conduction. As the shunting device is a triac in this specific example, the<br>
triac will not be conducting until the relay has been opened and an actuation<br>
voltage has been developed across the relay terminals. Thereafter, the relay will<br>
be opened and the voltage developed across the relay terminals will cause<br>
conduction of the triac. Once the triac is in conduction, a low-impedance low-<br>
voltage shunting branch comprising the shunting device and the second sub-<br>
primary windings will be formed across the relay terminals whereby the voltage<br>
across the relay terminals will be damped. As a result, the back EMF which would<br><br>
otherwise appear across the contact terminals of the relay will be substantially<br>
damped or reduced due to the low-impedance shunting path and the likelihood of<br>
electric arcing is substantially reduced. After the relay contacts have been<br>
stabilized in the breaking position, the MCU will deactivate the triac actuation<br>
signal and the shunting path will be turned off at the subsequent zero-current<br>
crossing to substantially isolate the load from the AC power source.<br>
Alternatively, a MOSFET or other electronic switching means, such as<br>
IGBT, could be used as a shunting device. When such shunting devices are used,<br>
the shunting means can be turned on at or near the zero voltage, followed by the<br>
opening of the relay conductive elements while the low-impedance, low-voltage<br>
shunting branch has been formed. After the relay contacts has been stabilized in<br>
the breaking condition, with an additional zero-current crossing detection circuitry,<br>
the MCU will turn off the shunting path at zero-current crossing to substantially<br>
isolate the load from the AC power source. In the present specific example, a<br>
triac is used as a shunting device. When an actuating signal is sent to the triac,<br>
the triac will be ready to turn on once the voltage across its conducting terminals<br>
has been built up, although there will be some delay between the receipt of the<br>
actuation signal and the conduction of the triac. After the relay contacts have<br>
been stabilized in the breaking position, the triac is turned off by the MCU at the<br>
current zero-crossing point when the load current is reduced to zero. By<br>
maintaining current continuity through the shunting path comprising the triac and<br>
the turning off characteristics of the triac, the risk of electric arching during the<br>
transition from making to breaking of the contact terminals of the relay is<br>
substantially reduced.<br><br>
Referring again to Fig. 1, it will be noted that a plurality of power switching<br>
means arranging into a plurality of individually controllable gangs or channels can<br>
be connected in parallel so that the individual power switching means can be<br>
selectively controlled and activated by the controller (MCU). Of course, the<br>
switching apparatus can comprise a single switching channel or a plurality of<br>
switching channels to suit the appropriate applications without loss of generality.<br>
Furthermore, by having the selective current conduction paths together within a<br>
single switching gang, a plurality of switching means (or channels) can be<br>
accommodated within a relatively small compartment or unit with all the respective<br>
monitoring and control as well as the relay control circuitry.<br>
In the above description, only a first gang or channel of the switching<br>
apparatus has been described. It will be understood that the same principles<br>
apply to the other gangs without generality.<br>
The circuit arrangement of a second preferred embodiment of a line-<br>
powered electronic controlled power switching apparatus 2 of the present<br>
invention as shown in Fig. 2 comprises components which are substantially<br>
identical to that of the first preferred embodiment except that the circuit topology<br>
between the first and second sub-primary windings and the relay (the<br>
electromechanical switching device) and triac (the shunting means) are different.<br>
Referring to the circuit diagram of Fig. 2, the "ON" state power coupling<br>
circuit 130a comprises a current transformer with coupled primary and secondary<br>
windings with its output connected to a rectifier means to provide the necessary<br>
DC operating power for the switching apparatus 2. The primary windings<br>
comprises first sub-primary windings 131a and second sub-primary windings 132a<br><br>
which are connected in parallel, with their common node connected to the input<br>
terminal 100. Similar to the first sub-primary windings of the first preferred<br>
embodiment, the first sub-primary windings 131a of this second preferred<br>
embodiment comprises windings of copper wire having a larger cross-sectional<br>
area but with a lesser number of windings compared to the second sub-primary<br>
windings to cater for high current rating applications. The output of the first sub-<br>
primary windings 131a is connected simultaneously in common to the inputs of a<br>
plurality of relays 110-110n at the common node 111a. The second sub-primary<br>
windings 132a comprises copper wire of a smaller cross-sectional area but with a<br>
larger number of turns to cater for small current rating applications, similar to that<br>
of the second sub-primary windings 132 of the first preferred embodiment. The<br>
output of the second sub-primary windings 132a is connected simultaneously to<br>
the inputs of a plurality of electronic controllable shunting means which are also<br>
triacs as a convenient example. The first and the second sub-primary windings<br>
and their respective circuits provide alternative current paths so that the controlling<br>
means 300 can select the appropriate current circuits upon detection of the<br>
current level in the primary or sub-primary windings. For example, when the<br>
current flowing in the second sub-primary windings exceeds a pre-determined<br>
threshold which signifies that the current rating of the second sub-primary<br>
windings may be exceeded, the controller 300 can turn on the relay 110 and turn<br>
off the triac 120 so that the large current can be confined in the first sub-primary<br>
windings of a larger current rating. Likewise, when the current flowing in the first<br>
sub-primary windings 131a drops below a pre-determined threshold value which<br>
signifies that the operating power can be obtained from the first sub-primary<br>
windings may be insufficient, the controller 300 will cause the triac 120 (or 11 On)<br><br>
to be turned on and relay 110 (or 120n) to be turned off so that the current will be<br>
directed into the windings with a higher number of turns to impart sufficient<br>
operating power to the operating circuit of the switching apparatus 2. The relay<br>
protection circuitry, as described in the first embodiment above, is substantially<br>
identical as that of the first preferred embodiment and will not be repeated without<br>
loss of generality. Figs. 5a and 5b illustrate respectively circuits typical of the first<br>
and second embodiments with only a single gang shown for simplicity.<br>
The circuit topology as shown in Fig. 6 shows a modified and generalized<br>
embodiment of the series configuration of the first preferred embodiment of Fig. 1.<br>
The primary windings of the current transformer on the primary side of the power<br>
coupling means comprises a plurality of sub-primary windings connected in series,<br>
to further increase the operating current range of the switching apparatus.<br>
Referring to the circuit arrangement of Fig. 6, the primary windings<br>
comprises a plurality of sub-primary windings, namely, P1, P2	Pn. Each of the<br>
sub-primary windings have a different number of turns (N)pi and in which (N)P1 
(N)P2 
the specific sub-primary winding i and the core diameter of the copper conductor<br>
in each of the sub-primary windings is designated by (D)Pi. A plurality of switching<br>
devices are connected in parallel between the output node of each of the sub-<br>
primary windings and the load. As a convenient example, the serially connected<br>
sub-primary windings and the switches have the following relationships:-<br><br><br><br>
where, Ri means the volt-ampere rating of the switching devices,<br>
(N)Pi = the number of turns of the respective sub-primary windings and,<br>
D represents the core diameter of the conductive wire of the specific sub-primary<br>
windings.<br>
In this specific example, the core diameter of the conductive winding of the<br>
sub-primary windings progressively decreases while the number of turns of the<br>
sub-primary windings increases as the sub-windings are further away from the live<br>
terminal or the input node 100. In addition, the power rating of the switching<br>
devices decreases as their input terminals are further away from the life node so<br>
that a large current can be branched off before reaching sub-primary windings of<br>
lower current rating.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a generalized circuit topology of the current splitting<br>
arrangement of the embodiment of Fig. 2. In this topology, a plurality of sub-<br>
primary windings of different current ratings are arranged in parallels so that a<br>
common node of the sub-primary windings are connected to the live terminal while<br>
their respective output terminals are connected to the input of the respectively<br>
connected switching devices which can be relays or other switches or a<br>
combination of the same. As a convenient example, the parallel sub-primary<br>
windings have the following relationships:-<br><br><br><br>
By connecting a switching device having a large current rating to a sub-<br>
primary windings of a larger rating and so on and so forth, an electronic controlled<br>
line-powered switching apparatus of a wide current range can be obtained in<br>
accordance with the principles of the present invention with reference to the<br>
examples described before.<br>
Specific Example<br>
In a specific example of a switching apparatus with the topology of Figs. 5<br>
and 5a for fitting into a 35mm wall socket conforming to British standard BS4662,<br>
with the number of gangs or channels n=4 and with a load rating range of between<br>
15 to 1600VA, the following are the exemplary components and their descriptions.<br>
The electromechanical switching device is an Omron G6S relay with a<br>
Rated Carry Current of 2A which means the maximum recommended switching<br>
current should not exceed 2A. For application in a switching Voltage = 250, the<br>
normal maximum switching current (without protection) would be under 0.26A so<br>
as not to exceed the maximum switching current. The electronic controllable<br>
shunting means is a triac of the ST T4 series which is specified for a current flow<br>
between 0.06 and 0.75A. As an example, when the current flowing through the<br>
triac is approaching or at 0.75A, the relay will be switched on so as to shift current<br>
passage from the triac to the relay. The secondary windings has 1000 turns of<br>
0.1mm diameter copper wire. The primary windings composed of two groups, P1<br>
and P2. P1 has 30 turns of 1.0mm diameter copper wire. P2 has 150 turns of<br>
0.3mm diameter. During relay conduction, current passes through P1. The wire<br><br>
of P1 with a core diameter of 1mm can cater the maximum current up to 8A<br>
without excessive heat generation. During triac conduction, current passes<br>
through both P1 and P2. The number of turns in P2 can generate a DC power of<br>
about 20mW at the secondary windings for control circuit At the same time, it can<br>
also allow current up to 0.75A flowing through without excessive heat generation<br>
of transformer.<br>
Prevention of Conduction Path Oscillation<br>
Considering component variations, the maximum lower limit current of<br>
relay, Ir max = 0.5 + d1 A, where d1 is the maximum allowable current deviation,<br>
at which the LVD changes from low to high, and 0.5A is a nominal value. On the<br>
other hand, the minimum upper limit current of triac (taking all the component<br>
variations into consideration) is It min = 0.75 - d2 A where d2 is the maximum<br>
current deviation, at which the HCD changes from low to high, and 0.75A is the<br>
nominal value. To prevent conduction path oscillation, It min &gt; Ir max, i.e. 0.25 &gt;<br>
d1 + d2 for the present example.<br>
In other words, sum of the deviations of relay and triac conduction current at state<br>
changing must be less than 0.25A. If the deviation is larger than 0.25A, then the<br>
nominal values of Ir and It must be selected such than their differences have a<br>
higher value. On the other hand, the higher the value, the narrower will be the<br>
range of load ratings. So, a balance value has to be selected for optimum<br>
performance.<br>
While the present invention has been explained by reference to the<br>
examples or preferred embodiments described above, it will be appreciated that<br><br>
those are examples to assist understanding of the present invention and are not<br>
meant to be restrictive. The scope of this invention should be determined and/or<br>
inferred from the preferred embodiments described above and with reference to<br>
the Figures where appropriate or when the context requires. In particular,<br>
variations or modifications which are obvious or trivial to persons skilled in the art,<br>
as well as improvements made thereon, should be considered as falling within the<br>
scope and boundary of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, while the present invention has been explained by reference<br>
to a power switching apparatus with power switching means comprising a parallel<br>
disposition of a relay and a triac, it should be appreciated that the invention can<br>
apply, whether with or without modification, to other combination of switching<br>
means or devices without loss of generality.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
POWER SWITCHING APPARATUS<br>
The present invention relates to a power switching apparatus comprising a current<br>
transformer (130) with coupled primary (131, 132) and secondary (133) windings, the<br>
primary windings (131, 132) being adapted for series connection between alternate<br>
current power source and load, the primary windings comprising first (131) and<br>
second (132) sub-primary windings of different number of turns of windings and<br>
respective of a larger and a smaller core diameter, a current conduction path being<br>
provided from intermediate (134) the first (131) and the second (132) sub-primary<br>
windings to the power switching means (110) so that upon detection of a current<br>
exceeding the current rating of the second sub-primary windings (132), current will be<br>
caused to flow from alternate current power source to load via a current loop<br>
comprising the power switching means (110) and the first sub-primary windings (131)<br>
only.</td>
