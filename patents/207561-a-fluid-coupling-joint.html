The flanges are welded to and about the periphery of corresponding spaced pipes one of which is inserted in the bore of the seal. The flanges are joined by . two bolts, one flange being fixedly secured to the bolts and the other resiliently movably secured to the bolts by a pair of springs to permit that other flange to rotate in response to rotation of the pipe affixed thereto. The one flange forms a static wedge-like seal joint with one of the pipes and the other flange a dynamic seal joint with the respective seal spherical surfaces, the spherical seal and flange surfaces being urged together in wedged relation by the springs.</td>

This invention relates to a fluid coupling joint, and more particularly to pipe joints employing spherical seals for automotive exhaust systems.<br>
Pipe joints for certain automotive exhaust systems employ seals with spherical surfaces. For example, prior art joints and seals are disclosed in US Pat. Nos. 5,499,825 and 5,040,805, incorporated by reference herein. Typical exhaust joints comprise a seal, usually formed into a preform of a wire mesh and filler material, and then crushed by dies to the end seal shape as illustrated in the aforementioned patents. The seals may be rigid or compliant in accordance with the seal construction. A lubricant or lubricating material is incorporated in the seal to provide a lubricating surface.<br>
The seals are annular with a radially outer convex spherical segment surface and opposing planar end surfaces as shown in Pat. No. 5,499,825. In this patent, circular cylindrical through bore communicates with the planar end surfaces for receiving a pipe concentric with the spherical annular surface. A flange is welded in fixed position to the received pipe spaced from the pipe end edge and has a planar<br><br>
to rotate relative to the first pipe about the seal second spherical surface and for resiliently axially urging the flanges against the corresponding seal spherical and tapering surfaces and for urging the seal first edge into the recess to wedge the seal between the first flange and the first pipe outer cylindrical surface in the wedge-like relation.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a fluid coupling joint comprising: means for fluid coupling first and second fluid pipes including a first flange for movably coupling the first pipe in movable sealing engagement with a seal relative to a second flange and relative to the second pipe, said second flange for securing the second pipe thereto and to the seal in a relatively fixed position, said joint including means for resiliently urging said first flange and the seal toward the second flange with the seal and flanges in sealing engagement while permitting said first flange and first pipe to move relative to the second flange, to said second pipe and to said seal, characterized in that the seal comprises: an annular member having first and second annular radially outwardly facing surfaces terminating adjacent to respective opposite annular seal edges and facing in opposing axial directions and a central axially extending opening therethrough forming an inner cylindrical seal surface extending to said edges for receiving said second pipe, said first surface tapering toward said inner cylindrical surface at a first of said edges generally in said axial direction and dimensioned for sealing wedge-like engagement with the second flange and in wedge-like engagement with said second pipe, said second surface being spherical and dimensioned for rotational sealing engagement with said first flange, said first flange for urging the seal in engagement with and between the second flange and second pipe.<br><br>
IN THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING:<br>
The sole figure is a side elevation sectional view of a joint and seal according to the present invention.<br>
In the Figure, joint assembly 2 is particularly adapted for use with automotive exhaust systems. However, the assembly may be employed in other fluid distribution systems in which it is desired that one pipe be relatively movable with respect to a second pipe in the system. The assembly 2 comprises a joint 4 for sealingly attaching a circular cylindrical, preferably stainless steel, pipe 6 to a second circular cylindrical, preferably stainless steel, pipe 8. Pipes 6 and 8 are conventional for use in automotive exhaust systems for conveying hot toxic combustion engine exhaust gases.<br>
In such exhaust systems, the joint must be essentially leak proof while permitting one pipe to rotate with three degrees of rotational freedom and no translation relative to the other. When automobiles, for example, are stationary, leaking exhaust gases may undesirably seep into the vehicle passenger cabin. If the joint is prior to the catalytic converter, untreated exhaust gas may escape. Under certain<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
