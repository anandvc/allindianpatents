IMPROVED POURING DEVICE<br>
This invention relates to an improved pouring device and to a container including such a pouring device, and in particular, though not exclusively, to a container for liquid.<br>
A number of problems exist with presently known pouring devices and with containers incorporating such pouring devices. For example, containers for engine oil usually comprise a screw lid that screws on to a threaded neck of the container. In use, a user removes the lid from the container, positions the neck of the container over the filling point of a vehicle's engine and pours the oil into the engine. This type of container suffers from the disadvantage that oil can be spilt from the container before the neck is correctly positioned over the filling point of the engine and while the oil is being poured into the engine. This type of container also suffers from the disadvantage that the rate of flow of oil from the container cannot be easily controlled.<br>
Furthermore, known containers usually employ pouring devices that comprise two or more separable parts, e.g. a body providing a pouring aperture1 and a removable lid such as a screw lid. When the removable lid is removed from the pouring device, the lid can be misplaced. Known containers also often require the use of two hands to facilitate pouring.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate one or more of the aforementioned problems in the prior art.<br>
It js a further object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to provide a pouring device which, in use, does not require parts of the device to be remotely separated.<br><br>
It is a further object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to provide a container having a pouring device that allows a user to control the rate of flow of fluid or liquid through the pouring device.<br>
It is a further object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to provide a container that allows a pouring device of a container containing fluid or liquid to be placed in a non-vertical pouring position, which can be, for example, around 45° to the vertical, above a receiver for the fluid or liquid, before any of the fluid or liquid leaves the container.<br>
In particular, it is an object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to provide a container for an engine oil that prevents spillage of the engine oil while the container is being positioned over a filling point of a vehicle's engine and placed in a pouring position.<br>
IrV particular, it is a further object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to provide a container for an engine oil that allows a user of the container to control the rate of flow of oil from the container in order to reduce or prevent spillage when the oil is poured into a vehicle's engine.<br>
