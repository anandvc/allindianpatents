The present invention relates to a crystal of bicalutamide having a defined form and a production method thereof.<br><br>
(hereinafter somnetimes referred to as compound of the formula (I) or compound (I) in the present specification) has been reported to be useful as a compound having an antiangrogenic action {JP-B-4-32061, US Patent No. 4,636,505 and W00l/34563). As a synthetic method of the compound of the formula (I), for example, a method comprising a reaction of 4'-cyano-3-(4-fluorophenylthio)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3'-<br><br>
(3) or compound (3)) in methylene chloride solution with m-chloroperbenzoic acid is known (Howard Tucker et al, J. Med. Chem., Vol. 31, 954-959 (1988), and W001/28990). In this method, methylene chloride is used as a solvent. Halogenated organic solvents such as methylene chloride and the like are generally harmful for human body, and the possibility of<br><br>
carcinogenicity thereof has been suggested. Furthermore, they may produce dioxin during waste treatments. Halogenated organic solvents such as methylene chloride and the like are associated with the problems of economic burden for the cost of waste treatment after use, and of corrosion of incinerator used for the waste treatment.<br>
In recent years, "Green chemistry" has been drawing attention as one of the measures for risk reduction of chemical substances, and industrial application of environmentally benign type chemical reactions (or reaction not using substances potentially harmful to human body and the environment (e.g., halogen-containing substances etc.) as much as possible, and not emitting them as much as possible) has become a very important object. From this aspect, the above-mentioned production method using methylene chloride as an organic solvent is not entirely a preferable production method of bicalutamide. Therefore, the development of a production method of bicalutamide, which is superior in environmental benignity, is desired.<br>
In addition, the above-mentioned method uses m-chloroperbenzoic acid as an oxidizing agent, m-Chloroperbenzoic acid is highly explosive and is not preferable for industrial processes. Furthermore, m-chloroperbenzoic acid is expensive and poses an economic problem.<br>
Accordingly, industrial practice of the above-mentioned method at a large scale gives rise to the problems not only in environmental benignity, but also safety and economic aspect, due to the use of a halogenated organic solvent as the solvent and of m-chloroperbenzoic acid as the oxidizing agent.<br>
At the moment, as a synthetic method of bicalutamide, which is free of the use of m-chloroperbenzoic acid as an oxidizing agent, the method described in, for example, WOOl/00608 is known. According to this method, compound (3) is<br><br>
oxidized with aqueous hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent, in acetic acid or formic acid, for the synthesis of bicalutamide. Thus, this method is considered to be environinentally, economically and industrially superior. In this method, however, synthesis of precursor compound (3) requires many steps (at least 4 steps), which makes this method not an economically and industrially superior synthetic method for the total synthesis of bicalutamide. Furthermore, this method includes steps using a  halogenated solvent (e.g., methylene chloride etc.) for the synthesis of compound (3). Thus, it is difficult to say that this method is sufficiently environmentally conscious.<br>
As a synthetic method of bicalutamide free of use of m-chloroperbenzoic acid as an oxidizing agent, a method described in WO02/24638 is also known. The method described in WO02/24638 includes adding aqueous hydrogen peroxide to compound (3), cooling (e.g., -55°C) the mixture, and adding trifluoroacetic anhydride to the mixture to give bicalutamide. However, this method uses expensive trifluoroacetic anhydride as a reagent, and requires cooling when trifluoroacetic anhydride is added, and is not an economically superior method. Furthermore, because of the corrosive and hygroscopic property of trifluoroacetic anhydride, the method is unsuitable for the Industrial production of bicalutamide.<br>
Accordingly, the develojHnent of an econcaoical and Industrially practical production method of bicalutamide, which Ls superior in environmental benignity and safety, is desired Ln this field.<br>
For efficient granulation of a crystal in the field of the production of pharmaceutical drugs, it is desirable that Che form of the crystal be defined. However, the form of the crystal of bicalutamide is not defined in any of the above-mentioned references, and therefore, those of ordinary skill in<br><br>
the art of the production of pharmaceutical drugs strongly desire provision of bicalutamide crystals having a defined form.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide bicalutamide having a defined crystal form, as well as an economical and industrially practical production method of bicalutamide and a crystal thereof, which is superior in environmental benignity and safety.<br>
As a result of intensive studies by the present inventors in an attempt to solve the above-mentioned problems, they have found that bicalutamide having high purity can be produced in a large amount by reacting a compound of the above-mentioned formula (3) with aqueous hydrogen peroxide, which is an oxidizing agent, using ethyl acetate as a solvent, in the presence of sodium tungstate (or a solvate thereof), phenylphosphonic acid and a phase transfer catalyst. This method is superior in environmental benignity, economic aspect and safety, and is industrially practicable. The present inventors have also found that mono-perphthalic acid as an oxidizing agent prepared from phthalic anhydride and hydrogen peroxide is highly effective as an oxidizing agent for oxidation of olefin to epoxide, and for oxidation of thioether to sulfone, based on which fact they have found production methods of bicalutamide and a crystal thereof, which are mainly based on oxidation reactions and which are capable of finally deriving bicalutamide, which is a sulfone, sequentially via olefin, epoxide and thioether (compound (3)) from a simple starting material, as well as the specific form of the crystal of bicalutamide, which resulted in the completion of the present invention.

In the present invention, the total synthesis of bicalutamide is started using 4-cyano-3-<br>
{trifluoroinethyl)aniline as a starting material. 4-Cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)aniline may be commercially available or may be separately synthesized and used, because its structure is simple (J. Am. Chem. Soc, 76, 1051-1054 (1954); see EP2892).<br><br>
By subjecting 4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)aniline to condensation reaction with methacrylic acid or its reactive derivative (e.g., methacryloyl halide etc., preferably methacryloyl chloride), an olefin compound represented by the above-mentioned formula (1) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as compound (1)) can be obtained, since methacrylic acid and its reactive derivative are extremely economical as commercially available products and can be easily obtained in large amounts, the condensation reaction may be an industrially and economically effective means. This condensation reaction can be carried out according to conventional amide chemistry. In addition, ccanpound (1) can be used for the next reaction without isolation and/or purification.<br>
Step A and Step C are oxidation steps using an oxidizing agent.<br>
In Step A (oxidation of olefin to epoxide) and Step c (oxidation of thioether to sulfone), mono-perphthalic acid can be used as an oxidizing agent for safe and economical production at an industrial scale.<br>
The mono-perphthalic acid can be easily prepared by reacting phthalic anhydride with hydrogen peroxide.<br>
To be specific, mono-perphthalic acid is prepared by mixing phthalic anhydride and hydrogen peroxide in an almost equimolar amount or an amount not less than the equimolar amount in a suitable solvent in the presence or absence of a base. Preferably, a slightly excess amount of hydrogen peroxide is used relative to phthalic anhydride. To be specific, hydrogen peroxide is used in a proportion of 1.0 mol - 1.5 mol, preferably 1.0 mol - 1.3 mol, relative to 1 mol of phthalic anhydride.<br>
Phthalic anhydride is used as a starting material for the synthesis of mono-perphthalic acid, because phthalic anhydride is econcanical, free of hygroscopic property and is easy to<br><br>
handle.<br>
From the aspect of easy handling, hydrogen peroxide to be used is preferably aqueous hydrogen peroxide. The aqueous hydrogen peroxide to be used has a concentration of generally 20% - 50%, preferably 30% - 35%. Aqueous hydrogen peroxide having a concentration of 30% - 35% is preferable, because it is associated with less possibility of explosion and is commercially available and economical.<br>
Examples of the base include sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide and the like. From the economic aspect, sodium carbonate is preferable.<br>
The amount of the base to be used is generally 1.0 mol -1.3 mol, preferably 1.0 mol - 1.2 mol, per 1 mol of phthalic anhydride.<br>
As the solvent to be used, water and the like can be exemplified. Of these, deionized water is preferable because it does not contain metals possibly having a catalytic activity to decompose hydrogen peroxide, and from the aspects of solubility of hydrogen peroxide therein and from the economic aspect.<br>
The amount of the solvent to be used is generally 2 ml -5 ml, preferably 3 ml - 4 ml, per 1 g of phthalic anhydride.<br>
The reaction temperature is generally -5°C to 5°C, preferably -5°C to 0°c.<br>
while the reaction time varies depending on the reagents to be used and the reaction temperature, it is generally 0.5 hr -2.0 hr, preferably 0.5 hr - 0.75 hr.<br>
After the completion of the reaction, the reaction system may be neutralized, as necessary, with an acid such as sulfuric acid (preferably 98% sulfuric acid) and the like, and isolated and/or purified by conventional work-up.<br>
Since mono-perphthalio acid can be prepared by one-pot.<br><br>
it can be used for the subsequent oxidation reaction (i.e., the above-mentioned Step A and step C) without isolation and/or purification, which in turn reduces the total number of steps for the total synthesis of bicalutamide.<br>
In the following. Steps A, B and C are explained in detail. Step A<br>
In Step A, olefin compound (1) is oxidized to derive an epoxy ccanpound represented by the formula (2) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as compound (2)).<br>
When mono-perphthalie acid is used as an oxidizing agent, in Step A, mono-perphthalic acid, which is an oxidizing agent, is added to compound (1) in a suitable reaction solvent.<br>
A reaction solvent suitable for the oxidation reaction in Step A is exemplified by toluene, chlorobenzene, ethyl acetate and the like, of which ethyl acetate is preferable from the aspect of solubility of compound (1) therein.<br>
The amount of the reaction solvent to be used is generally 0.5 ml - 10 ml, preferably 0.7 ml - 5 ml, more preferably 1.0 ml - 5 ml, still more preferably 2 ml - 5 ml, yet still more preferably 2.5 ml - 4 ml, per 1 g of compound<br>
The amount of the mono-perphthalic acid to be used is generally 1.2 mol - 3.5 mol, preferably 1.5 mol - 3.0 mol, more preferably 1.8 mol - 2.5 mol, per 1 mol of compound (1).<br>
As a method for adding mono-perphthalic acid, dropwise addition of mono-perphthalic acid solution is preferable from the aspect of easy addition, safety and operability. When mono-perphthalic acid solution is added dropwise, the solution may be dropwise added in two or more portions.<br>
As a solvent suitable for the preparation of mono-perphthalic acid solution, for example, ethyl acetate, ethers (e.g., diethyl ether etc.) and the like are mentioned, of which<br><br>
ethyl acetate is preferable from the aspect of safety. It is desirable to use the same solvent as the above-mentioned reaction solvent.<br>
The concentration of the mono-perphthalic acid solution to be used for the reaction is generally 10 wt% - 22 wt%, preferably 12 wt% - 19 wt%.<br>
The amount of the solvent to be used for the preparation of mono-perphthalic acid solution is generally 3 ml - 10 ml, preferably 3.5 ml - 7.5 ml, more preferably 3.5 ml - 7 ml, per 1 g of mono-perphthalic acid.<br>
When the mono-perphthalic acid solution is added dropwise, the rate of dropwise addition depends on the concentration of the solution for dropwise addition and tenierature of the solution for dropwise addition or of the solution to \rfaich the mono-perphthalic acid solution is added dropwise, but generally 0.5 ml/min - 4.0 ml/min, 1 ml/min - 4 ml/min, preferably 1.5 ml/min - 3.0 ml/min, per 1 g of compound (1).<br>
When a mono-perphthalic acid solution is added dropwise, the temperature of the solution for dropwise addition is generally 0'='C - 35C, preferably 10°C - 30°C.<br>
When a mono-perphthalic acid solution is added dropwise, the temperature of the solution to rtiich the mono-perphthalic acid solution is added dropwise is generally 20°C - eoC, preferably 40C - 550, more preferably SCc - 55°c.<br>
The reaction temperature is generally 20'C - 600, preferably 45°C - 55°C, more preferably 50°C - 55°C.<br>
While the reaction time varies depending on the reaction temperature and other reaction conditions, it is generally 5 hr - 15 hr, preferably 6 hr - 9 hr.<br>
The progress of the reaction can be confirmed by LC (Liquid Chromatography).<br>
After the reaction is completed, as necessary, the reaction system may be made to be weak basic (e.g., pH s8) with<br><br>
a base such as potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate and the like, and may be isolated and/or purified by a conventional work-up.<br>
It is also possible to use the reaction mixture in the next step without isolation and/or purification of the reaction mixture.<br>
When mono-perphthalic acid is prepared in the absence of a base, mono-perphthalic acid may be prepared from hydrogen peroxide and excess amount of phthalic anhydride, in the reaction system of Step A, at the above-mentioned reaction temperature.<br>
While the presence of a by-product represented by the following formula (A) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as by¬product (A)) can be confirmed by LC, the by-product (A) may be<br><br>
In Scheme 2, the by-product (A) from the above-mentioned oxidation reaction can be mesylated, in the presence of a base, with methanesulfonyl chloride (MsCl) in a suitable solvent, and.<br><br>
via compound (B), converted to compound (2) via ring closure (epoxidation of diol form).<br>
Via compound {B), the by-product (A) can be removed efficiently, and compound (B) can be converted easily to compound (2), as a result of which bicalutamide can be obtained in stable quality and yield.<br>
As a suitable solvent, for example, toluene, THF, ethyl acetate and the like can be mentioned, of which toluene is preferable from the aspect of economic aspect and THF is preferable from the aspect of solubility. In addition, a mixed solvent of the above-mentioned solvents may be used.<br>

The case where hydrogen peroxide is used as an oxidizing agent in Step C is explained in the following.<br>
Bicalutamide can be produced in Step c by reacting compound (3) with aqueous hydrogen peroxide, in the presence of sodium tungstate or a solvate thereof, phenylphosphonic acid and a phase transfer catalyst, in ethyl acetate. To be specific, for example, sodium tungstate or a solvate thereof, phenylphosphonic acid, a phase transfer catalyst and aqueous hydrogen peroxide are charged in a reaction vessel and a solution of compound (3) in ethyl acetate is added thereto. The method for adding a solution of compound (3) in ethyl acetate is not particularly limited, and, for example, dropwise addition, injection and the like are exemplified. A dropwise addition is preferable because the heat of the reaction can be easily removed. The time necessary for the addition is generally 30 min - 5 hr, depending on the reaction scale.<br>
when hydrogen peroxide is used as an oxidizing agent, it is essential that ethyl acetate be used as a solvent. This is because ethyl acetate is economical, resists oxidation, and is free of dioxin upon incineration, and further, makes the oxidation reaction proceed well as compared to other solvents. The amount of ethyl acetate to be used is free of any particular limitation as long as stirring is possible. When the amount is generally not less than one-fold weight, preferably 1 to 20-fold weight/ more preferably 2 to 10-fold weight of compound (3). When it is 2 to 10-fold weight, the reaction proceeds easily and stirring is easy.<br>
The oxidizing agent to be used in Step C is preferably hydrogen peroxide from the aspect of environmental benignity.<br><br>
This is because hydrogen peroxide produces only water as a by¬product after oxidation reaction. Particularly, aqueous hydrogen peroxide is preferable because it is easily handled. Aqueous hydrogen peroxide having a concentration of generally 20 - 50%, preferably 30 - 35%, is used. Aqueous hydrogen peroxide having a concentration of 30 - 35% is preferable, because it is associated with less possibility of explosion and is economical. The amount of use thereof in molar ratio is generally not less than 2.5 relative to compound (3). When it is less than 2.5, the sulfur atom is not sufficiently oxidized and the selectivity toward sulfone or sulfoxide is unpreferably degraded. For production of sulfone with high selectivity, the molar ratio is preferably 3 - 6.<br>
When hydrogen peroxide is used as an oxidizing agent in step C, as a reaction catalyst, a catalyst system of sodium tungstate or a solvate thereof-phenylphosphonic acid-phase transfer catalyst is employed. The amount of each of sodium tungstate or a solvate thereof, phenylphosphonic acid and phase transfer catalyst to be used is generally not less than 0.1 mol%, preferably 0.1 - 10 mol%, more preferably 0.5 - 5 mol%, of compound (3). When the amount of even one of these catalysts to be used is less than 0.1 mol%, the reaction may not be completed or the reaction time may be prolonged, which is unpreferable. It is preferably 0.5 - 5 mol% from the aspect of reaction time and economic aspect.<br>
As sodium tungstate and a solvate thereof, for example, sodium tungstate hydrate is preferable, and as sodium tungstate hydrate, sodium tungstate 10 hydrate, sodium tungstate dihydrate and the like are exemplified, with preference given to sodium tungstate dihydrate.<br>
The phase transfer catalyst is not particularly limited and is exemplified by quaternary ammonium salt (e.g., tetrabutylammonium bromide, benzyltrimethylammonium chloride.<br><br>
tetrabutyXammonium hydroxide and the like), halogenated phosphonium and the like, with preference given to quaternary ammonium salt. Particularly, the use of tetrabutylammonium bromide, benzyltrimethylammoivium chloride or tetrabutylammonium hydroxide is preferable due to easy availability and economic aspect. Particularly, tetrabutylammonium bromide is preferable.<br>
While the reaction temperature is not particularly limited as long as the reaction proceeds, a reaction at the refluxing temperature of ethyl acetate (73 - 76°c at atmospheric pressure) is preferable, because the reaction time can be shortened.<br>
The compound (3) can be also obtained according to the method described in, for example, JP-B-4-32061. Isolation and/or purification of bicalutamide<br>
Bicalutamide can be isolated by a conventional method. For example, after the completion of the reaction, it is quenched, an extract solvent (e.g., organic solvent such as ethyl acetate and the like) is added to the reaction mixture, the mixture is stirred and left standing still. After that, the mixture is partitioned and the obtained extract (organic layer) is washed, dried and concentrated. While the isolated bicalutamide can be purified by a conventional method, a crystal of bicalutamide having a higher purity can be obtained in a high yield by precipitating a crystal of bicalutamide from a specific solvent. The production method of a crystal of bicalutamide is explained in detail in the following. Production method of crystals of bicalutamide<br>

Particularly, when the solvent is ethyl acetate, the solution is preferably concentrated generally to 2 ml - 10 ml, 2 ml - 6 ml, per 1 g of bicalutamide. After concentration, the concentrated solution is preferably maintained at a temperature free of precipitation of the crystal of bicalutamide. The concentrated solution is maintained generally at 40°C  - 80°C, preferably 50°C - 70°C. Particularly, when the solvent is ethyl acetate, the solution is maintained generally at 40°c - 80°c, preferably 50C - 70°c. Step II<br>
In Step II, a hydrocarbon solvent is added as necessary to the solution obtained in step r.<br>
The hydrocarbon solvent to be used in Step II is exemplified by hexane, heptane, petroleum ether and the like, with preference given to hexane and heptane. Of these, heptane is preferable, and n-heptane is particularly preferable.<br>
The temperature of the hydrocarbon solvent to be added is generally 0°C - 50°C, preferably 15C - 30C.<br>
When the hydrocarbon solvent is added, the temperature of the solution obtained in the above-mentioned step I is generally 40°C - 80°c, preferably 50°C - 70°c. Particularly, when the solvent is ethyl acetate, it is 40C - TOC, preferably 50°C - 70°C.<br>
The amount of the hydrocarbon solvent to be used in Step II is generally 1.5 ml - 5 ml, preferably 2 ml - 5 ml, preferably 1.5 ml - 3.5 ml, more preferably 2.5 ml - 35 ml, per 1 g of bicalutamide. Particularly, when the hydrocarbon solvent is heptane, it is generally 1.5 ml - 4.0 ml, preferably 1.5 ml - 3.5 ml, preferably 2.5 ml - 4.0 ml.<br>
In Step II, the rate of addition of the hydrocarbon solvent is generally 1.0 ml/iain - 5.0 ml/min, preferably 1.0<br><br>

During cooling in Step III, a solution containing bicalutamide is preferably stirred and then the vessel is left standing as necessary.<br>
As an example of Steps I-III, when a mixed solvent of ethyl acetate and heptane is used for precipitation of a crystal of bicalutamide, the amount thereof to be used is, for example, 3.5-10 ml/g, preferably 4.5 - 6.5 ml/g, of ethyl acetate relative to compound (3), and, for example, 2-5 ml/g, preferably 2.5 - 4.5 ml/g, of heptane relative to compound (3).<br>
As an example of Step I-III, when a solution containing bicalutamide is prepared by concentration for precipitation of a crystal of bicalutamide, the organic layer (preferably ethyl acetate layer) obtained by isolation is concentrated to the extent free of precipitation of a product. Then, the concentrated solution of bicalutamide (preferably ethyl acetate solution) is cooled. The cooling temperature is not lower than 500 and lower than the reaction temperature, preferably 55°C -70°C. At this point, the crystal starts to precipitate. To this solution is added (preferably dropwise added) heptane at the same temperature, and then the mixture is further cooled<br><br>
(10°C - 40°C, preferably 15°C - 30=0), whereby a highly pure crystal of bicalutamide can be obtained.<br>
By precipitating a crystal of bicalutamide as mentioned above, a crystal of bicalutamide having a high purity (98.0% -99.9%) can be obtained in a high yield (98,50% - 99.99%).<br>
The crystal polymorphism of the crystal of bicalutamide is evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and solid C NMR measurement. In addition, particle size distribution and mean particle size of the crystal of bicalutamide are also measured.
