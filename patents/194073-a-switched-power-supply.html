QUICK-RESET CIRCUIT FOR AUXILIARY POWER SUPPLY<br>
This invention relates to the field of switched mode power supplies for apparatus having a run mode and a standby mode of operation, such as a television receiver. In particular, the invention relates to the field of resetting switched mode power supplies, for example an auxiliary power supply, in such apparatus when changing between the run and standby modes of operation.<br>
In a typical run/standby power supply, for example as used in television receivers, a bridge rectifier and a filter capacitor provide a raw DC voltage (called the B+ voltage, or raw B+), whenever the power supply is coupled to the domestic main. Standby mode loads can be powered directly from the B+ voltage or from another voltage that is always present. Many run mode loads, however, are powered through a voltage regulating supply such as a switched mode supply, that operates only in the run mode. The run mode power supply for certain loads, such as the deflection circuits and high voltage screen loads, typically employ the flyback transformer that powers beam deflection. A separate or auxiliary power supply also can be operated as a switched mode supply and may provide a regulated B+ voltage for the flyback transformer as well as other auxiliary supply voltages.<br>
Projection televisions, for example, have particularly demanding power needs because they have three high power cathode ray tubes (CRTs). An auxiliary power supply is useful to power the convergence amplifiers for the tubes, two such amplifiers generally being required for each CRT. These amplifiers require positive and negative polarity voltages and can dissipate substantial power.<br>
In a switched mode supply, an input DC voltage (such as the B+ voltage in a television) is coupled to one terminal of a primary winding of a transformer and the other terminal of the primary winding is coupled to a switching device, such that current is<br><br>
RCA 88,404<br>
 coupled to the transformer when the switching device conducts.<br>
The switching device is alternately turned on and off during the<br>
run mode of operation, providing alternating currents in<br>
secondary windings of the transformer, which are rectified and<br>
filtered to provide run mode supply voltages.<br>
Regulation of the output voltages is achieved by feedback control provided by, for example, a feedback winding of the transformer. The respective secondary windings are closely coupled, so that load variations on any of the secondary windings are reflected on the feedback winding. The feedback control compares a voltage on the feedback winding with a standard or threshold voltage level, which may be provided by the switching device, and modulates the frequency and/or pulse width at which the switching circuit is turned on and off. The switching device is compensated to render it insensitive to variation of the raw B+ input voltage, while maintaining accurate output voltage levels as current loading varies over a nominal range of power consumption.<br>
The switching device for a power supply as described can be an integrated circuit (IC) power supply controller from the Sanyo STK730 series. This controller includes a FET power switching transistor, an error amplifier and driver, and an over-current protection circuit in a single package. When coupled into a switched mode supply and first turned on, current from the B+ voltage flows to ground through the primary winding of the transformer, the FET and a current sensing resistor. Current increases until the over-current protection circuit in the controller IC is triggered, whereupon the IC controller turns off its FET power transistor. Energy is transferred to the secondary windings of the transformer, where the induced AC current is rectified and charges filter capacitors. After a starting interval of several cycles, the output voltage reaches its regulated level. A threshold comparison circuit provided by the IC controller is coupled to a feedback winding of the transformer and controls the timing of switching by the control IC to maintain the regulated output<br><br>
RCA 88,404<br>
 voltage level. Oscillation stabilizes at a frequency and duty cycle that accommodate the loads coupled to the secondary windings. Many other power supply controllers operate in a similar fashion and may be used instead of the Sanyo STK730 series.<br>
Such an IC controller will attempt to start whenever the raw B+ voltage is present. Other switched circuits control switching between the standby mode and the run mode. In a situation wherein the apparatus is switched quickly and repeatedly between the run and standby modes of operation, it is necessary for the auxiliary power supply to reset quickly so that its output voltages may be approximately equal to their nominal output voltage levels when the apparatus is switched from a standby mode to a run mode. If, for example, the apparatus is shifted from the run mode to the standby mode and then back to the run mode in rapid succession, the run mode output voltages of the auxiliary power supply may be prevented from coming up and attaining their nominal output voltage levels. This would hinder proper operation of the apparatus.<br>
It would be advantageous to control switching between the standby and run modes of the apparatus in a manner that enables the auxiliary power supply to reset quickly, so as not to prevent completion of the startup phase of the auxiliary power supply when the apparatus is shifted from a standby mode to a run mode following a rapid succession of changes in its operational mode.<br>
A switched power supply according to inventive arrangements taught herein provides a quick-reset capability when an apparatus containing the power supply is rapidly switched between run and standby modes of operation. The quick-reset capability enables the power supply to consistently provide output voltages which are within nominal output voltage levels despite rapidly repeated dislocations in the operational mode of the apparatus.<br>
In such a switched power supply, an on/off switch control turns the power supply on and off as the apparatus changes between the standby and run modes of operation. The quick-<br><br>
RCA 88,404<br>
 reset circuit is coupled to the on/off switch control and to a delay circuit which contains a startup delay capacitor that charges when the apparatus is switched from standby mode to run mode. The quick-reset circuit is energized by a transition from the run mode to the standby mode and rapidly discharges the startup delay capacitor upon such transition,<br>
A switched power supply according to the inventive arrangements described herein comprises: a voltage source, a transformer and a switching controller coupled for switched-mode generation of an output supply voltage; a feedback circuit for regulating the switched-mode operation responsive to loading on the output supply voltage; a switching circuit responsive to an on/off signal for turning the power supply on and off by controlling conduction in a conduction path, the power supply being turned on by a conductive condition in the conduction path; a delay circuit responsive to the on/off signal and continuously energized by current after the power supply is turned on; and, a reset circuit responsive to the switching circuit for discharging energy from the delay circuit.<br>
The on/off signal may be a run mode supply voltage generated by another power supply in the apparatus. The voltage source may be an unregulated, rectified mains voltage source,<br>
A voltage provided by the delay circuit may be limited. The delay circuit may comprise: a capacitor; a Zener diode coupled in parallel with the capacitor; and, a resistance coupling the on/off signal to a cathode of the diode. A delay time provided by the delay circuit may be established by the capacitor and the resistance.<br>
The reset circuit may complete discharging of the delay circuit before the on/off signal reaches a minimum level. The reset circuit may comprise a semiconductor switch responsive to the switching circuit for discharging the capacitor.<br>
The above, and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description<br><br>
RCA 88,404<br>
 read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals designate the same elements.<br>

FIGURE 5 is a schematic diagram of an auxiliary power supply having a quick-reset circuit in accordance with inventive arrangements.<br>
FIGURE 1 generally shows an inventive switched mode power supply 10 having a switching controller Ul operable periodically to apply current from a voltage input, for example a raw B+ voltage, to a primary winding W1 of a transformer T1 for variably coupling power to one or more secondary windings W2, W3, W4 and W5 of transformer Tl. The switching controller Ul can comprise, for example, a Sanyo STK730 series controller. Switching controller Ul conducts when a driving voltage, for example the raw B+ voltage, is available on its control input CNTL at pin 4.<br>
The raw B+ input supply voltage is a direct current voltage obtained from the output of a bridge rectifier CR1 filtered by a capacitor C1. The raw B+ voltage is present whenever the power supply 10 is coupled to the domestic mains 22 (i.e., plugged in). However, the power supply 10 only operates in a run mode, and is disabled in a quiescent or standby mode.<br><br>
RCA 88,404<br>
 When power supply 10 is plugged in and is also in the run<br>
mode, the raw B+ voltage is present at the control input CNTL of<br>
switching controller U1, thus enabling switching controller U1 to<br>
conduct a current through the primary winding W1 of transformer<br>
T1. The current flow through winding Wl induces a voltage<br>
across winding W2 of transformer Tl, which voltage is applied to<br>
the control input CNTL through resistor R13 and capacitor C5. The<br>
polarity of winding W2 is such that the voltage induced across<br>
winding W2 keeps switching controller Ul conducting.<br>
Switching controller Ul ceases conducting current through primary winding Wl, or turns off, when the current conducted by switching controller Ul reaches a current limit threshold that is set by. the combination of resistor R14 and capacitor C6. When switching controller Ul ceases conducting, the magnetic field of primary winding Wl collapses, its polarity reverses and the energy contained in primary winding Wl is transferred to windings W4 and W5, which supply power to the +15 V and -15 V, respectively, outputs.<br>
As the energy from windings W4 and W5 becomes exhausted, their magnetic fields collapse and their polarities reverse. In accordance with the polarities of windings W2, W4 and W5, winding W2 provides a positive voltage to pin 4 of switching controller Ul, thereby enabling switching controller Ul to once again conduct current through primary winding Wl until the current limit threshold of switching controller Ul has been reached and switching controller Ul ceases conducting current. Energy is then again transferred from primary winding Wl to windings W4 and W5. This process repeats for several cycles, until the operation of power supply 10 has stabilized.<br>
Feedback winding W3 controls the duty cycle of switching controller U1 after the operation of power supply 10 has stabilized. The voltage developed across feedback winding W3 is compared with an internal reference, equal to approximately -40.5 V, developed by switching controller Ul. The duty cycle of switching controller Ul is modulated such that the voltage<br><br>
RCA 88,404<br>
 developed across feedback winding W3 is maintained approximately equal to -40.5 V. Feedback winding W3 is coupled to the secondary windings W4 and W5 so that load changes are reflected in the voltage developed across feedback winding W3. Thus, feedback winding W3 is also used to regulate the output voltages developed by windings W4 and W5.<br>
Normally, switching from the standby mode to the run mode or vice versa is accomplished under user control via control inputs (not shown) such as an infrared receiver, panel switches or the like. According to an inventive aspect, additional run/standby switching circuits 36 are provided to shift the power supply 10 between the operational run mode and the non-operational standby mode. Switching controller U1 requires a large start-up current. For dependable starting and assistance in developing this drive current, the run/standby switching circuits 36 include a first circuit 38 coupled between the raw B+ voltage input and the control input CNTL, for providing a voltage bias to enable conduction by the switching controller whenever the raw B+ voltage input is present.<br>
In accordance with an inventive arrangement, the drive current bias provided from first circuit 38 can be shunted away to reduce the available drive current to disable the switching controller Ul. The drive current can be shunted to a source of reference potential, for example ground.<br>
The run/standby switching circuits 36 further comprise a fault condition detection circuit .4.2 coupled to at least one of the transformer secondary windings W4 and W5. The circuit 42 senses a fault condition, such as current overloading on the auxiliary power supply, for example by sensing a low voltage threshold on the output coupled to the same or another secondary winding W4 or W5. The circuit 42 generates an output 41 indicative of a fault condition to disable conduction of switching controller Ul by pulling control input CNTL of switching controller Ul to a ground potential, as a means for switching the auxiliary power supply off, as though the apparatus had been changed to<br><br>
RCA 88,404<br>
 the standby mode of operation. In order to make certain that the startup phase of the auxiliary power supply is not prevented by a false detection of a fault condition, due to initial low voltage output levels, a delay circuit 40 inhibits the effect of the output of the fault condition detection circuit 42 for a sufficient period of time for the nominal output voltage levels of the auxiliary power supply to be established.<br>
FIGURES 2 and 3 illustrate in detail different aspect of the inventive arrangements shown generally in FIGURE 1. The same reference numbers are used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or comparable elements. Referring to FIGURE 2, switching controller U1 is coupled in series with primary winding W1 of transformer T1. Switching controller Ul alternately conducts and turns off, for transferring power to the secondary windings W4 and W5, where the resulting AC signal is rectified by diodes D2 and D3 and filtered by capacitors C2 and C3, respectively. The filtered voltages provided on windings W4 and W5 are further filtered by chokes L2 and L3, respectively, to provide operational supply voltages +15 V and -15 V, respectively, for powering loads in the run mode.<br>
The polarities of secondary windings W4 and W5 are opposite that of the primary winding Wl, as shown in FIGURE 2, such that capacitors C2 and C3 are charged when switching controller Ul turns off and the energy stored in the primary winding Wl of transformer Tl is transferred to windings W4 and W5.<br>
According to an inventive aspect, the power supply 10 as shown is arranged to further control the voltage at control input CNTL of switching controller Ul for controlling shifts between run and standby modes. When the device is in standby mode and switching controller Ul is not conducting periodically, the only power going into the power supply 10 is the raw B+ voltage, which is present because the device is coupled to domestic mains 22. It would be possible in controlling run/standby operation to couple and decouple the raw B+ voltage to the switching elements of the<br><br>
RCA 88,404<br>
 power supply 10 using a relay or other switching device powered<br>
from a supplemental low power supply (not shown). However,<br>
according to the invention a more cost effective solution is<br>
obtained by using a signal derived in part from the raw B+ voltage<br>
and in part from the run mode voltages, to reduce the bias on<br>
control input CNTL to switching controller U1, namely to bring the<br>
voltage on the control input to near ground to hold switching<br>
controller Ul off until normal bias is restored.<br>
Thus, a voltage divider comprising resistors Rl, R2, R3 and R4 is coupled between the raw B+ voltage and ground, and the junction J1 of the voltage divider is coupled to the base of a switching transistor Q2, having its collector coupled to the control input and its emitter grounded. When the raw B+ voltage is present, control input CNTL is pulled to near ground by conduction of transistor Q2. When the power supply 10 is first coupled to the mains, it is held in standby mode.<br>
The invention is advantageously applied to an auxiliary power supply such as the auxiliary supply of a television for powering run mode loads such as convergence amplifiers. For switching into the run mode, the inventive power supply senses the presence of a run mode supply voltage developed from a source other than the secondary windings of transformer Tl. This run mode supply voltage is compared to a threshold level, and when the threshold level is passed, transistor Q2 is turned off, permitting the bias on control input CNTL of switching controller Ul to return to normal and permit operation of the auxiliary power supply in the run mode, namely under feedback control by feedback winding W3 of transformer Tl. For example, the +23 V supply that is developed by the run mode operation of the deflection and other circuits in a television can be used for this purpose.<br>
Referring to FIGUEIE 2, a differential pair of PNP transistors Q3 and Q4 have their emitters coupled to the run mode supply voltage by resistor R5, and differentially compare the level of the run mode supply voltage, via the voltage divider of resistors R6<br><br>
RCA 88,404<br>
10 and R7 on the base of transistor Q3, with a reference voltage of +8.2 V provided by Zener diode Z3 on the base of transistor Q4. When the run mode supply exceeds a level determined by the ratio of resistances in the voltage divider, transistor Q4 conducts and switches on optocoupler U3. The phototransistor of optocoupler U3 grounds the base of transistor Q2, which ceases conducting, thereby permitting normal bias on control input CNTL of switching controller Ul. Operation of the power supply 10 then commences in the run mode responsive to the voltages on the secondary windings W2 and W3 of transformer Tl.<br>
Another inventive embodiment is shown in FIGURE 3, and includes a latching circuit that has the additional function of detecting current overload conditions, when in the run mode, for switching the power supply 10 into the standby mode. Current overloading causes the output voltage level to drop below nominal, because in overcurrent conditions the overcurrent protection circuits of switching controller Ul turn switching controller Ul off before sufficient power has been coupled through the power supply 10 to maintain the nominal output voltage level. This method of current limiting is less than optimal for powering loads such as the digital convergence amplifiers of a projection television. For such loads, it is advantageous if the power supply 10 can be turned off when an overcurrent condition occurs, instead of attempting to supply current to the loads at reduced voltage. According to the invention, this function is achieved in a manner that interfaces with the circuits controlling switching between the run and standby modes as in FIGURE 2.<br>
In FIGURE 3, control for switching from standby to run mode is provided in part by the run mode supply voltage, such as the +23 V run supply, passing a predetermined voltage as determined by the differential transistor pair Q3 and Q4, which provide current to the LED of optocoupler U3. The phototransistor of optocoupler U3 then turns off transistor Q2 and permits operation of switching controller Ul. Resistors Rl, R2, R3 and R4 provide bias to transistor Q2 at junction Jl from the raw B+ supply voltage.<br><br>
RCA 88,404<br>
 In comparison to the embodiment of FIGURE 2, in which the cathode of the LED in optocoupler U3 is grounded, according to FIGURE 3, the current through the LED charges a capacitor C4, through the base of a PNP transistor Q5.<br>
Capacitor C4 provides for a delay upon first switching from the standby mode into the run mode, in which the power supply 10 can start up. When the supply 10 is running and the regulated voltage, in this case nominally +15 V, exceeds approximately + 10V, Zener diode Z4 conducts through resistors R8 and R9, and turns on transistor Q6. The current from optocoupler U3 is then shunted to ground through transistor Q6 and capacitor C4 stops charging. Transistor Q5 is then off and capacitor C4 cannot discharge through either transistor Q5 or through diode D6, which is coupled to the +23 V run mode supply and is reverse biased. <br>
In the event that the +15 V output voltage falls below the level needed to cause Zener diode Z4 to conduct, especially in the case of a current overload on secondary winding W4, transistor Q6 turns off due to insufficient base drive. With transistor Q6 off, capacitor C4 can charge from the current through optocoupler U3. When the charge on capacitor C4 reaches approximately +10 V, transistor Q5 turns off, and there is no path for the current through optocoupler U3. In that case, although differential transistors Q3 and Q4 still detect the presence of the +23 V run supply, no current is conducted by the phototransistor of optocoupler U3. The raw B+ supply turns on transistor Q2 due to the voltage divider formed at junction Jl by resistors Rl, R2, R3 and R4. The control input CNTL of switching controller Ul is pulled low. The power supply 10 shuts off, protecting the loads coupled to the outputs. Thus, unlike a power limiting solution wherein the current limiting circuits of the switching controller reduce the output voltage below nominal but continue to supply power, the inventive circuit as described switches off the power supply 10 in overcurrent conditions. This is accomplished using the run/standby circuits driven from the raw B+ power supply,<br><br>
RCA 88,404<br>
 providing a current overload protective function with a minimum<br>
of parts and complexity.<br>
As illustrated in FIGURES 1 and 3, fault condition detection circuit 42 is utilized to detect current overload conditions on the + 15 V output of power supply 10. Detection of overload conditions on the -15 V output is complicated by the fact that exclusively positive-polarity biasing voltages, for example raw B+, are used in power supply 10.<br>
An additional inventive arrangement, shown in FIGURE 4, advantageously and elegantly provides for detection of current overload conditions on the -15 V output in the absence of negative-polarity bias voltages. Detection of a current overload condition on the -15 V output, when in the run mode, causes the power supply 10 to be switched into the standby mode. In FIGURE 4, the negative supply voltage overload detection circuit-43 is coupled between the +15 V and -15 V outputs of power supply 10. The Zener diode Z6 is biased between the +15 V and -15 V outputs of the power supply 10, such that the base of transistor Q8 has a bias voltage that is equal to approximately -2 V when the -15 V output is nominally loaded. The Zener diode Z6 thus provides a level-shifting mechanism, or a dc offset, that enables the -15 V output to be compared against a positive reference voltage, which in this embodiment is the turn-on voltage of the base-emitter junction of transistor Q8, for detecting a current overload condition.<br>
If, in response to a current overload condition, the -15 V output begins to drop toward a ground potential, the voltage at the base of transistor Q8 will also tend to move toward ground. Eventually, if the current overload condition persists and the -15 V output consequently reaches a predetermined threshold voltage level, the voltage at the base of transistor Q8 will become positive and will eventually become high enough, for example approximately 0.7 V, to turn on transistor Q8 to signal a current overload condition. Unlike fault condition detection circuit 42, where a current overload condition is signaled by a change in the<br><br>
RCA 88,404<br>
 conductive state of Zener diode Z4, Zener diode Z6 remains in a conductive state when a current overload condition is signaled by transistor Q8. The desired threshold level can be selected by an appropriate choice of the breakdown voltage of Zener diode Z6.<br>
When transistor Q8 turns on, current is drawn from the base of transistor Q6, thereby turning transistor Q6 off. Thus, similarly to the detection of an overcurrent condition on the +15 V output, with transistor Q6 off, capacitor C4 can charge from the current through optocoupler U3. When the charge on capacitor C4 reaches approximately +10 V, transistor Q5 turns off, and there is no path for the current through optocoupler U3. In that case, although differential transistors Q3 and Q4 still detect the presence of the +23 V run supply, no current is conducted by the phototransistor of optocoupler U3. The raw B+ supply turns on transistor Q2 due to the voltage divider formed at junction Jl by resistors Rl, R2, R3 and R4. The control input CNTL of switching controller Ul is pulled low. The power supply 10 shuts off, protecting the loads coupled to the outputs.<br>
When the +23 V run supply voltage drops, capacitor C4 is discharged through diode D6, which otherwise would be reverse biased by the presence of the +23 V run supply. Once capacitor C4 has discharged, the power supply 10 can be restarted unless there is still an overload condition on the output that prevents development of a sufficient output voltage to turn on transistor Q6 during the delay time in which the charge on capacitor C4 can rise to a sufficient voltage to turn off transistor Q5.<br>
If capacitor C4 is not allowed enough time to fully discharge, for example if switched mode power supply 10 is shifted from the run mode to the standby mode and then back to the run mode in rapid succession, transistor Q5 will remain off. The run mode output voltages will thus be prevented from coming up and attaining their nominal output voltage levels.<br>
A further inventive embodiment shown in FIGURE 5 provides a quick-reset circuit 50 for rapidly discharging capacitor C4 when the +23 V run supply voltage drops. According to the<br><br>
RCA 88,404<br>
 invention, this function is achieved in a manner that interfaces with the circuits controlling switching between the run and standby modes as in FIGURE 2.<br>
In FIGURE 5, the delay circuit 40 has a Zener diode Z5 in parallel with capacitor C4. When the +23 V run supply voltage comes up, capacitor C4 charges through resistor R10 to provide the delay time for the run mode output voltages to stabilize at approximately their nominal output voltage levels. Zener diode Z5 clamps the voltage across capacitor C4 to approximately +10 V to prevent damage to the base-emitter junctions of transistors Q8 and Q9, which are arranged in a Darlington configuration.<br>
Once power supply 10 is in the run mode, transistor Q4 and the diode of optocoupler U3 conduct current, in a manner similar to the embodiment shown in FIGURE 3. Unlike the embodiment in FIGURE 3, however, this current is not used to charge capacitor C4. The arrangement of transistors Q8 and Q9 in a Darlington configuration results in only a minimal current flow in the base of transistor Q9. Thus, the charging rate of capacitor C4, and the delay time caused thereby, is determined exclusively by the time constant formed by resistor R10 and capacitor C4. This advantageously eliminates any variation in the charging rate of capacitor C4 due to the current amplification factor, or beta, of transistor Q5 in FIGURE 3 or the Darlington arrangement of transistors Q8 and Q9 in FIGURE 5.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 5. when power supply 10 is shifted into the standby mode, the +23 V run supply voltage starts to drop. As the run supply voltage drops below a level determined by the ratio of resistances in the voltage divider of resistances R6 and R7, current flow is redirected from transistor Q4 to transistor Q3. The current flowing through transistor Q3 establishes a voltage across resistor Rll, which voltage biases reset transistor Q7 on. Capacitor C4 is thereby rapidly discharged to ground through resistor R12 and reset transistor Q7 before the +23 V run voltage has completely decayed.<br><br>

Run/standby switching including switching to standby upon excessive current loading are provided in a switched mode power supply useful as an auxiliary power supply in a television. A switching controller IC (U1) is coupled between a primary transformer winding (W1) on the rectified raw B+ (RAW B+) input voltage and. ground. A switching transistor (Q2) is coupled to the control input of the controller and is biased by the raw B+ input voltage for pulling down the control input (CNTL). A run/standby control circuit (R5, R6, R7, Q3, Q4, Z3, U3) and an overcurrent protective circuit disable the switching transistor during run mode operation and enable the switching transistor upon an overcurrent fault. The switched-mode power supply is further provided with a quick-reset capability (Q7, Rll, R12) to enable the power supply to consistently provide output voltages which are within nominal output voltage levels despite rapidly repeated dislocations in the operational mode of the apparatus.<br></td>
