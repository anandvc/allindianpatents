DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS One illustrative example of the present techniques mvolves a mobile station which includes one or more processors, a wireless transceiver coupled to the one or more processors, and a user interface which usings a visual display and a plurality of keys The wireless transceiver is operative to receive a message, such as an e-mail message, which usings a telephone number string When the message is visually displayed m the visual display, a hyperlink for the telephone number string m the message is created The hyperlink for the telephone number string is highlighted when selected by an end user during the visual displaying of the message In response to a single depression of a key of the user interface while the hyperlink is selected, a telephone call to the telephone number string is initiated through the wireless communication network The single depression of the key may be made immediately following the selection of the hyperlink without any intervening key depressions Additional call initiation techniques are provided in combination with this technique to provide a flexible and easy-to-use interface<br>
FIG 1 is a block diagram of a communication system 100 which usings a mobile station 102 which commumcates through a wireless communication network 104 In the embodiment of FIG 1, wireless network 104 is configured m accordance with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and a Global Systems for Mobile (GSM) technologies, however, any suitable type of network communication protocols may be utilized For example, the network may be based on code division multiple access (CDMA) or other suitable technologies As another example, the network may be based on an Integrated Dispatch Enhanced Network (iDEN) which is a high-capacity digital trunked radio system providing integrated voice and data services<br>
Mobile station 102, which is one type of mobile communication device, preferably includes a visual display 112, a keyboard 114, and perhaps one or more auxiliary user interfaces (UI) 116, each of which are coupled to a controller 106 Controller 106 is also coupled to radio frequency (RF) transceiver circuitry 108 and an antenna 110 Typically, controller 106 is embodied as a central processmg unit (CPU) which runs operating system software m a memory component (not shown) Controller 106 will normally control overall operation of mobile station 102, whereas<br>
signal processing operations associated with communication functions are typically performed in RF transceiver circuitry 108 Controller 106 interfaces with device display 112 to display received information, stored information, user inputs, and the like Keyboard 114, which may be a telephone type keypad or full alphanumeric keyboard, is normally provided for entering data for storage in mobile station 102, information for transmission to network 104, a telephone number to place a telephone call, commands to be executed on mobile station 102, and possibly other or different user mputs<br>
Mobile station 102 sends communication signals to and receives communication signals from network 104 over a wireless link via antenna 110 RF transceiver circuitry 108 performs functions similar to those of station 118 and base station controller 120, including for example modulation/demodulation and possibly encoding/decoding and encryption/decryption It is also contemplated that RF transceiver circuitry 108 may perform certain functions m addition to those performed by base station controller 120 It will be apparent to those skilled m art that RF transceiver circuitry 108 will be adapted to particular wireless network or networks in which mobile station 102 is intended to operate<br>
Mobile station 102 includes a battery interface 134 for receivmg one or more rechargeable batteries 132 Battery 132 provides electrical power to electrical circuitry in mobile station 102, and battery interface 132 provides for a mechanical and electrical connection for battery 132 Battery interface 132 is coupled to a regulator 136 which regulates power to the device When mobile station 102 is fully operational, an RF transmitter of RF transceiver circuitry 108 is typically keyed or turned on only when it is sending to network, and is otherwise turned off to conserve resources Similarly, an RF receiver of RF transceiver circuitry 108 is typically penodically turned off to conserve power until it is needed to receive signals or information (if at all) during designated tune periods<br>
Mobile station 102 operates using a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) 140 which is connected to or inserted m mobile station 102 at a SIM interface 142   SIM 140 is one type of a conventional "smart card" used to identify an end user (or subscriber) of mobile station 102 and to personalize the device, among other things Without   SIM   140,   the   mobile   station  terminal   is   not  fully  operational   for<br>
communication through wireless network 104 By inserting SIM 140 into mobile station 102, an end user can have access to any and all of his/her subscribed services SIM 140 generally usings a processor and memory for storing information Since SIM 140 is coupled to SIM interface 142, it is coupled to controller 106 through communication lmes 144 In order to identify the subscnber, SIM 140 contains some user parameters such as an International Mobile Subscnber Identity (IMSI) An advantage of using SIM 140 is that end users are not necessanly bound by any single physical mobile station SIM 140 may store additional user information for the mobile station as well, including datebook (or calendar) information and recent call information<br>
Mobile station 102 may consist of a single unit, such as a data communication device, a cellular telephone, a multiple-function communication device with data and voice communication capabilities, a personal digital assistant (PDA) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer incorporating an internal modem Alternatively, mobile station 102 may be a multiple-module unit comprising a plurality of separate components, including but m no way limited to a computer or other device connected to a wireless modem In particular, for example, in the mobile station block diagram of FIG 1, RF transceiver circuitry 108 and antenna 110 may be implemented as a radio modem unit that may be inserted into a port on a laptop computer In this case, the laptop computer would using display 112, keyboard 114, one or more auxiliary UIs 116, and controller 106 embodied as the computer's CPU It is also contemplated that a computer or other equipment not normally capable of wireless communication may be adapted to connect to and effectively assume control of RP transceiver circuitry 108 and antenna 110 of a single-unit device such as one of those descnbed above Such a mobile station 102 may have a more particular implementation as descnbed later m relation to mobile station 202 of FIG 2<br>
Mobile station 102 communicates m and through wireless communication network 104 In the embodiment of FIG 1, wireless network 104 is configured in accordance with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and a Global Systems for Mobile (GSM) technologies Wireless network 104 includes a base station controller (BSC) 120 with an associated tower station 118, a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 122, a Home Location Register (HLR) 132, a Serving General Packet Radio Service<br>
(GPRS) Support Node (SGSN) 126, and a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 128 MSC 122 is coupled to BSC 120 and to a landline network, such as a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 124 SGSN 126 is coupled to BSC 120 and to GGSN 128, which is m turn coupled to a public or private data network 130 (such as the Internet)  HLR 132 is coupled to MSC 122, SGSN 126, and GGSN 128<br>
Station 118 is a transceiver station, and station 118 and BSC 120 are together referred to herein as the transceiver equipment This fixed transceiver equipment provides wireless network coverage for a particular coverage area commonly referred to as a "cell" The transceiver equipment transmits commumcation signals to and receives commumcation signals from mobile stations within its cell via station 118 The transceiver equipment normally performs such functions as modulation and possibly encodmg and/or encryption of signals to be transmitted to the mobile station m accordance with particular, usually predetermined, commumcation protocols and parameters, under control of its controller The transceiver equipment similarly demodulates and possibly decodes and decrypts, if necessary, any commumcation signals received from mobile station 102 within its cell Commumcation protocols and parameters may vary between different networks For example, one network may employ a different modulation scheme and operate at different frequencies than other networks<br>
The wireless link shown m commumcation system 100 of FIG 1 represents one or more different channels, typically different radio frequency (RF) channels, and associated protocols used between wireless network 104 and mobile station 102 Those skilled m art will appreciate that a wireless network m actual practice may using hundreds of cells, each served by a station 118 (le or station sector), depending upon desired overall expanse of network coverage All pertinent components may be connected by multiple switches and routers (not shown), controlled by multiple network controllers<br>
For all mobile station's 102 registered with a network operator, permanent data (such as mobile station 102 user's profile) as well as temporary data (such as mobile station's 102 current location) are stored m HLR 132 In case of a voice call to mobile station 102, HLR 132 is queried to determine the current location of mobile station 102    A Visitor Location Register (VLR) of MSC 122 is responsible for a<br>
group of location areas and stores the data of those mobile stations that are currently m its area of responsibility This usings parts of the permanent mobile station data that have been transmitted from HLR 132 to the VLR for faster access However, the VLR of MSC 122 may also assign and store local data, such as temporary identifications Optionally, the VLR of MSC 122 can be enhanced for more efficient co-ordination of GPRS and non-GPRS services and functionality (e g paging for circuit-switched calls which can be performed more efficiently via SGSN 126, and combmed GPRS and non-GPRS location updates)<br>
Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 126 is at the same hierarchical level as MSC 122 and keeps track of the individual locations of mobile stations SGSN 126 also performs security functions and access control Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 128 provides mterworking with external packet-switched networks and is connected with SGSNs (such as SGSN 126) via an IP-based GPRS backbone network SGSN 126 performs authentication and cipher setting procedures based on the same algorithms, keys, and criteria as in existing GSM In conventional operation, cell selection may be performed autonomously by mobile station 102 or by the fixed transceiver equipment instructing mobile station 102 to select a particular cell Mobile station 102 informs wireless network 104 when it reselects another cell or group of cells, known as a routing area<br>
In order to access GPRS services, mobile station 102 first makes its presence known to wireless network 104 by performing what is known as a GPRS "attach" This operation establishes a logical link between mobile station 102 and SGSN 126 and makes mobile station 102 available to receive, for example, pages via SGSN, notifications of incoming data, or SMS messages over GPRS In order to send and receive GPRS data, mobile station 102 assists in activatmg the packet data address that it wants to use This operation makes mobile station 102 known to GGSN 128, lnterworking with external data networks can thereafter commence User data may be transferred transparently between mobile station 102 and the external data networks using, for example, encapsulation and tunneling Data packets are equipped with GPRS-specific protocol information and transferred between mobile station 102 and GGSN 128<br>
FIG 2 is a detailed block diagram of a preferred mobile station 202 Mobile station 202 is preferably a two-way commumcation device having at least voice and advanced data commumcation capabilities, including the capability to communicate with other computer systems Dependmg on the functionality provided by mobile station 202, it may be referred to as a data messaging device, a two-way pager, a cellular telephone with data messagmg capabilities, a wireless Internet appliance, or a data commumcation device (with or without telephony capabilities) Mobile station 202 may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver stations 200 within its geographic coverage area<br>
Mobile station 202 will normally incorporate a commumcation subsystem 211, which usings a receiver 212, a transmitter 214, and associated components, such as one or more (preferably embedded or internal) antenna elements 216 and 218, local oscillators (LOs) 213, and a processmg module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) 220 Commumcation subsystem 211 is analogous to RF transceiver circuitry 108 and antenna 110 shown m FIG 1 As will be apparent to those skilled m field of communications, particular design of commumcation subsystem 211 depends on the commumcation network in which mobile station 202 is mtended to operate<br>
Mobile station 202 may send and receive commumcation signals over the network after required network registration or activation procedures have been completed Signals received by antenna 216 through the network are input to receiver 212, which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, and like, and m example shown in FIG 2, analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion A/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex commumcation functions such as demodulation and decodmg to be performed in DSP 220 In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encodmg, for example, by DSP 220 These DSP-processed signals are mput to transmitter 214 for digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission over commumcation network via antenna 218 DSP 220 not only processes commumcation signals, but also provides for receiver and transmitter control For example, the gams applied to commumcation signals in receiver 212 and transmitter<br>
214 may be adaphvely controlled through automatic gam control algorithms implemented m DSP 220      /<br>
Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of mobile station 202, and therefore mobile station 202 requires a Subscriber Identity Module or "SIM" card 262 to be inserted m a SIM mterface 264 m order to operate in the network SIM 262 usings those features described m relation to FIG 1 Mobile station 202 is a battery-powered device so it also usings a battery mterface 254 for receivmg one or more rechargeable batteries 256 Such a battery 256 provides electrical power to most if not all electrical circuitry m mobile station 202, and battery mterface 254 provides for a mechanical and electrical connection for it The battery mterface 254 is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to all of the circuitry<br>
Mobile station 202 usings a microprocessor 238 (which is one implementation of controller 106 of FIG 1) which controls overall operation of mobile station 202 Communication functions, including at least data and voice communications, are performed through communication subsystem 211 Microprocessor 238 also interacts with additional device subsystems such as a display 222, a flash memory 224, a random access memory (RAM) 226, auxiliary input/output (I/O) subsystems 228, a serial port 230, a keyboard 232, a speaker 234, a microphone 236, a short-range communications subsystem 240, and any other device subsystems generally designated at 242 Some of the subsystems shown m FIG 2 perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide "resident" or on-device functions Notably, some subsystems, such as keyboard 232 and display 222, for example, may be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over a communication network, and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list Operating system software used by microprocessor 238 is preferably stored m a persistent store such as flash memory 224, which may alternatively be a read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage element (not shown) Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the operating system, specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded mto a volatile store such as RAM 226<br>
Microprocessor 238, in addition to its operating system functions, preferably enables execution of software applications on mobile station 202   A predetermined<br><br>
set of applications which control basic device operations, including at least data and voice communication applications, will normally be installed on mobile station 202 during its manufacture This also includes the software for executing the user interface techniques of the present application A preferred application which is loaded onto mobile station 202 may be a personal information manager (PIM) application having the ability to organize and manage data items relating to e-mil messages and voicemail messages, as well as calendar data Naturally, one or more memory stores are available on mobile station 202 and SIM 262 to facilitate storage of PIM data items and other information<br>
The PIM application preferably has the ability to send and receive data items via the wireless network In a preferred embodiment, PIM data items are seamlessly integrated, synchronized, and updated via the wireless network, with the mobile station user's corresponding data items stored and/or associated with a host computer system thereby creating a mirrored host computer on mobile station 202 with respect to such items This is especially advantageous where the host computer system is the mobile station user's office computer system Additional applications may also be loaded onto mobile station 202 through network, an auxiliary I/O subsystem 228, serial port 230, short-range communications subsystem 240, or any other suitable subsystem 242, and installed by a user in RAM 226 or preferably a non-volatile store (not shown) for execution by microprocessor 238<br>
In a data communication mode, a received signal such as a text message (e g a short message service or SMS message), an e-mail message, or web page download will be processed by communication subsystem 211 and input to microprocessor 238 Microprocessor 238 will preferably further process the signal for output to display 222 or alternatively to auxiliary I/O device 228 A user of mobile station 202 may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, for example, using keyboard 232 in conjunction with display 222 and possibly auxiliary I/O device 228 Keyboard 232 is preferably a complete alphanumeric keyboard and/or telephone-type keypad These composed items may be transmitted over a communication network through communication subsystem 211<br>
For voice communications, the overall operation of mobile station 202 is substantially similar, except that the received signals would be output to speaker 234<br>
and signals for transmission would be generated by microphone 236 Alternative voice or audio I/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on mobile station 202 Although voice or audio signal output is preferably accomplished primarily through speaker 234, display 222 may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information, as some examples<br>
Serial port 230 in FIG 2 is normally implemented m a personal digital assistant (PDA)-type communication device for which synchronization with a user's desktop computer is a desirable, albeit optional, component Serial port 230 enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of mobile station 202 by providmg for information or software downloads to mobile station 202 other than through a wireless communication network The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto mobile station 202 through a direct and thus reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication<br>
Short-range communications subsystem 240 of FIG 2 is an additional optional component which provides for communication between mobile station 202 and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices For example, subsystem 240 may using an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a Bluetooth™ communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices Bluetooth™ is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc<br>
FIG 3 is a visual illustration of a front side of an exemplary mobile station 202 which may be used for the present user mterface techniques Mobile station 202 of FIG 3 has a housing 302 which contams the electronic circuitry and components shown and described in relation to FIGs 1-2 Housing 302 of mobile station 202 usings a user mterface having visual display 222 and keypad 232 with a plurality of keys as generally earlier shown and described m relation to FIG 2 As will be revealed m more detail in relation to FIGs 5-8, visual display 222 is used to visually display information and messages for the end user As shown m FIG 3, the plurality of keys of keypad 232 using a plurality of telephone digit keys (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, *, and #) as well as control keys mcludmg a SEND key 308 (having a telephone<br>
handset icon inscnbed thereon) and an END key 310 (having a telephone handset hang-up icon inscnbed thereon) SEND and END keys 308 and 310 are mechamcal switches of the mobile station which are detectable at switch inputs of the mobile station In general, SEND key 308 is used by the end user for initiating a telephone call from mobile station 202 through the wireless network, and END key 310 is used by the end user for terminating the telephone call Note that both SEND and END keys 308 and 310 are earned and exposed on a front side of housing 302 SEND key 308 may be alternatively designated as an ENTER key, an OK key, a START key, an ACCEPT key, etc, similarly, END key 310 may be alternatively designated as a STOP key, a NO key, a DECLINE key, etc Note that SEND and END keys 308 and 310 may alternatively be visual objects which are displayed in visual display 222 and detectable to the touch if visual display 222 is a touch screen display or other similar mput device<br>
Given the relatively large size of visually displayed information and the compact size of visual display 222, information and messages are typically only partially presented m the limited view of visual display 222 at any given moment Thus, mobile station 202 of FIG 3 also usings an information viewing/selection mechanism for use with visual display 222 In the present embodiment, the information viewing/selection mechanism of mobile station 202 is a scrollwheel 312 Scrollwheel 312 is positioned on a nght hand side of housing 302 Scrollwheel 312 generally usings a circular disc which is rotable about a fixed axis of housing 302, and may be rotated by the end user's mdex finger or thumb See the directions mdicated by a rotation arrow 314 of scrollwheel 312 shown m FIG 3 When the information or message is being partially displayed, an upwards rotation of scrollwheel 312 causes an upwards scrolling such that visual display 222 presents viewmg of an upper portion of the information or message Similarly, a downwards rotation of scrollwheel 312 causes a downwards scrolling such that visual display 222 presents viewmg of a lower portion of the information or message Note also that scrollwheel 312 is mounted along a fixed lmear axis such that the end user can depress scrollwheel 312 inwards toward housing 312 (eg with the end user's mdex finger or thumb) for selection of information See the directions mdicated by an arrow 316 of scrollwheel 312 shown in FIG 3<br>
A more detailed mechamsm for scroll wheel 312 is now descnbed m relation to FIGs 9 and 10 Scrollwheel 312 of FIGs 9-10 is shown connected to and rotatable about a body assembly 910 Body assembly 910 may be connected to or be part of a slide assembly 920 Slide assembly 920 allows the entirety of scrollwheel 312 and body assembly 910 to move freely laterally 316 with respect to the handheld device Lateral scrollwheel movement 316 is defined as movement along a plane normal to the rotational axis of scrollwheel 312 To control this lateral movement 312, slide assembly 920 may be connected to a control mechamsm such as a cam mechamsm 930 with a cam 931, or alternatively a level mechamsm, a solenoid mechamsm, or some other actuatmg means Cam mechamsm 930 is connected to a cam controller 940 (FIG 10 only) responsible for controlling a lateral position of scrollwheel 312 As cam 931 connected to cam mechamsm 930 and slide assembly 920 moves, scrollwheel 312 and body assembly 910 accordmgly move laterally Such lateral movement inwards toward the housing is detectable by the processor of the mobile station as a switch input (actuation or depression of the scrollwheel key)<br>
Although scrollwheel 312 of FIGs 3, 9, and 10 has been shown and descnbed as the preferred mechamsm for use m viewing and selecting visually displayed information, any suitable viewing/selection mechamsm may be utilized for the present user interface techniques to be descnbed, such as UP and DOWN keys, a mouse and cursor mechamsm, or a touch screen display mechanism<br>
FIG 4 is a flowchart for describing a user interface method of initiating telephone calls from a mobile station of the present application The method may be performed with use of a mobile station operating m the wireless network as descnbed m relation to FIGs 1-3 In combination with the flowchart of FIG 4, reference will be made to the visual illustrations of the mobile station in FIGs 5-10 A computer program product for the mobile station may using computer instructions stored on a storage medium (memory, a floppy disk or CD-ROM) which are wntten m accordance with the descnbed logic of this method<br>
Beginning at a start block 402 of FIG 4 ("Start A"), a message is received through a wireless receiver of the mobile station and displayed in a visual display (step 404 of FIG 4) The message may be an electronic mail (e-mail) message or information of a web page, as examples    The message may using a telephone<br>
number string in a conventional telephone number format For example, the telephone number string may be "888 - 2121" which is a suitable telephone number format for the U S or Canada This telephone number string is part of the information or message entered by the author of the message, and is typically located at or near an end or the message Note that this message is selected by the end user from a plurality of previously received messages for visual display When the message is visually displayed, a processor of the mobile station scans to identify any telephone number strmgs in the message (step 406 of FIG 4) If a telephone number string is identified m the message, the processor creates a hyperlink for the telephone number string (step 408 of FIG 4) The hyperlink for the telephone number string is appropriately identified as such m the visually displayed message, such as by underlining, marking, or otherwise emphasizmg the telephone number string m the visual display of information<br>
An example of a mobile station at step 408 of FIG 4 is shown in FIG 5 A message 502 which is an e-mail message is displayed in visual display 222 of mobile station 202 This message 502 is indicated as being sent to joe@nm com (the end user of mobile station 202) from "Fred" having a telephone number of "888 - 2121" as provided at a bottom of message 502 The author (I e Fred) of this message 502 entered the telephone number as part of the text of his message In response to a viewing of message 502 by "Fred", a hyperlink 506 was created for the telephone number string "888 - 2121", which is indicated by the underlining of the telephone number string A cursor or position marker 504 is provided at a selected location in message 502 As shown in FIG 5, cursor or position marker 504 is left at an end of the recipient's e-mail address joe@nm com<br>
When message 502 is displayed, the end user may scroll through message 502 using a suitable viewing/selection mechanism of mobile station 202 Such scrolling moves the cursor or position marker 504 to a different location within message 502 Preferably, the viewing/selection mechamsm used by the end user is a scrollwheel located on a side of the housing of the mobile station (e g see earlier discussion regarding FIGs 3, 9, and 10) Referring back to the flowchart of FIG 4, if the cursor or position marker is positioned by the end user over the hyperlink for the telephone number string (step 410 of FIG   4), the processor causes the hyperlink to be<br>
highlighted, marked, or otherwise emphasized in the visual display by the end user (step 412 of FIG 4) The contmuing example of the mobile station at step 412 of FIG 4 is shown in FIG 6 Hyperlink 506 is shown as being highlighted or marked in response to the end user's selection of this information using scrollwheel 312<br>
Referring back to the flowchart of FIG 4, if the scrollwheel of the mobile station is depressed laterally while the hyperlink is selected (highhghted) (step 414 of FIG 4), a list of functions for the telephone number string are visually displayed adjacent the message (step 422 of FIG 4) A selected function from the list of functions may then be received and highlighted in the visual display by the mobile station (step 424 of FIG 4) As shown m FIG 7 for the contmumg example, a list 702 of functions which are displayed in visual display 222 may be in the form of a pull-down menu The list 702 may using functions such as "Copy", "Select", "Clear Field", "Save Draft" "Call 888-2121", and "SMS 888-2121", etc as shown SMS is short for Short Message Service for sending of SMS messages By rotating scrollwheel 312, the end user may scroll through the list 702 of functions to select one of them In FIG 7, it is shown that "SMS 888-2121" is selected from list 702 from the end user's rotation of scrollwheel 312<br>
Referring again back to the flowchart of FIG 4, the mobile station identifies whether the scrollwheel is depressed during the selection of one of the functions in the list (step 426 of FIG 4) If so, and a function other than a telephone call function was selected, then the mobile station processes this other selected function (step 428 of FIG 4) For example, this other function may be an initiation of an SMS message to the telephone number (e g see FIG 7) If the mobile station identifies that the scrollwheel is depressed during the selection of the telephone call function at step 426, however, then the mobile station initiates a telephone call to the telephone number string of the hyperlink through the wireless network (step 430 of FIG 4) Note that steps 402-414 and 422-430 are conventional steps for a mobile station<br>
As shown m FIG 8 in the contmumg example, telephone calling information 802 is displayed m visual display 222 after the end user initiation of the telephone calling function The telephone calling information 802 includes visually displayed information such as the telephone number 804 that is being called Note that it took two depressions of the scrollwheel key by the end user (the first depression of step<br>
414 and the second depression of step 426), includmg a selection through the list of functions of the pull-down menu, in order to place the telephone call to the telephone number as described<br>
Back to the flowchart FIG 4, note that the scrollwheel key need not be actuated at the pomt after the hyperlink of the telephone number string is selected and highlighted m step 412 Rather, the SEND key may be depressed and detected at step 416 of FIG 4 In response to a single depression of this SEND key after the highlighting of the hyperlink for the telephone number string, the mobile station initiates a telephone call to the telephone number suing through the wireless network (step 430 of FIG 4) The actuation of the SEND key is performed following the end user selection of the hyperlink without any intervening key depressions No function options are displayed for the end user, the initiation of the telephone call is immediate once the SEND key is depressed Again as shown in FIG 8 in the continuing example, telephone calling information 802 is displayed in visual display 222 after the end user initiation of the telephone calling function by depressing SEND key 310 The telephone calling information 802 includes visually displayed information such as the telephone number 804 that is being called Again, it took only a single depression of the SEND key by the end user in order to place the telephone call to the telephone number as described, after the highlighting of the hyperlink The call may be terminated by the depression of the END key 310 by the end user Further m the flowchart, other keys may be actuated in lieu of the scrollwheel actuation at step 414 or the SEND key actuation at step 416 as identified at step 418, and these alternative functions may be processed accordmgly (step 420 of FIG 4)<br>
Again referring back to the flowchart of FIG 4, telephone calls can also be made without regard to the receipt of messages Beginmng at a start block 450 of FIG 4 (l e "Start B"), the end user may select and enter a telephone number string using telephone digits 0, 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, *, and # of the keypad (step 452 of FIG 4) When the mobile station detects that the SEND key is depressed following the manual entry of the telephone number string (step 416 of FIG 4), then the mobile station initiates a telephone call to the telephone number string through the wireless network (step 430 of FIG 4) Again as shown in FIG 8 in the continuing example, telephone calling information 802 is displayed in visual display 222 after the end user<br>
initiation of the function by depressing SEND key 310 The telephone calling information 802 usings visually displayed information such as the telephone number 804 that is being called The call may be terminated by the depression of the END key 310 by the end user<br>
The initiation of a telephone call based on steps 404-416 (I e use of the SEND key with selected hyperlink) is highly advantageous m that a telephone call can be placed substantially immediately after the hyperlink is selected Several processing steps may be avoided as compared to using steps 414-430 It is also advantageous that the scrollwheel on the side of the housing may be used to select the hyperlink by one hand of the end user (I e the hand that is holdmg the mobile station) while the SEND key on the front side of the housing may be depressed by the other hand of the end user (l e the hand that is not holding the mobile station) Further advantageous is that several alternative techniques for initiating telephone calls are provided for a more flexible and easy-to-use user interface of the mobile station, especially a mobile station providing both voice and data (e g e-mail) capabilities<br>
As described herem, a method for initiating telephone calls from a mobile station which operates m a wireless communication network may using the steps of receiving a message through a wireless receiver of the mobile station, causing the message to be visually displayed m a visual display of a user interface of the mobile station, the message including a telephone number suing, causing a hyperlink for the telephone number string m the message to be created for use while the message is visually displayed in the visual display, causing the hyperlink for the telephone number string to be highlighted when selected during the visual displaying of the message, and m response to a single depression of a key of the user interface while the hyperlink is selected, causing a telephone call to the telephone number string to be initiated through the wireless communication network The single depression of the key may be made immediately following the selection of the hyperlink without any intervening key depressions Additional call initiation techniques are provided in combination with this technique to provide a more flexible and easy-to-use interface A computer program product of the present application may using a storage medium and computer instructions stored in the storage medium, where the computer<br>
instructions are executable by one or more processors for initiating telephone calls with use of the above-descnbed method<br>
A mobile station of the present application usings one or more processors, a wireless transceiver coupled to the one or more processors, and a user interface which usings a visual display and a plurality of keys The wireless transceiver is operative to receive a message, such "as an e-mail message, which usings a telephone number string When the message is visually displayed m the visual display, a hyperlink for the telephone number string in the message is created The hyperlink for the telephone number string is highlighted when selected by an end user during the visual displaying of the message (for example, when selected through use of a scroUwheel of the user interface) In response to a single depression of a key of the user interface while the hyperlink is selected, a telephone call to the telephone number strmg is initiated through the wireless communication network The single depression of the key may be made immediately following the selection of the hyperlink without any intervening key depressions<br>
The above-descnbed embodiments of the present application are mtended to be examples only Those of skill m the art may effect alterations, modifications and variations to the particular embodiments without departing from the scope of the application The invention described herein in the recited claims intends to cover and embrace all suitable changes m technology<br><br><br><br><br><br>
