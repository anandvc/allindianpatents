RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
|0001]	This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/826,720 entitled -'INHIBITORS<br>
OF BRUTON'S IYROSINF KINASF" II led September 22. 2006: and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/828,590 entitled "INHIBITORS OF BRUTON'S IYROSINF KINASF" tiled October 6. 2006. both of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Described herein are compounds, methods of making such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions<br>
and medicaments containing such compounds, and methods of using such compounds and compositions to inhibit the activity of tyrosine kinases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION |0003|    Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, is a key signaling enzyme expressed in all hematopoietic cells types except plymphocytes and natural killer cells. Btk plays an essential role in the B-cell signaling pathway linking cell surface B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation to downstream intracellular responses.<br>
|0004|    Btk is a key regulator of B-cell development, activation, signaling, and survival (Kurosaki, Curr Op Imm, 2000, 276-281; SchaelTer and Schwarizberg. Curr Op Imm 2000, 282-288). In addition. Btk plays a role in a number of other hematopoetic cell signaling pathways, e.g.. Toll like receptor (Tl.R) and cytokine receptor-mediated TNF-a production in macrophages. IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) signaling in Mast cells, inhibition of Fas/APO-1 apoptotic signaling in B-lineage lymphoid cells, and collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation. See, e.g., C. A. Jeffries, et al., (2003). Journal of Biological Chemistry 278:26258-26264; N. J. Horwood. et al., (2003), The Journal of Experimental Medicine 197:1603-1611; lwaki et al. (2005).

Herein, whenever the number of carbon atoms in a heterocycle is indicated (e.g.. C1-C6 heterocycle), at least one other atom (the heteroatom) must be present in the ring. Designations such as "C1-C6 heterocycle" refer only to the number of carbon atoms in the ring and do not refer to the total number of atoms in the ring. It is understood that the heterocylic ring can ha\ c additional heteroatoms in the ring. Designations such as "4-6 membered heterocycle" refer to the total number of atoms that are contained in the ring (i.e.. a four. five, or six membered ring, in which at least one atom is a carbon atom, at least one atom is a heteroatom and the remaining two to four atoms are either carbon atoms or heteroatoms). In heterocycles that have two or more heteroatoms. those two or more heteroatoms can be the same or different from one another. Heterocycles can be optionally substituted. Binding to a heterocycle can be at a heteroatom or via a carbon atom. Non-aromatic heterocyclic groups include groups having only 4 atoms in their ring system, but aromatic heterocyclic groups must have at least 5 atoms in their ring system. The heterocyclic<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
|00163]	The methods described herein include administering to a subject in need a composition containing a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of one or more irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds described herein. Without being bound by theory, the diverse roles played by Btk signaling in various hematopoietic cell functions, e.g., B-cell receptor activation, suggests that small molecule Btk inhibitors are useful for reducing the risk of or treating a variety of diseases affected by or affecting many cell types of the hematopoetic lineage including, e.g., autoimmune diseases, heteroimmune conditions or diseases, inflammatory diseases, cancer (e.g., B-cell proliferative disorders), and thromboembolic disorders.

|00169]	Symptoms, diagnostic tests, and prognostic tests for each of the above-mentioned conditions are<br>
known in the art. See. e.g.. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine ." 16th ed.. 2004, The McGraw-Hill<br>
Companies. Inc. Dev et al. (2006). Cvtojournal 3(24). and the "Revised European American Lymphoma'* (REAL)<br>
classification system (see. e.g.. the website maintained b_v the National Cancer Institute).<br>
|00170|	A number of animal models of are useful for establishing a range of therapeutically effective doses of<br>
irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds for treating any of the foregoing diseases.<br>
[00171]	For example, dosing of irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds for treating an autoimmune disease can<br>
be assessed in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthitis. In this model, arthritis is induced in Balb/c mice by<br>
administering anti-collagen antibodies and lipopolysaccharide. See Nandakumar el al. (2003), Am J Pathol<br>
163:1827-1837.<br>
|00172|	In another example, dosing of irreversible Btk inhibitors for the treatment of B-cell proliferative<br>
disorders can be examined in, e.g.. a human-to-mouse xenograft model in which human B-cell lymphoma cells (e.g.<br>
Ramos cells) are implanted into immunodefficient mice (e.g.. "nude" mice) as described in, e.g., Paget et al. (2005),<br>
Clin Cancer Res 11(131:4857-4866.<br>
|00173]	Animal models for treatment of thromboembolic disorders are also known.<br>
[00174]	The therapeutic efficacv of the compound for one of the foregoing diseases can be optimized during a<br>
course of treatment, for example, a subject being treated can undergo a diagnostic evaluation to correlate the relief<br>
of disease symptoms or pathologies to inhibition of in vivo Btk activity achieved by administering a given dose of an<br>
irreversible Btk inhibitor. Cellular assays known in the art can be used to determine in vivo activity of Btk in the<br>
presence or absence of an irreversible Btk inhibitor. For example, since activated Btk is phosphorylated at tyrosine<br>
223 (Y223) and tyrosine 551 (Y55I). phospho-specitlc immunocvtochemical staining of P-Y223 or P-Y551-positive<br>
cells can be used to detect or quantify activation of Bkt in a population of cells (e.g.. by FACS analysis of stained vs<br>
unstained cells). See. e.g.. Nisitani el al. (1999). Proc Natl Acad. Sci. USA 96:2221-2226. Thus, the amount of the<br>
Btk inhibitor inhibitor compound that is administered to a subject can be increased or decreased as needed so as to<br>
maintain a level of Btk inhibition optimal for treating the subject's disease state.<br>
Compounds<br>
[00175]	In the following description of irreversible Btk compounds suitable for use in the methods described<br>
herein, definitions of referred-to standard chemistrv terms may be found in reference works (if not otherwise defined herein), including Carey and Sundberg "Advanced Organic Chemistry 4th Ed." Vols. A (2000) and B (2001), Plenum Press. New York. Unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of mass spectroscopy, NMR, HPLC, protein chemistrv. biochemistry, recombinant DNA techniques and pharmacology, within the ordinary skill of the art are employed. In addition, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for Btk (e.g.. human Btk) are known in the art as disclosed in. e.g.. U'.S. Patent No. 6.326.469. Unless specific definitions are prov ided, the nomenclature employed in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of. analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistrv described herein are those known in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients<br>
|00176]	The Btk inhibitor compounds described herein are selective for Btk and kinases having a cysteine<br>
residue in an amino acid sequence position of the tyrosine kinase that is homologous to the amino acid sequence position of cysteine 481 in Btk. See. e.g.. kinases in FIG. 1. Inhibitor compounds described herein include a Michael acceptor moiety.<br>
|00177|	Generally, an irreversible inhibitor compound of Btk used in the methods described herein is identified<br>
or characterized in an in vitro assay, e.g.. an acellular biochemical assay or a cellular functional assay. Such assays are useful to determine an in vitro IC50 for an irreversible Btk inhibitor compound.<br>
|00178|	For example, an acellular kinase assay can be used to determine Btk activity after incubation of the<br>
kinase in the absence or presence of a range of concentrations of a candidate irreversible Btk inhibitor compound. If the candidate compound is in fact an irreversible Btk inhibitor. Btk kinase activity will not be recovered by repeat washing with inhibitor-free medium. See. e.g.. J. B. Smaill. et al. (1999).,/ Med. ('fern. 42(10):1803-1815. Further, covalent complex formation between Btk and a candidate irreversible Btk inhibitor is a useful indicator of irreversible inhibition of Btk that can be readily determined by a number of methods known in the art (e.g.. mass spectrometry). For example, some irreversible Btk-inhibitor compounds can form a covalent bond with Cys 481 of Btk (e.g., via a Michael reaction).<br>
|00179)	Cellular functional assays for Btk inhibition include measuring one or more cellular endpoints in<br>
response to stimulating a Btk-mediated pathway in a cell line (e.g.. BCR activation in Ramos cells) in the absence or presence of a range of concentrations of a candidate irreversible Btk inhibitor compound. Useful endpoints for determining a response to BCR activation include, e.g.. autophosphorylation of Btk, phosphorylation of a Btk target protein (e.g., PLC-y), and cytoplasmic calcium flux.<br>
|00180|	High throughput assays for many acellular biochemical assays (e.g.. kinase assays) and cellular<br>
functional assays (e.g.. calcium flux) are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In addition, high<br>
throughput screening systems are commercially available (see. e.g.. Zymark Corp.. Hopkinton, MA; Air Technical<br>
Industries. Mentor. OH: Beekman Instruments. Inc. I'ullerton. CA: Precision Systems. Inc., Natick, MA, etc.). These<br>
systems typically automate entire procedures including all sample and reagent pipetting, liquid dispensing, timed<br>
incubations, and final readings of the microplate in detector(s) appropriate for the assay. Automated systems thereby<br>
allow the identification and characterization of a large number of irreversible Btk compounds without undue effort.<br>
|00181]	Irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds can used for the manufacture of a medicament for treating any of<br>
the foregoing conditions (e.g.. autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, allergy disorders, B-cell proliferative disorders, or thromboembolic disorders).<br>
[00182]        In some embodiments, the irreversible Btk inhibitor compound used for the methods described herein inhibits Btk or a Btk homolog kinase activity with an in vitro IC50 of less than 10 uM (e.g., less than 1 µM, less than 0.5 µM, less than 0.4 µM, less than 0.3 µM. less than 0.1, less than 0.08 µM. less than 0.06 µM, less than 0.05 uM, less than 0.04 µµM. less than 0.03 µM. less than less than 0.02 µM. less than 0.01, less than 0.008 µM, less than 0.006 µM. less than 0.005 µM. less than 0.004 µM. less than 0.003 µM. less than less than 0.002 µM, less than 0.001, less than 0.00099 µM. less than 0.00098 µM. less than 0.00097 µM. less than 0.00096 µM. less than 0.00095 uM, less than 0.00094 µM. less than 0.00093 µM, less than 0.00092. or less than 0.00090 µM).<br>
[00183)	In one embodiment, the irreversible Btk inhibitor compound selectively and irreversibly inhibits an<br>
activated form of its target tyrosine kinase (e.g.. a phosphorylated form of the tyrosine kinase). For example,<br>
activated Btk is transphosphorylated at tyrosine 551. Thus, in these embodiments the irreversible Btk inhibitor<br>
inhibits the target kinase in cells only once the target kinase is activated by the signaling events.<br>

Use of Protecting Groups<br>
[00212]	In the reactions described, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example<br>
hydroxy, amino, imino. thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Protecting groups are used to block some or all reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. In one embodiment, each protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal. Protective groups can be removed by acid, base, and hydrogenolvsis. Groups such as trityl. dimethoxytritvl. acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolvsis. and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as. but not limited to. methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.<br>
[00213]	Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable<br>
protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, or they may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2.4-dimethoxybenzyl. while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.<br>
[00214]        Allyl blocking groups are useful in then presence of acid- and base- protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a Pd°-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react. |00215)        Typically blocking/protecting groups may be selected from:<br>

understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds provided herein can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be synthesized by techniques known in the art. as well as those set forth herein. Further Forms of Compounds<br>
[00226]	Compounds disclosed herein have a structure of any of Formula (A). Formula (B), Formula (C), or<br>
Formula (D). It is understood that when reference is made to compounds described herein, it is meant to include<br>
compounds of any of Formula (A), formula (B). Formula (C). or Formula (D). as well as to all of the specific compounds that fall within the scope of these generic formulae, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
|00227|	The compounds described herein may possess one or more stereocenters and each center may exist in<br>
the R or S configuration. The compounds presented herein include all diastereomeric. enantiomeric, and epimeric<br>
forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. Stereoisomers may be obtained, if desired, by methods known in<br>
the art as, for example, the separation of stereoisomers by chiral chromatographic columns.<br>
[00228]	Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their<br>
physical chemical differences by methods known, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.<br>
In one embodiment, enantiomers can be separated bv chiral chromatographic columns. In other embodiments,<br>
enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with<br>
an appropriate optically active compound (e.g.. alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g.,<br>
hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including<br>
diastereomers, enantiomers, and mixtures thereof are considered as part of the compositions described herein.<br>
|00229|	The methods and formulations described herein include the use of N-oxides, crystalline forms (also<br>
known as polymorphs), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds described herein, as well as active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity. In some situations, compounds may exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the scope of the compounds presented herein. In addition, the compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein.<br>
|00230|	Compounds of any of Formula (A), Formula (B). Formula (C), or Formula (D) in unoxidized form can<br>
be prepared from N-oxides of compounds of any of Formula (A). Formula (B), Formula (C), or Formula (D) by treating with a reducing agent, such as. but not limited to. sulfur, sulfur dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride. sodium borohydride. phosphorus trichloride, tribromide. or the like in a suitable inert organic solvent, such as. but not limited to. acetonitrile. ethanol. aqueous dioxane. or the like at 0 to 8()°C.<br>
|00231]	In some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs. A "prodrug" refers to an<br>
agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may. for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the "prodrug") to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, those of skill in this art, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, can design prodrugs of the compound, (see, for example.<br>

|00232]	Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to<br>
produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases, some of the herein-described compounds may be a prodrug for another derivative or active compound.<br>
(00233]	Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent<br>
drug. They may. for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. See, e.g.. Fedorak et al., Am J. Physiol.. 269:G210-218 (1995); McLoed et al..

(00314|	In still other embodiments, effervescent powders are also prepared in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure. Effervescent salts have been used to disperse medicines in water for oral administration. Effervescent salts are granules or coarse powders containing a medicinal agent in a dry mixture, usually composed of sodium bicarbonate, citric acid and/or tartaric acid. When salts of the compositions described herein are added to water, the acids and the base react to liberate carbon dioxide gas, thereby causing 'effervescence." Examples of effervescent salts include, e.g.. the following ingredients: sodium bicarbonate or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate, citric acid and/or tartaric acid. Any acid-base combination that results in the liberation of carbon dioxide can be used in place of the combination of sodium bicarbonate and citric and tartaric acids, as long as the ingredients were suitable for pharmaceutical use and result in a pH of about 6.0 or higher.<br>
[00315|	In other embodiments, the formulations described herein, which include a compound of Formula (A),<br>
are solid dispersions. Methods of producing such solid dispersions are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4.343.789. 5.340,591. 5.456.923. 5.700,485, 5.723,269, and U.S. Pub. Appl 2004/0013734. each of which is specifically incorporated by reference. In still other embodiments, the formulations described herein are solid solutions. Solid solutions incorporate a substance together with the active agent and other excipients such that heating the mixture results in dissolution of the drug and the resulting composition is then cooled to provide a solid blend which can be further formulated or directly added to a capsule or compressed into a tablet. Methods of producing such solid solutions are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4.151.273. 5.281.420. and 6.083.518. each of which is specifically incorporated by reference.<br>
|00316)	The pharmaceutical solid oral dosage forms including formulations described herein, which include a<br>
compound of any of Formula (A), Formula (B). Formula (C), or Formula (D), can be further formulated to provide a controlled release of the compound of Formula (A). Controlled release refers to the release of the compound of any of Formula (A). Formula (B). Formula (C). or Formula (D), from a dosage form in which it is incorporated according to a desired profile over an extended period of time. Controlled release profiles include, for example.<br>
sustained release, prolonged release, pulsatile release, and delayed release profiles. In contrast to immediate release<br>
compositions, controlled release compositions allow delivery of an agent to a subject over an extended period of<br>
time according to a predetermined profile. Such release rates can provide therapeutically effective levels of agent for<br>
an extended period of time and thereby provide a longer period of pharmacologic response while minimizing side<br>
effects as compared to conventional rapid release dosage forms. Such longer periods of response provide for many<br>
inherent benefits that are not achieved with the corresponding short acting, immediate release preparations.<br>
[00317|	In some embodiments, the solid dosage forms described herein can be formulated as enteric coated<br>
delayed release oral dosage forms, i.e.. as an oral dosage form of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein which utilizes an enteric coating to affect release in the small intestine of the gastrointestinal tract. The enteric coated dosage form may be a compressed or molded or extruded tablet/mold (coated or uncoated) containing granules, powder, pellets, beads or particles of the active ingredient and/or other composition components, which are themselves coated or uncoated. The enteric coated oral dosage form may also be a capsule (coated or uncoated) containing pellets, beads or granules of the solid carrier or the composition, which are themselves coated or uncoated.<br>
[00318]        The term "'delayed release" as used herein refers to the delivery so that the release can be accomplished at some generally predictable location in the intestinal tract more distal to that which would have been accomplished if there had been no delayed release alterations. In some embodiments the method for delay of release is coating. Any coatings should be applied to a sufficient thickness such that the entire coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below about 5. but does dissolve at pH about 5 and above. It is expected that any anionic polymer exhibiting a pH-dependent solubility profile can be used as an enteric coating in the methods and compositions described herein to achieve deliver) to the lower gastrointestinal tract. In some embodiments the polymers described herein are anionic carboxylic polymers. In other embodiments, the polymers and compatible mixtures thereof, and some of their properties, include, but are not limited to:<br>
[00319]	Shellac, also called purified lac, a refined product obtained from the resinous secretion of an insect.<br>
This coating dissolves in media of pH &gt;7;<br>
[00320]	Acrylic polymers. The performance of acrylic polymers (primarily their solubility in biological fluids)<br>
can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Examples of suitable acrylic polymers include methacrylic acid copolymers and ammonium methacrylate copolymers. The Eudragit series E, L, S, RL, RS and NE (Rohm Pharma) are available as solubilized in organic solvent, aqueous dispersion, or dry powders. The Eudragit series RL, NE, and RS are insoluble in the gastrointestinal tract but are permeable and are used primarily for colonic targeting. The Eudragit series E dissolve in the stomach. The Eudragit series L. L-30D and S are insoluble in stomach and dissolve in the intestine:<br>
[00321 ]	Cellulose Derivatives. Examples of suitable cellulose derivatives are: ethyl cellulose; reaction mixtures<br>
of partial acetate esters of cellulose with phthalic anhydride. The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) dissolves in pH &gt;6. Aquateric (FMC) is an aqueous based system and is a spray dried CAP psuedolatex with particles 
include, but are not limited to. AS-LG (LF). which dissolves at pH 5. AS-MG (MF). which dissolves at pH 5.5, and AS-HG (HF), which dissolves at higher pH. These polymers are offered as granules, or as fine powders for aqueous dispersions;<br>
[00322]	Poly Vinyl Acetate Phthalate (PVAP). PVAP dissolves in pH &gt;5, and it is much less permeable to<br>
water vapor and gastric fluids.<br>
[00323]	In some embodiments, the coating can. and usualh does, contain a plasticizer and possibly other<br>
coating excipients such as colorants, talc, and/or magnesium stearate. which are well known in the art. Suitable plasticizers include trieths 1 citrate (C'itroflex 2). triacetin (glyceryl triacetate), acetyl triethyl citrate (Citroflec A2), Carbowax 400 (polyethylene glycol 400). diethyl phthalate. tributyl citrate, acetylated monoglycerides, glycerol, fatty acid esters, propylene glycol, and dibutyl phthalate. In particular, anionic carboxylic acrylic polymers usually will contain 10-25% by weight of a plasticizer. especially dibutyl phthalate. polyethylene glycol, triethyl citrate and triacetin. Conventional coating techniques such as spray or pan coating are employed to apply coatings. The coating thickness must be sufficient to ensure that the oral dosage form remains intact until the desired site of topical delivery in the intestinal tract is reached.<br>
|00324]	Colorants, detackifiers, surfactants, antifoaming agents, lubricants (e.g., carnuba wax or PEG) may be<br>
added to the coatings besides plasticizers to solubilize or disperse the coating material, and to improve coating performance and the coated product.<br>
[00325]	In other embodiments, the formulations described herein, which include a compound of Formula (A).<br>
are delivered using a pulsatile dosage form. A pulsatile dosage form is capable of providing one or more immediate release pulses at predetermined time points after a controlled lag time or at specific sites. Pulsatile dosage forms including the formulations described herein, which include a compound of any of Formula (A). Formula (B), Formula (C), or Formula (D). may be administered using a variety of pulsatile formulations known in the art. For example, such formulations include, but are not limited to. those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,011,692, 5,017,381. 5,229.135, and 5.840.329, each of which is specifically incorporated by reference.

In one embodiment, the controlled release dosage form is pulsatile release solid oral dosage form including at least two groups of particles, (i.e. multiparticulate) each containing the formulation described herein. The first group of particles provides a substantially immediate dose of the compound of any of Formula (A). Formula (B), Formula (C), or Formula (D), upon ingestion by a mammal. The first group of particles can be either uncoated or include a coating and/or sealant. The second group of particles includes coated particles, which includes from about 2% to about 75%. from about 2.5% to about 70%. or from about 40% to about 70%, by weight of the total dose of the compound of any of Formula (A).

Formula (C). or Formula (D), in said formulation, in admixture with one or more binders.the coating includes a pharmaceutically acceptable ingredient in an amount sufficient to provide a dclay of from about 2 hours to about 7 hours following ingestion before release of the second dose. Suitable coatings include one or more differentially degradable coatings such as. by way of example only, pH sensitive coatings (enteric coatings) such as acrylic resins (e.g.. Eudragit® EPO, Eudragit® L30D-55. Eudragit® FS 30D Eudragit® L100-55. Eudragit® L100. Eudragit® S100. Eudragit® RD100.

|00337)	In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulations described herein can be self-emulsifying drug<br>
delivery systems (SEDDS). Emulsions are dispersions of one immiscible phase in another, usually in the form of droplets. Generally, emulsions are created by vigorous mechanical dispersion. SEDDS, as opposed to emulsions or microemulsions. spontaneously form emulsions when added to an excess of water without any external mechanical dispersion or agitation. An advantage of SEDDS is that only gentle mixing is required to distribute the droplets throughout the solution. Additionally, water or the aqueous phase can be added just prior to administration, which ensures stability of an unstable or hydrophobic active ingredient. Thus, the SEDDS provides an effective delivery system for oral and parenteral delivery of hydrophobic active ingredients. SEDDS may provide improvements in the bioavailability of hydrophobic active ingredients. Methods of producing self-emulsifying dosage forms are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,858,401, 6,667,048, and 6,960,563, each of which is specifically incorporated by reference.<br>
[00338]	It is to be appreciated that there is overlap between the above-listed additives used in the aqueous<br>
dispersions or suspensions described herein, since a given additive is often classified differently by different practitioners in the field, or is commonly used for any of several different functions. Thus, the above-listed additives should be taken as merely exemplary, and not limiting, of the types of additives that can be included in formulations described herein. The amounts of such additives can be readily determined by one skilled in the art, according to the particular properties desired. Intranasal Formulations<br>
|00339|	Intranasal formulations are known in the art and are described in. for example, U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
4,476.116. 5.116.817 and 6.391.452. each of which is specifically incorporated by reference. Formulations that include a compound of any of Formula (A). Formula (B), Formula (C), or Formula (D), which are prepared<br>
according to these and other techniques well-known in the art are prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl<br>
alcohol or other suitable preservatives, tluorocarbons. and/or other soiubilizing or dispersing agents known in the<br>
art. See, for example. Ansel. H. C. et al.. Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems. Sixth Ed.<br>
(1995). Preferably these compositions and formulations are prepared with suitable nontoxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable ingredients. These ingredients are known to those skilled in the preparation of nasal dosage forms and<br>
some of these can be found in REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY, 21st edition,<br>
2005, a standard reference in the field. The choice of suitable carriers is highly dependent upon the exact nature of<br>
the nasal dosage form desired, e.g., solutions, suspensions, ointments, or gels. Nasal dosage forms generally contain<br>
large amounts of water in addition to the active ingredient. Minor amounts of other ingredients such as pH adjusters,<br>
emulsifiers or dispersing agents, preservatives, surfactants, gelling agents, or buffering and other stabilizing and<br>
soiubilizing agents may also be present. The nasal dosage form should be isotonic with nasal secretions.<br>
|00340]	For administration by inhalation, the compounds of any of Formula (A). Formula (B). Formula (C). or<br>
Formula (D), described herein may be in a form as an aerosol, a mist or a powder. Pharmaceutical compositions described herein are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant. e g . dichlorodifluoromethane. trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane. carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of. such as. by way of example only, gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound described herein and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. Buccal Formulations<br>
|00341]	Buccal formulations that include compounds of any of Formula (A), Formula (B), Formula (C), or<br>
Formula (D), may be administered using a variety of formulations known in the art. For example, such formulations include, but are not limited to. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4.229.447. 4.596.795. 4.755.386, and 5.739.136. each of which is specifically incorporated by reference. In addition, the buccal dosage forms described herein can further include a bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier that also serves to adhere the dosage form to the buccal mucosa. The buccal dosage form is fabricated so as to erode gradually over a predetermined time period, wherein the delivery of the compound of any of Formula (A). Formula (B). Formula (C). or Formula (D). is provided essentially throughout. Buccal drug delivery, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. avoids the disadvantages encountered with oral drug administration, e.g.. slow absorption, degradation of the active agent by fluids present in the gastrointestinal tract and/or first-pass inactivation in the liver. With regard to the bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier, it will be appreciated that virtually any such carrier can be used, so long as the desired drug release profile is not compromised, and the carrier is compatible with the compound of any of Formula (A), Formula (B), Formula (C), or Formula (D), and any other components that may be present in the buccal dosage unit. Generally, the polymeric carrier comprises hydrophilic (water-soluble and water-swellable) polymers that adhere to the wet surface of the buccal mucosa. Examples of polymeric carriers useful herein include acrylic acid polymers and co, e.g., those known as "carbomers" (Carbopol®. which may be obtained from B.F. Goodrich, is one such polymer). Other components may also be incorporated into the buccal dosage forms described herein include, but are not limited to. disintegrants. diluents, binders, lubricants, flavoring, colorants, preservatives, and the like. For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, or gels formulated in a conventional manner.<br>
Transdermal Formulations<br>
[00342|	Transdermal formulations described herein may be administered using a variety of devices which have<br>
been described in the art. For example, such devices include, but are not limited to. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3.598.122. 3.598,123. 3,710.795. 3.731.683. 3.742.951. 3.814.097. 3.921.636. 3.972.995. 3.993.072, 3,993,073. 3.996.934, 4.031,894. 4,060.084. 4.069.307. 4.077.407. 4.201.211. 4,230.105. 4,292.299. 4,292,303, 5,336,168, 5,665.378, 5,837.280, 5,869.090. 6,923.983, 6,929.801 and 6.946.144. each of which is specifically incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
(00343|	The transdermal dosage forms described herein may incorporate certain pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipients which are conventional in the art. In one embodiments, the transdermal formulations described herein include at least three components: (1) a formulation of a compound of any of Formula (A), Formula (B), Formula (C), or Formula (D); (2) a penetration enhancer; and (3) an aqueous adjuvant. In addition, transdermal formulations can include additional components such as. but not limited to. gelling agents, creams and ointment bases, and the like. In some embodiments, the transdermal formulation can further include a woven or non-woven backing material to enhance absorption and prevent the removal of the transdermal formulation from the skin. In other embodiments, the transdermal formulations described herein can maintain a saturated or supersaturated state to promote diffusion into the skin.<br>
[00344|	Formulations suitable for transdermal administration of compounds described herein may employ<br>
transdermal delivery devices and transdermal delivery patches and can be lipophilic emulsions or buffered, aqueous solutions, dissolved and/or dispersed in a polymer or an adhesive. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Still further, transdermal delivery of the compounds described herein can be accomplished by means of iontophoretic patches and the like. Additionally, transdermal patches can provide controlled delivery of the compounds of any of Formula (A), Formula (B), Formula (C), or Formula (D). The rate of absorption can be slowed by using rate-controlling membranes or by trapping the compound within a polymer matrix or gel. Conversely, absorption enhancers can be used to increase absorption. An absorption enhancer or carrier can include absorbable pharmaceutically acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin. For example, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin. Injectable Formulations<br>
[00345]	Formulations that include a compound of any of Formula (A). Formula (B), Formula (C), or Formula<br>
(D), suitable for intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection may include physiologically acceptable sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles including water, ethanol. polyols (propyleneglycol. polyethylene-glycol. glycerol, cremophor and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. Formulations suitable for subcutaneous injection may also contain additives such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the growth of microorganisms can be ensured bv various antibacterial and antifungal agents, such as parabens, chlorobutanol. phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as<br>
sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought<br>
about by the use of agents delaying absorption, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
|00346]	For intravenous injections, compounds described herein may be formulated in aqueous solutions,<br>
preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution. Ringer"s solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally knov\n in the art. For other parenteral injections, appropriate formulations may include aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, preferably with physiologically compatible buffers or excipients. Such excipients are generally known in the art.<br>
|00347|	Parenteral injections may involve bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection<br>
may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in a form suitable for parenteral injection as a sterile suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil. or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. Other Formulations<br>
|00348]	In certain embodiments, delivery systems for pharmaceutical compounds may be employed, such as,<br>
for example, liposomes and emulsions. In certain embodiments, compositions provided herein can also include an mucoadhesive polymer, selected from among, for example, carboxymethylcellulose. carbomer (acrylic acid polymer), poly(methylmethacrylate). polyacrylamide. polycarbophil, acrylic acid/butyl acrylate copolymer, sodium alginate and dextran.<br>
|00349]	In some embodiments, the compounds described herein may be administered topically and can be<br>
formulated into a variety of topically administrable compositions, such as solutions, suspensions, lotions, gels, pastes, medicated sticks, balms, creams or ointments. Such pharmaceutical compounds can contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives.<br>
|00350|	The compounds described herein may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as enemas, rectal<br>
gels, rectal foams, rectal aerosols, suppositories, jelly suppositories, or retention enemas, containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides, as well as synthetic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, PEG, and the like. In suppository forms of the compositions, a low-melting wax such as, but not limited to, a mixture of fatty acid glycerides. optionally in combination with cocoa butter is first melted. Examples of Methods of Dosing and Treatment Regimens<br>
|00351|	The compounds described herein can be used in the preparation of medicaments for the inhibition of<br>
Btk or a homolog thereof, or for the treatment of diseases or conditions that would benefit, at least in part, from inhibition of Btk or a homolog thereof. In addition, a method for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein in a subject in need of such treatment, involves administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound of any of Formula (A). Formula (B). Formula (C). or Formula (D). described herein, or a<br>
pharmaceutical!) acceptable salt, pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxide. pharmaceutical!) active metabolite, pharmaceutical!) acceptable prodrug, or pharmaceutical!) acceptable solvate thereof, in therapeutically effective amounts to said subject.<br>
[00352|	The compositions containing the compound(s) described herein can be administered for prophylactic<br>
and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, the compositions are administered to a patient already<br>
suffering from a disease or condition, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the<br>
disease or condition. Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease or<br>
condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the<br>
treating physician. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such therapeutically effective<br>
amounts by routine experimentation (including, but not limited to, a dose escalation clinical trial).<br>
|00353)	In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein are<br>
administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a "'prophylactically effective amount or dose." In this use. the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such prophylactically effective amounts by routine experimentation (e.g.. a dose escalation clinical trial). When used in a patient, effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous thcrapv. the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.<br>
|00354)	In the case wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the<br>
administration of the compounds may be administered chronically, that is. for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disease or condition.<br>
|00355|	In the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of<br>
the compounds may be given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a "drug holiday"). The length of the drug holiday can vary between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days. 15 days. 20 days. 28 days. 35 days. 50 days. 70 days, 100 days. 120 days, 150 days, 180 days, 200 days, 250 days. 280 days. 300 days. 320 days, 350 days, or 365 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday may be from 10%-100%. including, by way of example only. 10%. 15%. 20%. 25%. 30%. 35%, 40%. 45%. 50%. 55%. 60%. 65%. 70%. 75%. 80%. 85%. 90%. 95%. or 100%.<br>
|00356|	Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if<br>
necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequencv of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.<br>
|00357|	The amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors<br>
such as the particular compound, disease or condition and its severity, the identity (e.g.. weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but can nevertheless be routinely determined in a manner known in the art according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g.. the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, or from about 1-1500 mg per day. The desired dose may convenient!) be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered<br>
simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.<br>
[00358)	The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single<br>
administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing<br>
appropriate quantities of one or more compound, the unit dosage may be in the form of a package containing<br>
discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples arc packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials<br>
or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers.<br>
Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in<br>
the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection may be presented in unit dosage<br>
form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative.<br>
[00359]	The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual<br>
treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.<br>
[00360]	Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens can be determined by standard<br>
pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to. the determination of the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the CD50(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between I.D50 and ED50- Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with minimal toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. Combination Treatments<br>
[00361]	The irreversible Btk inhibitor compositions described herein can also be used in combination with<br>
other well known therapeutic reagents that are selected for their therapeutic value for the condition to be treated. In general, the compositions described herein and. in embodiments where combinational therapy is employed, other agents do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art. and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician.<br>
[00362]	In certain instances, it may be appropriate to administer at least one irreversible Btk inhibitor<br>
compound described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds described herein is nausea, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-nausea agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or. by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e.. by itself the adjuvant may have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or. by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one of the<br>
compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient may experience a synergistic benefit.<br>
(00363)        The particular choice of compounds used will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. The compounds may be administered concurrently (e.g.. simultaneousK. essentiallv simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of compounds used. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.<br>
|00364|	It is known to those of skill in the art that therapeutically-effective dosages can vary when the drugs<br>
are used in treatment combinations. Methods for experimentally determining therapeutically-effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are described in the literature. For example, the use of metronomic dosing, i.e., providing more frequent, lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects, has been described extensively in the literature Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient.<br>
[00365|	For combination therapies described herein, dosages of the co-administered compounds will of course<br>
vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In addition, when co-administered with one or more biologically active agents, the compound provided herein may be administered either simultaneous!) with the biologically active agent(s), or sequentially. If administered sequentially, the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent(s).<br>
[00366]	In any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (one of which is a compound of Formula (A), (B), (C), or<br>
(D) described herein) may be administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple<br>
therapeutic agents may be provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as<br>
a single pill or as two separate pills). One of the therapeutic agents may be given in multiple doses, or both may be<br>
given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may vary from more than zero<br>
weeks to less than four weeks. In addition, the combination methods, compositions and formulations are not to be<br>
limited to the use of only two agents; the use of multiple therapeutic combinations are also envisioned.<br>
[00367|	It is understood that the dosage regimen to treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s) for which relief<br>
is sought, can be modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder from which the subject suffers, as well as the age. weight, sex. diet, and medical condition of the subject. Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed can vary widely and therefore can deviate from the dosage regimens set forth herein. [00368|        The pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein may be a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. The pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy may also be administered sequentially, with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen calling for two-step administration. The two-step administration regimen may call for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced-apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps may range from, a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent, such as potency, solubility,<br>
bioavailability, plasma half-life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. Circadian variation of the target molecule concentration may also determine the optimal dose interval.<br>
[00369]	In addition, the compounds described herein also may be used in combination with procedures that<br>
may provide additional or synergistic benefit to the patient. Bv way of example only, patients are expected to find therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein, wherein pharmaceutical composition of a compound dislcosed herein and /or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is known to be correlated with certain diseases or conditions.<br>
|00370|	The compounds described herein and combination therapies can be administered before, during or after<br>
the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound can vary. Thus, for example, the compounds can be used as a prophylactic and can be administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. The compounds and compositions can be administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the compounds can be initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms, or within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration can be via any route practical, such as. for example, an intravenous injection, a bolus injection, infusion over 5 minutes to about 5 hours, a pill, a capsule, transdermal patch, buccal delivery, and the like, or combination thereof. A compound should be administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected, and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease, such as, for example, from about 1 month to about 3 months. The length of treatment can vary for each subject, and the length can be determined using the known criteria. For example, the compound or a formulation containing the compound can be administered for at least 2 weeks, between about 1 month to about 5 years. or from about 1 month to about 3 years.<br>

Preparation of 4-Amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d|pyrimidine (Intermediate 2)<br>
[00389]	4-Amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-lH-pyrazolo[3.4-d]pyrimidine (Intermediate 2) is prepared as<br>
disclosed in International Patent Publication No. WO 01/019829. Briefly. 4-phenoxybenzoic acid (48 g) is added to<br>
thionyl chloride (100 mL) and heated under gentle reflux for 1 hour. Thionyl chloride is removed by distillation, the<br>
residual oil dissolved in toluene and volatile material removed at 80°C/20mbar. The resulting acid chloride is<br>
dissolved in toluene (200 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (35 mL). Malononitrile (14.8 g) is added and the solution and<br>
stirred at -10 °C while adding diisopropylethylethylamine (57.9 g) in toluene (150mL), while maintaining the<br>
temperature below 0°C. After 1 hour at 0°C, the mixture is stirred at 20°C overnight. Amine hydrochloride is<br>
removed by filtration and the filtrate evaporated in vacuo. The residue is taken up in ethyl acetate and washed with<br>
1.25 M sulphuric acid, then with brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvents gives a semisolid<br>
residue which is treated with a little ethyl acetate to give 4.1 g of l.l-dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-<br>
phenoxyphenyl)ethene as a white solid (m.p. 160- 162°C). The filtrate on evaporation gives 56.58 (96%) of 1,1-<br>
dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxypheny1 )ethene as a grey-brown solid, which is sufficiently pure for further use.<br>
[00390]	l.l-Dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene(56.5 g) in acetonitrile (780 mL) and methanol<br>
(85 mL) is stirred under nitrogen at 0°C while adding diisopropylethylamine (52.5 mL) followed by 2M trimethylsilyldiazomethane (150 mL) in THF. The reaction is stirred for 2 days at 20°C. and then 2 g of silica is added (for chromatography). The brown-red solution is evaporated in vacuo, the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed well with water then brine, dried and evaporated. The residue is extracted with diethyl ether (3x250 mL), decanting from insoluble oil. Evaporation of the ether extracts gives 22.5 g of l,l-dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxypheny!)ethene as a pale orange solid. The insoluble oil is purified by flash chromatography to give 15.0 g of a red-orange oil.<br>
[00391|	l,l-Dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene (22.5 g) and l,l-dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-<br>
phenoxyphenyl)ethene oil (15 g) are treated with a solution of hydrazine hydrate (18 mL) in ethanol (25 mL) and heated on the steambath for 1 hour. Ethanol (15 mL) is added followed by water (10 mL). The precipitated solid is collected and washed with ethanol:water (4:1) and then dried in air to give 3-amino-4-cyano-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrazole as a pale orange solid.<br>
[00392)	3-Amino-4-cyano-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrazole (29.5 g) is suspended in formamide (300 mL) and<br>
heated under nitrogen at 180°C for 4 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled to 30 °C and water (300 mL) is added.<br>

The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was filtered to remove the resins and the reaction mixture was concentrated and purified by flash chromatography (pentane/ethyl acetate = 1/1) to give intermediate 3 (55 mg).<br>
|00395[	Intermediate 3 (48.3 mg) was treated with 1 mL of 4N HCl in dioxane for 1 hour and then concentrated<br>

|00404)	The Btk IC50s of compounds disclosed herein was determined in both an acellular kinase assay and in a<br>
cellular functional assay of BCR-induced calcium flux as described below.<br>
|00405|	Btk kinase activity was determined using a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-<br>
FRET) methodology. Measurements were performed in a reaction volume of 50 µL using 96-well assay plates. Kinase enzyme, inhibitor. A f'P (at the Km for the kinase), and 1 µM peptide substrate (Biotin-AVLESEEELYSSARQ-NH;) were incubated in a reaction buffer composed of 20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCI, MgCL (5-25 mM depending on the kinase). MnCI:(0-10 mM). 1 mM DTT. 0.1 mM EDTA. 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 0.005% Tween-20. and 10% DMSO at pH 7.4 for one hour. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1.2 equivalents of EDTA (relative to divalent cation) in 25 µL of lx Lance buffer (Perkin-Elmer). Streptavidin-APC (Perkin-Elmer) and Eu-labeled p-Tyr 100 antibody (Perkin-Elmer) in 1.x Lance buffer were added in a 25 uL volume to give final concentrations of 100 nM and 2.5 nM. respectively, and the mixture was allowed to incubate for one hour. The TR-FRET signal was measured on a multimode plate reader with an excitation wavelength(EX) of 330 nm and detection wavelengths (Em) of 615 and 665 nm. Activity was determined by the ratio of the fluorescence at 665 nm to that at 615 nm. For each compound, enzyme activity was measured at various concentrations of compound. Negative control reactions were performed in the absence of inhibitor in replicates of six, and two no-enzyme controls were used to determine baseline fluorescence levels. Inhibition constants, K,(app), were obtained<br>
using the program Batchk, (Ku/mic et al (2000). Anal Biochem 286:45-50). IC50S were obtained according to the<br>
equation:<br>
[00406]	IC50 = |Ki(app)/( l+[ATP]/KmNTP)| + [E]total/2:<br>
[00407]	For all kinases. [ATP] = KmMP. [Btk]tota1 = 0.5 nM and [Lck]tota, = 6 nM.<br>
[00408]	Calcium flux fluoresence-based assays were performed in a FlexStation 11384 fluorometric imaging<br>
plate reader (Molecular Devices) according to manufacturer instructions. In brief, actively growing Ramos cells<br>
(ATCC) in RPM I medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) were washed and re-plated in low serum<br>
medium at approximately 5 X 10 cells per 100 µl per well in a 96-vvell plate. Compounds to be assayed were<br>
dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in low serum medium to final concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 u.M (at a<br>
dilution factor of 0.3). The diluted compounds were then added to each well (final DMSO concentration was 0.01%)<br>
and incubated at 37 degree in 5% CO2: incubator for one hour. Afterwards, 100 µ1 of a calcium-sensitive dye (from<br>
the Calcium 3 assay kit. Molecular Devices) was added to each well and incubated for an additional hour. The<br>
compound-treated cells were stimulated with a goat anti-human IgM antibody (80µg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch)<br>
and read in the FlexStation 11384 using a x = 485nm and m = 538nm for 200 seconds. The relative fluorescence<br>
unit (RFU) and the IC50 were recorded and analyzed using a built-in SoftMax program (Molecular devices).<br>
Table 2: Assay data for representative compounds<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
|00409|	Two lines of evidence demonstrated irreversible inhibition of Btk by these compounds. First, after<br>
recombinant Btk was pretreated with compounds, its activity was not recovered by repeat washing with inhibitor-free medium (see. e.g.. J. B. Smaill. et al. J Med Chem 1999. 42. 1803). Second, a major mass peak was observed by mass spectrometry corresponding to the molecular weight of a 1:1 covalent complex between compound 4 and Btk (Compound 4: 440 Da. recombinant Btk kinase domain: 33.487 Da; Complex: expected 33,927 Da, observed 33,927 Da).<br>
|00410]	These compounds are highly potent inhibitors of Btk kinase activity with IC50s in the sub-nanomolar to<br>
single digit nanomolar range for in vitro kinase activity. Their IC50s in the (Ramos cell) Ca2+ flux assay ranged from 3 to 92 nM.<br>
[00411]	Of note, we found that three types of Michael acceptors, acrylamide. vinyl sulfonamide and<br>
propargylamide. exhibited strong interactions with Btk. Adding a trans-oriented methyl group to the vinyl group decreased potency as shown by compound 5, which was 28-fold less potent than 4. This presumably relates to the reduced electrophilicity of the more substituted olefin. Compound 15 with a tertian amine group gained back some potency compared to 5. c\en though it still suffered a potency drop relative to compound 13. Compound 10 was about 6-fold more potent than 9, presumably due to the difference in the electrophile orientation. Finally, R configuration was determined as the slightly preferred absolute stereochemistry configuration by two sets of enantiomers (11 vs. 12 and 13 vs. 14). Example 3: Inhibition of Btk<br>
[00412]	We further characterized the properties of these compounds by assaying a number of cellular<br>
biochemical and functional endpoints. In particular, we sought to assess the selectivity of these compounds for inhibition of Btk versus the closely related protein kinases Lck, Lyn. and Syk. In anti-IgM-stimulated Ramos cells (a human B cell line), we assayed Btk-dependent phosphorylation of PLC-yl; Lyn and Syk-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine 551 on Btk: and BCR-activated calcium flux. We also measured the effect of compound 4 on Jurkat cells, a human T cell line in which Lck and Itk. but not Btk arc required for T cell receptor mediated Ca24 flux. As shown in Table 3. compound 4 exhibited significant selectivity for Btk in cellular assays. In anti-IgM stimulated Ramos cells, compound 4 inhibited the phosphor) lation of PLC-yl with an IC50 = 0.014 µM, while the Lyn and Syk-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine 551 on Btk was inhibited more weakly (IC50 &gt; 7.5 µM). Thus, compound 4 exhibits a &gt;500-fold selectivity between Btk and Lyn or Syk in cells. Further, compound 4 was 11-fold less active in inhibiting Ca2" flux than in Ramos cells, supporting the expected selectiv ity for B versus T cells.<br>

Example 4: Use of Compound 4 to treat rheumatoid arthritis<br>
|00413|	The in vivo efficacy of compound 4 was evaluated in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthitis. Arthritis<br>
was induced in Balb/c mice by administration of anti-collagen antibodies and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). See<br>
Nandakumar et al.(2003).,Am J Pathol. 163:1827-1837.<br>
|00414]	Female Balb/c mice were treated with 100 mg/kg of Chemicon mAb cocktail to Type II collagen<br>
intravenously on Day 0 and 1.25 mg/kg of LPS intraperitoneally on Day 1. Compound 4 was administered orally in<br>
a methylcellulose-based aqueous suspension formulation at 1.3. 10 and 30 mg/kg once daily starting on Day 2<br>
through Day 12. Blood samples were collected at 0.5 and 2 hours post dose of compound 4 administration on Day<br>
12 (see Table 4). The serum concentrations of compound 4 were quantified by LC/MS/MS. Twenty four hours post<br>
dose, levels of compound 4 were below the level of quantitation.<br>
Table 4. Dose and Time Dependence of Compound 4 Concentration in Plasma<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
[00415)	Inhibition of arthritis by compound 4 was dose-dependent, with a maximum effect (&gt;95% inhibition)<br>
at dose levels of 10 and 30 mg/kg. The plasma concentrations of compound 4 that induced this maximum effect<br>
were in the 0.6-1.7 µM range at Tmax (2 hr) and did not need to be sustained at high levels for 24 hours to achieve<br>
efficacy, which is not surprising for an irreversible inhibitor. Based on sequence analysis and molecular modeling,<br>
the irreversible inhibitors described herein are proposed to form a covalent bond with Cys 481 of Btk (e.g., the<br>
Michael reaction acceptor portion of the compounds described herein react with the Cys 481 residue of Btk). Based<br>
on sequence homology analysis (Figure 1), the compounds presented herein are also expected to act as irreversible<br>
inhibitors of kinases having a Cys 481 or a homologous cysteine residue, but to bind reversibly with kinases having<br>
a different amino acid at the 481 position within a catalytic domain sequence that is otherwise homologous to that of<br>
Btk. See. e.g.. the sequences listed in figure 1. See also the sequence alignments of tyrosine kinases (TK.) published<br>
on the world wide web at kinase.com/human/kinome/phylogeny.html.<br>
Example 5: Inhibition of Mast Cell Degranulation<br>

50 ng/ml IL-6, 100 ng/ml SCF. Cells were incubated with IgF. + IL-4 for 4 days and then degranulation was induced<br>
by cross-linking with anti-lgE. Degranulation quantitated using hexosaminidase assay. Compound did not inhibit<br>
degranulation induced by the Ca++ ionophore ionomycin and did not affect cell viability as determined by Alamar<br>
Blue assay. Compound 4 has an IC50 in MC degranulation less than 100 nanomolar. As such, compounds described<br>
herein can be used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as asthma.<br>
