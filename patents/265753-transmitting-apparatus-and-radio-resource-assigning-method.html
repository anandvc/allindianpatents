SPECIFICATION<br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TRANSMITTING APPARATUS AND RADIO RESOURCE ASSIGNING<br>
METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a<br>
transmission apparatus and a radio resource<br>
assignment method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In UMTS (Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunications System) scheme that is one of the<br>
third generation mobile communication schemes (3G),<br>
HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access) is<br>
standardized as a scheme for realizing high speed<br>
packet transmission in a link (to be referred to as<br>
a downlink hereinafter) from a base station to a<br>
mobile station.<br>
In the HSDPA, for increasing throughput<br>
that can be realized, a packet scheduling technique<br>
is adopted in which users connecting to the base<br>
station share radio resources (to be referred to as<br>
a shared packet channel hereinafter), and the base<br>
station assigns the radio resources to a user having<br>
good propagation state on a priority basis.<br>
In HSDPA, single carrier signal<br>
transmission is performed in a 5MHz channel<br>
bandwidth. Thus, the entire channel bandwidth of<br>
5MHz is used for data that is signal-transmitted by<br>
the shared packet channel, and assignment of<br>
transmission slots to each user is performed based<br>
on time multiplexing basically. In addition, also<br>
for a control channel for reporting which user is<br>
assigned the transmission slot and the like for<br>
realizing this shared packet channel transmission,<br>
signal transmission is performing using the entire<br><br>
-2-<br>
channel bandwidth of 5MHz.<br>
On the other hand, consideration of<br>
standardization on long term evolution (LTE) of the<br>
UMTS is started, and study of the fourth generation<br>
mobile communication scheme (4G) that is a mobile<br>
communication scheme of a next generation of 3G is<br>
being progressed. In the LTE of 3G and the 4G<br>
schemes, it is desired to flexibly support from a<br>
multi-cell environment such as cellular systems to<br>
an isolated-cell environment such as hot spot areas<br>
and indoor areas, and further desired to increase<br>
frequency use efficiency for both of the cell<br>
environments.<br>
As a radio access scheme adopted for a<br>
downlink in the LTE of 3G and the 4G schemes, it is<br>
considered that OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing) for transmitting signals using many<br>
sub-carriers is a strong candidate (refer to non-<br>
patent document 1, for example).<br>
In the OFDM, serial to parallel conversion<br>
is performed on a data series to be transmitted, so<br>
that parallel signals of the data series are<br>
transmitted using a plurality of sub-carriers.<br>
Accordingly, since a symbol rate becomes low,<br>
effects of delayed waves (multi-path) caused due to<br>
difference of propagation routes from a transmitter<br>
to a receiver is suppressed, so that it becomes<br>
possible to transmit a signal of high information<br>
rate with high quality.<br>
In addition, for supporting the multi-cell<br>
environment by the radio access scheme using the<br>
OFDM, it is desirable to apply one-cell frequency<br>
reuse for realizing large capacity. For realizing<br>
the one-cell frequency reuse, application of<br>
spreading is effective to suppress effects of<br>
interference signals using the same frequency from<br>
surrounding adjacent cells.<br><br>
-3-<br>
Thus, in OFDM (OFDM with Spreading) to<br>
which spreading is applied, as shown in Figs.lA and<br>
1B, after the input data is channel-coded and data-<br>
modulated, spreading is applied, and serial to<br>
parallel conversion and inverse Fourier conversion<br>
are performed, so that signals of multi-carriers are<br>
generated and are transmitted after a guard interval<br>
is inserted. More particularly, as a case where<br>
spreading is applied, when 8 is applied as a<br>
spreading factor for example, each symbol is spread<br>
into eight sub-carries and is transmitted. In<br>
addition, when effects of interference from<br>
surrounding cells are small, 1 is applied as a<br>
spreading factor since it is unnecessary to apply<br>
spreading, so that data D1, D2, ... that are<br>
different in each sub-carrier are transmitted.<br>
Also in OFDM or OFDM to which spreading is<br>
applied as mentioned above, the packet scheduling<br>
technique can be applied using a shared channel like<br>
one used in HSDPA, and throughput can be increased<br>
accordingly. In this case, since multi-carrier<br>
transmission is performed in OFDM for shared channel<br>
transmission, not only a method for performing<br>
transmission slot assignment to each user by time<br>
multiplexing like HSDPA is available but also it is<br>
available to assign radio resources to each user in<br>
units of a sub-carrier or in units of a frequency<br>
block in which a plurality of sub-carriers are bound<br>
(refer to non-patent document 2, for example).<br>
Therefore, when performing signal<br>
transmission using multi-carrier transmission within<br>
a channel bandwidth, a method for assigning radio<br>
resources different from one for HSDPA becomes<br>
possible.<br>
However, in order to realize actual mobile<br>
communication in OFDM or OFDM using spreading, in<br>
addition to transmitting the shared channel, it is<br><br>
-4-<br>
necessary to transmit a control channel necessary<br>
for transmitting control information of the shared<br>
channel or transmit a common control channel for<br>
transmitting system information and paging<br>
information that are transmitted to all users<br>
connected to a base station.<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Next, embodiments of the present invention<br>
are described with reference to drawings. By the<br>
way, in all drawings for explaining the embodiments,<br>
same reference signs are used for units having same<br>
function, and repeated description is not given.<br>
First, a physical channel in the downlink<br>
intended for embodiments of the present invention is<br>
described with reference to Fig.2.<br>
The physical channel in the downlink<br>
intended for the embodiments of the present<br>
invention is classified into a common control<br>
channel, a shared channel, a channel (to be referred<br>
to as control signaling channel, hereinafter) for<br>
transmitting control information of the physical<br>
layer and control information of the layer 2, and a<br>
multicast channel.<br>
The common control channel is a channel<br>
for performing transmission for the whole of a cell<br>
covered by a base station, for example, the common<br>
control channel transmits broadcast information,<br>
paging information and the like.<br>
The shared channel is for transmitting<br>
traffic data to each user, control signal data using<br>
a signal of an upper layer and the like. For<br>
example, as the control signal using the signal of<br>
the upper layer, there is ACK/NACK indicating<br>
presence or absence of a receiving error in TCP/IP.<br>
The control signaling channel transmits,<br>
as control information in the physical layer,<br><br>
-11-<br>
information of modulation scheme and coding rate in<br>
adaptive modulation, for example. In addition, the<br>
control signaling channel transmits, as control<br>
information of the physical layer, radio resource<br>
assignment information such as information<br>
indicating which symbol or sub-carrier is assigned,<br>
for example.<br>
In addition, the control signaling channel<br>
transmits, as control information of the layer 2,<br>
information of packet retransmission control, for<br>
example. In addition, the control signaling channel<br>
transmits, as control information of the layer 2,<br>
assignment information of packet scheduling, for<br>
example.<br>
The multicast channel is a channel for<br>
multicast.<br>
A transmission apparatus of an embodiment<br>
of the present invention is described with reference<br>
to Fig.3.<br>
The transmission apparatus is provided in<br>
a base station, for example, and transmits a<br>
downlink channel.<br>
The transmission apparatus 100 transmits<br>
the common control channel and the control signaling<br>
channel using an entire frequency band or at least a<br>
part of frequency bands discretely located over the<br>
entire frequency band. Accordingly, diversity<br>
effect can be obtained in a frequency domain.<br>
In addition, the transmission apparatus<br>
100 divides a time domain and a frequency domain,<br>
and transmits the shared channel based on packet<br>
scheduling for assigning a part corresponding to<br>
good receiving status to a user. Accordingly, multi<br>
-user diversity effect can be obtained.<br>
In addition, the transmission apparatus<br>
100 may transmit the shared channel based on packet<br>
scheduling of the time domain using the entire<br><br>
-12-<br>
channel band. Accordingly, frequency diversity<br>
effect can be obtained.<br>
The transmission apparatus 100 includes a<br>
common control channel signal generation unit 110, a<br>
control signaling channel signal generation unit 120,<br>
a shared channel signal generation unit 130, a radio<br>
resource assignment unit 140 connected to the common<br>
control channel signal generation unit 110, the<br>
control signaling channel generation unit 120 and<br>
the shared channel signal generation unit 130, an<br>
IFFT unit 150 connected to the radio resource<br>
assignment unit 140, and a guard interval inserting<br>
unit 160 connected to the IFFT unit 150.<br>
The common control channel signal<br>
generation unit 110 includes a channel coding unit<br>
102 to which transmission data sent by the common<br>
control channel is supplied, a data modulation unit<br>
104 connected to the channel coding unit 102, and a<br>
spreading unit 106 connected to the data modulation<br>
unit 104. The spreading unit 106 is connected to<br>
the radio resource assignment unit 140.<br>
The shared channel signal generation unit<br>
130 includes a packet scheduling unit 128 to which<br>
data from each user is supplied, a channel coding<br>
unit 122 connected to the packet scheduling unit 128,<br>
a data modulation unit 124 connected to the channel<br>
coding unit 122, and a spreading unit 124 connected<br>
to the data modulation unit 124. The spreading unit<br>
126 is connected to the radio resource assignment<br>
unit 140.<br>
The control signaling channel signal<br>
generation unit 120 includes a channel coding unit<br>
112 connected to the packet scheduling unit 128 as a<br>
scheduling means, a data modulation unit 114<br>
connected to the channel coding unit 112, a<br>
spreading unit 116 connected to the data modulation<br>
unit 114. The spreading unit 116 is connected to<br><br>
-13-<br>
the radio resource assignment unit 140.<br>
Data from each user is supplied to the<br>
packet scheduling unit 128. In the packet<br>
scheduling unit 128, packet scheduling is performed<br>
for selecting a user to be assigned to the shared<br>
channel based on feedback information indicating<br>
radio status sent from each user (receiving station).<br>
For example, the packet scheduling unit 128 divides<br>
the time domain and the frequency domain to assign a<br>
part where the radio status is good to a user.<br>
In addition, the packet scheduling unit<br>
128 determines a channel coding rate and a data<br>
modulation scheme for the selected user. In<br>
addition, the packet scheduling unit 128 determines<br>
a spreading factor for the selected user. For<br>
example, the packet scheduling unit 128 determines<br>
the data modulation scheme and the data coding rate<br>
based on information indicating data modulation<br>
schemes and coding rates for receiving quality<br>
levels shown in Fig.4 so as to perform transmission<br>
most efficiently according to an algorithm set<br>
beforehand.<br>
The information indicating the data<br>
modulation schemes and the coding rates for the<br>
receiving quality levels are defined such that, the<br>
better the receiving quality level is, the greater a<br>
modulation level of the data modulation scheme is<br>
and the larger the coding rate is. For example, as<br>
the data modulation scheme, QPSK, 16QAM, and QAM are<br>
defined as the receiving quality becomes better. As<br>
the coding rate, increasing values form 1/9 to 3/4<br>
are defined as the receiving quality level becomes<br>
better. The data modulation scheme and the coding<br>
rate defined here are changed according to an<br>
environment, cell and the like where the<br>
transmission apparatus is installed.<br>
In addition, the packet scheduling unit<br><br>
-14-<br>
128 supplies, to the channel coding unit 112, the<br>
data modulation unit 124 and the spreading unit 126,<br>
information obtained by packet scheduling that is,<br>
for example, a user ID indicating a selected user<br>
and information, as control information, indicating<br>
at least one of a spreading factor to be used for<br>
transmission for the user, a channel coding rate and<br>
a data modulation scheme.<br>
In addition, the packet scheduling unit<br>
128 supplies transmission data of a user selected by<br>
the packet scheduling to the channel coding unit 122,<br>
and the information is supplied to the data<br>
modulation unit 124.<br>
The channel coding unit 122 performs<br>
channel coding on the transmission data according to<br>
the channel coding rate selected by the packet<br>
scheduling unit and supplies the transmission data<br>
to the data modulation unit 124.<br>
The data modulation unit 124 performs data<br>
modulation on the transmission data on which channel<br>
coding has been performed according to the data<br>
modulation scheme selected by the packet scheduling<br>
unit 128, and supplies the data to the spreading<br>
unit 126.<br>
The spreading unit 126 spreads the<br>
transmission data on which data modulation has been<br>
performed with the spreading factor selected by the<br>
packet scheduling unit 128, and supplies the data to<br>
the radio resource assignment unit 140.<br>
On the other hand, control information<br>
supplied to the channel coding unit 112 by the<br>
packet scheduling unit 128 is channel-coded<br>
according to a channel coding rate set beforehand in<br>
the channel coding unit 112, and the control<br>
information is supplied to the data modulation unit<br>
114.<br>
The data modulation unit 114 performs data<br><br>
-15-<br>
modulation on the control information to which<br>
channel coding has been performed according to a<br>
data modulation scheme set beforehand, and supplies<br>
the control information to the spreading unit 116.<br>
The spreading unit 116 spreads the control<br>
information on which data modulation has been<br>
performed according to the spreading factor set<br>
beforehand, and supplies the control information to<br>
the radio resource assignment unit 140.<br>
In addition, information transmitted by<br>
the common control channel is supplied to the<br>
channel coding unit 102, so that channel coding is<br>
performed according to a channel coding rate set<br>
beforehand, and the information is supplied to the<br>
data modulation unit 104.<br>
The data modulation unit 104 performs data<br>
modulation on transmission data on which channel<br>
coding has been performed, and supplies the<br>
transmission data to the spreading unit 106.<br>
The spreading unit 116 spreads the<br>
transmission data on which data modulation has been<br>
performed according to a spreading factor set<br>
beforehand, and supplies the transmission data to<br>
the radio resource assignment unit 140.<br>
The channel coding rate used by the<br>
channel coding units 102 and 112, the data<br>
modulation schemes used by the data modulation units<br>
104 and 114, and the spreading factors used by the<br>
spreading units 106 and 116 are changeable according<br>
to an environment and a cell (sector).<br>
The radio resource assignment unit 140<br>
assigns radio resources to the common control<br>
channel, the control signaling channel and the<br>
shared channel.<br>
Descriptions are provided with reference<br>
to Fig.5.<br>
For example, when assigning radio<br><br>
-16-<br>
resources to the common control channel and the<br>
control signaling channel, as shown in configuration<br>
1, the radio resource assignment unit 140 divides an<br>
entire frequency band assigned to the system into<br>
sub-carrier blocks each formed by one or more sub-<br>
carriers, and assigns at least a sub-carrier block<br>
to a transmission slot indicating a unit (TTI:<br>
Transmission Time Interval) of packet transmission.<br>
In addition, when assigning radio<br>
resources to the shared channel, the radio resource<br>
assignment unit 140 assigns radio resources other<br>
than those assigned to the common control channel<br>
and the control signaling channel. Accordingly, as<br>
to the common control channel and the control<br>
signaling channel, mapping to discrete frequency<br>
domains over the entire frequency band is performed,<br>
so that receiving quality in the receiver can be<br>
improved due to frequency diversity effect.<br>
In addition, as shown in configuration 2,<br>
when assigning radio resources to the common control<br>
channel and the control signaling channel, the radio<br>
resource assignment unit 140 may assign, to the<br>
common control channel and the control signaling<br>
channel, at least a part of a plurality of symbols<br>
forming the transmission slot that indicates the<br>
unit (TTI: Transmission Time Interval) of<br>
transmission in packet transmission.<br>
Also in this case, when assigning radio<br>
resources to the shared channel, the radio resource<br>
assignment unit 140 assigns symbols other than the<br>
symbols to which the common control channel or the<br>
control signaling channel is assigned. Accordingly,<br>
since the common control channel and the control<br>
signaling channel can be mapped over the entire<br>
frequency band, receiving quality of the receiver<br>
can be improved due to frequency diversity effect.<br>
In addition, as shown in configuration 3,<br><br>
-17-<br>
when assigning radio resources to the common control<br>
channel and the control signaling channel, the radio<br>
resource assignment unit 140 divides the entire<br>
frequency band assigned to the system into sub-<br>
carrier blocks each formed by one or more sub-<br>
carriers in the frequency axis direction, and<br>
divides in units of a plurality of OFDM symbols in<br>
the time axis direction, so as to form frequency<br>
blocks using a plurality of sub-carriers and a<br>
plurality of OFDM symbols.<br>
The radio resource assignment unit 140 may<br>
select at least one of a plurality of frequency<br>
blocks to assign it to the common control channel<br>
and the control signaling channel. In addition, the<br>
radio resource assignment unit 140 may assign at<br>
least a part of a plurality of OFDM symbols forming<br>
the frequency block to the common control channel<br>
and the control signaling channel.<br>
Also in this case, when assigning the<br>
radio resources to the shared channel, the radio<br>
resource assignment unit 140 may assign at least one<br>
of symbols and frequency blocks other than symbols<br>
assigned to the common control channel and the<br>
control signaling channel. Accordingly, since the<br>
common control channel and the control signaling<br>
channel can be mapped to discrete frequency domains<br>
in the entire frequency band, receiving quality in<br>
the receiver can be improved due to the frequency<br>
diversity effect.<br>
The IFFT unit 150 performs inverse fast<br>
Fourier transform on the input signal to perform<br>
modulation of the OFDM scheme.<br>
The GI adding unit 160 adds a guard<br>
interval to a signal to be transmitted to generate a<br>
symbol of the OFDM scheme. The guard interval is<br>
obtained by copying a part of a head or an end of a<br>
symbol to be transmitted.<br><br>
-18-<br>
In the following, assignment of radio<br>
resources is described concretely for each of the<br>
common control channel, the control signaling<br>
channel and the shared channel.<br>
First, radio resource assignment for the<br>
common control channel is described with reference<br>
to Figs.6A-6L.<br>
The common control channel is information<br>
directed to all users in a cell. In addition, it is<br>
necessary that the users in the cell can receive the<br>
information with required spatial probability and<br>
with required quality, for example, with a<br>
predetermined error rate. Thus, when transmission<br>
is performed using only a narrow frequency band in<br>
the entire frequency band, receiving status in the<br>
frequency is different for each user and there is a<br>
risk that there occurs a user for whom receiving<br>
status is bad depending on circumstances. In<br>
addition, since the information is directed to all<br>
users, usage of performing assignment with packet<br>
scheduling to perform signal transmission is not<br>
possible.<br>
Therefore, in the common control channel,<br>
packet scheduling is not applied, and the channel is<br>
assigned to the entire frequency band or at least a<br>
part of frequency bands discretely placed over the<br>
entire frequency band. Accordingly, frequency<br>
diversity effect can be obtained.<br>
For example, when assigning radio<br>
resources to the common control channel, as shown in<br>
Fig.6A, the common control channel is assigned to at<br>
least one transmission slot, and transmission is<br>
performed using the entire frequency band in the<br>
assigned transmission slot. By using the entire<br>
frequency band in this way, receiving quality in the<br>
receiver can be improved due to frequency diversity<br>
effect.<br><br>
-19-<br>
In addition, when assigning radio<br>
resources to the common control channel, as shown in<br>
Fig.6B, the entire frequency band assigned to the<br>
system is divided into sub-carrier blocks each<br>
formed by a plurality of sub-carriers, and the<br>
common control channel is sequentially mapped to at<br>
least one of the sub-carrier blocks. By performing<br>
mapping in the frequency direction in this way,<br>
receiving quality in the receiver can be improved<br>
due to frequency diversity effect.<br>
In addition, when assigning radio<br>
resources to the common control channel, as shown in<br>
Fig.6C, the configurations 1 and 2 are combined so<br>
that the common control channel is mapped to at<br>
least one sub-carrier block in at least one<br>
transmission slot. By performing mapping in the<br>
frequency direction in this way, receiving quality<br>
in the receiver can be improved due to frequency<br>
diversity effect.<br>
In addition, when assigning radio<br>
resources to the common control channel, as shown in<br>
Fig.6D, the common control channel is assigned to a<br>
part of symbols in at least one transmission slot,<br>
and transmission is performed using the entire<br>
frequency band in the symbol to which assignment is<br>
performed. Accordingly, by using the entire<br>
frequency band, receiving quality in the receiver<br>
can be improved due to frequency diversity effect.<br>
In addition, when assigning radio<br>
resources to the common control channel, as shown in<br>
Fig.6E, the entire frequency band assigned to the<br>
system is divided into sub-carrier blocks each<br>
formed by a plurality of sub-carriers, and the<br>
common control channel is sequentially mapped to a<br>
part of sub-carriers in at least one sub-carrier<br>
block. By performing mapping in the frequency<br>
direction in this way, receiving quality in the<br><br>
-20-<br>
receiver can be improved due to frequency diversity<br>
effect.<br>
In addition, when assigning radio<br>
resources to the common control channel, as shown in<br>
Fig.6F, the configurations 3 and 4 are combined to<br>
map the common control channel into a part of sub-<br>
carriers in at least one sub-carrier block in a part<br>
of symbols in at least one transmission slot. By<br>
performing mapping in the frequency direction in<br>
this way, receiving quality in the receiver can be<br>
improved due to frequency diversity effect.<br>
In addition, when assigning radio<br>
resources to the common control channel, as shown in<br>
Fig.6G, the common control channel is mapped to a<br>
part of symbols in at least one sub-carrier block in<br>
at least one transmission slot. In this case, in<br>
each transmission slot, the common control channel<br>
to be mapped is placed such that the position is<br>
different in at least a part of sub-carrier blocks.<br>
By mapping the common control channel in the<br>
frequency direction and the time axis direction in<br>
this way, receiving quality in the receiver can be<br>
improved due to time diversity effect in addition to<br>
the frequency diversity effect. For example, when<br>
the receiver is moving at high speed, there is a<br>
case where receiving quality in a frequency falls<br>
down at a certain instant. In such a case, by<br>
performing mapping such that the position of the<br>
common control channel to be mapped to each sub-<br>
carrier block is different in at least a part of<br>
sub-carrier blocks, the time diversity effect can be<br>
obtained so that receiving quality can be improved.<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig.6H, when<br>
assigning the radio resources to the common control<br>
channel, the transmission slot described in Fig.6G<br>
may be transmitted a predetermined number of times<br>
at intervals of a predetermined time. Accordingly,<br><br>
-21-<br>
by transmitting a same transmission slot a plurality<br>
of number of times, receiving quality in the<br>
receiver can be improved due to the time diversity<br>
effect in addition to the frequency diversity effect.<br>
In this case, the time interval by which the<br>
transmission slot is sent is adaptively controlled<br>
according to the environment. For example, the<br>
transmission interval is set to be long in an<br>
environment like an office where movement is small,<br>
and the transmission interval is set to be short in<br>
an environment like a city where movement is large.<br>
In addition, mapping may be performed such that a<br>
position of the common control channel to be mapped<br>
to a part of symbols of at least one sub-carrier<br>
block in a transmission slot to be transmitted<br>
secondly or later is different from a position of<br>
previously transmitted common control channel.<br>
The position of the common control channel<br>
in each sub-carrier block described in Figs.6G and<br>
6H is determined fixedly beforehand based on a<br>
predetermined rule as shown in Fig.61. In addition,<br>
the position of the common control channel in each<br>
sub-carrier block may be randomly determined in each<br>
sub-carrier block as shown in Fig.6J.<br>
In addition, in Fig.6H, as shown in Fig.6K,<br>
information same as one transmitted first is<br>
transmitted by the common control channel<br>
transmitted secondly or later. In this case,<br>
demodulation processing is performed in the receiver,<br>
and it is determined whether there is a demodulation<br>
error. When there is no demodulation error, the<br>
receiver is controlled such that it does not receive<br>
the common control channel transmitted secondly or<br>
later. When there is a demodulation error, the<br>
information is discarded, and the common control<br>
channel transmitted secondly or later is demodulated<br>
again (no packet combining, Type-I).<br><br>
-22-<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig.6L, when<br>
there is a demodulation error, the information may<br>
not be discarded so as to perform packet combining<br>
for the common control channel transmitted secondly<br>
or later and the common control channel received<br>
previously to demodulate again (packet combining<br>
exists, Type-I). Accordingly, receiving SIR can be<br>
improved.<br>
In addition, in Fig.6H, the common control<br>
channel transmitted secondly or later may be for<br>
transmitting information different from one in the<br>
first transition. For example, the common control<br>
channel transmitted secondly or later may be<br>
configured to transmit a packet on which puncturing<br>
is performed with a pattern different from a pattern<br>
for the first transmission (packet combining exists,<br>
Type-II). In this case, demodulation processing is<br>
performed in the receiver side, and it is determined<br>
whether there is a demodulation error. When there<br>
is no demodulation error, the receiver is controlled<br>
such that it does not receive the common control<br>
channel transmitted thirdly or later. When there is<br>
a demodulation error, the information may not be<br>
discarded, and packet combining may be performed for<br>
the common control channel transmitted secondly or<br>
later and the common control channel received<br>
previously to demodulate again. Accordingly, coding<br>
gain can be improved.<br>
In addition, in Fig.6H, the common control<br>
channel transmitted secondly or later may be<br>
configured to transmit information different from<br>
one sent first. For example, information indicating<br>
the common control channel is divided into two or<br>
more, and the divided information is transmitted.<br>
When information is stored in the common control<br>
channel transmitted first and redundancy code is<br>
stored in the common control channel transmitted<br><br>
-23-<br>
secondly or later, the common control channel<br>
transmitted secondly or later cannot be decoded when<br>
receiving of the common control channel transmitted<br>
first is failed.<br>
In such a case, by dividing information<br>
indicating the common control channel into two or<br>
more, receiving quality in the receiver can be<br>
improved due to time diversity effect. In this case,<br>
a transmission slot for transmitting information<br>
indicating the common control channel by dividing it<br>
and a packet storing the redundancy code may be<br>
transmitted.<br>
In this case, it is necessary to determine<br>
a number of division of the common control channel<br>
beforehand in the transmitter and the receiver. As<br>
information to be determined beforehand, a packet<br>
number for performing packet combining, a puncture<br>
pattern, constellation, and a bit indicating new or<br>
retransmitted packet are necessary. The bit<br>
indicating a new or retransmitted packet is<br>
necessary for avoiding incorrect combining<br>
considering ACK/NACK bit error.<br>
Next, assignment of radio resources to the<br>
control signaling channel is described with<br>
reference to Figs.7A-7L.<br>
The control signaling channel is a signal<br>
transmitted for each user scheduled by the packet<br>
scheduling unit 128, and it is necessary for<br>
specific many users who desire scheduling in the<br>
cell to be able to receive the signal with a<br>
required spatial probability and a required quality,<br>
that is, with a predetermined error rate, for<br>
example. Therefore, the channel is assigned to the<br>
entire frequency band or at least a part of the<br>
entire frequency band that is discretely located<br>
over the entire frequency band without applying<br>
packet scheduling. Accordingly, frequency diversity<br><br>
-24-<br>
effect can be obtained.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig.7A, when<br>
assigning radio resources to the control signaling<br>
channel, the control signaling channel is assigned<br>
to at least one transmission slot, and transmission<br>
is performed using all of the entire frequency band<br>
in the assigned transmission slot. By using the<br>
entire frequency band in this way, receiving quality<br>
in the receiver can be improved due to frequency<br>
diversity effect.<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig.7B, when<br>
assigning the radio resources to the control<br>
signaling channel, the entire frequency band<br>
assigned to the system is divided into sub-carrier<br>
blocks each formed by a plurality of sub-carriers so<br>
that the control signaling channel is mapped<br>
sequentially to at least one sub-carrier block. By<br>
performing mapping in the frequency direction in<br>
this way, receiving quality in the receiver can be<br>
improved due to the frequency diversity effect.<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig.7C, when<br>
assigning the radio resources to the control<br>
signaling channel, Fig.7A and Fig.7B are combined so<br>
that the control signaling channel is mapped to at<br>
least one sub-carrier block in at least one<br>
transmission slot. By performing mapping in the<br>
frequency direction in this way, receiving quality<br>
in the receiver can be improved due to frequency<br>
diversity effect.<br>
In addition, when assigning radio<br>
resources to the control signaling channel, as shown<br>
in Fig.7D, the control signaling channel is assigned<br>
to a part of symbols in at least one transmission<br>
slot, and transmission is performed using the entire<br>
frequency band in the symbol to which assignment is<br>
performed. By using the entire frequency band in<br>
this way, receiving quality in the receiver can be<br><br>
-25-<br>
improved due to frequency diversity effect.<br>
In addition, when assigning radio<br>
resources to the control signaling channel, as shown<br>
in Fig.7E, the entire frequency band assigned to the<br>
system is divided into sub-carrier blocks each<br>
formed by a plurality of sub-carriers, and the<br>
control signaling channel is sequentially mapped to<br>
a part of sub-carriers in at least one sub-carrier<br>
block. By performing mapping in the frequency<br>
direction in this way, receiving quality in the<br>
receiver can be improved due to frequency diversity<br>
effect.<br>
In addition, when assigning radio<br>
resources to the control signaling channel, as shown<br>
in Fig.7F, Fig.7C and Fig.7D are combined to map the<br>
control signaling channel into a part of sub-<br>
carriers in at least one sub-carrier block in a part<br>
of symbols in at least one transmission slot. By<br>
performing mapping in the frequency direction in<br>
this way, receiving quality in the receiver can be<br>
improved due to frequency diversity effect.<br>
In addition, when assigning radio<br>
resources to the control signaling channel, as shown<br>
in Fig.7G, the control signaling channel is mapped<br>
to a part of symbols in at least one sub-carrier<br>
block in at least one transmission slot. In this<br>
case, in each transmission slot, the control<br>
signaling channel to be mapped is placed such that<br>
the position is different in at least a part of sub-<br>
carrier blocks. By mapping the control signaling<br>
channel in the frequency direction and the time axis<br>
direction in this way, receiving quality in the<br>
receiver can be improved due to time diversity<br>
effect in addition to the frequency diversity effect<br>
For example, when the receiver is moving at high<br>
speed, there is a case where receiving quality in a<br>
frequency falls down at a certain instant. In such<br><br>
-26-<br>
a case, by performing mapping such that the position<br>
of the control signaling channel to be mapped to<br>
each sub-carrier block is different in at least a<br>
part of sub-carrier blocks, the time diversity<br>
effect can be obtained so that receiving quality can<br>
be improved.<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig.7H, when<br>
assigning the radio resources to the control<br>
signaling channel, the transmission slot described<br>
in Fig.7G may be transmitted a predetermined number<br>
of times at intervals of a predetermined time. By<br>
transmitting a same transmission slot a plurality of<br>
number of times in this way, receiving quality in<br>
the receiver can be improved due to the time<br>
diversity effect in addition to the frequency<br>
diversity effect. In this case, the time interval<br>
by which the transmission slot is sent is adaptively<br>
controlled according to the environment. For<br>
example, the transmission interval is set to be long<br>
in an environment like an office where movement is<br>
small, and the transmission interval is set to be<br>
short in an environment like a city where movement<br>
is large. In addition, mapping may be performed<br>
such that a position of the control signaling<br>
channel to be mapped to a part of symbols of at<br>
least one sub-carrier block in a transmission slot<br>
to be transmitted secondly or later is different<br>
from a position of previously transmitted control<br>
signaling channel.<br>
The position of the control signaling<br>
channel in each sub-carrier block described in<br>
Figs.7G and 7H is determined fixedly beforehand<br>
based on a predetermined rule as shown in Fig.71.<br>
In addition, the position of the control signaling<br>
channel in each sub-carrier block may be randomly<br>
determined in each sub-carrier as shown in Fig.7J.<br>
In addition, in Fig.7H, as shown in Fig.7K,<br><br>
-27-<br>
information same as one transmitted first is<br>
transmitted by the control signaling channel<br>
transmitted secondly or later. In this case,<br>
demodulation processing is performed in the receiver,<br>
and it is determined whether there is a demodulation<br>
error. When there is no demodulation error, the<br>
receiver is controlled such that it does not receive<br>
the control signaling channel transmitted secondly<br>
or later. When there is a demodulation error, the<br>
information is discarded, and the control signaling<br>
channel transmitted secondly or later is demodulated<br>
again (no packet combining, Type-I).<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig.7L, when<br>
there is a demodulation error, the information may<br>
not be discarded so as to perform packet combining<br>
for the control signaling channel transmitted<br>
secondly or later and the control signaling channel<br>
received previously to demodulate again (packet<br>
combining exists, Type-I). Accordingly, receiving<br>
SIR can be improved.<br>
In addition, in Fig.7H, the control<br>
signaling channel transmitted secondly or later may<br>
be for transmitting information different from one<br>
in the first transition. For example, the control<br>
signaling channel transmitted secondly or later may<br>
be configured to transmit a packet on which<br>
puncturing is performed with a pattern different<br>
from a pattern for the first transmission (packet<br>
combining exists, Type-II). In this case,<br>
demodulation processing is performed in the receiver<br>
side, and it is determined whether there is a<br>
demodulation error. When there is no demodulation<br>
error, the receiver is controlled such that it does<br>
not receive the control signaling channel<br>
transmitted thirdly or later. When there is a<br>
demodulation error, the information may not be<br>
discarded, and packet combining may be performed for<br><br>
-28-<br>
the control signaling channel transmitted secondly<br>
or later and the control signaling channel received<br>
previously to demodulate again. Accordingly, coding<br>
gain can be improved.<br>
In addition, in Fig.7H, the control<br>
signaling channel transmitted secondly or later may<br>
be configured to transmit information different from<br>
one sent first. For example, information indicating<br>
the control signaling channel is divided into two or<br>
more, and the divided information is transmitted.<br>
When information is stored in the control signaling<br>
channel transmitted first and redundancy code is<br>
stored in the control signaling channel transmitted<br>
secondly or later, the control signaling channel<br>
transmitted secondly or later cannot be decoded when<br>
receiving of the control signaling channel<br>
transmitted first is failed.<br>
In such a case, by dividing information<br>
indicating the control signaling channel into two or<br>
more, receiving quality in the receiver can be<br>
improved due to time diversity effect. In this case,<br>
a transmission slot for transmitting information<br>
indicating the control signaling channel by dividing<br>
it and a packet storing the redundancy code may be<br>
transmitted.<br>
In this case, it is necessary to determine<br>
a number of division of the control signaling<br>
channel beforehand in the transmitter and the<br>
receiver. As information to be determined<br>
beforehand, a packet number for performing packet<br>
combining, a puncture pattern, constellation, and a<br>
bit indicating new or retransmitted packet are<br>
necessary. The bit indicating a new or<br>
retransmitted packet is necessary for avoiding<br>
incorrect combining considering ACK/NACK bit error.<br>
As mentioned above, cases where radio<br>
resources are assigned to the common control channel<br><br>
-29-<br>
and the control signaling channel are described so<br>
far.<br>
Next, a method for assigning radio<br>
resources to a plurality of common control channels<br>
and control signaling channels is described.<br>
In this embodiment, descriptions are<br>
provided for each of a case where time multiplexing<br>
is applied, a case where frequency multiplexing is<br>
additionally used and a case where code multiplexing<br>
is additionally used.<br>
First, a case where time multiplexing is<br>
applied is described.<br>
In this case, as shown in Fig.8, the<br>
transmission apparatus is configured by a common<br>
control channel signal generation unit 110 to which<br>
transmission data to be transmitted by the common<br>
control channel as a channel #1 is supplied, a<br>
control signaling channel signal generation unit 120<br>
to which control information is supplied from the<br>
packet scheduling unit 128 as a channel #2, a radio<br>
resource assignment unit 140, an IFFT unit 150 and a<br>
guard interval insertion unit 160.<br>
The radio resource assignment unit 140<br>
includes a switching unit 131 connected to spreading<br>
units 106 and 116, a switching control unit 132 and<br>
a serial to parallel conversion unit 133 connected<br>
to the switching unit 131. The serial to parallel<br>
conversion unit 133 is connected to the IFFT unit<br>
150.<br>
The switching control unit 132 performs<br>
control so as to switch channels to be transmitted<br>
for each symbol or each transmission slot. The<br>
switching unit 131 timely switches channels to be<br>
transmitted according to a control signal from the<br>
switching control unit 132 to supply signals to the<br>
serial to parallel conversion unit 133.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig.9A, the<br><br>
-30-<br>
switching control unit 132 divides the time domain<br>
into a plurality of domains in an assigned frequency<br>
block, and performs switching so as to assign<br>
physical channels of a plurality of common control<br>
channels and control signaling channels in the<br>
divided time domains. For example, the switching<br>
control unit 132 performs switching so as to assign<br>
a plurality of physical channels of the common<br>
control channels and the control signaling channels<br>
in units of symbols included in the divided time<br>
domains, for example, for each of channels #1, #2,<br>
#3, ... .<br>
In this case, radio resources to which any<br>
of the common control channel and the control<br>
signaling channel is not assigned are assigned<br>
another physical channel such as an after-mentioned<br>
shared channel, for example.<br>
Accordingly, by using at least one<br>
frequency block and by assigning a plurality of<br>
common control channels and the control signaling<br>
channels at a symbol level, receiving quality can be<br>
improved due to frequency diversity effect.<br>
In addition, for example, as shown in<br>
Fig.9B, the switching control unit 134 may perform<br>
switching, for each transmission slot, so as to<br>
assign a plurality of physical channels, as channels<br>
#1, #2, for example, including the common control<br>
channels, the control signaling channels or both of<br>
them to a predetermined OFDM symbol of frequency<br>
blocks included in the transmission slot.<br>
In this case, radio resources to which any<br>
of the common control channel and the control<br>
signaling channel is not assigned are assigned<br>
another physical channel such as an after-mentioned<br>
shared channel, for example. Accordingly, by<br>
assigning a plurality of common control channels,<br>
control signaling channels or both of them, the<br><br>
-31-<br>
common control channels and the control signaling<br>
channels can be transmitted using the entire band,<br>
so that receiving quality can be improved due to<br>
frequency diversity effect.<br>
Next, a case where frequency multiplexing<br>
is used together is described. In this case, a<br>
transmission method is described in a case where the<br>
frequency multiplexing is used together with the<br>
time multiplexing when the number of physical<br>
channels that can be multiplexed is small by<br>
applying only the before-mentioned time multiplexing.<br>
The transmission apparatus in the case<br>
where frequency multiplexing is used together is<br>
different from the transmission apparatus described<br>
with reference Fig.8 in that the configuration of<br>
the radio resource assignment unit 140 is different.<br>
The radio assignment unit 140 includes a sub-carrier<br>
mapping unit 134 connected to spreading units 106<br>
and 116, and a sub-carrier mapping control unit 135<br>
connected to the sub-carrier mapping unit 134. The<br>
sub-carrier mapping unit 134 is connected to the<br>
IFFT unit 150.<br>
The sub-carrier mapping control unit 135<br>
determines sub-carriers for mapping common control<br>
channels and control signaling channels, and<br>
supplies the result to the sub-carrier mapping unit<br>
134. The sub-carrier mapping unit 134 performs<br>
mapping for the common control channels and control<br>
signaling channels based on the supplied information<br>
on the sub-carriers.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig.llA, the sub-<br>
carrier mapping control unit 135 divides a frequency<br>
band of each frequency block into a plurality of<br>
bands to assign the common control channels and the<br>
control signaling channels in units of divided band.<br>
Further, the sub-carrier mapping control unit 135<br>
may divide the time domain of the frequency blocks<br><br>
-32-<br>
into a plurality of domains to change the common<br>
control channels and the control signaling channels<br>
to be assigned to each divided time domain in a time<br>
division manner.<br>
For example, when dividing a frequency<br>
band in each of selected frequency blocks into two<br>
bands and dividing a transmission slot into three,<br>
the sub-carrier mapping control unit 135 assigns the<br>
common control channels, control signaling channels<br>
or both of them to the divided blocks, for example,<br>
to channels #1, #2, #3, ... #6.<br>
By using a plurality of frequency blocks<br>
in this way, and by assigning the common control<br>
channels and the control signaling channels to<br>
bands divided from the frequency band in each<br>
frequency block, the receiving quality in the<br>
receiver can be improved due to frequency diversity<br>
effect.<br>
In addition, for example, as shown in<br>
Fig.llB, the sub-carrier mapping control unit 135<br>
may assign, at a transmission slot level, the common<br>
control channels, the control signaling channels or<br>
both of them to a predetermined OFDM symbol of<br>
frequency blocks included in the transmission slot,<br>
as channels #1, #2, #3, and #4 for example.<br>
For example, the sub-carrier mapping<br>
control unit 135 assigns the common control channels,<br>
the control signaling channels or both of them to a<br>
predetermined OFDM symbol in assigned frequency<br>
blocks. In this case, radio resources to which any<br>
of the common control channel and the control<br>
signaling channel is not assigned are assigned<br>
another physical channel such as an after-mentioned<br>
shared channel, and switching is performed in a time<br>
division manner.<br>
Accordingly, by assigning the common<br>
control channels, the control signaling channels or<br><br>
-33-<br>
both of them at the frequency block level, the<br>
common control channels and the control signaling<br>
channels can be transmitted using discrete parts<br>
over the entire band, so that receiving quality can<br>
be improved due to frequency diversity effect.<br>
Next, a case where code multiplexing is<br>
used together is described.<br>
The transmission apparatus in the case<br>
where code multiplexing is used together is<br>
different from the transmission apparatus described<br>
with reference to Fig.8 in that the configuration of<br>
the radio resource assignment unit 140 is different.<br>
The radio assignment unit 140 includes a code<br>
multiplexing unit 137 connected to spreading units<br>
106 and 116, and a code multiplexing control unit<br>
136 connected to the code multiplexing unit 137.<br>
The code multiplexing unit 137 is connected to the<br>
IFFT unit 150.<br>
The code multiplexing control unit 136<br>
performs control for code-multiplexing output<br>
signals, from the spreading units 106 and 116, that<br>
are spread with different spreading codes. The code<br>
multiplexing unit 137 performs code multiplexing on<br>
input channels.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig.13, the code<br>
multiplexing control unit 136 assigns each of the<br>
common control channels, the control signaling<br>
channels or both of them as channels #1, #2 for<br>
example, to a predetermined OFDM symbol in OFDM<br>
symbols included in a transmission slot at a<br>
transmission slot level, so as to perform code<br>
multiplexing.<br>
In this case, radio resources to which any<br>
of the common control channel and the control<br>
signaling channel is not assigned are assigned<br>
another physical channel such as an after-mentioned<br>
shared channel for example.<br><br>
-34-<br>
Accordingly, by using a plurality of<br>
frequency blocks to perform code-multiplexing for<br>
the common control channel and the control signaling<br>
channel, receiving quality can be improved due to<br>
frequency diversity effect.<br>
Next, assignment of radio resources for<br>
the shared channel is described.<br>
Since the shared channel is information<br>
directed to each user, packet scheduling can be<br>
applied. As to the frequency axis direction, the<br>
radio resource assignment unit 140 divides the<br>
entire frequency band assigned to the system in<br>
units of one sub-carrier or a plurality of sub-<br>
carriers, as to the time axis direction, the radio<br>
resource assignment unit 140 divides in units of one<br>
or a plurality of OFDM symbols, and divides the code<br>
axis direction in units of one or a plurality of<br>
codes, so that each frequency block is configured by<br>
one or a plurality sub-carries, one or a plurality<br>
of OFDM symbols, and one or a plurality of codes,<br>
and radio resources are assigned in units of the<br>
frequency block.<br>
In addition, the radio resource assignment<br>
unit 140 performs packet scheduling for the time<br>
domain and the frequency domain to select at least<br>
one frequency block from among a plurality of<br>
frequency blocks. The result of packet scheduling<br>
is reported to a receiving station.<br>
In addition, the radio resource assignment<br>
unit 140 assigns optimum frequency blocks based on<br>
feedback information, from the receiving station,<br>
that is a receiving channel status for example, that<br>
is a receiving SIR, for example.<br>
Accordingly, frequency blocks to be<br>
assigned to each user can be dynamically changed, so<br>
that frequency blocks corresponding to good channel<br>
status can be assigned. Accordingly, receiving<br><br>
-35-<br>
characteristics in the receiver can be improved due<br>
to a multi-user diversity effect.<br>
As an example, a case where the number of<br>
users is eight is described with reference to Fig.14.<br>
That is, a case is described where shared channels<br>
for the eight users are assigned to radio resources.<br>
The radio resource assignment unit 140<br>
divides the entire frequency band assigned to the<br>
system into eight, for example, to form frequency<br>
blocks, and perform radio resource assignment for<br>
each transmission slot according to receiving status<br>
of each user. Here, the frequency block is a radio<br>
resource assignment unit formed when dividing the<br>
system band into a plurality of bands in each<br>
transmission slot.<br>
In addition, for example, when information<br>
amounts to be transmitted for each user are<br>
different, the radio resource assignment unit 140<br>
may assign the frequency block according to a data<br>
rate. For example, the frequency block is assigned<br>
according to a signal of a high data rate that is,<br>
for example, download of a large sized file, and a<br>
signal of a low transmission rate such as voice. In<br>
this case, in the case of the high data rate, "size<br>
of a packet desired to be transmitted" becomes<br>
larger than the size of the frequency block. In the<br>
case of the low data rate, "size of a packet desired<br>
to be transmitted" becomes smaller than the size of<br>
the frequency block.<br>
A case where radio resources are assigned<br>
to a user of the high data rate is described with<br>
reference to Fig.15.<br>
In the case of the high data rate, since<br>
"size of a packet desired to be transmitted" is<br>
larger than the size of the frequency block, the<br>
radio resource assignment unit 140 assigns a<br>
plurality of frequency blocks (chunks) in a<br><br>
-36-<br>
transmission slot. For example, for a user #1 of<br>
the high data rate, three frequency blocks are<br>
assigned in a transmission slot, and four frequency<br>
blocks are assigned in another transmission slot.<br>
Next, a case where radio resources are<br>
assigned to a user of the low data rate is described<br>
with reference to Fig.16.<br>
In the case of the low data rate, since<br>
"size of a packet desired to be transmitted" is<br>
smaller than the size of the frequency block, the<br>
radio resource assignment unit 140 assigns a batch<br>
of users of low data rate to one frequency block.<br>
For the user of the low data rate, since the "size<br>
of a packet desired to be transmitted" is smaller<br>
than the size of the frequency block, one block<br>
cannot be filled with information to be transmitted.<br>
However, it wastes radio resources to use only a<br>
part of the frequency block and keep remaining part<br>
empty for performing transmission.<br>
Therefore, a plurality of users of the low<br>
speed data rate are assigned one frequency block.<br>
For example, the radio resource assignment unit 140<br>
assigns users #9 and #10 of the low data rate to a<br>
same frequency block to transmit it by multiplexing<br>
the users. Accordingly, receiving quality can be<br>
improved due to multi-user diversity.<br>
In addition, when assigning radio<br>
resources to users of the low data rate, the radio<br>
resource assignment unit 140 may assign the<br>
resources across at least two frequency blocks in a<br>
plurality of frequency blocks included in a same<br>
transmission slot. When users of the low data rate<br>
are assigned to one frequency block as a whole,<br>
there is a case where the multi-user diversity<br>
effect is deteriorated since a set of users of good<br>
receiving status is not necessarily assigned.<br>
In such a case, radio resources are<br><br>
-37-<br>
assigned across a plurality of frequency blocks.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig.l7A, each of users #9,<br>
#10, #11 and #12 of the low data rate is assigned<br>
across at least two frequency blocks of frequency<br>
blocks included in a same transmission slot.<br>
Accordingly, frequency diversity effect can be<br>
obtained, and receiving quality in the receiver can<br>
be improved.<br>
Although radio resource assignment to<br>
shared channels for users of low data rate is<br>
described in Fig.l7A, a similar radio resource<br>
assignment method is effective when performing<br>
assignment for users moving at high speed or users<br>
where receiving status is extremely bad. This is<br>
because, since speed of channel variation becomes<br>
very high for the users moving at high speed, radio<br>
resource assignment by packet scheduling cannot<br>
follow the variation so that improvement effect due<br>
to multi-user diversity cannot be obtained. In<br>
addition, as to the users where the receiving status<br>
is extremely bad, since the data rate becomes very<br>
low, enough channel coding gain cannot be obtained<br>
only by assigning a part of a particular frequency<br>
block, so that there may be a case where the<br>
characteristics are deteriorated. The user in the<br>
above-mentioned conditions, as shown in Fig.l7B, is<br>
assigned resources across at least two frequency<br>
blocks of frequency blocks included in a same<br>
transmission slot. Accordingly, frequency diversity<br>
effect can be obtained so that receiving quality in<br>
the receiver can be improved.<br>
Next, a case where radio resources are<br>
assigned to a multicast channel is described with<br>
reference to Fig.18. In the case of multicast, data<br>
is transmitted from a plurality of transmitters to a<br>
particular user.<br>
As shown in the configuration example 1,<br><br>
-38-<br>
when assigning radio resources to a multicast<br>
channel, the radio resource assignment unit 140<br>
assigns the multicast channel to at least a part of<br>
symbols forming a transmission slot that indicates a<br>
unit (TTI: Transmission Time Interval) of<br>
transmission in packet transmission.<br>
Also, in this case, when assigning radio<br>
resources to a physical channel other than the<br>
multicast channel, the radio resource assignment<br>
unit 140 assigns a symbol other than symbols to<br>
which the multicast channel is assigned.<br>
Accordingly, since the multicast channel can be<br>
mapped over the entire frequency band, receiving<br>
quality in the receiver can be improved due to<br>
frequency diversity effect.<br>
As shown in the configuration example 2,<br>
when assigning radio resources to a multicast<br>
channel, the radio resource assignment unit 140 may<br>
assign the multicast channel to at least a part of<br>
symbols forming a transmission slot that indicates a<br>
unit (TTI: Transmission Time Interval) of<br>
transmission in packet transmission, and may perform<br>
assignment so as to transmit a same transmission<br>
slot a plurality of times, for example, two times,<br>
using a plurality of transmission slots.<br>
Also, in this case, when assigning radio<br>
resources to a physical channel other than the<br>
multicast channel, the radio resource assignment<br>
unit 140 assigns a symbol other than symbols to<br>
which the multicast channel is assigned.<br>
Accordingly, since the multicast channel can be<br>
mapped over the entire frequency band, receiving<br>
quality in the receiver can be improved due to<br>
frequency diversity effect. In addition, effect of<br>
time diversity can be also obtained.<br>
In addition, in the configuration example<br>
2, in the multicast channel transmitted secondly or<br><br>
-39-<br>
later, information that is the same as one<br>
transmitted first is transmitted. In this case,<br>
demodulation processing is performed in the receiver<br>
side so that it is determined whether there is an<br>
demodulation error. When there is no demodulation<br>
error, control is performed so as not to receive a<br>
multicast channel that is transmitted secondly or<br>
later. For example, in many cases, a user located<br>
near a transmitter can receive information at the<br>
first try. By controlling so as not to receive a<br>
multicast channel that is transmitted secondly or<br>
later, consumption of a battery can be suppressed.<br>
When there is a demodulation error, the<br>
information is discarded and the multicast channel<br>
transmitted secondly or later is demodulated again.<br>
In addition, when there is a demodulation error, the<br>
information may not be discarded so as to perform<br>
packet combining for the multicast channel<br>
transmitted secondly or later and the multicast<br>
channel received previously to perform demodulation<br>
again. Accordingly, receiving SIR can be improved.<br>
In addition, in the configuration example<br>
2, the multicast channel transmitted secondly or<br>
later may be for transmitting information different<br>
from one in the first transition. For example, the<br>
multicast channel transmitted secondly or later may<br>
be configured to transmit a packet on which<br>
puncturing is performed with a pattern different<br>
from a pattern used in the first transmission. In<br>
this case, demodulation processing is performed in<br>
the receiver side, and it is determined whether<br>
there is a demodulation error. When there is no<br>
demodulation error, the receiver is controlled such<br>
that it does not receive a multicast channel<br>
transmitted secondly or later. For example, in many<br>
cases, a user located near a transmitter can receive<br>
information at the first try. By controlling the<br><br>
-40-<br>
user so as not to receive a multicast channel that<br>
is transmitted secondly or later, consumption of a<br>
battery can be suppressed.<br>
When there is a demodulation error, the<br>
information may not be discarded, and packet<br>
combining may be performed between the multicast<br>
channel transmitted secondly or later and the<br>
multicast channel received previously to perform<br>
demodulation again. Accordingly, coding gain can be<br>
improved.<br>
In addition, in the configuration example<br>
2, the multicast channel transmitted secondly or<br>
later may be configured to transmit information<br>
different from one sent in the first transmission.<br>
For example, information indicating the multicast<br>
channel may be divided into two or more. When<br>
information is stored in the multicast channel<br>
transmitted for the first time and redundancy code<br>
is stored in the multicast channel transmitted<br>
secondly or later, the multicast channel transmitted<br>
secondly or later cannot be decoded when receiving<br>
of the multicast channel transmitted first is failed,<br>
In such a case, by dividing information<br>
indicating the multicast channel into two or more<br>
for transmission, receiving quality in the receiver<br>
can be improved due to time diversity effect. In<br>
this case, a transmission slot for transmitting<br>
information indicating the multicast channel by<br>
dividing it and a packet storing the redundancy code<br>
may be transmitted.<br>
In this case, it is necessary to determine<br>
a number of division of the multicast channel<br>
beforehand in the transmitter and the receiver. As<br>
information to be determined beforehand, a packet<br>
number for performing packet combining, a puncture<br>
pattern, constellation, and a bit indicating new or<br>
retransmission packet are necessary. The bit<br><br>
-41-<br>
indicating a new or retransmitted packet is<br>
necessary for avoiding incorrect combining<br>
considering ACK/NACK bit error.<br>
Next, a method for assigning radio<br>
resources for a shared channel in a frequency block<br>
is described. The radio resource assignment unit<br>
140 multiplexes shared channels in a frequency block<br>
to which the radio resources are assigned.<br>
First, a method is described for assigning<br>
radio resources to a user of high data rate.<br>
For example, for a user of the high speed<br>
data rate, the radio resource assignment unit 140<br>
multiplexes signals of one user within the frequency<br>
block based on the result of frequency/time<br>
scheduling. For example, as shown in Fig.19, the<br>
radio resource assignment unit 140 combines time<br>
multiplexing and frequency multiplexing to multiplex<br>
signals of one user.<br>
Next, a method for assigning radio<br>
resources to users of low data rate is described<br>
with reference to Fig.20.<br>
For example, for the user of low data rate,<br>
the radio resource assignment unit 140 time-<br>
multiplexes signals of a plurality of users within a<br>
frequency block based on the result of<br>
frequency/time scheduling. Accordingly, receiving<br>
quality can be improved due to frequency diversity<br>
effect.<br>
In addition, for example, for the user of<br>
the low data rate, the radio resource assignment<br>
unit 140 may frequency-multiplex signals of a<br>
plurality of users within a frequency block based on<br>
the result of frequency/time scheduling.<br>
Accordingly, receiving quality can be improved due<br>
to time diversity effect.<br>
In addition, for example, for the user of<br>
the low data rate, the radio resource assignment<br><br>
-42-<br>
unit 140 may code-multiplex signals of a plurality<br>
of users within a frequency block based on the<br>
result of frequency/time scheduling. Accordingly,<br>
compared to time multiplexing and frequency<br>
multiplexing, time diversity effect and frequency<br>
diversity effect can be. obtained so that receiving<br>
quality can be improved. In addition, by applying a<br>
low speed data modulation scheme such as QPSK and<br>
BPSK for example, effect of inter-code interference<br>
caused by collapse of orthogonally can be decreased.<br>
In addition, for example, for the user of<br>
the low data rate, the radio resource assignment<br>
unit 140 may multiplex signals of a plurality of<br>
users within the frequency block by combining time<br>
multiplexing, frequency multiplexing and code<br>
multiplexing based on the result of frequency/time<br>
scheduling.<br>
Detailed descriptions are given.<br>
As mentioned above, as shown in Fig.21,<br>
the radio resource assignment unit 140, for users of<br>
the low data rate, time-multiplexes signals of users<br>
within the frequency block. Accordingly, especially<br>
in an environment where there are many users of low<br>
speed mobility, receiving quality can be improved by<br>
the frequency diversity effect.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in Fig.22A,<br>
the radio resource assignment unit 140, for users of<br>
the high data rate, multiplexes signals of users<br>
within the frequency block by combining time<br>
multiplexing and frequency multiplexing.<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig.22B, the<br>
radio resource assignment unit 140, for users of the<br>
high data rate, may multiplex signals of users<br>
within the frequency block by combining time<br>
multiplexing and code multiplexing.<br>
In addition, the radio resource assignment<br>
unit 140, further for users of the low data rate,<br><br>
-43-<br>
may multiplex signals of users within the frequency<br>
block by combining time multiplexing, frequency<br>
multiplexing and code multiplexing.<br>
For example, as shown in Figs.23A and 23B,<br>
the radio resource assignment unit 140 multiplexes<br>
signals of a plurality of users within the frequency<br>
block in the time domain/the frequency domain.<br>
Fig.23A corresponds to a case where continuous time<br>
domains are assigned, and Fig.23B corresponds to a<br>
case where discrete time domains are assigned.<br>
In addition, for example, as shown in<br>
Fig.24, the radio resource assignment unit 140 may<br>
randomly select blocks formed by sub-carriers and<br>
OFDM symbols in time domain/frequency domain to<br>
multiplex signals of a plurality of users in the<br>
frequency block.<br>
In addition, for example, as shown in<br>
Figs.25A and 25B, the radio resource assignment unit<br>
140 may multiplex signals of a plurality of users in<br>
the frequency block in time domain/code domain.<br>
Fig.25A corresponds to a case where consecutive<br>
frequency domains are assigned (Hybrid TDM/CDM), and<br>
Fig.25B corresponds to a case where discrete<br>
frequency domains are assigned (Hybrid TDM/CDM).<br>
In addition, for example, as shown in<br>
Figs.26A and 26B, the radio resource assignment unit<br>
140 may multiplex signals of a plurality of users in<br>
the frequency block in frequency domain/code domain.<br>
Fig.26A corresponds to a case where consecutive time<br>
domains are assigned (Hybrid FDM/CDM), and Fig.26B<br>
corresponds to a case where discrete time domains<br>
are assigned (Hybrid FDM/CDM).<br>
In addition, for example, as shown in<br>
Figs.27A and 27B, the radio resource assignment unit<br>
140 may multiplex signals of a plurality of users in<br>
the frequency block in time domain/frequency<br>
domain/code domain. Fig.27A corresponds to a case<br><br>
-44-<br>
where consecutive frequency domains are assigned<br>
(Hybrid TDM/FDM/CDM), and Fig.27B corresponds to a<br>
case where discrete frequency domains are assigned<br>
(Hybrid TDM/FDM/CDM).<br>
As mentioned above, by dividing the time<br>
domain/frequency domain/code domain in the frequency<br>
block and assigning a signal of a user to each<br>
divided region, multiplexing among a plurality of<br>
users in the frequency block can be performed.<br>
Next, operation of the transmission<br>
apparatus 100 of the present invention is described<br>
with reference to Fig.28.<br>
Information to be transmitted by a common<br>
control channel is supplied to the channel coding<br>
unit 102. In the channel coding unit 102, channel<br>
coding is performed on the supplied information<br>
according to a preset channel coding rate (step<br>
S2702).<br>
Next, in data modulation unit 104, data<br>
modulation is performed on information, on which<br>
channel coding has been performed, according to a<br>
preset data modulation scheme (step S2704) .<br>
Next, the spreading unit 106 spreads<br>
information on which data modulation has been<br>
performed according to a preset spreading rate (step<br>
S2706).<br>
On the other hand, the packet scheduling<br>
unit 128 selects users and determines a data<br>
modulation scheme and a coding rate used for each<br>
selected user according to supplied transmission<br>
information to each user and receiving quality of<br>
each user (step S2708).<br>
Next, in channel coding unit 122, channel<br>
coding is performed on information to be transmitted<br>
to each user according to the coding rate determined<br>
by the packet scheduling unit 128 (step S2710) .<br>
Next, in the data modulation unit 104,<br><br>
-45-<br>
data modulation is performed on information, to be<br>
transmitted to each user, on which channel coding<br>
has been performed, according to the data modulation<br>
scheme determined by the packet scheduling unit 128<br>
(step S2712).<br>
Next, the spreading unit 106 spreads<br>
information, to be transmitted to each user, on<br>
which data modulation has been performed, according<br>
to the spreading factor determined by the packet<br>
scheduling unit 128 (step S2714).<br>
In addition, the packet scheduling unit<br>
128 supplies information of the selected user and<br>
information such as selected data modulation scheme<br>
and coding rate etc. to the channel coding unit 112.<br>
In the channel coding unit 112, channel<br>
coding is performed on supplied information<br>
according to a preset channel coding rate (step<br>
S2716).<br>
Next, in the data modulation unit 104,<br>
data modulation is performed on the information on<br>
which channel coding has been performed according to<br>
a preset data modulation scheme (step S2718) .<br>
Next, the spreading unit 106 spreads<br>
