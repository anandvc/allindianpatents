				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for controlling a call in an exchange system, and more particularly to a method for connecting a call to various separated call incoming points by using each of information which varies according to the purpose of the call generation place while attempting to generate the call for an identical incoming office number, and processing the call by several divided control information such as a telephone charge imposing method, a charge rate and a call release method, etc, according to the information of the call generation place.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art <br>
Only one communication enterprise gave all the telephone services in the past, but many communication enterprises is expected to be give a special telephone service in a specific field due to introductin of a competition system according to the request of diversification of a communication network recently.<br><br>
Currently, for a domestic communication network, two communication enterprises, i.e., Korea Telecom and Dacom corporation is giving a telephone service in a suburban telephone business field and it is expected that a third communication enterprise will participate in a communication service competition.<br>
Since telephone service charges become graded and there is a difference in quality among many suburban telephone enterprises, a telephone subscriber selects and uses a suburban telephone service of a specific enterprise depending on his need, and then pays a telephone charge to the specific enterprise.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a conventional system for separately processing a call for an identical office number, in which processes a call so that such a many enterprises may provide a special suburban telephone service<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, when a calling subscriber 10 of a telephone office attempts to generate a call, a subscriber controller 12 transfer a call incoming number inputted from the calling subscriber 10 to a translator 14 to request the translation of the call incoming number. The translator 14 analyzes office number table data as shown in FIG. 2 for the purpose of analysis of the call incoming number. Such an analysis of the office number is performed by starting to analyze a first digit which is an area 2a in FIG. 2 of the call incoming number. If analysis of the first digit of the incoming number requests the next digit, the translator 14 analyzes a second digit of the call incoming number which is an area 2b in FIG. 2. If analysis of the second digit of the call incoming number also requests the next digit, the translator 14 analyzes a third digit of the<br>
2<br><br>
call incoming number which is an area 2c in FIG. 2. If analysis of from the first to third digit of the call incoming number enables analysis of office number information, the translator 14 analyzes office number information data as shown in FIG. 3a defined by office number table data. The translator 14 obtains several kinds of information such as call incoming point information, imposed charge information, call release method information, etc for corresponding call through the analysis of office number information data. If the result of analysis of the call incoming point information of office number information data for the corresponding call is that the call incoming point is a point within the calling subscriber's telephone office, the translator 14 processes a call of the calling subscriber's telephone office in order to establish a call to a called subscriber through process of subscribers within his own office. If, on the other hand, the calling subscriber attempts a call by not an office number of his own office but a subscriber's telephone number of the other telephone office, the call incoming point of a corresponding call is a point within the other telephone office through analysis of the translator 14, and the translator 14 demands an outgoing trunk 18 which is coupled to the other telephone office. The translator 14 with respect to an outgoing call processes an outgoing call in order to establish a call to the other telephone office through an outgoing trunk controller 16. If the establishment of the call is performed normally, the translator 14 counts a detailed charge and a measured charge according to a charge rate defined with respect to corresponding call depending on imposed charge information as shown in FIG. 3-(3c) obtained during the analysis of an office number. When attempt of the call is accomplished, the translator 14 releases the establishement of the corresponding call and completes the counting operation of the charge according to call release method information as shown in FIG. 3-(3b) obtained during the<br>
3<br><br>
analysis of an office number.<br>
However, in such a conventional office number analysis method, since special data for a call generation place are unnecessary when generating a call, and information data on an identical incoming office number have only a piece of information, it is determined from analysis of information on an identical incoming office number that the information is always composed of identical information. This means that a call for an identical incoming office number generated from all the subscribers included in one exechange system is always established to an identical call incoming point.<br>
In such restriction of an exechange system, there has been a problem that when a plurality of communication enterprise networks are composed of an identical incoming office number(eg. a location number of a suburban call), and selection and use of the networks is allowed to subscribers, it is necessary to form a special identifier(eg. a communication enterprise identifying number) besides the exsiting incoming office number, and the inconvenience of having to request input of a desired identifier besides the existing called subscriber's number to a calling subscriber arises. In addition, there has been a problem that since information on all the identifiers should be formed separately according to increase in the number of a communication enterprise or the request of exchange system applcation, the use of supported system is expected to be increased and a telephone subscriber suffers the inconvenience of having to request a call incoming number unlike the existing number.<br>
For example, if a telephone subscriber connected to a first communication<br>
4<br><br>
enterprise wants to use a suburban telephone service of the first communication enterprise, he can use it through the present service method of "a location number + a subscriber number". If, on the other hand, a telephone subscriber connected to a first communication enterprise wants to use a suburban telephone service of other communication enterprise besides the first communication enterprise, he can use it through other service method of " an identification number of a suburban telephone enterprise + a location number + a subscriber number". Thus, in this case, the request of an additional number, i.e., the identification number of a suburban telephone enterprise causes the time required for a call connection to be delayed. The above service method of requesting the identification number of a suburban telephone enterprise may give inconvenience to subscribers accustomed to an exsisting service method, thereby obstucting the use of other suburban telephone service.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of preferentially connecting a call to a specific call incoming point according to information of a call generation place defined by the prerequest of a calling subsriber while attempting to generate the call for an identical incoming office number.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of controlling a call by distinct information such as a telephone charge imposing method, a charge rate and a call release method, etc, according to the information of the call generation place.<br>
5<br><br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of controlling a call for an identical incoming office number, which enables the use of a plurality of suburban telephone enterprise networks without demanding extra additional information to telephone subscribers and allows the work constructing a network necessary for an operator to be faciliated.<br>
This and other object of the present invention have been attained by providing a method of controlling a call for an identical incoming office number in an exchange system, the method compring the steps of: combining a call generation place information and a call incoming number when a call for an identical incoming office number is generated; connecting the call to a call incoming point which is separated depending on call generation purpose; establishing the call" as the relevant call by several distinct call control information and releasing the call.<br>

Now, an explanation on the operation according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be in datail given hereinafter with reference to FIG. 4 to 6.<br>
The present invention includes the function of processing subscriber data, the function of constructing subscriber group information and the function of analyzing office number information.<br>
The function of processing subscriber data represents the function of giving subscriber group information to be used as information on a call generated place to the subscriber data and changing it in order that a corresponding subscriber may have desired call information when the subscriber is produced or subscriber data is changed.<br>
The function of constructing information data on a call generated place represents the function of designating and changing a branch value by call control information in order that office number information may be analyzed specifically for each of call generation place information with respect to subscriber group information of calling subscribers transferred during the<br>
8<br><br>
generation of a call and all the call generation place information included in a system.<br>
The function of analyzing office number information represents the function of analyzing office number information different each other for an identical incoming office number by combining information on a call generation place and a call incoming number transferred from a calling subscriber during the generation of a call, and of establishing and controlling a call according to the analyzed office number information.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, when a calling subscriber 10 of a telephone office requests the generation of a call, a subscriber controller 32 transfer a call incoming number and information on a call generation place(subscriber group information) transferred from the calling subscriber 10 to a translator 14 to request the translation of the call incoming number.<br>
A translator 24 examines information data on a call generation place to obtain a branch value to each of call control information of office number information as shown in FIG. 5 with respect to subscriber group information of the calling subscriber transferred from the subscriber controller 32. After completing analysis of formation data on a call generation place, the translator 24 retrieves office number table data as shown in FIG. 2 for the purpose of analysis of the call incoming number. The office number table data are composed of call control information for corresponding office number, and the translator 24 obtains a link value to each of call control information of office number information after analyzing office number information. Also, the translator 24<br>
9<br><br>
analyzes call release method information data as shown in FIG. 3-(3b) through combinatin of a link value to call release method information data defined by office number information data with a call release information branch value obtained through analysis of formation data on a call generated place for the call release method information of the corresponding call so as to obtain specific call release method information.<br>
The translator 24 also analyzes imposed charge information data as shown in FIG. 3-(3c) through combinatin of a link value to imposed charge information data defined by office number information data with a imposed charge information branch value obtained through analysis of formation data on a call generation place for the imposed charge information of the corresponding call so as to obtain specific imposed charge information.<br>
Futher, the translator 24 analyzes imposed charge information data as shown in FIG. 3-(3d) through combinatin of a link value to call incoming point information data defined by office number information data with a call incoming point information branch value obtained through analysis of formation data on a call generation place for the call incoming point information of the corresponding call so as to obtain specific call incoming point information.<br>
Therefore, specific call control information for each of call generation place with respect to identical incoming office number can be obtained in the aforementioned manner by the translator 24 as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
If it is determined from the analysis of the call incoming point information<br>
10<br><br>
of office number information data for a corresponding call that the call incoming point is a point within the other telephone office, the translator 24 establishes the corresponding call (to a first outgoing trunk 38 or a second outgoing trunk 40 under the control of an outgoing trunk controller 34. If, on the other hand, if it is determined from the analysis of the call incoming point information of office number information data for a corresponding call that the call incoming point is a point within a calling subscriber's telephone office, the translator 24 establishes the corresponding pall to a subscriber within his own office under the control of a subscriber controller 42. If the establishment of the call is accomplished, the translator 14 counts an imposed charge depending on imposed charge information obtained after the analysis of an office number. When attempt of the call is concluded;the translator 14 releases the establishement of the corresponding call and completes the counting operation of the imposed charge according to call release method information obtained after the analysis of an office number. The translator 24 may form a branch value required for analysis of each of call control information for every and includes the function of processing information data on a call generation place so that call generated place information data may be changed during the application of an exchange system according to user's request.<br>
Now, an explanation on the process for processing information on a plurality of subscriber groups according to an embodiment of the present invention will be in detail given with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
First, in the function of processing subscriber data, if there is an input of the request of a user(step 6a) for the purpose of processing of call generated<br>
11<br><br>
place information, it is determined(step 6b) whether or not subscriber group information is included in the request of a user. If the answer is NO, i.e., If it is determined(step 6b) that the subscriber group information is not included in the request of a user, subscriber group information of a corresponding subscriber is designated at preset initial value(6c, 6d). If, on the other hand, it is determined(step 6b) that the subscriber group information is included in the request of a user, it is determined(step 6e) whether or not an inputted subscriber group value is within call generation place information data through the reteieval of the call generation, place information data in order to examine the validity of the subscriber group information. If it is determined(step 6e) that the inputted subscriber group value is valid(or is within the call generated place information data), the process of subscriber information is performed normally(step 6f). On the other hand, if it is determined(step 6e) that the inputted subscriber group value is valid, the subscriber information is processed as an error(step 6g).<br>
As described above, the present invention has an advantage that it is possible to use a plurality of call control information with respect to an identical incoming office number by only changing pure software and data without modifying the construntion of a system hardware, and it is also possible to use the existing telephone number system as it is by easily constituting information of a plurality of communication network enterprises having an identical purpose so as to select and use communication network enterprise without requesting special information to telephone subscribers.<br>
Futhermore, the present invention has an advantage that it can be applied to all the call generation places(e.g. incoming connection) of calls produced from<br>
12<br><br>
subscribers as well as a system, which enables the formation of divided call control information with respect to a call generated by an identical incoming number for every subscriber group and an incoming connection, so that a service can be given by forming only data of his own telephone office according to the purpose of use without changing the existing use method or signal transmission method between telephone offices when there is need to construct a specific purposed network.<br>
While there have been illustrated and described what are considered to be preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the true scope of the present invention. Therefore, it is intended that the present invention not be limited to the particular embodiments disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention, but that the present invention embraces all alternatives, modifications and variances falling within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
