				<td>A METHOD OF BROADCASTING A MESSAGE AND<br>
AN APPARATUS FOR GENERATING A MESSAGE<br>
The invention relates to methods of and apparatus for broadcasting and receiving text<br>
messages in broadcast systems such as television, radio, cellular phone or other such<br>
systems.<br>
Broadcast systems are used for transmitting signals, such as digital or analogue<br>
television signals, from a broadcast centre to a user, via a medium such as a satellite,<br>
cable or terrestrial broadcast link. Receiver/decoders at the user end are used for<br>
receiving and/or decoding the signals, typically for input to a television set. In the<br>
case of digital transmission, digital channels are encoded into a digital data stream at<br>
the transmitter end, and are decoded at the receiver end using a receiver/decoder,<br>
which may typically be either in a digital set-top box (DSTB) or in an integrated<br>
digital television. In the case of analogue transmission, a receiver/decoder may be<br>
provided at the user to convert the transmitted signals into a format for input to a<br>
television set<br>
In known broadcast systems, text messages may be sent along with a transmitted<br>
signal. A suitably equipped receiver/decoder extracts the text message from the<br>
transmitted signal for display on a television screen. Such messages are accessible by<br>
all users with suitably equipped receiver/decoders.<br>
Known system for sending text messages tend to be inflexible.<br>
A first aspect of the present invention provides a method of broadcasting a message<br>
having a text portion to be communicated to a user, the method comprising<br>
broadcasting the message in the form of an entitlement management message for<br>
reception by the user.<br>
Entitlement management messages (EMMs) are normally linked to access control, and<br>
have a certain structure. The present invention enables existing apparatus, such as<br>
message generators, STM servers, ciphering units, EMM injectors and message<br>
emitters, used to generate and broadcast entitlement management messages carrying<br>
access control data to be used to generate and broadcast messages including a text<br><br>
portion to be communicated to a user, thus providing a convenient way in which to<br>
send the message to a user, and may also provide the advantage that the message can<br>
be encrypted using existing encryption mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality of the<br>
message. It will be appreciated that although the message takes the form of, or is<br>
based on the structure of, an entitlement management message, it may not necessarily<br>
be used for managing entitlement.<br>
Furthermore, by broadcasting such messages in the form of an entitlement<br>
management message, the messages can be received by a receiver/decoder already<br>
configured to receive entitlement management messages carrying access control data<br>
without the need to reconfigure the receiver/decoder, for example, to receive an<br>
alternative form of message.<br>
Preferably, the message includes at least one identifier to define a group of users for<br>
whom the message is intended. This provides the advantage that a message may be<br>
sent to a group of users without the need for the message to be sent individually to<br>
every user in that group. This may also provide the advantage that the message is<br>
communicated only to users in the group, which can prevent messages being<br>
communicated to users for whom they are not intended. This may provide a more<br>
efficient way of communicating messages to a group of users.<br>
The text portion is preferably a section of text, for example in the form of coded or<br>
uncoded ASCII characters, which text may be for display, for example, on a user"s<br>
television screen; alternatively, for example in the case of a radio system, the text<br>
could be announced to the user.<br>
The group of users may be a selected group, selected from the totality of users, and<br>
the method may include the step of selecting the group and including in the message<br>
at least one identifier to define the selected group.<br>
A group of users may comprise two or more users. Each identifier may be an<br>
identifier of a group having a particular characteristic. In this way, the message may<br>
be directed to those users having a certain characteristic. The characteristic may be<br>
selected from at least one of geographic area, customer category, subscription to a<br><br>
particular commercial offer, purchase of a particular product, and purchase of a<br>
particular session. As used herein, a commercial offer is preferably the right to view<br>
a channel or a number of channels (known as a "bouquet"); a product is preferably a<br>
programme, or a set of programmes, to which a user has subscribed; and a session<br>
is preferably a time slot on a certain channel. It will be appreciated that the audience<br>
may be split into different customer categories, such as cinema, football, rugby, age,<br>
social category etc. The invention extends to any division of users that can be<br>
identified by the operator sending the message.<br>
It may be desired to send messages to users having a particular combination of<br>
characteristics, and thus the message may include identifiers of a plurality of<br>
characteristics. The message may further include at least one operator defining how<br>
those identifiers are to be combined. An operator may define at least one logical<br>
operator, such as AND, OR, NOT and/or XOR.<br>
The message may include a type specifier specifying that the message is of a type<br>
which includes a text portion.<br>
The message may include a priority specifier for specifying the priority of the<br>
message. This may for example be used to vary the way in which the message is<br>
communicated to the user.<br>
Preferably, the message includes a signature for verifying the contents of the message.<br>
The message may be encrypted To ensure reception by a chosen user, the message<br>
may be repetitively broadcast at a predetermined cycle rate.<br>
In a second aspect the present invention provides a method of communicating a<br>
message having a text portion to a user, the method comprising receiving at a<br>
receiver/decoder the message in the form of an entitlement management message, and<br>
outputting from the receiver/decoder a signal representative of the text portion for<br>
communication to the user.<br>
Preferably, the message includes at least one identifier to define a group of users for<br>
whom the message is intended. The method may further comprise determining<br><br>
whether the user is in said group of users. The determining step may comprise<br>
comparing the identifier to a stored identifier (preferably stored at the user"s<br>
receiver/decoder). In this way a receiver/decoder may be able to determine whether<br>
or not the message is intended for the corresponding user.<br>
The method may further comprise generating a signal for advising of receipt of the<br>
message; for example, an indication may be produced on a display of the<br>
receiver/decoder, or a message or icon may be displayed on the screen of a television<br>
connected to the receiver/decoder. In this way a user may be advised of the receipt<br>
of a message without the message itself being communicated to the user.<br>
The signal representative of the text portion may be a display signal for enabling the<br>
text to be displayed on a user"s television set.<br>
The step of outputting a signal representative of the text may be carried out in<br>
response to a request from the user, or it may be carried out automatically without any<br>
(direct) user action.<br>
For example, the signal may be output automatically from the receiver/decoder in<br>
dependence on the value of a priority specifier included in the message which specifies<br>
the priority of the message. Thus, for example, if an urgent message such as a<br>
hurricane warning is to be communicated to the user, this message could be assigned<br>
a high priority and could be displayed directly on a user"s television set as soon as the<br>
message is received by the user"s receiver/decoder, whereas other messages might be<br>
assigned a lower priority and would only be displayed on the user"s television set in<br>
response to a request from the user.<br>
The message may include an identifier of the message, and the method may further<br>
comprise comparing the identifier with an identifier of a previously received message.<br>
If the comparison reveals that the received message has the same identifier as a<br>
previously received message, then preferably the most recently received message is<br>
discarded. In this way it may be ensured that a message is not processed more than<br>
once.<br><br>
In a third aspect of the invention there is provided apparatus for generating a message<br>
having a text portion to be communicated to a user, said apparatus comprising means<br>
(for example, a message generator) for generating the message in the form of an<br>
entitlement management message for reception by the user.<br>
Preferably, means (such as a multiplexer) is provided for inserting the message into<br>
a signal for broadcast.<br>
Preferably, the message includes at least one identifier to define a group of users for<br>
whom the message is intended. The apparatus may comprise means (for example, a<br>
system) for selecting said group from the totality of users and means (for example, a<br>
message generator) for including in said message at least one identifier to define the<br>
selected group.<br>
Preferably, each identifier is an identifier of a group having a particular characteristic.<br>
The characteristic may be selected from at least one of geographic area, customer<br>
category, subscription to a particular commercial offer, purchase of a particular<br>
product, and purchase of a particular session.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus comprises means (for example, a message generator) for<br>
including in said message at least one operator defining how a plurality of said<br>
identifiers are to be combined.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus comprises means (for example, a message generator) for<br>
including in said message a type identifier identifying that the message is intended for<br>
a group of users only.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus comprises means (for example, a message generator) for<br>
including in said message a type specifier specifying that the message is of a type<br>
which includes a text portion.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus comprises means (for example, a message generator) for<br>
including in said message a priority specifier for specifying the priority of the<br>
message.<br><br>
Preferably, the apparatus comprises means (for example, a message generator) for<br>
generating a signature for verifying the contents of the message.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus comprises means (for example, a ciphering unit) for<br>
encrypting the message.<br>
In a related fourth aspect, the present invention provides apparatus for broadcasting<br>
a message generated by apparatus as defined above, comprising means (such as a<br>
transmitter) for broadcasting said message in the form of an entitlement management<br>
message to a user"s receiver/decoder.<br>
The transmitter may be adapted to repetitively broadcast the message at a<br>
predetermined cycle rate.<br>
In a fifth aspect, the present invention provides a receiver/decoder comprising means<br>
(for example, a receiver) for receiving a message in the form of an entitlement<br>
management message having a text portion, and output means (for example, an output)<br>
for outputting a signal representative of the text portion for communication to a user.<br>
Preferably, the message includes at least one identifier to define a group of users for<br>
whom the message is intended. Preferably, the receiver/decoder comprises means (for<br>
example, a suitably programmed processor) for determining whether the user is in the<br>
group of users, said output means outputting said signal representative of the text<br>
portion if the user is in the group of users.<br>
Preferably, the receiver/decoder comprises means (for example, a processor) for<br>
comparing said at least one identifier with at least one identifier stored at the<br>
receiver/decoder to determine whether the user is in the group of users.<br>
Preferably, the message includes at least one operator defining how a plurality of said<br>
identifiers are to be combined, the receiver/decoder comprising means (for example,<br>
a processor) for applying said at least one operator to said plurality of identifiers to<br>
determine whether the user is in the group of users.<br><br>
Preferably, the receiver/decoder comprises means (for example, a signal generator) for<br>
generating a signal for advising the user of receipt of the message by the<br>
receiver/decoder.<br>
Preferably,the receiver/decoder comprising means (such as an input) for receiving a<br>
request from the user for output of the signal representative of the text portion.<br>
The output means may be adapted to output automatically the signal representative of<br>
the text portion, for example, in dependence on the value of a priority specifier<br>
included in the message which specifies the priority of the message.<br>
In a sixth aspect, the present invention provides an entitlement management message<br>
comprising a text portion for communication to a user.<br>
In a seventh aspect, the present invention provides a signal comprising a message as<br>
aforementioned.<br>
Features described above relating to method aspects may be applied to apparatus,<br>
receiver/decoder, message or signal aspects, and vice versa.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of broadcasting a<br>
message having a text portion to be communicated to a user, the method<br>
comprising broadcasting the message in the form of an entitlement management<br>
message for reception by a receiver/decoder at the user end.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of communicating a<br>
message having a text portion to a user, the method comprising receiving at a<br>
receiver/decoder the message in the form of an entitlement management<br>
message, and outputting from the receiver/decoder a signal representative of the<br>

System Overview<br>
An overview of a digital television system 1 is shown in Figure 1. The invention<br>
includes a mostly conventional digital television system 2 that uses the known MPEG-<br>
2 compression system to transmit compressed digital signals. In more detail, MPEG-<br>
2 compressor 3 in a broadcast centre receives a digital signal stream (typically a<br>
stream of video signals). The compressor 3 is connected to a multiplexer and<br>
scrambler 4 by linkage 5.<br>
The multiplexer 4 receives a plurality of further input signals, assembles the transport<br>
stream and transmits compressed digital signals to a transmitter 6 of the broadcast<br>
centre via linkage 7, which can of course take a wide variety of forms including<br>
telecommunications links. The transmitter 6 transmits electromagnetic signals via<br>
uplink 8 towards a satellite transponder 9, where they are electronically processed and<br>
broadcast via notional downlink 10 to earth receiver 12, conventionally in the form<br>
of a dish owned or rented by the end user. Other transport channels for transmission<br>
of the data are of course possible, such as terrestrial broadcast, cable transmission,<br>
combined satellite/cable links, telephone networks etc.<br>
The signals received by receiver 12 are transmitted to an integrated receiver/decoder<br>
13 owned or rented by the end user and connected to the end user"s television set 14.<br>
The receiver/decoder 13 decodes the compressed MPEG-2 signal into a television<br>
signal for the television set 14. Although a separate receiver/decoder is shown in<br>
Figure 1, the receiver/decoder may also be part of an integrated digital television.<br>
As used herein, the term "receiver/decoder" includes a separate receiver/decoder,<br>
such as a set-top box, and a television having a receiver/decoder integrated therewith.<br>
In a multichannel system, the multiplexer 4 handles audio and video information<br>
received from a number of parallel sources and interacts with the transmitter 6 to<br>
broadcast the information along a corresponding number of channels. In addition to<br>
audiovisual information, messages or applications or any other sort of digital data<br>
may be introduced in some or all of these channels interlaced with the transmitted<br>
digital audio and video information.<br>
A conditional access system 15 is connected to the multiplexer 4 and the<br><br>
receiver/decoder 13, and is located partly in the broadcast centre and partly in the<br>
receiver/decoder. It enables the end user to access digital television broadcasts from<br>
one or more broadcast suppliers. A smartcard, capable of deciphering messages<br>
relating to commercial offers (that is, one or several television programmes sold by<br>
the broadcast supplier), can be inserted into the receiver/decoder 13. Using the<br>
receiver/decoder 13 and smartcard, the end user may purchase commercial offers in<br>
either a subscription mode or a pay-per-view mode.<br>
As mentioned above, programmes transmitted by the system are scrambled at the<br>
multiplexer 4, the conditions and encryption keys applied to a given transmission<br>
being determined by the access control system 15. Transmission of scrambled data<br>
in this way is well known in the field of pay TV systems. Typically, scrambled data<br>
is transmitted together with a control word for descrambling of the data, the control<br>
word itself being encrypted by a so-called exploitation key and transmitted in<br>
encrypted form.<br>
The scrambled data and encrypted control word are then received by the<br>
receiver/decoder 13 having access to an equivalent to the exploitation key stored on<br>
a smart card inserted in the receiver/decoder to decrypt the encrypted control word<br>
and thereafter descramble the transmitted data. A paid-up subscriber will receive, for<br>
example, in a broadcast monthly EMM (Entitlement Management Message) the<br>
exploitation key necessary to decrypt the encrypted control word so as to permit<br>
viewing of the transmission.<br>
An interactive system 16, also connected to the multiplexer 4 and the<br>
receiver/decoder 13 and again located partly in the broadcast centre and partly in the<br>
receiver/decoder, enables the end user to interact with various applications via a<br>
modemmed back channel 17. The modemmed back channel may also be used for<br>
communications used in the conditional access system 15.<br>
Conditional Access System<br>
With reference to Figure 2, in overview the conditional access system 15 includes a<br>
Subscriber Authorization System (SAS) 30. The SAS 30 is connected to one or more<br>
Subscriber Management Systems (SMS) 32, one SMS for each broadcast supplier, by<br><br>
a link 34, which may be a TCP-IP link or other type of link. Alternatively, one SMS<br>
could be shared between two commercial operators, or one operator could use two<br>
SMSs, and so on.<br>
First encrypting units in the form of ciphering units 36 utilising "mother" smartcards<br>
38 are connected to the SAS by linkage 40. Second encrypting units again in the form<br>
of ciphering units 42 utilising mother smartcards 44 are connected to the multiplexer<br>
4 by linkage 46. The receiver/decoder 13 receives a "daughter" smartcard 48. The<br>
receiver/decoder is connected directly to the SAS 30 via Communications Servers 50<br>
and the modemmed back channel 17. The SAS sends amongst other things<br>
subscription rights to the daughter smartcard on request.<br>
The smartcards contain confidential information from one or more commercial<br>
operators. The "mother" smartcard encrypts different kinds of messages and the<br>
"daughter" smartcards decrypt the messages, if they have the rights to do so.<br>
With reference to Figure 2, in the broadcast centre, the digital video signal is first<br>
compressed (or bit rate reduced), using the MPEG-2 compressor 3. This compressed<br>
signal is then transmitted to the multiplexer and scrambler 4 in order to be multiplexed<br>
with other data, such as other compressed data.<br>
The scrambler generates a control word used in the scrambling process and included<br>
in the MPEG-2 stream in the multiplexer 4. The control word is generated internally<br>
and enables the end user"s integrated receiver/decoder 13 to descramble the<br>
programme.<br>
Access criteria, indicating how the programme is commercialised, are also added to<br>
the MPEG-2 stream. The programme may be commercialised in either one of a<br>
number of "subscription" modes and/or one of a number of "Pay Per View" (PPV)<br>
modes or events. In the subscription mode, the end user subscribes to one or more<br>
commercial offers, or "bouquets", thus getting the rights to watch every channel inside<br>
those bouquets. In the Pay Per View mode, the end user is provided with the<br>
capability to purchase events as he wishes.<br><br>
Both the control word and the access criteria are used to build an Entitlement Control<br>
Message (ECM); this is a message sent in relation with one scrambled program; the<br>
message contains a control word (which allows for the descrambling of the program)<br>
and the access criteria of the broadcast program. The. access criteria and control word<br>
are transmitted to the second encrypting unit 42 via the linkage 46. In this unit, an<br>
ECM is generated, encrypted and transmitted on to the multiplexer and scrambler 4.<br>
Each service broadcast by a broadcast supplier in a data stream comprises a number<br>
of distinct components; for example a television programme includes a video<br>
component, an audio component, a sub-title component and so on. Each of these<br>
components of a service is individually scrambled and encrypted for subsequent<br>
broadcast. In respect of each scrambled component of the service, a separate ECM<br>
is required.<br>
The multiplexer 4 receives electrical signals comprising encrypted EMMs from the<br>
SAS 30, encrypted ECMs from the second encrypting unit 42 and compressed<br>
programmes from the compressor 3. The multiplexer 4 scrambles the programmes and<br>
transmits the scrambled programmes, the encrypted EMMs and the encrypted ECMs<br>
as electric signals to broadcast system 54, which may be for example a satellite system<br>
as shown in Figure 1, or other broadcast system. The receiver/decoder 13<br>
demultiplexes the signals to obtain scrambled programmes with encrypted EMMs and<br>
encrypted ECMs.<br>
The receiver/decoder receives the broadcast signal and extracts the MPEG-2 data<br>
stream. If a programme is scrambled, the receiver/decoder 13 extracts the<br>
corresponding ECM from the MPEG-2 stream and passes the ECM to the "daughter"<br>
smartcard 48 of the end user. This slots into a housing in the receiver/decoder 13.<br>
The daughter smartcard 48 controls whether the end user has the right to decrypt the<br>
ECM and to access the programme. If not, a negative status is passed to the<br>
receiver/decoder 13 to indicate that the programme cannot be descrambled. If the end<br>
user does have the rights, the ECM is decrypted and the control word extracted. The<br>
decoder 13 can then descramble the programme using this control word. The MPEG-2<br>
stream is decompressed and translated into a video signal for onward transmission to<br>
television set 14.<br><br>
If the programme is not scrambled, no ECM will have been transmitted with the<br>
MPEG-2 stream and the receiver/decoder 13 decompresses the data and transforms the<br>
signal into a video signal for transmission to television set 14.<br>
The Subscriber Management System (SMS) 30 includes a database 52 which manages,<br>
amongst others, all of the end user files, commercial offers (such as tariffs and<br>
promotions), subscriptions, PPV details, and data regarding end user consumption and<br>
authorization. The SMS may be physically remote from the SAS.<br>
The SMS 32 transmits messages to the SAS 30 which imply modifications to or<br>
creations of Entitlement Management Messages (EMMs) to be transmitted to end<br>
users. The SMS 32 also transmits messages to the SAS 30 which imply no<br>
modifications or creations of EMMs but imply only a change in an end user"s state<br>
(relating to the authorization granted to the end user when ordering products or to the<br>
amount that the end user will be charged). The SAS 30 also sends messages (typically<br>
requesting information such as call-back information or billing information) to the<br>
SMS 32, so that it will be apparent that communication between the two is two-way.<br>
Entitlement Management Messages (EMMs)<br>
The EMM is a message dedicated to an individual end user (subscriber), or a group<br>
of end users, only, in contrast with an ECM, which is dedicated to one scrambled<br>
programme only or a set of scrambled programmes if part of the same commercial<br>
offer.<br>
Various specific types of EMM are possible. Individual EMMs are dedicated to<br>
individual subscribers, and are typically used in the provision of Pay Per View<br>
services; these contain the group identifier and the position of the subscriber in that<br>
group. So-called "Group" subscription EMMs are dedicated to groups of, say, 256<br>
individual users, and are typically used in the administration of some subscription<br>
services. Audience EMMs are dedicated to entire audiences. An "audience" is the<br>
totality of subscribers having smartcards which bear the same Operator Identifier<br>
(OPI). Finally, a "unique" EMM is addressed to the unique identifier of the<br>
smartcard.<br><br>
In preferred embodiments, audience EMMs are used to convey messages to specific<br>
groups of users.<br>
The general form of an EMM which is used in the preferred embodiments is now<br>
described with reference to Figure 3. Basically, the EMM, which is implemented as<br>
a series of digital data bits, comprises a header 60, the EMM proper 62, and a<br>
signature 64. The header 60 in turn comprises a type identifier 66 to identify the type<br>
of EMM, a length identifier 68 which gives the length of the EMM, an optional<br>
address 70 for the EMM, an operator identifier 72 and a key identifier 74. Finally,<br>
the signature 64, which is also optional, provides a number of checks against<br>
corruption of the remaining data in the EMM. The type identifer in the header<br>
identifies the message as an EMM. The EMM proper 62 is the payload part of the EMM,<br>
i.e. Without header 60 and Signature 64.<br>
Subscriber Authorization System (SAS)<br>
Messages generated by the SMS 32 are passed via linkage 34 to the Subscriber<br>
Authorization System (SAS) 30, which in turn generates messages acknowledging<br>
receipt of the messages generated by the SMS 32 and passes these acknowledgements<br>
to the SMS 32. Messages which may be passed to the SAS include subscriber<br>
suspension, for example, due to non-payment, subscriber modification, for example to<br>
add or remove certain commercial offers, and provide rights, for example for a<br>
specific event in FPV mode.<br>
The SAS 30 manages databases that store the status of all subscribers declared by the<br>
SMS 32. According to the status and the various messages sent by the SMS, the SAS<br>
generates EMMs for the subscribers" smartcards. The EMMs are ciphered by the SAS<br>
ciphering units 36 and sent to the multiplexer 4. To ensure mat the EMMs are<br>
received by the subscriber, the SAS sends these messages cyclically. The cycle<br>
depends on the type of EMM, but is typically between 30 seconds and 30 minutes.<br>
A typical configuration of the SAS 30 is shown in Figure 4. In overview the SAS 30<br>
comprises a Subscription Chain area 100 to give rights for subscription mode and to<br>
renew the rights automatically each month, a Pay Per View (PPV) Chain area 102 to<br>
give rights for PPV events, and an EMM Injector 104 for passing EMMs created by<br>
the Subscription and PPV chain areas to the multiplexer and scrambler 4, and hence<br><br>
to feed the MPEG stream with EMMs. If other rights are to be granted, such as Pay<br>
Per File (PPF) rights in the case of downloading computer software to a user"s<br>
Personal Computer, other similar areas are also provided.<br>
One function of the SAS 30 is to manage the access rights to television programmes,<br>
available as commercial offers in subscription mode or sold as PPV events according<br>
to different modes of commercialisation (pre-book mode, impulse mode). The SAS<br>
30, according to those rights and to information received from the SMS 32, generates<br>
EMMs for the subscriber.<br>
With reference to Figure 4, the Subscription Chain area 100 comprises a Command<br>
Interface (CI) 106, a Subscriber Technical Management (STM) server 108, a Message<br>
Generator (MG) 110, and the Ciphering Unit 36. The PPV Chain area 102 comprises an<br>
Authorisation Server (AS) 112, Database Servers 114, 116 which contain relational<br>
databases for storing relevant details of the end users, Order Centralized Server (OCS)<br>
118, a Server for Programme Broadcaster (SPB) 120, a Message Generator (MG) 122<br>
whose function is basically the same as that for the Subscription Chain area, and<br>
Ciphering Unit 36.<br>
The EMM Injector 104 comprises a plurality of Message Emitters (MEs) 124, 126,<br>
128 and 130 and Software Multiplexers (SMUXs) 132 and 134. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, there are two MESs, 124 and 126 for the Message Generator 110, with the<br>
other two MEs 128 and 130 for the Message Generator 122. MEs 124 and 128 are<br>
connected to the SMUX 132 whilst ME s 126 and 130 are connected to the SMUX 134.<br>
The Message Generators 110 and 122 transform commands issued by the STM 108<br>
and the OCS 118, respectively, into EMMs. The MGs determine the duration and the<br>
rate of emission of the EMMs. The MGs also cipher the EMMs using a dedicated<br>
ciphering unit. They then pass the ciphered EMM to the respective MEs, which<br>
transmit the EMMs cyclically. As shown in Figure 4, more than one ME can be<br>
connected to a single MG, the appropriate ME being determined by the MG according<br>
to the operator referred to in the EMM. During the lifetime of a given EMM, the MG<br>
stores it inside its own database. The EMM is erased from the database as soon as its<br><br>
emission duration has expired. This database ensures consistency between the MG and<br>
ME.<br>
The Message Emitters 124, 126, 128, 130 receive EMMs from the respective MGs<br>
along with several parameters, such as broadcast start date, broadcast stop date, and<br>
broadcast cycle. The MGs then manage the broadcast of the EMMs according to the<br>
specified parameters.<br>
Mail Messages<br>
The present broadcasting system 1 is adapted to send mail messages, typically in the<br>
form of an ASCII string, from the commercial operator (broadcast supplier) at the<br>
SMS to a user"s receiver/decoder. Mail messages generally consist of text messages<br>
which are intended for display on a users television set. Mail messages may be sent<br>
in the form of a particular type of EMM, or by other means. In the present<br>
embodiment so-called Audience Mail Messages are used to convey mail messages to<br>
particular groups of subscribers.<br>
Audience Mail Messages allow a commercial operator to send a message to all users<br>
in a particular group, without the need to address each user in the group individually.<br>
This can optimise the bandwidth used for transmitting messages, since few messages<br>
need be transmitted.<br>
The users to whom an Audience Mail Message is addressed may be selected depending<br>
on one or more parameters. Examples of such parameters are as follows:<br>
Geographic zone. The message is only available to users within the specified<br>
geographic zone.<br>
Customer category. The message is only available to users having a specified<br>
customer category such as cinema, football, rugby, age, etc.<br>
Commercial offer. The message is only available to subscribers to the<br>
specified commercial offer.<br>
Session number. The message is only available to users who have access to<br>
the specified session.<br>
Product number. The message is only available to users to a particular<br>
product.<br><br>
In this way, messages intended for certain groups of users may be directed to users<br>
within that group but not to other users. For example, a bad weather warning may be<br>
directed to users within a specific geographic zone, or people who subscribed to a<br>
particular film (with an associated product number) could be informed that the sequel<br>
to that film will be broadcast, or people who subscribe to a particular channel (as part<br>
of a commercial offer), such as a wildlife channel could be informed that a particular<br>
wildlife programme is about to begin.<br>
In order to send an Audience Mail Message, the operator sends an Audience Mail<br>
Message command from the SMS 32 to the SAS 30. Referring to Figure 5, Audience<br>
Mail Message command 150 comprises a command identifier 152, which identifies the<br>
command as an Audience Mail Message command, operator identifier 154, which<br>
identifies the operator, one or more identifiers 156 which specify the group of users<br>
for whom the mail message is intended, a priority field 158, and the text message 160<br>
in the form of an ASCII string.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the group addressed depends on one of more of at least<br>
geographic area, customer category, commercial offer, session number and product<br>
number. Depending on the implementation, only one identifiers may be used with any<br>
one mail message, or a plurality of identifiers may be used. In the latter case, the<br>
plurality of identifiers may be combined using logical operators such as AND, OR,<br>
XOR and/or NOT, as specified in the command.<br>
Use of logical operators enables several criteria to be used to target specific groups of<br>
users. As an example, several geographic zones may exist, Marseille being one of<br>
them, and Paris another, and the audience may have been split into different customer<br>
categories, such as cinema, football, rugby etc. If the product reference for a specific<br>
football match between Marseille and Paris is 1234, then a message could be sent to<br>
fans of the two clubs who have not yet purchased the match, advising them of the<br>
match, by using the following combination:<br>
(Geographical_Zone = Marseille OR Geographical_Zone = Paris) AND Customer_Category<br>
= Football AND NOT Product = 1234<br><br>
In certain implementations parentheses may not be available, in which case two<br>
messages could be sent to groups of users using the following combinations:<br>
Geographical_Zone = Marseille AND Customer_Category = Football AND NOT Product =<br>
1234<br>
Geographical_Zonc = Paris AND Customer_Category = Football AND NOT Product = 1234<br>
In either case, the logical operators which are to be used are defined by the operator<br>
and included in parameters 156 in command 150 from the SMS. 32 to the SAS 30.<br>
The priority field 158 specifies the priority of the message. If the priority field is left<br>
blank, the message is assigned a normal priority.<br>
When the SAS receives an Audience Mail Message command it constructs a special<br>
EMM in order to transmit the message to the user. Referring again to Figure 4, the<br>
command sent from the SMS is received by the Command Interface (CI) 106 and<br>
passed to the Subscriber Technical Management (STM) server 108. The STM server<br>
108 identifies the command as an Audience Mail Message command. It then sends<br>
a command to the Message Generator (MG) to generate an Audience Mail Message<br>
EMM.<br>
The Message Generator (MG) 110 generates an Audience Mail Message in the form<br>
of an EMM on receiving the command from the STM server 108. The structure of<br>
the Audience Mail Message EMM is shown in Figure 6. Referring to Figure 6, the<br>
EMM 200 comprises a header 202, EMM proper 208, and, optionally, signature 226.<br>
Header 202 contains a type identifier 204 and an operator identifier 206 as well as<br>
other information as described above with reference to Figure 3. The type identifier<br>
identifies the EMM as a group EMM, that is, as specific to a group of users.<br>
The EMM proper 208 comprises an identifier 210 which identifies the EMM as an<br>
Audience Mail Message EMM, a number of identifiers 212, 214, 216, 218 which<br>
specify the group to which the EMM is addressed, a logical operator field 220 which<br>
specifies one or more logical operator, a priority specifier 222, index 224, and the text<br><br>
message 226.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, each identifier 212, 214, 216, 218 comprises two parts, the<br>
first part specifying which characteristic that identifier relates to, and the second<br>
specifying the value. In an alternative embodiment, each characteristic is allocated a<br>
particular part of the EMM, in which case each identifier merely comprises a value.<br>
Referring to Figure 6, in a particular example, identifier 212, which is two bytes long,<br>
specifies a commercial offer; identifier 214, which is also two bytes long, specifies a<br>
geographic zone; identifier 216, which is three bytes long, specifies a session number,<br>
and identifier 218, which is three bytes long, specifies a product number. In any<br>
particular EMM, one or more of the above identifiers may be missing; for example,<br>
a simple implementation may include a single identifier having a first part specifying<br>
which characteristic that identifier relates to, and a second part specifying the value.<br>
Logical operator field 220 specifies one or more logical operator, such as AND, OR,<br>
XOR and/or NOT that is to be applied to the identifiers 212, 214, 216 and 218, as<br>
specified in the command 150 from the SMS 32 to the SAS 30. The priority specifier<br>
222 takes a value depending on the priority of the message, as specified by the<br>
operator in the command from the SMS to the SAS. Index 224 takes a value which<br>
is specific to that particular EMM, so that that EMM can be identified. Mail message<br>
226, which is typically 89 bytes long, contains the actual text message, in the form of<br>
an ASCII string, which is to be conveyed to the user.<br>
The MG 110 also determines the broadcast start and stop time and cycle rate of the<br>
EMM. The length of time for which a EMM is to be broadcast and the cycle rate are<br>
generally set to a certain value for Audience Mail Message EMMs, but they might be<br>
altered, for example, in dependence on the priority of the message (as specified by the<br>
operator) or the global bitrate of the broadcast signal.<br>
Once the EMM has been generated, it is optionally ciphered using Ciphering Unit 36.<br>
The EMM may be ciphered, for example, if it is desired to keep the mail message<br>
confidential.<br><br>
The EMM, together with the broadcast start and stop time and cycle rate, are then<br>
passed to the EMM injector 104. The EMM injector is responsible for inserting the<br>
EMM into the broadcast data stream at the appropriate times, in dependence on the<br>
broadcast start and stop time and cycle rate. The EMM is stored in a database at the<br>
Message Emitter (ME) 124 or 126. The EMM is inserted into the broadcast data<br>
stream by the appropriate software multiplexer (SMUX) 132 or 134, and multiplexer<br>
4. The EMM is then transmitted in the broadcast signal for reception by the<br>
receiver/decoder 13.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, receiver/decoder 13 comprises tuner 250 and demodulator 252<br>
for receiving and demodulating, respectively, the broadcast signal. The demodulated<br>
signal is passed to demultiplexer 254, which separates the various components of the<br>
signal. Audio signals are passed to audio processor 256, video signals are passed to<br>
video processor 258, and EMMs are passed to central processing unit (CPU) 260 and<br>
stored in a buffer. EMMs which are ciphered are deciphered by a deciphering unit<br>
266 in the receiver/decoder.<br>
A program, called a mail application, which is run on the CPU, allows the user to<br>
access Audience Mail Messages. The mail application extracts the various identifiers<br>
which specify the group of users for whom the message is intended. Stored in the<br>
CPU memory are various user identifiers, such as geographic zone and customer<br>
category of the user, and commercial offers, products and sessions which the user has<br>
purchased. The mail application compares the identifiers extracted from the EMM to<br>
the corresponding user identifiers. Where logical operators are included in the logical<br>
operator field 220 of the EMM, the application extracts the logical operators and<br>
applies them to the identifiers. In this way, the application is able to determine<br>
whether the user is one of the users for whom the Audience Mail Message is intended.<br>
Taking the above example of a football match between Marseille and Paris, the<br>
application would check whether the geographic zone of the subscriber was Marseille<br>
or Paris, whether the customer category was (or included) football, and whether the<br>
user had not purchased product number 1234.<br>
If the mail application decides that the user does not fulfil the criteria, then it removes<br><br>
the EMM from the buffer, and takes no further action. If the application decides that<br>
it does fulfil the criteria, then it extracts the mail message 226 from the EMM and<br>
stores it in a mail message buffer ("mailbox") in the CPU memory. The application<br>
then indicates to the user that there is mail waiting. This may be done either by<br>
producing an indication on the receiver/decoder display, or by displaying a message<br>
or icon on the television screen. In the latter case, graphic processor 264 is<br>
responsible for combining the message or icon with the video image.<br>
Once the user has been informed that mail is waiting, he can access his mailbox and<br>
display the message on the screen. The mail application is responsible for extracting<br>
the text of the message from the Audience Mail Message EMM and displaying it on<br>
the user"s television screen, via graphic processor 264, in response to a request from<br>
the user.<br>
In some circumstances, for example, if the message has been assigned a high priority,<br>
the message is displayed directly on the television screen without the user taking any<br>
action. For example, in the case of a storm warning, the message may be assigned a<br>
high priority, and the receiver/decoder would then display the message directly on the<br>
television screen.<br>
Finally, when the receiver/decoder has received a mail EMM, it "burns" the EMM, so<br>
that the message is not repeatedly displayed. This is done by comparing incoming<br>
mail EMMs to ones that have already been received, by using the index 224 in the<br>
EMM. Incoming EMMs which have the same index as EMMs which have already<br>
been received, are removed from the buffer.<br>
To summarise, the commercial operator can send a message (ASCII string) to a group<br>
of subscribers. In order to do so, the DSTB contains a number of internal buffers in<br>
which it can store these messages. When the DSTB receives such a message, it<br>
instructs the subscriber (via a message on the TV set, for example) to consult his<br>
"mailbox". The viewer uses specific menus to display these messages on the TV<br>
screen.<br>
A specific command is used to allow the SMS to send such messages. The command<br><br>
contains the following information:<br>
• The unique smartcard identifier<br>
• The message itself, in the form of an ASCII string<br>
• Optionally, the priority of the message (Normal or Urgent). If the priority is<br>
omitted, the message has normal priority.<br>
The group addressed depends on optional parameters:<br>
• No additional parameters - All the operator"s smartcards are addressed.<br>
• Commercial offer - Only smartcards possessing the commercial offer store the<br>
message<br>
• Geographic zone - Only smarteards having the specified geographical zone<br>
number store the message.;<br>
• Session number - Only smartcards possessing the session number store the<br>
message.<br>
In one embodiment, only one of the methods used to select the group to be addressed<br>
can be used for any one message.<br>
It will be understood that the present invention has been described above purely by<br>
way of example, and modifications of detail can be made within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
