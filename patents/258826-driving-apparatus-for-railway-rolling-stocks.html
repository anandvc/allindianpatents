				<td>DRIVING APPARATUS FOR RAILWAY ROLLING STOCKS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1- Field of Art<br>
The present invention relates to a driving apparatus for railway rolling stocks-2. Description of Relevant Art<br>
For the railway rolling stock, recent years have observed increasing traffic volumes, in particular of freight shipments abroad shipping a great amount of cargo at a time, with increasing needs for a motive power locomotive for traction with an increased capacity. For electric locomotives, in general, the driving apparatus is configured with a main motor arranged parallel to an axle, a pinion fit on an end of an output shaft of the main motor, and a gear meshing therewith and fit on the axle, for transmission of torque from the main motor to the axle <br>
Such the configuration of driving apparatus for railway rolling stocks employs a structure for' a distance between a center axis of the main motor's shaft and a center axis of the axle to be a center to-center distance between the pinion and the gear, where the axle is provided with axle bearings, which are fixed in positions to both ends of the main motor at a prescribed spacing from each other, so’ that the gear as well as the pinion can keep a prescribed dimensional relationship to the main motor. The gear fit on the axle is. adapted for transmission of torque transmitted thereto from the main motor through the pinion, to the axle. Thus, for a pair of fit portions of and between the gear and the axle, their diameters, fit length<br><br>
in between, and tightening margin in between are determined so that they can be kept from slipping, even with an abnormality of the main motor applying them greater torque than specified maximum torque. To this point, as torque is transmitted from the main motor through the pinion and the gear to the axle, as described, and therefrom to wheels, the pair of fit portions of and between the gear and the axle should have their diameters, fit length, and tightening margin determined to endure transmission of a magnitude of torque that allows the wheels to roll on rail surfaces, by friction of the rail surfaces,<br>
For a respective pair of fit portions of and between the axle and the gear and wheels, assuming a constant tightening margin in between, the magnitude of transmittable torque is proportional to the fit surface area, so that the diameters and/or the fit length of the paired fit portions should be increased, as the main motor has greater torque. As the magnitude of torque to be output from the main motor increases, the diameter as well as the length of the main motor is to be increased. Teeth of the gear should also be rendered stronger, needing a greater tooth width.<br>
Such being the case, for an increased output of electric locomotive, it is necessary to make greater the size of the main motor and the teeth width of the gear, as well as fit portions of and between the gear and the axle, and fit portions of and between the axle and the wheels. On the other hand, the rail gauge is fixedly predetermined, so that the driving apparatus to be assembled within a space between a wheel at the drive side and a wheel opposite the drive side receives a restriction from<br><br>
the axial length of the axle, and unable to be longer than a prescribed length. Therefore, for greater torque to be transmitted by fitting the gear and the wheels, it is necessary to increase diametrical dimensions of associated fit portions, as a matter of course.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a driving apparatus for locomotives according to a related art. According to this related art, the driving apparatus for locomotives includes a gear 102 fit on an axle 101, and a pair of wheels 103 fit on both end portions of the axle 101. A main motor 104 is arranged in position, with its shaft 104a in parallel to the axle 101. The main motor 104 is fixed at a distance off from the axle 101, by use of axle bearings 105. The main motor 104 has a pinion 106 fit on an end of the shaft 104a, and the pinion 106 has a center-to-center distance held to the gear 102 by the axle bearings 105. The gear 102 and the pinion 106 are commonly covered by a gear casing 107, for a hermetical sealing from outside air. It is noted that journal bearings 20 are put on both ends of the axle 1, at outer sides of the wheels 3 and 9.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a driving apparatus for railway rolling stocks as addressed to high-power locomotives according to another related art. According to this related art, the driving apparatus for railway rolling stocks includes a large-capacity main motor 104 arranged in position, with its shaft 104a in parallel to an axle 101. The main motor 104 is fixed at a distance off from the axle 101, by use of axle bearings 105. The main motor 104 has a pinion 106 fit on an end of the shaft 104a, and the pinion 106 has a center-to-center distance held to a gear<br><br>
102 by the axle bearings 105. The gear 102 and the pinion 106 are commonly covered by a gear casing 107, for a hermetical sealing from outside air. This structure is analogous to that of that related art shown in Fig, 6_ However, in this related art, for great output torque from the large capacity main motor 104 to be transmitted between the gear 102 and a wheel 108 at the drive side without slips along their fit surfaces, the wheel 108 is formed with a boss portion 108a elongated along the axle 101. And, for a fitting to the axle 101, the gear 102 is configured to fit on an outer circumferential surface of the boss portion 108a elongated as a fit portion of the wheel 108 in the axial direction of the axle 101. According to this related art, although the gear 102 has an identical fit length to the boss portion 108a, their fit portions have increased diameters, allowing the increases in diameters of the fit portions to transmit the more greater torque.<br>
However, for the driving apparatus for railway rolling stocks as addressed to high-power locomotives, the fitting between the wheel 108 and the axle 101 employs a structure with an elongate total fit length and an increased tightening margin, which constitutes a difficulty in press fitting, requiring extreme caution, and if they are press fit with overlooked minor burrs or scrapes left at the fitting inlet, the fit surfaces may be injured, giving damages to the axle 101 in most cases. The press fitting of the wheel 108 onto the axle 101 is done, not simply in the manufacture, but also in the way of use at the user, where replacement of a wheel is performed, as the wheel is worn by a constant rate of abrasion, and to be carried out<br><br>
after a service about one-year in an earliest case, together with a pulling-out, which affects more adversely, as the wheel boss portion 108a has an increased fit length. Further, for the wheel 108 as a component to be worn and replaced with lapse of a constant term of use as described, the boss portion 108a to be fit with an increased length may render the manufacturing cost of wheel 108 higher, with increased expenses for wheel replacement and maintenance, either, as a problem.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
There will be described below the preferred embodiments of the present invention into details with reference to the accompanying drawings. Like members or elements will be designated by like reference characters.<br>
(First Embodiment)<br>
Fig, 1 shows a driving apparatus for railway rolling stocks according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In this driving apparatus for railway rolling stocks, a wheel 9 at the drive side is fit on one end portion of an axle 1, and a wheel 3 opposite the drive side is fit on the other end portion of the axle 1. A main motor 4 is arranged in position, with its shaft 4a in parallel to the axle 1. The main motor 4 is fixed at a distance off from the axle 1 by axle bearings 5, A pinion 6 is fit on an end of the shaft 4a of the main motor 4, and for this pinion 6 to be put in meshing engagement with a gear 2 fit on the axle 1, a center-to-center distance between the gear 2 and the pinion 6 is held by the axle bearings 5. The gear 2 and the pinion 6 are configured to be commonly covered by a gear casing 1,   for a hermetical sealing from outside air.<br>
Further’- this driving apparatus for railway rolling stocks includes a boss member 10 configured to be elongate in the axial direction of the axle 1, and fit on the axle 1* The boss member 10 has a wheel-fitting boss portion lOA as its one<br><br>
half in the axial direction and a gear-fitting boss portion lOB as its other half in the axial direction, with a setting D &gt; d, where D is an outside diameter of the wheel-fitting boss portion lOA, and d is an outside diameter of the gear-fitting boss portion lOB. For a fit portion of the wheel 9 on the wheel-fitting boss portion lOA, the diameter D is set to be adequate in size for transmission of large torque from the main motor 4 . Also for a fit portion of the gear 2 on the gear-fitting boss portion lOB, the diameter d is set to be adequate in size for transmission of large torque from the main motor 4 through the pinion 6, It is noted that journal bearings 20 are put on both ends of the axle 1, at outer sides of the wheels 3 and 9.<br>
For railway rolling stocks, both a wheel 9 at the drive side and a wheel 3 opposite the drive side are worn by their friction with rails, as they run, needing their replacement every constant interval. In this respect, according to the present embodiment, the replacement is facilitated, in particular of the wheel 9 at the drive side, which is fit on the wheel-fitting boss portion lOA of the boss member 10, as a single member to be pulled off from the wheel-fitting boss portion lOA for replacement thereof.<br>
Such being the case, according to the present embodiment, the replacement of wheel 9 is very facile, in comparison with the driving apparatus for railway rolling stocks as addressed to high-power locomotives according to the related art shown in Fig. 7, in which the wheel 108 is integrally formed with the boss portion 108a, on which the gear 102 also is fit, disabling the wheel 108 to be pulled off as a single member, in addition<br><br>
to that the wheel 108 has an elongate boss-fit length constituting a difficulty in work to pull off the wheel 108 from the axle 101. Further, the separate configuration of wheel 9 and boss member 10 permits the wheel 9 to be reduced in size as a consumable supply that can be manufactured at a low price in comparison with a wheel in the related art, allowing for reduction in both manufacturing cost and maintenance cost.<br>
