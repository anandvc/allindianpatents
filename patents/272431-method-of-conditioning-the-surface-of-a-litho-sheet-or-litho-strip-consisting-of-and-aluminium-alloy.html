				<td>Method for cleaning an aluminium workpiece<br>
The invention relates to a method of conditioning the<br>
surface of a work piece, in particular of a litho-strip or<br>
litho-sheet, consisting of an aluminium alloy.<br>
Work pieces such as strips or sheets consisting of an<br>
aluminium alloy are often surface treated after finishing<br>
rolling to prepare them for the next manufacturing step.<br>
In particular strips or sheet for lithographic printing<br>
are conditioned to achieve a predetermined surface<br>
roughness in a subsequent graining process. Litho-strips<br>
or sheets are usually degreased after finishing rolling.<br>
As known from the US-patent specification US 5,997,721,<br>
degreasing respectively cleaning of the surface is done in<br>
one step by anodising the aluminium alloy sheet with AC<br>
current in an acidic electrolyte bath. Another way to<br>
degrease or clean aluminium slivers is known from the<br>
German patent DE 43 17 815 C1 namely the use of an<br>
alkaline medium. But from the use of alkaline, media it is<br>
known that they do not remove every features of the<br>
subsurface microcrystalline layer, in particular oxide<br>
particles, which are present on or near the surface of the<br>
rolled aluminium strips.<br>
However, prior electro-chemical graining the litho-strips<br>
are usually subjected to sodium hydroxide in a pre-<br>
treatment to degrease and clean the surface again, which<br>
process together with the electro-chemical graining is<br>
herein further called surface roughening process of litho-<br><br>
strips. In principle surface roughening is done by the<br>
manufacture of lithographic printing plates. Due to the<br>
increasing manufacturing speed of surface roughening of<br>
the litho-strips time for the pre-treatment of the surface<br>
of the litho-strips and for the electro-chemical graining<br>
decreases. It has been found that due to the increasing<br>
manufacturing speed the pre-treatment with sodium<br>
hydroxide is not sufficient enough to remove all<br>
contaminants from the surface of the litho-strip. As a<br>
consequence, the results in electro-chemical graining are<br>
not stable and surface defects occur on electro-chemically<br>
grained litho-strips or sheets. However, a reduction of<br>
the manufacturing speed causes higher production costs for<br>
lithographic printing plates.<br>
Furthermore, methods of conditioning the surface of a<br>
litho-strip including two steps require relative high<br>
expenses related to facility equipments.<br>
Hence, it is an object of the invention to provide a<br>
method for conditioning the surface of a work piece and a<br>
work piece consisting of an aluminium alloy enabling an<br>
increasing manufacturing speed in surface roughening and<br>
maintaining at the same time a high quality of the grained<br>
surface of the work piece with relative low effort related<br>
to facility equipment<br>
According to a first teaching of the present invention the<br>
above mentioned object is solved by a method of<br>
conditioning the surface of an aluminium work piece<br>
consisting of an aluminium alloy, which method comprises<br>
at least the step of degreasing the surface of the work<br>
piece with a degreasing medium, wherein the aqueous<br>
degreasing medium contains at least 1,5 to 3 % by weight<br><br>
of a composite of 5 - 40 % sodium tripolyphosphate,<br>
3 - 10 % sodium gluconate, 3 - 8 % of a composite of non-<br>
ionic and anionic surfactants and optionally 0,5 % to 70 %<br>
soda, preferably 30 - 70 % soda, wherein sodium hydroxide<br>
is added to the aqueous degreasing medium such that the<br>
concentration of sodium hydroxide in the aqueous<br>
degreasing medium is 0,01 to 5 % by weight, preferably<br>
0,1 to 1,5 % by weight, more preferably 1 to 2,5 % by<br>
weight.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the combination of the<br>
use of the degreasing medium together with added sodium<br>
hydroxide ensures an increased manufacturing speed during<br>
surface roughening including electro-chemical graining<br>
with sufficient results despite of the fact that oxide<br>
particles are not removed completely during degreasing.<br>
The reason for the good results is seen in the fact that<br>
due to the addition of sodium hydroxide the degreasing<br>
medium has an increased pickling rate which removes more<br>
aluminium from the surface at the same time. In<br>
combination with the described pre-treatment of for<br>
example litho-strips it has been surprisingly found that<br>
the electro-chemical graining process of litho-strips can<br>
be done with a lower charge entry therefore enabling a<br>
higher manufacturing speed. While the addition of 0,1 % to<br>
1,5 % by weight sodium hydroxide is suitable even for<br>
lower manufacturing speeds during degreasing, with the<br>
addition of 1 % to 2,5 % by weight sodium hydroxide<br>
highest manufacturing speeds during degreasing are<br>
achievable ensuring at the same time high manufacturing<br>
speeds during plate manufacturing, i.e. during electro-<br>
chemical graining. The optional addition of soda in an<br>
amount of 0,5 - 70 %, preferably 30 to 70 % by weight<br>
allows to control pH-value of the degreasing medium.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the<br>
time of application of the degreasing medium to the<br>
surface of the aluminium work piece is at maximum 1 to 7<br>
s, preferably at maximum 2 to 5 s. These application times<br>
ensure high production speeds at the same time ensuring<br>
that the oxide islands can easily be removed by surface<br>
roughening.<br>
To increase pickling effect of the degreasing medium the<br>
temperature of the degreasing medium is 50 to 85 °C,<br>
preferably 65 °C to 75 °C.<br>
More preferably, the pH-value of the aqueous degreasing<br>
medium is from 10 to 14, preferably 10 to 13,5.<br>
According to a next advantageous embodiment, the work<br>
piece is a strip or a sheet, in particular a litho-strip<br>
or a litho-sheet. In this case the necessary electro-<br>
chemical graining process for manufacturing litho-strips<br>
or litho-sheets can be accomplished thoroughly within less<br>
time and the printing plate manufacturing speed can be<br>
increased. Furthermore, the charge entry needed can be<br>
reduced while providing a fully grained strip or sheet<br>
surface.<br>
More preferably, the inventive conditioning method is<br>
accomplished subsequent the manufacturing of a strip, in<br>
particular a litho-strip, and the conditioned strip is<br>
reeled on a coil. In this case a coil of a conditioned<br>
litho-strip can be provided comprising an optimum<br>
performance in further surface roughening processes used<br>
to manufacture lithographic printing plates.<br><br>
According to a second teaching of the present invention<br>
the above mentioned object is solved by a work piece<br>
consisting of an aluminium alloy conditioned by the<br>
inventive method. As outlined before, the inventive work<br>
piece provides a cleaned surface with an optimum<br>
performance for a subsequent electro-chemical graining<br>
process.<br>
More preferably, the work piece is a strip or a sheet, in<br>
particular a litho-strip or a litho-sheet. Litho-strip or<br>
sheets are produced for lithographic printing plates and<br>
differ from "normal" sheets due to the aluminium alloy<br>
they consist of and their specific thickness, which is<br>
typically less than 1 mm, preferably 0,14 to 0,5 mm, more<br>
preferably 0,25 to 0,3 mm. Furthermore, the surface of<br>
litho-strips and sheets has to be prepared for a<br>
roughening process, since manufacturing of lithographic<br>
printing plates generally comprises an electro-chemical<br>
graining process to prepare the surface of the<br>
lithographic printing plates for the printing process.<br>
With the inventive sheets or strips, in particular with<br>
the inventive litho-sheets or litho-strips, the necessary<br>
electro-chemical graining of the surface can be<br>
accomplished in shorter time with a reduced charge entry.<br>
Beside an optimised surface of the inventive work piece<br>
the mechanical features and an improved graining structure<br>
during electro-chemical graining can be provided if the<br>
aluminium alloy of the work piece is one of the aluminium<br>
alloys AA1050, AA1100, AA3103 or AlMgO,5. These aluminium<br>
alloys provide the mechanical strength needed for<br>
lithographic printing plates while enabling due to the low<br>
amount of alloying constituents a homogeneous graining of<br><br>
the surface. However, work pieces consisting of other<br>
aluminium alloys may provide the same advantages.<br>
According to a more preferably embodiment of the inventive<br>
work piece the aluminium alloy contains the following<br>
alloying constituents in percent by weight:<br><br>
impurities each less than 0,005 % in sum max.<br>
0,15 %, rest Al<br>
or<br><br>
impurities each less than 0,005 % in sum max.<br>
0,15 %, rest Al<br>
or<br><br><br>
impurities each less than 0,005% in sum max.<br>
0,15 %, rest Al.<br>
Work pieces consisting of one of the three aluminium<br>
alloys and conditioned with the inventive method have<br>
state of the art mechanical and graining properties, in<br>
particular if the work pieces are litho-strips which are<br>
grained electro-chemically after conditioning. It was<br>
surprisingly observed that in particular the latter<br>
aluminium alloys conditioned with the inventive<br>
conditioning method show a higher sensitivity in<br>
subsequent surface roughening processes. As a result<br>
despite of the inventive single step conditioning method,<br>
which reduces the expenses for the conditioning equipment<br>
significantly, an increase in plate manufacturing speed<br>
for litho-strips and sheets is achievable.<br>
There are a lot of possibilities to develop further the<br>
invention. Hereunto it is refer to the dependent claims of<br>
claim 1 and claim 6 as well as to embodiments of the<br>
invention in combination with the drawings. The drawings<br>
show in<br>
Fig. 1	a microscopic view of the surface of a<br>
litho-strip degreased conventionally and<br><br>
Fig. 2	a microscopic view of the surface of a<br>
litho-strip degreased with the inventive<br>
method.<br>
To verify the inventive method four strips made of two<br>
different aluminium alloys were tested on the one hand<br>
with different degreasing parameters and on the other with<br>
different strip velocities during electro-chemical<br>
graining on different plate manufacturing lines. The<br>
different aluminium alloys have the following compositions<br>
of alloying constituents in weight percent:<br>
alloy A:<br><br>
impurities each less than 0,005 % in sum max.<br>
0,15 %, rest Al.<br>
alloy B:<br><br><br><br>
impurities each less than 0,005 % in sum max.<br>
0,15 %, rest Al<br>
Litho-strips made from the aluminium alloys mentioned<br>
above where tested with regard to their graining behaviour<br>
on industrial plate manufacturing lines.<br>
For the inventive examples the degreasing medium used<br>
contains at least 1,5 to 3 % by weight of a composite of<br>
5 to 40 % sodium tripolyphosphate, 3 to 10 % sodium<br>
gluconate, 30 to 70 % soda and 3 to 8 % of a composite of<br>
non-ionic and anionic surfactants, with an addition of<br>
sodium hydroxide in the amount of 1 % by weight. The<br>
comparative examples were degreased with the same<br>
conditions without the addition of sodium hydroxide to the<br>
degreasing medium. The results of the examples are shown<br>
in table 1<br><br><br>
with TDegr as the temperature during degreasing, tDegr the<br>
contact time of the degreasing medium with the strip<br>
surface and vGraining the velocity of the strips in the plate<br>
manufacturing lines, i.e. the velocity during electro-<br>
chemical graining. Strip 1 and 2 produced from one mother<br>
strip were tested on the same plate manufacturing line.<br>
The same applies to strip 3 and 4. The different values of<br>
VGraining for strip 1,2 and strip 3,4 are caused by different<br>
characteristics of the plate manufacturing lines.<br>
As can be derived from table 1 the litho-strips degreased<br>
with the inventive method generally show a good appearance<br>
after electro-chemical graining even if the graining<br>
velocity was increased. However, litho-strips degreased<br>
with the inventive method show even better graining<br>
results, because the surface of the litho-strip grained<br>
with the inventive method have a finer, more homogeneous<br>
and more shallow graining structure. This graining<br>
structure provides improved printing characteristics of<br>
the inventive litho-strips. Additionally, the inventive<br>
method provides said improved graining structure even at<br>
higher manufacturing speeds, as can be derived from the<br>
results of strip 1 and strip 2. Strip 1 degreased<br>
conventionally shows merely good appearance results after<br>
electro-chemical graining at a graining velocity of<br>
50 m/min. However, strip 2 degreased with the inventive<br>
method allows 55 m/min graining velocity.<br>
The different graining structures of the conventional and<br>
inventive degreasing method are shown in Fig. 1 and<br>
Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows, as already mentioned, a microscopic<br>
view of the surface of a litho-strip consisting of the<br>
aluminium alloy A degreased with the inventive method<br>
after electro-chemical graining. Fig. 1 shows the graining<br><br>
result of the same litho-strip degreased conventionally.<br>
The graining pattern achieved with the inventive method is<br>
finer and more shallow compared to the graining pattern<br>
achieved with a conventionally degreased litho-strip. As a<br>
result, the printing characteristics of the inventive<br>
litho-strips are improved significantly.<br>
The present embodiments of the invention has been achieved<br>
by the addition of 1 % per weight sodium hydroxide. It is<br>
expected that a higher concentration of sodium hydroxide<br>
combined with an decreased contact time of the strip with<br>
the degreasing medium will lead to similar results.<br><br>
