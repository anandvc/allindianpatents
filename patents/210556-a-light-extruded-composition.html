Solid agricultural compositions which may be applied to the surface water of paddy fields are known in the art (see, for example, U.S. 5,833,733 and JP 6-321704)•<br>
U.S. 5,833,733 describes agrochemical formulations for water surface application.  These formulations require: (1) a solid core material having an apparent specific density of less than 1 and a particle diameter within the range from about 300 µm to about 1,400 |xm; and<br>
(2) at least one oily substance.  However, this patent does not disclose any extruded formulations.  It is difficult to prepare extruded formulations containing large particle sizes of low-density carriers because large, low-density particles are not entirely stable to the conditions encountered during extrusion processes. In addition, the use of oily substances is not entirely satisfactory because oily substances may reduce the uniformity of the extruded composition and/or may decrease the flash point of the finished product.<br>
JP 6-321704 describes pesticidal formulations for water surface application. The formulations described in JP 6-321704 require hollow, glass bodies having an average particle diameter of 100 µm or less.  However, that application does not disclose any extruded formulations.  It is difficult to prepare extruded formulations containing hollow, glass bodies because hollow, glass bodies are not entirely stable to the conditions encountered during extrusion processes.<br><br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a light, extruded composition which avoids the use of low-density carriers having a particle range of about 300 µmto 1,400 pm; oily substances; and/or hollow, glass bodies.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a method for applying at least one agricultural compound to the water of paddy fields by applying to the water surface of the paddy fields a light, extruded composition.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide a process for the preparation of a light, extruded composition.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the description below and the appended claims.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a light, extruded composition which comprises at least one agricultural compound; a light, extrudable, ceramic carrier; and at least one surface active agent.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for applying at least one agricultural compound to the water of paddy fields which method comprises applying to the water surface of the paddy fields a light, extruded composition comprising at least one agricultural compound; a light, extrudable, ceramic carrier; and at least one surface active agent.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for the preparation of the light, extruded compositions of this invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OP THE INVENTION<br>
The light, extruded compositions of this invention comprise at least one agricultural compound; a light, extrudable, ceramic carrier; and at least one surface active agent.<br>
Preferred light, extruded compositions of the present invention are those comprising at least one agricultural compound; a light, extrudable, ceramic carrier; at least one surface active agent; a mineral carrier; and a binder.<br>
More preferred light, extruded compositions of the present invention are those comprising, on a weight to weight basis, about 0.5% to 75% of one or more agricultural compound(s) ; about 15% to 90% of a light, extrudable, ceramic carrier; about 2% to 20% of one or more surface active agent (s); about 1% to 30% of a mineral carrier; and about 0.1% to 10% of a binder.<br>
Most preferred light, extruded compositions of this invention are those comprising, on a weight to weight basis, about 1% to 60% of one or more agricultural compound(s) ; about 20% to 60% of a light, extrudable, ceramic carrier; about 2% to 15% of one or more surface active agent (s); about 1% to 15% of a mineral carrier; and about 0.5% to 5% of a binder.<br>
The light, extrudable, ceramic carrier is an especially important element of the present compositions because: (1) the light, extrudable, ceramic carrier lowers the density of the compositions, and (2) the light, extrudable, ceramic carrier does not lose its desirable low density property when subjected to the process steps used to prepare the compositions of this invention.  In contrast, hollow, glass bodies, which are used in conventional light, solid compositions, are not entirely stable to conditions encountered during the preparation of light, extruded compositions.  In particular, hollow, glass bodies are not entirely stable<br><br>
to the pressure and shearing forces encountered in processes which include an extrusion step.<br>
Light, extrudable, ceramic carriers suitable for use in this invention include ceramic carriers having a density less than the medium to which the light, extruded compositions are to be applied.  The light, extrudable, ceramic carrier typically has a density of less than 1 g/cm3, and preferably has a density of from about 0.5 g/cm3 to 0.8 g/cm3.  In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the light, extrudable, ceramic carrier is prepared by: (1) heating a naturally occuring mineral composition which comprises silicon(IV) oxide, aluminum oxide, calcium oxide, iron(III) oxide and titanium(IV) oxide; (2) selecting particles having a density of from about 0.5 g/cm3 to 0.8 g/cm3; and (3) sieving the particles to obtain a light, extrudable, ceramic carrier having the desired particle size range.  In another preferred embodiment of this invention, the light, extrudable, ceramic carrier is prepared from a composition which comprises, on a weight to weight basis, about 50% to 60% silicon (IV) oxide, about 25% to 45% aluminum oxide, about 0.1% to 6% calcium oxide, about 0.1% to 3% iron (III) oxide and about 0.1% to 2% titanium(IV) oxide.  To ensure that the light, extrudable, ceramic carrier retains its desirable low density property, the light, extrudable, ceramic carrier preferably has a pressure strength (&gt;40% survival) greater than about 150 kg/cm2, and more preferably greater than about 500 kg/cm2.  The light, extrudable, ceramic carrier of the present invention preferably has an average particle size of about 20 µmto 300 |xm, and more preferably, about 100 \xm  to 250 p,m.  Examples of light, extrudable, ceramic carriers suitable for use in the compositions of this invention include the E-SPHERES line of hollow, ceramic spheres commercially available from Taiheiyo Cement, Tokyo, Japan.<br><br>

The light, extruded compositions of this invention may be applied directly to water, soil or other media for application of the agricultural compound(s) .  In particular, the light, extruded compositions of the present invention are useful for applying agricultural compounds to the water of paddy fields.  Paddy-wide application of one or more agricultural compounds may be achieved by localized application(s) of the light,<br><br>
extruded compositions of this invention to the water<br>
surface of paddy fields.  Accordingly, the present<br>
invention provides a method for applying at least one<br>
agricultural compound to the water of paddy fields by<br>
applying to the water surface of the paddy fields a<br>
f light, extruded composition comprising at least one<br>
agricultural compound; a light, extrudable, ceramic<br>
carrier; and at least one surface active agent.<br>
The light, extruded compositions of this invention may be packaged in a contained, water-soluble delivery-system and applied to the water surface of paddy fields in water-soluble, packaged form. Water-soluble delivery systems include, but are not limited to, water-soluble poly (vinyl alcohol) bags (PVA bags), water-soluble paper bags, and water-soluble bottles, and the like.<br>
Alternatively, the light, extruded compositions of this invention may be packaged in uncontained systems and applied by hand, spoon, aerial or mechanical application from the uncontained system. Uncontained systems include, but are not limited to, bags, including foil lined bags, tubes including paper tubes, and hoppers, either hand held or attached to a mechanical applicator, such as a cultivator.<br>
In order to facilitate a further understanding of the invention, the following examples are presented primarily for the purpose of illustrating more specific details thereof.  The scope of the invention should not be deemed limited by the examples, but encompasses the entire subject matter defined in the claims.<br><br>
EXAMPLE  1<br>
Preparation of  light.  extruded compositions<br>
A mixture of cyclosulfamuron   (3.3 g,   average particle size less than 20 jam);   cafenstrole   (15.75  g, average particle size  less than 5 p.m);   dymron   (31.50  g) ; sodium bentonite   (4.8  g,   particle size range  5-10  jam, commercially available as bentonite-Na type  from Kunimine Co.,   Tokyo,   Japan);   NEWKALGEN WG-1 a sodium alkyl naphthalene sulfonate   (6.0 g,   commercially available  from Takemoto Oil and Fat  Co.,  Aichi,   Japan);   and CELLOGEN WS-C a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose   (1.5 g,   commercially available  from Dai-Ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co.,   Kyoto,   Japan) is blended to obtain a first mixture.     E-SPHERES SL-180 hollow ceramic spheres   (34.15 g,   average particle size 115 µm,   commercially available from Taiheiyo Cement, Tokyo,   Japan)   are added to the first mixture and blended to obtain a second mixture.    NEWKALGEN TG-285 a mixture of  a polycarboxylate and a sodium naphthalene sulfonate-formaldehyde condensate   (1.0 g,   commercially available from Takemoto Oil  and Fat Co.);  NEWKALGEN EP-70G a  sodium alkyl sulfonated alkylate   (2.0 g,   commercially available from Takemoto Oil  and Fat Co.);  and water are added to the  second mixture and blended to obtain an extrudable mixture.     The extrudable mixture is passed through a basket extruder to obtain extruded material.     The extruded material  is  dried and sieved to give the  light, extruded composition identified as composition 1  in Table I.<br>
Using essentially the same process,   the light, extruded compositions  identified as compositions 2-16  in Tables  I-V are obtained.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2 Herbicidal evaluations of light, extruded compositions<br>
A field is cultivated, muddled, sown with weed seeds (identified below) , and fertilized.  Five to six days later, rice seedlings (variety Chiyonishiki) at the 2.5 leaf stage are transplanted into the prepared field.  The field is then divided into 100 m2 (10 m x 10 m) test plots using plastic plates and each plot is flooded with water to a depth of 5 cm.  The flood levels are maintained at 5 cm throughout the evaluations.  20 g of composition number 1 from Example 1 and 20 g of composition number 1 from Example 1 packaged in water-soluble poly (vinyl alcohol) bags 20 g/bag are applied to the center of separate test plots to provide a rate equivalent to 60 g cyclosulfamuron, 300 g cafenstrole and 600 g dymron per hectare.  After 42 days, the test plots are divided into quarters for herbicidal evaluations.  These divisions are labeled as follows:  point A - southwest quarter, point B - northwest quarter, point C - northeast quarter and point D $£ southeast quarter.  Each quarter is evaluated for percent weed control compared to a check.  The results are summarized in Table VI below. As can be seen from the data in Table VI, the light, extruded composition of the present invention provides control of all weed species throughout the test plots from a single application of the invention composition in the middle of each plot.<br><br>
