The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention &amp; the manner in which it is performed:<br><br>

ORIGINAL<br>

The present Invention relates to "The Fuelless Magnetic Engine*.<br>
The engine which is conventionally available today is the IC (Interna! Combustion) engine. This type of engine works on fuels like diesel, petrol, gas etc. and combustion of this fuel. The IC engine comes in 2-strokes, 4-strokes and single and multi cylinder engines. This type of engine also requires a DC rechargeable battery.<br>
However, the above mentioned conventional Internal Combustion engine has many disadvantages, some of which are mentioned below.<br>
Fuel like diesei, petrol, gas etc. is necessary to run the IC engine, which increases the running cost. This makes the conventional internal Combustion engine expensive.<br>
As fuel is burnt in the cylinder of the IC engine, hence combustion takes place. Combustion leads to emission of gaseous waste in the form of smoke, which pollutes the air and causes damage to the health of human beings. It is thus harmfui to the environment.<br>
For more capacity and size of the mechanical load, more combustion of fuel will be required in the IC engine, which is again expensive and fuel-exhaustive.<br>
The present Invention "The Fuelless Magnetic Engine" has been developed to fulfill certain objectives, which are listed below.<br>
-2-<br><br>
The present invention should net require fuel like diesei, petrol, gas etc to operate so as to make it cost-effective.<br>
Also, In the present invention, there should be no combustion, and hence no smoke so as to make It environment friendly.<br>
The engine should not need any running cost after installation.<br>
The present engine should be able to withstand mechanical load of any capacity and size without any combustion.<br>
The present engine should work in 2 wheelers, 3 wheelers as well as 4 wheelers.<br>
The present invention 'The Fuelless Magnetic Engine" wiii now be explained in detail with the help of figure 1, figure 2 and figure 3 of accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows an auxiliary view of the present invention. Figure 2 shows the sectional eievation of the present Invention. Figure 3 shows the top view of the present invention,<br>
Figure 1 illustrates D.c. Motor (1), commutator (2), siip ring (3), transformer (4), laminated-core cylinder (5), Aiuminium body (6), piston (7), Crank shaft (8), legs (9) and Oil tank (10),<br>
Figure 2 illustrates laminated=core cylinder (5), Aluminium body (6), Crank shaft (8), guide (11), oii pump (12), connecting rod (13), auxiliary coil (14), gudgeon pin (15) and piston-cross head (16).<br>

Figure 3 illustrates Capacitor (17), High tension line to main and auxiliary coil (18), Dynamo 12 V D.C, (19), D.C. Motor (1), commutator (2) and slip ring (3),<br>
As the present invention is a magnetic engine, there Is no combustion taking place in the cylinder. Therefore, this is a fuelless engine. In this magnetic engine, the electrical energy of the battery is converted Into electro-magnetic energy by means of laminated core wire wounded cylinder and this eieetro-magnetie energy is further converted into mechanical energy by way of a to and fro movement of the piston which is in turn converted into rotational movement of the crankshaft. The mechanical load is connected to the threaded end of the crank shaft. Thus, this fuelless magnetic engine can be used wherever IC (internal combustion) engine of any shape, size and capacity is used.<br>
The construction of the present Invention Is as explained below. It contains main body fabricated from M.S. or graded casting as per the shape, size and capacity of the engine. On top of the body, 12V - 0.5 HP -750 RPM D.C. shunt motor assembly and inductive coil (transformer) are Incorporated. A commutator with two slip rings is fitted on the shaft of the motor. The commutator is split up into two parts - odd and even segments with mica insulation in between them giving breaking circuits. The two slip rings are further connected to transformer no. 1 and 2. The aluminium body is fitted w'rth the main body by nut and bolt. Inside the cylinder there is an auxiliary coil on the left and right hand sides. This is bolted with the aluminium body of the engine. There are two laminated core cylinders held apart with the top and bottom guides which are fitted to the aluminium body. The main cylinder is fitted to the aluminum body on the left hand side by means of screws. Enamel copper wire of suitable gauge Is wounded<br>
-4-<br><br>
on this core. A brass-bush piston can freely rotate Inside these guides. The tail of the piston moves inside both the cylinders leaving a small gap between auxiliary coii and the front of the cylinder. A gudgeon pin which can freely rotate in center of the piston is fitted with the fork type connecting rod forming big end. The smaller end is fitted with the crank of the crank shaft. On the crank shaft the two pulleys are fitted - one for oil pump, and one for 12V - 40 ampere Dynamo. At the threaded end of crank shaft mechanical load Is connected.<br>
The working of the present invention is as explained beiow. When the battery is switched on the supply from the battery will flow to the motor and the commutator. The segments of the commutator are divided in odd and even circuits and connected with the slip ring no. 1 and 2 respectively. The supply breaks alternatively due to mica insulation segment in between each copper segment. This breaking current flows in the primary coil of both the transformers alternately, creating magnetic flux. No sooner does the cut off take place; the magnetic lines of force will start collapsing creating high voltage in the secondary winding due to mutual inductance. This secondary winding is further connected to the wire of the laminated core. The laminated core wire will be magnetized powerfully. Suppose 1000 turns are wounded on the core. The current from the transformer comes through the current regulator. So in a controlled manner the current will flow say 10 ampere. So 1600 turns x 10 ampere = 16000 ampere-turns of magneto motive force will be exerted, i.e., 16000 watts = 16 KW (kilo watt) power is created. Therefore at this value of the MMF (Magneto motive force) of 16 kw at which It wli! atiract the piston towards the cylinder. The pull force of the magnet In kliogram will variable as per the intensity of current, the distance traveled by piston in meter, the speed of the crank shaft and the mechanical load connected. Therefore, by controlling the value of MMF, the magnetic pulling force<br>
-5-<br><br>
on the piston can be controlled. This will give a momentum on the crankshaft through fork type connecting rod, which will finally affect the mechanical ioad connected to the crankshaft, Further, the mechanical load is variable, Therefore while Increasing or decreasing the mechanical load, the value of MMF is aiso required to be changed accordingly to keep the moving force constant.<br>
Also, the speed of the crankshaft is directly proportional to the speed of the D.C. motor and half the number of the segments of commutator. The number of segments of the commutator once selected is permanent, only variable is the speed of D.C. motor which is controllable. To explain this, consider a 12 segment commutator; a 12 segment commutator will give 8 breaks. These 6 breaks of the circuit will give 6 times high voltage. This 6 times high tension will magnetize the core cylinder 6 times. So piston wilt be attracted 6 times in one revolution of the shaft of the motor, so in one revolution of the shaft the piston wiii move to and fro motion 8 times. Thus the crankshaft will run 6 times so there will be 1: 8 ratio of RPM (revolutions per minute). So by varying the speed of the 12 V D C motor say 200 RPM, the crankshaft will run 200 x 8 = 1200 RPM). Thus by controlling the speed of the motor by way of stepiess speed regulator, the speed of the crankshaft can be changed in the ratio 1 ; 6, so by selecting the commutator of say 12 segments, 24, 36,48 segments, etc. the speed can be controlled.<br>
The electro magneto motive force (MMF) so created by the cylinder wiii give magnetic force on the piston by way of attracting towards them. As the force is getting alternatively, the piston shall have to move alternatively on both the sides. The to and fro' (180 degree) movement of the piston so gained has to be transmitted further.<br>
-6-<br><br>
The gudgeon pin connected in the center of the piston shall have to move along with the movement of the piston. So when the piston is moving say in one direction, the 180 degrees movement of the piston shall have to be transmitted via gudgeon pin, fork and small end. The small end Is fitted on the crank of the crankshaft. Thus ultimately crank has to move, i.e. to rotate through half a revolution for one direction of the piston,<br>
Now when the piston Is attracted by another cylinder, the piston will move In another fro1 direction, So again this movement of the piston has to be transmitted through gudgeon pin, fork and small end to crank and again the crank will have to move through 180 °. Thus the crank of the crank shaft has to move through a total of 360 degrees, giving rise to rotational movement. In this manner the straight line (180 degrees) to and fro motion of the piston is converted rotational movement of the crank. In other words, the magnetic force on the piston is converted into mechanical force by way of rotating the crank of the crankshaft.<br>
The present invention "The Fueliess Magnetic Engine* has many advantages over the conventional IC (internal combustion) engine some of which are mentioned in the paragraphs that follow,<br>
Fuel like diesei, petroi, gas etc. is necessary to run the IC engine, whereas in the present invention no such fuel is necessary,<br>
Since the present invention works without fuel, it is very economical and cost-effective.<br>
-7-<br><br>
Aiso, since no fuel is used in the present invention, there is no combustion, and hence no smoke. This makes the present engine environment friendly.<br>
Running cost is high in IC engine, whereas no running cost Is to be expended after instaliatlon of the present invention, which means only one time investment of money and life time benefits.<br>
More combustion of fuel will be required for more capacity and size in the IC engine, whereas the present engine can withstand the mechanical ioad of any capacity and size without any combustion.<br>
The IC engine comes in 2-strokes, 4-strokes and single and mufti cylinder engines, whereas the present invention can be single acting, double acting and multi-cylinder engine.<br>
The present engine can work in 2 wheelers, 3 wheelers as well as 4 wheelers.<br>
Only horizontal and vertical engines are available in the IC engine, whereas the present magnetic engine can be horizontal, vertical as weii as 'V shaped.<br>
