Device and Method at a Card<br>
The invention relates to a device for setting the air and fiber stream distribution at a transition point from a card cylinder to a doffer by means of positioning at least one air guide element, wherein after installation the air guide element is arranged opposite at least one high-speed roller, namely the card cylinder and/or the doffer, a working gap forming between air guide element and roller, and to a method for positioning the air guide element according to the preamble of Claim 12.<br>
Prior Art<br>
The invention relates to the setting of the air and fiber stream at a card. The functions of the card include the breakdown of the fiber stream down to the individual fiber, the removal of impurities, dust and short fibers, the breakdown of neps, the improvement of the fiber blend, an orientation of the fibers and the sliver formation. For this, the fiber material is processed predominantly on the card cylinder, also known as the swift.<br>
Downline of the swift is the doffer whose function is to pick off the individual fibers from the swift and to compress these to form a fleece.<br>
The transition from the swift to the doffer is a very sensitive area. Once the material has been placed onto the doffer, the carding process proper is completed and the fleece is then only formed into a sliver.<br>
At the transition point from the swift to the doffer, the material that was placed onto the card cylinder with a parallel orientation is brought into a certain random position again that is required for doffing and the fiber ends are kinked. The transition point has to be adjusted in such a way that the quality of the material is not too greatly impaired by the above-mentioned processes.<br>
Furthermore, the transition point between swift and doffer determines to a not insignificant extent the carding quality, as this is dependent on the percentage of the<br><br>
fiber material that is transferred from the swift to the doffer and hence influences or determines the fiber transfer factor.<br>
The tendency for the fibers to adhere to the roller clothings or for fibers to come loose at the transition point is influenced partly by the air stream around the rollers.<br>
One possibility of checking the air stream around the card cylinder is shown in DE 101 10 824. The document discloses an outer surface of the cylinder that has air transmission openings. This supply and discharge of additional air can be set by means of pivotable air guide elements. However, this method does not allow the sensitive area between card cylinder and doffer or doffer roller to be directly influenced.<br>
From the prior art it is known that the distribution of the air and fiber streams at the transition between cylinder and doffer can be influenced by an air guide element, hereinafter also referred to as a guide element or tongue. Such elements are shown, for example, in EP 984 088 A2, in particular different types of installation. The distance between the guide elements and the roller can be selected, but is then fixed.<br>
The guide element influences the air stream that passes by with the roller. This in turn influences the tendency of the fiber material lying on the roller to adhere to or come away from the roller. EP 984 088 A2 shows that the form of the air guide element characterizes the course of the flow lines of the air stream, whereby a laminar flow pattern is preferred.<br>
The setting or adjustment of the guide elements is performed before material is supplied to the card. A fitter then checks using the material to be processed what volume of fibers is transferred to the doffer and what fleece quality is produced by the doffed fibers. In particular the fitter checks whether the doffed fleece is dense, has holes or thin or thick spots, whether irregularities occur and how hairy the fleece is.<br>
The fitter varies by manual setting the distance between the tongue and the roller and the angle of the tongue until he is satisfied with the quality of the fleece. Setting means<br><br>
that be used for this are described in EP-B-790 338. During the last step mentioned, a setting means should be inserted through the cylinder side panel in such a way that it is accessible from the outside of the side panel.<br>
It should also be taken into consideration, however, that the air guide element extends over the full working width of the card and must be set as equally over the width as possible. Two setting means therefore have to be provided at each cylinder side panel. It is impossible, however, for the fitter to work with both such setting means at the same time.<br>
Furthermore, since the rollers are operated with different fiber materials and different operating parameters, such as for example the roller speed, production, etc., it is desirable that the air stream can be selectively controlled or regulated.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
The object of the invention consists in providing a device with which the air stream and the fiber stream at the roller can be optimally adapted to the operating conditions by means of a positioning of an air guide element.<br>
Achievement of the Object<br>
In a first aspect the object is achieved by means of a device according to the preamble in which the air guide element has at least one reference point that can move along a line that has a distance from the surface of the roller and that runs essentially along the surface, as well as a method according to Claim 12.<br>
In a second aspect the object is achieved by means of an adjustment device that is suitable for adjusting the air guide element over the whole working width and which can be actuated from a predetermined setting position. This setting position is preferably easily accessible to the machine operator.<br><br>
in a third aspect the object is achieved by means of a guide for the air guide element that allows the adjustment of the element in the circumferential direction of a roller, in particular of the card cylinder.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
One key aspect of the invention lies in that the air guide element can be moved around the roller.<br>
Air guide elements according to the invention are employed at the transition points at which the fiber material is transferred from one roller to a next roller, namely from a card cylinder to a doffer. Seen from one side, one roller rotates in clockwise direction and the other in counterclockwise direction, whereby both rollers move in the same direction at the point where they come closest together. Air guide elements are provided in the areas in which the surfaces of the rollers move away from one another.<br>
It is possible, for example, for a guide element to be installed on both the card cylinder and the doffer, or only one air guide element is provided that has a form by means of which the air stream around the two rollers is influenced. It can also suffice for a guide element to be installed on only one of the rollers.<br>
An inventive positioning of the air guide element allows the air guide element to be either moved closer to the area where the two rollers come closest together, or for the air guide element to be moved further away from this area.<br>
It should be assured that a defined volume of fiber material is transferred from one roller to the other roller in the transition area. Depending on the prevailing combination of a large number of operating parameters, the material tends more or less to remain on the card cylinder or to come away from the card cylinder and change over to the doffer. Examples of such parameters are fiber type, fiber length, production, roller speed and climate, in particular temperature and/or humidity.<br><br>
The card cylinder running at very high speed forms an air cushion around the clothing applied to the swift that is drawn along with the roller. In the transition area downline of the first point between swift and doffer, this can result in a wake in the direction of the swift that holds more fiber material on the card cylinder than desired. The fleece on the doffer then exhibits thin spots or even undesirable holes.<br>
With relatively low sliver weights, (for example 2 to 8 ktex, in particular 4 to 6 ktex) and hence relatively thin fleeces, the risk of hole formation is particularly large.<br>
On the other hand, material deposits can form on the edge of the air guide element that are deposited either on the swift or on the doffer at irregular intervals. In the latter case, holes or undesirable thick spots also form on the doffed fleece. This takes place when large fluctuations in production occur. Examples of such fluctuations are:<br>
a)	When changing from a low production rate (for example approx. 40 kg/h) to a<br>
high production rate (for example &gt; 150 kg/h), or<br>
b)	During spinning on when accelerating from creep speed (for example at approx.<br>
5 kg/h) to a normal production rate (for example &gt; 80 kg/h).<br>
The transfer rate and the smooth running behavior (without fleece problems) also depends on the fiber length. If, for example, the distance between the air guide element and the closest point between swift and doffer is too large, a volume forms in the nip, i.e. in the area where swift and doffer start to move apart, in which short fibers can spring back and forth uncontrolled. If the distance is too small, on the other hand, longer fibers can collect on the edge of the tongue facing into the nip.<br>
The optimized conditions have to be determined for every case. In order that the machine does not have to be completely refitted at each change in operation, it is advantageous if the air guide element can be moved within a given range, preferably a movement closer to or further away from the closest point of the nip between swift and doffer.<br><br>
The size of the working gap that the air guide element forms with the surface of the roller on which the clothing is located in the case of a card cylinder lies in the millimeter or tenths of a millimeter range. For this reason, at least part areas of the air guide element were held in a fixed position in the prior-art solutions. After loosening the mounting, the air guide element could thus be adjusted manually, but was otherwise fixed in position on the card frame. Compared with the working width of the cylinder that lies in the meter range, only very small changes in the position of the element are naturally possible.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the whole air guide element can be moved. Exact guidance of the element is nevertheless possible, for example because a line is provided on which at least one reference point of the guide element is guided.<br>
The reference points can be an axis running through the whole guide element over the complete working width, points at the respective ends of the guide element lying symmetrically to one another, or points lying in areas that serve specially for the installation or mounting of the air guide element. The reference point can also be the center of gravity of the guide element.<br>
The guide line can be formed inter alia by corresponding guide rails or guide grooves in which the guide element is held. The guide element can also be guided in a cup-like element so that the guide line according to the invention is part of a guide surface.<br>
The line preferably runs essentially along the surface of the roller, in particular in the circumferential direction, allowing a movement of the guide element around the roller. If the line were to run perpendicularly to the roller surface, a movement along the line would correspond only to a variation in distance between the guide element and the roller surface.<br>
The guide element can be fastened either at only a few selected points on the guide line or at all the points on the guide line, so that an infinitely variable adjustment is possible.<br><br>
Depending on the position of the guide line relative to the roller surface, the distance and angle between the air guide element and the roller can be changed in the event of a movement of the air guide element along the line.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, at least the one reference point of the guide element is guided along a line running coaxially to the roller shaft and with which the guide element forms a working gap. In the event of a movement of the air guide element, the distance between roller surface and air guide element remains constant.<br>
The inventive positioning of the air guide element can be combined with the variation possibilities known from the prior art; for example, the distance between the air guide element and the roller may also be adjustable and/or the air guide element may have a reference point through which a shaft runs, about which the air guide element can be rotated.<br>
In addition, the outer surface of the rollers may have air transmission openings that admit and/or discharge additional air.<br>
The position of the air guide element can be fixed during the installation of the machine; in a preferred embodiment, however, the guide element is connected to a control device by means of which the movement of the air guide element can be performed under control. The control device can have a dedicated drive, for example a servo motor may be provided that initiates a guided movement of the guide element. A machine operator can define the position of the air guide element via the control device.<br>
It can also be provided for the control device to perform the positioning of the guide element automatically in relation to a settable parameter set which, for example, measures the sliver weight at the outlet from the card or on the sliver lay, characterizes the type of raw material and/or characterizes the speed of the roller.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the device is provided with at least one optical detection element.<br><br>
This element can be a camera by means of which the position of the tongue can be observed even with the machine closed. Under the control of one or more cameras and displaying the images on a monitor, for example, a fitter can carry out the initial setting of the air guide element that was previously carried out with the machine open. For this it is favorable to observe not only the guide element, but also the quality of the fiber material remaining on the card cylinder and/or deposited on the doffer and to display this on a monitor.<br>
The observation of the position of the guide element by means of a camera also has the advantage that the only millimeter-wide distances can be enlarged and hence more precisely controlled than is possible during setting using the naked eye and makes other aids for checking the distance superfluous.<br>
The viewing angle of a camera can be focused on the slot between card cylinder and doffer and/or on the gap between air guide element and a roller. It can also pass the roller tangentially to record the hairiness of the fiber material, or be focused on a roller from the front to detect holes or thick spots in the fiber material. A camera image of the area between swift and doffer can provide information as to whether material accumulations are forming on the tongue.<br>
The images recorded with the camera(s) can be transmitted to an evaluation system. This system makes it possible, for example, to monitor whether and to what extent a gap is being clogged with material, or whether the hairiness of the fleece is above a given reference thickness. If the deviation from a given reference value becomes too large, an alarm signal can be triggered.<br>
The optical elements can also operate as sensors for an additional light source and provide a measure for a distance, an angle or a fiber quality.<br>
The monitoring of the optical signals can serve as a working aid during the initial setting of the machine or indicate the need for monitoring of the set parameters or for new settings.<br><br>
The signals of a fleece monitoring device downline of the cylinder/doffer transfer point can also be used for the settings and/or monitoring of the air guide element, for example a camera that monitors the fleece in the fleece bridge.<br>
In a further expedient embodiment, the control device is connected to at least one pickup for measured values. The measured value can be a direct or indirect measure for the momentary position of the air guide element. It can indicate, for example, a distance or an angle, but can also quantify the pressure of the air draft between air guide element and roller. It is particularly advantageous if the air and/or fiber stream, or the distribution of the streams between the respective rollers, is measured directly. For this, an air and/or fiber stream measurement can be carried out in the respective flow channels, in other words in the gap between guide element and swift and/or in the gap between guide element and doffer roller. For comparison, the pressure in the area around the card cylinder can be measured, for example, before the air cushion reaches the transition point.<br>
The measured value can be displayed so that a machine operator can reposition the air guide element, depending on the displayed measured value. A simple device is preferably installed that permits a simple and precise manual setting, a scale can then guarantee an identical setting at all times and thus simplifies the operation of changing the cotton feed spool.<br>
The control device can, however, also carry out a comparison with a previously determined setpoint and output a signal in the event of a deviation in response to which a machine operator is to become active.<br>
The setpoints can be set by a fitter or be taken from a database that is compiled from optimized parameter sets for particular situations. For example, the relationships between the type of fiber material, the desired sliver weight, the throughput speed and the setting of the air guide element can be stored in the database.<br><br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the control device comprises a control loop by means of which the movement of the guide element can be performed automatically.<br>
For example, a setpoint can be entered by an operator with which the control device ensures on the basis of the signals from the control loop that the position of the air guide element results in the measured value always being within a tolerance range around the setpoint.<br>
The object of the invention is furthermore achieved by a method in which the air guide element is guided under control around the roller.<br>
An advantageous method serves for the initial setting of the air guide element in that the positioning of the air guide element is performed under visual control with the images being recorded by at least one camera installed on the device.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the method is characterized by the following process steps. A control device with a measured value detection system is provided on the device. The control device first compares a recorded measured value with a predeterminable setpoint and in the event of a significant deviation between measured value and setpoint performs a repositioning of the air guide element.<br>
The process steps can either be repeated at settable time intervals, or the monitoring of the measured values and, where necessary, the tracking of the guide element is performed constantly.<br>
Further advantageous configurations can be seen from the following drawings, the illustrative embodiments and the claims.<br><br>

Figure 1 shows a traveling flat card, for example the Rieter Card C60, with a working width of 1.5 meters, with a reserve trunk 1. The drawing shows the general process in a device on which the device according to the invention is to be preferably employed.<br>
Fiber tufts are transported through transport ducts (not shown in the figure) and through various blowroom process stages (also not shown) and finally to the reserve trunk 1 of the card. This passes on the fiber tufts as batting to the card. A feed roller 3 and a feed trough 2 feed the fiber tufts to lickers-in 5. The lickers-in 5 loosen the fiber tufts and remove part of the dirt particles. The last licker-in roller transfers the fibers to the carding cylinder 6, also known as card cylinder or swift. The card cylinder 6 operates together with card flats 7 to further align the fibers parallel. The card flats 7 are cleaned by a flats cleaning device (shown diagrammatically on the right of the traveling flat card in Figure 1, but without a specific reference number).<br>
The zone between the card cylinder 6 and the card flats 7 is called the "main carding zone", while the area on the opposite side in relation to the cylinder shaft of the main carding zone is called the "secondary carding zone".<br>
When the fibers have made in some cases several passes on the card cylinder 6, they are picked off the card cylinder 6 by the doffer roller 8, also known as "short doffer", fed to the delivery rollers 9 and finally placed as card sliver 10 into a can in the coiler (not shown in the figure). Additional cleaning or separation points are arranged on the card cylinder 6, for example carding elements 12 or separation elements with knives 11. Exhaust ducts are additionally arranged downstream of various cleaning points for the purpose of discharging the removed soiling. The exhaust ducts that are assigned locally to individual cleaning elements come together on one side of the card in a central exhaust duct. One example of such an exhaust system on a card is described in EP 750 059 (Rieter).<br><br>
The closed-loop (open-loop) controlled positioning of an air guide element 22 according to the invention is preferably provided in the area in which the fiber material either enters the area of the secondary carding zone or is taken over by the doffer 8.<br>
Figure 2 shows a diagrammatic representation of a first illustrative embodiment of a device 221 according to the invention that is arranged in an area between a card cylinder 6 and a doffer 8. The device comprises a first air guide element 222 that forms a working gap S with a roller, in this case the card cylinder 6.<br>
The air guide element 222 has at least one reference point, shown in the figure as a reference point 223, that can move on a line 224 that extends at a distance 225 around a part of the surface 226 of the card cylinder 6. This line 224 preferably lies in a circle coaxial with the card cylinder 6. In this case the distance between the reference point 223 and the surface 226 of the card cylinder 6 remains constant.<br>
In the case of a movement of the air guide element 222 according to the invention, the distance 227 between the air guide element 222 and the closest point 230, i.e. the point with the smallest distance between card cylinder 6 and doffer 8, varies.<br>
A positioning of a second air guide element 228 that forms a working gap with a roller, in this case the doffer roller 8, can be performed by perfect analogy.<br>
EP 0 984 088 A2 shows various possibilities for the mounting of an air guide element. Figures 1 and 2 of EP 0 984 088 A2, for example, show an air guide element designed as a baffle plate or tongue that is attached with a foot section to a support, that in turn is fixed at one foot end to a machine frame section, in order to permit a movement of the baffle plate according to the invention, the support can have a supporting surface opposite its foot section that lies opposite the surface of the roller and on which the air guide element can slide back and forth. The supporting surface of the support defines in this case the guide line of the baffle plate.<br><br>
Another form of mounting is shown in Figures 3 to 11 of EP 0 984 088 A2. Here the air guide element is arranged on the so-called cover segments that form part of the cylinder side panels arranged on both sides of the card. In a preferred embodiment (according to Figures 7 to 10), the air guide element, in this case called tongue, is mounted on an arm on each side.<br>
For a positioning of the air guide element according to the invention, the guide line can either be determined by the form of the arms on which the tongue can move back and forth, or the arm with a fixed tongue performs the movement relative to the cylinder side panel.<br>
Figure 3 shows a diagrammatic representation of a second illustrative embodiment of a device 321 according to the invention. In this example there is only one air guide element 322 that with a first surface 329 forms a working gap S with the card cylinder 6 and with a second surface 330 a further working gap S' with the doffer 8.<br>
The air guide element 322 can move along a line 324 around the card cylinder 6, and is furthermore mounted pivotably about a shaft 331. The rotation about the shaft 331 lying inside the air guide element 322 allows the widths of the working gaps S, S' to be varied.<br>
Figure 4 shows a further illustrative embodiment where the device 421 according to the invention again has only one air guide element 422 that can be moved along two lines relative to the card cylinder 6 and the doffer 8. In this figure the two lines are each indicated with a double-pointed arrow on the element 422 proper.<br>
Furthermore Figure 4 shows in outlines the positions at which sensors can be provided. A first sensor 432 monitors the fiber stream on the card cylinder 6 before the fibers reach the doffer 8.<br>
The sensor 432 can be an optical sensor, for example a camera, or a measuring device, for example to measure the pressure or the air or fiber stream.<br><br>
Further sensors 433, 434 can be provided to monitor the flow rate through the working gaps S and S\ This monitoring can also be performed optically, in other words with a camera or an optical sensor, or by means of the acquisition of a measured value for pressure or stream.<br>
A further sensor 435 can be used to monitor whether and to what extent fiber material deposits occur on the edge 436 of the air guide element 422. Short fibers can stick there and then flap back and forth in the gap 437 between swift 6 and doffer 8, or long fibers can collect whose one end first adheres to the swift 6.<br>
Further orientations of sensors are conceivable. For example, a camera can be oriented tangentially to a roller surface in order to observe the hairiness of the fibers or be aimed directly at a working gap S or S\ or a camera can be aimed perpendicularly at a roller surface and provide an image of the fiber material on the respective roller. Suitable monitoring systems for the inside of a card with a machine housing are described, for example, in DE-A-10259475. in order to ensure an adequate image quality, it can be necessary to install additional sources of light.<br>
Figure 5 shows a copy of Figure 2 with minor modifications. According to a first modification, the air guide element 222A on the cylinder 6 is provided with a "head" at the free end. This head is essentially the same as the head provided on the air guide element according to Figure 1 of EP-A-432 430 (or EP-B-790 338). The design of this head section helps to cleanly separate the fiber/air streams that on the one hand continue to flow with the cylinder 6, and on the other hand follow the doffer 8. The position of the second air guide element 228 that is assigned to the doffer 8 remains unchanged in Figure 5 by comparison with Figure 2, because this is merely a diagrammatic representation. In practice, however, the mutual positioning of the two elements would have to be optimized. This is considerably simplified by a setting device according to the present invention.<br>
According to a second modification shown by the dashed lines in Figure 5, the reference point 223 is moved radially "inwards" in relation to the cylinder 6. This results<br><br>
in a new movement line 224A. This is made possible by the element 222A being provided with a boom 227 that extends radially inwards from the prolonged body of the element at the end lying outside the working width of the machine at a point remote from the head. The reference point 223A is now located in this boom 227. The radial distance of the reference point from the pivot axis of the cylinder can thus be selected smaller or larger than the cylinder radius, or equal to the radius. The movement line 224A also does not have to be circular or selected to be concentric with the pivot axis of the cylinder. An appropriate selection of the geometry of this line allows a radial adjustment of the element 222A to be performed at the same time as an adjustment of this element in the circumferential direction of the cylinder.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 each show diagrammatically and on a larger scale compared with the other figures one variant in each case of an adjustment device that is suitable for use in conjunction with this invention. The solution according to Figure 6 comprises a controllable actuator. In Figure 6 the cylinder is indicated with the reference number 6, the doffer with the reference number 8 and the closest point between these rollers with the reference number 230. The air guide element is indicated with the reference number 322A (cf. Fig. 3) and essentially comprises a profile extending over the whole working width of the card (1 to 1.5 meters). This profile is connected by beams 350 (only one beam shown) by means of a pivot axis 331A (cf. Figure 3) to a cross-member 352. The cross-member 352 has openings for guide rods 354 (only one rod 354 shown) that are fastened to the machine frame 355 by support 356. One support also bears an electric motor 357 that can turn a threaded spindle 358, with the threaded spindle 358 interacting with a nut or threaded bore 359 located in the cross-member 352.<br>
When the spindle 358 is turned by the motor 357, the cross-member 352 moves along the rods 354, varying the distance between the "nose" 360 of the profile 322A and the closest point 230. The profile 322A can, however, also be rotated about the pivot axis 331A in order to thereby set the distance between the cylinder 6 and the surface of the profile 322A facing the cylinder. For this purpose the cross-member has, for example, a round disc 362 that is attached to a shaft 364. The shaft 364 is the shaft of an electric motor 366 that is supported by the cross-member 352. The profile 322A lies on the<br><br>
curved outer surface of the disc that is attached eccentrically to the pivot shaft of the motor shaft. Rotation of the shaft 364 thus changes the distance between the cross-member 352 and the outer surface of the profile 322A that is in contact with the disc 362. In order to be able to perform controlled movements, the actuator can comprise, for example, stepping motors or motors with encoder or resolver<br>
The embodiment according to Figure 6 is naturally complex and costly and is therefore not suitable for low-cost designs. The solution according to Figure 7 is far simpler. This is fundamentally a further development of the embodiment according to Figure 10 in EP-B-984 088. The air guide element 222B (cf. Figure 2) - called "tongue" in EP-B-790 338 - has the form of a continuous cast profile. The profile is attached by suitable means - described in further detail below - to the underside of an arm 112. The outer surface of the clothing (not shown) of the cylinder is indicated by a dashed line and referred to with the reference number 1 A. A gap E remains free between the outer surface 1A and its opposed surface of the element 222B.<br>
The arm 112 forms part of a so-called cover segment 125 that is positioned in the machine frame by means of a bolt 126. As explained in detail in EP-B-984 088, the arm 112 attempts to move outwards in the direction of the outer surface 1A due to a preload and is thereby limited by a stop formed by the end of an adjustment screw 132 and thereby effectively determines the width of the gap E. This screw 132 is accessible to the machine operator from the outside of the machine side panel 121. In thus far the design according to Figure 7 essentially corresponds to the solution according to EP-B-984 088, Fig. 10, whereby in the latter embodiment the air guide element was attached to the supporting arm. According to the present invention, however, the element 112 should be adjustable in the direction of or away from the closest point (not shown in Fig. 7, cf. point 230, Fig. 2) between swift and doffer.<br>
In order to permit the last mentioned adjustment, the profile 222B can be provided with a supporting end head at each end that interacts with the respective cover segment outside the working width of the rollers - the one end head is indicated in Figure 7 by the dashed lines 223. Each end head 223 also has a rod 130 that is guided by a<br><br>
bushing 131 fixed to the arm 112. At its free end, the rod 130 bears a disc 123 and a spring 120 acts in such a way between the bushing 131 and the disc 123 that the air guide element is pushed back into a position remote from the closest point 230 (Fig. 2). This movement away from the closest point is, however, limited by an adjustable stop formed in this embodiment by a cam 124. The cam 124 is fixed to a shaft 125 that is supported in such a way as to permit rotation in the cylinder side panels (not shown in Figure 7). The cam 124 has a cylindrical outer surface (without reference number) that is arranged eccentrically relative to the pivot shaft 125. By rotating the shaft 125 it is thus possible to increasingly compress the springs 120 by moving the discs 123 and to move the air guide element 222B in the direction of the above-mentioned closest point 230, or to relieve the springs 120 and thus to permit a movement of the element 222B away from the closest point.<br>
The diagrammatic representations in Figures 7A, B and C each show a possible embodiment of the principle according to Figure 7. In these detail sketches the cover segment is indicated in each case with the reference number 125, the arm with the reference number 112 and the air guide element with the reference number 222B. The solution is shown in each case only on one side of the machine, but the same solution principle can be employed as a mirror image on the other side of the machine.<br>
In the solution according to Figure 7A, the above-mentioned supporting end head is designed as a slide 150 that runs in a groove-shaped guide 152 in the side surface of the arm 112. The guide runs concentrically to the outer surface 1A (not shown in Figure 7A, cf. Fig. 7), so that the element 222B maintains its end position in relation to the outer surface 1A, while it is adjusted relative to the closest point 230 (Fig. 2). The bushing 131A is designed as a slide bushing, whereby two pivots 154, 156 have to be additionally provided to permit the necessary angular adjustment of the rod 130 relative to the guide element 222B.<br>
In Figure 7B the solution of the guide problem has remained the same and the same reference numbers 150, 152 are used to indicate the slide and the guide groove respectively. In this variant, however, the bushing 131B does not have a guide function<br><br>
for the rod 130; it serves here merely as a mounting for the pressure spring 120 (Fig. 7). The opening in the bushing 131B must allow sufficient clearance relative to the rod 130 to permit the change in angular position of the rod 130 (indicated by the dashed line) during an adjustment movement of the element 222B.<br>
In the solution according to Figure 7C, the rod 130 is guided by two slide bushings 131C, thus permitting only a linear movement of the rod and of the element 222B, as indicated by the dashed line in Figure 7C. The adjustment of the element 222B in circumferential direction is therefore accompanied in this case by an adjustment in the radial direction. In order to simplify the sketch, a radial adjustment in the sense of an increase in the radial distance during a movement of the element in the direction of the closest point 230 (Fig. 2) has been assumed, whereby a reduction in the radial distance during adjustment in the direction of the closest point can be provided for by the design of the geometry of the slide bushings 131C.<br>
The shaft 125 can be provided for both cams 124 together and can extend through the cylinder side panel on one side or on both sides of the card, so that the shaft 125 is accessible to the operator. Outside the side panel the shaft can have a hand crank or an attachment for a hand crank so that the adjustment of the air guide element 222B along the arm 112 can be performed manually from a predetermined position in the vicinity of the card.<br>
This permits an adjustment of the air guide element 222B in circumferential direction of the card cylinder, whereby the setting of the air guide element in the radial direction still has to be performed first on one side of the card and then on the other side - or on both sides at the same time. It will obvious to a person skilled in the art that the adjustment in radial direction can also be performed by means of a continuous shaft, with the shaft having to be provided underneath the cylinder 6 and connected to the moving stops on the arms 112 by means of suitable transmission elements.<br>
The shaft 125 could, of course, (also) be connected to a controllable electric motor, so that the adjustment can be performed in a controlled manner without direct manual<br><br>
intervention. A suitable actuator for this purpose is shown diagrammatically, for example, in EP-A-627 508 (Fig. 12 and 13) and a further development with piezoelectric translators has been described in conjunction with EP-B-787 841, Fig. 2. A common adjustment shaft for the radial setting could also be driven by an electric motor, or a controllable motor could be provided for each of the two stops on the arms 112.<br>
The embodiments according to Figures 6 and 7 are merely intended as examples of two actuator possibilities and should not be seen as limitations in any way. The one possibility, Fig. 6, consists in performing all the movements of the air guide element by means of a controllable actuator that can be controlled, for example, from a control panel of the machine - cf. following Figure 9. The second possibility, Fig. 7, consists in performing predetermined movements by means of a relatively simple setting mechanism that can be preferably actuated from one setting position, i.e. it is not necessary to provide the actuation element on both sides of the machine. A large number of alternative embodiments are known that meet the requirements of these two possibilities. DE-A-3 702 588 shows, for example, both a controllable actuator for linear movements (Fig. 2, 5 and 6 of the DE publication) of working elements of a card, and also a controllable actuator for controllable swiveling movements (Fig. 3 and 4) of such elements. Controllable swiveling movements are also shown and described in DE-A-3 825 419 and DE-A-10 231 829. The same actuators can be adapted in principle for use in conjunction with the adjustment of an air guide element.<br>
If the air guide element is to continue to be set by the operating personnel, as in Figure 7, it is not absolutely necessary to define reference points for a controller. Setting values, for example predetermined distances between adjacent working elements, can be defined and monitored by the operating personnel. The effect of a new setting can also be observed directly on the fleece product and further modified as necessary if the result of the first adjustment is not satisfactory. At least for automatic operation, however, it is necessary to define reference points so that adjustments initiated by the controller start from a predeterminable starting position. Possibilities for reference points are shown in Figure 8 whereby the diagrammatic figure is intended merely as an example of the principle and in no way as a concrete embodiment.<br><br>
The cylinder is also indicated in Figure 8 with the reference number 6, with the curved line 6A indicating the outer surface of the clothing. The direction of movement of the clothing is indicated by the arrow. The air guide element is indicated with 822 and is shown in greatly simplified form to simplify the description. The element 822 has an "inner surface" 823 that should have a given distance from the outer surface 6A of the cylinder clothing at least at one point. Furthermore, the element 822 has a nose 824A that should maintain a given distance from the closest point 230 (cf. Fig. 2) between the cylinder 6 and the doffer (not shown in Figure 8). In Fig. 8 it has been assumed that the inner surface 823 should maintain a given distance from the clothing at two points, namely at point 824B (distance b) and at point 824C (distance c). Distance b measures, for example, 1 to 5 mm and distance c measures 0.5 to 3 mm.<br>
Three stops 830, 831 and 832 are provided for determining reference values for the above-mentioned distances. When the element 822 is in contact with all the stops, the above-mentioned distances each have a predetermined value. The actuator can start from these preset values when performing controlled movements. Starting from its position in contact with the stop 830, the element 822 can be moved within a predetermined adjustment range t in the circumferential direction of the cylinder 6. This adjustment range covers, for example, a distance t of 5 to 30 mm. The invention is not limited to the system shown for the formation of reference points. Measuring means could be provided, for example, to measure the existing distance between a given point on the air guide element and a corresponding reference point on the machine frame, for example on the cover segment (cover elbow). When using an absolute encoder in combination with the actuator, referencing outside the actuator proper is not necessary if the actuator is installed at a predetermined position in the machine.<br>
Figure 9 shows a detail from Figure 1 to illustrate diagramrnatically the connection between the machine and a controller. The description of the elements that have already been explained in conjunction with Figure 1 is not repeated here. A control console 900 with a computer 902, a monitor 904 and a keyboard 906 are provided, however, for the machine illustrated. The computer 902 receives signals from sensor elements in the machine and supplies signals to the actuators on the machine. Only the<br><br>
actuator 908 for the air guide element 922 is of importance in conjunction with the present invention.<br>
Three sensor elements 910, 911 and 912 are indicated diagrammatically, whereby<br>
these sensor elements serve only as examples of the large number of possibilities:<br>
Element 910 is a sensor for measuring an important distance between the air guide<br>
element and a reference point, such as already described for example in conjunction<br>
with Figure 8. Measuring systems for measuring relatively small distances of this type<br>
are known e.g. from DE-A-4 235 610 and EP-A-1 158 078.<br>
Element 911 is a camera, for example according to DE-A-10 259 475, for monitoring the<br>
conditions in the gap upstream of the air guide element. The image produced by the<br>
camera 911 can be displayed on the monitor 904.<br>
Element 912 is a sensor for monitoring the quality of the fleece product.<br>
Such elements are known, for example, from DE-A-4 115 968, DE-A-3 928 279, EP-A-<br>
738 792 and EP-A-1 068 380.<br>
The operator can now enter a setpoint for a given distance between the air guide element and a given reference point via the keyboard. This setpoint or setting value serves at least as a basic setting. The computer then supplies signals to the actuator 908 so that the air guide element is moved to the defined basic position, whereby signals from the measuring sensor 910 are evaluated by the computer. It is now possible, however, that the sensor 912 detects faults in the fleece and signals this to the computer 902. The computer evaluates the signals from the sensor 912 and in the event of a fault that can be corrected by changes to the setting of the air guide element, it then supplies signals to the actuator 908 to initiate the necessary adjustments, at the same time taking into consideration the signals from the sensor 910. It is also possible that the operator detects problems in the gap monitored by the camera 911 from the image displayed on the monitor 904. Since the new setting of the air guide element can also be carried out during operation of the card, it is possible to enter a new setpoint for the positioning of the air guide element via the keyboard and to observe the effect of the change both in the monitored gap and at the product.<br><br>
The actuator solutions according to Figures 6 and 7 are suitable for adjusting the air guide element over the whole working width. They can also be controlled and/or operated from a predetermined "setting position". In the event of the solution according to Figure 6, the setting position is, for example, alongside the control console where the operator can generate control commands for the actuators by means of the operating elements, such as keyboard and monitor. This setting position is naturally easily accessible for the machine operator. But also in the case of the solution according to Figure 7, the operator is now able to adjust the air guide element even during operation of the card from a setting position close to at least one end of the shaft 125 (Fig. 7).<br>
It will be obvious to a person skilled in the art that a suitable locking device can be provided to reliably hold the air guide element in a selected position for operation, but so that it can also be released. In the case of a manually operated adjustment device (e.g. according to Figure 7), the locking device can also be operated manually, for example in the form of a detent that prevents the cam from turning. In the case of a controllable actuator (e.g. according to Figure 6), the locking device can also be controllable.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
