Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method<br>
for processing a multi-channel audio signal and, in par-<br>
ticular, to an apparatus and a method for processing a<br>
multi-channel audio signal in a stereo-compatible manner.<br>
Background of the Invention and Prior Art<br>
In recent times, the multi-channel audio reproduction tech-<br>
nique is becoming more and more important. This may be due<br>
to the fact that audio compression/encoding techniques such<br>
as the well-known mp3 technique have made it possible to<br>
distribute audio records via the Internet or other trans-<br>
mission channels having a limited bandwidth. The mp3 coding<br>
technique has become so famous because of the fact that it<br>
allows distribution of all the records in a stereo format,<br>
i.e., a digital representation of the audio record includ-<br>
ing a first or left stereo channel and a second or right<br>
stereo channel.<br>
Nevertheless, there are basic shortcomings of conventional<br>
two-channel sound systems. Therefore, the surround tech-<br>
nique has been developed. A recommended multi-channel-<br>
surround representation includes, in addition to the two<br>
stereo channels L and R, an additional center channel C and<br>
two surround channels Ls, Rs. This reference sound format<br>
is also referred to as three/two-stereo, which means three<br><br>
front channels and two surround channels. Generally, five<br>
transmission channels are required. In a playback environ-<br>
ment, at least five speakers at the respective five differ-<br>
ent places are needed to get an optimum sweet spot in a<br>
certain distance from the five well-placed loudspeakers.<br>
Several techniques are known in the art for reducing the<br>
amount of data required for transmission of a multi-channel<br>
audio signal. Such techniques are called joint stereo tech-<br>
niques. To this end, reference is made to Fig. 10, which<br>
shows a joint stereo device 60. This device can be a device<br>
implementing e.g. intensity stereo (IS) or binaural cue<br>
coding (BCC). Such a device generally receives - as an in-<br>
put - at least two channels (CH1, CH2, ... CHn) , and outputs<br>
a single carrier channel and parametric data. The paramet-<br>
ric data are defined such that, in a decoder, an approxima-<br>
tion of an original channel (CH1, CH2, ... CHn) can be calcu-<br>
lated.<br>
Normally, the carrier channel will include subband samples,<br>
spectral coefficients, time domain samples etc, which pro-<br>
vide a comparatively fine representation of the underlying<br>
signal, while the parametric data do not include such sam-<br>
ples of spectral coefficients but include control parame-<br>
ters for controlling a certain reconstruction algorithm<br>
such as weighting by multiplication, time shifting, fre-<br>
quency shifting, ... The parametric data, therefore, include<br>
only a comparatively coarse representation of the signal or<br>
the associated channel. Stated in numbers, the amount of<br>
data required by a carrier channel will be in the range of<br>
60 - 70 kbit/s, while the amount of data required by para-<br>
metric side information for one channel will be in the<br>
range of 1,5 - 2,5 kbit/s. An example for parametric data<br><br>
are the well-known scale factors, intensity stereo informa-<br>
tion or binaural cue parameters as will be described below.<br>
Intensity stereo coding is described in AES preprint 3799,<br>
"Intensity Stereo Coding", J. Herre, K. H. Brandenburg, D.<br>
Lederer, February 1994, Amsterdam. Generally, the concept<br>
of intensity stereo is based on a main axis transform to be<br>
applied to the data of both stereophonic audio channels. If<br>
most of the data points are concentrated around the first<br>
principle axis, a coding gain can be achieved by rotating<br>
both signals by a certain angle prior to coding. This is,<br>
however, not always true for real stereophonic production<br>
techniques. Therefore, this technique is modified by ex-<br>
cluding the second orthogonal component from transmission<br>
in the bit stream. Thus, the reconstructed signals for the<br>
left and right channels consist of differently weighted or<br>
scaled versions of the same transmitted signal. Neverthe-<br>
less, the reconstructed signals differ in their amplitude<br>
but are identical regarding their phase information. The<br>
energy-time envelopes of both original audio channels, how-<br>
ever, are preserved by means of the selective scaling op-<br>
eration, which typically operates in a frequency selective<br>
manner. This conforms to the human perception of sound at<br>
high frequencies, where the dominant spatial cues are de-<br>
termined by the energy envelopes.<br>
Additionally, in practically implementations, the transmit-<br>
ted signal, i.e. the carrier channel is generated from the<br>
sum signal of the left channel and the right channel in-<br>
stead of rotating both components. Furthermore, this proc-<br>
essing, i.e., generating intensity stereo parameters for<br>
performing the scaling operation, is performed frequency<br>
selective, i.e., independently for each scale factor band,<br><br>
i.e., encoder frequency partition. Preferably, both chan-<br>
nels are combined to form a combined or "carrier" channel,<br>
and, in addition to the combined channel, the intensity<br>
stereo information is determined which depend on the energy<br>
of the first channel, the energy of the second channel or<br>
the energy of the combined or channel.<br>
The BCC technique is described in AES convention paper<br>
5574, "Binaural cue coding applied to stereo and multi-<br>
channel audio compression", C. Faller, F. Baumgarte, May<br>
2002, Munich. In BCC encoding, a number of audio input<br>
channels are converted to a spectral representation using a<br>
DFT based transform with overlapping windows. The resulting<br>
uniform spectrum is divided into non-overlapping partitions<br>
each having an index. Each partition has a bandwidth pro-<br>
portional to the equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB).<br>
The inter-channel level differences (ICLD) and the inter-<br>
channel time differences (ICTD) are estimated for each par-<br>
tition for each frame k. The ICLD and ICTD are quantized<br>
and coded resulting in a BCC bit stream. The inter-channel<br>
level differences and inter-channel time differences are<br>
given for each channel relative to a reference channel.<br>
Then, the parameters are calculated in accordance with pre-<br>
scribed formulae, which depend on the certain partitions of<br>
the signal to be processed.<br>
At a decoder-side, the decoder receives a mono signal and<br>
the BCC bit stream. The mono signal is transformed into the<br>
frequency domain and input into a spatial synthesis block,<br>
which also receives decoded ICLD and ICTD values. In the<br>
spatial synthesis block, the BCC parameters (ICLD and ICTD)<br>
values are used to perform a weighting operation of the<br>
mono signal in order to synthesize the multi-channel sig-<br><br>
nals, which, after a frequency/time conversion, represent a<br>
reconstruction of the original multi-channel audio signal.<br>
In case of BCC, the joint stereo module 60 is operative to<br>
output the channel side information such that the paramet-<br>
ric channel data are quantized and encoded ICLD or ICTD pa-<br>
rameters, wherein one of the original channels is used as<br>
the reference channel for coding the channel side informa-<br>
tion.<br>
Normally, the carrier channel is formed of the sum of the<br>
participating original channels.<br>
Naturally, the above techniques only provide a mono repre-<br>
sentation for a decoder, which can only process the carrier<br>
channel, but is not able to process the parametric data for<br>
generating one or more approximations of more than one in-<br>
put channel.<br>
The audio coding technique known as binaural cue coding<br>
(BCC) is also well described in the United States patent<br>
application publications US 2003, 0219130 A1, 2003/0026441<br>
A1 and 2003/0035553 Al. Additional reference is also made<br>
to "Binaural Cue Coding. Part II: Schemes and Applica-<br>
tions", C. Faller and F. Baumgarte, IEEE Trans. On Audio<br>
and Speech Proc, Vol. 11, No. 6, Nov. 2993. The cited<br>
United States patent application publications and the two<br>
cited technical publications on the BCC technique authored<br>
by Faller and Baumgarte are incorporated herein by refer-<br>
ence in their entireties.<br>
In the following, a typical generic BCC scheme for multi-<br>
channel audio coding is elaborated in more detail with ref-<br><br>
erence to Figures 11 to 13. Figure 11 shows such a generic<br>
binaural cue coding scheme for coding/transmission of<br>
multi-channel audio signals. The multi-channel audio input<br>
signal at an input 110 of a BCC encoder 112 is downmixed in<br>
a downmix block 114. In the present example, the original<br>
multi-channel signal at the input 110 is a 5-channel sur-<br>
round signal having a front left channel, a front right<br>
channel, a left surround channel, a right surround channel<br>
and a center channel. In a preferred embodiment of the pre-<br>
sent invention, the downmix block 114 produces a sum signal<br>
by a simple addition of these five channels into a mono<br>
signal. Other downmixing schemes are known in the art such<br>
that, using a multi-channel input signal, a downmix signal<br>
having a single channel can be obtained. This single chan-<br>
nel is output at a sum signal line 115. A side information<br>
obtained by a BCC analysis block 116 is output at a side<br>
information line 117. In the BCC analysis block, inter-<br>
channel level differences (ICLD), and inter-channel time<br>
differences (ICTD) are calculated as has been outlined<br>
above. Recently, the BCC analysis block 116 has been en-<br>
hanced to also calculate inter-channel correlation values<br>
(ICC values) . The sum signal and the side information is<br>
transmitted, preferably in a quantized and encoded form, to<br>
a BCC decoder 120. The BCC decoder decomposes the transmit-<br>
ted sum signal into a number of subbands and applies scal-<br>
ing, delays and other processing to generate the subbands<br>
of the output multi-channel audio signals. This processing<br>
is performed such that ICLD, ICTD and ICC parameters (cues)<br>
of a reconstructed multi-channel signal at an output 121<br>
are similar to the respective cues for the original multi-<br>
channel signal at the input 110 into the BCC encoder 112.<br>
To this end, the BCC decoder 120 includes a BCC synthesis<br>
block 122 and a side information processing block 123.<br><br>
In the following, the internal construction of the BCC syn-<br>
thesis block 122 is explained with reference to Fig. 12.<br>
The sum signal on line 115 is input into a time/frequency<br>
conversion unit or filter bank FB 125. At the output of<br>
block 125, there exists a number N of sub band signals or,<br>
in an extreme case, a block of a spectral coefficients,<br>
when the audio filter bank 125 performs a 1:1 transform,<br>
i.e., a transform which produces N spectral coefficients<br>
from N time domain samples.<br>
The BCC synthesis block 122 further comprises a delay stage<br>
126, a level modification stage 127, a correlation process-<br>
ing stage 128 and an inverse filter bank stage IFB 129. At<br>
the output of stage 129, the reconstructed multi-channel<br>
audio signal having for example five channels in case of a<br>
5-channel surround system, can be output to a set of loud-<br>
speakers 124 as illustrated in Fig. 11.<br>
As shown in Fig. 12, the input signal s (n) is converted<br>
into the frequency domain or filter bank domain by means of<br>
element 125. The signal output by element 125 is multiplied<br>
such that several versions of the same signal are obtained<br>
as illustrated by multiplication node 130. The number of<br>
versions of the original signal is equal to the number of<br>
output channels in the output signal, to be reconstructed<br>
When, in general, each version of the original signal at<br>
node 130 is subjected to a certain delay d1, d2, —, di, ...,<br>
dN. The delay parameters are computed by the side informa-<br>
tion processing block 123 in Fig. 11 and are derived from<br>
the inter-channel time differences as determined by the BCC<br>
analysis block 116.<br><br>
The same is true for the multiplication parameters al, a2,<br>
..., ai, ..., aN, which are also calculated by the side infor-<br>
mation processing block 123 based on the inter-channel<br>
level differences as calculated by the BCC analysis block<br>
116.<br>
The ICC parameters calculated by the BCC analysis block 116<br>
are used for controlling the functionality of block 128<br>
such that certain correlations between the delayed and<br>
level-manipulated signals are obtained at the outputs of<br>
block 128. It is to be noted here that the ordering of the<br>
stages 126, 127, 128 may be different from the case shown<br>
in Fig. 12.<br>
It is to be noted here that, in a frame-wise processing of<br>
an audio signal, the BCC analysis is performed frame-wise,<br>
i.e. time-varying, and also frequency-wise. This means<br>
that, for each spectral band, the BCC parameters are ob-<br>
tained. This means that, in case the audio filter bank 125<br>
decomposes the input signal into for example 32 band pass<br>
signals, the BCC analysis block obtains a set of BCC pa-<br>
rameters for each of the 32 bands. Naturally the BCC syn-<br>
thesis block 122 from Fig. 11, which is shown in detail in<br>
Fig. 12, performs a reconstruction which is also based on<br>
the 32 bands in the example.<br>
In the following, reference is made to Fig. 13 showing a<br>
setup to determine certain BCC parameters. Normally, ICLD,<br>
ICTD and ICC parameters can be defined between pairs of<br>
channels. However, it is preferred to determine ICLD and<br>
ICTD parameters between a reference channel and each other<br>
channel. This is illustrated in Fig. 13A.<br><br>
ICC parameters can be defined in different ways. Most gen-<br>
erally, one could estimate ICC parameters in the encoder<br>
between all possible channel pairs as indicated in Fig.<br>
13B. In this case, a decoder would synthesize ICC such that<br>
it is approximately the same as in the original multi-<br>
channel signal between all possible channel pairs. It was,<br>
however, proposed to estimate only ICC parameters between<br>
the strongest two channels at each time. This scheme is il-<br>
lustrated in Fig. 13C, where an example is shown, in which<br>
at one time instance, an ICC parameter is estimated between<br>
channels 1 and 2, and, at another time instance, an ICC pa-<br>
rameter is calculated between channels 1 and 5. The decoder<br>
then synthesizes the inter-channel correlation between the<br>
strongest channels in the decoder and applies some heuris-<br>
tic rule for computing and synthesizing the inter-channel<br>
coherence for the remaining channel pairs.<br>
Regarding the calculation of, for example, the multiplica-<br>
tion parameters ai, aN based on transmitted ICLD parame-<br>
ters, reference is made to AES convention paper 5574 cited<br>
above. The ICLD parameters represent an energy distribution<br>
in an original multi-channel signal. Without loss of gener-<br>
ality, it is shown in Fig. 13A that there are four ICLD pa-<br>
rameters showing the energy difference between all other<br>
channels and the front left channel. In the side informa-<br>
tion processing block 123, the multiplication parameters<br>
a1, ..., aN are derived from the ICLD parameters such that the<br>
total energy of all reconstructed output channels is the<br>
same as (or proportional to) the energy of the transmitted<br>
sum signal. A simple way for determining these parameters<br>
is a 2-stage process, in which, in a first stage, the mul-<br>
tiplication factor for the left front channel is set to<br>
unity, while multiplication factors for the other channels<br><br>
in Fig. 13A are set to the transmitted ICLD values. Then,<br>
in a second stage, the energy of all five channels is cal-<br>
culated and compared to the energy of the transmitted sum<br>
signal. Then, all channels are downscaled using a down-<br>
scaling factor which is equal for all channels, wherein the<br>
downscaling factor is selected such that the total energy<br>
of all reconstructed output channels is, after downscaling,<br>
equal to the total energy of the transmitted sum signal.<br>
Naturally, there are other methods for calculating the mul-<br>
tiplication factors, which do not rely on the 2-stage proc-<br>
ess but which only need a 1-stage process.<br>
Regarding the delay parameters, it is to be noted that the<br>
delay parameters ICTD, which are transmitted from a BCC en-<br>
coder can be used directly, when the delay parameter d1 for<br>
the left front channel is set to zero. No rescaling has to<br>
be done here, since a delay does not alter the energy of<br>
the signal.<br>
Regarding the inter-channel coherence measure ICC transmit-<br>
ted from the BCC encoder to the BCC decoder, it is to be<br>
noted here that a coherence manipulation can be done by<br>
modifying the multiplication factors a1, ..., an such as by<br>
multiplying the weighting factors of all subbands with ran-<br>
dom numbers with values between 201ogl0(-6) and 201ogl0(6).<br>
The pseudo-random sequence is preferably chosen such that<br>
the variance is approximately constant for all critical<br>
bands, and the average is zero within each critical band.<br>
The same sequence is applied to the spectral coefficients<br>
for each different frame. Thus, the auditory image width is<br>
controlled by modifying the variance of the pseudo-random<br>
sequence. A larger variance creates a larger image width.<br><br>
The variance modification can be performed in individual<br>
bands that are critical-band wide. This enables the simul-<br>
taneous existence of multiple objects in an auditory scene,<br>
each object having a different image width. A suitable am-<br>
plitude distribution for the pseudo-random sequence is a<br>
uniform distribution on a logarithmic scale as it is out-<br>
lined in the US patent application publication 2003/0219130<br>
A1. Nevertheless, all BCC synthesis processing is related<br>
to a single input channel transmitted as the sum signal<br>
from the BCC encoder to the BCC decoder as shown in Fig.<br>
11.<br>
To transmit the five channels in a compatible way, i.e., in<br>
a bitstream format, which is also understandable for a nor-<br>
mal stereo decoder, the so-called matrixing technique has<br>
been used as described in "MUSICAM surround: a universal<br>
multi-channel coding system compatible with ISO 11172-3",<br>
G. Theile and G. Stoll, AES preprint 3403, October 1992,<br>
San Francisco. The five input channels L, R, C, Ls, and Rs<br>
are fed into a matrixing device performing a matrixing op-<br>
eration to calculate the basic or compatible stereo chan-<br>
nels Lo, Ro, from the five input channels. In particular,<br>
these basic stereo channels Lo/Ro are calculated as set out<br>
below:<br><br>
x and y are constants. The other three channels C, Ls, Rs<br>
are transmitted as they are in an extension layer, in addi-<br>
tion to a basic stereo layer, which includes an encoded<br>
version of the basic stereo signals Lo/Ro. With respect to<br><br>
the bitstream, this Lo/Ro basic stereo layer includes a<br>
header, information such as scale factors and subband sam-<br>
ples. The multi-channel extension layer, i.e., the central<br>
channel and the two surround channels are included in the<br>
multi-channel extension field, which is also called ancil-<br>
lary data field.<br>
At a decoder-side, an inverse matrixing operation is per-<br>
formed in order to form reconstructions of the left and<br>
right channels in the five-channel representation using the<br>
basic stereo channels Lo, Ro and the three additional chan-<br>
nels. Additionally, the three additional channels are de-<br>
coded from the ancillary information in order to obtain a<br>
decoded five-channel or surround representation of the<br>
original multi-channel audio signal.<br>
Another approach for multi-channel encoding is described in<br>
the publication "Improved MPEG-2 audio multi-channel encod-<br>
ing", B. Grill, J. Herre, K. H. Brandenburg, E. Eberlein,<br>
J. Roller, J. Mueller, AES preprint 3865, February 1994,<br>
Amsterdam, in which, in order to obtain backward compati-<br>
bility, backward compatible modes are considered. To this<br>
end, a compatibility matrix is used to obtain two so-called<br>
downmix channels Lc, Rc from the original five input chan-<br>
nels. Furthermore, it is possible to dynamically select<br>
the three auxiliary channels transmitted as ancillary data.<br>
In order to exploit stereo irrelevancy, a joint stereo<br>
technique is applied to groups of channels, e. g. the three<br>
front channels, i.e., for the left channel, the right chan-<br>
nel and the center channel. To this end, these three chan-<br>
nels are combined to obtain a combined channel. This com-<br>
bined channel is quantized and packed into the bitstream.<br><br>
Then, this combined channel together with the corresponding<br>
joint stereo information is input into a joint stereo de-<br>
coding module to obtain joint stereo decoded channels,<br>
i.e., a joint stereo decoded left channel, a joint stereo<br>
decoded right channel and a joint stereo decoded center<br>
channel. These joint stereo decoded channels are, together<br>
with the left surround channel and the right surround chan-<br>
nel input into a compatibility matrix block to form the<br>
first and the second downmix channels Lc, Rc. Then, quan-<br>
tized versions of both downmix channels and a quantized<br>
version of the combined channel are packed into the bit-<br>
stream together with joint stereo coding parameters.<br>
Using intensity stereo coding, therefore, a group of inde-<br>
pendent original channel signals is transmitted within a<br>
single portion of "carrier" data. The decoder then recon-<br>
structs the involved signals as identical data, which are<br>
rescaled according to their original energy-time envelopes.<br>
Consequently, a linear combination of the transmitted chan-<br>
nels will lead to results, which are quite different from<br>
the original downmix. This applies to any kind of joint<br>
stereo coding based on the intensity stereo concept. For a<br>
coding system providing compatible downmix channels, there<br>
is a direct consequence: The reconstruction by dematrixing,<br>
as described in the previous publication, suffers from ar-<br>
tifacts caused by the imperfect reconstruction. Using a so-<br>
called joint stereo predistortion scheme, in which a joint<br>
stereo coding of the left, the right and the center chan-<br>
nels is performed before matrixing in the encoder, allevi-<br>
ates this problem. In this way, the dematrixing scheme for<br>
reconstruction introduces fewer artifacts, since, on the<br>
encoder-side, the joint stereo decoded signals have been<br>
used for generating the downmix channels. Thus, the imper-<br><br>
feet reconstruction process is shifted into the compatible<br>
downmix channels Lc and Rc, where it is much more likely to<br>
be masked by the audio signal itself.<br>
Although such a system has resulted in fewer artifacts be-<br>
cause of dematrixing on the decoder-side, it nevertheless<br>
has some drawbacks. A drawback is that the stereo-<br>
compatible downmix channels Lc and Rc are derived not from<br>
the original channels but from intensity stereo<br>
coded/decoded versions of the original channels. Therefore,<br>
data losses because of the intensity stereo coding system<br>
are included in the compatible downmix channels. Astereo-<br>
only decoder, which only decodes the compatible channels<br>
rather than the enhancement intensity stereo encoded chan-<br>
nels, therefore, provides an output signal, which is af-<br>
fected by intensity stereo induced data losses.<br>
Additionally, a full additional channel has to be transmit-<br>
ted besides the two downmix channels. This channel is the<br>
combined channel, which is formed by means of joint stereo<br>
coding of the left channel, the right channel and the cen-<br>
ter channel. Additionally, the intensity stereo information<br>
to reconstruct the original channels L, R, C from the com-<br>
bined channel also has to be transmitted to the decoder. At<br>
the decoder, an inverse matrixing, i.e., a dematrixing op-<br>
eration is performed to derive the surround channels from<br>
the two downmix channels. Additionally, the original left,<br>
right and center channels are approximated by joint stereo<br>
decoding using the transmitted combined channel and the<br>
transmitted joint stereo parameters. It is to be noted that<br>
the original left, right and center channels are derived by<br>
joint stereo decoding of the combined channel.<br><br>
It has been found out that in case of intensity stereo<br>
techniques, when used in combination with multi-channel<br>
signals, only fully coherent output signals which are based<br>
on the same base channel can be produced.<br>
In BCC techniques, it is quite expensive to reduce the in-<br>
ter-channel coherence in a reconstructed multi-channel out-<br>
put signal, since a pseudo-random number generator for in-<br>
fluencing the weighting sectors is required. Additionally,<br>
it has been shown that this kind of processing is problem-<br>
atic in that artifacts because of randomly manipulating<br>
multiplication factors or time delay factors can be intro-<br>
duced which can become audible under certain circumstances<br>
and, therefore, deteriorate the quality of the recon-<br>
structed multi-channel output signal.<br>

ferent from the first base channel; and means for synthe-<br>

In accordance with the third aspect of the present inven-<br>
tion, this object is achieved by an apparatus for generat-<br>
ing a downmix signal from a multi-channel original signal,<br>
the downmix signal having a number of channels being<br>
smaller than a number of original channels, comprising:<br>

bution among the channels in the multi-channel original<br><br>
signal; means for determining a coherence measure between<br>

cated at one side of an assumed listener position; and<br>

and only at least one coherence measure between two origi-<br>
nal channels located at the one side or a value derived<br>
from the at least one coherence measure, but not using any<br>
coherence measure between channels located at different<br>
sides of the assumed listener position.<br>
In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present inven-<br>
tion, this object is achieved by a method for generating a<br>
downmix signal from a multi-channel original signal, the<br>
downmix signal having a number of channels being smaller<br>
than a number of original channels, comprising: calculating<br>
a first downmix channel and a second downmix channel using<br>
a downmix rule; calculating parametric level information<br>
representing an energy distribution among the channels in<br>
 the multi-channel original signal; determining a coherence<br>
measure between two original channels, the two original<br>
channels being located at one side of an assumed listener<br>
position; and forming an output signal using the first and<br>
the second downmix channels, the parametric level informa-<br>
tion and only at least one coherence measure between two<br>
original channels located at the one side or a value de-<br>
rived from the at least one coherence measure, but not us-<br>
ing any coherence measure between channels located at dif-<br>
ferent sides of the assumed listener position.<br>
In accordance with a fifth aspect and a sixth aspect of the<br>
present invention, this object is achieved by a computer<br>
program including the method for constructing the multi-<br><br>
channel output signal or the method of generating a downmix<br>
signal.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that an effi-<br>
cient and artifact-reduced reconstruction of a multi-<br>
channel output signal is obtained, when there are two or<br>
more channels, which can be transmitted from an encoder to<br>
a decoder, wherein the channels which are preferably a left<br>
and a right stereo channel, show a certain degree of inco-<br>
herence. This will normally be the case, since the left and<br>
right stereo channels or the left and right compatible ste-<br>
reo channels as obtained by downmixing a multi-channel sig-<br>
nal will usually show a certain degree of incoherence,<br>
i.e., will not be fully coherent or fully correlated.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the reconstructed<br>
output channels of the multi-channel output signal are de-<br>
correlated from each other by determining different base<br>
channels for the different output channels, wherein the<br>
different base channels are obtained by using varying de-<br>
grees of the uncorrelated transmitted channels.<br>
In other words, a reconstructed output channel having, for<br>
example, the left transmitted input channel as a base chan-<br>
nel would be - in the BCC subband domain - fully correlated<br>
with another reconstructed output channel which has the<br>
same e.g. left channel as the base channel assuming no ex-<br>
tra "correlation synthesis". In this context, it is to be<br>
noted that deterministic delay and level settings do not<br>
reduce coherence between these channels. In accordance with<br>
the present invention, the coherence between these chan-<br>
nels, which is 100 % in the above example is reduced to a<br>
certain coherence degree or coherence measure by using a<br><br>
first base channel for constructing the first output chan-<br>
nel and for using a second base channel for constructing<br>
the second output channel, wherein the first and second<br>
base channels have different "portions" of the two trans-<br>
mitted (de-correlated) channels. This means that the first<br>
base channel is influenced stronger by the first transmit-<br>
ted or is even identical to the first transmitted channel,<br>
compared to the second base channel which is influenced<br>
less by the first channel, i.e., which is more influenced<br>
by the second transmitted channel.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, inherent de-<br>
correlation between the transmitted channels is used for<br>
providing de-correlated channels in a multi-channel output<br>
signal.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a coherence measure between re-<br>
spective channel pairs such as front left and left surround<br>
or front right and right surround is determined in an en-<br>
coder in a time-dependent and frequency-dependent way and<br>
transmitted as side information, to an inventive decoder<br>
such that a dynamic determination of base channels and,<br>
therefore, a dynamic manipulation of coherence between the<br>
reconstructed output channels can be obtained.<br>
Compared to the above mentioned prior art case, in which<br>
only an ICC cue for the two strongest channels is transmit-<br>
ted, the inventive system is easier to control and provides<br>
a better quality reconstruction, since no determination of<br>
the strongest channels in an encoder or a decoder are nec-<br>
essary, since the inventive coherence measure always re-<br>
lates to the same channel pair irrespective of the fact,<br>
whether this channel pair includes the strongest channels<br><br>
or not. Higher quality compared to the prior art systems is<br>
obtained in that two downmixed channels are transmitted<br>
from an encoder to a decoder such that the left/right co-<br>
herence relation is automatically transmitted such that no<br>
extra information on a left/right coherence is required.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention has to be seen<br>
in the fact that a decoder-side computing workload can be<br>
reduced, since the normal decorrelation processing load can<br>
be reduced or even completely eliminated.<br>
Preferably, parametric channel side information for one or<br>
more of the original channels are derived such that they<br>
relate to one of the downmix channels rather than, as in<br>
 the prior art, to an additional "combined" joint stereo<br>
channel. This means that the parametric channel side infor-<br>
mation are calculated such that, on a decoder side, a chan-<br>
nel reconstructor uses the channel side information and one<br>
of the downmix channels or a combination of the downmix<br>
channels to reconstruct an approximation of the original<br>
audio channel, to which the channel side information is as-<br>
signed.<br>
This concept is advantageous in that it provides a bit-<br>
efficient multi-channel extension such that a multi-channel<br>
audio signal can be played at a decoder.<br>
Additionally, the concept is backward compatible, since a<br>
lower scale decoder, which is only adapted for two-channel<br>
processing, can simply ignore the extension information,<br>
i.e., the channel side information. The lower scale decoder<br>
can only play the two downmix channels to obtain a stereo<br>
representation of the original multi-channel audio signal.<br><br>
A higher scale decoder, however, which is enabled for<br>
multi-channel operation, can use the transmitted channel<br>
side information to reconstruct approximations of the<br>
original channels.<br>
The present embodiment is advantageous in that it is bit-<br>
efficient, since, in contrast to the prior art, no addi-<br>
tional carrier channel beyond the first and second downmix<br>
channels Lc, Rc is required. Instead, the channel side in-<br>
formation are related to one or both downmix channels. This<br>
means that the downmix channels themselves serve as a car-<br>
rier channel, to which the channel side information are<br>
combined to reconstruct an original audio channel. This<br>
means that the channel side information are preferably pa-<br>
rametric side information, i.e., information which do not<br>
include any subband samples or spectral coefficients. In-<br>
stead, the parametric side information are information used<br>
for weighting (in time and/or frequency) the respective<br>
downmix channel or the combination of the respective down-<br>
mix channels to obtain a reconstructed version of a se-<br>
lected original channel.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a back-<br>
ward compatible coding of a multi-channel signal based on a<br>
compatible stereo signal is obtained. Preferably, the com-<br>
patible stereo signal (downmix signal) is generated using<br>
matrixing of the original channels of multi-channel audio<br>
signal.<br>
Preferably, channel side information for a selected origi-<br>
nal channel is obtained based on joint stereo techniques<br>
such as intensity stereo coding or binaural cue coding.<br>
Thus, at the decoder side, no dematrixing operation has to<br><br>
be performed. The problems associated with dematrixing,<br>
i.e., certain artifacts related to an undesired distribu-<br>
tion of quantization noise in dematrixing operations, are<br>
avoided. This is due to the fact that the decoder uses a<br>
channel reconstructor, which reconstructs an original sig-<br>
nal, by using one of the downmix channels or a combination<br>
of the downmix channels and the transmitted channel side<br>
information.<br>
Preferably, the inventive concept is applied to a multi-<br>
channel audio signal having five channels. These five chan-<br>
nels are a left channel L, a right channel R, a center<br>
channel C, a left surround channel Ls, and a right surround<br>
channel Rs. Preferably, downmix channels are stereo com-<br>
patible downmix channels Ls and Rs, which provide a stereo<br>
representation of the original multi-channel audio signal.<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, for each original channel, channel side informa-<br>
tion are calculated at an encoder side packed into output<br>
data. Channel side information for the original left chan-<br>
nel are derived using the left downmix channel. Channel<br>
side information for the original left surround channel are<br>
derived using the left downmix channel. Channel side infor-<br>
mation for the original right channel are derived from the<br>
right downmix channel. Channel side information for the<br>
original right surround channel are derived from the right<br>
downmix channel.<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, channel information for the original center<br>
channel are derived using the first downmix channel as well<br>
as the second downmix channel, i.e., using a combination of<br><br>
the two downmix channels. Preferably, this combination is a<br>
summation.<br>
Thus, the groupings, i.e., the relation between the channel<br>
side information and the carrier signal, i.e., the used<br>
downmix channel for providing channel side information for<br>
a selected original channel are such that, for optimum<br>
quality, a certain downmix channel is selected, which con-<br>
tains the highest possible relative amount of the respec-<br>
tive original multi-channel signal which is represented by<br>
means of channel side information. As such a joint stereo<br>
carrier signal, the first and the second downmix channels<br>
are used. Preferably, also the sum of the first and the<br>
second downmix channels can be used. Naturally, the sum of<br>
the first and second downmix channels can be used for cal-<br>
culating channel side information for each of the original<br>
channels. Preferably, however, the sum of the downmix chan-<br>
nels is used for calculating the channel side information<br>
of the original center channel in a surround environment,<br>
such as five channel surround, seven channel surround, 5.1<br>
surround or 7.1 surround. Using the sum of the first and<br>
second downmix channels is especially advantageous, since<br>
no additional transmission overhead has to be performed.<br>
This is due to the fact that both downmix channels are pre-<br>
sent at the decoder such that summing of these downmix<br>
channels can easily be performed at the decoder without re-<br>
quiring any additional transmission bits.<br>
Preferably, the channel side information forming the multi-<br>
channel extension are input into the output data bit stream<br>
in a compatible way such that a lower scale decoder simply<br>
ignores the multi-channel extension data and only provides<br>
a stereo representation of the multi-channel audio signal.<br><br>
Nevertheless, a higher scale encoder not only uses two<br>
downmix channels, but, in addition, employs the channel<br>
side information to reconstruct a full multi-channel repre-<br>
sentation of the original audio signal.<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
Fig. 1A shows an apparatus for processing a multi-channel<br>
audio signal 10 having at least three original channels<br>
such as R, L and C. Preferably, the original audio signal<br>
has more than three channels, such as five channels in the<br>
surround environment, which is illustrated in Fig. 1A. The<br>
five channels are the left channel L, the right channel R,<br>
the center channel C, the left surround channel Ls and the<br>
right surround channel Rs. The inventive apparatus includes<br>
means 12 for providing a first downmix channel Lc and a<br>
second downmix channel Rc, the first and the second downmix<br>
channels being derived from the original channels. For de-<br>
riving the downmix channels from the original channels,<br>
there exist several possibilities. One possibility is to<br>
derive the downmix channels Lc and Rc by means of matrixing<br>
the original channels using a matrixing operation as illus-<br>
trated in Fig. 6. This matrixing operation is performed in<br>
the time domain.<br>
The matrixing parameters a, b and t are selected such that<br>
they are lower than or equal to 1. Preferably, a and b are<br>
0.7 or 0.5. The overall weighting parameter t is preferably<br>
chosen such that channel clipping is avoided. <br><br>
Alternatively, as it is indicated in Fig. 1A, the downmix<br>
channels Lc and Rc can also be externally supplied. This<br>
may be done, when the downmix channels Lc and Rc are the<br>
result of a "hand mixing" operation. In this scenario, a<br>
sound engineer mixes the downmix channels by himself rather<br>
than by using an automated matrixing operation. The sound<br>
engineer performs creative mixing to get optimized downmix<br>
channels Lc and Rc which give the best possible stereo rep-<br>
resentation of the original multi-channel audio signal.<br>
In case of an external supply of the downmix channels, the<br>
means for providing does not perform a matrixing operation<br>
but simply forwards the externally supplied downmix chan-<br>
nels to a subsequent calculating means 14.<br>
The calculating means 14 is operative to calculate the<br>
channel side information such as li, lsi, ri or rsi for se-<br>
lected original channels such as L, Ls, R or Rs, respec-<br>
tively. In particular, the means 14 for calculating is op-<br>
erative to calculate the channel side information such that<br>
a downmix channel, when weighted using the channel side in-<br>
formation, results in an approximation of the selected<br>
original channel.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the means for calculating<br>
channel side information is further operative to calculate<br>
the channel side information for a selected original chan-<br>
nel such that a combined downmix channel including a combi-<br>
nation of the first and second downmix channels, when<br>
weighted using the calculated channel side information re-<br>
sults in an approximation of the selected original channel.<br><br>
To show this feature in the figure, an adder 14a and a com-<br>
bined channel side information calculator 14b are shown.<br>
It is clear for those skilled in the art that these ele-<br>
ments do not have to be implemented as distinct elements.<br>
Instead, the whole functionality of the blocks 14, 14a, and<br>
14b can be implemented by means of a certain processor<br>
which may be a general purpose processor or any other means<br>
for performing the required functionality.<br>
Additionally, it is to be noted here that channel signals<br>
being subband samples or frequency domain values are indi-<br>
cated in capital letters. Channel side information are, in<br>
contrast to the channels themselves, indicated by small<br>
letters. The channel side information Ci is, therefore, the<br>
channel side information for the original center channel C.<br>
The channel side information as well as the downmix chan-<br>
nels Lc and Rc or an encoded version Lc' and Rc' as pro-<br>
duced by an audio encoder 16 are input into an output data<br>
formatter 18. Generally, the output data formatter 18 acts<br>
as means for generating output data, the output data in-<br>
cluding the channel side information for at least one<br>
original channel, the first downmix channel or a signal de-<br>
rived from the first downmix channel (such as an encoded<br>
version thereof) and the second downmix channel or a signal<br>
derived from the second downmix channel (such as an encoded<br>
version thereof).<br>
The output data or output bitstream 20 can then be trans-<br>
mitted to a bitstream decoder or can be stored or distrib-<br>
uted. Preferably, the output bitstream 20 is a compatible<br>
bitstream which can also be read by a lower scale decoder<br><br>
not having a multi-channel extension capability. Such lower<br>
scale encoders such as most existing normal state of the<br>
art mp3 decoders will simply ignore the multi-channel ex-<br>
tension data, i.e., the channel side information. They will<br>
only decode the first and second downmix channels to pro-<br>
duce a stereo output. Higher scale decoders, such as multi-<br>
channel enabled decoders will read the channel side infor-<br>
mation and will then generate an approximation of the<br>
original audio channels such that a multi-channel audio im-<br>
pression is obtained.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a preferred embodiment of the present inven-<br>
tion in the environment of five channel surround / mp3.<br>
Here, it is preferred to write the surround enhancement<br>
data into the ancillary data field in the standardized mp3<br>
bit stream syntax such that an "mp3 surround" bit stream is<br>
obtained.<br>
Fig. 1B illustrates a more detailed representation of ele-<br>
ment 14 in Fig. 1A. In a preferred embodiment of the pre-<br>
sent invention, a calculator 14 includes means 141 for cal-<br>
culating parametric level information representing an en-<br>
ergy distribution among the channels in the multi channel<br>
original signal shown at 10 in Fig. 1A. Element 141 there-<br>
fore is able to generate output level information for all<br>
original channels. In a preferred embodiment, this level<br>
information includes ICLD parameters obtained by regular<br>
BCC synthesis as has been described in connection with<br>
Figs. 10 to 13.<br>
Element 14 further comprises means 142 for determining a<br>
coherence measure between two original channels located at<br>
one side of an assumed listener position. In case of the 5-<br><br>
channel surround example shown in Fig. 1A, such a channel<br>
pair includes the right channel R and the right surround<br>
channel Rs or, alternatively or additionally the left chan-<br>
nel L and the left surround channel Ls. Element 14 alterna-<br>
 tively further comprises means 143 for calculating the time<br>
difference for such a channel pair, i.e., a channel pair<br>
having channels which are located at one side of an assumed<br>
listener position.<br>
The output data formatter 18 from Fig. 1A is operative to<br>
input into the data stream at 20 the level information rep-<br>
resenting an energy distribution among the channels in the<br>
multi channel original signal and a coherence measure only<br>
for the left and left surround channel pair and/or the<br>
right and the right surround channel pair. The output data<br>
formatter, however, is operative to not include any other<br>
coherence measures or optionally time differences into the<br>
output signal such that the amount of side information is<br>
reduced compared to the prior art scheme in which ICC cues<br>
for all possible channel pairs were transmitted.<br>
To illustrate the inventive encoder as shown in Fig. 1B in<br>
more detail, reference is made to Fig. 14A and Fig. 14B. In<br>
Fig. 14A, an arrangement of channel speakers for an example<br>
5-channel system is given with respect to a position of an<br>
assumed listener position which is located at the center<br>
point of a circle on which the respective speakers are<br>
placed. As outlined above, the 5-channel system includes a<br>
left surround channel, a left channel, a center channel, a<br>
right channel and a right surround channel. Naturally, such<br><br>
It is to be noted here that the left surround channel can<br>
also be termed as "rear left channel". The same is true for<br>
the right surround channel. This channel is also known as<br>
the rear right channel.<br>
In contrast to state of the art BCC with one transmission<br>
channel, in which the same base channel, i.e., the trans-<br>
mitted mono signal as shown in Fig. 11 is used for generat-<br>
ing each of the N output channels, the inventive system<br>
uses, as a base channel, one of the N transmitted channels<br>
or a linear combination thereof as the base channel for<br>
each of the N output channels.<br>
Therefore, Fig. 14 shows a NtoM scheme, i. e. a scheme, in<br>
which N original channels are downmixed to two downmix<br>
channels. In the example of Fig. 14, N is equal to 5 while<br>
M is equal to 2. In particular, for the front left channel<br>
reconstruction, the transmitted left channel Lc is used.<br>
Analogously, for the front right channel reconstruction,<br>
the second transmitted channel Rc is used as the base chan-<br>
nel. Additionally, an equal combination of Lc and Rc is<br>
used as the base channel for reconstructing the center<br>
channel. In accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, correlation measures are additionally transmit-<br>
ted from an encoder to a decoder. Therefore, for the left<br>
surround channel, not only the transmitted left channel Lc<br>
is used but the transmitted channel Lc + α1Rc such that the<br>
base channel for reconstructing the left surround channel<br>
is not fully coherent to the base channel for reconstruct-<br>
ing the front left channel. Analogously, the same procedure<br>
is performed for the right side (with respect to the as-<br>
sumed listener position), in that the base channel for re-<br><br>
constructing the right surround channel is different from<br>
the base channel for reconstructing the front right chan-<br>
nel, wherein the difference is dependent on the coherence<br>
measure α2 which is preferable transmitted from an encoder<br>
to a decoder as side information.<br>
The inventive process, therefore, is unique in that for the<br>
reproduction of preferable each output channel, a different<br>
base channel is used, wherein the base channels are equal<br>
to the transmitted channels or a linear combination<br>
thereof. This linear combination can depend on the trans-<br>
mitted base channels on varying degrees, wherein these de-<br>
grees depend on coherence measures which depends on the<br>
original multi-channel signal.<br>
The process of obtaining the N base channels given the M<br>
transmitted channels is called "upmixing". This upmixing<br>
can be implemented by multiplying a vector with the trans-<br>
mitted channels by a NxM matrix to generate N base chan-<br>
nels. By doing so, linear combinations of transmitted sig-<br>
nal channels are formed to produce the base signals for the<br>
output channel signals. A specific example for upmixing is<br>
shown in Fig. 14A, which is a 5 to 2-scheme applied for<br>
generating a 5-channel surround output signal with a 2-<br>
channel stereo transmission. Preferably, the base channel<br>
for an additional subwoofer output channel is the same as<br>
the center channel L+R. In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, a time-varying and - optionally - fre-<br>
quency-varying coherence measure is provided such that a<br>
time-adaptive upmixing matrix, which is - optionally - also<br>
frequency-selective is obtained.<br><br>
In the following, reference is made to Fig. 14B showing a<br>
background for the inventive encoder implementation illus-<br>
trated in Fig. 1B. In this context, it is to be noted that<br>
ICC and ICTD cues between left and right and left surround<br>
and right surround are the same as in the transmitted ste-<br>
reo signal. Thus, there is, in accordance with the present<br>
invention, no need for using ICC and ICTD cues between left<br>
and right and left surround and right surround for synthe-<br>
sizing or reconstructing an output signal. Another reason<br>
for not synthesizing ICC and ICTD cues between left and<br>
right and left surround and right surround is the general<br>
objective stating that the base channels have to be modi-<br>
fied as little as possible to maintain maximum signal qual-<br>
ity. Any signal modification potentially introduces arti-<br>
facts or non-naturalness.<br>
Therefore, only a level representation of the original<br>
multi-channel signal which is obtained by providing the<br>
ICLD cues is provided, while, in accordance with the pre-<br>
sent invention, ICC and ICTD parameters are only calculated<br>
and transmitted for channel pairs to one side of the as-<br>
sumed listener position. This is illustrated by the dotted<br>
line 144 for the left side and the dotted line 145 for the<br>
right side in Fig. 14B. In contrast to ICC and ICTD, ICLD<br>
synthesis is rather non-problematic with respect to arti-<br>
facts and non-naturalness because it just involves scaling<br>
of subband signals. Thus, ICLDs are synthesized as gener-<br>
ally as in regular BCC, i.e., between a reference channel<br>
and all other channels. More generally speaking, in a N 2 M<br>
scheme, ICLDs are synthesized between channel pairs similar<br>
to regular BCC. ICC and ICTD cues, however, are, in accor-<br>
dance with the present invention, only synthesized between<br>
channel pairs which are on the same side with respect to<br><br>
the assumed listener position, i.e., for the channel pair<br>
including the front left and the left surround channel or<br>
the channel pair including the front right and the right<br>
surround channel.<br>
In case of 7-channel or higher surround systems, in which<br>
there are three channels on the left side and three chan-<br>
nels on the right side, the same scheme can be applied,<br>
wherein only for possible channel pairs on the left side or<br>
the right side, coherence parameters are transmitted for<br>
providing different base channels for the reconstruction of<br>
the different output channels on one side of the assumed<br>
listener position. The inventive NtoM encoder as shown in<br>
Fig. 1A and Fig. 1B is, therefore, unique in that the input<br>
signals are downmixed not into one single channel but into<br>
M channels, and that ICTD and ICC cues are estimated and<br>
transmitted only between the channel pairs for which this<br>
is necessary.<br>
In a 5-channel surround system, the situation is shown in<br>
Fig. 14B from which it becomes clear that at least one co-<br>
herence measure between left and left surround has to be<br>
transmitted. This coherence measure can also be used for<br>
providing decorrelation between right and right surround.<br>
This is a low side information implementation. In case one<br>
has more available channel capacity, one can also generate<br>
and transmit a separate coherence measure between the right<br>
and the right surround channel such that, in an inventive<br>
decoder, also different degrees of decorrelation on the<br>
left side and on the right side can be obtained.<br>
Fig. 2A shows an illustration of an inventive decoder act-<br>
ing as an apparatus for inverse processing input data re-<br><br>
ceived at an input data port 22. The data received at the<br>
input data port 22 is the same data as output at the output<br>
data port 20 in Fig. 1A. Alternatively, when the data are<br>
not transmitted via a wired channel but via a wireless<br>
channel, the data received at data input port 22 are data<br>
derived from the original data produced by the encoder.<br>
The decoder input data are input into a data stream reader<br>
24 for reading the input data to finally obtain the channel<br>
side information 26 and the left downmix channel 28 and the<br>
right downmix channel 30. In case the input data includes<br>
encoded versions of the downmix channels, which corresponds<br>
to the case, in which the audio encoder 16 in Fig. 1A is<br>
present, the data stream reader 24 also includes an audio<br>
decoder, which is adapted to the audio encoder used for en-<br>
coding the downmix channels. In this case, the audio de-<br>
coder, which is part of the data stream reader 24, is op-<br>
erative to generate the first downmix channel Lc and the<br>
second downmix channel Rc, or, stated more exactly, a de-<br>
coded version of those channels. For ease of description, a<br>
distinction between signals and decoded versions thereof is<br>
only made where explicitly stated.<br>
The channel side information 26 and the left and right<br>
downmix channels 28 and 30 output by the data stream reader<br>
24 are fed into a multi-channel reconstructor 32 for pro-<br>
viding a reconstructed version 34 of the original audio<br>
signals, which can be played by means of a multi-channel<br>
player 36. In case the multi-channel reconstructor is op-<br>
erative in the frequency domain, the multi-channel player<br>
36 will receive frequency domain input data, which have to<br>
be in a certain way decoded such as converted into the time<br><br>
domain before playing them. To this end, the multi-channel<br>
player 36 may also include decoding facilities.<br>
It is to be noted here that a lower scale decoder will only<br>
have the data stream reader 24, which only outputs the left<br>
and right downmix channels 28 and 30 to a stereo output 38.<br>
An enhanced inventive decoder will, however, extract the<br>
channel side information 26 and use these side information<br>
and the downmix channels 28 and 30 for reconstructing re-<br>
constructed versions 34 of the original channels using the<br>
multi-channel reconstructor 32.<br>
Fig. 2B shows an inventive implementation of the multi-<br>
channel reconstructor 32 of Fig. 2A. Therefore, Fig. 2B<br>
shows an apparatus for constructing a multi-channel output<br>
signal using an input signal and parametric side informa-<br>
tion, the input signal including a first input channel and<br>
a second input channel derived from an original multi-<br>
channel signal, and the parametric side information de-<br>
scribing interrelations between channels of the multi-<br>
channel original signal. The inventive apparatus shown in<br>
Fig. 2B includes means 320 for providing a coherence meas-<br>
ure depending on a first original channel and a second<br>
original channel, the first original channel and the second<br>
original channel being included in the original multi-<br>
channel signal. In case the coherence measure is included<br>
in the parametric side information, the parametric side in-<br>
formation is input into means 320 as illustrated in Fig.<br>
2B. The coherence measure provided by means 320 is input<br>
into means 322 for determining base channels. In particu-<br>
lar, the means 322 is operative for determining a first<br>
base channel by selecting one of the first and the second<br>
input channels or a predetermined combination of the first<br><br>
and the second input channels. Means 322 is further opera-<br>
tive to determine a second base channel using the coherence<br>
measure such that the second base channel is different from<br>
the first base channel because of the coherence measure. In<br>
the example shown in Fig. 2B, which is related to the 5-<br>
channel surround system, the first input channel is the<br>
left compatible stereo channel Lc; and the second input<br>
channel is the right compatible stereo channel Rc. The<br>
means 322 is operative to determine the base channels which<br>
have already been described in connection with Fig. 14A.<br>
Thus, at the output of means 322, a separate base channel<br>
for each of the to be reconstructed output channels is ob-<br>
tained, wherein, preferably, the base channels output by<br>
means 322 are all different from each other, i.e., have a<br>
coherence measure between themselves, which is different<br>
for each pair.<br>
The base channels output by means 322 and parametric side<br>
information such as ICLD, ICTD or intensity stereo informa-<br>
tion are input into means 324 for synthesizing the first<br>
output channel such as L using the parametric side informa-<br>
tion and the first base channel to obtain a first synthe-<br>
sized output channel L, which is a reproduced version of<br>
the corresponding first original channel, and for synthe-<br>
sizing a second output channel such as Ls using the para-<br>
metric side information and the second base channel, the<br>
second output channel being a reproduced version of the<br>
second original channel. In addition, means 324 for synthe-<br>
sizing is operative to reproduce the right channel R and<br>
the right surround channel Rs using another pair of base<br>
channels, wherein the base channels in this other pair are<br>
different from each other because of the coherence measure<br><br>
or because of an additional coherence measure which has<br>
been derived for the right/right surround channel pair.<br>
A more detailed implementation of the inventive decoder is<br>
shown in Fig. 2C. It can be seen that in the preferred em-<br>
bodiment which is shown in Fig. 2C, the general structure<br>
is similar to the structure which has already been de-<br>
scribed in connection with Fig. 12 for a state of the art<br>
prior art BCC decoder. Contrary to Fig. 12, the inventive<br>
scheme shown in Fig. 2C includes two audio filter banks,<br>
i.e., one filter bank for each input signal. Naturally, a<br>
single filter bank is also sufficient. In this case, a con-<br>
trol is required which inputs into the single filter bank<br>
the input signals in a sequential order. The filter banks<br>
are illustrated by blocks 319a and 319b. The functionality<br>
of elements 320 and 322 - which are illustrated in Fig. 2B<br>
- is included in an upmixing block 323 in Fig. 2C.<br>
At the output of the upmixing block 323, base channels,<br>
which are different from each other, are obtained. This is<br>
in contrast to Fig. 12, in which the base channels on node<br>
130 are identical to each other. The synthesizing means 324<br>
shown in Fig. 2B includes preferably a delay stage 324a, a<br>
level modification stage 324b and, in some cases, a proc-<br>
 essing stage for performing additional processing tasks<br>
324c as well as a respective number of inverse audio filter<br>
banks 324d. In one embodiment, the functionality of ele-<br>
ments 324a, 324b, 324c and 324d can be the same as in the<br>
prior art device described in connection with Fig. 12.<br>
Fig. 2D shows a more detailed example of Fig. 2C for a 5-<br>
channel surround set up, in which two input channels y1 and<br>
y2 are input and five constructed output channels are ob-<br><br>
tained as shown in Fig. 2D. In contrast to Fig. 2C, a more<br>
detailed design of the upmixing block 323 is given. In par-<br>
ticular, a summation device 330 for providing the base<br>
channels for reconstructing a center output channel is<br>
shown. Additionally, two blocks 331, 332 titled "W" are<br>
shown in Fig. 2D. These blocks perform the weighted combi-<br>
nation of the two input channels based on the coherence<br>
measure K which is input at a coherence measure input 334.<br>
Preferably, the weighting block 331 or 332 also performs<br>
respective post processing operations for the base channels<br>
such as smoothing in time and frequency as will be outlined<br>
below. Thus, Fig. 2C is a general case of Fig. 2D, wherein<br>
Fig. 2C illustrates how the N output channels are gener-<br>
ated, given the decoder's M input channels. The transmitted<br>
signals are transformed to a sub band domain.<br>
The process of computing the base channels for each output<br>
channel is denoted upmixing, because each base channel is<br>
preferably a linear combination of the transmitted chan-<br>
nels. The upmixing can be performed in the time domain or<br>
in the sub band or frequency domain.<br>
For computing each base channel, a certain processing can<br>
be applied to reduce cancellation/amplification effects<br>
when the transmitted channels are out-of-phase or in-phase.<br>
ICTD are synthesized by imposing delays on the sub band<br>
signals and ICLD are synthesized by scaling the sub band<br>
signals. Different techniques can be used for synthesizing<br>
ICC such as manipulating the weighting factors or the time<br>
delays by means of a random number sequence. It is, how-<br>
ever, to be noted here that preferably, no coher-<br>
ence/correlation processing between output channels except<br>
the inventive determination of the different base channels<br><br>
for each output channel is performed. Therefore, a pre-<br>
ferred inventive device processes ICC cues received from an<br>
encoder for constructing the base channels and ICTD and<br>
ICLD cues received from an encoder for manipulating the al-<br>
ready constructed base cha nnel. Thus, ICC cues or — more<br>
generally speaking - coherence measures are not used for<br>
manipulating a base channel but are used for constructing<br>
the base channel which is manipulated later on.<br>
In the specific example shown in Fig. 2D, a 5-channel sur-<br>
round signal is decoded from a 2-channel stereo transmis-<br>
sion. A transmitted 2-channel stereo signal is converted to<br>
a sub band domain. Then, upmixing is applied to generate<br>
five preferable different base channels. ICTD cues are only<br>
synthesized between left and left surround, and right and<br>
right surround by applying delays di (k) as has been dis-<br>
cussed in connection with Fig. 14B. Also, the coherence<br>
measures are used for constructing the base channels<br>
(blocks 331 and 332) in Fig. 2D rather than for doing any<br>
post processing in block 324c.<br>
Inventively, the ICC and ICTD cues between left and right<br>
and left surround and right surround are maintained as in<br>
the transmitted stereo signal. Therefore, a single ICC cue<br>
and a single ICTD cue parameter will be sufficient and<br>
will, therefore, be transmitted from an encoder to a de-<br>
coder.<br>
In another embodiment, ICC cues and ICTD cues for both<br>
sides can be calculated in an encoder. These two values can<br>
be transmitted from an encoder to a decoder. Alternatively,<br>
the encoder can compute a resulting ICC or ICTD cue by in-<br>
putting the cues for both sides into a mathematical func-<br><br>
tion such as an averaging function etc for deriving the re-<br>
sulting value from the two coherence measures.<br>
In the following, reference is made to Fig. 15A and 15B to<br>
show a low-complexity implementation of the inventive con-<br>
cept. While a high-complexity implementation requires an<br>
encoder-side determination of the coherence measure at<br>
least between a channel pair on one side of the assumed<br>
listener position, and transmitting of this coherence meas-<br>
ure preferably in a quantized and entropy-encoded form, the<br>
low-complexity version does not require any coherence meas-<br>
ure determination on the encoder-side and any transmission<br>
from the encoded to the decoder of such information. In or-<br>
der to, nevertheless, obtain a good subjective quality of<br>
the reconstructed multi channel output signal, a predeter-<br>
mined coherence measure or, stated in other words, prede-<br>
termined weighting factors for determining a weighted com-<br>
bination of the transmitted input channels using such a<br>
predetermined weighting factor is provided by the means 324<br>
in Fig. 2D. There exist several possibilities to reduce co-<br>
herence in base channels for the reconstruction of output<br>
channels. Without the inventive measure, the respective<br>
output channels would be, in a base line implementation, in<br>
which no ICC and ICTD are encoded and transmitted, fully<br>
coherent. Therefore, any use of any predetermined coherence<br>
measure will reduce coherence in reconstructed output sig-<br>
nals such that the reproduced output signals are better ap-<br>
proximations of the corresponding original channels.<br>
To therefore prevent that base channels are fully coherent,<br>
the upmixing is done as shown for example in Fig. 15A as<br>
one alternative or Fig. 15B as another alternative. The<br>
five base channels are computed such that none of them are<br><br>
fully coherent, if the transmitted stereo signal is also<br>
not fully coherent. This results in that an inter-channel<br>
coherence between the left channel and the left surround<br>
channel or between the right channel and the right surround<br>
channel is automatically reduced, when the inter-channel<br>
coherence between the left channel and the right channel is<br>
reduced. For example, for an audio signal which is inde-<br>
pendent between all channels such as an applause signal,<br>
such upmixing has the advantage that a certain independence<br>
between left and left surround and right and right surround<br>
is generated without a need for synthesizing (and encoding)<br>
inter-channel coherence explicitly. Of course, this second<br>
version of upmixing can be combined with a scheme which<br>
still synthesizes ICC and ICTD.<br>
Fig. 15A shows an upmixing optimized for front left and<br>
front right, in which most independence is maintained be-<br>
tween the front left and the front right.<br>
Fig. 15B shows another example, in which front left and<br>
front right on the one hand and left surround and right<br>
surround on the other hand are treated in the same way in<br>
that the degree of independence of the front and rear chan-<br>
nels is the same. This can be seen in Fig. 15B by the fact<br>
that an angle between front left/right is the same as the<br>
angle between left surround/right.<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, dynamic upmixing instead of a static selection,<br>
is used. To this end, the invention also relates to an en-<br>
hanced algorithm which is able to dynamically adapt the up-<br>
mixing matrix in order to optimize a dynamic performance.<br>
In the example illustrated below, the upmixing matrix can<br><br>
be chosen for the back channels such that optimum reproduc-<br>
tion of front-rear coherence becomes possible. The inven-<br>
tive algorithm comprises the following steps:<br>
For the front channels, a simply assignment of base chan-<br>
nels is used, as the one described in Fig. 14A or 15A. By<br>
this simple choice, coherence of the channels along the<br>
left/right axis is preserved.<br>
In the encoder, the front-back coherence values such as ICC<br>
cues between left/left surround and preferably between<br>
right/right surround pairs are measured.<br>
In the decoder, the base channels for the left rear and<br>
right rear channels are determined by forming linear combi-<br>
nations of the transmitted channel signals, i.e., a trans-<br>
mitted left channel and a transmitted right channel. Spe-<br>
cifically, upmixing coefficients are determined such that<br>
the actual coherence between left and left surround and<br>
right and right surround achieves the values measured in<br>
the encoder. For practical purposes, this can be achieved<br>
when the transmitted channel signals exhibit sufficient<br>
decorrelations, which is normally the case in usual 5-<br>
channel scenarios.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of dynamic upmixing, an example<br>
of an implementation which is regarded as the best mode of<br>
carrying out the present invention, will be given with re-<br>
spect to Fig. 2E as to an encoder implementation and Fig.<br>
2F and Fig. 2G with respect to a decoder implementation.<br>
Fig. 2E shows one example for measuring front/back coher-<br>
ence values (ICC values) between the left and the left sur-<br>
round channel or between the right and the right surround<br><br>
channel, i.e., between a channel pair located at one side<br>
with respect to an assumed listener position.<br>
The equation shown in the box in Fig. 2E gives a coherence<br>
measure cc between the first channel x and the second chan-<br>
nel y. In one case, the first channel x is the left chan-<br>
nel, while the second channel y is the left surround chan-<br>
nel. In another case, the first channel x is the right<br>
channel, while the second channel y is the right surround<br>
channel. Xi stands for a sample of the respective channel x<br>
at the time instance i, while yi stands for a sample at a<br>
time instance of the other original channel y. It is to be<br>
noted here that the coherence measure can be calculated<br>
completely in the time domain. In this case, the summation<br>
index i runs from a lower border to an upper border,<br>
wherein the other border normally is the same as the number<br>
of samples in one frame in case of a frame-wise processing.<br>
Alternatively, coherence measures can also be calculated<br>
between band pass signals, i.e., signals having reduced<br>
band widths with respect to the original audio signal. In<br>
the latter case, the coherence measure is not only time-<br>
dependent but also frequency-dependent. The resulting<br>
front/back ICC cues, i.e., CCi for the left front/back co-<br>
herence and CCr for the right front/back coherence are<br>
transmitted to a decoder as parametric side information<br>
preferably in quantized and encoded form.<br>
In the following, reference will be made to Fig. 2F for<br>
showing a preferred decoder upmixing scheme. In the illus-<br>
trated case, the transmitted left channel is kept as the<br>
base channel for the left output channel. In order to de-<br>
rive the base channel for the left rear output channel, a<br><br>
linear combination between the left (1) and the right (r)<br>
transmitted channel, i.e., 1 + αr, is determined. The<br>
weighting factor a is determined such that the cross-<br>
correlation between 1 and 1 + ar is equal to the transmit-<br>
ted desired value CC1 for the left side and CCr for the<br>
right side or generally the coherence measure k.<br>
The calculation of the appropriate a value is described in<br>
Fig. 2F. In particular, a normalized cross-correlation of<br>
two signals 1 and r is defined as shown in the equation in<br>
the block of Fig. 2E.<br>
Given two transmitted signals 1 and r, the weighting factor<br>
a has to be determined such that the normalized cross-<br>
correlation of the signal 1 and 1 + ar is equal to a de-<br>
sired value k, i.e., the coherence measure. This measure is<br>
defined between -1 and +1.<br>
Using the definition of the cross-correlation for the two<br>
channels, one obtains the equation given in Fig. 2F for the<br>
value k. By using several abbreviations which are given in<br>
the bottom of Fig. 2F, the condition for k can be rewritten<br>
as a quadratic equation, the solution of which gives the<br>
weighting factor a.<br>
It can be shown that the equation always has real-valued<br>
solutions, i.e., that the discriminant is guaranteed to be<br>
non-negative.<br>
Depending on the basic cross-correlation of the signal 1<br>
and r, and on the desired cross-correlation k, one of both<br>
delivered solutions may in fact lead to the negative of the<br><br>
desired cross-correlation value and is, therefore, dis-<br>
carded for all further calculation.<br>
After calculating the base channel signal as a linear com-<br>
bination of the 1 signal and the r signal, the resulting<br>
signal is normalized (re-scaled) to the original signal en-<br>
ergy of the transmitted 1 or r channel signal.<br>
Similarly, the base channel signal for the right output<br>
channel can be derived by swapping the role of the left and<br>
right channels, i.e., considering the cross-correlation be-<br>
tween r and r + α1.<br>
In practice, it is preferred to smooth the results of the<br>
calculation process for the a value over time and fre-<br>
quency in order to obtain maximum signal quality. Also<br>
front/back correlation measurements other than left/left<br>
rear and right/right rear can be used to further maximize<br>
signal quality.<br>
Subsequently, a step-by-step description of the functional-<br>
ity performed by the multi-channel reconstructor 32 from<br>
Fig. 2A will be given, referring to Fig. 2G.<br>
Preferably, a weighting factor a is calculated (200) based<br>
on a dynamic coherence measure provided from an encoder to<br>
a decoder or based on a static provision of a coherence<br>
measure as described in connection with Fig. 15A and Fig.<br>
15B. Then, the weighting factor is smoothed over time<br>
and/or frequency (step 202) to obtain a smoothed weighting<br>
factor αs. Then, a base channel b is calculated to be for<br>
example 1 + αsr (step 204) . The base channel b is then<br><br>
used, together with other base channels, to calculate raw<br>
output signals.<br>
As it becomes clear from box 206, the level representation<br>
ICLD as well as the delay representation ICTD are required<br>
for calculating raw output signals. Then, the raw output<br>
signals are scaled to have the same energy as a sum of the<br>
individual energies of the left and right input channels.<br>
Stated in other words, the raw output signals are scaled by<br>
means of a scaling factor such that a sum of the individual<br>
energies of the scaled raw output signals is the same as<br>
the sum of the individual energies of the transmitted left<br>
and right input channels.<br>
Alternatively, one could also calculated the sum of the<br>
left and right transmitted channels and to use the energy<br>
of the resulting signal. Additionally, one could also cal-<br>
culate a sum signal by sample wise summing the raw output<br>
signals and to use the energy of the resulting signal for<br>
scaling purposes.<br>
Then, at an output of box 208, the reconstructed output<br>
channels are obtained, which are unique in that none of the<br>
reconstructed output channels is fully coherent to another<br>
of the reconstructed output channels such that a maximum<br>
quality of the reproduced output signal is obtained.<br>
To summarize, the inventive concept is advantageous in that<br>
an arbitrary number of transmitted channels (M) and an ar-<br>
bitrary number of output channels (N) can be used.<br><br>
Additionally, the conversion between the transmitted chan-<br>
nels and the base channels for the output channels is done<br>
via preferably dynamic upmixing.<br>
In an important embodiment, upmixing consists of a multi-<br>
plication by an upmixing matrix, i.e., forming linear com-<br>
binations of the transmitted channels, wherein front chan-<br>
nels are preferably synthesized by using the corresponding<br>
transmitted base channels as base channels, while the rear<br>
channels consist of linear combination of the transmitted<br>
channels, the degree of a linear combination depending on a<br>
coherence measure.<br>
Additionally, this upmixing process is preferably performed<br>
 signal adaptive in a time-varying fashion. Specifically,<br>
the upmixing process preferably depends on a side informa-<br>
tion transmitted from a BCC encoder such as inter-channel<br>
coherence cues for a front/rear coherence.<br>
 Given the base channel for each output channel, a process-<br>
ing similar to a regular binaural cue coding is applied to<br>
synthesize spatial cues, i.e., applying scalings and delays<br>
in subbands and applying techniques to reduce coherence be-<br>
tween channels, wherein ICC cues are additionally, or al-<br>
ternatively, used for constructing respective base channels<br>
to obtain optimal reproduction of front/rear coherence.<br>
Fig. 3A shows an embodiment of the inventive calculator 14<br>
for calculating the channel side information, which an au-<br>
dio encoder on the one hand and the channel side informa-<br>
tion calculator on the other hand operate on the same spec-<br>
tral representation of multi-channel signal. Fig. 1, how-<br>
ever, shows the other alternative, in which the audio en-<br><br>
coder on the one hand and the channel side information cal-<br>
culator on the other hand operate on different spectral<br>
representations of the multi-channel signal. When computing<br>
resources are not as important as audio guality, the Fig.<br>
1A alternative is preferred, since filterbanks individually<br>
optimized for audio encoding and side information calcula-<br>
tion can be used. When, however, computing resources are an<br>
issue, the Fig. 3A alternative is preferred, since this al-<br>
ternative requires less computing power because of a shared<br>
utilization of elements.<br>
The device shown in Fig. 3A is operative for receiving two<br>
channels A, B. The device shown in Fig. 3A is operative to<br>
calculate a side information for channel B such that using<br>
this channel side information for the selected original<br>
channel B, a reconstructed version of channel B can be cal-<br>
culated from the channel signal A. Additionally, the device<br>
shown in Fig. 3A is operative to form frequency domain<br>
channel side information, such as parameters for weighting<br>
(by multiplying or time processing as in BCC coding e. g.)<br>
spectral values or subband samples. To this end, the inven-<br>
tive calculator includes windowing and time/frequency con-<br>
version means 140a to obtain a frequency representation of<br>
channel A at an output 14 0b or a frequency domain represen-<br>
tation of channel B at an output 140c.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the side information determi-<br>
nation (by means of the side information determination<br>
means 140f) is performed using quantized spectral values.<br>
Then, a quantizer 140d is also present which preferably is<br>
controlled using a psychoacoustic model having a psycho-<br>
acoustic model control input 140e. Nevertheless, a quan-<br>
tizer is not required, when the side information determina-<br><br>
tion means 140c uses a non-quantized representation of the<br>
channel A for determining the channel side information for<br>
channel B.<br>
In case the channel side information for channel B are cal-<br>
culated by means of a frequency domain representation of<br>
the channel A and the frequency domain representation of<br>
the channel B, the windowing and time/frequency conversion<br>
means 140a can be the same as used in a filterbank-based<br>
audio encoder. In this case, when AAC (ISO/IEC 13818-3) is<br>
considered, means 140a is implemented as an MDCT filter<br>
bank (MDCT = modified discrete cosine transform) with 50%<br>
overlap-and-add functionality.<br>
In such a case, the quantizer 140d is an iterative quan-<br>
tizer such as used when mp3 or AAC encoded audio signals<br>
are generated. The frequency domain representation of chan-<br>
nel A, which is preferably already quantized can then be<br>
directly used for entropy encoding using an entropy encoder<br>
140g, which may be a Huffman based encoder or an entropy<br>
encoder implementing arithmetic encoding.<br>
When compared to Fig. 1, the output of the device in Fig.<br>
3A is the side information such as li for one original<br>
channel (corresponding to the side information for B at the<br>
output of device 140f). The entropy encoded bitstream for<br>
channel A corresponds to e.g. the encoded left downmix<br>
channel Lc' at the output of block 16 in Fig. 1. From Fig.<br>
3A it becomes clear that element 14 (Fig. 1), i.e., the<br>
calculator for calculating the channel side information and<br>
the audio encoder 16 (Fig. 1) can be implemented as sepa-<br>
rate means or can be implemented as a shared version such<br>
that both devices share several elements such as the MDCT<br><br>
filter bank 140a, the quantizer 140e and the entropy en-<br>
coder 140g. Naturally, in case one needs a different trans-<br>
form etc. for determining the channel side information,<br>
then the encoder 16 and the calculator 14 (Fig. 1) will be<br>
implemented in different devices such that both elements do<br>
not share the filter bank etc.<br>
Generally, the actual determinator for calculating the side<br>
information (or generally stated the calculator 14) may be<br>
implemented as a joint stereo module as shown in Fig.3B,<br>
which operates in accordance with any of the joint stereo<br>
techniques such as intensity stereo coding or binaural cue<br>
coding.<br>
In contrast to such prior art intensity stereo encoders,<br>
the inventive determination means 140f does not have to<br>
calculate the combined channel. The "combined channel" or<br>
carrier channel, as one can say, already exists and is the<br>
left compatible downmix channel Lc or the right compatible<br>
downmix channel Rc or a combined version of these downmix<br>
channels such as Lc + Rc. Therefore, the inventive device<br>
140f only has to calculate the scaling information for<br>
scaling the respective downmix channel such that the en-<br>
ergy/time envelope of the respective selected original<br>
channel is obtained, when the downmix channel is weighted<br>
using the scaling information or, as one can say, the in-<br>
tensity directional information.<br>
Therefore, the joint stereo module 140f in Fig 3B is illus-<br>
trated such that it receives, as an input, the "combined"<br>
channel A, which is the first or second downmix channel or<br>
a combination of the downmix channels, and the original se-<br>
lected channel. This module, naturally, outputs the "com-<br><br>
bined" channel A and the joint stereo parameters as channel<br>
side information such that, using the combined channel A<br>
and the joint stereo parameters, an approximation of the<br>
original selected channel B can be calculated.<br>
Alternatively, the joint stereo module 140f can be imple-<br>
mented for performing binaural cue coding.<br>
In the case of BCC, the joint stereo module 140f is opera-<br>
tive to output the channel side information such that the<br>
channel side information are quantized and encoded ICLD or<br>
ICTD parameters, wherein the selected original channel<br>
serves as the actual to be processed channel, while the re-<br>
spective downmix channel used for calculating the side in-<br>
formation, such as the first, the second or a combination<br>
of the first and second downmix channels is used as the<br>
reference channel in the sense of the BCC coding/decoding<br>
technique.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, a simple energy-directed implementa-<br>
tion of element 140f is given. This device includes a fre-<br>
quency band selector 44 selecting a frequency band from<br>
channel A and a corresponding frequency band of channel B.<br>
Then, in both frequency bands, an energy is calculated by<br>
means of an energy calculator 42 for each branch. The de-<br>
tailed implementation of the energy calculator 42 will de-<br>
pend on whether the output signal from block 40 is a sub-<br>
band signal or are frequency coefficients. In other imple-<br>
mentations, where scale factors for scale factor bands are<br>
calculated, one can already use scale factors of the first<br>
and second channel A, B as energy values EA and EB or at<br>
least as estimates of the energy. In a gain factor calcu-<br>
lating device 44, a gain factor gB for the selected fre-<br><br>
quency band is determined based on a certain rule such as<br>
the gain determining rule illustrated in block 44 in Fig.<br>
4. Here, the gain factor gB can directly be used for<br>
weighting time domain samples or frequency coefficients<br>
- such as will be described later in Fig. 5. To this end, the<br>
gain factor gB, which is valid for the selected frequency<br>
band is used as the channel side information for channel B<br>
as the selected original channel. This selected original<br>
channel B will not be transmitted to decoder but will be<br>
' represented by the parametric channel side information as<br>
calculated by the calculator 14 in Fig. 1.<br>
It is to be noted here that it is not necessary to transmit<br>
gain values as channel side information. It is also suffi-<br>
cient to transmit frequency dependent values related to the<br>
absolute energy of the selected original channel. Then, the<br>
decoder has to calculate the actual energy of the downmix<br>
channel and the gain factor based on the downmix channel<br>
energy and the transmitted energy for channel B.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a possible implementation of a decoder set up<br>
in connection with a transform-based perceptual audio en-<br>
coder. Compared to Fig. 2, the functionalities of the en-<br>
tropy decoder and inverse quantizer 50 (Fig. 5) will be in-<br>
cluded in block 24 of Fig. 2. The functionality of the fre-<br>
quency/time converting elements 52a, 52b (Fig. 5) will,<br>
however, be implemented in item 36 of Fig. 2. Element 50 in<br>
Fig. 5 receives an encoded version of the first or the sec-<br>
ond downmix signal Lc' or Re'. At the output of element 50,<br>
an at least partly decoded version of the first and the<br>
second downmix channel is present which is subsequently<br>
called channel A. Channel A is input into a frequency band<br>
selector 54 for selecting a certain frequency band from<br><br>
channel A. This selected frequency band is weighted using a<br>
multiplier 56. The multiplier 56 receives, for multiplying,<br>
a certain gain factor gB, which is assigned to the selected<br>
frequency band selected by the frequency band selector 54,<br>
which corresponds to the frequency band selector 40 in Fig.<br>
4 at the encoder side. At the input of the frequency time<br>
converter 52a, there exists, together with other bands, a<br>
frequency domain representation of channel A. At the output<br>
of multiplier 56 and, in particular, at the input of fre-<br>
quency/time conversion means 52b there will be a recon-<br>
structed frequency domain representation of channel B.<br>
Therefore, at the output of element 52a, there will be a<br>
time domain representation for channel A, while, at the<br>
output of element 52b, there will be a time domain repre-<br>
sentation of reconstructed channel B.<br>
It is to be noted here that, depending on the certain im-<br>
plementation, the decoded downmix channel Lc or Rc is not<br>
played back in a multi-channel enhanced decoder. In such a<br>
multi-channel enhanced decoder, the decoded downmix chan-<br>
nels are only used for reconstructing the original chan-<br>
nels. The decoded downmix channels are only replayed in<br>
lower scale stereo-only decoders.<br>
To this end, reference is made to Fig. 9, which shows the<br>
preferred implementation of the present invention in a sur-<br>
round/mp3 environment. An mp3 enhanced surround bitstream<br>
is input into a standard mp3 decoder 24, which outputs de-<br>
coded versions of the original downmix channels. These<br>
downmix channels can then be directly replayed by means of<br>
a low level decoder. Alternatively, these two channels are<br>
input into the advanced joint stereo decoding device 32<br>
which also receives the multi-channel extension data, which<br><br>
are preferably input into the ancillary data field in a mp3<br>
compliant bitstream.<br>
Subsequently, reference is made to Fig. 7 showing the<br>
 grouping of the selected original channel and the respec-<br>
tive downmix channel or combined downmix channel. In this<br>
regard, the right column of the table in Fig. 7 corresponds<br>
to channel A in Fig. 3A, 3B, 4 and 5, while the column in<br>
the middle corresponds to channel B in these figures. In<br>
the left column in Fig. 7, the respective channel side in-<br>
formation is explicitly stated. In accordance with the Fig.<br>
7 table, the channel side information li for the original<br>
left channel L is calculated using the left downmix channel<br>
Lc. The left surround channel side information lsi is de-<br>
termined by means of the original selected left surround<br>
channel Ls and the left downmix channel Lc is the carrier.<br>
The right channel side information ri for the original<br>
right channel R are determined using the right downmix<br>
channel Rc. Additionally, the channel side information for<br>
the right surround channel Rs are determined using the<br>
right downmix channel Rc as the carrier. Finally, the chan-<br>
nel side information ci for the center channel C are deter-<br>
mined using the combined downmix channel, which is obtained<br>
by means of a combination of the first and the second down-<br>
mix channel, which can be easily calculated in both an en-<br>
coder and a decoder and which does not require any extra<br>
bits for transmission.<br>
Naturally, one could also calculate the channel side infor-<br>
mation for the left channel e. g. based on a combined down-<br>
mix channel or even a downmix channel, which is obtained by<br>
a weighted addition of the first and second downmix chan-<br>
nels such as 0.7 Lc and 0.3 Rc, as long as the weighting<br><br>
parameters are known to a decoder or transmitted accord-<br>
ingly. For most applications, however, it will be preferred<br>
to only derive channel side information for the center<br>
channel from the combined downmix channel, i.e., from a<br>
combination of the first and second downmix channels.<br>
To show the bit saving potential of the present invention,<br>
the following typical example is given. In case of a five<br>
channel audio signal, a normal encoder needs a bit rate of<br>
64 kbit/s for each channel amounting to an overall bit rate<br>
of 320 kbit/s for the five channel signal. The left and<br>
right stereo signals require a bit rate of 128 kbit/s.<br>
Channels side information for one channel are between 1.5<br>
and 2 kbit/s. Thus, even in a case, in which channel side<br>
information for each of the five channels are transmitted,<br>
this additional data add up to only 7.5 to 10 kbit/s. Thus,<br>
the inventive concept allows transmission of a five channel<br>
audio signal using a bit rate of 138 kbit/s (compared to<br>
320 (!) kbit/s) with good quality, since the decoder does<br>
 not use the problematic dematrixing operation. Probably<br>
even more important is the fact that the inventive concept<br>
is fully backward compatible, since each of the existing<br>
mp3 players is able to replay the first downmix channel and<br>
the second downmix channel to produce a conventional stereo<br>
 output.<br>
Depending on the application environment, the inventive<br>
methods for constructing or generating can be implemented<br>
in hardware or in software. The implementation can be a<br>
digital storage medium such as a disk or a CD having elec-<br>
tronically readable control signals, which can cooperate<br>
with a programmable computer system such that the inventive<br>
methods are carried out. Generally stated, the invention<br><br>
therefore, also relates to a computer program product hav-<br>
ing a program code stored on a machine-readable carrier,<br>
the program code being adapted for performing the inventive<br>
methods, when the computer program product runs on a com-<br>
puter. In other words, the invention, therefore, also re-<br>
lates to a computer program having a program code for per-<br>
forming the methods, when the computer program runs on a<br>
computer.<br><br>
