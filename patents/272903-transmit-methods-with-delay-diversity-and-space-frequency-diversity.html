BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods to transmit signal by using delay<br>
diversity and space frequency diversity.<br>

A typical cellular radio system includes a number of fixed base stations<br>
and a number of mobile stations. Each base station covers a geographical area,<br>
which is defined as a cell.<br>
Typically, a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) radio propagation path exists<br>
between a base station and a mobile station due to natural and man-made objects<br>
disposed between the base station and the mobile station. As a consequence,<br>
radio waves propagate while experiencing reflections, diffractions and scattering.<br>
The radio wave which arrives at the antenna of the mobile station in a downlink<br>
direction, or at the antenna of the base station in an uplink direction, experiences<br>
constructive and destructive additions because of different phases of individual<br>
waves generated due to the reflections, diffractions, scattering and out-of-phase<br>
recombination. This is due to the fact that, at high carrier frequencies typically<br>
used in a contemporary cellular wireless communication, small changes in<br>
differential propagation delays introduces large changes in the phases of the<br>
individual waves. If the mobile station is moving or there are changes in the<br>
scattering environment, then the spatial variations in the amplitude and phase of<br>
the composite received signal will manifest themselves as the time variations<br>
known as Rayleigh fading or fast fading attributable to multipath reception. The<br>
time-varying nature of the wireless channel require very high signal-to-noise ratio<br>
(SNR) in order to provide desired bit error or packet error reliability.<br>
The scheme of diversity is widely used to combat the effect of fast fading<br>
by providing a receiver with multiple faded replicas of the same<br>
information-bearing signal.<br>
The schemes of diversity in general fall into the following categories:<br>
space, angle, polarization, field, frequency, time and multipath diversity. Space<br>
diversity can be achieved by using multiple transmit or receive antennas. The<br>
spatial separation between the multiple antennas is chosen so that the diversity<br>
branches, i.e., the signals transmitted from the multiple antennas, experience<br>
fading with little or no correlation. Transmit diversity, which is one type of<br>
space diversity, uses multiple transmission antennas to provide the receiver with<br>
multiple uncorrelated replicas of the same signal. Transmission diversity<br>
schemes can further be divided into open loop transmit diversity and closed-loop<br>
transmission diversity schemes. In the open loop transmit diversity approach no<br>
feedback is required from the receiver. In one type of closed loop transmit<br>
diversity, a receiver knows an arrangement of transmission antennas, computes a<br>
phase and amplitude adjustment that should be applied at the transmitter antennas<br>
in order to maximize a power of the signal received at the receiver. In another<br>
arrangement of closed loop transmit diversity referred to as selection transmit<br>
diversity (STD), the receiver provides feedback information to the transmitter<br>
regarding which antenna(s) to be used for transmission.<br>
Cyclic Delay Diversity (CDD) is a diversity scheme used in OFDM-based<br>
telecommunication systems, transforming spatial diversity into frequency<br>
diversity avoiding inter symbol interference.<br>
The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) contribution R1-072633.<br>
TS 36.211 version 1.1.0, proposed a CDD precoder structure that requires a<br>
Precoder Matrix Indication (PMI) feedback. Also, in the CDD described in TS<br>
36.211 version 1.1.0, the open loop (i.e., large delay) and closed loop (i.e., small<br>
delay CDD) structures are different. It would be better to have one structure for<br>
both open loop and closed loop, by using different values of the precoder. The<br>
two structures are identical for the full rank cases and where the precoder matrix<br>
is an identity matrix. The closed loop structure has no solution for the case<br>
where no PMI is available for the less than full rank case.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an aspect of the present invention to provide improved<br>
methods and apparatus for transmitting signals.<br>
It is another aspect of the present invention to provide an improved open<br>
loop precoder that can be applied to both large delay CDD and small delay CDD<br>
diversity schemes during transmission.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, a plurality of<br>
information bits are encoded, scrambled and modulated to generate a plurality of<br>
modulation symbols. The plurality of modulation symbols are mapped onto the<br>
subcarriers in at least one transmission layer of a transmission resource. The<br>
modulation symbols are then precoded by using a matrix for cyclic delay<br>
diversity and a set of codewords from a certain codebook to generate a plurality<br>
of precoded symbols. The codewords are cycled for every a certain number of<br>
subcarriers. Finally, the precoded symbols are transmitted via a plurality of<br>
transmission antennas.<br>
For large delay CDD, the precoded symbols corresponding to the i-th<br>
subcarrier is:<br>
<br>
where D(i) is a diagonal matrix for supporting small delay cyclic delay<br>
diversity.<br>
For both small delay CDD and large delay CDD, the precoded symbols<br>
corresponding to the i-th subcarrier is:<br>
<br>
where D(i) is a first diagonal matrix for supporting small delay cyclic<br>
delay diversity, and C(i) is a second diagonal matrix for supporting large delay<br>
cyclic delay diversity.<br>
The value q may be equal to 1, or may be equal to the transmission rank,<br>
or may be equal to 12m, where m is a positive integer.<br>
The set of code words may include all of the codewords in the certain<br>
codebook. Alternatively, the set of code words may include a subset of<br>
codewords in the certain codebook.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, a plurality of<br>
information bits are encoded, scrambled and modulated to generate a plurality of<br>
modulation symbols. The plurality of modulation symbols are mapped onto the<br>
subcarriers in at least one transmission layer of a transmission resource. The<br>
mapped symbols are repeatedly precoded and transmitted via a plurality of<br>
antennas by using a matrix for cyclic delay diversity and applying different<br>
codewords for different retransmissions.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention, four symbols to<br>
be transmitted are encoded by using a rank-2 space frequency block code to<br>
generate a rank-2 space frequency block of symbols. Then, the block of<br>
symbols are precoded by using a matrix for cyclic delay diversity and a set of<br>
codewords from a certain codebook to generate a plurality of precoded symbols.<br>
The codewords cycled for every a certain number of subcarriers. Finally, the<br>
precoded symbols are transmitted via a plurality of antennas.<br>
According to still yet another aspect of the present invention, four<br>
symbols to be transmitted are encoded by using a rank-2 space frequency block<br>
code to generate a rank-2 space frequency block of symbols. The block of<br>
symbols are repeatedly precoded and transmitted via a plurality of antennas by<br>
using a matrix for cyclic delay diversity and applying different codewords for<br>
different retransmissions.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, four symbols to be<br>
transmitted are encoded to generate two transmission matrices. The two<br>
transmission matrices T} and T2 are:<br>
<br>
where Tij represents the symbol to be transmitted on the ith antenna and<br>
the jth subcarrier. The four symbols are repeatedly transmitted via four antennas<br>
by alternatively applying the two transmission matrices T1 and T2 in a<br>
frequency domain.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)<br>
transceiver chain. In a communication system using OFDM technology, at<br>
transmitter chain 110, control signals or data 111 is modulated by modulator 112<br>
into a series of modulation symbols, that are subsequently serial-to-parallel<br>
converted by Serial/Parallel (S/P) converter 113. Inverse Fast Fourier Transform<br>
(IFFT) unit 114 is used to transfer the signals from frequency domain to time<br>
domain into a plurality of OFDM symbols. Cyclic prefix (CP) or zero prefix (ZP)<br>
is added to each OFDM symbol by CP insertion unit 116 to avoid or mitigate the<br>
impact due to multipath fading. Consequently, the signal is transmitted by<br>
transmitter (Tx) front end processing unit 117, such as an antenna (not shown), or<br>
alternatively, by fixed wire or cable. At receiver chain 120, assuming perfect time<br>
and frequency synchronization are achieved, the signal received by receiver (Rx)<br>
front end processing unit 121 is processed by CP removal unit 122. Fast Fourier<br>
Transform (FFT) unit 124 transfers the received signal from time domain to<br>
frequency domain for further processing.<br>
The total bandwidth in an OFDM system is divided into narrowband<br>
frequency units called subcarriers. The number of subcarriers is equal to the<br>
FFT/IFFT size N used in the OFDM system. In general, the number of<br>
subcarriers used for data is less than N because some subcarriers at the edge of the<br>
frequency spectrum are reserved as guard subcarriers. In general, no information<br>
is transmitted on guard subcarriers.<br>
In a communication link, a multi-path channel results in a<br>
frequency-selective fading. Moreover, in a mobile wireless environment, the<br>
channel also results in a time-varying fading. Therefore, in a wireless mobile<br>
system employing OFDM based access, the overall system performance and<br>
efficiency can be improved by using, in addition to time-domain scheduling,<br>
frequency-selective multi-user scheduling. In a time-varying frequency-selective<br>
mobile wireless channel, it is also possible to improve the reliability of the<br>
channel by spreading and/or coding the information over the subcarriers.<br>
In case of frequency-selective multi-user scheduling, a contiguous set of<br>
subcarriers potentially experiencing an upfade is allocated for transmission to a<br>
user. The total bandwidth is divided into subbands grouping multiple<br>
contiguous subcarriers as shown in FIG. 2A where subcarriers f1, f2, f3 and f4 are<br>
grouped into a subband for transmission to a user in frequency-selective<br>
multi-user scheduling mode. In case of frequency-diversity transmission,<br>
however, the allocated subcarriers are preferably uniformly distributed over the<br>
whole spectrum. As shown in FIG. 2B, subcarriers f1, f5, f9 and f13 are grouped<br>
into a subband for transmission. The frequency-selective multi-user scheduling<br>
is generally beneficial for low mobility users for which the channel quality can be<br>
tracked. But the channel quality generally can not be tracked for high mobility<br>
users (particularly in a frequency-division-duplex system where the fading<br>
between the downlink and uplink is independent) due to channel quality feedback<br>
delays and hence the frequency diversity transmission mode is preferred.<br>
Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) schemes use multiple transmit<br>
antennas and multiple receive antennas to improve the capacity and reliability of<br>
a wireless communication channel. A MIMO system promises linear increase in<br>
capacity with K where K is the minimum of number of transmit (M) and receive<br>
antennas (N), i.e. K = min (M,N). A simplified example of a 4 x 4 MIMO<br>
system is shown in FIG. 3. In this example, four different data streams are<br>
transmitted separately from the four transmit antennas. The transmitted signals<br>
are received at the four receive antennas. Some form of spatial signal<br>
processing is performed on the received signals in order to recover the four data<br>
streams. An example of spatial signal processing is vertical Bell Laboratories<br>
Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) which uses the successive interference<br>
cancellation principle to recover the transmitted data streams. Other variants of<br>
MIMO schemes include schemes that perform some kind of space-time coding<br>
across the transmit antennas (e.g., diagonal Bell Laboratories Layered<br>
Space-Time (D-BLAST)) and also beamforming schemes such as Spatial<br>
Division multiple Access (SDMA).<br>
The MIMO channel estimation consists of estimating the channel gain and<br>
phase information for links from each of the transmit antennas to each of the<br>
receive antennas. Therefore, the channel for M x N MIMO system consists of an<br>
N x M matrix: <br>
where aij represents the channel gain from transmit antenna j to receive<br>
antenna i. In order to enable the estimations of the elements of the MIMO<br>
channel matrix, separate pilots are transmitted from each of the transmit antennas.<br>
An optional precoding protocol that employs a unitary pre-coding before<br>
mapping the data streams to physical antennas is shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B.<br>
The optional precoding creates a set of virtual antennas (VA) 171 before the<br>
pre-coding. In this case, each of the codewords is potentially transmitted<br>
through all the physical transmission antennas 172. Two examples of unitary<br>
precoding matrices, P1 and P2 for the case of two transmission antennas 172 may<br>
be: <br>
Assuming modulation symbols S1 and S2 are transmitted at a given time<br>
through stream 1 and stream 2 respectively. Then the modulation symbol T1<br>
after precoding with matrix P1 in the example as shown in FIG. 5A and the<br>
modulation symbol T2 after precoding with matrix P2 in the example as shown in<br>
FIG. 5B can be respectively written as:<br>
<br>
transmitted via antenna 1 and antenna 2, respectively, when precoding is done<br>
using precoding matrix P1 as shown in FIG. 4A. Similarly, the symbols<br>
T vill be transmitted via antenna 1 and antenna<br>
2, respectively, when precoding is done using precoding matrix P2 as shown in<br>
FIG. 4B. It should be noted that precoding is done on an OFDM subcarrier level<br>
before the IFFT operation as illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B.<br>
In a pre-coded MIMO system, inverse operations are performed at the<br>
receiver to recover the transmitted symbols. The received symbols are<br>
multiplied with the inverse precoding matrices. The inverse precoding matrices<br>
are given as: <br>
It should be noted that the inverse of a unitary precoding matrix can<br>
simply be obtained by taking the complex conjugate transpose of the pre-coding<br>
matrix. The transmitted symbols are decoded by multiplying the received<br>
symbol vector with the inverse pre-coding matrices. Therefore, the transmitted<br>
symbols are given as:<br>
<br>
A downlink physical channel corresponds to a set of resource elements<br>
carrying information originating from higher layers. First, a plurality of<br>
information bits are coded with a plurality of code words to generate a plurality of<br>
<br>
<br>
We described a precoding approach that applies to both transmit diversity<br>
and MIMO spatial multiplexing. A composite precoder is constructed based on<br>
a unitary precoder such as Fourier matrix precoder multiplied with another<br>
unitary precoder representing a transmit diversity scheme such as cyclic delay-<br>
diversity. It should be noted that the principles of the current invention also<br>
applies to the cases of non-unitary precoding or unitary precoders other than<br>
Fourier matrix precoder.<br>
<br>
Multiple Fourier matrices can be defined by introducing a shift parameter<br>
(g/G) in the Fourier matrix. The entry of the multiple Fourier matrices is given<br>
by:<br>
A set of four 2x2 Fourier matrices can be defined by taking G=4, and g=0.<br>
1, 2 and 3, and are written as:<br>
<br>
A cyclic delay diversity scheme can be implemented in the frequency<br>
domain with a phase shift of e"Plk applied to subcarrier k transmitted from the<br>
i-th transmission antenna. The angle p, is given as:<br>
<br>
where D, is the cyclic delay in samples applied from the i-th antenna. It<br>
should be noted that other functions can be used to derive the frequency domain<br>
phase shift. The phase shift may be kept constant for a group of subcarriers.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6A, phase shift is constant over subband (SB) 1,Q2 is<br>
constant SB2, and so on. It is also possible to allow the phase shift to vary from<br>
one group of subcarriers to the next. As shown in FIG. 6B, the phase shift varies<br>
from 2x/N to 2n over a frequency range from subcarrier 1 to subcarrier 512.<br>
The cyclic delay diversity can be seen as precoding with the following<br>
precoding matrix for the case of four transmission antennas:<br>
<br>
FIG. 7 schematically illustrates a transmitter provided with the CDD<br>
precoding scheme using the above precoding matrix. It can be noted that the<br>
same symbol with antenna and frequency (subcarrier) dependent phase shifts are<br>
transmitted from multiple antenna. No phase shift is applied for the symbol<br>
transmitted from the first antenna.<br>
In 3GPP RANI contribution Rl-073096, "Text Proposal for 36.211<br>
regarding CDD Design", published in June 2007, Orlando, USA, a joint proposal<br>
is depicted that includes both small and large delay CDD.<br>
For zero-delay and small-delay CDD, precoding for spatial multiplexing<br>
shall be performed according to the following equation:<br>
<br>
where the precoding matrix w(i) is of size P x v, P is the number of<br>
antenna ports, v is the number of layers, the matrix D(i) is a diagonal matrix<br>
<br>
Note that these values apply only when transmit diversity is not<br>
configured for transmission rank 1.<br>
For spatial multiplexing, the values of w(i) shall be selected among the<br>
precoder elements in the codebook configured in the Node B and the UE. Node<br>
B can further confine the precoder selection in the UE to a subset of the elements<br>
in the codebook using codebook subset restriction. According to TS 36.211.<br>
version 1.1.0, the configured codebook shall be equal to<br>
Table 2. Note that the number of layers v is equal to the transmission rank p<br>
in case of spatial multiplexing.<br>
<br>
According to TS 36.211, version 8.2.0, For transmission on two antenna<br>
ports, p e {0,l}, the precoding matrix W(i) for zero, small, and large-delay CDD<br>
shall be selected from Table 3 or a subset thereof.<br>
<br>
For transmission on four antenna ports, p e {0,1,2,3}, the precoding matrix<br>
w for zero, small, and large-delay CDD shall be selected from Table 4 or a<br>
subset thereof. The quantity w&gt;s] denotes the matrix defined by the columns<br>
given by the set {.?} from the expression wn = i-2unu"/u"u„ where / is the<br>
4x4 identity matrix and the vector u„ is given by Table 4.<br>
<br>
For large-delay CDD, the precoding for spatial multiplexing shall be<br>
performed according to the following equation:<br>
<br>
where the precoding matrix W{i) is of size Pxu, P is the number of<br>
antenna ports, v is the number of layers, the quantity £)(/) is a diagonal matrix<br>
for support of large cyclic delay diversity, and U is a fixed matrix. The<br>
For spatial multiplexing, the values of w(i) shall be selected among the<br>
precoder elements in the codebook configured in the Node B and the UE. Node<br>
B can further confine the precoder selection in the UE to a subset of the elements<br>
in the codebook using codebook subset restriction. The configured codebook<br>
shall be equal to Table 3 and Table 4. Note that the number of layers v is equal<br>
to the transmission rank p in case of spatial multiplexing.<br>
Furthermore, a codeword cycling method is proposed for the large delay<br>
equation, y(i)= D(i)-W(i)-U . x(i), so that W(i) is cyclically selected as one of<br>
the codeword in either the codebook in Table 3 for two antenna ports, and in<br>
Table 4 for four antenna ports, or a subset of the codebooks. It is proposed that<br>
the codeword changes either every subcarrier, or every v subcarriers, where v is<br>
the transmission rank.<br>
In a first embodiment according to the principles of the present invention,<br>
we propose to perform codeword cycling in the large delay CDD method<br>
y(i) = W(i)-D(i)-U-x(i) for every resource block (RB) or every integer number of<br>
RBs. For LTE system one RB consists of twelve subcarriers. Therefore, the<br>
codeword W(i) is selected according to W(i) = Ck, where k is given by<br>
<br>
non-negative integer and 12 is the number of subcarriers in a RB. Furthermore.<br>
Ck denotes the k-th codeword in the single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) precoding<br>
codebooks defined in Table 3 for two antenna ports, and in Table 4 for four<br>
antenna ports, or a subset thereof, and N is the codebook size or the size of the<br>
subset. Also note that mod(x) is a modulo operation and [x] is a ceiling<br>
operation.<br>
In a second embodiment according to the principles of the present<br>
invention, we propose to perform codeword cycling in the small delay CDD<br>
method y(i)= D(i)-W(i)-x(i) for every q subcarriers. Therefore, the codeword<br>
W(i) is selected according to W(i) = Ck, where k is given by<br>
<br>
non-negative integer. Examples of q value include q = 1, or q - u where v<br>
is the transmission rank, or q = 12m (cycle every m RBs) where m &gt; 0 is a<br>
non-negative number and 12 is the number of subcarriers in a RB. Furthermore.<br>
Ck denotes the k-th codeword in the single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) precoding<br>
codebooks defined in Table 3 for two antenna ports, and in Table 4 for four<br>
antenna ports, or a subset thereof, and N is the codebook size or the size of the<br>
subset. Also note that mod(x) is a modulo operation and [x] is a ceiling<br>
operation.<br>
In a third embodiment according to the principles of the present invention,<br>
we propose to perform codeword cycling in a uniform small and large delay CDD<br>
method as given by:<br>
<br>
Table 6. Therefore, the codeword W(i) is selected according to<br>
w(i) = Ck, where k is given by:<br>
<br>
non-negative integer. Examples of q value include q = 1, or q = v where v<br>
is the transmission rank, or q = 12m (cycle every m RBs) where m&gt;0 is a<br>
non-negative number and 12 is the number of subcarriers in a RB. Furthermore.<br>
Ck denotes the k-th codeword in the single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) precoding<br>
codebooks defined in Table 3 for two antenna ports, and in Table 4 for four<br>
antenna ports, or a subset thereof, and N is the codebook size or the size ot the<br>
subset. Also note that mod(x) is a modulo operation and [x] is a ceiling<br>
operation.<br>
<br>
for uniform small and large delay CDD. Furthermore, we propose to<br>
select these codewords in such a way that Wl{i)=Ck for t = \,...,T, where Q<br>
denotes the k, -th codeword in the codebook of the precoding codebook defined<br>
in Table 3 for two antenna ports, and in Table 4 for four antenna ports, or a subset<br>
thereof, and such that the choice of Ck is independent for each retransmission.<br>
i.e, for the t-th transmission, Q can be any of the N codewords, regardless of<br>
which codeword is used in the previous transmissions. FIG.8 illustrates how the<br>
different codewords are used in different re-transmissions.<br>
In a fifth embodiment according to the principles of the present invention,<br>
we propose to add a pre-coding process, denoted by matrix w(i) where / is the<br>
subcarrier index, at the output of the rank-2 space frequency block code (SFBC)<br>
block given by: <br>
and this precoded rank-2 method is illustrated in FIG. 9. And the overall<br>
transmit signal is given by: <br>
where we used the notation A(i) to emphasize the fact that the rank-2<br>
SFBC transmission matrix is a function of the subcarrier index. That is,<br>
<br>
In addition, note that Sj to S4 are generated from the same codeword.<br>
One way to choose the codeword is to choose the w(i) according to the<br>
precoding matrix index (PMI) in the feedback, and W{i) belongs the codebook<br>
defined in Table 3 for two antenna ports, and in Table 4 for four antenna ports, or<br>
a subset thereof.<br>
Another way to choose the codeword is to choose W(i) as an arbitrary<br>
unitary matrix that varies every q subcarriers, where q &gt; 0 is an arbitrary<br>
non-negative integer. Therefore, the codeword W{i) is selected according to<br>
w{i)=Ck, where k is given by:<br>
<br>
include q = \, or q = o where v is the transmission rank, or q = \2m (cycle<br>
every m RBs) where m&gt;0 is a non-negative number and 12 is the number of<br>
subcarriers in a RB. Furthermore, Ck denotes the k-th codeword in the<br>
single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) precoding codebook defined in Table 3 for two<br>
antenna ports, and in Table 4 for four antenna ports, or a subset thereof, and A'<br>
is the codebook size or the size of the subset. Also note that mod(x) is a<br>
modulo operation and \x~\ is a ceiling operation.<br>
In a sixth embodiment according to the principles of the present invention,<br>
we propose to apply different codewords for different retransmission in a Hybrid<br>
automatic repeat-request (HARQ) system that uses the rank-2 SFBC transmission.<br>
Let there be T re-transmissions in the HARQ system, and let<br>
W\{j\W2{i),---,Wr{i) be the codeword used for these T retransmissions, the<br>
transmit signal for each retransmission is then given by:<br>
<br>
Furthermore, we propose to select these codewords in such a way that<br>
W, (/) =Cki for / = 1,..., T , where Ck denotes the k, -th codeword in the<br>
codebook of the precoding codebook defined in Table 3 for two antenna ports.<br>
and in Table 4 for four antenna ports, or a subset thereof, and such that the choice<br>
of Cki is independent for each retransmission, i.e, for the t-th transmission, Ccan be any of the N codewords, regardless of which codeword is used in the<br>
previous transmissions. FIG. 10 illustrates how the different codewords are used<br>
in different re-transmissions.<br>
In a seventh embodiment according to the principles of the present<br>
invention, we propose a scheme where mapping of symbols to antennas is<br>
changed on repeated symbols as shown in FIG. 11. In this example we assumed<br>
that four symbols 5,, S2, S3 and S4 are transmitted with one repetition over<br>
eight subcarriers, or two groups of subcarriers in two subframes, with four<br>
subcarriers in each group. In the first four subcarriers, symbols S, and S2 are<br>
transmitted on antennas ports ANTO and ANT1, while symbols S^ and S4 are<br>
transmitted on antennas ports ANT2 and ANT3. On repetition in the last four<br>
subcarriers, the symbols 5, and S2 are transmitted on antennas ports ANT2 and<br>
ANT3 while symbols 53 and S4 are transmitted on antennas ports ANTO and<br>
ANT1. This proposed mapping results in greater diversity gain compared to the<br>
transmission where mapping does not change on repetition. This diversity gains<br>
stems from the fact that after one repetition all the four symbols are transmitted<br>
from all the four transmit antennas.<br>
In the proposed mapping scheme, the transmission matrix 7j shown<br>
below is used for initial transmission:<br>
<br>
where T-,j represents symbol transmitted on the ith antenna and the jth<br>
subcarrier ox jth time slot (i=J,2,3,4, j=J,2,3,4) for the case of 4-Tx antennas.<br>
When the same symbols are repeated, a different mapping matrix T2 shown<br>
below is used for transmission:<br>
<br>
Note that the principles of the present invention may be applied to<br>
decoding information received from a transmitter. In this case, since the<br>
selection of precoding matrices is a function of time (subframe number) and<br>
frequency (subcarrier number), the receiver can simply observe the subframe<br>
number and subcarrier number, and use the same function to figure out the<br>
precoder matrix. The dependence of the precoding matrix selection on<br>
frequency is explicit from Equations (13) and (14). The dependence of the<br>
precoding matrix selection on time is explicit in the HARQ transmission scheme.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described in connection<br>
with the preferred embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that<br>
modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
