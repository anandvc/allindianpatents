				<td>Field<br>
The present invention relates to telecommunication technologies, and in<br>
particular, to a method, system and apparatus for collecting user information.<br>
Background<br>
With the popularity of mobile phones, short messages become a means of<br>
information propagation and advertisement.<br>
However, when mobile phone users receive short messages unrelated or<br>
unappealing to them, they tend to delete the short messages almost without browsing<br>
the details of the messages or even complain to operators about the "spam" messages.<br>
This poor targeted push service is costly to the message publisher, and can hardly<br>
solicit pertinent users. Therefore, to achieve a good effect of publishing messages, it<br>
is good for the message publisher to know the interests of users, and publish<br>
messages only to the interested users rather than to all users.<br>
In the current practice, to grasp the interests of users and improve the hit rate<br>
of the published messages, the message publisher distributes questionnaires to the<br>
users, or requests the users to register the relevant information when the users<br>
subscribe to a certain product. The message publisher collects the interests of the<br>
users according to the feedback from the users.<br>
The process of collecting user interests according to the user feedback in the<br>
questionnaire or registration form is inefficient and costly, and could hardly discover<br>
most potential users, and has a low hit rate.<br>
Summary<br>
The embodiments provide a method, system and apparatus for collecting user<br>
information to overcome the inefficiency of collecting user information in the prior<br>
art.<br>
A method for collecting user information provided in an embodiment includes:<br>
matching obtained user message with characteristics of target users, and<br>
determining whether the user meets the characteristics of target users according to<br><br><br>
the match result; and<br>
if the user meets the characteristics of target users, collecting the user<br>
information and saving the user information according to the type of characteristics.<br>
A system for collecting user information provided in an embodiment includes:<br>
a content analyzing unit, adapted to (i) obtain message sent or received by a<br>
user, and characteristics of target users; (ii) match the content of the message with<br>
the characteristics of target users, and determine whether the user meets the<br>
characteristics of target users according to the match result;<br>
a user storage unit, adapted to collect the user information and store the user<br>
information according to the type of characteristics, if the user meets the<br>
characteristics of the target users.<br>
An apparatus for analyzing the content of message in an embodiment includes:<br>
an analyzing unit, adapted to match content of obtained user message with<br>
characteristics of target users, and determine whether the user meets the<br>
characteristics of target users according to the match result; and<br>
a collecting unit, adapted to collect the user information and save the user<br>
information according to the type of characteristics if the user meets the<br>
characteristics of target users.<br>
By analyzing message or messages sent or received by a user, for example the<br>
short messages sent or received by the mobile phone user, it is determined whether<br>
the user is among the target users. Target users may be users to be collected. What<br>
kind of users to be collected may be predetermined by configuring characteristics of<br>
target users, for example information table, key words or table of key words. When<br>
the user meets the characteristics of target users, the user's information may be<br>
collected and saved, thereby improving the efficiency of collecting user information<br>
significantly. To publish messages according to user's interest, users may get what<br>
they are interested in, and message publishers may reduce cost and improve hit rate.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
To improve the efficiency of collecting user information, an exemplary<br>
embodiment provides a system for collecting user information. By analyzing content<br>
of message, for example short messages, emails and instant messages, sent or<br>
received by a user, the system determines whether the user meets characteristic of<br>
target user, and collects the user information if the user meets the characteristic.<br>
Short message is taken an example for describing the following embodiments. Based<br>
on these embodiments, the skilled person in the art can infer the processing of other<br>
messaging services such as email and instant messaging with similar way of short<br>
message. So other message service wouldn't be described in details.<br>
The characteristic may be predetermined by configuration of computer system<br>
or input at any time. The system may determine whether the user meets a plurality of<br>
characteristics of target users, and collects the user information if the user meets the<br>
characteristics.<br>
The system for collecting user information provided in an embodiment is<br>
described below with reference to Error! Reference source not found..<br>
The system for collecting user information provided in an embodiment includes<br>
a content analyzing unit 200 and a user storage unit 300.<br>
The content analyzing unit 200 is adapted to (i) obtain short message or<br>
messages sent or received by a user, and characteristics of target user; (ii) match the<br>
content of the short message with the characteristics of target user, and determine<br>
whether the user meets the characteristics of target user according to the match result;<br>
and (iii) collect the user information and save the user information into the user<br>
storage unit 300 if the user meets the characteristics of target users.<br><br>
The matching process may be either of the following:<br>
(i) the system matches one short message sent or received by a user with<br>
characteristics of target users, and, if the matching succeeds, determines that the user<br>
meets the characteristics of target users; and (ii) the system matches a plurality of<br>
short messages sent or received by a user with the characteristics of target user, and<br>
determines that the user meets the characteristics of target users if: (a) all short<br>
messages match the characteristics of target user; or (b) more than a predetermined<br>
quantity of short messages match the characteristics of target users; or either (a) or (b)<br>
may happen during a time period that the plurality of short messages may be sent or<br>
received by the user. The time period may be predetermined or configured by a unit<br>
or controlled manually. The preceding embodiment is also applicable to the<br>
messaging services such as email and instant messaging.<br>
The collected user information includes but is not limited to: user identifier,<br>
number, user location, user profile and/or data that may identify a user.<br>
The user storage unit 300 is adapted to store the user information according to<br>
the type of characteristics.<br>
"Storing user information according to the type of characteristics" may mean<br>
storing the user information as a type user that meets the characteristics of target<br>
users. The user information may be stored in the following two ways: (i) datasheets<br>
of different user characteristics may be stored in the user storage unit 300, the<br>
datasheets may be identified by a keyword that represents the user characteristics,<br>
and the user information is stored into the datasheet corresponding to the<br>
characteristics that the user information meets; or (ii) storing the user information<br>
and the corresponding keyword that exists in the characteristics of target users.<br>
The system for collecting user information provided in an embodiment may<br>
further include a user characteristics unit 100, adapted to save the characteristics<br>
information of target users.<br>
The user characteristics unit 100 may include a characteristics collection<br>
interface unit 102, an associated content storage unit 104, a match condition<br>
generating unit 106, and a match condition storage unit 108.<br>
The characteristics collection interface unit 102 is adapted to receive an input<br>
keyword that represents the characteristics of target users.<br><br>
The associated content storage unit 104 is adapted to store the keyword and the<br>
corresponding associated words; the keyword and the corresponding associated<br>
words for storage come from the input of the user or other units, where the user<br>
may be a system operator, or an information collector and other units include a<br>
requesting unit that queries user information, for example, a content server.<br>
The match condition generating unit 106 is adapted to (i) search for the<br>
associated words corresponding to the keyword that represents the characteristics of<br>
target users in the associated content storage unit 104; (ii) if any associated word is<br>
found, save the keyword and the associated word into the match condition storage<br>
unit 108 as characteristics of target users; (iii) or, if no associated word is found,<br>
save the keyword that represents the characteristics of target users into the match<br>
condition storage unit 108 as characteristics of target users.<br>
The match condition storage unit 108 is adapted to store the characteristics of<br>
target users.<br>
The content analyzing unit 200 may include an obtaining unit , an analyzing<br>
unit and a collecting unit.<br>
The obtaining unit is an optional unit, adapted to obtain the short messages sent<br>
or received by a user, and the characteristics of target users.<br>
The analyzing unit is adapted to match the content of the short messages with<br>
the characteristics of target users, and determine whether the user meets the<br>
characteristics of target users according to the match result. The analyzing unit may<br>
match the Unicode of the word contained in the short messages with the Unicode of<br>
the keyword and/or associated word in the characteristics of target users. If the<br>
matching succeeds, that is, the Unicode of the word contained in the short messages<br>
includes the Unicode of the keyword and/or associated word in the characteristics of<br>
target users, the analyzing unit determines that the user meets the characteristics of<br>
target users; otherwise, the analyzing unit determines that the user does not meet the<br>
characteristics of target users. The foregoing embodiments are also applicable to the<br>
messaging services such as email and instant messaging.<br>
The collecting unit is adapted to collect the user information and save the user<br>
information if the user meets the characteristics of target users.<br>
The content analyzing unit 200 may also be adapted to output and save the<br><br>
short message and the keyword corresponding to the short message. The keyword<br>
corresponding to the short message is the keyword in the characteristics of target<br>
users. The content analyzing unit 200 may output and save the short message and the<br>
corresponding keyword into a match information table. This match information table<br>
may be stored in the content analyzing unit 200, associated word analysis unit 400 or<br>
any other accessible entity. The system may further include an associated word<br>
analysis unit 400, which is adapted to (i) search for a plurality of short messages with<br>
the same keyword in the match information table, a plurality of short messages may<br>
mean at least two short messages; (ii) find the word that recurs in the plurality of<br>
short messages, and (iii) use the recurring word as an associated word corresponding<br>
to the keyword and save it in the associated content storage unit 104.<br>
The match condition generating unit 106 may be adapted to update the<br>
information stored in the match condition storage unit 108 according to the<br>
information in the associated content storage unit 104. The update may be performed<br>
periodically or in real time. When a keyword or an associated word is added in the<br>
associated content storage unit 104, the added content is saved into the match<br>
condition storage unit 108. For example, when a user inputs a keyword "tourism" and<br>
associated word "mountaineer clothes" into the associated content storage unit 104,<br>
the associated content storage unit 104 saves the input content, and sets an add flag<br>
for the input content; then the match condition generating unit 106 updates the<br>
content with an add flag in the associated content storage unit 104 into the match<br>
condition storage unit 108. In another example, the associated word analysis unit 400<br>
finds the word "skiing kit" associated with the keyword "tourism" by analyzing the<br>
short message content in the match information table, and inputs "skiing kit" into the<br>
associated content storage unit 104; the associated content storage unit 104 saves the<br>
input content as a word associated with the keyword "tourism", and sets a refresh<br>
flag for the input content; then the match condition generating unit 106 updates the<br>
content with a refresh flag in the associated content storage unit 104 into the match<br>
condition storage unit 108.<br>
The system may further include: a message storage unit 500, adapted to obtain<br>
short messages or messages sent or received by the user from the short message<br>
service center (SMSC) or other message service center, and save the obtained short<br><br>
messages or messages. Therefore, the content analyzing unit 200 may obtain the<br>
short messages or messages sent or received by the user from the message storage<br>
unit 500.<br>
The system may further include a result browsing unit 600, adapted to receive<br>
an external query request, search user storage unit 300. . The user storage unit 300<br>
may stores user information according to the type of characteristics of target users.<br>
The result browsing unit 600 searches the user storage unit 300 for the user<br>
information that meets the characteristics in the query request, and provide the user<br>
information obtained. The way of providing the user information obtained may be: (i)<br>
outputting and displaying the user information obtained for query requester to<br>
browse; or (ii) sending the user information obtained to the query requester through a<br>
message. Further, if no user information that meets the characteristics in the query<br>
request is found from the saved user information, the result browsing unit 600 may<br>
temporarily obtain the short messages sent and/or received by the user, and match the<br>
obtained short messages with the user characteristics, for example, keyword and/or<br>
associated word input by the query requester, and provide the user information<br>
corresponding to the successfully matched short messages for the query requester.<br>
By analyzing the short messages or messages sent or received by a user, for<br>
example the short messages sent or received by the mobile phone user, it is<br>
determined whether the user is among the target users. Target users may be users to<br>
be collected. What kind of users to be collected may be predetermined by<br>
configuring characteristics of target users, for example information table, key words<br>
or table of key words. When the user meets the characteristics of target users, the<br>
user's.information may be collected and saved, thereby improving the efficiency of<br>
collecting user information significantly.<br>
A person of ordinary skill in the art could anticipate that the units in the<br>
foregoing embodiments can be grouped or combined with each other. The name of<br>
the units may be changed, but the changes are still covered in the scope of this<br>
disclosure.<br>
As shown in Error! Reference source not found., a method for collecting user<br>
information provided in an embodiment includes:<br>
Step 900: obtaining messages sent or received by a user, and saved<br><br>
characteristics of target users. The message may be short message or messages or<br>
instant message or email.<br>
The characteristics of target users may be generated in the following way:<br>
Receiving a keyword for representing the characteristics of target users input<br>
by an external application; among the saved keywords and associated words,<br>
searching for the associated word corresponding to the keyword that represents the<br>
characteristics of target users; if the associated word is found, saving the keyword<br>
and the found associated word as characteristics of target users; or, if no associated<br>
word is found, saving the keyword that represents the characteristics of target users<br>
as characteristics of target users. The saved keywords and associated words may<br>
derive from input of users such as a system operator or an information collector. In<br>
addition, when a keyword and its associated word changes, for example, a new<br>
associated word is added for a keyword, the saved characteristics of target users may<br>
be updated according to the new associated word. Therefore, the characteristics also<br>
include the new associated word to improve the match rate and collect more user<br>
information that meets the characteristics.<br>
Alternatively, the keyword input by an external application may be used as<br>
characteristics of target users directly.<br>
Step 902: Matching the content of the short messages with the characteristics<br>
of target users, and determining whether the user meets the characteristics of target<br>
users according to the match result.<br>
The implementation modes may be as follows:<br>
If the characteristics of target users are represented by a keyword and the<br>
associated word corresponding to the keyword, the system checks whether a short<br>
message contains one or more words that match the keyword or the associated word<br>
by analyzing the content of the short messages . If so, it is determined that the user<br>
meets the characteristics of target users. In the implementation, the system stores the<br>
Unicode of the keyword and/or the associated word in the characteristics of target<br>
users in the form of a Hash table; by searching the Hash table, the system matches<br>
the Unicode of the word included in a short message with the Unicode of the<br>
keyword and/or associated word in the characteristics of target users, and checks<br>
whether the Unicode of the word included in the short message includes the Unicode<br><br>
of the keyword and/or the associated word in the characteristics of target users. If so,<br>
the system determines that the user meets the characteristics of target users;<br>
otherwise, the system determines that the user does not meet the characteristics of<br>
target users. The search of a Hash table is efficient. Therefore, it is practicable to<br>
match every short message. Considering the request of short message processing<br>
capability, multiple threads can be set up to handle multiple short messages<br>
simultaneously.<br>
Step 904: Collecting the user information and saving the user information<br>
according to the type of characteristics if the user meets the characteristics of target<br>
users.<br>
When collecting user information, the system may obtain more associated<br>
words from a short message. The process may be as follows:<br>
The system outputs and saves the short message and the keyword<br>
corresponding to the short message, where the keyword corresponding to the short<br>
message is the keyword that the short message successfully matches with and exists<br>
in the characteristics of target users; and the system searches for multiple short<br>
messages with the same successfully matched keyword among the output and saved<br>
short messages, determines the word that recurs in the content of the multiple short<br>
messages, and saves it as a associated word corresponding to the keyword.<br>
An external user sends a query request to the system through a browser or by<br>
other means. The query request carries the characteristics of the user to be queried.<br>
The external user may be an information content provider, a service provider, a<br>
publisher or a system operator. When receiving the query request, the system<br>
searches the saved user information for the user that meets the characteristics carried<br>
in the query request, and provides the found user information. The way of providing<br>
user information may be (i) outputting and displaying the found user information for<br>
the query requester to browse; or (ii) sending the found user information to the query<br>
requester through a message. Further, if no user information that meets the<br>
characteristics included in the query request is found from the saved user information,<br>
the system may temporarily obtain the short messages, and match the obtained short<br>
messages with the characteristics, and provide the user information corresponding to<br>
the successfully matched short messages to the query requester. The foregoing<br><br>
process is also applicable to the messaging services such as email and instant<br>
messaging.<br>
A method for collecting user information provided in an embodiment, which is<br>
also shown in Figure 3, may include:<br>
Step 910: matching obtained user message with characteristics of target users,<br>
and determining whether the user meets the characteristics of target users according<br>
to the match result;<br>
Step 912: if the user meets the characteristics of target users, collecting the<br>
user information and saving the user information according to the type of<br>
characteristics.<br>
An embodiment is described below, using short messages as an example, with<br>
reference to Figure 4..<br>
S01: The characteristics collection interface unit receives a keyword input by<br>
an external user for representing the characteristics of target users, and sends the<br>
keyword to the match condition generating unit.<br>
S02-S03: The match condition generating unit obtains the associated word<br>
corresponding to the keyword from the associated content storage unit.<br>
S04: The match condition generating unit saves the keyword and associated<br>
word into the match condition storage unit as characteristics of target users.<br>
S05-S06: The content analyzing unit reads the characteristics of target users<br>
from the match condition storage unit.<br>
S07: The content analyzing unit matches a short message sent or received by a<br>
user with the read characteristics of target users, and checks whether the content of<br>
the short message includes the keyword and/or the associated word contained in the<br>
characteristics of target users. If so, the content analyzing unit determines that the<br>
user meets the characteristics of target users; otherwise, the content analyzing unit<br>
determines that the user does not meet the characteristics of target users.<br>
S08: The content analyzing unit outputs and saves the user information that<br>
meets the characteristics of target users and the corresponding keyword into the user<br>
storage unit.<br>
S09: Upon receiving a query request from an information publisher, where the<br>
query request carries a keyword that represents the characteristics of the user to be<br><br>
queried, the result browsing unit searches the user storage unit for the user<br>
information corresponding to the keyword.<br>
S10: The result browsing unit displays the found user information.<br>
In the foregoing embodiment, the content analyzing unit outputs user<br>
information and the corresponding characteristics. It may also output and save the<br>
analyzed short messages and the corresponding keywords into the match information<br>
table so that the associated word analysis unit can update the information saved in<br>
the associated content storage unit according to the match information table. As<br>
shown in Figure 5, the process is described below..<br>
S11: The characteristics collection interface unit receives a keyword input by<br>
an external user for representing the characteristics of target users, and sends the<br>
keyword to the match condition generating unit.<br>
S12-S13: The match condition generating unit obtains the associated word<br>
corresponding to the keyword from the associated content storage unit.<br>
S14: The match condition generating unit saves the keyword and the associated<br>
word into the match condition storage unit as characteristics of target users.<br>
S15-S16: The content analyzing unit reads the characteristics of target users<br>
from the match condition storage unit.<br>
S17: The content analyzing unit matches a short message sent or received by a<br>
user with the read characteristics of target users, and checks whether the content of<br>
the short message includes the keyword and/or the associated word contained in the<br>
characteristics of target users. If so, the content analyzing unit determines that the<br>
user meets the characteristics of target users; otherwise, the content analyzing unit<br>
determines that the user does not meet the characteristics of target users.<br>
S18: The content analyzing unit outputs and saves the user information that<br>
meets the characteristics of target users and the corresponding keyword into the user<br>
storage unit.<br>
S19: The content analyzing unit saves the short message and the keyword into<br>
the match information table.<br>
S20-S21: The associated word analysis unit reads multiple short messages with<br>
the same keyword in the match information table.<br>
S22: The associated word analysis unit analyzes multiple short messages, and<br><br>
