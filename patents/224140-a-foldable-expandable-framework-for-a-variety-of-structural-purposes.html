				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is in the area of structures and enclosures, including<br>
frameworks, and pertains more particularly to a foldable, expandable framework that<br>
is easily portable, and can be used as the skeleton of a broad variety of structures of<br>
different sorts.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is broadly recognized that human beings have created a broad variety of<br>
structures for such as protection from the elements, storage of tools, travel on bodies<br>
of water and the like. Typically such human-built structures have a framework and<br>
covering elements over the framework. The framework provides shape and strength,<br>
and the covering elements close openings between framing elements to provide<br>
protection, for example, to persons or items within the structures, and support, for<br>
example, roofs, walls and floors.<br>
Human-made structures as defined above include, for example, conventional<br>
frame houses, the framework for which is typically a matrix of interconnected beams<br>
and boards, and the covering elements for which may take a variety of forms, such as<br>
clapboards, bricks or stones, tile (roofs), plywood panels, and the like. Such<br>
structures also include, for example, high-rise buildings, which typically have a<br>
framework of steel beams and a covering of wall, roof, ceiling and floor elements.<br>
Framed structures in the sense meant here also includes those with the capacity to<br>
contain forces from within, for example silos, concrete forms and tanks, as well as to<br>
resist forces from the outside, which may include not only the elements which land<br>
based shelters afford, but also water in the manner of boat or ship hulls. Other kinds<br>
of structures include portable units like tents, the framework for which may be inter-<br>
connectable rods and bars, and the coverings for which may be fabric units. Such<br>
portable units are designed typically such that the coverings, which may broadly be<br>
termed skins, may be removed and the frameworks dismantled or even folded up into<br>
a smaller package for transport and storage. Framed structures in the admittedly broad<br>
sense intended herein further includes those required to support little more than their<br>
own weight and stand against the wind, for example towers, antennae, wings, fins, or<br>
airfoils. Also included among framed structures are those with the capacity to rotate<br>
or roll, for instance, turntables, carousels, turbines, propellers, and (most<br>
fundamentally) wheels. Many types of farm, ranching, fishing, warehousing,<br>
containerizing, palletizing, road-building, shipping, airborne and mining equipment<br>
and machinery utilize framed structures within the meaning of phrase intended here,<br>
to give but several examples. Whilst some framed structures provide protection or<br>
containment from all directions, others may be intended to bear loads and/or protect<br>
against the elements primarily from above or below, for example canopies, decks,<br>
scaffolds, piers, docks, quays, rafts, and broadly speaking, platforms of all kinds.<br>
As the human population becomes more numerous and mobile, and as<br>
experience has been gained in mass production techniques, it has been recognized that<br>
standardization provides cost benefits and expanded use, and it is clear that inventions<br>
that increase standardization, lower cost, and expand use for structures for human<br>
purposes are clearly needed. It is also clear that portability is important for structures<br>
of many sorts, and an improvement in characteristics of portability for structures is<br>
almost always desirable.<br>
Summary of the Inyention<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention a foldable, deployable<br>
framework for a structure is provided, comprising a lower hub having a first central<br>
axis, a set of three or more equal-length tracks each having a first track end pivotally<br>
attached to the lower hub such that each track pivots in a separate track plane parallel<br>
to the first axis, a set of three or more masts of equal length the same as or less than<br>
the length of the tracks, the number of masts equal to the number of tracks, each mast<br>
having a first mast end pivotally attached at a second track end, opposite the first track<br>
end, to one of the three tracks such that the masts pivot in planes adjacent to and<br>
parallel to the planes of the attached tracks, a set of three or more rafters of equal<br>
length greater than the length of either masts or tracks, the number of rafters equal to<br>
the number of masts, each rafter having a first rafter end pivotally attached at a second<br>
mast end, opposite the first mast end, to one of the three masts, such that the rafters<br>
pivot in planes adjacent to and parallel to the pivot planes of the attached masts and<br>
tracks, and an upper hub having a second central axis coaxial with the first central axis<br>
of the lower hub, with each rafter pivotally attached to the upper hub in a manner<br>
allowing the rafters to pivot in their respective rafter planes. The framework is<br>
characterized in that the framework deployed has the tracks in a common plane,<br>
substantially orthogonal to the first axis, defining, with the lower hub, a..structure<br>
floor, has the masts each at substantially a right angle to the joined track, adjacent<br>
masts defining structure walls, and the rafters at an obtuse angle to the joined masts<br>
such that the axes of the upper and lower hubs remain coaxial, the rafters and upper<br>
hub defining a structure roof.<br>
In preferred embodiments the framework when folded comprises a package<br>
with the upper and lower hubs at a first and a second opposite end of the package,<br>
spaced apart by the length of a rafter, the rafter length being the longest of the rafter,<br>
mast or track length, with each set of joined rafters, masts, and tracks folded side by<br>
side within the package defined by the size of the upper and lower hubs and the length<br>
of the rafters. In some preferred embodiments as well, the framework when deployed<br>
further comprises hub-to-track locking elements to lock the tracks and lower hub into<br>
a common plane. The hub-to-track locking elements may constitute at least one<br>
flange to which both tracks and lower hub may be affixed. There may also be two<br>
flanges translatable to clamp tracks and hubs in a common plane.<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the invention the deployed framework<br>
further comprises locking elements to lock each set of joined track and mast into a<br>
right-angle relationship. These locking elements may comprise pins passing through<br>
openings in each of joined masts and tracks. In other cases the locking elements may<br>

cases two or more modular structures are joined at different levels with masts of one<br>
or more units at one level joined to masts of one or more units on a different level. In<br>
still other cases two or more structures are joined by overlapping floor area of one<br>
structure with floor area of another structure, and joining the two areas. In still other<br>
cases a maritime unit is provided, wherein two or more of the modular structures are<br>
joined, each having a center post extending below floor level, further comprising a<br>
keel joined to the two or more center posts below floor level, and further comprising<br>
framing elements and skin elements forming a hull.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a foldable framework 100 for a structure<br>
according to a simple and basic embodiment of the present invention. This<br>
framework comprises an upper hub element 102 and a lower hub element 101,<br>
together with a matrix of interconnected flame elements, including four base tracks<br>
103, four masts 104, and four rafters 105. Upper and lower hubs 102 and 101<br>
respectively are identical in this embodiment, but need not be so in all embodiments.<br>
In the simple embodiment shown, tracks 103 are pivotally joined at one end of<br>
each track to lower hub 101 within openings 107 provided for the purpose. The<br>
opposite end of each track 103 is pivotally joined to one end of each mast 104, each of<br>
which is in turn pivotally at the opposite end joined to one end of each rafter 105.<br>
Finally, rafters 105 are pivotally joined at opposite ends to upper hub 102 within<br>
openings 107 in hub 102.<br>
In the embodiment shown the framing elements are arranged with pivots<br>
positioned such that hub 101 and tracks 103 define a horizontal plane, masts 104 are<br>
vertical with regard to their long axes, and rafters 105 define and obtuse angle with<br>
the vertical masts, ending at a peak position for hub 102. Arranged thusly, the<br>
elements provide a structural framework providing for an enclosure with a peaked<br>
roof. For this relationship, it is necessary that rafters 105 be somewhat longer than<br>
masts 104. A fabric cinch belt 108, arranged around the masts and contacting the<br>
masts at a common height in this embodiment provides a restraint such that masts<br>
104 may all be vertical, but cannot each incline away from vertical to the outside of<br>
the enclosure defined by the framework.<br>
Fig. 2 is a plan view of the framework of Fig. 1, looking directly down from<br>
above. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the structure defined has a square footprint, as the<br>
tracks 103 are each of equal length. This is not a requirement for the invention in<br>
general, but is a requirement in some embodiments of the invention. Generally<br>
speaking, if the tracks were not of equal length, the structure defined would have a<br>
footprint of a four-sided polygon, but not either square or rectangular.<br>
Because hubs 102 and 101 are identical in footprint, hub 101 is not seen in the<br>
plan view. Horizontal tracks 103 that join to hub 101 are, however, clearly evident.<br>
Also, cinch 108 is seen as forming a square aspect in Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 3 is a section view of the framework of Figs. 1 and 2 along section line 3-<br>
3 of Fig. 2 in the direction of the arrows. It should be clear at this point to the skilled<br>
artisan that there may be as few as three tracks, masts, and rafters with the two hubs<br>
to form a framework for a structure, and that there may theoretically be any larger<br>
number of each, with a practical upper limit in terms of space and complexity. For<br>
example, a framework with ten of each of tracks, masts, and rafters will provide for a<br>
ten-sided structure, but at some point the structure becomes somewhat unwieldy. The<br>
four-sided structure shown, however, has some advantages for description. It will<br>
become clear below that there are some good reasons for more than four sides, such as<br>
five to eight sides, for example.<br>
As seen in Fig. 3, with tracks 103 horizontal, masts 104 vertical, and rafters<br>
105 at an angle to horizontal or vertical and supporting hub 102 at a higher position<br>
than the junctions between the masts and the rafters, the shape defined is quite similar<br>
to the well-known shape of a house or shed, having vertical walls and a sloping roof<br>
line. Cinch 108 provides constraint dis-allowing independent movement of masts 104<br>
to other than a vertical aspect with the influence of the downward urging of the weight<br>
of rafters 105 and hub 102.<br>
The skilled artisan, by considering Fig. 3, will see that stability of the structure<br>
will be enhanced by a wider cinch 108, and by joints between the rafters, masts, and<br>
tracks having close tolerance. In some embodiments there will be brackets for<br>
enhancing stability at joints, such as bracket 401 shown in Fig. 4. Bracket 401 in this<br>
example has holes for conventional screw-type fasteners, but there are a variety of<br>
ways such brackets may be implemented, such as with clamping elements for quick<br>
changing. Another way stability may be enhanced is by providing locking holes 402<br>
through one member and into another at the position desired, so a pin may be inserted<br>
when the structure is erected, preventing further rotation of a joint. There are many<br>
such possibilities.<br>
Figs. 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are views along the aspect of Fig. 3 at a sequence of<br>
folded conditions of the framework, illustrating a process of folding the framework<br>
into a much smaller aspect for storage and/or transport.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a first step wherein cinch 108 has been removed, and hub 102 is<br>
raised to a point where rafters 105 and masts 104 are colinear, while tracks 103<br>
remain horizontal. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, the elements before and<br>
behind hubs 101 and 102 are not shown in this and following figures, leaving the<br>
opposing elements to the right and left to illustrate the principles. The action of the<br>
opposing elements before and behind is the same as the elements illustrated.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a next step wherein the joints between rafters and masts arc<br>
further rotated such that the masts may be further folded toward hub 101, drawing the<br>
rafters along.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a next step wherein masts 104 are folded further down to be<br>
horizontal adjacent to tracks 103 to which each is pivotally connected. In this<br>
particular embodiments the tracks and the masts are all of the same length, so the ends<br>
of masts 104 which are pivotally connected to rafters 105 tuck into openings 107 (see<br>
Fig. 1) immediately adjacent to tracks 103. This condition of folding causes rafters<br>
105 to become vertically oriented and entirely within the bounds of the two hubs 101<br>
and 102.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a final folding step wherein the side-by-side tracks and masts<br>
are folded upward to be adjacent to the vertical rafters 105 to which each set is<br>
connected, and all elements are, at this point, entirely within a boundary defined by<br>
the footprint of the hubs and the length of the rafters.<br>
At this point it will be clear to the skilled artisan that the folded framework<br>
occupies a considerably reduced volume compared to the fully-deployed framework,<br>
and the folded framework is much more easily portable and storable. The folded<br>
framework may be bound around the outside by cinches or straps or may be inserted<br>
into a carrier bag or the like for transport and storage. Other components, such as<br>
brackets, cinches and the like may be stored in the same package or bag as the folded<br>
framework, to be easily accessible for re-erection.<br>
Referring now back to Fig. 1, which shows a framework deployed to be a<br>
frame for a structure, it is clear that the deployed framework may be deployed by<br>
reversing the steps of folding, starting from the folded package of Fig. 8. In some<br>
embodiments, to provide a. usable structure one must add such as floor and side<br>
panels, or what has previously been termed a skin to the framework However, in some<br>
other embodiments, flexible membranes constituting the eventual ceiling, walls and<br>
floors are provided in the folded unit. In these embodiments, a ready-to-use and in<br>
some instances airtight structure is available as soon as it is erected. The sagging and<br>
the trampoline effect of the flexible 3floor can be reduced and dampened in these<br>
flexible floor embodiments by stays or other stiffeners inserted into the pockets in the<br>
canvass or webbing comprising the floor.<br>
Fig. 9 shows two tracks 103 for a framework according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention that has a hexagonal footprint, and therefore six equally-spaced<br>
tracks 103. Only two of the six tracks are shown in Fig. 9, deployed at an included<br>
angle of sixty degrees, which is full deployment for the hexagonal configuration.<br>
Portions of two masts 104 are shown as well, along with a floor panel 901. Panel 901<br>
has a generally triangular footprint, matching in general each of six identical portions<br>
of a base formed by the six deployed horizontal tracks.<br>
In this particular example panel 901 is supported by about one-half of the<br>
width of each track, and can be affixed to the tracks in any number of ways, such as by<br>
conventional fasteners like screws, or may have, in some embodiments, engaging<br>
elements, such as pins, for engaging the tracks. Also the panel is shown with broken-<br>
out sections to be able to show more of the structure beneath the panel. Such panels<br>
in various different embodiments may be shaped around the masts, and may extend to<br>
the center of the hub 101, to make a complete floor in the deployed framework.<br>
In various embodiments such floor panels may be provided in larger or smaller<br>
pieces than those shown, and may be engageable and fastenable to the extended<br>
framework in a broad variety of ways.<br>
Fig. 10 is a perspective view of an extended framework as seen in Fig. 1,<br>
including a skin 1001 added over the framework to provide an enclosed structure. In<br>
one embodiment skin 1001 is a one-piece skin formed of a conformable material such<br>
as fabric, canvas, for example, which may be folded or rolled when not in use, and<br>
unfolded or unrolled and added over the deployed framework. Such a skin may be<br>
affixed to the framework in any number of ways, or not affixed at all, depending on<br>
necessity and use. As noted previously, in many embodiments skins may be folded<br>
with framework itself, and this is even true for flexible floor skins. The more common<br>
stiff sectional floor panels 901 are seen through the doorway, and would stack rather<br>
than fold when the framework is refolded<br>
In the example shown there is a door having two opposite flaps 1004, such as<br>
may be provided for a tent. In this case the door flaps have zipper closures as is<br>
known in the art. In other embodiments the door may be rigid panels on hinges, with<br>
various types of fasteners and retainers.<br>
In some cases rigid panels 1001, 1003 and 1006 may be separately affixed to<br>
the framework to make a more rigid structure than with the fabric skin. There are<br>
many materials, such as wood and plastic, suitable for such panels. In some cases<br>
similar panels may be affixed to the inside of the deployed framework to make a<br>
double-wall construction, and in some cases insulating material may be added<br>
between the walls. There are many possibilities. In one embodiment a pocket 1005 is<br>
provided in the skin around the lower and outer periphery of the skin. Dry material<br>
like sand, soil or stones may be added to this pocket to provide ballast to make the<br>
structure heavier and more secure against weather phenomena. In some cases the<br>
pocket may be liquid-tight, and may be filled with water or other liquid for the same<br>
purpose.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the folding framework is provided<br>
additionally with slides to allow folding and storage in different ways. Fig. 11 is a<br>
perspective view of a framework 1101 in an alternative embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Framework 1101 has all of the essential parts of the framework of Fig. 1,<br>
and the parts have been similarly numbered as 1101, 1102, etc., to correspond the<br>
parts shown in Fig. 1 and described above.<br>
An important difference between the framework of Fig. 1 and that of Fig. 11 is<br>
that tracks 1103 each are grooved along substantially the entire length. In this<br>
embodiment grooves 1109 pass completely through tracks 1103 so that the pivot<br>
shown as point 1110 at the lower end of mast 1104 and the outer end of track 1103,<br>
may slide along groove 1109 in track 1103 from one position near hub 1101 to<br>
position 1110 shown, where the mast attains a vertical position if the track is<br>
horizontal.<br>
Fig. 12 is a plan view of framework 1110, similar to Fig. 2. As the difference<br>
between the apparatus of Fig. 1 and the apparatus of Fig. 11 is principally the presence<br>
of slides in the tracks, the plan views of the two apparatuses are essentially the same.<br>
Fig. 13 is a section view of the framework of Fig. 12 taken along the section<br>
line 13-13 of Fig. 12. Again, since the two apparatuses are very much alike, these<br>
section views are very similar, except for the presence of the slide groove in elements<br>
103 of the apparatus of Fig. 13.<br>
Fig. 14 illustrates a first step in folding the framework of Fig. 12 for storage or<br>
transport. It should be emphasized that in the folding operation, this is not a point at<br>
which the folding would stop for a next step to begin. Normally folding would<br>
proceed straight though the point shown. The purpose is to illustrate how the folding<br>
process proceeds for the apparatus shown. As can be seen in the figure, the pivot<br>
elements of masts 1104, having been disengaged from any clamps, brackets, and the<br>
like that might be used to keep the lower end of the masts secure at the outer ends of<br>
tracks 1103, are moved inwardly along grooves 1109 in tracks 1103, toward lower<br>
hub 1101. As this movement takes place, the upper assembly comprising rafters 1105<br>
and upper hub 1102 is lowered. It will be clear to the skilled artisan that it not<br>
necessary that all four (two are shown) of the masts be moved and lowered at the<br>
same time, but the apparatus can be restrained to do so.<br>
Fig. 15 illustrates another step in folding the framework of Fig. 12 for storage<br>
or transport. At this point the lower ends of the masts 104 have been moved along<br>
tracks 103 all the way to hub 1101, and now tracks 103 and masts 104 are adjacent<br>
and horizontal. As a result, the upper roof structure comprising the rafters and the<br>
upper hub retain the deployed shape and form, but this portion of the structure is now<br>
at ground line. This has some definite advantages, particularly in the opposite, or<br>
deployment, process. For example, having the roof structure at ground level allows<br>
roof panels or other skin forms to be easily added before the roof is raised to its final<br>
position.<br>
There is a choice to be made at this juncture. The upper hub can be raised<br>
now, keeping the masts and tracks adjacent and aligned, and allowing the mechanism<br>
to pivot at lower hub 1101, at the rafter/mast pivot, and at the upper hub 1102. If this<br>
action is taken to completion and final package has the footprint of the hubs and a<br>
length equal to the sum of the lengths of a rafter and a mast or tracks, assuming that<br>
the masts and tracks are of equal length. It is not necessary that masts and tracks be of<br>
equal length, however. The masts might be shorter than the tracks. But the shape<br>
shown in Fig. 15 cannot be attained if the masts are longer than the tracks.<br>
The other choice, beginning at the point shown in Fig. 15 is to raise the lower<br>
hub 1101, still keeping the masts and tracks adjacent, until the rafters 1105 are vertical<br>
and adjacent the tracks and masts, which will also then be vertical. The two hubs are<br>
then separated by a distance equal to the difference in iength between a rafter and a<br>
mast or track (assuming the two are equal). If the masts are shorter the separation is<br>
the difference between the lengths of a rafter and a track. Fig. 16 illustrates this<br>
condition, which package has the footprint of the hubs and the height (or length, if you<br>
please), of the rafter. This choice produces a final package for storage of exactly the<br>
size of the package formed by folding the apparatus of Fig. 1, except that the package<br>
of Fig. 1 has a hub at each end, which may have some advantage in transport and<br>
storage. So the trade-off is to introduce the further complexity of the grooved tracks<br>
in return for the roof structure being at ground level at one point, allowing skins or<br>
panels to be added before the roof is raised.<br>
It is instructive at this point to provide some dimensional examples. A folding<br>
structure framework might be made, for example, according to the embodiment of<br>
Fig. 1, with two-by-four material for tracks, masts, and rafters. The hubs in this case<br>
can take any one of many forms, but assuming the form and round shape shown in the<br>
embodiments illustrated, the diameter of the hubs is dictated partly by the cross-<br>
section of the linear elements (tracks, masts, and rafters). A two-by four is well-<br>
known to be 1 3/4 inches 3 1/2 inches. The hub, then, has to accommodate, in the<br>
case of a hexagonal embodiment, the cross-sections of eighteen elements. Three<br>
elements side-by-side makes 5 1/4 inches. The circumference of the hub must be<br>
greater than six times this dimension, or 31 1/2 inches. Assume about 36 inches. The<br>
diameter of the hub will be, then, about 12 inches for a hexagonal embodiment using<br>
2x4 members.<br>
Following this example, assume tracks and masts of equal length at 6 feet,<br>
each, and a roof pitch of 30 degrees is desirable. The rafter length for a roof pitch of<br>
30 degrees calculates to about 7 1/2 feet. The resulting structure, fully deployed (see<br>
Fig. 1 or Fig. 11) will be about 13 feet across from flat side to flat side, will be 6 feet<br>
high at the eaves, that is at the masts, and will have a height of about 10.5 feet at the<br>
center. The framework for this structure will fold into a package 7.5 feet long and 1<br>
foot in diameter for transport and storage.<br>
There are many variations in alternative embodiments that may be made by<br>
altering details of the embodiments thus far described. For example, in many<br>
embodiments it is desirable that lower hub 1101 have additional elements to secure<br>
the tracks in horizontal position once deployed. Fig. 17 illustrates a portion of a lower<br>
hub 1101 comprising a lower flange 1701 and restraining clamps 1702 (one only<br>
shown in the figure), implemented such that, with the tracks 1103 deployed<br>
horizontally, clamps 1702 may be imposed over the tracks and secured to hold the<br>
tracks against the flange in a horizontal deployment. The inventor believes that one<br>
only of the clamps and tracks need be shown, as these will be repeated at generally<br>
equally-spaced intervals for frameworks with a plurality of tracks.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 17 a clamp consists of a cross piece and two<br>
slotted screws. It will be evident to the skilled artisan that clamps and other restraints<br>
for holding tracks to hubs when the tracks are deployed may be implemented in a<br>
broad variety of ways. In some cases a simple u-bolt may be used. In others the<br>
tracks may be undercut for the clamp so there will be no protrusion of the clamps<br>
above the track tops to interfere with application of floor panels. In yet other cases<br>
hinged clamps may be used. There are many possibilities. In some cases a second<br>
flange may be employed to overlie the hub after clamps are deployed, and fasteners<br>
may be passed through matching holes in the two flanges to draw the flanges together<br>
to clamp the tracks between the hubs.<br>
Referring now back to Fig. 1 and Fig. 11, it is noted that the tracks, hubs and<br>
rafters are shown as pivoted to one another generally with simple pin joints. In some<br>
alternative embodiments, however, more functional joints are employed providing<br>
sliding relationships as well as pivoting. Fig. 18, for example, illustrates a connection<br>
between a track 1103 and a mast 1104 through a separate compound joint element<br>
1801 that provides for pivoting between the track and the mast, as well as sliding<br>
adjustment along both the track and the mast.<br>
Joint element 1801 in Fig. 18 comprises two connected cylinders 1802 and<br>
1803 that are connected by a pivotal joint along an axis centerline (CL) 1805. This<br>
pivotal joining, with around track 11031nserted through cylinder 1805 and around<br>
mast 1104 inserted through cylinder 1802, provides the same pivotal freedom as<br>
provided in the purely pivotal joints shown between mast and track elements in Fig. 1.<br>
The mast and track may be pivoted with their long axes in parallel planes.<br>
In addition to the pivotal aspect, each of cylinders 1802 and 1803 has a set<br>
screw 1804 in a threaded hole, such that each cylinder may be translated along the<br>
engaged mast or track, and fixed in a desired position. The sliding of cylinder 1803<br>
along a track provides for the movement of a pivot point described for the<br>
embodiment shown in Fig. 11. The sliding of the mast through cylinder 1802 allows<br>
mast height to be adjusted, and therefore the height of a structure based on a<br>
framework having these features to be adjusted as well.<br>
It will be apparent to the skilled artisan that the openings through a compound<br>
joint such as that shown in Fig. 18 need not be round. Square openings, and other<br>
shapes, will accommodate tracks and masts of different shapes. The joint allowing<br>
sliding of track and mast elements nay be implemented in other ways as well, and, in<br>
some cases, only one of the sliding features may be implemented, either for the track<br>
or the mast.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention joints such as those described with<br>
reference to Fig. 18 may be used at the juncture between masts and rafters as well.<br>
This feature provides for some interesting features further described below.<br>
Fig. 19 shows a structure in cross section similar to the structure of Fig. 1, but<br>
having compound joints 1801 between each of the tracks and masts, and between each<br>
of the masts and rafters. The arrangement in this embodiment provides some very<br>
useful and interesting features for structures based on the framework. For example,<br>
masts and/or rafters of extra length, or capable of telescopic extension and contraction<br>
may be used. Then structural effects that were not before available may be provided<br>
in embodiments of the invention.<br>
Fig. 20 shows the cross-section of Fig. 19 in which the masts have been<br>
adjusted in joints 1801 at the junctures with the tracks to provide for extended legs, or<br>
stilts, 2001. By this feature, structures can be provided that are useful in swampy or<br>
flooding situations, to position a living or storage structure, for example, above a<br>
danger level for flooding. By the same feature, with skins extended below the floor<br>
level, a lower enclosure is provided for such as a cellar, or basement. With the floor<br>
of the structure at the higher level, one may store useful material and equipment in the<br>
lower enclosure. In some embodiments a third hub and a second set of tracks may be<br>
assembled to the framework with floor panels added, so the lower structure may also<br>
have a floor above ground level. Similarly, further added structures as described<br>
above may provide for any practical multiple of floors and rooms, or enclosures,<br>
according to need and purpose.<br>
As also seen in Fig. 20, extension of rafters 105 through joints 1801 may<br>
provide for extended eaves, allowing for roof panels to extend well beyond the walls<br>
supported by masts. This feature, shown as 2002 in Fig. 20, provides advantages such<br>
as better rain runoff, forcing water to run off at a further distance from the wall lines,<br>
and also may be used in some cases for further outside shelter, much like a porch on a<br>
more conventional structure.<br>
The ability to slide masts through joints 1801 between the rafters and the<br>
masts provides for yet another salient feature for structures supported by frameworks<br>
according to this embodiment of the invention. Fig. 21 shows a framework for a<br>
structure similar to that of Figs. 19 and 20, but in this case the roof portion of the<br>
structure, formed by the rafters and upper hub 102, with any covering skin, is lowered<br>
to nearly the level of the tracks that provide for a floor. This is a useful feature for<br>
structures that may be subjected to severe weather conditions, to provide a lower and<br>
less vulnerable profile to wind for example.<br>
The ability to slide rafters in joints 1801 at the points where the rafters and the<br>
masts intersect provides yet another useful feature for structures with frameworks<br>
according to embodiments of the present invention. Fig. 22 shows a framework<br>
similar to that of Fig. 19, wherein the rafters have been slid outward until the rafters<br>
are horizontal, and then slid back inward while lowering upper hub 102, providing for<br>
an inverted roof (assuming skin in place). In such, a structure, with several sides to the<br>
polygon, the inverted roof provides a funnel for rainwater, which may be guided into a<br>
cistern or directed into containers through an opening in the hub. In suitable climactic<br>
conditions, this structure may also at certain times of day (morning and evening, for<br>
example), collect condensate to provide drinking water, even in the absence of<br>
precipitation. Structures of this sort for collecting water for whatever purpose need<br>
only the inverted roof skin, and not necessarily wall skins, and may be built in various<br>
sizes to suit different purposes and applications. It will be clear as well, that a<br>
structure according to embodiments of the invention may, by suitable amendment,<br>
using the features provided, be dedicated to many different purposes.<br>
It will be apparent to the skilled artisan that there are many forms that an<br>
adjustable joint, such as joints 1801, may take. There may be, in some cases, a double<br>
rafter and a single mast, a double mast and a single rafter, or two of each, for example.<br>
The joints, providing for translatable adjustment of one or both of rafters and masts, as<br>
well as for rotational adjustment of rafters to masts, may take any one of many<br>
physical forms providing the essential features. Similarly, hubs and tracks can take<br>
many forms as well to provide the features described herein.<br>
In some embodiments frameworks according to the invention are relatively<br>
small and light, and may be deployed and folded relatively easily by one or two<br>
persons manually. In some cases with larger and relatively heavier frameworks, more<br>
human help will be needed. In some cases mechanisms are provided for deployment,<br>
and for aid in subsequent folding, such as cord or cable and pulley systems, which<br>
may also provide for a mechanical advantage. Consider, for example, the framework<br>
of Fig. 11, wherein the masts at the lower ends are made to translate along the tracks<br>
to erect the masts to a vertical orientation.<br>
Fig. 23 is a plan view of a portion of the framework of Fig. 11. The rafters and<br>
upper hub have been removed to better illustrate a cord and pulley system that may be<br>
used to erect masts for the framework of Fig. 11. In Fig. 23, only the lower hub and<br>
side-by-side tracks and rafters, both horizontal, are shown. In this example a pulley or<br>
post 2301 is implemented at the outer end of each track, and another pulley or post<br>
2302 is implemented at the end of each mast that is adjacent the lower hub 1101<br>
before the masts are raised. A cord, cable or equivalent 2303 is passed from a<br>
winding drum 2304 to go around pulley 2301 on a first of the tracks, then to and<br>
around pulley 2302 on the adjacent mast near the inner hub, then back to pulley 2301<br>
and around in the same direction as before. The cord or cable then passes to the next<br>
track end, and the winding is repeated for that track/mast combination; and so on until<br>
the last mast and track; then the cord or cable is passed back to the drum 2304 and<br>
anchored there. By turning drum 2304 clockwise the loop of cord made around the<br>
pulleys becomes smaller, and as the loop gets smaller, the mast ends near the lower<br>
hub are drawn outward, and the masts are erected, raising the rafters and upper hub,<br>
until the framework is fully deployed. At that point, the cord can be removed, or<br>
stowed in some manner.<br>
The skilled artisan will recognize that there are a broad variety of ways that<br>
such pulley systems may be implemented to aid in the erection and deployment of<br>
frameworks in embodiments of the present invention. The system illustrated is merely<br>
exemplary.<br>
Another feature of frameworks in embodiments of the invention involves the<br>
nature of the hubs. In some embodiments telescoping hubs may be provided, or a<br>
central spine may be provided through, for example, an opening in the lower hub,<br>
such that an erected, deployed framework will have a post on the centerline, extending<br>
part way between the hubs, or all the way between the hubs.<br>
Fig. 24 is an illustration of a framework much like that of Fig. 1, showing in<br>
addition a telescoping center post 2401 affixed to lower hub 101, and having an<br>
overall collapsed height, H, less than the overall length of one of the rafters 105. As it<br>
is the height of a rafter that determines the height of the collapsed, folded package of<br>
the framework, center post 2401 will not, if it is not too great in diameter, interfere in<br>
any way with the folding of the framework for transport or storage.<br>
Center post 2401 in this embodiment has an outer portion 2402, affixed to<br>
lower hub 101, and an extending inner portion 2403, which is shown as extended to<br>
the height of upper hub 102. Extended as shown and affixed in the extended<br>
position, which may be done in any one of several ways, such as by a standard<br>
fastener, the center post can support and strengthen the framework and any subsequent<br>
structure based on the framework.<br>
It will be apparent, given the teachings above, that a center post may also be<br>
used with the framework in embodiments based on Fig. 11, and a framework with<br>
slidable and translating joints, as also taught above. Further, a center post may also be<br>
extendable below lower hub 101 for various purposes. Referring to Fig. 20, for<br>
example, in a situation wherein masts or mast extensions may be used to raise a floor<br>
on tracks 103 above ground level, or in a case wherein more than one lower hub and<br>
tracks may be used to create separate stories in a single structure, a downward-<br>
extending center post may be used to provide additional center support for the<br>
resulting structure.<br>
There is little limitation to uses for structures based on a framework as taught<br>
above in various embodiments of the invention. Structures may be contemplated for<br>
housing, for storage, for camping out, for classrooms, for hot houses, for water<br>
collection, for deploying solar panels, and much, much more. Even water-borne<br>
structures may be provided, such as by affixing floats below a base formed by tracks<br>
and a lower hub. Fig. 25, for example, shows a unit such as shown in Fig. 10, but<br>
having added float structures 2501 affixed beneath the structure. In Fig. 25 the floats<br>
2501 are shown detached, and below the structure, with arrows indicating that are to<br>
be placed directly under the structure. The floats 2501 could be such as inner-tubes,<br>
or other bladder-like components, or could take other shapes, being filled with an or<br>
other lightweight material. There could be one centrally-located float, floats at<br>
corners, or in any other number and stable arrangement to provide a floating structure.<br>
Such a floating structure might find employment as a barge, a pleasure craft, a<br>
fishing platform, and so forth. Such structures could be powered in any conventional<br>
way, such as by outboard or inboard engines, by oars, and by poling as done with<br>
some rafts, for example. Such floating structures can also be employed as housing<br>
units to take advantage of waterways and reservoirs and the like as real estate for low-<br>
cost housing.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention structures based upon modular<br>
frameworks as taught in various embodiments of the invention herein may be joined<br>
in a wide variety of ways to provide composite and multilevel structures for many<br>
interesting purposes. Fig. 26 is a plan view showing just the plan view outlines of<br>
four octagonal structures 2601-2604, joined in a rather simple example.<br>
The octagonal structures of Fig. 26 are, in this example, of the same physical<br>
size and structure, although this is a convenience, not a limitation in joining. In this<br>
case one of four structures is used as a central unit, and the other three are joined to<br>
the central wit at three sides of the eight sides of the central unit, leaving an open side<br>
between each side joined. In this arrangement the central unit has one outside door<br>
2602, and within the composite structure at each of the joined sides, an inner door<br>
2603 is provided. Windows of various sorts may be provided in the remaining<br>
unjoined sides of the four structures (or not). There may also be other outside doors in<br>
one or another of the structures.<br>
There are various ways that joining may be physically accomplished. Because<br>
the sides and structures arc basically identical, in the joining shown there will be, at<br>
each joining interface, adjacent masts in each of the sidc-by-side structures.<br>
Conventional fasteners, such as bolts and nuts, or clamping mechanisms, may be used<br>
to fasten mast-to-mast between any two structures. Doorways and/or windows may be<br>
pre-planned, or accomplished after the fact. Of course additional units may be added<br>
in a variety of symmetrical and non-symmetrical ways.<br>
In an arrangement as shown in Fig. 26, and other similar arrangements, each<br>
separate unit is a collapsible framework, as laught above, and may be separately and<br>
independently folded and stored. In one example, such a composite structure, based<br>
on independent modules, may be used for a camping unit (portable), or as a housing<br>
unit with several extra rooms, such as bedroom and utility rooms, around a central<br>
hall. There are many possibilities.<br>
There are many other possibilities for joining than the rather simple example<br>
shown in Fig. 26. It is not. necessary, for example, that the different units bt identical.<br>
Units of different sizes and shapes can be joined as well. For example, a central unit<br>
may have eight sides as shown in Fig. 26, but peripheral units could have fewer or<br>
more sides than eight, with the sides still being the same in size and shape. Even if<br>
sides are not the same size and shape, they may be joined.<br>
Fig. 27 illustrates an arrangement combining side-to-side joining with a novel<br>
use of central posts extending below the lower hubs of joined units. In this example<br>
two unit structures 2702 are joined at one face and integrated with other elements to<br>
provide a boat unit 2701. Posts 2703 are downward-extending center posts in each of<br>
units 2702 as described above. A structural keel 2704 is joined between the lower<br>
ends of each of posts 2703. Framing elements arc added between the keel and the<br>
points of each unit 2702 where tracks and masts meet; that is, at the lower ends of<br>
masts as shown. The resulting planes are then covered with a suitable skin, such as<br>
rigid panels with joints scaled, or with a fabric-type conformal skin. The result is a<br>
hull for the resulting boat structure. Fig. 28 is a front (or rear) view of unit 2701 from<br>
the perspective of the arrow labeled "Fig. 28" in Fig. 27, which looks along the length<br>
of keel 2704<br>
It will be evident to those skilled in the art that addition of one or more hub<br>
and track units coaxial with the one shown in Fig 28 can produce multi-decked craft,<br>
but much more remarkably can be employed to produce any number of more<br>
favorable hull shapes beneath the waterline. Indeed, to the extent the track lengths<br>
and/or distance between the stacked hubs is/are variable, an extremely interesting<br>
variable and "tunable-shaped" hull results. One may make, for example, out of a<br>
pentagonal three-hub unit, a fiat bottomed or deep hulled keeled craft, or anything in<br>
between, and thus enhance hull shape effectively without limit in order to, for<br>
example, meet changing weather, conditions, propulsion modes, or ways of using the<br>
craft or to alter the its primary or ultimate roll stability characteristics. It will be<br>
evident to those skilled in the art that by varying the spatial relationship and/or length<br>
or number of stacked platforms, there is no limit to the number of different shapes that<br>
can be achieved.<br>
Another embodiment of an infinitely tunable shaped hull is provided simply by<br>
extending rods or suchlike protruding elements, which in some embodiments are<br>
masts, downward from or through the tracks above, at the position above which an<br>
angular bend in the hull is desired. Variant submerged hull shapes can be achieved by<br>
this alternative method, which does not require multiple stacked platforms so long as<br>
the stacked platforms decrease progressively from top to bottom.<br>
Once it is pointed out, those skilled in the art will appreciate the fact that very<br>
optimal hull shapes at the beam can be produced using the frameworks herein<br>
described when they are joined, laterally. In one embodiment there may be an<br>
equilateral hexagonal framework with vertices of angles of<br>
3p/5, 3p/5, 4p/5, 3p/5, 37p/5,4p/5, with the addition of an equilateral framework at the<br>
bow, resulting in a rather classical nautical shape when seen from above. This shape<br>
also provides for promising docking and packing characteristics easily appreciated by<br>
those in skilled in the naval arts.<br>
A different shape can be produced by two pentagonal framed units combined<br>
with two rhomb framed units (which is two say, two parallelogram with angles p/5,<br>
4p/5, p/5, and 4 p/5.) As in the previous example, the combined craft enjoys unusually<br>
favorable docking and packing characteristics . Moreover, the rhomb by itself<br>
exhibits a familiar and recognizable hull shape: that of the single kayak. Those<br>
skilled in the art will readily appreciate the potential for break-apart modular hulls<br>
made possible by the disioining of such modular framed units, the modular framed<br>
components of which can function as smaller hulls, docks, or barges, to give only a<br>
few examples.<br>
Returning now to the aspects of joining individual modular unit structures<br>
having frameworks according to embodiments of the present invention, it is also<br>
possible, and in many cases convenient, to stagger units in joining, and to create<br>
multiple levels of joined units. One purpose for such joining of units is to create<br>
multi-level housing. Fig. 29 illustrates one way staggering and multi-level joining<br>
may be done.<br>
In Fig. 29 line 2903 represents a ground line, and two units 2901 are shown<br>
resting on the ground, and spaced apart to an extent that another unit 2901 may be<br>
stacked on the two at ground level by aligning the masts of the upper unit with those<br>
of the two lower units. Joining in this case can be done in a number of different ways.<br>
In this example, sleeve units 2902 are used to join the masts of the separate units. In<br>
this example the units are four-sided, so two of the masts of each unit are bidden<br>
behind the foremost masts. This is not a limitation, however, as units of other<br>
geometry may be used as well, and there is no requirement that the units be identical.<br>
As a further example of the sort of stacking described with reference to Fig.<br>
29, Fig. 30 is a plan view of an arrangement using octagonal units. In this<br>
arrangement there are nine units, but there could be many more. The five units<br>
marked "a" are at ground level, and the four units marked "b" are at a second-storey<br>
level with their appropriate masts joined to the masts of the lower units in the fashion<br>
described above with reference to Fig. 29, or an equivalent. It will be apparent to the<br>
skilled artisan that many other arrangements are possible, and that there may also be<br>
further levels provided by stacking units at a higher level on the second level, and so<br>
on. There are many possibilities based on this sort of stacking of units based on<br>
embodiments of the invention.<br>
Fig. 31 illustrates yet another way that modular units may be staggered and<br>
stacked. In Fig. 31, one unit 3101 is joined to another unit 3102 by overlapping at<br>
least a portion of the "floor" structure of each unit, in this particular example, in the<br>
region indicated by element number 3103. This overlapping and joining will typically<br>
be accomplished in erection and before skins are added, although this is not strictly<br>
necessary. In some cases the overlapping areas can be joined by conventional<br>
fasteners, such as bolts and nuts. In some cases, one or both of the joining units may<br>
have a double set of tracks, supporting two floor structures, with at least one set joined<br>
to masts by translating elements, such that a floor of one unit may be trapped between<br>
two floors, one at least translatable, of the other unit. This overlapping method, with<br>
suitable translating elements, offers a broad variety of geometries in joining.<br>
In the joining and staggering teachings above it is necessary to emphasize that,<br>
although individual modules, or Monads, are typically unitary for erection into<br>
deployed frameworks, or for collapsing into minimum-space and volume units for<br>
transport or storage, that some dis-assembly and/or re-assembly may well be done to<br>
accomplish specific goals. As an example of erection, consider the watercraft<br>
illustrated by Figs. 27 and 28, for example, there may be two self-contained<br>
framework units 2702, separately collapsed for storage and transport. The keel 2704<br>
and other structural elements may be disassembled and stored separately, such as<br>
skins for both units and for the hull. Erection into the watercraft 2701 would proceed<br>
roughly by unfolding the frameworks of the two units 2702, then joining the two units<br>
at one side face. Then the downwardly extendible center posts 2703 may be deployed,<br>
and the keel affixed to the lower extremities of the two center posts. After affixing<br>
the keel framework elements are added from each end of the keel to the underside of<br>
certain forward-facing and rearward-facing masts, to provide a framework for the hull.<br>
These elements may be, for example, cables with tightening mechanisms.<br>
After the hull framework is accomplished, one may affix skins to both the hull<br>
and the upper units 2702, to complete the watercraft envelope. The skins can be any<br>
of, or a combination of, a broad variety of elements, such as fabric or rigid panels.<br>
One may also add propulsion elements, such as oars, engines, or sails.<br>
The same general principles are true for other combination structures generally<br>
bases on foldable monad frames as taught herein. For example, one might have a<br>
reason for removing, after erection, just the rafter and roof elements of all, or a select<br>
few of the distinct units that might be joined to make a composite structure. For<br>
example, the lower hubs, tracks and floor often might well be stored, handled and<br>
used as single assemblage for countless purposes subsumed under the general category<br>
of "platforms"; while the top sections comprising upper hub, rafters and masts well<br>
might likewise be folded, stored, handled and used as separate assemblages, broadly<br>
in the manner of a tent, carport or canopy, to name only a few examples.<br>
Generalized Material<br>
The disclosure above is illustrated by certain figures, and is specific to the<br>
principles and features of the present invention. The disclosure that follows this point<br>
is more general in nature, and illustrates more broadly many of the motivations for<br>
and principles of the present invention, and provides broad disclosure of many and<br>
varied uses for the embodiments of the invention taught herein. This is not to say that<br>
there are no specific embodiments of the invention explained wholly in the following<br>
material.<br>
This paragraph is meant as a relative summary of a Modular Or Non-Attached<br>
Autonomous Device (MONAD), as illustrated above in many various embodiments of<br>
the invention, functioning either as a stand-alone unit or aggregated into compounds<br>
or complexes. The MONAD in general is the fundamental element of a hyper-<br>
multipurpose over-system (named 4-PASS by the inventor) of about 16 systems<br>
adapted to emergency, temporary or semi-permanent use in virtually all terrains,<br>
including wet and dry land, water, &amp; ice, each system being quite broad in its own<br>
right. The MONAD is comprised in most cases of equilateral polygonal platform-<br>
based foldable, highly compressible framed clamping MONAD structures, deriving<br>
wide versatility from radical symmetry, all-directional interlinking, maximal<br>
extensibility and scalability. These advantages are obtained at least in part through<br>
applying principles of tiling, information theory and class inheritance, such that<br>
cardinal qualities of the MONAD, for instance rapidity of set-up, are passed on to<br>
compounds and complexes formed of MONADs, making possible, for example, the<br>
deployment within minutes of a multi-chambered complex of raised, hard-decked,<br>
completely enclosed, interconnecting structures and compounds, each chamber with<br>
its independently filtered air supply, even on a very large scale, which could save<br>
countless lives and alleviate untold suffering in natural emergencies, major accidents,<br>
or if war involving weapons of mass destruction cannot be averted, and thus is being<br>
disclosed in large part for humanitarian reasons.<br>
4-PASS as a system of systems comprising methods for creating compound<br>
and complex apparatuses out of coordinated simpler units, and the simpler units<br>
themselves are apparatuses with innovative apparatus and methods for set-up and use<br>
in myriad ways as stand-alone units in their own right. The MONAD is the basic 4-<br>
PASS atomic unit. In terms of materials out of which MONADs may be built, their<br>
size, number of sides, rigging, underpinning, coverings &amp; so forth, and mechanically<br>
as well, there is a great range and variety of workable options for units which will fit<br>
within the 4-PASS C&amp;C systems and the larger 4-PASS System. The particular<br>
combination of intentionally maximally generalized characteristics designed into a<br>
basic unit tend to be inherited by the derived combinations, that is to say, by the<br>
compounds and complexes composed of and created out of MONADs; and this is the<br>
ultimate source of the system's ground-up hyper-multi-functionality.<br>
There seem to be at least two main strategies available when one seeks to<br>
maximize multi-functionality. One strategy is exemplified by the Swiss Army Knife.<br>
It involves niftily packing several broadly useful, but still specialized tools into a<br>
single unit. Despite inevitable compromises, a great deal of Nüftigkeit. or general and<br>
handy usefulness, can be achieved through this design approach. However, it is not,<br>
let us emphasize, not the approach 4-PASS has taken. Another available design<br>
approach, and the one that 4-PASS has chosen in the pursuit of radical multi-<br>
functionality, is quite familiar and readily exemplified by the Human hand. A number<br>
of like units (digits) are arranged fairly symmetrically, strong enough to hold<br>
themselves in position, but flexible enough to articulate at multiple points and work in<br>
tandem, in unison, or separately. Maintenance of an axis between the center of the<br>
palm and the finger tips allows for strength at the finger tips when they are drawn<br>
together, even though the physical connection does not lie on that specific axis, but<br>
rather goes round about it. The redundancy of the fingers is remarkable: many have<br>
known skilled crafts people who have lost all or part of more than one digit without<br>
apparent diminution in dexterity necessary for their craft. The analogy extends to the<br>
level of 4-PASS compounds and complexes, for hands not only work beautifully in<br>
pairs (in part by virtue of the symmetry already noted), but also in much larger<br>
aggregates as witnessed by the much of the construction and manufacture that is<br>
achieved collectively and cooperatively.<br>
4-PASS does not map well with extant industrial categories. It spans such<br>
broad categories as catastrophic emergency relief equipment and shelter, decks, tents,<br>
garden structures, watercraft, houseboats, pre-manufactured housing, tanks and<br>
vessels, satellite dishes and antennae, enclosures, agricultural structures, scaffolding,<br>
towers, walkways, landings, furnishings, and a variety of watercraft from barges to<br>
pleasure boats. In this sense, 4-PASS is a superset of conventionally recognized<br>
structural categories. In the main, 4-PASS pertains to the very broad class of easily<br>
transportable and rapidly erectable temporary or semi-permanent foldable and self-<br>
standing or floating framed structures that are designed to be reused and reconfigured<br>
freely, in contrast to more permanent buildings secured to foundations and having<br>
their components permanently fixed in relation to one another. (Ironically, there is a<br>
major exception to the distinction just drawn: because of their suitability as drilling<br>
platforms and as the basis for progressively lifted floating or injection-type concrete<br>
forms, MONADs may form the basis for laying very strong moorings and foundations<br>
suitable to the most permanent type of construction over land or shallow water. But<br>
this exception having been noted, let us return to discussion of the rule that MONADs<br>
may serve well where more permanent structures would be unnecessary or<br>
unsuitable.) Thus the parts of a single MONAD, in particular embodiments, have the<br>
capacity to articulate and slide, allowing platform, legs, sides and topside to vary in<br>
their spatial relationship. Used in 4-PASS compounds and complexes, MONADs<br>
enjoy this same flexibility in terms of free configuration, convertibility, and reuse to a<br>
degree much greater than, for example, a train car, not to mention a permanent<br>
building. A better analogy would be to say that what the automobile is to<br>
transportation systems the MONAD has promise to be relative to transportable and<br>
rapidly set up framed structures and devices of many kinds.<br>
The following are sixteen purposely very general characteristics, or cardinal<br>
qualities, that define the MONAD in particular embodiments of the invention:<br>
1. Platform-based<br>
2. Polygonal 3-x sided regular and closely allied equilateral platform shape, and also<br>
highly symmetrical above a below platform.<br>
3. Multifunctional central tube (hub) defines central axis.<br>
4. Girding chinch-binding up-right peripheral elements.<br>
5. Radial structural members or tracks in some cases locked with flanges.<br>
6. Foldable/modular frame with, in some cases, hinged and sliding, clamped joints.<br>
7. Hard, sectional floor/deck.<br>
8. Self-elevating and stilted.<br>
9. Almost all-terrain, almost all-weather, and almost all conditions capabilities for<br>
setup and deployment.<br>
10. Interchangeable runners or footings below.<br>
11. Suspendable and self-hoisting in some embodiments.<br>
12. Convertible topside: concave/convex.<br>
13. Stackable, multi-storied capabilities.<br>
14. 100 percent coverable-interchangeable multi-layered coverings and aperture or<br>
skins.<br>
15. Rapid setup optionally equipped for instantaneous self-erection.<br>
16. Indefinitely scalable, interlinkable, and extensible.<br>
There are at least six variants of the MOD AD that meet this entire set of<br>
criteria, purposely radically general in its demands. Thus, even in terms of basic<br>
frame design, there is more than one embodiment for the MONAD capable of serving<br>
as a broadly multi-functional device either individual or in concert with other<br>
MONADs of any type. Masted types were the first discovered and defined, and are<br>
likely to be the main type, so this is the manifestation covered in greatest detail in<br>
these disclosures in order to convey an idea of how all MONADs can be concretely<br>
realized. In regard in particular to the masted-type M-MONAD:<br>
Nearly all 4-PASS MONADs possess radical radial symmetry. Equilateral<br>
polygons with 3 or more equal sides are formed out of members radiating from a<br>
central tubular unit. As a rule, these platform supports have all equal angles as well,<br>
although there are a couple of exceptions. Any M-MONAD frame can best be drawn,<br>
described and understood once it is seen that it is composed of assemblages of three<br>
articulated and elongated members (track, mast, and rafter) terminating above at a<br>
flattened cylindrical element (sky hatch, or upper hub) and below at a flanged,<br>
cylindrical element (lower hub). The hatch and hub are common elements shared by<br>
nearly all the embodiments, so there is only one lower hub and one hatch or upper hub<br>
per MONAD; however, there are as many assemblages of elongated members as there<br>
are vertices: 3 or more.<br>
There is no theoretical limit, but as a practical matter, 5-, 6-, and 8-sided<br>
MONADs are expected by the inventor to have the most utility, with significant but<br>
lesser demand anticipated for 3-, 4-, 10- and 12-sided units. More than one platform<br>
may be stacked so as to share hubs, rafters, sky hatches, but with separate tracks, or<br>
this may be accomplished by extending coupling two or more hubs and masts. The<br>
stacking of platforms (particularly in pairs) has great significance for creating<br>
compounds and complexes, because it makes possible inter-clamping of staggered M-<br>
MONADs. The joints of every juncture in the each assembly are hinged, with the<br>
consequence that all motion of which an assemblage is permitted is confined within a<br>
single plane. Because the assemblages share two common elements, the hatch and<br>
hub are maintained in common axis even when not directly physically connected.<br>
In addition to allowing articulation at variable angles, some of the joints<br>
between members allow sliding, or translation, with subsequent fixing. A track slide<br>
in some preferred embodiments allows the masts to move along the track and to<br>
move up and down in relation to the track<br>
A mast slide joins mast and rafter, and allows these two members to vary their<br>
juxtaposition, so that the entire topside (rafters + hatch) can be raised and lowered.<br>
Fixing means that mast and track slides can be clamped or fixed in place at any point<br>
along the member on which they slide. It is not merely the mechanical device (such<br>
as pressure fitting) used to fix the slide which holds the top side up: a girding element<br>
(cinch) is employed in some preferred embodiments As a cinch is tightened or<br>
winched up, it has the effect of lifting the masts upright.<br>
Two of the principal elements typically lie on single axis. The lower one is<br>
called the hub, or lower hub. The hub's functions are manifold. In various<br>
compound and complex (C&amp;C) Systems, the hub functions as (or in lieu of): floor<br>
beam, portal, window, door, drain, air intake, air filter, plumbing or electrical hookup, <br>
masthead, center pole engine housing, hold, center support, fireplace, cistern, safe,<br>
etc. Generally, the lower hub functions as a sheath for other tubular elements within<br>
the MONAD, the elements running up through the platform, and thus may be likened<br>
to a spinal cord. However, two hub functions must be highlighted for basic<br>
understanding. (1) To allow M-MONADs to fold, hubs are hinged to their adjacent<br>
members called tracks. (2) Once tracks extend outwardly normally at equal angles<br>
from each other, hubs clamp the tracks perpendicular to the hub's axis. A pair of<br>
flanges may be used as the clamp, or alternate embodiments may have one flange that<br>
can lock the tracks securely using other available techniques. There are various ways<br>
hubs can telescope or otherwise be extended under load.<br>
The upper axial member is called a sky hatch, or, in some cases, an upper hub.<br>
A direct connection between the two axial members, hub and hatch, is available but<br>
not required. A crucial innovation of the apparatus in preferred embodiments is that it<br>
maintains the alignment of these two elements along their axis in either case, whether<br>
or not they are directly coupled, and that it achieves this by means of a number of<br>
intermediate members that not only are hinged together, but which are allowed in<br>
some embodiments during set-up or use to vary their position relative to one another,<br>
yet all the while maintaining themselves within their single plane. But since the sky<br>
hatch is only sometimes directly connected to the hub completing a circuit (as a yogi's<br>
fingers and toes are only sometimes directly connected when he or she chooses to<br>
interlock them), in contrast to the hub, which is always directly connected to the<br>
tracks.<br>
Tracks are an important member to understand. Whatever their form, they<br>
must be hinged to the hub so that the M-MONAD can fold (collapse when desired),<br>
and by whatever means, they must be held rigidly in place at (or about) 90 degrees to<br>
the hub's axis when the M-MONAD is set up (so not collapse when in use). Tracks<br>
and hub as a rigid, clamped unit constitute a platform frame, and may support a deck.<br>
Tracks have other uses as well. They may hold joints called track slides, which in turn<br>
hold the next major members, the masts. Tracks can comprise mechanical means for<br>
forcing the slides, and they can comprise conduits for electricity or water. There may<br>
be linkages, such as cable, that raise and lower either platforms or topside up and<br>
down relative to the masts.<br>
At the ends of tracks, beyond the masts, there may be hitches, a primary means<br>
of joining and interlinking MONADs. Additionally, hitches may help support<br>
runners like wheels, skids, keels-or-skis. Hitches may be used as additional<br>
connecting points between stacked platforms or for railings at the edge of platforms.<br>
Hitches are of great importance in allowing MONADs to participate in compounds<br>
and complexes, so in some cases standardization of the coupling unit is accomplished.<br>
While the number of sides permitted for a MONADs is open, strict standardization of<br>
the length of sides is desirable because it will permit MONADs of differing numbers<br>
of sides to make a two-hitch interlink. One-hitch interlinking, or staggered<br>
interlocking, would still be available for coupling MONADs of different-sized sides.<br>
A joint between track and mast, namely the track slide in one embodiment, is<br>
very important for set-up. One method of set up basically involves merely sliding<br>
track slides (like shuttle cocks) outward to their final position and inserting the masts<br>
(through the mast slides hinged to the rafters) and then into the track slides. It is then<br>
an easy matter to hoist the topside using a winching capability "built in each MONAD.<br>
Another more elegant method is used when the M-MONAD has been stored or folded<br>
as a single unit. This second method again involves sliding the track slides to the end<br>
of the tracks, but this time under load, since the bases of the mast already are pre-<br>
inserted in the track slides, with all the rest of the weight of the top part of the<br>
structure on top. Moving the track slides out results in raising the topside as the masts<br>
become more upright. It is the bases of the masts that move, not the tops, because a<br>
winching cinch girds the tops of the masts. Actually, the second method is available<br>
even when the topside and masts have been stored as separate modular assemblies, as<br>
will sometimes be desirable so as to divide the weight into more easily managed parts.<br>
However, when a lower hub larger in diameter than the upper hub is employed, the<br>
unit may be raised using the second method, but will have to be restored as two<br>
modular assemblies. For emergency use, for example during storms at sea or highly<br>
contaminated sites, air bag technology can be used to set up the frame instantaneously<br>
to the point that a sterile chamber, with filtered air supply can be entered and setup<br>
comoleted from within.<br>
Masts articulate with rafters, and the joints between them may be called mast<br>
slides. Everything above the slides can be raised or lowered up and down the masts<br>
because of the reposition that the mast slides permit. When locked in place, mast<br>
slides hold one end of the mast while the platform beneath is being raised or lowered<br>
relative to them. To have all the angle variability required for folding, and to permit<br>
all the motion of rafters above and tracks below relative to masts, may make it seem<br>
as if nothing is fixed. But in reality, if counter-intuitively, all the movement is<br>
confined to a single plane, which if it meets other like linkages in intercepting planes,<br>
will be the basis for a strong standing structure.<br>
The variation of angle between tracks, masts, and rafters provided by the<br>
hinged track slides below and the hinged mast slides above are what allows the<br>
topside of the MONAD to convert both ways between concave and convex, and<br>
become very strongly held up in either position once the track slides lock the masts<br>
back into the vertical.<br>
In some embodiments a winching cinch attaches to mast slides. As the cinch<br>
is loosened, the masts will tilt outward unless they are locked to the vertical. This is<br>
precisely what one wants to allow the rafters to straighten out horizontally so the sky<br>
hatch can be lowered to create a concave topside or lifted to create a convex (roof<br>
shaped) topside. The cinch of course can also be locked into position when the masts<br>
assume their upright position, at which point it functions like a hoop to a barrel.<br>
The sky hatch resembles the hub in that it may be an outer tube that sheaths<br>
other tubular elements such as a chimney or fume vent, water intake, grain intake,<br>
antennae receiver armatures, active solar distillation tubes, etc. For some applications<br>
a Plexiglas skylight which may be normally used must be removed from the sky hatch.<br>
For emergency use over contaminated grounds or waters a one-way air valve is<br>
employed in the sky hatch so that all incoming air supply passes through filter in the<br>
hub.<br>
Main Components:<br>
Covering Skins:<br>
Most covering skins will be soft and pliable, allowing some of them to fold<br>
right in with the frame for storage. Of course, there is nothing to preclude bulkier soft<br>
covering or sectional hard coverings, which would be folded or stacked respectively.<br>
They will be made out of material like screens, tarps, vinyl canvass, reflective Mylar,<br>
etc.. The generic name used for all the coverings will be skins. Skin types include<br>
among potentially others, include: Light and Heat Reflective Skins, Electromagnetic<br>
Radiation Reflective Skins, Solar Screening Skins, water impermeable Slick Skins,<br>
Insect Screening Skins, Insulating Skins, Sound Proofing Skins, Photovoltaic Skins,<br>
Fire and Smoke Resistant Skins, Aperture Skins (doors, windows, portholes, vents),<br>
and Transparent Skins, either for viewing through or for passive solar &amp; green house<br>
use. Other types include Net Skins, Trapping Skins, and Semi-permeable Skins.<br>
Skins used only below deck and reaching to the ground can be termed Skirts. We<br>
shall see skirts have many uses, particularly in agriculture, to confine sprays, dusts,<br>
and biological pest control predators. Flaps, useful as awnings or blinds, and attach to<br>
tops of the side skins.<br>
Most skins will be of flexible, fabric-like materials, but there is nothing to<br>
preclude thicker, stiffer skins that would be stored as sectional sheets. (Of course,<br>
decking will need to be stiff and stored in sections.)<br>
Side skins may be rigged to roll up and the down like blinds, and are held<br>
together at the sides by something like shower curtain rings, with the sides of two<br>
adjacent skins sharing the same pole (or mast) and the same rings. Top skins may be<br>
held in position with bungee cord, Velcro, grommets, or other simple means. Some<br>
top skins may be further secured by cinches, straps, snaps, Velcro, zippers, stays that<br>
may be inserted in grooves.<br>
For emergency use in locations contaminated by nuclear waste, biological or<br>
chemical agents or weapons, layered impermeable skins, simple as 4 or 5 sheets of 4<br>
mil vinyl sandwiching a mild adhesive combined with potent sterilizing germicides<br>
and neutralizing chemicals, might save many lives. There may be multiple skins<br>
sloughed off whenever called for. Sheets may be in some embodiments peeled off for<br>
proper disposal without further exposing patients, other occupants or contents. In<br>
dusty climates particularly, a mild adhesive left on the surface of a skin could do dual<br>
service: snagging harmful airborne particles like flypaper, and rendering some of<br>
them harmless.<br>
Within MONADs, interior partitions or curtains might be made of similar<br>
material. Multiple showers, changing rooms and air locks that could be vital to help<br>
affected populations in such dire environments might well employ such embodiments<br>
of the skins. Multiple layered disposable skins proposed in the previous paragraph<br>
could serve well for the interiors of such MONAD shelters.<br>
The Lower Hub:<br>
The central cylinder, like a large, doubly-flanged telescoping pipefitting, is called<br>
by the inventor the lower hub, or, in some cases, just the hub. The hub is a crucial<br>
load-bearing and load-distributing member. Rubber mounts and sprung hydraulic<br>
mono-shocks may be used for dampening vibration and easing wear and tear on the<br>
radiating tracks that feed into the lower hub. It is not merely threads of flanges around<br>
the hub that might provide all-important solidity through the hub, but much more the<br>
clamping action by means of threaded bolt or other simple mechanical means. In fact,<br>
most likely compression fittings rather than threads will connect flanges to hubs. It<br>
would be a mistake to consider the hub two-dimensionally (merely as a wagon wheel),<br>
for its cylindrical height definitely matters, and being telescopic or adapted to take<br>
extenders, that height is variable both above below the platform level.<br>
Another embodiment of a bottom flange has grooves for the tracks to fold<br>
down through. It is rotated into position under the tracks when for set up. Pivoting<br>
tightening bolts like those on a canning pressure cooker, could easily be fitted to<br>
modified standard large pipe flanges.<br>
One would merely saw from the rim of the flange to each bolt hole to create a<br>
notch wide enough for a bolt to pass. The radiating tracks are hinged to the top flange<br>
to allow for folding up 4-PASS devices. Actually, these hinges need only be stout<br>
enough for folding and unfolding the frame, for they do not bear any weight when the<br>
4-PASS device is actually up: it is the clamping action of the two flanges in such an<br>
embodiment that does the real work.<br>
A viable alternative approach would be to beef up the hinges so that they could<br>
support the load even without the clamping of a lower flange. The advent of seismic<br>
retrofitting has meant that "hold downs are strong to do their intended job and cheap<br>
because they are mass-produced. Supposing single square tracks were used, they<br>
could terminate centrally with such hold downs hinged to the upper flange. When the<br>
tracks were unfolded in set-up, the heel of the hold-down would rest at a right angle<br>
between the hub and the bottom of the top flange, holding the platform at the desired<br>
90 degree angles to the hub.<br>
Like the mouth of the octopus, the hub is a multi-purpose portal as well as a<br>
key structural member. In addition to being the central structural member, the hub in<br>
many embodiments is also capable of performing the following functions (some in<br>
conjunction with additional Methods And Device Extensions):<br>
• Telescopically Upward Extendible: Crucible, kiln, solar oven, desalination<br>
still, and electromagnetic receiver, when in use, are all supported through by<br>
the hub in its upward extension. A Hub-Topside Adapter fits over the top of<br>
the hub and provides convenient access to brackets which permit further<br>
upward extensions through the skyhatch for kilns, ovens, etc. The topside<br>
itself, normally of course self-standing, rides out severe storms directly<br>
supported by the hub without any adapter and with very little upward<br>
extension.<br>
• Telescopically Downward Extendible: Extending downward, the hub is<br>
attached to, and passes through, the central flotation unit (in its simplest form,<br>
merely an inner tube.) Further down, again in severe storm situations, it<br>
supports the ballast and sea-anchor which make the platform above self-<br>
righting and sea-worthy as a buoy.<br>
• Air intake, fan and filtration: The hub lets every MONAD so equipped create<br>
a positive filtered air pressurized system<br>
• Saltwater pickup: In desalinization use, water is picked up through this<br>
aperture.<br>
• Fresh water output: Again, for desalination applications, where fresh water is<br>
pumped to central collecting cistern, tank or shore.<br>
• Fresh water collection funnel point: In the inverted position, roof serves as a<br>
giant rain funnel, the hub forming the narrowest part of the funnel. A plastic<br>
water bladder may filled by this means even over water<br>
o Outer sleeves: These are used as alternate or back ups winches and take-up<br>
spools for the winches normally employed for the self-elevating and lowering<br>
capabilities. A handle of suitable length supplies the required mechanical<br>
advantage.<br>
• Special Uses: Larger hubs may be used for diving, drilling, swimming, &amp;<br>
bathing. The hub is very useful when the 4-PASS device is suspended, as for<br>
helicopter rescue work or arboreal deployment. Due to the weight balance<br>
conferred by MONADs' symmetry about a point, they have favorable<br>
characteristics as airlift platforms, and the fact that the hub can extend upward<br>
raises the pivot point of a cable running right down from the chopper through<br>
the hub and secured by locking hook at the hub bottom: precisely the strongest<br>
point of any MONAD. The advent of a covered and even as need be airlift<br>
platform may well be another patent quality of the 4-PASS MONAD.<br>
• Use as Holds and Safes: For prolonged deep water use, sealed compartments<br>
within hubs would allow stowage of provisions below or near the water line.<br>
As supplies were used up, the hubs could be hauled up a notch or two at a time<br>
to reduce drag.<br>
• Optional Motor Chamber: The hub could contain an optional motor, when<br>
desired, of in-board out-board type, off of which could be run in addition:<br>
pump, generator, power winches, and desalinization equipment. Maintaining<br>
weight over the center and even weight distribution are quintessential to this<br>
design. Concentric cylindrical gas tanks within or around hub might even be<br>
considered, as would tubular tracks doubling as fuel tanks. In the case of a<br>
motor, sound insulation would be important. Additional vibration dampening<br>
might have to be addressed, but note that rubber mounting of track to hub by<br>
way of flanges is contemplated in any event to minimize wear and tear where<br>
members and hub meet.<br>
• Use as Pot Bellied Stove: Mounts on top for use in extreme cold survival<br>
situations. Since the family of 4-PASS devices has a number of renewable<br>
heating sources, this will not have to be resorted too often. The Nave (roof<br>
opening) and upward extension of the hub provide venting. Central position<br>
of heater should create an efficient use of radiant heat from combustion.<br>
o Table Top mounts above Hub. Can be slipped down to floor when not in use.<br>
o Winch control panel mounts below table top; it unfolds to reach beyond table<br>
top or folds to stow neatly underneath table top.<br>
• Tillers fold like winch panel under table when not in use.<br>
Radiating Tracks:<br>
The radiating tracks in most embodiments double as the main platform support<br>
members. In one embodiment they are composed of two parallel pieces, of wood in<br>
the simplest versions, extending to each angle of the polygon; thus the hexagon<br>
versions may have twelve members making up six tracks. The tracks are useful<br>
because the masts can extend through them, and the bases of the masts can be pulled<br>
outward from the center to their final position a couple of feet, in some cases, from the<br>
deck's outer edge. (This is to allow support for an outside deck beyond the domed<br>
cabin, as well as to make sure the deck overlaps the flotation units.)<br>
Where cost is less critical, square stainless steel shafting with square linear<br>
bearings might used both for tracks and masts. This would eliminate the need for<br>
parallel shafting and it would clamp easily between the hub flanges.<br>
Track Slides in the embodiments that use them perform several important<br>
functions. They hold the bottom part of the mast in place while it is slid into position.<br>
When it is necessary to lower the dome, for example to ride out a storm, the slides<br>
allow the masts to slide as they are dropped down. Sides may have shackles or<br>
pulleys attached to allow their movement along two axes. Note that it is the slide that<br>
allows the platform to elevate by pulley action. Ropes or cables that operate the slides<br>
generally pass between the or just under the tracks of the cable. The pivoting action<br>
of the slides allows the masts to fold together umbrella like for storage. Nylon<br>
sleeve bearings might be employed on low cost versions, while linear bearings would<br>
be use where cost was less critical. There are many alternatives for the track slides in<br>
terms of bearings, from furniture foot skids to self-lubricating sleeves to ball bearings.<br>
The dual track itself could be replaced in some embodiments by bars with a<br>
linear slide or a round slide holding circular bearings, or 2) a worm gear covered by a<br>
single slotted track as seen in some garage door opener designs. Pneumatic,<br>
hydraulic, or chain driven mechanical approaches are explicitly appropriate here, as<br>
well as for raising masts in relation to decks, and probably preferable in more<br>
sophisticated versions where cost is less of an object. Indeed, linear clutches are<br>
available that permit travel up of any length up smooth rotating cylindrical shafts.<br>
Wooden tracks might be tapered on the ventral side toward the outer ends, and beefier<br>
near the flanges.<br>
Spacers may be used in some embodiments as articulating crosspieces keeping<br>
the radiating tracks evenly apart. Three hinges may be used per spacer. The same<br>
rope or cable that draws the sliders into position may be used to lock the spacers in<br>
place. They work like the articulating braces that hold the legs of a folding table in<br>
position.<br>
Track endblocks are bookend like braces that track slides lock into and are<br>
supported by in their terminal outward position. Shown in turquoise in these<br>
illustrations, you can see how the slides slip into them at the end of their outward<br>
movement.<br>
At their extremity, the tracks may terminate in hitches. Hitches may be of a<br>
ball and socket type. This is a feature that enables the 4-PASS devices to interlink<br>
laterally and be configured in arrays of indefinite size.<br>
Decking:<br>
Decking may be of plywood or any other suitable material. Composites<br>
composed of resins on carbon fabric or Kevlar over a thin plywood core would likely<br>
be used in the lightweight versions. Decks may take the form of pie-shaped slices,<br>
with the small ends cut to accommodate the hub, and the arc side cut to make one side<br>
of the polygon. In larger layouts, there may be one pie shaped piece (generally long<br>
enough to cover a segment of the inside decking, and one rhombus-shaped piece to<br>
make up the adjacent outer decking. Trap Doors may be provided at appropriate points<br>
for storage, access to services areas, etc. Recessed tie-down hooks may be located<br>
especially near outer walls so that plastic utility trunks (doubling as benches) can be<br>
fixed in place.<br>
Masts:<br>
Masts are typically pole-shaped members able to support the topside, platform<br>
and skins both above the and below the platform. It is worth emphasizing that masts<br>
can typically be raised and lowered relative to the deck on slides by pulleys, worm<br>
gears, hydraulic, or by other mechanical means in various embodiments. In low-cost<br>
versions smooth steel rings or carabineers should provide sufficient means for raising<br>
and lowering the masts in tandem. In high-end versions, the yachting world has<br>
marvelously lightweight blocks, fiddles, etc. For most purposes, industrial block and<br>
tackle hardware should prove very serviceable. The top of the masts may be capped<br>
with a mast cap, which may house a pulley block. Under the mast cap there may be a<br>
top mast slide, which will provide the junction between the rafters and masts. This<br>
pivots allowing the angle between and rafters to vary, and it slides, permitting the<br>
topside to be raised and lowered in various embodiments. The top mast slide may be<br>
locked (using pin, pressure fitting, ratchet, clamps, sprung pin or other standard<br>
mechanism). Note that the mast slides are also the nexus in many embodiments<br>
between mast and cinch (otherwise you could not lower the topside without lowering<br>
the masts). Bottom mast slides arc the exact counterpart to the top mast slides in<br>
many embodiments, but perform their work below deck: to haul up nets, raise pallets,<br>
etc. The masts themselves may be of a shape that allows them to slide vertically<br>
through the slides and resist binding in the tracks. Something like flattened oval<br>
cylinders might be optimal, but for practical purposes, cylinders will be the norm.<br>
Masts may be made of a variety of materials or composites:<br>
• Tubular metal<br>
• Solid metal rods<br>
• Wood poles (dowels)<br>
• Solid metal poles with tubular extenders<br>
• Tubular poles with solid rod extenders<br>
• Bamboo (with some limitations)<br>
The masts additionally may have extenders, which may be either telescopic or<br>
may use some sort of outriders. Extenders may be used also at the tops of poles to<br>
mount wind turbines or hyperbolic focusing rods, and below they have a great many<br>
uses, particular in association with fish farming, fishing, hydroponics, and as sea<br>
anchors. Extenders which touch ground are called stilts. Feet may be used at the end<br>
of masts or the end of stilts. Feet may be provided in various types and sizes, such as<br>
webbed feet for soft soils and snow. Note that the same hand or power winches<br>
driving other spools could be used to raise and lower the masts and extenders. Upper<br>
mast extenders may accept flexible focusing rods (see below).<br>
Topside:<br>
A word more general than "roof has been chosen to indicate that this<br>
important component has many uses in addition to providing shelter from the<br>
elements. Topsides in embodiments of the invention are capable of being supported<br>
in either the convex (typically roof-like or pyramidal) or concave position (like a<br>
funnel). In either topside position, the topside can be supported in either of two<br>
convertible ways: 1) fixed (with center pole), or 2) floating (like a yurt: i.e. without<br>
center pole and without roof beams to hold up the rafter). The center pole in question<br>
is either the telescopic hub or an extender running up from the hub.<br>
Rafters:<br>
Rafters extend in parallel pairs in many embodiments very analogously to the<br>
tracks on platform level. The topside center may be an upper hub or a stout ring,<br>
called a sky hatch, into which the rafters assemble. Rafter pairs are attached to the<br>
hatch with rafter bolts producing a kind of hinge. On the outer ends, rafter pairs<br>
attach to the mast caps in most embodiments.<br>
Rafters may have telescoping outer end members called awnine supports, for<br>
the obvious purpose of providing shade on the outer deck.<br>
Both functionally and aesthetically, the importance of the sky hatch cannot be<br>
overemphasized. Taking recourse again a biological analogy, one is tempted to say<br>
that is this feature that allows the 4-PASS devices to incorporate and switch between<br>
the two great skeletal patterns nature has let evolve: the exoskeleton and the vertebral<br>
column. Note that the sky hatch in normal use is basically a sky light; a central<br>
source of light from above is aesthetically and symbolically pleasing, especially where<br>
there is a dome-like roof to suggest the vaulted heavens. But this same feature makes<br>
4-PASS devices particularly suitable to art studio use, and other applications where<br>
humans will need light, for example<br>
The pros and cons of a center pole are pretty obvious if you have ever sat at a<br>
picnic table with one of those incredibly durable canvass umbrellas supported by a<br>
pole jutting up through the center of the table. Great shade, but the pole sure gets in<br>
the way. It is just where you would want to place your chef d'ouevre, the pot for your<br>
poker game, or your Scrabble board. Unless they were inventive contortionists, an<br>
amorous couple in a center-poled two-person tent could become quite frustrated.<br>
Center poles can be extremely intrusive. Roof beams, which are so much a staple of<br>
permanent architecture, are not very suitable for temporary and semi-permanent use<br>
where portability, collapsibility, rapid set-up are paramount. For passive solar and<br>
greenhouse applications roof beams are undesirable insofar as they block solar rays.<br>
Like a bird's skeleton, above the platform base "strong but light" should be the<br>
watchwords for the structure.<br>
The principle that allows a roof to float without beams is the same one<br>
employed by a yurt. A belt, rope or cable connects the rafters to sides. It works like a<br>
hoop to barrel. In this family of inventions, we use this element in a second way: as a<br>
mechanical means for erecting structures. To emphasize this very significant feature<br>
of the family: a key structural element is also a key part of the erecting mechanism.<br>
Quite simply, at their crucial load-bearing and transferring points, these structures will<br>
be cinched up, and that is why they will be cinch to put up. This is as if the keystone<br>
were part of the erecting mechanism needed to lift it as well as a crucial part of the<br>
finished structure.<br>
In most embodiments the forces from the weight of the roof are directed<br>
downward and outward toward such as a rope or cable running all around the<br>
periphery of the tops of the structure's sides. Thus the more weight or downward<br>
force for wind on the top, the stronger the yurt structure (within the limits of the<br>
strength of the materials distributing the additional forces) to withstand forces<br>
(primarily wind) from other directions. Thus yurts (more politically correctly called<br>
gers, at least in Mongolia) probably originated and are definitely at home in some of<br>
the most wind swept Asiatic high planes and mountain valleys with very severe<br>
continental climatic patterns.<br>
The sky hatch accepts in some embodiments flexible focusing rods. These are<br>
like dome tent poles made of fiberglass, and might be broken down with the sections<br>
held together with central elastic cord. Such rods run over the pairs of rafters out to<br>
the upward mast extenders. They insert into the top side skins like sail stays.<br>
Mast Slides:<br>
As already described, mast slides are an important juncture between masts and<br>
rafters above deck, and serve to haul up such as sub-decks, pallets, and nets below<br>
deck. Normally, topmast slides are positioned very near topmast, just below the mast<br>
cap, so they are lockable in that position. However, there are some situations in which<br>
it is desirable to lower the topside without lowering the masts. If one faced heavy off-<br>
shore winds while returning to land over shallow water, for example, the masts stay<br>
up but the dome is lowered, and it is the mast slides that allow this. Any number of<br>
simple hardware options involving clamping or compression fittings makes this easy<br>
to achieve: the slides are kept in the desired position by tightening knobs or thumb<br>
screws. For marine use, means must be provided to release all the top slides<br>
simultaneously so that the top-side can be lowered quickly. One of many ways to<br>
accomplish this is to have sprung levers on each slide attached to light cables running<br>
up through the rafters, converging at a point on the sky hatch, with a rope with a<br>
handle hanging downward. A tug on the handle would release the mast slide locks,<br>
preparatory to winching down the topside. "Lowering the boom" would thus nolbe<br>
quite so potentially dangerous as on many sailboats. The slots visible on the inside of<br>
the mast slides are where the cinch passes through the mast slides.<br>
Runners:<br>
Floats, pontoons, skids, sled-blades, hulls and wheels are all examples of<br>
runners, which sit below lower extenders and allow mobility for structures based on<br>
the present invention. In the most basic form, floats may be no more than inner tubes<br>
protected by plastic snow disks or thick plastic can covers. A little more expensive<br>
are the various nylon-covered towable tubes offered by numerous manufacturers.<br>
Where directional capabilities over water are desired, pontoons made of<br>
heavy, large-diameter capped PVC pipe (perhaps filled with smaller diameter capped<br>
pipes or non-porous plastic foam products) should do very nicely.<br>
4-PASS devices have an unprecedented capability of freeing their runners<br>
from the main unit, as if you had a yacht you could sail some place and then split into<br>
six or eight sea kayaks or sailing dinghies for exploration or your own little regatta.<br>
Actually it is better than that, because members of the party get to keep using the<br>
yacht while others are out exploring. The stilted key characteristic of 4-PASS devices<br>
is what makes possible this extra modularity and functionality. Assume one has a 4-<br>
PASS device set up somewhere for cross-country shaped tubes on top of a 5 foot<br>
snow pack. If the kids want to go tubing; they can: just jack down your masts till<br>
they reach hard ground, and you can free your runners for the kids to use.<br>
Note that this description assumes whatever tubes you used were U-shaped<br>
rather than O-shaped, because the mast extension must pass when the tubes are<br>
removed. Such towables already are commercially available. All oriented in the same<br>
direction for normal use, they would give a modicum of directional stability when<br>
used as runners. Of course, this means that 4-PASS devices are compatible with more<br>
capable inflatables: particularly around the center under the hub, one large runner<br>
could be used even if the peripheral tubes under each mast were left in place, as the<br>
latter might be quite sufficient to keep the main unit up in water too deep for stilts to<br>
be of any use. The almost closed U shape could be achieved with a simple truck tire<br>
tube, cut in the middle and both ends bonded shut with rubber cement.<br>
Of course, for sports, recreational or middle or high-end commercial use, in<br>
addition to many proprietary designs, all sorts of existing pontoons and hulls could be<br>
adapted for use with 4-PASS devices: the key is having perpendicular downward<br>
extenders from a rigid platform to securely lash or attach them to, which is exactly<br>
what our design provides. In some models, the runners are personal watercraft like<br>
inflatable or molded double sea kayaks, so people on expeditions can land or elevate<br>
their shelter on its stilts and then paddle off on its flotation units! 4-PASS devices<br>
will be engineered to provide easy and secure docking of runners of all kinds.<br>
Wheels for 4-PASS devices typically insert below masts, and are used mainly<br>
for positioning, rather than for serious overland transport (though platform based fuel<br>
cell driven vehicles are being designed). But long distance overland transport under<br>
power is seen as only as a rather remote adaptation for 4-PASS technology, which has<br>
so much more immediate to offer in many other areas.<br>
Directional Blades:<br>
Corresponding in function and design to kneel, centerboard, steering oars,<br>
rudders and the like, bladed devices, either mono-directional or rotating, may be<br>
affixed as downward extenders from hub or parallel sets of masts.<br>
Below Deck:<br>
Below deck usage may be very significant, but is partly dependent on the<br>
runners selected, whether amphibious capabilities are intended, and anticipated uses.<br>
• Effluent Control systems are crucial if 4-PASS devices are to fulfill their<br>
environmentally friendly potential and purpose. Over water, expandable<br>
bladders, provided they were adequately shielded from below, would work<br>
without the necessity of supporting the weight of the black water or grey<br>
water. Well-engineered systems and hook ups like those in the RV industry<br>
must be demanded of every licensee.<br>
• Fresh Water Storage likewise could be handled with non-rigid containers<br>
protected against impact, cutting or scraping from below, with gains over<br>
water storage on deck.<br>
• Below Deck Dry Storage Bays, Nets, etc. would be important on longer<br>
voyages, and should be arranged to maintain weight balance and lower<br>
center of gravity.<br>
• Utility inputs for gas, electricity and water should be facilitated by the highly<br>
symmetrical layout below deck.<br>
Understanding how the M-MONAD works and whence the 4-PASS C&amp;Cs and<br>
the whole 4-PASS System derive their far-ranging capabilities, there are alternative<br>
folding frame designs that might offer similar, equal, or even added, power or utility.<br>
Mast-less MONAD embodiments are introduced, and are still full-fledged MONADs,<br>
although they do differ in some particulars, particularly as pertains to the sides, so<br>
they may look rather different. It is still intersecting planes which hold up these non-<br>
masted versions, but instead of the planes meeting centrally, they intersect where the<br>
sides meet. Top-sides including sky hatches and hubs are almost or completely<br>
unchanged in these variants, which primary involve the lateral "walls'" of the fame's<br>
skeleton, when masts no longer are employed.<br>
The X-MONAD variant takes its name from the fact that in lieu of masts,<br>
scissors-shaped flat slat pairs connect tracks to rafters. Instead of the pin of the<br>
scissors, a sliding joint is employed to permit folding or unfolding. The cross<br>
members (slats) are fixed together (bolted or clamped) by tightening a knob or similar<br>
device for rigidity once the frame is up. (Actually three slats be used in place of a<br>
pairs as described: two thinner ones in one direction sandwiching a thicker one in the<br>
other direction). Cylindrical tubular or rod tracks are used, but there is no need for<br>
square monorail or parallel dual member tracking, because there is no need to keep<br>
any mast in the same plane as tracks and rafters. Instead, the mast slide is a thrust<br>
bearing with a fin. Hinges to the adjacent base X-members are attached to the fin so<br>
that they may rotate on an axis perpendicular to the fin, which means parallel to the<br>
track.<br>
This allows all the motion necessary to allow folding as a single unit on the<br>
exact same lines as the elegant method for masted MONADs. Slats are used so that<br>
each scissors pair is held in a separate plane, but all these planes intersect precisely at<br>
the axis defined by a rafter end and track end. The rafter-slat intersection is like the<br>
finned track slide arrangement just described, but it is a fixed instead of sliding joint.<br>
Instead of confining movement to planes converging at the axis of hub &amp; sky<br>
hatch the M-MONAD does, the X-MONAD is held up by generating planes that<br>
intersect precisely above the vertices of the polygonal platform; where the masts<br>
would have been if we were using masts. Provided the polygon has any number of<br>
sides except four, a very strong frame results.<br>
X-MONADs have their pluses and minuses compared with other types. Doors<br>
are a bit of problem, since one facet requires special treatment. Cables can be used<br>
from the top arm vertically down to the foot, or better uncrossed poles can be<br>
provided. A pull up bar then will add strength placed above head height. XHX<br>
gives the idea of how doors may be handled. Without masts there is no ready way to<br>
vary the height of the topside on the fly. Elevation can be very effectively<br>
accomplished, but without masts, stilts are used: these may be mounted at track ends<br>
fitted with thrust bearings, and the stilts can be deployed up or down much like masts<br>
in M-MONADs. X-MONADs excel for uses like aquaria, tanks, pools, etc. where a<br>
way to handle extreme outward lateral forces is required. In places like the Aleutian<br>
Islands or Tierra Del Fuego where very high winds are the norm, X-MONADs might<br>
be most effective. Particularly when stacked, with two or more platforms sharing hub,<br>
they will be very resistant to inward pressures as well, suggesting important marine<br>
uses such as for semi-submerged vessels. Since poured concrete forms are such a<br>
case, their application in this area is anticipated. X-MONADs have different<br>
staggering characteristics than Masted MONADs.<br>
X-MONAD set-up is very comparable in ease and rapidity to erection of other<br>
types, but X-MONADs are the very best suited to instant pneumatic set-up using<br>
modified airbag technology. For applications like humanitarian rescue and relief in<br>
contaminated zones they would save vital time, and so may be unsurpassed among 4-<br>
PASS MONADs found so far.<br>
The Sigma-MONAD or S-MONAD:<br>
From the front the Sigma-MONAD or S-MONAD utilizes a shape familiar<br>
from extension tongs, drawing devices called pantographs, or scissor lifts. So it<br>
appears shaped like a numeral 3 and S superimposed on one another, but it is not<br>
limited to two in terms of the number diamond shaped parallelograms formed. These<br>
units are located at the axis's perpendicular to the tracks on the axis running through<br>
the vertices of the platform bases; in other words, exactly where masts were located<br>
on the M-MONAD. Folded, they extend laterally half way along the sides above and<br>
below platform height.<br>
From the top, one would see that each set are actually angled to match the<br>
angle of the vertices. On the sides these struts are pinioned together in the normal<br>
scissors fashion, but at the angle they utilized ball hinges (or other suitable means) to<br>
compensate for the compound mitered angles at which they travel in relation to each<br>
other. The scissors units compress like an accordion, and can extend much higher<br>
than masts normally would, and much lower than stilts normally would. In the<br>
compressed position what one sees are very vertically compressed and horizontally<br>
elongated diamond shanes, which, as the horizontal points of those shapes are drawn<br>
together, the diamonds become verv tall in the vertical direction and very narrow<br>
horizontally. Of course, winches again could be used to, but this type of mechanism is<br>
particularly suited for use in conjunction with threaded rods. Some car and truck<br>
jacks work on this principle. Take note that in is only one diamond in the chain that<br>
needs to be re-dimensioned and (like Mary's little lambs) the rest are sure to follow.<br>
Sure, that is, to the extent that the members are stout and stiff enough, to bear the<br>
loads coming from so many different angles as they must in traveling from near<br>
horizontal to near vertical, or vice versa. Once topside and deck are up to the desired<br>
height, the cables running diagonally from "elbows" to deck are drawn taut, resulting<br>
in a structure tight as a drum.<br>
From a theoretical design standpoint, the X- and 2-MONADs represent a<br>
variation of by now familiar 4-PASS strategies: the tendency to unite the erection<br>
mechanism and the finished structure, and the idea of confining motion in certain<br>
intersecting planes while the rest are left variable through the use of hinged joints<br>
among members. Notice how unaffected the hub-track and topside assemblies arc.<br>
This may be taken as confirmation that the different MONAD types represent various<br>
embodiments of the MONAD ideal, however different seeming in the planes they<br>
confine or leave free or in the appearance of their skeletal frameworks. It is<br>
hypothesized that the larger systems' compatibility and other requirements of a highly<br>
modular system imply a set of principles likely to be demonstrated in any incarnation<br>
of the modular unit capable of serving as the fundamental building block for such a<br>
broadly conceived system of systems.<br>
S-MONADs may be stacked for storage like pancakes, rather than like umbrellas.<br>
Several advantages and limitations of this MONAD type should be pointed out. On<br>
the negative side, weight and cost may be higher due to the more complex joints and<br>
stronger struts necessary. However, this may prove to be the giraffe among MONAD<br>
s, excelling in the areas of self-elevated and stilt utilization. A nice capability is that<br>
once up the sigma columns can be drawn together (by sliding in the track slides), and<br>
thus a very strong tower with a wide base can be quickly created. The number of<br>
obliquely joined triangles that can be created by bringing the "elbows" of six or eight<br>
such scissors assemblies together is truly impressive. In fact, so great is the potential<br>
strength of such a structures, that the possibilities for a portable crane arm cannot be<br>
lightly dismissed! Again, definite possibilities for instant concrete forms present<br>
themselves. In fact, there is no reason that several concentric sets of scissors<br>
assemblies could not be arrayed on a single platform base, making possible pouring of<br>
towers ringed like trees, with the assembly members and cables serving as rebar as<br>
they became encased. Such formations can be the basis for very strong ladders as<br>
well. It is anticipated that the S may be the MONAD of choice for broadcast antennae<br>
and wind turbines that need to be set up very quickly.<br>
The W-MONAD:<br>
The W-MONAD can be understood as a kind of hybrid between the M-<br>
MONAD and the X-MONAD with a little of the S reclining on its side. It is not<br>
unmasted. It has masts all right, plus it has sliding accordion criss-cross diagonal<br>
frame reminiscent of the S but rotated 90 degrees. Each mast has two such<br>
assemblages. Each of these faces toward an adjacent vertex, and there is a channel<br>
provided at deck level along the lines of some sliding closet doors. Drawing the W-<br>
shaped assemblages together produces a diagonally cross-brace much like the X-<br>
MONAD enjoys.<br>
IWWIWWI...<br>
Many variations are possible, but the idea is to make a strong cross-brace available<br>
when necessary, and yet be able to fold it away next to the mast other times. They<br>
make excellent doors, which of course is of particular interest in rescue work in<br>
contaminated disaster scenes where progressive airlocks may be vital.<br>
For high wind areas and marine use, the cross-bracing has obvious advantages.<br>
Indeed, the W-MONAD's accordion wall frame apparatus may be offered as an addon <br>
extension for M-MONADs. The W-MONADs' sliding cross-braces may be useful<br>
below as well as above the platform level, and should see wide application whenever<br>
multiple stories for C&amp;Cs are called for. Beneath the waterline, the W braces can<br>
stiffen skirts greatly. For winterization, the W-brace will aid in creating needed dead<br>
space.<br>
W-MONADs fold like M-MONADs, but of course cannot be expected to<br>
make as tight a cylindrical folded unit, and are necessarily heavier. The deck level<br>
channel articulates and folds in sections as well. A limitation of W-MONADs is that<br>
they reduce the extent to which the topside can be lowered down the masts. W-<br>
MONADs have limitations when it comes to staggering them to form composite<br>
structures, but the sliding cross brace is so easily removed that this may not pose too<br>
big a problem. With time it is anticipated that more fundamental MONAD variant<br>
types may well be discovered.<br>
Non-Regular Polygonal MONADs of Closely Allied Shape:<br>
Even in its severe minimalism and purism when it comes to making regular<br>
polygonal shape for the MONAD the rule, 4-PASS theory does allow for well-<br>
reasoned exceptions, perhaps betraying again its language-like nature. The inventor<br>
pleads that these exceptions be made few and far between, and only after considering<br>
whether the addition will usefully extend uses in the Modular mode in view of tiling<br>
theory. Hoping this does not confuse anyone as to what should be the general rule,<br>
and what might be the rare exception, I advance only two at this point, an equilateral<br>
hexagon and a rhomb. Both preserve maintain the cardinal qualities that we have used<br>
to define the MONAD.<br>
The Equilateral Hexagonal MONAD:<br>
This MONAD creates a polygon with vertices of angles of 3p/5, 3p/5, 4p/5,<br>
3p/5, 37p/5, and 4p/5. Sides are all still equal, but 4 angles are more acute, and 2<br>
angles are more oblique than for the regular 6-sided polygon: the hexagon. This form<br>
bears a definite relationship with pentagon, as can be seen if we generate five of these<br>
MONADs, rotate each one 72 degrees (72X5-360) and arrange them as shown center.<br>
You can construct your own Equilateral Hexagon out of 6 regular pentagons of an<br>
identical size, by creating two pairs of pentagons, each pair with one adjacent side,<br>
placing the pairs so that the concave portions are facing [somewhat like this ], and<br>
completing the form by putting one of the remaining pentagons so the vertices of one<br>
side coincide with one vertex from each pair, and the last remaining pentagons do the<br>
same on the opposite side. .<br>
This secret affinity between hexagon and pentagon is something a mystic like<br>
Pythagoras, or indeed his disciple, Kepler, might have best appreciated, but our<br>
interest is more utilitarian. According to Grunbaum and Shephard, an uncountable<br>
infinity of tilings is possible with hexagons of this proportion. Herringbone patterns<br>
are easily produced, but there is no difficulty changing direction at will:<br>
This gives greater variety of architectural possibilities than that hexagonal<br>
marvel of nature, the honeycomb.<br>
In the autonomous, stand-alone mode, the equilateral, unilateral hexagonal<br>
MONAD offers, with the addition of one or two triangular MONADs, a shape of great<br>
interest from a folding boat and ship design standpoint:<br>
Next we come to another embodiment of the MONAD that also has equal<br>
sides but two different angles.<br>
The Rhomb MONAD:<br>
This equilateral parallelogram has angles p/5, 4 p/5, p/5 and 4 p /5.<br>
Once again we encounter an even-sided figure that can be constructed from the<br>
pentagon. In fact, it is in relationship to the pentagonal MONADs that the Rhomb<br>
MONAD becomes of greatest interest. Two pentagons and two rhombs combine to<br>
make a form with special nautical, packing and docking qualities. You can construct<br>
your own rhomb out of 4 pentagons of identical size, by creating two pairs each with<br>
one adjacent side, and placing them so that the concave sides of the pairs are facing,<br>
with two opposite vertices coinciding.<br>
Modular rafts or decks on any scale are rendered possible with MONADs of<br>
these two shapes, and the MODULAR compounds or watercraft may detach or<br>
reattach very readily. The docking is very like the way receptors for antigens are often<br>
represented.<br>
In its autonomous mode, stacked (i.e. with top and bottom platform) the<br>
Rhomb MONAD offers the basis for a folding double sea kayak, pontoons, and other<br>
hulls.<br>
It will be apparent to the skilled artisan, given the teachings above, together<br>
with the many figures provided as well, that there are a great many variations that may<br>
be made in embodiments of the invention disclosed, without departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the invention. Many variations have already been described. Variations<br>
in structural materials may be made, variations in size and shape, and variations in<br>
combinations of features of the invention described above may also be made without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore the invention should<br>
be accorded the scope of the claims that follow.<br>
