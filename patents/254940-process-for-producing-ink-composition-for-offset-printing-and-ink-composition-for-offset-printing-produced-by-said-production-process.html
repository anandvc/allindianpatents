DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing<br>
an ink composition for offset printing and the ink composition<br>
for offset printing obtained by the method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
In order to produce a black ink composition for offset<br>
printing, it is necessary to enhance the fluidity and the color<br>
developing effect of a carbon black by adequately dispersing<br>
the carbon black in an oil-based varnish for a printing ink.<br>
[0003]<br>
Generally, a carbon black used in the black ink<br>
composition for offset printing used for sheet-fed printing is<br>
an acid carbon black, the surface of which is oxidation treated<br>
with ozone or chemicals (for example, refer to Patent Document<br>
1).<br>
[0004]<br>
In the black ink composition for offset printing to be<br>
obtained by using this acid carbon black, a carbon black has<br>
excellent age stability, and particularly the printed<br>
substances obtained by performing sheet-fed printing with this<br>
ink composition have good printing quality such as gloss and<br>
a jet-black property.<br>
[0005]<br>
However, in recent years, further improvement in printing<br>
quality of the black ink composition for offset printing to be<br>
obtained by using an acid carbon black and improved productivity<br><br>
and a more efficient production process in using the acid carbon<br>
black to produce the black ink composition for offset printing<br>
are required.<br>
[0006]<br>
The acid carbon black includes an acid powder carbon black<br>
and an acid bead carbon black, which are different in their<br>
shapes from each other. The acid powder carbon black of these<br>
acid carbon blacks has high dispersion, but it has a problem<br>
that dust particles are produced to deteriorate a working<br>
environment since it is powdery. Therefore, use of the acid<br>
bead carbon black in bead form formed by granulating the powder<br>
carbon is being investigated recently for the purpose of<br>
improving from these problems. However, while improvement in<br>
the problem of working environment can be achieved by use of<br>
the acid bead carbon black, dispersion of the carbon black<br>
becomes difficult. Among others, an acid bead carbon black of<br>
a type, in which a carbon black is spontaneously oxidized<br>
without a particular treatment in the production stage and<br>
therefore its surface is acid, is low priced, but the dispersion<br>
of the carbon black becomes more difficult.<br>
[0007]<br>
Accordingly, there are many advantages if the acid<br>
(especially, spontaneously oxidized) bead carbon black can be<br>
utilized in a field of an ink, but when the acid bead carbon<br>
black is dispersed by a conventional dispersion method, it had<br>
a problem that the productivity decreases considerably since<br>
the carbon black is settled during mixing with an oil-based<br>
varnish for a printing ink and therefore the acid bead carbon<br>
black cannot be adequately dispersed.<br>
[0008]<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Kokai Publication No.<br>
Hei-10-025441<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]<br><br>
As described above, even when an acid carbon black is to<br>
be used, a conventional production method may require extra<br>
facilities and production cost and cannot take advantage of the<br>
acid carbon black.<br>
[0010]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a method of producing an ink composition for offset<br>
printing, which can improve the productivity of inks<br>
considerably while using the acid carbon black, particularly<br>
an acid bead carbon black. Further, it is another object of<br>
the present invention to provide an ink composition for offset<br>
printing in which the printing quality of printed substances<br>
obtained in using the foregoing ink composition for offset<br>
printing for sheet-fed printing is equal to or higher than that<br>
of printed substances obtained by milling the acid powder carbon<br>
black in a conventional manner, that is, milling the acid powder<br>
carbon black in a dry condition in an oil-based varnish for a<br>
printing ink.<br>
[0011]<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the<br>
present inventors made earnest investigations, and<br>
consequently they have found that all of the problems can be<br>
solved by wetting the acid carbon black, particularly the acid<br>
bead carbon black, with a wetting agent containing at least<br>
water, and then using an oil-based varnish for a printing ink<br>
containing an alkyd resin having an acid value of 30 KOH mg/g<br>
or less to perform flushing. These findings have now led to<br>
completion of the present invention.<br>
[0012]<br>
That is, the present invention pertains to (1) a method<br>
of producing an ink composition for offset printing, including<br>
the steps of<br>
wetting 100 parts by mass of an acid carbon black having<br>
a pH value of 2 .0 to 6.0 with 25 to 400 parts by mass of a wetting<br>
agent containing at least water,<br><br>
using an oil-based varnish for a printing ink containing<br>
an alkyd resin having an acid value of 30 KOH mg/g or less to<br>
perform flushing of the wetted acid bead carbon black, and then<br>
removing the wetting agent.<br>
[0013]<br>
In addition, the present invention pertains to (2) the<br>
method of producing an ink composition for offset printing as<br>
described in (1), further including the step of<br>
milling with a roll mill or a bead mill after completion<br>
of the steps of wetting, performing flushing and then removing<br>
the wetting agent.<br>
[0014]<br>
In addition, the present invention pertains to (3) method<br>
of producing an ink composition for offset printing as described<br>
in (1) or (2),<br>
wherein an acid carbon black having a bulk density of 0.1<br>
to 0. 8 g/cm3 and an average primary particle diameter of 15 to<br>
70 nm is used as the acid carbon black.<br>
[0015]<br>
In addition, the present invention pertains to (4) the<br>
method of producing an ink composition for offset printing as<br>
described in any one of (1) to (3),<br>
wherein the acid carbon black is an acid bead carbon black<br>
having a bulk density of 0.2 to 0.8 g/cm3 and an average primary<br>
particle diameter of 15 to 70 nm.<br>
[0016]<br>
In addition, the present invention pertains to (5) the<br>
method of producing an ink composition for offset printing as<br>
described in any one of (1) to (4),<br>
wherein a vegetable oil modified alkyd resin is used as<br>
the alkyd resin.<br>
[0017]<br>
In addition, the present invention pertains to (6) the<br>
method of producing an ink composition for offset printing as<br>
described in any one of (1) to (5),<br><br>
wherein the content of the alkyd resin is 1 to 60% by mass<br>
with respect to the acid carbon black.<br>
[0018]<br>
Further, the present invention pertains to (7) an ink<br>
composition for offset printing prepared by the method of<br>
producing an ink composition for offset printing as described<br>
in any one of (1) to (6) .<br>
[0019]<br>
Further, the present invention pertains to (8) the ink<br>
composition for offset printing as described in (7),<br>
wherein the ink composition for offset printing is an ink<br>
composition for sheet-fed offset printing.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0020]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in<br>
more detail.<br>
[0021]<br><constituent materials used in the method of producing an ink></constituent>
composition for offset printing of the present invention&gt;<br>
Constituent materials used in the method of producing an<br>
ink composition for offset printing of the present invention<br>
will be described.<br>
First, the carbon black is not particularly limited as<br>
long as it is an acid carbon black having a pH value of 2.0 to<br>
6.0, but the production method of the present invention is<br>
effective for a acid carbon black having a bulk density of 0.1<br>
to 0.8 g/cm3 and an average primary particle diameter of 15 to<br>
70 run, and in particular, more effective for a acid bead carbon<br>
black having a bulk density of 0.2 to 0.8 g/cm3 and an average<br>
primary particle diameter of 15 to 70 nm in view of the objects<br>
of the present invention.<br>
[0022]<br>
The bulk density was measured according to JIS K 6219.<br>
[0023]<br><br>
The average primary particle diameter is an arithmetic<br>
mean value of particle diameters determined by the observation<br>
of particles through an electron microscope.<br>
[0024]<br>
Incidentally, the ""bead carbon black" refers to a carbon<br>
black in the form of bead prepared by granulating the powder<br>
carbon black.<br>
[0025]<br>
As an acid carbon black, the carbon black, the surface<br>
of which is oxidation treated with ozone or chemicals, can be<br>
employed, but if a carbon black is acid, the carbon black not<br>
subjected to such a particular oxidation treatment may be<br>
employed. That is, an acid carbon black of a type, in which<br>
a carbon black is spontaneously oxidized and therefore its<br>
surface is acid as described above, may be employed. There are<br>
a variety of methods of producing the acid bead carbon black,<br>
and examples thereof include an acid bead carbon black prepared<br>
by a furnace method which is currently a common production<br>
method, and a pseudo-channel acid bead carbon black by a Degussa<br>
gas black process developed by Degussa AG.<br>
[0026]<br>
Next, in the present invention, in order to wet the acid<br>
carbon black, a wetting agent containing at least water is used.<br>
As the wetting agent, water can be used and a solvent compatible<br>
with water which can be used in combination with water can be<br>
used as required, but it is preferred to reduce an amount of<br>
the solvent compatible with water as far as possible from the<br>
viewpoint of environment and the wettability of the acid carbon<br>
black. Specifically, the wetting agent preferably contains<br>
water in an amount of 50% by mass or more of the total amount<br>
of the wetting agent, and it is particularly preferred that the<br>
wetting agent contains only water. When the amount of water<br>
is less than 50% by mass, wettability tends to decrease. In<br>
addition, kinds of water to be used is not particularly limited,<br>
and for example, running water, ion-exchange water, distilled<br><br>
water can be used, but it is preferred to use ion-exchange water<br>
in that the content of water-soluble ionic substances having<br>
negative effects on printing is small.<br>
[0027]<br>
The solvent compatible with water is not particularly<br>
limited, and examples of the solvent include ethanol, ethylene<br>
glycol and the like.<br>
[0028]<br>
An amount of the wetting agent with which the acid carbon<br>
black is wetted is 25 to 400 parts by mass with respect to 100<br>
parts by mass of the acid carbon black, and is preferably 40<br>
to 250 parts by mass in consideration of quality of a paper face<br>
and ease of removal of the wetting agent containing water. When<br>
the amount of the wetting agent is less than 25 parts by mass,<br>
good dispersibility cannot be attained and there is a problem<br>
of deteriorating workability due to flying of the acid carbon<br>
black. On the other hand, when the amount of the wetting agent<br>
is more than 400 parts by mass, there are problems that the<br>
productivity is decreased since the time required to remove the<br>
wetting agent becomes longer and an extra treatment is needed<br>
since an amount of the wetting agent to be removed increases.<br>
[0029]<br>
Next, as the alkyd resin which is a component of the<br>
oil-based varnish for a printing ink, an alkyd resin having an<br>
acid value of 30 KOH mg/g or less is used. An alkyd resin having<br>
an acid value of 10 KOH mg/g or less can be preferably used.<br>
The species of alkyd resin is not particularly limited, but it<br>
is preferably a vegetable oil modified alkyd resin. As the<br>
vegetable oil modified alkyd resin, specifically, a soybean oil<br>
modified alkyd resin, a linseed oil modified alkyd resin, and<br>
a tung oil modified alkyd resin can be exemplified. Among<br>
vegetable oil modified alkyd resins, a vegetable oil modified<br>
alkyd resin having a basic skeleton consisting of isophthalic<br>
acid is preferred. In addition, in the ink for sheet-fed<br>
printing to form an ink coat by oxidative polymerization, an<br><br>
alkyd resin modified with a semi-drying oil or a drying oil is<br>
preferred.<br>
[0030]<br>
An amount of the alkyd resin to be used is preferably in<br>
a range of 1 to 60% by mass with respect to 100% by mass of the<br>
acid carbon black. When this amount is less than 1% by mass<br>
with respect to the acid carbon black, the dispersibility is<br>
not adequate, and on the other hand, when this amount is more<br>
than 60% by mass, excessive emulsification of dampening water<br>
to the resulting ink composition for offset printing occurs and<br>
this tends to have a detrimental effect on printing suitability.<br>
However, since an adequate amount of the alkyd resin to be used<br>
varies with the species of the alkyd resin, the species of the<br>
acid carbon black, or the species or use amount of other<br>
materials used in combination, it is preferred to select an<br>
adequate amount of the alkyd resin to be used within the<br>
above-mentioned range.<br>
[0031]<br>
Here, an acid value was measured according to JIS K<br>
5601-2-1.<br>
[0032]<br>
As an oil-based varnish for a printing ink used for the<br>
production method of the present invention, a binder resin and<br>
an oily liquid are used in combination with the alkyd resin.<br>
[0033]<br>
As the above-mentioned binder resin, rosin modified<br>
phenolic resins, rosin modified maleic resins, and polyester<br>
resins not containing phenol, used in inks for offset printing,<br>
can be used without particular limitation. In addition,<br>
petroleum resins can be used together as required.<br>
[0034]<br>
It is proper that the total amount of the alkyd resin and<br>
the binder resin to be used in the ink composition for offset<br>
printing is generally in a range of 20 to 60% by mass.<br>
[0035]<br><br>
An amount of the oily liquid is not particularly limited,<br>
but it is preferred that the oily liquid is used so as to be<br>
20 to 70% by mass with respect to the whole oil-based varnish<br>
for a printing ink.<br>
[0036]<br>
As the oily liquid, vegetable oil components and mineral<br>
oil components can be used.<br>
Examples of the vegetable oil components include<br>
vegetable oils and fatty acid ester compounds derived from a<br>
vegetable oil.<br>
As the vegetable oil, drying oils or semi-drying oils<br>
suitable for offset printing such as a soybean oil, a cotton<br>
seed oil, a linseed oil, a safflower oil, a tung oil, a tall<br>
oil, a dehydrated caster oil and a canola oil can be exemplified.<br>
These oils may be used singly or in combination of two or more<br>
species.<br>
[0037]<br>
Examples of the fatty acid ester compounds derived from<br>
a vegetable oil include monoalkyl ester compounds of fatty acids<br>
derived from the drying oils or semi-drying oils. As a fatty<br>
acid composing such fatty acid monoester, a saturated or<br>
unsaturated fatty acid having 16 to 20 carbon atoms is preferred,<br>
and stearic acid, isostearic acid, hydroxystearic acid, oleic<br>
acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, eleostearic acid and the<br>
like can be exemplified. Alkyl groups derived from an alcohol,<br>
which composes the fatty acid monoester, are preferably groups<br>
having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and alkyl groups of methyl, ethyl,<br>
propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, 2-ethylhexyl or<br>
the like can be exemplified. These fatty acid monoesters can<br>
be used alone or in combination of two or more species.<br>
[0038]<br>
Examples of the mineral oil components include substances<br>
which are not compatible with water, and have a boiling point<br>
of 160°C or higher, preferably a boiling point of 200°C or higher.<br>
Specifically, n-paraffinic solvents, isoparaffinic solvents,<br><br>
naphthenic solvents, aromatic solvents, α-olefinic petroleum<br>
solvents, light gas oil, spindle oil, machine oil, cylinder oil,<br>
turpentine oil, mineral spirits and the like can be exemplified.<br>
[0039]<br>
In addition, in the oil-based varnish for a printing ink,<br>
as for vegetable oil components and mineral oil components, a<br>
vegetable oil component may be used singly, and a fatty acid<br>
ester or a mineral oil may be used singly, and the vegetable<br>
oil component may be used in conjunction with the mineral oil<br>
component.<br>
[0040]<br>
Furthermore, additives such as a gelling agent, a drier,<br>
a drying-retarder, an antioxidant, an anti scumming aid, a<br>
friction resistance improver, an antioffset agent and a<br>
nonionic surfactant, and the like can be appropriately used as<br>
required.<br>
[0041]<br><method of producing an ink composition for offset printing></method>
the present invention&gt;<br>
Next, the method of producing an ink composition for<br>
offset printing of the present invention will be described.<br>
The present invention pertains to a method of producing<br>
an ink composition for offset printing, including the steps of<br>
wetting 100 parts by mass of an acid carbon black having a pH<br>
value of 2.0 to 6.0 with 25 to 400 parts by mass of a wetting<br>
agent containing at least water, using an oil-based varnish for<br>
a printing ink containing an alkyd resin having an acid value<br>
of 30 KOH mg/g or less to perform flushing of the foregoing wetted<br>
acid carbon black, and then removing the wetting agent.<br>
[0042]<br>
In the method of producing an ink composition for offset<br>
printing of the present invention, an apparatus to wet the acid<br>
carbon black is not particularly limited, but either a disper<br>
or a flusher (kneader) is preferably used.<br>
[0043]<br><br>
In the method of producing an ink composition for offset<br>
printing of the present invention, "flushing" refers to a step<br>
of mixing/stirring a acid carbon black wetted with a wetting<br>
agent containing at least water and an oil-based varnish to<br>
convert the acid carbon black from a water phase to an oily phase .<br>
An apparatus used in flushing is not particularly limited, and<br>
for example, a flusher or a stirring apparatus having a<br>
mechanism capable of removing the wetting agent can be used.<br>
[0044]<br>
In the method of producing an ink composition for offset<br>
printing of the present invention, performing flushing, and the<br>
wetting agent is removed until the content of the wetting agent<br>
containing water in the flushed composition becomes preferably<br>
2% by mass or less. Further, in the production method of the<br>
present invention, it is preferred to undergo the step of<br>
milling after the steps of wetting, performing flushing and then<br>
removing the wetting agent. An apparatus for milling is not<br>
particularly limited, and for example, a roll mill or a bead<br>
mill can be used. In this step, the carbon black is milled until<br>
a particle diameter of the ink composition for offset printing<br>
becomes, for example, 5 pin or less which is smaller than a printed<br>
film thickness. This particle diameter can be measured with,<br>
for example, a grind gauge.<br>
[0045]<br>
In the present invention, an "oil-based varnish for a<br>
printing ink containing an alkyd resin having an acid value of<br>
30 KOH mg/g or less" used at the time of flushing may become<br>
a state in which an oil-based varnish for a printing ink contains<br>
an alkyd resin having an acid value of 30 KOH mg/g or less in<br>
a predetermined amount as a result at the time of flushing.<br>
Therefore, methods of adding the respective components at the<br>
time of preparing is not particularly limited, and the ink<br>
composition may be prepared by any method.<br>
[0046]<br>
That is, the oil-based varnish for a printing ink may be<br><br>
prepared by dissolving the binder resin and the alkyd resin in<br>
a vegetable oil component and/or a mineral oil component in<br>
advance before performing flushing so that the content of the<br>
alkyd resin becomes a predetermined amount. Alternatively,<br>
for example, when the alkyd resin is liquid, in performing<br>
flushing, the oil-based varnish for a printing ink may be<br>
prepared in such a way that the content of the alkyd resin becomes<br>
a predetermined amount ultimately by a method in which the alkyd<br>
resin and a binder resin oil-based varnish formed by dissolving<br>
the binder resin in a vegetable oil component and/or a mineral<br>
oil component are separately added.<br>
[0047]<br>
A method of producing an ink composition for offset<br>
printing using the oil-based varnish for a printing ink prepared<br>
by dissolving the binder resin and the alkyd resin in a vegetable<br>
oil component and/or a mineral oil component in advance is not<br>
particularly limited, and example of this method include a<br>
method including the steps of putting/stirring the acid carbon<br>
black and the wetting agent containing at least water in a disper<br>
or a f lusher (kneader) to wet the acid carbon black, then adding<br>
the oil-based varnish for a printing ink to the wetted substance<br>
of the acid carbon black, flushing the resulting mixture with<br>
the f lusher (kneader) or a stirring apparatus having a mechanism<br>
capable of removing the wetting agent, and removing the wetting<br>
agent until the content of the wetting agent in the composition<br>
obtained by flushing becomes preferably 2% by mass or less.<br>
Further, there is a method in which after the above-mentioned<br>
method, the ink composition for offset printing is obtained by<br>
adding the oil-based varnish for a printing ink or the binder<br>
resin oil-based varnished as required, undergoing the step of<br>
milling/dispersing with a bead mill or a three-roll mill, and<br>
adjusting the obtained milled mixture to a prescribed viscosity<br>
by adding a residual material.<br>
[0048]<br>
In addition, examples of a method in which the liquid<br><br>
alkyd resin and the binder resin oil-based varnish are<br>
separately added at the time of flushing to prepare the<br>
oil-based varnish for a printing ink include, for example, a<br>
method in which the oil-based varnish for a printing ink is<br>
obtained by following the same procedure as in the<br>
above-mentioned method except that the liquid alkyd resin and<br>
the binder resin oil-based varnish are separately added when<br>
performing flushing.<br>
[0049]<br>
In addition, a proper amount (about 15% by mass or less<br>
with respect to the binder resin) of a gelling agent can be added<br>
to the binder resin oil-based varnish as required to crosslink<br>
the resin. In such a case, examples of the gelling agent to<br>
be used include aluminum alcoholates, aluminum chelate<br>
compounds and the like, and as preferable specific examples,<br>
aluminum triisopropoxide, mono-sec-butoxy aluminum<br>
diisopropoxide, aluminum sec-butoxide, ethyl acetoacetate<br>
aluminum diisopropoxide, aluminum tris-ethyl acetoacetate and<br>
the like can be exemplified.<br>
[0050]<br>
As described above, by the method of producing an ink<br>
composition for offset printing of the present invention, it<br>
is possible to improve the productivity of inks considerably<br>
compared with the conventional method while using the acid<br>
carbon black, particularly the acid bead carbon black. Further,<br>
the ink composition for offset printing to be obtained has<br>
performance which is equivalent to that using the ink<br>
composition formed by milling by a conventional method even<br>
though the productivity of inks is improved, its acid carbon<br>
black has good dispersibility and age stability, and when the<br>
ink composition for offset printing of the present invention<br>
is used for sheet-fed printing, printing quality such as gloss<br>
and a degree of jet black, which is equal to or higher than that<br>
of the ink composition for offset printing using the ink<br>
composition formed by milling by a conventional method.<br><br>

Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in<br>
more detail by way of Examples, but the present invention is<br>
not limited to these Examples. In addition, "%" and "part(s)"<br>

Examples and Reference Examples, a bulk density was measured<br>
according to JIS K 6219, and an acid value was measured according<br>

[0067]<br><evaluation><br>
The dispersibility, the gloss and the degree of jet black<br>
of each ink composition for offset printing of Examples 1 to<br>
8, and Comparative Examples 1 to 7 were evaluated according the<br>
following methods. The results of the evaluations are shown<br>
in Tables 6 and 7. In addition, the compositions of the<br>
oil-based varnishes for printing inks are shown in Table 1.<br>
Further, the compositions of the base inks 1 to 15 for offset<br>
printing described above are shown in Tables 2 and 3, and the<br>
compositions of the ink compositions 1 to 15 for offset printing<br><br>
described above are shown in Tables 4 and 5.<br>
[0068]<br>
(1)	Dispersibility<br>
A base ink was dispersed in such a way that a particle<br>
diameter measured by a grind gauge becomes 5 µm or less at a<br>
temperature of 45°C and at a constant closing pressure using<br>
a three-roll mill (manufactured by Inoue Kikai Co., Ltd.).<br>
Number of millings by the roll mill at the time when the particle<br>
diameter becomes 5 urn or less was taken as a measure of the<br>
dispersibility.<br>
[0069]<br>
(2)	Evaluation of gloss and degree of jet black<br>
Ink was developed on coated paper (O.K Topkote 73K) by<br>
a printing suitability tester PM-902PT (manufactured by SMT Co. .<br>
Ltd.) . A gloss value of this developed substance was measured<br>
with a gloss meter GM-26 (manufactured by Murakami Color<br>
Research Laboratory Co ., Ltd.) . In addition, as for the degree<br>
of jet black, L* was measured with a colorimetric<br>
spectrophotometer GretagMacbeth SpectroEye (manufactured by<br>
GretagMacbeth AG.) . Smaller L* indicates that a blackish tone<br>
is stronger.<br>
[0070]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0077]<br>
As shown in Tables 6 and 7, the total production times<br>
of the ink compositions 1 to 6, and 12 for offset printing of<br>
the present invention, obtained in Examples 1 to 7, can be<br>
shortened compared with those of the ink compositions 7 to 11<br>
for offset printing obtained in Comparative Examples. In<br>
addition, the total production time of the ink composition 13<br>
for offset printing of the present invention, obtained in<br>
Example 8 on an industrial scale, can be shortened compared with<br>
that of the ink composition 14 (the acid bead carbon black was<br>
used as an acid carbon) and the ink composition 15 (the acid<br>
powder carbon black was used as an acid carbon black) for offset<br>
printing obtained in Comparative Examples on an industrial<br>
scale. Further, it can be understood that the ink compositions<br>
1 to 6, 12 and 13 for offset printing of the present invention<br>
are superior in the dispersibility, the gloss and the degree<br>
of jet-black since the ink compositions for offset printing of<br>
the present invention have high gloss values and small values<br>
of L*.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
[0078]<br>
The production method of the present invention can<br>
provide an ink composition for offset printing, which can<br>
improve the productivity of inks considerably compared with the<br>
conventional production method, and has good dispersibility and<br>
excellent printing quality even when the acid carbon black,<br>
particularly the acid bead carbon black is used. The ink<br>
composition for offset printing prepared by the production<br>
method of the present invention can be used in sheet-fed<br>
printing, offset rotary printing (heatset type, non-heatset<br>
type) , newspaper printing and the like. Among others, when it<br>
is used in sheet-fed printing, printing quality such as a degree<br>
of jet black and gloss becomes good and it is suitable for the<br>
sheet-fed printing.<br><br>

OFFSET PRINTING, AND INK COMPOSITION FOR OFFSET<br>
PRINTING PRODUCED BY SAID PRODUCTION PROCESS<br>
The invention discloses a method of producing an ink composition for offset printing,<br>
comprising the steps of wetting 100 parts by mass of an acid carbon black having a pH value<br>
of 2.0 to 6.0 with 25 to 400 parts by mass of a wetting agent comprising water or water in<br>
admixture with a solvent, compatible with water, such as herein described, using an oil-based<br>
varnish for a printing ink containing an alkyd resin having an acid value of 30 KOH mg/g or<br>
less to perform flushing of said wetted acid bead carbon black, and then removing the wetting<br>
agent wherein said oil-based varnish for a printing ink is a binder resin and an oily liquid such<br>
as herein described, vegetable oil components and mineral oil components used in<br>
combination with the alkyd resin.</evaluation></comparative></comparative></example></example></comparative></comparative></comparative></comparative></comparative></example></example></example></example></example></example></td>
