				<td>Field of the present invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a an aerobic process for the reduction of colour from paper pulp effluent using inoculum .More particularly this invention relates to a process for the preparation of inoculum of the strain of accession no. MTCC 5099, and a process for the reduction of colour from pulp mill effluent using the above said inoculum, which comprises steps of inoculating appropriate aliquots of thepulp and paper mill effluent with the cell slurry obtained , as claimed in claim 2, for colour reduction studies along with a control flask set up in step (a) at 37°C/100 rpm for 48 hours, withdrawing samples from the above flasks in 50 ml aliquots and processing them for assessing colour and Total lignin levels analyzing the colour removal efficiency of the above said bacterium.<br>
Background and prior art references of the present invention:<br>
The problem of colour removal from pulp and paper mill waste has been a subject of great consideration and investigation in the last few decades. An estimated two trillion gallons of wastewaters are discharged annually by the pulp and paper industry in major paper-producing countries and much of this effluent is highly coloured. (Joyce et al;, 1983).<br>
The browinish colour of the wastewater is mainly organic in nature and primarily attributable to lignin degradation products formed during various pulping and bleaching operations (Srivastave et al.; 1984, Dilek et al;, 2000). The other colour imparting agents are wood-extractives, tannins, resins and synthetic dyes.<br>
Colour was never thought to be a major problem, being classified as a non-conventional pollutant. The reasons for colour regulations at some places are said to be, protection of fisheries or aesthetic consideration. Secondly, discharge of coloured pulping effluents to the receiving waters, inhibits photosynthetic activity of aquatic biota by reducing the penetration of sunlight, besides having direct toxic effects on biota.<br><br>
The colour compounds also chelate metal ions and may impart contamination by heavy metals. Recently, the colour causing organic compounds have also been implicated in the appearance of blue-green algal blooms (Paerl, 1982; Kuenzler et al., 1982; Witherspoon &amp; Pierce, 1982). It is therefore, imperative that the colour present in pulp and paper mill effluents be removed, before being discharged into receiving waters.<br>
There are two general strategies for the removal of colour from the effluent of a pulp &amp; paper mill:<br>
1)	Conventional end of pipe treatment<br>
2)	Modification of the pulp and paper manufacturing process so that less colour is produced.<br>
3)	The   following    are   the    conventionally    used    colour   removing technologies:<br>
The following are the conventionally used colour removing technologies:<br><br>
- Secondary treatment: the effluents are treated with conventional activated<br>
sludge method. However, conventional biological treatment systems cannot<br>
remove colour (Yosefian el al., 2000).<br>
Enzyme pre-treatment<br>
Resin separation and ion exchange<br>
Aluminium oxide<br>
- Adsorption on wood<br>
Membrane processes<br>
- Irradiation<br>
Electrolytic process<br>
- Activated carbon<br>
Land treatment<br>
Ozone<br>
At this point, no single colour removal technology has been identified as the most<br>
effective. Since all the above-cited technologies are cost-intensive, they would have<br>
adverse economic impact on the mill involved. Moreover, chemical treatment<br>
processes add up to the ever-increasing concentration of chemicals in the environment<br>
(Kapdame/a/.,2000).<br>
In principle, decolorization is achievable using one or a combination of the following<br>
methods ;<br>
Adsorption<br>
- Filtration<br>
- Precipitation<br>
- Chemical degradation<br>
Photodegradation and<br>
- Biodegradation<br>
Rohella el al., 2001 used polyelectrolytes (commercially available) for removing<br>
colour from pulp mill effluents. However, the cost-benefit analysis of this treatment<br>
has not yet been worked upon and hence this type of technology is not viable.<br>
However, since the polyelectrolytes rely on ionic charge of the effluent, the colour<br>
reducing ability will be highly variable, considering the enormous fluctuations<br>
occurring in the composition of the wastewater.<br>
The majority of colour removal techniques work either by concentrating the colour<br>
into a sludge or by the partial breakdown or complete breakdown of the colored<br>
molecule (Willmott el a/, 1998). However, the colour and chemical composition of<br>
the pulp mill effluents are usually subject to both daily process as well as seasonal<br>
variations. A single, universally applicable end-of-pipe solution has therefore not<br>
emerged till date.<br>
General physico-chemical colour removal methods such as chemical precipitation,<br>
rapid sand filtration, membrane processes and adsorption have been developed<br>
(Springer, 1985). Adsorption and membrane processes, although are efficient, but<br>
expensive (Manjunath and Mehrotra, 1981).<br>
Application of electrochemical methods is another way to treat the wastewaters from<br>
the cellulose paper production (Christoskova and Lazarov,1988). This method<br>
guarantees high treatment efficiency but its effectiveness depends upon the types of<br>
electrodes, the construction of electrocoagulators and the conditions under which the<br>
process is run.<br>
Chemical precipitation, using alum, ferric chloride and lime has also been studied<br>
extensively (Lathia and Joyce, 1978; Dugal et al,1976; Joyce et al,1979; Srivastava et<br>
al,1984 ; Beulker and Jekel,1993; Stephenson &amp; Duff, 1996). In spite of short<br>
retention times and low capital costs, there are some drawbacks reported, such as high<br>
cost of chemicals for precipitation as well as for pH adjustment, voluminous sludge<br>
production due to heavy dosages, problems associated with dewatering and disposing<br>
of generated sludge and high residual cation levels, so that their colour remains in the<br>
supernatant (Stephenson and Duff, 1996; Srivastava et al,1984).<br>
In theory, biological treatment gives the ideal solution to colour removal as less<br>
sludge is produced as compared to chemical treatments. Lower daily running costs are<br>
also incurred. Among the biological systems, white-rot fungi have been extensively<br>
researched upon, for their capability to degrade lignin which forms an important and<br>
major component of the pulp and paper effluents (Feijoo et al, 1995). Certain<br>
workers have shown that the pellets of white-rot fungi, under specific conditions of<br>
incubation, strongly adsorb colour and AOX from the kraft bleach plant effluent<br>
(Jaspers et al., 1996).<br>
Raghu Kumar et al., 1996, showed that marine fungi could also be utilized for colour<br>
removal from bleached plant effluent. One of the strain was reported to give 74%<br>
decolorization at alkaline pH over a period of 14 days. Several other researchers have<br>
also reported partial decolorization by white-rot fungi (Eaton et al,1980; Livernoche<br>
et al,1983; Pronty,1990; Gokcay and Dilek,1994). Gokcay and Dilek (1994) have<br>
pointed out that due to the need for high glucose concentrations by the fungus, this<br>
treatment is economically non-feasible. They have also reported that the fungi were<br>
not effective when bleaching effluents were present.<br>
Dilek et a/.,1999 have reported the decolorization of pulping effluents using a mixed<br>
culture algae. A combination of aerobic-anaerobic treatment has been used by Vidal<br>
et al White-rot fungi excreting several extracellular oxidative enzymes including<br>
Lignin peroxidase, Manganese peroxidase and laccases were used for decolorizing<br>
bleach kraft pulp mill effluents. Up to 64% colour was removed by applying aerobicanaerobic<br>
treatment followed by enzyme treatment.<br>
Till date, there are almost no reports regarding the utilization of pure bacterial cultures<br>
for decolorization of pulping effluent. The novelty of the present invention is the<br>
application of pure cultures of bacteria, isolated from natural habitat, for removing<br>
colour of the pulp and paper wastewaters in an industrially and economically viable<br>
fashion.<br>
Objects of the present invention<br>
The main object of the present invention "is to provide a process for the aerobic<br>
treatment of pulp mill wastewater in terms of colour reduction.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a bacterial strain isolated<br>
from activated sludge obtained from a pulp mill.<br>

performed to reduce the retention time (make the process faster) as well as to enhance<br>
the extent of colour reduction of the effluent. Approximately 58% reduction in the<br>
colour levels within a period of 24 hours by a single bacterial isolate was observed,<br>
which is definitely better than the earlier 51% reduction in 3 to 5-days period in case<br>
of consortia. Therefore, in the complete patent specification, the results obtained by<br>
using the individual bacterial isolate have been presented; being markedly better than<br>
those obtained by the bacterial consortia.<br>
2. The culture has been already sent for deposit to IMTECH in the international<br>
depository and number shall be allotted by 17 March 2003.<br>
3. We would like to claim for only the one bacterial isolate which has repeatedly<br>
given best results as given in table 5 and 8 of complete specification.<br>
The strain of the instant Application is deposited in MTCC, Chandigarh INDIA and<br>
the accession o. is MTCC 5099. The strain is mentioned as bacterial strain Bacterium<br>
B4 in the specification at several places.<br>
The invention of the instant Application is further elaborated in the form of examples.<br>
However, these examples merely substantiate the invention and do not construe to<br>
limit the scope of the invention<br>
10<br>
Example I<br>
Bacteria were isolated from wastewater emerging from both inlet as well as outlet of<br>
Effluent Treatment Plant. The pH of the effluent was checked and found to be 7.6 +<br>
0.2. Filtered and autoclaved wastewater was used as media for isolating<br>
autochthonous bacteria in different percentages viz., 100%, 80 %, 50 %, 30 % and 10<br>
% using mineral salts medium (MSM). The composition of the MSM used was as<br>
follows:<br>
K2HPO4 5 mM<br>
KH2PO4 5 mM<br>
MgS04.7H20 1 mM<br>
EDTA 0.3 mM<br>
ZnSO4.7H20 0.01 mM<br>
MnSO4.7H2O 0.02 mM<br>
CuSO4.7H20 0.004 mM<br>
FeSO4.7H2O 0.1 mM<br>
NaMoO4.2H20 0.004 mM<br>
(NH4)2SO4.7H2O 5 mM<br>
pH 7.0 ±0.2<br>
To 100 ml aliquots of Nutrient Broth (NB), 1 ml each inlet as well as outlet of<br>
wastewater was added and kept at 37 °C / 24 -48 hrs for enrichment.<br>
Effluent-MSM plates were prepared using 2 % agar as solidifying agent. The plates<br>
were kept for solidification and inverted till further use. Serial dilution plating was<br>
carried out by serially diluting the enriched inocula till a dilution of 10-12. Serial<br>
dilution was carried out by taking 9 ml aliquots of Na2HPO4 - NaH2PO4 buffer (pH<br>
6.8, 0.05 M) and inoculating 1 ml of enriched inoculum in the first vial, vortexing and<br>
taking 1ml from this vial and diluting the next vial with it, till a 10"12 dilution was<br>
obtained, These vials were then used for plating on to the effluent MSM plates.<br>
100 \i\ of the above dilutions were placed on the different Effluent - MSM plated and<br>
spread plated with the help of a sterile glass spreader. All plates were prepared in<br>
duplicates and incubated for 24-48 hours at 37°C. Colonies appearing on these plates<br>
were marked according to morphological differences and selected for further<br>
purification.<br>
Colonies exhibiting different morphological appearance were picked with sterile<br>
inoculating needle and streaked on plates containing the respective growth media.<br>
After two to three repetitive subculturing, purified isolates were obtained which were<br>
tested for purity and stored as slants and stabs in their respective media.<br>
Loopful of cultures were taken and inoculated in sterile aliquots of Nutrient Broth,<br>
vortexed and kept for incubation at 37 ° C / 120 rpm for 16-18 hrs. Checked the<br>
optical density of these mother cultures at 650 nm.<br>
Thirty-five morphologically different bacteria were selected for ther screening their<br>
ability to reduce colour from pulp mill wastev-a ;;r. 100 ml sterile NB was inoculated<br>
with 100 ul of respective mother cultures and intiubated at 37° C / 120 rpm for 16-18<br>
hours. The initial and final optical densities at 650 nm were noted. Cultures were<br>
harvested at an ODeso of 1.5-2.0 by centrifuging at 6000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C.<br>
The pellet obtained was washed twice using sterile phosphate buffer (pH 6.8 0.05 M)<br>
and resuspended in small volume of the same. This suspension was then used for<br>
treatability assay in a ratio of 1:1, i.e., 100 ml of effluent sample was treated with<br>
pellet obtained from 100 ml of culture media.<br>
The colour removal experiment was carried out in batch culture in conical shake<br>
flasks at 37°C at 120 rpm for a period of five days. Colour intensities were measured<br>
at 450 nm using NCASI optical density method on zero day, third day and fifth days.<br>
13 bacteria gave a reduction of 50 % and more on the fifth day (Table 1).<br>
Example II<br>
The thirteen individual bacteria exhibiting more than 50% colour reduction were<br>
selected and nine different bacterial consortia were formulated using random<br>
combinations.<br>
Individual cultures constituting the formulated consortia were independently grown in<br>
nutrient broth by inoculating 100 ul of actively growing cultures in each flask.<br>
Cultures were incubated at 37°C/ 16-18 hrs at 120 rpm until an optical density of 1.5-<br>
2.0 was achieved. The cultures were then pooled together according to the consortial<br>
composition. Optical density at 650 nm of the pooled culture was measured. The cells<br>
of the resulting consortia were harvested by centrifuging at 6000 rpm for 20 minutes<br>
at 4°C and was washed twice with Na2HPO4 - NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.8, 0.05 M). The<br>
pellets were then redissolved in 10 ml of phosphate buffer and used for colour<br>
reduction experiments.<br>
Effluent samples, neutralized to pH 7.0 + 0.2, were taken in 500 ml aliquots in shake<br>
flasks and inoculated with the above prepared pellets in a ratio of 1:1. All the flasks<br>
were incubated at 37°C / 120 rpm for 3 days. Controls were also maintained, which<br>
did not contain any added inoculum, apart from the indigenous flora.<br>
Samples were analyzed for colour levels using the NCASI spectrophotometric assay<br>
and percentage reduction calculated. Only two consortia exhibited colour reduction<br>
more than 50 % (Table 2).<br>
Example III<br>
Optimum inoculum size for reducing the colour levels was checked by inoculating the<br>
consortia in three different ratio, viz., 1:1, 1:0.5, and 1:0.75 (effluent: culture).<br>
100 ml effluent samples were taken in shake flasks and inoculated with the<br>
formulated consortia prepared from 100 ml, 50 ml and 75 ml NB aliquots. All the<br>
conditions of incubation temperature, time and shaking were kept similar to example<br>
2 and colour levels measured after treatment for three days.<br>
The consortia exhibited the highest colour reduction with 1:1 effluent: biomass ratio<br>
(Table 3).<br>
Example IV<br>
To improve the colour removal efficiency, fresh bacterial isolation was carried out<br>
from activated sludge obtained from ETP of a Pulp and Paper Mill. 5.0 grams of<br>
homogenised activated sludge taken from ETP of pulp and paper mill was enriched in<br>
medium consisting of 100 ml of sludge infusion, 25 ml of sterile nutrient broth and<br>
0.1% (w/v) each of lignin (Alkali lignin-Aldrich,USA), vanillin and tannin (Sigma).<br>
The pH was adjusted to 6.8+0.2.<br>
Individual bacteria were screened for their capacity to decolorize the paper mill<br>
effluent.<br>
Treatability assay was conducted in 100 ml aliquots and individual bacterial pellets<br>
screened for their colour removal efficiencies. Isolate number 4 was observed to be<br>
the best among all, giving 68% colour removal in 48 hours, followed by isolate<br>
numbers, 35 (63%) and 19 (60%) (Table 4).<br>
Example V<br>
Isolates 4, 19 and 35 were then cultivated individually in two different media -<br>
Nutrient Broth (NB) (rich media) and Mineral Salts Medium (minimal medium) with<br>
inorganic constituents and glucose (1%) as carbon-source to compare the effect of<br>
growth media on the performance of the cultures in removing colour for pulp mills<br>
wastewaters.<br>
The above isolates were also cultured separately for formulating them together in the<br>
form of a consortium and test the same for the effect of culture media on consortial<br>
efficiency to reduce colour.<br>
Nutrient Broth (NB) was prepared by dissolving (per litre), 5.0 g peptic digest of<br>
animal tissue, 5.0 g of sodium chloride, 1.5 g of beef extract, 1.5 g of yeast extract<br>
and 0.2 ml Tween-80. Mineral Salts Medium (MSM) was prepared as described in<br>
example I. Glucose (1% v/v) taken from its sterile stock solution was also added to<br>
MSM to act as a carbon supplement for the bacteria.<br>
Colour removal assays were conducted in batch cultures in 100 ml aliquots with an<br>
incubation temperature of 37°C and 120 rpm shaking. Samples for colour analysis<br>
were withdrawn at zero, 24 and 48 hours intervals and analyzed for color levels.<br>
Both NB as well as MSM grown cultures exhibited almost similar results (Table 5).<br>
Example VI<br>
Isolates 4, 19 and 35, which exhibited more than 60 % reduction in colour of the pulp<br>
mill effluent, were formulated into a consortium and screened along with other<br>
formulated consortia which contained randomly combined cultures, for their colour<br>
reduction abilities<br>
Consortia CC17 was the best among all exhibiting up to 55% colour reduction within<br>
48 hours.<br>
Example VII<br>
The consortium CC 17 formulated in Example VI was used for colour removal of<br>
century inlet effluent in the presence of different concentrations of. glucose and<br>
sucrose Viz. 0.5, 0.75, 1.0% w/v.<br>
13<br>
1% glucose was found to be the best supplement as compared to the others giving up<br>
to 75% reduction in colour within 48 hours. However, all others were not significantly<br>
different from each other (Table 7).<br>
Example VIII<br>
Although addition of glucose in the vvastewaler soemed to be giving better colour<br>
reduction, however, its practical feasability is questionable. Hence the inventors<br>
decided to increase the biomass loading in the effluent to see the effect. Bacterium no.<br>
4, 19 and 35 were grown individually, as described earlier till an OD 650 of 1.5 - 2.0,<br>
instead of 1.0 to formulate the consortium and MTCC 5099 was cultured individually<br>
to an optical density of 1.5-2.0 as well to see any enhancement in the colour removal<br>
efficiency. All the other experimental conditions were the same. Bacterium number 4<br>
exhibited up to 55 % colour reduction within 24 hours (Table 8).<br>
The total lignin levels of the above bacteria were also estimated using the Modified<br>
Pearl Benson Method.<br>
Bacterium number 4 exhibited the best response than the other individual bacteria as<br>
well as the consortium with the increased biomass loading. Results were replicated<br>
thrice.<br>
Example IX<br>
Monitoring of biomass levels and viability of isolate 4 throughout the experiment in<br>
terms of Colony Forming Units (CFU/ml) was carried out.<br>
It was found that at the zero hour, the CFU/ml level was approximately 109 CFU/ml,<br>
which remained as such till 24 hours and in fact showed an increase to 1010 CFU/ml<br>
showing that the cells were completely viable even till the end of the experiment.<br>
Samples were streaked on solid nutrient medium to match the morphological<br>
characters of the original culture with the culture in the effluent and found to be the<br>
same.<br>
