TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"IMPROVED FORMULATIONS OF FLUCONAZOLE"<br>
We, BA RESEARCH INDIA LIMITED, of BA Research House, Opposite "Pushparaj Towers", Nr. Judges Bungalows, Bodakdev, Ahmedabad- 380054, Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
1<br>
 <br>
BA_FORMUL_00l_compl<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical dosage forms of Fluconazole. The in vitro dissolution, as well as the in vivo absorption of the fluconazole dosage form of the present invention is faster and more consistent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fluconazole is an important representative of the wide spectrum triazole antifungal medicinal active ingredients, which is mainly administered orally. It is described in in U.S. Pat. No. 4,404,216.<br>
Chemically    Fluconazole    is    2,4-difluoro-(a),    (o)-bis-(lH-l,    2,4-triazole-l-yl-methyl)-<br>
benzylalcohol. Fluconazole is white, crystalline solid, which is poorly soluble in water.<br>
Fluconazole is administered in the therapy in form of tablets or capsules in strengths of 50<br>
mg, 100mg,l50 mg or 200 mg.   Fluconazole is used extensively to treat a wide range of<br>
Candida  infections.  In  particular,  it  is widely used  in  connection  with  therapy  for<br>
oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with advanced HIV infection and AIDS.<br>
Commercially available fluconazole containing medicinal preparations either contains<br>
i)	lactose, maize starch, magnesium stearate, silicone dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate; or<br>
ii)        microcrystalline   cellulose,   anhydrous   calcium   phosphate,   povidone,   sodium<br>
croscarmellose, FD4C Red No. 40 aluminium pigment, magnesium stearate as inactive excipients, depending on the type of formulations.<br>
WO 9318757, describes immediate release preparation of fluconazole, the preparation being manufactured by formulating a tablet containing menthol and obtaining a porous tablet structure by having menthol sublimed.<br>
Inappropriate dissolution rate of fluconazole preparation results in high variability of peak plasma  concentration  results  during  a  bioequivalence  study,  which,   in  turn,  causes inconsistency in study results. <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
We herein disclose a fluconazole containing medicinal formulation, which provides for the fast and consistent dissolution in vitro as well as fast and consistent absorption in vivo. Such a formulation will have the beneficial effects of short absorption time, low inter-individual difference in the time required for absorption &amp; so on.<br>
The formulations of the present invention may be in the form of a tablet, pellets, granules, capsules or granules enclosed in a capsule. In a preferred embodiment, the formulation is in the form of a capsule.<br>
2<br>
 <br>
BA_FORMUL_00l_compi<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention describes improved formulations of fluconazole having improved<br>
dissolution and in vivo absorption profile.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations may be preferably in the form of pellets or granules which<br>
can be further encapsulated.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulation of fluconazole comprises of a core coated with the drug<br>
emulsion layer. Optionally, polyethylene glycol (PEG) 20,000 may be coated onto the<br>
emulsion layer which acts as a protective coating. The core may be spherical in shape.<br>
Suitable cores may be those commercially available. Suitable cores may be selected from, but<br>
are not limited to, sucrose, lactose, starch, talc, or microcrystalline cellulose or a combination<br>
thereof. Optionally, in another embodiment, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP K-30) may be used<br>
as a plasticizer in combination with the core materials. The preferred weight ratio between the<br>
core and the drug is I : 0.2-0.6.<br>
The core is prepared as per techniques known. In one such embodiment, the core is prepared<br>
by<br>
-	dissolving PVP in suitable alcohols such as propanol, isopropanol and the like;<br>
-	mixing the starch and talc together;<br>
-	sucrose is taken in a suitable fluidized bed;<br>
-	spraying the PVP solution on the sucrose while simultaneously mixing the it with the starch-talc mixture;<br>
-	drying the wet core<br>
The drug emulsion layer comprises of fluconazole in combination with an emulsifier, a<br>
binder, and a solid phase acid.<br>
The drug is first dissolved in an organic solvent(s). Examples of the organic solvents include,<br>
but are not limited to, methylene chloride, ethanol, and isopropanol. The preferred organic<br>
solvents are a combination of methylene chloride and ethanol.<br>
Suitable emulsifier include, but are not limited to, Poloxamer 188, polysorbate such as Tween<br>
80, sodium lauryl sulfate, phospholipids and the like or their suitable mixtures;<br>
Suitable binders include, but are not limited to, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and methylcellulose (MC).<br>
Suitable solid phase acid may be selected from, but are not limited to, maleic acid, succininc<br>
acid, malic acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, and alginic acid, tartaric acid and the like or their<br>
suitable mixtures. The preferred weight percentage of emulsifiers is about 0.005-5%, by<br>
weight of the total pharmaceutical preparation. The preferred weight percentage of suitable<br>
solid phase acid is about 0.005-6% of the total pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
3<br>
 <br>
BA_FORMUL_001_compl<br>
The manufacturing procedure for making the drug emulsion layer is as follows:<br>
(a)	mixing the solid phase acid with a suitable alcohol;<br>
(b)	adding the emulsifier to (a), &amp; dissolving it;<br>
(c)	adding the binder to (b), to form an emulsion solution; and<br>
(d)	adding fluconazole to the emulsion solution of (c), stirring till the drug is evenly distributed in the emulsion solution. This is followed by adding methylene chloride to the drug-containing emulsion solution, stirring until the drug is completely dissolved to form the drug emulsion layer.<br>
The present pharmaceutical compositions are produced by spraying the drug emulsion layer<br>
onto the cores prepared above.<br>
Optionally, PEG 2000 dissolved in suitable solvent(s) such as suitable alcohols such as<br>
ehtanol, propanol, isopropanol and the like, methylene chloride and the like alone or in<br>
combination is spray coated over the emulsion layer.<br>
The granules/pellets were in a preferred embodiment filled into capsules after optionally<br>
being admixed with suitable auxilliary and/or filling agents and subsequent homogenization.<br>
The following working examples describe the formulation of the present invention in greater<br>
details. However, the examples are meant for illustrative purpose only and should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the invention in any way.<br>

Dissolution test:<br>
In order to demonstrate the improved efficacy of the present formulation, in vitro dissolution<br>
profile and in vivo absorption of fluconazole capsules of 200 mg strength prepared according<br>
to Example 1 are compared with commercially available flucanozole (Diflucan) capsules<br>
prepared by originator Pfizer. The test was performed in paddle apparatus according to<br>
Ph.Eur. at 50 rpm. The dissolving medium was 500 ml 0.1 M HC1. Samples were analyzed by<br>
HPLC.<br>
Results of in vitro dissolution tests show that the capsules exhibit signiflcanty higher<br>
dissolution rate in the initial 30 minutes of dissolution compared to the original preparation (-<br>
93% for the capsules of the present invention compared to -86% for Diflucan).<br>
Pharmacokinetic study:<br>
In vivo dissolution differences between said between the aforesaid two preparations were also<br>
demonstrated in a single dose, crossover, randomized comparative pharmacokinetic study<br>
performed in 27 healthy volunteers.<br>

 <br>
BA_FORMUL_001_compl<br>
It was found that<br>
-	77.8% subjects achieved Tmax earlier in test product compare to reference product;<br>
-	Max. Plasma con. of 40.7% subjects are less in test product compare to ref product;<br>
-	60% of subjects have higher Cmax compare to ref product<br>
Thus, it was found that among the test population, 55.6% of subjects had earlier Tmax and higher Cmax in test product compare to reference product thereby demonstrating that the absorption rate of the present formulation has significantly improved over the test product. While the invention has been described by way of examples and in terms of the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications as would be apparent to those skilled in the art.
