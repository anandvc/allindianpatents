PROVISIONAL/ COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
“METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MAKING A PAYMENT THROUGH A MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICE”<br>
AJAY ADISESHANN, an Indian citizen, of 7, Ramjanki, 356, Linking Road, Mumbai, Pin No. 400052, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a method for making a payment through a mobile communication device. <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
With the rapid development of trade and commerce across the world, most of the financial institutions are becoming computerized. Computerization helps these financial institutions to automate their internal businesses as well as subsequently substitute the existing manual labor requirements to perform transactions. Traditional exercises such as manual clearance of cheques and depositing of cash is now being replaced by an automated, computer-based transaction system, which is a step toward cashless-payment transactions.<br>
The present technology drive for a cashless-payment system is geared towards the use of mobile communication devices to make financial transactions. The use of mobile communication devices for making payments expedites the transaction and also saves time required for a person to go to a bank and do the paperwork. Further, from a buyer's and a seller's perspective, the transaction is complete on the point-of-sale, making the payment using a mobile communication device safer and faster.<br>
Various methods have been proposed for making a payment by using a mobile communication device. One of the methods for making payments by using mobile communication devices uses embedded software. The embedded software provides a user interface, which may be used by a buyer to select different fields and enter the details required to make a payment. Most of these softwares are provided in the relatively more expensive mobile communication devices. Moreover, some of the embedded softwares require an Internet connection for completing the transaction.<br><br>
Additionally, some embedded softwares may not be compatible with the different mobile communication service providers.<br>
Another method for making a payment by using mobile communication devices provides a buyer with an option of making a payment by using his prepaid credit. The prepaid credit is the amount of money paid by the buyer to a service provider for his mobile communication device. Consequently, the buyer cannot make purchases worth more than the total amount of his prepaid credit. Further, the buyer has to remember various details, like credit account number, validation period, and so forth, required for making a payment.<br>
In light of the above discussion, there is a need for a method and a system, which enables buyers to make payments by using various mobile communication devices. Further, there is a need for a method and a system, which does not restrict a buyer to make the payment by using his mobile communication device, based on his prepaid credit.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a method for payment, using a mobile communication device.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method for payment through a Short Messaging Service (SMS), using a mobile communication device. The payment is independent of any mobile communication service provider.<br><br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a system for payment through an SMS, using a mobile communication device, which is independent of any embedded software on the mobile communication device.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a system for payment through an SMS, using a mobile communication device, which is independent of the mobile communication's option of prepaid credit.<br>
To achieve the above mentioned objectives, the invention provides a method and a system wherein a payer can make a payment for a purchase of an item by using his mobile communication device through 'Paymate'. Paymate is a unique mobile payment platform and an ecosystem that is conceived, developed and implemented by the applicant to facilitate payer to payee payments using a mobile communication device and allowing the mobile communication device to function as a virtual debit, credit card or bank account. The method includes sending a purchase request to the Paymate with the transaction details. A payee may also send the transaction identifier and the transaction amount to the Paymate, if the payer is purchasing at least one item from the payee. The Paymate verifies the transaction details and authenticates the payer. After verification and authentication, the Paymate sends the request to a debit server such as a bank, for debiting the transaction amount from the payer's account and crediting the transaction amount to the payee's account. In response, the Paymate then sends a confirmatory message to the payer and the payee stating the status of the transaction.<br>
A method for making a payment through a mobile communication device, the method comprising:<br><br>
a.	receiving transaction details of the payment by a Paymate. the transaction<br>
details being received from a payee, the transaction details comprising at<br>
least one of a transaction identifier and a transaction amount;<br>
