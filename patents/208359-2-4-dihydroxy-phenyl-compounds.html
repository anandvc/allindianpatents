THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>

&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"2, 4 DIHYDROXY PHENYL COMPOUNDS"<br>
PFIZER INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the<br>
State of Delaware, 235 East 42nd Street, New York, New York<br>
10017, United States of America,	GRANTED<br>
21-6-2006<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
21 JUN 2006<br><br>
The present invention relates to a 2, 4, dihydroxy phenyl compound of formula I:<br>
The present invention relates to the use of certain resorcinol derivatives as skin lightening agents.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
The terms "lightening agent" and "depigmentation agent" are used interchangeably throughout this document.<br>
Skin color in humans arises from a complex series of cellular processes that are carried out within a unique population of cells called melanocytes. Melanocytes are located in the lower part of the epidermis, and their function is to synthesize a pigment, melanin, which protects the body from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation.<br>
When skin is exposed to ultraviolet radiation, such as that contained in sunlight, melanocytes increase their synthesis of melanin. Melanin is deposited in melanosomes, which are vesicles found within the cell. The melanosomes are extruded from the cell and carried to the surface of the skin by keratinocytes, which internalize the melanin-containing melanosomes. The end result is that the visible layers of the skin exhibit a brown color typically known as a "tan". The darkness of the color observed in the skin is proportionate to the amount of melanin synthesized by melanocytes and transferred to the keratinocytes.<br>
The mechanism by which skin pigmentation is formed, melanogenesis, is particularly complex and schematically involves the following main steps: Tyrosine—L-Dopa-»Dopaquinone- Dopachrome—Melanins, The first two reactions in this series are catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosinase. The activity of tyrosinase is promoted by the action of a-melanocyte stimulating hormone or UV rays to have melanin eventually formed as chromatism in the skin. It is well established that a substance has a depigmenting effect if it acts directly on the vitality of the epidermal melanocytes where melanogenesis normally occurs and/or if it interferes with one of the stages in melanin biosynthesis. The active compounds that are employed in the various methods and compositions of this invention inhibit tyrosinase and thus inhibit or decrease melanin biosynthesis.<br>
There is a strong demand for agents that enable acquired deposition sites, such as spots or freckles, to be restored to a normal skin color. For this purpose, a variety of agents and methods have been developed and put on the market. Examples of such methods are (a) a method wherein vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) having good reducing ability is administered orally in large amounts, (b) a method wherein glutathione is administered parenterally; (c) a method wherein a peroxide, such as hydrogen peroxide, zinc peroxide, sodium peroxide and the like, which is believed to have the bleaching action of rnelamine, is administered: and (d) a method wherein vitamin C or cysteine is administered topically in the form of an ointment,<br>
'<br><br>
cream, lotion or the like. Vitamin C has a problem with respect to stability and becomes so unstable in water-containing systems that they will cause changes in odor and color. Thiol compounds such as glutathione and cysteine do not exhibit a satisfactory depigmental effect since the development of the effect is very slow.<br>
The substances in widest use at the present time as depigmentors are, in particular, hydroquinone and its derivatives, particularly its ethers such as hydroquinone monomethyl ether. These compounds, while effective, are known to produce side effects that can be dangerous. Hydroquinone, use of which is limited to a concentration of 2%, is both irritating and cytotoxic to the melanocyte.<br>
United States Patent 4,526,179 refers to certain hydroquinone fatty esters that have good activity and are less irritating and more stable than hydroquinone.<br>
Japanese Patent Application No. 27909/86 refers to other hydroquinone derivatives that do not have the drawbacks of hydroquinone but that have relatively poor efficacy.<br>
United States Patent 5,449,518 refers to 2,5-dihydoxyphenyl carboxylic acid derivatives as skin depigmentation agents.<br>
European Patent Application EP 341.664A1 refers to certain resorcinol derivatives as tyrosinase inhibitors and skin depigmentation agents.<br>
PCT International Publication WO 99/15148 refers to certain resorcinol derivatives as tyrosinase inhibitors and skin depigmentation agents.<br>
The use of topical depigmention agents that have good efficacy and are harmless is particularly desirable for treating the following: regional hyperpigmentation caused by melanocytic hyperactivity, such as idiopathic melasma occurring either during pregnancy (mask of pregnancy or chloasma) or secondary to estrogen-progesterone contraception; local hyperpigmentation caused by benign melanocytic hyperactivity and proliferation such as lentigo senilis or liver spots; accidental hyperpigmentation such as post-lesional photosensitization and scarring; and certain forms of leukoderma such as vitiligo where, if the injured skin cannot be repigmented, the residual zones of normal skin are depigmented to impart a homogeneous white color to the entire skin.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
The resorcinol derivatives of formula I, which are defined below and used in the various methods and compositions of this invention, are useful in the treatment of the foregoing dermatological conditions as well as other demnatological conditions, some of which are referred to later in this document, for which the subject being treated desires, for medicinal or cosmetic purposes, to lighten or reduce the pigmentation of the skin affected by the condition.<br><br><br>

Reaction Schemes 1 through 12 illustrate various methods of synthesizing compounds of formula I. PG refers to a protecting group.<br>
Referring to Scheme 1, compounds of formula (2) can be formed by protecting commercially available 4-bromoresorcinol (1). A suitable protecting group such as methoxymethyl (MOM) can be introduced by conventional methods that are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, alkylation of 4-bromoresorcinol can occur with two equivalents of methoxymethyl chloride in the presence of disopropylamine in a halogenated solvent at about 0°C to room temperature.<br>
Compounds of general formula (3) can be obtained using conventional methods. For example, the reaction of compounds of formula (2) with n-butyllithium in the presence of N,N,N,N,'-tetramethylethylenediamine in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, followed by quenching with tri/sopropyl borate and hydrolysing with aqueous acid, can yield compounds of formula (3).<br>
Compounds of general formula (5) can be obtained using conventional methods. For example, the treatment of compounds of formula (4) with triphenylphosphine and bromine in a chlorinated solvent will yield compounds of formula (5). Compound (4) where n=1 is commercially available (Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wl, USA).<br>
Compounds of formula (6) can be obtained by reacting compounds of formula (3) with compounds of formula (5) under Suzuki coupling conditions. For example, the Suzuki reaction can be carried out using palladium tetrakis (triphenylphosphine)palladium (five mole percent), sodium carbonate (two equivalents) and heating in a suitable solvent system (e.g., dimethoxyethane/water) at about 80°C. Conversion of compounds of formula (6) to compounds of formula (8) can occur under standard reducing conditions, such as, e.g., hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst such as rhodium on alumina, at about room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Deprotection of compounds of formula (6) or (8) under suitable conditions, e.g., where the protecting group is MOM, heating at 50°C in methanol with acidic Dowex, gives compounds of formula I where R1 is substituted with =0 (7), (9). Compounds of formula (7) or (9) can be further derivatised under standard conditions to yield resorcinols of formula I where R1 is substituted with =NOR2. For example, heating compounds of formula (7) in a suitable solvent (e.g., ethanol) at about 80°C with the required hydroxylamine hydrochloride salt and triethylamine yields the analogues of formula I. Compounds of formula I where R1 is substituted with NHOR2 can be prepared from compounds of formula I where R1 is substituted with =NOR2 by a reduction under standard reaction conditions, e.g., sodium cyanoborohydride in acetic acid at or about room temperature.<br><br>
Compounds of formula (8) can be further derivatised under standard conditions to yield resorcinols of formula I where R1 is disubstituted with fluoro. For example, treating compounds of formula (8) with diethylaminosulfur trifluoride in a suitable solvent, e.g. dimethoxyethane, after suitable deprotection, would give analogues of formula I.<br>
Referring to Scheme 2, compounds of the general formula (10) are well known and can be obtained using conventional methods (see, e.g., Crombie ef a/., 1982, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I, 1485). Compounds of formula (11) can be obtained from the reaction of compounds of formula (2) with n-butyllithium in the presence of /V,fV,/V,/V-tetramethylethylenediamine in an ethereal solvent, followed by the addition of a compound of formula (10). Dehydration of compounds of formula (11) under standard conditions, e.g., heating compounds of formula (11) at about 110°C in a Dean-Stark apparatus in the presence of camphor sulfonic acid in a suitable solvent (e.g., toluene), yields compounds of formula (12). Hydrogenation under standard conditions, e.g., using hydrogen gas and palladium on charcoal in ethanol, yields compounds of the general formula (13). Deprotection under suitable conditions yields resorcinols of formula I where R1 is substituted with =0 (14). Compounds of formula (14) can be further derivatised under standard conditions to yield resorcinols of formula I where R1 is substituted with =NOR2. For example, heating compounds of formula (14) in a suitable solvent (e.g., ethanol) at about 80°C with the required hydroxylamine hydrochloride salt and triethylamine yields analogues of formula I. Further reduction under standard conditions would yield compounds of formula I, where R1 is substituted with NHOR2. Compounds of formula (14) can also be reprotected with a suitable protecting group such as terf-butyldimethylsilyl under standard reaction conditions to yield compounds of formula (15).<br>
Compounds of formula (15) can be further derivatised using standard reaction conditions. For example, methylenation using an appropriate Wittig will yield compounds of formula (16), e.g., treatment of methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide with potassium f-butoxide in a suitable solvent (e.g., tetrahydrofuran) at a temperature between -78°C and 0°C, followed by the addition of a compound of formula (15) will yield compounds of formula (16). Subsequent conversion to compounds of formula (18) under standard conditions, e.g. hydroboration, to give compounds of formula (17), and further oxidation using suitable conditions, such as pyridinium dichromate in dimethylformamide at room temperature, gives compounds of formula (18). Compounds of formula (17) can be treated with an alkyl bromide in a suitable solvent (e.g., acetone) in the presence of potassium carbonate to yield compounds of formula I where R1 is substituted with an ether group after suitable deprotection has taken place, e.g. when the protecting group is tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran can be used. Alternatively, compounds of formula (17) can also be<br><br><br>
esterified under standard conditions, e.g. treatment with an acid chloride in the presence of triethylamine in a chlorinated solvent at about room temperature. Compounds of formula (18) can be derivatised to form analogues such as esters and amides under conditions well known to those with skill in the art. For example, conditions to form amides may involve treating compounds of formula (18) with /so-butylchloroformate and triethylamine in a chlorinated solvent at about 0°C, followed by the addition of a suitable amine. Deprotection under suitable conditions will yield compounds of formula I where R1 is substituted with an amide. Deprotection of compounds of formula (16), (17) and (18) under standard conditions also provides compounds of formula I where R1 is substituted with methylene, hydroxylmethyl or a carboxylic acid, respectively.<br>
Referring to Scheme 3, compounds of formula (20) can be prepared starting with compound (19), which is commercially available. Conversion to compounds of formula (20) can occur under standard conditions such as, for example, where the protecting group is benzyl, condensation can occur between compound (19) and benzyl alcohol with the removal of water using a Dean-Stark apparatus in conjunction with well known methodology. Condensation of compounds of formula (20) with compounds of formula (10) can occur using standard techniques, for example, treatment of compounds of formula (20) with a base such as lithium di/sopropylamide in an ethereal solvent followed by the addition of a compound of formula (10) would give compounds of formula (21). Treatment of compounds of formula (21) with a suitable reagent such as A/-bromosuccinimide in a chlorinated solvent at about room temperature can give compounds of formula (22). Compounds of formula (23) can then be generated from compounds of formula (22) under suitable conditions. Such conditions can involve treating compounds of formula (22) with a base such as 1,8-diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene in a suitable solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide at about 140°C. Treatment of compounds of formula (23) to standard hydrogenation conditions, e.g., hydrogen gas and palladium on charcoal in ethanol, yields compounds of the general formula (24) when the protecting group is benzyl. Compounds of formula (14) can then be obtained by treating compounds of formula (24) to acidic conditions.<br>
Conversion of compounds of formula (14) to compounds of formula I may involve the need to use protecting groups that will be obvious to those of skill in the art. Some examples of such compounds of formula I are illustrated in Scheme 3. Conversion of compounds of formula (15) to compounds of formula I may involve the reduction of the ketone moiety under standard conditions, e.g., sodium borohydride in ethanol. Further derivitisation can occur, e.g. using chemistry described elsewhere in this document, to give compounds of formula I where Y' may be alky!, acyl or a carbonylamino. In examples where protecting groups have been used, suitable deprotection will be required to yield compounds of formula I.<br><br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula (15) can be manipulated to give compounds of formula I where R1 is substituted with an amide or sulfonamide. Treatment of compounds of formula (15) with benzylamine under reductive amination conditions, e.g., one equivalent of sodium triacetoxyborohydride in a suitable solvent (dichloroethane) followed by hydrogenolysis under standard conditions, e.g., palladium on charcoal, hydrogen gas, ethanol, provides compounds of formula (25). Synthesis of compounds of formula I can be obtained using conventional methods. For example, compounds of formula (25) can react with sulfonyl chlorides and acid chlorides in a chlorinated solvent in the presence of a base (e.g. triethylamine) at about room temperature. Deprotection using suitable reaction conditions provides compounds of formula I where Y is a sulfonamide or amide group.<br>
Referring to Scheme 4, compounds of formula (26) can be synthesized using standard methods. For example, compounds of formula (6) or (8) can be homologated using a Wittig reaction and further manipulated as described above to yield compounds of formula I. Compounds of formula (26) or (16) from Scheme 2 can also undergo dihydroxylation under standard conditions, e.g. catalytic osmium tetroxide and N-methyl morpholine in an ethereal solvent, and after suitable deprotection yield compounds of formula I where R1 is substituted with -(OH)(CH2OH).<br>
Referring to Scheme 5, compounds of formula (29) can be obtained by reacting compounds (6) or (8) as described above in Scheme 3. Compounds of formulae (29) and (25) can also be derivatised by treating with an alkylating agent, e.g., an alkyl iodide in a chlorinated solvent in the presence of triethylamine at about room temperature, to give compound (30) prior to sulfonylation or amide bond formation and deprotection, to yield compounds of formula I wherein Y is -N(R5)S02R4 or equivalent amide where RS is not hydrogen.<br>
Referring to Scheme 6, compounds of formula (6), (8) or (9), (14) or (15) can be treated with a suitable organometallic reagent, such as a Grignard reagent, in an ethereal solvent at a temperature between -78°C and 0°C, followed by deprotection to yield compounds of formula I where R1 is substituted with (R2)OR2.<br>
Referring to Scheme 7, compounds of formula (31) can be formed under conditions well known to those skilled in the art. Treatment of compounds (6) or (8) with an amine, such as piperidine, in a suitable solvent (e.g., dichloroethane) and a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride, followed by deprotection will yield compounds of formula I where R1 is substituted with a nitrogen-containing heterocycle.<br>
Referring to Scheme 8, compounds of general formula (33) can be obtained using conventional methods. For example, the reaction of compounds of formula (2) with n-butyllithium in the presence of N,N,N,N,'-tetramethylethylenediamine in a suitable solvent such<br><br>
as tetrahydrofuran, followed by quenching with ketone (32) (commercially available from Aldrich), and hydrolysing with aqueous acid, can yield compounds of formula (33). Functional group manipulation as outlined in Schemes 1-7 and Scheme 8 then allows the synthesis of compounds of formula I.<br>
Referring to scheme 9, compounds of formula (15), (6) or (8) can be further derivatised to yield compounds of formula (34) using standard Wittig or Wadworths-Emmons chemistry, followed by suitable deprotection. Compounds of formula (34) can be reduced using standard hydrogenation as described above to yield compounds where Y is OH, O-alkyl, or an aminoalkyl. Standard Wadworths-Emmons chemistry can also yield compounds of formula (35). Reduction under suitable conditions will yield compounds of formula (36), which can be further derivatised using standard chemistry described previously in this document to give compounds where NY'Y" is an amide, sulfonamide, or aminoalkyl.<br>
Referring to Scheme 10, compounds of formula (10) can be converted into compounds of formula (37) using standard alkylation procedures. For example, compound (10) can be treated with a suitable base such as lithium di/sopropyl amide in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature between -78°C and 0°C, followed by the addition of a suitable alkylating agent. Such alkylating agents are well known to those of skill in the art, and can include chloro, bromo, or iodoalkyl compounds; epoxides; aldehydes; aziridines; a,(i-unsaturated esters, ketones or amides; acyl chlorides; electrophilic sources of oxygen such as Mo(CO)5.pyridine (Crimmons, M. T. et a/., 1992, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114:5445); or electrophilic sources of nitrogen such as 2,4,6-tri/sopropylbenzene sulfonyl azide (Evans, P. A. ef a/., 1992, Tetrahedron Lett. 33:6959). Such alkylating reagents are commercially available or can be prepared by standard procedures well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula (37) can be further manipulated using methodology similar to that described above. For instance, alkylation of compounds of formula (37) under conditions of kinetic deprotonation (see, e.g., Kopka, I. and Rathke, M. W., 1981, J. Org. Chem. 46:3771), followed by alkylation as previously described, would yield compounds of formula (38). Alternatively, alkylation of compounds of formula (37) under conditions of thermodynamic deprotonation (Kopka and Rathke, 1981, above), followed by alkylation as previously described, would yield compounds of formula (45). Further alkylation or functional group manipulation known to those of skill in the art and, as described elsewhere in this document, followed by removal of the carbonyl protecting group under standard conditions, e.g., aqueous hydrochloric acid at about 0°C to 50°C, would yield compounds of formulae (40), (46), and (49).<br>
Compounds of formula (37) can also be protected with a suitable protecting group, e.g., ethylenedithio ketal, and after removal of the ketal protecting group under standard<br><br>
reaction conditiors- e.g. aqueous hydrochloric acid at about 0°C to 50°C, would allow further functionalisation of the cycloalkyl ring using the methodology described above to yield compounds of formula (44).<br>
Referring1 to Scheme 11, compounds of formula (50) can be formed from compounds of formula (10) using known methodology (see, e.g., Adam, W. era/., 1989, Tetrahedron Lett. 30:6497) (Ts = t0syO- Standard functional group manipulation yields compounds of formula (55) and (57). Oxirane ring cleavage by an amine yields compounds of formula (51). Alternatively, acid hydrolysis yields compounds of formula (52). Conversion of the corresponding alcohol to a leaving group such as para-toluenesulfonyl would allow the nucleophilic displacement with a range of nucleophiles under standard, well-known conditions. Sucr1 nucleophiles may include amines, thiolates, alkoxides, and carbon-based nucleophiles sucn as cyanide, which are commercially available or prepared by standard procedures well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula (40), (44) and (49) can be prepared using the above-described methods or other methods known in the art such that substituents on R1 are as defined above.<br>
Referring; to Schemes 10 and 11, ketones of formulae (37), (38), (40), (42), (43), (44), (45), (46), (47), (49), (51), (54), (55), and (57) can be further manipulated as described in Schemes 1-9 above and converted into compounds of formula I as described in Schemes 2 and 3.<br>
Referring to Scheme 12, compounds of formula I can also be prepared using the methodology described above. Compounds of formula (58) can be converted into compounds of formula I using the chemistry as described in Schemes 1 -11 above.<br>
It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that in the processes described above, the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by protecting groups. The use °f protecting groups is well-known in the art, and is fully described, among other places, in: Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry, J. W. F. McOmie, (ed.), 1973, Plenum Press; af&gt;d in: Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd edition, T. W. Greene &amp; P. G. M. Wutz, 1991. Wiley-lnterscience.<br>
The compounds of formula I that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate a compound of formula I from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutical^ unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the active base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a<br><br><br><br><br><br>
substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained.<br>
Those compounds of formula I that are acidic in nature are capable of forming base salts with various pharmaceutical^ acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts and, particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts can be prepared by conventional techniques. The chemical bases that are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutical^ acceptable base salts of this invention are those that form non-toxic base salts with the acidic compounds of formula I. Such non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmaceutically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmaceutically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they can also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, as described above. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final products.<br>
Compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts (hereinafter "the active compounds used in this invention") are useful in the treatment of disorders of human pigmentation, including solar and simple lentigines (including age/liver spots), melasma/chloasma and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Such compounds reduce skin melanin levels by inhibiting the production of melanin, whether the latter is produced constitutively or in response to UV irradiation (such as sun exposure). Thus, the active compounds used in this invention can be used to reduce skin melanin content in non-pathological states so as to induce a lighter skin tone, as desired by the user, or to prevent melanin accumulation in skin that has been exposed to UV irradiation. They can also be used in combination with skin peeling agents (including glycolic acid or trichloroacetic acid face peels) to lighten skin tone and prevent repigmentation. The appropriate dose regimen, the amount of each dose administered, and specific intervals between doses of the active compound will depend upon the particular active compound employed, the condition of the patient being treated, and the nature and severity of the disorder or condition being treated. Preferably, the active compound is administrered in an amount and at an interval that results in the desired treatment of or improvement in the disorder or condition being treated.<br>
An active compound used in the present invention can also be used in combination with sun screens (UVA or UVB blockers) to prevent repigmentation, to protect against sun or<br><br><br><br>
UV-induced skin darkening or to enhance their ability to reduce skin melanin and their skin bleaching action. An active compound used in the present invention can also be used in combination with retinoic acid or its derivatives or any compounds that interact with retinoic acid receptors and accelerate or enhance the invention's ability to reduce skin melanin and skin bleaching action, or enhance the invention's ability to prevent the accumulation of skin melanin. An active compound used in the present invention can also be used in combination with 4-hydroxyanisole.<br>
The active compounds used in this invention can also be used in combination with ascorbic acid, its derivatives and ascorbic-acid based products (such as magnesium ascorbate) or other products with an anti-oxidant mechanism (such as resveratro!) which accelerate or enhance their ability to reduce skin melanin and their skin bleaching action.<br>
This invention relates both to methods of lightening or reducing the pigmentation of skin in which the compound of formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and one or more of the other active ingredients referred to above are administered together, as part of the same pharmaceutical composition, as well as methods in which they are administered separately as part of an appropriate dose regimen designed to obtain the benefits of the combination therapy. The appropriate dose regimen, the amount of each dose administered, and specific intervals between doses of each active agent will depend upon the specific combination of active agents employed, the condition of the patient being treated, and the nature and severity of the disorder or condition being treated. Such additional active ingredients will generally be administered in amounts less than or equal to those for which they are effective as single topical therapeutic agents. The FDA approved dosages for such active agents that have received FDA approval for administration to humans are publicly available.<br>
The active compounds of the present invention are generally administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one of the compounds of formula (I), together with a pharmaceutical^ acceptable vehicle or diluent. Such compositions are generally formulated in a conventional manner utilizing solid or liquid vehicles or diluents as appropriate for topical administration, in the form of solutions, gels, creams, jellies, pastes, lotions, ointments, salves, aerosols and the like.<br>
Examples of vehicles for application of the active compounds of this invention include an aqueous or water-alcohol solution, an emulsion of the oil-in-water or water-in-oil type, an emulsified gel, or a two-phase system. Preferably, the compositions according to the invention are in the form of lotions, creams, milks, gels, masks, microspheres or nanospheres, or vesicular dispersions. In the case of vesicular dispersions, the lipids of which the vesicles are made can be of the ionic or nonionic type, or a mixture thereof.<br><br>
As used herein, a "skin-lightening or pigmentation reducing amount of a compound of formula I", and the like, means an amount or concentration of the compound capable of detectably lightening skin or reducing pigmentation in a human, as determined by any standard assay. The active compound is typically administered in a pharmaceutical composition and for a standard course of treatment that produces the desired result of skin depigmentation.<br>
As used herein, a "tyrosinase-inhibiting effective amount of a compound of formula I", and the like, means an amount or concentration of the compound capable of detectably inhibiting tyrosinase activity in a human, as determined by any standard assay.<br>
As used herein, an "amount of a compound of formula I capable of treating an inflammatory disorder such as psoriasis, dermatitis or acne, or treating dandruff', and the like, means an amount or concentration of the compound capable of detectably ameliorating, reducing, eliminating, slowing, or preventing the progression of, any symptom or condition associated with or caused by such disorder or condition, in a human, as determined by any standard assay.<br>
In the depigmenting compositions according to the present invention, the concentration of the active compound of the invention is generally between 0.01 and 10%, preferably between 0.1 and 10%, relative to the total weight of the composition.<br>
The compositions of this invention can optionally also contain a moistener, a surfactant, keratolytic, an anti-inflammatory agent, a complexing agent, an antioxidant, a preservative, a fragrance, or a sunscreen.<br>
The ability of compounds of formula I to inhibit tyrosinase may be determined using any of the following procedures.<br>
1.	Tyrosinase (DOPA oxidase) assay using cell lysate:<br>
Human melanoma cell line, SKMEL 188 (licensed from Memorial Sloan-Kettering), is used in the cell lysate assay and the screen. In the assay, compounds and L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) (100 μg/ml) are incubated with the cell lysates containing human tyrosinase for 8 hrs before the plates are read at 405 nm. Potency of the compounds in DOPA oxidase assay is correlated very well with that in tyrosine hydroxylase assay using 3H-tyrosine as a substrate. Most of the compounds of formula I that were tested in this assay exhibited an IC50 of less than 10 μM. For example, the compound of Example 23, i.e., (±)-3-(2,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)cyclopentanone oxime, had an IC50 in this assay of about 2 μm.<br>
2.	Melanin assay in human primary melanocytes:<br>
Compounds are incubated with human primary melanocytes in the presence of a-melanocyte stimulating hormone (a-MSH) for 2-3 days. Cells are then lysed with sodium hydroxide and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and melanin signals are read at 405 nm.<br><br>
Alternatively, 4C-DOPA is added to the cells in combination with tyrosinase inhibitors and acid-insoluble 4C-melanin is quantitated by a scintillation counter. IC50's reflect the inhibitory potency of the compounds in the new melanin synthesis that was stimulated by a-MSH.<br>
3.	Tyrosine tonase assay (TKY<br>
TK assays can be performed using purified tyrosine kinase domains of c-met, erb-B2, or IGF-r. A specific antibody against phosphorylated tyrosine residue is used in the assay. Colorimetric signals are generated by horse radish peroxidase, which is conjugated to the antibody.<br>
4.	Human skin equivalent model:<br>
A mixture of human melanocytes and keratinocytes is grown in an air-liquid interphase. This tissue culture forms a three dimensional structure that histologically and microscopically resembles the human skin epidermis. Test compounds are added on top of the cells to mimic topical drug application. After incubation with the compounds (10 uM) for 3 days, the cells are washed extensively and lysed for DOPA oxidase assay.<br>
5.	IL-1 assay (lnterleukin-1 assay):<br>
An IL-1 a ELISA assay (R&amp;D system) can be used to evaluate the effect of compounds on lL-1 secretion in a human skin equivalent model. IL-1 a is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and plays a role in UV-induced skin inflammation.<br>
6.	In vivo study:<br>
Black or dark brown guinea pigs with homogeneous skin color can be used in this study. A solution of the test compound of formula I (5% in ethanol:propylene glycol, 70:30) and the vehicle control are applied to the animals twice daily, 5 days per week for 4-8 weeks. Using this assay, depigmentation can be determined by subtracting the light reflectance of untreated skin from the light reflectance of treated skin.<br>
