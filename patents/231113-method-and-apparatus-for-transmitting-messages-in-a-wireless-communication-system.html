METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING MESSAGES IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND<br><br><br>
In a wireless communication system, the transmit power required tor a transmi5sion is dependent on the propagation (or path) loss between a transmitting entity (e.g., an access terminal) and a receiving entity (e.g., an access point). As an access terminal moves further away from the access point, the path loss typically increases. Consequently, more transmit power is required so that the transmission can be received at the required signal quality for the desired level of performance (e.g., ore percent frame error rate). However, the higher transmit power for this transmission causes more interference to the transmissions from other access terminals. The higher transmit power also causes faster depletion of battery power on mobile wireless devices. There is therefore a need ix\ the art for a way to provide HDR services that mirimizes interference and depletion of battery power.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The disclosed embodiments provide techniques to reduce the amount of transmit. power required for transmission of selected messages from an access terminal. In a first aspect, the reduction in transmit power is based on the expected path loss associated with the reverse link, thus tending to extend the operatir g range of an HDR access terminal, and at the same time decreasing reverse link interference in adjacent cells. In another aspect, the reduction in transmit; power is based on the relative frequency with which an HDR access terminal is expected to send each type of message thus tending to minimize reverse link interference in a serving cell- Both of these aspects also have the benefit of tending to extend battery life of a mobile wireless device such as a mobile HDR access terminal. The techniques described herein can also be applied to forward link transmissions from an access point. Various other aspects of the invention are also presented.<br>
The invention provides methods and system elements that implement various aspects, embodiments, and features of the invention, as described in further detail below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br>
MG- 1 is a diagram of a wireless communication system 100 that supper a number of users, and which can implement various aspects of the invention- System 100 may be designed to support one or more CDMA standards and/or designs (e.g., the cdma2000 standard, the HDR specification). For simplicity, system 100 is shown to include three access points 104 (which may also be referred to as base stations) in communication with two access terminals 106 {which may also be referred to as remote terminals or mobile stations). The access point and its coverage area are often collectiveiy referred to as a "cell".<br>
Depending on the CDMA system being implemented, each access tenninal 106 may communicate with one (or possibly more) access points 104 on the forward link at any given moment and may communicate with one or more access points on the reverse link depending on whether or not the access terminal is in soft handoff. The forward link (i.e., downlink) refers to transmission from the access point to the access terminal, and the reverse link (i.e., uplink) refers to transmission from the access terminal to the access point.<br>
In a CDlvlA system, the cells may be operated on the same frequency band (i.e., with a frequency reuse of one, or K=l) to achieve better utilization of<br><br>
the available system resources. In this case, the transmission from each transmitting entity (e.g., access terminal) acts as interference to the transmissioas from other transmitting-entities. To minimize interference and increase system capacity on their verse link, the transmit power of each transmitting access terminal is controlled such that a desired level of performance (e.g., one percent frame error rate, or 1% FER) is achieved while minimiing the amount of interference to other transmitting access terminals. This transmit power adjustment is achieved by a power control loop maintained for each transmitting access terminaK The power control loop adjusts the transmit pov/er level of the access terminal such that a transmission is receiv ed by the access point at a target signal quality (i.e., a particular signal-to-noise-plus-interference, C/I) needed for the desired level of performance.<br>
In the example shown in FIG. 1. access terminal 106a is located near access point l04a, and access terminal 106b is located near the cell boundaries of Access points 104a, 104b, and 104c, For this example, botl\ access terminals are vising the same coding and modulation to transmit. Since access terminal 106a is located (relatively) close to access point 104a. its transmit power rnay be adjusted to a (relatively) low level to achieve the desired level of performance at access point lC4a* This low* transmit power is possible since the path loss is approximately proportional to the 4th law of the distance between the transmitting and receiving entities (i.e. path loss  (distance)"^). Because of the low transnut power level and further becaxise of the greater distances between access terminal lD6a and access points 104b and 104c, the transmL«ision from access terminal 206a causes little interference to other rrat\sm:ssiori$ received at access points 104b and lC4c-<br>
In contrast, access terminal 106b is located further awav from access points 104a, l04b, and lC4c- Due to the longer distances to these access points, the transmit power of access terminal 106b is likely to be adjusted to a high level to achieve the same level of performance. Because of the high transnut power level and the shorter distances between access terminal lG6b and access pomts l04b and 104c, the transmission from access terminal 106b is likely to cause more interference to other transmissions received at access points l04b and l04c.<br>
As seeh by the above example, when an access terminai is located near an access point, less transnut power is required for a transmission, and the transmis*-xon causes litde interference at other access points. In contrast, when ail access terminal is located further av/a)' from an access pointy more transmit<br><br><br>
points in a signal constellation.   In such an aspect, duin refers to the distance<br><br><br>
