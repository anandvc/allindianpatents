[0028]<br>
The fourth rotary sleeve 53 is arranged between the pair of support plates 49... of the vehicle body frame F side, and a cylindrical metal collar 57 is inserted into the fourth rotary sleeve 53 in a state that a pair of resin collars 56, 56 is interposed between the fourth rotary sleeve 53 and the metal collar 57 and dish-shaped dust covers 58, 58 are interposed between the metal collar 57 and the support plates 49....

[0032]<br>
Here, two sets of pivot portions which are mounted on the unit-swing type power unit U side in front of the rotary axis of the rear wheel WR, that is, the first pivot portions 27... and the second pivot portion 48 are, as explicitly shown<br><br>
in Fig. 1, arranged separately above and below an imaginary straight line IL which connects the axis of the crankshaft 21 and the rotary axis of the rear wheel WR. Further, a first straight line LI which connects a rotary center (an axis of the bolt 45) of the first pivot portions 27... which are arranged below the imaginary straight line IL and the connecting point of the first link mechanism 25 to the vehicle body frame F which connects the first pivot portions 27... to the vehicle body frame F is set such that the first straight line L1 is directed in the approximately longitudinal direction of the vehicle, and a second straight line L2 which connects a rotary center (an axis of the fourth connecting shaft 64) of the second pivot portion 48 which is arranged above the imaginary straight line IL and a connecting point (an axis of the third connecting shaft 59) of the second link mechanism 26 to the vehicle body frame F which connects the second pivot portion 48 to the vehicle body frame F is set such that the second straight line L2 is directed in the approximately vertical direction. [0033]<br>
Further, at least one of the first and second link mechanisms 25, 26, both of the link mechanisms 25, 26 in this embodiment are configured in a so-called oleo link type. That is, these mechanisms 25, 26 can displace the unit-swing-type power unit U in two directions, for example, in the frontward and rearward direction and in the upper and lower direction.<br><br>
[0034]<br>
By focusing on Fig. 2, in the inside of the crankcase 23 of the engine E, a balancer 7 0 which is interlockingly connected to the crankshaft 21 is accommodated in a state that the balancer 70 is arranged above the crankshaft 21. On the other hand, an intake system 77 which extends rearwardly is connected to a side surface of an upper portion of a cylinder head 71 which is mounted on the engine E. The intake system 77 is constituted of an intake pipe 72 which is connected to the cylinder head 71 and to which a fuel injection valve 73 is attached, a throttle body 14 which is connected to an upstream end of the intake pipe 72, a connection pipe 75 which is connected to an upstream end of the throttle body 74, and an air cleaner 76 which is connected to an upstream end of the connection pipe 75 and is arranged on a left side of the rear wheel WR. The balancer 70 is arranged below the connection pipe 75 which connects the throttle body 74 and the air cleaner 76. [0035]<br>
Next, the manner of operation of this embodiment is explained. The suspension means 24 which is arranged between the unit-swing-type power unit U and the vehicle body frame F includes the first and second link mechanisms 25, 26 which individually connect two sets of pivot portions 27..., 48 mounted on the unit-swing-type power unit U to the vehicle body frame<br><br>
F at positions which are separated above and below the imaginary straight line IL which connects the axis of the crankshaft 21 and the rotary axis of the rear wheel WR as viewed in a side view, and at least one of both link mechanisms 25, 26, both of the link mechanisms 25, 26 in this embodiment are configured to displace the unit-swing-type power unit U in two directions, for example, in the longitudinal direction as well as in the vertical direction and hence, it is possible to enhance the rolling rigidity by restricting the behavior of the unit-swing type power unit U in the rolling direction thereof thus reducing the vibrations, [0036]<br>
Further, the first and second link mechanisms 25, 26 are constituted of the so-called oleo-link-type mechanism and hence, these link mechanisms 25, 26 can contribute to the reduction of coupling vibrations which correspond to a distance between the balancer 70 and the crankshaft 21 or the reduction of the secondary vibrations of the crankshaft 21. [0037]<br>
Further, the first straight line LI which connects the rotary center of the first pivot portion 27 which is arranged below the imaginary straight line IL out of the two sets of pivot portions 27..., 48 which are provided to the unit-swing-type power unit U in front of the rotary axis of the rear wheel WR and the connecting point of the first link<br><br>
mechanism 25 to the vehicle body frame F is set such that the first straight line L1 is directed in the approximately longitudinal direction of the vehicle. Further, the second straight line L2 which connects the rotary center of the second pivot portion 48 which is arranged above the imaginary straight line IL and the connecting point of the second link mechanism 26 to the vehicle body frame F is set such that the second straight line L2 is directed approximately vertical direction of the vehicle. Accordingly, it is possible to allow an instantaneous center (a point at which the first straight line L1 and the second straight line L2 intersect each other) of the rocking of the unit-swing type power unit u to assume a position remote from the rotary axis of the rear wheel WR and, at the same time, in front of and below the unit-swing type power unit U thus easily attenuating impacts of the vehicle at the time of traveling on a terrain or the like. [0038]<br>
Further, in the second link mechanism 26 which connects the second pivot portion 48 which is arranged above the imaginary straight line IL and the vehicle body frame F, the connecting point of the second link mechanism 26 to the vehicle body frame F is arranged below the second pivot portion 48 and hence, it is possible to arrange the second link mechanism 26 at a position in front of and below the unit-swing-type power unit U whereby it is possible to easily ensure a space for<br><br>
arranging the parts such as the throttle body 74 of the intake<br>
system 77 above the engine E.<br>
[0039]<br>
Further, the internal combustion engine E which has the frontwardly inclined cylinder axis C includes the balancer 70 which is arranged above the crankshaft 21 and hence, it is possible to further reduce the vibrations using the balancer 70 and, at the same time, in the internal combustion engine E which has the forwardly inclined cylinder axis C, it is possible to arrange the balancer 70 by effectively making use of the vacant space formed above the crankshaft 21. [0040]<br>
Still further, the balancer 70 is arranged below the connection pipe 75 which connects the throttle body 74 and the air cleaner 7 6 and hence, it is possible to arrange the balancer 70 by effectively making use of the space formed below the connection pipe 75. [0041]<br>
As another embodiment of the present invention, there may be a case that the second pivot portion 48 is arranged on both left and right sides of the unit-swing-type power unit U and a pair of second link mechanisms 26... which is separated into left and right is arranged between a pair of second pivot portions 48... and the vehicle body frame F. In this case, by   adopting the constitution which allows the pair of second link<br><br>
mechanisms 26... to be rotatable with phases opposite to each other, it is possible to absorb disturbance in the lateral direction from the road surface by preventing the excessive increase of the support rigidity in the yaw (rotation about a vertical axis) direction of the unit-swing-type power unit U. [0042]<br>
Further, although the oleo link is used in the above-mentioned embodiment, in place of such an oleo link, by changing an elastic repulsive force of one link corresponding to circumferential positions by reducing wall thicknesses of the link, the unit-swing-type power unit U may be displaced in two directions together with the behavior of the link. [0043]<br>
Although the embodiment of the present invention has been explained heretofore, the present invention is not limited to the  above-mentioned  embodiment,   and  various  design modifications can be made without departing from the present invention described in claims.
