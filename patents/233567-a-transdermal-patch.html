				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a transdermal patch. Field of the Invention<br>
0001	The present invention relates to transdermal dosage forms which are useful for<br>
preventing or discouraging tampering, abuse, misuse or diversion of a dosage form<br>
containing an active pharmaceutical agent, such as an opioid.<br>
The present invention also relates to methods of Heating a patient with such a dosage form. The application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/467,235, filed April 30, 2003, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/467,243, filed April 30, 2003, both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
0002	Transdermal drug delivery is a well known method for administering<br>
pharmaceuticals. Although a transdermal dosage form is intended to deliver drug across<br>
the skin, misuse or abuse of such a dosage form can take place by other modes, including<br>
oral, buccal, and intravenous. Such misuse may take place following an extraction<br>
procedure comprising immersing the transdermal dosage form in a solvent, such as water,<br>
alcohol, ethanol, or ether.<br>
0003	Transdermal dosage forms comprising both a drug and an antagonist for the drug<br>
have been previously proposed. U.S. Patent No. 5,236.714 (Lee et al.) describes a<br>
transdermal dosage form which comprises a mixture of a drug and an antagonist for the<br>
drug. U.S. Patent No. 5,149,538 (Granger, et al.) describes a transdermal dosage form<br>
comprising  an opioid, an antagonist for the opioid releasable upon ingestion or solvent<br>
immersion of the dosage form, and a barrier means and an impermeable barrier means<br>
separating the opioid and the antagonist.<br><br><br>
 [0004]	There exists a need in the art for improved designs for transdermal<br>
dosage forms which provide for the enhanced release of the adverse agent upon exposure of the dosage form to solvents, such as water, alcohol or ether.<br>

sensitive adhesive. Preferred pressure-sensitive adhesives for use in the dosage forms of the invention include acrylates, polyisobutylenes, silicone polymers, and mixtures thereof. Examples of useful polyisobutylene pressure-sensitive adhesives are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,985,317 (Venkateshwaran et al\ the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes. Examples of useful acrylate and silicone polymer pressure-sensitive adhesives, and mixtures thereof, are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,474,783 (Miranda et al.\ the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.<br>

[0096]	The active agent will be present in an amount such that the<br>
composition delivers a therapeutically effective amount for the condition being treated. This amount will vary according to the type of active agent used, the condition to be treated, the amount of time the composition is allowed to remain in contact with the skin of the subject, and other factors known to those of skill in the art. For example, information on dosing and'the amount of opioid agonist active agent present in a transdermal dosage form is set forth in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2002/0119187 Al, filed September 26, 2001, entitled "Composition for the Transdermal Delivery of Fentanyl" by Cantor et al. and U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2003/0026829 Al, filed March 15, 2002, entitled "Transdermal Administration of Fentanyl and Analogs Thereof by Venkatraman et al. each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety for all purposes. In one embodiment, the amount of active agent present in the transdermal drug delivery composition of the invention is greater than about 0.01 wt-%, based on the total weight of the composition of the active agent component. In another embodiment, the amount of active agent present in the transdermal drug delivery composition of the invention is greater than about 1.0 wt-%, based on the total weight of the composition of the active agent component.

[0097]	The analgesically effective amount of an opioid present in the<br>
transdermal dosage form, however, typically ranges from about 0.01 to about 50 mg/cm2 in one embodiment, from about 0.05 to about 15 mg/cm2 in another embodiment, and from about 0.05 to about 5.0 mg/cm2 in another embodiment.

[0098]	In FIGS. 1, 2, and 3, the adverse agent 160 component is connected on<br>
one side to a barrier 150 component and on the other side to a backing 170. The adverse agent component 160 can be a polymeric material, porous film, or other material suitable for containing an adverse agent. Preferably, the reservoir component 160 is capable of containing a sufficient amount of adverse agent to blunt or block at least one biological effect of the active agent or to cause at least one unpleasant side effect hi a patient or animal which has absorbed the total amount of active agent-in the dosage form 100. This amount can vary according to the amount and type of active agent in the dosage form. The adverse agent component comprises an adverse agent in any form or composition or reservoir which allows the adverse agent to be at least partially extracted in the presence of a solvent, including but not limited to, water, ethanol or ether, or mixtures thereof.

the adverse agent component includes solid crystals of adverse agent dispersed throughout the polymeric material. In certain embodiments, the polymeric matrix is preferably a pressure sensitive adhesive. Suitable pressure-sensitive adhesives include those suitable for use as the polymeric material of the active agent component. Additionally, pressure-sensitive adhesives that are not suitable for direct skin contact can be suitable for use as the polymeric material of the adverse agent.<br>
[00100]	The adverse agent component can also comprise a porous medium,<br>
such as a woven fabric, porous or micrbporous film, or other open, mesh-like material, wherein at least a portion of the pores contain adverse agent. The adverse agent can be present within the pores in any form, including but not limited to a liquid, a gel or a solid, such as a solid crystalline or powdered material. For example, the adverse agent can be mixed with a carrier, such as a viscous liquid, semi-solid or gel material. Examples of suitable materials for incorporation into the adverse agent component include, but are not limited to, microporous films formed by extruding polyethylene or polypropylene with mineral oil as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,539,256 (Shipman), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.<br>
[00101]	Other polymer materials of the adverse agent component may include<br>
but are not limited to polyethylene; polypropylene; ethylene/propylene copolymers; ethylene/ethylacrylate copolymers; ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers; silicone elastomers, especially the medical-grade polydimethylsiloxanes; neoprene rubber; polyisobutylene; chlorinated polyethylene; polyvinyl chloride; vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer; polymethacrylate polymer (hydrogel); polyvinylidene chloride; poly(ethylene terephthalate); butyl rubber; epichlorohydrin rubber; ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer; ethylene-vinyloxyethanol copolymer; silicone copolymers, for example, polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymers, polysiloxane-polyethyleneoxide copolymers, polysiloxane-polymethacrylate copolymers, polysiloxane-alkylene copolymers (e.g., polysiloxane-ethylene copolymers), polysiloxane-alkylenesilane copolymers (e.g., polysiloxane-ethylenesilane<br><br>
copolymers), and the like; cellulose polymers, for example methyl or ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and cellulose esters; polycarbonates; polytetrafluoroethylene; and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the polymer matrix has a glass-transition temperature below room temperature. The polymer can, but need not necessarily, have a degree of crystallinity at room temperature. Cross-linking monomeric units or sites can be incorporated into the polymers. For example, cross-linking monomers can be incorporated into polyacrylate polymers. The cross-linking monomers provide sites for cross-linking the polymer matrix after microdispersing the adverse agent into the polymer. Known cross-linking monomers for polyacrylate polymers include, but are not limited to, polymethacrylic esters of polyols -such as butylene diacrylate and dimethacrylate, trimethylol propane trimethacrylate, and the like. Other monomers that provide cross-linking sites include allyl acrylate, alryl methacrylate, diallyl maleate, and the like. In one embodiment the polymer matrix does not allow any, or any detectable amount, of an adverse agent to diffuse out of it, particularly in those instances in which the adverse agent can penetrate a patient's skin.<br>
[00102]	In one embodiment, the adverse agent component has a thickness of no<br>
less than about 10 um. hi another embodiment, the adverse agent component has a thickness of no less than about 20 um. In another embodiment, the adverse agent component has a thickness of no less than about 50 jam. In another embodiment, the adverse agent component has a thickness of no greater than about 250 um. In another embodiment, the adverse agent component has a thickness of no greater than about 200 [4m. In another embodiment, the adverse agent component has a thickness of no greater than about 150 p,m.<br>
[00103]	The barrier 150, as shown in FIGS. 1, 2, and 3, is a substantially<br>
continuous component adjacent to the distal surface of the active agent component 130 on one side and the adverse agent component 160 on the other side.<br><br>
 [00104]	The permeability of the barrier to such a solvent is such that solvent<br>
can pass through the barrier or that the solvent may dissolve or erode at least a portion of the barrier, such that at least a portion of the active agent and/or adverse agent can pass through the barrier or an channel formed in the barrier in the presence of solvent. Movement of active agent and/or adverse agent across the barrier and/or a channel formed by dissolution of the barrier hi the presence of a solvent will occur hi amounts and at a rate that will vary depending on the particular composition and configuration of the dosage form, such as the relative amounts and types of active agent and adverse agent. However, preferably a sufficient amount of adverse agent, including the amount which passes through the barrier, will be extracted from the dosage form to cause an unpleasant biological effect or to blunt or block at least one biological effect of the amount of active agent that is also extracted by the solvent, when both the active agent and the adverse agent are absorbed into the blood stream of an animal. It is preferred that at least a portion of the adverse agent will pass through the barrier after the barrier has been exposed to solvent for a time period of less than 30 minutes, more preferably less than 15 minutes, and most preferably less than 5 minutes. The amount of adverse agent that will pass through the barrier in the presence of a solvent is preferably more than 10 [Ag, more preferably more than 50 jj,g, and most preferably more than 200 p,g.<br>
[00105]	Although extraction may be performed in vitro, such as in a laboratory<br>
type setting (e.g., by immersion of a dosage form in a beaker of solvent), it should also be understood that extraction of adverse agent and active agent may also take place in vivo, such as in the saliva present in the oral cavity or the gastric fluid present in the stomach.<br>
[00106]	The impermeability of the barrier to diffusion of active agent and<br>
adverse agent in the absence of a solvent is such that less than a significant amount, and preferably none, of active agent or adverse agent diffuse across the barrier during normal storage or use of the dosage form. The precise amounts which are less than significant will vary depending on the particular composition and intended therapeutic purpose of the dosage form, but it will<br><br>
be understood to include any amounts of active agent or adverse agent that do not significantly alter the therapeutic effect of the dosage form (e.g., the active agent concentration in the skin-contacting component does not change significantly due to diffusion of active agent across the barrier and a pharmacologically effective amount of adverse agent does not diffuse across the barrier and into the skin-contacting component). Any insignificant amounts of active agent that may diffuse across the barrier are preferably less than 5%, more preferably less than 1%, and most preferably less than 0.1% by weight of the total active agent in the dosage form. Any insignificant amounts of active agent that may diffuse across the barrier will preferably do so over a time period greater than 1 month, more preferably greater than 6 months, and most preferably greater than 2 years.<br>
[00107]	In a preferred embodiment, the active agent is not in diffusional<br>
communication with the reservoir component during normal usage. Diffusional communication is understood to mean that a substance, such as an active agent, is able to diffuse from one area to another by passing through or across one or more solid or liquid media.<br>
[00108]	Suitable barriers can comprise, for example, dissolvable films, such as<br>
polyvinyl alcohol or modified polyvinyl alcohols. Suitable barriers may also comprise porous or microporous films.<br>

polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylenes, and polyethylenes such as high density polyethylene. Suitable barriers can also be multi-component films comprised of but not limited to polyethylene terephthalate-aluminum-polyethylene composites or polyethylene terephthalate-ethylene vinyl acetate composites. Also, barriers can be comprised of a polyperfluorocarbon. Suitable barriers may also be comprised of a polymer based material including but not limited to a cellulose polymer, such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose or hydroxyethyl cellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrolidine. The hydroxyethyl cellulose may be NATROSOL® 250 HNF (available from the Aqualon Division of Hercules Inc., Wilmington, DE). The hydroxypropyl cellulose<br><br>
may be KLUCEL® HXAF (available from the Aqualon Division of Hercules Inc.). A suitable plasticizer may be incorporated into the barrier, such as but not limited to triethanolamine, triacetin, glycerol monooleate, polyethyleneglycol 600, levulinic acid, and mixtures of any two or more of the foregoing.<br>
[00110]	Barriers of the present invention may be formed having a<br>
discontinuous structure that can be subsequently laminated or otherwise attached to the discontinuous structure of the skin-contacting component. It is preferred that the barrier and the polymeric material or matrix of the active agent component are fully aligned. It is not necessary for the two components to be completely registered, however, as long as the barrier serves to deter diffusion of the active agent and adverse agent through the barrier component. Discontinuous barriers of the present invention may also be formed at the same time that the discontinuities in the polymeric material or matrix of the active agent component are formed. For example, a continuous barrier film may be coated with a continuous skin-contacting polymeric matrix or laminated to a continuous skin-contacting polymeric matrix. Channels or holes may be created in the laminate using any suitable hole-forming process, such as punching, so that aligned channels are simultaneously created in both the barrier and the skin-contacting polymeric matrix.<br>

surface coating applied to one of the other surfaces present in the dosage form,<br>

comprises a transdermal dosage form 500 comprising an active agent component which is a skin-contacting component 510 comprising a skin-contacting polymeric matrix 515 and an active agent, an adverse agent or reservoir component 560 comprising an adverse agent to the active agent, and a barrier 5 50.<br>
10116]	The skin-contacting component has a proximal, skin-contacting surface<br>
520 and a distal surface opposed to the skin-contacting surface 530. As shown in FIG. 9, the distal surface opposed to the skin-contacting surface 530 is a structured surface composed of a series of ridges or pyramids. The barrier 550 is present as a component that is adjacent to the distal surface of the skin-contacting component 530, and as such has an interlocking pattern of ridges or pyramids. The non-patterned side of the barrier is adjacent to the reservoir component 560. A backing 570 is adjacent to the reservoir 560 and provides an outer surface 590 of the dosage form 500.<br>
[0117]	The ridges or pyramids may be formed by any well known techniques<br>
for preparing embossed or microreplicated polymeric components, such as<br><br>

[0118]	Suitable barriers include barrier materials of the embodiments<br>
described in FIGS. 1,2, and 3.<br>
[0119]	The channels 540 are formed connecting the skin-contacting surface<br>
520 to the reservoir component 560. As shown in Figure 9, the channels 540 are filled with the barrier 550. The barrier is permeable to and/or at least partially soluble in a solvent selected from the group consisting of water, ethanol, ether, and mixtures thereof, and the barrier is substantially impermeable to diffusion of active agent and adverse agent in the absence of said solvent. The ridges or pyramids of the skin-contacting polymeric matrix 515 are preferably formed such that a small opening exists between neighboring ridges or pyramids. As shown in FIG. 9, the ridges or pyramids abut each other at a point contact. It should be understood that a point contact between neighboring ridges can effectively allow for fluid communication of solvent between the skin-contacting surface 520 and the reservoir component 560. It should be further understood that the channel may contain an insubstantial amount of the skin-contacting polymeric matrix, but can still substantially provide an open passage to solvent. In one embodiment, the connection between neighboring ridges or pyramids is of an insubstantial amount with a thickness of less than about 5 jim. In another embodiment, the connection between neighboring ridges or pyramids has a thickness of less than about 1 urn.<br>
[0120]	In this embodiment, suitable skin-contacting components, skin-<br>
contacting polymeric matrices, active agents, reservoir components, and adverse agents are as described in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 1, 2, and 3.<br>
[0121]	In another embodiment, shown in FIG. 10, the present invention<br>
comprises a transdermal dosage form 600 comprising an active agent component which is a skin-contacting component 610 comprising a skin-contacting polymeric matrix 615 and an active agent, an adverse agent or reservoir component 660 comprising an adverse agent to the active agent, and<br><br>

As shown in FIG. 10, the skin-contacting polymeric matrix 615 is a structured component comprising ridges or truncated pyramids.<br>
[0122]	The channels 640 provide open fluid communication between the skin-<br>
contacting surface 620 to the barrier 650. The ridges or pyramids of the skin-contacting component 610 are preferably formed such that a small opening exists between neighboring ridges or pyramids. As shown in FIG. 10, the ridges or pyramids abut each other at a point contact. It should be understood that a point contact between neighboring ridges can effectively allow for fluid communication of solvent between the skin-contacting surface 620 and the barrier 650. It should be further understood that the channel may contain an insubstantial amount of the skin-contacting polymeric matrix, but can still substantially provide an open passage to solvent.

amount with a thickness of less than about 5 (am. In another embodiment, the<br>
i<br>
connection between neighboring ridges or pyramids has a thickness of less than about 1 um.<br>
[0123]	As shown in FIG. 11, the dosage form of FIG. 10 may further comprise<br>
a structured release liner 680 which serves to protect the structured surface of the skin-contacting polymeric matrix 615 prior to use of the dosage form.<br>
[0124]	La this embodiment, suitable skin-contacting components, skin-<br>
contacting polymeric matrices, active agents, reservoir components, barriers, and adverse agents are as described in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 1,2, and 3.<br>
[0125]	In another embodiment, shown in FIG. 12, the present invention<br>
comprises a transdermal dosage form 700 comprising an active agent component which is a skin-contacting component 710 comprising a skin-contacting polymeric matrix 715 and an active agent, an adverse agent or reservoir component 760 comprising an adverse agent to the active agent, and a barrier 750. The skin-contacting component has a proximal, skin-contacting<br><br>
surface 720, a distal surface opposed to the skin-contacting surface 730, and channels 740 passing substantially entirely between the proximal and distal surfaces. The channels 740 connecting the skin-contacting surface 720 to the reservoir component 760 may be formed from one or more dissolvable, erodible, or porous beads imbedded within the skin-contacting polymeric matrix 715. One or more such beads may. extend completely through the skin-contacting component 710. Alternatively, one or more beads may be adjacent to each other so as to effectively provide a channel through the skin-contacting component 710 in the presence of a solvent. The beads preferably extend from the proximal, skin-contacting surface 720 to the distal surface opposed to the skin-contacting surface 730, but it should be understood that insubstantial amounts of the skin-contacting polymeric matrix may be present on one or both sides of the bead(s). Thus, the channel may contain a small amount of the skin-contacting polymeric matrix 715, but will still provide substantially open passage to solvent. In one embodiment, the amount of skin-contacting polymeric matrix 715 within the channel 740 is of an insubstantial amount with a thickness of less than 5 ^m. In another embodiment, the amount of skin-contacting polymeric matrix 715 within the channel 740 is less than about 1 urn.<br>
[0126]	A number of optional features may be included with any one of the<br>
embodiments described herein such as but not limited to an overlay backing, a porous medium, a release rate controlling membrane, additional components, and/or additional channels.<br>
[0127]	As shown in FIGS. 13a and 13b, an overlay backing 870 extends<br>
beyond the area of the adverse agent or reservoir component 860, barrier 850, and active agent or skin-contacting component 810 to a sufficient extent to allow the peripheral edge of overlay backing 870 to contact the skin surface of a patient. An additional channel or channels may also be present in the area between the overlay backing 870 and the adverse agent or reservoir component 860, barrier 850, and/or active agent or skin-contacting component 810.<br><br>
 [0128]	The edges of the overlay backing 870 are coated with an overlay<br>
pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) 880 that is used to secure the edges of the overlay backing 870 to a skin surface. Any pressure sensitive adhesive suitable for use in skin-contacting applications, as previously described, can be used as the overlay PSA 880. Typical examples of flexible backing materials employed as conventional tape backings which may be useful for the present invention include those made of polymer films such as polypropylene; polyethylene, particularly low density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene, metallocene polyethylenes, and high density polyethylene; polyvinyl chloride; polyester (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate); ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer; polyurethane; cellulose acetate; and ethyl cellulose. Backings that are componented, such as polyethylene terephthalate-aluminum-polyethylene composites, are also suitable. Fabrics and non-wovens are also suitable. In a preferred embodiment, the overlay backing is a continuous polymeric film that prevents ingress of external moisture into the reservoir component from activities such as showering and bathing. Examples of such continuous films include polyurethane, polyethylene, and polyester.<br>
[0129]	In certain embodiments, the overlay backing 870 is large enough to<br>
define an air channel 890 between the periphery of he adverse agent component, the barrier and the active agent component and the inner periphery of the overlay PSA 880.<br>
[0130]	As shown in FIG. 14, the overlay backing 870 is continuously coated<br>
with an overlay pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) 880 that is used to secure the edges of the overlay backing 870 to a skin surface. An additional, optional feature is a porous medium 865 included between the reservoir 860 and the overlay PSA 880. In this embodiment, the overlay PSA 880 serves a dual purpose. The area of the overlay PSA 880 extending beyond the area of the reservoir component 860, barrier 850, and active agent or skin-contacting component 810 serves to secure the dosage form to a skin surface and defines air channel 890. The area of the overlay PSA 880 that does not extend beyond the reservoir component 860 provides secure lamination of the overlay backing 870 to the porous medium 865 (or alternatively to the reservoir<br><br>
component 860 in dosage forms that do not have a porous component). Also, an additional channel or channels may be present in the area between the overlay backing 870 and the adverse agent or reservoir component 860, barrier 850, active agent or skin-contacting component 810, and/or porous medium 865.<br>
[0131]	The porous medium 865 can be any porous medium, such as a woven<br>
fabric, microporous film, or other open, mesh-like material. If the dosage form 800 is immersed in a solvent bath, then the porous medium 865 allows for fluid communication of the solvent with the top surface of the reservoir 860.<br>
[0132]	The porous medium 865 can be used in conjunction with an overlay<br>
backing 870, but it is not necessary to combine these optional features. For example, the porous medium 865 may also be present in a dosage form as shown in FIGS. 15a and 15b, where all of the features are the same as shown in FIGS, la and Ib, except that a porous medium 865 is inserted between the backing 170 and adverse agent or reservoir component 160.<br>
[0133]	The active agent component which may be a skin-contacting<br>
component, may comprise a number of additional components in addition to a polymeric material or matrix and an active agent. Additional components of the active agent or skin-contacting component can include skin penetration enhancers, drug solubilizers, plasticizers, anti-oxidants, colorants, and the like.<br>
[0134]	Examples of excipients useful as skin penetration enhancers or<br>
solubilizers in transdermal drug delivery systems include Cs-Cu fatty acids such as isostearic acid, octanoic acid, and oleic acid; Cg-C24 fatty alcohols such as oleyl alcohol and lauryl alcohol; lower alkyl esters of Cg-C24 fatty acids such as ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, butyl stearate, and methyl laurate; monoglycerides of Cg-C24 fatty acids such as glyceryl monolaurate; tetraglycol (tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol polyethylene glycol ether); tetraethylene glycol (ethanol,2,2'-(oxybis(ethylenoxy))diglycol); polyethylene glycol; propylene glycol; N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide; terpenes, such as d-limonene, menthol, and terpineol.<br><br>
 [0133<br>
	In compositions of the active agent or skin-contacting component of<br>
the present invention, the skin penetration enhancers, drug solubilizers, plasticizers, and other additives can be dispersed or mixed, preferably substantially uniformly, and more preferably dissolved in the composition. Where the additive is a penetration enhancer, it is present in an amount that enhances active agent permeation through the skin compared to a like composition not containing the penetration enhancer(s) when this phenomenon is measured using a standard skin penetration model, such as set forth in U.S. Patent No. 5,585,111 (Peterson), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, the. total amount of penetration enhancer and solubilizer is less than about 40% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. In another embodiment, the total amount of penetration enhancer and solubilizer is less than about 30% based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
[0136]	Active agent or skin-contacting component compositions of the<br>
invention can be prepared by combining the polymer matrix, active agent, and optional additives, such as penetration enhancers, with an organic solvent (e.g., ethyl acetate, isopropanol, methanol, acetone, 2-butanone, ethanol, toluene, alkanes, and mixtures thereof) to provide a coating composition. The mixture is shaken or stirred until a homogeneous coating composition is obtained. The resulting composition is then applied to a release liner using conventional coating methods (such as but not limited to knife coating or extrusion die coating) to provide a predetermined uniform thickness of coating composition. Non-continuous or discontinuous coatings may be prepared using methods such as stripe coating, screen printing, and ink-jet printing.<br>
[0137]	Suitable release liners include conventional release liners comprising a<br>
known sheet material such as a polyester web, a polyethylene web, a polystyrene web, or a polyethylene-coated paper coated with a suitable fluoropolymer or silicone based coating. The release liner that has been coated with the composition is then dried and laminated onto a barrier component using conventional methods. An optional tie component, heat, and/or pressure may be used to connect the skin-contacting component with<br><br>
the barrier component. In addition, the skin-contacting component compositions may be directly coated onto the barrier component and subsequently dried and laminated to a release liner.<br>
[0138]	When the adverse agent or reservoir component comprises a pressure-<br>
sensitive adhesive or similar polymeric material or matrix, then the adverse agent or reservoir component compositions of the invention can be prepared using methods similar to those for preparing the active agent or skin-contacting component, with the exception that an adverse agent is used in place of the active agent to prepare the coating composition. Alternatively, the adverse agent or reservoir component can comprise a porous medium, such as a porous or microporous film. The adverse agent can be dissolved hi an impregnating solvent and the porous or microporous film is soaked in the solvent for a sufficient period of time to allow the adverse agent to penetrate the pores of the film. The solvent is then dried leaving the adverse agent dispersed or mixed throughout the film. The reservoir component is laminated to the barrier side of the barrier/sldn-contacting multilaminate, optionally using heat, pressure, and/or an additional tie component to ensure adequate contact between the reservoir component and barrier.<br>
[0139]	A backing is laminated to the surface of the adverse agent or reservoir<br>
component opposed to the barrier, optionally using heat, pressure and/or an additional tie component to ensure adequate contact between the reservoir component and backing. One skilled in the art will appreciate that it may be preferred to vary the order of lamination steps depending on the types and thickness of the components comprising the dosage form.<br>
[0140]	The transdermal dosage forms of the invention can be made in the<br>
form of an article such as a tape, a patch, a sheet, a dressing or any other form known to those skilled in the art. Generally, the dosage form will be in the form of a patch of a size suitable to deliver a preselected amount of active agent through the skin.<br>
[0141]	In one embodiment, the dosage form has a surface area greater than<br>
about 1 cm2. In another embodiment, the dosage form has a surface area greater than about 5 cm2. In another embodiment, the dosage form has a<br><br>
surface area greater than 10cm2. In another embodiment, the dosage form has a surface area less than about 100 cm2. In another embodiment, the dosage form has a surface area less than about 40 cm2.<br>
[0142]	Dosage forms of the present invention typically comprise a release<br>
liner that covers and protects the skin-contacting surface prior to use by a patient. Suitable release liners include conventional release liners comprising a known sheet material such as a polyester web, a polyethylene web, a polypropylene web, or a polyethylene-coated paper coated with a suitable fluoropolymer or silicone based coating. Dosage forms of the present invention are typically packaged individually in a foil-lined pouch for storage. Dosage forms of the present invention may alternatively be provided in a rolled or stacked form suitable for use with a dispensing apparatus.<br>

typically packaged individually in a foil-lined pouch for storage. Dosage forms of the present invention may alternatively be provided in a rolled or stacked form suitable for use with a dispensing apparatus.<br>
[0144]	In one embodiment, shown in FIG. 16, the present invention comprises<br>
a transdermal dosage form 100 comprising an active agent component 110, which can be a skin-contacting component comprising a skin-contacting polymeric material and an active agent, an antagonist or adverse agent reservoir 160 comprising an adverse agent to the active agent, a barrier 150, and a porous medium or material 165. The active agent component defines a proximal or skin-contacting surface 120 and has a distal surface 130 opposed to, i.e., opposite to or in contraposition to, the proximal surface. The barrier 150 is present as a component that is adjacent to the distal surface of the active agent component 130 and the adverse agent reservoir 160. The porous medium or material 165 is adjacent to the adverse agent reservoir 160. An overlay backing 170 is adjacent to the porous medium 165 and provides an outer surface 190 of the dosage form 100.<br>
[0145]	The porous medium 165 is in fluid communication with the proximal<br>
surface 120. Fluid communication is meant to indicate that liquid may flow freely between the proximal surface 120 and the porous medium 165. That is,<br><br>
if the dosage form is immersed in a liquid such that the proximal surface is in contact with the liquid, then the liquid will also be able to contact the porous medium 165. The two-sided arrow 185 in FIG. 16 shows an area of fluid communication between the proximal surface 120 and the porous medium 165. One of the functions of the porous medium or material 165 can be to provide capillary force to the surface of the adverse agent layer in the presence of a liquid.<br>
[0146]	The active agent component 110 comprises a polymeric material and<br>
an active agent. The active agent is preferably dispersed homogeneously throughout the polymeric material, and more preferably dissolved within the polymeric material. The proximal or skin-contacting surface 120 should be sufficiently conformable when placed on a skin surface so as to make intimate contact with at least a portion of the skin surface.

[0150]	In one embodiment, the polymeric material of the active agent<br>
component may comprise a pressure-sensitive adhesive. Preferred pressure-sensitive adhesives for use in the dosage forms of the invention include acrylates, polyisobutylenes, silicone polymers, and mixtures thereof.

sensitive adhesives. Examples of suitable monomers for use in acrylate copolymers include alkyl acrylates, such as isooctyl, 2-ethylhexyl, n-butyl, ethyl, methyl, and dimethylhexyl, and alkyl methacrylates, such as lauryl, isodecyl, and tridecyl.

[0155]	The active agent will be present in an amount such that the<br>
composition delivers a therapeutically effective amount for the condition being treated. This amount will vary according to the type of active agent used, the condition to be treated, the amount of time the composition is allowed to remain in contact with the skin of the subject, and other factors known to those of skill in the art. For example, information on dosing and the amount of opioid agonist active agent present in a transdermaJ dosage form is set forth in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2002/0119187 Al, filed September 26, 2001, entitled "Composition for the Transdermal Delivery of Fentanyl" by Cantor et al. and U.S. Published Patent Application No, 2003/0026829 Al, filed March 15, 2002, entitled "Transdermal Administration of Fentanyl and Analogs Thereof by Venkatraman et al. each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety for all purposes. In one embodiment, the amount of active agent present in the transdermal drug delivery composition of the invention is greater than about 0.01 wt-%, based on the total weight of the composition of the active agent component.

drug delivery composition of the invention is less than about 20.0 wt-%, based on the total weight 16 of the composition of the active agent component.<br>
[0156]	In FIG. 1, the adverse agent reservoir 160 is connected on one side to a<br>
barrier 150 component and on the other side to the porous medium 165. The reservoir may be a polymeric material, porous film, or other component suitable for containing an adverse agent. Preferably, the adverse agent reservoir 160 is capable of containing a sufficient amount of adverse agent to blunt or block at least one biological effect of the active agent or to cause at least one unpleasant side effect in a patient or animal which has absorbed the total amount of active agent in the dosage form 100. This amount can vary according to the amount and type of active agent in the dosage form. The adverse agent component comprises an adverse agent in any form or composition or reservoir which allows the adverse agent to be at least partially extracted in the presence of a solvent, including but not limited to, water, etnanol or ether, or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, the adverse agent can be dispersed in a polymeric material, including but not limited to, •' the polymeric materials which are suitable for incorporation into the active agent component.<br>
[0157]	Suitable polymeric materials or matrices for use in the adverse agent<br>
component include, but are not limited to, acrylates, natural rubbers, and/or polyisobutylenes, polyisoprenes, styrenic block copolymers, polyvinylethers, silicone polymers, polyurethanes, polyurethane-ureas, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the adverse agent is preferably dispersed substantially homogeneously throughout a polymeric material. In one embodiment, the adverse agent is preferably dispersed substantially homogeneously throughout a polymeric material. In one embodiment, the adverse agent is dissolved in the polymeric material. In another embodiment, the adverse agent component includes solid crystals of adverse agent dispersed throughout the polymeric material. In certain embodiments, the polymeric matrix is preferably a pressure sensitive adhesive. Suitable pressure-sensitive adhesives include those suitable for use as the polymeric material of the active agent component.<br><br>
Additionally, pressure-sensitive adhesives that are not suitable for direct skin contact can be suitable for use as the polymeric material of the adverse agent.<br>
[0158]	The adverse agent component can also comprise a porous medium or<br>
material, such as a woven fabric, porous or microporous film, or other open, mesh-like material, wherein at least a portion of the pores contain adverse agent. The adverse agent can be present within the pores in any form, including but not limited to a liquid, a gel or a solid, such as a solid crystalline or powdered material. For example, the adverse agent can be mixed with a carrier, such as a viscous liquid, semi-solid or gel material. Examples of suitable materials for incorporation into the adverse agent component include, but are not limited to, microporous films formed by extruding polyethylene or polypropylene with mineral oil as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,539,256 (Shipman), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.<br>
[0159]	Other polymer materials of the adverse agent component may include<br>
but are not limited to polyethylene; polypropylene; ethylene/propylene copolymers; ethylene/ethylacrylate copolymers; ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers; silicone elastomers, especially the medical-grade polydimethylsiloxanes; neoprene rubber; polyisobutylene; chlorinated polyethylene; polyvinyl chloride; vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer; polymethacrylate polymer (hydrogel); polyvinylidene chloride; poly(etirylene terephthalate); butyl rubber; epichlorohydrin rubber; ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer; ethylene-vinyloxyethanol copolymer; silicone copolymers, for example, polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymers, polysiloxane-polyethyleneoxide copolymers, polysiloxane-polymethacrylate copolymers, polysiloxane-alkylene copolymers (e.g., polysiloxane-ethylene copolymers), polysiloxane-alkylenesilane copolymers (e.g., polysiloxane-ethylenesilane copolymers), and the like; cellulose polymers, for example methyl or ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and cellulose esters; polycarbonates; polytetrafluoroethylene; and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the polymer matrix has a glass-transition temperature below room temperature. The polymer can, but need not necessarily, have a degree<br><br>
of crystallinity at room temperature. Cross-linking monomeric units or sites can be incorporated into the polymers. For example, cross-linking monomers can be incorporated into polyacrylate polymers. The cross-linking monomers provide sites for cross-linking the polymer matrix after microdispersing the adverse agent into the polymer. Known cross-Unking monomers for polyacrylate polymers include, but are not limited to, polymethacrylic esters of polyols such as butylene diacrylate and dimethacrylate, trimethylol propane trimethacrylate, and the like. Other monomers that provide cross-Unking sites include allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, diallyl maleate, and the like. In one embodiment the polymer matrix does not allow any, or any detectable amount, of an adverse agent to diffuse out of it, particularly in those instances in which the adverse agent can penetrate a patient's skin.<br>

less than about 10 |jm. In another embodiment, the adverse agent component has a thickness of no less than about 20 um. In another embodiment, the<br>
i<br>
adverse agent component has a thickness of no less than about 50 um. In another embodiment, the adverse agent component has a thickness of no greater than about 250 um. In another embodiment, the adverse agent component has a thickness of no greater than about 200 um. In another embodiment, the adverse agent component has a thickness of no greater than about 150 um.<br>
[0161]	The barrier 150 shown in FIG. 16 is a component that is adjacent to the<br>
distal surface of the active agent component 130 on one side and the adverse agent reservoir 160 on the other side. The barrier is permeable to and/or at least partially soluble in a solvent selected from the group consisting of water, ethanol, ether, and mixtures thereof, and the barrier is substantially impermeable to diffusion of active agent and adverse agent in the absence of said solvent. In certain embodiments, the barrier can be a dissolvable film.<br>
[0162]	In relation to the present invention, impermeability of the barrier to<br>
diffusion of active agent and adverse agent is defined such that only insignificant amounts, and preferably none, of active agent or adverse agent<br><br>
are able to diffuse across the barrier during ordinary use or storage of the dosage form. The precise amount that is insignificant will vary depending on the particular application for the dosage form, but it will be understood to include any amounts of active agent or adverse agent that do not significantly alter the therapeutic effect of the dosage form (e.g., the active agent concentration in the active agent component does not change significantly due to diffusion of active agent across the barrier and a pharmacologically effective amount of adverse agent does not diffuse across the barrier and into the active agent component). Any insignificant amounts of active agent or adverse agent that may diffuse across the barrier are preferably less than 5%, more preferably less than 1%, and most preferably less than 0.1% by weight of the total active agent in the dosage form. Any insignificant amounts of active agent or adverse agent that may diffuse across the barrier will preferably do so over a time period greater than 1 month, more preferably greater than 6 months, and most preferably greater than 2 years.<br>
[0163]	Suitable barriers can be films comprised of but not limited to<br>
polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate; polypropylenes; and polyethylenes such as high density polyethylene. Suitable barriers can also be multi-componented firms comprised of but not limited to polyethylene terephthalate-aluminum-polyethylene composites or polyethylene terephthalate-ethylene vinyl acetate composites. Other barriers can be comprised of polyperfluorocarbon. Other barriers may be comprised of a plasticizer and/or a polymer based material including but not limited to a cellulose polymer, such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose or hydroxyethyl cellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrolidine. The hydroxyethyl cellulose may be NATROSOL® 250 HNF (available from the Aqualon Division of Hercules Inc., Wilmington, DE). The hydroxypropyl cellulose may be KLUCEL® HXAF (available from the Aqualon Division of Hercules Inc.). The plasticizer may be a compound such as but not limited to triethanolamine, triacetin, glycerol monooleate, polyethyleneglycol 600, levulinic acid, and/or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
 [0164]	In one embodiment, the barrier thickness is greater than about 1 (j,m.<br>
In another embodiment, the barrier thickness is greater than about 10 um. In another embodiment, the barrier thickness is greater than about 20 pin. In another embodiment, the barrier thickness is less than about 100 |jm. In another embodiment, the barrier thickness is less than about 80 jam. In another embodiment, the barrier thickness is less than about 75 fjm. In another embodiment, the barrier thickness is less than about 60 um. In another embodiment, the barrier thickness is less than about 50 p.m.<br>
[0165]	Barriers   of  the   present   invention   may   be   formed   having   a<br>
discontinuous structure that can be subsequently laminated or otherwise attached to the discontinuous structure of the active agent component. It is preferred that the barrier and the polymeric material or matrix of the active agent component are fully aligned. It is not necessary for the two components to be completely registered, however, as long as the barrier serves to deter diffusion of the active agent and adverse agent through the barrier component. Discontinuous barriers of the present invention may also be formed at the same time that the discontinuities in the polymeric material or matrix of the active agent component are formed. For example, a continuous barrier film may be coated with a continuous skin-contacting polymeric matrix or laminated to a continuous skin-contacting polymeric matrix. Apertures or holes may be created in the laminate using any suitable hole-forming process, such as punching, so that aligned apertures are simultaneously created in both the barrier and the skin-contacting polymeric matrix.<br>
[0166]	Barriers of the present invention can also comprise an impermeable<br>
surface coating applied to one of the other surfaces present in the dosage form, such as the distal surface of the active agent component, which is opposed to the skin-contacting surface, or the or surface of the adverse agent component facing the active agent component. Examples of suitable coatings include fluoropolymers, such as polymers or copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene, and/or vinylidene fluoride. Terpolymers of tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene, and vinylidene fluoride, such as<br><br>
Ityneon™ fluorothermoplastic THV are preferred coatings. In one embodiment, the thickness of impermeable surface coating is from about 0.5 to about 10 um. In another embodiment, the thickness of impermeable surface coating is from about 1 to about 5 um. In another embodiment, the thickness of impermeable surface coating is from about 2 to about 4 um. In another embodiment, the barrier is a thin coating on the surface of a microporous film reservoir or adverse agent component.<br>
[01671	In one embodiment, the barrier of the present invention is a<br>
continuous, planar component in the form of a slab. In another embodiment, the barrier may be patterned or comprise channels, such that the barrier is discontinuous. Suitable barriers can include a plurality of strips wherein the strips are separated by channels, an annular disk with a central channel filled with air or any inert gas, and a disk with a plurality of cylindrical air channels.<br>
[0168]	A number of optional features may be included with any one of the<br>
embodiments described herein such as but not limited to an overlay backing, a release rate controlling membrane, channels, and/or additional components.<br>
[0169]	As shown in FIG. 16, an overlay backing 170 extends beyond the area<br>
of the adverse agent or reservoir component 160, barrier 150, and active agent component 110 to a sufficient extent to allow the peripheral edge of overlay backing 170 to contact the skin surface of a patient. An additional channel or channels may also be present in the area between the overlay backing 170 and the periphery of the adverse agent or reservoir component 160, barrier 150, and/or active agent component 110.<br>
[0170]	The peripheral edges of the overlay backing 170 are coated with an<br>
overlay pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) 180 that is used to secure the edges of the overlay backing 170 to a skin surface. Any pressure sensitive adhesive suitable for use in skin-contacting applications, as previously described, can be used as the overlay PSA 180. Typical examples of flexible backing materials employed as conventional tape backings which may be useful for the present invention include those made of polymer films such as polypropylene; polyethylene, particularly low density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene, metallocene polyethylenes, and high density polyethylene;<br><br>
polyvinyl chloride; polyester (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate); ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer; polyurethane; cellulose acetate; and ethyl cellulose. Backings that are componented, such as polyethylene terephthalate-aluminum-polyethylene composites, are also suitable. Fabrics and non-wovens are also suitable. In a preferred embodiment, the overlay backing is a continuous polymeric film that prevents ingress of external moisture into the adverse agent component from activities such as showering and bathing. Examples of such continuous films include polyurethane, polyethylene, and polyester.<br>
[0171]	In certain embodiments, the overlay backing 170 is large enough to<br>
define an air channel number between the periphery of the adverse agent component, the barrier and the active agent component and the inner periphery of the overlay PS A 180.<br>
[0172]	As shown in FIG. 18, the overlay backing 170 is continuously coated<br>
with an overlay pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) 180 that is used to secure the edges of the overlay backing 170 to a skin surface. In this embodiment, the overlay PSA 180 serves a dual purpose. The area of the overlay PSA 180 extending beyond the area of the porous medium 165, adverse agent reservoir 160, barrier 150, and active agent component 110 serves to secure the dosage form to a skin surface. The area of the overlay PSA 180 that does not extend beyond the adverse agent or reservoir component 160 provides secure lamination of the overlay backing 170 to the porous medium 165. An optional barrier component may be placed between the overlay PSA 180 and the porous medium 165 in order to prevent any interaction between the overlay PSA 180 and the porous medium 165. This optional component is preferably a flexible backing material as described above and is more preferably a polyethylene film.<br>
[0173]	The porous medium 165 is a material or construct characterized in that<br>
it has openings that allow the passage or absorption of liquids. Examples of a porous medium include microporous films, such as microporous films formed by extruding polyethylene or polypropylene with mineral oil as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,539,256 (Shipman); fibrous webs; woven fabrics and textiles; open-cell foams; grooved films; and other open, mesh-like materials.<br><br>
A porous medium may have the appearance of a solid matrix characterized by a fine network of microscopic openings. In another aspect, it may be a structured slab or film having channels or grooves that allow the passage of liquid. It should be understood that certain structures with open channels or grooves will act as a porous medium when the open channels or grooves are adjacent to another component, such as the adverse agent reservoir.<br>
[0174]	As shown in FIG. 16, the porous medium 165 is adjacent to the<br>
adverse agent reservoir 160, such that if the dosage form 100 is immersed in a solvent bath, then the porous medium 165 allows for fluid communication of the solvent with the top surface of the reservoir 160. The porous medium 165 may align with the adverse agent reservoir 160. Alternatively, the porous medium 165 may extend beyond the area of the adverse agent reservoir 160 and may fill part or all of the void area shown in FIG. 16 where the fluid communication between the porous medium 165 and the skin-contacting surface 120 takes place.<br>
[0175]	In an alternative embodiment, shown in FIG. 19, the porous medium<br>
and adverse agent reservoir may form a single integral component 175 of the dosage form. That is, the porous medium may serve as the carrier matrix of the adverse agent reservoir.<br>
[0176]	As shown in FIG. 17, the adverse agent reservoir 160 may be adjacent<br>
to the overlay backing 170, and the porous medium 165 is interposed directly between the adverse agent reservoir 160 and the barrier 150. Furthermore, the porous medium need not be present as a distinct component in contact with a major surface of the adverse agent reservoir, so long as the porous medium is adjacent to the adverse agent reservoir and is in fluid communication with the active agent component. Thus, for example, the porous medium may be an annular disk surrounding a central adverse agent reservoir, an interpenetrating network within the adverse agent reservoir, or other like configurations.<br>
[0177]	In another embodiment, shown in FIG. 20, the present invention<br>
comprises a transdermal dosage form 200 comprising a release liner 240, an overlay backing 270, an active agent reservoir 210, an adverse agent reservoir 260, a barrier 250, and a porous medium 265. The barrier 250 is present as a<br><br>
component that is adjacent to active agent reservoir 210 and the adverse agent reservoir 260. The porous medium 265 is adjacent to the adverse agent reservoir 260. The overlay backing 270 is adjacent to the porous medium 265 and provides an outer surface 290 of the dosage form 200. As shown, the release liner 240 has a release surface 245 adjacent to the active agent reservoir 210. In alternative embodiments, one or more components, such as a skin-contacting adhesive and/or a rate-limiting membrane may be interposed between the active agent reservoir 210 and the release surface 245. The active agent within the active agent reservoir 210 is in diffusional communication with the release surface. "Diffusional communication" is understood to mean that a substance, such as a active agent, is able to diffuse from one area to another by passing through or across one or more solid or liquid media.<br>
[0178]	The porous medium 265 is in "fluid communication" with the release<br>
surface 245. Fluid communication is meant to indicate that liquid may flow freely between two areas such as the skin-contacting surface 220 and the release surface 245. That is, liquid present on the exposed areas of the release surface 245 will also be able to contact the porous medium 265. The two-sided arrow 285 shows the area of fluid communication between the release surface 245 and the porous medium 265.<br>
[0179]	In another embodiment, shown in FIG. 21, the present invention<br>
comprises a transdermal dosage form 300 comprising an active agent component 310 comprising a skin-contacting polymeric material and an active agent, an adverse agent reservoir 360 comprising an adverse agent to me active agent, and a porous medium 365. The active agent component defines a proximal, skin-contacting surface 320 and has a distal surface 330 opposed to the skin-contacting surface. The porous medium 365 is adjacent to the distal surface opposed to the skin-contacting surface 330 and the adverse agent reservoir 360. An overlay backing 370 with an overlay PSA 380 is adjacent to the adverse agent reservoir 360 and provides an outer surface 390 of the dosage form 300.<br>
[0180]	The porous medium 365 is in fluid communication with the skin-<br>
contacting surface 320. Fluid communication is meant to indicate that liquid<br><br>
may flow freely between the skin-contacting surface 320 and the porous medium 365. That is, if the dosage form is immersed in a liquid such that the skin-contacting surface is in contact with the liquid, then the liquid will also be able to contact the porous medium 365.<br>
[0181]	In this embodiment, adverse agent in the adverse agent reservoir 360<br>
and active agent in the active agent component 310 should not be in difiusional communication with each other during normal storage and usage.<br>
[0182]	The active agent component may comprise a number of additional<br>
components in addition to a polymeric material and an active agent. Additional components of the active agent component can include skin penetration enhancers, drug solubilizers, plasticizers, anti-oxidants, colorants, and the like.<br>
[0183]	Examples of excipients useful as skin penetration enhancers or<br>
solubilizers in transdermal drug dosage forms include Cg-C24 fatty acids such as isostearic acid, octanoic acid, and oleic acid; Cs-C24 fatty alcohols such as oleyl alcohol and lauryl alcohol; lower alkyl esters of Cg-C24 fatty acids such as ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, butyl stearate, and methyl laurate; monoglycerides of Cg-Ca4 fatty acids such as glyceryl monolaurate; tetraglycol (tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol polyethylene glycol ether); tetraethylene glycol (ethanol,2,2'-(oxybis(ethylenoxy))diglycol); polyethylene glycol; propylene glycol; N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide; terpenes, such as d-limonene, menthol, and terpineol.<br>
[0184]	hi compositions of the active agent" component of the present<br>
invention, the skin penetration enhancers, drug solubilizers, plasticizers, and other additives are dispersed, preferably substantially uniformly,- and more preferably dissolved in the composition. Where the additive is a penetration enhancer, it is present in an amount that enhances drug permeation through the skin compared to a like composition not containing the penetration enhancer(s) when this phenomenon is measured using a standard skin penetration model, such as in U.S. Patent No. 5,585,111 (Peterson), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, hi one embodiment, the total amount of penetration enhancer and solubilizer is less than about 40%<br><br>
by weight based on the total weight of the composition. In another embodiment, the total amount of penetration enhancer and solubilizer is less than about 30% based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
[0185]	Active agent component compositions of the invention can be prepared<br>
by combining the polymer matrix, active agent, and optional additives, such as penetration enhancers, with an organic solvent (e.g., ethyl acetate, isopropanol, methanol, acetone, 2-butanone, ethanol, toluene, alkanes, and mixtures thereof) to provide a coating composition. The mixture is shaken or stirred until a homogeneous coating composition is obtained. The resulting composition is then applied to a release liner using conventional coating methods (e.g., knife coating or extrusion die coating) to provide a predetermined uniform thickness of coating composition. Non-continuous or discontinuous coatings may be prepared using methods such as stripe coating, screen printing, and ink-jet printing.<br>
[0186]	Dosage forms of the present invention typically comprise a release<br>
liner that covers and protects the skin-contacting surface prior to use by a patient. Suitable release liners include conventional release liners comprising a known sheet material such as a polyester web, a polyethylene web, a polystyrene web, or a polyethylene-coated paper coated with a suitable fluoropolymer or silicone based coating. The release liner that has been coated with the composition is then dried to prepare the active agent component and laminated to the other components of the dosage form using conventional methods. An optional tie component, heat, and/or pressure may be used to connect the active agent component with the barrier component. In addition, the active agent component compositions may be directly coated onto the barrier component and subsequently dried and laminated to a release liner.<br>
[0187]	When the adverse agent or reservoir component comprises a pressure-<br>
sensitive adhesive or similar polymeric material or matrix, then the adverse agent or reservoir component compositions of the invention can be prepared using methods similar to those for preparing the active agent component, with the exception that an adverse agent is used in place of the active agent to<br><br>
prepare the coating composition. Alternatively, the adverse agent or reservoir component can comprise a porous medium, such as a porous or microporous film. The adverse agent can be dissolved in an impregnating solvent and the porous or microporous film is soaked in the solvent for a sufficient period of time to allow the adverse agent to penetrate the pores of the film. The solvent is then removed leaving the adverse agent dispersed throughout the film.<br>
[0188]	Depending on the particular construction of the dosage form, the dried<br>
active agent component, adverse agent reservoir, porous medium, overlay backing, and optional barrier are laminated together using conventional methods. Optional tie components or heat may be used to connect one or more of the components. Alternatively, the active agent component compositions and adverse agent reservoir compositions may be directly coated onto one of the other components of the dosage form, dried, and subsequently laminated to another component or release liner.<br>
[0189]	An overlay backing is laminated to the surface of either the porous<br>
medium or the adverse agent reservoir to provide an upper surface of the dosage form, optionally using heat, pressure, and/or an additional tie component to ensure adequate contact.<br>
[0190]	One skilled in the art will appreciate that it may be preferred to vary<br>
the order of lamination steps depending on the types and thickness of the components comprising the dosage form.<br>
[0191]	In one embodiment, the dosage form will have a surface area greater<br>
than 5 cm2. In another embodiment, the dosage form will have a surface area of greater than 10 cm2. In another embodiment, the dosage form will have a surface area of less than 100 cm2. In another embodiment, the dosage form will have a surface area of less than 40 cm2.<br>
[0192]	Dosage forms of the present invention are typically packaged<br>
individually in a foil-lined pouch for storage. Dosage forms of the present invention may alternatively be provided in a rolled or stacked form suitable for use with a dispensing apparatus.<br><br>

Test Methods and Dosage Form Components In Vitro Skin Permeation Test Method<br>
10219]	The skin permeation data given in the examples below was obtained<br>
using the following test method. A 5.0 cm2 transdermal patch was die-cut from the center of a 10.0 cm2 overlay patch (5.0 cm2 active area) for use as the test sample. The release liner was removed, and the patch was applied to human cadaver skin and pressed to cause uniform contact with the skin. The resulting patch/skin laminate was placed patch side up across the orifice of the lower portion of a vertical diffusion cell. The diffusion cell was assembled and the lower portion filled with 25 mL of warm (32°C) receptor fluid (0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8) so that the receptor fluid contacted the skin. The sampling port was covered except when in use.<br>
[0220]	The cells were maintained at 32 ± 2°C throughout the course of the<br>
experiment. The receptor fluid was stirred by means of a magnetic stirrer throughout the experiment to assure a uniform sample and a reduced diffusion barrier on the dermal side of the skin. The entire volume of receptor fluid was withdrawn at specified time intervals and immediately replaced with fresh fluid. The withdrawn fluid was filtered through a 0.45 nm filter. The last 1-2 mL were then analyzed for the active agent, e.g., fentanyl, using conventional high performance liquid chromatography methods (Column: Zorbax SB AQ,<br><br>
50 x 4.6 mm, 5 ^im particle size; Mobile phase: 3-20% isopropanol in 22 mM phosphate buffer; Flow Rate: 1.5 mL/min; Detector: UV at 230 ran; Injection Volume: 10 uL; Run time: 6 minutes). The cumulative amount of fentanyl penetrating through the skin was calculated and reported as ng/cm2. Unless noted, the results are reported as the average of 8 replicates.<br>
Solvent Extraction Method<br>
[0221]	The test samples were 3.5 cm2 transdermal patches. The extraction<br>
solution was chosen from one of the following solutions: buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M phosphate buffer for pH 6.5, 0.5 M sodium chloride); diethyl ether (reagent grade with BHT preservative); deionized (DI) water; ethanol (USP, absolute); ethyl acetate (HPLC grade).<br>
[0222]	A 15 mL extraction solution was added into a 40 mL vial. The skin-<br>
adhesive side of the patch was applied to the rim of the vial, such that the patch completely covered the opening of the vial. A screw-on, teflon septum cap was placed over the patch to seal the vial. The sealed vial was stored in an upright position for not more than one hour prior to shaking.<br>
[0223]	The vial was shaken on a shaker table (IKA Labortechnik 501 Digital<br>
Shaker) set to 250 rpm. At fixed time intervals of 5, 15, and 30 minutes 0.5 mL aliquots were removed through the septum using a syringe. Each aliquot was placed into a 1 mL vial. If the extraction solvent was ethyl acetate or ether, then it was evaporated to dryness. Methanol (0.5 mL, HPLC grade) was added to the sample, mixed, and assayed for active and adverse agents by reverse-phase HPLC. If the extraction solvent was water or ethanol, then the sample was assayed directly for active and adverse agents by reverse-phase HPLC.<br>
Mechanical Separation Method<br>
[0224]	The test samples were 10.0cm2 overlay transdermal patches (active<br>
area 5.0 cm2). Ten individuals tested a single patch of each type. The testers were given diagrams indicating the individual components of the patch. The<br><br>
testers were also provided with a scalpel, tweezers, and adhesive tape to use as tools. Each tester was given a one-hour time period and instructed to mechanically separate the patch in an attempt to separate the active agent, e.g., fentanyl, from the adverse agent, e.g., naltrexone. Separated material believed to contain fentanyl and to be free of naltrexone was placed into a 40 mL vial, extracted with approximately 5 mL of methanol, and tested by HPLC for both fentanyl and naltrexone content. The results are reported as the average amount of fentanyl recovered from each patch, the average amount of naltrexone recovered from each patch, and the ratio of fentanyl to naltrexone recovered.<br>
Copolymer A. Preparation of Isooctyl Acrylate/2-Hydroxyethyl acrylate/Elvacite™ 1010 Copolymer Solution<br>
[0225]	A  master  batch  was  prepared by  combining  isooctyl  acrylate<br>
(714.00 g), 2-hydroxyethyl acryiate (523.00g), polymethyknethacrylate macromonomer (52.00g) of ELVACITE™ 1010 available from ICI Acrylics), 2,2'-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile) (2.60 g), ethyl acetate (1245.50g) and isopropanol (45.50 g). The resulting solution was divided in equal portions and placed into six 1 quart (0.95 L) amber glass bottles. The bottles were purged for 2 minutes with nitrogen at a flow rate of 1 L per minute. The bottles were, sealed and placed in a rotating water bath at 57°C for 24 hours. At 24 hours the bottles were removed from the rotating water bath, unsealed, diluted with 76 g methanol per bottle, mixed until homogenous, and recombined into a 1 gallon (3.8 L) glass jar. The percent solids of the resultant copolymer was 40.5%. The inherent viscosity (of a 0.15 g/dL solution of polymer in ethyl acetate measured at 27°C) was 0.77 dL/g.<br>

quaternary/Methoxy polyethylene glycol	400  acrylate Copolymer<br>
Solution<br>
[0226]	A master batch was prepared by combining 2-ethylhexyl acrylate<br>
(234 g), dimethylaminoethyl acrylate methyl chloride quaternary (90 g),<br><br>
methoxy polyethylene glycol 400 acrylate (54 g), methanol (200.84 g) and acetone (221.14 g). The resulting solution was divided in equal portions and placed into two 1 quart (0.95 L) amber glass bottles. The bottles were purged for 2 minutes with nitrogen at a flow rate of 1 L per minute. The bottles were sealed and placed in a rotating water bath at 57°C for 24 hours. At 24 hours the bottles were removed from the rotating water bath and cooled. Methanol (50 g) and acetone (50 g) were added to each bottle and mixed until homogeneous. The resulting solutions were then treated with radical initiators for an additional 6 hours at 57°C to reduce the amount of remaining residual monomers. The resulting copolymer solutions in the two bottles were recombined into a 1 gallon (3.8 L) glass jar. The percent solids of the resultant copolymer was 36.3 %. The Brookfield viscosity was 835 centipoise.<br>

Co., Houston, TX), Polyoxyalkyleneamine (66.25 g, Jeffamine® XTJ 502, Huntsman Co., Houston, TX), 2-methyl-l,5-pentanediamine (0.44 g), and 2-propanol (301.14 g) were added to a 1 quart (0.95 L) jar and mixed until homogeneous. Dicyclohexylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate (35.70 g) was then added to the jar with a 2-propanol wash and mixed for 16 hours to prepare a polymer solution.<br>
[0228]	The resulting solution was knife coated at a wet thickness of 22 mil<br>
(559 um) onto an in-process silicone coated release liner and dried for 4 minutes at 110°F (43°C), for 4 minutes at 185°F (85°C), and for 4 minutes at 200°F (93.3°C). The dried copolymer (161.8 g) was then added to acetone (242.7 g) to prepare a 40.1% solids solution.<br>
Preparation of Porous Polyethylene Film<br>
[0229]	A porous polyethylene film was produced according to the method<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,539,256 (Shipman), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes. Briefly,<br><br>
molten high density polyethylene (Finathene® 7208, Atofina Petrochemicals, Houston, Texas) was mixed with a USP-grade mineral oil (Chevron Superla® White Oil 31, Chevron Products Co., San Ramon, CA) and extruded onto a water-cooled wheel whereupon an oil-filled membrane was formed. The oil was then removed via washing with a solvent, followed by biaxial stretching to form a 5 mil (127 um) thick porous fihn. The porous film was 74% porous and had a 250 nm bubble point pore size. The surface of the fihn that contacts the water-cooled wheel is referred to as the "wheel" side. The porous fihn was rendered hydrophilic via three sequential plasma etching treatments in a silane and oxygen plasma.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0230]	A transdermal dosage form according to FIG. 7a, b was prepared as<br>
follows.<br>
[0231]	Fentanyl (19.5 g) was added to methanol (23.5 g) and mixed until all<br>
of the fentanyl was dissolved. To this solution, copolymer (251.6 g of the solution of isoocryl acrylate/2-hydroxyethyl acrylate/Elvacite™ 1010 from Copolymer A above) was added and mixed until a uniform coating formulation was obtained. The coating formulation was knife coated onto a silicone release liner. The coated liner was oven dried for 4 minutes at 110°F (43°C), for 4 minutes at 185°F (85°C), and for 4 minutes at 200°F (93.3°C). The resulting dried coating weight was 12.6 mg/cm2 (the unit mg/cm2 is often used in the art when dealing with components and coatings which may be less than 4 mm in thickness. The resulting coating contained 16.0 percent fentanyl. The coated liner was laminated onto an in-process silicone release liner for temporary storage of the dried fentanyl-copolymer coating.<br>
[0232]	A naltrexone solution with a concentration of 0.2658 g/mL was<br>
prepared in tetrahydrofuran. The naltrexone solution was coated onto the wheel side of the porous polyethylene fihn described above and dried for 20 minutes at 125°F (51.7°C). The resulting film had a naltrexone concentration of 3.11 mg/cm2.<br><br>
 [0233]	A fluoropolymer coating of 30% (w/w) tetrafluoroethylene-<br>
hexafluoropropylene-vinylidene fluoride terpolymer (THV 220, Dyneon, Oakdale, MN) in acetone was then applied to the wheel side of the naltrexone impregnated film using a #5 Mayer rod. The resulting film had a nominal dried thickness of approximately 0.15 mil (4 urn).<br>
[0234]	The in-process silicone release liner from the fentanyl coating was<br>
removed and the dried coating was laminated to the fluoropolymer coating on the porous polyethylene film to form a multilaminate construction.<br>

Examples 10-17<br>
In Vitro Skin Permeation Test Method<br>
[0286]	The skin permeation data given hi the examples below was obtained<br>
using the following test method. The test samples were transdermal dosage forms having a total area of 5.0 cm2 and an active drag-containing area of 2.0 cm2 was used as the test sample. The release liner was removed, and the patch was applied to human cadaver skin and pressed to cause uniform contact with the skin. The resulting patch/skin laminate was placed patch side up across the orifice of the lower portidn of a vertical diffusion cell. The diffusion cell was assembled and the lower portion filled with 25 mL -of warm (32°C) receptor fluid (0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8) so that the receptor fluid contacted the skin. The sampling port was covered except when in use.<br>
[0287]	The cells-were maintained at 32 ± 2°C. throughout the course of the<br>
experiment. The receptor fluid was stirred by means of a magnetic stirrer throughout the experiment to assure a uniform sample and a reduced diffusion barrier on the dermal side of the skin. The entire volume of receptor fluid was withdrawn at specified time intervals and immediately replaced with fresh fluid. The withdrawn fluid was filtered through a 0.45 urn filter. The last 1-2 mL were then analyzed for the active agent, e.g,, fentanyl, using conventional high performance liquid chromatography methods (Column: Zorbax SB AQ, 50 x 4.6 mm, 5 pm particle size; Mobile phase: 3-20 wt-% isopropanol in 22 mM phosphate buffer; Flow Rate: 1.5 mL/min; Detector: UV at 230 nm; Injection Volume: 10 \iL; Run time: 6 minutes). The cumulative amount of fentanyl penetrating through the skin was calculated and reported as Unless noted, the results are reported as the average of 8 replicates.<br><br>
olvent Extraction Method<br>
[0288]	The test samples were 3.3 cm2 transdermal patches. The extraction<br>
solution was chosen from one of the following solutions: buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M phosphate buffer for pH 6.5, 0.5 M sodium chloride); diethyl ether (reagent grade with BHT preservative); deionized (DI) water; ethanol (USP, absolute); ethyl acetate (HPLC grade).<br>
[0289]	The patch and a 15 mL extraction solution were added into a 40 mL<br>
vial. The sealed vial was vigorously shaken with a wrist-action shaker (Burrel, Model 75, speed setting: 10). At fixed time intervals of 5, 15, and 30 minutes aliquots were removed. Each aliquot was placed into an analysis vial. If the extraction solvent was ethyl acetate or ether, then it was evaporated to dryness and methanol (HPLC grade) was added to the sample and mixed. Samples were assayed for active and adverse agents by reverse-phase HPLC. If the extraction solvent was water or ethanol, then the sample was assayed directly for active and adverse agents by reverse phase HPLC.<br>
Mechanical Separation Method<br>
[0290]	The test samples were 20.0 cm2 overlay transdermal patches (active<br>
area 10.5 cm2). Four individuals tested a single patch of each type. The testers were given diagrams indicating the individual components of the patch. The testers were also provided with a scalpel, tweezers, and adhesive tape to use as tools. Each tester was given a one-hour time period and instructed to mechanically separate the patch in an attempt to separate the active agent, e.g., fentanyl, from the naltrexone. Separated material believed to contain fentanyl and to be free of naltrexone was placed into 40 mL vials, extracted with approximately 5 mL of methanol, and tested by HPLC for both fentanyl and naltrexone content. The results are reported as the average amount of fentanyl recovered from each patch, the average amount of naltrexone recovered from each patch, and the ratio of fentanyl to naltrexone recovered.<br><br>

apertured film (Style 6007, Polymer Group, Inc., North Charleston, SC) was ultrasonically welded to a 3.0 mil (76 um) thick polyethylene film (CoTran™9720, 3M, St. Paul, MN) using a 20 kHz Dukane ultrasonic welder with a 3 inch (76.2 mm) diameter round horn and a 1:1 booster to create a porous film assembly. The anvil had 0.25 inch (6.4 mm) spacing, 0.044 inch (1118 um) diameter pins, and a 0.01 inch (254 um) pin height. Settings of 40 psi (0.28 Mpa), 1.5 second weld time and a 1.0 second hold tune were used. The non-apertured side of the porous film assembly was laminated to a Tegaderm™ dressing and converted into 3.3 cm2 parts. The release liner was then removed from the dried naltrexone coating of a 2.0 cm2 part and laminated to the apertured film side of a 3.3 cm2 part. Solvent extraction was determined using the test method described above. The results are shown in Table 7.<br>

The resulting dried coating weight was approximately 12.6 mg/cm2. The resulting coating contained 17.2 percent fentanyl. The coated liner was laminated onto the polyethylene terephthalate side of a 2.0 mil (51 um) thick laminate film of polyethylene terephthalate and ethylene vinyl acetate (Scotchpak™ 9732,3M, St. Paul, MN).<br>
[0310]	A adverse agent or reservoir component was prepared as follows.<br>

Example 18<br>
[0313]	Fentanyl is a highly potent opiate analgesic that is being developed for<br>
a 7-day transdermal fentanyl product for the management of pain. To minimize its abuse potential, the incorporation of the opioid antagonist, naltrexone is under consideration. This pharmacokinetic study was conducted in support of a neuropharmacology study to determine the ratio of naltrexone required to blunt the pharmacological effects of fentanyl when fentanyl and naltrexone are co-administered at a fixed ratio by the intraperitoneal injection in male Sprague Dawley rats.<br>
[0314]	Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups (5 per group).<br>
Each rat received a single intraperitoneal injection of fentanyl (125 |ig/kg) co-administered with naltrexone as described in Table 11 A.<br>

 [0315]	Blood was collected from at predose, 10,20,30,45, and 60 min, and at<br>
1.5,2,4, and 6 h post fentanyl dose- The plasma obtained was stored at -20°C until analyzed by LC-MS/MS for fentanyl. norfentanyl, naltrexone and 6-p-naltrexol concentrations. The standard curves for fentanyl and its metabolite, norfentanyl, ranged from 50 to 1000 pg/mL, whereas the standard curves for naltrexone and 6-p-naltrexol ranged from 10.1 to 505 pg/mL.<br>
[0316]	The mean pharmacokinetic metrics for fentanyl, norfentanyl and<br>
naltrexone are listed hi Table 12. There was considerable variation in fentanyl and naltrexone plasma concentrations in all three groups. However, the ratio of fentanyl to naltrexone in the plasma was more consistent within the three groups across the sampling time points tested. Furthermore, the ratio of fentanyl to naltrexone plasma concentration increased with time owing to the<br><br>
longer plasma half-life of fentanyl. The target (dosed) ratios were reached at approximately 30 min to 1 h post dose The cage-side observations for the co-administered fentanyl and naltrexone demonstrated a lack of sedative effect of fentanyl at all 3 ratios of agonist to antagonist and at all time points studied. Although the relative concentration of fentanyl to naltrexone within the plasma of the rat increased with time, the absolute concentration of fentanyl in the plasma decreased so no clinical effects were observed.<br>

[0318]	Blood was collected into polypropylene tubes containing KzEDTA<br>
labeled with the following information: study number, dose group, animal number, and time of collection. Approximately 1 mL of blood was collected via the jugular vein cannula from each rat at predose, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60<br>
min, and at 1.5, 2, 4, and 6 h post dose. The withdrawn blood volume was replaced with heparinized blood from naive rats. The blood samples were kept on ice until centrifuged at 4°C (within 1 h of collection). The resulting plasma was separated and stored in appropriately labeled polypropylene containers at approximately -70°C until analysis.<br>
[0319]	The plasma samples (0.200 mL) were analyzed for fentanyl,<br>
norfentanyl, naltrexone, and 6-p-naltrexol concentrations by the Bioanalytical Group of the Phamiacokinetics and Drug Metabolism (PKDM) department at Purdue Pharma L.P. After the addition of internal standards, the samples were subjected to solid phase extraction. The extract was dried and resuspended in 100 uL acetonitrile and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The standard curves were linear over the range of 50 0 to 1000 pg/mL for fentanyl and norfentanyl. The naltrexone and 6-p-naltrexol standard curves were linear over the range of 10.1 to 505 pg/mL, with the limits of quantitation being defined as the ends of the standard curve. Samples that exceeded the standard curve were diluted with interference-free plasma and re-analyzed.<br>
[0320]	The non-compartmental pharmacokinetic metrics from the mean<br>
plasma concentration data were determined using WinNonlin, version 1.5 (Scientific Consulting, Inc.). The AUC value was estimated by the linear trapezoidal rule. Zero was used for any concentration that was less than the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the assay. The apparent i\n was calculated as i\n = 0.693/X where X is the elimination rate constant estimated from the regression of the terminal slope of the concentration versus time curve. At least 3 plasma concentrations after the peak concentration on the terminal phase were used to determine and the coefficient of determination (R2) was required to be greater than or equal to 0.85.<br>

The mean pharmacolkinetic metrics for the three groups are listed in Table 11, whereas individual rat PK metrics are listed in Tables 14, 15, and 16 for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All three groups received the same dose of fentanyl. There was no difference in the mean pharmacokinetic profile or the mean pharmacolkinetic metrics for the three groups. However, the individual plasma concentration versus time profiles were highly variable. The t^ value for all rats was 10 min, which was the first time point post injection. The i\n values were similar for all three groups and ranged from 0.843 to 2.35 h (the terminal i\&amp; values were not calculable from one rat in each of Groups 1 and 3). The Cmax values ranged from 980 to 32309 pg/mL for Group 1, 10778 to 41969pg/mL for Group2, and 5950 to 2 78215pg/mL for Groups. The AUCirf values ranged from 7301 to-28382 pg«h/mL for Group 1, 16824 to 23552 pg'h/mL for Group 2, and 5387 to 27690 pg'h/mL for Group 3.<br>

The mean pharmacokinetic metrics for naltrexone are recorded in Table 12, whereas individual rat pharmacokinetic metrics are listed in Tables 14, 15, and 16 for the respective groups. The individual plasma concentration versus time profiles were highly variable for Group 1 (highest dose of naltrexone). The tmax value for all rats was 10 min, which was the first tune point post injection. The i\n values were similar for all three groups and ranged from 0.388 to 0.714 h (the terminal i\n values were not calculable from one rat in each of Groups 1 and 3). The Cmax values ranged from 762 to 30864 pg/mL for Group 1, 5169 to 7832pg/mL for Group 2 and 963 to 3196pg/mL for Group 3. The AUCW values ranged from 445 to<br>
18947 pg«h/mL, 2731 to 4149 pg«h/mL, and 426 to 2092 pg»h/mL for Groups 1,2, and 3, respectively.<br>
[0324]	The mean plasma concentrations versus time profiles for norfentanyl<br>
are plotted in Figure 24. The mean pharmacokinetic metrics for norfentanyl are recorded in Table 16, whereas individual rat pharmacokinetic metrics are listed in Tables 17, 18, and 19 for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The plasma concentration profiles and the pharmacokinetic metrics were similar for all three groups since all rats received 125 pg/kg of fentanyl. The individual plasma concentration versus time profiles for norfentanyl were less variable than the fentanyl or naltrexone profiles. Norfentanyl concentration was proportionately higher in most of the rats with lower than average plasma concentrations of fentanyl. The tmax values ranged from 10 min to 2.0 hours post injection. The ti/2 values were similar to fentanyl and similar for all three groups with values ranging from 1.41 to 3.48 h (the terminal t\n values were not calculable from one rat in Group 1). The Cma* values ranged from 1595 to 3572pg/mL for Group 1, 1238 to 2273pg/mL for Group 2 and 911 to 3019pg/mL for Group 3. The AUCinf values ranged from 4897 to 61 34pg»h/mL for Group 1, 4781 to 7689pg»h/mL for Group 2, and 4303 to 6203 pg'h/mL for Group 3.<br>
[0325]	While it was possible to quantitate 6-p-naltrexol concentrations in the<br>
plasma of the Group 1 rats, there were only a few time points/rat where<br>
-•<br>
concentrations were substantially above the LLOQ (lOpg/mL). No further analysis was conducted.<br>
[0326]	The ratios of mean plasma concentrations of fentanyl to naltrexone for<br>
the 3 groups are plotted in Figure 28. While there was large intra-rat variability in the plasma concentrations of fentanyl and naltrexone, the variability in the plasma concentration ratio was small. The targeted plasma concentration ratios were not obtained until 0.5 to 1 h after injection. Throughout the early time points, the plasma concentration of fentanyl was proportionally lower than that of naltrexone. At later time points, the concentration ratio of fentanyl to naltrexone in the plasma of the rats increased due to the more rapid elimination of naltrexone which has a shorter plasma<br>
half-life. Although this produces a higher ratio of fentanyl to naltrexone in the plasma at later time points, the absolute concentration of fentanyl has also decreased, hence the lack of any clinical signs due to fentanyl administration in the rats.<br>
[0327]	There was no sign of sedation in any of the rats. All activity appeared<br>
to be normal throughout the 6-h of the study.<br>
[0328]	There was considerable variation in fentanyl and naltrexone plasma<br>
concentrations in all three groups. However, the ratio of fentanyl to naltrexone in the plasma was more consistent within the three groups across the sampling time points tested. Furthermore, the ratio of fentanyl to naltrexone plasma concentration increased with time owing to the longer plasma half-life of fentanyl. The target (dosed) ratios were reached at approximately 30 min to 1 h post dose. The cage-side observations for the co-administered fentanyl and naltrexone demonstrated a lack of sedative effect of fentanyl at all 3 ratios of agonist to. antagonist and at all time points studied. Although the relative concentration of fentanyl to naltrexone within the plasma of the rat increased with time, the absolute concentration of fentanyl hi the plasma decreased so no clinical effects were observed.<br>

Example 19<br>
[0329J	This study was designed to obtain transbuccal flux data and the<br>
pharmacokinetic profile of the three different 7-day 3M transidermal fentanyl formulations and the Duragesic® formulation. The appearance in plasma and<br>
the plasma pharmacokinetic profile of naltrexone was also monitored in this study.<br>
[0330]	A group of 9 male Beagle dogs were used in a modified crossover<br>
design. In the first phase of the study, the dogs received a single buccal application of fentanyl for 30 minutes as Duragesic® gel (3 dogs) or as a Duragesic® chiclet (6 dogs). Following a 3-week washout period, the dogs received a single 30-minute buccal application of fentanyl from one of three prototype transdermal systems (3 dogs/formulation, 2Di, ICi or the U2b. After a second 3-week washout period, all 9 dogs were administered a single intravenous (TV) co-injection of fentanyl and naltrexone (as 45 ug/kg of each opiate).<br>
[0331]	Blood was collected from each dog in each phase of the study at<br>
predose, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, and at 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours post fentanyl dose. The separated plasma was stored at -20°C until analyzed by LC-MS-MS for fentanyl, norfentanyl, naltrexone, and 6-p-naltrexol concentrations. The standard curves for fentanyl and its metabolite ranged from 50 to 1000 pg/mL, whereas the standard curves for naltrexone and 6-p-naltrexol ranged from 10 1 to 505 pg/mL.<br>
[0332]	Following the administration of Duragesic® gel to the buccal mucosa<br>
of 3 dogs, a similar fentanyl plasma Cmax. (mean of 1371 pg/mL), AUQast (mean of 3473pg«h/mL) and fentanyl plasma concentration versus time profile was obtained. When a Duragesic® chiclet of 2 cm2 was applied to the buccal mucosa, substantial inter-dog (n = 6) variability was found in the concentration versus time profile. This was predominantly due to the variability in the making of the chiclets (i.e., the amount of gel within the 2 cm2 chiclet) than in the dogs' individual absorption and pharmacokinetics. The fentanyl plasma Cn,ax values ranged from 1355 to 5031 pg/mL (mean of 3095 pg/mL), and the AUQast (mean of 7923 pg»h/mL) showed a similar inter-dog variability over the 6 dogs studied.<br>
[0333]	The 3M formulation, U2b, produced the most variability of any<br>
formulation tested in the fentanyl plasma concentration versus time profile.<br>
The C^ values ranged from 2204 to 12900 pg/mL (mean of 6532 pg/mL) and the AUQnf ranged from 4337 to 15719 pg«h/mL.<br>
[0334]	Following application of the 2Di transidermal formulation to the<br>
buccal mucosa of the dogs, the fentanyl and naltrexone plasma concentration profiles as well as the associated pharmacokinetic (PK) metrics were consistent among the 3 dogs. The Cmax fentanyl ranged from 2908 to 4208 pg/mL, and the W ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 hours. The AUQnf values ranged from 5948 to 8890pg»h/mL, and the t\n values ranged from 1.6-2.1 hours. The Cmax for naltrexone ranged from 963 to 1651 pg/mL, the t^x ranged from 0.5 to 0.8 hours, and the AUCW values ranged from 1764 to 3139pg«h/mL. The ti/2 values ranged from 0.8 to 1-2 hours, approximately 50% of the fentanyl i\n. values.<br>
[0335]	A fentanyl to naltrexone ratio as low as 2:1 was maintained from 20<br>
minutes until approximately 90 minutes post buccal application of the 2Di transdeimal formulation.<br>
[0336]	Following the application of the ICi transdermal formulation to the<br>
buccal mucosa of the dogs, the fentanyl and naltrexone plasma concentration profiles as well as the associated PK metrics were also consistent among the three dogs. The fentanyl plasma Cmax ranged from 7369 to 9821 pg/mL which was higher than with the 2Di formulation. The fentanyl plasma AUCfof values ranged from 9926 to 13168pg«h/mL (also substantially higher than that obtained with the 2Di formulation). The associated tmax values ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 hours, and the ti/2 values ranged from 2.0-2.2 hours. The naltrexone metrics were similar to the naltrexone metrics with the 2Di formulation. The naltrexone plasma Cmax values with the ICi transdermal formulation ranged from 1011 to 1637pg/mL, the tmax ranged from 0.3 to 0.8 hours, and the naltrexone AUQnf values ranged from 1121 to 1709 pg«h/mL. The l\n values or naltrexone were approximately half the value for fentanyl, from 0.90-1.0 h.<br>
[0337]	For this formulation, it was not possible to achieve a 2:1 fentanyl to<br>
naltrexone ratio in any of the 3 dogs. While the naltrexone concentration in the plasma is similar to the 2Di formulation, the plasma concentration of<br>
fentanyl was higher, most likely due to the presence of the permeation enhancer within the adhesive layer.<br>
[0338]	The cage side observations for the co-administered fentanyl plus<br>
naltrexone validated the ability of a 1:1 ratio of naltrexone to fentanyl to block the sedative effect of fentanyl. While both the ICi and 2Di formulations delivered naltrexone to the systemic circulation, the 2Di formulation was more effective at delivering naltrexone (faster and higher systemic concentrations) and had a slower delivery of fentanyl. This combination resulted in plasma naltrexone: fentanyl ratios as low as 1:2 from 20 to 90 minutes post application. This was also confirmed by a higher trans-buccal flux rate for naltrexone than fentanyl with the 2Di formulation.<br>

was applied to the area between the gum and cheek. The dogs' mouths were held closed, and pressure was applied to hold the cheek against the teeth/gums for 30 minutes. Blood samples were collected at the times indicated below.<br>
[0343]	Group 3,4 and 5. After a washout period of 3 weeks, the 9 dogs (from<br>
groups 1 and 2) were split into three groups. Three dogs were assigned to groups 3, 4, and 5. The dogs in group 3 had a 2 cm2 U2b prototype fentanyl transdermal system placed between the gum and cheek. The dogs in group 4 received a 2 cm2 transdermal patch of the 2Di formulation while those hi group 5 received the ICi formulation applied in the same manner. The dogs' mouths were held closed and pressure was applied to hold the cheek against the teeth/gums for 30 minutes. Blood samples were collected at the times indicated below.<br>
[0344]	Group 6. Following an additional 3-week washout period, each of the<br>
nine dogs received fentanyl and naltrexone, 45 Hg/kg each, as a co-injection into the non-cannulated (contralateral) cephalic vein. Blood samples were collected at the times indicated below.<br>
[0345]	Blood collection: The blood was collected into polypropylene tubes<br>
containing K^EDTA, labeled with at least the following information: study number, dose group, animal number, and time of collection. Approximately 3 mL was collected via the cephalic (or saphenous) cannula from each dog at preclose, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min, and at 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours post fentanyl dose. A 24-hour post-dose sample was obtained from the jugular or cephalic vein. The blood samples were kept on ice until separation of plasma (usually within 1 hour of collection). Blood samples were centrifuged at 4°C, and the resulting plasma separated and stored in appropriately labeled polypropylene containers at approximately -70°C until analysis.<br>
[0346]	The plasma samples (0.200 mL) were analyzed for fentanyl,<br>
norfentanyl, naltrexone, and 6-p-naltrexol concentrations. After the addition of internal standards, the samples were subjected to solid phase extraction. The extract was dried and resuspended in 100 uL acetonitrile and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The standard curves were linear over the range of 50.0 to<br>
l,OOOpg/mL for fentanyl and norfentanyl. The naltrexone and 6-p-naltrexol standard curves were linear over the range of 10.1 to 505 pg/mL. Samples that exceeded the standard curve were diluted with interference-free plasma and reanalyzed.<br>
[0347]	The  non-compartmental pharmacokinetic metrics from the mean<br>
plasma concentration data were determined using WinNonlin, version 1.5. The AUC value was estimated by the linear trapezoidal rule. Zero was used for any concentration that was less than the LLOQ of the assay. The apparent tm was calculated as ti/2 = 0.693A, where X is the elimination rate constant estimated from the regression of the terminal slope of the concentration versus time curve. At least 3 plasma concentrations after the peak concentration on the terminal phase were used to determine X, and the coefficient of determination (R2) was required to be greater than or equal to 0.85.<br>
[0348]	The plasma clearance of fentanyl and naltrexone was calculated by<br>
WinNonlin from the I.V. data for each dog. These values were used to calculate the transbuccal flux of fentanyl and naltrexone for each dog with the various formulations administered.<br>

[0349]	The calculated results are an approximation since the equation assumes<br>
steady-state delivery which in the dog model normally takes one hour (Cassidy, J.P., et al, "Controlled buccal delivery of buprenorphine," J. Controlled Release 25:21-29 (1993)).<br>
[0350]	The mean PK metrics for fentanyl, naltrexone, and norfentanyl are<br>
listed hi Tables 21,22, and 23, respectively.<br>
[0351]	The individual fentanyl plasma concentration versus time profiles for<br>
the buccal application of 30 uL of Duragesic® gel to dogs (animal numbers CSDATI, CSCAGR, and CSUAFI) are plotted in Figure 29 and the individual PK metrics are listed in Table 24. The plasma concentration profiles and the PK metrics were similar for all three dogs. The Cmax values ranged from 1206 to 1539 pg/mL while the W values were approximately 1 hour (0.75 -100 h)<br>
The AUQnf values ranged from 3555 to 3763 pg'h/mL while ti/a ranged from 1.6 to 18 hours.<br>
[0352]	The individual fentanyl plasma concentration versus time profiles for<br>
the 30-minute buccal application of a 2 cm2 chiclet of Duragesic® are plotted in Figure 30. Individual PK metrics are listed in Table 22. The plasma concentration profiles and the PK metrics demonstrated a wide variability among the 6 dogs (animal numbers CSCACV, CSDAGC, CSDAGD,' CSDAGW, CSDAJN, and CSDAYT). The Cmax ranged from 1355 to 5031 pg/mL, the tmax ranged from 0.5 to 1 hour, and the AUQnf values ranged from 3175 to 16683 pg«h/mL. The ti/2 ranged from 1.5 to 2.1 hour in the 5 dogs where the 24-hour plasma concentration of fentanyl was BLQ. For dog CSDAGC, a gamma phase of elimination was detected with a i\n of 5-0 hours.<br>
[0353]	The individual fental plasma concentration versus time profiles for the<br>
30-minute buccal application of a 2 cm2 of formulation U2b (no naltrexone in the formulation) to dogs CSDAGW, CSDAJN, and CSDAGC are plotted in Figure 31. The individual PK metrics are listed in Table 26. Dog CSDAGW had an extremely high Cmax when compared to the other two dogs (Cmax ranged from 2204 to 12900 pg/mL). While the tmax was 0.50 hours for all three dogs, the AUQnf values ranged from 4337 to 15719 pg«h/mL with dog CSDAGC providing the low value and the other two dogs at the upper end. The ti/2 ranged from 2.1 to 4.1 hours.<br>
[0354]	The individual fentanyl and naltrexone plasma concentration versus<br>
time profiles for the 30-minute buccal application of a 2 cm2 formulation - 2Di to dogs CSDAFI, CSCAGR, and CSGACN are plotted in Figure 33. Individual PK metrics are listed hi Table 27. The fentanyl plasma concentration profiles as well as the associated PK metrics were consistent among the 3 dogs. A similar inter-dog consistency was observed for naltrexone. The fentanyl plasma Cmax values ranged from 2908 to 4208 pg/mL and the t^x values ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 hours. The fentanyl plasma AUQnf values ranged from 5948 to 8890 pg-h/mL, and the i\n values ranged from 1.6 - 2.1 hours. The naltrexone plasma Cmax values ranged from 963 to 1651 pg/mL, the tmax ranged from 0.5 to 0.8 hours, and the naltrexone plasma<br>
values ranged from 1764 to 3139 pg»h/mL. The ti/a values ranged from 0.8 -1.2 hours approximately 50% of the fentanyl ti/2 values.<br>
[0355]	The ratios of fentanyl to naltrexone plasma concentrations are plotted<br>
in Figure 32. A ratio as low as 2 fentanyl to one naltrexone was maintained from 20 until 90 minutes post buccal application.<br>
[0356]	The individual fentanyl and naltrexone plasma concentration vs. time<br>
profiles for the 30 minute buccal application of a 2 cm2 formulation ICi to dogs CSDAGD, CSDATI, and CSDAYT are plotted in Figure 8G, and the individual PK metrics are listed in Table 28. Similar to the 2Di formulation, the fentanyl plasma concentration profiles and the PK metrics were consistent among the 3 dogs. A similar inter-dog consistency was observed for naltrexone. The fentanyl plasma Cmax ranged from 7369 to 9821 pg/mL, the tmax ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 h, and the fentanyl plasma AUQnf values ranged from 9926 to 13168 pg*hr/mL. The ti/a values ranged from 2.0 - 2.2 h. The naltrexone plasma Cmax ranged from 101 1 to 1637 pg/mL, the t^m ranged from 0.3 to 0.8 h, and the naltrexone plasma AUQnf values ranged from 1121 to 1724 pg*h/mL. The ti/2 values for naltrexone were approximately half the value for fentanyl, ranging from 0.90 to 1.0 h.<br>
[0357]	The ratio of fentanyl to naltrexone plasma concentrations are plotted in<br>
Figure 34. It was not possible to achieve a 2 fentanyl to 1 naltrexone ratio in any of the 3 dogs with the ICi formulation. While the naltrexone concentration in the plasma was similar to the 2Di formulation, the plasma concentration of fentanyl was higher, most likely due to the presence of the permeation enhancer within the adhesive layer.<br>
[0358]	The mean fentanyl and naltrexone plasma concentration versus time<br>
profiles following the co-administration of 45 ug/kg of the fentanyl and naltrexone are plotted in Figure 36. The individual profiles are plotted in Figures 37, 38, and 39. The individual PK metrics for both fentanyl and naltrexone are listed in Table 29. The plasma concentration profiles of fentanyl were similar to the plasma profiles of naltrexone for each of the dogs. Within each dog, the PK metrics for fentanyl and naltrexone resulting from the co-administration of equal concentrations of fentanyl and naltrexone were-<br>
similar for the two compounds. The fentanyl Cmax ranged from 6445 to 11655 pg/mL while the naltrexone Cmax ranged from 4658 to 113941 pg/mL. The fentanyl AUCmf values ranged from 8628 to 15516 pg«h/mL whereas the naltrexone AUCmf values were lower and ranged from 5408 to 14027 pg*h/mL. The major difference was in the t\/2 values which were shorter for naltrexone and ranged from 0.915 to 1.31 hours as compared to 1.76 to 6.30 hours for fentanyl.<br>
[0359]	While it was possible to quantitate 6 p-naltrexol concentrations in the<br>
plasma of most of the dogs, there were only a few timepoints/dog where concentrations were above the lower LOQ (10 pg/mL).<br>
[0360]	The IV clearance of fentanyl and naltrexone was used to determine<br>
transbuccal flux from the various formulations. The only consistent flux was obtained from the Duragesic® gel. All other formulations showed variable transbuccal flux. As expected, in most cases the transbuccal flux of fentanyl mirrored the flux of naltrexone.<br>
[0361]	The plasma mean concentration of norfentanyl versus time is plotted in<br>
Figure 40. The mean plasma concentration never exceeded 600 pg/mL. There was a lag of 20 to 30 minutes between the appearance of fentanyl and of quantifiable norfentanyl plasma concentrations for all buccal applications. Similar to and in agreement with the fentanyl plasma concentrations, there is a large standard deviation about the mean plasma concentrations for norfentanyl<br>
j<br>
at most time points. The individual norfentanyl metrics are found in Tables 24 to 29 while the mean metrics based on formulation are found in Table 23.<br>
[0362]	The plasma samples were analyzed for the human metabolite of<br>
naltrexone, 6-p-naltrexol. As was expected, there were very few samples with quantifiable concentrations of this chemical since it is known that naltrexone is not significantly metabolized to this material in the dog.<br>
[0363]	Sedation of varying degrees was observed with all of the buccal<br>
applications. There was a trend between higher fentanyl plasma concentration and a greater likelihood of sedation, but this was not absolute and was not quantitative. Sedation was not observed during the IV phase of the study.<br>
 [0364]	The Duragesic® gel produced a pharmacokinetic profile that was<br>
consistent across the three dogs. The variability inherent in freezing and cutting a 2 cm2 chiclet from the Duragesic® patch produced an inter-dog variable pharmacokinetic profile. The chiclets also produced a mean Qnax value that was approximately three tunes higher than 30 uL of gel while the mean AUQast value was approximately twice as large from the chiclet as from the gel. The actual amount of gel within the chiclet was not determined.<br>
[0365]	The cage side observations for the co-administered fentanyl plus<br>
naltrexone validated the ability of a 1:1 ratio of naltrexone to fentanyl to block the sedative effect of fentanyl. The ICi and 2Di formulations were able to deliver naltrexone to the systemic circulation. The 2Di formulation was more effective at delivering Hie naltrexone (faster and at higher systemic concentrations) and had a slower fentanyl delivery (similar mean as the Duragesic® chiclet). This combination resulted in plasma naltrexone:fentanyl ratios as low as 1:2 from 20 to 90-minutes post application. This was also confirmed with the calculation of transbuccal flux when the calculated flux of naltrexone was greater than fentanyl for the 2Di formulation.<br>
