COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13] "A POLYMER COMPOSITION"<br>
BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC., a corporation of the State of Delaware of One Baxter Parkway 2-2E, Deerfield, Illinois 60015, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to a polymer composition.<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to polymer blends and more particularly to cyclic olefin containing polymers or bridged polycyclic hydrocarbon containing polymers blended with ethylene and a -olefin copolymers that are obtained utilizing a metallocene catalyst system.<br>
Background Art<br>
In the medical field, where beneficial agents are collected, processed and stored in containers, transported and ultimately delivered through drip chambers, tube connectors and tubes by infusion to patients, there has been a recent trend toward developing materials useful for fabricating such containers, tubings and devices without the disadvantages of currently used materials such as polyvinyl chloride. These new materials must have a unique combination of properties to be used in fluid administration sets. Among these are the materials in most instances must be optically clear, environmentally compatible, have sufficient yield strength and flexibility for flexible products and sufficient rigidity for rigid products, have a low quantity of low molecular weight additives, be capable of being solvent bonded to soft polyolefin medical products and be compatible with medical solutions.<br>
It is desirable for medical products in an infusion delivery set to be optically transparent to allow for visual inspection of fluid therein.<br>
It is also desirable that the medical materials be environmentally compatible as a great deal of medical products are disposed of in landfills and through incineration. Further benefits are realized by using a material which is thermoplastically recyclable.<br>
For medical products that are disposed of by incineration, it is necessary to use a material that does not generate or minimizes the formation of by-products such as <br><br>
wo o1/18112	<br>
inorganic acids which may be environmentally harmful, irritating, and corrosive. For example, PVC may generate objectionable amounts of hydrogen chloride (or hydrochloric acid when contacted with water) upon incineration, causing corrosion of the incinerator.<br>
To be compatible with medical solutions, it is desirable that the components of the infusion delivery set be free from or have a minimal content of low molecular weight additives such as plasticizers, stabilizers and the like. In some applications, these components can be extracted into the therapeutic solutions that come into contact with the material. The additives may react with the therapeutic agents or otherwise render the solution ineffective. This is especially troublesome in bio-tech drug formulations where the concentration of the drug is measured in parts per million (ppm), rather than in weight or volume percentages. Even minuscule losses of the bio-tech drug can render the formulation unusable. Because bio-tech formulations can cost several thousand dollars per dose, it is imperative that the dosage not be changed.<br>
Polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") has been widely used to fabricate medical tubings and containers as it meets most of these requirements. However, because PVC by itself is a rigid polymer, low molecular weight components known as plasticizers must be added to render PVC flexible. These plasticizers may leach out of the medical product and into the fluid passing through the products to contaminate the fluid or to render the fluid unusable. For this reason, and because of the difficulties encountered in incinerating PVC, there is a need to replace PVC in at least the fluid contacting portions of the infusion pathway and more preferably in its entirety.<br>
Polyolefins have been developed which meet many of the requirements of medical containers and tubing, without the disadvantages associated with PVC.   Polyolefins typically are compatible with medical applications because they have minimal extractability to the fluids and contents which they contact. Most polyolefins are environmentally sound as they do not generate harmful degradants upon incineration, and in most cases are capable of being thermoplastically recycled. Many polyolefins are cost effective materials that may provide an economic alternative to PVC. However,   there are many hurdles to overcome to replace all the favorable attributes of PVC with a polyolefin.<br><br>
WO 01/18112<br>
For example, because of the inert nature of polyolefins, due in part to the non-polar nature of the polymer, difficulties have been encountered in bonding the polyolefin materials to rigid housings positioned along the infusion pathway of an infusion set. Typically, medical containers such as IV. bags are connected to a patient through a series of connected tubing that have in fluid communication drip chambers, Y-type injection sites, venous catheters and the like between the bag and the patient. Many of these components include rigid housings manufactured from polycarbonates, acrylics, ABS, copolyesters and the like. The housings have sleeves in which the tubing is inserted in a telescoping fashion to attach the tube to the housing. Therefore, it is necessary for the medical tubing to be connected to the rigid housing to form a fluid tight seal with the housings.<br>
PVC tubing is typically secured within such housings using solvent bonding techniques. Solvent bonding requires exposing the. end of the tubing to be inserted into the housing to a solvent such as cyclohexanone or methyl ethyl ketone. The solvent effectively softens or dissolves the PVC so when the tubing is inserted into the housing, a bond is formed. Solvent bonding techniques, however, are ineffective on certain polyolefins including polyethylene and polypropylene. Problems have also been encountered in using adhesive bonding techniques.<br>
European Patent Application No. 0 556 034 discloses a medical instrument of a material containing a resin of a cyclic olefin compound or a bridged polycyclic hydrocarbon compound. The EP '034 Application discloses making devices such as syringes, injection needled drip chambers, blood bags and tubing from these resins. While the EP '034 Patent application discloses a non-PVC material for fabricating medical products it does not disclose a method for bonding a rigid housing of a cyclic olefin to a flexible tubing of a cyclic olefin or other polyolefins.<br>
Cycloolefin blends are also well known for providing rigid, injection molded parts. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,359,001 discloses a multiple component polymer blend having a first component of a cycloolefin, a second component of a polyolefin and<br>
polyolefin. The '001 Patent discloses such blends for impact modifying the highly rigid<br><br>
WO 01/18112<br><br>
PCT/USOO/24710<br><br><br>
and brittle cycloolefins. The '001 Patent does not disclose a method for solvent bonding these blends.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,863,986 discloses polymer alloy blends of a cycloolefin copolymers with one or more core-shell particles and one or more block copolymers. Again, these polymer blends are tough on impact and have high fexural strength and elongation at break. The '986 patent does not disclose a method for solvent bonding the polymer alloy blends.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention provides multiple component polymer blends for fabricating medical devices. The blends of the present invention contain as a component homopolymers or copolymers of cyclic olefins or bridged polycyclic hydrocarbons. For example, the present invention provides a polymer composition comprising: a first component obtained by copolymerizing a norbomene monomer and an ethylene monomer, the first component being in an amount from about 1-99% by weight of the composition; and a second component of an ethylene and α-olefin copolymer, the a-olefin having 6 carbons, the second component being in an amount from about 99% to about 1% by weight of the composition. It has been found by the present inventors that α-olefin having 6 carbons when blended with norbomene result in blends having greater clarity when compared with blends of norbomene with α-olefins having 4 or 8 carbons. In a preferred form of the invention the ethylene and α-olefin copolymer is obtained using a metallocene catalyst.<br>
The present invention also provides three component polymer blends where a second homopolymer or copolymer of a cyclic olefin or a bridged polycyclic hydrocarbon is added to the above-described two-component blend. In a preferred form of the invention, the norbomene has a glass transition temperature of lower than 120°C and the second homopolymer or copolymer of a cyclic olefin or a bridged polycyclic hydrocarbon has a glass transition temperature of higher than 120 °C.<br><br><br><br>

The first component of the cement composition is selected from those set forth in Section I above and include a homopolymer or copolymer of a.cyclic olefin or a bridged polycyclic hydrocarbon in an amount from 1-20% by weight of the composition, more preferably from 1-15% and most preferably from 3-10%, and a second component of a solvent having a solubility parameter of less than about 20 (Mpa)1/4 more preferably less than about 19 (Mpa)1/2 and most preferably less than about l8 (MPa)1/2 and more preferably selected from the group of aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons set forth above in Section TV. Suitable solvents will also have a molecular weight less than about 200 g/mole, more preferably less than about 180 g/mole and most preferably less than about 140 g/mole.<br>
These cement compositions can also be used for bonding flexible articles to rigid articles, flexible articles to semi-rigid articles, semi-rigid articles to one another or for bonding semi-rigid articles to rigid articles or for bonding rigid articles to one another. Accordingly, the cement compositions can be used to prepare medical device assemblies such as joining flexible tubings to one another, joining flexible tubings to tubing unions and flexible tubings to drip chambers, flexible tubings to Y-sites and other rigid housings or any of the components of the medical infusion set or other medical device assemblies. It may also be desirable to include in the cement composition polymer resins from the articles being joined. These optional components can be added in an amount by weight of the composition from 0-10%, more preferably from 0.2-5% and most preferably from 0.2-3%. The third component can be selected from the group comprising polyethylene copolymers having a density less than 0.880 g/cc, polymethyl pentene, polypropylene having a modulus of less than 10,000 psi and more preferably less than 4,000 psi, and certain styrene containing copolymers and interpolymers. Typically these flexible type polypropylenes are atactic.   Certain polypropylene copolymers with ethylene are also suitable.    Suitable styrene containing polymers include Dow's<br><br>
WO 01/18112<br>
^interpolymer of styrene sold under the tradename INDEX. Other suitable styrene containing polymers include SBS, SIS and hydrogenated derivatives thereof such as SEBS and.SEPS.<br>
The method of using a polymeric cement to assemble medical devices comprises the steps of: (1) providing a first article of a low crystallinity polymer set forth above; (2) providing a second article of a low crystallinity polymer set forth above; (3) providing a cement composition having a first component of a cyclic olefin containing polymer or a bridged polycyclic hydrocarbon containing polymer and a second component of an effective amount of a solvent having a solubility parameter of less than about 20 (MPa)1/2 and more preferably selected from the group of aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons having a molecular weight less than about 200 g/mole; (4) applying the cement composition to one of the first and second articles to define a bonding area; and (5) attaching the first article to the second article along the bonding area to fixedly attach the first article to the second article.<br>
Suitable polyolefins for the first and second articles can be selected from the group comprising homopolymers and copolymers of  ethylene, propylene, butene, pentene, hexene, heptene, octene,   nonenene, and decene.   Suitable copolymers of ethylene include: (a) ethylene copolymerized with monomers selected from the group of a-olefins having 3-10 carbons, lower alkyl and lower alkene substituted carboxylic acids and ester and anhydride derivatives thereof, (b) ethylene-propylene rubbers, (c) EPDM, and (d) ionomers.   Preferably, the carboxylic acids have from 3-10 carbons.   Such carboxylic acids therefore include acetic acid, acrylic acid and butyric acid. The term "lower alkene" and "lower alkyl" is meant to include a carbon chain having from 3-18 carbons more preferably 3-10 and most preferably 3-8 carbons. Thus, a subset of this group of comonomers includes, as a representative but non-limiting example, vinyl acetates, vinyl acrylates, methacrylates, methyl methacrylates, acrylic acids, methyl acrylic acids, ethyl acrylates, and ethyl acyrlic acids.<br>
The first component of the cement composition can also be a copolymer of the cyclic olefins or the bridged polycyclic hydrocarbons set forth above in Section I. Suitable comonomers of the COCs can be selected from the group comprising a-olefins having from 2-10 carbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, cyclic hydrocarbons, and bridged<br><br>
WO 01/18112<br>
polcyclic hydrocarbons. In a preferred form of the invention the first component is a copolymer of a norbomene monomer and an ethylene monomer and more preferably the norbomene monomer is present in at least about 20 mole percent of the copolymer and even more preferably the norbomene is present from about 30 to about 60 mole percent. The cement composition can also have an additional optional component selected from the group of polyethylene copolymers having a density less than about 0.880 g/cc, polymethyl pentene, polypropylene having a modulus of less than about 10,000 psi and more preferably less than about 4,000 psi, and certain styrene containing copolymers and interpolymers.   Typically these flexible type polypropylenes are atactic.   Certain polypropylene copolymers with ethylene are also suitable. Suitable styrene and ethylene containing polymers include Dow's interpolymer of styrene sold under the tradename INDEX. Other suitable styrene containing polymers include SBS, SIS and hydrogenated derivatives thereof such as SEBS and SEPS.<br>
In a preferred form of the invention, the method for using a polymeric cement to assemble medical devices comprises the steps of: (1) providing a first article of a low crystallinity polymer set forth above; (2) providing a second article of a low crystallinity polymer set forth above; (3) providing a cement composition comprising: (a) a first component in an amount by weight of from 1-20% of the cement composition and obtained by copolymerizing a norbomene monomer and an ethylene monomer, the norbomene monomer being present in an amount of at least about 20 mole percent of the copolymer; (b) a second component of a solvent in an amount by weight from about 99% to about 80% of the cement composition; and (c) an optional third component in an amount by weight from about 0-10% by weight of the cement composition and selected from the group of optional components set forth above; (4) applying the cement composition to one of the first and second articles to define a bonding area; and (5) attaching the first article to the second article along the bonding area to fixedly attach the first article to the second article.<br>
The present invention also provides a medical device assembly. The assembly has a first article of a first polymeric material selected from the group comprising polyolefins, styrene containing polymers, cyclic olefin containing polymers and bridged polycyclic hydrocarbon containing polymers. The assembly also has a second article of<br><br>
 a polymeric material selected from the group comprisingpolyolefins, styrene containing Polymers, cyclic olefin containing polymers and bridged polycyclic hydrocarbon, containing polymers.

VI. COC Blends<br>
Blends of the components set forth in the following talbe were prepared wim a Brabender mixer at 250°C<br>
at 50 rpm for 4 minutes.<br>
Films were prepared by compression molding at 450°F to a thickness about 0.4 mm.<br>
The Haze property is useful for the end user to see through the medical device for the purpose of<br>
examining the liquid level, particulates, contamination, or the presence of drugs. Lower haze gives clearer<br>
view and higher haze gives a fuzzy view. Low haze is frequently a desirable property for medical devices<br>
such as solution containers, drug delivery devices, I.V. and blood sets, dialysis devices, and syringes.<br>
The haze and total light transmittance of the film were measured using a ColorQuest instrument with both<br>
sides of the film wetted with isopropyl alcohol to remove the effect of surface roughness.<br>

Summary:<br>
The polymer blends that have lower haze, i.e. better clariy, are Topas 8007 blended with ethylene<br>
copolymers that have hexene comonomer polymerized with metallocene catalyst.   The blends with the<br>
lowest haze are from the blends with polyethylene with hexene comonomer, polymerized with a<br>
metallocene catalyst and with a density of higher than 0.900 and more preferably higher than 0.93 (e.g.<br>
