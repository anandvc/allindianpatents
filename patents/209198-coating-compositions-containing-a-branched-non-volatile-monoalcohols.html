CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPHCAHON<br>
This application claims priority of Provisional Application No. 60/224139, filed on August 10, 2000 and European patent application No. EP 00203453.6, filed on September 28, 2000.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is an industry need to improve the flow behavior of coating compositions comprising polyisocyanate compounds and hydroxyKunctional flim-forming polymers, and the appearance of coatings formed from such coating compositions while maintaining other properties of the coating compositions and coatings. It has been found that non-volatile branched monoalcohols can provide the desired improvements. Particularly useful are long chain linear monoalcohols with 12 or more carbon atoms. Since these monoalcohols with 12 or more carbon atoms are generally solid at ambient temperature, their use in coatings compositions, Is thought to be limited. C:;prisingly, \i has been found that some long chain non-volatile branched monoalcohols are suitable as an additive in coating compositions, in particular multi-component (at least two component) coating compositions. This results in coating compositions that have improved flow behavior and that produce coatings having improved appearance without an unacceptably adverse effect on other properties.<br>
Coating compositions comprising a polyisocyanate and polyol are known from^ for example, European Patent Application No. 0 219 131. This reference also discloses use of such coating compositions for various purposes, including tiie top coating of relatively heavy weight articles, such as vehicles, industrial machinery and buildir^ and construction machinery.<br>
Fast setting, fast curing coating compositions using acrylic binders with a high Tg are mentioned, for example, in US 5,741,880 and 5,759,631. The combination of a hard acrylic with a low viscosity polyol is mentioned in US 5,286,782. To obtain low VOC coating compositions, fast evaporating solvents with low photochemical reactive solvents such as acetone, methytacetate and tertiary butylacetate can the added. Combining fast evaporating solvents with acrylic binders can result in poor flow and appearance. To improve flow and appearance, large amounts of low viscosity polyols are sometimes added, but they may cause slower curing and poor setting.<br><br>
U.S. 4,235,766 discloses a coating composition comprising an organic polyhydroxy compound and an organic polyisocyanate. The coating composition additionally comprises 2-methyl-2-propanol and/or 2-methyl-2-butanol. These monoalcohols are volatile compounds. A disadvantage in using volatile compounds is that there is no control in how much of the compound is built into the coating after application of the coating composition and how much evaporates and contributes to the VOC of the coating composition.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The current invention relates to a coating composition comprising a polyisocyanate compound, a hydroxyl-functional film-forming polymer, and a non-volatile branched monoalcohol. An aliphatic branched monoalcohol is preferred.<br>

The solvent can be part of the hydroxl functional component, the polyisocyanate component and/or it can be a separate reducer. More particularly, in a multi-component system, the reducer may be one of the components. In a multi-component system, comprising a polyisocyanate component, a hydroxl functional componeni nnd a third component, the reducer may be the third component.<br>
The coating composition can also comprise catalysts for the isocyanate-hydroxyl reaction, such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, trietiiyl amine, and the like. The coating compositions may also contain pigments. Inorganic as well as organic pigments can be used. The composition can further comprise conventional additives, such as stabilizers, surfactants, fillers, UV-absorbers, catalyst blockers, anti-oxidants, pigment dispersants, flow additives, theology control agents, levelling agents, and solvents. The solvent can be any solvent known in tiie art., i.e. aliphatic and/ or aromatic hydrocarbons. Examples include Solvesso® 100, Exxate 600, toluene, xylene, 4-chloro-benzotrifluoride, butanol, JsopnDpanol, butyl acetate, tert.-butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, metiioxy propyl acetate, n-butyl propionate, ethoxyethylpropionate, acetone, metiiy! isobutyl ketone, methyl isoamyl ketone, methyl etiiyl ketone, ether, ether alcohol, t?.-^ ether ester, or a mixture of any of these.<br>
Preferably, the coating composition comprises less than 550 g/l of volatile organic solvent based on the total composition, more preferably less than 500 g/l, most preferably less than 480 g/l.<br>
The present invention also relates to a multi-component coating composition. Such multi-component coating composition comprises at least two components, i.e. a hydroxy^ functional component and a polyisocyanate component. Preferably, the multi-component coating composition comprises three components having a third component, i.e. a reducer, comprising solvents to provide a coating composition with a sprayable viscosity.<br>
The coating composition of tiie present invention may be applied to any substrate. The substrate may be, for example, metal, plastic, wood, glass, ceramic, or anomer coating layer. The other coating layer may be comprised of the coating composition of the current invention or it may be a different coating composition. The coating compositions<br><br>
of the current invention show particular utility as clearcoats, basecoats, pigmented topcoats, primers, and fillers. The coating, compositions can be applied by conventional means such as by spray gun, bnjsh, or roller, spraying being preferred. Curing temperatures are preferably between 0 and 80°C, and more preferably between 20 and 60*C. The compositions are particularly suitable in the preparation of coated metal substrates, such as in the refinish industry, in particular the body shop, to repair automobiles and transportation vehicles and in finishing large transportation vehicles such as trains, trucks, buses, and airplanes.<br>
Preferred is the use of the coating composition of the present invention as clearcoat. Clearcoats are required to be highly transparent and must adhere well to the basecoat layer. It is further required that the clearcoat does not change the aesthetic aspect of the basecoat by strike-in, i.e. discoloration of the basecoat due to solvents present in the clearcoat composition, or by yellowing of the clearcoat upon outdoor exposure. A clearcoat based on the coating composition of the present invention does not have these drawbacks.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of a multilayer coating comprising the steps of applying a basecoat composition on an optibnally coated substrate, optionally curing the basecoat, applying on top of the basecoat a clearcoat composition according to the present invention, and curing the multilayer coating.<br>
In the case of the coating composition being a clearcoat, the basecoat may be a conventional basecoat known in the coating art Examples are solvent borne basecoats, e.g.' Autobase © ex Akzo Nobel Coatings and water borne basecoats, e.g., Autowave® ex Akzo Nobel Coatings. Furthermore, the basecoat may comprise pigments (color pigments, metallics and/or pearls), wax, solvents, flow additives, neutralizing agent, and defoamers. Also high-solid basecoats can be used. These are, for instance, based on polyols, imines, and Isocyanates. The clearcoat composition is then applied to the surface of a basecoat and then cured. An intermediate curing step for the basecoat may be introduced.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following specific but non-limiting examples.<br><br>
