PREPARATION OF M(CO) 3-COMPLEXES BY SOLID PHASE TECHNIQUES VIA METAL ASSISTED CLEAVAGE FROM THE SOLID SUPPORT<br>
The invention relates to the field of radiopharmaceuticals. In particular the invention relates to a process for the preparation of a metal complexed agent via metal assisted cleavage from a solid support.<br>
In a further aspect the invention relates to new solid phase bound conjugates of a ligand and a biomolecule.<br>
In yet a further aspect the invention relates to new metal completed ligand-biomolecule conjugates, compositions comprising these new complexes and their use.<br>
In still a further aspect the invention relates to a kit for the preparation of a diagnostic or therapeutic pharmaceutical composition.<br>
For the application of radiolabeled bioactive molecules such as i.e. peptides in clinical routine diagnosis or therapy it is highly desirable that only labeled compounds are injected to avoid saturation of the corresponding receptors in   vivo  or toxic side effects from "cold", unlabeled compounds. Furthermore, binding of large amounts of unlabeled biomolecules to the receptors spoils the possibility of getting clear images (scintigrams) and, thus, often disables a clear diagnosis.<br>
According to "the state of the art, high specific activity in a normal homogenous labeling procedure can only be<br>
r<br>
achieved by using the lowest possible amount (concentration) of derivatized biomolecules (or ligand for 99mTc which is coupled to the biomolecule) which still results in quantitative labeling. Depending on the ligand and the complex<br><br>
precursor, these amounts often have to be relatively high since at low concentrations the rate of complexation is governed by a second order kinetic and, thus, labeling is too slow and accompanied by decomposition of ligand or 99mTc precursor. The lowest concentration limit is often not convenient in routine use, since slightly changed conditions (temperature, time) at such a concentration do not end up with quantitative labeling yield. Correspondingly, side- and decomposition products as well as starting materials are still present in the final solution.<br>
A convenient way of a physically separating 'cold' from 'hot' compound is by attaching the ligand-biomolecule conjugate to a solid phase material and cleave it from there concomitantly with the complex formation. Examples for such metal assisted cleavage from solid phases are rare.<br>
American patent US-5,789,555 (Pollak et al. ) describes a process for labeling peptides with technetium-99m, rhenium-186 or rhenium-188. The process comprising the steps of covalently coupling the peptides to a solid support, by means of a thioether bond with a maleimide linker. By introducing pertechnetate to the support, a 99mTcv (=0)-peptide complex is formed. Upon complex formation, 99mTcv(=0) catalyzes cleavage of .the peptide from the support, by breaking the C-S bond, thus releasing the 99raTcv (=0)-peptide complex from the support.<br>
It is known from literature, that protected thiols release the protecting group by coordination to a Tc=0 center. Based on these findings Pollak et. al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, 11593-11594 (1999) bound a tetradentate chelator via a thioether bond to a gold surface. Upon coordination of Tc(V)<br><br>
to this ligand the 99raTc-complex was selectively released into solution by breaking the S-Au-bond as the sulfur coordinated to the Tc.<br>
Mo„re recently, Dunn-Duf ault, et. al. (Nucl. Med. Biol. 27, 803-807 (2000)) described a variant of this method by covalently binding the chelator to an organic polymeric support.<br>
The above mentioned processes for producing Tc and Re labeled organic complexes all depend on cleavage of a C-S or Au-S bond. This C-S and Au-S bond, with which the ligand is covalently bound to the solid support, is sensitive to oxidation. Therefore, it is necessary to store solid supports comprising ligands covalently linked via a C-S bond under reducing conditions. This is especially true for long term storage. The necessity of storage under reducing conditions requires additional measures to be taken for storage. Moreover, if the supports are to be used for the generation of compounds suitable for pharmaceutical applications, the presence of reducing agents is highly undesirable from the standpoint c-- pharmaceutical safety. Therefore, there will be certain restrictions for use of the known solid bound ligands for such applications.<br>
Additionally, the use of these metal oxide species is accompanied by restrictions to the ligands that are available for use therewith i.e. tetradentates. Hence the sole disclosure in the prior art of peptidic ligands for use with a 99mTcv(=0) center.<br>
Thus there is a need for new processes for preparing metal labeled complexes by solid phase techniques via metal assisted cleavage from the solid support which employ solid<br><br>
phase bound .biomolecule-ligand conjugates which are more stable under pharmaceutical!;/ acceptable conditions than the prior art conjugates.<br>
Additionally, the availability of more ligands that can be used in the formation of metal complexed ligand-biomolecule conjugates by means of solid phase techniques via metal assisted cleavage will be advantageous, since this will provide a more flexible use of this technique. It is the object of th6 present invention to provide improved techniques for the preparation of labeled diagnostic and therapeutic compounds.<br>
In the research that led to the present invention, it was found that some organic molecules (ligands) that are able to coordinate to a metal and bound to a solid support via a tertiary amine group, in the presence of<br>
[Tc(H2O) 3(CO)3]+, cleave from the solid support upon formation of [Tc (CO) 3-*.igand]-complexes . The selective hydrolytic C-N bond cleavage is clearly mediated by the low valent carbonyl [Tc(H20) (C0)3]+ center, formed during complex formation, and does not occur under the same reaction conditions in the absence of [99mTc (H20) 3 (CO) 3] + . After release from the solid support, the former tertiary amine is present as a coordinated secondary amine.<br>
The mechanism for this [Tc(CO)3-Ligand]-complex is proposed to "~&gt;e as follows. As the tertiary amino group of the solid-bound chelator (the so-called ligand) coordinates to the cationic metal center of [M (H20) 3 (CO) 3] n+, it becomes partially positive and the adjacent carbon atom is therefore activated for nucleophilic attack. A remaining hydroxy group attacks the methylene group of the chelator and induces C-N bond cleavage<br><br>
(Figure 2). The third donor site of the chelator coordinates to the metal center, and the product complex is released into solution. Uncomplexed chelator and uncleaved complex remain bound to the solid phase.<br>
It, was found that labeled compounds obtained by hydrolytic cleavage of the ligand from the solid support with [99mTc(H20) 3 (CO) 3]+ as described above had a very high specific activity i.e. there was little uncomplexed ligand in solution. The amount of uncomplexed ligand in solution was in the order of 10~7 M. Therefore, this specific cleavage reaction can be attractively exploited for the preparation of so-called "no carrier added" (n.c.a.) complexes of technetium and other metals with =i similar chemical reactivity.<br>
Thus the invention relates to a new process for generating a metal complexed agent, comprising contacting (I) a solid phase bound organic conjugate represented by the formula<br><br>
wherein:<br>
the sphere is the solid phase;<br>
C is a methylene group that may be substituted by one or two<br>
groups R4 and R5, which can be in particular aliphatic or<br><br>
aromatic sub,stituents, or RO, RS or R2N, wherein R is an aliphatic or arylic group,<br>
L is a linker that may or may not be present, that is coup]ed to the solid support and has activating properties towards nucleophilic attack to the C group and is preferably a phenyl, alkyl, allyl or aryl; and<br>
Rl and R2 are the same or different and are a metal coordinating group or a non-coordinating organic group, which solid .ohase bound organic conjugate is optionally derivatized at one or both of Rl and R2 with a biologically active molecule, with (II) [M(H20)3(CO)3]n+,<br>
wherein M is selected from the group consisting of technetium (Tc), rhenium (Re), rhodium (Rh), platinum (Pt), iridium (Ir) and copper (Cu) and n is 1, 2 or 3 depending on the metal; under suitable conditions to cause the formation of a coordinate bond between [M(H20) 3 (CO)3]n+ and the tertiary amine nitrogen atom of the solid phase bound organic conjugate and thereby the release of the metal complexed agent thus formed from the support.<br>
The linker may or may not be present. It may be already present in the available solid support or can be introduced later. When it is present it is preferably a good activating group for nucleophilic attack at C and selected from the grcjp consisting of phenyl, vinyl, aryl and other non-aliphatic or aliphatic groups. The phenyl, vinyl, aryl, other non-aliphatic or aliphatic group may be substituted, and if they are they are preferably substituted with an electron withdrawing group selected from OR, R, NR2, wherein R is an aliphatic or an arylic group.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment the linker is as shown in<br>
formula II:<br><br>
(ID<br>
wherein XI is C or 0 and X2 an electron withdrawing<br>
substituents and preferably a -OCH3 group.<br>
When Rl and R2 or one of Rl and R2 are non-coordinating organic groups they may be selected from alkyl, phenyl or be-nzyl or derivatives thereof.<br>
Preferably, Rl and/or R2 are selected from the group consisting of<br><br>
wherein R3 is directly the tertiary amine or is an aliphatic chain containing between 1 and 3 carbons.<br>
The metal M may be any metal and is preferably selected from the group consisting of Tc, Re, Ru, Rh, Ir, Cu and Pt. The metal is most preferably 99mTc, 1B6Re or 188Re.<br><br>
Preferably the metal is suitable for use as an imaging ager.t, e.g. by transmission of high-energy particles or paramagnetic characteristics, or as a radionuclide.<br>
[M (H20) 3 (CO) 3] ""*" can be generated by any suitable means known in the art. Suitable means for generating [M (H2O) 3 (CO) 3]n+ are for example from the permetallate form as disclosed by Alberto et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123, 3135-3136 (2001}) or in W098/48848 (Alberto et al.).<br>
The molecule according to formula I without the solid support is called herein the ligand. The ligand can be in particular a tridentate ligand if Rl and R2 are selected from the group consisting of<br><br>
but also a bidentate chelator if Rl and R2 or one of both are an aliphatic or aromatic non-coordinating group.<br>
The ligands used according to the invention in combination with [M (H ?0) 3 (CO) 3] n+ can be a diversity of tridentate ligands, the main requirement being the presence of a tertiary amine group as the central part of the ligand, which forms -_he C-N bond that is coupled with the solid support and cleaved upon complex formation. Preferably the ligands used are those based on aliphatic or aromatic amines or carboxylates and combinations thereof as donors. The ligand can also be a bidentate chelator if Rl and R2 but not both is<br><br>
a non-coordinating aliphatic or aromatic group. This is shown in Example 10.<br>
In particular diethylene triamine, picolylamine-W-acetic acid, N- (2-aminoethyl)-glycine or imino-diacetic acid can be used as ligands in the invention.<br>
The ligand can be covalently linked to the solid support by first forming a halogenated resin e.g. by the methods described by Ngu and Patel (Tet. Lett. 38, 973 - 976 (1997). This halogenated resin can subsequently be reacted with a protected ligand. After deprotection, the ligand bound resin is obtained. If the ligand is attached to the solid phase by this method the covalent bond attaching it to the solid support will be a C-N bond. The ligand can also be synthesized on the solid support starting from an amino resin, e.g. by reductive amination and/or alkylation with alkyl halides as described in examples 5, 6, 8 and 9. Preparation of a loaded resin is discussed in more detail in examples 1-9.<br>
In this specification the term ligand refers to a compound comprising at least one metal coordinating atom capable of forming a coordinating bond with a metal to form a stable metal-ligand complex. A ligand comprising more than one metal coordinating atom may be referred to as a chelator or a multidentate ligand. Bidentate ligands are ligands with two metal-coordinating atoms, tridentate ligands are ligands with three metal-coordinating atoms and tetradentate ligands are ligands with four metal coordinating atoms.<br>
The biologically active molecule (also called herein "biomolecule") that may be coupled to the ligand can be any molecule that is active in diagnosis or therapy. The molecule can be coupled at any position except at the nitrogen linked<br><br>
to the solid support. It may be a targeting molecule for directing the radioactive product to the site that needs to be diagnosed or treated or it may have a therapeutic activity that is independent from the radiolabel. The biologically active molecule may be selected from the group consisting of amino acids; steroids; proteins, in particular structural proteins, enzymes or antibodies; carbohydrates; polysaccharides and oligosaccharides; nucleosides, nucleotides, oligonucleotides and polynucleotides; lipids, peptides and pharmaceutically active small molecules such as central nervous system receptor binding compounds.<br>
The biomolecule can be linked to the ligand with any suitable means known in the art e.g. by reductive amination of an aldehyde to a primary amine group of the ligand or by introducing a binding site at the arylic system. The biomolecule can be linked to the ligand prior to or after binding the ligand to the solid support.<br>
It was found that the choice of the solid support may further improve the efficiency of the process of the invention. The solid support has to be able to swell in water, it has to be stable at reaction conditions, and it must not contain metal coordinating units. This is in particular the case when the solid support is a polyethylene glycol resin, or a hybrid of polyethylene glycol and polystyrene, e.g. a polystyrene resin with polyethylene glycol spacers with a benzyl alcohol anchoring group.<br>
The process of the invention may further comprise the step of collecting the metal complexed agent (i.e. the radiopharmaceutical) for further use.<br><br>
After preparation of n.c.a. 99mTc radiopharmaceutical, the solid phase polymer can be collected, washed and reused.<br>
Preferably, the process is performed at a pH that is in the range of about 6.0-11.0, preferably in the range of about 7.5-9.5.<br>
Suitable temperatures for performing the reaction are within the range of about 40-100°C. Preferably the reaction is performed in the range of about 70-82°C.<br>
According to a further aspect thereof the invention relates to the solid phase bound ligand-biomolecule conjugate of formula I, and compositions comprising such a compound. Preferably these compositions are in a form, which can be stored during prolonged time periods under pharmaceutically acceptable conditions.<br>
With the process according to the invention metal complexed ligand-biomolecule conjugates can be obtained with a high specific activity by filtration without further post-labeling purification.<br>
According to a further aspect thereof the invention relates to the metal complexed ligand-biomolecule conjugates obtainable with the process according to the invention. Usually the conjugates are comprised in a composition which is the result of the process of the invention, and which is characterized in that it is essentially free of uncomplexed ligand-biomolecule conjugate e.g. the level of uncomplexed ligand-biomolecule conjugate in the composition containing them is in the 10"7 M range. Compositions with such characteristics are a further aspect of the invention.<br>
Due to the short half-life of some isotopes used in<br><br>
radiopharmaceuticals, e.g. 99mTc, labeling of ligand-biomolecule conjugates just prior to their use can be important for the specific activity of the complexed conjugate. The amount of decayed complex in a freshly labeled composition vill be lower compared to the situation when the conjugate was complexed a substantial amount of time prior to its use.<br>
Therefore, in yet a further aspect the invention relates to a kit for the preparation of a diagnostic or therapeutic pharmaceutical composition, comprising a container with the molecule of formula (I), in which the reaction with a solution of [M (H20) 3 (CO) 3]n+ take place. The container can be a vessel or cc'iumn. The solution of [M (H20) 3 (CO) 3] n+ is introduced into the vessel or column to start the reaction. The solution can be part of the kit or provided by other means. In an alternative embodiment, the reagents for the preparation of the metal carbonyl [M (H2O) 3 (CO) 3]n+ are comprised in the kit. In addition, the kit may comprise a facility for filtration.<br>
The use of a kit further provides flexibility to the metal complex that can be formed since a selection of a suitable metal can be made just prior to the complexation reaction.<br>
The principle of the preparation of no carrier added (n.c.a.) metal complexed compounds according to the invention is explained in Figure 1. A tridentate ligand e.g. diethylene triamine is bound via a linker, here a benzyl derivative, to a solid phase via a tertiary amine. To the chelator (ligand) a biomolecule, is attached, thus forming a ligand-biomolecule conjugate. Upon introduction of [Tc(H20) 3 (CO) 3]+, complex<br><br>
formation occurs and the tridentate ligand replaces two aqua ligands. The' remaining hydroxy ligand on [To(H20)2 (OH) (C0)3]T can now attack the activated methylene group to induce C-N-bond cleavage. Activation of the methylene group occurs by complexation of the tertiary amino group to the technetium center, which withdraws electron density from the chelator and make it susceptible for nucleophilic attack.<br>
The main species with reactivity towards the tertiary amine atom of the solid phase bound biomolecule-Ligand conjugate is [M(OH) (H20) 2 (CO)3] . In solution [M(OH) (H20) 2 (CO) 3] is in equilibrium with the conjugate in the form of [M (H20) 3 {CO) 3]"*   and further dissociated forms, depending on the pH of the solution. It will be understood :hat, depending on the pH, [M(OH) (H20) 2 (CO)3] is at least &gt;artially interchangeable with these species due to the equilibrium.<br>
The invention is further explained with the rollowing non-restrictive examples. In the Examples reference s made to the following figures:<br>

EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1<br>
A model ligand was covalently attached to an appropriate solid phase resin. The solid phase resin has to swell in water to allow diffusion of the Tc-species, and the anchoring group to which the ligand is coupled has to be an activating group for nucleophilic attack. The polystyrene/ polyethylene glycol resin TentaGel S AC (Rapp Polymere GmbH, Tubingen, Germany) fulfills these requirements. Its active site, a benzyl alcohol derivative, was converted into the corresponding bromide 1 (Ngu and Patel, Tet. Lett. 38, 973 -976 (1997) ) .<br>
N,N"-Bis(l-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexyliden) ethyl)diethylenetriamine (2) (101.8 mg,<br>
235.9 :mol) was dissolved in DMF (5 ml), resin 1 (196.6 mg, 41.2  mol) was added, and the mixture was gently stirred at room temperature for 22 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered, and the resin was washed with DMF {3 times), DMF and methanol (3 times alternating), and DMF (5 times). The protecting groups were removed by washing the resin 10 times with a solution of hydrazine hydrate, 2% in DMF (1 ml) for 5 minutes. The reaction mixture was filtered, and the resin was washed with DMF (3 times), DMF and methanol (5 times alternating). DMF (3 times), and diethyl ether (3 times). The<br><br>
resin was dried at high vacuum to give product 3 in a yield of 192.3 mg (97.8%; capacity 0.236 mmol/g, coupling efficiency 100%) .<br>
Free amino groups on the solid phase resins were visualized by color tests: bromophenol blue solution in water for alkaline resins and trinitrotoluenesulfonic acid (TNBS) in DMF/diisopropylethylamine 10:1 exclusively for primary amines. Resin 3 was positive in both tests, whereas the protected intermediate was negative on TNBS staining. The capacity of the resins (in mmol of bound chelator per gram) and the efficiency for the coupling of the chelators to the solid supports were calculated from the N-content of the resins as determined by elementary analyses.<br>
The chelating capacity of resin 3 was verified by stirring it in a lmM solution of [99Tc (H20) 3 (CO) 3] + (7 equivalents) at room temperature. Analyzing of the filtrated solution by p~ liguid scintillation counting showed a decrease of activity of 14%, which is consistent with quantitative complex formation on the resin. HPLC analyses exhibited only peaks of the starting material, indicating that no cleavage from the solid phase occurred under these mild conditions. The once formed 99Tc-complex turned out to be stable under the conditions used for labeling. Even prolonged heating at 80°C for 5 hours in phosphate buffer pH 7.5, yielded only 3% beta-activity in the solution, at least one order of magnitude lower than expected.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
An other tridentate ligand, yielding nan. charged complexes, was attached to the same resin as in Example 1. N-<br><br>
Picolylamine acetic acid ethyl ester (54 mg, 280 :mol) was dissolved in DMF (3 ml) and resin 1 (280 mg, 67 :rnol) was added. The mixture was gently stirred at room temperature for 15 hours, the reaction mixture was filtered, and the resin was washed with DMF (3 times), DMF and methanol (3 times alternating), and diethyl ether (3 times). The protected intermediate was positive on bromophenol blue and negative on TNBS stainir-i. The protecting groups were removed by gencly stirring the resin in a mixture of water (5 ml) and sodium hydroxide 1M (0.30 ml) for 28 hours. Filtration of the resin, washing with DMF (3 times), DMF and methanol (3 times alternating), DMF (3 times), and diethyl ether (3 times) and drying at high vacuum gave product 4 in a yield of 268 mg (96%; capacity 0.209 mmol/g, coupling efficiency 87.1%). Resin 4 was negative on all of the staining reactions.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
An other tridentate ligand, yielding negatively charged complexes, was attached to the same resin as in example 1. Dimethylimino diacetate hydrochloride (6.4 mg, 33 :mol) and diisopropylethylamine (11.2 :1, 66 :mol) were dissolved in DMF (0.5 ml) and resin 1 (280 mg, 67 :mol) was added. The mixture was gently stirred at room temperature for 24 hours, the reaction mixture was filtered, and the resin was washed with DMF (3 times), DMF and methanol (3 times alternating), methanol and water (3 times alternating). The protected intermediate was positive on bromophenol blue and negative on TNBS staining. The protecting groups were removed rinsing the resin with aqueous NaOH (0.1M for 3 hours, then<br><br>
0.01M for 12 hours). Filtration of the resin, washing with NaOH 0.1M (2 times), water (5 times), water and methanol (3 times alternating), methanol (3 times), and diethyl ether (3 times) and drying at high vacuum gave product 5 in an yield of &gt; 35 mg (100%;, capacity 4 mmol/g, coupling efficiency 18%). Resin 5 was negative on all of the staining reactions.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Another tridentate ligand, yielding non-charged I complexes, was attached to the same resin as in example 1.<br>

Triethylenetetramine (0.150 ml, 1.00 mmol) was dissolved in THF (30 ml), and the solution was cooled to -78°C. A solution of ethyl trifluoroacetate (0.109 ml, 1.00 mmol) in THF (5 ml) was added within 30 min at -78DC, and the solution was stirred at that temperature for 4 hours. Then it was warmed up to 0°C.<br>
In the meantime, (+)-Biotin (244 mg, 1.00 mmol) in DMF (8 ml) was heated to 80DC to give a colorless solution. N,N1-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (216 mg, 1.05 mmol) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (121 mg, 1.05 mmol) was added to the hot solution. The mixture was allowed to slowly cool down to room temperature.

After stirring at room temperature for 18 hours, the solvent was removed in   vacuo  and water was added to the residue. The pH was adjusted to 3-4. The mixture was filtered, the eluate was neutralized and the water was removed in   vacuo.   The crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica, dichloromethane/methanol/triethylamine 5:1:0.1) to give N-biotinyl-N''-trifluoroacetyl-triethyl-tetramine in a yield of 60.5 mg (0.129 mmol, 12.9%).

EXAMPLE 13<br>
In this example, a method for the preparation of labeled peptide derivatives is described. A protected dipeptide with a free carboxylic end group was coupled to a partially protected polyamine. All of the protecting groups were removed, and Dde protection was introduced to selectively block the primary amino groups at the peptide and the chelator. This allowed to selectively bind the conjugate to a solid support via formation of a tertiary amino group from one of the unprotected secondary amino groups of the chelator. W, N' , W '-tri(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)triethylene-tetramine (103.3 mg, 234.5 umol), Boc-Phe-Gly-OH (75.6 mg, 234.5 umol), PyBOP (183 mg, 352 umol) and diisopropyl ethylamine (20 ul, 117 umol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (2.5 ml). The solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 lours. Periodically, diisopropylethylamine (20 pi, 117 umol) tfas added to keep the pH &gt;7. The solvent was removed in vacuo, :he residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed in brine (3 times), cold HC1 0.5M (3 times), NaHC03 10% (2 times), and :&gt;rine (3 times). The organic phase was dried over MgS04, and<br><br>
the solvent was removed in   vacuo  to give N- f tert-butyloxycarbonyl-phenylalanyl-glycyl)-W, N' ', N' ' '-tri{tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-triethylenetetramine in an yield of 175.2 mg (231.6 umol, 98.8%). The structure was confirmed by mass spectroscopy and NMR.<br>
The Boc protecting groups were removed by stirring the product (162.2 mg, 0.169 mmol) in HC1 in ethyl acetate (ca. 1 M, 3 ml). After stirring at room temperature for 9 hours, the solvent was removed in  vacuo.   The residue was dissolved in water and stirred for 1 hour (pH was 2-3), then NaOH (1 M, 313 mmol) was added to neutralize the solution, and the solvent was evaporated in   vacuo  to give H-Phe-Gly-NH-C2H6-NH-C2H4-NH-C2H4-NH2 in quantitative yield. The structure was confirmed by mass spectroscopy and NMR.<br>
H-Phe-Gly-NH-C2H4-NH-C2H4-NH-C2H4-NH2 (113 mg, 0.152 mmol) and 2-Acetyldimedone (Dde-OH) (70.0 mg, 0.335 mmol) were dissolved in ethanol (4 ml). After stirring at room temperature for 20 hours, analysis by TLC exhibited full conversion of the amine to a single product. The solvent was removed to give Dde-Phe-Gly-NH-C2H6NH-C2H6-NH6H-j-NH-Dde. The structure was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. The crude product was used without separation from the surplus of 2-acetyldimedcne.<br>
Dde-Phe-Gly-NH-C3H4-NH-C2H4-NH-C2H„-NH-Dde (76 umol) and resin 1 (79.2 mg, 19 umol) were reacted as described in example 1. The protected intermediate was positive on bromophenol blue and negative on TNBS staining. The Dde protecting groups were removed as well as described in example 1, to give product 15. Resin 15 was positive on bromophenol blue and on TNBS staining.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
Labeling conditions: [99mTc (H20&gt; 3 (CO) 3] + was prepared out of [99tr'TcO,]" using a boroncarbonate kit (Alberto et al, J. Am.   Chem.   Sec.    123, 3135-3136 (2001)). 1 mg of the solid-phase bound chelators (0.2 mmole) were given to the [9SriTc (H20)3(CO) 3]+-solution (1 ml), the mixtures were shortly sonificated and then heated to 82DC for 30 minutes. The solutions were separated from the solid phase resin by filtration and analyzed by HPLC with gamma-detection. With all of the solid phase bound chelators, formation of soluble complexes was observed. The yield varied on chelator cype and reaction conditions between 5 to 50% (Table 1).<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
Resins 3 and 4 were also labeled in a one pot procedure, combining the formation of [99mTc (H20) 3 (CO) 3] + and the cleavage reaction. 1 mg of solid-phase bound chelators (0.2 mmole) was added to a boroncarbonate kit (Mallinckrodt Medical, Petcen, the Netherlands; Alberto et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123, 3135-3136 (2001)). NaTcO„ as eluted from a generator was added to the vial, and the mixture was kept at 78°C to 82DC for 20 to 60 minutes. The pH was 11. Cleavage yield was between 8 and 32%, conversion of pertechnetate between 40 and 54%.<br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
For the labeling reactions on resin 4, reaction conditions such as pH value and reaction temperature were varied to find optimal reaction conditions. For use as a<br><br>
radiotracer, complete conversion of the starting material [9SmTc(H20)3(CO)3] + and formation of one single product is required. Purification steps after the labeling procedure have to be avoided because of the radioactivity of the samples and their rapid decay (ti/2 = 6.2 hours). High cleavage yields are desirable to get solutions of high radioactivity.<br>
pH dependence of the cleavage reaction is shown in Figure 3. Cleavage yield increases from pH 6 with a maximum at pH 8.5. This is in consistence with deprotonation of [99mTc(H20)3(CG)3] + to [99mTc(OH) (H205 2 (CO) 3] (pKs for the Rhenium analog: 7.5; Egli et al, Organometallics   16, 1833-1840 (1997)) and, therefore, with the theory that a Tc-coordinated hydroxy ion is the nucleophile which attacks the CH2-group to cleave the C-N bond. Increasing the pH to 11 reduces the cleavage yield again. This could be due to formation of the negatively charged species [ 99raTc (OH) 2 (H20) (CO) 3]" which reduces the electrophilicity of a coordinated amino group.<br>
Temperature dependence of the reaction of resin 4 with [99mTc (H20) 3 (CO) 3] + was studied by analyzing the reaction products after full conversion of [99raTc (H20) 3 (CO) 3] +. At room temperature, only complex formation at the resin occurred, the solution after filtration from the solid phase exhibited no radioactivity. At 43°C, cleavage yield was observable but low. Then, it increased with increasing temperature (Figure 4). This clearly shows that there is a competition between complex formation at the resin and the cleavage reaction, with the cleavage reaction having the higher activation energy barrier. However, very high temperatures could be a disadvantage in view of the stability of the solid phase resin and of attached biomolecules. A reaction temperature of 70°C to 82°C is<br><br>
preferred for resin 4. Table 1<br><br><br><br><br>
