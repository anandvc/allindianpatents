				<td>The present invention relates to a cable entry for a switch cabinet.<br>
This invention relates to a cable inlet for a switchgear cabinet with an opening in the base side of a switchgear cabinet surrounded by a connecting support, in which the opening is closeable by means of base plates which may be aligned with one another and connected to the connecting support, the sides associated with one another of adjacent base plates having angled edges with seal strips secured thereto, and the cable is introduced between the seal strips into the switchgear cabinet and arc scaled by deformation of the seal strip.<br>
Such a cable inlet is known from DE 78 16 729 Ul. In this case the seal strips arc in the form of plastic foam blocks. When adjacent base plates arc aligned with one another, then the cables introduced between the plastic foam blocks of adjacent base plates are sealed, if during the alignment with one another the base plates are pressed against one  mother and thus the plastic loam blocks are deformed. In this case the edges of the base plates are uniformly angled to one side of the base plates, so that when there is a sufficiently wide sealing point on this side of the base plates, there must be sufficient space for these edges. In this way the installation space above the base plate is correspondingly<br><br>
As shown by DE 196 04 219 Cl, it is also known to attach to one side of  base plate an additional edge, which is aligned towards the other side ,&gt;l the base plale. Thus there are provided outwith the seal strip lateral areas which can be provided with a series of attachment means for non-'.ensioncd and/or electrically conductive connection of the cables to the base plate.<br>
it is the object of this invention to provide a cable inlet of the type already mentioned, winch affords a sufficiently wide seal point, without substantially restricting the installation space above and below the base (Mates, and without appreciably increasing the manufacturing costs of<br>
the base plates.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention in that the edges of the base  plates are in the form of a double fold, of which a first section is aligned towards the upper or lower side of the base plate, while the second end section of the double fold both extends over the first section and stands off relative to the under or upper side of the base plate, and in that the seal strip extends over the width of the end section of the double fold.<br><br>
The edge in the form of a doable fold of the base plate is simple to manufacture and extends to both sides of the base plate, so that the installation space, even when there is a wide seal point, is not appreciably restricted either above or beneath the base plate.<br>
In order that the base plate may be connected in a simple way to the connecting support of the switchgear cabinet, in one development the base plate is elongated at the sides without a double fold by support edges going beyond the double fold. The double fold then does not prevent placing of the base plate on the connecting support of the switchgear cabinet.<br>
if a cable inlet is provided at only one side of the base plate, then the ase plate is simplified in such a way that the base plates on the side opposite the double fold are provided with a singly folded edge.<br>
The single folded edge does not then impair the connection of the base plate to the connecting support, if the singly folded edge stands off on the under side of the base plate, and terminates before the support sections<br>
of the base" plate.<br>
The corners of the support sections of the base plate are preferably bevelled.<br><br>
A preferred development is characterized in that the end section of the double fold projects over identical parts on the upper and under side of the base plate.<br>
if a non tensioned or electrically conductive connection of the cable to the base plate is desired, then according to a further development the and section of the double fold is expanded at one side over the secured seal strip and is, provided in this area with at least one row of attachment means for non-tensioned and/or electrically conductive connection of the cable to the base plate.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a cable entry for a switch cabinet with an opening, enclosed by a connecting support, in the base side of a switch cabinet, in the case of which the opening can be 'â€¢losed off by means of base plates which can be positioned one beside die oilier in a row and can be connected to the connecting support, it being the case that the mutually associated sides of adjacent base plates nave angled borders of adjacent base plates have angled borders with sealing strips secured thereon, and the cables are introduced into the switch cabinet between the sealing strips, characterised in that the borders of the base plates are designed as double folds, of which a first section is directed towards the top side or underside of the base plate, while die second, end section of the double fold both extends over the first section and projects in relation to the underside or top side of the base plate, and in that the sealing strip extends over the width of the end section of the double fold.<br><br>
The   invention   will   be   explained   in   more   detail   with   reference   to   an embodiment given by way of example and shown in perspective in the<br>
The base plate 10 shown in perspective in the drawing is rectangular and provided only on one longitudinal side as a cable inlet. This longitudinal side' carries a double fold, which is folded in a simple manner on this sick' of the base plate 10. Thus a first section 11 is aligned toward the apper side of the base plate 10 and an end section 12 extends over the first section 11, lies thereon and does not project over the underside of the base plate 10. The seal strip 20, in the form of a plastic foam block, extends over the entire width of the end section 12. The double fold terminates at both ends<br>
before the narrow sides of the base plate 10, which serve as support edges 13 for connecting the base plate 10 to the connecting support of the switchgear cabinet. The corners of the base plate 10 are bevelled, as shown by the bevelled portions 14 and 15. On the side lying opposite the double fold with the seal strip 20, the base plate 10 carries a single edge 16 bent over towards the under side, which terminates corresponding to the double fold before the support edges 13. Naturally, this side of the base plate 10 can be provided with a double fold and a seal strip 20. Moreover the first section 1 1 can be aligned towards the under side, and the singly folded edge 16 of the base plate 10 can also be aligned towards the upper side of the base plate 10.<br>
The end section 12 can also be widened over the seal strip 20 and can be provided in this expanded area with a row of attachment means for non-tensioned and/or electrically conductive connection of the introduced cable 10 the base plate 10.<br><br><br><br>
