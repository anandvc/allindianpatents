Process for preparing acvlphosphanes and derivatives thereof<br>
The present invention relates to a new, selective process for the preparation of mono- and bisacylphosphanes, mono- and bisacylphosphane oxides or mono- and bisacylphosphane sulfides.<br>
The European Patent Publication EP1 135 399 B1 describes a process for the preparation of mono- and bisacylphosphanes, of mono- and bisacylphosphane oxides and of mono- and bisacylphosphane sulfides, which process comprises first reacting organic P-monohalogeno-phosphanes or P, P-dihalogenophosphanes or mixtures thereof, with an alkali metal or magnesium in combination with lithium, where appropriate in the presence of a catalyst, and then carrying out the reaction with acid halides and, in the case of the process for the preparation of oxides, carrying out an oxidation step and, in the case of the preparation of sulfides, reacting the phosphanes so obtained with sulfur. The reaction is usefully carried out in a solvent. The solvent used may be, in particular, ethers which are liquid at normal pressure and room temperature. Examples thereof are dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, methyl-propyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran. Tetrahydrofuran is preferably used.<br>
The International Application PCT/EP 03/50873, describes a process to prepare cycloorganyl phosphanes of the formula (RV)n by reacting R^Hala with an alkali metal or an alkaline-earth metal in an organic solvent such as toluene in the presence of an activator, e.g. N,N,N',N'- tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA).<br>
Furthermore, PCT/EP G3/50873describes the preparation of sodium catena-oligophosphane-α,ω-diides, e.g. the preparation of Na(L)3[Na5(P2Ph2)3(L)3] (L = solvent), which can react with mesitoylchioride (MesCO-CI) to obtain acylphosphanes of the formula PhP(C0Mes)2.<br>
H. Schindlbauer et al (Monatshefte Chemie 90 148 [1959]) describes a method for producing phosphanes by reacting R'PHal2 with 4 equivalents of highly dispersed sodium in toluene to obtain R1PNa2 and subsequent reaction with alcohol/water. The alcohol used is ethanol.<br>
The Schindlbauer process has the drawback that a considerable amount of undesired byproducts are obtained which need to be removed.<br><br>
Accordingly, there still remains a need for a process to produce acylphosphanes directly from<br>
an organic phosphorus halide resulting in a high yield and a substantially complete<br>
conversion.<br>
It has been found that the required selectivity can be achieved by using a proton source like<br>
sterically hindered alcohols, trialkylamine hydrohalogenes, bisarylamines, malono nitrile.<br>
malonic acid esters, amidine hydrohalogene and carboxylic acids.<br>

It is useful to employ from 4 to 6 atom equivalents of an alkali metal in solid or molten form, preferably sodium, for the preparation of bisacylphosphanes or monoacylphosphanes prepared from R1PHal2, and 2 to 3 atom equivalents of an alkali metal in solid or molten form for the preparation of monoacylphosphanes prepared from (Ri)2PHal. It is not necessary that the alkali metal is highly dispersed.<br>
Catalytic amounts of alkali or earth alkali hydroxides or of Na. K or Li alcoholates or of<br>
alcohols, preferably sterically hindered alcohols may be added prior or during the metallation<br>
step.<br>
In addition combinations of catalytic amounts of alkali and/or earth alkali metals and/or<br>
sterically hindered alcohols may be added prior or during the metallation step.<br>
Catalytic amounts refer to ranges from 0.1-50mol% with respect to the phosphorous organic compound lla, llb or llc.<br>
The reaction is carried out in an arene solvent such as in benzene, toluene, o-, m- or p-xylene, mesitylene, ethylbenzene, diphenylethane, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphtaline (tetraline), isopropylbenzene (cumol) or in mixtures thereof.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably above the melting temperature of sodium. It is recommended to stirr the reaction mixture.<br>
The reduction is carried out by reacting the intermediate V and/or (R1P)n. n&gt; 3 with a proton source like sterically hindered alcohols, trialkylamine hydrohalogenes, bisarylamines, malono nitrile, malonic acid esters, amidine hydrohalogene and carboxylic acids in the presence of surplus alkali metal from the metallation step whereby a protonated and/or a metallized<br><br>
phosphane (lld) and a protonated and/or metallized diphosphane (He) Ri-P(H,Me)-P(H,Me)-R1 is formed via different intermediary steps as the main component.<br><br>
Ri, R3, Me, m and n have the meaning cited above,<br>
The amount of the diphosphane (He) can be influenced by appropriate addition of the above mentioned catalysts prior, during or after the metallation step. Preferred catalysts are, for example, alkali-or earth alkali hydroxides in amounts of 0.1-10 mol% with respect to the phosphorous organic compound Ha, llb and llc. Other preferred catalysts are, for example, Li, Na or K alcoholates, preferably alcoholates of sterically hindered alcohols and most preferably KOH and sterically hindered K-alcoholates in amounts of 5-50mol% with respect to lla, lib and llc.<br>
In a further embodiment, the process starts with a birch-like reduction of diphospanes of the formula (R1)2-P-P(R1)2 or polyphosphanes of the formula [RiP]n, wherein Ri is as defined above and n is &gt; 3 with a metal, preferably sodium, in the presence a proton source like sterically hindered alcohols, trialkylamine hydrohalogenes, bisarylamines, malono nitrile, malonic acid esters, amidine hydrohalogene and carboxylic acids to obtain phosphanes of the formula R1PH2 or (Ri)2PH. The phosphanes are then reacted with an acid halide or an electrophilic compound Ra-Hal.<br>
The above diphospanes of the formula (R1)2-P-P(Ri)2 or polyphosphanes of the formula [R1P]n may be prepared as describes in the Int. Application PCT/EP 03/50873 by reacting R1PHal2with an alkali metal or an alkaline-earth metal in an organic solvent such as e.g. in toluene optionally in the presence of an activator such as e.g. N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) or by reacting R1Hal2 with active zinc in the presence of a solvent.<br>
The reduction step is the essential feature in the above-described novel process, as this step was shown to be largely responsible for the improved selectivity of the whole process.<br><br>
The reduction step can be carried out in the presence of an activator such as amines (triethylamine, tributylamine, piperidine, morpholine, N-methylpiperidine, N-methyl mor-pholine) or polyamines such as, for example TMEDA =N,N,N\N'-tetramethylethylenediamine.<br>
It is useful to employ from 1 to 2 equivalents of a proton source like sterically hindered alcohols, trialkylamine hydrohalogenes, bisarylamines, malono nitrile, malonic acid esters, amidine hydrohalogene and carboxylic acids. The solvent is preferably the same as in the metallation step.<br>
The reaction temperatures are preferably in the range from -20°C to +160°C. e.g. from 80°C to 140°C.<br>
The protonated and/or metallized phosphane (lid) and (lie) obtained as described above is reacted in the next reaction step with acid halides (III, III', III", III'") or with electrophilic compounds R3-Hai to the mono- or bisacylphosphane (I, 1', I", l").<br>
In addition, it is also possible to directly react the metallized phosphanide (V) or the mixture of (V) with the cyclic phosphanes (R1P)n, n &gt;= 3, with the acid halides (III, lll;,, III", III'") or with electrophilic compounds R3-Hal to the mono- or bisacylphosphane (I, l I", l").<br>
The solvents used may be, for example, the same as those used above for the first step. However, it is also possible to remove the solvent used in the first step by distillation and to take up the residue in another solvent and then to further process it. It is preferred to work in the same solvent as in the preceding step, preferably in xylene or toluene.<br>
It is possible to add polar or dipolar co-solvents to the reaction mixture during or after the reduction step. Such solvents may be linear or cyclic amides like dimethylacetamide (DMA), n-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), cyclic ureas like 1,3-dimethypropylene urea (DMPU), linear and cyclic glycols like diglyme and dimethoxyethane (DME).<br>
The reaction temperatures for the reaction with the acid halide are usefully in the range from -20° to+80°C .<br><br>
The mono- or bisacylphosphane of formula I can be isolated by the customary technological methods which are known to the skilled person, for example by filtration, evaporation or distillation. Likewise, the customary methods of purification may be used, for example crystallisation, distillation or chromatography.<br>
However, the phosphanes can also be reacted without isolation to the corresponding mono-or bisacylphosphane oxides or mono- or bisacylphosphane sulfides.<br>
Using the process of this invention it is also possible to prepare mono- and bisacyl-phosphanes together in one reaction step.<br>
Depending on the substituents used, unsymmetric compounds may be formed by the novel process.<br>
Monoacylphosphane oxides are compounds of the formula V corresponding to compounds of the formula I wherein n=1 and m=1.<br><br>
The residues Ri and R3 may be the same or may be different.<br>
Bisacylphosphane oxides are compounds of the formula I'" corresponding to compounds of the formula I wherein n=1 and m=2.<br><br>
The residues R2 and R2' may be the same or may be different.<br>
By means of the novel process it is furthermore also possible to prepare mixtures of aliphatic and aromatic monoacylphosphanes or mixtures of aliphatic and aromatic bisacylphosphanes.<br>
If required, all of the mixtures may be separated by the processes customarily used in the technology or they may be further used as they are.<br><br>
This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of mono- and bisacylphosphane oxides or mono- and bisacylphosphane sulfides. This process is first carried out as described above and a mono- or bisacylphosphane (I) is prepared. The crude reaction product (I) can then be further processed without purification and an additional reaction step may be carried out without isolation of the phosphane (I) using the solution of the crude product. If required, the solvent may be changed, for example, by concentrating the solution containing the mono-or bisacylphosphane and taking up the residue in a new solvent. Of course it is also possible to further react above-described unseparated mixtures of compounds of formula (I) to the corresponding oxide or sulfide.<br>
It is recommended to adjust the pH of the reaction mixture prior to the oxidation step to a PH of 2-8, preferabyl to a PH of 3-6 by addition of typical inorganic and/or organic acids or buffer systems.<br>
When preparing the respective oxide (IVa), the oxidation of the phosphane (I) is carried out using the oxidant conventionally used in the technology:<br><br>
Suitable oxidants are in particular hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxy compounds, for example peracetic acid or t-butylhydroperoxide, air or pure oxygen.<br>
The oxidation is usefully carried out in solution. Suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, m-xylene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene or mesitylene, or aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as alkanes and alkane mixtures, e.g. petroleum ether, hexane or cyclo-hexane.During oxidation, the reaction temperature is preferably kept in the range from 0°to 120°C, preferably from 20° and 80°C.<br>
The reaction products (IVa) can be isolated and purified by conventional processing methods known to the skilled person.<br><br><br>
The mono- or bisacylphosphanes (I) are in this case reacted in substance or, where appropriate, in a suitable inert organic solvent with an equinnolar to 2-fold molar amount of elementary sulfur. Suitable solvents are for example those described for the oxidation reaction. However, it is also possible to use e.g. aliphatic or aromatic ethers, such as dibutyl ether, dioxane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether or diphenyl ether, in the temperature range from 20° to 250°C, preferably from 60° to 120°C. The resulting mono- or bisacylphosphane sulfide, or its solution, is usefully freed from any remaining elementary sulfur by filtration. After the solvent is removed, the mono- or bisacylphosphane sulfide can be isolated by distillation, chromatography or recrystallisation in pure form.<br>
As mentioned above, it is also possible to use mixtures of compounds of formula I for the oxidation or reaction to the sulfide. The correspondingly obtained oxide or sulfide mixtures can either be separated by processes customarily used in the technology or may be used as mixtures.<br>
All of the above reactions are usefully carried out with exclusion of air in an inert gas atmosphere, e.g. under nitrogen or argon gas. The respective reaction mixture is usefully also<br>
stirred.<br>
The acid halides (III. Ill', III", III'") or the electrophilic compounds R3-Hal used as starting materials are known substances, some of which are commercially available, or may be prepared in analogy to known compounds.<br>
The preparation of the phosphorus halides (II) is also described in a great number of publications and can be carried out in analogy to the descriptions provided there. In J. Chem. Soc. (1935), 462 and J. Chem. Soc. (1944), 276, W. Davies discloses for example the preparation of aryl phosphorus chlorides by reaction of arylene with phosphorus trichloride in<br><br>
the presence of aluminum trichloride. According to F. Nief, Tetrahedron 47 (1991) 33, 667 or Th. Knapp, Tetrahedron 40(19 84) 4, 76, the Grignard reaction of aryl halides with magnesium and phosphorus trichloride is another possibility. According to S. Metzger, J. Org. Chem. 29 (1964), 627, alkylphosphorus chlorides are accessible in the same manner. In Helv. Chim, Act. 36 (1953), 1314, Th. Weil describes the reaction of aryl halides or alkyl halides with magnesium followed by the reaction with zinc chloride and subsequent reaction with phosphorus trichloride. The reaction of aryl halides with butyl lithium and phosphorus trichloride to the corresponding aryl phosphorus chloride is disclosed by G. Whitesides in JACS 96 (1974). 5398. According to Th. Knapp, Tetrahedron 40 (1984) 4, 765, the reaction of the aryl magnesium halide with bis(dimethylamino)phosphorus chloride followed by the reaction with hydrochloric acid also results in the desired starting material. According to A. Burg, US 2934564, the same method may also be used for the preparation of the corresponding alkyl phosphorus chlorides.<br>
It is characteristic of the novel process that the individual processing steps can be carried out directly one after the other without the need for isolating and purifying the respective intermediates.<br>
Mixtures such as those described in the process for the preparation of the corresponding phosphanes may also be formed, or may also be specifically produced, in the above-described process for the preparation of mono- or bisacylphosphane oxides or mono- or bis-acylphosphane sulfides. Such mixtures can be separated by methods known in the technology or may be further used in the form of mixtures.<br>
The phosphanes which are accessible by the novel process are important educts for the preparation of the corresponding phosphane oxides and phosphane sulfides. The phosphane oxides and phosphane sulfides are used in the art as initiators in photopolymerisation reactions.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention in more detail, although it is not intended that the invention be limited to the examples. As in the remaining description and in the patent claims, parts or percentages are by weight, unless othenrwise stated.<br><br>

a)	Metallation of P,P-dichloro-2,4-dipentoxyphenylphosphine in toluene at 98-110°C Excluding moisture by an argon atmosphere, sodium lumps (1.55 g, 67.6 mmol), three times washed with toluene, are suspended at room temperature in toluene (70 ml), together with potassium hydroxide (powdered) (0.1 g, 1.7 mmol). This mixture is heated up to reflux with vigorous stirring starting as soon as the temperature reaches 100°C. After formation of a fine sodium suspension, P,P-dichloro-2,4-dipentoxyphenylphosphine (6.6 g, 16.9 mmol) dissolved in 10 ml toluene is added dropwise over 3-4 h under vigorous stirring. Heating is continued under reflux for 1 h 40 min.<br>
b)	Protonation / reduction<br>
The resulting dark violet suspension is dropwise treated with 3-methyl-3-pentanol (3.48 g, 33.8 mmol) over 40 min at 95-110°C. Stirring is continued under reflux until all sodium is used up (24 h).<br>
c)	Acylation<br>
To the resulting gray suspension is added 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl chloride (1.59 g, 8.7 mmol). at such a rate that the temperature is kept at 35-40°C  (31P-NMR spectra shows no more signal for PhPH2). The mixture is then stirred for another 2 h 30 min at 35-40X. 2,6-Di-<br><br>
methoxybenzoyl chloride [1.94 g, 8.7 mmol; dissolved in toluene/tetrahydrofuran (5 ml / 1 ml)] is added at 35-40°C within 60 min and stirring is continued overnight at 35-40°C. The resulting reaction mixture is treated with an additional amount of 2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride [3.77 g, 16.9 mmol; dissolved in toluene/tetrahydrofuran (5 ml / 2 ml)] at 35-40°C within 30 min. Stirring is continued for nine hours at 35-40°C.<br>
d) Removal of tetrahydrofuran - oxidation using 30% H2O2 at 40-50°C To the resulting gray suspension is added 50 ml of toluene. Afterwards, 60 ml of solvent (tetrahydrofuran/toluene-mixture) are removed by distillation (100 mbar / 40-50°C). The gray/yellow suspension is diluted with a small amount of toluene (10 ml), and then dropwise treated with H2O (5 ml) at 50-60°C  within 5 min. Stirring is continued for 10 min at 50-60°C followed by the addition of 30% hydrogen peroxide (2.87 g, 25.4 mmol) at such a rate that the temperature is kept between 50-60°C . Stirring is continued for 40 min at 50-60°C. The reaction mixture is diluted with water, extracted once with 5% aqueous NaHCO3 and twice with water. Drying of the organic phase over Na2S04 and evaporation provides 9.3 g of a yellowish oil. Further purification by preparative liquid chromatography (heptane/ethyl acetate 80:20) yields 1.85 g (18%) of pure 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl-2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl-2,4-dipen-toxyphenylphosphine oxide as a yellow viscous oil. 31P-NMR(C6D6):5=15.7.<br>

Example 19 Preparation of bis(pivaloyl)phenylphosphine oxide.<br><br>
a) metallation of pentaphenylcyclopentaphosphane<br>
Excluding moisture by an argon atmosphere, sodium pieces (0.64 g, 30 mmol), (PPh)5 (1.5 g, 13.88 mmol relative to P) are heated under reflux in a mixture of toluene (50 ml) and of TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) (2 ml) until a yellow precipitate is formed.<br><br>
(PPh)5 has been prepared as described in the Int. Patent Application PCT/EP 03/50873 by suspending sodium pieces in a mixture of toluene / TMEDA and adding P,P-dichloro-phenylphosphane.<br>
b)	Protonation/reduction<br>
Excluding moisture by an argon atmosphere, tert-butanol (2.3 g, 2.2 eq.) is added at 100°C over 30 min leading to dissolution of the yellow precipitate. The resulting yellow suspension is further stirred under reflux until all sodium is used up.<br>
c)	Acylation and neutralisation of TMEDA<br>
Pivaloylchloride (3.68 g. 2.2 eq) is added dropwise under stirring. The reaction temperature is kept below 70°C  Concentrated H2SO4 (0.9 ml) is added dropwise at a temp, below 45°C .<br>
d)	Oxidation<br>
30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (4.3 ml, 42.1 mmol) is added dropwise under stirring at a<br>
temperature below 55°C . Stirring is continued at 40-50°C for one hour followed by the<br>
addition of water (10 ml). The organic phase is separated and washed twice with water and<br>
with 10% NaHCO3- The organic phase is dried over Na2S04. After evaporation and washing<br>
with hexane the title compound is obtained as a yellow solid (1.84 g, 45%).<br>
31P-NMR (CDCI3): 5 = 16.2 (t, 3JpH = 10.8 Hz).<br>
1H-NMR (CDCI3): 5 = 7.80 (m, 2 H, Ph H(2,6))H(2,6)) 7.57 (m, 1 H, Ph H47.48 (m, 2 H, Ph H(3,5);<br>
1.27(s, 18H,CH3).<br>
13C-NMR (CDCI3): 5 = 132,8 (d, 4JCP = 3.1 Hz, Ph O; 132.0 (d, 2JCP = 8.3 Hz, Ph C2,6); 128.7<br>
(d, 6Jcp = 11.4 Hz, Ph C35); 126.6 (d, 1Jcp = 79.2 Hz, Ph C^1; 25.6 (s, CH3).<br>
Comparative Example: ethanol vs. te/t-butanol as proton source in the protonation / reduction step.<br>
Step b) of Example 2 has been repeated using two equivalents (with regard to P) of ethanol instead of te/t-butanol. Gas develops heavily. Selectivity data are obtained by 31P-NMR. The 31p-NMR experiments were conducted on Bruker DPX-250 spectrometers.<br><br><br><br>
