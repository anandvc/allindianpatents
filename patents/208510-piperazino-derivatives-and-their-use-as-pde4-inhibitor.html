and the salts of these compounds.<br>
1-4C-Alkyl is a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples are the<br>
butyl,    isobutyl,    sec-butyl,    tert-butyl,    propyl,    isopropyl,    ethyl    and     methyl    radicals.<br>
l-4C-Alkoxy is a radical which, in addition to the oxygen atom, contains a straight-chain or branched<br><br><br>
alkyl radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Alkoxy radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms which may be mentioned in this context are, for example, the butoxy, isobutoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-butoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, ethoxy and methoxy radicals.<br>
l-8C-Alkoxy is a radical which, in addition to the oxygen atom, contains a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical having 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Aikoxy radicals having 1 to 8 carbon atoms which may be mentioned in this context are, for example, the octytoxy, heptyloxy, isoheptyloxy (5-methyihexyloxy), hexyloxy, isohexyloxy (4-methylpentyloxy), neohexyloxy (3,3-dimethylbutoxy), pentyloxy, isopentyloxy (3-methylbutoxy), neopentyloxy (2,2-dimethylpropoxy), butoxy, isobutoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-butoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, ethoxy and methoxy radicals. Halogen within the meaning of the present invention is bromine, chlorine or fluorine. 3-7C-Cycloalkoxy stands for cyclopropyloxy, cyclobutyloxy, cyclopentyloxy, cyclohexyloxy or cycloheptyloxy, of which cyclopropyloxy, cyclobutyloxy and cyclopentyloxy are preferred. 3-7C-Cycloalkylrmethoxy stands for cyclopropylmethoxy, cyclobutylmethoxy, cyclopentytmethoxy, cyclohexylmethoxy or cycloheptylmethoxy, of which cyclopropylmethoxy, cyclobutylmethoxy and cyclopentylmethoxy are preferred.<br>
3-5C-Cycloalkoxy stands for cyclopropytoxy, cyclobutyloxy and cyclopentyloxy. 3-5C-Cycloalkylmethoxy stands for cyclopropylmethoxy, cyclobutylmethoxy and cyclopentylmethoxy.<br>
l-4C-Alkoxy which is completely or predominantly substituted by fluorine is, for example, the 2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropoxy, the perfluoroethoxy, the 1,2,2-trifluoroethoxy and in particular the 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy, the 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy, the trifluoromethoxy and the difluoromethoxy radical, of which the difluoromethoxy radical is preferred. "Predominantly" in this connection means that more than half of the hydrogen atoms of the l-4C-alkoxy group are replaced by fluorine atoms. As spiro-linked 5-, 6- or 7-membered hydrocarbon rings, optionally interrupted by an oxygen or sulphur atom, may be mentioned the cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran and the tetrahydrothiophen ring.<br>
If Rl and R2 together form an additional bond, then the carbon atoms to which Rl and R2 are attached are linked to one another via a double bond.<br>
Suitable salts for compounds of the formula I-depending on substitution-are all acid addition salts or all salts with bases. Particular mention may be made of the pharmacologically tolerable inorganic and organic acids and bases customarily used in pharmacy. Those suitable are, on the one hand, water-soluble and water-insoluble acid addition salts with acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulphuric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, D-gluconic acid, benzoic acid, 2-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, butyric acid, sulphosalicylic acid, maleic acid, lauric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, embonic acid, stearic acid, toluenesulphonic  acid,   methanesulphonic  acid   or  3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic  acid,  the  acids  being<br><br><br>
employed in salt preparation-depending on whether a mono- or polybasic acid is concerned and<br>
depending on which salt is desired-in an equimolar quantitative ratio or one differing therefrom.<br>
On the other hand, salts with bases are-depending on substitution-also suitable. As examples of salts<br>
with bases are mentioned the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminium, magnesium, titanium,<br>
ammonium, meglumine or guanidinium salts, here, too, the bases being employed in salt preparation<br>
in an equimolar quantitative ratio or one differing therefrom.<br>
Pharmacologically intolerable salts, which can be obtained, for example, as process products during<br>
the preparation of the compounds according to the invention on an industrial scale, are converted<br>
into pharmacologically tolerable salts by processes known to the person skiiied in the art.<br>
According to expert's knowledge the compounds of the invention as well as their salts may contain,<br>
e.g. when isolated in crystalline form, varying amounts of solvents. Included within the scope of the<br>
invention are therefore all solvates and in particular all hydrates of the compounds of formula I as<br>

and the salts of these compounds.<br>
A special embodiment oi the compounds of the present invention include those compounds of<br>
formula I in which Rl and R2 together form an additional bond, R4 and R5 are l-2C-aIkoxy, R6 is<br>
methoxy, R7 is methyl, R8 is hydrogen and s is 1.<br>
Another special embodiment of the compounds of the present invention include those compounds of<br>
formula I in which Rl and R2 together form an additional bond, R3 represents a benzene derivative of<br>
formula (a), R4 and R5 are l-2C-alkoxy and s is 1.<br>
A further special embodiment of the compounds of the present invention include those compounds of<br>
formula I in which A is a bond and s is 1.<br>
Still another  special embodiment of the compounds  of  the present invention  include  those<br>
compounds of formula I in which Rl and R2 together form an additional bond, s is 1 and X is -C(O)-.<br>
Another further special embodiment of the compounds of the present invention include those<br>
compounds of formula I in which Rl and R2 together form an additional bond, s is 1 and R3<br>
represents a benzene derivative of formula (b), wherein R6 is methoxy.<br>
Yet another special embodiment of the compounds of the present invention include those compounds<br>
of formula I in which Rl and R2 together form an additional bond, s is 1, X is -C(O)- and R3<br>
represents a benzene derivative of formula (b), wherein R6 is methoxy, R7 is methyl and R8 is<br>
hydrogen.<br>
The compounds of formula 1 are chiral compounds. Chiral centers exist in the compounds of formula<br>
I in the positions 4a and 8a. In case R3 represents a benzene derivative of formula (b) there is one<br>
further chiral center in the dihydrofuran-ring, if the substituents -R7 and -CH2R8 are not identical.<br>
However, preferred are in this connection those compounds, In which the substituents -R7 and -<br><br><br>
CH2R8 are identical or together and with inclusion of the two carbon atoms to which they are bonded form a spiro-connected 5-, 6- or 7-membered hydrocarbon ring.<br><br><br>
Numbering:<br><br>
Therefore the invention includes all conceivable pure diastereomers and pure enantiomers of the compounds of formula I, as well as all mixtures thereof independent from the ratio, including the racemates. Preferred are those compounds of formula I, in which the hydrogen atoms in the positions 4a and 8a are cis-configurated. Especially preferred in this connection are those compounds, in which the absolute configuration (according to the rules of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog) is S in the position 4a and R in the position 8a.<br>
Racemates can be split up into the corresponding enantiomers by methods known by a person skilled in the art. Preferably the racemic mixtures are separated into two diastereomers during the preparation with the help of an optical active separation agent on the stage of the cyclohexanecarboxylic acids or the 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrobenzoic acids (for example, starting compounds A8, A9 and A10). As separation agents may be mentioned, for example, optical active amines such as the (+)- and (-) forms of l-phenylethylamine [(R)-(+)-l-phenylethylamine=D-[aIpha]-methylbenzylamine or (S)-(-)-l-phenylethylamine=L-[alpha]-methylbenzylamine) and ephedrine, the optical active alkaloids quinine, cinchonine, cinchonidine and brucine.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be prepared, for example, as described in Reaction scheme 1.<br><br><br>
Reaction scheme 1 shows exemplarily the preparation of (4aS, 8aR)-configurated compounds of formula I. The (4aR, 8aS)-configurated compounds of formula I can be prepared analogously using in the first reaction step the antipodes of the optical amines shown in reaction scheme 1. [0171] Starring from racemic (cis)-keto-l,2,3,4,5/6-hexahydrobenzoic- or racemic (cis)-keto-l,2,3,6-tetrahydrobenzoic acids of formula VI the two cis configurated enantiomeres are separated in form of<br><br>
their diastereomeric salts (compounds of formula V) with optical active amines such as the(+)- and (-)<br>
-forms of l-phenylethylamine [(R)-(+)-l-phenyIethylamine=D-[aIpha]-methyIbenzylamine or (S)-(-)-l-<br>
phenylethylamine=L-[alpha]-methylbenzylamine), ephedrine, the optical active alkaloids quinine,<br>
cinchonine, cinchonidine and brucine.<br>
In a second reaction step the compounds of formula V are condensed with 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid<br>
or 4-hydrazino benzene sulfonic acid to give the compounds of formula III, in which A represents a<br>
bond. Alternatively, the compounds of formula V are first reacted with hydrazine to give the<br>
compounds   of  formula   IV   which   then   are   reacted   with  4-chloromethylbenzoic   acid   or  4-<br>
chloromethylbenzene sulfonic acid to give the compounds of formula 111, in which A represents<br>
methylene (-CH2-).<br>
The   compounds   of   formula   III   are   activated   by   a   chlorination   agent   like,   for   example,<br>
phosphorpentachloride (-&gt; compounds of formula II) or alternative by a suitable carbodiimide like,<br>
for example, DCC or EDC, and then are converted with a piperazine substituted by R9 (or a<br>
homopiperazine substituted by R9) to give the compounds of formula I.<br>
Suitably, the conversions are carried out analogous to methods which are familiar per se to the person<br>
skilled in the art, for example, in the manner which is described in the following examples.<br>
The substances according to the invention are isolated and purified in a manner known per se, e.g. by<br>
distilling off the solvent in vacuo and recrystallising the residue obtained from a suitable solvent or<br>
subjecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as column chromatography on a<br>
suitable support material.<br>
Salts are obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent (for example a ketone like<br>
acetone, methylethylketone, or methylisobutylketone, an ether, like diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or<br>
dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or a low molecular<br>
weight aliphatic alcohol, such as ethanol, isopropanol) which contains the desired acid, or to which<br>
the desired acid is then added. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a<br>
non-solvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted by<br>
basification into the free compounds which, in turn, can be converted into salts. In this manner,<br>
pharmacologically non-tolerable salts can be converted into pharmacologically tolerable salts.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention in greater detail, without restricting it. As well,<br>
further compounds of formula I, of which the preparation is explicitly not described, can be prepared<br>
in an analogous way or in a way which is known by a person skilled in the art using customary<br>
preparation methods.<br>
The compounds, which are mentioned in the examples as well as their salts are preferred compounds<br>
of the invention.<br>

Prepared as described in W099/31090. Commercial Utility<br>
The compounds according to the invention have useful pharmacological properties which make them industrially utilizable. As selective cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (specifically of type 4), they are suitable on the one hand as bronchial therapeutics (for the treatment of airway obstructions on account of their dilating action but also on account of their respiratory rate- or respiratory drive-increasing action) and for the removal of erectile dysfunction on account of their vascular dilating action, but on the other hand especially for the treatment of disorders, in particular of an inflammatory nature, e.g. of the airways (asthma prophylaxis), of the skin, of the intestine, of the eyes, of the CNS and of the joints, which are mediated by mediators such as histamine, PAF (platelet-activating factor), arachidonic acid derivatives such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins, cytokines, interleukins, chemokines, alpha-, beta- and gamma-interferon, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or oxygen free radicals and proteases. In this context, the compounds according to the invention are distinguished by a low toxicity, a good enteral absorption (high bioavailability), a large therapeutic breadth and the absence of significant side effects.<br><br><br>
On account of their PDE-inhibiting properties, the compounds according to the invention can be employed in human and veterinary medicine as therapeutics, where they can be used, for example, for the treatment and prophylaxis of the following illnesses: acute and chronic (in particular inflammatory and allergen-induced) airway disorders of varying origin (bronchitis, allergic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, emphysema, COPD); dermatoses (especially of proliferative, inflammatory and allergic type) such as psoriasis (vulgaris), toxic and allergic contact eczema, atopic eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, Lichen simplex, sunburn, pruritus in the anogenital area, alopecia areata, hypertrophic scars, discoid lupus erythematosus, follicular and widespread pyodermias, endogenous and exogenous acne, acne rosacea and other proliferative, inflammatory and allergic skin disorders; disorders which are based on an excessive release of TNF and leukotrienes, for example disorders of the arthritis type (rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis and other arthritic conditions), disorders of the immune system (AIDS, multiple sclerosis), graft versus host reaction, allograft rejections, types of shock (septic shock, endotoxin shock, gram-negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome and ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome)) and also generalized inflammations in the gastrointestinal region (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis); disorders which are based on allergic and/or chronic, immunological false reactions in the region of the upper airways (pharynx, nose) and the adjacent regions (paranasal sinuses, eyes), such as allergic rhinitis/sinusitis, chronic rhinitis/sinusitis, allergic conjunctivitis and also nasal polyps; but also disorders of the heart which can be treated by PDE inhibitors, such as cardiac insufficiency, or disorders which can be treated on account of the tissue-relaxant action of the PDE inhibitors, such as, for example, erectile dysfunction or colics of the kidneys and of the ureters in connection with kidney stones. In addition, the compounds of the invention are useful in the treatment of diabetes insipidus and conditions associated with cerebral metabolic inhibition, such as cerebral senility, senile dementia (Alzheimer's disease), memory impairment associated with Parkinson's disease or multiinfarct dementia; and also illnesses of the central nervous system, such as depressions or arteriosclerotic dementia. The invention further relates to a method for the treatment of mammals, including humans, which are suffering from one of the abovementioned illnesses. The method is characterized in that a therapeutically active and pharmacologically effective and tolerable amount of one or more of the compounds according to the invention is administered to the ill mammal.<br>
The invention further relates to the compounds according to the invention for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of illnesses, especially the illnesses mentioned.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the compounds according to the invention for the production of medicaments which are employed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the illnesses mentioned. The invention furthermore relates to medicaments for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the illnesses mentioned, which contain one or more of the compounds according to the invention. Additionally, the invention relates to an article of manufacture, which comprises packaging material and a pharmaceutical agent contained within said packaging material, wherein the pharmaceutical<br><br><br>
agent   is   therapeutically   effective   for   antagonizing   the   effects   of   the   cyclic   nucleotide<br>
phosphodiesterase of type 4 (PDE4), ameliorating the symptoms of an PDE4-mediated disorder, and<br>
wherein the packaging material comprises a label or package insert which indicates that the<br>
pharmaceutical agent is useful for preventing or treating PDE4-mediated disorders, and wherein said<br>
pharmaceutical agent comprises one or more compounds of formula I according to the invention. The<br>
packaging material, label and package insert otherwise parallel or resemble what is generally<br>
regarded as standard packaging material, labels and package inserts for pharmaceuticals having<br>
related utilities.<br>
The medicaments are prepared by processes which are known per se and familiar to the person<br>
skilled in the art. As medicaments, the compounds according to the invention (=active compounds)<br>
are either employed as such, or preferably in combination with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries<br>
and/or excipients, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, caplets, suppositories, patches<br>
(e.g. as TTS), emulsions, suspensions, gels or solutions, the active compound content advantageously<br>
being between 0.1 and 95% and where, by the appropriate choice of the auxiliaries and/or excipients,<br>
a pharmaceutical administration form (e.g. a delayed release form or an enteric form) exactly suited to<br>
the active compound and/or to the desired onset of action can be achieved.<br>
The person skilled in the art is familiar with auxiliaries or excipients which are suitable for the desired<br>
pharmaceutical formulations on account of his/her expert knowledge. In addition to solvents, gel<br>
formers, ointment bases and other active compound excipients, for example antioxidants, dispersants,<br>
emulsifiers, preservatives, solubilizers, colorants, complexing agents or permeation promoters, can be<br>
used.<br>
The administration of the medicaments according to the invention may be performed in any of the<br>
generally accepted modes of administration available in the art. Illustrative examples of suitable<br>
modes of administration include intravenous, oral, nasal, parenteral, topical, transdermal and rectal<br>
delivery. Oral and intravenous delivery are preferred.<br>
For the treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, the compounds according to the invention are<br>
preferably also administered by inhalation in the form of an aerosol; the aerosol particles of solid,<br>
liquid or mixed composition preferably having a diameter of 0.5 to 10 [mu]m, advantagously of 2 to 6<br>
[mu]m.<br>
Aerosol generation can be carried out, for example, by pressure-driven jet atomizers or ultrasonic<br>
atomizers,    but   advantageously    by    propellant-driven    metered    aerosols    or    propellant-free<br>
administration of micronized active compounds from inhalation capsules.<br>
Depending on the inhaler system used, in addition to the active compounds the administration forms<br>
additionally contain the required excipients, such as, for example, propellants (e.g. Frigen in the case<br>
of metered aerosols), surface-active substances, emulsifiers, stabilizers, preservatives, flavorings,<br>
fillers (e.g. lactose in the case of powder inhalers) or, if appropriate, further active compounds.<br><br><br>
For the purposes of inhalation, a large number of apparatuses are available with which aerosols of optimum particle size can be generated and administered, using an inhalation technique which is as right as possible for the patient. In addition to the use of adaptors (spacers, expanders) and pear-shaped containers (e.g. Nebulatorg, Volumatic(R)), and automatic devices emitting a puffer spray (Autohaler(R)), for metered aerosols, in particular in the case of powder inhalers, a number of technical solutions are available (e.g. Diskhaler(R), Rotadisk(R), TurbohalerS or the inhaler described in European Patent Application EP 0 505 321), using which an optimal administration of active compound can be achieved.<br>
For the treatment of dermatoses, the compounds according to the invention are in particular administered in the form of those medicaments which are suitable for topical application. For the production of the medicaments, the compounds according to the invention (=active compounds) are preferably mixed with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries and further processed to give suitable pharmaceutical formulations. Suitable pharmaceutical formulations are, for example, powders, emulsions, suspensions, sprays, oils, ointments, fatty ointments, creams, pastes, gels or solutions. The medicaments according to the invention are prepared by processes known per se. The dosage of the active compounds is carried out in the order of magnitude customary for PDE inhibitors. Topical application forms (such as ointments) for the treatment of dermatoses thus contain the active compounds in a concentration of, for example, 0.1-99%. The dose for administration by inhalation is customarly between 0.1 and 3 mg per day. The customary dose in the case of systemic therapy (p.o. or i.v.) is between 0.03 and 3 mg/kg per day. Biological Investigations<br>
The second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) is well-known for inhibiting inflammatory and immunocompetent cells. The PDE4 isoenzyme is broadly expressed in cells involved in the initiation and propagation of inflammatory diseases (H Tenor and C Schudt, in "Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors", 2140, "The Handbook of Immunopharmacology", Academic Press, 1996), and its inhibition leads to an increase of the intracellular cAMP concentration and thus to the inhibition of cellular activation (J E Souness et al., Immunopharmacology 47:127-162, 2000).<br>
The antiinflammatory potential of PDE4 inhibitors in vivo in various animal models has been described (M M Teixeira, TiPS 18: 164-170, 1997). For the investigation of PDE4 inhibition on the cellular level (in vitro), a large variety of proinflammatory responses can be measured. Examples are the superoxide production of neutrophilic (C Schudt et al., Arch Pharmacol 344: 682-690, 1991) or eosinophilic (A Hatzelmann et al., Brit ] Pharmacol 114: 821-831, 1995) granulocytes, which can be measured as luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence, or the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] in monocytes, macrophages or dendritic cells (Gantner et al., Brit J Pharmacol 121: 221-231,1997, and Pulmonary Pharmacol Therap 12: 377-386, 1999). In addition, the immunomodulatory potential of PDE4 inhibitors is evident from the inhibition of T-cell responses like cytokine synthesis or proliferation (D M Essay an, Biochem Pharmacol 57: 965-973, 1999). Substances which inhibit the<br><br><br>
secretion of the afore-mentioned proinflammatory mediators are those which inhibittPDE4. PDE4 inhibition by the compounds according to the invention is thus a central indicator for the suppression of inflammatory processes.<br>
Method for Measuring Inhibition of PDE4 Activity<br>
PDE4 activity was determined as described by Thompson et al, (Adv Cycl NucI Res 10: 69-92,1979) with some modifications (Bauer and Schwabe, Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharnacol 311: 193-198, 1980). At a final assay volume of 200 [mu]l (96well microtiter plates) the assay mixture contained 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgC12, 0.5 pM cAMP, [ H]cAMP (about 30,000 cpm/assay), the test compound and an aliquot of cytosol from human neutrophils which mainly contains PDE4 activity as described by Schudt et al. (Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol 344: 682-690, 1991); the PDE3-specific inhibitor Motapizone (1 [mu]M) was included to suppress PDE3 activity originating from contaminating platelets. Serial dilutions of the compounds were prepared in DMSO and further diluted 1:100 (v/v) in the assays to obtain the desired final concentrations of the inhibitors at a DMSO concentration of 1% (v/v) which by itself only slightly affected PDE4 activity.<br>
After preincubation for 5 min at 37[deg.] C, the reaction was started by the addition of substrate (cAMP) and the assays were incubated for further 15 min at 37[deg.] C. 50 [mu]l of 0.2 N HC1 was added to stop the reaction and the assays were left on ice for about 10 min. Following incubation with 25 [mu]g 5'-nucleotidase (Crotalus atrox snake venom) for 10 min at 37[deg.] C, the assays were loaded on QAE Sephadex A-25 (1 ml bed volume). The columns were eluted with 2 ml of 30 mM ammonium formiate (pH 6.0) and the eluate was counted for radioactivity. Results were corrected for blank values (measured in the presence of denatured protein) which were below 5% of total radioactivity. The amount of cyclic nucleotides hydrolyzed did not exceed 30 % of the original substrate concentration. The IC50 -values for the compounds according to the invention for the inhibition of the PDE4 activity were determined from the concentration-inhibition curves by nonlinear-regression.<br>
For the following compounds inhibitory values [measured as -loglC50 (mol/1)] higher than 9 were determined. The numbers of the compounds correspond to the numbers of the examples. Compounds 8-15 and 18-29<br><br><br><br>
