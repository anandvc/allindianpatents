Compounds of formula I are useful as lipid modulators and insulin sensitizers. In particular, compounds of formula I are PPAR activators.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. The PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate gene expression and control multiple metabolic pathways. Three subtypes have<br>
pathways. Three subtypes have<br><br>
been described which are PPARa, PPAR8 (also known as PPAR|3), and PPARy. PPAR6 is ubiquitously expressed. PPARa is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidney and heart. There are at least two major isoforms of PPARy. PPARyl is expressed in most tissues, and the longer isoform, PPARy2 is almost exclusively expressed in adipose tissue. The PPARs modulate a variety of physiological responses including regulation of glucose- and lipid- homeostasis and metabolism, energy balance, cell differentiation, inllammation and cardiovascular events.<br>
Approximately half of all patients with coronary artery disease have low concentrations of plasma HDL cholesterol. The atheroprotective function of HDL was llrst highlighted almost 25 years ago and stimulated exploration of the genetic and environmental factors that influence HDL levels. The protective function of HDL comes from its role in a process termed reverse cholesterol transport. HDL mediates the removal of cholesterol from cells in peripheral tissues including those in the atherosclerotic lesions of the arterial wall. HDL then delivers its cholesterol to the liver and sterol-mctaboli/ing organs for conversion to bile and elimination. Data from the I ramingham study showed that HDL-C levels are predictive of coronary artery disease risk independently of LDL-C levels. The estimated age-adjusted prevalence among Americans age 20 and older who have HDL-C of less than 35 mg/dl is 16% (males) and 5.7% (females). A substantial increase of HDL-C is currently achieved by treatment with niacin in various formulations. However, the substantial side-effects limit the therapeutic potential of this approach.<br>
As many as 90% of the 14 million diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients in the US are overweight or obese, and a high proportion of type 2 diabetic patients have abnormal concentrations of lipoproteins. The prevalence of total cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dl is 37% in diabetic men and 44% in women. The respective rates for LDL-C &gt; 160 mg/dl are 31% and 44%, respectively, and for HDL-C 
 <br>
associated   with   multiple  comorbidities   including   insulin   resistance,   dyslipidemia, hypertension, cndothelial dysfunction and inflammatory atherosclerosis.<br>
First line treatment for dyslipidemia and diabetes generally involves a low-fat and low-glucose diet, exercise and weight loss. However, compliance can be moderate, and as the disease progresses, treatment of the various metabolic deficiencies becomes necessary with e.g. lipid-modulating agents such as statins and fibrates for dyslipidemia and hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas or metformin for insulin resistance. A promising new class of drugs has recently been introduced that resensitizes patients to their own insulin (insulin sensitizers), thereby restoring blood glucose and triglyceride levels to normal, and in many cases, obviating or reducing the requirement for exogenous insulin. Pioglitazone (ActosIM) and rosiglitazone (AvandiaIM) belong to the thia/olidincdionc (T/D) class of PPARy-agonists and were the first in their class to be approved for NIDDM in several countries. These compounds, however, suffer from side effects, including rare but severe liver toxicily (as seen with troglitazone). They also increase body weight in patients. Therefore, new, more efficacious drugs with greater safely and lower side effects are urgently needed. Recent studies provide evidence that agonism of PPAR8 would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, i. c. such compounds should improve the lipid profile, with a superior effect on HDL-C raising compared to current treatments and with additional positive effects on normali/ation of insulin-levels (Oliver et al; Proc Nat Acad Sci USA 2001; 98: 5306-11). Recent observations also suggest that there is a independent PPARa mediated effect on insulin-sensit/ation in addition to its well known role in reducing triglycerides (Guerre-Millo el al; .1 Biol Chem 2000; 275: 16638-16642). Thus selective PPAR8 agonists or PPAR8 agonists with additional PPARa activity may show superior therapeutic efficacy without the side-effects such as the weight gain seen with PPARy agonists.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention exceed the compounds known in the art. inasmuch as they bind to and selectively activate PPAR8 or coactivate PPAR8 and PPARa simultaneously and very efficiently, and with much improved pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, these compounds combine the anti-dyslipidemic and anti-glycemic effects of PPAR8 and PPARa activation with no effect on PPARy. Consequently, HDL cholesterol is increased, triglycerides lowered (= improved lipid profile) and plasma glucose and insulin arc reduced (= insulin sensitization). In addition, such compounds may also lower IT)L cholesterol, decrease blood pressure and counteract inflammatory atherosclerosis. Furthermore, such compounds may also be useful for treating inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and psoriasis. Since<br><br>
multiple facets of combined dyslipidemia and the T2D disease syndrome are addressed by PPAR5 selective agonists and PPAR8 and oc coagonists, they are expected to have an enhanced therapeutic potential compared to the compounds already known in the art.<br>
Object of the present invention therefore is to provide compounds which must have the criteria mentioned above. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention exhibit improved pharmacological properties compared to known compounds.<br>

Nitro-phcnols 2 of scheme 2 are commercial available, or known or can be synlhesi/cd from anisols 3 by demethylation with aqueous 62% HBr in acetic acid between RT and 120 °C (step b). Alternatively, phenols 1 can be nitrated in para-position according to well established methods, e. g. with a solution of NaNCh in water/concentrated hydrochloric acid in a solvent like Et^O, followed by the addition of acetic acid anhydride at RT [following a procedure of P. Keller, Bull. Soc. Fr. 1994, 131, 27-29] leading to phenols 2 (step a). Nitro-phenols 2 are then hydrogenated in an alcohol like KtOH or MeOH with hydrogen in the presence of Pd/C and optionally an acid like MCI or AeOll at RT to give anilines 4 (step c). Intermediates 4 are then alkylated at oxygen with an activated ester compound 5, e.g. a bromo-acetate 5, in the presence of KnCOi or CsjCO; in a solvent like acetonitrile or acetone between 10 °C and RT to give intermediates 6 of scheme 2 (step d).

Alternatively, heterocycles 11 with RI4=OH can be transformed in situ to the coresponding triflate by treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride/2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine in CH2CI2 at 0 °C. This triflate is then reacted with anilines 10 in the presence of 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridinc as base in nitromethane between RT and 60 °C to yield compounds Ic (following a procedure of Belostotskii, Anatoly M., Hassner, A., Tetrahedron Lett. 1994, 35(28), 5075-6| (step k).

The preparation of compounds 3 with p=0 has been described in scheme 2 and 3 (compounds 6, scheme 2, and compounds 10, scheme 3). Compounds 3 with p = 2 can be prepared from compounds 2 in a two step procedure: i) treatment with nitro-methane and ammonium acetate in acetic acid at a temperature around 110 °C to form the corresponding nitro styrenc compounds; ii) hydrogenation with palladium on charcoal in the presence of a strong acid like sulfuric acid or hydrogen chloride in solvents like ethanol or acetic acid and in a temperature range between room temperature and 100 °C. In order to introduce an R9 substituent into compounds 3, BOC-protection followed by alkylation and subsequent removal of the BOC group can be performed similarly as described in schemes 2 and 3. Compounds 4 with p = 0 can be prepared from compounds 2 by standard procedures of oxidation of an aromatic aldehyde to an aromatic acid (e. g. with sodium chlorite, sodium dihydrogen-phosphate in a mixture of tert butanol and water and in the presence of 3-methyl-2-butene at temperatures around room temperature). Compounds 4 with p = 1 can be prepared from compounds 2 by a Wittig reaction using (methoxymethyl)-triphenylphosphonium chloride as reagent, treatment of the Wittig product with acid and oxidation of the aldehyde formed to the corresponding acid.

Removal of the benzylic hydroxy group in compounds 5 can be performed with a reducing agent like e. g. triethylsilane in Ihc presence of a Lewis acid, like boron-trifluoride, or a protic acid, like trifluoroacetic acid, in a suitable solvent like trifluoroacetic acid itself or dichloromethane between 0 °C and 60 °C to yield protected phenol compounds 6 (step d). Subsequent removal of the protecting group, e. g. a benzyl group, by standard technology, e. g. catalytic hydrogenation using hydrogen and a catalyst like palladium or by using dimethyl sulfide and boron tri fluoride diethyl etherate in a solvent like dichloromethane between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent gives phenolic compounds 7 (step g). Catalytic hydrogenation can be used to transform unsaturated esters 3 into compounds 6 (step f)- 'n case the protective group in compounds 3 is a benzyl group, then a one step hydrogenation procedure directly gives phenolic compounds 7. Catalytic hydrogenation can also be used for the simultaneous removal of the benzylic hydroxy function and a benzyl protecting group, preferably using palladium on charcoal as catalyst in the presence of an acid like oxalic acid in solvents like alcohols at temperatures around room temperature and a hydrogen pressure up to 100 bar, thus giving the transformation of compounds 5 into compounds 7 in one step (step d and g).<br>

Ksters 3 can be hydrolyzed (alkali hydroxide in solvents like THF, dioxane or DMSO) to give acids 4 (step b). A Curtius rearrangement can be used to transform acids 4 into the analogous BOC-protected anilines: first, the acid chlorides are synthesi/ed with e.g. oxalyl chloride/DMF in dichloromethane. Then, reaction with sodium a/ide in DMF/ dichloromethane followed by heating to reflux in the presence of 2-methyl-2-propanol gives the BOC protected anilines.

Thiocyanato phenols 1 which are known or can be prepared as discussed before (page 41-42) can be hydrolyzed with NaOH in water at room temperature to reflux temperature and oxidi/ed in DMSO at higher temperature, preferably around 95 °C to the dithiols 2 (step a). Thiophenols 1 described before can be oxidized to the dithiols 2 as well (step a). Reaction of phenols 2 with alpha halo esters or triflates of formula 3 in the presence of a base like potassium or cesium carbonate in solvents like acetone, methyl-ethyl ketone, acetonitrile or N,N-dimethylformamide in a temperature range between room temperature and 100 °C leads to the corresponding ether compounds 4 (step b).

Heterocycles 6 (prepared as outlined in schemes 8 to 11) are condensed with thiophenols 5 (R1' H) according to well known procedures (step d): if R13 represents a hydroxy group e. g. via Mitsunohu-reaclion, with triphenylphosphine and di-tert-butyl-, diisopropyl- or diethyl-azodicarboxylate as reagents; this transformation is preferably carried out in a solvent like toluene, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature. Alternatively, if R13 represents a halide, mesylate or tosylate, heterocycles 6 can be reacted with S-acetyl protected 5 (R15 = Ac) in solvents like N,N-dimelhylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, acetone or methyl-ethyl ketone in the presence of mclhanol and a weak base like cesium or potassium carbonate at a temperature ranging from 0 °C to 140 °C, preferably around room temperature to yield ether compounds Ir (step d). Heterocycles 6 with RI3=OH can also be transformed in .situ to the corcsponding inflates by treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride/2,6-di-terl-butylpyridine in Cf^Cb at 0 °C to room temperature. The Inflates are then reacted with thiophenols 5 (R15 = H) in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, acetone or methyl-ethyl ketone in the presence of a weak base like cesium or potassium carbonate at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 140 °C, preferably around 50 °C to yield ether compounds Ir (step d). Esters of formula Ir can optionally be hydrolyzed according to standard procedures, e. g. by treatment with an alkali hydroxide like LiOH or NaOH in a polar solvent mixture like tetrahydrofuran/ethanol/water leading to carboxylic acids Ir.<br>

Compounds of the general formula I with X1 = S can be prepared from the appropriate thiophenol precursors which themselves can be obtained by converting suitable phenol intermediates into the corresponding thiophenols applying methods described above.<br>
Compounds of the general formula I can contain one or more stereocenters and can optionally be separated into optically pure enantiomers or diastereomers by methods well known in the art, e. g. by HPLC chromatography, chromatography on a chiral HPLC column, chromatography with a chiral eluant or by derivatization with an optically pure alcohol to form esters, which can be separated by conventional HPLC chromatography and then converted back to the enantiomerically pure acids I (R1 = H). In addition, racemic compounds can be separated into their antipodes via diastereomeric salts by crystalli/ation with optically pure amines such as e. g. (R) or (S)-l-phenyl-ethylamine, (R) or (S)-l-naphthalen-l-yl-ethylamine, brucine, quinine or quinidine.<br>

Full-length cl)NA clones for humans PPAR8 and PPARa and mouse PPARy were obtained by RT-PCR from human adipose and mouse liver cRNA, respectively, cloned into plasmid vectors and verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial and mammalian expression vectors were constructed to produce glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and Gal4 DNA binding domain proteins fused to the ligand binding domains (LBD) of PPAR5 (aa 139 to 442), PPARy (aa 174 to 476) and PPARa (aa 167 to 469).

Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br><br>
