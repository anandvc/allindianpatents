This invention relates to processes for the preparation of heterocyclic hydroxyamines and to novel substituted heterocycles and catalysts.<br>
Heterocyclic hydroxyamines are important intermediates in the synthesis of many Pharmaceuticals. For example Duloxetine ((+)-N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-2-thiophenepropanamine), a 5-HT and norepinephrine uptake inhibitor, is showing considerable promise as a potential treatment for depression and urinary incontinenance (US 5,023,269, US 4,956,388 and for a review see Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs (PharmaPress Ltd.)

Example 1<br>
Stage 1<br>
Preparation of ethvl-3-oxo 3-(2-thiophenvl) propanoate<br>
Sodium hydride (60% dispersion in mineral oil, 100g, 2.5 mol) was washed with anhydrous hexane (2 x 250 ml) under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) (340 ml) was then added with stirring followed by 2-acetyl thiophene (136 ml, 1.25 mol) in anhydrous THF (340 ml) over period of 20 minutes. The reaction mixture was then warmed to 35°C. After 30 minutes diethyl carbonate (305.5 ml, 2.5 mol) in anhydrous THF (660 ml) was added over a period of 1 hour. After an additional hour the reaction mixture was cooled to -10°C, quenched with water (475 ml) and glacial acetic acid (145 ml) was added. The mixture was stirred for 20 minutes and then warmed to room temperature. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 200 ml). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine (2 x 200 ml), dried with Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the title compound as a crude dark orange oil in 98% yield (242.8g).<br>
Stage 2<br>
Preparation of ethyl-3-(S)-hydroxv 3-(2-thiophenvl) propanoate<br>
QH    o<br>
oet<br>
Rhodium pentamethylcyclopentadiene dichloride dimer (1.8705 g, 0.0030 mol) and (S)-N-camphorsulphonyl-(S,S)-diphenylethylenediamine (2.582 g, 0.0061 mol) were stirred in THF (378.5 ml) at 0°C under nitrogen to form a catalytic solution.<br>
Ethyl-3-oxo 3-(2-thiophenyl) propanoate (300 g, 1.513 mol, from stage 1) was stirred in THF (378.5 ml) at 10°C and sparged with nitrogen at a rate of 1.2 Lmin"1. A portion of the catalytic solution (78.5 ml) was added, and a mixture of formic acid and triethylamine in a molar ratio of 5:2 (327.1 g) was charged at a rate of 52.1 mlhr"1. Further portions of the catalytic solution (75 ml) were added every 1.5 hr. After the reaction had been shown to have gone to completion by GC, after about 24 hours, saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (1 L) was added at room temperature to quench the reaction. The aqueous layer was extracted with toluene (400 ml). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (400 ml, 10 % w/w solution) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The organic solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to give a dark brown oil in 97.5% yield (295.4 g).<br>
Stage 3<br>
Preparation of 3-(S)-hvdroxv-N-methvl 3-(2-thiophenvl) propanamide<br>
Ethyl-3-(S)-hydroxy 3-(2-thiophenyl) propanoate (270 g, from stage 2) was dissolved in toluene (675 ml). To this, an aqueous methylamine solution (675 ml, 40 % w/w) was added with stirring over a period of 15 minutes at room temperature. Once the reaction had gone to completion after 1 hour, agitation was ceased and the organic layer was separated from the aqueous layer. Salt (100 g) was added to the aqueous layer which was then extracted with isopropyl acetate (2x500 ml). The organic extracts and the original organic layer were combined. Silica (250 g) was added and the resulting suspension was stirred for 20 minutes. The mixture was filtered and silica (250 g) was again added and the mixture was stirred for 20 minutes before being filtered. The resulting solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to give orange crystals (90.5 g, 36 %) as the product.<br>
Stage 4<br>
Preparation of (S)-3-(N-methyl) amino 1-(2-thiophenvl) propan-1-ol<br>
3-(S)-Hydroxy-N-methyl 3-(2-thiophenyl) propanamide (80g) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (320ml) under nitrogen with stirring. A solution of lithium aluminium hydride (648ml, 1 M) in THF was added at rate that kept the temperature constant at 50°C. When all the lithium aluminium hydride solution had been added the reaction mixture was held at 50°C for 50 minutes. The mixture was then cooled to -10°C and isopropanol (100 ml) was slowly added. A saturated sodium sulphate solution (310 ml) was then added and the mixture was filtered. The filter residues were washed with ethyl acetate (2x100 ml) and the aqueous layer was separated. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine (2x100 ml) and then dried over sodium sulphate. The organic solution was then concentrated under reduced pressure to give a dark orange oil (65 g, 88 %). Solvating the oil in toluene and stirring at 0°C overnight gave crystals as the final product that were filtered and dried on the filter.<br>
