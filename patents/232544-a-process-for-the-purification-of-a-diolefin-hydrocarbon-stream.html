				<td>"A PROCESS FOR THE PURIFICATION OF A DIOLEFIN HYDROCARBON STREAM"<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The field of art to which this invention pertains is the purification of a diolefin hydrocarbon stream containing trace quantities of acetylene compounds. The production of diolefins is well known and widely practiced to produce a wide variety of products and precursor products utilizing a variety of diolefin production processes including naphtha cracking processes and by-products from fluid catalytic cracking processes. Most of these diolefin production processes produce undesirable trace quantities of acetylene. One technique which is used to purify diolefin streams selectively hydroqenates the acetylene while minimizing the destruction or hydrogenation of the diolefin compounds.<br>
The selective hydrogenation of the acetylene compounds is generally conducted in the presence of a selective hydrogenation catalyst and hydrogen and conducted at an elevated pressure and temperature. Such selective hydrogenation catalysts are well known in the art and include, for example, a catalyst containing copper metal associated with one or more activator metals impregnated on an alumina support. During the acetylene hydrogenation polymers are formed and deposited on the catalyst thereby reducing the activity of the catalyst. One known method of regenerating spent or partially spent catalyst is to perform a controlled carbon burn and subsequent metal reduction to remove catalyst contaminants which are formed as an undesirable by-product of the acetylene hydrogenation. The carbon burn regeneration techniques necessarily require that the reaction zone containing the spent catalyst be taken off-line and that ancillary regeneration equipment be provided.<br>
INFORMATION DISCLOSURE<br>
US-A-3,634,536 discloses a process for selectively hydrogenating acetylenic impurities in an isopropene- or butadiene-containing stream whereby carbon monoxide is utilized during hydrogenation over a copper-based catalyst.<br>
US-A-4,440,956 discloses a catalyst for the removal of acetylenes from liquid hydrocarbon streams with a minimum loss of diolefinic unsaturation present in the liquid composition.<br>
Although a wide variety of process flow schemes, operating conditions and catalysts have been used in commercial activities, there is always a demand for new selective hydrotreating processes which provide lower costs, higher selectivity and longer on-stream operation.<br>
The present invention continuously maintains the high activity of the selective hydrogenation catalyst during an extended run length without shutdown for catalyst regeneration. Higher average product quality when<br>
integrated   over   time   on-stream   improves   the   process   economics   and demonstrates the unexpected advantages.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention is a seiective acatylene ,hydrpgenation process which is able to produce a high quality diolefin having extremely low levels of acetylene over an extended period of time compared with the prior art. The process of the present invention provides a selective hvdroqenation reaction zone wherein the catalyst activity is maintained at a high level while the process unit remains on stream by contacting the selective hydrogenation catalyst with a polymer solvent, diolefin feed and hydrogen. The contacting may take place by introducing the solvent in admixture with the olefin feed or by cyclicly alternating contacting of the catalyst between the feed and the solvent in two or more beds.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, the present invention relates to a process for the purification of a diolefin hydrocarbon stream containing trace quantities of acetylene compounds which process comprises introducing the diolefin hydrocarbon stream containing trace quantities of acetylene compounds and elemental hydrogen into a selective hydrogenation zone to selectively hydrogenate at least a portion of the acetylene compounds. A polymer solvent contacts the selective hydrogenation catalyst in said selective hydrogenation zone. One or more resulting effluents from the selective hydrogenation zone pass to at least one fractionation zone to produce a diolefin hydrocarbon stream<br>
having a reduced concentration of acetylene compounds and a stream containing polymer solvent and polymer compounds. Recycling at least a portion of the stream containing polymer solvent and polymer compounds provides at least a portion of the polymer solvent to the selective hydrogenation zone. At least another portion of the stream containing polymer solvent and polymer compounds and the diolefin hydrocarbon stream having a reduced concentration of acetylene compounds produced are recovered.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
The drawings are simplified process flow diagrams of preferred embodiments of the present invention. The drawings are intended to be schematically illustrative of the present invention and not be a limitation thereof.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been discovered that a selective hydrogenation zone for the hydrogenation of trace quantities of acetylene contained in a stream of diolefins may achieve continued start-of-run activity, yields and product quality by contacting the selective catalyst with a polymer solvent, diolefin feed and hydrogen. These advantages enable superior performance and economic results.<br>
The process of the present invention is particularly useful for the production of high quality diolefin streams in a process having an extended on-<br>
stream capability. The diolefin feed stream may be any convenient hydrocarbon stream containing diolefin compounds and having undesirable trace quantities of acetylene compounds. It is contemplated that the diolefin feedstream contains diolefins containing from 3 to 5 carbon atoms. A preferred diolefin feedstream contains butadiene.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the selected diolefin feedstock is introduced along with a polymer solvent and hydrogen into a selective hydrogenation reaction zone operating at selective hydrogenation conditions and containing a selective hydrogenation catalyst to produce an improved diolefin stream having a reduced concentration of acetylene compounds.<br>
The polymer solvent may be selected from any compound or mixtures of compounds and which polymer solvent is capable of acting as a solvent for polymers which are produced during the selective hydrogenation reaction. Suitable solvents may be selected from alkane compounds having from 4 to 8 or more carbon atoms. In the case where the fresh feedstock is a stream of butadiene, a particularly preferred polymer solvent is hexane. For the case of feed and solvent in admixture the polymer solvent may be present in an amount of 5 to 100 weight percent based on the weight of diolefin. It is preferred that the polymer solvent has a boiling point greater than the diolefin feedstream. The selective hydrogenation conditions will depend upon the selected diolefinic feed and may be selected from a pressure from 1379 kPa to 3447 kPa and a temperature from 32°C to 83°C.<br>
The process may produce one or more effluents depending on whether the process mixes the solvent with the feed or contacts the catalyst separately with the feed and solvent in a cyclic operation. Each resulting effluent from the selective hydrogenation reaction zone is passed to a fractionation zone to produce a diolefin hydrocarbon stream having a reduced concentration of acetylene compounds and/or a stream containing the polymer solvent and polymer compounds. A small drag stream of polymer solvent containing' dissolved polymer compounds is removed from the process to prevent an accumulation of polymer compounds in the polymer solvent. Fresh make-up polymer solvent is added in order to maintain a suitable inventory of solvent. At least a portion of the polymer solvent recovered from the fractionation zone is recycled to the inlet of the selective hydrogenation zone.<br>
In a cyclic mode of operation the selected diolefin feedstock is introduced along with hydrogen into an on-line selective hydrogenation reaction zone operating at selective hydrogenation conditions and containing a selective hydrogenation catalyst to produce an improved diolefin stream having a reduced concentration of acetylene compounds.<br>
In an alternating fashion, an off-line reaction zone containing selective hydrogenation catalyst, either spent or partially spent, is preferably contacted with a polymer solvent and hydrogen at catalyst regeneration conditions including a pressure from 1034 kPa to 3447 kPa, a temperature from 322C to 260°C and a solvent liquid hourly space velocity from 0.5 to 10hr-1. The resulting effluent containing polymer solvent, dissolved polymer and hydrogen from the off-line reaction zone undergoing regeneration is introduced into a fractionation zone to remove gaseous hydrogen and to recover the polymer solvent which is preferably recycled together with fresh, make-up polymer solvent.<br>
At least a portion of the polymer solvent recovered from the fractionation zone is preferably recycled to the inlet of the off-line selective hydrogenation zone.<br>
The selective hydrogenation catalyst may be any suitable known catalyst and may contain one or more beds of the same or different selective hydrogenation catalyst. Suitable catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of acetylene contain copper metal, activated with one or more of the metals from the group of silver, platinum, palladium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, chromium and molybdenum on an alumina support. The hydrogenation catalysts contemplated for use in the process of the present include any support types, sizes and shapes, for example, spheres, cylinders, tri-lobes, quadralobes and rings. The process of the present invention is not limited by the type of hydrogenation catalyst and any suitable selective hydrogenation catalyst is contemplated for use therein.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In the drawings, the process of the present invention is illustrated by means of a simplified schematic flow diagram.<br>

A stream containing butadiene and trace quantities of acetylene is removed from feed surge drum 2 via line 4 and is admixed with a recycle stream containing a polymer solvent transported via line 14 and the resulting admixture is transported via line 5 and is admixed with a hydrogen-rich gaseous stream provided via line 15 and the resulting admixture is transported via line 16 and introduced into selective hydrogenation zone 6. An effluent stream containing butadiene and having a reduced concentration of acetylene compounds is removed from selective hydrogenation zone 6 via line 7 and introduced into fractionation zone 8. A stream containing butadiene and having a reduced concentration of acetylene compounds is removed from fractionation zone 8 via line 9 and is recovered for further purification and subsequent use. A stream containing polymer solvent and polymer compounds is removed from fractionation zone 8 via line 10 and at least a portion is transported via line 11 and introduced into polymer solvent storage drum 13. Another portion of the stream removed from fractionation zone 8 via line 10 is removed via line 12 as a drag stream in order to prevent an<br>
undue accumulation of polymer compounds in the process. A stream containing polymer solvent and dissolved polymer compounds is removed from polymer solvent storage vessel 13 via line 14 and is admixed with a fresh make-up stream of polymer solvent which is introduced via line 17 and the resulting mixture is carried via line 14 and contacts the butadiene stream carried via line 4 as hereinabove described.<br>

A stream containing butadiene and trace quantities of acetylene is removed from feed surge drum 2 via line 4' and is admixed with a hydrogen-rich gaseous stream provided via line 5' and the resulting admixture is introduced into on-line selective hydrogenation zone 7' via line 6'. An effluent stream containing butadiene and having a reduced concentration of acetylene compounds is removed from on-line selective hydrogenation zone 7' via lines 8' and 9' and introduced into fractionation zone 10'. A stream containing butadiene and having a reduced concentration of acetylene compounds is removed from fractionation zone 10 via line 11 and is recovered for further purification and subsequent use. A stream containing polymer solvent and polymer compounds is removed from surge drum 15 via line 16 and is admixed with a hydrogen-rich gaseous stream introduced via line 17' and the resulting admixture is transported via line 18 and introduced into off-line selective hydrogenation zone 19 An effluent stream containing polymer<br>
solvent and polymer compounds is removed from off-line selective hydrogenation zone 19 via line 20' and line 9 and is introduced into fractionation zone 10. A stream containing polymer solvent and polymer compounds is removed from fractionation zone 10' via line 12 and at least a portion is transported via line 14 and introduced into polymer solvent storage drum 15. Another portion of the stream removed from fractionation zone 10 via line 12 is removed via line 13' as a drag stream in order to prevent an undue accumulation of polymer compounds in the process. Fresh make-up polymer solvent is introduced via line 21 into polymer solvent storage drum 15.<br>
The process of the present invention is further demonstrated by the following illustrative embodiments. The following are considered prospective and reasonably illustrative of the expected performance of the invention based upon sound engineering calculations.<br>
