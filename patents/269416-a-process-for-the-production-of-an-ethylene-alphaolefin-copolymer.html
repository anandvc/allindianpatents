				<td>IMPROVED POLYMERIZATION PROCESSES USING METALLOCENE CATALYSTS, THEIR POLYMER PRODUCTS AND END USES<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The   invention  relates   generally  to   a  process   for  polyolefin<br>
manufacturing in gas-phase fluidized bed polymerization reactors and polyolefins<br>
manufactured therefrom.<br>
Background<br>
[0002]	Recent advances in polymerization and catalysis have resulted in<br>
the ability to produce many new polymers having improved physical and chemical properties useful in a wide variety of superior products and applications. Regardless of these technological advances in the polyolefin industry, common problems, as well as new challenges still exist.<br>
[0003]	Advances   in  polymerization  technology  have  provided  more<br>
efficient, highly productive, and economically enhanced processes. Especially illustrative of these advances is the development of single site catalyst systems. Single site catalysts have been shown to be highly useful in the preparation of polyolefins, producing relatively homogeneous copolymers at good polymerization rates, allowing one to closely tailor the final properties of the polymer produced. In contrast to traditional Ziegler-Natta catalyst compositions, single site catalyst compositions comprise catalytic compounds in which each catalyst composition molecule contains one or only a few polymerization sites. Metallocenes are the most well known type of single site catalyst precursor, and are organometallic coordination complexes containing one or more pi-bonded moieties (e.g., cycloalkadienyl groups) in association with a metal atom from Groups IIIB to VIII or the Lanthanide series of the Periodic Table of Elements.<br>
[0004]	There has been tremendous focus in the industry on developing<br>
new and improved metallocene catalyst systems, designing the catalyst systems to produce new polymers, to improve operability or processability, and to improve<br>
catalyst productivity. Metallocene catalyst variables include the metal atom, the ligands or pi-bonded moieties associated with the metal atom, the type of catalyst support used, as well as any catalyst activator and the reduction ratio of the catalyst or catalyst precursors.<br>
[0005]	Unfortunately,   improving   upon   the   productivity,   operability,<br>
processability, and economics of a polymerization process entails overcoming several obstacles, especially when introducing a new catalyst. A few of these issues are discussed in patents and published patent applications including: U.S. Patent No. 6,339,134, discussing ways to improve melt properties of metallocene produce polymers; U.S. Patent No. 6,987,152, discussing the effect of feed impurities upon the process; U.S. Patent No. 6,914,027, discussing fines production, sheeting/fouling, and their related heat transfer problems; and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0137364, discussing problems associated with heat removal from the polymerization reactor; each of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Each of these references, among others, describes common problems encountered and which are of concern when introducing a new catalyst to the process due to the unpredictability of results associated with a new catalyst or catalyst system<br>
[0006]	For example, the processability of metallocene and metallocene-<br>
type catalyzed polyethylenes (mPE) is often different than polyethylenes produced in a high pressure polymerization process or with other catalysts, such as Ziegler-Natta type catalysts. For example, mPEs typically have a narrow molecular weight distribution, which tend to be more difficult to process. Generally, the broader the polymer molecular weight distribution, the easier the polymer is to process. These examples illustrate the challenges to be encountered when commercializing a new catalyst system.<br>
[0007]	Generally, these mPEs require more motor power and produce<br>
higher extruder pressures to match the extrusion rate of LDPEs. Typical mPEs also have lower melt strength which, for example, adversely affects bubble stability during blown film extrusion, and they are prone to melt fracture at<br>
commercial shear rates.  On the other hand, mPEs exhibit many superior physical properties as compared to LDPEs.<br>
[0008]	Additionally, reactor conditions and the catalyst employed in the<br>
polymerization affect numerous physical and chemical properties of the polymer, including molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, compositional distribution, crystallinity and melting temperature, and extractable content (e.g. hexane extractables), among others. In addition to the several reactor and reactant process control variables which may be manipulated during production, polymer prdduct; "pro'perties may also vary based upon catalyst formulation and structure. The metal atom and the ligands (pi-bonded moieties) forming the metallocene complex can affect the properties of the polymer product formed. The support architecture, the number of functional groups on the support (such as -OH groups on silica), the activator loading, and the pre-impregnated catalyst loading can also affect the product formed.<br>
[0009]	End users often desire improvements or a balancing of several<br>
polymer properties. Among these are included melting point for a given density, tear properties, impact and tensile strength, heat seal and hot tack properties, and others. For example, there is a strong desire in the industry to improve heat seal and hot tack properties in PE films. It is particularly desirable to lower the heat seal temperature, broaden the hot tack"window and increase the hot tack strength while maintaining low extractables to meet regulatory requirements for food packaging. These improvements are usually accomplished by lowering the density of the film resin. This, however, may negatively affect other film properties such as tear strength, dart impact strength, stiffness, and it lowers the melting temperature of the film. Additionally, to achieve good clarity, low haze, and better processability, metallocene resiris are often blended with high pressure LDPE, adding to manufacturing costs.<br>
[0010]	Other background references include EP 1 153, 948 Al, EP 1 416<br>
001 Al, WO 1999/29737, WO 2004/000919, U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2003/194575, 2005/0058847, 2005/054791, and U.S. Patent No. 6,448,341.<br>
[0011]	Metallocene derived resins have many advantageous properties that<br>
provide commercially attractive products. Accordingly, there exists a need for low and medium density poly ethylenes having improved properties.<br>

catalysts and processes for producing a polymer. In particular, embodiments of this invention relate to the production of ethylene alpha-olefin copolymers as well as improvements in the properties of the resulting ethylene alpha-olefin copolymer.<br>
[0034]	In   other   embodiments,   the   invention   relates   to   metallocene<br>
catalysts and polymerization processes for producing a metallocene polyethylene having an increased melting point. In other aspects, embodiments disclosed herein relate to an ethylene alpha-olefm copolymer having a lower seal initiation temperature. Other embodiments relate to an alpha-olefin copolymer having a broader hot tack window.<br>
Metallocene Catalyst Compounds<br>
[0035]	The metallocene catalyst compounds as described herein include<br>
"half sandwich" and "full sandwich" compounds having one or more Cp ligands (cyclopentadienyl and ligands isolobal to cyclopentadienyl) bound to at least one Group 3 to Group 12 metal atom, and one or more leaving groups bound to the at least one metal atom. Hereinafter, these compounds will be referred to as "metallocenes" or "metallocene catalyst components". The metallocene catalyst component may be supported on a support material, as described further below, and may be supported with or without another catalyst component. In one embodiment, the one or more metallocene catalyst components of the invention are represented by the formula (I):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
[0036]	wherein M is a metal atom selected from the group consisting of<br>
Groups 3 through 12 atoms and lanthanide Group atoms in one embodiment. In other embodiments, M may be selected from Ti, Zr, Hf atoms. In yet other embodiments, M is hafnium (Hf). Each leaving group X is chemically bonded to M; each Cp group is chemically bonded to M; and n is 0 or an integer from 1 to 4, and either 1 or 2 in a particular embodiment.<br>
[0037]	The Cp ligands are one or more rings or ring systems, at least a<br>
portion of which includes 7t-bonded systems, such as cycloalkadienyl ligands and heterocyclic analogues. The Cp ligands are distinct from the leaving groups bound to the catalyst compound in that they are not highly susceptible to substitution or abstraction reactions. The ligands represented by CpA and CpB in formula (I) may be the same or different cyclopentadienyl ligands or ligands isolobal to cyclopentadienyl, either or both of which may contain heteroatoms and either or both of which may be substituted by at least one R group. Non-limiting examples of substituent R groups include groups selected from hydrogen radicals, alkyls, alkenyls, alkynyls, cycloalkyls, aryls, acyls, aroyls, alkoxys, aryloxys, alkylthiols, dialkylamines, alkylamidos, alkoxycarbonyls, aryloxycarbonyls, carbomoyls, alkyl- and dialkyl-carbamoyls, acyloxys, acylaminos, aroylaminos, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, CpA and CpB are independently selected from the group consisting of cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, tetrahydroindenyl, fluorenyl, and substituted derivatives of each. (As used herein, the term "substituted" means that the group following that term possesses at least one moiety in place of one or more hydrogens in any position, which moieties are selected from such groups as halogen radicals (e.g., CI, F, Br), hydroxyl groups, carbonyl groups, carboxyl groups, amine groups, phosphine groups, alkoxy groups, phenyl groups, naphthyl groups, C1 to C10 alkyl groups, C2 to C10 alkenyl groups, and combinations thereof. Examples of substituted alkyls and aryls include, but are not limited to, acyl radicals, alkylamino radicals, alkoxy radicals, aryloxy radicals, alkylthio radicals, dialkylamino radicals, alkoxycarbonyl radicals, aryloxycarbonyl radicals, carbomoyl radicals, alkyl- and dialkyl-carbamoyl radicals, acyloxy radicals, acylamino radicals, arylamino radicals, and combinations thereof.)<br>
[0038]	In one embodiment, each leaving group X in the formula (I) above<br>
may be independently selected from the group consisting of halogen ions, hydrides, C1-12 alkyls, C2-12 alkenyls, C6-12 aryls, C7-20 alkylaryls, C1-12 alkoxys, C6-16 aryloxys, C7-18 alkylaryloxys, C1-12 fluoroalkyls, C6-12 fluoroaryls, and C1-12 heteroatom-containing hydrocarbons, and substituted derivatives thereof. As used herein, the phrase "leaving group" refers to one or more chemical moieties bound<br>
to the metal center of the catalyst component, which can be abstracted from the catalyst component by an activator, thus producing a species active towards olefin polymerization or oligomerization. The activator is described further below.<br>
[0039]	The structure of the metallocene catalyst component may take on<br>
many forms, such as those disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,026,798, U.S. Pat. No. 5,703,187, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,406, including a dimer or oligomeric structure, such as disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,026,798 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,069,213. Others include those catalysts describe in published U.S. Pat. App. Nos. US2005/0124487A1, US2005/0164875 Al, and US2005/0148744. Each of the aforementioned references is hereby incorporated by reference. In other embodiments, the metallocene may be formed with a Hafnium metal atom, such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,242,545, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0040]	In certain embodiments, the metallocene catalysts components<br>
described above may include their structural or optical or enantiomeric isomers (racemic mixture), and, in one embodiment, may be a pure enantiomer. As used herein, a single, bridged, asymmetrically substituted metallocene catalyst component having a racemic and/or meso isomer does not, itself, constitute at least two different bridged, metallocene catalyst components.<br>
[0041]	In one embodiment, the metallocene catalyst contains hafnium as<br>
the metal atom. In other embodiments, at least one of the ligands (pi-bonded moieties) contains a cyclopentadienyl group. In other embodiments, the metallocene contains a chloride leaving group. In yet other embodiments, the metallocene contains a fluoride leaving group. In yet other embodiments, the metallocene contains a methyl leaving group.<br>
[0042]	In some embodiments, the metallocene catalyst may be a bis(n-<br>
propylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium Xn, bis(n-butylcyc!opentadienyl)hafnium Xn,<br>
bis(n-pentylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium Xn, (n-propyl cyclopentadienyl) (n-<br>
butylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium	X„,	bis[(2-<br>
trimethylsilylethyl)cyclopentadienyl]hafnium	Xn,	bis(trimethylsilyl<br>
cyclopentadienyl)hafnium Xn, dimethylsilylbis(n-propylcyclopentadienyl)hafhium<br>
Xn, dimethylsilylbis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium Xn, bis(l-n-propyl-2-methylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium Xn, (n-propylcyclopentadienyl)(l -n-propyl-3-n-butylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium Xn, or combinations thereof, where Xn is as described above.<br>
[0043]	In other embodiments, the metallocene catalyst may be a bis(n-<br>
propylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium	dichloride,	a	bis(n-<br>
propylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium difluoride, or a dimethyl bis(n-propylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium.<br>
Activator   and   Activation   Methods   for   the   Metallocene   Catalyst Compounds<br>
[0044]	The term "activator" is defined to be any compound or component<br>
which can activate a transition metal metallocene-type catalyst compound as described above, for example, a Lewis acid or a non-coordinating ionic activator or ionizing activator or any other compound that can convert a neutral metallocene catalyst component to a metallocene cation. It is within the scope of this invention to use alumoxane or modified alumoxane as an activator, and/or to also use ionizing activators, neutral or ionic, such as tri (n-butyl) ammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) boron or a trisperfluorophenyl boron metalloid precursor which ionize the neutral metallocene compound. A preferred activator used with the catalyst compositions of the present invention is methylaluminoxane ("MAO"). The MAO activator may be associated with or bound to a support, either in association with the catalyst component (e.g., metallocene) or separate from the catalyst component, such as described by Gregory G. Hlatky, Heterogeneous Single-Site Catalysts for Olefin Polymerization, 100(4) CHEMICAL REVIEWS 1347-1374 (2000).<br>
[0045]	There are a variety of methods for preparing alumoxane and<br>

Method for Supporting<br>
[0047]	A support may also be present as part of the catalyst system of the<br>
present invention. Supports, methods of supporting, modifying, and activating supports for single-site catalyst such as metallocenes are discussed in, for example, 1 METALLOCENE-BASED POLYOLEFINS 173-218 (J. Scheirs &amp; W. Kaminsky eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. 2000). The terms "support" or "carrier," as used herein, are used interchangeably and refer to any support material, including inorganic or organic support materials. In one embodiment, the support material may be a porous support material. Non-limiting examples of support materials include inorganic oxides and inorganic chlorides, and in particular such materials as talc, clay, silica, alumina, magnesia, zirconia, iron oxides, boria, calcium oxide, zinc oxide, barium oxide, thoria, aluminum phosphate gel, and polymers such as polyvinylchloride and substituted polystyrene, functionalized or crosslinked organic supports such as polystyrene divinyl benzene polyolefins or polymeric compounds, and mixtures thereof, and graphite, in any of its various forms.<br>
[0048]	Desirable carriers are inorganic oxides that include Group 2, 3,4,<br>
5, 13 and 14 oxides and chlorides. Support materials include silica, alumina,<br>
silica-alumina, magnesium chloride, graphite, and mixtures thereof in one embodiment. Other useful supports include magnesia, titania, zirconia, montmorillonite (as described in EP0511665B1), phyllosilicate, and the like.

Additional support materials may include those porous acrylic polymers described in EP0767184B1.<br>
[0049]	The catalyst system of the invention can be made and used in a<br>
variety of different ways. In one embodiment, the catalyst is unsupported, preferably in liquid form such as described in U.S. Pat.

[0052]	A preferred method for producing the catalyst of the invention can<br>
be found in WO 96/00245 and WO 96/00243, all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
Polymerization Process<br>
[0053]	The polymerization process of the present invention may be carried<br>
out using any suitable process, such as, for example, solution, slurry, high pressure, and gas phase. A particularly desirable method for producing polyolefin polymers according to the present invention is a gas phase polymerization process preferably utilizing a fluidized bed reactor. This type reactor, and means for operating the reactor, are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,709,853; 4,003,712; 4,011,382; 4,302,566; 4,543,399; 4,882,400; 5,352,749; 5,541,270; EP-A-0 802 202 and Belgian Patent No. 839,380. These patents disclose gas phase polymerization processes wherein the polymerization medium is either mechanically agitated or fluidized by the continuous flow of the gaseous monomer and diluent.<br>
[0054]	Other gas phase processes contemplated by the process of the<br>
invention include series or multistage polymerization processes. Also gas phase processes contemplated by the invention include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,627,242, 5,665,818 and 5,677,375, and European publications EP-A-0 794 200 EP-B1-0 649 992, EP-A-0 802 202 and EP-B-634 421 all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0055]	In general, the polymerization process may be a continuous gas<br>
phase process, such as a fluid bed process. A fluid bed reactor for use in the process of the present invention typically has a reaction zone and a so-called velocity reduction zone. The reaction zone includes a bed of growing polymer particles, formed polymer particles and a minor amount of catalyst particles fluidized by the continuous flow of the gaseous monomer and diluent to remove heat of polymerization through the reaction zone. The gas leaving the reaction zone is passed to the velocity reduction zone where entrained particles are allowed to settle back to the particle' bed. "Finer "entrained particles and dust may be removed in a cyclone and/or fine filter. The gas is passed through a heat<br>
exchanger wherein the heat of polymerization is removed, compressed in a compressor and then returned to the reaction zone. Optionally, some of the recirculated gases may be cooled and compressed to form liquids that increase the heat removal capacity of the circulating gas stream when readmitted to the reaction zone. A suitable rate of gas flow may be readily determined by simple experiment. Makeup of gaseous monomer to the circulating gas stream is at a rate equal to the rate at which particulate polymer product and monomer associated therewith is withdrawn from the reactor, and the composition of the gas passing through the reactor is adjusted to maintain an essentially steady state gaseous composition within the reaction zone.<br>
[0056]	The process of the present invention is suitable for the production<br>
of homopolymers of olefins, including ethylene, and/or copolymers, terpolymers, and the like, of olefins, including polymers comprising ethylene and at least one or more other olefins. The olefins may be alpha-olefins. The olefins, for example, may contain from 2 to 16 carbon atoms in one embodiment; ethylene and a comonomer comprising from 3 to 12 carbon atoms in another embodiment; ethylene and a comonomer comprising from 4 to 10 carbon atoms in another embodiment; and ethylene and a comonomer comprising from 4 to 8 carbon atoms in another embodiment.<br>
[0057]	Other monomers useful in the process described herein include<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomers, diolefins having 4 to 18 carbon atoms, conjugated or non-conjugated dienes, polyenes, vinyl monomers and cyclic olefins. Non-limiting monomers useful in the invention may include norbornene, norbornadiene, isobutylene, isoprene, vinylbenzocyclobutane, styrenes, alkyl substituted styrene, ethylidene norbornene, dicyclopentadiene and cyclopentene. In another embodiment of the process described herein, ethylene or propylene may be polymerized with at least two different comonomers, optionally one of which may be a diene, to form a terpolymer.<br>
[0058]	In one embodiment, the content of the alpha-olefin incorporated<br>
into the copolymer may be no greater than 30 mol % in total; from 3 to 20 mol % in other embodiments.  The term, "polyethylene"  when used herein is used<br>
generically to refer to any or all of the polymers comprising ethylene described above.<br>
[0059]	Hydrogen gas is often used in olefin polymerization to control the<br>
final properties of the polyolefm. Using the catalyst system of the present invention, it is known that increasing the concentration (partial pressure) of hydrogen may increase the melt flow index (MFI) and/or melt index (MI) of the polyolefm generated. The MFI or MI can thus be influenced by the hydrogen concentration. The amount of hydrogen in the polymerization can be expressed as a mole ratio relative to the total polymerizable monomer, for example, ethylene, or a blend of ethylene and hexene or propylene. The amount of hydrogen used in the polymerization processes of the present invention is an amount necessary to achieve the desired MFI or MI of the final polyolefm resin.<br>
[0060]	Further, in certain embodiments, the polymerization process may<br>
include two or more reactors. Such commercial polymerization systems are described in, for example, 2 METALLOCENE-BASED POLYOLEFINS 366-378 (John Scheirs &amp; W. Kaminsky, eds. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. 2000); U.S. Pat. No. 5,665,818, U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,375, and EP-A-0 794 200.<br>
[0061]	In one embodiment, the one or more reactors in a gas phase or<br>
fluidized bed polymerization process may have a pressure ranging from about 0.7 to about 70 bar (about 10 to 1000 psia); and in another embodiment, a pressure ranging from about 14 to about 42 bar (about 200 to about 600 psia). In one embodiment, the one or more reactors may have a temperature ranging from about 10°C to about 150°C; and in another embodiment from about 40°C to about 125°C. In one embodiment, the reactor temperature may be operated at the highest feasible temperature taking into account the sintering temperature of the polymer within the reactor. In one embodiment, the superficial gas velocity in the one or more reactors may range from about 0.2 to 1.1 meters/second (0.7 to 3.5 feet/second); and from about 0.3 to 0.8 meters/second (1.0 to 2.7 feet/second) in another embodiment.<br>
[0062]	In  another  embodiment  of the  invention,  the  polymerization<br>
process is  a continuous gas phase process that includes the  steps  of:  (a)<br>
introducing ethylene and at least one other alpha olefin monomer(s) into the reactor; (b) introducing the supported catalyst system; (c) withdrawing a recycle stream from the reactor; (d) cooling the recycle stream; (e) introducing into the reactor additional monomer(s) to replace the monomer(s) polymerized; (f) reintroducing the recycle stream or a portion thereof into the reactor; and (g) withdrawing a polymer product from the reactor.<br>
[0063]	In embodiments of the invention, one or more olefins, C2 to C30<br>
olefins or alpha-olefins, including ethylene or propylene or combinations thereof, may be prepolymerized in the presence of the metallocene catalyst systems described above prior to the main polymerization. The prepolymerization may be carried out batch-wise or continuously in gas, solution or slurry phase, including at elevated pressures. The prepolymerization can take place with any olefin monomer or combination and/or in the presence of any molecular weight controlling agent such as hydrogen. For examples of prepolymerization procedures, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,748,221, 4,789,359, 4,923,833, 4,921,825, 5,283,278 and 5,705,578 and European publication EP-B-0279 863 and PCT Publication WO 97/44371 all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0064]	The present invention is not limited to  any specific type of<br>
fluidized or gas phase polymerization reaction and can be carried out in a single reactor or multiple reactors such as two or more reactors in series. In embodiments, the present invention may be carried out in fluidized bed polymerizations (that may be mechanically stirred and/or gas fluidized), or with those utilizing a gas phase, similar to that as described above. In addition to well-known conventional gas phase polymerization processes, it is within the scope of the present invention that "condensing mode", including the "induced condensing mode" and "liquid monomer" operation of a gas phase polymerization may be used.<br>
[0065]	Embodiments of the present invention may employ a condensing<br>
mode polymerization, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,543,399; 4,588,790; 4,994,534; 5,352,749; 5,462,999; and 6,489,408, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.   Condensing mode processes may be used to<br>
achieve higher cooling capacities and, hence, higher reactor productivity. In addition to condensable fluids of the polymerization process itself, other condensable fluids inert to the polymerization may be introduced to induce a condensing mode operation, such as by the processes described in U.S. Patent No. 5,436,304, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0066]	Other embodiments of the preset invention may also use a liquid<br>
monomer polymerization mode such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,453,471; U.S. Serial No. 08/510,375; PCT 95/09826 (US) and PCT 95/09827 (US). When operating in the liquid monomer mode, liquid can be present throughout the entire polymer bed provided that the liquid monomer present in the bed is adsorbed on or in solid particulate matter present in the bed, such as polymer being produced or inert particulate material (e.g., carbon black, silica, clay, talc, and mixtures thereof), so long as there is no substantial amount of free liquid monomer present. Operating in a liquid monomer mode may also make it possible to produce polymers in a gas phase reactor using monomers having condensation temperatures much higher than the temperatures at which conventional polyolefins are produced.<br>
[0067]	In one embodiment, a useful polymerization technique may be<br>
particle form polymerization or a slurry process where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which the polymer goes into solution. Other slurry processes include those employing a loop reactor and those utilizing a plurality of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes. Also, other examples of slurry processes are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,613,484 and 2 METALLOCENE-BASED POLYOLEFINS 322-332 (2000).<br>
[0068]	In one embodiment, a slurry polymerization process generally uses<br>
pressures in the range of from 1 to 50 bar and even greater, and temperatures in the range of 0°C to 120°C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension, including diluent, is intermittently or continuously removed from the<br>
reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms; in one embodiment, the alkane may be a branched alkane. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used, the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. In one embodiment, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed.<br>
[0069]	In one embodiment of the process of the invention, the slurry or<br>
gas phase process may be operated in the presence of a metallocene-type catalyst system and in the absence of, or essentially free of, any scavengers, such as triethylaluminum, trimethylaluminum, tri-isobutylaluminum and tri-n-hexylaluminum and diethyl aluminum chloride, dibutyl zinc, and the like. By "essentially free" it is meant that these compounds are not deliberately added to the reactor or any reactor components, and if present, are present in the reactor at less than 1 ppm.<br>
[0070]	As   noted   above,   the   polymerization   process   of the   present<br>
invention may be carried out by using a solution process. Non-limiting examples of solution processes are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,271,060, 5,001,205, 5,236,998, and 5,589,555.<br>
[0071]	In another embodiment, one or all of the catalysts are combined<br>
with up to 15 weight percent of a metal-fatty acid compound, such as, for example, an aluminum stearate, based upon the weight of the catalyst system (or its components), such as disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,300,436 and 5,283,278. Other suitable metals include other Group 2 and Group 5-13 metals. In another embodiment, a solution of the metal-fatty acid compound is fed into the reactor. In another embodiment, the metal-fatty acid compound is mixed with the catalyst and fed into the reactor separately. These agents may be mixed with the catalyst or may be fed into the reactor in a solution or slurry with or without the catalyst system or its components.<br>
[0072]	In some embodiments, for a fluidized bed gas-phase reactor, the<br>
reactor temperature of the fluidized bed process may be the highest temperature that is feasible taking into account the sticking temperature of the polyolefin product within the reactor and any fouling that may occur in the reactor or recycle line(s).<br>
[0073]	For example, for the production of a typical metallocene-catalyzed<br>
resin in a fluidized bed gas-phase reactor, the reactor bed temperature is normally operated considerably below the melting temperature (DSC, 2nd melt) of the produced polymer. For a typical metallocene LLDPE film resin of 0.912 g/cc density and a melt index of 1 dg/min, the melting temperature of the polymer is in the range of 116°C to 117°C (as measured by DSC 2nd melt). For these grades the bed temperature would normally be set at 80°C. Stickiness in the polymer would be induced if the reactor bed temperature were increased.<br>
[0074]	In   some   embodiments,   for  the   production   of the   inventive<br>
metallocene catalyzed resins described herein in a fluidized bed gas-phase reactor embodiment, the reactor bed temperature may be 85°C or higher. In other embodiments, the reactor bed temperature may be 90°C or higher.<br>
Polymer<br>
[0075]	The polyolefins of the present invention may be blended with other<br>
polymers and/or additives to form compositions that can then be used in articles of manufacture. Those additives include antioxidants, nucleating agents, acid scavengers, plasticizers, stabilizers, anticorrosion agents, blowing agents, ultraviolet light absorbers, quenchers, antistatic agents, slip agents, pigments, dyes and fillers, and cure agents such as peroxides. These and other common additives in the polyolefin industry may be present in polyolefin compositions from 0.01 to 50 weight percent in one embodiment, and from 0.1 to 20 weight percent in another embodiment, and from 1 to 5 weight percent in yet another embodiment, wherein a desirable range may include any combination of any upper weight percent limit with any lower weight percent limit. Antioxidants and stabilizers such as organic phosphites, hindered amines, and phenolic antioxidants may be present in the polyolefin compositions of the invention from 0.001 to 5 weight<br>
percent in one embodiment, from 0.01 to 0.8 weight percent in another embodiment, and from 0.02 to 0.5 weight percent in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0076]	Fillers may be present from 0.1 to 50 weight percent, in one<br>
embodiment, and from 0.1 to 25 weight percent of the composition in another embodiment, and from 0.2 to 10 weight percent in yet another embodiment. Desirable fillers include, but are not limited to, titanium dioxide, silicon carbide, silica (and other oxides of silica, precipitated or not), antimony oxide, lead carbonate, zinc white, lithopone, zircon, corundum, spinel, apatite, Barytes powder, barium sulfate, magnesiter, carbon black, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc and hydrotalcite compounds of the ions Mg, Ca, or Zn- with Al, Cr or Fe and CO3 and/or HPO4, hydrated or not; quartz powder, hydrochloric magnesium carbonate, glass fibers, clays, alumina, and other metal oxides and carbonates, metal hydroxides, chrome, phosphorous and brominated flame retardants, antimony trioxide, silica, silicone, and blends thereof. These fillers may particularly include any other fillers and porous fillers and supports known in the art.<br>
[0077]	Fatty acid salts may also be present in the polyolefin compositions<br>
of the present invention. Such salts may be present from 0.001 to 2 weight percent of the composition in one embodiment, and from 0.01 to 1 weight percent in another embodiment. Examples of fatty acid metal salts include lauric acid, stearic acid, succinic acid, stearyl lactic acid, lactic acid, phthalic acid, benzoic acid, hydroxystearic acid, ricinoleic acid, naphthenic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, and erucic acid, suitable metals including Li, Na, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Cd, Al, Sn, Pb and so forth. Desirable fatty acid salts are selected from magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, sodium stearate, zinc stearate, calcium oleate, zinc oleate, and magnesium oleate.<br>
[0078]	With respect to the physical process of producing the blend of<br>
polyolefin and one or more additives, sufficient mixing should take place to assure that a uniform blend will be produced prior to conversion into a finished product. The polyolefin suitable for use in the present invention can be in any physical form when used to blend with the one or more additives. In one embodiment,<br>
reactor granules (defined as the granules of polymer that are isolated from the polymerization reactor) are used to blend with the additives. The reactor granules have an average diameter of from 10 microns to 5 mm; from 50 microns to 10 mm in another embodiment. Alternately, the polyolefm is in the form of pellets, such as, for example, pellets having an average diameter of from 1 mm to 6 mm that are formed from melt extrusion of the reactor granules.<br>
[0079]	One method of blending the additives with the polyolefin is to<br>
contact the components in a tumbler or other physical blending means, the polyolefin being in the form of reactor granules. This can then be followed, if desired, by melt blending in an extruder. Another method of blending the components is to melt blend the polyolefm pellets with the additives directly in an extruder, BRABENDER® or any other melt blending means.<br>
[0080]	The resultant polyolefin and polyolefin compositions of the present<br>
invention may be further processed by any suitable means such as by calendering, casting, coating, compounding, extrusion, foaming; all forms of molding including compression molding, injection molding, blow molding, rotational molding (rotomolding), and transfer molding; film blowing or casting and all methods of film formation to achieve, for example, uniaxial or biaxial orientation; thermoforming, as well as by lamination, pultrusion, protrusion, draw reduction, spinbonding, melt spinning, melt blowing, and other forms of fiber and nonwoven fabric formation, and combinations thereof. These and other forms of suitable processing techniques are described in, for example, PLASTICS PROCESSING (Radian Corporation, Noyes Data Corp. 1986).<br>
[0081]	In the case of injection molding of various articles, simple solid<br>
state blends of the pellets serve equally as well as pelletized melt state blends of raw polymer granules, of granules with pellets, or of pellets of the two components, since the forming process includes a remelting and mixing of the raw material. In the process of compression molding of medical devices, however, little mixing of the melt components occurs, and a pelletized melt blend would be preferred over simple solid state blends of the constituent pellets and/or granules. Those skilled in the art will be able to determine the appropriate procedure for<br>
blending of the polymers to balance the need for intimate mixing of the component ingredients with the desire for process economy.<br>
[0082]	The polymers produced may further contain additives such as slip,<br>
antiblock, antioxidants, pigments, fillers, antifog, UV stabilizers, antistats, polymer processing aids, neutralizers, lubricants, surfactants, pigments, dyes and nucleating agents. Preferred additives include silicon dioxide, synthetic silica, titanium dioxide, polydimethylsiloxane, calcium carbonate, metal stearates, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, talc, BaSO4, diatomaceous earth, wax, carbon black, flame retarding additives, low molecular weight resins, hydrocarbon resins, glass beads and the like. The additives may be present in the typically effective amounts well known in the art, such as 0.001 weight % to 10 weight %.<br>
[0083]	In one embodiment, the' polymers disclosed herein may have a melt<br>
index (MI) or (I2) as measured by ASTM-D-1238-E (190°C, 2.16 kg weight) in the range from 0.01 dg/min to 1000 dg/min. In other embodiments, the polymer may have a MI from about 0.01 dg/min to about 100 dg/min; from about 0.1 dg/min to about 80 dg/min in other embodiments; and from about 0.5 dg/min to about 70 dg/min in yet other embodiments.<br>
[0084]	In one embodiment, the polymers disclosed herein may have a melt<br>
index ratio (I5/I2) (I5 is measured by ASTM-D-1238-G, at 190°C, 5 kg weight) of from 5 to 300. In other embodiments, the polymer may have a melt index ratio from about 10 to less than 250; from 15 to 200 in another embodiment; and from 20 to 180 in yet another embodiment. In other embodiments the polymer may have a melt index ratio from 15 to 30; from 10 to 40 in another embodiment; and from 5 to 50 in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0085]	In one embodiment, the polymers disclosed herein may have a melt<br>
flow ratio (MFR) (WI2, where I2i is measured by ASTM-D-1238-F, at 190°C, 21.6 kg weight) of from 5 to 300; from about 10 to less than 250 in other embodiments; from 15 to 200 in yet other embodiments; and from 20 to 180 in yet another embodiment. In other embodiments the polymers may have \ MFR from 15 to 30; from 10 to 40 in another embodiment; and from 5 to 50 in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0086]	The  polymers  of the  present  invention have  a bulk  density<br>
measured in accordance with ASTM-D-1895 (Method B) that, in one embodiment, is greater than at least 0.30 grams per cubic centimeter. In another embodiment, the bulk density of the polymers is in the range of 0.30 to 0.50 grams per cubic centimeter.<br>
[0087]	The polyolefms then can be made into films, molded articles,<br>
sheets, wire and cable coating and the like. The films may be formed by any of the conventional technique known in the art including extrusion, co-extrusion, lamination, blowing and casting. The film may be obtained by the flat film or tubular process which may be followed by orientation in a uniaxial direction or in two mutually perpendicular directions in the plane of the film to the same or different extents. Orientation may be to the same extent in both directions or may be to different extents.

[0088]	Common rheological properties, processing methods and end use<br>
applications of metallocene based polyolefms are discussed in, for example, 2 METALLOCENE-BASED POLYOLEFINS 400-554 (John Scheirs &amp; W. Kaminsky, eds. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. 2000). The polyolefin compositions of the present invention are suitable for such articles as films, fibers and nonwoven fabrics, extruded articles and molded. Examples of films include blown or cast films formed by coextrusion or by lamination useful as shrink film, cling film, stretch film, sealing films, oriented films, snack packaging, heavy duty bags, grocery sacks, baked and frozen food packaging, medical packaging, industrial liners, membranes, etc. in food-contact and non-food contact applications, agricultural films and sheets. Examples of fibers include melt spinning, solution spinning and melt blown fiber operations for use in woven or non-woven form to make filters, diaper fabrics, hygiene products, medical garments, geotextiles, etc. Examples of extruded articles include tubing, medical tubing, wire and cable coatings, pipe, geomembranes, and pond liners. Examples of molded articles include single and multi-layered constructions in the form of bottles, tanks, large hollow articles, rigid food containers and toys, etc.<br>
[0089]	Other desirable articles that can be made from and/or incorporate<br>

More particularly, automotive components include such as bumpers, grills, trim parts, dashboards and instrument panels, exterior door and hood components, spoiler, wind screen, hub caps, mirror housing, body panel, protective side molding, and other interior and external components associated with automobiles, trucks, boats, and other vehicles.<br>
[0090]	Further useful articles and goods may be formed economically or<br>

[0091]	Polyethylenes useful for the compositions described herein may be<br>
prepared by a variety of methods. The polymerization can be conducted as solution phase processes, gas phase processes, and the like. Ethylene homopolymers and ethylene alpha-olefin copolymers useful herein may include linear polyethylenes including linear lpw density polyethylene (LLDPE, having a density in the range 0.918 to 0.927 g/cc, as determined in accordance with ASTM D 792), medium density polyethylene (MDPE, density from 0.927 to 0.940 g/cc), high density polyethylene (HDPE, density greater than 0.940), very low density polyethylene (VLDPE, density ranging from 0.900 to 0.918) and ultra low density polyethylene (ULDPE, density from 0.860 to 0.899 g/cc).<br>
[0092]	The polymers described herein typically have a weight average<br>
molecular weight to number average molecular weight (Mw/Mn) of greater than 1.5 to about 5, particularly greater than 2 to about 4.0, more preferably greater than about 2.2 to less than 3.5.<br>
Composition Distribution<br>
[0093]	The    composition   distribution   of   an    ethylene    alpha-olefin<br>
copolymer refers to the distribution of comonomer (short chain branches) among the molecules that comprise the polyethylene polymer. Ziegler-Natta catalysts and chromium based catalysts produce resins with broad composition distributions (BCD). These Ziegler-Natta and chromium based BCD resins are further characterized in that the comonomer content decreases with the molecular weight of the main polymer chains. Certain metallocene catalysts are capable of producing resins with narrow composition distributions (NCD), in which the comonomer content is about uniform among the polymer chains of different molecular weights. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,382,630 discloses linear ethylene interpolymer blends made from components that can have the same molecular weight but different comonomer contents, or the same comonomer contents but different molecular weights, or comonomer contents that increase with molecular weight (orthogonal composition distribution).<br>
[0094]	Certain advantages of a broad orthogonal composition distribution<br>
(BOCD) for improved physical properties low extractables content. {See, for example, by Kolb et al. at the METALLOCENE CONFERENCE 2004, May 13,<br>
2004	- Houston, Texas, USA; and Davey et al. at the SPE-Polyolefms 2002 International Conference, February 25-27, 2002 in Houston, TX; and Farley et al. at the SPE International Polyolefins 2005 Conference February 27 - March 2,<br>
2005	in Houston, Texas).<br>
[0095]	BOCD refers to a broad composition distribution in which the<br>
majority of the comonomer is incorporated in the high molecular weight polymer chains. The distribution of the short chain branches can be measured, for example, using temperature raising elution fractionation (TREF) in connection with a light scattering (LS) detector to determine the weight average molecular weight of the<br>
molecules eluted from the TREF column at a given temperature. The combination of TREF and LS (TREF-LS) yields information about the breadth of the composition distribution and whether the comonomer content increases, decreases, or is uniform across the chains of different molecular weights.<br>
[0096]	The  TREF-LS  data reported herein were  measured using  an<br>
analytical size TREF instrument (Polymerchar, Spain), with a column of the following dimension: inner diameter (ID) 7.8 mm and outer diameter (OD) 9.53 mm and a column length of 150 mm. The column was filled with steel beads. 0.5 mL of a 6.4% (w/v) polymer solution in orthodichlorobenzene (ODCB) containing 6 g BHT/4 L were charged onto a the column and cooled from 140°C to 25°C at a constant cooling rate of 1.0°C/min. Subsequently, ODCB was pumped through the column at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and the column temperature was increased at a constant heating rate of 2°C/min to elute the polymer. The polymer concentration in the eluted liquid was detected by means of measuring the absorption at a wavenumber of 2857 cm" using an infrared detector. The concentration of the ethylene-a-olefin copolymer in the eluted liquid was calculated from the absorption and plotted as a function of temperature. The molecular weight of the ethylene-a-olefin copolymer in the eluted liquid was measured by light scattering using a Minidawn Tristar light scattering detector (Wyatt, CA, USA). The molecular weight was also plotted as a function of temperature.<br>
[0097]	In certain embodiments, the polymers as described herein may<br>
have a broad composition distribution characterized in that the T75 - T25 value is greater than 15, preferably greater than 20 and most preferably greater than 25, wherein T25 is the temperature at which 25% of the eluted polymer is obtained and T75 is the temperature at which 75%) of the eluted polymer is obtained in a TREF experiment as described herein. The polymer as described herein may further be characterized in that the composition distribution is orthogonal defined by a M60/M90 value of greater than 1, preferably greater than 2 and most preferably greater than 3, wherein M60 is the molecular weight of the polymer fraction that elutes at 60°C in a TREF-LS experiment and M90 is the molecular weight of the<br>
polymer fraction that elutes at 90°C in a TREF-LS experiment as described herein.<br>
Hexane Extractables by FDA Method<br>
[0098]	FDA regulations for food packaging require the level of hexane<br>
extractables be below 5.3% for general use and below 2.5% for "boil in bag" application. While high melt index, medium to low density products made with Z-N catalysts typically fulfill the first requirement, often by shifting density and/or changing the comonomer type, their intrinsic properties impede the 2.5% threshold. The metallocenes described herein may be able to deliver products in a wide range of melt indicia and densities without any FDA constraints related to the levels of hexane extractables, including the more stringent "boil in bag" restriction. In some embodiments, the resins described herein may have a hexane extractable content of less than 2 percent according to the FDA method (see 21 C.F.R. § 177.1520, as revised April 1, 2005, for details on the FDA method and requirements for food contact, repeated and while cooking)<br>
[0099]	In other embodiments, the hexane extractables content may be less<br>
than 1.75 percent; less than 1.5 percent in other embodiments; and less than 1.4 percent in yet other embodiments.<br>
Melting Point (2nd Melt)<br>
[0100]	In some embodiments, the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymers may<br>
have one or more melting points wherein the higher melting point (Tmax second melt) as determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and the density of the copolymer satisfy the following relation:<br>
T max second melt  &gt; D*  398-245.<br>
wherein D is the density of the copolymer.<br>
[0101]	In other embodiments, the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymers may<br>
have one or more melting points wherein the higher melting point (Tmax second melt) as determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and the density of the copolymer satisfy the following relation:<br>
T max second melt  &gt; D*  398-242.<br>
wherein D is the density of the copolymer.<br>
Melting Point (1st Melt)<br>
[0102]	In some embodiments, the ethylene/alpha-olefm copolymers may<br>
have one or more melting points wherein the higher melting point (Tmax first melt) as determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and the density of the copolymer satisfy the following relation:<br>
Tmaxfirstmelt&gt;D*398-245<br>
wherein D is the density of the copolymer.<br>
[0103]	In some embodiments, the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymers may<br>
have one or more melting points wherein the higher melting point (Tmax first melt) as determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and the density of the copolymer satisfy the following relation:<br>
Tmax first melt &gt; D*398-242<br>
wherein D is the density of the copolymer.<br>
[0104]	For example, DSC measurements may be made on a Perkin Elmer<br>
System 7 Thermal Analysis System. The data reported are Tmax from first melting data (Tmax first melt) and Tmax from second melting data (Tmax second men), respectively. To obtain the Tmax first melt, a sample of reactor granules is heated at a programmed rate of 10°C/min to a temperature above its melting range. To obtain the Tmax second melt, the sample is heated at a programmed rate of 10°C/min to a temperature above its melting range, cooled at a programmed rate of 10°C/min to a temperature below its crystallization range, and reheated at a programmed rate of 10°C/min, where the data reported is from the reheating (second melt).<br>
[0105]	Approximate values for the peak melting point temperature, Tmax<br>
second melt, of several commercially available metallocene-catalyzed polyethylenes, for given combinations of density and melt flow, are shown in Table 1 below. The Tmax second melt of a commercially available polyethylene produced with a metallocene catalyst will vary depending upon the polymer's melt flow and<br>
density. For example, a commercially available metallocene-catalyzed metallocene polyethylene having a density of about 0.912 g/cc and a melt index (I2) of about 1.0 dg/min will have a peak melting point temperature of approximately 116°C. A higher density polymer will generally have a higher melting point.<br>

EXAMPLES Example 1: Higher DSC Melting Point (2nd Melt)<br>
[0119]	Two polyethylene  grades produced with embodiments  of the<br>
metallocene catalyst described herein were compared to a commercially available metallocene polyethylene of similar melt index and density, as described in Table 2. Sample 1 and Sample 2 were each prepared using [bis(n-propyl cyclopentadienyl)hafnium dimethyl]. Sample 1 was produced at a reactor temperature of 75°C; Sample 2 at 80°C. Comparative Sample 1 (CS1) was prepared using bis(l-methyl-3-butyl cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride at a reactor temperature of approximately 80°C.<br>
Table 2<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
 [0120]	DSC curves of three polyethylene samples are compared in FIG. 1.<br>
The peak melting temperature for the CS1 was approximately 116°C, whereas the peak melting temperature for the Sample 1 and Sample 2 were each approximately 121°C. Sample 1 and Comparative Sample 1 had identical densities and similar melt indexes, where Sample 1 was produced at a lower reaction temperature. Sample 2 and Comparative Sample 1 were produced under similar reactor conditions, with Sample 2 having a lowerdensity and a higher melting point. The higher melting point at higher melt indices and lower reactor temperature can thus be attributed to the catalyst and the resulting compositional distribution.<br>
Example 2: Higher DSC Melting Point (1st melt) and Onset of Melting (1st Melt)<br>
[0121]	Four polyethylene  grades produced with embodiments of the<br>
metallocene catalyst described herein were compared to two commercially available metallocene-produced polyethylenes of similar melt index and density, as described in Table 3.   Samples 3 through 6 were each prepared using [bis(n-<br>

twin screw extruder. Output rate was 68.1 kg/h (150 Ib/h) and the melt temperature was about 210°C.<br>
[0125]	To produce film, the resins were extruded into film using a 63.5<br>
mm (2.5 inch) Battenfield Gloucester blown film line (30:1 L:D) equipped with a 15.24 mm (6 inch) oscillating die and a Future Design air ring. Output rate was 3.36 kg/mm (188 lb/in) (or 7 g/mm/mm (10 lb/in/in) die circumference). The die temperature was 200°C.<br>

difluoride]. Film production was the same as described above in Example 3. Resin and film data were obtained according to the testing protocols described above in Example 3.<br>
[0131]	Heat seal and hot tack measurements were made according to the<br>
following procedure. The films were conditioned for heat seal and hot tack measurements by aging the samples for at least 40 hours at 23°C and 50% humidity before testing. A Heatsealer (Model PC, available from Theller) was used to measure the heat seal characteristics of the films. The samples were cut into 20.3 cm by 15.2 cm (8 inch by 6 inch) sheets and sandwiched between Mylar sheets so that the inside surfaces of the blown films were in contact. The seal was created by placing the Mylar-covered films were between 12.7 cm (5 inch) long seal bars and a pressure of 0.5 MPa (73 psi) was applied for 1.0 seconds. Seals were created at temperatures ranging from 75°C to 150°C, and the seal length was approximately 25.4 mm (1 inch). The heat seals were then aged for a minimum of 24 hours at 23 C and 50% humidity and the seal strength was measured at a rate of 508 mm/min (20 inch/min). Hot tack curves were generated on a J&amp;B Instruments hot tack tester using 15-mm wide film samples backed with 50 mm thick PET tape. The seal time and pressure was 0.5 s and 0.5 MPa, respectively. The seal strength was measured after 0.4 s delay time at a speed of 200 mm/min.<br>

distribution across the different molecular weights indicated by a M60/M90 value of close to 1. Figures 9-13 graphically represent the TREF-LS data of the resins used to produce samples 9, 10, 11 12 and CS6 further exemplifying the BOCD nature of the resins described herein.<br>

[0136]	The stiffness of films produced from BOCD resins described<br>
herein is increased by at least 5% as evidenced by the 1% secant modulus.<br>
[0137]	The hexane extractables content of films the BOCD resins is<br>
advantageously low and meets the FDA requirement of method 21 C.F.R. 177.1520 of less than 2 percent.<br>
[0138]	Resins  described herein yield  films  that  show a number  of<br>
advantageously improved properties over comparable commercially available metallocene-catalyzed resins, for example, such as increased melt temperature,<br>
lower heat seal initiation temperature, improved hot tack force, improved stiffness and low hexane extractables content, among others. To illustrate these advantages, if the composition distribution was broad but not orthogonal, the hexane extractables content may be increased to unacceptable levels and the hot tack and heat seal initiation temperature may disadvantageously be increased. If the composition distribution was too narrow, the melting point may be decreased and the hot tack and heat seal initiation temperature may disadvantageously be increased.<br>
