				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparation of titanium<br>
carbonitride (TiCN) in thermal plasma. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for preparation of titanium carbonitride in extended/expanded arc plasma.<br>
Background and prior art of the invention<br>
The carbide and nitride of titanium are of practical interest because of their high hardness and excellent wear properties. The solid solution of these i.e. titanium carbonitride has been used in cutting tools, wear resistant materials, electrical resistors and abrasive for polishing. Titanium carbonitride based cermets have been successfully introduced in metal cutting industries compared to conventional hard metals at high cutting speeds, particularly in finishing and milling operations [A. Bellosi, R. Calzavarini, M.G. Faga, F. Monteverde, C. Zancol6, G.E. D'Errico, Journal of Materials Processing Technology 143-144 (2003) 527-532; P. Ettmayer, H. Kolaska.'f W. Lengauer &amp; K. Dreyert, Int. J. of Refractory metals &amp; Hard Materials 13 (1995) 343-35 1; A. Jha and S. J. Yoon; Journal of Materials Science 34 (1999) 307- 322]. Furthermore, titanium carbonitride exhibits enhanced thermal resistance and toughness and consequently, the use thereof is expanding steadily in the fields of, for example, sintered hard metals and heat resisting alloys.<br>
Conventional ways of preparation of titanium carbonitride (TiCN) are by reaction of the elemental/oxides/halides of titanium with carbon and nitrogen containing materials at high temperatures [C.F. Davidson et at. US patent No. 4,812,301, Mar. 14, 1989; S. D. Dunmead et al. US patent No. 5,756,410 May 26,1998; B. Kim et al. US patent No. 2004/0161379 Aug. 19, 2004; C.L. Yeh and Y.D. Chen, Ceramic International (2005) (article in press)]. The carbonitride can also be produced by reacting a mixture of TiC and TiN. The solid state diffusion of C, N or both into elemental or oxide powders at high temperatures where the reaction takes place over several hours to produce the desired product. The reactions are usually carried out in electrical resistance heated furnace [H.<br>
Zeiringer, US Patent No. 5,147,831 Sept. 15, 1992; A. Jha and S. J. Yoon; Journal of Materials Science 34 (1999) 307-322]. The titanium based halides when treated with carbon and nitrogen containing gases generate corrosive gases. The elemental powders and halides are expensive raw materials compared to the oxides of titanium. Thermal plasma has been used successfully for preparation of TiCN [P.C. Kong and E. Pfender, Plasma Processes, in Carbide, Nitride and Boride Materials synthesis and Processing (Ed. A.W. Weimer) Chapman and Hall, London, 1997, pp. 359-387]. Thermal plasma with high temperature and ionic species can reduce the reaction time considerably. However, DC and RF torch type plasma reactors used for this purpose are very expensive.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of titanium carbonitride (TiCN), which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art as detailed above.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of titanium carbonitride (TiCN) in a relatively inexpensive extended/expanded arc thermal plasma reactor.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for producing titanium carbonitride (TiCN) which comprises reacting a mixture of oxide of titanium and a carbonaceous material in nitrogen or ammonia plasma in extended/expanded arc plasma reactor.<br>
The present invention is illustrated in figure 1 of the drawing.<br>
Figure 1 represents a schematic of the plasma hearth, in accordance with the present invention for preparation of titanium carbonitride (TiCN).<br>
Two graphite electrodes [1, 7] are arranged in the vertical configuration in the pot type extended/expanded arc plasma reactor. The graphite crucible [5] is<br>
used as the hearth of the reactor and is connected to the bottom graphite electrode [7]. The crucible assembly constitutes the anode. The top graphite electrode [1], the cathode is having an axial hole to pass the plasma forming gas. The bottom electrode [1] and the crucible [5] is kept fixed and the formation and stabilization of the extended arc plasma is done by the movement of the top electrode [1], which is actuated by a rack and pinion mechanism.<br>
Initially both the electrodes were kept in contact with each other, and then the crucible was partially filled with the charge [3]. The charge is essentially an intimate mixture of oxide of titanium and a carbonaceous material. A graphite lid [2] with a central hole is kept as a cover on the graphite crucible. The plasma forming gas, a mixture of argon and a nitrogen containing gas such as nitrogen and ammonia, was injected to the reactants present in the graphite crucible[5] through the axial hole of the top electrode. Plasma forming gas and water for cooling of the electrodes were regulated. As soon as the power to the reactor was switched on, the top electrode was slowly pulled up after striking the arc to form extended/expanded arc plasma in the hearth. The arc current and voltage were regulated during the course of the experiment. Experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 1500 °C - 1800 °C. The plasma forming gas and the graphite lid [2] on the top of the graphite hearth [5] helps in maintaining desired atmosphere inside the hearth for preparation of titanium carbonitride (TiCN).<br>
The following examples are given by the way of illustration of the working of the invention in actual practice and therefore should not be read or construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE -1<br>
TiO2 powder (minimum assay 99.0%) and activated charcoal was mixed thoroughly with 5 % PVA solution, peletised and oven dried. The dried pellets were then charged in the plasma. Initially both the electrodes were kept in contact with each other, and then the hearth was partially filled with the pellets. A<br>
graphite lid with a central hole was kept as a cover on the graphite crucible. The Plasma forming gas, a mixture of argon and ammonia was introduced through the axial hole of the top electrode. As soon as the power to the reactor was switched on, the top electrode was slowly pulled up after striking the arc to form extended/expanded arc plasma in the hearth. The arc current and voltage were regulated during the course of the experiment. The experimental conditions are as follows:<br>
Titanium dioxide	- 80 g<br>
Active carbon	- 40 g<br>
Argon	-1 Ipm<br>
Ammonia	- 6 Ipm<br>
Arc Current	- 300 A<br>
Load voltage	- 50 V<br>
Time	- 20 min<br>
The product was found to be titanium carbonitride (TiCN) from the XRD analysis. No peak for titanium dioxide or sub-oxides was observed, suggesting complete conversion of TiO2 to TiCN.<br>
EXAMPLE -2<br>
A homogenous mixture of TiO2 and activated carbon was taken as charge and the experiment was carried out as described in Example - 1. Charge composition was same as Example - 1, but the power condition was varied by changing arc current from 300 A to 350 A. Duration of the experiment was changed from 20 minutes to 15 minutes. The experimental conditions are as follows<br>
Titanium dioxide     - 80 g<br>
Active carbon	- 40 g<br>
Argon	-1 Ipm<br>
Ammonia	- 6 Ipm<br>
Arc Current	- 350 A<br>
Load voltage	- 50 V<br>
Time	-15min<br>
The XRD analysis confirmed the product to be carbonitride (TiCN). The presence of f titanium dioxide or sub-oxides was not observed.<br>
EXAMPLE -3<br>
A homogenous mixture of TiO2 and activated carbon was taken as charge and the experiment was carried out as described in Example-1. Quantity of charge was varied from 80 g of TiOa to 100 g TiO2 and active carbon from 40 g to 50 g. The experimental conditions are as follows<br>
Titanium dioxide	-100 g<br>
Active carbon	- 50 g<br>
Argon	-1 Ipm<br>
Ammonia	- 8 Ipm<br>
Arc Current	- 300 A<br>
Load voltage	- 60 V<br>
Time	- 20 min<br>
The product was found to be titanium carbide (TiCN) from the XRD analysis. Here again, TiO2 and tiatanium sub-oxides peaks were not observed in the XRD pattern.<br>
EXAMPLE -4<br>
A homogenous mixture of TiO2 and activated carbon was taken as charge and the experiment was carried out as described in Example-1. However, a mixture argon and nitrogen was taken as plasma forming gas and nitriding gas. The experimental conditions are as follows<br>
Titanium dioxide	- 80 g<br>
Active carbon	- 45 g<br>
Argon	-1 Ipm<br>
Nitrogen	- 6 Ipm<br>
Arc Current	- 300 A<br>
Load voltage	- 55 V<br>
Time	-15min<br>
The XRD analysis reveals the product to be titanium nitride (TiCN) without any peak of TiO2 and tiatanium sub-oxides.<br>
