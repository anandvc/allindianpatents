				<td>REINFORCED WALLBOARD<br>
RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/425,924, filed November 12,2002, the entire disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
(0002] The field of the invention is wallboards for use in construction,<br>
including paper-covered wallboard, paperless wallboard, sheathing board,<br>
moisture resistant board, type-X board, insulation board, shaft liner, soffit board,<br>
backing board, core board, ceiling board, gypsum glass mat board and a method<br>
of manufacturing such wallboards.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] A modified cellulose, also referred to herein as a cellulose<br>
derivative, is used in plaster and joint compounds as a thickener (or to modify the<br>
rheology in some way) and to improve the workability of gypsum-based<br>
compounds. Cellulose ethers have been known to improve some other<br>
properties, including the consistency, adhesion and water retention of gypsum-<br>
based joint compounds and tile adhesives. However, some of these properties,<br>
specifically thickening, are not considered beneficial for the production of<br>
wallboard. Wallboard is formed from a slurry that is continuously mixed and fed<br>
onto a belt. Thus, it is desirable for the slurry used to make wallboard to be<br>
thinner than a plaster.<br>
[0004] Typically, a small amount, e.g. less than 0.25 wt%, of cellulose<br>
ethers is added to the dry ingredients of plaster or joint compound, which may be<br>
limestone-based rather than gypsum-based, prior to mixing with water. This<br>
tends to improve the strength of the plaster or joint compound somewhat, as well<br><br>
as providing the desired thickening. However, additions of cellulose ethers<br>
greater than 0.25 wt%, particularly at high viscosity grade (the viscosity of an<br>
aqueous solution of the cellulose ether measured at a 2 wt% concentration of the<br>
cellulose ether in water), tend to reduce the strength of gypsum-based products.<br>
See Udo Ludwig and N.B. Singh, Il Cemento, v.1 (1979) 39-50, and Felix Brandt<br>
and Dirk Basbach, Journal of Crystal Growth, v.233 (2001) 837-845, reporting<br>
that the addition of high viscosity grades of cellulose ethers, for example methyl<br>
cellulose, adversely affects the development of gypsum crystals and strength.<br>
Thus, larger additions of cellulose ethers are usually avoided in commercial<br>
plasters.<br>
[0005] Wallboard, which is used herein to also designate such<br>
products as sheathing board, moisture resistant board, type-X board, insulation<br>
board, shaft liner, soffit board, backing board, core board, ceiling board, gypsum<br>
glass mat board, and paperless wallboard, is typically prepared by mixing<br>
dehydrated inorganic materials such as calcined gypsum or stucco with water and<br>
pouring the resulting slurry into molds, forms or sheets where it hydrates,<br>
hardens and dries. Calcined gypsum powder (calcium sulfate hemihydrate and/or<br>
calcium sulfate anhydrite) is usually mixed with water and less than 1 wt% of a<br>
variety of additives, for example accelerants. Dissolution of the calcined gypsum<br>
powder in the water and a resulting hydration reaction causes crystallization of<br>
gypsum crystals (calcium sulfate dihydrate) forming the wallboard core.<br>
Application of multi-ply face sheets is usually integrated with the formation of<br>
the wallboard core. This is often followed by mild heating to drive off the<br>
remaining free (unreacted) water to yield a dry product, having face sheets<br>
adhered to gypsum core.<br>
[0006] Lukevich et al. (WO 99/54265) discloses a method to produce<br>
formed gypsum products by extrusion of an a-gypsum paste (using a-calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate). It is known that a-gypsum is slow setting and drying;<br>
therefore, Lukevich et al. prepares an extrudable paste using a nearly<br>
stoichiometric combination of a-gypsum plaster and water; however, addition of<br>
a clay rheology modifier and a methyl cellulose binder are added to reduce<br>
friability (page 1, paragraph 4). The resulting composition is an extrudable paste<br>
having near stoichiometric composition of water and a-gypsum and not a slurry.<br>
[0007] Thus, Lukevich et al. teaches away from using P-calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate, which requires an excess of water over and above the<br>
stoichiometric limits taught by Lukevich, to form a slurry that can be extruded<br>
and requiring a step of drying (page 1, paragraph 3). Additionally, the extrusion<br>
of the nearly dry, non-fluid paste, containing clay as a rheology modifier and a<br>
cellulose ether as a binder, results in a plaster product with a much greater<br>
density and vastly different microstructure than a wallboard core prepared using<br>
a slurry of p-calcium sulfate hemihydrate and water.<br>
[0008] Morris et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,482,551, which issued January 9,<br>
1996, disclose a gypsum-based, extruded construction material with a high<br>
modulus of rupture and a method of extrusion processing of the construction<br>
material. Morris et al. teach a formulation having a low fraction of water to dry<br>
ingredients, including gypsum, clay, perlite, a powdered ethyl cellulose<br>
binder/rheology aid and fiberized cellulose paper, such that the mixture is a<br>
crumbly, semi-dry extrudable composition that maximizes the wet modulus of<br>
rupture. Morris et al. teach that an extruded wall panel must have a high enough<br>
wet strength to be self supporting.<br>
[0009] However, the extruded construction material of Morris et al.,<br>
like that of Lukevich, is too dense to be used commercially as wallboard. Even<br>
with substantial inclusions of lightweight perlite (16% by weight of the dry<br>
ingredients) and near the maximum ratio of water:gypsum allowed by Morris et<br>
al. (0.8), the density of the product was still 54.8 pcf (0.88 g/cc). Typical<br>
densities were about 69 pcf (1.1 g/cc). These densities are unacceptable for<br>
production of commercial wallboard, because the added weight of the wallboard<br>
adds significantly to higher transportation, handling, and installation costs<br>
compared to conventional wallboard.<br>
[0010] Gypsum-based wallboard is used primarily as inexpensive and<br>
easily formable coverings with adequate compressive strength, nail pull<br>
resistance, flexural strength and good fire resistance. However, even<br>
conventional gypsum-based wallboard products are heavy compared to other<br>
modern building materials, and this extra weight adds to the cost of production,<br>
delivery, installation and disposal of gypsum-based construction materials<br>
compared to competing products. Thus, it is desirable to retain the beneficial<br>
qualities of gypsum-based wallboard while reducing the overall cost of installed<br>
wallboard sheets by reducing the weight of gypsum-based wallboard.<br>
[0011] Also, strength of conventional wallboard is related primarily to<br>
the strength of the facing paper, typically an oriented fiber, multi-ply facing<br>
paper that is applied to the gypsum-based slurry, which forms the core of the<br>
wallboard, during a continuous forming process. For a 1/2 inch wallboard with a<br>
density of about 0.6 g/cc, approximately one-half of the nail pull resistance and<br>
two-thirds of the flexural strength are supplied by the paper face sheets, which<br>
also account for 40% of the manufacturing costs. The core is usually<br>
exceptionally poor at handling tensile loads of any kind.<br>
[0012] Others have reduced the weight of the core further by adding<br>
porosity and/or a low-density, expanded filler (e.g. perlite) into the conventional<br>
material. Adding such porosity or filler decreases the density of the core, but<br>
also reduces the strength of the wallboard. The strength of gypsum sheets<br>
decreases dramatically with density. For example, a dramatic decrease of the<br>
nail-pull resistance with density of 1/2-inch gypsum wallboard, both papered and<br>
non-papered, can be seen in Fig. 3.<br>
{0013] Typically, the rate of loss in strength is not merely proportional<br>
with the reduction in density, but instead the strength-to-weight ratio of the<br>
wallboard core decreases with the addition of porosity and/or low-density filler,<br>
such as perlite, compared to that of a fully dense gypsum wallboard core. The<br>
resulting flexural strength of the wallboard may be acceptable, so long as the<br>
strength of the multiply facing is sufficient to offset any weakening of the core,<br>
and the reduced core density does not cause the failure mode to change from<br>
tensile failure of the facing to crushing of the core. However, nail pull resistance<br>
of the wallboard is reduced by addition of such porosity, because increasing<br>
porosity rapidly reduces the resistance of the core to crushing and densification.<br>
Therefore, the nail pull resistance of the wallboard, which depends greatly on the<br>
nail pull resistance of the core, becomes the limiting criterion for wallboard with<br>
low-density cores covered by face sheets. For paperless wallboard core, the<br>
flexural strength may be the limiting failure criterion, because unreinforced<br>
gypsum wallboard cores have little, if any, resistance to the tensile load<br>
components in the flexural strength test.<br>
[0014] Another way of compensating for the introduction of lower<br>
density substitutes (e.g., expanded perlite or air voids) for part of the set gypsum<br>
matrix is to increase the strength of the set gypsum above normal levels in order<br>
to maintain overall core strength. A number of additives, such as cellulosic<br>
particles and fibers, have been included to further improve the mechanical<br>
properties of cementitious products. More expensive glass fibers are used in<br>
place of wood in applications where high fire resistance is required, such as the<br>
shaft liner for elevators. However, conventional fibers, particularly glass, do not<br>
adhere well to the gypsum matrix and decrease the workability of the gypsum<br>
slurry, thus limiting possible improvements to the core strength. Glass fibers are<br>
also brittle and can be easily dislodged during board handling, installation, or<br>
demolition to cause irritation of the skin or respiratory tract.<br>
{0015] More recently, there has been increasing interest in improving<br>
the strength and wear resistance of construction materials by incorporating<br>
polymers and/or starches into the core material, although starches are not<br>
generally considered strength enhancers. Cementitious composites containing<br>
water-dispersible polymers having modest improvement in strength-to-weight<br>
have been found by adding latex or other strengthening polymers to the<br>
cementitious materials.<br>
[0016] However, several unique challenges have thus far restricted the<br>
commercialization of polymer reinforced cementitious products to relatively<br>
expensive niche products. For example, the nail pull resistance may decrease<br>
with the addition of some organic additives or an increase in nail pull resistance<br>
may require concentrations of polymers greater than 5 wt%, which can lead to<br>
problems such as inflammability, reduced extinguishability, commercially<br>
unacceptable cost of the wallboard, and mold susceptibility. Therefore, there is a<br>
longstanding and unresolved need for an additive that can increase both the nail<br>
pull resistance and the flexural strength of wallboard core, allowing the core<br>
density to be reduced.<br>
[0017] Cellulose is a polysaccharide composed of individual<br>
anhydroglucose units which are linked through a glycosidic bond (Figure 16).<br>
The number V of anhydroglucose units in the polymer chain is defined as the<br>
degree of polymerisation. Typically, production of cellulose ethers (CE's)<br>
involves replacing some of the hydroxyl hydrogen groups of cellulose with a<br>
substituent group, for example a methyl group, an ethyl group, a carboxymethyl<br>
group, a hydroxyehthyl group, a hydroxypropyl group, or some combination<br>
thereof. For example, a hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose (HEMC) may be<br>
produced by replacing some of the groups of cellulose with hydroxyethyl groups<br>
and methyl groups. Likewise, a hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) may<br>
be produced with hydroxypropyl and methyl groups replacing some of the<br>
hydroxyl groups of the cellulose.<br>
[00181 The number of substituted hydroxyl groups per anhydroglucose<br>
unit is expressed as the degree of substitution (DS). The DS can vary between 0<br>
and 3. As with all polymer reactions, this reaction does not occur uniformly<br>
along the polymer chain. The reported degree of substitution is therefore a mean<br>
degree of substitution over the whole polymer chain. Alternatively, molar<br>
substitution (MS) may be used to report the number of moles of substituent<br>
groups, such as a hydroxypropyl group, per mole of anhydroglucose. Often,<br>
manufacturers follow a convention whereby one of the substituents is reported by<br>
DS and the other by MS, where the substituent reported by MS may replace a<br>
hydroxyl group or may attach to another substituent in a chain. The DS is not<br>
always reported, and we have found that the value reported is often inaccurate or<br>
given as a broad range, as shown in Table I.<br>
[0019] In another alternative, the weight percent of substituents is<br>
reported. Weight percent of substituents may be directly related to DS and MS.<br>
For example, the following equations show the conversion for HPMC:<br>
[0020] Cellulose ethers are conventionally differentiated by type of<br>
substituent and the viscosity of an aqueous solution of the cellulose ether. For<br>
example methyl cellulose (MC), ethyl cellulose (EC), carboxymethyl cellulose<br>
(CMC), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose (EHEC),<br>
ethyl hydroxypropyl cellulose (EHPC) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) are<br>
named for the type of substituent group used to replace the hydroxyl group in<br>
cellulose. The viscosity of an aqueous solution including a cellulose ether is an<br>
important characteristic for its typical use as a thickener; therefore, cellulose<br>
ethers are also differentiated by viscosity, which depends on the degree of<br>
polymerization (directly related to the measured molecular weight), and the type<br>
and degree of substitution of substituent groups. As the molecular weight<br>
increases, the viscosity of an aqueous solution of the cellulose ether increases<br>
also. However, the effect of the degree of substitution depends on the particular<br>
type of substituent group, which may also effect the solubility of the cellulose<br>
ether.<br>
[00211 Manufacturers characterize the effect of a particular cellulose<br>
ether on the viscosity by reporting the measured viscosity of a 2 wt% aqueous<br>
solution of the cellulose ether. Herein, we refer to this 2 wt% viscosity as the<br>
viscosity grade of the particular cellulose ether. Typically, the viscosity grade is<br>
measured by one of two techniques: Brookfield and Ubbelohde. Often, the<br>
measured viscosity grade differs between the two techniques. For example,<br>
results using both techniques are shown in Table I for some cellulose ethers.<br>
[0022] Cellulose ethers are not typically used in wallboard products,<br>
but may be used at low molecular weights (low viscosity) and low concentrations<br>
to provide proper water retention, pumpabiliry and/or increase mixing blade life.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0023] A wallboard core comprises water, P-calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate and an additive, which are mixed together to form the wallboard<br>
core. Herein, the term wallboard is used to also designate such products as<br>
sheathing board, moisture resistant board, type-X board, insulation board, shaft<br>
liner, soffit board, backing board, core board, ceiling board, gypsum glass mat<br>
board, and paperless wallboard, which may be used to finish walls and ceilings in<br>
the construction industry.<br>
[0024] Upon mixing with the water, the P-calcium sulfate hemihydrate<br>
may dissolve or partially dissolve in the water and hydrates, over time, forming<br>
gypsum crystals. The additive is selected from one or more cellulose ethers<br>
having, for example, a molecular weight of at least 20,000 and a viscosity grade<br>
of at least 100 cps, such as HPC, HEC, MC, HPMC, EHEC, EHPC and HEMC,<br>
without limiting in any way to those listed here, increasing both the nail pull<br>
resistance and flexural strength of the wallboard core. Preferably, the weight<br>
percent of cellulose ether to P-calcium sulfate hemihydrate is selected to be less<br>
than 5 wt%, more preferably less than 3 wt%, whereby the cellulose ether has a<br>
negligible effect on the inflamability and extinguishability of the wallboard.<br>
Even more preferably, the weight percent is selected from 0.5 wt%, alternatively<br>
from 0.5 - 3 wt%, for cellulose ethers that show a continuously increasing nail<br>
pull resistance from 0.5 wt% to 3 wt%, which greatly simplifies the mixing<br>
process. Alternatively, a cellulose ether with a low degree of substitution (DS) is<br>
chosen.<br>
[0025] The increased nail pull resistance and flexural strength<br>
imparted to the reinforced wallboard core makes it possible to reduce or<br>
eliminate the costly and heavy multi-ply paper surfaces of the wallboard. The<br>
multi-ply paper facing can also increase the undesirable mold susceptibility of<br>
wallboard by feeding mold growth after absorbing water from the surrounding<br>
environment. Thus, a mold resistant wallboard may be fabricated using a<br>
reduced paper wallboard core that is strengthened by a cellulose ether additive.<br>
Although paper is a cellulose, cellulose derivatives, such as cellulose ethers, do<br>
not tend to feed mold growth when added to the wallboard core, as shown by<br>
mold resistance tests of specimen maintained at 32 degrees C in an incubator<br>
with 90% humidity and in the presence of mold spores. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, a skim layer is added to at least one surface provides even greater<br>
mold resistance. There is a longstanding and unresolved need for low cost<br>
wallboard having such mold resistance.<br>
[0026] A lightweight wallboard, for example with a conventional<br>
multi-ply facing sheet or sheets, may be fabricated by reducing the density of the<br>
wallboard core without sacrificing the nail pull resistance of the wallboard. For<br>
example, the density may be reduced below 0.75 g/cc using a lightweight filler or<br>
by introducing porosity into the core in the form of voids or air bubbles while<br>
maintaining the flexural strength and nail pull resistance of the wallboard.<br>
[0027] Addition of an excess amount of water to the slurry, over and<br>
above the stoichiometric amount of water needed to hydrate the powdered dry<br>
ingredients, reduces the density of the wallboard core. It is believed, without<br>
being limiting in any way, that the excess water forms droplets in the wallboard<br>
core that, after drying, remain in the wallboard core as pores. A general,<br>
empirical correlation has been found for predicting the wallboard density in g/cc<br>
(p) with the water to powdered dry ingredient ratio (W:P), if foaming is<br>
negligible: p = 0.8324(W:P)-07629. The addition of foaming, whether by rapid<br>
stirring or addition of a foaming agent, may further reduce the density by<br>
introducing porosity into the wallboard core in addition to the amount introduced<br>
by the excess water.<br>
[0028] By adding additional water to the slurry, viscosity of the slurry<br>
is reduced. Thus, a slurry containing substantially no clay may be extruded in a<br>
continuous extrusion process, forming lightweight, reinforced wallboard. By<br>
substantially no clay, it is meant that no clay is added to the dry ingredients as a<br>
rheology modifier. Of course, clay may be present as an impurity in the dry<br>
ingredients or the water at a level that does not significantly affect the rheology<br>
of the extrusion process.<br>
[0029] One method of producing the wallboard core mixes dry<br>
ingredients comprising ß-calcium sulfate hemihydrate powder and a powdered<br>
additive selected from cellulose ethers other than CMC, the cellulose ether being<br>
selected to have a degree of substitution (DS) that is soluble in water (e.g. from<br>
1.2 to 2.4 for MC). For commercially available cellulose ethers, having a range<br>
of DS from 1.6 to 1.9, for example, a viscosity grade of at least about 100 cps<br>
and a molecular weight of at least about 20,000 MW is preferred.<br>
[0030] For a high degree of substitution (DS), e.g. greater than 1.8 for<br>
methyl cellulose (MC), a higher viscosity grade (e.g. at least about 200 cps) is<br>
preferred. Surprisingly, a higher DS is associated with a lower nail pull<br>
resistance for cellulose ethers, such as MC. Thus, a low DS (e.g. in a range from<br>
1.2 to 1.8 for MC) is preferred, because a lower viscosity grade cellulose ether<br>
may be selected or a lower fraction of the cellulose ether additive may be added,<br>
while still achieving the same nail pull resistance. By lowering the viscosity<br>
grade, the slurry becomes easier to mix, given the same amount of water. By<br>
lowering the amount of water, the wallboard dries quicker, given the same slurry<br>
viscosity. By lowering the fraction of cellulose additive in the slurry, the<br>
manufacturing cost of the wallboard is decreased.<br>
[0031] Thus, a range of DS from 1.2 to 1.6 for MC is even more<br>
preferred, for example. Although MC is not available commercially in this range,<br>
the surprising and unexpected correlations for such low DS cellulose ethers,<br>
providing greatly enhanced flexural strength and nail pull resistance, the low cost<br>
of manufacturing such cellulose ethers, and the high volumes of MC to be used<br>
in reinforced wallboard manufacture is expected to drive the development of<br>
commercial grades of MC in this Tange of DS.<br>
10032] In another embodiment, it is preferable to select a viscosity<br>
grade of at least about 400 cps. Surprisingly, by selecting a cellulose ether<br>
greater than this viscosity grade, the nail pull resistance of the resulting<br>
wallboard core increases significantly compared to unreinforced wallboard core<br>
for additions of from 0.5 wt% to 3 wt% of all cellulose ethers tested, except for<br>
CMC, so long as the cellulose ether is well dispersed throughout the p-calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate prior to adding to water, even at relatively high DS. At low<br>
DS, the correlations show that nail pull index and flexural strength index are<br>
dramatically increased compared to any conventional wallboard.<br>
[0033] An amount of water may be selected to form a slurry with the<br>
dry ingredients that results in a finished wallboard core density of 0.75 g/cc after<br>
extrusion, setting and drying in an oven at 45 oC until the density remains<br>
constant. In addition, many other additives, including other cellulose ethers may<br>
be added to tailor the properties of the wallboard core without diminishing the<br>
nail pull resistance and strength of the wallboard core.<br>
[0034] In one embodiment, these dry ingredients may be well mixed to<br>
thoroughly disperse the additive throughout the P-calcium sulfate hemihydrate<br>
powder. Then, the dry ingredients are added to and mixed with the water, poured<br>
onto a form, formed into a sheet, allowed to set, dried and trimmed. The amount<br>
of water selected will always be in excess of the amount needed for extrusion and<br>
for the amount of water required for a stoichiometric combination of the p-<br>
calcium sulfate hemihydrate and water to form gypsum. Preferably, the amount<br>
of water is selected to produce a wallboard core with a density less than 0.8 g/cc,<br>
more preferably less than 0.75 g/cc, even more preferably in a range from 0.45<br>
g/cc to 0.7 g/cc for lightweight wallboard.<br>
[0035] By a "slurry," it is meant that the mixture of dry ingredients<br>
and water forms a homogeneous fluid that can be well mixed, dissolving at least<br>
a portion of the P-calcium sulfate hemihydrate in the water prior to extruding the<br>
slurry. The amount of water required depends, for example, on the amount of ß-<br>
calcium sulfate hemihydrate, the amount of additive and other dry ingredients, as<br>
well as the temperature and the type of additive or additives included in the<br>
slurry. The amount of water used significantly alters the microstructure of the<br>
wallboard core, for example by affecting the amount of porosity, the extent of<br>
dissolution of the P-calcium sulfate hemihydrate, the rate of hydration and the<br>
morphology of the gypsum crystals, which in turn affects the nail pull resistance<br>
and flexural strength of the wallboard. A foam may be added to the slurry,<br>
instead of adding additional water, in order to reduce the density to a preferred<br>
range for a specific application. For example, a foaming agent, such as a<br>
surfactant or chemically active foaming agent, may be added in the water and/or<br>
the slurry to cause foam during stirring of the water and/or slurry. Adding a<br>
foam may result in a shorter drying time and/or a more preferable distribution of<br>
the porosity than a process that would produce a wallboard with an equivalent<br>
density by merely increasing the amount of water. Alternatively, a low density<br>
filler may be added.<br>
[0036] The process may be a continuous process, whereby the dry<br>
ingredients are mixed, added to the water, blended into a slurry and the slurry is<br>
poured onto a moving surface to form the wallboard core. A form may both<br>
contain the slurry and form the two edges of the wallboard, while one or more<br>
rolls or restrictions spread and flatten the free surface of the slurry, whereby an<br>
elongated, continuous sheet is formed. Following forming of the continuous<br>
wallboard core, the end of the elongated sheet of slurry, after being allowed to set<br>
at least partially, is cut into lengths from the rest of the elongated, continuous<br>
sheet. Then, the wallboard is trimmed if necessary and dried. Alternatively, one<br>
or more facing sheets may be added during the process on one or both sides of<br>
the wallboard core.<br>
[0037] Another method of producing the wall board mixes a<br>
strengthening additive with the water before mixing with the powdered P-<br>
calcium sulfate hemihydrate. In this method, the additive, whether dry, paste, gel<br>
or liquid, is at least partially dissolved in the water. Then, the dry ingredients,<br>
including the ß-calcium sulfate hemihydrate and optionally other dry additional<br>
additives, are added to and mixed with the aqueous solution to form a slurry.<br>
The slurry is then processed as before.<br>
[0038] One or more paper layers may be adhered to one or both sides<br>
of the wallboard core or facing sheets, for example for decorative purposes<br>
and/or to impart improved strength. The paper may have fibers, which may be<br>
oriented to strengthen the wallboard in a preferred direction. Alternatively, no<br>
paper layers may be added or a non-paper layer may be adhered to one or both<br>
sides of the wallboard core. In yet another alternative, a second additive may be<br>
included in the dry ingredients that segregates to one or both surfaces of the<br>
wallboard, forming an in situ surface layer on the wallboard.<br>
[0039] "At least about" 100 cps means that cellulose ether should be<br>
selected from cellulose ethers having a viscosity grade of about 100 cps or<br>
greater, and "about" 100 cps should be understood to take into consideration<br>
normal variations in commercial measurements of the viscosity grade, based for<br>
example on the use of different measurement techniques. For example, differing<br>
selection of shear rate for measuring viscosity grade may cause variations in the<br>
measured value. A. variation of as much as 30% from the viscosity grade<br>
reported by manufacturers is to be expected at low viscosity grades up to 1000<br>
cps. Viscosity grades greater than about 1000 cps show an even greater variation<br>
in the viscosity grade.<br>
[0040] "At least about" 20,000 MW means that cellulose ether should<br>
be selected from cellulose ethers having a molecular weight of "about" 20,000 or<br>
greater. It should be understood that the mean value of the molecular weight for<br>
a specific type of commercial cellulose ether with a specific degree of<br>
substitution may be 20,000, but that variations between batches and variations<br>
within a batch allow for significant commercial variances in the mean and<br>
standard deviation from the mean of the molecular weight. Typically, the mean<br>
molecular weight may vary by as much as 20% from the manufacturer's<br>
specification. The standard deviation within a batch depends, for example, on<br>
manufacturing tolerances, the process chosen to manufacture a particular<br>
cellulose ether, and the variations already present in the raw cellulose prior to<br>
substitution.<br>
[0041] A nail pull index and flexural strength index are presented<br>
herein that normalize the measurements of nail pull resistance and flexural<br>
strength for wallboard and ceiling board specimens having a spectrum of board<br>
weights by comparing the strength measurements to the strength of specimens<br>
prepared without a strengthening additive at the same wallboard weight and<br>
thickness. For example, the nail pull resistance versus board weight for<br>
conventional wallboard is shown in Fig. 3 for specimens with and without paper.<br>
The nail putt index, as shown in Fig. 5 for some embodiments, is a comparative<br>
measure nail pull resistance of a reinforced specimen to a conventional specimen<br>
at the same density (board weight). Therefore, a nail pull index of 1.0 means that<br>
a reinforced wallboard specimen has the same nail pull resistance as a specimen<br>
prepared conventionally without reinforcing additions.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0061] A reinforced wallboard and/or ceiling board comprises a<br>
calcium sulfate hemihydrate, a reinforcing additive and water. The calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate is preferably ß-calcium sulfate hemihydrate and may be<br>
produced by calcining gypsum, for example. The reinforcing additive is<br>
dispersable in water and may be produced and used in various forms, such as<br>
aqueous solutions, granules and powders. For example, one reinforcing additive<br>
is a cellulose ether. Cellulose ethers may be used with a wide variety of<br>
substituent groups. For example, HPC, HEC, MC, HPMC, EHEC, EHPC and<br>
HEMC may be used as the reinforcing additive.<br>
[0062] In one embodiment, dry ß- calcium sulfate hemihydrate<br>
powder and powdered HPMC are mixed together, dispersing the powdered<br>
HPMC additive throughout the P-calcium sulfate hemihydrate powder. The dry<br>
ingredients are then added to water, including an excess of water beyond that<br>
required to hydrate the ß-calcium sulfate hemihydrate stoichiometrically,<br>
forming a slurry by stirring of the powder/water mixture. For example, the<br>
amount of water used is selected such that the finished wallboard has a density<br>
less than 0.8 g/cc, more preferably less than 0.75 g/cc. Then, the slurry is<br>
extruded through a die or a form or a series of dies and forms. The extruded<br>
slurry is then fed onto a belt into a continuous sheet. The slurry is allowed to<br>
harden, which is also referred to as setting and is a result of the P-calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate at least partially dissolving and hydrating, forming calcium sulfate<br>
dihydrate crystals, referred to herein as gypsum crystals.<br>
[0063] Then, the setting wallboard or wallboard specimen is dried.<br>
Air drying or drying in a furnace evaporates the excess water that has not reacted<br>
during hydration, but that is required to form a slurry. Excess water also tends to<br>
increase the amount of porosity dried wallboard core, because the evaporation of<br>
the excess water leaves behind porous microstructure. The sheets may then be<br>
trimmed, sized, weighed and tested.<br>
[0064] Tests include measuring the nail pull resistance, flexural<br>
strength, humidified deflection, mold resistance, and inflamability, for example<br>
using ASTM standard test procedures. Mold resistance is defined as showing no<br>
signs of mold growth on a wallboard or wallboard core surface after 24 days of<br>
exposure to mold spores within an environment maintained at 90% humidity and<br>
a temperature of 32 °C.<br>
[0065] Preferably, the cellulose ethers used as additives to the<br>
wallboard slurry have a high molecular weight, which is associated with a high<br>
viscosity grade. Surprisingly, both nail pull resistance and flexural strength are<br>
greatly increased for specific cellulose ethers at particular molecular weights and<br>
viscosity grades, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Also, it is very surprising that both<br>
nail pull index and flexural strength index increase rapidly with increasing<br>
molecular weight and viscosity grade for some cellulose ethers, for example as<br>
shown in Figs. 7 and 15. This contradicts the earlier expectations of others in the<br>
field that relied on data from specimens prepared using stucco slurries using<br>
relatively low molecular weight additives, slurries of CMC, which do not show<br>
increasing nail pull resistance with weight fractions above about 0.25 wt%, and<br>
slurries prepared using processing methods that did not effectively disperse the<br>
cellulose ether powders. Furthermore, the present invention contradicts those<br>
references that indicated that high viscosity grades would weaken the gypsum<br>
crystal strength.<br>
[0066] Specimens of high molecular weight and high viscosity grade<br>
HPMC reinforced wallboard and HEMC reinforced wallboard have the greatest<br>
value of nail pull index of those tested, as shown in Fig. 1. Other embodiments<br>
show greatly improved nail pull index, as well, especially using high viscosity<br>
grade cellulose ethers.<br>
[0067] However, the results for low molecular weight cellulose ethers<br>
was disappointing, as shown in Fig. 6 and 14. As concentration of the cellulose<br>
ethers increased, the nail pull resistance decreased for low molecular weight<br>
cellulose ethers. Degradation of important properties with continued addition of<br>
an additive is highly disfavored in commercial processing, especially for an<br>
additive with a low overall weight fraction compared to other ingredients.<br>
[0068] During a mixing process, increasing the weight fraction of the<br>
additive in the mixture is accomplished by merely adding more of the additive to<br>
a batch or continuous stream of the mixture. However, it is problematic to dilute<br>
the weight fraction of additive once too much additive is mixed with the base<br>
material, because it requires mixing large quantities of the base material, in this<br>
case ß-calcium sulfate hemihydrate, into a mixture of additive and base material<br>
to dilute the weight fraction of additive. Thus, it is desirable for a robust mixing<br>
process to be able to allow an excess of additive without adversely affecting the<br>
properties of the finished product. Therefore, using an additive that continuously<br>
improves the properties of the product even with an inadvertent addition of<br>
excess additive is preferred. Even though the low molecular weight additives<br>
initially increase the nail pull resistance up to 0.25 wt%, the sharp decrease in<br>
properties with continued addition over a percent weight of 0.25 wt% makes<br>
them impractical for use in many commercial processes.<br>
[0069] Fig. 5 shows that for high molecular weight and high viscosity<br>
HPMC, HEMC, and HEC, the nail pull resistance increases logarithmically with<br>
the weight fraction of additive. This is a highly desirable trend, making for a<br>
robust and forgiving manufacturing process. 400 cps MC shows a linear increase<br>
in nail pull resistance with weight fraction of additive, which is also desirable.<br>
[0070] CMC is one of the most commonly used cellulose ethers, but,<br>
in the absence of other cellulose ethers, CMC greatly retards setting time and<br>
reduces nail pull resistance and flexural strength compared to unreinforced<br>
specimens. As mentioned previously CMC does not increase the strength of<br>
wallboard at the concentrations, high molecular weights and viscosities that are<br>
effective for the other cellulose ethers. It is believed, without being limiting in<br>
any way, that other cellulose ethers tend to have molecular interactions via<br>
hydrogen bonding. Thus, it is believed that the high molecular weight molecules<br>
tend to be immobilized and do not segregate to the drying surfaces of the<br>
wallboard, as some other soluble polymers do. Therefore, high molecular weight<br>
molecules, having substantial hydrogen bonding interactions, remain dispersed<br>
throughout the wallboard core and reinforce the matrix of hydrated gypsum<br>
crystals.<br>
[0071] A surface treatment may coat the cellulose ethers to delay the<br>
onset of dissolution, which would be expected to improve dispersion of the<br>
cellulose ethers in water. However, it is believed that, in practice, the delay in<br>
dissolution caused by the surface treatment results in incomplete dissolution of<br>
the surface treated cellulose ethers. Iodine stain tests showed that cellulose<br>
ethers that were surface treated did not disperse evenly throughout the wallboard<br>
specimen, especially for HEC surface-treated powders, while both untreated<br>
cellulose ethers and surface treated cellulose ethers that were pre-dissolved<br>
showed complete and even dispersion throughout the wallboard. One method of<br>
improving dispersion of untreated and surface-treated powdered cellulose ethers<br>
was to pre-mix the dry cellulose ethers until the powders were well dispersed<br>
with the dry ß-calcium sulfate hemihydrate before adding the mixture to water.<br>
Thereby, the agglomeration of the cellulose ethers was reduced and dissolution<br>
occurred more readily than for agglomerated particles.<br>
[00721 The nail pull index of surface treated cellulose ethers was less<br>
than the nail pull index of either pre-dissolved, surface treated cellulose ethers or<br>
untreated cellulose ethers, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, and as shown against<br>
weight fraction, for example in Fig. 11 for HPMC with a viscosity grade of<br>
45,000 cps (45 kcps) and in Fig. 13 for HEC with a molecular weight of 1.3<br>
million (1.3M).<br>
[0073] The ftexural strength is not affected as greatly by incomplete<br>
dissolution, as shown versus weight fraction in Fig. 12 for HPMC at 45 kcps. It<br>
is believed that the difference between the effects in nail pull index and flexural<br>
strength index is due to the fact that nail pull index is sensitive to crushing of the<br>
specimen core, while the flexural strength index is less sensitive to crushing of<br>
the specimen of the core (distributed stresses).<br>
[0074] Fig. 8 shows the minimum board weight projected for meeting<br>
ASTM standards versus viscosity grade of wallboard specimens prepared with a<br>
weight percent of HPMC additive to ß-calcium sulfate hemihydrate of 1 wt%.<br>
As the viscosity grade increases the minimum board weight that is required to<br>
pass ASTM standards decreases. It should be understood that any additional<br>
reinforcements, such as fiber reinforcements, that are added to the slurry can also<br>
increase the strength, particularly the flexural strength, of the wallboard. This<br>
would also tend to reduce the minimum board weight required to pass ASTM<br>
standards. For example, it is common practice to incorporate cellulose fibers into<br>
the wallboard core. Other fiber reinforcements, such as glass, polymer and<br>
carbon fibers, may also be added to increase the flexural strength of the<br>
wallboard core. In one specific embodiment, short polyester fibers or nylon<br>
fibers or both are mixed into the dry ingredients prior to adding the dry<br>
ingredients to water to increase the flexural strength. Longer fibers can be<br>
introduced during extrusion to provide the core with oriented strengthening along<br>
the longitudinal direction of the wallboard.<br>
{00751 Slurry viscosity is a major concern in high speed wallboard<br>
production. Increased viscosity can lead to increased mixing and pumping<br>
demands, clogged machinery, and problems with board formation. Slurry<br>
viscosity is of even greater importance when selecting a CE additive because the<br>
primary purpose of CEs in conventional plaster formulations is to thicken the<br>
mixture.<br>
[00761 In order to fully hydrate the P-calcium sulfate hemihydrate and<br>
prepare a slurry that can be mixed and extruded, a greater amount of water is<br>
used than is used for plaster compounds, which use hydration of a-calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate to form gypsum. It is known that the amount of water added<br>
to the slurry has a profound effect on the quality and microstructure of the<br>
resulting wallboard. It is believed, without limiting the invention in any way,<br>
that addition of too little water prevents adequate mixing of the slurry, while too<br>
much water causes undesired porosity in the wallboard core. There can be a<br>
dramatic increase in viscosity with the addition of CEs, especially in<br>
formulations with elevated levels of high viscosity CE, which can make it<br>
difficult to adequately mix the dry ingredients and the water. Furthermore, an<br>
increase in viscosity can prevent the slurry from being poured into a form. One<br>
simple test that can be used to determine slurry viscosity is a "patty test" in which<br>
some amount of slurry is poured from a designated height and the resulting patty<br>
diameter is recorded. Furthermore, the rheology of wallboard slurry is a function<br>
of time, humidity and temperature.<br>
[0077} In general, the patty size increases inversely with an increase in<br>
the viscosity grade of a cellulose ether. As expected, the patty diameter increases<br>
with decreasing viscosity grade for HPMC In fact, patty diameter increases<br>
logarithmically with the inverse of viscosity grade; therefore, the nail pull index<br>
increases proportionally with the inverse of patty size, as shown in Fig. 9.<br>
[0078] In one embodiment, a slurry was formed by mixing p-calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate with less than 5 wt% of a powdered cellulose ether, such that<br>
the cellulose ether was evenly dispersed throughout the mixture. The mixture<br>
was then mixed with an amount of water to form a slurry, such that the wallboard<br>
core had a density of less than 0.8 g/cc upon drying. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, the cellulose ether was selected to have a molecular weight of at<br>
least 20,000 and a viscosity grade of at least 100 cps, and both the nail pull<br>
resistance and flexural strength were improved compared to unreinforced<br>
wallboard. In another embodiment, the amount of powdered cellulose ether was<br>
limited to a range of 0.5 wt% to 3 wt%, and the measured nail pull index<br>
continuously increased with addition of powdered cellulose ether.<br>
[0079] In yet another embodiment, the DS is limited to a range<br>
between 1.2 and 2.4 for a MC. In an alternative embodiment, the DS is limited to<br>
a range from 1.6 and 1.9 for a MC, having a viscosity grade of at least 10 cps,<br>
producing wallboard with improved nail pull index for viscosity grades of at least<br>
100 cps, as shown in Figs. 14 and 15, for example. Fig. 14 shows a graph of nail<br>
pull index versus MC viscosity grade with 0.25,0.5,1.0, and 2.0 wt% of MC<br>
mixed with powdered p-calcium sulfate hemihydrate. The darker lines and point<br>
are the values calculated using a correlation, which is discussed elsewhere, while<br>
the lighter lines are the experimental values. Fig. 15 is a similar graph for HPMC<br>
mixed with powdered ß-calcium sulfate hemihydrate. In another alternative<br>
embodiment, a DS range from 1,2 to 1.6 for a MC, greatly increases the flexural<br>
strength index and increases the nail pull index for MC additions at a weight<br>
percent of 0.25 and 0.5 wt%, as shown in Fig. 19, which is based on the<br>
correlation used in Fig. 14. Fig. 20 shows that this trend applies also to higher<br>
weight percent additions of MC. This shows that increasing nail pull resistance<br>
occurs for wallboard processed using a MC with low DS, high viscosity grade<br>
and high molecular weight, high weight percent or a combination of these.<br>
[0080] It is believed, without being limiting in any way, that<br>
hydrogen-bonding interactions immobilize the cellulose ether molecules, and the<br>
degree of hydrogen bonding is affected by molecular weight and is reflected in<br>
the viscosity grade. It is also affected by the degree of substitution. Thus, degree<br>
of substitution, viscosity grade and molecular weight of the cellulose ether are<br>
critical factors in selecting a specific cellulose ether as a strengthening additive,<br>
because it is believed that the strength of the wallboard depends on the<br>
distribution of cellulose ether molecules in the wallboard core and bonding<br>
interactions among the molecules. Furthermore, it is believed that the effect of<br>
bonding interactions depends on both the degree of substitution and the weight<br>
percent of the addition.<br>
[0081] The percent substitution of specific cellulose ethers, which<br>
were used as reinforcing additives, were analyzed in accordance with standard<br>
test method ASTM D 3876, which is incorporated by reference herein in its<br>
entirety. ASTM D 3876 determines methoxyl and hydroxypropyl substitution in<br>
cellulose ether products by gas chromatography. The resolved substitution<br>
percentages of the various cellulose ethers, along with the viscosity grades taken<br>
from the literature, were compared to the mechanical testing results to determine<br>
the effect of the degree of substitution on flexural strength and nail pull<br>
resistance. Based on these empirical measurements, correlations were developed<br>
that relate the nail pull index and the flexural strength index to cellulose ether<br>
substitution pattern. The following regression models established the best<br>
correlation:<br><br>
These empirical correlations are useful in defining the effect of each of the<br>
weight percentage of cellulose ether (f), the degree or percent of substitution of<br>
the methyl (M) and hydoxypropyl (H) groups, and the viscosity grade (y) on the<br>
nail pull index and flexural strength index of wallboard core reinforced by MC<br>
and HPMC.<br>
[0082] Specifically, there is a correlation of the amount of cellulose<br>
ether additive in the wallboard core and the nail pull index and flexural strength<br>
index. As expected, the nail pull resistance increases with increasing weight<br>
percent of additive. There is also a correlation with viscosity grade.<br>
Surprisingly, the data shows that increasing viscosity grade increases the nail pull<br>
index for HPMC and MC, which was not reflected in the literature or in some of<br>
the Taw data, for example, as shown in Fig. 14 for MC.<br>
[0083] Finally, there is a very surprising and unexpected correlation<br>
with the percent substitution. Specifically, the nail pull index increases with<br>
decreasing degree of substitution (DS), as show in Figs. 19 and 20 for MC, for<br>
example. This unexpected and surprisingly strong correlation is sufficient to<br>
cause the dramatic dip in the nail pull index versus viscosity grade curve as<br>
shown in Fig. 14, for example. In Fig. 14, the commercially available MC had a<br>
percent substitution of methyl groups of 34%. Furthermore, this effect has gone<br>
unnoticed by others, which has probably discouraged others from adding<br>
cellulose ethers to wallboard as a strengthening additive. Specifically, the DS is<br>
often not reported for commercial cellulose ethers. If reported, it is often highly<br>
inaccurate. Thus, to perform this analysis, it was necessary to independently<br>
measure the percent substitution by gas chromatography. In the range of weight<br>
percent most practical for wallboard, e.g. less than 5 wt%, more preferably less<br>
than 3 wt%, even moderate increases in DS dramatically decrease the measured<br>
flexural strength index of wallboard compared to lower DS, as shown in Figs. 19<br>
and 20.<br>
[0084] For low viscosity grade cellulose ethers, the difference in the<br>
measured index of nail pull and flexural strength is often the difference between<br>
a decrease compared to no reinforcement in the wallboard and a dramatic<br>
increase compared to no reinforcement, as shown in Figs. 19 and 20.<br>
Furthermore, commercially available cellulose ethers typically have relatively<br>
high values of DS, as compared to the DS associated with the limit in solubility<br>
of the cellulose ethers. Thus, it is not surprising that cellulose ethers have been<br>
overlooked as an additive for strengthening p-calcium sulfate hemihydrate based<br>
wallboard products. Indeed, the most promising cellulose ethers, for example<br>
MC with a DS in the range from 1.2 to 1.6, have not been readily available for<br>
testing as strengthening additives.<br>
[0085] The HPMC nail pull performance correlation exhibits a<br>
different relationship with methoxyl substitution percentage, which has a much<br>
lower range in commercially available HPMC than in commercially available<br>
MC. At low additive levels, decreasing methyl DS does increase the nail pull<br>
index; however, at higher additive levels reducing the methyl DS is less effective,<br>
according to the correlations. This trend is affected somewhat by the choice of<br>
viscosity grade and by hydroxypropyl substitution percentage. However, given<br>
the data currently available, the degree of hydroxypropyl substitution does not<br>
influence the nail pull index as dramatically as methoxyl substitution in MC.<br>
These effects are reflected in the scattered data of Fig. 15.<br>
[0086] In another alternative embodiment, a foam may be produced to<br>
further reduce the density of the wallboard core. This foam may be produced, for<br>
example, using a surfactant and stirring of the water and/or slurry to generate a<br>
foam, which may be incorporated into the extruded wallboard core.<br>
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES<br>
[0087] Control Sample. One hundred grams of ß-calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate was dry mixed with 0.13g ground gypsum accelerator. The ß-<br>
calcium sulfate hemihydrate was then added to 150 g of room-temperature tap<br>
water in a 500 mL Waring blender. The slurry was blended at low speed for 15<br>
seconds. The slurry was then immediately poured into an approximately 7" x 2" x<br>
1/2" mold. After about 20 minutes, the sample was removed from the mold and<br>
placed in a convection oven at 45 °C in which it was dried for at least 36 hrs.<br>
After removal from the oven, the sample was cut to 5" x 2" and massed and<br>
dimensioned. This data was used to calculate sample density. The flexural<br>
strength was attained using a three-point-bend test similar to the ASTM C473<br>
flexural strength test (method B) for gypsum wallboard. An Instron mechanical<br>
testing system with data acquisition software was used to determine mechanical<br>
behavior. The flexural failure stress was calculated from the failure load, testing<br>
configuration, and sample geometry. The two half samples remaining from the<br>
bending test were tested for resistance to nail pull. A nail pull test based on<br>
