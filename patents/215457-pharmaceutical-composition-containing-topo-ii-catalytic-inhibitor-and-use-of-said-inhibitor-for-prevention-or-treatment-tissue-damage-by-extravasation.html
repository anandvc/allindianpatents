				<td>TREATMENT OF ACCIDENTAL EXTRAVASATION OF ANTHRACYCLINES<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention or treatment of tissue damage due to extravasation caused by a topoisomerase II poison in a patient receiving treatment with saved poisons and to the use of said topo II catalytic inhibitor for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of said tissue damage due to extravasation caused by said topoisomerase II poison. Examples of such topoisomerase II poisons include anthracyclines.<br>
In particular, the invention relates to the systemic as well as the local administration of a topo II inhibitor such as the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-187 in the treatment of accidental extravasation of a topoisomerase II poison such as the anthracyclines daunorubicin, doxorubicin epirubicin, or idarubicin.<br>
Background of the invention^<br>
Topoisomerase II, topoisomerase II poisons, and topoisomerase H catalytic inhibitors The topoisomerase II (topo II) enzymes belong to a system of nuclear enzymes involved in the processing of DNA during the cell cycles. In short, they are able to introduce transient cleavage of both strands of the DNA double helix, thereby allowing the passage of another intact DNA double strand through the cleavage. The cleavage time is very short. Drugs acting on topo II are divided into two main categories, topo II poi¬sons and topo II catalytic inhibitors.<br>
The topo II poisons shift the equilibrium of the catalytic cycle towards cleavage, thereby increasing the concentration of the transient protein-associated breaks in the genome (1) (see Fig.1). That is, they trap the cleavable complexes, which converts the essential topo II enzyme into a lethal one(2).<br>
The topo II catalytic inhibitor is an entirely different group of drugs. They act by in¬terfering with the overall catalytic function, which can be accomplished in at least two ways. One is the inhibition of the initial binding of topo II to DNA as in the case of chloroquine (3) and aclarubicin (4,5). The other is by locking topo II in its closed-clamp step after religation as appears to be the case for the ICRF-187 and its analogues (6-9).<br><br>
Anthracyclines<br>
The anthracyclines comprise a group of widely used cytotoxic compounds with activity in numerous malignant diseases.<br>
Daunorubicin, the first anthracycline antibiotic to be discovered in the early 1960"s, was isolated from streptomyces cultures. Soon hereafter, doxorubicin was extracted and investigated clinically. The two drugs have a wide range of activity against malignant diseases - daunorubicin primarily in the field of haematological malignancies and doxorubicin against solid tumors. Epirubicin is a stereoisomer of doxorubicin with the same indications as but slightly lesser potency and less cardiac toxicity than the parent drug. Idarubicin (4-demethoxydaunorubicin) resembles daunorubicin but lacks a methoxyl group at the C-4 position. It is more lipophilic than the other anthracycline compounds and penetrates the blood-brain barrier more readily.<br>
The mechanism of action of these drugs is not well understood. The antitumor effect is explained by the ability to inhibit the nuclear enzyme DNA topo II. Thus, the anthra¬cyclines are classified as topo II poisons. However, the drugs also interact with other enzymes, e.g. topo I, DNA- and RNA polymerases, and helicases. Furthermore, they are able to intercalate with DNA, a process that may initiate free radical damage. During the intracellular metabolism of the anthracycline, the anthraquinone nucleus is converted to a free radical semiquinone intermediate that might exert local DNA destruction. Moreover, the anthracyclines are capable of chelating iron and forming ternary complexes with DNA. However, the drug concentration required to induce free radical DNA damage is higher than the achievable clinical concentrations. Thus, this mechanism appears to be less important in regard to antitumor effect.<br>
The most pronounced side effects of anthracycline therapy are cardiotoxicity (10,11), haematological toxicity, gastointestinal toxicity, and the extremely severe local toxicity following accidental extravasation (see below).<br><br>
ICRF-187<br>
The bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-187 (dexrazoxane) is the water-soluble (+) enantiomer of razoxane (ICRF-159). It is a highly specific topo II catalytic inhibitor. A hypothesis has been that ICRF-187, as an analogue of the cation binder EDTA, protects against free radical damage by binding and thus concealing iron from oxygen {12). However, we have recently demonstrated that cells with acquired resistance to ICRF-187 carry mutations in topo Ma (a subtype of topo II) which are in different sites than those induced by topo II poisons such as daunorubicin and etoposide. We confirmed that these mutations were functional using humanised topo II in yeast (13, 14), Accordingly, our assumptions were correct when we suggested that ICRF-187 was a specific topo II agent. We have demonstrated that it is possible to abolish the cell kill caused by etoposide, daunorubicin, and idarubicin at 2 different steps (See also Figure 2) in the enzyme"s catalytic cycle. Thus, intercalating drugs as chloroquine inhibit the enzyme from reaching its target (3,15,16) and the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-187 locks the en¬zyme at a closed clamp step{4,17,18).<br>
ICRF-187 is registrated as a cardioprotective agent (Zinecard®, Cardioxane®) against anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity.<br>
Extravasation of anthracyclines<br>
Accidental extravasation has been estimated to occur in 0.6 to 6% of all patients re¬ceiving chemotherapy. Chemotherapeutic agents such as the anthracyclines which bind to DNA are especially prone to cause severe tissue damage on extravasation. The tissue injury may not appear for several days or even weeks and may continue to worsen for months, probably due to drug recycling into adjacent tissue. The local toxicity is characterized by acute pain, erythema, and swelling at the extravasation site and it often progresses to ulceration. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the anthracyclines, e.g. doxorubicin, can persist in the tissue for at least a month(20). While small ulcerations may on occasion heal, large ulcerations require surgical excision for relief of pain and salvage of underlying tissue. An early surgical approach with extensive debridement of the involved area followed by skin grafting is therefore the treatment of choice (21).<br><br>
During the last two decades a number of possible treatment modalities have been in¬vestigated.<br>
Local cooling with ice lasting from 1 hour to 3 days or longer is a widely used treatment (22), that should be initiated immediately. The use of local injection or topical administration of corticosteroids as an anti-inflammatory treatment has produced con¬tradictory results in animal and human studies (23). Inflammation does not seem to be a part of the pathophysiology and corticosteroids may even worsen the lesions. The effect of local sodium bicarbonate (24) has been investigated in experiments with varying results as have local sodium thiosulphate, hyaluronidase (25), and beta-adrenergics (agonists and antagonists) (26). Experimental treatment and clinical use of topical dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 2 to 7 days with or without a-tocoferol (vitamin E) (27-29) has indicated beneficial effect in both animal and in uncontrolled clinical studies, at least of DMSO. The results are however not uniform. In one study intraperitoneal (IP) as well as topical treatment with a-tocoferol, Ginkgo biloba extract, or pentoxifylline of intradermal (ID) doxorubicin in rats decreased the tissue level of malondialdehyde, thus suggestive of scavenge of free radicals (29). Bi(3,5- dimethyl-5-hydroxymethyl-2-oxomorpholin-3-yl) (DHiVIS) can react with doxorubicin in vitro to produce an inactive metabolite deoxy-doxorubicin aglycone, and intralesional treatment with DHM3 of ID doxorubicin extravasation in a swine has shown some benefit (30). No confirmative studies have though been published since 1988.<br>
In the almost all animal studies anthracycline has been injected intradermally. It has been argued, that injections beneath the rodent skin muscle layer, panniculus carnosus, tend to cause irregular ulcerative lesions, whereas intradermal injection produces uniform skin necrosis and ulceration (32). However, ID injection of anthracyclines has also been the investigated methods in swine models.<br>
Frozen-section fluorescence of doxorubicin and epirubicin extravasation has been claimed to be an efficient method of detection of residual drug in the tissue, that could serve as a guide to surgical treatment of infiltration (31,33).<br>
The histological changes have been studied in a rabbit model, where the earliest changes included vascular obliteration and necrobiosis of collagen. At no point were<br><br>
inflammatory cells found to play a primary role (34). Small vesicles of unknown etiology have been seen in the necrotic dermis of rats (32). No studies have yet investigated apoptosis.<br>
Brief disclosure of the invention<br>
No studies mentioning neither ICRF-187 nor other bisdioxopiperazlnes nor topo II catalytic inhibitors as a treatment option have been published. Moreover, none of the published studies or reviews has discussed the topo II enzymes as a potential target for an antidote to extravasation of anthracyclines or other topo II poisons. Finally, the vast majority of animal experiments have dealt with local treatment of intradermally ex-travasated anthracyclines. It is our opinion that subcutaneous administration best re¬sembles the clinical reality. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the examples, the wound area x time (the area under the curve, AUG) is a very reproducible parameter.<br>
The issue of local versus systemic treatment is very important, as use of central venous access devices increases, When multiple infusions are anticipated over a prolonged period, placement of subcutaneous reservoirs with long indwelling lines should be considered. This is often the case in anthracycline therapy. The placement of short-term and long-term indwelling central venous catheters has now become a common surgical procedure performed on cancer patients. However, such devices are not free form leakage, displacement problems, or infectious thrombi. An extravasation incidence of 6.4 percent has been reported (35). Obviously it is difficult to treat local extravasation from centrally located indwelling devices. In such a situation a systemic treatment is far more suitable, but has until now not been available.<br>

Detailed disclosure of the invention	,        . (i f*"^<br>
The present invention provides an effective systemic_gnd/oj;Jbcal treatment of accidental extravasation of topoisomerase poisons such as the anthracyclines daunorubicin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and idarubicin by use of a topo II catalytic inhibitor such as the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-187.<br>
In one embodiment the present invention relates to a method for preventing or treating tissue damage due to extravasation of topoisomerase II poisons, including anthracyclines in a patient receiving treatment, normally a systemic treatment, with a topoisomerase II poison. The method comprises administration of a topo II catalytic inhibitor to the patient in need thereof. The signs of a possible extravasation of topoisomerase II poisons is normally immediate pain from the area of extravasation whereby the treatment against the tissue damage may be initiated accordingly. However, the tissue damage may proceed for a long period after the extravasation has occurred so treatment with the topo II catalytic inhibitor may be repeated as often as necessary to secure the optimal inhibition of tissue damage.<br>
The topo II inhibitor according to the invention is preferable selected from the group comprising bisdioxopiperazines; quinolines; aclarubicin; and acridines. The preferred bisdioxopiperazine is ICRF-187 (dexrazoxane). However, the bisdioxopiperazine compounds, to which the present invention relates, includes bis(3,5-dioxopiperazine-1-yl) alkanes having a structure as shown in the general formula I:<br><br><br><br>

wherein R^ and R^ are independenlty selected from hydrogen and optionally substituted Ci.6-alkyl, or R"* and R^ together with the intervening atoms form a C3.8-carbocyclic ring, and wherein R^ and R"* are selected from hydrogen and optionally substituted Ci-6-all(yl.<br>
In the present context, the term "Ci.6-alkyl" designates a linear or branched saturated hydrocarbon group having from one to six carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl.<br>
In the present context, the term "Cs.a-carbocyclic ring" designates a cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl group. It should be understood that when R^ and R^ together with the intervening atoms designates a "C3.8-carbocyclic ring", the dioxypiperazine rings may be attached to this carbocyclic ring either trans (E) or cis (Z) relative to the ring. It should also be understood that the carbocyclic ring itself may be substituted with 1-3 groups selected from Ci.e-alkyl, Ci.6-alkoxy (=Ci,6-alkyloxy), etc.<br>
In the present context, the term "optionally substituted" is intended to mean that the alkyl group in question may be 1 to 3 times with one or more groups selected from C^e-alkoxyl, 0x0 (which may be represented In the tautomeric enol form), carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl, mono- and di{Ci.6-alkyl)amino; carbamoyl, mono- and di(Ci^-alkyl)aminocarbonyl, halogen {i.e. fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine), phenyl or heterocyclyl (e.g. piperidine, piperazine, morpholine, pyrroline, pyrrolidine, pyrazoline and imidazoline).<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment, the meanings of the substituents R\ R^ R^ and R** include the combinations where R^ and R^ are selected from hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, methoxymethyl, and ethoxymethyl, and where R^ and R" are as generally defined above, preferably, however, selected from hydrogen and methyl.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the meanings of the substituents R\ R^, R^ and R* include the combinations where R^ and R^ together with the intervening atoms designate a cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl or cyclopentyl ring, and where R^ and R"* are as generally defined above, preferably, however, selected from hydrogen and methyl.<br><br>
In still another preferred embodiment, the meanings of the substituents R\ R^ R^ and R"^ include the combinations where R^ and R" are selected from hydrogen, methyl and methyl substituted with heterocyclyl, e.g. piperidine, piperazine, morpholine, pyrroline, pyrrolidine, pyrazoline and imidazoline, and R"" and R^ are as generally defined above, preferably, however, selected from hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, methoxymethyl, and ethoxymethyl, in particular methyl.<br>
In still another preferred embodiment, the meanings of the substituents R\ R^, R^ and R" include the combinations where R"* and R^ are selected from hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, Isopropyl, methoxymethyl, and ethoxymethyl, and where R^ and R* are hydrogen.<br>
It should be understood that the substituents R^ and R^ may give rise to optically active forms (i.e. (S) and (R) forms) or racemic mixtures of such forms.<br>
Particularly preferred combinations where R^ and R"^ are hydrogen are those where R^=R^=hydrogen, methyl (meso), ethyl (meso), those where R^=hydrogen and R^=methyl (racemic, (S)-(+) (dexrazoxane) or (RH-) (levrazoxane), preferably (S)-(+)) and ethyl, and those where R^=methyl and R^=ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and methoxymethyl, the latter in erythro or threo form, preferably erythro.<br>
The administration of the topo II catalytic Inhibitor may be by local administration to the tissue affected by the extravasation of the topoisomerase II poison. This includes injection into the area, applying the Inhibitor by or with any form of implant, in a dressing, by spraying on any other suitable way. The local treatment may be the sole treatment or a supplemental treatment to a systemic treatment. Local treatment is of special advantage where the extravasation Is located in a body cavity such as In the pleura.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the administration of the topo II catalytic inhibitor is by systemic administration to the tissue affected by the extravasation of the topoisomerase II poison. It is an very important aspect of the invention that the tissue damage may be prevented or treated by a systemic administration as the systemic treatment secure that the inhibitor reach the location of the tissue damage.<br><br>
It is clear that the administration of the inhibitor will normally be when the extravasation is a reality or it is believed that it has happen. However, in certain circumstances it might be preferred to initiate a prophylactic treatment . This may be the situation where the patient has suffered from extravasation in a earlier treatment with the topo II poison or there is a certain risk of extravasation, e.g. where the patient has very vulnerable veins which is very often the case in patients receiving chemotherapy.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the topo II catalytic inhibitor is administered after the treatment with the topoisomerase II poison. In a more preferred embodiment, the inhibitor is administered after treatment with the topoisomerase tl poison and as long as the tissue stills contains topoisomerase II poison or its active metabolites. In such cases the treatment with the inhibitor may be performed with an interval dependent on the location and degree of the tissue damage. The person skilled in the art will based on the present information be able to suggest a relevant specific treatment procedure based in the individual situation as the main problem is to secure that the inhibitor is present in the relevant area as long as the poison is still active in said tissue area.<br>
The topoisomerase II poisons which may give rise to tissue damage and which may be treated according to the present invention include etoposide, etoposide phosphate, teniposide, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin, mitoxantrone, m-AMSA and anthracycline. Moreover, any topoisomerase II poison that inhibits the religation step of the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase II step where the enzyme has created a cleavable complex in DNA is within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In general, there Is no reason to administer the inhibitor very long before the poison and it is therefore most preferred to administer the inhibitor substantially concomitantly with the administration of the topoisomerase II poison when a prophylactic treatment is desired.<br>
When the topo II catalytic inhibitor is administered after the administration of the topoisomerase II poison, it should generally be within a period of 3 weeks after the administration of the topo II poison, such as within 2 weeks, preferable within 1 week after, more preferred within 5 days after, even more preferred within 3 days after, still<br><br>
more preferred within 1 day after the administration of the topoisomerase ij poison. The 3-week period may illustrate a situation where the poisons or its metabolites are still active in the patient.<br>
In general, the topo II catalytic inhibitor should be administered in the period within 18 hours after the administration of the topo II poison, such as within12 hours, preferable within 6 hours after, more preferred within 4 hours after, even more preferred within 2 hours after, still more preferred within 1 hour after, and most preferred just after the administration of the topoisomerase II poison to prevent the development of tissue damage from an extravasation, However, for other reasons it may be most convenient to supervise whether any extravasation is present and treat the patient with the inhibitor as soon as possible. Accordingly, in a further aspect, the method according to the invention relates to a situation wherein the topo II catalytic inhibitor is administered upon recognition or suspicion of extravasation of the topoisomerase 11 poison.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the topo II catalytic inhibitor is administered with at least 2 repeated dosages, such as at least 3 repeated dosages. Such repeated dosages may be identical of represent a gradually decrease in dosage. It is preferred that the repeated dosages are administered with an interval of 1 to 3 days from the first dosage, preferable with an interval of 2 days, more preferred with an interval of 1 day. However minor intervals of less than 24 hours such as intervals of the most of 18 hours, more preferred at the most 6 hours, such as with intervals of about 3 hours from the first dosage of the II catalytic inhibitor has shown surprising results. The intervals do not have to be identical in that a treatment with increasing intervals may be very advantageous. The skilled person will be able to estimate a sort of "saturation" with relative high dosages or with dosages of minor intervals followed by increasing intervals between the administration of the topo II catalytic inhibitor.<br>
The topo II catalytic inhibitor should be administered within 12 hours, preferable within 6 hours upon recognition or suspicion of extravasation of the topoisomerase II poison. It should be noted that the administration may be performed as a routine in order to prevent damage from a possible extravasation.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the tope II catalytic inhibitor is a bisdioxopiperazine and the topoisomerase II poison is anthracycline. At present, anthracycline is responsible for the worst cases of tissue damage. Accordingly, the method wherein the anthracycline is selected from daunorubicin. doxorubicin, idarubicin, and epirubicin are very important aspects of the invention.<br>
The topo II Inhibitor according to the invention may be a bisdioxopiperazine having the formula stated above and the preferred bisdioxopiperazine is ICRF-187 (dexrazoxane).<br>
Due to the specific circumstances of the present invention it is very difficult to state the exact dosage of the inhibitor. However, with respect to ICRF-187, concentrations and dosages for use of the drug is known from other medical indications and such dosages may be used in the methods according to the present invention. In other cases, the skilled person will be able to suggest relevant dosages, inter alia by administering increasing dosages matching the estimated volume of extravasation of the poison. In general, the risk of tissue damage will increase the risk of side effect from the inhibitor. The purpose with the method according to the present invention is to administer the topo II inhibitor in an amount sufficient to be present in the tissue to be prevented from or treated for tissue damage. As appears from the examples successful treatment has been performed with a repeated dosage between 1000 to 500 mg/kg to a female patient. Accordingly, a repeated dosage of from 100 to 5000 mg/kg may be used according to the present invention. The exact dosage is depending on whether a single dosage or 3 or more repeated dosages is preferred in the specific situation. As indicated in the experiments with mice and swines much smaller dosages of 25 mg/kg in repeated dosages results in a very good effect. Accordingly, similar dosages are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In a still further aspect, the invention relates to use of a topo II catalytic inhibitor for the preparation of a medicament for treating or preventing tissue damage due to extravasation of a topoisomerase poison in a patient receiving a treatment, such as a systemic treatment with the topoisomerase poison. Accordingly, the invention relates to use of a topo II catalytic inhibitor for the preparation of a medicament for use in any of the methods described herein.<br><br>
In the present context "treatment with the topoisomerase poison" means an ongoing treatment (e.g. a patient receiving a specific treatment regimen) or a patient who has been treated.<br>
The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical kit for-for^reventing or treating tissue damage due to extravasation of a topoisomerase II poisons, including anthracyclines in a patient receiving systemic treatment with the drug, said kit comprising<br>
a)	a dosage unit of a topoisomerase II poison and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and<br>

Examples<br>
Materials and methods General remarks<br>
The experiments were conducted at the Laboratory of Experimental Medical Oncology at the Finsen and Laboratory Centres at the National University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen, Denmark. Inventor # 1 and 2 are licensed (Ministry of Justice) to perform experiments on live animals, and thus are bound by the 86/609/EEC (60) and CE (61) conventions.<br>
Mice<br>
Female B6D2F1 hybrid mice were obtained from M&amp;B A/S, Denmark, and kept in a controlled environment with ad libitum access to water and food. All mice went through a pre-experiment acclimatisation period of at least one week. The weight range was 19-21 9 at the start of the experiments.<br>
Drugs<br>
The following commercially available drugs were used: ICRF-187 hydrochloride (Cardioxane®, Chiron) Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Doxorubicin "Paranova"©, Pharmacia) Daunorubicin hydrochloride (Cerubidin®, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer) Idarubicin hydrochloride (Zavedos®, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn) Epirubicin hydrochloride (Farmorubicin®, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn)<br><br>
Fentanyl-fluanisone (Hypnorm®, Janssen) Midazolam (Dormicum®, Roche)<br>
Anesthesia<br>
In all experiments we used a standard solution containing 1 part fentanyl-fluanisone, 1<br>
part midazolam, and 2 parts isotonic saline In an IP dose of 0.1ml/10g (62).<br>
Injection technique<br>
Hair was removed with an electrical shaving device.<br>
Subcutaneous deposition of the anthracycline drug was carried out using a Hamilton®<br>
syringe with a 0.05 ml fixed volume deposit and a 27G x 3/4" needle. The injection site<br>
was approximately 1 cm above the root of the tail following retraction of the loose dorsal<br>
skin.<br>
ICRF-187 was injected intraperitoneally in a volume of approximately 0.2 ml with a 27G<br>
X 3/4" needle.<br>
When administered intralesionally, ICRF-187 was injected via a separate skin puncture<br>
immediately after the anthracycline in a volume of 0.05 ml using a fixed dose deposit<br>
Hamilton® syringe.<br>
Identification<br>
Each mouse was ear marked for individual identification.<br>
Observation<br>
Daily measurements were carried out of the two longest perpendicular wound diameters with a ruler. A wound was defined as a tissue lesion of at least 2 mm^. Healing was defined as complete regrowth of hair in a wound area. The mice were euthanized after healing of all wounds.<br>
Data handling and statistical methods<br>
Wound size was calculated as the product of the two longest perpendicular diameters in mm. The wound area times duration, i.e. the area under the curve (AUG) was calculated for individual mice. The data sheets presented in the following sections contain the mean AUCs. AUCs, time to wounds, and duration of wounds were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Fischers exact t-test was used to compare the ulcer rates.<br><br>

AUG = area under the curve<br>
TTWw = time to wound; non-wounded mice excluded<br>
DWw = duration of wound; non-wounded mice excluded<br>
NW/NG = ulcer rate<br>

Example 1<br>
Experiments with doxorubicin<br>
In Example 1 the effect of different concentrations of ICRF-187 administered IP at t= 0, i.e. simultaneously with doxorubicin was investigated. The concentration of doxorubicin was 2 mg/kg, and the volume as previously stated. The control group received saline IP. Twenty-seven mice were used.<br>
The results are depicted in the data sheet for Example 1. Treatment with ICRF-187 125 mg/kg IP resulted in a 91% reduction in AUG from 543 to 48 mm^ x days (p

Timing of ICRF-187<br>
The timing of ICRF-187 was investigated in 36 mice. As in Example 1 the concentration of doxorubicin was 2 mg/kg, and saline served as control. ICRF-187 was administered IP in a concentration of 250 mg/kg simultaneously, 3 hours after, or 6 hours after doxorubicin, respectively. The results are depicted in data sheet # 2:<br><br>

Treatment with ICRF-187 resulted in 82-92% reductions in AUCs from 458 to 45, 52, and 81 mm^ x days respectively. There was a statistically non-significant trend towards lesser reduction in AUC, when treatment was administered 6 hours after doxorubicin as compared to simultaneous administration. The time to wound and the wound duration were not different. There were no treatment-related deaths. The mean AUCs are shown graphically in Fig. 3.<br>
Overall, treatment with ICRF-187 at t=0 in Example 1 and 2 reduced the ulcer rates from 14/16 to 6/29, i.e. from 88% to 21% {p
Example 3<br>
Experiments with daunorubicin<br>
The effect of various doses of ICRF-187 was investigated in Example 3. Saline served as a control, which yielded an AUC of 764 mm^ x days. Co-treatment with ICRF-187 in a dose of 250 mg/kg and 375 mg/kg resulted in reductions of the AUC with 48% and 93%, respectively (p

Repetition of experiment with larger groups<br>
The experiments were repeated with larger group sizes in Example 5, where 36 mice were used. As shown in data sheet for Example 5, there was a reduction in the ulcer rates between mice not receiving and those receiving treatment with ICRF-187. Further¬more, ICRF-187 reduced (p

Group to group comparison of Example 4 and 5 showed no statistically significant differences between the similar treatments, i.e. it was possible to obtain the same results in the two examples. Thus, the cumulated data from the two experiments reinforced the statistical power of the differences in AUC, TTW and DW between iCRF-treated and non-treated groups and between low and high dose treatment.<br>
Example 6<br>
The effect of different timing of ICRF-187 administration<br>
ICRF-187 was administered at the same time as daunorubicin. 3 hours after, and 6 hours after, respectively. Saline served as control. The dose of daunorubicin was 3 mg/kg sc and ICRF-187 was administered IP in a 250 mg/kg solution. Twenty-eight mice were used. The results are depicted in data sheet # 6 and the mean AUCs are shown graphically in fig. 5.<br><br>

The changes in AUCs reflected effect of ICRF-187 treatment when administered at the same time as daunorubicin as well as after 3 hours. Thus, the AUG was reduced with 77% at t=0 (p

100 mg/kg ICRF-187 was injected into the subcutaneous papule produced by injected daunorubicin. This treatment was compared to intralesional saline control, IP saline con¬trol, and IP treatment with ICRF-187. There were 9 mice in each group and no treat¬ment-related deaths.<br><br>

In Example 8 a total of 28 mice were treated with epirubicin 4 mg/kg sc. Saline IP served as control, whereas treatment consisted of ICRF-187 125, 250 or 375 mg/kg IP, respectively. The results are presented in data sheet for Example 8:<br><br>

There were no statistically significant differences In AUCs of the four groups. However, when both AUCs and ulcer rates are taken in account, there was a trend towards a dose-dependent beneficial effect of treatment with ICRF-187. Statistical analysis of differences in duration of wounds or time to wounds is not meaningful.<br><br>
It appears that the dose of epirubicin in Example 8 was to low. Hence, the effect of a higher dose of epirubicin will be subject for further investigation. Likewise, the effect of the time of administration of ICRF-187 in relation to axtravasation of epirubicin has not yet been investigated.<br>

Experiments with idarubicin:<br>
In Example 9, 54 mice received idarubicin sc in increasing concentrations from 0.05 mg/kg to 0.75 mg/kg. Half of the groups served a saline controls, whereas in the other half of the groups ICRF-187 250 mg/kg was administered IP at t=0.

Updated experiments with daunorubicin^:<br>
Twenty-eight experiments have been conducted. Seven experiments (n = 6, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, and 9) with 3 mg/kg daunorubicin SC plus saline IP at t=0 and seven experiments (n = 6, 7, 7, 9, 9, 8, and 9) with 3 mg/kg daunorubicin SC plus 250 mg/kg ICRF-187 IP at t = Otin two experiments (n = 9 and 4) the ICRF-187 doses were 62,5 mg/kg and 375 mg/kg IP, respectively, In two (n = 7 and 9) the dose was 125 mg/kg. ICRF-187 250 mg/kg was administered IV in one (n = 9). ICRF-187 was administered as triple-treatment in three experiments: In one (n =8) the dose was 250 mg/kg IP at day 0, 1, and 2. In two others, ICRF-187 was injected at 0, 3 hours, and 6 hours after SC daunorubicin in a dose of 125 mg/kg (n = 9) and 62,5 mg/kg (n = 9), respectively.<br>
Example 11<br>
Updated experiments with doxorubicin:<br>
Twenty-eight experiments were performed. Six experiments (n = 9, 9,18, 9, 9, and 7) with doxorubicin 2 or 3 mg/kg SC and saline IP at t = 0, and six (n = 9, 8, 16, 6, 9, and 9) with doxorubicin 2 or 3 mg/kg SC and ICRF-187 250 mg/kg IP at t= 0. In two (n = 9 and 7) the ICRF-187 dose was 125 mg/kg IP, in one (n= 7) 375 mg/kg IP, and in one (n = 9) 62,5 mg/kg IP. In a single experiment (n=9), doxorubicin 3 mg/kg SC was followed immediately by ICRF-187 250 mg/kg administered IV. ICRF-187 was administered as triple-treatment in three experiments: In one (n = 9) the dose was 250 mg/kg IP at day 0, 1, and 2. In two others, ICRF-187 was injected at 0, 3 hours, and 6 hours after SC doxorubicin in a dose of 125 mg/kg (n = 9) and 62,5 mg/kg (n = 9), respectively. In one experiments (n = 9} doxorubicin was administered SC in a dose of 1 mg/kg with saline IP, and in one (n = 9) with 250 mg/kg ICRF-187 IP. ICRF-187 250 mg/kg was administered IP three (n = 9 and 9) or six hours (n = 9 and 9) after doxorubicin 2 or 3 mg/kg SC in four other experiments. Finally, premixing doxorubicin 3 mg/kg with either<br><br>
lCRF-187 250 mg/kg (n = 9) or 30 mg/kg (n = 9) for SC injection was performed in two experiments.<br>
Results<br>
Doxorubicin induced lesions were similar in sizes and duration, whether they were induced by SC injection of 2 or 3 mg/kg. Thus, these two dose levels are pooled (Table A). The inter-experimental variation in the mean AUC"s in the seven experiments with daunorubicin 3 mg/kg SC plus saline IP was very small (p&gt;0.05). Neither were the mean AUC"s different in the seven experiments where daunorubicin 3 mg/kg SC were accompanied by ICRF-187 250 mg/kg IP at t=0 (Figure 7). The same notable reproducibility was present in experiments with doxorubicin 2 or 3 mg/kg SC plus saline IP or plus ICRF-187 250 mg/kg IP. Furthermore, as the ICRF-187-treatment resulted in statistically significant reductions in the mean AUC in all the above mentioned experiments (individual Mann-Whitney tests all p
A single IP injection of ICRF-187 250 mg/kg administered immediately after a SC deposit of 3 mg/kg daunorubicin reduced the mean AUC by 70% (p
In the case of doxorubicin (Figures 8 and 10), the mean AUC after 2 or 3 mg/kg SC was reduced by 96% (p
In both daunorubicin and doxorubicin induced wounds, there was no statistically significant difference between the protection provided by IP injection of ICRF-187 compared to IV administration.<br><br>
Reduction of the daunorubicin dose from 3 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg resulted in significantly smaller AUCs (p
In daunorubicin Induced lesions, the reduction in AUG decreased from 70% to 45% (p= 0.0175), when the IGRF-187 dose was reduced from 250 mg/kg IP to 125 mg/kg. In contrast, the protection against doxorubicin injuries was evenly effective at all doses of IGRF-187.<br>
Three or even six hours of delay in administration of IGRF-187 did not Impair the degree of protection against doxorubicin lesions when compared to the effect obtained by treatment at t=0. Similarly, when ICRF-187 was administered 3 hours after the Injection of daunorubicin, the protection was no different from the protection obtained by Immediate IGRF-187 administration. However, the protection was lost if the delay was 6 hours .<br>
Treatment with IGRF-187 250 mg/kg IP three days in a row completely prevented both doxorubicin and daunorubicin induced lesions. Moreover, triple-treatment with IGRF-187 62,5 mg/kg or 125 mg/kg IP administered 0, 3 and 6 hours after injection of daunorubicin or doxorubicin resulted in at least the same degree of protection as a single injection of 250 mg/kg ICRF-187 IP.<br>
The dose of IGRF-187 correlated Inversely with the protection against wounds in the two experiments were ICRF-187 and doxorubicin were mixed before SG injection. Thus, SC injection of a mixture of ICRF-187 30 mg/kg and doxorubicin 3 mg/kg resulted in complete protection against wounds. However, the Increment of the dose of ICRF-187 to 250 mg/kg in the same volume resulted in appearance of wounds in seven of nine treated mice.<br>
Fig 7 shows that the induction of wounds by SC daunorubicin and the protection from such lesions with IP ICRF-187 is highly reproducible.<br><br>

Fig 8 shows that the protection against daunorubicin induced lesions is more dose- and time-dependent than against injuries caused by SC doxororubicin. The marked protection obtained by triple-treatment with ICRF-187 is very surprising. The histograms compare the mean AUCs of different schedules of ICRF-187 after SC injection of 3 mg/kg daunorubicin (Fig 8A), 0.75 mg/kg idarubicin (Fig 8B), and 2 or 3 mg/kg doxorubicin, respectively (Fig 8C).<br>
Mean AUC: Mean area under the curve (mm^ x days); n: number of mice; bars: SEM. Legends: Except for the bars representing saline, the legends depict the dose, route of administration, and timing of ICRF-187.<br>
Fig 9 shows that a single systemic injection of ICRF-187 significantly reduces the<br>
wounds induced by SC daunorubicin.<br>

^ilot studies on swine<br>
A Danish porker weighting approximately 30 kg was used. The animals were fully anesthesized and artificially ventilated during SC injection of 1 ml of anthracycline. I one experiment (n=2) a wound appeared after 3 mg doxorubicin SC in the swine not receiving ICRF-187, whereas the swine treated with 25 mg/kg ICRF-187 IV at t=0 did not develope an ulcer. In the second experiment (n=3), no wound appeared after 1 ml daunorubicin SC in a swine treated with 25 mg/kg iCRF-187 IV daily for three days, a small wound appeared in the swine treated with 50 mg/kg IV at t=0, and a large wound appeared in the untreated swine.<br>
In summary, the experiments performed on swine confirmed results from our murine experiments, i.e. ICRF-187 protects against lesions induced by SC anthracyclines in a schedule-dependent manner.<br>
Example 13<br>
Clinical results in a patient<br>
A female patient in whom 149 mg of doxorubicin was infused subcutaneously instead of into a port-a-cath has been treated according to the present invention.<br>
Treatment with ICRF-187 was initiated 2 h 30 m after the extravasation with a dose of 1000 mg/m^ day 1, 1000 mg/m^ day 2, and 500 mg/m^ on day 3 of the ICRF-187. In the following weeks she experienced no side effects from the treatment. Weekly evaluation by a clinical oncologist and a plastic surgeon as well as with ultrasound revealed a subcutaneous mass of approximately 3x4 cm that did not change in size during the evaluation period of 30 days after the incident. No ulcer or signs of skin-necrosis developed in spite of the massive dose of doxorubicin. The patient continued chemotherapy with a delay of only one week and without surgical intervention.<br>
