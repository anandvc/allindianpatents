				<td>Catalyst Particles<br>
The present invention relates to novel and unique catalyst systems comprising catalyst particles, a method for preparing same, the use of the catalyst particles for polymerization reactions and methods of controlling the catalyst particle morphology.<br>
Prior art<br>
Catalyst systems comprise catalysts, which include one or more catalyst components and optionally cocatalysts, external donors and poison scavengers or any other catalyst additives. Catalysts which are solutions of one or more catalyst components are known in the field as homogeneous catalysts. Typically, homogeneous catalysts and catalyst systems are used as liquids in the polymerization process. Such systems have in general a satisfactory catalytic activity, but their problem has been that the polymer thus produced has a poor morphology. As a consequence, operation of slurry and gas reactors using a homogeneous catalyst system caused problems in practice, since for example fouling of the reactor can occur.<br>
Various approaches have been attempted in order to overcome this drawback. Homogeneous catalysts, for example, have been subjected to prepolymerization in order to introduce the catalysts or catalyst systems in the form of prepolymerized polymer particles comprising catalytically active sites into polymerisation reactions. Other attempts have been made in order to support the homogeneous catalyst on carrier materials, such as solution impregnation methods on porous organic and inorganic support materials, such as silica, MgCI2, or porous polymeric materials. Such kinds of heterogeneous supported catalyst systems are widely used e.g. in the field of olefin polymerisations.<br>
The international present application WO 2004/089542, for example, discloses the use of porous functionalized beads of polystyrene in order to immobilize an iron based polymerization catalyst.<br>
However, also supported catalysts present drawbacks. It is often difficult to get an even distribution of the catalyst components within the porous carrier material. Furthermore, it is possible that the catalyst components are leached from the support, so that overall unsatisfactory polymerization' behavior of the catalyst occurs. Carrier materials furthermore can also have adverse effects on the activity of the catalyst, the polymerization behavior and the properties of the polymeric product.<br>
Accordingly, there exists the need in the art to provide alternative and improved ways of employing heterogeneous catalysts and catalyst systems for polymerization reactions which do not suffer from the drawbacks as identified above.<br>
Object of the present invention<br>
The present invention accordingly attempts to provide novel means of employing heterogeneous catalysts and catalyst systems for polymerization reactions. The present invention aims at providing novel catalysts as well as methods of preparing same.<br>
Brief summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention solves the above-outlined objects by providing novel catalyst particles as defined in claim 1. Preferred embodiments are defined in sub-claims 2 to 10, while claim 11 defines a catalyst system comprising the catalyst particles of the resent invention.. The present invention furthermore provides a method of preparing said catalyst particles as defined in claim 12. Preferred embodiments of the method are defined in claims 13 to 20. The present invention also provides the use of the novel catalyst particles for polymerization reactions as defined in claim 21. Finally, the present invention provides a method for controlling the catalyst particle morphology as outlined in claim 22. Preferred embodiments thereof are defined in claim 23.<br>
Further embodiments of the present invention are set forth in the following specification. The examples as contained herein are considered as being illustrative and should not be construed in a limiting way.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows particle size distributions for two examples of catalyst particles in accordance with the present invention, compared with one reference example. Figure 2 shows a picture of polypropylene particles produced with the catalyst particles in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
As defined in claim 1, the present invention provides a catalyst system comprising a catalyst in the form of solid particles. Catalyst particles may comprise one or more catalyst components. These particles are typically of spherical shape, although the present invention is not limited to a spherical shape. The solid particles in accordance with the present invention also may be present in round but not spherical shapes, such as elongated particles, or they may be of irregular size. Preferred in accordance with the present invention, however, are particles having a spherical shape.<br>
The solid particles in accordance with the present invention furthermore show a predetermined particle size, depending in particular from the intended end use (type of polymerization process and polymer product desired to be obtained). Typically, the solid particles in accordance with the present invention show uniform morphology and in particular a narrow particle size distribution. Broad particle size distributions as well as multimodal particle size distributions are, however, also envisaged by the present invention. Typically and preferred, however, the solid particles in accordance with the present invention show uniform particles and a narrow particle size distribution.<br>
The solid catalyst particles in accordance with the present invention typically have an average size range of from 1 to 500 urn, for example 5 to 500 µm. Preferred embodiments of the present invention are solid particles having an average size range of from 5 to 200 µm or from 10 to 150 µm. Smaller average size ranges, however, can also be obtained in accordance with the present invention, such as from 5 to 100 µm. Alternative embodiments are larger average particle size ranges, for example from 20 to 250 µm. These average size ranges of the solid particles in accordance with the present<br>
invention may be obtained as explained further below in connection with the method of preparing the solid particles.<br>
With respect to the particle sizes and the particle size distribution, the present invention furthermore also envisages that desired particle size fractions can be isolated, for example by sieving processes, and that mixtures of solid particles of different average size range or different particle size distributions may be prepared in order to obtain solid particle compositions having a tailored particle size distribution, average size range etc.<br>
The solid catalyst particles in accordance with the present invention furthermore are characterized in that they show from rather low to very low surface area determined with the commonly known BET method with N2 gas as analysis adsorptive. Typically, the solid catalyst particles have a surface area of 20 m2/g or less, preferably 10 m2/g or less. In some embodiments, the solid catalyst particles in accordance wit the present invention show a surface area of below the threshold value of standard test equipment for the determination of surface area using the BET method as above, i.e. the solid catalyst particles in accordance with the present invention may have a surface area of 5 m2/g or less.<br>
As defined in claim 1, the solid catalyst particles in accordance with the present invention are furthermore characterized in that the catalytically active sites are distributed throughout the catalyst matrix of the particles. In accordance with the present invention, any type of catalyst may be employed, in particular polymerization catalysts, preferably polymerization catalysts suitable for the polymerization of olefins. Typical examples thereof, usually comprising as catalyst components transition metal compounds, which are illustrative embodiments of the present invention, are single site catalyst, such as metallocene or non-metallocene singe site catalysts, as well as Ziegler-Natta catalysts, including in particular systems based on titanium and magnesium. Suitable examples are discussed further in the following and are also disclosed in the international applications WO 03/051934, WO 03/000754 and WO 03/000757. These documents are incorporated herein by reference with respect to the suitable catalysts and catalyst systems to be employed in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Particularly suitable catalyst components are shown in the following: Catalyst Components<br>

Thus the catalyst may be formed in situ from the catalyst components, for example in solution in a manner known in the art.<br>
It should also be understood that the catalyst prepared according to the invention may be used as such in a polymerisation process or be further activated with additional cocatalysts or activators to form the active catalyst system, which further may comprise e.g. external donors etc.. Furthermore, said catalyst of the invention may be part of a further catalyst system. These alternatives are within the knowledge of a skilled person.<br>

Preferably, R" is other than hydrogen.<br>
A specific subgroup includes the well known metallocenes of Zr, Hf and Ti with one or<br>

butylcyclopentadienyl)HfCI2, see e.g. EP-A-129 368. Examples of compounds wherein the metal atom bears a -NR"2 ligand a re disclosed i.a. in W O-A-9856831 and WO-A-<br>
0034341. The contents of the above documents are incorporated herein by reference. Further metallocenes are described e.g. in EPA-260 130. As further examples of usable metallocenes may also be found e.g. from WO-A-9728170, WO-A-9846616, WO-A-9849206, WO-A-9912981, WO-A-9919335, WO-A-9856831, WO-A-00/34341, EP-A-423 101 and EP-A-537 130 as well as V.C. Gibson et al., in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., engl., Vol 38, 1999, pp 428-447, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, in a further subgroup of the metallocene compounds, the metal bears a Cp group as defined above and additionally a rj1 or h2 ligand, wherein said ligands may or may not be bridged to each other. This subgroup includes so called "scorpionate compounds" (with constrained geometry) in which the metal is complexed by a q5 ligand bridged to a rj1 or n2 ligand, preferably n.1 (for example a sigma-bonded) ligand, e.g. a metal complex of a Cp group as defined above, e.g. a cyclopentadienyl group, which bears,  via a bridge member,  an  acyclic or cyclic group containing at least one heteroatom, e.g. -NR"2 as defined above. Such compounds are described e.g. in WO-A-9613529, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Any alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl residue referred above alone or as a part of a moiety may be linear or branched, and contain preferably of up to 9, e.g. of up to 6, carbon atoms. Aryl is preferably phenyl or naphthalene. Halogen means F, CI, Br or I, preferably CI. Another subgroup of the organotransition metal compounds of formula I usable in the present invention is known as non-metallocenes wherein the transition metal (preferably a Group 4 to 6 transition metal, suitably Ti, Zr or Hf) has a coordination ligand other than cyclopentadienyl ligand.<br>
The term "non-metallocene"' herein means compounds, which bear no cyclopentadienyl ligands or fused derivatives thereof, but one or more non-cyclopentadienyl h- or o-, mono-, bi- or multidentate ligand. Such ligands can be chosen e.g. from (a) acyclic, r)1- to h4- or h6-ligands composed of atoms from Groups 13 to 16 of the Periodic Table (IUPAC), e.g. an acyclic pentadienyl ligand wherein the chain consists of carbon atoms and optionally one or more heteroatoms from Groups 13 to 16 (IUPAC), and in which the open chain ligand may be fused with one or two, preferably two, aromatic or non-aromatic rings and/or bear further substituents (see e.g. WO 01 70395, WO 97 10248 and WO 99 41290), or (b) cyclic o-, h1- to h4- or h6-, mono-, bi- or multidentate ligands composed of unsubstituted or substituted mono-, bi- or multicyclic ring systems, e.g.<br>
aromatic or non-aromatic or partially saturated ring systems, containing carbon ring atoms and optionally one or more heteroatoms selected from Groups 15 and 16 of the Periodic Table (IUPAC) (see e.g. WO 99 10353). Bi- or multidentate ring systems include also bridged ring systems wherein each ring is linked via a bridging group, e.g. via an atom from. Groups 15 or 16 of the Periodic Table, e.g. N, O or S, to the transition metal atom (see e.g. WO 02 060963). As examples of such compounds, i.a. transition metal complexes with nitrogen-based, cyclic or acyclic aliphatic or aromatic ligands, e.g. such as those described in the applicants earlier application WO-A-9910353 or in the Review of V.C. Gibson at al., in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., engl., Vol 38, 1999, pp 428-447 or with oxygen-based ligands, such as Group 4 metal complexes bearing bidentate cyclic or acyclic aliphatic or aromatic alkoxide ligands, e.g. optionally substituted, bridged bisphenolic ligands (see i.a. the above review of Gibson et al.). Further specific examples of non- n5 ligands are amides, amide-diphosphane, amidinato, aminopyridinate, benzamidinate, azacycloalkenyl, such as triazabicycloalkenyl, allyl, beta-diketimate and aryloxide. The disclosures of the above documents are incorporated herein by reference. It should be noted that the diversity does not affect the applicability of the process of the invention, whose essential particle-shaping measures remain unaffected by the particular content of the particles to be shaped.<br>
The preparation of metallocenes and non-metallocenes, and the organic ligands thereof, usable in the invention is well documented in the prior art, and reference is made e.g. to the above cited documents. Some of said compounds are also commercially available. Thus, said transition metal compounds can be prepared according to or analogously to the methods described in the literature, e.g. by first preparing the organic ligand moiety and then metallating said organic ligand (r|-ligand) with a transition metal. Alternatively, a metal ion of an existing metallocene can be exchanged for another metal ion through transmetallation.<br>
If several different transition metal compounds are used (mixed dual or multicatalyst systems), these can be any combinations of the above organometal compounds or of the above organometal compounds with other catalyst compounds (including Ziegler-Natta and chromium oxide systems)/ e.g. a combination at least of two or more a metallocenes, of a metallocene and a non-metallocene, as well as of a metallocene<br>
and/or a non-metallocene with a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system (which comprises typically (see below) a transition metal compound and a compound of a metal from Group 2 of the Periodic Table, such as a Mg compound).<br>
As stated above, the catalyst prepared according to the present invention may further comprise one or more cocatalysts well known in the art, preferably an activator containing aluminium or boron. Examples of such activators are organo aluminium compounds, such as trialkylaluminium compound and/or aluminoxane compound, or non-coordination ionic cocatalysts, such as boron activators.<br>
Preferred as cocatalysts for metallocenes and non-metallocenes, if desired, are the aluminoxanes, in particular the C1-C10-alkylaluminoxanes, most particularly methylaluminoxane (MAO). Such aluminoxanes can be used as the sole cocatalyst or together with other cocatalyst(s). Thus besides or in addition to aluminoxanes, other cation complex forming catalysts activators can be used. In this regard mention may be made particularly to boron compounds known in the art. Said activators are commercially available or can be prepared according to the prior art literature.<br>
Further aluminoxane cocatalysts are described i.a. in WO-A-9428034 which is incorporated herein by reference. These are linear or cyclic oligomers of having up to 40, preferably 3 to 20, -(AI(R"')O)- repeat units (wherein Rm is hydrogen, C1-C10-alkyl (preferably methyl) or C6-C18-aryl or mixtures thereof).<br>
The use and amounts of the such activators are within the skills of an expert in the field. As an example, with the boron activators, 5:1 to 1:5, preferably 2:1 to 1:2, such as 1:1, ratio of the transition metal to boron activator may be used. In case of aluminoxanes, such as methylaluminumoxane (MAO), the amount of Al, provided by aluminoxane, can be chosen to provide an Altransition metal molar ratio e.g. in the range of 1:1 to 10000:1, suitably 5:1 to 8000:1, preferably 10:1 to 7000:1, e.g. 100:1 to 4000:1, as normally used for homogeneous catalyst systems, or, depending on the used catalyst forming compounds, also 1 0:1 to 500:1, such as 1 00:1 to 300:1 as normally used for heterogeneous catalyst Systems may be used.<br>
The quantity of cocatalyst to be employed in the catalyst of the invention is thus variable, and depends on the conditions and the particular transition metal compound chosen in a manner well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Further catalyst systems, including Ziegler Natta (ZN) Systems<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, Ziegler Natta catalysts may be employed as catalysts. These catalysts include a transition metal compound of groups 4 to 10 (preferably,Ti) of the Periodic table or a compound of an actinide or lanthanide, a compound of a group 1-3 metal, preferably magnesium, and an electron donor compound. SuitabJe compositions and reaction conditions for forming ZN catalysts and further catalyst systems are in particular disclosed in WO 03/000754 and WO 03/000757, incorporated herein by referenpe.<br>
Suitable transition metal compounds are in particular transition metal compounds of transition metals of groups 4 to 6, in particular of group 4. Suitable examples include Ti, Cu, Fe, Co, Ni, Pt, and/or Pd, but also Cr, Zr, Ta, and Trv, in particular preferred is Ti. Of the compounds of groups 1 to 3 preferred are compounds of group 2 elements, in particular Mg compounds, such as Mg halides, Mg alkoxides- etc. as known to the skilled person.<br>
The electron donor compound is preferably an mono- or diester of an aromatic carboxylic acid or diacid, the latter being able to form a chelate-like structured complex. Said aromatic carboxylic acid ester or diester can be formed in situ by reaction of an aromatic carboxylic acid chloride or diacid dichloride with a C2-C16 alkanol and/or diol, and is preferable dioctyl phthalate.<br>
As mentioned above catalyst systems may include in addition to the solid catalyst particles additional cocatalysts and/or external donor(s), depending on the used polymerisation process, in a manner known in the art. As the cocatalyst, e.g. conventional activators based on compounds of group 13 of the Periodic Table (IUPAC), e.g. organo aluminium, such as aluminium compounds, like aluminium alkyl, aluminium halide or aluminium alkyl halide compounds (e.g. triethylaluminium) compounds, can be mentioned. Additionally, especially in case of the (co)polymerisation of polypropylene or higher olefins, one or more external donors can be used which may be typically selected e.g. from silanes or any other well known external donors in the field.<br>
It is also possible to include other catalyst cornponent(s) than said ZN components to the catalyst of the invention.<br>
The solid catalyst particles in-accordance with the present invention are furthermore characterized in accordance with the wording of claim 1  in that they comprise the catalytically active sites distributed throughout the catalyst matrix of the particles. In accordance with the present invention, this definition means that the catalytically active sites are evenly distributed throughout the matrix of the particles, preferably that the catalytically active sites make up a substantial portion of the matrix phase of the solid particles in accordance with the present invention. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, this definition means that the catalytically active components, i.e. the catalyst component makes up the major part of the matrix phase of the particle. Other  components,   except  for  the  above  mentioned  catalyst  additives,   such  as cocataiysts, activators etc.,   may be included in the matrix phase, preferably, however, these other components only are present in minute amounts, such as residual solvents or residual components derived from the preparation process (exemplified below). These further components should in particular not affect the catalytical activity or the particle morphology and usually such additional components are present only in very minute amounts of clearly below 7 wt%, preferably below 5 wt%, more preferably below 3 wt% or even below 1 wt%.<br>
As furthermore outlined in claim 1, the solid particles in accordance with the present invention are furthermore characterized in that they comprise inclusions not comprising catalytically active sites. Such inclusions, i.e. a dispersed phase within the matrix phase of the catalyst component (see above), usually constitute only a minor part of the total volume of the solid particles, i.e. typically below 50%, more preferably lower than 40% and, in particular 30% or lower, 20% or lower and in embodiments even 10% or lower. A suitable range as also illustrated in the examples is a range of from 8 to 30%, more preferably 10 to 25%.<br><br>
The inclusions may be of any desired shape, including spherical as well as elongated shapes and irregular shapes. Inclusions in accordance with the present invention may have a plate-like shape or they may be long and narrow, for example in the shape of a fiber.-Irregular shapes of all kind are also envisaged by the present invention. Typical inclusions, however, are either spherical or near spherical or they show plate-like shapes. It is to be noted that the inclusions are inside the particles, but essentially not extending to the surface of the particles.<br>
The inclusions in accordance with the present invention, not comprising catalytically active sites, may be present in the form of hollow voids, in the form of liquid-filled hollow voids, in the form of hollow voids partially filled with liquid, in the form of solid material or in the form of hollow voids partially filled with solid material. In particular, in the case of using solid materials, the shape of the inclusions can be determined on the basis of the shape of the solid material, or particles of solid material employed. The shape of hollow voids, liquid-filled hollow voids and hollow voids partially filled with liquid are typically determined by the process conditions during the preparation of the solid particles, as further outlined in detail below.<br>
Typical examples of solid materials suitable for forming inclusions in accordance with the present invention are inorganic materials as well as organic, in particular organic polymeric materials, suitable examples being nano materials, such as silica, montmorillonite, carbon black, graphite, zeolites, Ti02 as well as other inorganic particles, including glass nanobeads or any combination thereof. Suitable organic particles, in particular polymeric organic particles, are nano beads made from polymers such as polystyrene, or other polymeric materials. In any case, the particulate materials employed for providing inclusions in the solid particles in accordance with the present invention have to be inert towards the catalytically active sites, during the preparation of the solid particles as well as during the subsequent use in polymerization reactions. The solid materials used for providing inclusions in accordance with the present invention preferably themselves have a low surface area and are more preferably non-porous.<br>
Hollow voids, liquid-filled voids and hollow voids partially filled with liquid, in accordance with the present invention, may in particular be introduced into the solid particles in<br>
accordance with the present invention by using inert liquids, which preferably are immiscible with the liquids and solvents used during the preparation of the solid catalyst particles in accordance with the invention. These liquids furthermore may display a different viscosity, compared with the liquids employed during the catalyst particle preparation as solvents and/or reaction medium. Suitable examples thereof are silicon oils, perfluorinated hydrocarbons, such as hydrocarbons having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 7 to 14 carbon atoms, with a particularly preferred example being perfluoro octane. Other inert and immiscible liquids may be also employed, including partially fluorinated hydrocarbons, perfluorinated ethers (including polyethers) and partially fluorinated ethers, as long as these liquids are inert towards the catalyst component and provide inclusions in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Preferably, such liquids are employed in combination with a suitable surfactant, which stabilizes the inclusions during the preparation of the solid particles. For example, surfactants, e.g. surfactants based on hydrocarbons (including polymeric hydrocarbons with a molecular weight e.g. up to 10 000, optionally interrupted with a heteroatom(s)), preferably halogenated hydrocarbons, such as semi-, or highly-fluorinated hydrocarbons optionally having a functional group, or,  preferably semi-,  highly- or perfluorinated hydrocarbons having a functionalised terminal, can be used. Surfactants can also be formed by reacting a surfactant precursor bearing at least one functional group with a compound being part of the catalyst solution or solvent and being reactive with said functional group. Examples of the surfactant precursors include e.g. known surfactants which bear at least one functional group selected e.g. from -OH, -SH, -NH2, -COOH, -COONH2, oxides of alkenes, oxo-groups and/or any reactive derivative of these groups, e.g. semi-, highly or perfluorinated hydrocarbons bearing one or more of said functional groups.<br>
The inclusions in accordance with the present invention typically have a size in the range of 100 nm (widest diameter), although the size is not restricted to this specific value. The present invention also contemplates inclusions having sizes of from 20 to 500 nm, with sizes of from 20 to 400, and in particular from 20 to 200 nm being preferred. In particular sizes from 30 to 100 nm are preferred. The size of the inclusions can naturally vary the<br>
size of the catalyst particles. Bigger particles can have bigger cavities than smaller particles, however, inclusions of bigger particles can also be smaller than the ones of the smaller particles. The size of the inclusions may be controlled by the size of the solid material employed for the provision of inclusions, as outlined above, in connection with the control of the shape of the inclusions. The size of hollow voids, liquid filled hollow voids and partially liquid filled hollow voids may, in particular, be controlled during the preparation of solid particles.<br>
The catalysts in accordance with the present invention are in particular polymerisation catalysts for polymerising olefins, including ethylene, propylene, other alpha-olefins, vinyl compounds such as styrene and styrene derivatives as well as mixtures thereof. The catalyst in accordance with the present invention may be employed in any type of polymerisations, including liquid, slurry and bulk polymerisations, as well as gas phase polymerisations,, and any combinations thereof. In particular the catalyst of the present invention may be employed in multistage polymerisation processes, including at least two polymerisation steps, selected from the polymerisations listed above, or a combination thereof, comprising e.g. slurry or bulk and gas phase polymerisation steps. Additional combinations are e.g. slurry - slurry, bulk - bulk and gas phase - gas phase polymerisations. One of the preferred multistage polymerisations process comprises at least one bulk and at least one gas phase polymerisation. In addition to the actual polymerisation the process can further contain any pre - or post processes, like prepolymerisation step.<br>
The catalyst particles of the present invention furthermore provide the so called replication effect. Polymers produced with the catalysts of the present invention, like the catalyst particles, show a spherical shape with a low surface area. Like the catalyst particles the polymer particles show a particle size distribution, wherein the distribution correlates to the distribution of the catalyst particles, i.e. narrow particle size distribution of the catalyst particles provide narrow polymer particle size distributions, etc. Furthermore the morphology of the polymer particles also correlates to the particle morphology of the catalyst particles. The areas of the catalyst particles constituting the matrix phase comprising the catalytically active sites find their correlation in the product<br>
particles in areas of polymer, while the inclusions of the catalyst particles give rise to hollow voids within the product particles. The catalyst particle morphology accordingly determines the product morphology, so that desired product morphologies may already be adjusted/controlled during the preparation of the catalyst particles.<br>
As derivable from the claims, the catalyst particles in accordance with the present invention may be formed by processes employing the individual components for the catalyst and the agent for providing the inclusions. Said components may be selected of the catalyst components as outlined above, and the preferred embodiments as derivable from the above disclosure. The invention also applies concerning the method of preparing catalyst particles of the present invention.<br>
Preferably the catalyst particles of the present invention are obtained by preparing a solution of one or more catalyst components, dispersing said solution in a solvent, so that the catalyst solution forms a dispersed phase in the continuous solvent phase, and solidifying the catalyst phase to obtain the catalyst particles of the present invention. The inclusions in accordance with the present invention may be introduced by appropriately admixing said agent for forming the inclusions with the catalyst solution, during the preparation thereof or after formation of the catalyst phase.<br>
Suitable processes for mixing include the use of mechanical as well as the use of ultrasound for mixing, as known to the skilled person. The process parameters, such as time of mixing, type of mixing, power employed for mixing, such as mixer velocity or wavelength of ultrasound employed, viscosity of solvent phase, additives employed, such as surfactants, etc . are used for adjusting the size of the catalyst particles as well as the size, shape, amount and distribution of the inclusions within the catalyst particles.<br>
Particularly suitable methods for preparing the catalyst particles of the present invention are outlined below.<br>
The catalyst solution or phase my be prepared in any suitable manner, for example by reacting the various catalyst precursor compounds in a suitable solvent. In one embodiment this reaction is carried out in an aromatic solvent, preferably toluene, so that<br>
the catalyst phase in formed in situ and separates from the solvent phase. These two phases may then be separated and an agent for forming the inclusions may be added to the catalyst phase. After subjecting this mixture of catalyst phase and agent for providing the inclusions to a suitable dispersion process, for example by mechanical mixing or application of ultrasound, in order to prepare a dispersion of the inclusion providing agent in the catalyst phase, this mixture (which may be a dispersion of solid inclusion providing agent in the catalyst phase forming a microsuspension or a microemulsion of droplets of a liquid inclusion providing agent in the catalyst phase) may be added back to the solvent phase or a new solvent, immiscible with the catalyst phase mixture comprising the inclusion providing agent, in order to prepare a mixture (suitable an emulsion) of the disperse catalyst phase in the continuous solvent phase. The catalyst phase, comprising the inclusion providing agent, usually is present in this mixture in the form of small droplets, corresponding in shape and size approximately to the catalyst particles to be prepared. Said catalyst particles, comprising the inclusions may then be formed and recovered in usual manner, including heating steps (for solidifying the catalyst particles) and separating steps (for recovering the catalyst particles). In this connection reference is made to the disclosure in the international applications WO 03/000754, WO 03/000757 and WO 03/051934, disclosing suitable reaction conditions. This disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. The catalyst particles obtained may furthermore be subjected to further post-processing steps, such as washing, stabilizing, coating, prepolymerization, prior to the final use in polymerisation processes.<br>
An alternative to the above outlined method of preparing the catalyst particles of the present invention, in particular suitable for a method employing solid inclusion providing agents, is a method wherein the inclusion providing agent is already introduced at the beginning of the process, i.e. during the step of forming the catalyst solution/ catalyst phase (see example 3). Such a sequence of steps facilitates the preparation of the catalyst particles since the catalyst phase, after formation, has not to be separated from the solvent phase for admixture with the inclusion providing agent.<br>
Suitable method conditions for the preparation of catalyst phase, admixture with the solvent  phase,  suitable  additives  therefore etc.  are disclosed  in  the three  above<br>
mentioned international applications, WO 03/000754, WO 03/000757 and WO 03/051934, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As-is derivable from the above and the following examples, the present invention allows the preparation of novel catalyst particles comprising inclusions. The size, shape, amount and distribution thereof within the catalyst particles may be controlled by the agents for providing inclusions employed and the process conditions, in particular he above outlined mixing conditions.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>
