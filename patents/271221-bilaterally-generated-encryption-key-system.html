Technical Field:<br><br>
The invention relates to Bilaterally Generated Encryption Keys System, a variable password based computationally non intensive symmetric encryption key system dispensing with prior exchange of keys, capable of providing one encryption key for each object exchanged between two parties, two different encryption keys per transaction and a plurality of encryption keys for a session, generating many variable keys of required length from single key input of users and previously unknown users at the instant of transaction, further capable of preventing breach attempts both during session when transactions are in progress and after the session when transactions are completed.<br><br>
Prior art:<br><br>
This application claims the benefit of PCT International Application No: PCT/IN2005/000141 filing date: 04th May 2005, submitted by the same inventor and is hereby incorporated by reference, in its entirety. The priority application disclosed predominant use of the invention as Password. The present application discloses the use as a versatile symmetric encryption key system.<br><br>
Encryption is the process of converting obvious information/data in to non obvious strings of characters, using an encryption key. The non obvious strings of characters are transmitted to the intended receiver, who converts it back to obvious information/data using the same/corresponding decryption key. The method of conversion to non obvious strings of characters and its reconversion back to original message is called Cryptography. The key is secret and known only to sender and receiver to ensure secure exchange of information/data. In the prior art the key must be changed periodically to prevent compromise. There are two main encryption key systems.<br><br>
One of the cryptographic methods is the group of symmetric key methods. For two users to communicate successfully using symmetric keys, each user must use the same key or inverse keys to encrypt the message. Examples of symmetric key cryptosystems are: Block-Cipher algorithms which have further sub categories like Electronic Code Book (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Cipher- i Feedback (CFB), Output-Feedback (OFB) processes, etc. Another popular symmetric key system is the data encryption standard or "DES", published by the National Institute of Science and Technology (U.S) in January 1977 in FIPS-PUB-46. Systems like triple DES and AES are further development of DES method. Some symmetric key systems are known to exist where cryptographic keys are not exchanged but generated both at the sender and the receiver based on a common algorithm using a memorized<br><br>
PIN and the date and/or the time of the day as a dynamic variable. These systems do not provide the level of security provided by other symmetric encryption key systems of prior art as both PIN and dynamic variable are easily obtainable.<br><br>
The second main category of cryptographic methods is the Public key/Private key cryptography system which uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption of messages or data. One of the keys is private and only held by its owner. The other key is public, that is, available to everyone within the network. All information sent to a person is encrypted by a person's public key. This information could be decrypted only by using the person's private key. Public key cryptography is susceptible to spoofing which is illegally substituting a service provider/user or abuse of identity of a service provider/user by unauthorized. Therefore Public Key Private Key method requires a certifying authority, a third party to certify that a service provider is genuine and registered with that certifying authority. Therefore interceding by a third party is necessary to establish trust between communicating parties. Even with certification, problems are often encountered: when certificates are invalid but user believing in the reputation of the SERVICE PROVIDER ignoring the warning on invalid certificate and accessing the website possibly exposing himself to attacks by the unauthorised. In spite of such security certification, attackers have spoofed websites, obtained valuable personal information from users and used the information to commit frauds.<br><br>
A third system called Hybrid encryption which is a combination of Public Key/Private Key for initiating secure session followed by exchange of a single symmetric session key for use in a session. Secure Socket Layer, Transport Layer Security etc come under this system. Though the hybrid encryption systems offer some advantages but the fundamental deficiency of Public Key Private Key system remains and hence are prone to attacks.<br><br>
The computational need of the symmetric key systems' is iow and they are easy to use, however there is a serious disadvantage that the keys are necessarily be changed frequently to ensure safety. Whenever key is changed it has to be communicated to the user. The security of the public key systems is high and the problem of key exchange is eliminated, however the computational need of such systems is extremely high. The disadvantage of both systems is that the cryptographic keys used are too long (24 to 32 characters) to be remembered and therefore stored in a computer or data storage device or sometimes transmitted along with message in hashed condition. In both systems, the authentication of sender/receiver is established  by password. When the password  is breached, encryption key could be accessed and security is breached defeating the very purpose of encryption. Further the same keys are used for a long time spanning many sessions. With advance in technology and increase of processing speeds, encryption keys are breached in matter of hours. The days of using same encryption keys for many sessions or using same keys for a session are numbered.<br><br>
There are many ways in which any person may attempt to break an encryption key without having the key and/or algorithm. Systematic trial by checking for correct value using every possible character combination as keys is the one which succeeds mostly. <br>
This method succeeds because the encryption key is used for many sessions, does not change and unlimited number of attempts are allowed for any one to breech the key. Prior art does not prevent the unauthorized, from making breach attempts. If some one attempts to breach the key, the attempt should be prevented by the system, by not allowing ) more than preagreed number of chances and breach even if happens, shall happen long after genuine transactions are completed. Such features are not available in the prior art.<br><br>
WO 02/073377 date of publication:  19.09.2002 provides password useable as encryption key.  It provides one encryption key per session. It requires memorization to produce password. The password is produced using a graphical user interface, that constraints the number of characters used. It takes the help of other encryption key systems also to initially secure the password. Before the secure session starts, the encryption keys are furnished in less secure user terminals providing opportunity for security breach.<br><br>
Publication No.: US 2005/0050328 dated March 3, 2005 is a mutual authentication protocol integrating an encryption key management system that provides a single session encryption key for securing transactions. This system uses PIN/equivalent to establish authentication. The disadvantages of using single encryption key for a session are similar to use of single password for authentication of a session. After user has been authorized to do transactions and begins the session, some one else could do transactions using remote commands committing financial frauds. Key capture by Spyware/virus/ malicious codes result in breach of security.<br><br>
With the deficiencies of prior art systems and increase of speed of processing, breaking of passwords and encryption keys becomes easier, faster, that weakens the secure data transmission capabilities of prior art. Therefore it is urgently necessary to evolve a system of encryption keys where the keys are useable for securing only one object or only one transaction, so as to make it unviable for any one to attempt breaching of encryption keys; preventing attempts to breach; to combine authentication and securing by encryption together; without memorization; without storing pre-formed keys; with preferably short keys; but providing the required level of security.<br><br>
The present invention dispenses with memorization/prior exchange of keys. The keys of present invention is not pre-formed and stored but generated at the instant of transaction and are shorter than that are used by DES &amp; AES (3 characters for equivalent of DES and 7/11/14 characters for AES -128/192/256 bit, using font/distinguishing property modified characters). Providing one encryption key useable for one object or one transaction does not warrant user being called upon to furnish many keys. The System provides a method for generating many different variable encryption keys from users' single key input. In the present invention, neither the key is static (even within a session) nor unlimited number of attempts are allowed for any one to breech the key. Therefore even shorter length encryption key is useable.<br><br>
The present Invention addresses the needs of Internet transaction security, eliminates the disadvantages and enhances the capabilities of the symmetric encryption key system. The invention combines authentication and securing transactions, provides one encryption key for each object exchanged between two users, two different encryption keys per transaction and a plurality of encryption keys for a session, the key communication is seamlessly integrated in to the process requires no additional effort from user other than the effort required for initial authentication, generates the keys from single key input of users and previously unknown users. It further prevents breach attempts both during session and after the session. Since no third party interceding is required or separate authentication server is required and method of creation of encryption key is simple, it is economical, user friendly, designable encryption key system overcoming the above mentioned deficiencies in prior art.<br><br>
Publication No: US 2004/0123151 publication date 24 June 2004, is a prior art password system using Random Partial Pattern Recognition principle. This system uses an authentication device having patterns as identifying units. Patterns are based on cognitive functions of position in the ordered set of data fields, which are easy to remember and operate. The patterns/pattern forming rules are memorized. This limits the number of patterns used in the authentication device to human memorisable level (about 9 only). Patterns are related to the serial number identifying the patterns. Also the patterns among themselves are related. The graphical characters of password occur at specified field location in graphical user interface corresponding to serial number identifying the patterns. This identifies graphical part of the patterns, serial number wise. The alphanumeric part of pattern is discernible within one password. Existence of relationship and identification of graphical part of the patterns, serial number wise, results in compromise of patterns and subsequent passwords. Patterns are too long and passwords are longer than any other variable password system. Finding characters through graphical user interface using starting point and reading path for each one of the graphical character in addition to keying in alphabets and numbers according to the patterns, is more difficult. The passwords are created with lot of efforts from user and not adoptable for authenticating individual transactions or authenticating objects. The system requires additional securing system to secure transactions and has not disclosed any thing on encryption. Graphical user interface is required to display and can not be used in systems not having suitable display devices such as mobile phones, cameras. Certain features used in the authentication device, such as use of combination of alpha numeric and graphical characters, colours and property modification of characters are part of prior art, which have been adopted to suit the present invention.<br><br>
Object of the Invention: The present invention has the following objectives:<br>
A self reliant system that authenticates by Password, use the same Password as encryption key or modify the Password by padding to generate encryption keys of required length to secure Internet/ network transactions which shall provide encryption keys, linked to the identity of user at the rate of one encryption key for each object exchanged between two parties, two different encryption keys per transaction and a plurality of encryption keys for a session.<br><br>
The system shall dispense with requirement on user to memorize a PIN/characters of Password/Encryption Key. The system shall also dispense with requirement of prior exchange of keys.<br><br>
The security provided by the encryption keys is equal or higher than what is available in the present encryption keys systems and security level is not predetermined by the encryption keys system but designable by service provider suiting the requirement of users. Breach attempts should be prevented when user and service provider are in session as well as after the session ends.<br><br>
The apparatus, method of generation and verification mechanism have to be suitable for generating a multitude of encryption keys, easily so as to make it available for each object/transaction.<br><br>
When human control is required for encryption, it is burdensome for human user to furnish individual encryption keys for every transaction. Hence the system is designed to produce many encryption keys using only one initial password/encryption key furnished by user in a session. Further if the length of the keys required is long, then the system should produce additional characters, without efforts from users, and any desirable length of encryption key is generated.<br><br>
When a service provider has to come across new users/previously unknown users, every transaction of such users has to be secured with separate encryption keys.<br>
Preferably Service provider's systems with higher security shall initiate the secure session using user selected encryption keys, wherein the said selection is communicated indirectly by a set of random numbers which could not be understood except by the service provider. User terminal with lower security shall furnish Passwords/Encryption Keys within secure session. There shall not be interceding between user and service provider to establish trust by a third party such as in Public Key private key system or separate authentication servers.<br><br>
The cost is minimal and commensurate with the security.<br><br>

Bilaterally Generated Encryption Key System:<br><br>
The Bilaterally Generated Encryption Key System is a system that integrates functions of authentication and securing of transactions, providing passwords simultaneously useable as symmetric encryption keys with or without addition of additional characters. The system secures, each one of the transaction initiated by USERs and each one of the object exchanged in transactions by separate keys. The system provides two different computationally non-intensive, symmetric encryption keys linked with USER'S identity to each one of the transactions. The keys are not pre-formed but generated at the instant of transaction. The encryption keys are not exchanged prior to transactions. The exchange of inverse keys is seamlessly integrated in to the transactions and requires no special effort from USER/SERVICE PROVIDER for said exchange of inverse keys. Since multitude of keys could be generated simultaneously or in quick succession using the system and an authentication device, the problem of key changing and key management with large number of service providers and USERs is eliminated. The keys required to be furnished by USER are shorter than the keys of DES/AES, with use of font/distinguishing property variation on characters. The system has wide adaptability to all uses of encryption. The ingenuity of the system is that even the inverse keys, which are a set of random numbers and when unexposed, are used as encryption keys to secure transactions and objects exchanged in transactions. The authentication and securing of individual transactions is done for known USERs, as well as previously unknown USERs. The system provides a computationally non-intensive means of tracing objects to the originator. The system dispenses with memorisation.<br><br>
To generate encryption keys BIGENK system uses a second System of authentication devices termed as Variable Character set system of authentication devices along with repeated variation of font/distinguishing properties and Transformation of CUs/BCs are used to obtain higher variability, safety and flexibility of the authentication devices.<br>
The key generation process follows a challenge/response method, which is implemented, by the system programs and interface programs executable by SERVICE PROVIDER/USER systems. The key generation process is capable of generating three different types of Encryption keys namely Bilaterally Generated Encryption Keys, Non Repeating Bilaterally Generated Encryption Keys and Calls. Included in the key generation process is a method of padding of keys, facilitating increase of key length to specified number of characters<br><br>
Generating multiple Passwords/Encryption keys from single initially furnished Password, is a special method of the present invention, adopted to relieve USERs from furnishing many Passwords/Encryption keys required to authenticate and secure each transaction. <br><br>
The system has a USER Agent software designed to generate plurality of Passwords/Encryption keys, from single initially furnished Password, relieving USER from further input and transact on behalf of USER after initial authentication. The system is designed to secure every individual transaction of Previously Unknown USERs by using a temporary authentication device. The system is designed to perform a number of authentication and transaction security based tasks, which include, but not limited to:<br><br>
1)	Two way authentication and securing by encryption of each and every individual Internet Contract/ Network transactions of USER with different Passwords/encryption keys, furnished by a USER separately for each transaction, inclusive of objects exchanged between USER and SERVICE PROVIDER using one Password furnished by USER and one system generated, as Passwords/ encryption keys for each transaction, including maintaining link between USER and SERVICE PROVIDER from beginning to end of session.<br><br>
2)	Two way authentication and securing by encryption of each and every individual Internet/Network transaction inclusive of objects exchanged, by different variable Passwords/encryption keys with just one Password furnished by a USER at the beginning of a session, using a specially designed USER Agent Software, by using two system generated Passwords/encryption keys for each transaction including maintaining link between USERs and SERVICE PROVIDERS from beginning to end of session and providing proof for all transactions of USER.<br><br>
3)	Two way authentication and securing by encryption of each and every individual Internet/Network transaction inclusive of objects exchanged of a previously unknown USER with different Passwords/encryption  keys,  generating  said  different  Passwords/encryption  keys     from  one Password furnished from a temporary authentication device, by previously unknown USER at the beginning of a session using a specially designed USER Agent Software using two system generated Passwords/encryption keys for each transaction including maintaining link between previously unknown USERs and SERVICE PROVIDERS from beginning to end of session and providing proof for all transactions of previously unknown USER.<br>
To appreciate the invention properly, the disclosure is arranged in the following order: the second system of authentication devices, the key generation process including padding of keys, three types of Encryption keys generated, methods used in authentication/securing, advantageous effects of the invention, modes of carrying out the invention and industrial applicability.<br><br>
Second System of authentication devices: In Bilaterally Generated Encryption Key System, a second System of authentication devices termed as Variable Character Set System of authentication devices are used as means of generating Passwords/Encryption keys by authorised USERs and as means of verifying the Passwords/Encryption keys by <br>
SERVICE PROVIDERS providing access and service to the USERs. They are:<br><br>
1)	Variable Character Sets (VCS)<br>
2)	Master Variable Character Sets (MVCS)<br>
3)	Sub Variable Character Sets(SVCS)<br>
4)	Sub Variable Character Sets of Level 2 or below (SVCSL2, SVCSL3...) The system has the following subsystems:<br><br>
1)	VCS for both SERVICE PROVIDER and USER.<br>
2)	MVCS with a SVCS expressed in brief form for SERVICE PROVIDER and a SVCS for USER.<br>
3)	MVCS with a SVCSL2 or below expressed in brief form for SERVICE PROVIDER and SVCSL2 or below for USER.<br><br>
Any one of the three subsystems is used according to choice of SERVICE PROVIDER or the type of use. All the authentication device mentioned above comprise of an arrangement of a plurality of Character Units (CUs) in which the CUs are identified using unique Serial Number of Character Units/ similar identifiers (SNCUs). The arrangement is designed to obtain different variable Passwords/ Encryption keys formed of all permutations of a selected number of CUs in which the CUs could repeat within a Password/ Encryption key. The CUs consist of either one Basic Character (BC) or a permutation of more than one BC.<br><br>
Basic Character: The basic elements of VCS are the characters used to form CUs. Hence, they are called Basic Characters (BCs). They are single characters selected from any type of characters like Alphabets, Numbers and Symbols of any language or script or number or symbol systems identifiable by USER and SERVICE PROVIDER, with or without any font/distinguishing property such as font type, font size, font colour, Underlined, Bold, Italics, etc. Any representation of objects like diagrams, drawings, images, photos, pictures, sketches, identified as distinct units, with or without any distinguishing property identifiable by USER and SERVICE PROVIDER such as size, colour patterns, shading, Underlined, etc, are also used as BCs.<br><br>
BIGENK System recognises each of the characters distinctly based on font/distinguishing properties of characters. Each BC is formed in a calculated number of ways, which is the product of the number of characters used, and number of each one of the font/distinguishing properties used. If 20 font colours, 20 font types, 10 font sizes, Underlined/Non underlined characters are used, a single BC is formed in 20 X 20 X 10 X 2 = 8000 ways. Without font/distinguishing property variation, it is only one way. Human USERs could recognise some variations in font/distinguishing properties like font colours, Underlined characters easily. Human USERs, only with prior knowledge, could recognise/do variation in font types, Italics, Bold, and font sizes. Some of the font types are written similar to Italics. Large font size is undifferentiated, whether it is Bold or otherwise. Therefore, font/distinguishing properties, which are difficult to recognise, is brought to the prior knowledge of Human USERs. Alternatively, these font/ distinguishing properties are chosen by Human USERs; for example, in a Password/Encryption key, the first character's font type is set to Arial, second character's size is set to 16, third character's is Bold, fourth character is in Italics, or all CUs in the first row will have Arial font, all CUs in the second row will be of size 16, etc. USER objects are able to recognise any font/distinguishing property variations, when programmed and hence use of font/distinguishing property variations is unrestricted and the allowable variation is much larger. Differentiation based on font/distinguishing property variations in non-computer systems like cameras, mobile phones, etc is usable when such hardware are able to differentiate between same characters based on font/distinguishing property. The differentiation based on font/distinguishing property variations is done to the extent the USER/SERVICE PROVIDER are able to recognise and use.<br><br>
USERs without being conversant with a language or number system, use characters from that language or number system, as CUs are seen from VCS and furnished by Human USERs. Scroll/drop down menus, which are unrestricted by any character selection algorithm for choosing characters and changing the font/distinguishing properties and offer freedom to select any character/font/distinguishing properties, facilitate Human USERs to furnish the BCs, easily. The said Scroll/drop down menus are provided in the USER/SERVICE PROVIDER terminals/separate memory device. For USER objects, recognition of any type of character or font/distinguishing properties is programmable. Since forming of CUs is random process, some of the BCs that were originally used to generate CUs are feasibly excluded, from all the CU of a VCS. Even if a few BCs are feasibly excluded in the CUs of a VCS, still for calculation of chance of breach and PSI, the number of BCs used initially to generate CUs only is taken in to account. The total number of BCs required is decided to ensure the number of permutations of BCs forming unique CUs and number of permutations of CUs forming unique VCSs are sufficient to cover the safety requirements of Passwords/Encryption keys and the requirement of unique VCSs for all USERs of a SERVICE PROVIDER. The BCs are selected directly from characters with or without font/distinguishing properties or indirectly by selecting characters and selecting font/distinguishing properties separately and arriving at every possible combination of each of the characters and each of the font/distinguishing properties. This completes selection of BCs. The following is to be taken care: When using numbers and alphabets as BCs, every BC is to be written or printed in unique way and there is no confusion in reading from the VCS. The characters: C, c, I, I, 1, K, k, o, O, 0, P, p, S, s, U, u V, v, W, w, X, x, Y, y, Z and z, are a few, which could be wrongly read.<br><br>
Example of BCs: A, e, 1, 9, &amp;, @, $, A, e, 1, 9, &amp;, @, $, A, e, 1, 9, &amp;, @, $ . Even though same set of Characters are shown 3 times, they are differentiated based on font/distinguishing properties ((Arial font, 10 size, Black, Bold), (Times New Roman font, 12 size, Grey-80%, Italics), (Courier New font, 11 size, Grey-50%, Underlined)) and hence each BC is unique. Examples for font property variations of BCs are given in VCS 5 to VCS 6. Use of large number of BCs with characters from 3 languages, 2 number systems, symbols and pictures to give an idea of possible variations of BCs is shown in VCS 6.<br><br>
Character Unit (CU): CUs provide variability to Passwords/Encryption keys. It is the basic unit of VCS, made of only one BC or a permutation of more than one BC. It is any random permutation of any type of BCs. The advantage of multiple character CUs is that USER has to refer to VCS to get CUs less frequently as compared to single character CUs; (for 6 characters Encryption key, in case of single character CU, USER has to refer to VCS, 6 times but with 2 BCs per CU, USER has to refer to VCS, only 3 times). Higher the number of BCs per CU, higher is the number of possible ways of forming CUs and number of possible ways of forming unique VCSs. Generally, CUs in a VCS have a fixed number of BCs. However, it is permissible to use a limited number of CUs (up to10%) with less number of BCs per CU, i.e. in a VCS, which has mostly CUs of 3 BCs, it is allowed to use CUs of single or 2 BCs up to 10% of total number of CUs. This method further enhances variability of CUs. VCS 2 and VCS 4, illustrate this.<br><br>
Method of generation of CU: The steps are: BCs and the number of BCs per CU are selected in a way convenient to USER to read and reproduce at the time of Password/Encryption key generation. The number of CUs in a VCS is selected, ensuring the resulting number of permutations of CUs forming unique VCSs and the total number of Passwords/Encryption keys generated from the VCS meets the requirement of USER and SERVICE PROVIDER. The mathematical relationship between BCs, CUs, VCS, Passwords/Encryption keys and PSI is taken in to account in selection of BCs and BCs per CU. The CUs are generated by random choice of single BC-CUs or random permutation of multiple BC-CUs using all the BCs selected. The random permutation includes repeating a BC within same CU. For example, say: A to Z, without font/distinguishing property variations are chosen as BCs. Each BC is assigned a serial number (say 1 = A, 2 = B, 26 = Z). The number of BCs per CU is decided. Using a program, random numbers within the total number of BCs are generated (say 24, 3, 13,7,19,5,22,1,9,9 etc.) For single BC-CUs, the random numbers are replaced with BC corresponding to the assigned serial number, which become the CUs (for above serial numbers, the CUs are X, C, M, G. S, A, I, I, etc.). Two, single BC-CUs as obtained in previous step are combined to get 2 BC-CUs (for above serial numbers, the CUs are XC, MG, SA, I I, etc.). Similarly any number of CUs with any number of BCs per CU is formed. Examples: 7, D, 43, Sf, 1A$, 927, sR6@, a7B8*, 7, D, 43, Sf, 1A$, 927, sR6@, a7B8*. Even though, same characters or character strings are shown, 2 times in the above example, they are differentiated based on font/distinguishing properties and hence each of the above CU is unique. For more examples of CUs, VCS 1 to VCS 6 may be referred to.<br>
Variable Character Set fVCSl: It is a list or table or array or matrix, which contains CUs. It is generated either by USER or by SERVICE PROVIDER. It is known only to USER and SERVICE PROVIDER. VCS has a large number of CUs. Each CU is identified by a unique serial number/identifier of CU (SNCU). For USERs to generate CUs/VCS, SERVICE PROVIDER specifies rules or USERs combine BCs in any manner, which is validated for randomness and accepted by SERVICE PROVIDER. If VCS is in rows and columns, SNCUs have to be assigned in a manner, which facilitates easy identification/calculation by USER for USER to read CUs corresponding to SNCUs. In VCSs, no relation ship exists between CUs and SNCUs. Similarly no relationship exists among the CUs, because CUs are randomly generated. Non existence of such relationships, prevent shoulder surfers from extrapolating other CUs. VCS are very simple such as VCS 1 to VCS 4 or complex such as VCS 5 and VCS 6. The choice of complexity of VCS is to be decided by SERVICE PROVIDERS according to the requirements and preference of Human USERs. If a VCS is safeguarded, it is useable for a very long time without replacement. Also, creation of VCS is a simple process, even if there is a need for replacement. VCS, which is used to generate a million or more Passwords/Encryption keys, is printed in a paper or card of size similar to a credit card. VCS also is kept in encrypted file form which requires a portable memory device for USERs.<br><br>
Method of generation of VCS: The number of CUs, in a VCS is decided based on requirements of USERs, the type of Encryption keys (Repeating or Non Repeating), the number of .CUs in a Password/encryption key and PSI. The CUs, generated by following method given under Method of generation of CUs, are arranged sequentially or randomly. <br><br>
The required number of CUs are arranged to any one of the form of list or table or array or matrix suitable to USER to get VCS. Each CU is assigned a unique serial number/identifier. The method of identifying/calculating the serial number/identifier also is specified.<br><br>
Examples of VCS, viz: VCS 1 to VCS 6 are given in Figure 1 to 3. VCS 1 to VCS 4 are simpler type. VCS 5 shows font/distinguishing property variations of characters. VCS 6 is made of characters from 3 languages, 2 number systems, a number of symbols and pictures to show possible variations of VCSs.<br><br>
Master Variable Character Set (MVCS): It is a large VCS defined for use in a system as the Master Variable Character Set, which contains all the Sub Variable Character Sets (SVCS). Many VCS are derived from MVCS. The VCSs derived from MVCS are called SVCS. In case, USERs are allowed to create, SVCSs of their choice, then, MVCS is generated as combined, continuous and non-overlapping list of all SVCSs of all USERs in a system. MVCS is used as the principal authentication device for all USERs in combination with SVCSs, as means of generating encryption keys in the BIGENK system as an alternative to individual VCSs, conferring substantial advantage to SERVICE PROVIDERS.<br><br>
Method of generation of MVCS: The number of CUs are decided considering the requirements of all USERs, USER groups, the type of encryption keys (Repeating or Non Repeating), the number of CUs per encryption key and PSI desired. It is generated following the same method of generation of VCS, except that large numbers of CUs are used. In case, USERs are allowed to create, the SVCSs, then, MVCS is generated as combined, continuous and non-overlapping list of all SVCSs of all the USERs in a system. Example: MVCS 1 is given in Figure 4. &gt; Sub Variable Character Set (SVCS): SVCSs are used in combination with MVCS, as means of generating encryption keys in the BIGENK System as an alternative to individual VCSs, which confer substantial advantage to SERVICE PROVIDERS. They are identified for use by any one USER or any one category of USERs and are derived from MVCS if generated by SERVICE PROVIDER. Each SVCS has any number of Ctls of MVCS arranged in any order. <br><br>
SERVICE PROVIDER defines the rules for framing SVCSs in terms of SNCUs of MVCS, similar to criteria for filtering records of a data table. In addition, discrete, continuous or random sequences of CUs of MVCS are used to form SVCS. SVCS have a few mutually non-exclusive CUs. The extent of non-exclusive CUs is limited in order that no specific relationship is established, between CUs of two SVCSs by comparing SVCSs of same origin. This way a large number of SVCSs are formed out of one MVCS. CUs are selected from MVCS, as given here and arranged in to get a SVCS. These rules are also programmed to get SVCSs. The CUs of SVCSs are assigned SNCUs independent of SNCUs of MVCS. A Serial number/identification number is assigned to each SVCS. Prefixing or suffixing identification number of the SVCS of MVCS with Encryption key is used to identify any Encryption key specific to a particular SVCS of the MVCS. In case, USERs are allowed to create, SVCSs, USERs create it in the same manner of creation of VCS. For USERs, there is no difference between individual VCS and SVCS functionally. SERVICE PROVIDER maintaining separate SVCSs in complete form is dispensed with. SVCS as a list of SNCUs of MVCS is only to be maintained. SERVICE PROVIDER specifies rules of framing SVCS in terms of SNCUs of MVCS or specifies only the SNCUs of MVCS for each SVCS. When SVCS is specified by rules, it is briefer than a VCS of equal size, exception being small SVCSs with too few CUs. When SVCS is specified by SNCUs of MVCS, it is mostly in sequences and each of such sequence is briefly indicated by just 2 SNCUs; In both cases SVCS are represented by unique SNCUs of MVCS, more briefly than a VCS of same number of CUs, exception being small SVCSs with too few CUs. USERs are given complete SVCS. The Encryption key calls are in SNCUs of SVCS. When validating Encryption keys, the validating program compares with CUs of MVCS corresponding to the SNCUs of SVCS. Even if a SVCS is compromised or physically stolen, the MVCS is still unchanged and another SVCS is made out of the MVCS.<br><br>
Example of Specifying SVCS by rules:<br><br>
a)	All CUs of MVCS, whose SNCUs are between 57 and 157 and are of even number,<br><br>
b)	All CUs of MVCS, whose SNCUs are between 39 and 88 and written in descending order,<br><br>
c)	All CUs of MVCS, whose SNCUs are between 47 and 295 and Modulus (SNCU, 5) = 3, etc. Example of generation of SVCS and Specifying SVCS by SNCUs of MVCS: MVCS 1 has been used to generate a few 50 CU, SVCS in the following manner:<br>
SVCS Identification	SNCUs forming SVCS	Number of SNCUs, which represent<br>
SVCS<br>
AA	1 to 50	2<br>
AB	46 to 95	2<br>
AC	91 to 140	2<br>
AD	136 to 185	2<br>
AE	181 to 231	2<br>
AF	226 to 275	2<br>
AG	271 to 300, 1 to 5, 75 to 80, 130 to 137, 49, 167	8<br>
AH	183 to 192, 27 to 36, 254 to 263, 130 to 139, 75 to 84	10<br><br>
And so on i.e.: many more are created. From the above examples it is inferred that SVCS is represented in a briefer way than a VCS of same number of CUs. It is also inferred that many SVCSs are derived from one MVCS with less than proportionate number of CUs required for all the SVCSs. The 8 SVCS shown in the example are shortly, represented by a total of 30 SNCUs of MVCS. Instead of storing 8 X 50 = 400 CUs, only 300 CUs and 30 SNCUs need be stored, which shows the possible reduction of data storage. With many more possible SVCSs, the high advantage of using MVCS/SVCS arrangement is obvious.<br><br>
Sub Variable Character Set of Level 2 or below (SVCSL2. SVCSL3...): SVCSs of level 2 or below are also used in combination with MVCS, as means of generating encryption keys in the BIGENK system as an alternative to individual VCSs, which confer substantial advantage to SERVICE PROVIDERS. It is further derivation from SVCS identified for use by any one-subgroup USER or any one-subgroup category of USERs. <br><br>
This way large number of USERs with subgroup and subgroup of subgroups are formed. SVCSs of level 2 or below are derived from one level up SVCS and are any combination of parts of one level up SVCS. For SERVICE PROVIDERS, deriving SVCS of level 2 or below from one level up SVCS is similar to deriving SVCS from MVCS. USERs optionally select the required number of CUs randomly, out of CUs of one level up SVCS provided by SERVICE PROVIDER. SERVICE PROVIDER maintaining separate SVCS of level 2 or below in complete form is dispensed with. SVCS of level 2 or below as a list of SNCUs of MVCS is only to be maintained. SERVICE PROVIDER specify rules of framing SVCS of level 2 or below in terms of SNCUs of MVCS or only SNCUs of MVCS for each SVCS of level 2 or below. When SVCS of level 2 or below is specified by rules, it is briefer than a VCS of equal size, exception being small SVCSs of level 2 or below with too few CUs. When SVCS of level 2 or below is specified by SNCUs of MVCS, it is in sequences and each of such sequence are briefly indicated by just 2 SNCUs; In both cases a SVCS of level 2 or below are represented by unique SNCUs of MVCS, more briefly than a VCS of same number of CUs, except for small SVCSs of level 2 or below with too few CUs. USERs are given complete SVCS of level 2 or below <br>
The Encryption key calls are in SNCUs of SVCS of level 2 or below. When validating Encryption keys, the validating program compares with CUs of MVCS corresponding to the SNCUs of SVCS of level 2 or below. Even if a SVCS of level 2 or below is compromised or physically stolen the MVCS/one level up SVCS is still unchanged and another SVCS of level 2 or below is made out of the one level up SVCS.<br><br>
Combined Use of MVCS and SVCSs: A SERVICE PROVIDER, having large number of USERs, instead of registering large number of VCSs, at the rate of one per USER, registers one MVCS in his system and defines the rules for framing as many SVCSs required or specify only SNCUs of MVCS for each SVCS. As shown in the examples given above, many SVCSs are derived from one MVCS with less than proportionate number of CUs required for all the SVCSs. SERVICE PROVIDER maintaining separate SVCSs in complete form is dispensed with. SVCS as a list of SNCUs of MVCS is only to be maintained. Unique SNCUs of MVCS represent SVCS, more briefly than a VCS of same number of CUs, exception being small SVCSs with too few CUs. Therefore reduction of data storage from many VCS to one MVCS and as many SVCS represented briefly, is obtained by combined use of MVCS and SVCSs. SNCUs of separate VCSs are diverse, their referral, calling the values in to software programs etc., have to be different for each VCS. SNCUs of MVCS representing the SVCSs are unique. Referral, calling the values in to software programs etc., is same for all SVCSs. Each VCS also have to be defined in the software programs separately, devoting a few lines for each VCS. When SVCSs are used, this is dispensed with. This facilitates easy identification of SNCUs or CUs of SVCSs, in software programs, with fewer lines of programs. It also is necessary for classification of USERs on access. Even when, USERs are allowed to create, SVCSs, MVCS/SVCSs arrangement is used so that facility of easy identification in programs and automatic classification of USERs on access is still available and data storage is only slightly increased. MVCS/SVCS arrangement is useful when separate identity and authentication is required to access specific sub domains within a domain. MVCS/SVCS arrangement is convenient for short time use spanning a session, in authentication and securing transactions of a session by forming authentication device of the session of USER initiated actions/objects, linking with the identity of USERs. MVCS/SVCS arrangement provides advantage and convenience to SERVICE PROVIDER. However, Use of individual VCS or MVCS/SVCS arrangement is optional.<br><br>
Combined Use of MVCS and SVCS of level 2 or below: Use of MVCS and SVCS of level 2 or below is similar to use of MVCS/SVCS and confers similar advantages, but for lower reduction in data storage.<br><br>
Repeated variation of font/distinguishing properties in printed Variable Character Set system of Authentication Devices: It is an optional method to enhance security and capabilities of VCS. In this method, USER, optionally, proposes changes to font/distinguishing properties such as font type, size, colour, Underlined, Bold, Italics, patterns, shading, as means of differentiation between same characters of Password/CUs of VCS of any level in use, and SERVICE PROVIDER registers the changes. <br><br>
Alternatively, a SERVICE PROVIDER issues variation of font/distinguishing properties at regular intervals and USER agrees. USER uses a separate transparent sheet to the size of printed Variable Character Sets/Sub Variable Character Sets of any level, indicating font/distinguishing property variation. Willing USER memorizes changes. The changes are kept separately from VCS of any level. The changes are allowed at any time and any number of times. When font/distinguishing property variation is effected, the original characters of CU in the VCS remain the same but BCs and CUs become different. If 'HX' is an original CU, a font/distinguishing property varied CU could be 'HX'. The VCS in physical form remains unaltered, but the VCS as authentication device gets changed and new CUs/VCS of any level in use is obtained. This flexibility of varying BCs and CUs retaining original characters enables, securing the VCS against compromise. It also provides safety that even a stolen VCS could not be used, as font/distinguishing properties altered are unknown to any one except the USER and SERVICE PROVIDER. <br><br>
It facilitates longer span of use of VCS retaining original characters. Same VCS are used in any number of SERVICE PROVIDERS also, with one set of font/distinguishing properties applied to CUs of VCS for each SERVICE PROVIDER<br><br>
Transformation of Variable Character Set: It is an optional method, for deriving new CUs of VCSs instantly at the time of Response to a Call, by operating any rule or rules on a VCS by which the original CUs of a VCS becomes transformed to new CUs. This is used to secure VCS against theft or compromise, similar to varying font/distinguishing properties. Transformations are done on CUs or BCs. Few examples of rules of transformation are given below, using VCS1 as original VCS:<br><br>
SNCU of VCS (Transformed) = SNCU of VCS (Original) + 27, for all SNCUs. Applying this rule on VCS1 SNCUs of transformed VCS are {28, 29, 30, 31. ..97, 98, 99,100, 1, 2, 3, 4 ...24, 25, 26, 27 of VCS 1} SNCU of VCS (Transformed) = (SNCU of VCS (Original) -10) for all SNCUs. Applying this rule on VCS1 SNCUs of transformed VCS are {91, 92 ... 99,100, 1, 2, 3, 4 ...87, 88, 89, 90 of VCS 1} When the SNCU of transformed VCS after operating the rule becomes negative, the total number of SNCUs of the original VCS has to be added to the figure to obtain the transformed SNCU. When it exceeds the total number of SNCUs of the original VCS, then the total number of SNCUs of the original VCS has to be deducted to the figure to obtain the transformed SNCU.<br><br>
Transformation is also done on BCs. In this, the BCs are transformed by rules such as all 'A's are transformed to 'E', all 'B's are transformed to 'F', all 'C's are transformed to 'G', etc. For higher security, rules that are more complex or combination of rules are applied. The rules are changed at any time. Similar to font/distinguishing property variations, the transformation rules have to be registered with SERVICE PROVIDER and kept separately from original VCS. Willing USER memorises the transformation rules. At the time of Response, USERs have to furnish CUs of transformed VCS from the original VCS by operating the pre-registered rules. Transformation rules are also specified by SERVICE PROVIDERS to be followed by USERs. Transformation is an additional safety measure, is used as a supplement to font/distinguishing property variation or independently.<br><br>
Key Generation Process: The process checks, "what the user has" to establish the authenticity. The USER and SERVICE PROVIDER use a pre agreed authentication device of VCS system of authentication devices, to generate Passwords/Encryption keys. <br><br>
The Encryption key comprises of a permutation of selected number of CUs of the authentication device. Optionally same CUs are repeated in Encryption key. When a USER wants to initiate a transaction with a SERVICE PROVIDER, the USER approaches the SERVICE PROVIDER by opening the website or dialogue window or simply switching on a system. The SERVICE PROVIDER asks the USER to furnish the USER name or identification number such as credit card number. If USER name or identification number is unregistered, SERVICE PROVIDER reminds the USER to furnish correct USER Name and denies access after few chances. SERVICE PROVIDER after verifying USER name and referring to the pre agreed VCS for the particular USER, generates a specified number of random numbers each of which is equal to or less than the total number of CUs in the VCS and validates the random numbers for pre-agreed rules, such as non-repetition of random numbers. SERVICE PROVIDER then transmits the generated random numbers to USER, which is termed as a Call. The USER understands that these random numbers are SNCUs of the pre agreed VCS and USER has been called to furnish CUs corresponding to the called SNCUs, which is the Encryption key for that transaction. USER'S Response to this Call is by furnishing CUs whose SNCUs are the random numbers of Call, in the order of Call. The Encryption key is furnished as a continuous string of CUs, combining all CUs of Encryption keys with BCs indistinguishable as belonging to particular CU of the authentication device. A Call could include identification number of a Sub Variable Character Set of any level. When Call includes identification number of a Sub Variable Character Set of any level, the Response also includes identification number of that Sub Variable Character Set of any level. The SERVICE PROVIDER verifies that each CU/SVCS Identification number furnished by the USER is correct and matches exactly as per the pre agreed VCS corresponding to the Call. When it is matched, the USER is authenticated and the key furnished is validated. <br><br>
Otherwise, the USER is given a few more chances to furnish the correct Encryption key. When USER fails, to furnish the correct Encryption key within given chances, the transaction is aborted and subsequent attempt to take place only after specified time and the USER is to furnish 2 Encryption keys successively or equivalent stronger Encryption key, entered in first chance itself to proceed with transactions. In case the USER is unable to furnish Encryption key in a double Encryption key Call or double strength Encryption key Call at first chance, the USER is denied access until USER establishes his authenticity to the satisfaction of the SERVICE PROVIDER through other means.<br>
When the USER and SERVICE PROVIDER are in session, incorrect response fails as detailed above. When the USER and SERVICE PROVIDER are not in session and a USER attempts to open an encrypted message such as a saved message, system is designed to reject after allowing specified number of chances, noting the date, time of rejection, and no further attempts are allowed. For this purpose, the system creates a file having failed attempt data in the USER'S system, created only if there is a failure; such file's access is restricted to particular encrypted message by a strong password. Whenever a USER not in session, attempts to open an encrypted message the decrypting system looks for file having failed attempt data in the main drive of USER'S system. If such file is not there, user is allowed specified number of chances. If USER fails, the file is created in the USER'S system. USER must furnish password to delete the file. The password is not related to the VCS of USER or encryption key and only could be obtained from SERVICE PROVIDER to recover the message. Recovery of such message shall be effected in the following manner: SERVICE PROVIDER sends the password to delete the file having failed attempt data. After deleting this file, USER is allowed to furnish key again, referring to VCS. If unauthorised persons attempts at the password for deleting the file he/she might have to do thousands of times to breach the password first and then attempt at the encryption key. If unauthorised persons attempts use another system to decrypt, he/she has to use thousands of systems to breach the encryption key. After such enormous efforts, even if one succeeds, the particular message only is seen and there is no further use of the encryption key. By this provision, unauthorised persons breach attempts are effectively prevented.<br><br>
Example of an authentication/key generation dialogue in Internet, between a USER, say <br>
USER1 and SERVICE PROVIDER say SP1, (who have pre agreed on VCS 1) is given below: USER1 has opened the website of SP1, indicating his desire to do transaction and approached SP1. SP1      : Please enter your USER name USER1:USER1 SP1       : 70, 31,43 USER1 : @xlmrA<br>
SP1      : Welcome "USER1" (Welcome implies that USER1  has furnished the correct Password/ Encryption keys)<br><br>
Example of an authentication/key generation dialogue in Internet between USER1 and SP1 when USER1  commits mistakes in furnishing CUs,  rejected after 3 chances and after specified time reattempts:<br><br>
USER1 has opened the website of SP1<br>
SP1      : Please enter your USER name<br><br>
USER1:USER1<br>
SP1       : 4,100, 43<br>
USER1:ZADJRA<br>
SP1      : The Encryption key you furnished is incorrect. Please enter the correct Encryption key for<br>
4,100,43 USER1 : zadjra SP1      The Encryption key you furnished is incorrect. Please enter correct Encryption key for 4,100,<br>
43. Reminder: Last Try. USER1 : ZaDjRa<br>
SP1      : Sorry. You have furnished incorrect Encryption keys thrice. ACCESS DENIED. You may retry after 2 hours.<br>
USER1 after 2 hours has opened the website of SP1. SP1      : Please enter your USER name USER1:USER1<br>
SP1      : 71, 34, 85, 29, 96, 52. Reminder: Only one chance is allowed. USER1 : FmOvclwlblxP SP1      : Welcome "USER1" (Welcome implies that USER1 has furnished the correct Encryption key)<br><br>
Thus an Encryption key is formed in an easy manner, using simple means of VCS. The Encryption keys are variable based on combination of random numbers for every transaction. They are also generated just at the instant of transaction.<br>
Bilaterally Generated Encryption Keys: It is an Encryption Key, generated using the BIGENK System. In BIGENKs, any CU is called repeatedly; i.e. any SNCU that has been called previously for an Encryption key is called repeatedly for subsequent Encryption keys without any restriction. BIGENKs repeat rarely. When VCS 1 is used, on a 6-character Encryption keys chance of repetition is 1 in a million. Chance of repeating an Encryption key is equal to that of any other variable Password of same Basic Characters. Therefore, it remains unused even when stolen, as none could predict, when the same Encryption keys will be called for, again. Repeated variation of font/distinguishing properties of VCS/Transformation of VCS is done optionally at any time and any number of times after the VCS is issued.<br><br>
Method of generation of BIGENK: SERVICE PROVIDER'S program, calls for random numbers within the total number of CUs of the VCS and validates the random numbers for predetermined rules specified. After furnishing of BIGENK by USER, it compares, admits or rejects BIGENK. It limits the number of chances and Call for two BIGENK successively/stronger Encryption keys, when there is a failure from USER to furnish Encryption keys within specified number of chances. It also furnishes report of all Encryption keys calls with time and failed attempts. It validates and accepts font/distinguishing property variations/ Transformations done by USER.<br><br>
Non-Repeatinq Bilaterally Generated Encryption Key (NRBIGENK): It is an Encryption key, generated using the BIGENK system in which Encryption keys never repeat. In a BIGENK, any CU that has been called previously for an Encryption key is called again for subsequent Encryption keys without any restriction. In a NRBIGENK, there is some restriction on calling CUs repeatedly. In each Call of NRBIGENK, a fixed number of CUs (say 2 out of 3 CUs) have to be called for the first time. The balance (say 1 out of 3) only to be repeated. In case SVCS identification is required, it is also called for, along with CUs similar to BIGENK. It is to prevent spying for CUs. With NRBIGENKs, even when some body knows a number of CUs of the VCS of a USER, still will be unable to furnish the Encryption keys. These Encryption keys are used up before anybody attempts to steal. Thus, NRBIGENK is a still more secure Encryption keys. Font/distinguishing property variations are effected/Transformation is done in NRBIGENK also, after issue of VCS. The VCS exhausts as and when the last CU that has to be called for the first time is called. After Font/distinguishing property variations/Transformation, the CUs/VCS become new.<br><br>
Method of generation of NRBIGENK: SERVICE PROVIDER'S program is similar to BIGENK with following additions: It maintains a list of already called SNCUs against each VCS, compares/limits the SNCUs to be repeatedly called and Calls for random serial numbers from the yet to be called list. It reports well in time, the exhausting of VCS so that replacement is arranged or USER is prompted to vary font/distinguishing properties of CUs/ Transformation of VCS.<br><br>
Padding of keys: BIGENKs are stronger than existing encryption key systems, requiring less number of characters per key. However, the system uses variable length encryption keys generated from single encryption key during a session, which are short. To provide for generating any required number of characters for a given encryption key, padding is required. Padding of the keys is the process of addition of characters to the user furnished encryption key/Call to make keys with required number of characters. When font/distinguishing properties are not used in the BCs, 8 to 32 characters are required for a key. Even though BIGENK system of authentication devices could produce any required number of characters by calling corresponding number of CUs, to further reduce the USER'S efforts a method of addition of characters is provided:<br><br>
The number of characters of Password is known to the user, from which the required number of padding characters are calculated. The BCs of Password/Encryption key are converted to the assigned serial number, when forming the VCS. These are random numbers say Rj. The geometric mean of these random numbers say 'M' is calculated. If 'M' is a round number, 'M' is multiplied by the constant "rr' and the result is taken as 'M'. If M is not a round number, then the decimal characters are extracted from M, which is the seed 'So'. Any mathematical or statistical function such as Fishers Number, Standard normal cumulative distribution, (see below for formulae), logarithm, etc that takes a single input value and gives an output value is operated on 'So'.<br><br>
Fisher Number of x = 0:5 log e ((1 +x)/(1 -x))<br>
(-X2/2)<br>
Standard normal cumulative distribution of x = (1/V (2*TT))* e<br><br>
The decimal characters are extracted from the output value, which is Si. The random numbers Rj are then split to single digits.say di, d2, CI3... di etc. One or more characters to be padded P1 is selected from each of one of the output value S1 corresponding to the position of characters of di; say for p1 to p4 the characters occurring at 'di + 1' th position to di + 1+4 th position of S1 is selected. Then S1 is again operated with mathematical or statistical function, the decimal characters are extracted to get S2. p5to Ps are the numbers occurring at 'd2+1' th position to d2+1+4 th position of S2. If the first few digits of Si are 0 then S1 is multiplied by 10/100/1000 etc, to make Sj is equal to or more than 0.1.<br><br>
The padding characters are added to password in the following manner. If d1 is even number, p1 to P4 will be first 4 characters of Encryption key. Followed by one CU. If di is odd then CU will be first followed by p1 to P4. The same criterion is followed until all CUs of Password exhausted. Then all remaining padding characters are appended to the string so obtained.<br><br>
An example is given below to explain the concept clearly for the first example of Password/encryption key: '@xlmrA', using Fisher number as character generating function: If 24 characters are required for encryption key, number of characters required for padding is 24-6=18, In VCS 1, A to Z, a to z, 0 to 9, @, $ in order have been assigned serial numbers from 1 to 64.<br><br>
The Ri are 63, 50, 38, 39, 44, 1; M = 24.29043201569940; S0 =0.29043201569940; Fisher Number of So = Si= 0.2990380125784810; d1= 6; P1 to p4   = 0125<br>
52	= 0.3084628099253110; d2 = 3; p5 to p8   = 4628<br>
53	= 0.3188456841256790; d3 = 5; p9 to P12 = 5684<br>
54	= 0.3303616344624050; d4 = 0; p13 to p16 = 3303<br>
55	= 0.3432341380650000; d5 = 3; P17 to p18 = 23<br><br>
Since d1 is even, 62, d3 are odd and only 3 CUs are in the Password the following is the padded encryption key:<br>
0125 @xlm 4628 rA56 8433 0323.<br><br>
The algorithm for padding is a matter of prior agreement between users. The padding process is done by the software and user is not required to do any calculation in this aspect. The padding algorithm above uses data from the Password but does not reveal any thing related to VCS. By this method, even though numbers only are used, the position occurrence of numeric character is varied on par with characters of password making the encryption key as strong as the one, which is directly made from VCS. The same method is used for padding calls also, taking the password corresponding to the call for generating numbers. However to provide variability between padding keys of Password and that of call, the following changes are done: Instead of geometric mean, harmonic mean is used when generating 'M'. One or two but not all, the CUs of the password, is/are added following the above given procedure.<br><br>
The USER is required to furnish only the unpadded key as obtainable from VCS. The software is designed to pad the keys as per the choice of algorithm made by USER and furnish for encryption/decryption.<br><br>
Methods used in securing transactions:<br><br>
Generating multiple Encryption keys from one Password/encryption key: This is a special method designed to relieve USERs from furnishing many Passwords/Encryption keys for securing every transaction. The authentication device has same number of BCs per CU for all CUs to facilitate identification of CUs directly from Password/Encryption key. The Call is for a minimum of 4 CUs to ensure that at least 60 unique BIGENKs are formed out of SVCS/SVCS L2, using 2 CU, 3 CU and 4 CU calls with different permutations at random. The method of generating multiple Encryption keys from single Password/Encryption keys uses an USER Agent Software. The USER Agent Software collects the Call and Password/Encryption keys for initial access from USER. From the Call and Password/Encryption key, number of CUs in the Password/Encryption key and CUs are determined. USER Agent Software then forms a SVCS of any Level, using all CUs as obtained above. Then it assigns SNCUs. SNCUs so assigned need not be continuous and preferably having 2 or more digits/characters, to facilitate higher variability. For example: 304A, 427b, 550C, 673d, 796E	etc, are useable as Serial Number/identifiers. SNCUs are communicated to SERVICE PROVIDER using the<br>
Password/Encryption keys as obtained above as encryption key. When the first unexposed Call is used as SNCUs, the assignment of SNCUs and communication is avoided. The same procedure is adopted for temporary SVCS also. The SVCS of any level, so formed by USER Agent Software is used as the authentication device of that session. All Calls are made within the authentication device of that session.<br>
An example of this method is given below using VCS 3.<br><br>
SERVICE PROVIDER'S Call	: 51,133, 27,150, 48, 44<br>
USER'S Response (Encryption key)        : AmRQ5o<br>
SVCS formed	I SNCU I 16    I 37    I 58    I 79    I 100 I 121<br>
CU	A        m       R        Q       5        o<br>
	I	I	I	L	!	I	<br><br>
The SNCUs are assigned here independently and communicated to SERVICE PROVIDER. When SERVICE PROVIDER'S Call is unexposed, then 51,133, 27,150, 48, 44 are useable as SNCUs. <br><br>
Example of Calls within SVCS: (i) 79, 16, 58, 100 (ii) 121, 37, 16(iii)79, 37 (iv) 16, 58, 100, 79, 121, 37 Responses	: (i) QAR5 (ii) omA (iii) Qm (iv) AR5Qom<br><br>
The above SVCS is capable of providing 1950 unique Encryption keys. Additional 1949 unexposed Calls are also available to secure objects exchanged in the transactions, making 3899 encryption keys from this SVCS.<br><br>
USER Agent Software: USER Agent Software is a specially designed software, representing USER and transacting with SERVICE PROVIDER. It is integrated with Internet Contract/Network Transaction software or used as independent software. USER Agent Software adopts to USER name as Internet Protocol/Network address of the computer wherefrom, USER accesses SERVICE PROVIDER. It functions from USER'S system to perform authentication/securing of individual transactions. Records Internet Protocol/Network address of SERVICE PROVIDER, forms authentication device of the session and generates multiple Passwords/Encryption keys from a single Password/Encryption keys furnished by USER Authenticates USER for individual transactions comprising seeking Call, furnishing Response, confirming correctness of Calls, Password/Encryption Keys and allowing specified number of chances to rectify, Exchanges objects after securing and access restricting the said objects to Internet Protocol/Network address of SERVICE PROVIDER. Checks for origination of USER'S message from USER'S system by ensuring continuity of connection with SERVICE PROVIDER, ensuring the integrity of command to do the Internet Contract/Network Transaction, through checking the keyboard and other input entries. Passes on the objects received from Service Provider to USER after checks such as presence of virus. If authentication fails, informs the USER to decide corrective action and allows USER doing authentications directly. It denies access to unauthorised USER created Internet Contract/Network Transactions, blocks the unauthorised user, from substituting the USER/ USER Agent Software/SERVICE PROVIDER, through any other computer and rejects the attempts to originate Internet Contract/Network Transaction from the USER'S Computer, through remote commands. It advises SERVICE PROVIDER on end of transactions and exiting. It is programmed to assist user in authentication, securing and performing transactions.<br><br>
Internet Contract Transactions/Network Transactions (ICT): ICT is any Internet transaction, which has some monetary or other value. As SERVICE PROVIDERS allot, USER accounts, USER names and VCSs, only after the USER accepts the conditions of contract, between USER and SERVICE PROVIDER, ICTs include any or all Internet transactions between USER and SERVICE PROVIDER, with a USER account. Temporary USERs who do not have direct account with a SERVICE PROVIDER still transact, using the account with ISP/Network Server after getting the request forwarded by ISP/Network Server. Transactions on credit card, debit card, bank transactions, share market transactions, buying, selling, payment, receipt, gift, bet, sending/receiving emails, accessing information in websites, downloading software or articles, sending or receiving data packets or files, are a few examples of ICTs. There are three methods of authentication and securing of ICTs as detailed below:<br><br>
Securing of each individual transaction of Known USERs: In BIGENK System, when required, authentication/securing is done for each of the transaction (i) by obtaining Password/Encryption key from USER at the rate of one for each transaction, (ii) by generating multiple Passwords/Encryption keys from one Password/Encryption key initially furnished by a USER. First method is used in automatic transactions between systems (USER and SERVICE PROVIDER are objects), or the security of transactions require individual Passwords/encryption keys, directly from authentication device. <br>
Second method is used for all ICTs of established USERs other than specific cases covered in the first method.<br><br>
Securing of every individual transaction of previously unknown USERs: A previously unknown USER is a USER who is yet to establish an USER account with the SERVICE PROVIDER with whom USER wants to transact and includes temporary/short duration USERs excused from having an USER account. Examples: USERs before setting up an account, one time USERs like, participants in auctions. The system provides for a method to confirm the identity of a previously unknown USER from an ISP with whom that previously unknown USER has an USER account. A temporary authentication device and a Call are passed through the ISP, in an access-restricted folder after ISP authenticates the USER to SERVICE PROVIDER. Previously unknown USER is provided with the Password directly from SERVICE PROVIDER to open the access-restricted folder. The previously unknown USER opens the access restricted folder and furnishes Password to the Call sent to him, from when on the previously unknown USER becomes an authenticated temporary USER to that SERVICE PROVIDER. Then each one of the transactions of previously unknown USER are authenticated and secured by generating multiple Passwords/Encryption keys from one initially Password furnished from the temporary authentication device.<br><br>
Securing Transactions and Objects exchanged in transactions: In BIGENK System, Call is a permutation of random numbers and variable for every transaction. The string formed by Call of random numbers, is used as additional variable Password or encryption key. This is beneficially used to secure transactions in the following manner. In BIGENK System the objects are exchanged in folders/packets containing unexposed Calls, Passwords, encryption keys and file or messages. The initial Call is sent in unencrypted form. Sending initial Call by user in unencrypted form facilitates USER with low security USER system to request relatively higher security SERVICE PROVIDER system to initiate secure session, with the initial key specified by the USER. It also prevents spoofing by unauthorised SERVICE PROVIDER who could not identify the encryption key specified by the USER and could not commence transactions. The Password for the initial Call is used as the first encryption key. Using this, the first object exchanged is encrypted and sent. When mutual authentication is performed, the Call and Response of mutual authentication are available as additional encryption keys, before transactions start. When mutual authentication is not performed, the initial Password is used as encryption key for the first object exchanged in the first transaction. All subsequent Calls are sent in encrypted form and unexposed. Therefore, all Passwords, and all Calls other than initial Call are unexposed and useable as encryption keys, to secure every one of the transactions and objects exchanged in transactions. Two encryption keys are available for each transaction. Using the Call for a transaction for object exchange from USER to SERVICE PROVIDER and the Password for a transaction for object exchange from SERVICE PROVIDER to USER is a preferred option. However, all Passwords and all unexposed Calls are usable to secure any subsequent transaction. The choice of specific Call or specific Password from among the Calls or Passwords generated up to that transaction in a session for encrypting and access restricting a specific folder is by availability or by prior agreement between USER and SERVICE PROVIDER. Padding of keys is used when necessary. Any one of the prior art cryptographic methods of are used for encryption/decryption using encryption keys produced by the system. The cryptographic method is pre agreed. A combination of encryption as well as access restriction is used, so that even when some one is in possession of decryption key, still the object is inaccessible. Since encryption keys and Password are at times, different, Password is tested separately with in the encrypted folder.<br><br>
Access restriction and ensuring continuity of link: In Internet transactions, access restriction is done by ensuring IP address from which the USER/USER Agent Software or SERVICE PROVIDER are transacting, remains one and the same from beginning to end of session and by obtaining a variable Password/ Encryption key known only to USER/USER Agent Software and SERVICE PROVIDER for each object exchanged from that IP address. The method of access restriction to specific IP address supports likelihood of masking of IP addresses, continuously changing of IP addresses, using proxy servers, or similar techniques. Access restriction to specific folder is also done when required.<br><br>
Distinct features of BIGENK System: Integrates functions of authentication and securing of transactions. The system is usable for securing transactions of a USER for a session or for each transaction or for each object exchanged between SERVICE PROVIDER and USER. The system is self-reliant to provide two different computationally non-intensive, symmetric encryption keys linked with USER'S identity to secure each one of the Internet/ network transactions of USERs and a plurality of keys for a session. The string formed by Call of random numbers is designed to serve as variable Password/encryption key. Therefore, two different means for two-way authentication/securing are possible using BIGENK System. The system secures each one of the Internet/network transactions of previously unknown USERs in a similar manner to that of a known USER. The system is designed to generate many different Passwords/Encryption keys, from a single Password initially furnished by a USER. This relieves USER from furnishing many Passwords/ Encryption keys, which are required to authenticate and secure every transaction and objects exchanged in every Internet/Network transaction. The system provides a direct and computationally non-intensive means of tracing objects to the originator providing definite proof for solving and Internet transaction related claims. <br><br>
Calling two Encryption keys or equivalent stronger Encryption key in only one chance prevents unauthorised parties making repeated attempts on encryption keys, provides resistance to breaking and automatically notifies genuine USER on failed attempts. It is also designed to test physical availability of authentication device with USER after a failed attempt. Preventing breach attempts is not available in prior art systems. Even if some one manages to break the encryption key, it will be too late as the real transactions would have been completed long before and the discovered key is not going to be used further.<br><br>
In the system, memorisation is not required. The system has done away with the limit on total number of CUs in the authentication device imposable by memorisation. The system has done away with the limit on Call of random numbers imposable by memorisation. VCS system of authentication devices is used by the system. The Passwords/Encryption keys are unique for each Call and there are no multiple possibilities. Therefore, validation of encryption keys of BIGENK System is only a comparison and is a computationally non-intensive. Multitudes of Passwords/Encryption keys are generated simultaneously or in quick succession. The key management is simple, the keys are computationally non-intensive and keys are variable for every object exchanged. Avoiding memorisation and difficult procedures in the system help in automatic generation of many encryption keys without difficulty and facilitate transactions without human intervention. The system provides temporary authentication device for a previously unknown USER generating variable passwords/Encryption keys to authenticate/secure transactions of previously unknown USER. The system generates Passwords/Encryption keys of any required level of safety. User includes persons and objects.<br><br>
As font/distinguishing property is used, the character variability is larger and number of characters required to produce keys equivalent to keys of DES/AES is less. A Table comparing BIGENK and DES/AES keys is given in Figure 4, for VCS 1 and VCS 5. From the table it is clear that the keys of BIGENK System with font/distinguishing property variation are shorter than other systems.<br><br>
Advantageous effects of the Invention, with reference to Background Art:<br>
In BIGENK System, securing system is integrated with authentication. Availability of computationally non-intensive, symmetric encryption keys at the rate of one for each object, two for each transaction and many for a session with many advantageous features of BIGENK system is unavailable in prior art. ICTs authentication and securing of each one of the transactions with multiple Passwords/encryption keys generated out of single Password/Encryption key USER input, from known and Unknown USERs is a special feature unavailable in prior art. Preventing breach of keys by unauthorized persons both within the session and outside the session is also not available in prior art. The securing keys are shorter than that are used in prior art.<br><br>
There is no need of bringing an intermediary certifying authority to establish trust between USER and SERVICE PROVIDER as in Public/Private Key system. In transactions related to Credit/Debit Card, at present PIN is used in ATMs, signature is used in merchant outlets and card number is used for web transactions. All the three methods are having different level of security and are susceptible for attacks. Since the present Invention is easily applicable for all types of internet transactions, a single method of authentication and securing of transactions is applied to Credit/Debit Card transactions with required level of security. More important is that the insecurity of furnishing USER Name/Credit/Debit Card number on line is totally eliminated.<br><br>

Modes of carrying out the Invention:<br><br>
Internet Contract Transactions/Network Transactions OCT): In the methods, a few common procedures are used. Of these, securing transactions and object exchanged in transactions, access restriction and ensuring continuity of link, generating multiple Passwords/encryption keys from one Password and Padding of keys have already been explained. The other common procedures are explained here to avoid repetition.<br><br>
Chance to correct: All Calls, Passwords/encryption keys are verified for correctness and preagreed number of chances are allowed to rectify. Only on failure to rectify within the given chances, SERVICE PROVIDER/USER/USER agent software exit. Lapse of specified time or inability to open or decrypt folders indicate inability to correct and the parties exit. Exiting transactions are done duly advising the other party, when feasible.<br>
Checking objects exchanged: It is an optional step to check objects exchanged before accepting or saving the files in their respective systems. The checks are for compliance of regulations, contract conditions, and freedom from undesirable programs like virus.<br><br>
The methods are explained and will be readily understood by the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate like structural elements. Only the main steps and important details are shown in drawings. More details are added in the disclosure. Ancillary steps, modifications to the steps and further detailing may be done suiting the SERVICE PROVIDER/USER/type of transaction. The examples furnished here are with unpadded encryption keys which user is expected to furnish.<br><br>
Method of authenticating and securing of every individual Internet Contract/Network transactions of USER with one Password/encryption key furnished by a USER for each transaction: Figure 5 is the flow chart of this method. In this, a USER (100) having an USER account with SERVICE PROVIDER (SP), having website (201) doing transactions is illustrated.<br><br>
In step (U1), USER (100) accesses SP's website (201) by opening the website window; records IP address of SP (202), furnishes USER Name, 100 to SP, refers to authentication device(103) and issues a Call (107) within 103, to SP. This Call is termed as initial Call of the session. This Call is made in open network, is considered as exposed, and is unusable as encryption key.<br><br>
In step (S1), SP checks 100, if 100 is unregistered, SP refers back. If 100 is registered, SP records IP address of USER (102); locates authentication device (203) pertaining to 100; checks whether the Call is within 203, if the Call is beyond 203, refers back; otherwise, SP creates a folder (205) containing Password/encryption key (206) for 107, Call (207) termed as ' SERVICE PROVIDER'S first Call ' and any message to USER (208), the SP wants to communicate; encrypts 205 using 206, access restricts 205 to 102 using 206 as <br>
Password and sends to USER.<br><br>
In step (U2), USER opens and decrypts 205 using preagreed cryptographic method and 206, which is obtained from 103; checks 206; exits if 206 is incorrect; otherwise creates a folder (105) containing Password/encryption key (106) for 207 and any message to SP (108); encrypts 105 using 207, access restricts 105 to 202 using 207 as Password and sends to SP.<br><br>
In step (S2), SP opens and decrypts 105, verifies 106; exits if USER authentication fails within allowed chances; if passes, creates a folder (209), containing next Call (210), authentication message to USER (211) encrypts 209 using 106, access restricts 209 to 102 using 106 as Password and sends to USER. In step (U3), USER opens and decrypts 209; gets 210 &amp; 211; proceeds with next step.<br><br>
In step (U4), USER creates a folder (109) containing Password/encryption key (110) for 210 &amp; ICT message (111) encrypts 109 using 210 &amp; access restricts 109 to 202 using 210 as Password and sends 109toSP In step (S3) SP opens and decrypts 109, verifies 110; checks 111 contents for acceptability; creates a folder (212) containing, next Call (213) &amp; SP's ICT message (214) encrypts 212 using 110; access restricts 212 to 102 using 110 as Password and sends 212 to USER In step, (U5) USER opens and decrypts 212, checks 214 contents for acceptability. If required to continue, proceeds to step U4, else advise SP and exits.<br><br>
In step (S4) SP exits on advise from USER/lapse of specified time/incorrect Passwords or encryption keys/unable to decrypt.<br><br>
The   steps    U4,    S3,    U5   are   repeated   for   every   transaction,    with    subsequent   folders,<br><br>
Passwords/encryption keys, Calls and ICT messages.<br><br>
The method uses one Password/encryption key per transaction furnished by a USER. The method is independent of external securing system to secure transactions. Object exchanges are secured by system   generated   Call/encryption   key.   Two   way   authentication   and   access   restriction   of objects/messages exchanged ensures continuity of link between SERVICE PROVIDER and USER from beginning till end of session. USER and SERVICE PROVIDER use software programs designed to<br>
implement the method.<br><br>
Example of a stock market transaction requiring  individual authentication and securing of each transaction is given below;<br><br>
USER1 is a client and SP1 is a stockbroker. VCS 4 is the preagreed VCS. The initial dialogue prior to commencement of transactions is<br><br>
SP1      : Please furnish USER name<br>
USER1;USER1<br>
SP1, verifies USER1, if available, records IP address of USER1<br><br>
USER1 : 24, 53 (Call in open network)<br>
SP1, checks whether the Call is correct . If correct, creates a folder containing   <br>
Password/Encryption<br><br>
Key : IAGNTN, Call : 43, 36 &amp; message to USER1. Encrypts and access retricts the folder using an encryption key derived by padding "IAGNTN" and sends to USER1.<br>
USER1  recieves the folder from SP1, opens and decrypts the folder using    "IAGNTN", verifies Password/encryption key is "IAGNTN" and gets the Call of SP1.<br>
USER1  creates a folder containing Password/encryption key to SP1's Call: RNNSWH, message encrypts and access retricts the folder using an encryption key derived by padding "4336" and sends to SP1<br><br>
SP1 opens and decrypts the folder from USER1, using   "4336"  checks the Password/encryption key furnished by USER1, finding it correct, issues a welcome message, next Call 2, 67, encrypts and access retricts the folder using " RNNSWH" and sends to USER1. <br><br>
When   USER1    has   created   first   order   say   salel,   creates   a   folder   containing   salel   and Password/encryption key: DWPP, encrypts and access restricts the folder using   "267" and sends to SP1.<br><br>
SP1 receives, opens and decrypts using "267", verifies the Password/encryption key and salel for compliance of rules and then despatches it to stock exchange. SP1 creates a folder containing an acknowledgement message, next Call: 56, 22, encrypts and access restricts the folder using "DWPP" and sends to USER1.<br><br>
USER1 receives opens and decrypts using "DWPP" verifies the acknowledgement message, notes the next Call, and proceeds with next order/transaction if required. If not required, advises SP1 and exits.<br><br>
Method of authenticating and securing of every individual Internet Contract/Network transaction generating many Passwords/encryption keys from single Password furnished by USER: Figure 6 is the flow chart of this method. In this, a USER (100) having an USER account with SERVICE PROVIDER (SP) having website (201), doing transactions, using USER Agent software (UAS) (300) is illustrated.<br><br>
The steps U1, S1 and U2 are the same as in the method of authentication and securing of every ICT/Network Transactions with one Password/encryption key furnished by a USER for each transaction.<br><br>
The step S2 is also the same except that the Call 210 is not sent to USER. These steps are not repeated here.<br><br>
In step (U3) USER opens and decrypts 209; if authentication is successful, USER authorizes USER Agent software (UAS) to act further.<br><br>
In step (A1) UAS collects 207 &amp; 106, forms authentication device of the session (104) with 106 as Character Units &amp; 207 as Serial Number of Character Units; (It is a convenient option; UAS could assign different Serial Number of Character Units and communicate it to SP using 106 to encrypt and access restrict); accesses 201; records 202; furnishes USER Name 300 &amp; requests for Call. After SP responds receives, opens and decrypts 212, gets 213.<br><br>
In step (S3) SP checks IP address of 300, if it is same as 102, creates a folder (212) containing Call (213) within 104, encrypts 212 using 106, access restricts 212 to 102 using 106 as Password/encryption key and sends to UAS.<br><br>
In step (A2) UAS receives ICT message (111) from USER; checks for origination of message from within 100 such as continuity of connection of 100 with SP, integrity of command to do the ICT, through checking keyboard and other input entries; creates a folder (112) containing, 111, Password/encryption key (113) for 213, encrypts 112 using 213 &amp; access restricts 112 to 202 using 213 as Password and sends 108toSP<br>
In step (S4) SP opens and decrypts 112, verifies 113; checks 111 contents for acceptability; creates a folder (215) containing next Call (216), SP's ICT message (217) &amp; encrypts 215 using 113; access restricts 215 to 102 using 113 as Password and sends 215 to UAS.<br><br>
In step, (A3) UAS opens and decrypts 215, gets 216; checks 217 contents for acceptability and passes it to USER. If required to continue, proceeds to step A2 else advise SP and exits.<br><br>
The steps A2, S4, A3 are repeated for every transaction, with subsequent folders, <br>
Password/encryption keys, Calls and ICT messages.<br><br>
In step (S5) SP exits on advise from USER/lapse of time/incorrect Password/encryption keys/unable to decrypt.<br><br>
The interaction between USER agent software and SERVICE PROVIDER takes place without efforts from USER. Only when authentication fails, it is brought to the notice of USER for USER to decide corrective action. Since SVCS/SVCS L2 is formed out of the USER'S VCS/SVCS, it is also possible to do authentication/securing directly by USER, if USER has noted down the initial Call of random numbers or Password. When necessary, USER, at any time, interrupts the USER Agent Software. ICTs created by other than authorised USER could not have access to SVCS/SVCS L2 applicable for that session. <br><br>
Any other person/object could not do ICT from any other computer in the name of USER1, because of access restriction to IP address, which differs. Even if it is attempted to originate ICT through the USER'S computer, by remote commands, the keyboard entries and USER'S commands differ and USER agent software rejects it. Thus, only authenticated ICT is sent to SERVICE PROVIDER and vice versa and every ICT is authenticated with a Password/encryption key of the USER. It also ensures that the file or data packet containing ICTs exchanged between USER and SERVICE PROVIDER are access restricted between SERVICE PROVIDER and USER using Password/encryption key or Call. USER is authenticated once and his actions are authenticated using the same Password/encryption key with no further inputs from USER, who has option to do authentication directly or at any time interrupt USER Agent software. An exact link between USER and actions of USER is established, pinpointing, which USER did which ICT from which computer at what time using which Password/encryption key, which is of definite use to solve ICT related claims. All actions of a USER are traceable from the moment a USER enters Internet through an Internet Service Provider, if all his transactions are treated as ICTs and effected in the manner laid down here. This is of immense use, in a time, when computers are illegally taken over and abused without knowledge of owners.<br><br>
The method is characterised by using a USER Agent Software, to generate many variable Password/encryption keys from one initial Password/encryption key furnished by USER, at the beginning of the session; authenticating and securing transactions using Call and Password as two different computationally non intensive encryption keys linked to USER'S identity to each one of the Internet/network transactions between USER and SERVICE PROVIDER; two way authentication and access restriction of objects/messages exchanged using two different Passwords/encryption keys for each transaction; ensuring continuity of link between SERVICE PROVIDER and USER from beginning till end of session; providing proof for every Internet Contract/Network Transaction of USERs; providing means of tracing all actions of USERs from access to exit, to solve Internet Contract/Network Transaction related claims. The method is independent of external securing system to secure transactions. USER and SERVICE PROVIDER use software programs designed to implement the method.<br><br>
Example: Example of individual email authentication using the method of authenticating and securing of every individual Internet Contract/Network transaction generating many Password/encryption keys from single Password/encryption key furnished by USER is given below:<br><br>
USER1 is the USER, SP1 is the email server, and UAS is the email software, which functions as USERI's agent. VCS1 is the pre agreed VCS. USER1 has opened the website of SP1, indicating his desire to do email transaction and approached SP1.<br>
SP1      : Please enter your USER name<br><br>
USER1:USER1<br>
SP1, verifies USER1, if available, records IP address of USER1 USER1 : 73, 41, 100, 9 (Call in open network)<br>
SP1, checks whether the Call is correct. If correct, creates a folder containing Password/encryption key : MmzdjGd , Call : 56, 2, 33, 87 and message to USER1. Encrypts and access retricts using "HmzdjGd" and sends to USER1.<br>
USER1 recieves the folder from SP1, opens the folder by furnishing Password/encryption key "HmzdjGd", decrypts using "HmzdjGd" and gets the Call of SP1.<br>
USER1 creates a folder containing Password/encryption key to SP1's Call: 2J1D960G and message, encrypts and access retricts the folder using "5623387" and sends to SP1<br>
SP1 opens and decrypts the folder from USER1, using "5623387" checks Password/encryption key furnished by USER1, finding it correct, welcomes USER1 (Welcome implies that USER is authenticated).<br>
USER1 authorises UAS, passing on the Call: 56, 2, 33, 87 and Password/encryption key 2J1D960G<br><br>
UAS forms SVCS as below. Accesses SP1, furnishes USER Name, and seeks a Call.<br>
SNCU I 56 | 2    l 33 I 87<br>
CU	2j     1D    96    OG<br>
SP1 checks  IP address of UAS and if it is same as that of USER1, creates a folder containing a Call<br>
56, 87, 33, encrypts and access restricts using 2J1D960G and sends to UAS.<br>
UAS, receives opens and decrypts using "2J1D960G", gets the Call and awaits ICT from USER1. <br><br>
When USER1 has created first email say emaiM, it is passed on to UAS. UAS checks whether USER1, is logged in to the account, the commands match the emaih, creates a folder containing emaill, and  Password/encryption key: 2jOG96, encrypts and access restricts the folder using "568733" and sends to SP1.<br><br><br>
SP1 receives, opens and decrypts using   "568733", verifies   Password/encryption key and emaill for compliance of rules and then despatches it to the email address concerned. SP1 creates a folder containing an acknowledgement message and next Call: 56, 87 encrypts and access restricts the folder using"2jOG96" and sends to UAS.<br><br>
UAS, receives, opens and decrypts using "2JOG96", and verifies the message contents for acceptability and   passes   on   to   USER.   Retains   the   Call.   Subsequent   emails   could   have   Calls   and Password/encryption keys as below:<br><br>
Email2, Call: 56, 87	Password/encryption key: 2jOG<br>
Email3, Call: 87, 56, 2, 33	Password/encryption key: OG2J1D96<br>
EmaiW, Call: 56, 33, 2	Password/encryption key: 2J961D, etc.<br><br>
Method of authentication and securing of every individual Internet/Network transaction of a previously unknown USER generating different Password/encryption keys from one Password/encryption key: Figure 7 is the flow chart of this method. In this, a previously unknown USER (100/301) having an USER account with Internet SERVICE PROVIDER/Network Server (ISP), establishing authenticity to SERVICE PROVIDER having website (201) through the ISP and doing transactions, using USER Agent software is illustrated.<br><br>
In step (U1), USER with IP address 102 and USER Name with ISP as 301, requests ISP (400) to arrange dialogue with SP, furnishing IP address of SP (202) In step (ISP1), the ISP authenticates 301 with a Password (306) between USER &amp; ISP; forwards USER'S request to SP (201) with USER details In step (S1), SP considers the request. If unwilling to transact with 301, sends unwillingness to ISP. If willing to transact, creates a folder (405) containing temporary SVCS (403) meant for ISP, a Call (407) from 403, a sub folder (205) containing USER Name (100), temporary SVCS meant for the previously<br>
unknown USER (203), a Call (207) from 203 &amp; message (208), encrypts 205 with a Password to be sent later (206) &amp; access restricts 205 to 102 using 206 as Password and sends 405 to ISP In step (ISP2), the ISP conveys SP's unwillingness to USER if so received.  If folder is received, opens folder 405, furnishes Password (406) for 407 to SP &amp; passes on 205 to USER; ISP exits, after sending the folder to 301. <br><br>
In step (S2), SP checks 406 received from ISP; if it is correct, then it sends 206 direct to previously unknown USER along with encryption algorithm. <br><br>
In step (U2) previously unknown USER exits if SP unwilling to transact or gets 206 &amp; encryption algorithm; opens 205 and gets 100, 203, 207 &amp; 208.<br><br>
In step (U3) previously unknown USER accesses SP's website (201); records IP address of SP (202), furnishes USER Name 100, creates a folder (105) containing,  Password/Encryption Key (106) for 207 to .<br><br>
SP; encrypts 105 using 207, access restricts 105 to 202 using 207 as Password and sends to SP.<br><br>
In step (S3) SP checks  100,  records IP address of previously unknown  USER (102);  locates authentication device (203) opens and decrypts 105, verifies 106; If found correct, advises previously unknown USER'S successful authentication; from this stage previously unknown USER, becomes an authenticated but temporary USER to SP; SP sends USER Agent software on request. SP exits if USER authentication fails, within 3 chances. <br><br>
In step (U4) 100, authorizes UAS to act further, if authentication successful.<br>
The steps that follow (A1), (S4), (A2), (S5), (A3) and (S6) are similar to steps (A1), (S3), (A2), (S4), (A3) and (S5) of the method of authenticating and securing of every individual Internet Contract/Network transaction generating many Password/encryption keys from single Password/encryption key furnished by the USER. Other than the steps of initial authentication of previously unknown USER, this method has similar characteristic features of the previous method and hence not repeated here.<br><br>
Example of a transaction of previously unknown USER participating in an auction is given below;<br><br>
PUUSER wants to participate in the auction conducted by SP1. PUUSER is not registered with SP1.<br>
PUUSER has account with ISP1.<br><br>
PUUSER requests ISP1 to arrange a dialogue with SP1. ISP1 authenticates PUUSER with a Password.<br>
Passes on the request to SP1.<br><br>
SP1 has MVCS1 as the authentication device. SP1 sends an SVCSr with SNCUs from 1 to 8 and Call :<br>
7, 4, 1 meant for ISP1 and SVCSn having SNCUs from 161 to 169 for PUUSER and Call 167, 169, 164,<br>
166 meant for PUUSER, access restricts folder containing SVCSn, Call and Message to PUUSER's IP<br>
address, with a Password " PN3CRA" and sends to ISP1.<br><br>
SVCSr	SVCSn<br>
ISP1 furnishes Password: P4CT6C to SP1 and passes on the folder containing SVCSn to PUUSER.<br><br>
SP1 after verifying Password from ISP1, sends PUUSER, the Password "PN3CRA" to open the folder.<br><br>
PUUSER's opens the folder, using "PN3CRA", gets SVCSn, Call. Furnishes Password/encryption key:<br><br>
DDHNS1DZ. SP1 verifies and accepts to transact with PUUSER.<br>
PUUSER gets UAS, authorises UAS.<br><br>
UAS forms SVCSL2 as shown and seeks a Call.        Il67|l69|l64|l66<br>
~DD[HN1SI 1DZ~<br>
SP1 issues Call: 166, 164, 167, encrypts using "DDHNS1DZ".<br><br>
UAS opens and decrypts the folder from SP1 using "DDHNS1 DZ" and gets the Call.<br>
PUUSER participates in auction, witnesses bids in progress, makes the first bid say bidl,  and passes it to UAS. UAS verifies the origination of message and creates folder with bidl, Password/encryption key:<br><br>
DZS181, encrypted and access restricted using "166164167" sends it to SP1.<br>
SP1 receives, opens and decrypts, checks Password/encryption key and if correct accepts bidl Sends acknowledge ment, next Call in folder encrypted and access restricted with "DZS181" and sends to UAS.<br><br>
UAS receives, opens and decrypts, checks and if everything is correct sends it to PUUSER, retains the Call. Awaits further bids from PUUSER.<br><br>
The succeeding bids could have the following Calls and Password/encryption keys<br>
Bid2, Call: 164, 169	Password/encryption key: S1HN<br>
Bid3, Call: 166, 169, 167	Password/encryption key: DZHNDD, etc.<br>
