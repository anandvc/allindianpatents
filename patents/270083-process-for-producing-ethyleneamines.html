Description<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing ethylene amines by reaction of nnonoethanolamine (MEOA) with ammonia in the presence of a heterogeneous transition metal catalyst.<br>
Ethylene amines are used, inter alia, as solvents, stabilizers, for the synthesis of chelating agents, synthetic resins, drugs, inhibitors and surface-active substances.<br>
Diethylenetriamine (bis(2-aminoethyl)amine; DETA), in particular, is used as solvent for dyes and is a starting material for the production of ion exchangers, pesticides, antioxidants, corrosion inhibitors, complexing agents, textile assistants and absorbents for (acidic) gases.<br>
Numerous processes for preparing ethylene amines are described in the literature.<br>
According to PEP Report No. 138, "Alkyl Amines", SRI International, 03/1981, in particular pages 7, 8. 13-16, 43-107, 113, 117, the reaction of dichloroethane with ammonia at a molar ratio of 1:15 gives diethylenetriamine (DETA) in a proportion of greater than 20% by weight based on the ethylene amines formed. However, 40% by weight of higher ethylene amines are formed in addition to 40% by weight of ethylenediamine (EDA).<br>
The formation of these higher ethylene amines (i.e. ethylene amines having a boiling point above that of triethylenetetramine (TETA)) can be substantially suppressed in favor of ethylene diamine by amination of monoethanolamine (MEOA) with ammonia (cf., for example, the abovementioned PEP Report, US 4,014,933 (BASF AG)). However, aminoethylethanolamine (AEEA) and piperazine (PIP) are formed as by¬products in this reaction.<br>
Ind. Eng. Chem. Prod. Res. Dev. 1981, 20, pages 399-407, (CM. Barnes etal.) describes the ammonolysis of MEOA to EDA over nickel catalysts on a mixed Si02-AI2O3 support. Addition of water and the powdered catalyst is said to be advantageous in increasing the yield of EDA.<br>
Disadvantages of these technologies involving suspension catalysis result, inter alia, from the need to separate the catalyst from the product. In addition, the selectivities, e.g. for the formation of DETA, are in need of improvement.<br><br>
WO-A-05/014523 (BASF AG) relates to a process for preparing ethylene amines (e.g. DETA) by reaction of monoethanolamine (MEOA) with ammonia in the presence of a catalyst in a reactor (1) and fractionation of the resulting reaction product mixture, with ethylenediamine (EDA) obtained in the fractionation being reacted in a separate reactor (2) in the presence of a catalyst to form diethylenetriamine (DETA) and the resulting reaction product mixture being fed to the fractionation of the reaction product mixture resulting from reactor 1.<br>
The earlier German patent application No. 102005019373.0 of April 26. 2005 (BASF AG) relates to a process for preparing ethylene amines in which ethylene oxide is reacted continuously with ammonia under water-free conditions over an inorganic ion exchanger in a first reaction step to give a reaction product comprising monoethanolamine diethanolamine and triethanolamine in a particular weight ratio and the reaction product is subsequently reacted continuously with ammonia in the presence of hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst in a second reaction step.<br>
A parallel German patent application filed on the same date (BASF AG) relates to a process for preparing ethylene amines by reaction of ethylenediamine (EDA) in the presence of specific shaped heterogeneous catalyst bodies.<br>
A parallel German patent application filed on the same date (BASF AG) relates to a process for preparing aminodiglycol (ADG) and morpholine by reacting diethylene glycol (DEG) with ammonia in the presence of specific shaped heterogeneous catalyst bodies.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to remedy the disadvantages of the prior art and discover an improved economical process for preparing ethylene amines, in particular ethylenediamine (EDA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), aminoethylethanolamine (AEEA), piperazine (PIP), triethylenetetramine (TETA) and/or higher linear polyethylene amines.<br>
The process should give the acyclic amines such as ethylenediamine (EDA) and diethylenetriamine (DETA), in particular, in high yields, space-time yields and selectivities.<br>
For example, the proportion of ethylenediamine and diethylenetriamine among the ethylene amines formed in the product mix should be increased compared to the prior art, e.g. greater than 70% by weight, and the proportion of piperazine (PIP) among the ethylene amines formed should be able to be limited according to requirements, e.g. to below 20% by weight, at a total yield of MEOA of, in particular, greater than 70%.<br>
[Space-time yields are reported in "amount of product/(catalyst volume • time)" (kg/(lcat. • h)) and/or "amount of product/(reactor volume • time)" (kg/(lreactor • h)].<br><br>
We have accordingly found a process for preparing ethylene amines by reacting monoethanolamine (MEOA) with ammonia in the presence of a heterogeneous transition metal catalyst, wherein the catalytically active composition of the catalyst before treatment with hydrogen comprises oxygen-comprising compounds of aluminum, copper, nickel and cobalt and the shaped catalyst body has a diameter of 
'^,<br>
where Ap is the external surface area of the catalyst particle (mms2) and Vp is the volume of the catalyst particle (mmp2).<br>
The surface area and the volume of the catalyst particle (the shaped catalyst body) are derived from the geometric dimensions of the particle (the shaped body) according to known mathematical formulae.<br>
The volume can also be calculated by the following method, in which:<br>
1.	the internal porosity of the shaped body is determined (e,g, by measuring the<br>
water absorption in [ml/g of cat] at room temperature and a total pressure of<br>
1 bar),<br>
2.	the displacement of the shaped body on immersion in a liquid is determined (e,g. by displacement of gas by means of a helium pycnometer) and<br>
3.	the sum of the two volumes is calculated.<br>
The surface area can also be calculated theoretically by the following method, in which an envelope of the shaped body whose curve radii are not more than 5µm (in order not to include the internal pore surface area by "intrusion" of the envelope into the pores) and which contacts the shaped body very intimately (no plane of section with the support) is defined. This would clearly correspond to a very thin film which is placed around the shaped body and a vacuum is then applied from the inside so that the film envelopes the shaped body very tightly.<br>
The monoethanolamine (H2N-CH2-CH2-OH; MEOA) required as starting material can be prepared by known methods, for example by reaction of ethylene oxide (EO) with ammonia.<br><br>
The reaction according to the invention is generally carried out at an absolute pressure in the range 1-250 bar, preferably 100-220 bar, in particular 150-200 bar, and generally at elevated temperature, e.g. in the temperature range 100-300°C, in particular 130-230°C, preferably 170-220°C.<br>
MEOA and ammonia are preferably used in a molar ratio in the range NH3:MEOA = 1-15, particularly preferably in the range NHsiMEOA = 4-13, very particularly preferably in the range NH3: MEOA = 7-11.<br>
In general, the catalysts used in the process of the invention are preferably used in the form of catalysts which either consist entirely of catalytically active composition and, if appropriate, a shaping aid (e.g. graphite or stearic acid) or are composed of the catalytically active components on a largely inactive support material.<br>
The catalytically active composition can be introduced into the reaction vessel as powder or crushed material after milling or preferably be introduced into the reactor as shaped catalyst bodies, for example as pellets, spheres, rings, extrudates (e.g. rods, tubes) after milling, mixing with shaping aids, shaping and heat treatment.<br>
The concentrations (in % by weight) indicated for the components of the catalyst are in each case, unless indicated otherwise, based on the catalytically active composition of the catalyst produced before treatment with hydrogen.<br>
The catalytically active composition is defined as the sum of the masses of the catalytically active constituents and preferably comprises, before treatment with hydrogen, essentially the catalytically active constituents oxygen-comprising compounds of aluminum, copper, nickel and cobalt,<br>
The sum of the abovementioned catalytically active constituents, calculated as AI2O3, CuO, NiO and CoO, in the catalytically active composition before treatment with hydrogen is, for example, from 70 to 100% by weight, preferably from 80 to 100% by weight, particularly preferably from 90 to 100% by weight, in particular from 95 to 100% by weight, very particularly preferably from &gt; 99 to 100% by weight.<br>
The oxygen-comprising compounds of nickel, cobalt and copper, in each case calculated as NiO, CoO and CuO, are preferably comprised in the catalytically active composition (before treatment with hydrogen) in total amounts of from 10 to 80% by weight, particularly preferably from 15 to 60% by weight, very particularly preferably from 20 to 40% by weight, with the molar ratio of nickel to copper particularly preferably being greater than 1.<br><br>
The catalytically active composition of the preferred catalysts in the process of the invention, comprises, before treatment with hydrogen,<br>
from 20 to 90% by weight, preferably from 40 to 85% by weight, particularly preferably from 60 to 80% by weight, of oxygen-comprising compounds of aluminum, calculated as AI2O3,<br>
from 1 to 30% by weight, preferably from 2 to 25% by weight, particularly preferably from 3 to 20% by weight, of oxygen-comprising compounds of copper, calculated as CuO,<br>
from 1 to 40% by weight, preferably from 3 to 30% by weight, particularly preferably from 5 to 20% by weight, of oxygen-comprising compounds of nickel, calculated as NiO, with the molar ratio of nickel to copper particularly preferably being greater than 1, more preferably greater than 1.2, particularly preferably from 1.8 to 8.5, and<br>
from 1 to 40% by weight, preferably from 3 to 30% by weight, particularly preferably from 5 to 20% by weight, of oxygen-comprising compounds of cobalt, calculated as CoO.<br>
The catalysts having the composition mentioned can be produced by various methods. For example, they can be obtained by precipitation processes and preferably impregnation processes known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Particularly preferred catalysts in the process of the invention are the catalysts which are disclosed in DE-A-19 53 263 (BASF AG) and comprise cobalt, nickel and copper and aluminum oxide and optionally silicon dioxide and have a metal content of from 5 to 80% by weight, in particular from 10 to 30% by weight, based on the total catalyst, with the catalysts comprising, calculated on the basis of the metal content, from 70 to 95% by weight of a mixture of cobalt and nickel and from 5 to 30% by weight of copper and the weight ratio of cobalt to nickel being from 4:1 to 1:4, in particular from 2:1 to 1:2, for example the catalyst used in the examples there which has the composition 10% by weight of CoO, 10% by weight of NiO and 4% by weight of CuO on AI2O3.<br>
The catalyst used preferably has a bulk density in the range from 0.6 to 1.2 kg/I.<br>
According to the invention, it has been noted that particularly high EDA and DETA selectivities are obtained when the catalyst is used in the form of small shaped bodies. For the purposes of the present invention, small shaped bodies are bodies whose diameter in the case of a spherical shape is in each case less than 3 mm, in particular less than 2.5 mm, e.g. in the range from 1 to 2 mm.<br><br>
Correspondingly, small shaped bodies are also ones whose diameter in the case of extrudate form (extrudate length &gt;&gt; extrudate diameter) or whose height in the case of a pellet shape (pellet diameter, pellet height) is in each case less than 3 mm, in, particular less than 2.5 mm, e.g. in the range from 1 to 2 mm.<br>
In the case of all other geometries, the shaped catalyst body used in the process of the invention in each case has an equivalent diameter L = 1/a' of 
 <br>
where Ap is the external surface area of the catalyst particle (mms2) and Vp is the<br>
volume of the catalyst particle (mmp3).<br>
(L = specific dimension of a shaped catalyst body).<br>
In the process of the invention, the diffusion paths of the reactants and also of the products are shorter as a result of the small specific dimension of the catalyst particles. The mean residence time of the molecules in the pores and the probability of an undesirable subsequent reaction are consequently reduced. As a result of the defined residence time, an increased selectivity can therefore be achieved, especially in the direction of the desired EDA and DETA.<br>
The catalyst is preferably present as a fixed bed in a reactor. The reactor is preferably a tube reactor or shell-and-tube reactor. The reaction of MEOA Is preferably carried out in a single pass through the reactor<br>
The catalyst bed is preferably surrounded by an inert material both at the Inlet of the reactor and the outlet of the reactor. As Inert material, It is possible to use, for example, Pall rings, spheres of an inert material (e.g. ceramic, steatite, aluminum).<br>
The reactor can be operated either In the upflow mode or the downflow mode. In the case of the preferred downflow mode, a liquid distributor for the reactor feed is preferably installed at the inlet of the reactor.<br>
To maintain the catalyst activity, preference is given to feeding 0.01-1.00% by weight, particularly preferably 0.20-0.60% by weight, of hydrogen (based on the reactor feed MEOA + NH3) into the reactor.<br><br>
In the preferred continuous operation, selectivities (S) to EDA and DETA of preferably ^ 60%, in particular 70-85%, are achieved at a conversion of 55-90% at an WHSV (weight hourly space velocity) of 0.25-1.25 kg/kg*h, preferably 0.4-1 kg/kg*h, (kg of MEOA per kg of cat. per hour), particularly preferably from 0.5 to 1.5 kg/kg*h.<br>
Small amounts of piperazine (SPIP generally 5-25%), aminoethylethanolamine (SAEEA generally 3-13%) and higher amines (Shigher amines generally 2-12%) are obtained as further products in the process of the invention.<br>
In general, the crude reaction products from the process of the invention comprise only small amounts of cyclic amines as reaction products (in general in amounts of 
In general, the crude reaction products from the process of the invention comprise only small amounts of tertiary amines as reaction by-products (in general in amounts of 
The work-up of the product streams obtained in the process of the invention, which, in particular, comprise the particularly desired EDA and DETA but also N-(2-aminoethyl)-ethanolamine (AEEA), triethylenetetramine (TETA), piperazine (PIP), N-(2-aminoethyl)-piperazine (AE-PIP) and unreacted MEOA, can be carried out by distillation processes known to those skilled in the art. (cf., for example, PEP Report No. 138, "Alkyl Amines", SRI International, 03/1981, pages 81-99, 117, and DE-A-10349059 (BASF-AG)).<br>
The distillation columns required for isolating the individual products, especially the particularly desired EDA and DETA, in pure form by distillation can be designed (e.g, number of theoretical plates, reflux ratio, etc.) by those skilled in the art using methods with which they would be familiar.<br>
The fractionation of the reaction product mixture resulting from the reaction is, in particular, carried out by multistage distillation.<br>
For example, the fractionation of the reaction product mixture resulting from the reaction is carried out by multistage distillation in two separation sequences, with ammonia and any hydrogen present being separated off first in the first separation sequence and fractionation into unreacted MEOA and EDA, PIP, DETA, AEEA, AE-PIP, TETA and higher ethylene amines being carried out in the second separation sequence.<br><br>
The ammonia obtained from the reaction product mixture resulting from the reaction from the fractionation and/or iVlEOA obtained are/is preferably recirculated to the reaction.<br>
Examples<br>
The following catalysts were used for the reaction of MEOA with ammonia to form ethylene amines:<br>
all catalysts were Cu/Co/Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts as disclosed, for example, in DE-A-19 53 263 (BASF AG) and were produced by impregnation.<br>
The catalysts 1-3 had the following composition before treatment (activation) with<br>
hydrogen:<br>
10% by weight of CoO, 10% by weight of NiO and 4% by weight of CuO on gamma-<br>
AI2O3.<br>
Catalyst 1 was in the form of extrudates (diameter D = 4 mm).<br>
Catalyst 2 was in the form of extrudates (diameter D = 2.5 mm).<br>
Catalyst 3 was obtained by appropriate impregnation of a gamma-AbOs extrudate having a diameter of 1.5 mm.<br><br>
^i mean extrudate diameter 2) mean extrudate length<br>
Examples 1-3:<br><br><br>
It can be seen from the examples that increased conversions in the direction of EDA and DETA are achieved as the size of the shaped body decreases under otherwise identical test conditions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
