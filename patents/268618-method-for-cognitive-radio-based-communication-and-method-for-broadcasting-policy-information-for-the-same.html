				<td>Method for Cognitive Radio Based Communication and<br>
Method for Broadcasting Policy Information for the Same<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a wireless<br>
communication system, and more particularly, to a method of<br>
broadcasting frequency policy information in a cognitive<br>
radio based communication system, an apparatus therefore,<br>
and a communication system using the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently, it is expected that the demands for<br>
frequencies will rise to keep up with the ubiquitous age.<br>
So, the frequencies are regarded as resources having vast<br>
economic values and many efforts in a national strategic<br>
dimension are being made to the frequency managements by<br>
the governments of U.S.A., Great Britain, Japan, and the<br>
like. In particular, developments for spectrum managing<br>
tools, establishment of extended-term spectrum using plans,<br>
promotions in market-directional frequency collection and<br>
reassignment policy, unlicensed band extension, and<br>
introduction of market-voluntary open frequency policy in<br><br><br>
command &amp; control are accelerated. And, many countries make<br>
aggressive efforts to research and develop the technologies<br>
for minimizing interferences with conventional frequencies<br>
and the frequency sharing technologies considering<br>
locality.<br>
As the wireless communication broadcasting industry<br>
has been recently developed, the demands for the<br>
frequencies as bases of the corresponding services have<br>
risen rapidly. And, the frequency values are rapidly<br>
raised.<br>
Since the demand for frequencies was not so high<br>
relatively in the past days, a frequency supply to a new<br>
service was no big deal. As the demands for frequencies<br>
rise explosively nowadays, it is very difficult to supply<br>
frequencies to the right places at the right times.<br>
Moreover, there exist preferred bands having<br>
excellent radio wave characteristics and the demands for<br>
the bands are very high. So, providers often get involved<br>
in troubles for the preferred frequency bands.<br>
Hence, frequencies have very high economic values and<br>
can be regarded rare resources of limited supplies. And,<br>
many efforts are made to research and develop such a new<br>
frequency sharing technology as UWB (ultra wide band), CR<br><br>
(cognitive radio), and the like to technically settle the<br>
frequency shortage.<br>
The present invention is directed to a problem based<br>
on cognitive radio (hereinafter abbreviated CR) as one of<br>
the aforesaid radio transmission schemes to use frequencies<br>
efficiently in the future. And, the related art<br>
communication system and the CR based communication system<br>
are schematically explained as follows.<br>
First of all, data transmission and reception are<br>
normally implemented by currently serviced radio<br>
communication services using fixed bandwidths. In<br>
particular, a mobile communication system obtains maximum<br>
performance through" inter-cell frequency assignment using a<br>
resource allocated to a specific band. A scheme of<br>
transmitting/receiving a signal using a fixed band has a<br>
fixed frame for its implementation. In order to support a<br>
higher quality of service (e.g., increasing throughput,<br>
increasing a number of users to provide a service, etc.) by<br>
fitting a currently used system specifications, a cell<br>
structure is normally segmented into small pieces or a new<br>
infrastructure is established by expanding old system<br>
specifications to keep up with the demand.<br>
In using a frequency resource so far, there are a<br>
service system using a fixed bandwidth and a recent service<br><br>
system using a scalable bandwidth that selectively applies<br>
one of various bandwidth options.<br>
In determining a standard of a service, the service<br>
system using the fixed bandwidth performs a service by<br>
forming a standardized frame in a manner of applying<br>
various proper transmitting/receiving schemes to the<br>
corresponding band. And, a burden of modifying a whole<br>
service system in accordance with every variation of the<br>
standard is imposed on the service system using the fixed<br>
bandwidth.<br>
On the contrary, the standard utilizing the scalable<br>
bandwidth is designed to facilitate controls of a variation<br>
of a bandwidth and a quality of service rather than the<br>
case of the fixed bandwidth. Yet, the scalable bandwidth<br>
service operates in a same manner of the fixed bandwidth<br>
service in an actual service operation situation. Namely,<br>
the scheme for changing a quality of service without<br>
increasing complexity of hardware uses the same scheme<br>
instead of changing the technique of broadening or<br>
narrowing a bandwidth to obtain a result from using the<br>
scalable bandwidth.<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, as the<br>
demand for radio communication services rapidly increases<br>
and various techniques appear, a demand for frequencies<br><br><br>
exceeds a supply. So, there is a problem that there barely<br>
exists a band margin available for several GHz bands, in<br>
particular, a low frequency band having good frequency<br>
characteristics. To solve this problem, CR scheme appears.<br>
The CR scheme is proposed by Mitola in 1999 for the purpose<br>
of using a frequency band more efficiently. By the CR<br>
scheme, a vacant frequency, which is not actually in use,<br>
is detected and then shared and used efficiently.<br>
In particular, CR is basically implemented based on<br>
software defined radio (SDR) . The CR is able to judge and<br>
decide whether to set an unused spectrum to a basic<br>
communication band by searching spectrum, whether to change<br>
a service type by modifying SDR architecture in accordance<br>
with a searched service type, or whether to change a<br>
quality of service. Considering the basic concepts and the<br>
currently active various radio services, it is decided that<br>
personally carried wireless terminals converge into one<br>
type and it is also expected that a CR terminal will be<br>
suitable for the corresponding convergence.<br>
Thus, communication systems according to the<br>
currently discussed frequency managing schemes can be<br>
categorized into 1) Fixed Bandwidth Communication System,<br>
2) Scalable Bandwidth Communication System, and 3) CR Based<br>
Communication System. Ad, their operational systems are<br><br><br>
schematically explained with reference to the drawings as<br>
follows.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram to explain a fixed bandwidth<br>
service system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a fixed bandwidth service system<br>
provides a service using a bandwidth set in an initial<br>
standardizing step like a current mobile communication<br>
system (CDMA or GSM), a wireless LAN (802.11 or HiperLAN),<br>
or a wireless PAN (802.15).<br>
A frequency use approval for the service bandwidth is<br>
granted by a government or a predetermined quantity of the<br>
service bandwidth is used for a frequency band known in<br>
public.<br>
This service, as shown in FIG. 1, is characterized in<br>
that there is no increase or decrease of a frequency<br>
bandwidth in accordance with time at all and in that a<br>
service within a preset bandwidth is optimized within the<br>
bandwidth. Hence, FIG. 1 shows that a preset bandwidth<br>
keeps being used regardless of a quantity of current<br>
traffics .<br>
FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 are diagrams to explain a scalable<br>
bandwidth service system.<br>
Scalable bandwidth service systems can be categorized<br><br>
in two types shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, respectively. The<br>
two types include a type that a bandwidth used by a<br>
terminal is scalable in a state that a service band of a<br>
base station is fixed and a type that a bandwidth used by a<br>
base station is scalable as well.<br>
First of all, an example that a bandwidth used by a<br>
base station is fixed and that a bandwidth serviced for a<br>
terminal in the bandwidth of the base station is scalable<br>
is shown in FIG. 2. The example of the service includes<br>
such a service using OFDM as 902.16, 802.20, and 3GPP LTE<br>
or such a CDMA service of assigning a bundle of channels to<br>
a terminal as EV-DO and EV-EV. In theses services, a<br>
corresponding service is accessed in a manner that a total<br>
bandwidth used by a base station is set and that a specific<br>
bandwidth is assigned to a bandwidth used by a terminal by<br>
a corresponding base station. IN this case, a bandwidth to<br>
be used by a base station is set in advance in case of<br>
system installation.<br>
On the contrary, a case that a bandwidth serviced by<br>
a base station varies in accordance with time, as shown in<br>
FIG. 3, is possible. This case corresponds to a service<br>
model generated when CR is accommodated by 802.22. In<br>
particular, an available spectrum per time is detected and<br><br>
a base station extends its service within an available<br>
bandwidth. In this case, requirements for a terminal<br>
include that the corresponding bandwidth should be entirely<br>
accommodated. FIG. 3 exemplarily shows variations of a<br>
frequency bandwidth used by a base station and a terminal<br>
in accordance with time.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram to explain a CR based service<br>
system.<br>
Basically, CR does not specify a specific scheme.<br>
And, CR means that a configuration of a terminal varies in<br>
accordance with a spectrum resource to use a current<br>
spectrum resource more efficiently.<br>
FIG. 4 shows how a CR terminal makes an access if<br>
there is an unused portion in a spectrum. When there is a<br>
spectrum band to be observed, if an unused area is found<br>
from the corresponding band, a communication service to be<br>
implemented with CR within the area is provided. The<br>
communication service can include a fixed band service or a<br>
scalable band service. And, the communication service<br>
differs from a conventional service in that, since a<br>
spectrum varies in accordance with time, a protocol for<br>
managing the spectrum variation and a learning process are<br>
needed. Moreover, a current standard for implementing CR is<br>
802.22 WRAN system.<br><br>
Based on the above explanation, the CR can be defined<br>
as a technique for transmitting/receiving a radio signal<br>
without interference with another device in a manner of<br>
cognizing a surrounding radio environment and deciding a<br>
communication parameter optimal for a radio environment by<br>
itself.<br>
In most countries, personal short-range radio devices<br>
use unlicensed frequency bands in general. Yet, a frequency<br>
band available without license is limited and the rest of<br>
frequency bands are almost assigned to other usages. So, it<br>
is difficult to secure a frequency band for a new service.<br>
Yet, in the present status of actual frequency use, a<br>
situation is a little different. Many frequency bands over<br>
2GHz are not actually in use and there exist frequency<br>
bands not used temporally or spatially in major frequency<br>
bands below 1GHz for TV or mobile communications.<br>
FCC (federal communications commission) performs a<br>
study for a real frequency use rate to survey an average<br>
frequency use rate varying temporarily or locally. And, the<br>
survey says that there is about 15-85&amp; of a use rate. FCC<br>
announces NPRM (notice of proposed rulemaking) to raise<br>
frequency use efficiency in December, 2003 to notice<br>
redundant use availability for vacant frequencies. Upon<br>
this opportunity, the frequency shortage problem can be<br><br>
considerably mitigated.<br>
Since the frequency sharing use availability by CR<br>
technique was announced by FCC NPRM in December, 2003, many<br>
efforts have been made to develop a real system by a first<br>
meeting for IEEE802.22 in November, 2004. This organization<br>
discusses standardization for CR applied WRAN on a TV band<br>
shown in FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a diagram to explain a CR sharing<br>
concept for TV frequency band.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, IEEE 802.22 provides WRAN<br>
service by sharing a TV band. And, a service unit is<br>
determined as an integral multiple of an available TV<br>
channel (6MHz TV channel in FIG. 5).<br>
In particular, if there is an unused TV channel,<br>
which is indicated as 'unused TV channel' in FIG. 5,<br>
cognized by a base station, this channel is used for WRAN<br>
service. And, if TV channels are consecutively available<br>
within a range proposed by a standardization, these<br>
channels are combined together to use as a single band.<br>
And, a service using the whole is provided. FIG. 5 shows a<br>
case that multi-carriers are transmitted to correspond to<br>
an unused TV channel environment for example.<br>
And, a terminal cognizes the whole channel status of<br><br>
the base station and should extend its reception capability<br>
as well.<br>
Meanwhile, a conventional frequency policy differs<br>
per a country or a region in frequency band and. frequency<br>
assignment specifications for a mobile communication, a<br>
wireless LAN and the like. So, in order for a CR terminal<br>
to operate correctly, information on a local frequency<br>
policy should be retained. Based on this information, when<br>
the CR terminal accesses a frequency band in the future, a<br>
communication service selection and an operation of a<br>
communication system is governed.<br>
However, a method for obtaining information on a<br>
frequency policy in a random area is not defined in the<br>
conventional frequency policy and the conventional<br>
communication method. So, when a power of a CR based<br>
terminal is turned on in a random area or a CR based<br>
terminal moves away into a random area, the CR based<br>
terminal fails to cognize a frequency policy corresponding<br>
to the area but is unable to be converted to a<br>
communication system suitable for a frequency of the<br>
corresponding area.<br>
Moreover, if an open frequency policy depending on a<br>
self-regulating market is adopted to proceed instead of<br>
adopting a conventional command &amp; control type frequency<br><br><br>
policy uniformly, the absence of the per area frequency<br>
policy information obtaining scheme may cause a<br>
considerable problem.<br>

MODE FOR INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
The following detailed description disclosed together<br>
with the accompanying drawings intends to present not a<br>
unique embodiment of the present invention but an exemplary<br>
embodiment. The following details include particular<br>
details to provide complete understanding of the present<br>
invention. Yet, it is apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
that the present invention can be implemented without the<br>
particular details. For instance, a structure of "policy<br>
broadcasting packet' which will be explained later in the<br>
following description, includes not only a structure to<br>
achieve the objects of the present invention but also<br>
detailed configurations for those skilled in the art to<br>
facilitate the implementations. And, other detailed<br>
configurations can be replaced by different configurations<br>
as long as a structure for obtaining an effect intended by<br>
the present invention is included.<br>
In the following description, a target for a base<br>
station to communicate with can be represented as a<br><br><br>
terminology including one of 'terminal', 'user equipment',<br>
'CPE' and the like. Yet, theses terminologies do not put<br>
limitation of the present invention. So, an arbitrary-<br>
subject can correspond to the target without being limited<br>
to these terminologies as long as it can perform CR<br>
communication of the present invention with a base station.<br>
In some cases, a structure or device known to public<br>
is omitted to avoid conceptional vagueness of the present<br>
invention or depicted as a block diagram centering on core<br>
functions of the structure or the device. And, the same<br>
reference numbers are designated to the same elements in<br>
this disclosure overall.<br>
The present invention provides a frequency policy<br>
broadcasting mechanism to support CR terminals based on<br>
cognitive radio (CR) that is one of radio transmission<br>
schemes to use frequencies efficiently in the future and<br>
also provides a corresponding CR communication method of a<br>
terminal.<br>
In the following description, explained are how to<br>
provide a CR structure and a frequency policy broadcasting<br>
mechanism based on the CR structure and what kind of a<br>
system is efficient for a corresponding communication<br>
system.<br>
FIG. 6 is a diagram of an overall structure for<br><br><br>
enabling a CR based terminal/base station to operate.<br>
Blocks are explained as follows. A structure for a CR<br>
terminal/base station to process a communication signal<br>
includes a communication system 601 performing actual<br>
communication, a policy engine 602 performing management<br>
for a frequency policy, and a cognitive engine 603 making<br>
an appropriate countermeasure by tracking down a. momentary<br>
spectrum variation.<br>
Meanwhile, the CR terminal/base station is able to<br>
set up an available frequency and an observation frequency<br>
band by a frequency policy in accordance with each country<br>
or region and to obtain information on what kind of a<br>
service is available from a policy domain 604. Based on<br>
this information, in accessing a channel in the future, the<br>
CR terminal/base station administers a communication<br>
service selection and an operation of a communication<br>
system.<br>
The cognitive engine 603 decides which service will<br>
be performed on a prescribed frequency in accordance with a<br>
present use status of a spectrum and information provided<br>
by the policy engine 602 and then performs an optimization<br>
on a communication system and a control on a communication<br>
protocol. In this case, the communication system should be<br><br>
equipped with communication specifications capable of<br>
accommodating an external environment and a variation of an<br>
RF channel 605, i.e., a variation of spectrum.<br>
In order a CR based terminal to operate, the CR<br>
terminal, as shown in FIG. 6, has to receive a frequency<br>
policy in accordance with a corresponding country or region<br>
from the policy domain 604, is able to set up an available<br>
frequency and an observation frequency band in accordance<br>
with the received frequency policy, and should obtain<br>
information which indicates what kind of service is<br>
available.<br>
Yet, a current CR communication method fails to<br>
provide a mechanism for a terminal to obtain the per region<br>
policy information, which fails to facilitate the terminal<br>
to cope with a case that there is a change of policy<br>
information, a case that there is a change of a parameter<br>
for sensing a variation of an external environment or the<br>
RF channel 605 or the like, a case that a location of the<br>
terminal is changed, a case that a power of the terminal is<br>
initially turned on, and the like.<br>
Meanwhile, a current radio wave use system is coming<br>
into effect in aspects of device certification such as<br>
radio station license/inspection, radio device formality<br><br>
official approval/registration, and information device<br>
electromagnetic wave suitability registration and efficient<br>
management of radio wave resources for illegal facility<br>
control and the like. Thus, the domestic radio wave use<br>
system mostly relates to command &amp; control (over 90%). Now,<br>
it is the time to make a flexible turn toward a market to<br>
accelerate a new radio wave use market creation and to plan<br>
peripheral industry developments ahead. If the radio wave<br>
use system makes a transition to the market-directional<br>
system, the demand for a means for enabling a terminal to<br>
obtain information on a per region frequency policy will<br>
rise considerably.<br>
Hence, a frequency policy information broadcasting<br>
mechanism according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention is proposed as follows.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram to explain frequency policy<br>
information broadcasting mechanism according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, a method for broadcasting a<br>
frequency policy corresponding to each region, or each<br>
country and information for operating CR terminals 705a,<br>
705b, and 705c through a prescribed system is proposed. The<br>
prescribed system enables a TV broadcasting station, a<br><br>
satellite, or a prescribed base station to provide a<br>
service. If the prescribed system is capable of<br>
broadcasting the per region frequency policy information,<br>
it is unnecessary to be limited to a specific system. In<br>
the following description, this is named 'policy<br>
broadcaster 701' or 'policy broadcasting device'.<br>
Information broadcasted by the policy broadcaster 701<br>
is to control settings of the terminals 705a, 705b and<br>
705c, a provided communication service, a frequency<br>
regulation, and the like and includes information on<br>
frequency assignment specifications per region or country,<br>
information on an available service on a corresponding<br>
frequency band, and the like.<br>
In this case, the 'available service' means a<br>
communication scheme serviced on an available frequency<br>
band in a specific region, e.g., a WLAN communication<br>
service 702, a 3G communication service 703, and other<br>
access network service 704 and can exist in a plurality of<br>
communication systems each of which provides a single<br>
service (e.g., a case that the WLAN communication service<br>
702 is provided by a system 1 and a system 2 respectively<br>
provided by two service providers).<br>
When the information on the available service is<br><br>
broadcasted, information indicating how to perform sensing<br>
by measuring a prescribed feature can be included.<br>
Transmission format of the broadcasted information<br>
and contents included in the information will be explained<br>
in detail in the following description. For clarity and<br>
facilitation of explanation, this is generically named 'per<br>
region frequency policy information'.<br>
Each of the CR based terminals 705a, 705b and 705c<br>
obtains the per region frequency policy information,<br>
compares the obtained information to its location,<br>
undergoes a cognitive process through a specification of a<br>
region corresponding to its location, and then established<br>
a communication environment. For this, each of the CR based<br>
terminals 705a, 705b and 705c should have a method of<br>
recognizing its accurate location. Self-location<br>
recognition via GPS or Galileo satellite is advantageously<br>
implemented without an additional cost owing to the CR<br>
terminal characteristics.<br>
The above-described per region frequency policy<br>
information broadcasted by the policy information<br>
broadcaster is explained as follows.<br>
FIG. 8 is a diagram of a structure of a policy<br>
broadcasting packet including per region policy information<br><br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention proposes a<br>
scheme of broadcasting the per region frequency policy<br>
information associated with FIG. 7 in a packet format<br>
including other necessary information. And, this is called<br>
^policy broadcasting packet'.<br>
First of all, a policy broadcasting packet according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention can include a<br>
preamble 801 enabling a terminal to being synchronized with<br>
the policy broadcasting packet, a frequency policy profile<br>
header (PPH) 802 carrying information on transferred per<br>
region frequency policy information, and a frequency policy<br>
information (policy profile) MAC protocol data unit (PP MAC<br>
PDU) 803 for delivering frequency policy information<br>
(policy profile).<br>
In the above structure, the preamble 801 includes<br>
specific sequence data (e.g., sequence A). And, a random<br>
sequence usable for enabling a CR based terminal to match<br>
synchronization with the policy information broadcaster can<br>
be used as the preamble 801.<br>
The PPH 802 can include last update information 802a<br>
as information of count or time to enable the terminal to<br>
confirm that received information is latest information.<br><br><br>
This can be configured in a manner of incrementing the<br>
count or changing a time value if contents of the PDU are<br>
changed in the policy information broadcaster. For<br>
instance, if a packet of a policy information broadcaster<br>
is changed, a count is incremented by one. The packet is<br>
then broadcasted. In case of the count, if the count is<br>
equal to that of the terminal having received the<br>
broadcasted packet, policy associated information, i.e., PP<br>
MAC PDU is not updated. If the count is different from a<br>
former count previously received from the policy<br>
information broadcaster, the information is updated.<br>
Likewise, in case of the time, a time of transmitting a<br>
packet from a policy information broadcaster is compared to<br>
a previous time of receiving a packet, information can be<br>
updated into latest information.<br>
The PPH 802 can include information 802b on a region<br>
to which a corresponding frequency packet is applied, e.g.,<br>
location information in an information format about a range<br>
of longitude and latitude, coordinates including a<br>
longitude and latitude, and an applied information.<br>
Preferably, information 802c on a PDU length is included as<br>
well.<br>
Meanwhile, the PP MAC PDU 803 can include at least<br><br>
one of a frequency allocation situation 803a in each<br>
region, a type 803b of service in an allocated frequency<br>
band, and parameter information 803c to sense an available<br>
frequency band in accordance with the corresponding<br>
service.<br>
In particular, the frequency allocation situation<br>
includes information on a frequency band available for each<br>
region and can indicate that a frequency band available for<br>
a specific region includes a frequency band 1, a frequency<br>
band 2, and a frequency band 3. And, information on a type<br>
of a service on the allocated frequency band can indicate<br>
that a wireless LAN (WLAN) is serviced on the frequency<br>
band 1, that a wireless PAN (WPAN) is serviced on the<br>
frequency band 2, and that cellular communication is<br>
serviced on the frequency band 3.<br>
The parameter information 803c for sensing an actual<br>
available frequency band according to each service is the<br>
information indicating whether a corresponding system can<br>
be easily found if prescribed information is calculated or<br>
detected in searching a system. For instance, the parameter<br>
information 803c can include information on a type of a<br>
sequence used in case of CDMA, information on a bandwidth<br>
and a preamble in case of OFDM, information on shift keying<br>
such as FM, AM and the like, information on cyclostationary<br><br><br>
characteristic and the like. Through this, the CR terminal<br>
is able to detect an actual available frequency band by<br>
sensing whether a corresponding frequency band in a<br>
corresponding service is used by a primary user, etc. In<br>
this case, the 'primary user' means a user who uses a<br>
service by a communication scheme (e.g., WLAN, WMAN, etc:<br>
hereinafter called 'primary service') serviced in a<br>
previous corresponding frequency band instead of the CR<br>
communication.<br>
Moreover, the PP MAC PDU 803 can include information<br>
on a frequency regulation situation including a power<br>
profile of each service and the like. For instance,<br>
specifications for power limit available for each region or<br>
service in radio communication can differ from each other.<br>
Hence, the present embodiment proposes that the information<br>
on the power regulations is set to be broadcasted to each<br>
user via the PP MAC PDU 803 and the like.<br>
In case that there exist a plurality of providers<br>
each of which provides a specific service a terminal<br>
attempts to receive, the PP MAC PDU 803 preferably includes<br>
provider information for discriminating a system of a<br>
corresponding provider.<br>
Besides, the PP MAC PDU 803 can include at least one<br><br>
information for sensing or changing a terminal setting such<br>
as a per region frequency allocation situation, a type of a<br>
service on an allocated frequency band, a spectrum mask for<br>
an available frequency band/inner and outer band in<br>
accordance with each service, a transmission power limit on<br>
each frequency band, and the like.<br>
By broadcasting the frequency policy information, the<br>
CR terminal is able to efficiently sense an actual<br>
available frequency band by obtaining information on a<br>
frequency policy of a region corresponding to its location<br>
with ease.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the above-explained frequency policy information<br>
can be transmitted via broadcast information within a<br>
service for the purpose of a specific service.<br>
And, a method of defining a profile for frequency<br>
policy information set for each region in transmitting the<br>
frequency policy information and transmitting the<br>
corresponding configuration in a bit arrangement is<br>
possible as well.<br>
A configuration of the policy information broadcaster<br>
who broadcasts the frequency policy information is<br>
explained as follows.<br><br>
FIG. 9 is a block diagram of configurational features<br>
of a frequency policy information broadcaster according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A frequency policy information broadcaster 901<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention, as<br>
shown in FIG. 9, can include a packet generating unit 902<br>
and a broadcasting unit 903 in accordance with its<br>
functions.<br>
The packet generating unit 902 receives information<br>
on a frequency policy and then generates a policy<br>
broadcasting packet shown in FIG. 8. If the received<br>
information on the frequency policy is changed, the packet<br>
generating unit 902 is able to increment a count or to<br>
insert information on a changed timing point in the policy<br>
broadcasting packet. For this, the packet generating unit<br>
902 can include a count/time recording unit 902a.<br>
Preferably, the policy information inputted to the packet<br>
generating unit is updated in a cycle enough to accommodate<br>
a changed item of the corresponding frequency policy.<br>
The broadcasting unit 903 having received the policy<br>
broadcasting packet generated by the packet generating unit<br>
902 can broadcast the corresponding policy broadcasting<br>
packet in a predetermined cycle.<br><br>
The policy information broadcaster 901 according to<br>
the present invention can become a random subject as long<br>
as has the above-explained configuration. A TV broadcasting<br>
station, a satellite or a random base station used for a<br>
communication system can play a role as the policy<br>
information broadcaster 901 by including the above-<br>
explained configuration. Alternatively, as mentioned in the<br>
foregoing description, a separate subject can be<br>
implemented to play a role as the policy information<br>
broadcaster 901.<br>
Meanwhile, a process for a terminal to receive the<br>
aforesaid per region frequency policy information broadcast<br>
and to perform CR communication is explained as follows.<br>
FIG. 10 is a diagram to explain a process for<br>
broadcasting frequency policy information according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention and a corresponding<br>
cognizing process of a CR based terminal.<br>
In particular, FIG. 10 depicts a process that a CR<br>
based terminal 1006 matches a synchronization with a policy<br>
broadcaster 100 and reads a message from a moment that a<br>
power of the CR terminal 1006 is turned on and also depicts<br>
a scenario of a case that the CR terminal 1006 attempts to<br>
access a service, e.g., a communication service of a WLAN<br><br><br>
1004 or a WMAN 1003.<br>
If the power of the CR based terminal 1006 is turned<br>
on, the CR based terminal 1006 matches synchronization with<br>
a policy broadcaster 1001 and then receives information<br>
associated with a frequency policy from a packet<br>
broadcasted by the policy broadcaster 1001. In this case,<br>
the terminal 1006 compares information lately received from<br>
the policy broadcaster 1001 to previously received<br>
information from the policy broadcaster 1001. If the<br>
information is changed, the terminal 1006 updates the<br>
previously received information. A presence or non-presence<br>
of the change of the information can be decided through the<br>
count or time of the last update information 802a included<br>
in the PPH 802 shown in FIG. 8.<br>
Through the above-explained packet reception, the<br>
terminal 1006 receives a sensing method for an available<br>
system for each region, a corresponding frequency band, a<br>
frequency profile, whether a specific system actually<br>
exits, what kind of a feature parameter will be used to<br>
measure whether the specific system is currently used if<br>
the specific system actually exists, or the like from the<br>
policy broadcaster 1001. The terminal 1006 then obtains<br>
policy information corresponding to its current location<br><br>
from them.<br>
For instance, if the terminal is located within an<br>
area of a CR BS #1 1007a, information included in a policy<br>
broadcasting packet as a service available for a bandwidth<br>
allocated to the corresponding location enables services of<br>
WMAN 1003, WLAN 1004 and WRAN 1002 and can include<br>
corresponding frequency band information per system,<br>
frequency profile, parameter information for a sensing per<br>
system, and the like.<br>
In this case, FIG. 10 represents CR BS #1 1007a and<br>
CR BA #2 1007b as subjects separate from other service<br>
providing base stations WRAN BS, WMAN BS, WLAN BS, etc.<br>
Yet, CR BS can be assumed as a subject including WRAN BS,<br>
WMAN BS, WLAN BS and the like as base stations capable of<br>
providing services of WRAN, WMAN, WLAN, and the like. So,<br>
if services available for the area of the CR BS #1 1007a<br>
include the WRAN 1002, the WMAN 1003, and the WLAN 1004,<br>
the CR BS #1 1007a be regarded as including the WRAN BS,<br>
the WMAN BS, the WLAN BS, and the like. Of course, it is<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art that they can be<br>
respectively implemented as separate subjects if necessary.<br>
Having received the packet, the terminal 1006 selects<br>
a specific service, e.g., the WMAN 1003 or the WLAN 1004.<br>
The terminal 1006 is then able to sense a frequency band<br><br><br>
corresponding to each of the systems to check whether a<br>
corresponding system actually exists or whether a specific<br>
frequency band is used by a primary user prior to searching<br>
the CR base station 1007a.<br>
If the frequency band of the corresponding system is<br>
used by the primary user, the terminal 1006 reports to the<br>
CR base station 1007a that the primary user exists via a<br>
beacon or the like. If the primary user does not exist and<br>
if the frequency band is an available frequency band, the<br>
terminal obtains synchronization with the corresponding<br>
base station, e.g., the CR BS #1 1007a and then initiates a<br>
service.<br>
Meanwhile, while the service with the CR base station<br>
1007a continues, the CR terminal 1006 is able to receive<br>
policy information. If the policy information previously<br>
received from the policy broadcaster 1001 is different from<br>
policy information newly received from the policy<br>
broadcaster 1001, the terminal 1006 is able to newly update<br>
the previous information.<br>
In the above-explained one embodiment of the present<br>
invention with reference to FIG. 10, the case that the<br>
policy broadcaster 1001 transmits the policy broadcasting<br>
packet including the per region frequency policy<br>
information in a broadcasting format has been described for<br><br><br>
example. In an available frequency band cognizing method<br>
and a CR communication method according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the per region<br>
frequency policy information can be transmitted by an<br>
arbitrary scheme as long as the terminal 1006 can obtain<br>
the per region frequency policy information. For instance,<br>
a transmission of the per region frequency policy<br>
information can be carried out by on-demand of the policy<br>
broadcaster 1001 for example. Yet, in aspects of<br>
introductions of a plurality of terminals for CR<br>
communication, uplink resource waste in accordance with the<br>
request for the per region frequency policy information,<br>
and the like, the transmission in the above-explained<br>
broadcast form can be more preferable.<br>
In the above-explained embodiment, the terminal 1006<br>
executes a separate position obtaining step to obtain its<br>
location information. Yet, a location of terminal can be<br>
obtained from another random process for performing<br>
communication of the terminal. And, it is not mandatory for<br>
the available frequency band cognition and the CR<br>
communication according to the present invention.<br>
The above-explained CR communication process is<br>
explained in detail as follows.<br><br>
FIG. 11 is a diagram to explain an operation of a<br>
terminal and a signal exchanging scheme with each base<br>
station in a CR communication method according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Before a power of a CR based terminal is turned on or<br>
the CR based terminal hands over into another base station,<br>
the terminal receives a policy broadcasting packet from a<br>
random system having a function of a policy broadcaster<br>
(step 1) .<br>
In this case, the policy broadcasting packet can<br>
include a preamble for the terminal to match<br>
synchronization with the policy broadcaster, information<br>
for confirming whether information received by the terminal<br>
is latest information, and per region frequency policy<br>
information (per region available service and corresponding<br>
frequency band, frequency allocation status, feature<br>
relevant information for sensing each system, etc.). The CR<br>
based terminal knows its location information via GPS,<br>
Galileo or the like and is able to execute a. separate<br>
location information checking step if necessary.<br>
Hence, the CR based terminal obtains the<br>
synchronization with the policy broadcaster, obtains a<br>
count or time and the policy relevant information included<br><br>
in the received packet, and then selects to cognize a<br>
frequency policy corresponding to a region where it is<br>
currently located.<br>
Subsequently, the CR based terminal selects a<br>
specific service (e.g., WMAN, MLAN, and more particular, a<br>
system providing the service to be received such as a WMAN<br>
system A by a service provider A, a WLAN system B by a<br>
service provider B) to be serviced from services available<br>
on the corresponding frequency band (step 2).<br>
Prior to obtaining the synchronization with a CR base<br>
station, if the CR based terminal attempts to perform a<br>
sensing for checking whether a corresponding system exists<br>
or whether a primary user exists, the CR based terminal<br>
senses the service or system selected in the step 2 based<br>
on the information obtained in the step 1 (step 3).<br>
If the corresponding frequency band is occupied by<br>
the primary user, the CR based terminal is able to report<br>
it to the CR base station (i.e., CR base station including<br>
BS providing service #3 (WRAN), BS providing service #2<br>
(WLAN), and BS providing service #3 (WRAN)) (step 4). In<br>
this case, the terminal is able to make the report using a<br>
beacon or the like because the synchronization with the CR<br>
base station has not been acquired yet. The CR base station<br>
having received the report, and more particularly, a<br><br><br>
frequency manager of the CR base station can use it in<br>
updating candidate frequency list information for frequency<br>
allocation in each service base station. Meanwhile, if the<br>
primary user is unable to use both of the service and<br>
system selected by the terminal, the terminal is able to<br>
select another service included in the per region frequency<br>
policy information.<br>
Subsequently, if not the primary user but the<br>
available frequency band exists in the frequency band of<br>
the service (WMAN, WLAN) or system selected by the CR based<br>
terminal, the terminal executes a network entry and<br>
initialization process (step 5) for matching<br>
synchronization with a CR base station #1 and a series of<br>
data communication process (step 6) for exchanging data<br>
between a CR base station and a CR based terminal.<br>
The CR based terminal is able to keep obtaining<br>
frequency policy information through the policy broadcaster<br>
(step 7). If the per region frequency policy information is<br>
changed, the information previously received by the CR<br>
based terminal is updated.<br>
Unlike the above explanation, according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, if a CR terminal<br>
selects a specific primary service instead of selecting a<br><br>
CR service, the terminal decides a presence or non-presence<br>
of a corresponding service only through a sensing process.<br>
If the corresponding service exists, the terminal is able<br>
to access a base station or AP providing the corresponding<br>
service. If the corresponding service does not exist<br>
actually, the terminal is able to select a new service.<br>
Moreover, if a location of a terminal is changed or a<br>
power of the terminal is turned on, as mentioned in the<br>
foregoing description, the terminal itself is configured in<br>
accordance with a series of orders and then recognizes a<br>
service and an available bandwidth. Yet, if a terminal has<br>
to update regulation information in the course of action,<br>
the available bandwidth can be secured in a manner of re-<br>
executing the steps from the sensing process of the step 3<br>
in FIG. 11.<br>
A feature configuration of a terminal for executing<br>
CR communication by cognizing an available frequency band,<br>
as mentioned in the foregoing description, is explained as<br>
follows.<br>
FIG. 12 is a block diagram of configurational<br>
features of a terminal for cognizing an available frequency<br>
band and performing CR communication using the same.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, a terminal 1201 according to<br><br>
one embodiment of the present invention can include a<br>
packet receiving unit 1202, a location information<br>
obtaining unit 1203, a sensing unit 1204, and a<br>
transmitting unit 1205.<br>
First of all, the packet receiving unit 1202 receives<br>
a policy broadcasting packet broadcasted by a policy<br>
broadcaster. The received policy broadcasting packet<br>
includes a preamble for the terminal 120 to match<br>
synchronization with the policy broadcaster. If the<br>
terminal 1201 acquires synchronization with the policy<br>
broadcaster through the preamble, the packet receiving unit<br>
1202 obtains a per region frequency allocation status, a<br>
type of an available service for each frequency band, a<br>
presence or non-presence of availability of each service,<br>
and sensing parameter information for sensing an available<br>
frequency band and the like from the received packet and<br>
then delivers the obtained information to the sensing unit<br>
1204.<br>
Meanwhile, the terminal according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention can include the location<br>
information obtaining unit 1203 obtaining its location<br>
information to extract corresponding frequency policy<br>
information from the above-explained per region frequency<br>
policy information. And, the location information obtaining<br><br>
unit 1203 is able to obtain its location information via<br>
GPS, Galileo satellite or the like.<br>
Having received the frequency policy information from<br>
the packet receiving unit 1202 and its location information<br>
from the location information obtaining unit 1203, the<br>
sensing unit 1204 is able to obtain information on an<br>
available frequency band by sensing whether a selected<br>
service actually exists and whether an actually available<br>
frequency band exists for the corresponding service if the<br>
selected service exists, through the received informations.<br>
Thus, in case that the sensing unit 1204 secures the<br>
service for the CR communication and the available<br>
frequency band, the transmitting unit 1205 is able to<br>
initiate the CR communication through the secured service<br>
and available frequency band.<br>
FIG. 12 shows that the packet receiving unit 1202<br>
delivers the whole received per region frequency policy<br>
information to the sensing unit 1204 and that the sensing<br>
unit 1204 having received the location information obtained<br>
by the location information obtaining unit 1203 extracts<br>
the corresponding policy information from the whole per<br>
region frequency policy information and then uses the<br>
extracted information for the sensing. Alternatively, if<br>
necessary, the packet receiving unit 1202 receives the<br><br><br>
location information obtained by the location information<br>
obtaining unit 1203 and then provides the frequency policy<br>
information of the region, where it is located, in the<br>
whole per region policy information to the sensing unit<br>
only. As long as the above-explained functions are carried<br>
out to enable the terminal 1201 shown in FIG. 12 to execute<br>
the CR communication scheme, it is apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art that the feature configuration can be<br>
differently implemented in accordance with the<br>
discrimination of each of the functions.<br>
For instance, a terminal according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention includes a packet<br>
receiving unit receiving a policy broadcasting packet<br>
including the frequency policy information per region from<br>
the policy broadcaster performing a broadcast of the<br>
frequency policy information for the cognitive radio<br>
communication.<br>
And, the terminal according to another embodiment of<br>
the present invention can further include a processor<br>
cognizing the frequency policy information delivered to the<br>
terminal and changing a setting of the terminal in<br>
accordance with the policy information.<br>
Moreover, the terminal according to another<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention can further include a<br>
processor cognizing a plurality of frequency policy<br>
informations delivered to the terminal, a location<br>
information obtaining unit obtaining a current location of<br>
the terminal, a selecting unit selecting a frequency policy<br>
in accordance with the location, and a setting unit<br>
changing a setting of the terminal in accordance with the<br>
selected frequency policy information.<br>
Besides, the terminal according to another embodiment<br>
of the present invention can further include a sensing unit<br>
sensing an available frequency band in accordance with the<br>
frequency policy corresponding to the location obtained by<br>
the location information obtaining unit in the per region<br>
frequency policy information and a transmitting unit<br>
initiating communication via the available frequency band<br>
if the sensing unit senses the available frequency band.<br>
The descriptions of the respective embodiments of the<br>
present invention provide a subject for broadcasting a<br>
policy broadcasting packet to enable a terminal to obtain<br>
information on a frequency policy of a corresponding region<br>
among random regions and disclose a frequency policy<br>
information broadcasting method and apparatus thereof.<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, another<br>
object of the present invention is to disclose a problems<br><br>
of a related art superframe structure in executing the CR<br>
communication and to provide an enhanced superframe<br>
structure and a communication method using the same to<br>
solve the problem.<br>
For this, a superframe structure and a frame<br>
structure used for IEEE 802.22 system are explained as<br>
follows.<br>
An example of a superframe structure and a frame<br>
structure used in IEEE 802.22 system will be explained.<br>
According to one embodiment, a superframe includes a<br>
PHY preamble, a superframe control header (SCH) , and a<br>
plurality of frames.<br>
The preamble is a specific sequence data placed at a<br>
first symbol of each superframe, exists per TV channel, and<br>
is used for a CPE to match synchronization with a base<br>
station (BS).<br>
The SCH includes information about the superframe.<br>
And, the SCH includes a system type available for a current<br>
band, a superframe number, a number of frames included in<br>
the superframe, a presence or non-presence of channel<br>
combination, information on a quiet period, and the like.<br>
And, the frame is a data sequence channel for a<br>
predetermined period due to a physical characteristic and<br><br><br>
includes a downlink subframe and an uplink subframe. One<br>
superframe includes sixteen frames (10 ms).<br>
According to another embodiment, a frame includes a<br>
preamble, a frame control header (FCH), a burst, and the<br>
like. The frame further includes a DL-MAP located in a<br>
channel area of a same symbol section of the FCH, a UL-MAP<br>
located at a start timing point of a first burst, and a<br>
DCD/UCD as a MAC message announcing a physical<br>
characteristic in downlink/uplink channel.<br>
The preamble, which is a specific sequence data<br>
placed at a first symbol of each frame, is used for a<br>
mobile station (MS) to match synchronization with a BS.<br>
The DL-MAP/UL-MAP is a MAC message notifying channel<br>
resource allocation in downlink/uplink to a terminal.<br>
And, the burst is a unit of data received or<br>
transmitted by a terminal. A size and position of the burst<br>
are informed by the DL-MAP/UL-MAP message.<br>
Meanwhile, in case that a CPE for a single channel<br>
newly enters a network in a system using the above-<br>
configured superframe and frame structures, a related art<br>
method is explained as follows.<br>
An example of a related art announcement process for<br>
providing a service to CPE for a signal channel mode will<br><br><br><br>
be explained.<br>
IEEE 802.22 system enables multi-channel combination<br>
and a base station modifies a superframe structure in<br>
accordance with performance of CPE.<br>
In this example, a broadband mode CPE receives data<br>
from a frame, in which three unit channels (e.g., unit<br>
channels t-1, t and t+1) are combined into one, in an Nth<br>
superframe.<br>
Each terminal is capable of decoding a superframe<br>
preamble and SCH per channel. If a terminal attempting to<br>
enter a network is a CPE in a single mode, the terminal<br>
transmits a fact that the entered CPE is in the single mode<br>
to a base station via an alert window (AW) . The base<br>
station having received the fact separates a channel<br>
combined in an (N+l)th superframe (superframe n+1) into the<br>
respective channels, modifies a frame structure to enable<br>
the single-mode terminal to be serviced, and then transmits<br>
the modified frame.<br>
Thus, the related art communication scheme, i.e., a<br>
scheme, of which standardization is in progress, proposes a<br>
superframe structure that considers both a narrowband mode<br>
CPE and a broadband mode CPE. Yet, in a current superframe<br>
structure, in order for a narrowband mode support terminal<br><br><br>
is serviced by a base station in a superframe having<br>
several channel combined together, it is possible in a<br>
superframe transmitted after the base station has decided<br>
whether the terminal is in a single mode. And, a narrowband<br>
mode terminal is unable to be serviced by the base station<br>
in the middle of a superframe, i.e., a frame section for<br>
receiving data from the base station. If a narrowband mode<br>
terminal attempting to move away into another channel in<br>
the course of being serviced from a prescribed channel, and<br>
more particularly, a mobile terminal attempts to enter a<br>
network, there occurs a problem that a service is<br>
disconnected from a base station before receiving a next<br>
superframe after completion of separating the combined<br>
channels.<br>
Hence, the present invention proposes a superframe<br>
structure to enable a base station to support a seamless<br>
communication service for terminals, which differ from each<br>
other in performance, i.e., in narrowband or broadband<br>
mode, based on CR. In particular, in configuring a<br>
superframe, an area for a narrowband terminal is basically<br>
allocated to a frame structure within a superframe<br>
structure and the rest of the areas within the superframe<br>
are allocated for a broadband mode terminal to be serviced.<br>
In order to notify a position of a resource area for<br><br><br>
a narrowband terminal to a terminal having entered a<br>
network in the middle of a corresponding superframe<br>
section, position information is included in FCH and/or MAP<br>
information part within the superframe. In this case, the<br>
FCH and MAP information parts are sections including<br>
information on a corresponding frame. For clarity and<br>
convenience of explanation, the FCH and MAP information<br>
parts are generically named ^header part' of a unit<br>
resource area in the following description. In this case,<br>
the Aunit resource area' indicates a resource area included<br>
in a block discriminated by a single channel and a single<br>
frame within a superframe.<br>
Meanwhile, the position information can be included<br>
in the FCH and/or MAP information parts of the entire unit<br>
resource areas within the superframe. Alternatively, the<br>
position information can be limitedly inserted in the FCH<br>
and/or MAP information unit of a unit resource area<br>
belonging to a resource area for a narrowband terminal<br>
only. So, the inclusion of the position information can<br>
differ in accordance with each implement.<br>
In embodiments to satisfy the above general<br>
conditions, 1) a method of discriminating whether a<br>
narrowband mode is supported with reference to a channel<br>
region, 2) a method of discriminating with reference to a<br><br>
time region, and 3) a method of discriminating with<br>
reference to channel and time regions are explained with<br>
reference to the drawings as follows.<br>
Another example of a superframe structure enabling at<br>
least one channel region to support a narrowband mode user<br>
equipment (UE) according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention will be explained.<br>
Even if a frequency band allocated to a superframe by<br>
excluding an already used frequency band is a broadband, a<br>
method is configured in a manner that at least one channel<br>
is used by a narrowband mode terminal.<br>
An area serviceable by a narrowband mode terminal is<br>
also serviceable by a broadband mode terminal as well,<br>
which corresponds to an area where both of the narrowband<br>
mode and the broadband mode enable synchronization. Thus, a<br>
frame is constructed in a manner of enabling the rest area<br>
except the area available for both of the narrowband mode<br>
and the broadband mode simultaneously to enable a broadband<br>
service.<br>
In this example, a position of a channel enabling a<br>
service for both a narrowband terminal and a broadband<br>
terminal, as can be indicated by a channel t + 1, can be<br>
obtained through FCH and/or MAP information within a frame.<br><br><br>
More preferably, in case that position information of<br>
the above channel is inserted in the header part of every<br>
unit resource area included in the channel region, even if<br>
a terminal enters a network at a random timing point within<br>
a superframe period, it is able to know which channel<br>
supports a narrowband mode.<br>
A superframe structure described above is not limited<br>
to a specific channel position and size except that at<br>
least one channel for a narrowband mode terminal is<br>
assigned. Yet, in a channel of a frame including a quiet<br>
period for in-band sensing for a terminal or a base station<br>
to search a band unused by previous users, a channel<br>
section for the narrowband mode communication is not<br>
allocated.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
it is unnecessary that a multiple channel mode and a single<br>
channel mode provide the same service at the same time.<br>
Instead, they can set quiet periods at different times,<br>
respectively. Namely, in setting quiet periods, a quiet<br>
period of a multiple channel mode and a quiet period of a<br>
single channel mode need not be given at the same time if<br>
frames of the two modes are discontinuous on a physical<br>
channel.<br>
Meanwhile, it is able to additionally insert position<br><br><br>
information of at least one channel to provide a service to<br>
the narrowband mode terminal in a superframe control header<br>
(SCH).<br>
In this case, if the SCH is used in the same form in<br>
every channel region, it is unnecessary to insert different<br>
information for each channel. So, implementation is<br>
facilitated. And, it is also advantageous that an item<br>
common to channels needs not to be repeatedly indicated.<br>
Yet, *list information' indicating whether a narrowband<br>
mode is supported should be included for every channel. So,<br>
a necessary bit number can be raised.<br>
On the other hand, if SCH is differentiated for each<br>
channel, a number of bits required for indicating whether<br>
each channel supports a narrowband mode can be lowered.<br>
Yet, it may be disadvantageous that an item included in<br>
common to every channel should be repeatedly inserted. And,<br>
its implementation can be complicated more or less.<br><br>
Thus, by inserting the position information of the<br>
narrowband mode support channel in the SCH additionally,<br>
the base station is able to deliver the position of the<br>
channel region supporting the narrowband mode terminal more<br>
stably. And, the narrowband mode terminal can stably obtain<br>
the position of the narrowband mode support channel within<br>
the whole superframe as well.<br>
Details of a method of implementing the above-<br>
configured superframe structure are explained as follows.<br>
First of all, when at least one channel keeps being<br>
used as a narrowband mode in a superframe without changing<br>
a channel supporting the narrowband mode, if SCH includes<br>
information on the channel, the SCH can be configured as<br>
Table 1 or Table 2. Of course, as mentioned in the<br>
foregoing description, in case that information on a<br>
channel supporting a narrowband mode is included in a<br>
header part of a unit resource area of a corresponding<br>
region, a terminal entering a network in the middle of a<br>
superframe can obtain a position of the channel supporting<br>
the narrowband mode. By inserting the corresponding<br>
information in the SCH, information can be delivered more<br>
stably. Table 1 exemplarily shows a case of applying a same<br>
SCH to every channel, while Table 2 exemplarily shows a<br>
case of applying a different SCH to each channel.<br><br><br>
[Table 1]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[Table 2]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In Table 1 and Table 2, Table 1 indicates a case of<br>
using common SCH for every channel region. 'Narrowband<br><br>
Number List' includes information indicating whether a<br>
narrowband mode for every channel is supported. For this, 8<br>
bits are allocated. Yet, Table 2 shows a case that a<br>
different SCH is inserted in each channel. And, Table 2<br>
differs from Table 1 in that 1 bit is allocated to xBand<br>
Type' to indicate whether a narrowband mode of a<br>
corresponding channel itself is supported, without<br>
'Narrowband Number List' of Table 1.<br>
Referring to Table 1 and Table 2, a channel number<br>
for a narrowband mode is specified in SCH. And, in each<br>
frame, it is represented whether a corresponding frame<br>
corresponds to a narrowband type.<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, the<br>
aforesaid position information can be included in each unit<br>
resource area, i.e., in FCH and/or DL-MAP information part<br>
of each frame included in a corresponding channel. Table 3<br>
shows an example of a case that position information is<br>
included in DL-MAP.<br>
[Table 3]<br><br><br><br><br>
Referring to Table 3, in transmitting channel<br>
information for supporting a narrowband mode using DL-MAP,<br>
if 'Band Type' indicates '1', it means that a channel<br>
including it supports a narrowband mode CPE. If 'Band Type'<br>
indicates '0', it means that a channel does not support a<br>
narrowband mode CPE. Through this, a terminal is able to<br>
obtain information indicating which channel supports a<br>
narrowband mode even if entering a network for a super<br>
frame period.<br>
Meanwhile, a method of performing communication<br>
between a terminal and a base station using the above-<br>
configured superframe structure is explained as follows.<br>
In a communication method according to the present<br>
invention, in performing communication using a superframe<br>
enabling at least one channel to support a narrowband mode,<br>
as mentioned in the foregoing description, a base station<br>
inserts position information in a unit resource area of a<br>
corresponding channel region, i.e., in a FCH and/or DL-MAP<br>
information part of a frame to inform a terminal of a<br>
corresponding channel region. Moreover, the terminal is<br>
able to obtain such a channel position through FCH and/or<br>
DL-MAP as well as SCH of a superframe as well. Through<br><br>
this, a seamless communication service can be provided to a<br>
narrowband mode terminal entering a network in the middle<br>
of a superframe.<br>
Meanwhile, the base station is able to additionally<br>
insert position information of a narrowband mode support<br>
channel in SCH as well as the aforesaid unit resource area.<br>
In this case, if every channel is made to have the same<br>
SCH, a list indicating a presence or non-presence of a<br>
narrowband mode support of each channel is inserted in the<br>
SCH. In case that a different SCH is inserted in each<br>
channel, it is able to insert a presence or non-presence of<br>
a narrowband channel support of each channel. Besides, a<br>
base station is able to perform various operations using<br>
the above-explained superframe structure to perform<br>
efficient communication with a narrowband mode terminal.<br>
And, this can be apparently induced to those skilled in the<br>
art from the above-explained description.<br>
A superframe structure for providing a seamless<br>
communication service to a narrowband terminal according to<br>
a second embodiment of the present invention, in which a<br>
presence or non-presence of a narrowband mode support is<br>
discriminated with reference to a time, is explained as<br>
follows.<br><br>
Another example of a superframe structure enabling at<br>
least one frame region to support a narrowband mode user<br>
equipment (UE) according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention will be explained.<br>
According to this example, at least one frame region<br>
for supporting a narrowband mode terminal can be<br>
introduced. This method designates a frame for enabling a<br>
narrowband mode terminal to receive a service through FCH<br>
and/or MAP of frame. By enabling FCH and/or MAP of each<br>
frame to represent whether a corresponding frame supports a<br>
narrowband mode, a terminal entering a network within a<br>
superframe period is able to discriminate a frame<br>
supporting a narrowband mode.<br>
Yet, unlike FIG. 8 showing the case that a single<br>
channel region continuously supports a narrowband mode, if<br>
at least one frame is set to support a narrowband mode, a<br>
frame section for supporting a different narrowband mode is<br>
designated in a previous frame region. This is preferable<br>
because a frame position can be obtained more stably. In<br>
this case, a frame for which an initial narrowband mode is<br>
supported is designated by SCH and each frame for which a<br>
narrowband mode is supported can be made to designate a<br>
frame for which a next narrowband mode is supported. Like<br>
the case of the previous example, there exists at least one<br><br><br>
frame for a narrowband mode terminal. The narrowband mode<br>
terminal is serviceable on a narrowband only. Yet, on a<br>
band enabling the narrowband mode terminal to be serviced,<br>
a broadband mode terminal can be serviced as well.<br>
A method of implementing the above-described<br>
superframe structure is explained as follows.<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, it is able<br>
to implement that a frame region indicates whether the<br>
corresponding frame region itself supports a narrowband<br>
mode. More preferably, in a frame for supporting an initial<br>
narrowband mode, as shown in Table 4 and Table 5, a period<br>
to a period to a next frame enabling a narrowband mode and<br>
a frame number are announced.<br>
Table 4 and Table 5 show DIUC 9downlink interval<br>
usage code) as an information element (IE) included in DL-<br>
MAP and a corresponding narrowband IE format, respectively.<br>
[Table 4]<br><br><br>
[Table 5]<br><br><br>
Referring to Table 5, DL-MAP of a frame supporting a<br>
narrowband mode allocates 8-bit information to 'Frame<br>
number' to indicate a number of a next single mode frame<br><br>
used by a BS and also allocates 16-bit information to<br>
'Duration from the previous Narrowband Frame' to indicate a<br>
sustain period from a previous narrowband frame.<br>
Thus, by inserting information on a next frame<br>
supporting a narrowband mode, a narrowband mode terminal<br>
entering a network within a superframe period can be<br>
immediately provided with a service in a next narrowband<br>
mode frame section without waiting for a next superframe<br>
for communication with a base station.<br>
A method of performing communication between a base<br>
station and a terminal using the superframe having the<br>
above-explained structure is explained as follows.<br>
In a communication method according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention, as mentioned in the foregoing<br>
description, in performing communication using a superframe<br>
enabling at least one frame to support a narrowband mode, a<br>
base station inserts position information in a unit<br>
resource area of a corresponding frame region, i.e., in FCH<br>
and/or DL-MAP information part of a frame to inform a<br>
terminal of a corresponding frame region. And, the terminal<br>
is also able to obtain such a channel position through FCH<br>
and/or DLP-MAP as well as SCH of the superframe. Through<br>
this, a narrowband mode terminal entering a network in the<br><br>
middle of the superframe can be provided with a seamless<br>
communication service.<br>
Meanwhile, the base station is able to additionally<br>
insert position information of a narrowband mode support<br>
channel in the SCH as well as the aforesaid header part of<br>
the unit resource area. In this case, position information<br>
of a frame initially supporting a narrowband mode can be<br>
preferably delivered to the narrowband mode terminal<br>
through the SCH.<br>
A superframe structure for providing a seamless<br>
service to a narrowband terminal according to a third<br>
embodiment of the present invention, in which a presence or<br>
non-presence of a narrowband mode support is discriminated<br>
with reference to both a time and a channel, is explained<br>
as follows.<br>
Another example of a superframe structure for setting<br>
a prescribed region distributed and located in a prescribed<br>
channel region and a prescribed frame region to a region<br>
for supporting a narrowband mode UE according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention will be explained.<br>
Unlike the superframe for setting at least one<br>
channel region supporting a narrowband mode in the previous<br>
example or the superframe for setting at least one frame<br><br><br>
region supporting a narrowband mode in the another previous<br>
example, a frame structure supporting a narrowband mode and<br>
a superframe structure changing a channel are proposed.<br>
Namely, at least one unit resource area supporting a<br>
narrowband mode is located in a manner of being distributed<br>
to a prescribed channel and a frame region such as a frame<br>
1 region of a channel t+1 region, a frame m-1 region of a<br>
channel t-1 region, and a frame m region of a channel t + 1<br>
region.<br>
In this case, like the case of setting at least one<br>
narrowband mode frame region according to the previous<br>
example, in a manner that each unit resource area indicates<br>
whether the corresponding unit resource area itself<br>
supports a narrowband mode, a terminal entering a network<br>
within a superframe period is able to confirm the unit<br>
resource area supporting the narrowband mode.<br>
Yet, like the embodiment shown in the previous<br>
example, since a narrowband mode support resource area of<br>
the present example does not exist in a single channel<br>
continuously, it is preferable that information on a next<br>
narrowband support unit resource area is notified in a<br>
previous narrowband support unit resource area. In this<br>
case, it is preferable that a frame or channel for which an<br><br><br>
initial narrowband mode is supported is notified in SCH and<br>
that a next frame or channel is designated in the frame<br>
supporting the initial narrowband mode.<br>
Meanwhile, a method of implementing the superframe<br>
structure concretely is explained as follows.<br>
A structure of a superframe is explained in the<br>
following description on the assumption that position<br>
information of a narrowband mode support unit resource area<br>
is inserted in SCH and FCH and/or MAP area of each frame<br>
among the above-explained embodiments and that position<br>
information of the narrowband mode support unit resource<br>
area inserted in the FCH and/or MAP area of the each frame<br>
is the information on a next narrowband mode support unit<br>
resource area.<br>
In this case, if SCH of every channel is identical,<br>
'list of channel and frames' supporting a narrowband mode<br>
can be informed. On the other hand, if SCHs of entire<br>
channels differ from each other, 'list of frames'<br>
supporting a narrowband mode included in a corresponding<br>
channel is just informed. Theses cases are represented in<br>
Table 6 and Table 7, respectively.<br>
[Table 6]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[Table 7]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Referring to Table 6 and Table 7, in case of table 6<br>
showing that SCH is common to every channel, 8-bit<br>
information is allocated to both 'Narrowband number' and<br>
'Frame Numbers' in a portion indicating a narrowband mode<br>
support unit resource area to provide a list of channel and<br>
frames supporting a narrowband mode.<br>
On the contrary, in case of Table 7 showing different<br>
SCH per channel, 8-bit information is allocated to 'Frame<br>
Numbers' only in a portion indicating a narrowband mode<br>
support unit resource area to provide a list of frames<br>
supporting a narrowband mode only.<br>
Meanwhile, after the channel number and the frame<br>
number available for the narrowband mode have been<br>
designated to the SCH, a period or frame number from a<br>
channel or frame supporting an initial narrowband mode to a<br>
channel number and frame for a next narrowband mode, as<br>
shown in Table 8, is notified in each frame.<br>
[Table 8]<br><br><br><br>
Referring to Table 8, according to the present<br>
embodiment, "Channel Number' indicates a number of next<br>
narrowband channel used by a BS using 8-bit information,<br>
1 Frame Number' indicates a number of next narrowband frame<br>
used by a BS using 8-bit information, and "Duration from<br>
the previous Narrowband Frame' indicates a sustain period<br>
from a previous narrowband frame using 16-bit information.<br>
Compared to Table 5 for the embodiment relating to<br>
the superframe structure for setting at least one frame<br>
region to support the narrowband mode, Table 8 differs from<br>
Table 5 in that a number of a next narrowband mode support<br>
channel is informed as well as a frame number of a next<br>
narrowband mode support frame is delivered. This is because<br>
a resource area supporting a narrowband mode in a<br><br><br>
superframe structure according to the present embodiment is<br>
changed in a channel region as well as in a frame region.<br>
A method of performing communication between a base<br>
station and a terminal using the superframe having the<br>
above-explained structure is explained as follows.<br>
In a communication method according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention, as mentioned in the foregoing<br>
description, in performing communication using a superframe<br>
including a resource area supporting a narrowband mode<br>
distributed in a prescribed frame and a prescribed channel<br>
region, a base station inserts position information in a<br>
FCH and/or DL-MAP information part of a frame of a unit<br>
resource area of a corresponding resource area to inform a<br>
terminal of a corresponding resource region.<br>
And, the terminal is also able to obtain such a<br>
channel position through FCH and/or DLP-MAP as well as SCH<br>
of the superframe. Through this, a narrowband mode terminal<br>
entering a network in the middle of the superframe can be<br>
provided with a seamless communication service.<br>
Meanwhile, the base station is able to additionally<br>
insert position information of a narrowband mode support<br>
channel in the SCH as well as the aforesaid header part of<br>
the unit resource area. In this case, position information<br><br>
of a frame initially supporting a narrowband mode can be<br>
preferably delivered to the narrowband mode terminal<br>
through the SCH.<br>
In the superframe structures according to the<br>
aforesaid three kinds of embodiments, information included<br>
in SCH and a frame can be discriminated as follows.<br>
[Table 9]<br><br><br><br>
Items normally indicated in Table 9 are limited to<br>
the case that channel information for supporting a service<br>
of terminal having different performance is included in<br>
both SCH and a frame and included in FCH or DL-MAP<br>
information in the frame.<br>
A base station is able to perform communication using<br>
the superframe having the above-explained structure even if<br>
a narrowband mode terminal enters a network in the course<br>
of a superframe period.<br>
Configurational features of a base station and a<br>
terminal which perform data communication using the<br>
superframe are explained with reference to the drawings as<br>
follows.<br><br>
An example of configurational features of a base<br>
station capable of performing seamless communication with a<br>
narrowband mode terminal according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be explained.<br>
A base station according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention performs communication using a superframe<br>
including at least one resource area supporting narrowband<br>
mode communication, and more particularly, at least one<br>
channel region, at least one frame region, or a region<br>
distributed and located in a prescribed channel region and<br>
a prescribed frame region. And, the base station can<br>
include an information inserting unit and a transmitting &amp;<br>
receiving unit. The transmitting &amp; receiving unit can<br>
include a data receiving unit and a data transmitting unit<br>
in accordance with functions.<br>
First of all, the information inserting unit of the<br>
base station inserts information indicating a position of a<br>
resource area capable of supporting a narrowband mode<br>
terminal in a header part of a unit resource area of a<br>
corresponding superframe, and more particularly, in an FCH<br>
and/or MAP information part of a frame.<br><br>
In this case, the inserted information may differ in<br>
accordance with a type of a resource area supporting a<br>
narrowband mode.<br>
In particular, in case that the resource area<br>
includes at least one channel region, the inserted<br>
information may be the information indicating a channel<br>
number of the channel region.<br>
In case that the resource area includes at least one<br>
frame region, the inserted information may be the<br>
information indicating whether the frame region including<br>
the unit resource area itself supports the narrowband mode<br>
or the information indicating a number of a frame region<br>
including a narrowband mode support unit resource area next<br>
to a corresponding unit resource area and a sustain time to<br>
the corresponding area.<br>
In case that a resource area supporting a narrowband<br>
mode is distributed and located in a prescribed channel<br>
region and a prescribed frame region, the inserted<br>
information may be the information indicating whether the<br>
unit resource area itself supports the narrowband mode<br>
terminal or the information on a fame number of a unit<br>
resource area supporting a narrowband mode next to the<br>
former unit resource area, a channel number, and a sustain<br><br><br>
period to the corresponding area.<br>
After the information on the resource area supporting<br>
the narrowband mode has been inserted in the corresponding<br>
superframe by the information inserting unit, data is<br>
transmitted to a narrowband terminal entering a network<br>
within the superframe period by the data transmitting unit<br>
of the transmitting &amp; receiving unit or data is received by<br>
the data receiving unit.<br>
An example of configurational features of a terminal<br>
capable of performing seamless communication with a base<br>
station according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention will be explained.<br>
Like the base station, a terminal according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention performs communication<br>
using a superframe including at least one resource area<br>
supporting narrowband mode communication, and more<br>
particularly, at least one channel region, at least one<br>
frame region, or a region distributed and located in a<br>
prescribed channel region and a prescribed frame region.<br>
The terminal may include a location information<br>
obtaining unit and a transmitting &amp; receiving unit. The<br>
transmitting &amp; receiving unit can include a data<br>
transmitting and a data receiving unit in accordance with<br><br><br><br>
functions.<br>
First of all, a terminal, and more particularly, a<br>
narrowband mode terminal should obtain a position of a<br>
resource area supporting a narrowband mode to perform<br>
communication with a base station.<br>
So, the location information obtaining unit of the<br>
terminal according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention searches a header part of a unit resource area<br>
and then obtains location information of a resource area<br>
supporting narrowband mode communication.<br>
In this case, the header part of the unit resource<br>
area, as mentioned in the foregoing description, may<br>
include FCH and/or DL MAP. And, the obtained location<br>
information can indicate whether the unit resource area<br>
itself including the location information supports the<br>
narrowband mode or include location information on a next<br>
narrowband mode support unit resource area.<br>
In any case, the narrowband mode terminal should<br>
deliver the location information of the resource area to<br>
enable the narrowband mode terminal to initiate<br>
communication with the base station within the<br>
corresponding superframe period.<br>
After the location information of the resource area<br><br><br>
supporting the narrowband mode has been obtained, the<br>
transmitting &amp; receiving unit of the terminal according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention is able to perform<br>
communication with the base station in a manner of<br>
receiving data via the data receiving unit or transmitting<br>
data via the data transmitting unit.<br>
While the present invention has been described and<br>
illustrated herein with reference to the preferred<br>
embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to those skilled<br>
in the art that various modifications and variations can be<br>
made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of<br>
the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present<br>
invention covers the modifications and variations of this<br>
invention that come within the scope of the appended claims<br>
and their equivalents.<br>
