In a further aspect, the present invention provides processes for the preparation of compounds of formulae (I), (IA) and (IB), their pharmaceutical^ and veterinarily acceptable  salts,  and  pharmaceutical^ and veterinarily acceptable solvates of either entity, as illustrated below. It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that, within certain of the processes described, the order of the synthetic steps employed may be varied and will depend inter alia on factors such as the nature of other functional groups present in a particular substrate, the availability of key intermediates and the protecting group strategy (if any) to be adopted. Clearly, such factors will also influence the choice of reagent for use in the said synthetic steps.   Illustrative of a protecting group strategy is the route to the azetidine analogues (Examples 18,   19 and 20),  the precursor, to which  (preparations 63,  66  and 61 respectively) contain t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) as the nitrogen protecting group.<br>

Examples include alkoxide exchange at the 2-position of the 5-(pyridin-3-yl) substituent (see conversions of Example 3 to Examples 27, Example 8 to Example 28 and 29, Example 21 to Example 32 and 33, Example 4 to Examples 41, Example 9 to Example 43, and Example 66 to Example 75), amine exchange at the 2-position of the 5-(pyridin-3-yl) substituent (see conversions of Example 7 to Examples 78), reactions at a nitrogen containing substituent, such as reductive alkylation (Example 18 to Example 21), acetamide 'formation (Examples 18, and 20 to Examples 22 and "<br>
24	respectively) or sulphonamide formation (Preparations 68, 67 to Examples<br>
25	to 62 respectively), and reduction of a nitro functionality to provide an amino group (Example 63 to Example 64). The deprotection and transformations described herein and as illustrated in the Examples and<br>
-23-<br><br>
Preparations sections may be effected in a "one-pof procedure (see for example the conversion of the compound of preparation 65 into the compound of example 26).<br>

wherein Rr is R'° (i.e. OR° or NRDR°) or X wherein R1J, RJ, R3 and RD are as defined hereinbefore and X is a leaving group and wherein general formula (IX) can be represented by formulae (IXA), (IXB) or (IXC) respectively:<br>

wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as previously defined herein and wherein X is a leaving group and may be any group which is displaceable by an amino group of the formula -NR5R6 or by an alkoxy group and wherein the intermediate compounds of general formulae (IXA) and (IXB) can be represented by their regioisomeric general formulae as previously illustrated for compounds having the general formulae (I). Suitable leaving groups, X, for use herein include halogen, alkoxy, amino, tosylate groups and further groups are detailed hereinafter.<br>
1.1     A compound of formula (I) wherein R13 = NR5R6 rr     be prepared by cyclisation of a compound of general formula (IXA):<br>
-25-<br><br><br>
R4<br>
(IXA).<br>
wherein R1, R2, R4, R5 and R6 are as previously defined herein for compounds of the formula (I), (IAJ or (IB). Preferably, the cyclisation is base-mediated, . using an alkali metal salt of a sterically hindered alcohol or amine. For example, the required cyclisation may be effected using about a 1- to 5-, preferably a 1.2- to 3.5-fold excess of potassium t-butoxide, potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide or cesium carbonate, optionally in the presence of molecular sieves, in a suitable solvent, such as for example an inert solvent e.g. DMF or NHR5R6 or mixtures thereof, at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture optionally in the presence of about a 1 molar equivalent of ethyl acetate or ethyl pivalate, or, the reaction can optionally be carried out in a sealed vessel at about 100 - T30°C optionally in the presence of about a 1 molar equivalent of ethyl acetate or ethyl pivalate.<br>
1.2 A general route for the synthesis of compounds (I) via compounds (IXB) is illustrated in Scheme 1 wherein said intermediate compounds (IXB) have the general formula :<br><br>
wherein R1, R2 and R4 are as previously defined herein for compounds of the formula (I), (IA) and (IB) and wherein X is a leaving group as defined<br>
-26-<br><br>
hereinbefore, by reaction in the presence of "OR3 and a hydroxide trapping agent.   The conversion (IXB) to (I) can be undertaken in either a stepwise process or a one-pot process.    A number of stepwise permutations are feasible, some of which are subsets of others. These include i) cyclisation (IXB to XXX) followed by displacement (XXX to I); ii) cyclisation (IXCa to XXX) followed by displacement (XXX to I); iii) displacement (IXB to IXC) followed by cyclisation (IXC to I); and iv) displacement (IXCa to IXC) followed by cyclisation (IXC to I) wherein compounds (XXX) and (IXCa) have the general formulae:<br><br><br>

wherein R1, R2, R4 and X are as defined herein before and OR3a is an alkoxy<br>
group which is different from and displaceable by the desired OR3 group on<br>
the final compounds of general formula (I) and wherein R3a is selected from<br>
C1 to C6 alkyl optionally substituted with one or two substituents selected from<br>
C3 to C5 cycloalkyi, hydroxy, C1 to C4 alkoxy, benzyloxy, NR5R6, phenyl, Het1,<br>

optionally be terminated by a haloalkyl group such as CF3 and wherein the<br>
C3-C5 cycloalkyi group may optionally be substituted by C1-C4 alkyl, hydroxy<br>
or halo; C3 to C6 cycloalkyi; Het1, Het2, Het3 or Het4. Preferably R3a is C1 to C6<br>
alkyl	<br>
To effect initial displacement without significant simultaneous cyclisation it is preferred that the displacement with "OR3 (in (iii) or (iv)) is carried out in the range of from about 80°C to; about 90°C to provide a compound of the<br>
-27-<br><br>
general formula (IXC). Subsequent cyclisation to a compound of general formula (I) is generally carried but at a temperature greater than about 115°C.<br>
To effect initial cyclisation without significant simultaneous displacement it is preferred that, for (IXCa) to (XXX) (in (ii)), the reaction is conducted at a temperature greater than about 110°C with ~OR3a in R3aOH. Subsequent displacement to a compound of general formula (I) is generally carried out with "OR3 in R3OH in the range of from about 80°C to about 90°C.<br>
For conversion of (IXB) to (I) (ie. (i) above), it may be preferred to obtain compounds of general formula (I) directly from compounds of genera! formula (IXB) since both the cyclisation and displacement components of this reaction can be carried out in a "one-pot" reaction. Such a "one-pot" process can be run at lower pressures (ie. nearer ambient pressure) than say a stepwise cyclisation and displacement process (ie. (ii) above) if the boiling point of R3OH is higher than that of R3aOH and where the ambient boiling point of R3aOH is less than about 115°C (ie. too low to effect cyclisation at ambient pressure). It should be noted that is may still be necessary to operate such processes at higher temperatures than the boiling point of HOR3, i.e. at higher pressure.<br>
In the case of compounds of general formula (IXC) as detailed hereinafter wherein X is OR3, compounds of general formula (I) can be obtained by direct cyclisation by reacting in the presence of an auxiliary base, a hydroxide trapping agent and an appropriate solvent R3OH or an inert solvent or a combination thereof.<br>
The temperature of the reaction of compounds of the general formula (IXB) to compounds of the general formula (I) (such as the corresponding formation of compounds (IA) and (IB)) is preferably at least about 80°C, more preferably about 80 to about 130°C , more preferably still about 100 to about 130°C and most preferably about 1-15- to about 125°C.   These temperatures are also   •<br>
-28-<br><br>
applicable for the conversion of compounds (XXX) to (I), although the temperature in this case could also probably be lower (e.g. about 60° C) since there is no cyclisation taking place.<br>
Preferably compounds of formula (I), or (IA), or (IB) wherein<br>
R1 is - (CH2)n(C= - C4)cycloalkyl wherein n is 1 or 2; or<br>
R1 is - (CH2)n(C3 - C6)cycloalkyl wherein n is 0; or<br>
R1 is - cyclopentylmethyl; or<br>
R1 is   methyl, ethyl, i-propyl or n-propyl substituted by methoxy, ethoxy, n-<br>
propoxy or i-propoxy wherein said alkoxy substituent may be directly attached<br>

A particular advantage of the use of the hydroxide trapping agent is that a higher yield of final product (compounds of general formula (I), (IA) or (IB)) can be obtained than for the same reaction where the trapping agent is not present.<br>
Preferably the hydroxide trapping agent is an ester. More preferably said hydroxide trapping agent is an ester of the formula:<br><br>
wherein OT is OR or the residue of a bulky alcohol or a non-nucleophilic alcohol or TOH is an alcohol which can be azeotropically removed during the reaction; and C(0)V is the residue of a carboxylic acid. For example, where OR3 is OEt in compound (IXC) the hydroxide trapping agent ( TOC(0)V ) could be e.g. ethyl acetate or ethyl, pivalate. Preferably V is a C1 to C4 alkyl group.<br>
Preferably X is selected from the group consisting of -OR3, halo, optionally, substituted aryisulphonyioxy, preferably phenyisulphonyloxy, more preferably a para- substituted aryl (phenyl) such as by a C1-C4 alkyl group e.g. p-toluenesulphonyloxy; C1-C4 alkylsulphonyloxy e.g. methanesulphonyJoxy; nitro or halo substituted.benzenesulphonyloxy preferably para- substituted e.g. p-bromobenzenesulfonyloxy        or        p-nitrobenzenesulphonyloxy;        C1-C4<br>

"OR3 can act both as a nucleophile (to displace the leaving group by nucleophilic substitution) and as a base (to bring about the cyclisation).<br>
"OR3 can be generated in solution from, for example, a salt ZOR3 (wherein Z is a cation) such as a metal salt. More particularly an alkali (such as sodium or potassium) or alkaline earth metal salt of -OR3 in a suitable solvent would give rise to -OR3 in solution. In another embodiment, -OR3 is formed in situ from R3OH plus an auxiliary base (i.e. a base other than -OR3). However, in another system, ZOR3 could be used in the reaction system with an auxiliary base.<br>
As will be appreciated the solvent in which the reaction takes place can be R3OH or an inert solvent (or a mixture of both). By inert solvent we mean a solvent which will not form a nucleophile under the reaction conditions or if a nucleophile is formed it is sufficiently hindered or unreactive such that it does not substantially compete in the displacement reaction. When R3OH is used as a source of "OR3, then a separate solvent is not essentially required but an (auxiliary) inert solvent (i.e. a solvent other than R3OH) may be used as a co-solvent in the reaction.<br>
Suitable solvents are as follows: R3OH, a secondary or tertiary C4-C12 alkanol, a C3-C12 cycloalkanol, a tertiary C4-C12 cycloalkanol, a secondary or tertiary (C3-C7 cycloaIky!)C2-C6 alkanol, a C3-C9 alkanone, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-<br>

More preferably, the solvent is R3OH, a tertiary C4-C12 alkanol, a tertiary C4-C12 cycloalkanol, a tertiary (C3-C7 Gycloalkyl)C2-C6 alkanol, a C3-C9 alkanone, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane, diglyme, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxan, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulphoxide, sulpholane, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, pyridine, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Most preferably the solvent is R3OH, which means that "OR3 is formed in situ, such as in the presence of an auxiliary base.<br>
A wide range of auxiliary bases can be used in the process of the invention. Typically the bases would not substantially compete with -OR3 in the nucleophilic substitution of X (i.e. they would be non oucleophilic) such as by suitably being sterically hindered.<br>
Preferably the auxiliary base is selected from the group consisting of a<br>
sterically hindered base, a metal hydride, metal oxide, metal carbonate and<br>
metal bicarbonate!	 <br>
The sterically hindered base is advantageously a metal sait of a sterically hindered alcohol or amine.<br>
More preferably the auxiliary bases in accordance with the invention are selected from the group consisting of metal salts'of a sterically hindered alcohol or amine such as a secondary or tertiary C4-C12 alkanol, a C3-C12 cycloalkanol and a secondary or tertiary (C3-C6 cycloalkyl)CrC6 alkanol, a N-(secondary or tertiary C3-C= alkyl)-N-(primary, secondary or tertiary C3-C6 a!kyl)amine, a N-(C3-C8 cycloalkyl)-N-(primary, secondary or tertiary C3-C6<br>

alkyl)amine, a di(C3-C8 cycloalkyl)amine or hexamethyldisilazane; 1,5-diazabicyclo[4,3,0]non-5-ene and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene; a metal hydride, oxide, carbonate, and bicarbonate.<br>
Yet more preferably the auxiliary bases in accordance with the invention are selected from the group consisting of metal salts of a sterically hindered alcohol or amine such as a tertiary C4-C12 alkanol, a C3-C12 cycloalkanol and a tertiary (C3-C8 cycloalkyl)CrC6 alkanol, a N-(secondary or tertiary C3-C6 alkyl)-N-(primary, secondary or tertiary C3-C6 alkyl)amine, a N-(C3-C8 cycloalkyl)-N-(primary, secondary or tertiary C3-C6 alkyl)amihe, a di(C3-C8 cycloalkyl)amine or hexamethyldisilazane; 1,5-diazabicyclo[4,3,0]non-5-ene and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene; a metal hydride, oxide, carbonate, and bicarbonate.<br>
More preferably still, the auxiliary base is selected from the sterically hindered<br>
bases of the previous paragraph (i.e. all of them except the metal hydride,<br>
oxide, carbonate and bicarbonate)	<br>
Most preferably still, the auxiliary base is the metal salt of a tertiary C4-C6 alcohol such as the alkali or alkaline earth metal salts (e.g. Na/K) of t-butanol or t-amyl alcohol, or the base is KHMDS.<br>
Most preferably, the auxiliary base is the alkali metal salt of t-butanol (e.g. potassium t-butoxide).<br>
The metal of the salt of ZOR3 and the auxiliary base can be independently selected from alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium) or alkaline earth metals (beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium). Preferably the metal-is sodium, potassium, lithium or magnesium. More preferably the metal is sodium or potassium.<br>
To maximise yields, it is further preferred that when X is any group hereinbefore defined except-OR3, then at least about 1 molecular equivalent...<br>
-34-<br><br>
wo Qi)fa7ii6	rrTiimn'miT<br>
of auxiliary base and -OR3 are used. If -OR3 also functions as a base (i.e. there is no auxiliary base present) then preferably at least about 2 equivalents of "OR3 are present. Suitably, at least about 1 equivalent of trapping agent (preferably at least about 2 equivalents) is present. In the case where X=OR3 (i.e. starting from (IXC) rather than (IXB) then, in theory, at least 1 equivalent of base is required, wherein said base may be -OR or auxiliary base.<br>
The temperature of the reaction of compounds of the general formula (IXC) to compounds of the general formula (I) (such as the corresponding formation of compounds (IA) and (IB)) is preferably at least about 80°C, more preferably about 80 to about 130°C , more preferably still about 100 to about 130°C and most preferably about 115 to about 125°C.<br>
The reaction temperature attainable to effect the conversion of compounds of the general formulae (IXB), (IXC) or (XXX) to compounds of the general formula(I) depends on the solvent , the nature of "OR3 and X. When X is Oh ' (wherein OR3a and OR3 are not the same), i.e. a compound of the formula (IXCa) and R3OH is the solvent, preferably XH (such as CrC6 alkohol) is removed azeotropically (of course the reaction vessel must be configured to distill over the azeotrope mixture) with R3OH by running the reaction at the azeotrope temperature of XH and R3OH. In this way the yield and quality of the final product can be further improved. For example, (where X is an alkoxy, preferably ethanol) the conversion of compound (XXX), (IXB) or (IXC) to (I) is preferably carried out at the azeotrope temperature of the alcohol (i.e. XH (preferably ethanol)) with R3OH. When X=OR3 and the solvent is R3OH there is no requirement to azeotrope out R3OH.<br>
Thus in a preferred embodiment of the present invention there is provided a process for the synthesis of compounds of general formula (I), (IA) or (IB) and in particular compounds of general formula (I), (IA) or (IB) wherein R1 is -(CH2)n(C3 - C4)cycloalkyl wherein n is 1 or 2; or R1 is - (CH2)n(C3 -C6)cycloalkyl wherein n is 0; or R1 is - (CH2)n(C5)cycl6alkyl wherein n is 1; or<br>

. In a preferred embodiment of Scheme 2, X is an -OR3 alkoxy group and so Q in compound (XIV) represents OR3. Preferably OR3 is a C1 to C6 alkoxy group, more preferably a C1 to C4 primary or secondary alkoxy group and especially ethoxy. However for other leaving groups the general method for Scheme 2 would apply.<br>
This preferred embodiment of Scheme 2 is illustrated in Scheme 3. In Scheme 3 the intermediate of formula (XB) is formed from a compound of formula (XIV) by removal of protecting group P by a deprotecting agent, advantageously by saponification in the presence of a hydroxide base such as sodium hydroxide, preferably in an appropriate solvent such as water and toluene.<br>
The intermediate of formula (XIV) is formed from a compound of formula (XV) in the presence of an appropriate C1-C6 alkoxide nucleophile (-QR3), (such as a primary or secondary alkoxide), preferably a metal alkoxide of the formula ZOR3, wherein the metal (Z) is as defined hereinbefore for ZOR, such as sodium ethoxide, preferably in an appropriate solvent such as toluene or R3OH, wherein R3OH is as defined hereinbefore and is preferably ethoxy: D in compounds of formulae (XV) and (XVI) is CI or Br, more preferably D is CI.<br>
The intermediate of formula (XV) is formed from a compound of formula (XVI) by reaction with N-R10piperazine, preferably in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine or excess N-R10piperazine, preferably in an appropriate solvent such as toluene.'<br>
The intermediate of formula (XVI) is formed from a compound of formula (XX) in the presence of a chlorinating or brominating agent as defined for the same step in Scheme 2 such as thionyl chloride or bromide, preferably thionyl chloride or bromide / dimethylformamide. The former can also act as the solvent, but more preferably the reaction takes place in an appropriate other solvent, such as toluene.   In such a case only stoicheiometric amounts of<br>
-47-<br><br>
V thionyl chloride/bromide would be required, preferably as at least 2 molar .' equivalents more preferably at least 5 molar equivalents.'<br>
The. intermediate of formula (XX) is formed from a compound of formula<br>
(XVII) in the presence of an agent which will form a protecting group (P) for<br>
the carboxylic acid (i.e. to form the -COP group) as defined herein before.<br>
Preferably said agent is an esterification agent, to form a carboxylic acid ester<br>
such as a C1-C6 carboxylic acid ester which will be carried through the<br>
reaction scheme and hydrolysed under basic conditions to the carboxylic acid<br>
function of compound (XB). Most preferably the esterification agent is<br>
ethanol. An additional solvent such as toluene may be utilised as<br>
appropriate.	*<br>
The intermediate of formula (XVII) is formed from 2-hydroxynicotinic acid with a sulphohylating agent such as 30% oleum.<br>
Again it is possible to undertake the four step conversion of (XX) to (XB) in a single telescoped step (as set out hereinbefore) in the same pot, without intermediate product isolation, using the same solvent (herein the "telescoping" solvent) throughout. The list of solvents described with respect to Scheme 2 are directly applicable here. Most preferably the solvent is toluene.<br>
For example after formation of compound (XVI), the excess chlorinating/brominating agent could be azeotroped off at the azeotrope temperature of the said agent and the telescope solvent. After formation of compound (XV), the HBr/HCI (i.e. HD) salts which are formed could be washed out (in aqueous) or filtered from the reaction vessel and the remainder, of the aqueous solvent.(where applicable) azeotroped off with some of the telescoping solvent. In the formation of compound (XIV), if the alkoxide used to introduce OR3 is dissolved in solvent (such as ethanol), then this solvent could again be azeotroped off with some of.the telescoping solvent. If solid alkoxide is used then this latter azeotroping step is not<br>
-48-<br><br>
required. Most preferably the telescoping solvent for any telescoped steps of scheme 3 is toluene.<br>
It will be appreciated that salts of the compounds of Schemes 1 to 3 can be formed in accordance with the invention by converting the relevant compound to a salt thereof (either in situ or as a separate step). Also an acid addition salt of the compound of formula (I) can be formed in accordance with the invention.<br>
1.4.     Clearly, for certain compounds of formulae (I), (IA) or (IB) wherein R13. is OR3, by exploiting the cyclisation and alkoxide exchange methodology described in sections 1.2 and 2.1 herein, it may be particularly advantageous to generate a compound of formula (I), (IA) or (IB) from a compound of the general formula (IXCa), wherein the 2-alkoxy group of the 5-(pyridin-3-yl) substituent in the former is different from that in the latter, directly in a "one-pot reaction".  To achieve this an alternative alcohol (R3OH) should be used wherein the alkyl chain of the -R3 group of the alcohol is different from that of the -R3a group on the starting compound of general formula (IXCa).   When the alcohol which is to provide the alternative 2-alkoxy group ( -OR3) is too scarce or expensive to be employed as the reaction solvent, then it will be expedient to use a suitable alternative such as 1,4-dioxan as reaction solvent with the required alcohol (R3aOH) present in an amount sufficient to effect the desired conversion, typically from about 1 to about 2 molecular equivalents. (IXCa) and R3a are as defined hereinbefore.<br>
2. In a further generally applicable process, compounds of the general formula (I), (IA) or (IB) may be prepared from "alternative" compounds of the general formula (I), (IA) or (IB) wherein said process may comprise either interconversion of differing -OR3 groups, interconversion of X and -OR3 -groups or interconversion of -OR3 and -NR5R6 groups wherein X, R3 and NR5R6 are as defined hereinbefore.<br>
-49-<br><br>
2.1      As mentioned earlier, certain compounds of formulae (I), (IA) and (IB) can be interconverted by inducing alkoxide exchange or displacement at the 2-position of the 5-(pyridin-3-yl) substituent.    This may be achieved, by treating the appropriate alcohol (of formula R3aOH wherein the R3a alkyl group is as defined hereinbefore and is different from the R3 group on the starting material (I), (IA) or (IB) with an alkali metal salt of a sterically hindered alcohol or amine in order to generate the required alkoxide anion which then reacts with the substrate. Typically, in a two-step procedure, a mixture of from about 1 to about 8, more preferably from about 5 to about 8, and especially from about 4 to about 8 molecular equivalents of potassium bis(trimethyisilyl)amide ..and the required alcohol (of formula R3aOH) as solvent is heated at from about 80°C to about 100°C for about 25 minutes to about 1 hour, followed by addition of the compound of formula (IA) or (IB) and heating of the reaction mixture at from about 100°C to about 130°C for from about 6 to about 24 hours.  Alternatively, in a one-step procedure, the substrate may be treated directly, in the required alcohol as solvent, with from about 1.2 to about 6, preferably from about 4 to about 6. molecular equivalents of, for example, potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, potassium t-butoxide or cesium carbonate at from   about 80°C  to about 130°C.   A hydroxide trapping agent may be optionally included in such alkoxide exchange reactions.<br><br>
2.2     Alternatively, certain compounds of the general formula (I), (IA) or (IB)<br>
wherein R13 is -OR3 may be obtained from compounds of the general formula<br>
where]<br>
(XXX):<br><br>

WO 
wherein R1, R2, R4 are as defined previously herein and wherein X is anything other than -OR3 by reaction in the presence of -OR3' optionally in the presence of a hydroxide trapping agent as defined hereinbefore.<br>
2.3 In a yet further alternative synthesis compounds of the general formula (I), (IA) or (IB) wherein R13 is NR5R6 may be generated directly from a compound of general formula (I) wherein R13 = OR3. When R13 is OR3, the substrate may be treated with an excess of R5R6NH, or a suitable acid addition salt thereof, in the presence of an excess of a non-nucleophilic .  base such as a sterically hindered amine or a suitable inorganic base in a suitable solvent.  Typically, R5R6NH ^s used as the free base with about a 3-fold excess (over the substrate) of potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (KHMDS)   in  dimethylformamide   (DMF)   as  solvent  at   about   100°C. Alternatively, an excess of R5R6NH may be used as the solvent and the reaction conducted in the presence of about a 50% excess of copper(ll) sulphate at up to the reflux temperature of the reaction medium. Where the desired amino substituent on the compound of the formula (I), (IA) or (IB) is -NR5R6 and one of either R5 or R6 is H, then the exchange reaction may be carried out by refluxing with the appropriate amine, and copper(ll)sulphate penta- or hepta-hydrate or anhydrous copper (II) sulphate or KHDMS in DMF.  Typically, to exchange the OR3 group for alternative amines of the formula NHR5R6, such as compounds wherein R5 or R6 are selected from aliphatic or cyclic amines, optionally including oxygen (e.g. morpholine), then the reaction is preferably carried out by treating with the appropriate amine and about 3 equivalents of potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in DMF for about 18 hours at 100°C.<br>

4. A further, generally applicable, synthetic route to compounds of the general formula (l),-(IA) or (IB) involves incorporation of the R1 substituent in the final step of the synthesis. Thus a compound of the general formula (I), (IA) or (IB) may be prepared by alkylation of a compound of formula (la), (IAaj or (IBa) wherein R1 is hydrogen and R2, R13 and R4 are as previously defined for formulae (I), (IA) and (IB), using one or more of a plethora of well-known methods, such as:<br>
(i) reaction with a compound of formula R1J, wherein R1 is as previously defined for compounds of general formulae (I), (IA) and (IB), and J is a suitable leaving group, e.g. halo (preferably chloro, bromo or iodo), C1-C4 alkanesulphonyloxy, trifluoromethanesulphonyloxy or arylsulphonyloxy (such as benzenesulphonyloxy or p-toluenesulphonyloxy), in the presence of ah appropriate base, optionally in the presence of sodium iodide or potassium iodide, at from about -70°C to about 100°C. Preferably the alkylation is conducted at from about room temperature to about 120°C. Suitable base-solvent combinations may be selected from:<br>
(a) sodium, potassium or cesium carbonate, sodium or potassium bicarbonate, or a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or pyridine,<br>
-57-<br><br>
together with a Ci to C4 alkanol, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxan, acetonitrile, pyridine,- N,N-dimethylformamide or N.N-dimethylacetamide;<br>

(d)	under phase transfer catalysis conditions, a tetraalkylammonium halide or hydroxide, together with a mixture of an aqueous solution of sodium'or potassium hydroxide arid dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane or chloroform;<br>
Typically, either about a 10% excess of sodium hydride is added to a solution of the substrate in a suitable solvent, e.g. anhydrous tetrahydrofuran or cesium carbonate in dimethyiformamide (DMF) is employed, and the resulting anion treated with about a 10% excess of the required R1 J.<br>
(ii) reaction with a compound of formula R1OH, wherein R1 is as previously defined for compounds of the general formulae (I), (IA) and (IB), using classical Mitsunobu methodology. Typical reaction conditions involve treating the substrate with the alkanol in the presence of a triarylphosphine and a di(Ci to C4)alkyl azodicarboxylate, in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxan, at from about -5°C to about room temperature.<br>
(iii) reaction. with a compound of formula R1M, wherein R1 represents optionally-substituted phenyl, Het2, Het3 or Het4 and wherein said Het groups are either aromatic or partially unsaturated at the C atom that is attached to M, and wherein M represents an optionally substituted metal or boron group wherein said metal or boron group is suitable for cross-coupling   reactions   (of   metal   or   boron   compounds),   for  example  a<br>
-58-<br><br>
dihydroxyborane, in the presence of an appropriate catalyst system (e.g. copper (II) acetate) or under so-called "Goldberg" conditions. Such cross-coupling is preferably carried out in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. pyridine), and a drying agent, typically 4A molecular sieves, in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or N-methylpyrrolidine, and optionally under microwave irradiation.<br>
(iv) reaction with a compound of formula R1E, where E is halo, preferably bromo, under conditions suitable for cross-coupling of halogenated compounds, where R1 is as defined in (iii). Such reaction is typically carried out in the presence of an appropriate catalyst system (e.g. Palladium catalyst), in the presence of a suitable base, such as for' example sodium f-butoxide, in a suitable solvent, such as toluene, with heating, typically at about 70CC.<br>
4.1 Thus, a compound of general formula (la), (IAa) or (IBa), wherein R1 is hydrogen and R2, R13 and R4 are as previously defined for compounds of general formulae (I), (IA) or (IB), may be obtained from a compound of formula (IXAa) or (IXBa) or (IXCa) respectively wherein R1 is hydrogen, and R2, R3, R5, R6 and R4 and X are as previously defined for formulae (IXA), (IXB) or (IXC), under the same conditions as those used for the conversion of a compound of the general formula (IXA), (IXB) or (IXC) to a compound of the general formula (I), (IA) or (IB) respectively when R1 is other than hydrogen, followed by acidification of the reaction mixture to a pH of about 6.<br>
4.2 In a further alternative, generally applicable synthetic route the compounds of the present invention may be prepared by cyclisation of compounds of the general formulae (IXA), (IXB) or (IXC) wherein said compounds of the general formulae (IXA), (IXB) or (IXC) are obtained from compounds of the general formulae (IXAa), (IXBa) or (IXCa) wherein R1 is hydrogen and R2, R3, R5, R6 and R4 are as previously defined herein, using one or more of a plethora of well-known methods such as are detailed hereinbefore for conversion of compounds of the general formulae (la), (IAa)<br>
-59-<br><br>
and (IBa) to compounds of the general formulae (I), (IA) and (IB). Any of the previously detailed methods for. such general. conversion may be used. Preferred conditions for such conversion use either from about 1.0 to 1.3 equivalents of sodium hydride in tetrahydrofuran solvent at from about -78° to about room temperature and from about 1.1 to about 2.3 equivalents of alkylating agent at from about 60°C to about 70°C, or from about 2.2 equivalents of cesium carbonate as base in dimethylformamide as solvent and about 1.1. equivalent of alkylating agent at about 60°C.<br>
5. In a yet further alternative synthesis, compounds of the general formula (I), (IA) or (IB) can be obtained from compounds of the general formula (I) wherein R10 is H, via a suitable alkylation reaction such as for example with an alkyl halide and a suitable base e.g. cesium carbonate and methyl chloride.<br>
In a preferred process for the preparation of the compounds according to the present invention compounds of general formula (VIIB) are prepared from compounds of the general formula (XIIIB) according to the process detailed in Preparations 96(a) to (h). These compounds of general formula (VIIB) are coupled with compounds of general formula (XC) according to the process detailed in Preparations 29 and 96(i) to provide a compound of general formula (IXC), wherein said compound of general formula (IXC) is prepared according to the process detailed in Preparation 95. The compound of general formula (IXC) is then preferably cyclised under basic conditions according to the process detailed in Examples 8 and 102 to form compounds of general formula (IB) wherein R13 is OR3.<br>
The 4-aminopyrazole-5-carboxamides of general formulae (VII), (VIIA) and (VIIB.),. the pyrazoles of general formula (XIII), the carboxylic acids of formulae (XA), (XB), (XllA), (XIIB), (XIIC), (VIIA), (VIIB), (VIIC) and (X), or the compounds of the general formula R1J and R1E when neither commercially available nor subsequently described, can be obtained either by analogy with the processes .described in the Preparations section or by conventional<br>
-60-<br><br>
WO 0187113<br>
synthetic procedures, in accordance with standard textbooks on organic chemistry or literature precedent, from readily accessible starting materials using appropriate reagents and reaction conditions.<br>
Moreover, persons skilled in the art will be aware of variations of, and alternatives to, those processes described hereinafter in the Examples and Preparations sections which allow the compounds defined by formulae (I), (IA) or (IB) to be obtained.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formulae (I), (IA) or (IB) which contain a basic centre may also be prepared in a conventional manner. By way of illustration, acid addition salts of compounds of formula (I) (more particularly IA and IB) can be formed by reacting a compound of formula (I) with an equimolar or excess amount of the appropriate acid, either neat or in a suitable solvent. The salt may then be precipitated out of solution and. isolated by filtration or the reaction solvent can be stripped off by conventional means such as by evaporation under vacuum. Typical salts which can be used in the schemes of 1 to 3 are given in PCT/IB99/00519. Example of salts of compounds IA and IB are the p-toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, camphorsulfonate and ethanesulfonate respectively..<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be obtained in an analogous manner by treating a solution of a compound of formula (I), (IA) or (IB) with the appropriate base. Both types of salt may be formed or interconverted using ion-exchange resin techniques.<br>
The present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of a compound of the formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An isotopic variation of a compound of the formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes<br>
-61-<br><br>
that  can   be   incorporated   into   compounds   of   the   formula   (I)      and   pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 170,180, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18Fand 36CI, respectively. Certain isotopic variations of the compounds of the formula (I) and pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as 3H or 14C is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies.  Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., UC, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability.   Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements,and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.   Isotopic variations of the compounds of -formula (I) and pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof of this invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures such as by the illustrative methods or by the preparations described in the Examples and Preparations hereafter using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that certain protected derivatives of compounds of the formulae (I), (IA) or (IB)T, which may be made prior to a final de-protection stage, may not possess pharmacological activity as such, but may, in certain instances, be administered orally or parenterally and thereafter metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention which are pharmacologically active. Such derivatives may therefore be described as "prof drugs". Further, certain compounds of the formulae (I), (IA) or (IB) may act as pro-drugs of other compounds of the formulae (I), (IA) or (IB).<br>
All protected derivatives, and pro-drugs, of compounds of general formulae (I), (IA) or (IB) are included within the scope of the invention. Suitable protecting groups for use in accordance with the invention can be found in "Protecting Groups" edited by P.J. Kocienski, Thieme, New York, 1994 - see particularly chapter 4, page 118-154 for carboxy protecting groups; and "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" 2nd edition, T.W. Greeene &amp; P.G.M. Wutz,<br>

Wiley -Interscience (1991)- see particularly chapter 5 for carboxy protecting groups. Examples of suitable pro-drugs for the compounds of the present invention are described in Drugs of Today, Volume 19, Numbers, 1983, pp 499 - 538 and in Topics in Chemistry, Chapter 31, pp 306 - 316.<br>
The biological activities of the compounds of the present invention were determined by the following test methods.<br>
Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitory activity<br>
The compounds of the present invention 'are potent and selective cGMP PDE5 inhibitors. ]n vitro PDE inhibitory activities against cyclic guanosine 3\5'-monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine 3\5'-mohophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterases were determined by measurement of their IC50 values (the concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of enzyme activity).<br>
The required PDE enzymes were isolated from a variety of sources, including human corpus cavemosum, human and rabbit platelets, human cardiac ventricle, human skeletal muscle and bovine retina, essentially by the method of W.J. Thompson and M.M. Appleman (Biochem., 1971, 10, 311). In particular, the cGMP-specific PDE (PDE5) and the cGMP-inhibited cAMP PDE (PDE3) were obtained from human corpus cavemosum tissue, human platelets or rabbit platelets; the cGMP-stimulated PDE (PDE2) was obtained from human corpus cavemosum; the calcium/calmodulin (Ca/CAM)-dependent PDE (PDE1) from human cardiac ventricle; the cAMP-specific PDE (PDE4) from human skeletal muscle; and the photoreceptor PDE (PDE6) from bovine retina. Phosphodiesterases 7-11 were generated from full length human recombinant clones transfected into SF9 cells.<br>
Assays were performed either using a modification of the. "batch" method of W.J. Thompson et al. (Biochem., 1979, 18, 5228) 'or using a<br>
-63-<br><br>
scintillation proximity assay for the direct detection of AMP/GMP using a modification of the protocol described by Amersham pic under product code TRKQ7090/7100.   In summary, the effect of PDE inhibitors was investigated by assaying a fixed amount of enzyme in the presence of varying inhibitor concentrations and low substrate, (cGMP or cAMP in a 3:1 ratio unlabelled to [3H]-labeled at a.cone -1/3 Km) such that IC50 = K,.  The final assay volume was made up to 100|il with assay buffer [20 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2,  1   mg/ml bovine serum  albumin].     Reactions were initiated with enzyme, incubated for 30-60 min at 30°C to give

Functional activity<br>
This was assessed in vitro by determining the capacity of a compound of the invention to enhance sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation of pre¬contracted rabbit corpus cavernosum tissue strips, as described by S.A. Ballard et al. (Brit. J. Pharmacol., 1996, H8 (suppl.), abstract 153P).<br>
In vivo activity<br>
Compounds were screened in anaesthetised dogs to determine their capacity, after i.v. administration, to enhance the pressure rises in the corpora cavernosa of the penis induced by intracavernosal injection of sodium nitroprusside, using a method based on that described by Trigo-Rocha et al. (Neurourol. and Urodyn., 1994, .13, 71).<br>
The compounds of formulae (I), (IA) or (1B), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and pharmaceutically acceptable solvates of either entity can  be  administered   alone   but,   in   human   therapy  will   generally   be administered in admixture with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient diluent or carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.  For example, the compounds of formulae (I), (IA) or (1B) or salts or solvates thereof can be administered orally, buccally or sublingually in the form of tablets, capsules (including soft gel capsules),  ovules,  elixirs,  solutions or suspensions,  which  may contain flavouring  or  colouring  agents,  for  immediate-,   delayed-,   modified-,   or controlled-release such as sustained-, dual-, or pulsatile delivery applications. The   compounds   of   the   invention   may   also    be    administered   via intracavernosal injection..     The compounds of the invention may also-be administered via fast dispersing or fast dissolving dosages forms or in the form  of  a  high  energy  dispersion  or  as  coated   particles.

Fast dispersing or dissolving dosage formulations. (FQDFs) may . contain the following ingredients: aspartame, acesulfame potassium, citric acid, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, diascorbic acid, ethyl acrylate, ethyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyp ropy! methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, methyl methacrylate, mint flavouring, polyethylene glycol, fumed silica, silicon dioxide, sodium starch glycolate, sodium stearyl fumarate, sorbitol, xylitol. The terms dispersing or dissolving as used herein to describe FDDFs are dependent upon the solubility of the drug substance used i.e. where the drug substance is insoluble a fast dispersing dosage form can be prepared and where the drug substance is soluble a fast dissolving dosage form can be prepared.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be administered parenterally, for example, intracavemosally, intravenously, intra-arterially, intraperitoneally, intrathecal^, intraventricular^, intraurethrally intrasternally, intracranially, intramuscularly or subcutaneously, or they may be administered by infusion or needless injection techniques. For such parenteral administration they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose' to make the solution isotonic with blood. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), if necessary. The preparation of suitable parenteral formulations under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the daily dosage level of the compounds of formula (I), (1A) or (1B) or salts or solvates, thereof will usually be from 10 to 500 mg (in single or divided doses).<br>
Thus, for example, tablets or capsules of the compounds of formulae<br>
(I), (IA) or (IB) or salts or solvates thereof may contain from 5	mg to.250<br>
mg of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a. time, as<br>
-67-<br><br>
appropriate. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage 'which willbe most suitable for any individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited and such are within the scope of this invention. The skilled person will also appreciate that, in the treatment of certain conditions (including MED and FSD), compounds of the invention may be taken as a single dose on an "as required" basis (i.e. as needed or desired).<br>

Such tablets can be manufactured by standard processes, for example, direct compression or a wet or dry granulation process. The tablet cores may be coated with appropriate overcoats.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation and are conveniently delivered in the form of a dry powder inhaler or an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurised container, pump, spray or nebuliser with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, a hydrofluoroalkane such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134A [trade mark] or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA 227EA [trade mark]), carbon dioxide or other suitable gas.    In the case of a pressurised aerosol, the<br>
-68-<br><br>
dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurised container, pump, spray or nebuliser may contain a, solution or suspension of the active compound, e.g. using a mixture of ethanol and the propellant as the solvent, which may additionally contain a lubricant, e.g. sorbitan trioleate. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of a compound of the formula (I), (IA) or (IB) and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
Aerosol or dry powder formulations are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or "puff contains from 1 to 50 mg of a compound of the formula (I), (IA) or (IB) for delivery to the patient. The overall daily dose with an aerosol will be in the range of from 1 to 50 mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, in divided doses throughout the day.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated for delivery via an atomiser. Formulations for atomiser devices may contain the following ingredients as solubilisers, emulsifiers or suspending agents: water, ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, low molecular weight polyethylene glycols, sodium chloride, fluorocarbons, polyethylene glycol ethers, sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the formulae (I), (IA) or (IB) or salts or solvates thereof can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a gel, hydrogel, lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. The compounds of the formulae (IA) and (IB) or salts or solvates thereof may also be dermally administered. The compounds of the formulae (I), (IA) or (IB) or salts or solvates thereof may also be transdermal^ administered, for examples by the use of a skin patch. They may also be administered by the ocular, pulmonary or rectal routes.<br>
For ophthalmic use, the compounds can be formulated as micronised suspensions  in  isotonic,  pH  adjusted,  sterile  saline,  or,  preferably,   as<br>
-69-<br><br>
solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, optionally in combination with a preservative such as a benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, they may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
For application topically to the skin, the compounds of the formulae (I), (IA) or (IB) or salts or solvates thereof can be formulated as a suitable ointment containing the.active compound suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture with one or more of the following: mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, they can be formulated as a suitable lotion or cream, suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture of one or more of the following: mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, a polyethylene glycol, liquid paraffin, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyIdodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.<br>
The compounds of the formulae (I), (IA) or (IB) may also be used in combination with a cyclodextrin. Cyclodextrins are known to form inclusion and non-inclusion complexes with drug molecules. Formation of a drug-cyclodextrin complex may modify the solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailability and/or stability property of a drug molecule. Drug-cyclodextrin complexes are generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, e.g. as a carrier, diluent or solubiliser. Alpha-, beta-and gamma-cyclodextrins are most commonly used and suitable examples are described in WO-A-91/11172, WO-A-94/02518 and WO-A-98/55148.<br>
Generally, in humans, oral administration of the compounds of the invention is the preferred route, being the most convenient and, for example in MED, avoiding the well-known disadvantages associated with intracavernosal (i.e.) administration. A preferred oral dosing regimen in MED for a typical man is from 5 to 250 mg of compound when required. In circumstances where the recipient suffers from a swallowing disorder or from<br>

Additionally, in accordance with the invention, the intermediate compounds (XIV) and (XB) (as illustrated in Schemes 2 and 3) can be prepared from commercially available starting materials (2-hydroxy nicotinic acid) in better yield than the corresponding reaction sequence in PCT/IB99/00519. For example, compound (XIV) (wherein Q and W are OEt) is formed in a yield of 14.5% in preparation 18 of PCT/IB99/00519 (i.e. from a reaction sequence of prepation 1,3,5,7 and. 18) whereas the same compound is prepared in a.yield of 23% in accordance with the present invention (see Preparation 95). More preferably the whole or part of the reaction sequence for the formation of compounds (XIV) and (XB) can be telescoped together in accordance with the invention to Drovide an even better yield.  Thus-compound (XB) (wherein<br>
'   -231-<br><br>
X is OEt) is prepared in a yield of 35% (see Preparation 95 herein). Furthermore, the. reaction scheme of the present invention is safer and cheaper to operate, and in the case of the telescoped process also involves less steps (and processing time).<br>
It will be appreciated that formation of compounds of formula (XB) and (XIV) from (XV) respectively is an independent invention and is preferably prepared from 2-hydroxynicotinic acid as outlined herein. Likewise each and every step (and telescoped step) in Schemes 2 and 3 are independent inventions, although in a preferred aspect compounds of formula (l),(IA) and (IB) are prepared from nicotinic acid in accordance with Schemes 2 and 3.<br>
