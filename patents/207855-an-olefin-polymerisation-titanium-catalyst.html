A process for the preparation of an olefin polymerisation titanium catalyst<br>

The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed  :<br><br>
390/mumnp/2004<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of an olefin polymerisation titanium catalyst '<br>
This invention also relates to a process for the polymerisation of an olefin with the titanium catalyst.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
Polymers of olefins especially lower olefins or a-alkenes such as ethylene, propylene or 1-butene are important materials because of their substantial commercial use in the manufacture of a variety of articles including plastic bags, sheets or automobile parts. The polymerisation of these alkenes has been widely practised for decades and involves the reaction of lower a-alkene such a ethylene with a catalyst under polymerisation conditions.<br>
In commercial lower a-alkene polymerisation, solid heterogeneous   catalysts   comprising   magnesium   dichloride   supported<br>
2<br><br>
titanium catalysts are predominantly used. One method for preparation of these catalysts comprises halogenation of an organo magnesium compound like magnesium alkoxide with or without titanium followed by treatment with titanium compound like titanium teterachloride. A second method for preparation of these catalysts involves reaction of magnesium dichloride and a titanium compound (US patents nos 4329253, 4393182, 4400302, 4414132, 4535068, 4330649, 4472521, 4540679, 4728705, 4710428, 5106806, 5122494 and 5281567). In the first method the halogenating agent usually used is titanium tetrachloride itself. Therefore, this method consumes considerably large amount of titanium tetrachloride based on the final titanium content in the catalysts and is not economical. Another disadvantage of use of organomagnesium compound like magnesium alkoxide is that during the catalyst synthesis species other than titanium tetrachloride is produced. For propylene polymerisation, this necessitates further treatment of the catalyst with a halogenating agent to achieve a desirable level of catalytic activity. Here again, the use of excess halogenating agent is not economical. In the second method special techniques like ball milling are used. Therefore, the catalyst formed is a physical mixture of titanium and magnesium compounds where the bonding between the particles may not be good thereby adversely affecting the<br>
3<br><br>
catalytic activity. While these disadvantages may be overcome by using activated anhydrous magnesium dichloride as starting material, in order to obtain catalysts of optimum particles size or morphology, additional preparative steps such as spray drying or melting are required, which make the process time consuming, inconvenient, and economical. US Patent No 4900706 discloses a catalyst comprising titanium, magnesium and chlorine deposited on an organic polymer support like styrene-divinyl benzene coplymer. However, in this case also because of the use of an organomagnesium precursor, a final treatment with titanium tetrachloride is required to give a catalytically active component.<br>
Various organic polymers have been used as support material for titanium or vanadium halide and aluminium alkyl based polymerisation catalysts. In USSR Author's Certificate No 682262 and Application No 2187995/23-04 being supplement thereto, non-metallocene catalysts based on titanium halides supported on polyethylene or polypropylene particles having substantially inert surfaces or copolymer of ethylene and vinyl alcohol having active surface hydroxyl groups are described. Both these support materials have been reported to show low activity or easy leaching of the catalyst. USSR Application No 1886351/23-04 describes use of<br>
4<br><br>
homopolymers of styrene and copolymers thereof with divinyl benzene as support for vanadium or titanium tetrahalide. The aromatic rings of the organic polymer are believed to reduce vanadium/titanium tetrahalide to a solid phase of the corresponding trihalide which remains trapped within the pores and on the surface of the support to provide an active catalyst. These supports are not suitable for use in the case of titanium and/or vanadium alkoxides and / or halo alkoxides. These compounds are reported to be active ethylene polymerisation catalysts (S M Pillai, M Ravindranathan and S Sivram, Chemical Review, 1986, 86, 353).<br>
Metallocene and other single site catalysts are highly selective and result in polymers of very narrow molecular weight distribution (J A Glaysz, Chemical Review, 2000, 100, 1167; H G Alt and A Koppl, Chemical Review, 2000, 100, 1205). During the synthesis of these catalysts, a thick polymer coating is reported to be formed on the polymerisation reactor wall and its stirrer which adversely affects the heat transfer characteristics of the catalytic system (H G Alt, J Chem. Soc, Dalton Trans, 1999, 1703). Besides, unless anchored on a solid support these catalysts cannot be efficiently used in a number of commercial reactors. To overcome the above drawbacks and also in an attempt to produce polymers with a<br>
5<br><br>
bimodal distribution of molecular weight as is usually desirable in the case of polyethylene catalyst comprising metallocenes or other single site catalysts and/or aluminoxane cocatalysts supported on an inorganic carrier like silica or an organic carrier like resinous polyethylene, polypropylene, crosslinked copolymer of divinyl benzene, styrene and acetoxy/hydroxy styrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyamide, polycarbonate, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer or polymethylmethacrylate have been developed (US Patents Nos 473268, 4808561, 4921825, 5362824 and 5461017 and G C Hlatky, Chemical Review, 2000, 100, 1347). These developments, however, are limited to metallocene and/or aluminoxane cocatalysts only.<br>
Particle size distribution of a solid catalyst used for ploymerisation determines the properties of the resultant polymer. Theses properties of the polymer in turn determine the throughput in the polymerisation plant as well as the ease with which the polymer is processed. Particle size distribution of a solid catalyst is therefore an important feature. However, in the above mentioned catalysts, one disadvantage is that, only by starting with a support or carrier material of<br>
6<br><br>
predefined particle size, the particle size of the support catalysts may be controlled.<br>

the preparation of this catalyst does away with special techniques like ball milling, spray drying or melting.

Besides, handling of the polysulfone in solution is easy and convenient. The process of the invention is very simple, less time consuming and convenient to carry out for the above reasons. The invention is also economical for the above reasons. Due to the high activity of the catalyst polymerisation efficiency is increased.<br>
