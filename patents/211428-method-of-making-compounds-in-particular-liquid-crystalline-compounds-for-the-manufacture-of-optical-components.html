METHOD OF MAKING COMPOUNDS, IN PARTICULAR LIQUID CRYSTALLINE COMPOUNDS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF OPTICAL COMPONENTS;<br>
ROLIC AG, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED     AND   EXISTING   UNDER   THE   LAWS   OF SWITZERLAND,    WHOSE    ADDRESS     IS CHAMERSTRASSE       50,       6301        ZUG, SWITZERLAND.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
Liquid crystalline compounds<br>
The invention relates to new liquid crystalline compounds, mixtures of those compounds and their application in optical devices. More particularly, it relates to the use of a component of a polymerisable liquid crystalline mixture in the production of orientated liquid crystalline polymers; compounds used as components in polymer¬isable liquid crystalline mixtures; liquid crystalline mixtures comprising these components, liquid crystalline polymers prepared from such components; and liquid crystalline devices comprising those compounds.<br>
Liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) are used in the manufacture of optical components such as waveguides, optical gratings, filters, retarders, piezoelectric cells and non-linear optical cells and films. The choice of LCP for use in any one of the aforementioned optical components depends upon its associated optical properties such as the optical anisotropy, refractive index, transparency and dispersion. Optical filters, for example, contain LCPs having a large anisotropy (An) and a low dispersion (n =<br><br>
In some applications there is a requirement to produce LCPs in which the component molecules adopt a specific tilt angle or orientation with respect to the plane of the substrate or to a plane perpendicular to the substrate. These LCP materials can be used as optical components such as compensation layers and retarders. Such optical components may be used in the production of liquid crystal devices (LCDs) with improved viewing angles, for example.<br>
LCPs are manufactured by orientating a layer of a polymerisable liquid crystal single compound or mixture on an orientated substrate and cross-linking the mesogenic layer to form a liquid crystal polymer (LCP) network. Polymerisable LC compounds used in the manufacture of the LCPs need to be chemically and thermally stable, stable to electromagnetic radiation, soluble in standard solvents and miscible with other LC components, and to exhibit liquid crystalline properties over the range 25 to 150 °C,<br><br>
preferably 25 to 80 °C. The configuration imposed by the orientation layer on the polymerisable LC single compound or mixture becomes fixed or frozen into the LCP network formed upon cross-linking. The resulting LCP films have a high viscosity and are stable to mechanical stresses, temperature and light exposure.<br>
There is therefore a need for a liquid crystalline single compound or mixture which exhibits a broad liquid-crystalline thermal range and which can be orientated on a substrate prior to cross-linking in such a way that the orientation of the LC single compound or mixture on the substrate remains stable over the period required for manufacturing the LCP network. Components which may be used in photo--crosslinkable liquid crystalline layers are particularly desirable.<br>
Compounds known from the prior art include those disclosed in EP-A-0675186, EP-A-0700981 and EP-A-0748852 (all F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG). The three earlier documents disclose compounds such as (taken from EP-A-0675186):<br><br>
O	&gt;=0	°<br><br>
US 3971824 (Van Meter et al. / Eastman Kodak Company) discloses in its broadest 20    aspect compounds of the following formula:<br><br><br>
X<br>
where X is chlorine.<br>
Previous strategies used for obtaining the desired thermal and optical properties with a given LCP material have mainly relied upon mixtures of compounds comprising at least one liquid crystalline polymerisable monomer and the combination of their individual properties. However due to the general incompatibility of the latter components at the molecular scale, the thermodynamic behaviour of their corresponding mixtures is generally undesirable (for example, a depression of the clearing point, a reduction of the liquid crystalline range etc.), besides some problems of miscibility between the different components of the mixture leading to difficulties in achieving a uniform orientation of the LCP material. To ameliorate this situation, a new concept of obtaining LCP materials of special thermal and optical properties was investigated. This concept uses chemical junctions at lateral positions of different molecules, at least one of them being mesogenic, having each one or more of the properties which are required in the final LCP material. Depending on the application, these properties can be selectively induced from at least one of the mesogenic stairs of the new "staircase molecules".<br>
Thus the invention provides chiral or achiral "staircase" compounds of formula I:<br><br><br><br>
wherein:<br>
A1 to A6	each independently represent hydrogen; an optionally-substituted<br>
methyl group; or an optionally-substituted hydrocarbon group of 2 to 80 C-atoms, in which one or more C-atoms may be replaced by a heteroatom, in such a way that oxygen atoms are not linked to one another;<br>
B1 and B2	each independently represent a single bond, an oxygen atom or<br>
an optionally-substituted hydrocarbon group of 1 to 80 C-atoms, in which one or more C-atoms may be replaced by a heteroatom, in such a way that oxygen atoms are not linked to one another;<br>
MG1 and MG3	each independently represent an optionally-substituted aliphatic<br>
group with 1 to 80 C-atoms, in which one or more C-atoms may be replaced by a heteroatom, in such a way that oxygen atoms are not linked to one another; or an optionally-substituted aromatic or non-aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system, with 1 to 80 C-atoms;<br>
MG2	represents a group comprising at least two and up to four<br>
optionally-substituted aromatic or non-aromatic carbocyciic or heterocyclic ring systems, with 1 to 80 C-atoms, wherein, when MG2 represents a group comprising four optionally-substituted ring systems, at least three of the ring systems are aligned in between B! and B";<br><br>
nl and n2	are each independently 1 or 2, where "nl = 2" (or "n2 = 2")<br>
indicates the presence of two separate linkages via the groups B1 (or the groups B~) between the groups MG1 and MG2 (or MG2 and MG3); and<br>
n3	is a positive integer up to 1000;<br>
with the proviso that:<br>
when. A3 and A4 both represent hydrogen, then both MG1 and MG represent an araliphatic group with 1 to 80 C-atoms, in which one or more C-atoms may be replaced by a heteroatom, or an optionally-substituted aromatic or non-aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system, with 1 to 80 C-atoms; and at least two of A , A, A and A -each independently represent an optionally-substituted hydrocarbon group of 3 to 80 C-atoms, in which one or more C-atoms may be replaced by a heteroatom;<br>
when A1, A2, A5 and A6 all represent hydrogen, then A3 and A4 both represent an optionally-substituted hydrocarbon group of 3 to 80 C-atoms, in which one or more C-atoms may be replaced by a heteroatom; and<br><br>
optionally-substituted ring systems, then neither of A3 and A4<br>
when  MG"   represents   a   group   comprising   two   or   three optionally-substituted rinj includes an aromatic ring.<br><br>
The term "aliphatic" includes straight-chain and branched alkylene, as well as saturated and unsaturated groups. Possible substituents include alkyl, aryl (thus giving an araliphatic group) and cycloalkyl, as well as amino, cyano, epoxy, halogen, hydroxy, nitro, oxo etc. Possible heteroatoms which may replace carbon atoms include<br><br>
nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur. In the case of nitrogen further substitution is possible with groups such as alkyl, aryl and cycloalkyl. Likewise, the terms "alkyl" and "alkylene", as used herein, includes straight-chain and branched groups, as well as saturated and unsaturated groups.<br>
When MG2 represents a group comprising four optionally-substituted ring systems, at least three of the ring systems are aligned in between B1 and B2. Thus, at least three of the rings are all in a discrete identifiable block positioned in between B and B , not in an arbitrarily defined region with some of the rings protruding from the axis of the molecule connecting B1 with B2. Comparison may be made with compounds such as Compound I-a of EP-A-0675186:<br><br>
When MG2 represents a group comprising two or three optionally-substituted ring systems, then neither of A and A includes an aromatic ring. This again makes it clear that with compounds such as Compound I-a of US 5567349 fall outside the scope of the present invention. It is not possible to produce the present invention by arbitrarily labelling parts of molecules known from the prior art.<br><br>
The groups MG1, MG2 and MG3 in the new "stairc&amp;se molecules" may be selected so that each has one OT more of the properties which are Teqaiicu in 1he fma^ LCP material. To an expert in liquid crystals, the molecular architecture of compounds of formula I would not have been thought to be favourable for obtaining a liquid crystalline mesophase, because a bulky substituent at a position lateral to a mesogenic core would have been thought to cause a loss of mesogenic character. However we have now discovered that the compounds of formula I were surprisingly found to be liquid crystalline over a broad thermal range. Besides, they are suitable for producing a ; I"    high tilt and high optical birefringence together with well oriented LCP films.<br>
MG" may be either a mesogenic group or otherwise.<br>
It is advantageous for the liquid crystalline compounds to be photo-crossIinkabJe, so that for example they may be used in a crosslinked state in optical devices. Thus preferably at least one of A1 to A6 includes a polymerisable group. In such a case, when A3 and A4 both represent hydrogen then at least one of A , A , A5 and A6 would include a polymerisable group; whereas when A1, A2, A3 and A all represent hydrogen then at least one of AJ and A4 would include a polymerisable group.<br>
