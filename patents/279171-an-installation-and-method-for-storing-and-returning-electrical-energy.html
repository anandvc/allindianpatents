				<td>AN INSTALLATION AND METHOD FOR STORING AND RETURNING<br>
ELECTRICAL ENERGY<br>
The present invention relates to an installation for<br>
storing and returning electrical energy that is suitable<br>
for storing several tens, or even several thousands of<br>
megawatt hours (MWh), and it also relates to methods of<br>
storing electrical energy in the form of heat energy in<br>
which use is made of an installation of the invention,<br>
and a method of returning electrical energy from heat<br>
energy stored by a method of the invention.<br>
The present invention relates to storing energy at<br>
high temperature and more particularly to storing<br>
electrical energy in order to return it over the<br>
electricity network during peaks of consumption.<br>
Electricity is generally produced by power stations<br>
using a variety of fuels for producing the energy, such<br>
as gas, oil, coal, or lignite. Another means consists in<br>
using nuclear fuel to produce the heat that is then<br>
transformed into electrical energy in high pressure steam<br>
turbines.<br>
Renewable energies are also known that contribute to<br>
a greatly varying extent to the production of electricity<br>
in various countries. Mention can be made, amongst other<br>
possibilities of: hydraulic energy from dams, wind<br>
turbines, water turbines that take energy from sea<br>
currents, and various devices that recover energy from<br>
the swell of the sea, or indeed from solar energy.<br>
Although installations that produce electricity from<br>
fuel or from water retained by dams can operate<br>
continuously at nominal or maximum power during very long<br>
periods, renewable energies are characterized by<br>
operation that is intermittent, and incorporating<br>
renewable energy in a network generally serves to off-<br>
load only a fraction of conventional power stations, some<br>
of which can then be run at low power or even merely<br>
stopped, while waiting for a power demand from the<br>
network.<br>
Various techniques are known that use turbines to<br>
produce mechanical energy from fuels, such as gas or oil,<br>
which consist in compressing an oxidizer, generally air,<br>
then mixing it with a fuel and causing it to burn in a<br>
combustion chamber, and finally directing it towards an<br>
expansion turbine in order to recover the mechanical<br>
energy that is produced, the compressor and the expansion<br>
turbine generally being mounted in line on a common<br>
shaft. In that type of rotary machine, maximum efficiency<br>
is sought, where maximum efficiency is a function of the<br>
inlet temperature to the expansion turbine. The limits on<br>
operating temperature are due to the temperature behavior<br>
of the blades in the expansion turbine, given the very<br>
aggressive nature of combustion gas at very high<br>
temperature, combustion gas generally being made up of<br>
CO2, of NOx, and of other compounds that are aggressive<br>
for the alloys used for making the blades of the turbine.<br>
Steam turbines are also known that are used in<br>
nuclear power stations for converting the energy of water<br>
that has been taken to very high temperature in the form<br>
of steam, firstly into mechanical energy, and then into<br>
electrical energy within generators that are coupled to<br>
the end of the steam turbine shaft. Such steam turbines<br>
operate in a closed circuit for the heat-conveying fluid,<br>
water in the steam phase upstream from the turbine and<br>
liquid water downstream from said turbine.<br>
Attempts have been made for a long time to store<br>
energy so as to have energy available almost<br>
instantaneously during consumption peaks. Numerous<br>
techniques have been developed, and mention can be made,<br>
amongst others, of electrical storage batteries,<br>
generally lead-acid batteries, or pumping water up to a<br>
dam at altitude, for the purpose of driving turbines<br>
during peaks in energy demand.<br>
Storing energy in lead-acid batteries is a valid<br>
technique for small and medium capacities, but when it is<br>
necessary to store the equivalent of a nuclear power<br>
station unit, i.e. about 1200 megawatts (MW) over periods<br>
of 24 hours (h) or 36 h, the installations required<br>
become gigantic and completely unrealistic.<br>
Although dams constitute an excellent means for<br>
storing energy, suitable sites are unfortunately limited<br>
in number, and in addition storing very large quantities<br>
of energy requires enormous quantities of water to be<br>
mobilized, which quantities then need to be taken from<br>
the quantities that are available, and subsequently they<br>
need to be released during periods when there is no need<br>
for such quantities of water, e.g. for irrigation, in<br>
which case the water is then more or less wasted.<br>
Nevertheless, several sites comprise a high reservoir and<br>
a low reservoir, generally large-capacity lakes, and when<br>
storing energy, the content of the low lake is pumped up<br>
to the high lake, to be available for driving a turbine<br>
in the opposite direction when consumption peaks require<br>
additional power to be delivered to the electricity<br>
network.<br>
Another technique consists in storing energy in the<br>
form of compressed air, and then retransforming it into<br>
mechanical energy by piston engines, vane motors, or<br>
indeed turbines.<br>
Patent WO 2005/108758 describes a technique of<br>
storing energy in the form of heat in an underground<br>
enclosure, the heat being generated by compressing air<br>
that is initially at atmospheric pressure and at ambient<br>
temperature, with the temperature within the underground<br>
storage being about 700°C. In that application, the gas,<br>
i.e. air, flows in an open circuit from the free<br>
atmosphere into the cavern during the storage stage, and<br>
then from the cavern to the free atmosphere during the<br>
energy return stage.<br>
In another technical field, regenerators are<br>
commonly employed in industries that use fire, i.e. with<br>
blast furnaces, in the ceramics and terra cotta<br>
industries, in the glass-making and cement-making<br>
industries, which regenerators consist in sending hot<br>
burnt gas into large towers to heat refractory masses<br>
contained therein so as to recover the heat from the gas,<br>
before releasing said gas into the atmosphere. When the<br>
maximum temperature is reached within the refractory<br>
materials, the flow of hot gas is stopped and a reverse<br>
flow of cool air is passed through, which air becomes<br>
heated on making contact with the refractory materials<br>
prior to being directed to the inlets of furnaces, or to<br>
burners. Those arrangements enable heat losses within<br>
industrial processes that consume large amounts of energy<br>
to be reduced very significantly.<br>
The problem posed is to store electrical energy from<br>
conventional power stations, such as coal, gas, oil, or<br>
indeed nuclear power stations, in order to be able to<br>
return the energy very quickly in large quantities to the<br>
electricity network during peak periods when energy<br>
demand exceeds production capacity.<br>
Likewise, with renewable energies, such as wind<br>
turbines or sea water turbines, the problem is to be able<br>
to store large quantities of energy during periods of<br>
strong wind or current, said energy corresponding to<br>
surplus production, in order to return said energy during<br>
a stage in which production is insufficient, i.e. when<br>
the wind or the current does not enable the energy<br>
production level to be maintained at a minimum threshold.<br>
To do this, the present invention consists<br>
essentially in storing considerable quantities of<br>
electrical energy in the form of heat within masses of<br>
refractory materials, the fluid that enables energy to be<br>
transferred being a gas, preferably an inert gas such as<br>
argon, and then to return said stored thermal potential<br>
energy in the form of electrical energy.<br>
More precisely, the present invention provides an<br>
installation for storing and returning electrical energy,<br>
the installation being characterized in that it<br>
comprises :<br>
• first and second enclosures containing a gas and<br>
first and second porous refractory materials suitable for<br>
transferring heat by contact between said porous<br>
refractory materials and a gas flowing through said<br>
enclosures; and<br>
• a closed circuit of pipes enabling a gas to pass<br>
successively through each of the two enclosures from one<br>
end to the other; and<br>

between each of the ends of an enclosure connected to an<br>

heating the gas flowing in said second enclosure; and<br>
• also preferably, cooler means for cooling the gas<br>
flowing between one of the ends of the first enclosure<br>
and said compressor means and expander means, suitable<br>
for cooling the gas leaving said first enclosure at said<br>
end prior to being expanded in said expander means, or<br>
respectively the gas entering into said first enclosure<br>
after being compressed by said compressor means.<br>
It will be understood that the two said nth top (or<br>
bottom) pipes may either be two parallel pipes providing<br>
a junction between said turbine/compressor and a single<br>
enclosure or one of the two includes a branch pipe from<br>
the other ahead of said turbine/compressor.<br>
More particularly, according to the invention, an<br>
installation for storing and returning electrical energy<br>
comprises:<br>

porous refractory material suitable for passing a gas<br>
flowing through said first enclosure between top and<br>
bottom ends of said first enclosure; and<br>
B) a second lagged enclosure filled with a second<br>
porous refractory material suitable for passing a gas<br>
flowing through said second enclosure between top and<br>
bottom ends of said second enclosure; and<br>
C) lagged pipes enabling the gas to flow in a closed<br>
circuit between the two enclosures, the pipes comprising<br>
first and second top pipes between the top ends of the<br>
two enclosures, and first and second bottom pipes between<br>
the bottom ends of the two enclosures; and<br>
D) preferably, first gas heater means suitable for<br>
heating a gas inside said second enclosure; and<br>
E) first gas compressor means comprising an electric<br>
motor suitable for being fed with electrical energy for<br>
storing to actuate a first compressor suitable for<br>
compressincf a gas coming from said top end of the second<br>
enclosure via a said second top pipe to deliver it to<br>
said top end of the first enclosure via a said first top<br>
pipe; and<br>
F) first gas expander means comprising a first<br>
turbine suitable for expanding the gas coming from said<br>
bottom end of the first enclosure via a first bottom pipe<br>
to deliver it to said bottom end of the second enclosure<br>
via second bottom pipe; and<br>

another first bottom pipe; and<br>
H) second gas expander means comprising a second<br>

for returning the electrical energy; and<br>
I) gas cooler means, preferably a heat exchanger<br>

Preferably, the electrical energy storage and return<br>
installation of the invention includes second gas heater<br>

• said second compressor is actuated by said second<br>
turbine to which it is mechanically coupled.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the installation of the<br>

As explained below, argon gas is advantageous since<br>
it is a gas that is permanent and inert, i.e. it does not<br>
corrode the pipework, and it is a monatomic gas that<br>
presents the advantage of heating easily, and thus a<br>
limited compression ratio, and it is of low cost given<br>
its abundance.<br>
In particular embodiments, the installation presents<br>
the characteristics whereby:<br>
• said first enclosure and the first porous<br>
refractory material are capable of withstanding a<br>

temperature T3 in the range -80°C to -20°C;<br>
• said second enclosure and second porous refractory<br>
material are capable of withstanding a temperature T2 of<br>
at least 400°C, preferably lying in the range 400°C to<br>
1000°C, more preferably 500°C to 700°C; and<br>
• said first compressor is dimensioned to compress a<br>
gas at said temperature T2, while said second compressor,<br>
of smaller capacity than the first compressor, is<br>
dimensioned to compress the gas at a temperature T3 in<br>
the range -80°C to -20°C to ambient temperature.<br>
Still more particularly, said first compressor is<br>
suitable for delivering at a volume flow rate greater<br>
than said first turbine, and said second turbine is<br>
suitable for delivering a volume flow rate greater than<br>
said second compressor, and said first compressor and<br>
second turbine are made of carbon.<br>
Preferably, said refractory materials present an<br>
intrinsic heat capacity per unit volume of at least<br>
2000 kilojoules per cubic meter per kelvin (kJ.m"'. K^M ,<br>
and more preferably at least 2800 kJ.m"^.K-'.<br>
Advantageously, said first and second porous<br>
refractory materials present porosities lying in the<br>
range 20% to 60%.<br>
More particularly, said first and second porous<br>
refractory materials are constituted by porous bricks<br>
assembled one against another, preferably having<br>
cylindrical perforations passing therethrough that are<br>
disposed parallel in a common longitudinal direction that<br>
is the longitudinal direction of the enclosure in which<br>
they are assembled, said perforations more preferably<br>
being of a diameter in the range 5 millimeters (mm) to<br>
20 mm.<br>
In particular embodiments, said first and second<br>
porous refractory materials are constituted by fire clay<br>
having high contents of compounds selected from magnesia,<br>
alumina, and lime.<br>
Refractory materials that may be mentioned are<br>
chamotte, magnesia, dolomite, mullite, and also carbon.<br>
More particularly, said first porous refractory<br>
material is constituted by second-firing fire clay or<br>
chamotte, and said second porous refractory material is<br>
constituted by first firing fire clay.<br>
In a particular embodiment, said first and second<br>
enclosures have respective volumes of not less than 5000<br>
cubic meters (m3), and preferably lying in the range<br>
10,000 m3 to 45,000 m3.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of<br>
storing electrical energy in the form of heat energy, in<br>
which an installation of the invention is used, the<br>
method being characterized in that, after an initial step<br>
of preheating the gas of said second enclosure that is<br>
heated to a temperature Tj, said installation being filled<br>
with a permanent gas that is initially at ambient<br>
temperature T0, the following successive steps are<br>
performed:<br>
1) the gas leaving the top end of the second<br>
enclosure at a temperature T2 is heated to a temperature<br>
T1 higher than a temperature T2 by being compressed in a<br>
said first compressor before being delivered to the top<br>
end of said first enclosure, in which a pressure PI is<br>
established higher than the pressure P2 of the second<br>
enclosure, said first compressor being driven by a first<br>
electric motor powered by the electrical energy that is<br>
to be stored; and<br>
2) the gas passes right through said first enclosure<br>
between said top end and its said bottom end, and it<br>
leaves said bottom end of the first enclosure at an<br>
ambient temperature TO or a temperature T'l greater than<br>
TO but less than T2; and<br>
3) the gas is then cooled, where appropriate, to an<br>
ambient temperature TO by said gas cooler means,<br>
preferably of the heat exchanger type, located downstream<br>
from the outlet of the bottom end of the first enclosure;<br>
and<br>
4) the gas is then expanded through a said first<br>
turbine, preferably driven by said first compressor, to<br>
said pressure P2 of the second enclosure that is lower<br>
than the pressure PI, the gas thus being cooled to a<br>
temperature T3 lower than TO prior to entering into said<br>
second enclosure via its bottom end; and<br>
5) the gas is caused to flow through said second<br>
enclosure between said bottom and top ends of the second<br>
enclosure, thereby having the effect of increasing the<br>
volume of the refractory material in the bottom portion<br>
of said second enclosure that is cooled to the<br>
temperature T3, and of decreasing the volume of its top<br>
portion that is at the temperature T2 or T'2 lower than<br>
T2 but greater than TO and T'l, and if necessary, where<br>
appropriate, the gas leaving the second enclosure at the<br>
temperature T'2 is heated to the temperature T2 with the<br>
help of second gas heater means; and<br>
6) above steps 1) to 5) are repeated until the top<br>
portion of the first enclosure heated to the temperature<br>
Tl occupies at least 80% of the volume of said first<br>
enclosure, and the bottom portion of the second enclosure<br>
cools to a temperature T3 occupying at least 80% of the<br>
volume of the second enclosure.<br>
It will be understood that at each step 2) when the<br>
gas reacheis the temperature Tl at the top end of the<br>
first enclosure, which is initially entirely at the<br>
temperature TO, and the gas moves down from the top end<br>
towards the bottom end of the first enclosure, the gas<br>
passing through said first porous refractory material has<br>
the effect of the gas delivering heat to said first<br>
refractory material in the top portion of the first<br>
enclosure, which then becomes heated to the temperature<br>
Tl, while its bottom portion that is not heated or that<br>
is heated to a smaller extent is at a temperature T'l<br>
lying in the range TO to Tl, and in practice in the range<br>
TO to T2. As the gas that circulates in a closed loop<br>
continues to pass through, the front, or rather the<br>
thermal transition layer, between the hot top portion and<br>
the cold bottom portion in the first enclosure moves<br>
downwards, and the top portion at the temperature Tl<br>
occupies an ever increasing volume. In parallel, in step<br>
5), the gas penetrates into the bottom of the second<br>
enclosure at a cold temperature T3, thereby having the<br>
effect of extracting heat from said second porous<br>
refractory material and thus cooling the bottom portion<br>
of the second enclosure which passes from the temperature<br>
T2 to the temperature T3. As the gas continues to pass,<br>
the front, or rather the thermal transition layer,<br>
between the hot top portion and the cold bottom portion<br>
of the second enclosure progresses upwards and the bottom<br>
portion at the temperature T3 occupies an ever increasing<br>
volume.<br>
The electrical energy El used to feed the first<br>
compressor with energy is thus stored in the form of<br>
(hot) thermal energy (calories) in the first enclosure<br>
and in the form of (cold) thermal energy (frigories) in<br>
the second enclosure, with this energy depending on the<br>
gradient T1-T3.<br>
Preferably, storage is interrupted so that the<br>
bottom portion of the first enclosure at said temperature<br>
T'l represents at least 10% of the volume of the first<br>
enclosure, preferably 10% to 20% of the volume of the<br>
first enclosure, and/or the top portion of the second<br>
enclosure at the temperature T2 represents less than 20%,<br>
preferably 10% to 20% of the volume of said second<br>
enclosure.<br>
According to other particular characteristics of the<br>
present invention that are advantageous, said refractory<br>
materials used have the following properties and masses:<br>
• said temperatures Tl and T2 are such that<br>
Tl/Tl = 1.5 to 3 and Tl/TO is greater than 2, preferably<br>
greater than 3, and more preferably less than 6, and<br>
P1/P2 lies in the range 2 to 4; and<br>
• Tl is 750°C to 2000°C, preferably 1000°C to<br>
1500°C, and T2 is 400°C to 1000°C, preferably 500°C to<br>
700°C; and<br>
• the pressure PI lies in the range 2 to 4 bars<br>
absolute (2x10^ Pa to 4x10^ Pa), and the pressure P2 lies<br>
in the range 0.5 to 1.5 bars absolute (0.5x10^ Pa to<br>
1.5X105 Pa); and<br>
• TO lies in the range 10°C to 50°C and T3 lies in<br>
the range -80°C to -20°C, Tl' lying in the range 20°C to<br>
150°C, where appropriate. Advantageously, a quantity of<br>
electrical energy is stored which lies in the range<br>
2 0 MWh to 10,00 0 MWh.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of<br>
returning electrical energy from heat energy stored by a<br>
method of the invention as defined above, the method<br>
being characterized in that, after an initial starting<br>
stage in which said second compressor and said second<br>
turbine are driven by the said auxiliary electric motor,<br>
during which initial stage a pressure gradient is<br>
established between the pressure P'l in the first<br>
enclosure and a pressure P'2 less P'l in the second<br>
enclosure, such that P'l is greater than P'2, P'l<br>
preferably being greater than PI and P'2 preferably being<br>
less than P2, the following successive steps are<br>
performed:<br>
1) the gas leaving via the top end of the first<br>
enclosure at said temperature Tl is expanded and cooled<br>
to the temperature T2 through the second turbine, and<br>
said second turbine actuates a said electricity generator<br>
enabling returned electrical energy to be delivered; and<br>
2) the gas passes through said second enclosure from<br>
its top end to its bottom end, a top portion of the<br>
second enclosure being heated to said temperature T2, a<br>
bottom portion of the second enclosure remaining at said<br>
temperature T3; and<br>
3) the gas leaving the bottom end of said second<br>
enclosure at the temperature T3 is then compressed by<br>
passing through said second compressor that is preferably<br>
actuated by the energy released by the second turbine so<br>
as to be heated to a temperature T4 greater than an<br>
ambient temperature TO and where appropriate greater than<br>
T'l, but less than T2, at the outlet from said second<br>
compressor; and<br>
4) preferably, the gas is then cooled to the ambient<br>
temperature TO or T'l by said cooler means prior to being<br>
introduced into said first enclosure by its bottom end<br>
(12) to enter the bottom portion of said first enclosure<br>
which is at said temperature T'l; and<br>
5) the gas is caused to flow through said first<br>
enclosure, thereby having the effect of increasing the<br>
volume of refractory material in the bottom portion that<br>
is at said temperature T'l and of decreasing the volume<br>
of refractory material in the top portion that is at said<br>
hot temperature Tl; and<br>
6) above steps 1) to 5) are repeated until the<br>
bottom portion of the first enclosure at said temperature<br>
Tl represents at least 80% of the volume of the first<br>
enclosure, and the top portion of said second enclosure<br>
at said temperature T2 represents at least 80% of the<br>
volume of said second enclosure.<br>
It will be understood that in order to maintain in<br>
the enclosures the same temperatures Tl and T2 as in the<br>
energy storage method of the invention, it is necessary,<br>
in the initial step, to establish a pressure gradient<br>
between the two enclosures that is greater than the<br>
pressure gradient between the enclosures during the<br>
storage method of the invention.<br>
It will be understood that at each step 2), when the<br>
gas reaches the temperature T2 at the top end of the<br>
second enclosure, which is initially not more than 20% at<br>
the temperature T2 or T'2 less than T2, and the gas moves<br>
down from the top end towards the bottom end of the<br>
second enclosure, the passage of the gas through said<br>
second porous refractory material has the effect of the<br>
gas delivering heat to said second refractory material in<br>
the top portion of the second enclosure, which thus<br>
becomes heated to the temperature T2, while its non-<br>
heated bottom portion remains at the temperature T3. As<br>
the gas continues to pass through, the front, or rather<br>
the thermal transition layer, between the hot top portion<br>
and the cold bottom portion of the second enclosure moves<br>
downwards and the bottom portion at the temperature T3<br>
occupies an ever decreasing volume. In parallel, in step<br>
5), the gas arrives at ambient temperature TO or at a<br>
temperature T'l in the bottom of the first enclosure,<br>
thereby cooling said first porous refractory material and<br>
thus cooling the bottom portion of the first enclosure<br>
which goes from the temperature Tl to the temperature<br>
T'l. As the gas continues to pass through, the front, or<br>
rather the thermal transition layer, between the hot top<br>
portion and the cold bottom portion of the first<br>
enclosure moves upwards and the top portion at the<br>
temperature Tl occupies an ever decreasing volume.<br>
The electrical energy E1 stored in the form of (hot)<br>
thermal energy (calories) in the first enclosure and<br>
(cold) thermal energy (frigories) in the second enclosure<br>
is thus converted into electrical energy ER from the<br>
mechanical energy released by said second turbine used<br>
during expansion and cooling of the gas from the first<br>
enclosure.<br>
Preferably, in step 6), the energy return method is<br>
interrupted so as to maintain a top portion of the first<br>
enclosure at a said temperature Tl, said top portion<br>
representing less than 20%, preferably 10% to 20% of the<br>
volume of said first enclosure, and/or a bottom portion<br>
of the second enclosure at said cold temperature T3<br>
represents less than 20%, preferably 10% to 20%, of the<br>
volume of the second enclosure.<br>
Advantageously, the efficiency E^/E^ with which<br>
electrical energy is returned by said electricity<br>
generator is greater than 60%, and preferably lies in the<br>
range 75% to 85%.<br>
According to other characteristics that are<br>
advantageous of the method of returning electrical energy<br>
of the invention:<br>
• the ratio P'l/P'2 lies in the range 3 to 5; and<br>
• T4 lies in the range 150°C to 400°C; and<br>
• the pressure P'l lies in the range 3 to 5 bars<br>
absolute (2X105 Pa to 4x105 Pa) and P'2 lies in the range<br>
1 to 1.5 bars absolute (1x105 Pa to LSx105 Pa).<br>

The device of the invention for storing electrical<br>
energy and for returning electrical energy comprises:<br>
• a first lagged enclosure 1 comprising a steel wall<br>
that is 10 mm to 100 mm thick and that is filled with a<br>
first porous refractory material capable of withstanding<br>
high temperatures and pressures of an inert gas contained<br>
therein, at a temperature Tl lying in the range 1000°C to<br>
1600°C, and more particularly of 13Q0°C, and at a<br>
pressure PI lying in the range 2 bars absolute (bara) to<br>
5 bara (i.e. lying in the range 2x105 pascals (Pa) to<br>
5X105 Pa); and<br>
• a second lagged enclosure 2 having the same<br>
volume, e.g. lying in the range 10,000 m3 to 15,000 m3,<br>
having a steel wall of thickness lying in the range 10 mm<br>
to 100 mm and filled with a second porous refractory<br>
material capable of withstanding the temperature 72 and<br>
the pressure P2 of the inert gas it contains, i.e. T2<br>
lying in the range 500°C to 700°C, and more particularly<br>
being about 6 00°C.<br>
Said first and second enclosures 1 and 2 are<br>
substantially entirely filled with a porous refractory<br>
material 11 having high calorific volume as described<br>
above.<br>
The device includes ducts for closed-circuit<br>
circulation between said first and second enclosures 1<br>
and 2 so as to enable the gas contained in the<br>
installation to pass through each of the enclosures<br>
between two opposite ends 11-l2 and 22-22 thereof that are<br>
preferably situated respectively at the top and bottom<br>
ends of said enclosures.<br>
The circulation ducts between the first and second<br>
enclosures also include means for compressing/expanding<br>
the gas between the two enclosures, as explained below.<br>
More particularly, said first and second enclosures<br>
are disposed vertically.<br>
In Figures 1 and 2, the first enclosure 1 has a top<br>
duct 1d at its top end 11, opening out into the top<br>
portion la of the first enclosure, and at its bottom end<br>
12 it has a first bottom duct Ic opening out into the<br>
bottom portion lb of the first enclosure 1.<br>
Similarly, the second enclosure 2 has a second top<br>
duct 2d at its top end 21 opening out into the top portion<br>
2a of the second enclosure 2, and a second bottom duct 2c<br>
at its bottom end 22 opening out into the bottom portion<br>
2b of the second enclosure 2.<br>
Said first and second bottom ducts 1c, 2c and top<br>
ducts 1d, 2d are likewise lagged.<br>
Said second enclosure 2 is coupled to a first heater<br>
5a, preferably a heater comprising an electrical<br>
resistance 5a1 and a closed circuit of heater piping 5a3<br>
between two ends of the second enclosure, the gas flowing<br>
in the heater piping ba3 being heated by said first heater<br>
5a.<br>
A first compression/expansion group 3 is interposed<br>
between said first and second enclosures 1 and 2. This<br>
first compression/expansion group 3 comprises an electric<br>
motor 3a powered by electricity E1 and serving to actuate<br>
a first dynamic compressor 3d of the axial or centrifugal<br>
type, and a first gas turbine 3c, itself coupled to said<br>
first compressor 3b, their respective shafts being<br>
coupled to one another, as explained below.<br>
Said first compressor 3b is connected at its outlet<br>
to the top end 11 of the first enclosure 1 via said first<br>
top pipe 1d, and said first compressor 3b is connected at<br>
its inlet to the top end 21 of said second enclosure 2 via<br>
said second top pipe 2d. Said second top pipe 2d<br>
constitutes the feed pipe of the first compressor 3b and<br>
said first top pipe 1d constitutes the gas exhaust pipe<br>
from the first compressor 3b after compression during a<br>
storage cycle, as explained below.<br>
A second heater 5b, preferably comprising a second<br>
electrical resistance 5a2, co-operates with said second<br>
top pipe 2d, said second heater 5b being interposed<br>
between the top end 21 of the second enclosure 2 and the<br>
inlet of the first compressor 3b.<br>
Said first turbine 3c is connected to the top end 12<br>
of said first enclosure 1 via said first bottom pipe 1c,<br>
and said first turbine 3c is connected to the bottom end<br>
22 of said second enclosure 2 via said second bottom pipe<br>
2c. Said first bottom pipe 1c serves to feed said first<br>
turbine 3c with gas exhausted from the bottom portion lb<br>
of the first enclosure 1, and the gas exhausted from said<br>
first turbine 3c reaches the bottom portion 2b of said<br>
second enclosure 2 via said second bottom pipe 2c, when<br>
the device is operating in a storage cycle, as explained<br>
below.<br>
A heat exchanger 6 co-operates with said first<br>
bottom pipe 1c between the bottom end 12 of said first<br>
enclosure 1 and said first turbine 3c.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, a second group 4, referred to<br>
as an electricity generator group, is interposed between<br>
said first enclosure 1 and said second enclosure 2 as<br>
follows. Said electricity generator second group 4<br>
comprises a second electric motor 4d coupled to a second<br>
gas turbine 4c and to a second compressor 4b. The second<br>
electric motor 4d is a small motor serving essentially to<br>
start the second turbine 4c when starting the energy<br>
return/withdrawal cycle, as explained below.<br>
The electricity generator second group 4 includes an<br>
alternator 4a coupled to the outlet shaft of said second<br>
gas turbine 4c and of said second compressor 4b, so as to<br>
return electrical energy ER when said second turbine 4c<br>
and said compressor 4b are activated, as explained below,<br>
during an energy withdrawal cycle.<br>
Said second turbine 4c is fed with gas by a duct 1d'<br>
constituting a branch connection from said first top duct<br>
1d (also referred to as the first top branch duct 1d'),<br>
or a duct parallel to said first top duct, providing the<br>
connection between the top end 11 of the first enclosure 1<br>
and the second turbine 4c. When the device is operating<br>
in a withdrawal cycle, the expanded gas leaving said<br>
second turbine 4c is exhausted towards the top end 21 of<br>
the second enclosure 2 via a branch duct 2d' on the<br>
second top duct 2d (also referred to as the second top<br>
branch duct 2d') or via a duct parallel with said second<br>
top duct, thus providing the connection between the top<br>
end 21 of the second enclosure and the second turbine 4c.<br>
Said second compressor 4b is fed with gas by a<br>
branch duct 2c' on said second bottom duct 2c (also<br>
referred to as the second branch bottom duct 2c') or a<br>
pipe parallel thereto thus providing a connection between<br>
the bottom end 22 of the second enclosure and the second<br>
compressor 4b. The gas is exhausted from said second<br>
compressor 4b towards the bottom end 12 of said first<br>
enclosure 1 via a branch duct 1c' on said first bottom<br>
duct 1c (also referred to as the first branch bottom duct<br>
1c') or a duct parallel to the first bottom duct 1c,<br>
providing the connection between the bottom end 12 and<br>
said second compressor 4b.<br>
The second branch bottom duct 2c' provides the<br>
connection between the second compressor 4b and the<br>
second bottom pipe 2c before it reaches said first<br>
turbine 3c. The first branch top duct Id' provides a<br>
connection between the second turbine 4c and the first<br>
top duct Id before it reaches said first compressor 3b.<br>
The seconc. branch top duct 2d' provides a junction<br>
between the; second turbine 4c and the second top duct 2d<br>
between sa;.d second heater 5b and said first compressor<br>
3b. The first branch bottom duct Ic' provides a<br>
connection between the second compressor 4b and the first<br>
bottom duct 1c between said heat exchange 6 and first<br>
turbine 3c.<br>
The enclosures 1 and 2 are filled with a porous<br>
refractory material 11 enabling the gas to flow right<br>
through said enclosures between their top ends 11-12 and<br>
bottom ends 12-22. The porous refractory materials used<br>
in the first and second enclosures may present porosity<br>
(void percentage) lying in the range 20% to 60%, thus<br>
constituting a good compromise between firstly sufficient<br>
heat exchange between the gas and the refractory<br>
materials, and secondly head loss that is sufficiently<br>
low, while conserving a speed of flow that is<br>
sufficiently high through said porous material. In<br>
operation, the device of the invention is completely<br>
filled with an inert gas, preferably argon, i.e. the<br>
above-mentioned pipe circuits, turbines, compressors,<br>
heaters, and said first and second enclosures are all<br>
filled with inert gas.<br>
Figure 3 is a section and side view of an enclosure<br>
comprising a gasproof metal outer casing 13 and an<br>
internal lagging system 12 disposed between the wall of<br>
the metal outer casing 13 and a stack of blocks or bricks<br>
of refractory material 11 presenting vertical channels 11^<br>
in the form of perforations, preferably of circular<br>
section with a diameter lying in the range 5 mm to 30 mm,<br>
passing right through them and arranged in substantially<br>
uniform rr,.anner in each plane over the entire horizontal<br>
section of said first enclosure, as shown in detail in<br>
Figures 3A and 3B.<br>
The channels llj^ in the various superposed blocks 11<br>
are in alignment with one another so as to allow the gas<br>
to circulate in the longitudinal direction ZZ of the<br>
enclosure 1, 2 between the two opposite ends of the<br>
enclosure without obstacle between the channels in the<br>
various blocks that are superposed on one another in the<br>
same longitudinal direction ZZ. A highly perforated<br>
support structure 14 situated in the bottom portion of<br>
said enclosure enables the gas entering or exiting via<br>
the adjacent lagged bottom ducts Ic, 2c to be spread in<br>
substantially uniform manner over the entire section of<br>
said enclosure, thereby directing the gas in optimum<br>
manner, i.e. with minimum head losses, to the channels 11;^<br>
passing vertically through said blocks of refractory<br>
material 11 when feeding takes place from the bottom.<br>
similarly, empty spaces 15 are provided in the top<br>
portions of the enclosures so as to enable the gas to be<br>
spread out well when the enclosures are fed with gas from<br>
the top. In Figure 3, the gas enters via the bottom and<br>
leaves through the top portion of the enclosure, with<br>
this corresponding to the storage stage for the second<br>
enclosure and to the return stage for the first<br>
enclosure, as explained below.<br>
Figure 3A is a fragmentary horizontal section in<br>
plan view on plane AA of Figure 3. The blocks 11 of<br>
refractory material are square and they are perforated by<br>
multiple parallel circularly cylindrical holes extending<br>
in the vertical direction ZZ perpendicular to the plane<br>
of the figure. The blocks are advantageously spaced<br>
apart from one another, e.g. by a distance e = 5 mm, so<br>
that the expansion of said blocks during changes of<br>
temperature can take place without damage in the<br>
thickness of the resulting interstitial space, and also<br>
enabling said space to serve, where appropriate, as a<br>
vertical channel for passing gas from the bottom of the<br>
enclosure 2 to the top thereof. The refractory material<br>
blocks 11 are advantageously in direct contact with the<br>
wall of the enclosure via the lagging 12 of said<br>
enclosure, so as to limit any direct and uncontrolled<br>
passage of cold or hot gas in said zone. In a first<br>
version of the invention, the blocks in the successive<br>
planes of blocks of refractory material are<br>
advantageously offset from one another by half a module,<br>
i.e. the blocks are staggered by half a block, so as to<br>
ensure that the assembly is stable within said enclosure,<br>
as shown in Figure 3. In a preferred version of the<br>
enclosure, the blocks are stacked vertically on one<br>
another over the entire height of the enclosure so as to<br>
make up mutually independent stacks that are spaced apart<br>
from one another by 5 mm to 10 mm in all directions, thus<br>
making expansion during storage-return cycles while<br>
avoiding any risk of wear in the horizontal planes AA<br>
during said storage-return cycles, as occurs when they<br>
are mounted in a staggered configuration as shown in<br>
Figure 3.<br>
In Figure 3B, there can be seen refractory blocks<br>
11a of hexagonal section, close to the insulating wall of<br>
an enclosure that is of cylindrical shape. The<br>
connection with the insulating walls takes place either<br>
by direct contact with the edge of a block, or else in<br>
the form of an insulating block 12a that is adapted to<br>
the curvature, or indeed by packing with an insulating<br>
material 12a, e.g. material of the same type as the<br>
lagging 12 of said enclosure, or indeed by a refractory<br>
block 12b of shape that matches the curvature.<br>
Branch connection valves V^ to V^ are provided at the<br>
junctions between:<br>
• the first top duct Id and the first branch top<br>
duct Id' : V^;<br>
¦ the second top duct 2d and the second branch top<br>
duct 2d: Vj,-<br>
• the first bottom duct Ic and the first branch<br>
bottom duct Ic': V3; and<br>
• the second bottom duct 2c and the second branch<br>
bottom duct 2c' : V4.<br>
As explained below with reference to Figures 1 and<br>
2, it is possible to operate said compressor first group<br>
3 (first compressor 3b and first turbine 3c) on its own<br>
by disconnecting said electricity generator second group<br>
4 during an energy storage cycle, or conversely, it is<br>
possible to disconnect said first compressor 3 and open<br>
said branch ducts to cause said second compressor 4 to<br>
operate during an energy withdrawal cycle.<br>
The device of the invention can operate in two<br>
different modes, namely:<br>
• a first mode with storage or charging cycles; and<br>
• a second mode with energy return or energy<br>
withdrawal cycles.<br>
The energy storage or charging mode operates as<br>
follows. Initially, the inert gas, such as argon, is<br>
loaded into the device, i.e. into both enclosures, the<br>
turbines, the compressors, and the pipework. It is at<br>
ambient temperature, e.g. T = 20°C.<br>
Figure 1 shows the device during a stage of<br>
recharging energy or storing energy in the first<br>
enclosure 1.<br>
Initially, the entire installation is at ambient<br>
temperature TO lying in the range 10°C to 20°C, with the<br>
gas contained in the enclosures and the pipework thus<br>
being at said ambient temperature TO and both enclosures<br>
are at the same initial pressure that is associated with<br>
the loading pressure, e.g. 1 bara to 1.2 bara.<br>
The mass of refractory material inside the second<br>
enclosure 2 is then heated to a temperature T2 of 600°C.<br>
To do this, the gas of the second enclosure is caused to<br>
circulate in a closed loop between its top and bottom<br>
ends 2^ and 22 and it is heated outside the enclosure<br>
using the first heater 5a which heat the gas in the<br>
heater pipe Saj that forms the loop between the bottom and<br>
top ends 22 and 2^ of the second enclosure, on the outside<br>
thereof. The gas is caused to circulate through the<br>
heater pipework Saj by a fan Saj, and the first heater 5a<br>
comprises a first resistance 5a^. A valve 5a4 serves to<br>
isolate the first heater 5a when it is not in use at the<br>
end of the initial preheating, thereby avoiding<br>
undesirable transfers and recirculation of gas during a<br>
normal cycle.<br>
When the entire mass of refractory material in the<br>
second enclosure 2 has been raised to the temperature T2<br>
of 600°C, the valve Sa^ is closed and the gas is sent via<br>
the second top duct 2d into the first compressor 3b so as<br>
to heat it to a temperature Tl lying in the range 1200°C<br>
to 1400°C, e.g. 1300°C at the outlet from said first<br>
compressor. A pressure gradient is established between<br>
the two enclosures, the first enclosure being raised to a<br>
pressure PI of 2 bara to 4 bara (2x105 Pa to 4x10^ Pa),<br>
and the pressure P2 in the second enclosure being reduced<br>
to about 1 bara (1x10^ Pa).<br>
In the first enclosure, the top portion la of the<br>
refractory material thus rises towards the temperature Tl<br>
of 1300°C, while the bottom portion lb becomes<br>
established at a temperature T'l lying in the range 20°C<br>
to 100°C.<br>
At the outlet from the bottom end Ij of the first<br>
enclosure, the gas needs to be expanded by the first<br>
turbine 3c so as to reestablish it at the pressure P2 of<br>
the second enclosure prior to being reintroduced into the<br>
second enclosure via the bottom thereof, expanded and<br>
cooled to a temperature T3. Insofar as the energy stored<br>
by the system is associated with the temperature gradient<br>
T1-T3, it is advantageous to keep the temperature T3 as<br>
low as possible. For this purpose, it is advantageous to<br>
cause gas to be introduced and to penetrate into the<br>
first turbine 3b at a temperature that is as low as<br>
possible. That is why the gas is cooled from the<br>
temperature T'l to the temperature TO lying in the range<br>
10°C to 20°C with the help of a heat exchanger 6 at the<br>
outlet from the bottom end Ij of the first enclosure prior<br>
to being introduced into the first turbine 3c.<br>
As the various gas circulation cycles progress while<br>
operating in storage mode, the top portion la of the<br>
refractory material in the hot first enclosure at a<br>
temperature Tl of 1300°C occupies an ever increasing<br>
volume in the enclosure, i.e. the hot gas introduced via<br>
the top end 1^ of the first enclosure 1 delivers heat to<br>
said refractory materials and heats an ever increasing<br>
volume of refractory material in the first enclosure. A<br>
front le that corresponds to a temperature transition<br>
zone is represented by a line in Figures 1 and 2 . The<br>
hot top portion la at the temperature Tl and the cold<br>
bottom portion lb at the temperature T' 1 lying in the<br>
range 20°C to 100°C moves progressively downwards as the<br>
gas circulation cycles continue during storage.<br>
Conversely, the bottom portion 2b of the second enclosure<br>
at the temperature T3 lying in the range at least -80°C<br>
to -20°C occupies an ever increasing volume in the<br>
enclosure 2. The front 2e represents a line of<br>
separat;-on that is constituted by a transition zone<br>
between the bottom portion 2b at the temperature T3 and a<br>
top portion 2a that the temperature T2, and it moves<br>
progressively upwards as the various gas circulation<br>
cycles progress.<br>
The first compressor 3b is actuated by an electric<br>
motor 3a which consumes electrical energy E^^. The first<br>
turbine 3c is coupled to the first compressor 3b via<br>
their shafts, such that the first turbine 3c delivers<br>
energy to the first compressor 3b in addition to the<br>
energy delivered by the first motor 3a.<br>
During successive gas circulation cycles in energy<br>
storage mode, the temperature of the top portion 2a in<br>
the second enclosure tends to decrease to a temperature<br>
T'2 that is lower than T2, i.e. lower than 600°C, e.g.<br>
lying in the range 300°C to 450°C.<br>
To mitigate this drop in temperature of the top<br>
portion 2a of the second enclosure, it is advantageous to<br>
heat the gas leaving the top end 2^ of the second<br>
enclosure by means of a second heater 5b comprising a<br>
second resistance Saj that enables the gas flowing in the<br>
top duct 2d to be heated so as to maintain it at a<br>
temperature T2 of 600°C before it reaches the first<br>
compressor 3b. Similarly, the motor 3a is adjusted in<br>
such a manner as to maintain the outlet temperature from<br>
the first compressor 3b at a constant temperature Tl of<br>
about 1300°C.<br>
Throughout the duration of the various energy<br>
storage cycles, the temperature of the gas at the inlet<br>
to the second heater 5b is measured and the quantity of<br>
electrical energy Ej injected per second into the second<br>
heater 5b is adjusted in real time to raise the gas to a<br>
substantially constant temperature T2. The power<br>
injected into the installation during energy storage<br>
cycles thus corresponds to the electrical energy E^<br>
feeding the first electric motor 3a plus the electrical<br>
energy E2 feeding the second heater 5b.<br>
As mentioned above, during energy storage cycles, it<br>
is necessary to cool the gas leaving the bottom end Ij of<br>
the first enclosure so as to reduce its temperature to<br>
the temperature TO prior to expanding it in the first<br>
turbine 3c. This is done using the heat exchanger 6.<br>
The heat exchanger 6 is fed with a cooling fluid such as<br>
cold water or air at a temperature in the range 10°C to<br>
20°C as to cool the gas leaving the first enclosure at<br>
the temperature T'l lying in the range 20°C to 100°C and<br>
bring it to the temperature TO lying in the range 10°C to<br>
20°C. T?ie cooling fluid from the heat exchanger 6 leaves<br>
the heat exchanger 6 at 6d at a temperature lying in the<br>
range 50°C to 100°C depending on the flow rate of cooling<br>
air or water. The heat exchanger 6 thus releases heat<br>
energy E3 in the form of water heated to a temperature in<br>
the range 50°C to 100°C. This heat energy E3 is energy<br>
that cannot be stored in the system, but it can be<br>
recovered either in a heat pump or it can be used in<br>
industrial processes, or even for urban heating. Thus,<br>
during a complete storage cycle, E3 constitutes a loss<br>
that affects the overall efficiency of the device.<br>
In order to stabilize the system and optimize this<br>
operation during the succession of different passages<br>
from operating in storage mode to operating in energy<br>
return mode, it is preferable to interrupt storage before<br>
the entire first enclosure has been raised to the<br>
temperature Tl or the entire second enclosure has been<br>
lowered to the temperature T3.<br>
In practice, a bottom portion lb constituting 10% to<br>
20% of the total volume of the first enclosure is<br>
maintained in said enclosure at the temperature T'l lying<br>
in the range 20°C to 100°C. In parallel, a top portion<br>
2a of the second enclosure is maintained at the<br>
temperature T2 or close to the temperature T2, i.e.<br>
storage is interrupted when the bottom portion 2b of the<br>
second enclosure at the temperature lying in the range<br>
-80°C to -20°C represents 80% to 90% of the volume of the<br>
second enclosure.<br>
This volume of 10% to 20% corresponds to the volume<br>
of the temperature transition zone of height a as<br>
described below with reference to Figure 7.<br>
Figure 2 shows the cycle for returning energy stored<br>
within the first enclosure 1 in the form of electrical<br>
energy Er.<br>
Once charging of the first enclosure 1 is complete,<br>
the first motor 3a is stopped and the various valves V^^ to<br>
V4 are actuated so as to feed the second group 4 with said<br>
first and second branch top ducts Id', 2d', and said<br>
first and second branch bottom ducts Ic', 2c', the first<br>
compressor 3b and the first turbine 3c no longer being<br>
fed with gas.<br>
Initially, at the end of the charging stage, when<br>
the first motor 3a is switched off, the gas becomes<br>
stationary and its pressure is brought into equilibrium<br>
in the two enclosures 1 and 2 at an intermediate value of<br>
1.5 bara to 2.5 bara (1.5x10^ Pa to 2.5X10^ Pa).<br>
During a stage of starting the mode of operation in<br>
energy return or withdrawal cycling, a small electric<br>
motor 4d is activated that drives the second turbine 4c<br>
and the second compressor 4b that is coupled thereto so<br>
that a pressure gradient becomes established between the<br>
two enclosures 1 and 2, respectively with a pressure P'l<br>
higher than PI in the first enclosure 1 and a pressure<br>
P'2 lower than P2 in the second enclosure 2.<br>
During starting, the second compressor sucks gas<br>
from the second enclosure and sends it to the first<br>
enclosure, thereby increasing the pressure in said first<br>
enclosure, and thus feeding the second turbine with gas<br>
so as to return finally into the second enclosure and<br>
continue its circulation cycle. As soon as the turbine<br>
reaches its operating speed, the small electric motor 4d<br>
is switched off.<br>
Under steady conditions, the second turbine 4c sucks<br>
gas from the top portion of the first enclosure and<br>
delivers it to the second enclosure while cooling and<br>
expanding the gas. In order to optimize the operation of<br>
the installation, it is desirable for the gas leaving the<br>
second turbine 4d to take on substantially the same<br>
temperature T2 as the temperature of the gas in the top<br>
portion of the enclosure 2 at the end of the storage<br>
cycle. To achieve this, losses in the turbine and<br>
compressor are such that P'l/P'2 &gt; P1/P2. In practice,<br>
P'l lies in the range 3 bara to 5 bara and P'2 in the<br>
range 1 bara to 1.5 bara.<br>
When the pressure gradient P'l/P'2 is established,<br>
the motor 4d is switched off. The gas in the bottom<br>
portion 2b of the second enclosure is at the temperature<br>
T3 lying in the range -80°C to -20°C which was its<br>
temperature at the end of the storage cycle. The gas is<br>
taken to the second compressor 4b where it is<br>
recompressed to the pressure P'l. It is simultaneously<br>
heated to the temperature T4, which temperature T4 is<br>
higher than the temperature TO because of the losses in<br>
the second compressor. Typically, T4 lies in the range<br>
100°C to 150°C.<br>
The gas at the temperature T4 greater than TO at the<br>
outlet fjrom the second compressor 4b therefore needs to<br>
be cooled to the temperature T'l using the heat exchanger<br>
6 prior to being delivered to the bottom end 1^ of the<br>
first enclosure 1, in which the bottom portion lb is at<br>
the temperature T'l lying in the range 20°C to 120°C.<br>
The cooling of the gas at the outlet from the second<br>
compressor 4b during the withdrawal cycle has the effect<br>
of causing heat energy E4 to be lost by heating the<br>
cooling liquid. However this cooling of the gas from the<br>
temperature T4 to T'l makes it easier during energy<br>
storage cycles to cool the gas at the outlet from the<br>
bottom end 1^^ of the first enclosure from the temperature<br>
T'l to the temperature TO downstream from the heat<br>
exchanger so that the gas reaches ambient temperature TO<br>
on entering the first turbine 3c during energy storage<br>
cycles. Overall, the heat energy loss E4 during<br>
withdrawal cycles is compensated by a heat energy loss E3<br>
in the heat exchanger 6 that is smaller than during<br>
storage cycles. The heat energies E3 + E4 correspond<br>
overall to the losses from the installation associated<br>
with the gradient T4-T0 and due to losses in the<br>
compressors and the turbines.<br>
The energy E^ returned by the system corresponds to<br>
the energy released by the second turbine 4c that drives<br>
an electrical generator-alternator 4a that enables the<br>
energy to be returned in the form of electricity.<br>
Overall, Ej^ corresponds more precisely to the energy<br>
released by the second turbine 4c minus the energy<br>
consumed by the second compressor 4b which is coupled<br>
thereto. Furthermore, the overall efficiency of the<br>
installation between the storage and withdrawal cycles<br>
can be written as follows:<br>
Er = El - E2 - (E3 + EJ - E5<br>
where E5 represents the losses through the lagging of the<br>
enclosures, the ducts, the turbines, the compressors, and<br>
the various accessories.<br>
The losses E3+E4+E5 represent 15% to 25% compared<br>
with the energies E^+Ej supplied, so the overall<br>
efficiency of the installation and the energy return<br>
method thus lie in the range 75% to 85%.<br>
In order to optimize the energy efficiency of the<br>
installation, it is advantageous to avoid heating the<br>
first enclosure completely to the temperature Tl at the<br>
end of the storage cycle, so as to conserve a thermal<br>
transition layer in the bottom portion lb at a<br>
temperature TO or T'l, and to conserve a thermal<br>
transition zone in the top portion 2b of the second<br>
enclosure at the temperature T2. Similarly, during<br>
energy return cycles at the end of a cycle, withdrawal is<br>
stopped before the first enclosure has been cooled<br>
completely and the second enclosure has been heated<br>
completely so as to conserve a thermal transition layer<br>
in the top portion la corresponding to 10% to 20% of the<br>
volume of the enclosure that remains at the temperature<br>
Tl, and corresponding a thermal transition zone in the<br>
bottom portion 2b of the second enclosure that remains at<br>
the temperature T3, this layer likewise representing 10%<br>
to 20% of the volume of the second enclosure.<br>
This thermal transition zone in the top portion 2b<br>
of the second enclosure at the temperature T2 makes it<br>
easier to reestablish the pressure gradient P'l/P'2<br>
between the two enclosures at the beginning of the cycle<br>
for returning energy corresponding to the same<br>
temperatures T1/T2 in the first/second enclosures<br>
respectively.<br>
Keeping a thermal transition zone at one end of each<br>
of the first and second enclosures at the end of a<br>
storage cycle and at the end of a return cycle is also<br>
advantageous in terms of the overall energy efficiency of<br>
the installation. If the entire first enclosure were to<br>
be heated at the end of the storage cycle, then the gas<br>
leaving the bottom end 1^ of the first enclosure while<br>
heating the volume corresponding to the thermal<br>
transition layer at the bottom end of the first enclosure<br>
would leave at a temperature higher than the temperature<br>
T'l, which would require greater cooling energy E3 and<br>
therefore higher energy losses.<br>
In parallel, if at the end of the return cycle the<br>
bottom end 22 of the entire second enclosure were to be<br>
heated, the gas leaving the bottom end 22 of the second<br>
enclosure would leave at a temperature higher than T3 and<br>
would arrive downstream from the heat exchanger 6 at a<br>
higher temperature T4, thereby leading to higher cooling<br>
heat loss E4 and thus to energy losses that are likewise<br>
greater.<br>
In addition, maintaining a bottom portion lb at the<br>
temperature T'l at the end of storage and a top portion<br>
2a at tne temperature T2 in the second enclosure at the<br>
end of storage makes it easier to start the return cycle,<br>
which requires using the motor 4d during a shorter length<br>
of time in order to establish stable operation with<br>
temperature gradients Tl and T2 in the first and second<br>
enclosures respectively at the pressures P'l and P'2<br>
during return. Likewise, maintaining a hot top layer la<br>
at the temperature Tl in the first enclosure at the end<br>
of energy return and maintaining a cold bottom layer 2b<br>
at the temperature T3 at the end of the return cycle<br>
makes it easier to start the subsequent storage cycle by<br>
reducing the amount of electrical energy E2 that is<br>
needed to maintain the gas entering the first compressor<br>
3b at the temperature T2.<br>
The dimensioning of the first compressor 3b and of<br>
the first turbine 3c used during storage cycles, is very<br>
different from the dimensioning of the second compressor<br>
4b and the second turbine 4c used during withdrawal<br>
cycles given the different temperatures to which they are<br>
subjected. The volume of a gas increases with<br>
temperature, so the compressor and the turbine that<br>
operate with gas inlet at a high temperature needs to be<br>
larger in size. That is why during the storage stage,<br>
the first compressor 3b is a large compressor since it<br>
operates az a temperature Tl of 1300°C, while the first<br>
turbine 3c is a small turbine since it operates at a<br>
temperature T3 of about -50°C. Conversely, during<br>
withdrawal cycles, the second compressor 4c which<br>
operates a temperature T3 of -50°C is a small compressor,<br>
while the second turbine 4c that operates at a<br>
temperature Tl of about 1300°C is a large turbine. It<br>
should be observed that implementing a first turbine 3c<br>
that is small during the storage stage makes it easier<br>
for it to be driven by the large first compressor 3b.<br>
Similarly, implementing a second compressor 4b that is<br>
small rgiduces energy losses and the energy Ej^ corresponds<br>
to the energy released by the second turbine 4c minus the<br>
energy consumed by the second compressor 4b. There is<br>
therefore an additional advantage in having the<br>
temperature T3 as low as possible at the inlet to the<br>
second compressor 4b so as to likewise reduce the<br>
consumption of energy that affects the overall energy<br>
consumption of the system.<br>
Making use of cooling both during energy storage<br>
cycles and during energy withdrawal cycles downstream<br>
from the: bottom end of the first enclosure during energy<br>
storage and upstream from the bottom end of the first<br>
enclosure during energy return, using the same heat<br>
exchanger, enables the size of the heat exchanger to be<br>
reduced compared with an embodiment in which, for<br>
example, the gas is not cooled during energy return<br>
cycles in a heat exchanger downstream from the bottom end<br>
of the first enclosure.<br>
As successive gas circulation cycles take place<br>
during the energy return stage, the front le between the<br>
cold bottom portion lb at T'l and the hot top portion la<br>
at Tl in the first enclosure moves progressively upwards,<br>
while the front 2e between the hot top portion 2a at<br>
temperature T2 from the cold bottom portion 2b at<br>
temperature T3 in the second enclosure moves<br>
progressively downwards.<br>
It should be observed that firstly operating the<br>
heat exchanger 6 on the gas return circuit between the<br>
second compressor 4b and the bottom portion of the first<br>
enclosure 1, and secondly operating the second turbine 4c<br>
are adjusted in such a manner as to maintain said<br>
temperatures Tl and T2 at respective constant values,<br>
e.g. of 1300°C and 500°C, throughout the energy return<br>
cycle.<br>
It should also be observed that, according to an<br>
essential original characteristic of the present<br>
invention, the temperatures Tl and T2 are constant and<br>
identical during energy storage/charging cycles and<br>
during energy return/discharging cycles.<br>
Figure 4 is a graph corresponding to a thermodynamic<br>
cycle in which the abscissa axis represents volumes and<br>
the ordinate axis represents absolute pressures (bara).<br>
Four isothermals are shown corresponding respectively to:<br>
• TO (ambient temperature 20°C);<br>
• Tl (first enclosure temperature: 1300°C);<br>
• T2 (hot second enclosure temperature: 600°C); and<br>
• T3 (cold second enclosure temperature: ~80°C to<br>
-20°C).<br>
Between points A and B, there is represented an<br>
adiabatic compression/expansion cycle for a perfect gas<br>
in application of the relationship: PV = constant,<br>
between the temperatures Tl and T2. In a real machine,<br>
the behavior is different, and for adiabatic compression<br>
between T2 and Tl, the curve actually followed is ABl,<br>
which shows that the temperature Tl is reached at a<br>
pressure Pbl that is lower than Pb and at a volume Vbl<br>
that is greater than Vb. Similarly, during adiabatic<br>
expansion, the temperature T2 is reached for a pressure<br>
Pal that is lower than Pa and a volume Val that is<br>
greater than Va.<br>
It should be observed that for effective management<br>
of heat in both of the enclosures, it is important for<br>
the high portion of each of the gas enclosures to be at<br>
respective temperatures that are substantially identical<br>
during the storage stage and during the return stage. To<br>
explain this point, consider for example the top portion<br>
of the first enclosure. During the storage stage, the<br>
hot gas penetrates from the top into the supply of<br>
refractories. The temperature of the solids cannot<br>
exceed that of the gas but can merely come as close as<br>
possible thereto. During the return stage, the<br>
temperature of the gas leaving the top portion of the<br>
supply of refractory material in the first enclosure can<br>
at best be equal to the temperature of said refractory<br>
material. Identical remarks can be made for the second<br>
enclosure. In order to obtain the highest possible<br>
efficiency, it is important in the first enclosure for<br>
all of the heat of the gas that is injected during the<br>
storage stage to be used as well as possible during the<br>
return stage, and in the second enclosure for all of the<br>
heat recovered from the gas during the storage stage to<br>
be reused as well as possible during the return stage.<br>
In other words, it is advantageous to seek to have<br>
temperatures Tl and T2 that are as close together as<br>
possible (ideally identical) during the storage and<br>
return stages.<br>
As mentioned above with reference to Figure 4, if<br>
the same temperatures Tl and T2 are used during expansion<br>
or compression with real machines, then the pressure<br>
ratios are different. This means that the pressure<br>
ratios of the turbine-and-compressor assemblies used<br>
during tne storage and return stages need to be<br>
different. For example, from Figure 4, during storage<br>
the high pressure is P^^^ and the low pressure P^, whereas<br>
during the return stage the high pressure is P^^ and the<br>
low pressure P^j^.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show thermodynamic cycles<br>
corresponding respectively to the energy storage and<br>
return cycles that take place in the installations and<br>
methods as described with reference to Figures 1 and 2.<br>
These thermodynamic cycles correspond to a unit volume of<br>
gas, e.g. 1 m3, performing one complete cycle during which<br>
it acquires energy in one of the enclosures or in a<br>
compressor, and then returns it in a turbine or in the<br>
other enclosure. Said unit volume performs this<br>
thermodynamic cycle in a length of time that is very<br>
short compared with the complete duration of a storage or<br>
return cycle, and it thus carries out hundreds or<br>
thousands or even tens of thousands of thermodynamic<br>
cycles, i.e. it passes that many times through the<br>
compressor, the turbine, the ducts, and each of the<br>
enclosures.<br>
Figure 5 shows the storage stage as described with<br>
reference to Figure 1 . The gas coming from the top<br>
portion of the second enclosure enters the first<br>
compressor 3b at the temperature T2 at point A. It is<br>
compressed and leaves at the temperature Tl at point B.<br>
It penetrates the refractory mass 11 of the first<br>
enclosure 1, passes through the refractory mass<br>
delivering heat thereto, thereby causing the temperature<br>
front to move progressively downwards. The gas leaves<br>
the bot'iom portion of the first enclosure at 6a at a<br>
temperature of about 20°C to 100°C, and then passes<br>
through the heat exchanger 6 where it delivers energy E3<br>
to the outside so as to leave said heat exchanger at a<br>
substantially constant temperature TO corresponding to an<br>
ambient temperature of 20°C, corresponding to point C of<br>
the diagram. It then passes through the turbine at 3c<br>
where it gives off its energy to the compressor 3b, and<br>
it leaves the turbine in the pipe 2c at the temperature<br>
T3 (-5C°C) corresponding to point D of the diagram.<br>
Finally, it enters the low portion of the second<br>
enclosure, where it recovers heat from the refractory<br>
mass through which it flows upwards, thereby causing the<br>
temperature front E2 to rise progressively upwards.<br>
Finally,, the gas leaves the second enclosure from the top<br>
thereof and is taken to the compressor 3b, which it<br>
enters at the temperature T2, possibly after passing<br>
through the heater 5b where, if necessary, it receives<br>
sufficient energy E2 to readjust said gas temperature to<br>
a value T2. The gas is then returned to point A on the<br>
diagram and then undertakes a new cycle.<br>
The thermodynamic cycle for returning energy as<br>
shown in detail on Figure 6 takes place as follows. The<br>
gas at high temperature Tl leaves the first enclosure 1<br>
from the top, corresponding to point B on the diagram.<br>
The gas is then passed through the turbine 4c to where it<br>
delivers energy to the generator (ER) and reaches point A<br>
on the diagram at temperature T2. Thereafter it enters<br>
the top of the second enclosure and delivers its heat to<br>
the refractory mass 11, thereby causing the temperature<br>
front 2e to move progressively downwards, and it leaves<br>
said enclosure from the bottom at a temperature T3<br>
corresponding to point D on the diagram. The gas then<br>
passes through the second compressor 4b which it leaves<br>
at a temperature T4 higher than the desired temperature<br>
TO: it then passes through a heat exchanger 6 where it<br>
delivers the quantity of energy E4 to the outside, so as<br>
to return to the temperature TO, and thus to point C of<br>
said diagram. Finally, it penetrates into the first<br>
enclosure from the bottom where it recovers energy and<br>
heats up to reach point B of the diagram, thereby causing<br>
the temperature front le to rise progressively upwards,<br>
in other words cooling said first enclosure down overall.<br>
Figure 7 shows on the left, in section in side view,<br>
the first enclosure and the rising front le between the<br>
bottom zone where the temperature is about 20 °C and the<br>
top portion where the temperature is about 1300°C. This<br>
rising front corresponds to a transition zone of height h<br>
as shown in greater detail by the graph on the right of<br>
Figure 7. During the energy storage stage, the<br>
transition zone moves downwards (Figure 7B), and during<br>
the return stage it moves upwards (Figure 7A) . In order<br>
to remain within the operating ranges of the turbine<br>
machines that corresponds to best efficiency, the first<br>
enclosure is advantageously neither fully charged nor<br>
fully discharged, which corresponds, as shown in detail<br>
in Figure 7B, to limiting the charge/discharge cycle to a<br>
maximum he;ight dE-^, e.g. corresponding to 80%-90% to the<br>
total height, and thus of the total peak capacity of said<br>
first enclosure. In like manner, a similar transition<br>
zone exists in the second enclosure, however it<br>
corresponds to different temperatures, e.g. -50°C in the<br>
bottom portion and 500°C in the top portion. The<br>
percentage of the calorific mass that is used then<br>
corresponds to a height SHj, said used percentage<br>
preferably being substantially identical to that to of<br>
said first enclosure, i.e. 80%-90%.<br>
By means of this configuration having two enclosures<br>
at different temperatures, with masses of refractory<br>
material that are used to only 80%-90% of their heat<br>
capacity, it is possible to obtain efficiency that is<br>
very good, of the order of 75% to 85%.<br>
This is due firstly to the fact that the energy is<br>
alternately pumped and recovered between two temperature<br>
levels T2 to Tl that are both well above ambient<br>
temperature. It is known from Carnot's theorem that the<br>
efficiency of a heat engine increases with increasing<br>
temperature of its hot source.<br>
A second reason lies in the temperatures Tl and T2<br>
being equal during both the storage and the return<br>
stages, with this being obtained by using different<br>
turbine and compressor assemblies operating with<br>
different pressure ratios (P1/P2 and P'l/P'2).<br>
A third reason for the good overall efficiency lies<br>
in the fact that during the storage stage, losses from<br>
the hot compressor 3b are extracted in the form of heat<br>
in the gas. This energy is stored in the refractory of<br>
the first enclosure 1 just like the heat pumped from the<br>
second enclosure. This loss of energy from the hot<br>
compressor is thus recovered for the most part in the<br>
form of useful work during the return stage.<br>
The fourth reason results from using regenerators<br>
for exchanging heat with a gas. It is possible to<br>
arrange sets of refractory parts that can operate at very<br>
high temp)erature and that present a very large heat<br>
exchange area between the gas and the solids. This makes<br>
it possible to approach as close as possible to equality<br>
between the temperatures Tl and T2 in both stages. The<br>
storage capacity is associated with the mass of<br>
refractory material. The disposition of the invention<br>
presents the advantage that nearly all of the refractory<br>
mass is used to perform two roles: storing heat and<br>
exchanging heat with the gas.<br>
The final reason for good overall efficiency results<br>
from the fact that the cold produced by expansion in the<br>
turbine 3c during the storage stage is likewise stored in<br>
the enclosure 2. During the return stage this enables<br>
the gas to be cooled prior to it being compressed by the<br>
compressor 4b, thereby decreasing the amount of energy<br>
absorbed by the compressor 4b, which energy is taken from<br>
the energy that is returned Ej^.<br>
The power of a turbomachine is given by the formula:<br>
W = m.Cp.(T2- Tl)<br>
where: m is the mass flow rate of the gas in kilograms<br>
per second (kg/s), Cp is the heat capacity of the gas in<br>
joules pei: kilogram per kelvin (J/kg/K) , Tl is the gas<br>
inlet temperature and T2 is the gas outlet temperature.<br>
For a turbine, T2 
is extracted from the gas). For a compressor, W is<br>
positive (power is delivered to the gas).<br>
The density of the gas is proportional to its molar<br>
mass. It is easier to compress or expand a heavy gas<br>
than a light gas. The necessary machines are smaller and<br>
less expensive for a heavy gas than for a light gas.<br>
The molar mass of argon is 40, of CO2 is 44, of<br>
krypton is 84, of xenon is 131, and of radon is 222.<br>
Thus, a turbomachine using krypton or xenon as its<br>
gas is much more compact than one using a gas such as<br>
helium that has a molar mass of 4, or nitrogen that has a<br>
molar mass of 28. In addition, in the thermodynamic<br>
formula:<br>
PV'' = constant<br>
Y = 1.66 for a monatomic gas;<br>
Y = 1.4 for a diatomic gas; and<br>
Y = 1.33 for a triatomic gas.<br>
The temperature ratios Tl, T2 depends on the<br>
pressure ratio PI, P2 or P'l, P'2, in application of the<br>
formula:: <br>
It can be seen that for a given temperature ratio,<br>
the pressure ratio is smaller for a monatomic gas (y =<br>
1.56) than for a diatomic gas (Y = 1.4), or a triatomic<br>
gas (Y == 1.33). This is of practical advantage in the<br>
design of the enclosures. The wall thickness of the<br>
enclosures is associated with the maximum pressure of the<br>
gas. In addition, since the method has the capacity to<br>
store very large quantities of energy it would use<br>
enclosures of very large dimensions. It is therefore<br>
economically advantageous to seek to minimize the<br>
internal pressure level of the gas. One simple way of<br>
achieving this result is to limit the compression ratio<br>
of the gas, for which it is preferable to select a gas<br>
that is monatomic.<br>
Thus, the best cycle is obtained with a monatomic<br>
gas, such as helium, neon, argon, or other noble gases of<br>
high molecular mass.<br>
Diatomic gases such as nitrogen and triatomic gases<br>
such as air or COj are very abundant and inexpensive, but<br>
at high temperature they are aggressive to metals<br>
constitut:-ng the casing of enclosures, the pipes, or the<br>
blades of turbines and compressors, that is why it is<br>
advantageous for the gas within the device to be an inert<br>
gas that is completely inert relative to the metal<br>
elements of the device, such as helium, neon, argon or<br>
other noble gases of higher molar mass. Helium, neon,<br>
and argon are present at significant percentages in<br>
ambient air and they are available in large quantities at<br>
acceptable costs. Of these three gases, argon is the gas<br>
that gives the best performance for use in the device of<br>
the invention since it is monatomic, inert at high and<br>
very high temperatures relative to metal elements<br>
constituting the device of the invention, and it presents<br>
a molecular mass that is high together with an<br>
acquisition cost that is low.<br>
Said first refractory material of the first<br>
enclosure is for example chamotte, also known as second-<br>
firing fire clay that withstands 1200°C, or indeed a<br>
composition having a high content of alumina and/or<br>
magnesia. The second refractory material in the second<br>
enclosure may be first-firing fire clay.<br>
As mentioned above, the refractory materials 11 are<br>
in the form of bricks that are perforated by parallel<br>
channels having a diameter of 5 mm to 20 mm and that pass<br>
right through the bricks, being disposed in such a manner<br>
as to encible gas to circulate and pass along the channels<br>
in the longitudinal direction of the enclosure.<br>
Various types of very high temperature refractory<br>
material that are available under economically acceptable<br>
conditions are listed in the table below.<br>
Chamorte remains the least expensive of all these<br>
materials, but its maximum temperature remains well below<br>
that of th€i others.<br>
Furthermore, the energy stored in a cubic meter of<br>
refractory is given by the formula:<br>
E = V.Cp(T - TO)<br>
where E is expressed in joules, V is the volume of hot<br>
refractory, Cp is the heat capacity in joules per cubic<br>
meter per kelvin (J/m3/K) , T is the hot temperature, and<br>
TO is the initial temperature before heating.<br>
It can thus be seen that the higher the storage<br>
temperature T the greater the amount of energy that is<br>
stored per unit volume of refractory.<br>
Thus, for magnesia the limit temperature of 1800°C<br>
presents better performance in terms of heat capacity per<br>
unit volume with a value:<br>
Cp = 3600 kJ*m-^*K-'<br>
By way of example, for a device having a capacity of<br>
3000 MWh, capable of storing and returning power at<br>
100 MW, corresponding to charging over 40 hours and<br>
return over 30 hours is constituted:<br>
• by a first enclosure that is cylindrical having a<br>
diameter of 41 meters (m) and a height of 20 m,<br>
containing 16,500 m3 of magnesia, presenting 25% porosity,<br>
i.e., 37,000 metric tonnes (t) of refractory material;<br>
and<br>
• a second enclosure having a diameter of 48 m, a<br>
height of 20 m, and containing 22,500 m3 of chamotte,<br>
presenting 35% porosity, i.e. 29,500 t of refractory<br>
material, a storage group comprising a 100 MW electric<br>
motor 3a, a 117 MW compressor 3b, a 17 MW turbine 3c, and<br>
a return group comprising a 100 MW generator 4a, a 156 MW<br>
turbine 4c, and a 56 MW compressor 4b. The internal<br>
volume of the complete installation, including the<br>
connection ducts, but excluding the volume corresponding<br>
to the effective mass of refractory, comes to about<br>
35,000 m3. A fraction of the gas is confined within the<br>
insulating materials that lag the walls of the hot<br>
refractory enclosures (about 12,000 m3) and only an<br>
available volume of 23,000 m3 can participate in gas<br>
circulation. The installation is filled with argon prior<br>
to starting a pressure of 1 bar, i.e. 2 bara, which<br>
corresponds to a volume of 70,000 normalized cubic meters<br>
(Nm3), of which 46,000 Nm3 is free to circulate. During<br>
the storage stage, the pressure PI is 3 bara in the first<br>
enclosure and the pressure P2 is 0.9 bara in the second<br>
enclosure, whereas during discharging, these pressures<br>
are respectively 3.3 bara (P'l) and 0.6 bara (P'2). The<br>
temperature Tl becomes established at 1256°C while the<br>
temperature T2 is about 600°C. During the storage stage,<br>
the flow rate of gas to the turbine 3c or the compressor<br>
3b is 193 normalized cubic meters per second (Nm3/s),<br>
giving a thermodynamic cycle time as shown in Figure 5 of<br>
238 seconds, which corresponds to 600 cycles of gas<br>
circulation for the duration of a full charge. Similar<br>
values a2:e obtained for the discharge cycle.<br>
Centrifugal or axial compressors and turbines are<br>
generally limited in temperature because of the<br>
aggressivity of the gas that results from combustion,<br>
however :-n the device of the invention, said turbines and<br>
said compressors are used in a closed circuit with an<br>
inert gas such as argon, thereby enabling such machines<br>
to present operating points at much higher temperature<br>
than in the prior art.<br>
The energy stored in the first and second enclosures<br>
is not lost unless the device is left inactive for a long<br>
time in terms of charging-discharging, and losses then<br>
take place to the surrounding medium, principally through<br>
the lagging 12 of said enclosures.<br>
Since the method is essentially of advantage in<br>
storing Large quantities of energy, the enclosures are<br>
relatively voluminous, which means that their surface<br>
over volume ratio is small. Heat losses for large<br>
enclosures represent only a small fraction of the energy<br>
stored. Thermal insulation is achieved with materials<br>
presenting high porosity, such as ceramic fiber felts or<br>
ceramic foams. Calculation shows that in the above-cited<br>
example, lagging presenting a thickness of 2 m using<br>
conventional fiber materials enables energy losses to be<br>
limited to less than 1% per day.<br>
since the gas is inert, the large compressor 3b and<br>
the large turbine 4c that operate at high temperature can<br>
advantageously be made with carbon-based materials. Such<br>
materials are capable mechanically of withstanding very<br>
high temperatures, up to more than 2000°C. They are not<br>
usually used for constructing turbomachines since they<br>
oxidize rapidly in oxidizing gases such as air or<br>
combust:.on products. This limitation does not apply<br>
here, so the use of carbon-based materials can be<br>
envisaged. Carbon turbines have already been made<br>
experime^ntally, or for rocket engines having a lifetime<br>
of no more than a few minutes. In this application of<br>
the invention, such turbines or compressors would have no<br>
lifetime limitation. In current machines made using<br>
metals, it is necessary to cool the blades by an internal<br>
flow of cold gas, and this is achieved to the detriment<br>
of efficiency. In spite of that, the moving blades<br>
present a lifetime that is limited because of the<br>
phenomenon of creep.<br>
Figure 1 shows two separate heaters 5a and 5b,<br>
however it is possible to use a single heater, providing<br>
the configuration of the ducts is adapted appropriately.<br>
