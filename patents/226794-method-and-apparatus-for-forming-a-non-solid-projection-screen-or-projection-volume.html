				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FORMING A NON-SOLID PROJECTION<br>
SCREEN OR PROJECTION VOLUME<br>
The present invention relates to a method for forming a projection screen or a<br>
if*" â– <br>
projection volume. The invention also relates to a device for implementing the<br>
aforementioned method.<br>
In this context, a projection screen refers generally to a substantially<br>
two-dimensional surface with such light reflection and/or light scattering<br>
properties that a moving or still image, or other performances or effects<br>
based on the use of light, can be reflected on the surface by means of<br>
a projector, light effect device, laser device, or the like. In a corre-<br>
sponding manner, a projection volume refers to a substantially three-<br>
dimensional object that can be illuminated in a suitable manner to produce<br>
 three-dimensional patterns.<br>
The most commonly used projection screens are manufactured of<br>
fabric, painted wood, metal, plastic, or other solid material. A well-<br>
known example of such a solid projection screen is the movie screen.<br>
However, using the above-mentioned projection screens involves<br>
certain limitations. For example, in different outdoor or indoor perform-<br>
ances, large, temporary projection screens are needed, which must be<br>
assembled and disassembled fast. In certain situations, assembling<br>
and disassembling the projection screens must be carried out also<br>
during an actual performance. The prior art recognizes various non-<br>
solid projection screens that enable more versatile uses compared to<br>
traditional solid projection screens.<br>
US patent publications US 5,067,653, US 5,270,752, US 5,989,128<br>
US 6,092,900, German patent publications DE 476372 and<br>
DE 3130638, Swiss patent publication CH 647605, British patent publication<br>
 GB 2220278, and French patent publication FR 2773229<br>
describe various projection screens formed typically of fog. They<br>
generally describe spraying of fog or steam condensating into fog, or<br><br>
gas planarly from nozzles, wherein images, or the like, can be projected<br>
 on the thereby generated planar fog surface either from the front<br>
of the projection screen or from the back of the projection screen relative<br>
 to the observer.<br>
A problem involved in these projection screens composed of fog, or the<br>
like, is their tendency to disperse, i.e., the planar quality of the projection<br>
 screen deteriorates as the distance grows to the nozzles used in<br>
forming the projection screen. This is due to the friction caused by a<br>
fog flow of the surrounding still air and to the turbulence produced on<br>
the surface of the flow formed by the projection screen as a result of<br>
this. Obviously, as the planar quality of the projection screen deteriorates,<br>
 the image quality deteriorates respectively.<br>
This problem is subject to discussion particularly in the aforementioned<br>
patents US 5,067,653 and US 5,270,752. In said patents, both sides of<br>
the projection screen are provided with air curtains, i.e. air flows that<br>
are parallel with the flow formed by the projection screen, wherein the<br>
task of these air curtains is to limit the fog flow between the air curtains<br>
as planar as possible.<br>
Japanese patent publication JP7056236 introduces a different kind of<br>
solution for maintaining the planar quality of the projection screen. In<br>
the solution introduced in said patent publication the projection screen<br>
is formed by blowing fog or smoke from the nozzles in a manner that<br>
the resulting flow is initially laminar. To keep the flow better in shape, a<br>
separate suction apparatus is arranged on the opposite side relative to<br>
the nozzles to suck the flow forming the projection screen. An aim of<br>
this arrangement is to prevent dispersion of the flow caused by the<br>
projection screen on the stretch between the blow apparatuses and<br>
suction apparatuses.<br>
However, in the aforementioned prior art solutions a significantly more<br>
complicated apparatus structure is needed in forming the projection<br>
screen, among other things, because separate air curtains are formed.<br>
Nevertheless, in spite of the air curtains and/or the separate suction<br>
apparatus, in practice the projection screen always disperses to some<br><br>
extent, thereby deteriorating the image quality. The projection screen<br>
tends to disperse more, the further away the distance to the nozzles:<br>
grows. The larger projection screen is aimed to be produced, the more<br>
difficult it becomes also technically to obtain a planar projection screen.<br>
Moreover, prior art methods are ill suited for producing other kind than<br>
merely planar projection screens. For example, steeply curved cylindrical<br>
 projection screens are difficult to form. Prior art solutions are still<br>
mainly restricted to using fog (water) or smoke in forming the projection<br>
screen. Prior art is also unable to provide functional solutions for<br>
obtaining, in a satisfactory manner, projection volumes and three-<br>
dimensional patterns projected on them.<br>
The main purpose of the present invention is to provide a novel method<br>
for forming a non-solid projection screen or projection volume in- a<br>
manner that the problems present in the above-described prior art<br>
solutions can be reduced or totally prevented.<br>
To attain this purpose, there is disclosed a method for forming a non-solid<br>
projection screen or projection volume, in which method light scattering /<br>
reflecting scattering centers are supplied to and / or produced to a substantially<br>
laminar transfer flow, said light scattering / reflecting scattering centers being<br>
transferred by said transfer flow, wherein the scattering centers are supplied<br>
and / or formed to the transfer flow to the central / inner parts thereof that remain<br>
laminar, away from the direct vicinity of the interface between the transfer flow<br>
and the area surrounding thereof.<br><br>
extent, thereby deteriorating the image quality. The projection screen <br>
tends to disperse more, the further away the distance to the nozzles<br>
grows. The larger projection screen is aimed to be produced, the more<br>
difficult it becomes also technically to obtain a planar projection screen.<br>
Moreover, prior art methods are ill suited for producing other kind than<br>
merely planar projection screens. For example, steeply curved cylindrical<br>
 projection screens are difficult to form. Prior art solutions are still<br>
mainly restricted to using fog (water) or smoke in forming the projection<br>
screen. Prior art is also unable to provide functional solutions for<br>
obtaining, in a satisfactory manner, projection volumes and three-<br>
dimensional patterns projected on them.<br>
The main purpose of the present invention is to provide a novel method<br>
for forming a non-solid projection screen or projection volume in. a<br>
manner that the problems present in the above-described prior art<br>
solutions can be reduced or totally prevented.<br>
To attain this purpose, there is disclosed a method for forming a non-solid<br>
projection screen or projection volume, in which method light scattering /<br>
reflecting scattering centers are supplied to and / or produced to a substantially<br>
laminar transfer flow, said light scattering / reflecting scattering centers being<br>
transferred by said transfer flow, wherein the scattering centers are supplied<br>
and / or formed to the transfer flow to the central / inner parts thereof that remain<br>
laminar, away from the direct vicinity of the interface between the transfer flow<br>
and the area surrounding thereof.<br><br>
form in multi-colour, using conventional movie or video projectors, or<br>
the like.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, material is used that scatters<br>
light in a non-elastic manner, such as phosphorescent or fluorescent<br>
particles, molecules or atoms. Hence, the scattering centres are made<br>
to emit visible light by illuminating and activating them with suitable<br>
radiation having higher energy level, i.e., radiation with shorter wavelength.<br>
 A benefit with this embodiment is that since the light of a certain<br>
wavelength directed to the projection screen or projection volume, for<br>
example ultraviolet light that is invisible to the human eye, activates<br>
visible only certain defined areas in the target, this method can be used<br>
for forming images or three-dimensional patterns that seem to be<br>
floating in the air. Other areas of the projection screen or projection<br>
volume can be arranged, using suitable scattering centres, for example<br>
gas molecules, as scattering centres, to be substantially totally transparent<br>
 in the prevailing surrounding normal light, i.e., invisible to the<br>
observer.<br><br>
The solution of the invention enables forming of projection screens or<br>
projection volumes of scattering centres moving along a gas or fluid<br>
flow, the benefit of said projection screens or projection volumes being,<br>
among other things, that they take a thin and cohesive form and<br>
therefore show good image quality, that the apparatus required to form<br>
them is simple, light-weight and easy to move and use, that the projection<br>
 screen and projection volume is very fast to form and disassemble,<br>
and that also other types of projection screens than planar ones can be<br>
formed.<br>
The solution of the invention allows, while using, e.g., air for forming<br>
the transfer flow and so-called dry fog as the scattering centres, it is<br>
possible to create also walk-through projection screens and projection<br>
volumes useful for example in forming so-called virtual spaces and<br>
rooms (Projection-Based Virtual Environment, Cave Automatic Virtual<br>
Environment). The projection screen constructions of prior art virtual<br>
spaces are very expensive and difficult to form, assemble and amend.<br>
^ The method according to the invention is suitable also for creating<br><br>
various three-dimensional patterns, for three-dimensional visualisation,<br>
for producing special effects and/or staging in different indoor or outdoor<br>
 scenes, or the like.<br>
The following more detailed description of the invention by means of<br>
examples will more clearly illustrate, for anyone skilled in the art,<br>
advantageous embodiments of the invention as well as advantages to<br>
be achieved with the invention in relation to prior art<br>
In the following, the invention will be described in more detail with reference<br>
 to the appended drawings, in which<br>
Fig. 1	illustrates the basic principle of the invention in a perspective<br>
 view when forming a substantially two-dimensional<br>
projection screen,<br>

invention in a perspective view upon creating a three-<br>
dimensional projection volume, and<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates the embodiment according to Fig. 5 seen from a<br>
direction opposite to the flow direction of the transfer flow.<br>
Fig. 1 shows, in a principle manner, one apparatus according to the<br>
invention for forming a projection screen. To form a transfer flow 2 of<br>
gas or fluid as a substantially laminar, i.e., non-turbulence flow, any<br>
suitable solution that is obvious to an expert in the field as such can<br>
also be used. Principles of forming a laminar flow of gas or fluid are<br><br>
very well known from study books of flow technique, and are therefore<br>
not discussed here in more detail.<br>
The projection screen 3 is formed of scattering centres 4 that are either<br>
discharged from a supply means 5 and/or formed of source material/<br>
materials discharged from said supply means 5. The scattering<br>
centres 4 move inside a laminar transfer flow 2 in a manner that the<br>
scattering centres 4 move along the transfer flow 2 in the inner part of<br>
the transfer flow 2, which inner part remains laminar, without drifting to<br>
the vicinity of the interfaces between the transfer flow 2 and the area<br>
surrounding thereof, which interfaces always contain turbulence dispersing<br>
 the transfer flow 2 to some extent. However, the inner parts of<br>
the transfer flow 2, being at a sufficient distance from the aforementioned<br>
 interlaces, keep their flow readily in laminar form, wherein the<br>
projection screen 3 composed of scattering centres 4 remains, in turn,<br>
well in shape.<br>
To form an image on the projection screen 3, a projector 6 projects<br>
light, which scatters from the scattering centres 4 in an elastic or non4<br>
elastic manner, forming the desired image on the projection screen 3.<br>
In the embodiments of the invention that are based on elastic scattering,<br>
 such as the Mie scattering, for example, the projector 6 can be a<br>
movie projector, a video or computer projector, a luminous effect<br>
device, laser device or any other device by which the desired still or<br>
moving image and/or luminous effect could be projected also on an<br>
ordinary solid projection screen, such as movie screen, for example, in<br>
some embodiments of the invention the projector 6 can be also an illuminator, <br>
spotlight, or a corresponding non-imaging light source.<br>
In the methods of the invention that are based on non-elastic scattering,<br>
 such as fluorescence, for example, the projector 6 can be, for<br>
example, a so-called laser projector or also some other laser or UV-<br>
based light source, where, if necessary, a suitable arrangement is<br>
arranged to deflect a beam/beams of light obtained from the light<br>
source to project an image on the projection screen 3.<br><br>
The transfer flow 2 is advantageously formed e.g. of air or water.<br>
it is also possible to provide the device with a suction device 7, wherein<br>
the transfer flow 2 can more readily remain laminar and/or the particles,<br>
drops, or the like, operating as the scattering centres 4 can be<br>
collected preventing them from spreading/accumulating to the environment<br>
 or drifting to block the path of the beam of light from the projector 6.<br>
 The suction device 7 also enables reuse of the scattering centres 4.<br>
in one embodiment of the invention the flow device 1 and the suction<br>
device 7 are connected to each other in a manner that the transfer flow<br>
2 sucked by the suction device 7 is directed along a tube system, or<br>
the like, back to the flow device 1. A benefit of this embodiment is that<br>
while the same flow is hence recirculating in the apparatus, the disturbances<br>
 caused to the surrounding area, such as turbulence caused to<br>
the surrounding area is reduced compared to a situation where the flow<br>
device 1 and/or the suction device 7 discharge the flow continuously<br>
into the surrounding space. Less disturbance directed towards the surrounding<br>
 area also work in favour in keeping the transfer flow in laminar form.<br>
 The scattering centres 4 contained in the transfer flow can be<br>
recycled along with the flow from the suction device 7 back to the flow<br>
device 1, or they can be removed from the flow by filtering prior to<br>
recycling the flow back to the flow device 1.<br>
Fig. 2 depicts, in a principle manner, the apparatus according to Fig. 1<br>
as seen from a direction opposite to the flowing direction of the transfer<br>
flow 2 (flowing direction towards an observer of the image). Fig. 2<br>
shows more clearly than Fig. 1 the basic idea of the invention, i.e.,<br>
even though some turbulence takes place in the interfaces 20 between<br>
the transfer flow 2 and its surroundings, said turbulence does not<br>
extend disturbing effect to the laminar flow of the inner and/or central<br>
part of the transfer flow 2, where the supplied scattering centres 4 thus<br>
constitute a coherent projection screen 3.<br>
In accordance with Figs. 1 and 2, the laminar transfer flow 2 can be<br>
formed either by using one flow device 1, or the transfer flow 2 can be<br><br>
formed also in a manner shown in principle in Fig. 3 by using multiple<br>
flow devices 1 jointly. Upon using a plurality of flow devices 1, the<br>
speed, direction, composition and temperature of the transfer flows 2<br>
caused thereby should be arranged to be as identical as possible,<br>
wherein interfaces that tend to be formed between said transfer flows 2<br>
causing turbulence are prevented. The substantially uniform projection<br>
screen 3 that is now formed by using multiple flow devices 1 can be<br>
formed even very large, if needed.<br>
As opposed to what is shown in the appended Figs 1 to 6, the transfer<br>
flow 2 and the projection screen 3 or projection volume 8 can be naturally<br>
 formed to extend to any direction, for example from down to up, or<br>
vice versa, from one side to another, diagonally, or the like, by directing<br>
the flow device 1 in a suitable manner.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates further an embodiment of the invention where the<br>
laminar transfer flow 2 has been arranged, by a suitable design of the<br>
structures of the flow device 1 and the supply means 5, to a curved<br>
shape in order to form a curved projection screen 3. It is naturally obvious<br>
 that by the design of the structures of the flow device 1 and/or the<br>
supply means 5, it is easy to provide also other forms of non-planar<br>
flows. If necessary, the planar transfer flow 2 can be provided, using<br>
the supply means 5 that is diagonally curved in view of the flowing<br>
direction, with a curved projection screen 3 (in Fig. 4 the cross section<br>
of the flow device 1 is oblong, and the supply means is curved), and it<br>
is also possible to provide the curved transfer flow 2, using a suitable<br>
supply means 5, with a planar projection screen 3.<br>
it is obvious to an expert in the field that multiple flow devices 1 (and<br>
possible suction devices 7) can be placed after each other in the flowing<br>
 direction, wherein projection screens of an arbitrary length can be<br>
formed. In order to form different virtual spaces and rooms, a plurality<br>
of apparatuses of the invention can be installed at suitable places of<br>
the presentation space to form multiple projection screens that are<br>
separate from each other.<br><br>
The particles, or the like, that operate as scattering centres 4, can be<br>
added to the transfer flow 2, for example using carrier gas or fluid<br>
Since the molecules or atoms of gas or fluid operate as scattering<br>
centres 4, they can be supplied in a corresponding manner to the<br>
transfer flow 2, if necessary, by means of the carrier gas or fluid.<br>
It is also possible that the scattering centres 4 are not formed until in<br>
the actual transfer flow 2. Hence, the initial material or materials<br>
needed in the formation of the scattering centres are supplied to the<br>
transfer flow 2, where the initial material/materials react by forming<br>
scattering centres 4. For example, vapour or a mixture of vapour and<br>
air can condensate in the transfer flow 2 to water fog. The formation of<br>
the scattering centres 4 can take place also through some other applicable<br>
 condensation, sublimation or chemical reaction.<br>
The scattering centres 4 can be discharged to the transfer flow 2 from<br>
nozzles of variable forms or, for example, from a perforated or split<br>
tube, or also from another material-releasing organ or structure applicable<br>
 for the present purpose. The supply means 5 that spreads the<br>
scattering centres 4 can constitute a part of the transfer flow 1 that produces<br>
 the transfer flow 2, or it can constitute a separate means at a<br>
suitable position in the direction of the transfer flow 2, further away<br>
from the flow device 1 and/or diagonally in view of the direction of flow,<br>
at a suitable position of the transfer flow 2.<br>
Using non-elastically light scattering material as the scattering centres<br>
4, the wavelength of the radiation emitted by the scattering centres 4<br>
differs from the wavelength of the radiation used for their activation and<br>
has longer wavelength than illuminating radiation.<br>
When using non-elastic scattering, the image formed on the projection<br>
screen 3 s in principle monochromic, the colour being dependent on<br>
the properties of the scattering centres 4 and the wavelength of light<br>
transmitted by a projector 6 used for their activation. If the aim is to<br>
form coloured images, scattering centres 4 that are composed of multiple<br>
 different materials and scatter light in different non-elastic manners<br>
' must be used, a separate partial image being projected for each<br><br>
scattering centre 4 using a suitably selected radiation of exciting wavelength<br>
The non-elastically light-scattering scattering centres 4 can be for<br>
example phosphorescent or fluorescent particles of solid material,<br>
liquid drops, vapour or gas, and they can be illuminated by a suitable<br>
laser projector or other projector 6 that sends ultraviolet light or visible<br>
light. The light transmitted by the projector 6 now activates only desired<br>
areas on the projection screen 3, wherein only these areas emit light<br>
and form the image perceived by the observer. Thus, it is possible to<br>
obtain images of arbitrary shape that can be observed in principle from<br>
any possible angle because now also the actual images are transparent,<br>
 in addition to emission of light. In other words, the light emitted by<br>
the scattering centres 4 activated by the projector 6 does not absorb to<br>
a significant degree to other scattering centres 4, because the wavelength<br>
 of the emitted light differs from the light transmitted by the projector 6,<br>
 and is therefore not suitable for activation of the scattering<br>
centres 4. Thus, using the method according to the invention, it is possible<br>
 in this embodiment to form images, videos, or the like, of objects,<br>
people, and so forth, that appear to be floating in the air.<br>
In projection screens 3 using elastic scattering and formed of fog, or<br>
the like, the actual projection screen tends to become always visible, at<br>
least to some extent, due to the normal lightning of the environment or<br>
other diffused illumination directed to the projection screen or scatter-<br>
ing/reflecting therefrom. In those embodiments of the invention that are<br>
based on non-elastic scattering, the use of suitable scattering centre:*<br>
4, for example gas molecules, makes it possible to arrange the<br>
projection screen 3 in the normal prevailing light of the surrounding<br>
area to be substantially transparent, in other words Invisible to the:<br>
observer, because the light originating from the above-mentioned light<br>
sources is not applicable for activating the scattering centres 4. This<br>
makes it possible also to form multiple projection screens 3 adjacent to<br>
each other in the direction of flow in a manner that the image formed in<br>
a certain projection screen 3 is observed through adjacent projection<br>
screens 3. By selecting the scattering centres 4 for each adjacent<br>
projection screen 3 in a manner that different wavelengths and different<br><br>
projectors/light sources 6 are used for their activation, it is possible to<br>
form a different image for said different projection screens 3 and thus<br>
to achieve a three-dimensional effect. By elaborating this above-<br>
mentioned principle still further three-dimensional projection volumes<br>
can be formed.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate the principle of the invention upon forming a<br>
projection volume instead of a projection screen. A three-dimensional<br>
projection volume 8 is formed of the scattering centres 4 that are discharged<br>
 from the supply means 5 and/or formed of source material/materials<br>
 discharged from said supply means 5. The scattering<br>
centres 4 are allowed to the laminar transfer flow 2 in a plane that is<br>
diagonal in view of the direction of said flow, only to desired locations<br>
(from certain supply means 5) and only at desired moments of time.<br>
This way a three-dimensional pattern, a projection volume 8, moving<br>
along the transfer flow is obtained.<br>
The resolution of the projection volume 8, and that of the three-dimensional<br>
 pattern obtained therewith, is dependent on the quantity, size<br>
and the number density of the supply means, and the time control of<br>
the feeding of the transfer flow 2 of the scattering centres 4. If the aim<br>
is to produce a long unbroken pattern that is axial to the transfer flow, it<br>
is not necessary to carry out exact time control to the supply means 5<br>
{e.g. opening and closing).<br>
The projection volume 8 can be formed either transparent or non-<br>
transparent, wherein, particularly in the latter case, it is possible to<br>
project a desired image or desired surface patterns on the outer surface <br>
of the projection volume 8, if necessary. Nevertheless, it is not<br>
necessary to use surface patterns. When the projection screen 8 is<br>
transparent and when, e.g., using scattering centres 4 that are applicable<br>
 to non-elastic scattering, e.g., fluorescence, the scattering centres 4<br>
can be activated, if so desired, on the whole volume area of the projection<br>
 volume 8, i.e., also inside the three-dimensional pattern formed by<br>
the projection volume 8. Hence, an illuminating volume is formed.<br><br>
Because the pattern formed by means of the projection volume 8<br>
moves along the transfer flow 2, the projector 6 can, if necessary, be<br>
arranged, to deflect the bearn/beams of light obtained from the light<br>
source, to move along the pattern. Thus, for example a surface pattern<br>
projected on the outer surface of said pattern can be made to move<br>
along the pattern.<br>
Scattering centres 4 are supplied to the transfer flow 2, preferably by<br>
means of the supply means 5, such as, e.g., nozzles arranged to<br>
matrix form and controlled by a data processing device, such as a<br>
processor unit or computer.<br>
By means of the projection volume 8, the forms of the three-dimensional<br>
 pattern to be created can be emphasized using illumination from<br>
various directions, i.e., there can be more projectors 6, if needed,<br>
arranged to illuminate the projection volume 8 from various directions.<br>
It is obvious to anyone skilled in the art, that the projection screens 3 or<br>
volumes 8 can be used both indoors and outdoors to substitute a traditional<br>
 screen or, e.g., to create preferably large or otherwise complicated<br>
 projection targets. An image or pattern can be projected from<br>
different sides of the projection screen or projection volume, and the<br>
projector/light source 6 used for producing the image or pattern does<br>
not necessarily need to be perpendicular in view of the planar projection<br>
 screen. The image can, if necessary, be adjusted e.g. optically or<br>
digitally using prior art techniques.<br>
When using air or other harmless gas for forming the transfer flow 2,<br>
and, e.g. dry dust or other risk-free materials as scattering centres 4, it<br>
is possible to bring about walk-through projection screens 3 or projection<br>
 volumes 8.<br>
Using the method and apparatus of the invention, projection targets of<br>
arbitrary form can be created. Curved planes, different points of discontinuity,<br>
 and the like, can be readily brought about by means of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
The method and the apparatus according to the invention can be used<br>
also for producing other surfaces and volumes than those needed for<br>
imaging projection applications. The invention can be applied for<br>
example for producing curtains or other visual obstructions or projection<br>
 screens needed for different illumination purposes.<br>
It is, of course, obvious for anyone skilled in the art that by combining,<br>
in different ways, the methods, modes of operation and device structures<br>
 presented above in connection with different embodiments of the<br>
invention, it is possible to provide various embodiments of the invention<br>
in accordance with the spirit of the invention.<br>
It is, of course, obvious for anyone skilled in the art that the appended<br>
drawings are oniy intended for illustration of the invention, and thus the<br>
structures and components presented therein are not drawn to scale.<br><br>
