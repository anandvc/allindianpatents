				<td>NON STICKY GUM BASE FOR CHEWING GUM<br>
The present invention relates to a gum base formulation without polyvinyl<br>
acetate suitable for the production of a chewing gum with good sensory properties<br>
and good flavour release combined with properties of non-adhesion to hard<br>
surfaces including teeth, dentures and the like typical of formulations containing<br>
polyvinyl acetate,<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
It is known that conventional chewing gum formulations have a wellknown<br>
tendency to stick not only together but also to any solid surface with which<br>
they come into contact.<br>
These formulations comprise synthetic elastomers such as a<br>
polyisobutylene, isobutylene-isoprene copolymer, butadiene-styrene copolymer,<br>
natural gums such as chicle or jelutong, resins such as vegetable and/or<br>
synthesised terpenes and/or giycerol esters of rosin, polyvinyl acetate,<br>
microcrystalline waxes, and adjuvant agents, emulsifiers and technological<br>
auxiliaries.<br>
Once these chewing gums have been chewed and moistened, the entire<br>
edible part is dissolved and ingested while the remaining gum part is highly sticky<br>
not just to teeth and skin but also to floors, bins and any other dry and hard<br>
surfaces.<br>
This adhesion is to due to specific interface forces and depends on the free<br>
energy of the surface: adhesion to surfaces is influenced by the wettahility of the<br>
surface, its surface tension and obviously the nature arid conditions of the solid<br>
surface, i.e. whether it is rough or smooth.<br>
In the past, additives have been identified to minimise the tackiness of<br>
chewing gums.<br>
For instance, Patent Specification US-3 255 018 proposes the use of tannic<br>
acid to reduce the adhesiveness of gum bases. As tannic acid is soluble, however,<br>
it is rapidly extracted and ingested, returning the original adhesive properties to<br>
the gum base; in order, therefore, to prolong and regulate the extraction of the<br>
tannic acid, the use of a tarinic-aeid-based gelatine is disclosed.<br>
Patent Specification US-2 273 425 suggests the use of ethylcellulose,<br>
while Patent Specification US-3 285 750 suggests the use of a polyolefin resin<br>
containing fluorine. Materials such as sulphides, mineral salts of the type of<br>
calcium carbonate, waxes, fats, oils, soaps and starches have also been used with<br>
varying degrees of success to reduce adhesion: Patent Specifications US-2 429<br>
664 and US-3 440 060.<br>
However, the use of anti-adhesive agents not only does not guarantee<br>
success but often creates many problems; they may have an adverse effect on<br>
taste, be costly, cause damage to production lines and, in particular, in some cases,<br>
be so soluble as to be rapidly extracted, giving the gum back its properties of<br>
tackiness..<br>
A proposed alternative to the inclusion of additives with anti-adhesive<br>
properties is to dispose with ingredients normally used in the gum base and in<br>
particular to rule out combinations of ingredients such as natural or synthetic<br>
gums with resins or waxes and to use increased quantities of polyvinyl acetate, a<br>
material which is well known to be non-tacking.<br>
A proposed formulation with reduced tackiness in respect of solid surfaces<br>
is "disclosed, in particular, in Patent Specification US-3 984 574. This patent<br>
discloses a formulation containing 5-35% of an elastomer which may be<br>
poljasobutylene, polyisoprene and isobutylene-isoprene copolymer or butadiene-<br>
•*•«<br>
styrene copolymer; 5-50% of hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable<br>
oils or animal fats; 5-40% of adjuvant agents; over 55% of polyvinyl acetate; over<br>
20% of fatty acids and over 10% of mono or diglycerides of fatty acids.<br>
This patent attributes the lack of adhesion of the chewing gum in particular<br>
to the total exclusion of some conventional ingredients of the gum base such as<br>
the glycerol esters of rosin, natural waxes and gums and. indicates certain<br>
elastomers, partially or totally hydrogenated vegetable oils or animal fats and<br>
adjuvant agents as well as polyvinyl acetate, fatty acids and mono and<br>
diglycerides of fatty acids as the ingredients of a non-tacking formulation.<br>
Although this patent is evidently valid, it is clear that a drastic reduction of<br>
the type of ingredients that can be used in gum base formulations is undoubtedly<br>
limiting for formulators. In practice, if the number of ingredients that can be used<br>
is limited, it is less possible effectively to satisfy the various market requirements<br>
in terms of chewing properties, use of particular flavours, and the production of<br>
different types and formats of finished products.<br>
It is known, in the gum base sector, however, that the use of large<br>
quantities of polyvinyl acetate, with a resulting reduction of some ingredients such<br>
as rosin esters and microcrystalline waxes, gives the gum non-adhesive properties<br>
without precluding the use of other ingredients.<br>
Polyvinyl acetate is a synthetic, hygroscopic homopolymer which, in<br>
combination with other ingredients, provides a non-tacking gum base probably<br>
because, given its hygroscopic nature, it helps to keep the gum moist, thereby<br>
reducing its adhesiveness.<br>
US Patent Specification 4 357 355 relates in particular to a non-tacking<br>
bubble gum containing between 20 and 55% of polyvinyl acetate of high<br>
molecular weight, 8-20% of an elastomer, 8-30% of a plasticiser, between 5 and<br>
25% of adjuvants, 0-20% of fatty acids and other ingredients. The preparation<br>
method disclosed in this patent comprises two-stage processing: the preparation of<br>
a semi-finished product formed by an emulsifier derived from glyceryl of the type<br>
of glyceryl nionostearate, glyceryl triacetate and by polyvinyl acetate in a ratio<br>
varying between 5 and 75%, and the subsequent incorporation of all the other<br>
ingredients of the gum base into this semi-finished product. The preparation of<br>
this semi-finished product allows better dispersion of the polyvinyl acetate into<br>
the gum base, providing it with non-adhesive properties.<br>
US Patent Specification 4 51S 615 also discloses a chewing gum which<br>
does not adhere to teeth, dentures or other dental surfaces with the following<br>
composition: 15 to 45% of polyvinyl acetate with a molecular weight of between<br>
15 000 and 30 000, 10 to 30% of an elastomer, 2 to 10% of an emulsifier, 0.5 to<br>
15% of polyethylene with a molecular weight of 2000, between 0.5 and 10% of<br>
waxes having a melting point of some 76°C, 10 to 40% of plasticiser and 0 to 5%<br>
of adjuvant agents as well as an elastomer solvent chosen from the methyl,<br>
glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of rosin and terpenes in quantities of between 2<br>
and 18%.<br>
In the above-mentioned patent, the essential ingredient is the polyvinyl<br>
acetate of molecular weight of between 15 000 and 30 000 in quantities varying<br>
between 15 and 45% by weight of the base and preferably between 20 and 30%. It<br>
is explicitly disclosed that quantities of polyvinyl acetate of less than 15% make<br>
the gum base non-homogeneous and cause a non-uniform flavour release, while<br>
quantities higher than 45% make the product too plastic. The molecular weight<br>
also seems to have a crucial influence, as a polyvinyl acetate with a molecular<br>
weight of 15 000 or less in particular gives rise to a product which readily breaks<br>
down when chewed.<br>
US Patent Specification 5 437 878 also discloses a chewing gum which<br>
has reduced adhesive properties, using a combination of waxes and elastomers.<br>
The formulations described in particular contain from 16 to 30% of polyvinyl<br>
acetate with a molecular weight of between 7000 and 13 000, from 8 to 18% of<br>
polyisobutylene of low molecular weight, from 1 to 4% of polyisobutylene of<br>
high molecular weight, from 16 to 35% of adjuvant agents, from 1 to 6% of<br>
polyethylene with a mean molecular weight of 2000, from IS to 30% of fats<br>
selected from a group of hydrogenated and/or partially hydrogenated vegetable<br>
oils, from 1 to 6% of emulsifiers and from 2 to 10% of microcrystalline waxes,<br>
while the use of resins of rosin, methyl, glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of rosin<br>
and terpene resins is specifically ruled out since they are responsible, according to<br>
the inventor, for detracting from the desired properties of the gum.<br>
US Patent Specification 6231896 discloses a chewing gum rubber<br>
composition (gum base) that utilizes camosic acid as an anti<xddant stabilizer></xddant>
whereas US Patent application 2003/0124220 discloses a chewing gum rubber<br>
composition that utilizes carnosic acid as an antioxidant stabilizer together with<br>
lecithin as an emulsifier for the carnosic acid.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been unexpectedly discovered by the invention that it is possible to<br>
formulate soft gum bases with a good flavour release, which do not stick to teeth<br>
and/or hard surfaces, which are very similar to high-quality gum bases typically<br>
containing significant quantities of polyvinyl acetate and a small content of other<br>
resins, without the use of polyvinyl acetate or anti-adhesive agents such as tannic<br>
acid, ethylcellulose, or other anti-adhesive materials, without necessarily<br>
excluding any class of compounds typically used in the production of the gum<br>
base, and even with a content of polyterpene resins and rosin esters greater than<br>
the content normally used for non-tacking gums.<br>
The particular feature of these gums lies in the fact that high sensor}'<br>
standards are maintained throughout the chewing profile and excellent antiadhesive<br>
properties are achieved, making it ideal for products in tablet form which<br>
are well known to be difficult to produce with tacking gum bases, even though<br>
formulated without polyvinyl acetate.<br>
DETAILED DBS CRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The gum base formulated by the present invention represents a wellresearched<br>
and careful combination of the classes of ingredients conventionally<br>
used in the production of the gum base.<br>
The only ingredient that has been intentionally excluded from the<br>
formulation is polyvinyl acetate, already widely used for the formulation of nontacking<br>
gums, in order to make the gum base more natural.<br>
The present gum base in particular comprises the following ingredients<br>
expressed as percentages by weight with respect to the total weight of the gum<br>
base<br>
(a) elastomers 5-25%<br>
(b) emulsifiers and/or technological auxiliaries 5-30%<br>
(c) adjuvants 6-50%<br>
(d) vegetable resins and/or vegetable resin esters 20-45%<br>
(e) antionidants 0-2%<br>
i.e. where the percentage sum of the components (a), (b), (c). (d) and. (e) is<br>
100.<br>
The percentage of component (a) is preferably between 8 and 16%, the<br>
percentage of component (b) between 18 and 30%, the percentage of component<br>
(c) between 15 and 40%, the percentage of component (d) between 26 and 41%<br>
and the percentage of component (e) between 0 and 2%.<br>
The elastomers which can be used in the composition of the present gum<br>
base include all the elastomers normally used in the gum base, whether synthetic<br>
such as butadiene-styrene copolymer, polyisobutylene, and isobutylene-isoprene<br>
copolymer, or natural such as chicle, jelutong, balata, guttapercha, lechi caspi,<br>
sorva or a combination thereof: among these, polyisobutylene, isobutyleneisoprene<br>
copolynier and butadiene-styrene copolymer are preferred.<br>
The emulsifiers and/or technological auxiliaries include glyceryl<br>
monostearate, acetylated monoglycerides, hydrogenated coconut, soybean, palm<br>
and cottonseed vegetable oils, lecithin and triacetin, which may be used alone or<br>
in combination with one another.<br>
The adjuvants include calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, talc,<br>
tricalcium phosphate and the like, and a combination thereof is also possible.<br>
The resins and/or resin esters of vegetable origin which can be added to<br>
this formulation are terpene resins such as polymers of cc-pinene, p-pinene or dlimonene,<br>
rosin derivatives such as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated resins,<br>
glycerol esters of natural rosin, pentaerythritol esters with natural rosin, glycerol<br>
esters with partially hydrogenated natural rosin, pentaerythritol esters with<br>
partially hydrogenated natural rosin, methyl esters of hydrogenated rosin, esters of<br>
hydrogenated rosin and glycerol, esters of partially dimerised rosin and glycerol,<br>
esters of polymerised rosin and glycerol esters of tall oil resin acids, which may<br>
be used alone or in combination; polyterpene resins and. glycerol esters with<br>
hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated natural rosin, or mixtures thereof, are in<br>
particular preferred. Even more preferably, component (d) is a combination of<br>
terpene resins and rosin esters.<br>
The antioxidants may include those materials conventionally used in the<br>
composition of the gum base such as butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated<br>
hydroxytolueae, tocopherol, propyl gallate and the like.<br>
Carnosic acid is preferably not used as the antioxidant; more preferably,<br>
lecithin is not used as the emulsifier if carnosic acid is used as the antioxidant.<br>
hi order to explain the novelty of the invention in further detail, examples<br>
of non-adhesive gum base formulations of the present invention are given in<br>

As can be seen from die preceding table, the gum bases of formulae 1 and<br>
2 differs from those of formulae 3 and 4 in the following respects:<br>
lack of polyvinyl acetate making the gum base more natural;<br>
a greater content of terpene resins and rosin esters in the gum bases<br>
of formulae 1 and 2 than in those of formulae 3 and 4,<br>
The lack of adhesiveness of the present invention does not depend on the<br>
inclusion in the mixture of some specific components or special additives which<br>
could be extracted during chewing or which could change the taste and sensory<br>
properties of the product, and the anti-adhesive effect is not obtained by excluding,<br>
classes of compounds normally used in the production of the gum base, but is<br>
ensured by the appropriate combination in the formula described of hydrogenated<br>
vegetable oils and polyterpene resins which are normally excluded from or used in<br>
small quantities in conventional non-tacking formulae.<br>
The gum base as described may be obtained by using one of the<br>
techniques known in the art; in particular, the production method may include the<br>
preparation of semi-processed products containing elastomers, adjuvants.<br>
emulsifiers and the subsequent incorporation of the other ingredients in steamheated<br>
double-wall mixers, single processing in the same mixers or may be<br>
obtained by a continuous process.<br>
The versatility of the gum base of the present invention makes it suitable<br>
for non-tacking formulations of chewing gum, with or without sugar, which may<br>
be produced in different formats: drops, sheets, sticks and dragees and for<br>
formulations of chewing gum in compressed tablet form.<br>
This formulation is also suitable for nutritional and pharmaceutical<br>
products both as a result of its anti-adhesive properties and its natural nature.<br>
In order to assess the efficiency of the new formulation in comparison with<br>
conventional formulae, three unsweetened chewing gum formulations were<br>
prepared xas described below.<br>
The first formulation comprised a gum base for unsweetened chewing gum<br>
of good quality and slightly tacky with respect to the teeth, with polyvinyl acetate<br>
as in Formula 5 below, the second formulation comprised a typical non-tacking<br>
formulation containing polyvinyl acetate as described above under Formula 4 and<br>
the third with the gum base of Formula 1 of the present invention containing<br>
resins other than polyvinyl acetate.<br>
Formula 5:<br>
Elastomers 10-17%<br>
Emulsifiers and/or technological auxiliaries 30-40%<br>
Adjuvants 9-16%<br>
Rosin esters 20-26%<br>
Antioxidants 0-2%<br>
Polyvinyl acetate 10-18%.<br>
These three gum bases were used in the laboratory to produce chewing<br>
gums with the following composition:<br>
Gum base 30%<br>
Polyalcohols 67.8%<br>
Flavouring 2%<br>
Intensive sweeteners 0.2%.<br>
The three samples were chewed by a panel of expert chevvers who<br>
assessed the tackiness, flavour release and entire sensor)' profile of the three<br>
samples.<br>
The panel noted an obvious difference, as regards the tackiness of the<br>
samples with respect to the teeth and paper, between the first product and the<br>
other two products, whereas no difference was noted between the non-tacking<br>
sample containing polyvinyl acetate and the sample containing resins other than<br>
polyvinyl acetate of the present invention.<br>
As further confirmation of the properties of the gum base of the invention,<br>
it was decided to assess its behaviour in products in compressed tablet form.<br>
As is known, these products require non-tacking formulations as the<br>
method of production of chewing gum in tablet form, during its stages of milling,<br>
screening, mixing and in particular compression is very critical. The risk run<br>
during the stages of milling, screening and mixing is that of obtaining powders<br>
with a coarse and non-homogeneous granular size, with milling also becoming<br>
impossible in the worst cases, and in the compression stage the temperature<br>
increase of the punches of the compressor machine emphasises the tacking<br>
tendency of the powder and often makes compression impossible.<br>
A conventional compressed chewing gum formula is as follows:<br>
Gum base 18-30%<br>
Sugar or sweeteners 20-70%<br>
Intensive sweeteners 0.2%<br>
Flavouring ] -2%<br>
Anti-caking agents 0-4%.<br>
A good non-tacking chewing gum formulation has in particular been<br>
obtained by compression of a chewing gum powder with the following<br>
composition included in the range of the examples disclosed in European Patent<br>
Application 02425209.0 filed on 5 April 2002 in the name of the applicants:<br>
Gum base of Formula. 1 30%<br>
Polyalcohols 64.6%<br>
Intensive sweeteners 0.2%"<br>
Anti-caking agents 3.8%<br>
Liquid flavouring 1.4%.<br>
The formulation of gum base 1 described above has no properties of<br>
tackiness during the whole process of production of the tablets: the powder<br>
obtained after the stages of milling, screening and mixing is fine and comparable<br>
and there were no technological problems at the compression stage. The process<br>
yields were comparable to equivalent non-tacking formulations containing<br>
polyvinyl acetate.<br>
In order to assess adhesiveness during chewing and the sensory properties<br>
of the gum base in question, it was decided to use a panel of selected and trained<br>
chewers.<br>
The gum base of the invention was used in the production of chewing gum<br>
tablets according to the formulation set out above.<br>
The tablets prepared using the method as described were compared by the<br>
panel with equivalent formulations of tablets containing polyvinyl acetate and<br>
were chewed for 20 minutes so as to ensure that all the edible ingredients of the<br>
chewing gum were completely dissolved and removed.<br>
At the end of chewing, the panel found no significant differences with<br>
respect to the lack of adhesiveness of the two samples. The two samples were<br>
judged not to be significantly different from the point of view of their sensor}'<br>
properties, in particular as regards their adhesion to teeth and dentures and their<br>
flavour release.<br>
CONCLUSIONS<br>
The gum base formulations described in this invention do not adhere to<br>
teeth, dentures and paper and can be incorporated into any chewing gum<br>
composition, in any format with or without sugar, in place of all the non-tacking<br>
gum base formulations containing significant quantities of polyvinyl acetate as<br>
they have the same sensory properties and the same technological properties.<br><br><br><br><br>
