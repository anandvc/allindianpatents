Rapid Resolution Process of Clopidogrel Base and a Process for Preparation of Clopidogrel Bisulfate Polymorph - Form I<br>
Technical Field:<br>
The present invention relates to a rapid resolution process of racemic clopidogrcl base followed by conversion of the resolved (S) isomer to crystalline Clopidogrcl bisulfate Form I. Clopidogrel bisulfate [Formula I] |Mcthyl (S)-( i )-u-<o-chlorophenyl i hydrogen sulfate is an antithrombotic agent.></o-chlorophenyl><br><br>
H2S04.<br><br>
Formula I<br>
Background and Prior Art:<br>
Clopidogrel is administrated as its hydrogensulfatc (syn. Bisulfate) salt. Its antiplatelet activity makes it an effective drug for reducing ischemic strokes, heart attacks and in atherosclerosis (a vascular disease causing claudication!. Atherosclerosis is a buildup of plaque in the walls of arteries, which leads to thickening, and the reduction in the elasticity of the arteries. High Cholesterol. high blood pressure, smoking and infection also causes an injury to the inner walls of the arteries, which leads to the atherosclerosis. The plaque formation leads to<br><br>
2<br>
blood clotting which is due to the platelet aggregation at the site of the injury. This clotting becomes an obstacle for the flow of the blood to the vital organs causing heart attacks or other severe problems.<br>
Antiplatelet activity which fights against Atherosclerosis is exhibited by Clopidogrel, which binds adenosine diphosphate to its receptor and thereby induces platelet reduction, which is desirable in fighting against atherosclerosis. Clopidogrel has found to be more effective in inhibiting platelet aggregation than aspirin and is also mild towards gastrointestinal tract. (S) enantiomcr of clopidogrel is pharmaceutically active and is administrated as bisulfate salt.<br>
U.S.Pat.No. 4, 529,596, discloses a racemic mixture of clopidogrcl bisulfate and process for preparation of such mixture, which involves condensation reaction between methyl-2-chloro-o-chlorophenylacetate and 4,5.6,7-tctrahydro thieno[3,2-c] pyridine. The reaction produces racemic clopidogrel.<br>
U.S.Pat. No. 4,847,265 discloses process for preparation of the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of the clopidogrel bisulfate. Racemic clopidogrel is resolved using camphor sulfonic acid to obtain optically pure dextro rotatory isomer. The patent describes the crystallization of the (S) enantiomer using dimethylformamide. ketones and alcohols. Amongst ketones, acetone is used for crystallization<br>
U.S.Pat. No. 5,036,156, discloses a method for preparation of an intermediate in the synthesis of clopidogrel, 2-chloro-a-bromophenyl acetic acid and a process for condensing methyl ester with tetrahydrothienopyridine. The patent also describes process for preparation of pyridine derivative, which is one of the intermediate for preparation of clopidogrel.<br>
U.S.Pat. No. 6,080,875 describes a process for preparation of methyl (+)-(S)-a-(2-thienyl-2-ethylamino)- a -{2-chlorophenyl)acetate hydrochloride by reaction of<br><br>
3<br>
sodium-2-thienylglycidate with (S) 2-chloro phenyl glycine in presence of cyanoborohydride. This intermediate is further used to prepare (S) clopidogrel. The patent also describes the process for recemization of phenyl glycine esters. U.S.Pat. No. 6,180,793 describes a process for preparation of (S) clopidogrel by reaction of 2-thiophene ethanol with (S)-2-chlorophenyl glycineamidc, (S)-2-chlorophenyl-a-amino acetonirile or (S)-2-chlorophenyl glycine methyl ester. The resulting compound is cyclised, hydrolysed and esterified.<br>
U.S.Pat. No. 5, 204, 469 discloses enantioselective process for preparation of clopidogrel through the reaction of (+) -2-chlorophenyl glycine and an activated form of 2-thiophene ethanol followed by cyclization with formaldehyde.<br>
U.S.Pat. No. 6800759 describes a process for resolution of racemic clopidogrel, along with the conversion of (R) enantiomer of the clopidogrel to (S). The (S) enatiomer is separated by crystallizing it as camphor sulfonate salt from hydrocarbon, or a mixture of hydrocarbon and a co-solvent, preferably DMF:Toluene. The (R) enantiomer is then racemized and recycled by reaction with catalytic amount of base. The bases used are metal alkoxide. preferably potassium-t-butoxide.<br>
U.S.Pat. No. 4,847,265 describes the formation of the dextrorotatory isomer of clopidogrel by salt formation using racemic compound and an optically active acid such as 10-L-camphorsulfonic acid in acetone, followed by successive recrystallisation until a product with constant rotatory power was obtained, followed by the release of the dextro rotatory isomer from its salt by a base. The hydrogen sulfate salt is then obtained by dissolution of the base in acetone cooled in ice and addition of concentrated sulphuric acid to precipitation. The precipitate thus obtained is crystalline Form I.<br><br>

WO 98/39286 discloses racemization process for phenyl glycine ester in which a mixture of enantiomer of phenyl glycine ester is treated with a carbonyl compound in presence of carboxylic acid and single enantiomer of an N-protected-a-amino acid as a resolving agent. The formation of the imino intermediate causes the racemisation of the starting product and the precipitation of the single diastereomeric salt.
