				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to oxapenem compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their medical uses.<br>
ß-lactam antibiotics (for example penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems) are well-known for treatment of bacterial infections, but their prolonged use is associated with increased bacterial resistance.<br>
The principal mechanism of bacterial resistance is by ß-lactamases. There are four classes of ß-lactamase, known as classes A to D. Clinically, class A and class C ß-lactamases are the most important. Combination therapy utilising a ß-lactam antibiotic and a ß-lactamase inhibitor has proven successful at counteracting some forms of resistance. Known combination products are, for example, Tazocim (RTM) which is a combination of piperacillin antibiotic and tazobactam inhibitor, and Augmentin (RTM), a combination of amoxycillin antibiotic and clavulanic acid inhibitor. However, tazobactam and clavulanic acid are only effective against class A ß-lactamases, leaving their antibiotic partners unprotected against class B, D and, most importantly, class C ß-lactamases.<br>
Although ß-lactamase inhibitors with activity against the class C ß-lactamases are known, to date there is no commercially available "broad spectrum" inhibitor active against both class A and C ß-lactamases.<br>
EP 0 301394 discloses a wide variety of oxapenem compounds which are antibacterial agents. EP 0 362622 discloses oxapenem compounds which are broad spectrum ß-lactamase inhibitors, highly active against class A, class<br><br>
C and class D ß-lactamases. EP 0 548790 discloses that the stereochemistry of a chiral side chain on the 6-carbon of the oxapenem structure has a marked effect on in vitro ß-lactamase inhibitory activity. Compounds having a (l'S)-l-hydroxylalkyl side chain, with opposite configuration to that of thienamycin, show increased in vitro activity against TEM 1 ß-lactamase from E.Coli, a common class A ß-lactamase. None of the above documents give evidence of particular in  vivo  activity.<br>
It is also important to achieve sufficiently high blood levels and long biological half-lives of ß-lactams to treat bacterial infections. With traditional ß-lactam antibiotics, e.g in the Cephalosporin field this problem has been solved with compounds such as Ceftazidime and Ceftriaxon (in vivo biological half lifes in human serum 1.7 - 2.1 hrs and 5.8 -8.7 hrs resp.). In contrast, the corresponding in vivo biological half-lives of non-traditional li-lactams, e.g. the carbapenems Imipenem and are much shorter (0.9 and 1.0 hrs). The in vivo half life of Clavulanate is (0.7 - 1.4 hrs) . A relatively long biological half-life is very important for the practical applicability of antibiotics and ß-lactamase inhibitors.<br>
The present applicants have found that several novel compounds within the broadest generic disclosure of EP 0 362622 display surprisingly high bioavailability, and superior activity against class A and class C ß-lactamases. Furthermore, they have found that they exhibit unexpected and superior stability in blood serum which may lead to increased blood levels and increased biological half life.<br>
According to the present invention in a first aspect there is provided an oxapenem compound which is, or is capble of forming, a zwitterion of formula la or lb:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is a C1-C8 branched or straight chain aikyl group which includes a protonated basic substituent.<br>
Preferably the protonated basic substituent is a protonated nitrogen base. More preferably the protonated basic substituent is a protonated amine or protonated aminomethyleneamino substituent.<br>
Preferred compounds are those of formula la wherein R is -(CH2)4NH3+ (hereinafter referred to as Compound E); R is -(CH2)3NH3+ (hereinafter referred to as Compound PFOB); R is -{CH2)2NH3+ (hereinafter referred to as Compound A); R is -(CH2)2NHCH:NH2+ (hereinafter referred to as Compound B) ; or R is -CH2NHCH:NH2+(hereinafter referred to as Compound D) .<br>
It will be appreciated that the protonation of Nitrogen in the R groups of B and D shown above can take place at either Nitrogen. Thus B and D may also be represented by formula la wherein R is - (CH2) 2NH2+CH:NH and -CH2NH2+CH:NH.<br>
Also preferred is the compound of formula lb wherein R is - (CH2)3NH3+(hereinafter referred to as YOB).<br>
It will be appreciated that there is an equilibrium between the compounds of the invention in their zwitterionic form (i.e. when the basic (e.g. amine) group has been protonated and the carboxylic acid group deprotonated) and their  "non  ionic"  form  (when  base  (e.g.  amine)  and<br><br>
carboxylic acid groups are neutral) . The "non ionic" forms of the compositions, and equilibrium mixtures of zwitterionic and "non ionic" forms, are all within the scope of the invention. Thus, "an oxapenem compound which is capable of forming a zwitterion" includes oxapenem compounds in the "non ionic" form, that is oxapenem compounds of Formula Ia or Formula Ib wherein the C02- has been protonated to C02H, and the "protonated basic group" or "protonated nitogen base" on the R group has been deprotonated. Examples of oxapenem compounds which are capable of forming a zwitterion are compounds of Formula la wherein the C02- has been protonated to C02H and the R groups are -(CH2)4NH2, -<br>
(CH2)3NH2, -(CH2)2NH2,-(CH2)2NHCH:NH, or -CH2NHCH:NH; and compounds of Formula lb wherein the C02- has been protonated to C02H and the R group is -(CH2)3NH2.<br>
Further, "an oxapenem compound which is capable of forming a zwitterion" also includes mixtures of the oxapenem compounds in both the zwitterionic and "non ionic" forms.<br>
The applicants have found that the combination of: (a) particular stereochemistry at positions 5 and 6 of the oxapenem double ring structure; and (b) the particular zwitterionic structure (or the capability of being able to form such a zwitterionic structure); gives compounds with remarkable bioavailability and wide spectrum of activity.<br>
The claimed compounds show remarkably high bioavailability compared to known compounds. The compounds show remarkable activity against class A and C ß-lactamases . Compound YOB in particular shows remarkably high activity and selectivity against class A ß-lactamases.<br>
The compounds described in this invention and ß-lactam antibiotics are active against a wide range of Gram-positive<br><br>
(staphylococci, streptococci) and Gram-negative (enterobacteriaceae, non-fermentative species) bacteria responsible for infections of the urinary tract, respiratory tract, wounds and intra-abdominal sepsis. The oxapenem compound and antibiotic may be administered concurrently (for example as a mixture), or, for example, as separate medicaments. The oxapenem and antibiotic may be administered at different times.<br>
According to the invention in a further aspect there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmacologically effective amount of an oxapenem compound according to the first aspect of the invention. Preferred pharmaceutical compositions further comprise a pharmacologically effective amount of an antibiotic. The antibiotic may be a ß-lactam antibiotic (e.g. ceftazidime) .<br>
According to the invention in a still further aspect there is provided a method of treatment of infection comprising a step of administering to a patient in need thereof a pharmacologically effective amount of a zwitterion of formula la or lb:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is a C1-C8 branched or straight chain alkyl group which includes a protonated basic substituent. Preferably the protonated basic substituent is a protonated nitrogen base. Preferably the protonated basic substituent is a protonated   amine   or   protonated   aminomethyleneamino<br><br>
substituent. The method may further comprise a step of administering to the patient a pharmacologically effective amount of an antibiotic. The oxapenem compound and antibiotic may be administered concurrently, or at different times.<br>
The treatment may be by ß-lactamase inhibition.<br>
Preferably, the method is for treatment of infections of the urinary tract, respiratory tract, wounds and intra¬abdominal sepsis. The patient may be a human or animal patient.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated with reference to the drawings in which:<br>
Fig.l shows plasma blood levels of oxapenem analogues following subcutaneous administration at 50 mg per kg in mice; and<br>
Fig.2 shows schematic diagram of the synthesis of a compound embodying the invention (PFOB) from a commercially available compound.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Over 4 0 oxapenem analogues have been synthesised and tested in vitro. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies have identified functions for various parts of the oxapenem molecule with respect to chemical stability, target binding affinity, antibacterial activity and spectrum and extent of ß-lactamase inhibition. It has not been possible to predict bioavailability from structure studies.<br>
We  have  synthesised and  tested several oxapenem<br>
compounds, known as PFOB, YOB, A, E, B, D, U and XOB.  Their<br>
structures are shown in Table 1.  It can be seen that PFOB,<br><br>
YOB, E, B, D and A are embodiments of the present invention. The syntheses are discussed below.<br>
Table 1 : Structures of Oxapenem Compounds<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
A. Pharmacokinetic Testing<br>
The plasma blood levels in mice (mean of 3 per time point) of compositions XOB, YOB, PFOB and YOB were measured at time points of 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes following sub¬cutaneous (SC) administration at a dose of 50 mg per kg. The results are shown in Table 2 and illustrated in Fig.l.<br>
?-<br><br>
Table 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It can be clearly seen from the plasma blood levels at all time points that following sub-cutaneous administration, the compounds of the invention (zwitterionic compounds PFOB and YOB) have remarkably superior bioavailability when compared with salts XOB and U. Further, it should be noted that the only difference between PFOB and U, and YOB and XOB, is the amine substituted chain (instead of methyl group) in compounds PFOB and YOB. The amine substituted chain allows the zwitterionic structure. Thus, the compositions are extremely suitable for use in hospitals in i.p. and s.c administration regimes.<br>
B.  In Vitro Activity in Combination with Ceftazidime<br>
The assays to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) were performed by Agar dilution according to NCCLS guidelines (2000) . In the following data the lowest. MIC shows the strongest activity.<br>
Class A B-lactamases<br>
Ceftazidime alone (CAZ), and a 2:1 ratio of ceftazidime with each of PFOB, YOB, U and XOB (CAZ + PFOB, CAZ+YOB, CAZ+U and CAZ+XOB) were each tested against a variety of Class A ß-lactamases.  The results are shown in Table 3.<br><br>
Table 3: Inhibitory Activity vs Class A ß-lactamases<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It can be seen that against E.coli TEM-3, TEM-6, TEM-9 and TEM-10 all of the oxapenems, when used in combination with CAZ, show markedly superior activity compared to CAZ alone.<br>
YOB, a composition according to the invention, shows remarkable activity when compared to XOB (a structurally and stereochemically close composition which is not a zwitterion). This is particularly well demonstrated by the MIC values against E.coli ATCC 25922 and TEM-1 for YOB (0.03 and 0.06) when compared to those for XOB (0.25 and 0.25). It is noted that the MIC values against TEM-9 and TEM-10 also show superiority.<br>
Class C B-lactamases<br>
Ceftazidime alone (CAZ), and a 1:1 ratio of ceftazidime with each of PFOB, YOB, U and XOB (CAZ + PFOB, CAZ+YOB, CAZ+U and CAZ+XOB) were each tested againsr a variety of Class C B-lactamases.  The results are shown in table 4.1.<br><br>
Table 4.1: Inhibitory Activity vs Enterobacterlacaeae   de-repressed Class C ß-lactamases<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It can be seen that against all organisms all of the oxapenems, when used in combination with CAZ, show superior activity compared to CAZ alone.<br>
PFOB, a composition according to the invention, shows remarkable activity when compared to U (a structurally and stereochemically close composition which is not a zwitterion) . This is demonstrated by the MIC values against E. cloacae 84-con , C Freundii C2-con and S marcescens S2-con for PFOB (4, 0.03 and 0.03, respectively) when compared to those for U (8, 2 and 0.25). It is also noted that the MIC value for YOB against S marcescens S2-con is markedly superior to that of XOB.<br>
Ceftazidime alone (CAZ), and a 2:1 ratio of ceftazidime with each of PFOB, YOB, U and XOB (CAZ + PFOB, CAZ+YOB, CAZ+U and CAZ+XOB) were each tested against a variety of Class C ß-lactamases.  The results are shown in table 4.2.<br><br>
Table 4.1: Inhibitory Activity vs Enterobacteriacaeae de-repressed Class C ß-lactamases (Ratio 2:1)<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Once again PFOB, an embodiment of the invention, shows remarkable activity when compared to U (a structurally and stereochemically close composition which is not a zwitterion). This is demonstrated by comparison of the MIC values against E. cloacae Hennessy, E. cloacae 84-con and C Freundii C2-con for PFOB (4,4 and 2, respectively) with those for U (8, 16 and 4) . It is also noted that the MIC value for YOB against C. freundii C2-con is superior to that of XOB.<br>
Summary<br>
It can be seen that the compositions embodying the invention have a remarkable combination of superior bioavailability combined with "broad spectrum" activity against both class A and C ß-lactamases.<br>
There is no simple prediction of dependence or relationship between activity of the compound and the stereochemistry of the substituent at C-6: U and PFOB have the (l'R)-1-hydroxyethyl side chain while XOB and YOB have the  (1'S)-1-hydroxyethyl  side  chain.     The  superior<br><br>
activities of PFOB and YOB could not have been predicted.<br>
C.l Chemical Stability of XOB and YOB<br>
The half-lives of hydrolysis were determined at 37 °C in physiological phosphate buffer pH 7.4 by UV spectroscopy at 265 run at a 10-4 M concentration of oxapenem<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
C.2 Stability of XOB and YOB in blood serum<br>
The blood serum stability was determined microbiologically using an agar diffusion test with Escherichia coli TEM 1 (penicillin resistant). The oxapenems were incubated with sterile bovine serum (OXOID) at 37 °C in 0.033 % concentration. At 0 h, 1.5 h, 3 h, 4.5 h and 6 h intervals aliquot samples (30 ml) were spotted on commercial filter disk (OXOID) containing piperacillin (75 mg) and the remaining amounts of active ß-lactaraase inhibitor (oxapenem) were calculated from the observed decreasing inhibition diameters (27 - 12 mm) in comparison with those obtained (24 - 0 mm) obtained with piperacillin (75 mg) disks spotting various amounts (10 mg, 5 mg, 2.5 mg, 1.25 mg, 0 mg) of ß-lactamase inhibitor.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Thus, the zwitterionic compound YOB is far more stable than XOB in blood serum, whereas, in contrast, the chemical stability of the two compounds are practically equal. This surprising increase of stability in blood serum of the zwitterionic  oxapenem  YOB  (when  compared  to  XOB,  a<br><br>
structurally and stereochemically close composition which is not a zwitterion) is most significant and important. This stability gives high blood levels and long biological half-life and hence a superior ability for treating bacterial infections in human and veterinary therapy.<br>
D. Synthesis of Compound PFOB, A, E, and YOB<br>
D.l Synthesis of (5R, 6R, 1 'R) -3- (4-amino-l ,1-dimethylbutyl) -6- (1' -hydroxyethyl) -7-oxo-4-oxa-l-azabicyclo [3 .2.0]hept-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid [PFOB]<br>
The synthesis described below is shown schematically in Figure 2 of the attached drawings.<br>
To a 35 L Pfaudler vessel (GLMS) was charged acetonitrile (16.7   kg)    and   (3R, 4R)-4-(acetoxy)-3-[(1R)-l-[ [ (1, 1-dimethylethyl) dimethylsilyl] oxy] ethyl] -2-azetidinone  (3.34 kg, 11.6 moles). To the header flask was charged 21% sodium methyl mercaptan (5.8 L, 17.4 moles, 1.5 equivalents). This was added to the batch at 15-20 °C (cooling required to control exotherm) over two hours. The batch was then stirred for 1 hour after which time TLC analysis showed completion. The lower aqueous phase was discharged and the product (acetonitrile) phase washed with 6.7L 20% brine prior to being stripped to dryness on a rotary evaporator (20 L) . The crude product was then crystallised from hexane (13.3 L) cooling to 0 °C from reflux. The crystalline product was filtered and washed with hexane (1 L) . Vacuum drying afforded compound III of Fig 2 (2.49kg, 78%)  m.p. 93 °C as white needles.<br>
To a 20 L vessel (glass) was charged THF (8.25L) followed by compound (III) (1.65 kg, 6.0 moles) . The batch was cooled to -4 0 °C and 2.5 M butyl lithium (2.4 L) charged at 
 <br>
(typically -45 to -35 °C) , over 1 hour. This was allowed to come to -25 °C. To a second vessel was charged THF (4.1L) and para-nitrobenzyl iodoacetate (1.92 kg, 6.02 moles) which was then cooled to - 10 °C. The solution of compond (III) was then to transferred to the second solution whilst maintaining temperature 
A THF solution (3.54L) containing approximately 40% compound IV,  (1292g,  2.76 moles)  is  stripped to  KF
To 25 kg of flash silica made up with approx 50 L toluene was charged material (from three batches of the above reaction) dissolved in 20% hexane in toluene (20 L). This was eluted under 0.5 bar pressure to load the material onto the column and recycled, until fronts began to appear (Fraction 1). A<br><br>
small amount of fronts was separated in this fraction and discarded. The following fractions were then eluted;<br>
Fractions 2-4	Toluene (25 L each)<br>
Fractions 5-6	6% Ethyl Acetate in Toluene (25 L each)<br>
Fractions 7-8	8% Ethyl Acetate in Toluene (25 L each)<br>
Fractions 9-10	10% Ethyl Acetate in Toluene (25 L each)<br>
The fractions containing product were then stripped to a volume of 25 L of a 13.5% solution of compound V of Fig 2 (3.51kg, 68%)<br>
A tetrahydrofuran solution of compound V was stripped on a rotary evaporator until an oil (4.44kg, containing 3.2kg compound V, 5.15mol, including some THF). This oil was re-dissolved in THF (10.75L) to form a final solution (KF 0.0326%). This was charged to the 100L vessel, followed by acetic acid (2.98L) and tetra-n-butyl-ammonium fluoride (5.36kg, 17.13mol) and more THF (21.5L) . This was accompanied by some foaming during charging. The batch was heated until at reflux (65°C) and then held at close to reflux for 16 hours. Sampling for TLC analysis showed only a trace amount of starting material. Toluene (32L) was added and the vessel contents were cooled to 20°C, prior to quench with 1M potassium bicarbonate solution (27L) over 15 minutes with frothing again.<br>
The organic phase was washed with 1M potassium bicarbonate solution (2 x 27L) , 10 % brine (4 x 11L) and 20% brine solution (3L) . This washing regime was to ensure the thorough removal of acetic acid.<br>
The toluene solution was stripped to a volume of approximately 5L and stored in a freezer whilst a second batch was prepared giving a further 4.2kg of crude product.<br><br>
The crude material was purified by dry flash column chromatography using nitrogen pressure (0.5bar).<br>
To a 30cm diameter column was charged a slurry of flash silica (Chrogel Silica I 254, 25kg) in toluene (50L), giving a bed depth of 80cm after settling. The toluene was eluted until the silica was partially dry. The crude product from above (8.5kg) was dissolved in toluene (20L) and charged to the silica and loaded onto the column using nitrogen pressure. The product was then eluted with the following solvent mixtures.<br>
100% toluene	50L<br>
toluene:ethyl	acetate (98:2)	75L<br>
toluene:ethyl	acetate (95:5)	25L<br>
toluene:ethyl	acetate (80:20)	100L<br>
toluene:ethyl	acetate (70:30)	50L<br>
toluene :ethyl	acetate (60:40)	50L<br>
toluene:ethyl	acetate (60:40)<br>
+ 0.5% isopropanol	50L<br>
The following fraction sizes were collected -<br>
Fraction	Number      Fraction Size<br>
1-7	25L<br>
8-12	5L<br>
13 - 20	25L<br>
Concentration in vacuo on a 20L rotary evaporator afforded compound VI of Fig 2 as a pale red-orange oil, (single spot by TLC, 4.004kg, 7.88mol, 76.5%).<br>
To a 2L flask was charged dichloromethane (1.02L) and methyl disulphide (398g, 4.23mol). A radical scavenger (3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-5-methylphenylsulphide, 1.85g, 0.005mol) was then charged and the batch cooled to -35°C. Chlorine gas<br><br>
(296g, 8.35mol) was sparged into the solution over 2 hours, resulting in an orange solution of the methyl sulphenyl chloride.<br>
This solution was added to a 20L flask containing dichloromethane (11.4L) and compound VI (4.97kg of a 38.2% solution in dichloromethane, 1.9kg active, 3.74mol) at -25°C to -15CC over 25 minutes. The batch was then stirred at -25°C for 20 minutes. When the reaction was complete, as indicated by TLC (absence of starting material), the batch was quenched in a 50L flask containing a solution of sodium hydrogen sulphite (1.196kg) and sodium hydrogen carbonate (0.975kg) in water (23L). The phases were separated and the aqueous phase back-extracted witn dichloromethane (1.5kg, 2L) . The combined organic phases were washed with saturated brine solution (6L) and dried over magnesium sulphate (1kg) before concentration in vacuo to an oil on a 20L rotary evaporator to yield compound VII of Fig 2 as a crude red oil (1.74kg, 3.51mol, 93.7 % crude yield) which was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (2.71kg) and stored at -30°C for use in the next stage.<br>
Compound VII (1.028kg) was concentrated in  vacuo  leaving a crude oil, which was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (9.5kg, 10.6L, KF value = 0.02%) and charged to a 20L flask. The flask was then cooled back to
