				<td>Description<br>
Annular flow duct for a turbomachine through which a main flow<br>
can flow in the axial direction<br>
The invention relates to a flow duct for a compressor, which<br>
flow duct is arranged concentrically about a machine axis<br>
running in the axial direction and, for axially guiding a main<br>
flow, is bounded by a boundary wall of circular cross section,<br>
the boundary wall having a plurality of return flow passages<br>
which are distributed over its circumference and through which<br>
in each case a partial flow which can be detached from the main<br>
flow at a bleed position can be returned to the main flow at a<br>
feed position situated upstream of the bleed position, and<br>
having aerofoils, arranged radially in the flow duct, of a<br>
blade collar, the aerofoil tips of which lie opposite the<br>
boundary wall, with a gap being formed in each case.<br>
Gas turbines and the modes of operation thereof are generally<br>
known. The air drawn in by a compressor of the gas turbine is<br>
compressed therein and afterwards mixed with fuel in a burner.<br>
Subsequently, the mixture flowing into a burning chamber burns<br>
to form a hot gas which subsequently flows through a turbine<br>
arranged downstream of the burning chamber and in the meantime,<br>
owing to the relaxation thereof, causes the rotor of the gas<br>
turbine to rotate. The rotation of the rotor drives, in<br>
addition to the compressor, also a generator which is linked to<br>
the rotor and converts the mechanical energy provided into<br>
electrical energy.<br>
Both the compressor and the turbine are each composed of a<br>
plurality of successive stages each comprising two successive<br>
collars of blades. A turbine stage is composed of a guide blade<br>
collar formed by rotationally fixed guide blades and a moving<br>
blade collar arranged downstream thereof, whereas a compressor<br>
stage is composed of a moving blade collar and<br>
a guide blade collar arranged downstream thereof; viewed in<br>
each case in the flow direction of the medium flowing through.<br>
In the case of a single-shaft gas turbine, all moving blades<br>
are fixedly mounted on the common rotor.<br>
The compressor stages, which are arranged in series, i.e. in<br>
axial succession, convey, owing to the moving blades revolving<br>
with the rotor, the drawn-in air from the input of the<br>
compressor in the direction of the compressor output, the air<br>
experiencing an incremental rise in pressure within each stage<br>
(or collar). The total rise in pressure over the compressor is<br>
the sum of all incremental pressure rises over each stage (or<br>
of all collars).<br>
In a known manner, it can occur during operation of the gas<br>
turbine, in particular during operation of the compressor of<br>
the gas turbine, that, on approaching the stability limit,<br>
recirculation is increased as a result of defective flow and<br>
growing gap vortex. Within the compressor, this can cause a<br>
stall on one or more aerofoils, i.e. the flow of air in the<br>
main flow direction stops through a part of a compressor stage,<br>
as the energy transmitted from the rotor to the air is not<br>
sufficient to convey said air through the compressor stage and<br>
to establish the required pressure ratio of the compressor<br>
stage in question. The pressure ratio is the increase in<br>
pressure occurring over the relevant stage of the compressor,<br>
based on the input pressure of the respective stage. If the<br>
stall is not immediately counteracted, it can advance to form a<br>
rotating stall and possibly even lead to the entire flow of air<br>
through the compressor changing its direction; this is known as<br>
compressor pumping. This particularly critical operating state<br>
jeopardizes the blades and prevents a sufficient supply of<br>
compressor air to the burning chamber, so that a disturbed<br>
operation of the gas turbine must be diagnosed and the machine<br>
switched off immediately.<br>
For this purpose, EP 0 719 907 A1, which seeks to counteract<br>
the described problem, discloses a structured boundary wall<br>
which lies opposite the tips of the moving blades. This<br>
structuring of the casing, known as the casing treatment,<br>
serves positively to influence the flow close to the gap for<br>
situations in which there is a risk of a stall on an aerofoil.<br>
Owing to the structuring, partial flows are bled from the main<br>
flow in the region of low flow velocities and subsequently<br>
returned to the main flow upstream of the bleed position. The<br>
air bled on the pressure side of the compressor blades in the<br>
tip region is supplied to the suction-side main flow of the<br>
compressor blade in question to prevent a stall which might<br>
occur there. The ducts guiding the partial flows are<br>
accordingly inclined relative to the machine axis or axis of<br>
rotation in such a way that - viewed in the direction of<br>
rotation of the rotor - the bleed position lies after the feed<br>
position at which the detached partial flow is returned to the<br>
main flow close to the gap. This is required so that, owing to<br>
the stagger angle and the tips, positioned obliquely relative<br>
to the direction of rotation, of the aerofoils, the partial<br>
flow can be guided beyond the aerofoil tip from the pressure<br>
side to the suction side. Thus, the longitudinal extension of<br>
the return flow duct is oriented substantially transversely to<br>
the straight line of the blade tip-side stagger angle, i.e.<br>
approximately parallel to the machine axis.<br>
A similar device is known from EP 1 286 022 Al.<br>
The aforementioned configurations have the drawback that the<br>
flow guidance of the partial flows is not optimal.<br>
Furthermore, FR 2 325 830 discloses a compressor casing with<br>
grooves formed therein. These grooves are intended to prevent a<br>
stall of the limit flow and thus the pumping of the<br>
compressor, although the flow set by the grooves does not flow<br>
counter to the main flow, but rather with it.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a flow duct, of<br>
annular cross section, of a compressor, the casing treatment of<br>
which achieves a further improvement in the operating range of<br>
the compressor and a reduction in the tendency of the<br>
compressor toward stalls.<br>
The invention provides a generic flow duct, suitable for<br>
influencing the flow close to the gap, for a turbomachine<br>
through which a flow flows preferably axially, wherein - viewed<br>
in the direction of rotation of the aerofoils - the bleed<br>
position of each return flow region lies before the<br>
corresponding feed position. The same applies to an inner<br>
boundary wall as part of the rotor, which wall moves relative<br>
to the free-standing ends of the aerofoils of guide blades.<br>
The invention proposes that the longitudinal extension of the<br>
return flow regions and the stagger angle of the tip of the<br>
aerofoils do not, relative to the machine axis, intersect at a<br>
comparatively large angle and thus run transversely to each<br>
other, but rather that the longitudinal extension of the return<br>
flow passages and the stagger angle of the aerofoil in the tip<br>
region are inclined almost identically relative to the machine<br>
axis, so that they can run approximately parallel. The<br>
invention starts from the finding that the inflow direction of<br>
the partial flows in the relative system of the direction of<br>
rotation of the aerofoils is not optimally coordinated with one<br>
another. It is no longer assumed that the partial flow, bled<br>
through the return flow region for influencing the suction-side<br>
flow of an aerofoil, does not have to be bled from its pressure<br>
side and guided via the tip of the aerofoil in question. Owing<br>
to the - viewed in the circumferential direction - endless<br>
boundary wall and the aerofoils arranged in a likewise endless<br>
blade collar, it is possible to guide the partial flow from one<br>
of the aerofoils to the aerofoil advancing in the direction of<br>
rotation. Applied for all aerofoils of the blade collar, the<br>
pressure side and the suction side of two directly adjacent<br>
aerofoils can thus be joined together, via each return flow<br>
region, inclined in a suitable fashion relative to the machine<br>
axis, in the manner of an endless sequence, for influencing the<br>
suction-side aerofoil flow in order more effectively to avoid<br>
any risk of stalls at this location.<br>
Owing to the inclination of each return flow region relative to<br>
the machine axis, the inflow velocity and inflow direction of<br>
each partial flow returned to the main flow are significantly<br>
improved over the prior art in the region of the respective<br>
feed position. This applies in particular to aerofoils which<br>
are flowed against transonically or portions of aerofoils lying<br>
on a comparatively large radius in relation to the machine<br>
axis. The kinematics of the main flow stabilized in accordance<br>
with the invention, in particular of the main flow close to the<br>
gap, can thus also be significantly improved. In addition, the<br>
selected inflow direction of the partial flow, based on the<br>
machine axis, allows the swirl in the main flow to be<br>
intensified, and this has an advantageous effect on the local<br>
flowing and the efficiency of the compressor.<br>
The same advantages can be achieved in the case of free-<br>
standing guide blades which, radially outwardly fastened, lie<br>
with their free aerofoil tips opposite a rotating boundary wall<br>
arranged on the rotor, with a gap being formed. In this case,<br>
the casing treatment according to the invention is provided in<br>
the rotor and is moved in conjunction with said rotor in<br>
relation to the stationary guide blades.<br>
As a result of these measures according to the invention, the<br>
start of the stall is displaced to lower mass flow rates,<br>
and this widens the range of operation of a compressor equipped<br>
therewith. Likewise, a stall which might jeopardize operation,<br>
or 'pumping'1, occurs less frequently during operation of a<br>
compressor of this type.<br>
Advantageous configurations are described in the sub-claims.<br>
According to a first advantageous development of the invention,<br>
the number of the return flow passages is equal to the number<br>
or equal to the integral multiple of the aerofoils. This allows<br>
a particularly uniformly distributed casing treatment to be<br>
defined along the circumference, thus allowing uniform<br>
influencing of the flow, close to the gap, of aerofoils<br>
advancing in operation to be achieved at each point of the<br>
circumference.<br>
Preferably, the bleed position of one return flow region lies<br>
opposite the tip of one of the aerofoils and the associated<br>
feed position of one return flow region lies in that region of<br>
the circumference of the boundary wall in which lies the tip of<br>
the aerofoil advancing relative to one aerofoil in the<br>
direction of rotation. Accordingly, the partial flow bled from<br>
an aerofoil is provided for influencing the adjacent aerofoil<br>
in the direction of advancement. Owing to this measure, return<br>
flow regions which are inclined comparatively markedly relative<br>
to the machine axis, but also in the same direction as the<br>
stagger angle, are provided so that the partial flow issuing<br>
therefrom can help advantageously to influence the swirl<br>
occurring in the main flow.<br>
The aforementioned measure is particularly efficient if the<br>
bleed position and the feed position of each return flow region<br>
are distributed over the circumference in such a way that<br>
during a movement of the aerofoils along the boundary wall at a<br>
point in time a pressure side wall of one aerofoil is arranged<br>
- viewed in the direction of rotation - immediately before the<br>
bleed<br>
position of one return flow region and a suction side wall of<br>
the aerofoil advancing relative to one aerofoil is arranged<br>
immediately after the feed position of one return flow region.<br>
Conventionally, the bleed position of each return flow region<br>
is arranged in the portion of the boundary wall that is<br>
provided upstream of the outflow edges of the aerofoils lying<br>
opposite the boundary wall. This discloses a particularly<br>
effective casing treatment.<br>
In a further configuration of the invention, the axial feed<br>
position of each return flow region is arranged in the portion<br>
of the boundary wall that is provided upstream of the front<br>
edges of the aerofoils which lie opposite the boundary wall.<br>
This has a particularly advantageous effect on the swirl.<br>
Expediently, the return flow region can be embodied at least<br>
partly as a return flow duct running within the boundary wall<br>
of the flow duct. In this case, the return flow passages can be<br>
separated by plates and thus form return flow ducts distributed<br>
over the circumference; however, they can also be embodied as<br>
grooves formed in the surface of the boundary wall. Preferably,<br>
the plates distributed over the circumference can be embodied<br>
in such a way that an optimum inflow of the front edges of the<br>
aerofoil is achieved. For this purpose, the plates can be<br>
embodied along their longitudinal extension for example as<br>
profiled guide elements or guide blades, as a result of which a<br>
further improved mode of operation of the casing treatment is<br>
to be expected. In particular, if appropriate, higher outgoing<br>
or inflow velocities of the partial flows can be achieved in<br>
this way, even independently of whether or not the casing<br>
treatment is embodied in accordance with the invention.<br>
For reasons of strength and assembly reasons, the plates carry<br>
an axial portion of the boundary wall lying between the bleed<br>
position and the feed position.<br>
The configuration of the invention has been found to be<br>
particularly advantageous in which the return flow regions<br>
distributed over the circumference start and end on the bleed<br>
side and/or on the feed side in each case in an annular gap<br>
encircling endlessly along the circumference. Should non-<br>
uniform inflows, distributed over the circumference, into the<br>
return flow region or outflows from the return flow region<br>
occur, a standardization of for example local pressures and<br>
flow conditions can be achieved in this way. In this case, the<br>
positions to be extracted for determining the inclination of<br>
the return flow passages are in each case then to be seen in<br>
the portion of the circumference in which the plates, inclined<br>
relative to the machine axis, start and end.<br>
The preceding and other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become clearer from the following description of<br>
an embodiment. In the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 is a longitudinal partial section of a gas turbine;<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic view through the inlet-side cross section<br>
of the compressor with a casing treatment arranged in the outer<br>
casing wall;<br>
Fig. 3 is a plan view onto the casing treatment according to<br>
Fig. 2 from radially outside in the direction toward the<br>
machine axis; and<br>
Fig. 4 shows the velocity triangle for the arrangement shown in<br>
Fig. 3.<br>
Fig. 1 is a longitudinal partial section of a gas turbine 1.<br>
Said gas turbine has in the interior a rotor 3 which is mounted<br>
so as to be able to rotate about a machine axis 2 and is also<br>
referred to as a turbine rotor. Along the rotor 3 there follow<br>
in succession a suction casing 4, a compressor 5, a toroidal<br>
annular burning chamber 6 comprising a plurality of burners 7<br>
arranged rotationally symmetrically to one another, a turbine<br>
unit 8 and a waste gas casing 9. The annular burning chamber 6<br>
forms a combustion chamber 17 which is connected to an annular<br>
hot gas duct 16. There, four turbine stages 10, arranged one<br>
after another, form the turbine unit 8. Each turbine stage 10<br>
is formed from two blade rings. Viewed in the direction of flow<br>
of a hot gas 11 generated in the annular burning chamber 6, a<br>
respective series 13 of guide blades is followed in the hot gas<br>
duct 16 by a series 14 formed from moving blades 15. The guide<br>
blades 12 are fastened to the stator, whereas the moving blades<br>
15 of a series 14 are each attached to the rotor 3 by means of<br>
a disk 19. A generator or a machine tool (not shown) is linked<br>
to the rotor 3.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic cross section through the inlet-side end<br>
20 of the compressor 5, in which a conically tapering flow duct<br>
18 is provided. The flow duct 18 is surrounded radially<br>
inwardly by a rotor-side boundary wall 22 and radially<br>
outwardly by a casing-side boundary wall 24 which are each<br>
arranged concentrically with the machine axis 2. Viewed in the<br>
main flow direction 28 of the main flow 26, there is provided<br>
first a collar 29 of pre-guide blades 30 which can rotate about<br>
the radial direction R and by means of which the mass flow of<br>
the main flow 26 can be adjusted as required. An aerofoil 32,<br>
fastened to the rotor 3, of a moving blade 31 of the moving<br>
blade collar 33 of a first compressor stage is shown downstream<br>
of the pre-guide blades 30. Each aerofoil 32 comprises a front<br>
edge 34, against which the main flow 26 flows first, and a rear<br>
edge 36 at which the main flow 26 leaves the aerofoil 32. The<br>
aerofoils 32 are each formed by a suction-side blade wall 38<br>
which is arched in a substantially convex manner<br>
and by a pressure-side blade wall 40 which is arched in a<br>
substantially concave manner (Fig. 3) . The aerofoil 32 of the<br>
moving blade 31 is braced on one side to the rotor 3, so that<br>
its aerofoil tip 42 lies opposite the outer boundary wall 24,<br>
with a gap being formed.<br>
Downstream of the moving blade 31, the collar 41, associated<br>
with the first compressor stage, of guide blades 43 is fastened<br>
to the outer boundary wall 24. Each guide blade 43 is free-<br>
standing, i.e. the tip 42, lying opposite the inner boundary<br>
wall 22, of the aerofoil 32 is not secured in a fastening ring<br>
encompassing the rotor 3, but rather lies opposite the boundary<br>
wall 22 arranged on the rotor 3, with a gap also being formed.<br>
The aerofoil 32 of the guide blade 43 is accordingly braced to<br>
the housing on one side merely radially on the outside.<br>
A casing treatment, which comprises a plurality of return flow<br>
passages 46, distributed uniformly over the circumference of<br>
the outer boundary wall 24, in the form of return flow ducts 48<br>
arranged within the outer boundary wall 24, is provided in an<br>
axial portion of the outer boundary wall 24 that partly lies<br>
opposite the aerofoil tip 42 of the moving blade 31.<br>
Alternatively, the return flow passages 4 6 could also be<br>
embodied as grooves milled into the outer boundary wall 24.<br>
The return flow ducts 48 distributed over the circumference are<br>
separated from one another by plates 54. The plates 54 extend<br>
merely partially over the entire length of the return flow<br>
passages 46. This allows the provision, both on the inflow side<br>
and on the bleed side, of a respective annular gap 53, 55<br>
encircling endlessly in the boundary wall 24 for bleeding the<br>
partial flow 69 and for returning it to the main flow 26.<br>
Through the return flow passages 46, a partial flow 49 can be<br>
detached from the main flow 26 at a bleed position 50<br>
and be returned downstream - based on the bleed position 50 and<br>
the main flow direction 28 - to the main flow 26 in a feed<br>
position 52.<br>
Fig. 3 is in this regard a plan view taken along the sectional<br>
line III - III. The same elements of Figure 2 are denoted by<br>
identical reference numerals. The plan view shows three<br>
schematically illustrated moving blades 31', 31', 31'" with<br>
the associated aerofoils 32 thereof. The aerofoils 32 each have<br>
the suction-side blade wall 38 and the pressure-side blade wall<br>
40 which each extend from the inflow-side front edge 34 to the<br>
outflow-side rear edge 36. A straight line 56 connecting the<br>
front edge 34 to the rear edge 36 intersects the machine axis 2<br>
at a stagger angle y.<br>
Through the first annular gap 53, the partial flows 4 9 can flow<br>
into the return flow region 4 6 - i.e. out of the drawing plane.<br>
The partial flows 49, which then flow through the boundary wall<br>
24 counter to the main flow direction 28, are subsequently<br>
returned, after flowing through the return flow ducts 48, to<br>
the main flow 2 6 through the second annular gap 55 arranged<br>
upstream of the front edge 34.<br>
The plates 54 can be formed in the form of aerodynamically<br>
optimized profiles, as a result of which a particularly<br>
efficient mode of operation of the casing treatment is to be<br>
expected. The plates 54 each have two mutually opposing ends<br>
64, 66. A straight line 68 connecting the ends 64, 66 of one of<br>
the plates 54 is inclined relative to the machine axis 2 in a<br>
similar manner to the straight line 56 which describes the<br>
stagger angle ?. Both straight lines 56, 68 enclose a minimum<br>
angle which is less than 30°.<br>
As the embodiment shown provides bleed-side and feed-side<br>
annular gaps 53, 55, the positions to be extracted for<br>
determining the inclination of the return flow ducts 48 are<br>
each to be seen in the portion of the circumference in<br>
which the plates 54, which are inclined relative to the machine<br>
axis 2, start and end.<br>
Owing to the comparatively large inclination of the plates 54<br>
relative to the machine axis 2 - marked by the straight line<br>
68, which runs in a similar manner to the stagger angle ?, -<br>
each partial flow 4 9 flowing through the return flow ducts 48<br>
is deflected in such a way that there is impressed thereon a<br>
flow component which is aligned with the direction of rotation<br>
U of the moving blades 31. Thus, each partial flow 49 bled from<br>
the main flow 26 is returned - viewed in the direction of<br>
rotation U of the moving blades 31 - to the main flow 26 at a<br>
position advancing based on the bleed position 50.<br>
For example, the partial flow provided with the reference<br>
numeral 49' is bled from the pressure-side blade wall 40 of<br>
the moving blade 31' and fed into the region before the front<br>
edge 34 of the moving blade 31' which is arranged in the<br>
direction of advancement based on the moving blade 31'.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the velocity triangle which is associated with<br>
Fig. 3 and in which u1 denotes the velocity vector of the<br>
aerofoils 32 in the tip region, C1 denotes the velocity vector<br>
of the partial flow 49 which is supplied to the main flow 26<br>
through a return flow duct 48, and w1 denotes the velocity<br>
vector, the main flow 26 flowing against the aerofoil 32 in the<br>
region of the aerofoil tip 42. The velocity triangle reveals<br>
that each partial flow 4 9 has a flow component aligned with the<br>
direction of rotation U and not, as in the closest prior art, a<br>
flow component directed in the opposite direction. This allows<br>
the swirl of the main flow 26 to be positively intensified, as<br>
a result of which, during operation of the compressor 5<br>
proceeding close to the pump limit, a stall of the suction-side<br>
flow occurs in a manner further delayed compared to the closest<br>
prior art. This is achieved in that parts of the main flow 26<br>
are returned from the region of low flow velocities above the<br>
aerofoil tip 42 to the front edge 34 of the moving blade 31,<br>
where they are blown in preferably at the greatest possible<br>
velocity; this reduces the blockage responsible for the<br>
pumping. In addition, the partial flow 4 9 returned to the main<br>
flow 2 6 has a positive axial flow component. Accordingly, an at<br>
least partial reversal of the direction of flow of the partial<br>
flow 49 into the direction of flow of the main flow 26 takes<br>
place in the region of the feed position 52. The proposed<br>
solution allows the flow guidance of the partial flow 49 and<br>
main flow 26 to be further improved, in particular during<br>
partial load operation, as for the first time the inflow<br>
direction of the partial flow 4 9 in the relative system of the<br>
moving blade 31, as illustrated in Fig. 4, is taken into<br>
account and improved.<br>
In addition, profiled blades 54, which along their longitudinal<br>
extension are arched in a similarly aerodynamic manner to the<br>
aerofoils 32 of compressor moving and guide blades 31, 43,<br>
allow particularly low-loss guidance of the partial flows 49<br>
through the or along the outer boundary wall 24, independently<br>
of the invention.<br>
Overall, the invention provides a compressor 5 through which<br>
flow flows axially and having a casing treatment which is less<br>
sensitive to stalls and "pumping", as the inflow angle of the<br>
partial flows 49, which are returned through the boundary wall<br>
22, 24, is taken into account and improved in the relative<br>
system of the moving blade 31. For this purpose, the ducts 48<br>
guiding the partial flow 49 are inclined relative to the<br>
direction of rotation U in such a way that each rotating moving<br>
blade 31 passes first the bleed openings 50 and afterwards the<br>
feed openings 52.<br>
