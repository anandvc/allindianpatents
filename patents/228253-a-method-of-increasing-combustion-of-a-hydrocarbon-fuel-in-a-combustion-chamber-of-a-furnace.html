				<td>1.	Field of the Invention:		 <br>
This invention relates to in improved method of incrasing combust of a hydrocastion <br>
fuelin a comfustion chow of a furnace<br>
2.	Related Art:<br>
hi a previous disclosure of the same assignee of the present invention, Air Liquide Serie file 5167, filed November 10, 1999, Application Serial No.09/437,;&gt;26, there was proposed a scheme of oxygen-enrichment in boilers using large amounts of oxygen, up to full oxy-fuel combustion. That patent application involved a certain ratio between the oxygen enrichment and the flue gas recirculation, such that the design boiler parameters are maintained constant.<br>
While quite inventive, the above-referenced methods in said patent application may not be desirous in particular industrial heating applications, in particular coal fired boilers, primarily pulverized coal, but with the application to fluidized beds also. Coal combustion results in a potentially large amount of unburned coal in the stack, thus losing a large amount of fuel. Also, due to the incomplete combustion of coal, as well as to the sometimes difficult ignition process, a support fuel such as natural gas is frequently used in significant quantities (from about 10% to about 50% of the total amount of fuel). The ease and completeness of combustion is directly related to the volatile content of the coal, and indirectly related to the percentage of moisture in the coal. In other words, more moisture means more difficult and possibly incomplete combustion, while more volatiles in the coal means more complete combustion.<br>
Figure 1 presents in schematic, a prior art combustion chamber 2 in a boiler 4, where the combustion chamber 2 is divided into two major zones: Zone I, as denoted in Figure 1 at 6, represents the area where combustion burners are located, together with air inlets.<br>
Combustion air can enter combustion chamber 2 together with a fuel (part of the air is used to transport coal into combustion chamber 2), or in different inlets. Combustion air can be introduced into the boiler partially or totally at this location. More modem schemes use a different air inlet, denoted as Zone II, and noted as 8 in Figure 1, in order to improve the combustion process and to lower the NOx emissions. The combustion scheme illustrated schematically in Figure 1 is termed "staged combustion" since the combustion process occurs in two zones. It is noted that the schematic in Figure 1 is very general, showing a generally horizontal flue gas circulation 10. In general, flue gas circulation can be in any direction (vertical, horizontal, circular, and the like).<br>
As illustrated in Figure 1, the combustion process is divided into two major zones: Zone I represents the ignition zone, where the fuel(s) enter the combustion chamber, are heated, and ignite. When coal is of a lesser quality, additional fuel (generally natural gas or fuel oil) is required for a fast ignition. Zone II represents the final region allocated lor combustion. Additional oxidant may be introduced, as mentioned supra. Modem staged combustion schemes allow a significant portion of the oxidant to enter Zone II (between 10% and 50% of the total oxidant). Due to the low pressure of the incoming air in Zone II, the flow patterns of the main flue gas stream are relatively undisturbed, thus the mixing between the two streams is relatively poor, preventing the hill combustion of the fuel. This is represented by the shaded area 16 in Figure 2. Figure 2 illustrates that the mixing zone 16 between the flue gas stream 10 and the balance of the oxidizer in Zone II and exiting into the mixing zone 16 is not total, thus an important part of the fuel will not mix with the oxidant, thus remaining unburned.<br>
It would be an advantage if the fuel from Zone I could be mixed with oxidant from Zone II to provide better mixing between fuel and secondary oxidant.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention, methods and apparatus are provided which overcome problems associated with the prior art methods. The present invention involves introducing a high velocity stream of an oxygen-enriched gas into Zone II through a multitude of streams, preferably uniformly distributed for better mixing. "Oxygen-enriched" as used herein, is considered any gas having concentration of oxygen higher than 21% (the<br>
oxygen concentration in air). The results of this inventive process are: providing the fuel and/or fuel-rich combustion products with enhanced oxidant (when compared to air), and also impi-oving the mixing Between the fuel and/or fuel-rich combustion products and the oxidant. The combined effect of high oxygen concentration and improved mixing leads to a more effective and complete fuel combustion.<br>

Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
The combined effect of enhanced oxygen concentration and improved mixing leads to a more effective and complete fuel combustion. Figure 3 illustrates the process schematically where the enhanced oxidant is injected in Zone II at 8, forming an enriched oxidant mixing zone 14 which greatly improves the combustion efficiency. Figures 4-12 illustrate specific embodiments of injection of oxygen-enriched gas.<br>
Figure 4a illustrates a side sectional view, and a front elevation view, Figure 4b, of one apparatus and method embodiment of the invention. A furnace wall or burner block 300 has a front face 302 which faces a combustion chamber. Oxygen-enriched oxidant enters into pipe 301 and traverses through a converging, diverging nozzle 200, having an exit 201. As illustrated in Figure 4b, there typically are multiple pipes 301 having exits 201, Figure 4b illustrating a case where there are three pipes 301 and three exits 201. The injection points are located preferably on the same wall of the combustion chamber and separated from the air injection points. The velocity (Vox) of the oxygen-enriched oxidant stream (400) is preferably within the range of 0.75 Mach up to about 5 Mach, and more preferably ranging<br>
from about Mach 1 to about Mach 2. The high momentum oxidant jet 400 entrains flue gases as depicted in Figure 4a to create a mixing zone 401. The high momentum oxidant jet entrains flue gases rich in fuel into a high oxygen concentration zone to complete combustion. Typically, if Vs is the sonic velocity of the main oxidant stream in the conditions of use in the furnace, then the following condition will be present with the oxidant stream 400: Vs 
Figures 5a and 5b illustrate another embodiment of the invention where oxygen-enriched oxidant is injected in pipe 100 in Zone II of the combustion chamber using the same configuration described in Figure 4a; however, the oxidant stream velocity exiting pipe 100 is below sonic velocity of the local air stream. Thus, in this embodiment, the following relationship exists: 0.1 x Vs 
Another embodiment is depicted in Figures 6a and 6b. As depicted in Figure 6a, a first portion of oxygen-enriched oxidant enters pipe or conduit 100, producing an oxidant stream 400b. The oxidant exiting pipe 100 is subsonic in velocity following the relationship: Vox 
shown from the direction "C" in Figure 6a. The front elevation view in Figure 6b depicts three injector pipes 100, three fuel pipes 110, and three outer oxidant injector pipes 120. As with the previous embodiments, the injection points are preferably located on the same wall of the combustion chamber and preferably separated from the air injection points by distance ranging from a few meters up to about 50 meters, depending on the combustion chamber and furnace dimensions.<br>
Figures 7a and 7b present plan and side sectional views, respectively, of another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, four oxidant lances are installed on two opposing walls of a combustion chamber to provide a more homogenous oxidant distribution within the combustion chamber. Four injection points 100, 100', 100a, and 100a' are provided. Velocity of the oxidant streams injected in these four injectors may range from  • 0.75 Mach up to Mach 5, preferably ranging from 0.7 Mach to Mach 3. The angle a is as before with regard to previous embodiments, while the angle (3 as depicted in Figure 7b is generally within the range of 20° to about 160°. The angle (3 may be different from the angle a but is preferably the same as the angle a. Illustrated in Figure 7a is the distance LL and the distance 1. LL is defined as the distance between two adjacent oxidant lances, for.example, 100a and 100a' in Figure 7a. Preferably the following relationship exists: LL 
Figure 8 illustrates another embodiment of oxygen-enriched oxidant injected in Zone II of a combustion chamber. In this embodiment, the oxidant lances 100, 100a, 100b, and 100c are installed on four walls of a combustion chamber 300, 300a, 300b, and 300c, respectively. This embodiment provides a more homogenous and turbulent oxidant distribution. Figure 8 illustrates a rectangular combustion chamber, but the same injection arrangement could be applied in a cylindrical combustion chamber.  The velocities of the various oxidant streams emanating from lances 100, 100a, 100b, and 100c maybe the same or different, but in each case the following relationship holds: Vox 
each individual oxidant lance 100, 100a, 100b, and 100c, again independently ranges from about 20° to about 160°. Again, a is defined as the angle between the oxidant lance symmetry axis and the combustion wall surface. Another angle is defined in Figure 8a, angle y, there being shown y1,y2,y3 and 74. Angle 8 is defined as the angle between the oxidant lance symmetry axis and the combustion wall surface in a plane perpendicular to which the angle a is measured. The angle y in each independent case ranges from about 20° to about 160°. There is also defined in Figure 8 lengths L1, Lo2 L3, and L4. The length L1 is the distance between the respective oxidant lance and its closest wall surface, with the following relationship holding true: Li 
Figures 9a, 9b, and 9c, illustrate schematically a side sectional view, and two alternative front elevation views depicted by front elevation "E" in Figure 9a. hi Figure 9a, oxygen-enriched oxidant enters a pipe 100, wherein the oxygen-enriched gas is injected directly into an air stream traversing through through-hole 500 in furnace wall 300. Oxygen-enriched gas traverses through pipe 100 and through a converging, diverging nozzle 200 and exits with supersonic velocity ranging from about 1 Mach up to about 5 Mach, preferably from about 1 Mach to about 3 Mach. The high momentum oxidant jet 400 entrains air and flue gases rich in fuel into a high oxygen concentration zone to complete combustion. Depicted in Figures 9b and 9c are two alternative front elevation views, which differ primarily in the shape of the through-hole for air. in Figure 9b, through-hole 500 is a slot, whereas in Figure 9c, the through-hole 500a is a circular pattern.<br>
Figures 10a, 10b, and 10c, show a design similar to that depicted previously in Figures 9a, 9b, and 9c, except that the oxidant-emiched gas emanating from pipe 100 travels through a straight nozzle 202, and therefore, Vox follows the relationship: 0.1 x Vs 
Figures 11a, lib, and lie, illustrate yet another embodiment of the invention. In Figure 11a, oxidant enters through a pipe 100 directly into an ah stream which traverses<br><br>
through a through-hole 500 in furnace wall 300. Oxygen-enriched stream flowing through pipe 100 is injected perpendicularly (as illustrated via arrows) to the flow of air through a nozzle 600. The oxygen-enriched gas, being mjected perpendicular to the flow of air, improves the mixing of air with the high oxygen concentration gas. The velocity of the injected oxygen-enriched stream follows the following relationship: 0.1 x Vs 
Figures 12a, 12b, and 12c illustrate yet another embodiment of the apparatus of the invention wherein oxidant-enriched gas is injected in Zone II of the combustion chamber. In this embodiment, the oxidant is used as the driving fluid while injected into an ejector through a pipe 100 having a pipe exit 102. The oxidant is preferably mjected through multiple ejectors, in order to improve the mixing between air and the high-oxygen concentration gas, and also to extend the high oxygen concentration zone further into the combustion chamber. An ejector nozzle 700 is provided for this purpose.  The velocity of the oxygen-enriched stream (Vox) niay be sonic or subsonic, following the relationship: 0.1 x Vs 
Figure 13 illustrates schematically a process and apparatus of the invention where a combined scheme is proposed. Here, enhanced oxidant is introduced both into Zone I, lanced into the fuel stream, and into Zone ll, tlrrough one of the means described in Figures 4-12.
