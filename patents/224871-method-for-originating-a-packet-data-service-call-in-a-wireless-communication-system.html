1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention generally relates to the field of wireless communications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel method for originating packet data service option calls via dial-up networking applications.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Recent innovations in wireless communication and computer-related technologies, as well as the unprecedented growth of Internet subscribers, have paved the way for mobile computing. In fact, the popularity of mobile computing has placed greater demands on the current communications infrastructure to provide mobile users with more support. A crucial part of meeting these demands and providing users with the necessary support is the use of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology in wireless communication systems.<br>
The document WO 00/04691 describes a system and method for enabling the use of popular serial networking application software (24) to transmit PPP packet data via a CDMA type subscriber device (30) to a network such as the internet (22). One or more reserved phone numbers is stored in memory (54) within the subscriber device. The networking application (24) is provided a telephone number to be dialed in order to make a coimection to the internet.<br>
CDMA is a digital radio-frequency (RF) channelization technique that is defined in the Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronics Industries Association Interim Standard-95 (TIA/EIA IS-95), entitled "MOBILE STATION-BASE STATION COMPATIBILITY STANDARD FOR DUAL MODE WIDEBAND SPREAD SPECTRUM CELLULAR      SYSTEM'       published in July 1993 and herein incorporated by<br><br>
reference. Wtrdess commumcatioii systans eoqitoying ttus tedawlo^ assigi a unique code to commmicatbn signals and spread these connninicatkm sigtBls across a 'common widdjand spread spectrum bandwidth. As longas the receiving ^paratus in a CDMA system has the conect code, it can successful^ detect and select its conmnmication signal fiom the other signals concuirentV transmitted over the same bandwidth. The use of CDMA produces an increase in system traffic capacity, in^roves overall call quality and noise reduction, andproiAdes areliable transport mechanism for data service trafSc.<br>
FIG. 1 iUustrates a simplified block diagram of such a wireless data communication system 100. System 100 allows a mobile terminal equipment, TE2 device 102 (e.g., the terminal equipment such as laptop or palmtop computer) to communicate with an Interworidng Function (IWF) 108. System 100 includes a wireless communication device, MT2 device 104 (e.g., wireless telephone), and a Base Station/Mobile Switching Center (BS/MSC) 106. Tlie IWF 108 serves as a gateway between the \nreless network and other networks, such as tiie Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and wireline packet data networlK providing Internet- or Intranet-based access. An L interface couples IWF 108 to BS/MSC 106. Often the IWF 108 will be co-located with the BS/MSC 106. The TE2 device 102 is electronically coupled to the MT2 device J04 via the Râ€ž interface. The MT2 device 104 communicates with the BS/MSC 106 via ftie wireless interface UB,. The TE2 device 102 and the MT2 device 104 may be integrated into a single unit or may be separated out, as in the case of an installed mobile phone unit in which a laptop is the 1^2 de\ice 102 and the transceiver is tbe MT2 device 104. It is important to note that, as indicated<br><br>
by FIG. 2, the combination of the TE2 device 102 and the MT2 device 104, whether integrated or separate, is generally referred to as a mobile station (MS) 103.<br>
The abifity of CDMA systems to acccmmodate data service traffic has been de6aedintheTIA/EIA IS-707.5 standard, entitled 'T&gt;ATA SERVICE OPTIONS FOR WIDEBAND SPREAD SPECTRUM SYSTEMS: PACKET DATA SERVICES," published in February 1998 and herein incorporated by reference. Similar^, the TIA/EU. IS-707-A.5 standard, entitled "DATA SERVICE OPnONS FOR SPREAD SPECTRUM SYSTEMS: PACKET DATA SERVICES," and the TIA/EIA IS-707-A.9 Standard, entitled "DATA SERVICE OPTIONS FOR SPREAD SPECTRUM SYSTEMS: HIGH-SPEED PACKET DATA SERVICES," both published in March 1999 and incorporated by reference, also define requirements for packet data transmission support on TtA/BIA IS-95 systems. In addition, new standards such as TIA/EIA IS-707-A-1 and A-2, entitled "DATA SERVICE OPTIONS FOR SPREAD SPECTRUM SYSTEMS; CDMA2000 HIGH-SPEED PACKET DATA SERVICES," (Ballot Resolution Varsion 1999) and incorporated by reference, also defioe requirements for packet data transmission support on CDMA systems.<br>
These IS-707.5 packet data services enafcJe mobile useis to use their li^Jtop or pahntop conqjuters (i.a, TE2 device 102) to receive and transmit packet dat^ thaeby folfer siq)porting Internet- and Intranet-networidng connectivity. To wit, just as con^FeIlVional iiseis employ "wired" comnamication devices to able to electronically coniKct their desktop conq)uters to land-based networks, mobile users can utilize wirdess<br><br>
communicatbn devices (i.e, MT2 device 104) to electronically connect and communicate with such n^works.<br>
In particular, the IS-707.5 standard specifies the packet data service options that may be used to communicate between the TE2 dewce 102 and IWF 108 via BS/MSC 106. In doing so, IS-707.5 introduces two protocol option. modeU, which specify the<br>
packet data protocol requirements for the R^ interface.   FIG. 2 depicts one of the<br>
protocol option models, die Relay Layer hiterfece Protocol Option model 200, in which the application running on flie TBI device 102 manages the packet data services as well as the network addressing.<br>
At the far left of FIG. 2 is a protocol stack, shown in conventional vertical format that depicts the protocol layers running on the TE2 device 102. At the top of &amp;e TE2 protocol stack lies the upper protocol layers, which includes the ^jplication layer 202. For mobile users utilizmg packet data services to access the Internet and/or private Intranets, this layer 202 comprises, for example, web browso- prog-ams (e.g, Netsc^e Navigator'*', Microsoft Intanet Ejqpbrerâ„¢ etc) and comiminicatbnsAiaworkingappIcations (e.g, Microsoft Dial-Up Networkingâ„¢).<br>
The folbwing protocol l^er on the TE2 device 102 protocol stadc is the transport layer protocol 204. As depicted in FIG2, this protocol 204 may be the TransmissicD Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is defined in Request for Commsnt 793 (RFC 793) entitled, "TRANSMISSaON CONTROL PROTOCOL: DARPA INTERNET PR0G5LAU PROTOCOL SPEOFICATION", pubfished in Septanber 1981 and herein inccrporated by reference. Essentially, TCPprovides a reliable transport service to all ^plications by<br><br>
raana^g the assembly of messages coming from the TE2deviÂ« 102 into packets that are transmitted overthe Internet.<br>
The subsequent protocol layer is the network layer protocol 206. This protocol % a- may include the Internet Protocol (IPi whidi is de&amp;ied in Request for Comnent 791 (RFC 791) CTtitled, "INTERNET PROTOCOL: DARPA INTERNET PROGRAM PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION", published in Sqjtember 1981 and herein incorporated by referoice. The IP protocol is the life-blood of the Internet as it handles the addressing and routing functiondity for all Internet commmications. It achieves this by affixing a 32-bit address to the header of pactets, so as to ensure that the padsts get to the ri^ destination. Each inteimediaiy node in the routing p ath chedcs the destination addiess to diamine how to forward the IF packets.<br>
The next layer protocol of the TE2 device 102 protocol stadc is the link layer protocol 208. As indicated fay FIG. 2, this layer may inotide the Poiitt-to-Point Protocol (PPF) whidi is described in detal in Requrat for Commeaits 1661 (RFC 1661), entitled "THE POINT-TO-POINT PROTOCOL (PPP)". dated May 1992. and heron incorporated by reference. The PPP protocol is a link layer protocol used to configure, test, and esttfclish the data link connection. The PPP protocol encodes packets coming from the uppo-protocol layers of theTE2 102 device and "seiializes" thai to fecflitate transmissioD on thesedal commuiications link<br>
Fineily, FIG. 2 illustrates that the TE2 protocol stack is logically connected to the protocol stack of the MT2 device 104 over the Râ€ž interface flirough the relay layer protocol 210. The R^ interface may comply, for example, with the TIA/EIA-232-F<br><br>
standard, entitled "INTERFACE BETWEEN DATA TERMINAL EQUIPMENT AND DATA CIRCUIT-TERMINATING EQUIPMENT EMPLOYING SERIAL BINARY DATA INTERCHANGE", published in October 1997 and herein incorporated by reference. Other R^, interface standards may include, for example, the "UNIVERSAL SERIAL BUS (USB) SPECIFICATION, Revision 1.1", published in September 1998 and herein incoiporated by reference.<br>
As noted above, mobile users may utilize tiie packet data service options, as specified by the lS-707.5 standard, to access and communicate with the Internet or private Intranets. To do so, mobile users would employ a dial-up networidng ^plcation, residing in the memory of TE2 device 102, such as Microsoft DiatUp Networidngâ„¢, for exarnple.   The dial-up ^phcation includes a user dial-up interface<br>
that enables users to identify the type of serial MT2 device 104 connected to fiie TE2 device 102 as well as accommodate the entry of telephone numbers and usemame/password scripts. The user dial-up interface generally incoiporates a dial-iq) engine which receives the telephone number ii^iutted by the user and generates MT2 device 104 an initialization string. The dial-up engine then translates the inputted telephone number mto an AT dial command string that is compliant with the HayesÂ® Standard AT Command Set language and transmits the initidization strii^ as well as the M dial command string to the MT2 ttevice 104. Examples of such AT dial command strings are: "ATDT 5551234" (for diahng telephone number 555-1234) or "ATI3" (for letennining modem ID).<br><br>
Typically, a dial-up networking application will not initiate the transfer of PPP packets from the TE2 device 102 to the MT2 device 104, via tbe Râ€ž interface, unless and until it receives confirmation that the MT2 device 104 has negotiated and established a connection across the U^ interfece. For example, for dial-up networkii^ iqjpUcations for TE2 devices 102 operating within a WindowsÂ® 95 environment, TE2 device 102 will only transmit PPP packets to the MT2 device 104 after it receives a "Connect" message, or the like, from MT2 device 104. Therefore, instead of automatically initiating a packet call upon detectii^ a PPP packet, TE2 device 102 has to wait until it receives the Connect message.<br>
Moreover, other TE2 device 102 operatii^ systetos, such as WindowsÂ® 98 and WindowsÂ® NT, for exsmpU, furfcer reqiure a lugh Data Carrier Detect (DCD) signal which, pursuant to the TIA/EIA-232-F standard on the R^ interface, is used to indicate that a channel canier has been established. This high DCD signal requirement further complicates the transmission of PPP packets because, under the T:iAJE\A IS-707-A.3 standard, a high DCD signal is only provided by the MT2 device 104 after a trafSc channel has been establi^ied. Thus, for TE2 devices 102 opwating in a WindowsÂ® 98 or WindowsÂ® NT enwonment, before the TE2 device 102 can be^ transmitting PPP packets, a traffic channel has to be established, a hi^ DCD signal level has to be provided to the MT2 device 104, and the MT2 device 104 must supply a "Connect" message back to the TE2 device 102.<br>
Therefore, what is needed is a novel method that enables terminal devices to efficiently originate packet data service option calls via dial-up networking ^jplications.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE EJVENTION<br>
The present invention addresses the need identified above by providmg a novel system and method that enables terminal devices to efficiently ori^nate packet data service option calls via dial-up networking applications.<br>
Systems and methods consistent with the principles of the present invention as embodied and broadly described herein include a terminal device for originating a call and for transmittLng and receiving data in accordance with a selected data service option. The terminal device includes a dkling interfece for inputting a sequence of one or more symbols representing a dial command string for origmatir^ the call. The ii^ut symbol sequence includes information indicating the selection of a data service option. The system also includes a communication device, coupled to the terminal device, for receiving the ^al command string firom ftie terrtunal device, for storing a plurality of preÂ¬determined symbol sequences including standard telephone numbers and reserved telephone number sequences representing different data service options, and for comparing the cont^ts of the dial command string widi die stored pre-detennined symbol sequences. The communicatioDs device operates in accordance with the selected data service option when the coramunicatiQn device determines that the contents of the dial command string matches one of the reserved tel^hone number sequences.<br><br>

FIG. 3 is a higb-Ievel flow diagram describing the op nation of an embodiment of the present invoition. The embodiment presumes that a mobfle user endeavors to orignate a padost call &amp;om the user dial-up interface of a dial-up networidng application runmng on flie TE2 device iro. The MT2 device 104 is cqjAle of storing a pluraKty of alphanumeric sequences r^iesenting standard telephone numbers as well as paclst data service options, whidi specify theattribut^ of thepaclEt datacall To orignate a packet data call the user inpids an alphanumeric sequence, such as predetermined AT dial command string, in theuser dial-up intaface. Thepiedetermiied AT dial comrmnd string directly corrcspondstoastorodpack^ dataservice option. After the user inputs the AT dial command string the TE2 devfce 102 formats and transmits the AT dial command strict to the MT2104 devfce.<br>
As mdbated in bbdc B310, the MT2 device 104 first determines whether it has receivedanATdialcommandstriQgfromtheTE2devicel02. Ifnot,theMT2device 104 waits for the entiy an AT command, as in blotk B315. If the MT2 device 104 has received an AT dial command string, theM T2 device 104 prog^ses to block B320.<br><br>
In bbdc B32(i the MT2 devKe 104 examines the AT dial command string and Kttiacts the alphanumaric sequence incbded therein. SubsequentV, in blodt B330, the MT2 device 104 con^ares the alphanumerc sequence extracted fiom the AT dial command string to all of the stoted alphanumeric sequences and detennines whether theie exists a matdi betwem the extracted alphanuineric sequence and one of the stored a^banmnOTS scqura.ces. If a matdi does not exist, the MT2 device 104, in block B33^ bri:^ up an async/fex service data call, fay defedt, as per the IS-707.4 standard.. Acccrdin^,theMT2device 104 uses the unmatched extracted a^hanumerc sequence as a destination tel^hone amober for the async^fax service data call If a matdi does exist between the extracted a^hanumerb sequence and one of the stored alphanum^ sequrau^es, theMT2 devise 104 prog^ses to blodc B340.<br>
In bbdc B340, theMT2 device 104 originates a packet data call in accordance with the particular paclcet data service optbns identified by the matdied stored alphanuniBric sequence. For exaniple, in an exemplary embodiment, the stored alphanumeric sequence "ATDT#777" may be associated with a packet data call spedfied ay service optbns 7,15 or 4103 white stored sequence "ATDT#888" may be associated jvithamediumdatarate(MDR)paclEtcallhavngserviceoptions22-25. Aheraativdy, a ;arrier may insert the special dial string and compare that special dial string to the one lent by the user to determine if a packet call is to be brought up<br>
In block B34S,theMT2device 104 estcblishes, as per IS-707.5, a trafBc channel eaponsive to the packet data call orignation of blcKk B340. Once the traffic channel is stabUshed,theMT2device 104 raises the DCD signal to a hi^ levd, as in blodc B350.<br><br>
In addition, theMT2 device 104 transmits a Connect message badcto theTE2 device 102. As such, thereceqjt of theConoxt messa^ signals the conimunication application on the TS2. device 102 that the MT2 devfce 104 is ready and that a connectiaa to the remote end has been established. Accordingly, the TE2 device 102 responds by commencing the transmission of PPP paclssts to theMT2 device 104,<br>
By way of illustrating ao embodiment of the present invention, suppose a mobile user, operating within a wirdess communications network with CDMA data sauces support, wishes to establish a packet data call Theuserorignatesthecallby enteringthe a^hanumenc character sequence "ATI7r#777" into the dial-up inter&amp;ce of a netwoiidng q;ipltcationruni!ir^on a mobile l^top. For this example, eatmi^ the character sequence "#777" is designated as a stored alphanumeri: sequence sigoilyinga particular CDMA padst data service option (e.g, service options 7 or 15). The wirdess comrmmicatnn phone, coupled to themobie laptop, examines the dialed AT dial command string coming from the I^top, extracts the a^hanumeric sequence, andcon^^ares the extracted sequence, "#777" to the set of stored alplamimeric sequences. Upon detectir^ a matdi between the extracted "#777" sequence and the stored a^hanumark: sequence, the wirdess phone orignates a packet data call consistent with the options specified in the stoied a^hanumerk: sequence. The wirdess phone then briiigs up a traffic chamel, raises the levd of the DCD sigaal, and supplies a Connect messags to the l^top. This Connect messa^triss^ the laptop to begin seodngptK^s to ttephone, thereby esteb&amp;hing the desired packet data call<br><br>
This embodimmt, therefore, provides a method that enables terminal devices, such as l^tops, for sample, to efGcieatly originate packet data calls using dial-up networking applications with familiar dial-up interfaces. In this manner, mobile usos do not need to have diffireat interfaces and procedures for orignating diffeent types of pactet data calb. The usa- only necA to acquaint himself with one user intfffece, and only remember thestored alphanumeric sequraices (prrferably having a telephone number format) to orignate any pactet data service option call This system may store a plurality of a^banumeric sequences. Altemativdy, the stored a^hanmneric sequences could be predetenuined by the carrier, or they could be configurabb throu^ the standard AT dial command set langiage or equivalent. Moreover, the stored a^bamimeric sequences need not be limited to a^banumerk: characters, but can takÂ£ the form any symbol r^ioduced by a stancfard k^board on a compute.<br>
The processes associated with the presented embodiments may be stored in any storage device, such as, for example, non-volatile memory, an optical disk, magnetic tepe, or magnetic disk. Furthermore, the processes may be programmed when the system is manu&amp;ctured or via a computer-readable medium at a later date. Such a medium may mclude any of the forms listed above with respect to storage devices and may further mchide, for example, a carrier wave modulated, or otherwise manipulated, to convey instructions that can be read, demodulated/decoded and ^ecuted by the system.<br>
The forcing description of preferred embodiments of the present invention provides iUustratim and description, but is not intended to be esdiaustive or to limi the<br><br>
invoition to the precise form disdosed. ModiScatiois and variations are possible coimstent with the above teadiii^ or may be acquired from practice of the invention. Acccrdingly, the scope of the inveatioo is defined by the claim and their equivalents.<br><br><br>
