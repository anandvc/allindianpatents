				<td>SPECIFICATION PNEUMATIC TIRE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]        This invention relates to a pneumatic tire, and more<br>
particularly to a heavy duty radial tire in which a fracture resistance is<br>
high, an appearance during a final stage of running is good and a heat<br>
buildup is low.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]        In a heavy duty tire, a tread portion commonly has a<br>
so-called "cap/base structure" comprising a cap rubber and a base<br>
rubber and uses a cap rubber being excellent in a wear resistance and a<br>
base rubber being excellent in an appearance and a low heat buildup<br>
during a final stage of running, in order to simultaneously establish<br>
the wear resistance and the appearance and the low heat buildup<br>
during the final stage of the running.<br>
[0003]        Regarding the base rubber, a rubber having a large breaking<br>
elongation and a low tensile stress (elastic modulus) is preferable in<br>
order to improve the appearance during the final stage of the running,<br>
and a rubber having a high tensile stress and capable of suppressing<br>
deformation during rotating is preferable in order to lower a heat<br>
buildup.    Therefore, it is usually difficult to simultaneously establish<br>
the appearance and the low heat buildup of the base rubber during the<br>
final stage of the running.<br>
[0004]        As another method for lowering the heat buildup is<br>
mentioned a method of making a hysteresis loss of the base rubber low.<br>
For example, by increasing an amount of sulfur compounded in a<br>
rubber composition used in the base rubber, the hysteresis loss of the<br>
base rubber can be lowered, but the tensile stress becomes excessively<br>
large and thereby the appearance during the final stage of the running<br>
is deteriorated.<br>
[0005]        Also, by reducing an amount of a filler compounded in the<br>
rubber composition used in the base rubber, the hysteresis loss of the<br>
base rubber can be lowered and in this case, the breaking elongation of the base rubber can be also improved.    However, when the amount of the filler compounded is excessively reduced, it is known that the base rubber is easily subjected to a cut from a road surface to cause deterioration of the appearance during the final stage of the running. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]        It is, therefore, an object of the invention to solve the above-mentioned problems of the conventional techniques and to provide a pneumatic tire in which the appearance during the final stage of the running is good and the heat buildup is low. [0007]        The inventor has made various studies in order to achieve the above objects and discovered that in a tire comprising a tread portion having a cap/base structure, the appearance of the tire during the final stage of the running can be improved and the heat buildup can be lowered by using in the base rubber a rubber composition compounded with carbon black and silica in a specified amount and limiting each of a tensile stress at 300% elongation (M300) and a loss tangent (tan 8) of the base rubber to be within a specified range, and as a result the invention has been accomplished. [0008]        That is, the pneumatic tire according to the invention comprises a tread portion having a cap rubber and a base rubber, and is characterized in that:<br>
a rubber composition comprising not less than 30 parts by mass of carbon black and not less than 2 parts by mass of silica based on 100 parts by mass of a rubber component is used in the base rubber;<br>
and the base rubber has a tensile stress at 300% elongation (M300) of 10-14 MPa and a loss tangent (tan 5) of 0.1 or lower. [0009]        In a preferable embodiment of the pneumatic tire according to the invention, the rubber component of the rubber composition used in the base rubber is natural rubber or a blend of natural rubber and polyisoprene rubber.<br>
[0010]        In another preferable embodiment of the pneumatic tire according to the invention, the rubber composition used in the base<br>
rubber further comprises 0.1-5 parts by mass of a hydrazide compound<br>
and 0.1-5 parts by mass of a compound (Z) having in its molecule at<br>
least one reactive group a for the rubber component and two or more<br>
adsorption groups b for the silica based on 100 parts by mass of the<br>
rubber component.<br>
[0011]        In the rubber composition used in the base rubber of the<br>
pneumatic tire according to the invention, the carbon black preferably<br>
has a nitrogen adsorption specific surface area (N2SA) of not higher<br>
than 100 m2/g and a dibutyl phthalate (DBP) absorption number of not<br>
higher than 90 mL/l00g.<br>
[00-12]        In another preferable embodiment of the pneumatic tire<br>
according to the invention, an amount of the silica compounded is 3-8<br>
parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the rubber component.<br>
[0013]        In another preferable embodiment of the pneumatic tire<br>
according to the invention, the rubber composition used in the base<br>
rubber does not comprise a silane coupling agent.<br>
[0014]        In the other preferable embodiment of the pneumatic tire<br>
according to the invention, an outer surface of the base rubber in a<br>
radial direction of the tire is located more outward in a radial direction<br>
of the tire than a groove bottom of the tire.<br>
[0015]        According to the invention, there can be provided a<br>
pneumatic tire, wherein a rubber composition comprising not less than<br>
30 parts by mass of carbon black and not less than 2 parts by mass of<br>
silica based on 100 parts by mass of a rubber component is used in the<br>
base rubber, the base rubber has a tensile stress at 300% elongation<br>
(M300) of 10-14 MPa and a loss tangent (tan 8) of 0.1 or lower, an<br>
appearance during the final stage of the running is good and heat<br>
buildup is low.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0016]        FIG. 1 is a sectional view of an embodiment of the<br>
pneumatic tire according to the invention.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0017]        The invention will be described in detail below.    The<br>
pneumatic tire according to the invention comprises a tread portion having a cap rubber and a base rubber, and is characterized in that a rubber composition comprising not less than 30 parts by mass of carbon black and not less than 2 parts by mass of silica based on 100 parts by mass of a rubber component is used in the base rubber, and the base rubber has a tensile stress at 300% elongation (M300) of 10-14 MPa and a loss tangent (tan 8) of 0.1 or lower.    By rendering the amount of the carbon black compounded to be not less than 30 parts by mass and further rendering the amount of the silica compounded to be not less than 2 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the rubber component in the rubber composition used in the base rubber, a cut resistance of the tire can be improved to make the appearance during the final stage of the running good.<br>
[0018]        Moreover, by rendering the tensile stress at 300% elongation (M300) of the base rubber to be not higher than 14 MPa and further rendering the loss tangent (tan 8) of the base rubber to be 0.1 or lower, a heat buildup of the tire can be lowered with improving the appearance of the tire during the final stage of the running.    When the tensile stress at 300% elongation (M300) of the base rubber exceeds 14 MPa, the appearance during the final stage of the running is not sufficiently improved.    Also, when the loss tangent (tan 8) of the base rubber exceeds 0.1, the tensile stress at 300% elongation (M300) must be higher than 14 MPa in order to lower the heat buildup sufficiently and thereby the appearance during the final stage of the running and the heat buildup cannot be balanced.    Further, when the tensile stress at 300% elongation (M300) of the base rubber is lower than 10 MPa, the heat buildup cannot be sufficiently lowered even by rendering the loss tangent (tan 8) to be 0.1 or lower.     Moreover, the base rubber preferably has a tensile stress at 300% elongation (M300) of 10-13 MPa and a loss tangent (tan 8) of 0.09 or lower, more preferably has a tensile stress at 300% elongation (M300) of 10-12 MPa and a loss tangent (tan 8) of 0.09 or lower. [0019]        In the rubber composition for the base rubber, the carbon<br>
black preferably has a nitrogen adsorption specific surface area (N2SA) of not higher than 100 m2/g and a dibutyl phthalate (DBP) absorption number of not higher than 90 mL/100g.     When the N2SA of the carbon black exceeds 100 m2/g, the loss tangent (tan 5) of the base rubber tends to exceed 0.1 because the amount of the carbon black compounded is not less than 30 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the rubber component.    Further, when the DBP absorption number exceeds 90 mL/100g, a fatigue resistance may be deteriorated to cause the deterioration of the appearance during the final stage of the running.<br>
[0020]        In the rubber composition for the base rubber, the amount of the silica compounded is preferably within a range of 3 to 8 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the rubber component.     When the amount of the silica compounded is less than 3 parts by mass, the cut resistance of the base rubber tends to be degraded, while when it exceeds 8 parts by mass, the amount of the carbon black compounded must be reduced in order to render the loss tangent (tan 8) of the base rubber to be 0.1 or lower, and thereby a reinforcing property of the base rubber tends to be deteriorated and also the cut resistance tends to be deteriorated.<br>
[0021]        The rubber component used in the rubber composition for the base rubber is not particularly limited, and includes synthetic rubbers such as polybutadiene rubber (BR), polyisoprene rubber (IR), styrene-butadiene copolymer rubber (SBR) and so on, in addition to natural rubber (NR).    Among them, the natural rubber is particularly preferable from the viewpoint of the excellent fracture resistance. These rubber components may be used alone or in a blend, and as the blend is preferable a blend of the natural rubber and the polyisoprene rubber.     Further, as the rubber component, any of an unmodified rubber and a modified rubber may be used and a modified natural rubber is preferably used.<br>
[0022]        For example, the modified natural rubber can be produced by adding a polar group-containing monomer to a natural rubber latex<br>
to graft-polymerize the polar group-containing monomer onto a natural rubber molecule in the natural rubber latex, further coagulating and drying it.    The natural rubber latex used for producing the modified natural rubber is not particularly limited and can include, for example, a field latex, an ammonia-treated latex, a centrifugally concentrated latex, a deproteinized latex treated with a surfactant or an enzyme, and a combination thereof. [0023]        The polar group-containing monomer added to the natural rubber latex has at least one polar group in its molecule and is not particularly limited as long as it can be graft-polymerized with the natural rubber molecule.    The polar group-containing monomer is preferable to have a carbon-carbon double bond in its molecule for the graft-polymerization with the natural rubber molecule and is preferably a polar group-containing vinyl-based monomer.    As a concrete example of the polar group are preferably mentioned amino group, imino group, nitrile group, ammonium group, imide group, amide group, hydrazo group, azo group, diazo group, hydroxyl group, carboxyl group, carbonyl group, epoxy group, oxycarbonyl group, sulfide group, disulfide group, sulfonyl group, sulfinyl group, thiocarbonyl group, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic group, oxygen-containing heterocyclic group, alkoxysilyl group, tin-containing group and so on.

emulsifying agent usable in the emulsification of the natural rubber latex and/or the polar group-containing monomer is not particularly limited and includes nonionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene lauryl ether and the like.<br>
[0033]        The polymerization initiator is not particularly limited and may include various polymerization initiators for the emulsion polymerization, and also the addition method thereof is not particularly limited.    As the commonly used polymerization initiator are mentioned benzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile, 2,2-azobis(2-diaminopropane) hydrochloride, 2,2-azobis(2-diaminopropane) dihydrochloride, 2,2-azobis(2,4-dimethyl-valeronitrile), potassium persulfate, sodium persulfate, ammonium persulfate and so on.    Moreover, it is preferable to use a redox type polymerization initiator for lowering the polymerization temperature.    As a reducing agent to be combined with a peroxide in the redox type polymerization initiator are mentioned, for example, tetraethylene pentamine, mercaptanes, acidic sodium sulfite, a reducing metal ion, ascorbic acid and so on.    As a preferable combination of the peroxide and the reducing agent in the redox type polymerization initiator are mentioned a combination of tert-butyl hydroperoxide and tetraethylene pentamine and so on.    In order to improve the low hysteresis loss and the wear resistance of the rubber composition by using the modified natural rubber without deteriorating the processability, it is important to evenly introduce a small amount of the polar group-containing monomer into each of the natural rubber molecules.    Therefore, the amount of the polymerization initiator added is preferably within a range of 1-100 mol%, and more preferably 10-100 mol% based on the polar group-containing monomer.<br>
[0034] The aforementioned components are charged into a reaction vessel and reacted at 30 to 80°C for 10 minutes to 7 hours to obtain the modified natural rubber latex wherein the polar group-containing<br>
 <br>
monomer is graft-copolymerized onto the natural rubber molecule. Further, the modified natural rubber latex is coagulated and washed, and then dried by using a drying machine such as a vacuum drier, an air drier, a drum drier or the like to obtain the modified natural rubber. The coagulating agent used for coagulating the modified natural rubber latex is not particularly limited, but includes acids such as formic acid, sulfuric acid and the like, and salts such as sodium chloride and the like.<br>
[0035]        The content of the polar group in the modified natural rubber is preferably within a range of 0.001 to 0.5 mmol/g, more preferably within a range of 0.002 to 0.3 mmol/g, and even more preferably within a range of 0.003 to 0.2 mmol/g based on the rubber component in the modified natural rubber.     When the polar group content in the modified natural rubber is less than 0.001 mmol/g, the low loss factor and the wear resistance of the rubber composition may not be sufficiently improved.    While, when the polar group content in the modified natural rubber exceeds 0.5 mmol/g, the physical properties inherent to the natural rubber such as viscoelasticity, S-S characteristic (stress-strain curve in the tensile testing machine) and so on are largely changed to diminish the excellent physical properties inherent to the natural rubber and also the processability of the rubber composition may be largely deteriorated.<br>
[0036]        It is preferable that the rubber composition for the base rubber further comprises 0.1-5 parts by mass of a hydrazide compound and 0.1-5 parts by mass of a compound (Z) having in its molecule at least one reactive group a for the rubber component and two or more adsorption groups b for the silica based on 100 parts by mass of the rubber component, in addition to the carbon black and the silica. [0037]        The hydrazide compound suppresses reversion of the rubber composition and thereby has the effect of lowering heat buildup of the rubber composition.     When the amount of the hydrazide compound compounded is less than 0.1 part by mass, the effect of suppressing the reversion of the rubber composition and the effect of lowering the heat<br>
buildup of the rubber composition are small, while when it exceeds 5<br>
parts by mass, a cost increases but the effects are not further<br>
improved.<br>

[0055]        Preferably, the rubber composition for the base rubber does not comprise a silane coupling agent.

[0057]        Then, the pneumatic tire according to the invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawing.    The tire shown in FIG. 1 comprises a pair of bead portions 1, a pair of side portions 2, a tread portion 3, a radial carcass 5 toroidally extending between bead cores 4 embedded in the bead portions 1 respectively, and a belt 6 composed of plural belt layers disposed on an outside of a crown portion of the radial carcass 5 in the radial direction of the tire, wherein the tread portion 3 has a base rubber 7 disposed on an outside of the belt 6 in the radial direction of the tire and a cap rubber 8 disposed on an outside of the base rubber 7 in the radial direction of the tire, i.e., has a so-called "cap/base structure".<br>
 [0058]        In the base rubber 7 of the illustrated pneumatic tire, the above-mentioned rubber composition comprising not less than 30 parts by mass of the carbon black and not less than 2 parts by mass of the silica based on 100 parts by mass of the rubber component is used, and the base rubber 7 has a tensile stress at 300% elongation (M300) of 10-14 MPa and a loss tangent (tan 5) of not higher than 0.1, in which the appearance during the final stage of the running is good and the heat buildup is sufficiently reduced.     In this context, the other members except the base rubber 7 of the pneumatic tire according to the invention is not particularly limited, and known members can be used.     Moreover, as a gas filled into the pneumatic tire of the invention can be used usual air or air having a regulated partial oxygen pressure but also inert gases such as nitrogen, argon, helium and so on.<br>
[0059]        In the pneumatic tire according to the invention, an outer surface 9 of the base rubber 7 in a radial direction of the tire (i.e., an interface between the based rubber 7 and the cap rubber 8) is preferably located more outward in a radial direction of the tire than a groove bottom 10 of the tire.    Since the base rubber 7 is good in the appearance during the final stage of the running and low in the heat buildup, these effects are notably expressed when the outer surface 9 of the base rubber 7 in a radial direction of the tire is located more outward than the groove bottom 10 of the tire in a radial direction of the tire.    Moreover, the pneumatic tire of the invention is preferable as a heavy duty tire. [0060]        <examples><br>
The following examples are given in illustration of the invention and are not intended as limitations thereof. [0061]        A rubber composition having a formulation as shown in Tables 1 and 2 is prepared according to a usual method, and a heavy duty pneumatic tire having a structure shown in FIG. 1, a tire size of 11R22.5 and a block pattern is prepared by using the rubber composition in the base rubber.     The resulting tire is sliced and the<br>
base rubber is taken out therefrom to prepare a JIS No. 3 test specimen according to the predetermined method, and a tensile stress at 300% elongation (M300) thereof is measured by conducting a tensile test according to JIS K 6251.     Further, a loss tangent (tan 8) is measured by using a spectrometer manufactured by Toyo Seiki Corporation under a condition that a strain is 1%, a frequency is 52 Hz and a temperature is 100°C.    Furthermore, a temperature during the running and a fracture resistance are evaluated according to the following methods.    Results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. [0062]        (1) Temperature during the running<br>
The test tire is run on a drum under a condition that a load is normal and a speed is 60 km/h, a temperature near the edge of the belt on this occasion is measured by a thermocouple, and a temperature difference is determined based on a temperature near the edge of the belt in the tire of Example 1.     The minus side indicates that the temperature near the edge of the belt during the running is low and the low heat buildup is excellent. [0063]        (2) Fracture resistance<br>
The test tire is mounted onto a drive shaft of a truck and is run in practice for 50000 km.    Then, the tire is collected and the number of the chippings in the tire is visually counted.    The smaller the number, the more excellent the fracture resistance. [0064][0065]<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0066]        *1     The modified natural rubber synthesized according to the following method is used.<br>
<production example of modified natural rubber> A field latex is subjected to a centrifugal separation with a latex separator [made by Saito Separator Limited] at a revolution speed of 7500 rpm to obtain a concentrated latex having a dry rubber concentration of 60%.     1000 g of the concentrated latex is charged into a stainless reaction vessel provided with a stirrer and a temperature-regulating jacket, and an emulsion previously formed by adding 10 mL of water and 90 mg of an emulsifying agent [Emulgen 1108, made by Kao Corporation] to 3.0 g of N,N-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate is added together with 990 mL of water, and then stirred for 30 minutes at normal temperature while substituting with nitrogen. Then, 1.2 g of tert-butyl hydroperoxide and 1.2 g of tetraethylene pentamine are added as a polymerization initiator to conduct reaction at 40°C for 30 minutes, whereby a modified natural rubber latex is obtained.     The modified natural rubber latex is coagulated by adding formic acid to adjust pH to 4.7.    The thus obtained solid is treated with a clapper 5 times, crumbed through a shredder and dried by a hot air drier at 110°C for 210 minutes to obtain a modified natural rubber. It is confirmed from a mass of the thus obtained modified natural rubber that the conversion of N,N-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate added as a monomer is 100%.    Also, the separation of a homopolymer is tried by extracting the modified natural rubber with a petroleum ether and further extracting with a 2:1 mixed solvent of acetone and methanol, but the homopolymer is not detected from the analysis of the extract, so that it is confirmed that 100% of the monomer added is introduced into the natural rubber molecule.     Therefore, the polar group content in the resulting modified natural rubber is 0.027 mmol/g based on the rubber component in the natural rubber latex. [0067]        *2    DBP absorption number = 72 mL/100g, N2SA = 78 m2/g<br>

[0069]        To the contrary, the tires of the Comparative Examples 1, 2, 4 and 5 comprising the base rubber having a loss tangent (tan 5) of higher than 0.1 have a high heat buildup.    Further, the tire of the Comparative Example 3 comprising the base rubber having a tensile stress at 300% elongation (M300) of higher than 14 MPa has a high heat buildup, in which the number of the chippings is large and the appearance during the final stage of the running is bad.<br>
