REPEATER WITH DIGITAL CHANNELIZER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of communications. More specifically, trie present invention relates to a repeater for a communication or transmission system (e.g. bi-directional cellular communication systems).<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Degradation of signal-to-noise ratio ("SNR") occurs to a signal carried along a transmission medium (e.g. coax, unshielded conductor, wave guide, open air or even optical fiber). SNR degradation is one factor which may limit bandwidth over a transmission medium. In order to improve the SNR of signals being transmitted over long distances, and accordingly to augment the transmission distance and/or data rate, signal repeaters may be placed at intervals along the transmitting path. Repeaters are well known and may be used for optical, microwave and radio frequency (RF) communication systems. Repeaters have been used as part of cellular transmission systems to extend the range of coverage between a cellular base station and a cellular handset.<br>
However, the use of a repeater for one or more channels at one or more frequencies within a shared frequency range of the spectrum (e.g. 800 MHz to 830 Mhz) may produce interference. Turning now to Fig. 1A, there is shown a spectral diagram exemplifying the channel frequencies a first cellular operator may be using within the frequency range of 800 to 830 MHz. Turning now to Fig. 1B, there is shown a spectral diagram exemplifying the channel frequencies a<br><br>
second cellular operator in the same geographic location as the first may be using within the same frequency range, 800 to 830 MHz. As can be seen from the Figs. 1A and 1B, each operator's channel frequencies may be distinct from the other. However, two or more channel frequencies of one operator may either be between two or more channel frequencies of the other operator or may be on either side one or more of the other operator's channel frequencies.<br>
In order for an operator to use a repeater in the situation described above and exemplified in Figs. 1A and 1B, the operator would either need a separate response for each channel, or the operator may use a broader band repeater to cover a frequency range within which several of the operator's channels reside. However, if a broader band repeater is used, the repeater may inadvertently retransmit one or more channels belonging to both operators. The retransmission of another operator's communication channels) has both legal and business implications which a cellular operator may prefer to avoid.<br>
Analog channelized repeaters exist in the prior art. Channelized repeaters of the prior art use analog filters to exclude or filter out all signals or communication channels not belonging to the operator whose channels are to be repeated. For example, if the repeater's band of operation is 800 to 830 MHz, and the operator using the repeater has communication channels at 805 MHz, 807 MHz, and 809 MHz, the repeater may be equipped with analog filters which only allow or pass signals at the frequencies of the operator's channels. The analog channelized repeater thus retransmits only signals at the frequencies of the operator's communication channels.<br><br>
Analog channelized repeaters of the prior art have numerous drawbacks which the present invention aims to address.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
As part of the present invention, a receiver may receive a signal associated with a certain communication channel at a specific frequency. An analog to digital converter may generate a digital signal correlated to the received signal and the digital signal may be passed through a digital filter configured to filter the digital signal and pass frequency components at or around the frequency of the communication channel's specific frequency. A digital to analog converter may generate an analog signal correlated to the filtered digital signal and a transmitter may transmit the analog signal.<br>
According to some embodiments of the present invention, there may be included a second digital filter configured to pass frequency components at or around a second frequency associated with a second communication channel.<br>
According to some embodiments of the present invention, there may be included a down-converter to down-convert a received signal to an intermediate signal. An up-converter may also be included to up-convert to a transmission frequency an analog signal correlated to the filtered digital signal.<br>

As part of the present invention, a receiver receives a signal associated with a communication channel at a specific frequency. An analog to digital converter generates a digital signal correlated to the received signal and the digital signal may be passed through a digital filter configured to filter the digital signal and pass frequency components at or around the frequency of the communication channel's specific frequency. A digital to analog converter generates an analog signal correlated to the filtered digital signal and a transmitter may transmit the analog signal.<br>
According to some embodiments of the present invention, there is included a second digital filter configured to pass frequency components at or around a second frequency associated with a second communication channel.<br><br>
According to some embodiments of the present invention, there is included a down-converter to down-convert a received signal to an intermediate signal. An up-converter may also be included to up-convert to a transmission frequency an analog signal correlated to the filtered digital signal.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 2, there is shown a block diagram of a bi-directional repeater 100 with a digital channelizer according to the present invention. The bi-directional repeater 100 may include two basic sections: (A) an upstream or up-link section which receives signals from a mobile device (e.g. cell phone) and retransmits the signal to a base-station; and (B) a downstream or down-link section which receives signals from a base-station and retransmits the signals to a mobile device.<br>
Looking first at the up-link section (A) from left to right on Fig. 2, there may be an input filter 110U, which for this example, may be a radio frequency ("RF") filter, or more specifically, may be a filter tuned to pass frequencies in the range of 800 to 830 MHz, for example. The input RF filter 110U may receive signals from an antenna and may pass frequencies in the frequency range of one or more communication channels to be repeated to a down converter 120U. The down converter 120U may mix a received signal with a sine or cosine wave of a given frequency such that the received signal is down-converted to an intermediate frequency ("IF"). Either the input RF filter 110U or the down converter 120U may include a signal amplifier (Not shown in Fig. 2). An analog to digital ("A/D") converter 130U may sample the IF signal and may generate a digital signal representing the sampled IF signal. The digital signal representing<br><br>
the IF signal may enter digital filter bank 140U. Fig. 3 shows a more detailed view of digital filter bank 140U including digital filters 140a to 140d.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 3, there is shown a block diagram of a digital filter bank 140U including digital filters 140a to 140d. A digital signal entering digital filter bank 140U may be applied to each of the digital filters 140a through 140d and the output of each of the digital filters may be combined by an adder 142 or by a functionally equivalent device. Each of the filters within the filter bank 140U may have a separate and distinct frequency response. Digital filters are well known in the field of communications. Implementation of a digital filter bank may be performed on a single or multiple processors (e.g. DSP) or may be implemented on a single or multiple dedicated digital filtering circuits. In the example of Fig. 3, there is shown four discrete digital filter circuits. As part of some embodiment of the present invention, digital filters 140a through 140d may be field programmable digital filters ("FROF"). That is, each filter's transfer function, along with its frequency response, may be reprogrammed or adjusted.<br>
Turning now to Figs. 4A through 4B, there are shown examples of possible frequency responses for digital filters 140a through 140d of Fig. 3, where digital filters 140a through 140b correspond to the first through the fourth communication channels exemplified in Fig. 1A, respectively. That is, the impulse response or frequency transfer characteristic for each digital filter 140a through 140d may be separately set or adjusted to pass frequency components of a digital signal that are at or around the carrier frequency of the filter's corresponding communication channel. For example; digital filter 140a may be programmed with a transfer function having a band pass frequency response<br><br>
peaking at or around the carrier frequency of the first communication channel shown in Fig. 1A; Digital filter 140b may be programmed with a transfer function having a band pass frequency response peaking at or around the carrier frequency of the second communication channel shown in Fig. 1A, etc...<br>
The design of digital filters and digital filter transfer functions is well known. Although specific filters and transfer functions are mentioned above, any digital filter and transfer function combination, currently known or to be devised in the future, may be used as part of the present invention.<br>
Now turning back to Fig. 2, there is shown, directly after the digital filter bank 140U, a digital to analog converter ("D/A") 150U. The D/A 150U may convert the filtered digital signal output of the digital filter bank 140U to an analog signal, which analog signal may then be up-converted by up-converter 160U to the original frequency which was received at input RF filter 110U. An output filter 170U may be used to remove any harmonics which may have been introduced into the signal by the up-converter 160U. Either the up-converter 160U or the output RF filter 170U may include a signal amplifier (not shown in Fig. 2). The filtered signal may then propagate to and out of a transmission antenna.<br>
The downstream or down-link (B) section of the bi-directional repeater 100 may almost mirror the up-stream section (A) discussed above. A difference being that the input RF filter 110D, digital filter bank 140D filters and output RF filter 170D may be tuned to receive and pass frequencies of downstream communication channels, as opposed to passing frequencies at or around upstream communication channels.<br><br>
The specific frequency bands to which each of the filters is set may depend on the specific frequencies of the communication channels, upstream and downstream, an operator may wish to repeat within a specific geographic location. The frequencies shown in Fig. 1A and 1B are only examples of such communication channel frequencies. No distinction is made between upstream and downstream channels in Figs. 1A and 1B. However, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that in a cellular system, there may be a corresponding upstream communication channel for each down stream communication channel. The relation between upstream channel frequency and downstream channel frequency may be fixed, or each may be negotiated separately between a mobile device and a base station.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 5, there is shown another possible embodiment of a bi-directional repeater 100 according to the present invention. As in the bidirectional repeater of Fig. 2, there are two sections; (A) an upstream or up-link section, and (B) a downstream or down-link section. Also, as in the embodiment of Fig. 2, the up-link and down-link sections may substantially mirror one another except for the frequencies they are tuned to pass and retransmit<br>
Looking at the downstream or down-link section (B) of the bi-directional repeater 100 of Fig. 5, there may be a duplexer including an input RF filter 110D. The input RF filter 110D may lead to a pre-filtering stage 115D which may include a low noise amplifier ("LNA") and an attenuator. The oulput of the pre-filtering block 115D may enter an RF unit 125D which may down convert the output and may also include an A/p converter. Digital filters in digital filter block 140D may be similar to the ones described for Figs. 2, 3 or 4A through 4D, or<br><br>
may be any other digital filters suitable to the present invention. The output of the digital filter block 140D may enter the RF unit 125D which may up convert the output and may also include a D/A converter. A power amplifier block 145D-may include an attenuator, a high-power amplifier, and a power monitor. An automatic gain control circuit ("AGC") may adjust the attenuator such that the output signal from the power amplifier block 145D remains substantially steady. The output signal of the power amplifier block 145D may propagate to and through a duplexer including an output filter 170D.<br>
As for the bi-directional repeater 100 in Fig. 2, the bi-directional repeater 100 of Fig. 5 may be configured to repeat specific sets of communication channels, at or around specific carrier frequencies, in the upstream direction, and to repeat specific sets of communication channels, at or around specific carrier frequencies, in the downstream direction. Digital filters in the digital filter banks or block, 140U and 140D, may be adjusted to pass only frequencies at or around the carrier frequencies of the relevant communication channels. Carrier frequency offsets due to up-conversion or down-conversion may be taken into account and .compensated for within the digital filters. Furthermore, the bidirectional repeater 100 of the present invention may be adjusted to notch out narrow band noise interference within the communication channels' frequency band.<br>
While certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes, and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the<br><br>
