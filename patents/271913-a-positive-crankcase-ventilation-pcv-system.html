				<td>POSITIVE CRANKCASE VENTILATION SYSTEM FOR AN INTERNAL<br>
COMBUSTION ENGINE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
60/955,984, filed August 15, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to positive crankcase ventilation systems for use<br>
with internal combustion engines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) systems have been used within internal<br>
combustion engines to reduce emission of contaminants by recirculating blow-by gases<br>
and crankcase vapors, or PCV gases, into combustion chambers of the internal<br>
combustion engine for subsequent burning therein. This is commonly accomplished by<br>
conducting the PCV gases from a crankcase defined by the internal combustion engine<br>
into an intake system or intake manifold where it is subsequently drawn into the<br>
combustion chambers. If the gases are drawn into an intake manifold, a PCV valve is<br>
generally required to control the amount of gas flow because the manifold vacuum<br>
varies greatly and generally inversely to the amount of PCV gases required to be<br>
recirculated. However, where the PCV gases are recirculated into the air intake<br>
system, it has been generally satisfactory to control the gas flow by means of an orifice.<br>
[0004] The gases which enter the PCV system from the crankcase and flow to the<br>
combustion chambers can have oil particles suspended therein. The oil particles can<br>
travel through the PCV system, with the PCV gases, to the intake system and<br>
combustion chambers in which they are burned with the air and fuel. If the amount of<br>
such oil particles becomes excessive, the engine emissions and oil consumption can<br><br>
increase. Therefore, PCV systems can include a filter device for separating oil<br>
particles from the gases to reduce the amount of oil which flows to, and is burned<br>
within, the combustion chambers. Such a filter device can include a semi-permeable<br>
filter element through which the PCV gases flow. The filter element typically has small<br>
openings or interstices through which the PCV gases, and the oil particles contained<br>
therein, must pass. The openings are sufficiently sized so that the oil is strained from<br>
the PCV gases and remains in the filter element. The filter element can become<br>
clogged with oil and thereby obstruct the gas flow therethrough. An additional<br>
consideration is freezing or icing of the PCV system in cold climates. Condensed water<br>
in the PCV system can gather and freeze, obstructing the gas flow or allowing icing of<br>
intake system components. Mounting the PCV system components internally to the<br>
engine will reduce the risk of icing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] A positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system is provided for an internal<br>
combustion engine having an engine block defining a crankcase volume containing<br>
gases and oil particles suspended therein. The PCV system includes a shaft member<br>
rotatably supported within the engine block and defining a generally cylindrical cavity<br>
extending longitudinally within the shaft member. The shaft member further defines at<br>
least one orifice operable to communicate the gases and oil particles from the crankcase<br>
volume to the generally cylindrical cavity.<br>
[0006] A cover member is removably mounted to the engine block and is operable<br>
to enclose at least a portion of the shaft member. The cover member at least partially<br>
defines a PCV feed passage and an oil drain passage. A hollow tube member is formed<br>
on the cover member and at least a portion of the tube member is coaxially received<br>
within the generally cylindrical cavity of the shaft member to define an outer region and<br>
an inner region of the generally cylindrical cavity. The outer region is in<br>
communication with the oil drain passage and the inner region is in communication with<br>
the PCV feed passage.<br><br>
[0007] A centrifugal separator is disposed within the generally cylindrical cavity<br>
and is operable to effect rotation of the gases and oil particles within the generally<br>
cylindrical cavity. At least a portion of the oil particles are forced to the outer region<br>
of the generally cylindrical cavity by the centrifugal separator for communication to the<br>
oil drain passage. Additionally, at least a portion of the gases are communicated from<br>
the inner region to the PCV feed passage.<br>
[0008] The above features and advantages of the present invention are readily<br>
apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out the<br>
invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0009] Figure 1 is a schematic diagrammatic representation of a portion of an internal<br>
combustion engine having a positive crankcase ventilation system incorporating a<br>
centrifugal separator within a balance shaft of the internal combustion engine;<br>
[0010] Figure 2 is a perspective view of an example cover member including a tube<br>
member according to the present invention; and<br>
[0011] Figure 3 is an environmental perspective sectional view of the internal<br>
combustion engine of Figure 1 further illustrating components of the positive crankcase<br>
ventilation system.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0012] Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to like<br>
or similar components throughout the several views there is schematically depicted in<br>
Figure 1 a portion of an internal combustion engine, generally indicated at 10. The<br>
internal combustion engine 10 includes an engine block 12 at least partially defining a<br>
crankcase volume 14. The internal combustion engine 10 further includes a crankshaft<br>
16 and a shaft member 18, for example a balance shaft. The crankshaft 16 and the shaft<br>
member 18 are rotatably supported within the engine block 12 by respective first and<br>
second bearings 20 and 22.<br>
[0013] A first gear member 24 is mounted to the crankshaft 16 for unitary rotation<br>
therewith, while a second gear member 26 is mounted to the shaft member 18 for unitary<br><br>
rotation therewith. The first and second gear members 24 and 26 are meshingly engaged<br>
with one another to maintain rotational timing between the crankshaft 16 and the shaft<br>
member 18. Those skilled in the art of engine design will recognize other means for<br>
maintaining rotational timing between the crankshaft 16 and the shaft member 18, for<br>
example a chain drive system.<br>
[0014] A cover member 28 is removably mounted to the engine block 12 and is<br>
operable to partially enclose the shaft member 18. An end portion 30 of the crankshaft<br>
16 extends through the cover member 28. A rotary seal 32, such as a lip seal, is mounted<br>
to the cover member 28 and is operable to sealingly engage the end portion 30 of the<br>
crankshaft 16 to effect sealing of the crankcase volume 14. The cover member 28 is<br>
preferably formed from cast metal or composite material and includes a tube member 34<br>
extending therefrom. The cover member defines a positive crankcase ventilation (PCV)<br>
feed passage 36 and an oil drain passage 38. The oil drain passage 38 includes a one-way<br>
check valve 40. A rotary seal 42 is mounted to the cover member 28 and sealingly<br>
engages the shaft member 18.<br>
[0015] The shaft member 18 includes an inner wall 43 which defines a generally<br>
cylindrical cavity 44 that extends longitudinally along the shaft member 18 and has a<br>
diameter, indicated as D in Figure 1. The shaft member 18 further defines orifices 46 that<br>
extends radially inward. A vortex or centrifugal separator 48 is disposed within the<br>
generally cylindrical cavity 44. The centrifugal separator 48 includes a plurality of<br>
blades or vanes 50. At least a portion of the tube member 34 is received within the<br>
generally cylindrical cavity 44. The tube member 34 is positioned coaxially within the<br>
generally cylindrical cavity 44, as such; the tube member 34 is operable to divide the<br>
cylindrical cavity 44 into an outer region 52 and an inner region 54.<br>
[0016] The shaft member 18, centrifugal separator 48, and the cover member 28<br>
cooperate to form a portion of a PCV system, generally indicated at 56. During operation<br>
of the internal combustion engine 10, the PCV system 56 is effective to introduce gases,<br>
indicated by arrow 58, from within the crankcase volume 14 into a combustion chamber<br>
(not shown) of the internal combustion engine 10 for combustion therein. The gases 58<br>
may include air and blow-by gases.<br><br>
[0017] Additionally, the gases 58 typically include an amount of oil entrained therein.<br>
To maintain low exhaust emissions and oil consumption, it is desirable to remove the oil<br>
from the gases 58 prior to introduction to the combustion chamber of the internal<br>
combustion engine 10.<br>
[0018] The gases 58 enter the PCV system 56 though the orifices 46 defined by the<br>
shaft member 18. The gases 58 are subsequently introduced to the centrifugal separator<br>
48 which, by virtue of the rotation of the shaft member 18, is operable to impart<br>
rotational motion or swirl to the gases 58. The centrifugal forces exerted on the gases 58<br>
as a result of the rotational motion cause the relatively heavy oil droplets or particles,<br>
indicated as arrows 60, to be forced outward toward the inner wall 43 of the shaft<br>
member 18, while the relatively light PCV gases, indicated by arrows 62, remain<br>
centrally located within the generally cylindrical cavity 44.<br>
[0019] At least a portion of the oil particles 60 is introduced to the outer region 52 for<br>
subsequent introduction to the oil drain passage 38 to be communicated to the crankcase<br>
volume 14. At least a portion of the PCV gases 62 is introduced to the inner region 54 to<br>
be communicated to the PCV feed passage 36 for subsequent introduction to the<br>
combustion chamber of the internal combustion engine 10.<br>
[0020] An orifice 64 is defined by the cover member 28 and is operable to provide<br>
communication between the PCV feed passage 36 and the oil drain passage 38. The<br>
orifice 64 enables oil particles 60 contained within the PCV gases that have fallen out of<br>
suspension within the PCV feed passage 36 to drain through the oil drain passage 38 for<br>
reintroduction to the crankcase volume 14. The one-way check valve 40 is operable to<br>
allow the free flow of oil particles 60 into the crankcase volume 14, while blocking the<br>
entry of gases 58 from within the crankcase volume 14 into the oil drain passage 38.<br>
[0021] The orifices 46 are positioned upstream of the centrifugal separator at a<br>
distance A, while the centrifugal separator 48 is positioned upstream of the tube member<br>
34 at a distance B. In a non-limiting example embodiment, the distance A will be at least<br>
two times the diameter D of the generally cylindrical cavity 44, while the distance B will<br>
be at least ten times the diameter D of the generally cylindrical cavity 44. In another<br>
example embodiment, the shaft member 18 is disposed within the crankcase volume 14 is<br><br>
a quiescent area or an area of low windage such that the oil entrained within the gases 58<br>
is minimized.<br>
[0022] Referring now to Figure 2 and with continued reference to Figure 1, a<br>
perspective view of one example cover member 28 of Figure 1 is shown. The cover<br>
member 28 includes the tube member 34 extending therefrom. Upon assembly of the<br>
cover member 28 to the engine block 12, the tube member 34 extends inward from the<br>
cover member 28 within the cylindrical cavity 4, as further illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
[0023] Referring now to Figure 3, with continued reference to Figures 1 and 2, an<br>
environmental perspective cross-sectional view of the internal combustion engine 10 of<br>
Figure 1 is shown. The engine block 12 includes a plurality of bulkheads 66 operable to<br>
rotatably support the crankshaft 16, shown in Figure 1. The bulkheads 66 further define<br>
the crankcase volume 14. The cover member 28 is removably mounted to the engine<br>
block 12 via a plurality of threaded fasteners 68, such as bolts or screws. The tube<br>
member 34 of the cover member 28 extends into the cylindrical cavity 44 and is operable<br>
to divide the cylindrical cavity 44 into the outer region 52 and the inner region 54 as<br>
discussed in Figure 1.<br>
[0024] While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in<br>
detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
