the tautomers, enantiomers, diastereomers, the mixtures and the salts thereof.<br>
Preferred are compounds of general formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
wherein R is as hereinbefore defined, as well as their tautomers and salts. Also preferred are compounds of general formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R is as hereinbefore defined, as well as their tautomers and salts.<br>
According to the invention the compounds of general formula I are obtained by methods known per se, for example by the following methods:<br>
a) reacting a compound of general formula<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
wherein<br>
R is as hereinbefore defined and<br>
Z1 denotes a leaving group such as a halogen atom, a substituted hydroxy, mercapto, sulphinyl, sulphonyl or sulphonyloxy group such as a chlorine or bromine atom, a methanesulphonyl or methanesulphonyloxy group, with 3-aminopiperidine, the enantiomers or the salts thereof.<br>
The reaction is expediently carried out in a solvent such as isopropanol, butanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulphoxide, ethyleneglycol monomethylether, ethyleneglycol diethylether or sulpholane, optionally in the presence of an inorganic or tertiary organic base, e.g. sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or potassium hydroxide, a tertiary organic base, e.g. triethylamine, or in the presence of N-ethyl-diisopropylamine (Hunig base), while these organic bases may simultaneously also serve as solvent, and optionally in the presence of a reaction accelerator such as an alkali metal halide or a palladium-based catalyst at temperatures between -20 and 180°C, but preferably at temperatures between -10 and 120°C. The reaction may, however, also be carried out without solvent or in an excess of the 3-aminopiperidine.<br>
b) deprotecting a compound of general formula<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
wherein R is as hereinbefore defined.<br>
The tert.-butyloxycarbonyl group is preferably cleaved by treating with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid or by treating with bromotrimethylsilane or iodotrimethylsilane, optionally using a solvent such as methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, dioxane, methanol, isopropanol or diethyl ether at temperatures between 0 and 80°C.<br>
In the reactions described hereinbefore, any reactive groups present such as amino, alkylamino or imino groups may be protected during the reaction by conventional protecting groups which are cleaved again after the reaction.<br>
For example, a protecting group for an amino, alkylamino or imino group may be a formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, ethoxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl or2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group and additionally, for the amino group, a phthalyl group.<br>
Any protecting group used is optionally subsequently cleaved for example by hydrolysis in an aqueous solvent, e.g. in water, isopropanol/water, acetic acid/water, tetrahydrofuran/water or dioxane/water, in the presence of an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or in the presence of an alkali metal base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide or aprotically, e.g. in the presence of iodotrimethylsilane, at temperatures between 0 and 120°C, preferably at temperatures between 10 and 100°C.<br>
^However, a benzyl, methoxybenzyl or benzyloxycarbonyl group is cleaved, for example, hydrogenolytically, e.g. with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium/charcoal in a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate or glacial acetic acid optionally with the addition of an acid such as hydrochloric acid at temperatures between 0 and 100°C, but preferably at ambient temperatures between 20 and 60°C, and at a hydrogen pressure of 1 to 7 bar, but preferably from 3 to 5 bar. However, a 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group is preferably cleaved in trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of anisole.<br>
A tert.-butyloxycarbonyl group is preferably cleaved by treating with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid or by treating with iodotrimethylsilane optionally using a solvent such as methylene chloride, dioxane, methanol or diethyl ether.<br>
A trifluoroacetyl group is preferably cleaved by treating with an acid such as hydrochloric acid optionally in the presence of a solvent such as acetic acid at temperatures between 50 and 120°C or by treating with sodium hydroxide solution, optionally in the presence of a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at temperatures between 0 and 50°C.<br>
A phthalyl group is preferably cleaved in the presence of hydrazine or a primary amine such as methylamine, ethylamine, ethanolamine or n-butylamine in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, toluene/water or dioxane at temperatures between 20 and 50°C.<br>
Moreover, the compounds of general formula I obtained may be resolved into their enantiomers and/or diastereomers, as mentioned hereinbefore. Thus, for example, cis/trans mixtures may be resolved into their cis and trans isomers, and compounds with at least one optically active carbon atom may be separated into their enantiomers.<br>
, for example, the cisltrans mixtures obtained may be separated by chromatography into their c/s and trans isomers, the compounds of general formula I obtained which occur as racemates may be separated by methods known per se (cf. Allinger N. L. and Eliel E. L. in "Topics in Stereochemistry", Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971) into their optical enantiomers and compounds of general formula I with at least 2 asymmetric carbon atoms may be resolved into their diastereomers on the basis of their physical-chemical differences using methods known per se, e.g. by chromatography and/or fractional crystallisation, and, if these compounds are obtained in racemic form, they may subsequently be resolved into the enantiomers as mentioned above.<br>
The enantiomers are preferably separated by column separation on chiral phases or by recrystallisation from an optically active solvent or by reacting with an optically active substance which forms salts or derivatives such as e.g. esters or amides with the racemic compound, particularly acids and the activated derivatives or alcohols thereof, and separating the diastereomeric mixture of salts or derivatives thus obtained, e.g. on the basis of their differences in solubility, whilst the free antipodes may be released from the pure diastereomeric salts or derivatives by the action of suitable agents. Optically active acids in common use are e.g. the D- and L-forms of tartaric acid or dibenzoyltartaric acid, di-o-tolyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphorsulphonic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid or quinic acid. An optically active alcohol may be, for example, (+) or (-)-menthol and an optically active acyl group in amides, for example, may be a (+)- or (-)-menthyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of formula I obtained may be converted into the salts thereof, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the physiologically acceptable salts with inorganic or organic acids. Acids which may be used for this purpose include for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid or maleic acid.<br>
.The compounds of general formulae II and III used as starting compounds are either known from the literature or may be prepared by methods known from the literature (see Examples I to XXV).<br>
As already mentioned hereinbefore, the compounds of general formula I according to the invention and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof have valuable pharmacological properties, particularly an inhibiting effect on the enzyme DPP-IV.<br>
The biological properties of the new compounds were investigated as follows:<br>
The ability of the substances and their corresponding salts to inhibit the DPP-IV activity can be demonstrated in an experiment in which an extract of the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 is used as the DPP IV source. The differentiation of the cells in order to induce the DPP-IV expression was carried out in accordance with the description by Reiher et al. in an article entitled "Increased expression of intestinal cell line Caco-2", which appeared in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Vol. 90, pp. 5757-5761 (1993). The cell extract was obtained from cells solubilised in a buffer (10mM Tris HCI, 0.15 M NaCI, 0.04 t.i.u. aprotinin, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, pH 8.0) by centrifugation at 35,000 g for 30 minutes at 4°C (to remove cell debris).<br>
The DPP-IV assay was carried out as follows:<br>
50 ul of substrate solution (AFC; AFC is amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin), final concentration 100 uM, were placed in black microtitre plates. 20 ul of assay buffer (final concentrations 50 mM Tris HCI pH 7.8, 50 mM NaCI, 1 % DMSO) was pipetted in. The reaction was started by the addition of 30 ul of solubilised Caco-2 protein (final concentration 0.14 pg of protein per well). The test substances under investigation were typically added prediluted to 20 ul, while the volume of assay buffer was then reduced accordingly. The reaction was carried out at ambient temperature, the incubation period was 60 minutes. Then the fluorescence was measured in a Victor 1420 Multilabel Counter, with the excitation wavelength at 405 nm and the emission wavelength at 535 nm. Dummy values (corresponding to 0 %<br>
activity) were obtained in mixtures with no Caco-2 protein (volume replaced by assay buffer), control values (corresponding to 100 % activity) were obtained in mixtures without any added substance. The potency of the test substances in question, expressed as IC50 values, were calculated from dosage/activity curves consisting of 11 measured points in each case. The following results were obtained:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The compounds prepared according to the invention are well tolerated as no toxic side effects could be detected in rats after the oral administration of 10 mg/kg of the compound of Example 1 (30), for example.<br>
In view of their ability to inhibit DPP-IV activity, the compounds of general formula I according to the invention and the corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are suitable for influencing any conditions or diseases which can be affected by the inhibition of the DPP-IV activity. It is therefore to be expected that the compounds according to the invention will be suitable for the prevention or treatment of diseases or conditions such as type I and type II diabetes mellitus, pre-diabetes, reduced glucose tolerance or changes in the fasting blood sugar, diabetic<br>
wmplications (e.g. retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathies), metabolic acidosis or ketosis, reactive hypoglycaemia, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidaemias of various origins, arthritis, atherosclerosis and related diseases, obesity, allograft transplantation and osteoporosis caused by calcitonin. In addition, these substances are suitable for preventing B-cell degeneration such as e.g. apoptosis or necrosis of pancreatic B-cells. The substances are also suitable for improving or restoring the function of pancreatic cells and additionally increasing the size and number of pancreatic B-cells. Additionally, on the basis of the role of the glucagon-like peptides such as e.g. GLP-1 and GLP-2 and their link with DPP-IV inhibition, it is expected that the compounds according to the invention will be suitable for achieving, inter alia, a sedative or tranquillising effect, as well as having a favourable effect on catabolic states after operations or hormonal stress responses or possibly reducing mortality and morbidity after myocardial infarct. Moreover, they are suitable for treating any conditions connected with the effects mentioned above and mediated by GLP-1 or GLP-2. The compounds according to the invention may also be used as diuretics or antihypertensives and are suitable for preventing and treating acute kidney failure. The compounds according to the invention may also be used to treat inflammatory complaints of the respiratory tract. They are also suitable for preventing and treating chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as e.g. irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and also pancreatitis. It is also expected that they can be used for all kinds of injury or damage to the gastrointestinal tract such as may occur in colitis and enteritis, for example. Moreover, it is expected that DPP-IV inhibitors and hence the compounds according to the invention can be used to treat infertility or to improve fertility in humans or mammals, particularly if the infertility is connected with insulin resistance or with polycystic ovary syndrome. On the other hand these substances are suitable for influencing sperm motility and are thus suitable for use as male contraceptives. In addition, the substances are suitable for treating growth hormone deficiencies connected with restricted growth, and may reasonably be used for all indications for which growth hormone may be used. The compounds according to the invention are also suitable, on the basis of their inhibitory effect on DPP-IV, for treating various autoimmune diseases such as e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, thyroiditis<br>
Basedow's disease, etc. They may also be used to treat viral diseases and also, for example, in HIV infections, for stimulating blood production, in benign prostatic hyperplasia, gingivitis, as well as for the treatment of neuronal defects and neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, for example. The compounds described may also be used for the treatment of tumours, particularly for modifying tumour invasion and also metastasisation; examples here are their use in treating T-cell lymphomas, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, cell-based pancreatic carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas or breast cancers. Other indications are stroke, ischaemia of various origins, Parkinson's disease and migraine. In addition, further indications include follicular and epidermal hyperkeratoses, increased keratinocyte proliferation, psoriasis, encephalomyelitis, glomerulonephritis, lipodystrophies, as well as psychosomatic, depressive and neuropsychiatric diseases of all kinds.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may also be used in conjunction with other active substances. Suitable therapeutic agents for such combinations include for example antidiabetic agents such as metformin, sulphonylureas (e.g. glibenclamid, tolbutamide, glimepiride), nateglinide, repaglinide, thiazolidinediones (e.g. rosiglitazone, pioglitazone), PPAR-gamma agonists (e.g. Gl 262570) and antagonists, PPAR-gamma/alpha modulators (e.g. KRP 297), PPAR-gamma/alpha/delta modulators, AMPK activators, ACC1 and ACC2 inhibitors, DGAT inhibitors, SMT3 receptor agonists, 11R-HSD inhibitors, FGF19 agonists or mimetics, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g. acarbose, voglibose), other DPPIV inhibitors, alpha2 antagonists, insulin and insulin analogues, GLP-1 and GLP-1 analogues (e.g. exendin-4) or amylin. Also, combinations with SGLT2 inhibitors such as T-1095 or KGT-1251 (869682), inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 , substances which influence deregulated glucose production in the liver, such as e.g. inhibitors of glucose-6-phosphatase, or fructose-1 ,6-bisphosphatase, glycogen phosphorylase, glucagon receptor antagonists and inhibitors of phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase, glycogen synthase kinase or pyruvate dehydrokinase, lipid lowering agents, such as HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (e.g. simvastatin, atorvastatin), fibrates (e.g. bezafibrate, fenofibrate), nicotinic acid and its derivatives, PPAR-alpha agonists, PPAR-delta agonists, ACAT inhibitors (e.g. avasimibe) or cholesterol<br>
Absorption inhibitors such as for example ezetimibe, bile acid-binding substances such as for example cholestyramine, inhibitors of ileac bile acid transport, HDL-raising compounds such as for example inhibitors of CETP or regulators of ABC1 or LXRalpha antagonists, LXRbeta agonists or LXRalpha/beta regulators or active substances for the treatment of obesity, such as e.g. sibutramine or tetrahydrolipostatin, dexfenfluramine, axokine, antagonists of the cannabinoidl receptor, MCH-1 receptor antagonists, MC4 receptor agonists, NPY5 or NPY2 antagonists or fJ3-agonists such as SB-418790 or AD-9677 as well as agonists of the 5HT2c receptor.<br>
It is also possible to combine the compounds with drugs for treating high blood pressure such as e.g. All antagonists or ACE inhibitors, diuretics, (i-blockers, Ca-antagonists, etc., or combinations thereof.<br>
The dosage required to achieve such an effect is expediently, by intravenous route, 1 to 100 mg, preferably 1 to 30 mg, and by oral route 1 to 1000 mg, preferably 1 to 100 mg, in each case 1 to 4 times a day. For this purpose, the compounds of formula I prepared according to the invention, optionally combined with other active substances, may be incorporated together with one or more inert conventional carriers and/or diluents, e.g. with corn starch, lactose, glucose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, citric acid, tartaric acid, water, water/ethanol, water/glycerol, water/sorbitol, water/polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, cetylstearyl alcohol, carboxymethylcellulose or fatty substances such as hard fat or suitable mixtures thereof into conventional galenic preparations such as plain or coated tablets, capsules, powders, suspensions or suppositories.<br>

dimethylformamide is stirred for 10 minutes at 80°C, then 324 mg 2-chloromethyl-4-<br>
phenylamino-quinazoline are added and the reaction mixture is stirred for two hours<br>
at 80°C. Then another 50 mg caesium carbonate and 50 mg chloromethyl-4-<br>
phenylamino-quinazoline are added and the mixture is stirred for a further 1.5 hours<br>
at 80°C. Then the solvent is distilled off and the residue is distributed between water<br>
and ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with dilute citric acid, water and<br>
saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulphate and evaporated<br>
down. The crude product is purified by chromatography over a silica gel column with<br>
ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (8:2 to 10:0) as eluant.<br>
