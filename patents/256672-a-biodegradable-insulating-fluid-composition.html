				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a biodegradable insulating fluid composition. This invention particularly relates to biodegradable insulating fluid composition that mainly contains non-edible vegetable oil monoesters. In addition to monoesters, the composition also contains an antioxidant, an antifoaming agent, a pour point depressant, a corrosion inhibitor and a detergent-dispersant additive. The product of this invention is significantly biodegradable from renewable source and has utility as an insulating fluid in electrical installations such as transformer.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
Enhancing the life of an electrical transformer is an essential part of a modern power operation technology. The aging or deterioration of insulating oil is normally associated with oxidation. Due to the presence of oxygen and water, insulating oil oxidizes even under ideal conditions. The insulating properties of the oil are also affected by contaminants from the solid materials in the transformer dissolving in the oil. The reaction between unstable hydrocarbons in the oil and oxygen, moisture or other chemicals in the atmosphere, with the assistance of accelerators such as heat, results in decay products in the oil. Mineral oil insulating fluids undergo oxidative degradation in the presence of oxygen to give a number of oxidation products. The final products of oxidation are acidic materials that can affect the characteristics of the insulating fluid as well as damage the components of the electrical unit. The high temperatures in due course cause the fluid to oxidize and ultimately produce sludge and soluble acid in sufficient quantity to impair its heat transfer and dielectric efficiency. Sludge formation is the terminal stage of the deterioration process. The acids formed in the process of oxidation attack on the cellulose fibers and metals forming metallic soaps, lacquers, aldehydes, alcohols and ketones which precipitate as heavy tarry acidic sludge on the insulation. Sludge appears faster in heavily loaded, hot running and abused transformers causing shrinkage of the insulation through leaching out varnishes and cellulose materials.<br>
The main purpose of transformer oil is to insulate and cool the transformer. A specification is a good start, but to successfully find just the right oil for transformer, details are needed. All transformers and their requirements are different. And right oils are needed that are tailored for each transformer's need for availability, performance and its geographical conditions. The Naphthenic oils are the best, which have outstanding properties for use in a transformer. Much due to their low viscosity at high temperatures and excellent solvency at very low temperatures. They also have high oxidation stability and great electrical properties that make them the perfect choice for a transformer.<br>
Now, pollution and environmental aspects of various products have become important issues. The uncontrolled loss of lubricants can endanger environment by coming into contact directly with the nature (organisms, soil, live water etc.) as a consequence of leakage, throw off, emissions, spillage or careless disposal. Great efforts have been made during the last 25 years by several countries and major industries to develop and find more and more environment friendly products and technologies which have a less negative impact on our precious environment.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent 6,726,857 and US Patent 6,485,659 Goedde , et al. April 27, 2004 Cooper Industries, Inc. (Houston, TX) Dielectric fluid having defined chemical composition for use in electrical apparatus. The dielectric coolants for use in sealed, non-vented transformers, and have improved performance characteristics, including decreased degradation of the paper insulating layers, as well as a greater degree of safety and environmental acceptability. This consist of aromatic hydrocarbons (di or tri aryl ethane such as biphenyl ethane or ethyl naphthalene), polyalphaolefins, polyol esters, and natural vegetable oils, along with additives to improve pour point, increase stability and reduce oxidation rate.(blend of mineral oil, polyalphaolefins, polyol esters and natural vegetable oils was used )<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent 6,645,404 Oommen , et al. November 11, 2003 ABB Technology AG (Zurich, CH) High oleic acid oil<br>
compositions and methods of making and electrical insulation fluids and devices comprising the same. High oleic acid triglyceride having the properties of a dielectric strength of at least 35 KV/100 mil gap, a dissipation factor of less than 0.05% at 25 NC., acidity of less than 0.03 mg KOH/g, electrical conductivity of less than 1 pS/m at 25 NC., a flash point of at least 250 NC. and a pour point of at least -15 NC with additives are disclosed as electrical insulation fluids, .(natural vegetable oils, sunflower oil, was used )<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent 6,340,658 Cannon , et al. January 22, 2002 Wavely Light and Power (Waverly, IA) Vegetable-based transformer oil and transmission line fluid. A vegetable oil-based electrically-insulating fluid is environmentally-friendly and has a high flash point and a high fire point. The base oil is hydrogenated to produce maximum possible stability of the oil, or alternatively, is a higher oleic acid oil. The vegetable oils of the preferred embodiments are soybean or corn oils. The oil can be winterized to remove crystallized fats and improve the pour point of the base oil, without the necessity of heating the oil. The base oil can also be combined with an additive package containing materials specifically designed for improved pour point, improved cooling properties, and improved dielectric stability. The fluid is useful in electrical components such as transformers and transmission lines. It also provides methods for making the fluid and fluid-filled electrical components, (natural vegetable, soybean or corn oils were used )<br>
In 'the prior art for producing Insulating fluids, generally, mineral oils or mineral oil with synthetic fluids or complex ester of fatty acids were used. The focus has been on the use of such oil base to enhance the performance.<br>
In view .of the growing concern about the environment, there is a need for developing new significantly biodegradable insulating fluid composition from renewable source such as vegetable oil mono-esters. These objectives must be met, while simultaneously satisfying stringent performance standards of insulating fluids.<br>
Vegetable oil that is long chain fatty acid tri-ester of glycerol possesses most of the desirable lubricant properties such as high viscosity index, high flash<br>
point, low volatility and good boundary lubrication. As per fatty acid typical composition of vegetable oils, it contains unsaturated acids such as oleic C18:1 as a major component. It is understood that some of the carbon chain lengths of the carboxylic acids and/or esters disclosed herein are average numbers. This reflects the fact that some of the carboxylic acids and/or esters are derived from naturally occurring materials and therefore contain a mixture of compounds the major component of which is the stated compound. Non-edible vegetable oil, which are found in abundance in India are (1) Neem - Mellia Azadirachta in the family Meliaceae, (2) Karanja - Pongamia glabra in the family Leguminaceae, (3) Ricebran - Oryza sativa in the family Graminaceae, (4) Mahua- Madhuca Indica &amp; Madhuca Longifolia, (5) Castor - Ricinus communis in the family Euphorbiaceae (spurge), (6) Linseed - Flax oil plant Linium usitatissimum ( Linacae), (7) Other similar vegetable oil or their mixture. Vegetable oils are completely biodegradable. Thermo-oxidative, cold behavior and flow properties of vegetable oil can be enhanced by converting it into epoxy, aryl or simple mono ester of its fatty acid and a suitable higher alcohol. The vegetable oil or its mono ester can be used as an alternate to mineral base stock of lubricants. It will reduce the hazard potential of the lubricants. It will provide required properties such as good insulating, dissipation of heat, stability, anti-corrosion properties and more eco-friendliness.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
