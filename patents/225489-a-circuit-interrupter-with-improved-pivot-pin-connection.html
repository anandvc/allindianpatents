BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to circuit interrupters generally and, more<br>
specifically, to those kinds of circuit interrupters having a cradle that rotates in<br>
the event of a tripping operation.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Molded case circuit breakers and interrupters are well known in the art as<br>
exemplified by U.S. Patent No. 4,503,408 issued March 5,1985, to Mrenna et al.,<br>
and U.S. Patent 5,910,760 issued June 8, 1999 to Malingowski, et al., each of<br>
which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
Circuit interrupters typically include an operating mechanism structure,<br>
sometimes termed a "cradle", that is disposed in the interrupter housing and<br>
which rotates from a first position to a second position in the event of a tripping<br>
operation. A pivot pin is rotatably disposed in the housing and through the cradle<br>
in order to provide for such cradle rotation.<br>
In the prior art, it is known to weld the cradle pivot pin to the cradle. It is<br>
also known to spin (like a screw) or stake (forcibly press) the pivot pin to the<br>
cradle. Unfortunately, these prior art methods do not enable the pivot pin to be<br>
heat treated for strength. This is because such a treatment, allied before the<br>
pivot pin is connected to the cradle, would make the pin too susceptible to<br>
damage during a welding, spinning, or stacking process, each of which requires a<br>
large amount of force and / or stress to be applied to the pin. In addition, the<br>
prior art methods do not enable the cradle to rotate if the pivot pin somehow<br>
binds and cannot rotate. Furthermore, the prior art methods do not enable the<br>
pivot pin and cradle to be conveniently disassembled after connection.<br>
It would be advantageous if a way existed to effectively connect a pivot<br>
pin to a cradle that would still enable the pivot pin to be heat treated. It would<br>
also be<br>
advantageous if such a way enabled the cradle to rotate even if the pivot pin did<br>
not, and enabled the pivot pin to be disassembled from the cradle in a convenient<br>
fashion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a circuit interrupter that meets all of the<br>
above-identified needs.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a circuit interrupter is provided<br>
which includes a housing, separable main contacts disposed in the housing, and<br>
an operating mechanism disposed in the housing and interconnected with the<br>
separable main contacts. The operating mechanism includes a cradle for rotating<br>
from a first position to a second position in the event of a tripping operation. The<br>
cradle has an aperture with a smaller cutout portion and a larger cutout portion.<br>
The operating mechanism further includes a pivot pin disposed within the<br>
housing. The pivot pin is insertable through the larger cutout portion and is<br>
seated in the smaller cutout portion for providing for rotation of the cradle.<br>
This and other objects and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from a reading of the following description of the preferred<br>
embodiment taken in connection with the attached drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to the drawings and Figures 1 and 2 in particular, shown<br>
is a molded case circuit breaker 10. Circuit breaker 10 includes a base 12<br>
mechanically interconnected with a cover 14 to form a circuit breaker housing<br>
15. Holes or openings 16 (Figure 2) are provided in cover 14 for accepting<br>
screws or other attaching devices 128 that enter corresponding notes or<br>
openings 18 in base 12 for fastening cover 14 to base 12. Holes 20, which<br>
feed through cover 14, are provided for internal access to circuit breaker 10,<br>
as described in greater detail below. At the interface between base 12 and<br>
cover 14 are small openings 21 for venting purposes, as described in greater<br>
detail below. Cover 14 includes a handle opening 22 through which protrudes<br>
a handle 24 (Figure 1) that is used in a conventional manner to manually open<br>
and close the contacts of circuit breaker 10 and to reset circuit breaker 10<br>
when it is in a tripped state. Handle 24 may also provide an indication of the<br>
status of circuit breaker 10 whereby the position of handle 24 corresponds<br>
with a legend (not shown) on cover 14 near handle opening 22 which clearly<br>
indicates whether circuit breaker 10 is ON (contacts closed), OFF (contacts<br>
open), or TRIPPED (contacts open due to, for example, an overcurrent<br>
condition). Cover 14 also includes a rectangular opening 23 (Figure 2)<br>
through which protrudes a top portion 25A of a button for a push-to-trip<br>
actuator, the details of which are described below. Also shown is a load<br>
conductor opening 26 in base 12 that shields and protects a load terminal (not<br>
shown). Although circuit breaker 10 is depicted as a single-phase circuit<br>
breaker, the present invention is not limited to single-phase operation.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, a longitudinal section of a side elevation,<br>
partially broken away and partially in phantom, of circuit breaker 10 is shown<br>
having a load terminal 28 and a line terminal 29. There is shown a plasma arc<br>
acceleration chamber 30 comprising a slot motor assembly 32 and an arc<br>
extinguisher assembly 34. Also shown is a contact assembly 36, an operating<br>
mechanism 38, and a trip mechanism 40.<br>
Referring again to Figure 3, and now also to Figure 4 which shows a<br>
side eievational view of the internal workings of circuit breaker 10 without base<br>
12 and cover 14, slot motor assembly 32 is shown as including a separate<br>
upper slot motor assembly 32A and a separate lower slot motor assembly<br>
32B. Upper slot motor assembly 32A includes an upper slot motor assembly<br>
housing 41 within which are stacked side-by-side U-shaped upper slot motor<br>
assembly plates 42. Similarly, lower slot motor assembly 32B includes a lower<br>
slot motor assembly housing 43 within which are stacked side-by-side lower<br>
slot motor assembly plates 44. Plates 42 and 44 are both composed of<br>
magnetic material.<br>
Arc extinguisher assembly 34 includes an arc chute 46 within which are<br>
positioned spaced-apart generally parallel angularly offset arc chute plates 48<br>
and an upper arc runner 48A. As known to one of ordinary skill in the art, the<br>
function of arc extinguisher assembly 34 is to receive and dissipate electrical<br>
arcs that are created upon separation of the contacts of the circuit breaker.<br>
Referring now to Figure 5, shown is an orthogonal view of an internal<br>
portion of circuit breaker 10 There is shown contact assembly 36 comprising<br>
a movable contact arm 50 supporting thereon a movable contact 52, and a<br>
stationary contact arm 54 supporting thereon a stationary contact 56.<br>
Stationary contact arm 54 is electrically connected to line terminal 29 and, as<br>
discussed below, movable contact arm 50 is electrically connected to load<br>
terminal 28. Also shown is a crossbar assembly 60 which traverses the width<br>
of circuit breaker 10 and is rotatabiy disposed on an internal portion of base 12<br>
(not shown). Actuation of operating mechanism 38, in a manner described in<br>
detail below, causes crossbar assembly 60 and movable contact arm 50 to<br>
rotate into or out of a disposition which places movable contact 52 into or out<br>
of a disposition of electrical continuity with fixed contact 56. Crossbar<br>
assembly 60 includes a movable contact cam housing 62 in which is disposed<br>
a pivot pin 64 upon which movable contact arm 50 is rotatably disposed.<br>
Under normal circumstances, movable contact arm 50 rotates in unison with<br>
the rotation of housing 62 as housing 62 is rotated clockwise or counter-<br>
clockwise by action of operating mechanism 38. However, it is to be noted<br>
that movable contact arm 50 is free to rotate (within limits) independently of<br>
the rotation of crossbar assembly 60. In particular, in certain dynamic, electro-<br>
magnetic situations, movable contact arm 50 can rotate upwardly about pivot<br>
pin 64 under the influence of high magnetic forces. This is referred to as<br>
"blow-open" operation, and is described in greater detail below.<br>
Continuing to refer to Figure 5 and again to Figure 3, operating<br>
mechanism 38 is shown. Operating mechanism 38 is structurally and<br>
functionally similar to that shown and described in United States Patent No.<br>
4,503,408 issued March 5, 1985 to Mrenna et al, and United States Patent<br>
5,910,760 issued June 8,1999, both disclosures of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference. Operating mechanism 38 comprises a handle arm or<br>
handle assembly 70 (connected to handle 24), a configured plate or cradle 72,<br>
an upper toggle link 74, an interlinked lower toggle link 76, and an upper<br>
toggle (ink pivot pin 78 which interlinks upper toggle link 74 with cradle 72.<br>
Lower toggle link 76 is pivotally interconnected with upper toggle link 74 by<br>
way of an intermediate toggle link pivot pin 80, and with crossbar assembly 60<br>
at pivot pin 64. Provided is a cradle pivot pin 82 which is laterally and<br>
rotatably disposed between parallel, spaced apart operating mechanism<br>
support members or sideplates 84. Cradle 72 is free to rotate (within limits)<br>
via cradle pivot pin 82. Also provided is a handle assembly roller 66 which is<br>
disposed in and supported by handle assembly 70 in such a manner as to<br>
make mechanical contact with (roll against) arcuate portions of a back region<br>
87 of cradle 72 during a "resetting" operation of circuit breaker 10 as is<br>
described below. A main stop bar 88 is laterally disposed between sideptates<br>
84, and provides a limit to the counter-clockwise movement of cradle 72.<br>
Referring now to Figure 6, an elevation of that part of circuit breaker 10<br>
particular associated with operating mechanism 38 is shown for the OFF<br>
disposition of circuit breaker 10. Contacts 52 and 56 are shown in the<br>
disconnected or open disposition. An intermediate latch 90 is shown in its<br>
latched position wherein it abuts hard against a lower portion 92 of a latch<br>
cutout region 94 of cradle 72. A pair of side-by-side aligned compression<br>
springs (not shown) such as shown in United States Patent No. 4,503,408 is<br>
disposed between the top portion of handie assembly 70 and the intermediate<br>
toggle link pivot pin 80. The tension in these springs has a tendency to load<br>
lower portion 92 of cradle 72 against the intermediate latch 90. in the OPEN<br>
disposition shown in Figure 6, latch 90 is prevented from unlatching cradle 72,<br>
notwithstanding the spring tension, because the other end thereof is fixed in<br>
place by a rotatable trip bar assembly 190 of trip mechanism 40. As is<br>
described in more detail below, trip bar assembly 190 is spring-biased in the<br>
counter-clockwise rotational direction against the intermediate latch 90. This<br>
is the standard latch arrangement found in alI dispositions of circuit breaker 10<br>
except the TRIPPED disposition which is described below.<br>
Referring now to Figure 7, operating mechanism 38 is shown for the<br>
ON disposition of circuit breaker 10. In this disposition, contacts 52 and 56<br>
are closed (in contact with each other) whereby electrical current may flow<br>
from load terminal 28 to line terminal 29. In order to achieve the ON<br>
disposition, handle 24, and thus fixedly attached handle assembly 70, are<br>
rotated in a counter-clockwise direction (to the left) thus causing the<br>
intermediate toggle link pivot pin 80 to be influenced by the tension springs<br>
(not shown) attached thereto and to the top of handle assembly 70. The<br>
influence of the tension springs causes upper toggle link 74 and lower toggle<br>
link 76 to assume the position shown in Figure 7 which causes the pivotal<br>
interconnection with crossbar assembly 60 at pivot point 64 to rotate crossbar<br>
assembly 60 in the counter-clockwise direction. This rotation of crossbar<br>
assembly 60 causes movable contact arm 50 to rotate in the counter-<br>
clockwise direction and ultimately force movable contact 52 into a pressurized<br>
abutted disposition with stationary contact 56. It is to be noted that cradle 72<br>
remains latched by intermediate latch 90 as influenced by trip mechanism 40.<br>
Referring now to Figure 8, operating mechanism 38 is shown for the<br>
TRIPPED disposition of circuit breaker 10. The TRIPPED disposition is related<br>
(except when a manual tripping operation is performed, as described below) to<br>
an automatic opening of circuit breaker 10 caused by the thermally or<br>
magnetically induced reaction of trip mechanism 40 to the magnitude of the<br>
current flowing between load conductor 28 and line conductor 29. The<br>
operation of trip mechanism 40 is described in detail below. For purposes<br>
here, circumstances such as a load current with a magnitude exceeding a<br>
predetermined threshold will cause trip mechanism 40 to rotate trip bar<br>
assembly 190 clockwise (overcoming the spring force biasing assembly 190 in<br>
the opposite direction) and away from intermediate latch 90. This unlocking of<br>
latch 90 releases cradle 72 (which had been held in place at lower portion 92<br>
of latch cutout region 94) and enables it to be rotated counter-clockwise under<br>
the influence of the tension springs (not shown) interacting between the top of<br>
handle assembly 70 and the intermediate toggle link pivot pin 80. The<br>
resulting collapse of the toggle arrangement causes pivot pin 84 to be rotated<br>
clockwise and upwardly to thus cause crossbar assembly 60 to similarly<br>
rotate. This rotation of crossbar assembly 60 causes a clockwise motion of<br>
movable contact arm 50, resulting in a separation of contacts 52 and 56. The<br>
above sequence of events results in handle 24 being placed into an<br>
intermediate disposition between its OFF disposition (as shown in Figure 6)<br>
and its ON disposition (as shown in Figure 7). Once in this TRIPPED<br>
disposition, circuit breaker 10 cart not again achieve the ON disposition<br>
(contacts 52 and 56 closed) until it is first "reset" via a resetting operation<br>
which is described in detail below.<br>
Referring now to Figure 9, operating mechanism 38 is shown during the<br>
resetting operation of circuit breaker 10. This occurs while contacts 52 and 56<br>
remain open, and is exemplified by a forceful movement of handle 24 to the<br>
right (or in a clockwise direction) after a tripping operation has occurred as<br>
described above with respect to Figure 8. As handle 24 is thus moved, handle<br>
assembly 70 moves correspondingly, causing handle assembly roller 86 to<br>
make contact with back region 87 of cradle 72. This contact forces cradle 72<br>
to rotate clockwise about cradle pivot pin 82 and against the tension of the<br>
springs (not shown) that are located between the top of handle assembly 70<br>
and the intermediate toggle link pivot pin 80, until an upper portion 93 of latch<br>
cutout region 94 abuts against the upper arm or end of intermediate latch 90.<br>
This abutment forces intermediate latch 90 to rotate to the (eft (or in a counter-<br>
clockwise direction) so that the bottom portion thereof rotates to a disposition<br>
of interlatching with trip bar assembly 190, in a manner described in more<br>
detail below. Then, when the force against handle 24 is released, handle 24<br>
rotates to the left over a small angular increment, causing lower portion 92 of<br>
latch cutout region 94 to forcefully abut against intermediate latch 90 which is<br>
now abutted at its lower end against trip bar assembly 190. Circuit breaker 10<br>
is then in the OFF disposition shown in Figure 6, and handle 24 may then be<br>
moved counter-clockwise (to the left) towards the ON disposition depicted in<br>
Figure 7 (without the latching arrangement being disturbed) until contacts 52<br>
and 56 are in a disposition of forceful electrical contact with each other.<br>
However, if an overcurrent condition still exists, a tripping operation such as<br>
depicted and described above with respect to Figure 8 may again take place<br>
causing contacts 52 and 56 to again open.<br>
Referring again to Figures 3, 4, and 5, upper slot motor assembly 32A<br>
and lower slot motor assembly 32B are structurally and functionally similar to<br>
that described in United States Patent 5,910,760 and plates 42 and 44 thereof<br>
form an essentially closed electro-magnetic path in the viscinity of contacts 52<br>
and 56. At the beginning of a contact opening operation, etectrical current<br>
continues to flow in movable contact arm 50 and through an electrical are<br>
created between contacts 52 and 56. This current induces a magnetic field<br>
into the closed magnetic loop provided by upper plates 42 and lower plates 44<br>
of upper slot motor assembly 32A and lower slot motor assembly 32B,<br>
respectively. This magnetic field electromagnetically interacts with the current<br>
in such a manner as to accelerate the movement of movable contact arm 50 in<br>
the opening direction whereby contacts 52 and 56 are more rapidly separated.<br>
The higher the magnitude of the etectrical current flowing in the are, the<br>
stronger the magnetic interaction and the more quickly contacts 52 and 56<br>
separate. For very high current (an overcurrent condition), the above process<br>
provides the blow-open operation described above in which movable contact<br>
arm 50 forcefully rotates upwardly about pivot pin 64 and separates contacts<br>
52 and 56, this rotation being independent of crossbar assembly 60. This<br>
blow-open operation is shown and described in United States Patent No.<br>
3,815,059 issued June 4, 1974, to Spoeiman and incorporated herein by<br>
reference, and provides a faster separation of contacts 52 and 56 than can<br>
normally occur as the result of a tripping operation generated by trip<br>
mechanism 40 as described above in connection with Figure 8.<br>
In connection with the above described blow-open operation, crossbar<br>
assembly 60 and, in particular, cam housing 62 are structurally and<br>
functionally similar to that described in United States 5,910,760. In particular,<br>
cam housing 62 includes a spring-loaded cam follower (not shown) which,<br>
when a blow-open opeation has occurred, latches movable contact arm 50 in<br>
its blown-open disposition.<br>
Referring now to Figures 10A, 10B, 10C, 10D, 10E, and 10F, shown is<br>
integrally molded trip bar assembly 190 of trip mechanism 40. Assembly 190<br>
includes a trip shaft 192 to which is connected a thermal trip bar or paddle<br>
194, a magnetic trip bar or paddle 196, and a manual trip bar 198, the function<br>
of each of which is described in detail below. Assembly 190 also includes an<br>
intermediate latch interface 200 having a protrusion or stepped up region 201<br>
and a cutout region or stepped-down region 203 with a surface 203A. Near<br>
one end of trip shaft 192 is a channel or groove 199 that partially extends<br>
around the circumference thereof. As shown in Figure 10C, groove 199 has<br>
an end 199A on the underside of trip shaft 192 that defines a cavity extending<br>
into shaft 192. Assembly 190 also includes a torsion spring 202, as shown in<br>
Figure 10D, having an elbow 202A defining an end 202B. and an end 202C.<br>
As shown in Figures 10E and 10F spring 202 is wound around the end of trip<br>
shaft 192, and is partially seated within groove 199. Elbow 202A of spring 202<br>
is shown positioned at end 199A of groove 199, with end 202B of spring 202<br>
inserted into the cavity. Groove 199 serves to property position spring 202<br>
and prevent distodgment thereof from shaft 192. In a preferred embodiment<br>
wherein spring 202 is approximately .018 inches in diameter, groove 199 is<br>
approximately .030 inches in width and approximately .015 inches deep.<br>
Referring now to Figure 11, shown is intermediate latch 90. Latch 90<br>
includes a main member 206 having ends 207 which are bent towards each<br>
other and in which are formed notes or openings 208. Extending from main<br>
member 206 is an upper latch portion 210 and a lower latch portion 212, the<br>
latch portions being linearly offset from each other in the exemplary<br>
embodiment. Lower latch portion 212 includes a protruding region 213 with a<br>
bottom surface 213A, and a cutout region 214.<br>
Referring now also to Figures 12, 13, and 14, shown is trip bar<br>
assembly 190 in conjunction with a portion of the internal workings of circuit<br>
breaker 10. Trip shaft 192 is shown laterally disposed between parallel<br>
sideplates 84 of the sideplate assembly, with its ends positioned within holes<br>
or openings 216. This disposition provides a pivot area about which trip bar<br>
assembly 190 can rotate. This rotation is influenced by spring 202 that<br>
rotationatly biases assembly 190 in the counter-clockwise direction. Also<br>
shown is intermediate latch 90 which, tike trip shaft 192, is laterally disposed<br>
between sideplates 84. Holes or openings 208 of latch 90 are mated with<br>
corresponding circular protrusions or indents 218 in sidepletes 84, providing a<br>
pivot area for rotation of latch 90. Protrusions or indents 220 in sideplates 84<br>
provide a stop for limiting the rotation of latch 90 in the clockwise direction<br>
which occurs during a tripping operation as described below.<br>
Figure 12 shows the latching arrangement found in ail dispositions of<br>
circuit breaker 10 except the TRIPPED disposition. Lower latch portion 212 of<br>
latch 90 is shown fixed in place by intermediate latch interface 200 of trip bar<br>
assembly 190. In particular, as also seen in Figure 14, cutout region 214 of<br>
latch 90 is shown mated with protrusion 201 of interface 200, with bottom<br>
surface 213A of protruding region 213 of latch 90 in an abutted, engaged<br>
relationship with surface 203A of interface 200. Upper latch portion 210 of<br>
latch 90 is shown abutted hard against lower portion 92 of latch cutout region<br>
94 of cradle 72. Because latch 90 is prevented from clockwise rotation due to<br>
the engagement of lower latch portion 212 with intermediate latch interface<br>
200, the abutment of upper latch portion 210 with cradle 72 prevents the<br>
counter-clockwise rotation of cradle 72, notwithstanding the spring tension<br>
(described above) experienced by the cradle in that direction. However,<br>
during a tripping operation as described below, trip bar assembly 190 is<br>
rotated clockwise (overcoming the spring tension provided by spring 202),<br>
causing surface 203A of intermediate latch interface 200 to rotate away from<br>
its abutted, engaged relationship with protruding region 213 of intermediate<br>
latch 90. This disengagement enables the spring forces experienced by<br>
cradle 72 to rotate latch 90 in a clockwise direction, thereby terminating the<br>
hard abutment between upper latch portion 210 and cradle 72, and releasing<br>
the cradle to be rotated counter-clockwise by the aforementioned springs until<br>
operating mechanism 38 is in the TRIPPED disposition described above in<br>
connection with Figure 8.<br>
In the preferred exemplary embodiment, protrusion 201 of interface 200<br>
has a height 201A (Figure 10B) that exceeds height 214A (Figure 11) of cutout<br>
regions 214. In one embodiment, height 201A is approximately twice that of<br>
height 214A. This preferred configuration prevents improper engagement of<br>
latch portion 212 with interface 200 due to any over-rotation of latch 90 in the<br>
counter-clockwise direction during the resetting operation described above<br>
with respect to Figure 9. In particular, it prevents the bottom surface of latch<br>
portion 212 near cutout region 214 from improperly contacting and abutting top<br>
surface 201B (Figure 10B) of protrusion 201 which would keep bottom surface<br>
213A (Figure 11) of protruding region 213 floating (disengaged) and<br>
undesirably alter the latch load relationship of trip mechanism 40.<br>
As shown in Figure 14, spring 202 is positioned in channel 199 of trip<br>
shaft 192 with end 202C of spring 202 rotated counter-clockwise (shown with<br>
dashed lines) from its vertical position (shown with solid lines) and positioned<br>
under and in pressurized contact with intermediate latch 90. In particular, end<br>
202C is positioned under and in pressurized contact with an undersurface<br>
209A of an elbow area 209 (Figure 11) of latch 90. Positioned as such, end<br>
202C of spring 202 applies a bias force to latch 90 in the counter-clockwise<br>
rotational direction, for reasons discussed below. The configuration, size, and<br>
positioning of spring 202 is chosen so that the bias force provided by end<br>
202C is, at all times, smaller in magnitude than the spring forces experienced<br>
by cradle 72, thereby always enabling the cradle spring forces to rotate latch<br>
90 in a clockwise direction (as described above) when latch 90 and latch<br>
interface 200 are disengaged due to a tripping operation. When latch 90 has<br>
been rotated clockwise due to a tripping operation as such, the cradle spring<br>
forces are no longer felt by latch 90 after cradle 72 has rotated counter-<br>
clockwise and lower portion 92 of latch cutout region 94 no longer contacts<br>
latch 90. The bias force provided by end 202C of spring 202 then takes over<br>
and rotates latch 90 in the counter-clockwise direction. The configuration,<br>
size, and positioning of spring 202 is chosen so that the bias force rotates<br>
latch 90 in the counter-clockwise direction only to a point where upper latch<br>
portion 210 is properly positioned to make contact with upper portion 93 of<br>
latch cutout region 94 during the resetting operation described above with<br>
respect to Figure 9. The counter-clockwise rotation of latch 90 due to end<br>
202C of spring 202 advantageously prevents upper latch portion 210 from<br>
being left in a clockwise over-rotated position (due to the cradle spring forces)<br>
where latch portion 210 is in too vertical of a position such that, during the<br>
resetting operation, it could undesirably contact upper portion 93 of latch<br>
cutout region 94 at an angle that would prevent or make it difficult for latch 90<br>
to be rotated counter-clockwise (this rotation being necessary for lower latch<br>
portion 212 to become latched with latch interface 200, as described above).<br>
As described above, protrusions or stops 220 are provided in sideplates<br>
84 in order to limit the clockwise rotation of latch 90. Although these<br>
protrusions ideally prevent clockwise over-rotation of latch 90 into too vertical<br>
of a position, variability in parts may limit their ability to accomplish this goal.<br>
By supplying a constant bias force on latch 90 in the counter-clockwise<br>
direction, end 202C of spring 202 cooperates with stops 220 to ensure that the<br>
desired over-rotation protection exists.<br>
There are several types of tripping operations that can cause trip bar<br>
assembly 190 to rotate in the clockwise direction and thereby release cradle<br>
72. One type is a manual tripping operation, and the structure associated<br>
therewith is shown in Figure 15. Figure 15 shows a portion of the internal<br>
workings of circuit breaker 10 within base 12, with base 12 having been cut<br>
away at 226A and 226B to provide a better view thereof. Shown is trip bar<br>
assembly 190 and manual trip bar 198 thereof. Along the outer sidewall of<br>
base 12 is a push-to-trip actuator 230 of trip mechanism 40 that is positioned<br>
such that it can be moved upwardly or downwardly. Actuator 230 includes a<br>
button 25 with a top portion 25A that protrudes through rectangular opening 23<br>
of cover 14 (Figure 1).<br>
Referring now also to Figures 16A and 16B. push-to-trip actuator 230 is<br>
comprised of a main bar-like member 231 that slightly tapers near its bottom<br>
232 where it slideably fits into a groove formed between housing structures<br>
228 and 229 and the outer sidewall of base 12 (Figure 15). This groove<br>
provides a guide for the vertical motion of push-to-trip actuator 230. Actuator<br>
230 includes a stop member 235 that is positioned to abut housing structure<br>
229 in order to limit the downward movement of actuator 230 within this<br>
groove. For reasons discussed below, a spring (not shown) is seated<br>
between bottom 232 of actuator 230 and the bottom of base 12. Near Its top,<br>
actuator 230 includes shoulders 233 from which upwardly protrudes a curved<br>
flange 234. Button 25 sits upon shoulders 233 and, as shown in Figure 17,<br>
includes an appropriately configured opening 236 into which curved flange 234<br>
is inserted. Button 25 also includes a shoulder 237 which abuts upwardly<br>
against a bottom surface of cover 14 so as to limit the upward vertical<br>
movement of push-to-trip actuator 230, and a cut-out section 238 for providing<br>
clearance for handle 24 and its associated handle slider, as described in<br>
greater detail below. Protruding outwardly from approximately the middle of<br>
main member 231 of push-to-trip actuator 230 is a downwardly curved arm<br>
240 with a bottom portion 242. As shown in Figure 15, bottom portion 242 of<br>
arm 240 is positioned just above manual trip bar 198 of trip bar assembly 190.<br>
When top portion 25A of button 25 is depressed, the resulting<br>
downward movement of push-to-trip actuator 230 causes bottom portion 242<br>
of arm 240 to contact manual trip bar or member 198, thereby causing trip bar<br>
assembly 190 to rotate in the clockwise direction. As described above, this<br>
rotation of assembly 190 releases cradle 72 and results in the TRIPPED<br>
disposition shown in Figure 8. The spring (not shown) positioned below<br>
bottom 232 of push-to-trip actuator 230 causes the actuator to return to its<br>
initial position when force upon top portion 25A of button 25 is no longer<br>
exerted.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, push-to-trip actuator 230 (except button 25)<br>
is comprised of a metal such as carbon steel, and is integrally formed via a<br>
stamping process. As such, the strength of the main portion of actuator 230 is<br>
enhanced, enabling it to have thinner dimensions which are highly desirable in<br>
view of the space constraints of modern circuit breakers such as circuit<br>
breaker 10. In the exemplary embodiment, the carbon steel of actuator 230 is<br>
.045 inches thick. Button 25 is preferably comprised of a suitable polymer<br>
(plastic) with electrical insulating properties.<br>
In addition to the manual tripping operation described above, circuit<br>
breaker 10 includes automatic thermal and magnetic tripping operations which<br>
likewise can cause trip bar assembly 190 to rotate in the clockwise direction<br>
and thereby release cradle 72. The structure for providing these additional<br>
tripping operations can be seen in Figure 7 which shows circuit breaker 10 in<br>
its ON (non-TRIPPEO) disposition, with latch 90 abutted hard against (ower<br>
portion 92 of latch cutout region 94 of cradle 72, and latch 90 held in place by<br>
intermediate latch interface 200 (Figure 10B) of trip bar assembly 190. Also<br>
shown is an automatic trip assembly 250 of trip mechanism 40 that is<br>
positioned in close proximity to trip bar assembly 190.<br>
Referring now also to Figures 18A, 18B, 18C, 19A, 19B, 20, 21, 22A,<br>
and 22B, shown in isolation is automatic trip assembly 250 and its various<br>
components. Assembly 250 includes a magnetic yoke 252, a bimetal 254, a<br>
magnetic clapper or armature 256, and toad terminal 28. Magnetic yoke 252<br>
(Figures 19A and 19B) includes a substantially planar portion 258 with a<br>
bottom portion 258A. Protruding from portion 258 are curved arms or wings<br>
260 and 262 having front faces 260A and 262A. At the tops of arms 260 and<br>
262 are pivot supports 264 and 266, with respective pivot surfaces 268 and<br>
270 on which pivot magnetic clapper 256, as described below. Pivot support<br>
264 includes a front retaining ridge or raised surface 263 that helps define<br>
pivot surface 268, and pivot support 266 includes a downwardly facing stop or<br>
protrusion 265. Pivot supports 264 and 266 each include a rear retaining<br>
protrusion 267 which helps define pivot surfaces 268 and 270. Yoke 252 also<br>
includes a shoulder portion 272 above which is positioned a portion of load<br>
terminal 28, as described below. In addition, holes or openings 274 are<br>
formed through substantially planar portion 258 for purposes described below.<br>
Yoke 252 of the exemplary embodiment is made of carbon steel material of<br>
approximately .078 inch thickness.<br>
Bimetal 254 (Figure 20) is planar and substantially rectangular in form<br>
and includes two cutout regions 280 and 282 forming a neck 284 upon which<br>
sits a head portion 286. Through a bottom portion 287 of bimetal 254 is a note<br>
or opening 288 for purposes described below. Bimetal 254 is structured as is<br>
known to one of skill in the art such that bottom portion 287 deflects (bends) in<br>
a conventional manner above certain temperatures.<br>
Magnetic clapper 256 (Figure 21) is planar in form and includes cutout<br>
regions 312 and 314 which form shoulders 313 and 315, a neck portion 311,<br>
and a head portion 316. Head portion 316 includes horizontal pivot portions or<br>
arms 318, and the outside comer of shoulder 315 includes a chamfered region<br>
or cutout 317. The body of dapper 256 is wider than the body of magnetic<br>
yoke 252, with distance d2 greater than distance d1 (Figure 19B). Clapper<br>
256 includes holes or openings 320 formed within a bottom portion 319 for<br>
purposes described below, and is formed of carbon steel material in the<br>
exemplary embodiment.<br>
Load terminal 23 (Figures 22A and 22B) includes a substantially planar<br>
portion 290 from which protrudes, in approximately perpendicular fashion, a<br>
bottom connector portion 292 that connects with an external input of electrical<br>
current by means of a connecting device such as a self-retaining collar. Such<br>
a collar provides both a physical and electrical connection, and an example<br>
collar 295 is shown in Figure 4 (connected to connector portion 292 as well as<br>
to a similar portion of line terminal 29) and is described in greater detail below<br>
in connection with Figure 29. For purposes described below with respect to<br>
Figure 29, connector portion 292 has a hole or opening 294, raised portions or<br>
surfaces 297 on the top thereof, and cut-outs 299 that cause front face 301 to<br>
have a smaller width than the rest of connector 292. Located at the other end<br>
of terminal 28 is a top substantially planar region 296 which is offset from<br>
portion 290 via a curved region 298. Formed through portion 290 are holes or<br>
openings 300, 302, and 304. A tab or protrusion 306 protrudes from one side<br>
of portion 290 near hole 304. Planar portion 290 includes offsets or ribbed<br>
portions 308 formed along the sides thereof. As best seen in Figure 22A,<br>
planar portion 290 slightly tapers along its length in a gradual manner, with<br>
width w2 wider than width w1.<br>
Referring briefly now also to Figures 23-27, shown in Figure 23 is a<br>
portion of base 12 into which toad terminal 28 mounts when assembled into<br>
circuit breaker 10. Base 12 includes channels 520 Formed in both sides<br>
thereof, each with a bottom 522. As shown in Figure 24. the sides of planar<br>
portion 290 of load terminal 23, and in particular ribbed portions 308, insert<br>
into channels 520 until bottom shoulders 291 (see Figure 22B) of terminal 28<br>
abut the bottoms 522 of channels 520. Inserted as such, with an interference<br>
fit provided by ribs 308, lateral movement of terminal 28 relative to base 12 is<br>
prevented. The sides of base 12, and therefore channels 520 formed therein,<br>
are slightly tapered from top to bottom, as best shown in Figure 25, with<br>
distance d2 greater than distance d1. This tapering aids in the molded<br>
production of base 12. The tapering of planar portion 290 of terminal 28<br>
follows this tapering of base 12 so as to provide a snug fit therewith upon<br>
insertion. Ribbed portions 308 enhance the frictional engagement between<br>
terminal 28 and channels 520, thereby also resisting vertical movement of<br>
terminal 28 relative to base 12. in order to further prevent vertical movement<br>
of terminal 28 relative to base 12, cover 14 includes an abutment portion or<br>
wall 525, as shown in Figures 26 and 27, having a bottom that is appropriately<br>
positioned and dimensioned to abut protrusion 306 of terminal 28 when cover<br>
14 is in a position of securement with base 12. This abutment holds<br>
protrusion 306 down, thus keeping terminal 26 fully seated in channels 520. In<br>
the exemplary embodiment, the bottom of abutment wall 525 includes a<br>
contact member or crush rib 526 that is positioned to directly contact<br>
protrusion 306 when cover 14 is secured to base 12. Rib 526 is formed of<br>
compressible material, thereby providing a little "give" to the abutment of walI<br>
525 with protrusion 306 and ensuring proper fit notwithstanding slight<br>
variability in the circuit breaker components in issue. In one embodiment,<br>
crush rib 526 is formed of a thermoset glass polyester material like the rest of<br>
cover 14 but with a reduced amount of fiberglass in order to provide enhanced<br>
compressibility.<br>
Figures 18A and 18B show automatic trip assembly 250 in assembled<br>
form. Neck 284 of bimetal 254 is positioned between arms 260 and 262 of<br>
yoke 252 whereby bimetal 254 is substantially parallel (but not in contact) with<br>
portion 258 of yoke 252. A screw 255 is shown partially screwed into one side<br>
of opening 288 in bottom portion 287 of bimetal 254, for reasons discussed<br>
below. Head portion 286 of bimetal 254 is connected to top region 296 of load<br>
terminal 28 by way of a conventional heat welding or brazing process. Curved<br>
region 298 of load terminal 28 is positioned above shoulder 272 of yoke 252,<br>
with planar portion 290 of terminal 28 parallel and in contact with planar<br>
portion 258 of yoke 252. Securing terminal 28 to yoke 252 are securing<br>
devices such as rivets 330 which are inserted into holes 274 of yoke 252 and<br>
corresponding holes 300 of terminal 28. Secured in this manner, terminal 28<br>
advantageously has only one heat-affected zone which is in the area of top<br>
region 296. Positioned in contact with (seated in) pivot surfaces 268 and 270<br>
of yoke 252 are pivot arms 318 of magnetic armature 256 for providing a<br>
limited range of motion of clapper 256, as discussed in more detail below. As<br>
seen in Figure 18C, chamfered region or cutout 317 of armature 256 facilitates<br>
this positioning of the armature during the assembly process. Armature 256 is<br>
first tilted (as shown) with cutout 317 positioned below pivot support 266 and<br>
stop 265 thereof. Cutout 317 provides clearance that enables arm 318 above<br>
cutout region 314 to then be rotated into contact with pivot surface 270. Arm<br>
318 above cutout region 312 can then be easily swung over the end of pivot<br>
support 264 and into contact with pivot surface 268. During operation of<br>
circuit breaker 10, pivot arms 318 are maintained in contact with pivot<br>
surfaces 268 and 270 by way of retaining member 263 and retaining<br>
protrusions 267 of yoke 252. Two springs 253 (only one is dearly shown) are<br>
attached to and disposed between holes 320 of clapper 256 and holes 302 of<br>
terminal 28, with curved ends or hooks 253A of springs 253 protruding through<br>
the holes and providing the attachment. Springs 253 have a tendency to<br>
maintain a predetermined distance between bottom portion 319 of magnetic<br>
dapper 256 and front faces 260A and 262A of magnetic yoke 252, and to<br>
maintain clapper 256 in a position that is rotationally displaced in a clockwise<br>
manner from vertical (away from yoke 252). As seen in Figure 18A, stop or<br>
protrusion 265 of pivot support 266 is positioned to make contact with a<br>
clockwise rotated dapper 256 (near shoulder 315), defining a maximum angle<br>
of rotational displacement of clapper 256.<br>
When implemented in circuit breaker 10 as shown in Figure 7,<br>
automatic trip assembly 250 operates to cause a clockwise rotation of trip bar<br>
assembly 190, thereby releasing cradle 72 which leads to the TRIPPED<br>
disposition described above in connection with Figure 8, whenever overcurrent<br>
conditions exist in the ON disposition. In the ON disposition as shown in<br>
Figure 7, electrical current flows (in the following or opposite direction) from<br>
load terminal 28, through magnetic yoke 252 and bimetal 254, from bottom<br>
portion 287 of bimetal 254 to movable contact arm 50 through a conductive<br>
cord 289 (shown in Figure 3) that is welded therebetween, through closed<br>
contacts 52 and 56, and from stationary contact arm 54 to line terminal 29.<br>
Automatic trip assembly 250 reacts to an undesirably high amount of electrical<br>
current flowing through it, providing both a thermal and a magnetic tripping<br>
operation.<br>
The thermal tripping operation of automatic trip assembly 250 is<br>
attributable to the reaction of bimetal 254 to current flowing therethrough. The<br>
temperature of bimetal 254 is proportional to the magnitude of the electrical<br>
current. As current magnitude increases, the heat buildup in bimetal 254 has<br>
a tendency to cause bottom portion 287 to deflect (bend) to the left (as viewed<br>
in Figure 7). When non-overcurrent conditions exist, this deflection is minimal.<br>
However, above a predetermined current level, the temperature of bimetai<br>
254 will exceed a threshold temperature whereby the deflection of bimetai 254<br>
causes bottom portion 287 to make contact with thermal trip bar or member<br>
194 of trip bar assembly 190. This contact forces assembly 190 to rotate in<br>
the clockwise direction, thereby releasing cradle 72 which leads to the<br>
TRIPPED disposition. The predetermined current level (overcurrent) that<br>
causes this thermal tripping operation can be adjusted in a conventional<br>
manner by changing the size and/or shape of bimetal 254. Furthermore,<br>
adjustment can be made by selectively screwing screw 255 (Figure 18A---not<br>
shown in Figure 7) farther into opening 288 such that it protrudes to a certain<br>
extent through the other side of bimetal 254 (towards thermal trip member<br>
194). Protruding as such, screw 255 is positioned to more readily contact<br>
thermal trip member 194 (and thus rotate assembly 190) when bimetal 254<br>
deflects, thus selectively reducing the amount of deflection that is necessary to<br>
cause the thermal tripping operation.<br>
Cutout regions 280 and 282 of bimetal 254 have rounded comers 280A<br>
and 282A (Figure 20), respectively, which ease and facilitate the higher<br>
density downward current flow in those regions (during the ON disposition of<br>
circuit breaker 10) caused by the narrowing of the flow path of current<br>
between head portion 286 and neck 284. In an assembled automatic trip<br>
assembly 250, cutout region 282 extends down the length of bimetal 254<br>
substantially past the bottom of arms 260 and 262 of magnetic yoke 252 (see<br>
Figure 18A) in order to prevent interference with other internal and/or housing<br>
components positioned in close proximity thereto, in contrast, cutout region<br>
280 extends to a point approximately just below the bottom of arms 260 and<br>
262. This provides for a wider bimetal 254 below arms 260 and 262 of<br>
magnetic yoke 252 which reduces the susceptibility of those portions of<br>
bimetal 254 to increased eddy current effect heating that could cause an<br>
annealing or pitting of that area during high (interrupt) current conditions.<br>
Automatic trip assembly 250 also provides a magnetic tripping<br>
operation. As electrical current flows through magnetic yoke 252, a magnetic<br>
field is created having a strength that is proportional to the magnitude of the<br>
current. This magnetic field generates an attractive force that has a tendency<br>
to pull magnetic clapper 256 towards front faces 260A and 262A of yoke 252.<br>
The magnitude of this attractive force is enhanced because, as described<br>
above, the body of clapper 256 is wider than the body of yoke 252. When<br>
non-overcurrent conditions exist, the tension provided by springs 253<br>
connected between holes 320 of clapper 256 and notes 302 of load terminal<br>
28 prevent any substantial rotation of dapper 256. However, above a<br>
predetermined current level, a threshold level magnetic field is created that<br>
overcomes the spring tension, compressing springs 253 and enabling bottom<br>
portion 319 of clapper 256 to forcefully rotate counter-clockwise towards front<br>
faces 260A and 262A of yoke 252. During this rotation, bottom portion 319 of<br>
clapper 256 makes contact with magnetic trip bar or member 196 which, as<br>
shown in Figure 7, is partially positioned between clapper 256 and front faces<br>
260A and 262A of yoke 252. This contact moves the end of trip bar 196<br>
substantially between curved arms 260 and 262 of yoke 252, thereby forcing<br>
trip bar assembly 190 to rotate in the clockwise direction. This leads to the<br>
TRIPPED disposition as described in detail above in connection with Figure 8.<br>
As with the thermal tripping operation, the predetermined current level that<br>
causes this magnetic tripping operation can be adjusted. Adjustment may be<br>
accomplished by implementation of different sized or tensioned springs 253<br>
that are connected between bottom portion 319 of dapper 256 and load<br>
terminal 28.<br>
In Figures 7,18A, and 18B, it can be seen that portions 258 and 258A<br>
of magnetic yoke 252 substantially extend between bimetal 254 and load<br>
terminal 28. This positioning of metallic magnetic yoke 252 causes a general<br>
reshaping of the magnetic flux lines that are generated by the oppositely<br>
flowing currents in terminal 28 and bimetal 254 during the ON disposition of<br>
circuit breaker 10. By reshaping the flux lines, this configuration limits the<br>
interference between the flux lines, thereby reducing the outward blowoff force<br>
between terminal 28 and bimetal 254 that is generated during high (interrupt)<br>
current conditions. This reduction in blowoff force reduces the likelihood of<br>
the force causing terminal 28 and bimetal 254 to undesirably break apart<br>
during such high current conditions.<br>
Figures 22A and 226 depict an embodiment of load terminal 28 that<br>
may be used in circuit breaker 10. That embodiment, formed of stamped<br>
stainless steel having a thickness of approximately .047 inches, is most useful<br>
in applications where electrical current will normally be below approximately 30<br>
amps. For higher current applications, another embodiment of a load terminal<br>
may advantageously be used, as shown in Figures 28A, 28B, and 23C. In<br>
order to better accommodate the higher currents, terminal 28A of this<br>
embodiment is formed of stamped copper or brass of an increased thickness<br>
of approximately .093 inches. Terminal 28A includes a substantially planar<br>
portion 330 (again tapered) from which protrudes, in approximately<br>
perpendicular fashion, a bottom connector portion 332 with a hole or opening<br>
334 extending therethrough. Connector 332 also includes indents 331 on the<br>
top thereof, cutouts 333 that cause front face 335 to have a smaller width than<br>
the rest of connector 332, and a notch or cutout 337 extending from the<br>
bottom of front face 335 towards opening 334, as shown in Figure 28C.<br>
Located at the other end of terminal 28A is a top substantially planar region<br>
336 which is offset from portion 330 via a curved region 338. Formed through<br>
portion 330 are holes or openings 340 (for securement to magnetic yoke 252)<br>
and holes or openings 342 (for attachment of the two springs 253). A tab or<br>
protrusion 344 (having the same purpose as protrusion 306 of terminal 28)<br>
protrudes from one side of portion 330, with a corresponding cavity 346 on the<br>
other side. Ribbed portions 348 are also formed in portion 330 for the reasons<br>
described above with respect to ribbed portions 308 of terminal 28. Ribbed<br>
portions 348 are not as pronounced as ribbed portions 308 due to the genera)<br>
increased thickness of terminal 28A as compared to terminal 28, although they<br>
provide a similarly snug fit within channels 520 of base 12. Also shown are<br>
support ribs 350 for enhancing the strength of curved region 338. The<br>
operation of terminal 28A within circuit breaker 10 and, in particular, automatic<br>
trip assembly 250, is essentially the same as described above in connection<br>
with terminal 28.<br>
Referring now to Figure 29, shown is an example self-retaining collar<br>
295 that may be used with either load terminal 28 (or 28A) or line terminal 29<br>
to connect external conductors thereto. Collar 295 includes a base portion<br>
480 having a substantially open-ended square shape. Base 480 includes<br>
inwardly-facing detents or protrusions 482 formed in the two vertical sides<br>
thereof, and an upwardly-facing circular protrusion or raised surface 484<br>
formed on the bottom. A neck 486 is formed on the top of base 480, defining<br>
an opening through which a top portion 488 is inserted. in the exemplary<br>
embodiment, top portion 488 is a screw having a clamp portion 490 rotatably<br>
connected to the bottom thereof.<br>
In use, collar 295 is connected onto the end of one of the terminals of<br>
circuit breaker 10. Describing this connection with respect to load terminal 28<br>
shown in Figures 22A and 22B, connector portion 292 of terminal 28 is<br>
inserted into base 480 such that raised surfaces 297 abut detents 482, and<br>
until opening 294 is engaged by circular protrusion 484. Cutouts 299 of<br>
terminal 28 facilitate this insertion because they enable front face 301, which<br>
has a width that is smaller than the inner width of base 480, to easily slide in<br>
and "channel" the remainder of connector 292 therein. Protrusion 484 of collar<br>
295 provides an interference fit with opening 294 that resists lateral movement<br>
of the collar relative to terminal 28. Detents 482 of collar 295 prevent vertical<br>
movement of the collar relative to terminal 28, and the enhanced frictional<br>
engagement provided by raised surfaces 297 of connector 292 also resists<br>
lateral movement of the collar relative to terminal 28. Positioned as such (as<br>
shown in Figure 4), collar 295 is in a self-retained disposition.<br>
Describing the connection of collar 295 with respect to load terminal<br>
28A shown in Figures 28A and 28B, connector portion 332 of terminal 28A is<br>
likewise inserted into base 480 such that its top surface abuts detents 482,<br>
and until opening 334 is engaged by circular protrusion 484. Like cutouts 299<br>
of terminal 28, cutouts 333 of terminal 28A facilitate this insertion and provide<br>
a similar channeling effect for the remainder of connector 332. Notch or<br>
cutout 337 of connector 332 also facilitates the insertion because it is<br>
appropriately sized and configured to channel circular protrusion 484 of collar<br>
295 under connector 332 which is beneficial since connector 332 is of<br>
increased thickness as compared to connector 292 of terminal 28. Protrusion<br>
484 of collar 295 provides an interference fit with opening 334 that resists<br>
lateral movement of the collar relative to terminal 28A. Detente 482 of collar<br>
295 snap into indents 331 of connector 332, providing an interference fit that<br>
also resists lateral movement of collar 295 relative to terminal 28A, with<br>
detents 482 also preventing vertical movement of collar 295 relative to<br>
terminal 28A. A self-retained disposition of colter 295 is thus realized.<br>
After collar 295 is connected onto the end of one of the terminals of<br>
circuit breaker 10, the end of an external conductor can then be inserted<br>
between damp 490 and the top surface of the terminal's connector portion.<br>
Clamp 490 can then be lowered by means of rotation of screw 488 until the<br>
clamp frictionally secures the external conductor to the terminal. External<br>
access to screw 488 is provided by way of one of holes 20 in cover 14 (Figure<br>
1) which enables a tool such as a screwdriver to be inserted and to<br>
appropriately manipulate screw 488.<br>
Referring now to Figures 30A and 30B, shown are cradle 72 and cradle<br>
pivot pin 82 of the present invention. As shown in Figures 12 and 13, pin 82 is<br>
laterally and rotatably disposed between sideplates 84 of circuit breaker 10,<br>
and provides a point of rotation for cradle 72. As shown in Figure 30A, cradle<br>
72 has an opening 393 through which upper toggle link pivot pin 78 extends.<br>
Cradle 72 also includes an aperture 390 consisting of a smaller cutout or hole<br>
392 interconnected with (blending into) a larger cutout or hole 394. Larger<br>
cutout 394 is sized so as to be larger than the thickest diameter portion of pin<br>
82. Before pin 82 is positioned between holes 396 and 398 of sideplates 84<br>
(see Figure 13), pin 82 is easily inserted midway through larger cutout 394 of<br>
aperture 390. Because substantial pressure is not required in order to insert<br>
pin 82 through cutout 394, pin 82 may advantageously be heat-treated for<br>
strength so that it is more capable of withstanding the higher internal<br>
temperatures sometimes encountered in circuit breakers. As shown in Figure<br>
30B, pin 82 includes a stepped-inward portion 397 midway along its length.<br>
Pin 82 (presently inserted in larger cutout 394) is then shifted such that portion<br>
397 becomes seated into smaller cutout 392, cutout 392 being sized to<br>
provide engagement therewith while at the same time, in the exemplary<br>
embodiment, enabling pin 82 to rotate therein. Because portions 397A of pin<br>
82 around stepped-inward portion 397 are too thick to fit within smaller cutout<br>
392, they provide shoulders which ensure that cradle 72 remains centered on<br>
pivot pin 82. When pin 82 is then rotatably positioned between holes 396 and<br>
398 of sideplates 84, cradle 72 is able to rotate during the tripping and<br>
resetting operations of circuit breaker 10 described above. This rotation can<br>
occur in one of two manners: cradle 72 may rotate on (independently of) pin<br>
82, or cradle 72 may rotate with pin 82 (within holes 396 and 398 of sideplates<br>
84). These two methods of rotation are advantageous in that they provide<br>
increased flexibility to the operation of operating mechanism 38. In particular,<br>
proper rotation of cradle 72 can still occur even if pin 82 somehow locks up<br>
and cannot rotate within holes 396 and 398 of sideplates 84.<br>
During the assembly process, stop bar 88 serves to help maintain the<br>
engagement of stepped-inward portion 397 of prvot pin 82 with smaller cutout<br>
392 of cradle 72. As shown in Figures 6 and 8, stop bar 88 is positioned close<br>
to, and substantially to the left and below, an indent or cutout portion 395 of<br>
cradle 72 when the cradle is in an assembly-conducive position as depicted.<br>
Positioned as such, stop bar 88 has a tendency to abut indent 395 if cradle 72<br>
moves downwardly and/or to the left, thus preventing substantial movement in<br>
those directions which could result in a loose seating of pivot pin 82 in larger<br>
cutout 394. In the totally assembled circuit breaker 10, the pair of side-by-stde<br>
compression springs (not shown) acting upon cradle 72 provide a spring force<br>
which also serves to keep smaller cutout 392 engaged with stepped-inward<br>
portion 397 of pivot pin 82. Although stop bar 88 and the pair of side-by-side<br>
compression springs maintain the aforementioned engagement, they<br>
nonetheless enable a little "give" to exist in that engagement whereby cradle<br>
72 may advantageously move a small distance about pivot pin 82 which<br>
provides increased flexibility to the operation of operating mechanism 38.<br>
Referring again to Figures 12 and 13, stop bar 88 is shown laterally<br>
disposed between sideplates 84. Stop bar 88 includes ends 450 which are, in<br>
the exemplary embodiment, of a smaller diameter than the main portion of bar<br>
88 and separated therefrom by shoulders 452. During assembly, ends 450<br>
are inserted into holes 454 of sideplates 84 until shoulders 452 (which have a<br>
larger diameter than openings 454) contact inner surfaces 84B of sideplates<br>
84. After this insertion, portions 450A of ends 450 protrude out of holes 454<br>
along the outer surfaces 84A of sideplates 84. A machine, such as an orbital<br>
riveter, is then used to inwardly spin press portions 450A until outer shoulders<br>
456 are formed (only one is shown) which, although of sufficient thickness to<br>
be structurally firm, are thin enough so that they are substantially flush with<br>
respect to outer surfaces 84A of sidepiates 84. Because outer shoulders 456<br>
have a larger diameter than openings 454, they cooperate with inner<br>
shoulders 452 to heip maintain the spacing between sidepiates 84. in<br>
particular, outer shoulders 456 will resist further outward separation of<br>
sidepiates 84 potentially caused by, for example, forces generated during high<br>
current interruption. Inner shoulders 452 resist any inward movement of<br>
sidepiates 84 (towards each other) that could potentially occur. This<br>
maintenance of the spacing between sidepiates 84 serves to help ensure<br>
proper positioning and functioning of operating mechanism 38 components.<br>
Also shown in Figures 12 and 13 is a support bar 460 laterally disposed<br>
between sidepiates 84. Similar to stop bar 88, support bar 460 includes ends<br>
462 which are, in the exemplary embodiment, of a smaller diameter than the<br>
main portion of bar 460 and separated therefrom by shoulders 464. During<br>
assembly, ends 462 are inserted into holes 466 of sidepiates 84 until<br>
shoulders 464 (which have a larger diameter than openings 466) contact inner<br>
surfaces 84B of sidepiates 84. After this insertion, portions 462A of ends 462<br>
protrude out of holes 466 along the outer surfaces 84A of sidepiates 84. A<br>
machine, such as an orbital riveter, is then used to inwardly spin press<br>
portions 462A until outer shoulders 468 are formed (only one is shown).<br>
Although outer shoulders 468 are of sufficient thickness to be structurally firm,<br>
they are thin enough to be substantially flush with respect to outer surfaces<br>
84A of sidepiates 84. Because outer shoulders 468 have a larger diameter<br>
than openings 466, they cooperate with inner shoulders 464, and with stop bar<br>
88, to help maintain the spacing between sidepiates 84, in the manner<br>
described above in connection with stop bar 88.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, stop bar 88 and support bar 460 are formed<br>
of carbon steel metal. In addition, holes 466 for support bar 460 are preferably<br>
formed in areas of sideplates 84 that are substantially on the opposite side of<br>
where holes 454 are formed for stop bar 88. Such positioning of stop bar 88<br>
and support bar 460 provides for proper spacing maintenance of sidepiates 64<br>
along their entire length, in the exemplary embodiment, support bar 88 is<br>
positioned between trip bar assembly 190 and crossbar assembly 60, the<br>
exact positioning and size thereof selected so that it does not interfere with<br>
rotation of those components. In other embodiments, additional support bars<br>
may, of course, be used in order to further ensure proper spacing between<br>
sidepiates 84.<br>
Referring now to Figure 31 and again to Figures 12 and 13, shown are<br>
handle assembly 70 and associated parallel sidepiates 84 of the sidepiate or<br>
support member assembly of circuit breaker 10. Handle assembly 70 is<br>
formed of metal in the exemplary embodiment, and includes parallel and<br>
symmetrical handle assembly plates 100 that are connected together by a<br>
handle platform 101 that interconnects with handle 24 of circuit breaker 10 as<br>
described below. Each handle assembly plate 100 includes an opening 102<br>
(only one of which is shown in Figure 31) through which handle assembly<br>
roller 86 extends (Figure 5), and each also includes a circular pivot region 104<br>
that rotatably mates with a corresponding pivot surface cutout 106 (Figure 12)<br>
in each sideplate 84. Also shown are handle assembly actuation tabs or<br>
protrusions 108 that protrude from the bottom of each handle assembly plate<br>
100, each including an inwardly curved portion or contact member 109. Each<br>
sideplate 84 includes an actuation tab cutout region 110, including a bottom<br>
portion 111, that corresponds with each actuation tab 108 and provides for<br>
clearance thereof throughout a range of motion of handle assembly 70 during<br>
normal operation of circuit breaker 10, as described below. As shown in<br>
Figures 12 and 13, each sideplate 84 also includes an opening 105 into which<br>
is inserted the stem or shaft 107A of a stop or tab 107 having a head portion<br>
107B Stops 107 are configured so that they may be manufactured by a<br>
screw-machining process. The end of each stem 107A is spin pressed, for<br>
example by an orbital riveter, in order to secure stops 107 to sidepiates 84,<br>
with head portions 1078 positioned along the outer surfaces 84A of the<br>
sideplates and at least partially externally overlapping pivot surface cutouts<br>
106. Secured as such, stops 107 prevent pivot regions 104 of handle<br>
assembly 70 from becoming outwardly disengaged from pivot surface cutouts<br>
106 in sideplates 84 due to, for example, outward forces generated during<br>
high current interruption.<br>
Referring now also to Figures 32 and 33, and again to Figures 6 and 7,<br>
shown in Figure 32 is cam housing 62 of crossbar assembly 60 without a cam<br>
follower inserted therein. Disposed on and protruding generally from the top of<br>
cam housing 62 are stop members 112. Figure 7 depicts the disposition of<br>
cam housing 62, sideplates 84, and handle assembly 70 when circuit breaker<br>
10 is in the ON disposition. Note that, in order to provide for a normal range of<br>
movement of handle assembly 70 towards an OFF position, actuation tabs or<br>
arms 108 are separated from the bottom portion 111 of cutout region 110.<br>
The tops of stop members 112 are internally positioned between sideplates 84<br>
adjacent to actuation tab cutout regions 110 and not far below curved portions<br>
109 of actuation tabs 108. As such, stop members 112 are positioned to abut<br>
against curved portions 109 when handle 24 is attempted to be moved<br>
clockwise towards an OFF position at a time when contacts 52 and 56 and<br>
crossbar assembly 60 nonetheless remain in the ON disposition (such as<br>
when contacts 52 and 56 are in a welded-closed disposition). This abutment<br>
(shown in Figure 33), which occurs after a slight rotational movement of<br>
handle assembly 70, prevents further movement of assembly 70 in the<br>
clockwise direction (through the range of motion normally enabled by cutout<br>
regions 110), thereby preventing handle 24 from indicating that circuit breaker<br>
10 in in the OFF disposition when in fact it is not. As such, a clear indication is<br>
provided that contacts 52 and 56 have not opened even though an opening<br>
operation has been attempted. However, in normal operation when contacts<br>
52 and 56 can be opened, stop members 112 rotate clockwise with crossbar<br>
assembly 60 (and contact 52) when handle assembly 70 is moved clockwise<br>
towards the OFF position. As such, stop members 112 rotate away from<br>
actuation tab cutout regions 110, as shown in Figure 6. This allows for full<br>
movement of actuation tabs 108 within regions 110 which, in turn, allows<br>
handle 24 to move to the OFF position.<br>
Referring now also to Figures 34A, 34B, 34C, and 34D, shown is<br>
handle 24 of circuit breaker 10 which, in the preferred embodiment, is molded<br>
of an insulator material such as plastic. Handle 24 includes a top portion 403,<br>
and a base 404 haying a top curvilinear surface 405 and a bottom cavity<br>
region 406. Cavity region 406 includes protrusions 408 that define two<br>
channels 407 into which sides 101A and 101B of handle platform 101 (Figure<br>
31) of handle assembly 70 are inserted (as shown in, for example, Figures 4,<br>
5, and 6) to form an engagement connecting handle 24 to assembly 70. This<br>
connection enables manual movement of handle 24 to cause operating<br>
mechanism 38 to change disposition, as described above. Disposed<br>
approximately midway within one channel 407 (in the exemplary embodiment),<br>
between protrusions 408, is an integrally formed protrusion or nubb 409<br>
(Figure 34D) which, like the rest of handle 24 is preferably formed of an<br>
insulating material such as plastic which is at least partially compressible.<br>
Side 101B of platform 101 (Figure 31) includes, approximately midway therein,<br>
an indent or cutout 411 of approximately the same size and shape as<br>
protrusion 409. When platform 101 of handle assembly 70 is inserted into<br>
channels 407, protrusion 409 will deform (compress) slightly as it travels over<br>
the flat portions of sides 101B. As shown in the exemplary embodiment,<br>
protrusion 409 is preferably rounded in shape so as to facilitate this travel.<br>
When platform 101 is fully inserted into channels 407, protrusion 409 will<br>
return to its normal shape and become seated within indent 411. As such,<br>
protrusion 409 and indent 411 serve to center the connection between handle<br>
24 and handle platform 101. In addition, the frictional engagement of<br>
protrusion 409 with indent 411 serves to resist movement, of platform 101<br>
within channels 407, thereby providing a more secure connection between<br>
platform 101 and handle 24. In an alternative embodiment, a protrusion 409<br>
may be disposed in each channel 407, with corresponding indents 411 formed<br>
in both of sides 101A and 101B of platform 101.<br>
As shown in Figure 34B, base 404 of handle 24 includes a first side 410<br>
with a curvilinear top surface section 405A and terminating with an end portion<br>
414 which (in the exemplary embodiment) is substantially triangular in shape.<br>
A second side 416 is somewhat symmetrical to that of first side 410, except<br>
that it terminates with an end portion 418 that is truncated in comparison to<br>
end portion 414, providing a truncated curvilinear top surface section 405B. In<br>
the exemplary embodiment, end portion 418 is substantially concave in shape.<br>
Truncated end portion 418 clearly occupies less space than end portion 414,<br>
and is configured so as to not interfere (make contact) with other internal<br>
workings of circuit breaker 10 throughout the range of motion of handle 24. In<br>
particular, end portion 418 is configured so as to not interfere with automatic<br>
trip assembly 250 of trip mechanism 40 when circuit breaker 10 is in the OFF<br>
disposition or during a resetting operation, as shown in Figures 6 and 9,<br>
respectively.<br>
Referring now also to Figures 35-38, shown in Figure 35 is a curved<br>
handle slider 424 having an opening 426, a convex top surface 428, and a<br>
concave bottom surface 430. Within circuit breaker 10, slider 424 is<br>
positioned in a substantially overlapping relationship with handle 24 whereby<br>
bottom surface 430 is placed on top of and substantially overlaps top surface<br>
405 of handle 24, and top portion 403 of handle 24 protrudes through opening<br>
426. As shown in Figures 36 and 37, handle 24 and overlapping slider 424<br>
are positioned in relation to cover 14 whereby top portion 403 of handle 24<br>
also protrudes through opening 22 of the cover. In a conventional manner,<br>
slider 424 moves along a bottom surface 434 of cover 14 as handle 24 is<br>
rotated through its range of motion. The overlapping relationship of slider 424<br>
with handle 24, along with the fact that (in the exemplary embodiment)<br>
opening 426 of slider 424 is smaller than opening 22 of cover 14, provides a<br>
barrier which helps to prevent foreign rtems entered into opening 22 from<br>
reaching the internal workings of circuit breaker 10. For this purpose, slider<br>
424 preferably is thick enough such that it will not easily flex inward. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, slider 424 is approximately .055 inches thick of celcon<br>
thermoplastic material. Although thick enough to resist significant inward flex,<br>
slider 424 is relatively thin compared to base 404 of handle 24, and is thin<br>
enough to arc or ride over automatic trip assembly 250 of trip mechanism 40<br>
without interference (as can be seen in Figure 3).<br>
As handle 24 is rotated through its range of motion, top surface 428 of<br>
slider 424 makes contact with bottom surface 434 of cover 14 along arches<br>
436 thereof. This contact reduces the chances of separation that could<br>
compromise the barrier protection described above. As best shown in Figure<br>
38, base 404 includes grooves 438 that extend along the side edges of top<br>
surface 405 from end portion 414 to end portion 418. As top surface 428 of<br>
slider 424 makes contact with arches 436 of cover 14 throughout the range of<br>
motion of handle 24, this contact causes a slight deflection of the side edges<br>
of slider 424 into grooves 438. This deflection reduces the friction between<br>
slider 424 and bottom surface 434 of cover 14, enabling handle 24 to smoothly<br>
rotate through its range of motion. As such, grooves 438 enable a thicker<br>
slider 424 to be implemented than otherwise would be possible within the tight<br>
space constraints of circuit breaker 10, making the slider more resistant to<br>
inward flex and thus providing enhanced barrier protection. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment, grooves 438 are approximately .030 inches deep.<br>
In addition to having a truncated end portion 418, base 404 of handle<br>
24 includes a cut-away section 440 near one comer of end portion 418, as<br>
best shown in Figures 34A and 340. As shown in Figure 15, cut-away section<br>
440 provides clearance for button 25 of push-to-trip actuator 230, particularly<br>
when circuit breaker 10 is in the OFF disposition or during a resetting<br>
operation. As also shown in Figure 15, working in conjunction with cut-away<br>
section 440 is cutout 238 of button 25 which is positioned to provide clearance<br>
for slider 424 (not shown) throughout the range of motion of handle 24,<br>
Cutout 238 is sufficiently large so that top portion 25A of button 25 can be<br>
depressed notwithstanding the presence of slider 424 within cutout 238. As<br>
such, cutout 238 of button 25 and cut-away section 440 of handle 24<br>
cooperate in order to prevent Interference between push-to-trip actuator 230<br>
and the combination of handle 24 and slider 424.<br>
Referring now to Figures 39 and 40, and again to Figure 2, particular<br>
attention is directed to the profile between base 12 and cover 14 of circuit<br>
breaker 10. Base 12 is shown having a top region generally designated 120,<br>
and cover 14 is shown having a bottom region generally designated 122. Top<br>
region 120 of base 12 includes raised portions 124 that mats with<br>
corresponding cut-away or recessed portions 126 in bottom region 122 of<br>
cover 14. As shown in the side cross-sectional view of Figure 40 taken along<br>
the line 40-40 of Figure 1, when cover 14 is connected to base 12, appropriate<br>
attaching devices 128 (comprising mounting screws in the exemplary<br>
embodiment) are inserted into holes or openings 16 (Figure 2) in cover 14<br>
above recessed portions 126 and enter corresponding holes or openings 18 in<br>
raised portions 124 of base 12. Attaching devices 128 are selected so that,<br>
upon full insertion, the bottoms thereof do not substantially, if at all, penetrate<br>
base 12 below its raised portions 124. As such, this mounting arrangement<br>
conserves space within the main body of base 12 whereby attaching devices<br>
128 do not interfere with the internal workings therein. The dimensions of<br>
raised portions 124 and recessed portions 126 are selected so that attaching<br>
devices 128 can nonetheless penetrate a sufficient depth into base 12 so as to<br>
provide a sufficiently strong connection between base 12 and cover 14. In<br>
one exemplary embodiment, attaching devices 128 are approximately 1 inch in<br>
length and penetrate approximately 1/2 inch into raised portions 124 of base<br>
12.<br>
As shown in Figure 40 and described above, attaching devices 128<br>
provide a mounting arrangement between base 12 and cover 14. Referring<br>
now also to Figure 41, attaching device 128 of the exemplary embodiment is<br>
shown including a main member 132 comprising a mounting screw with a<br>
head 134 and a body separated into a non-gripping (non-threaded) portion 136<br>
and a gripping (threaded) portion 138. Attaching device 128 also includes a<br>
compressible member 140 that (when fully assembled) is adjacent to head 134<br>
and engaged by non-threaded portion 136 of mounting screw 132.<br>
Compressible member 140 may be an elastomeric washer (as in the<br>
exemplary embodiment), or it may be another compressible device such as a<br>
spring, in the cross-sectional view of Figure 40, attaching device 128 is<br>
shown assembled and inserted into opening 16 (Figure 2) in cover 14 and<br>
corresponding opening 18 in base 12. Figure 40 shows gripping portion 138<br>
extending into and attaching with base 12, non-gripping portion 136 extending<br>
through cover 14, and head 134 providing a stop for limiting the possible<br>
separation between base 12 and cover 14. Compressible member 140 is<br>
shown in a position between head 134 and a top surface of cover 14. in this<br>
mounting arrangement, the compressibility of member 140 permits base 12<br>
and cover 14 to temporarily and substantially instantaneously separate a small<br>
distance when pressure develops within circuit breaker 10 such as due to the<br>
generation of gases during high current interruption (opening of contacts 52<br>
and 56). This separation along the interface between base 12 and cover 14<br>
allows the generated gases to be vented, providing a pressure release that<br>
protects the structural integrity of circuit breaker 10.<br>
Referring now to Figures 42, 43, 44A, 44B, 45A, 45B, 45C, and 46,<br>
shown are support members 150A and 150B of circuit breaker 10 in<br>
connection with base 12 and cover 14. Base 12 includes sidewalls 152 within<br>
which are formed slots 154A and 155A. As shown in Figure 43 which depicts<br>
a top view of base 12 without components therein, sidewalis 152 also include<br>
grooves or channels 156 adjacent to slots 154A, and grooves or channels 157<br>
adjacent to slots 155A, both formed on the outer surfaces 152A of sidewalls<br>
152. Base 12 also includes small recesses 21A formed in the top of sidewalls<br>
152. Cover 14 includes sidewails 153 (only one of which is viewable in Figure<br>
42) within which are formed slots 154B and 155B which align with slots 154A<br>
and 155A, respectively, of base 12 when cover 14 is positioned on top of base<br>
12. Sidewalls 153 also include grooves or channels that are similar to<br>
channels 156 and 157 of base 12.<br>
Support member 150A includes a pair of shoulders or support wings<br>
158 and a connection wall 160 therebetween, forming essentially an I-beam as<br>
shown in Figures 44A and 44B. Support member 150A of the exemplary<br>
embodiment also includes an opening 159 and a cutout region 161 that<br>
substantially extends upwardly into wall 160. Support member 150B includes<br>
a pair of shoulders or support wings 162 and a connection wall 163<br>
therebetween, also forming essentially an I-beam as shown in Figures 45A,<br>
45B, and 45C. In the exemplary embodiment, wall 163 includes an elongated<br>
integral housing 164 having an upwardly extending cutout region 165.<br>
In use, as shown in Figure 46, support member 150A is inserted into<br>
slots 154A of base 12 whereby shoulders 158 engage grooves 156. In this<br>
position, connection wall 160 is disposed internally within the body of base 12<br>
and generally perpendicular to sidewalls 152. In relation to the other internal<br>
components of circuit breaker 10, support member 150A is disposed between<br>
arc extinguisher assembly 34 and slot motor assembly 32 in the exemplary<br>
embodiment. In that position, the clearance provided by cutout region 161<br>
facilitates the transfer of arcs (created by contact separation) to arc chute 46<br>
of arc extinguisher assembly 34 in order to be dissipated, while wall 160<br>
serves as a barrier for protecting the internal workings of circuit breaker 10<br>
(those components to the left of support member 150A as viewed in Figure<br>
46) from arcing and/or hot gases. Cutout region 161 also ensures that<br>
movable contact arm 50 has sufficient room to move throughout its required<br>
range of motion. Opening 159 provides clearance for upper arc runner 48A<br>
(Figure 3) of arc chute 46 which is inserted therethrough.<br>
As also shown in Figure 46, support member 150B is inserted into slots<br>
155A of base 12 whereby shoulders 162 engage grooves 157. As such,<br>
connection wall 163 is disposed internally within the body of base 12 and<br>
generally perpendicular to sidewalis 152. In relation to the other internal<br>
components of circuit breaker 10, support member 150B is disposed between<br>
slot motor assembly 32 and sideplates 84 in the exemplary embodiment. In<br>
that position, cutout region 165 provides clearance for movable contact arm 50<br>
to move throughout its required range of motion. Elongated housing 164<br>
serves to fill vacant space between slot motor assembly 32 and sideplates 84,<br>
and works with the rest of wall 163 to act as a barrier for protecting the internal<br>
workings of circuit breaker 10 (those components to the right of support<br>
member 150B as viewed in Figure 46} from arcing and/or hot gases potentially<br>
created by contact separation.<br>
Cover 14 is then placed on top of base 12, whereby the tops of support<br>
members 150A and 150B are inserted into slots 154B and 155B, respectively,<br>
and shoulders 158 and 162 engage their respective grooves, as shown in<br>
Figure 1. Disposed as such, the I-beam nature of each of support members<br>
150A and 150B prevents or limits further separation of sidewalls 152 and 153<br>
due to circumstances such as the buildup of pressure wrthin circuit breaker 10<br>
resulting from the generation of gases during high current interruption<br>
(opening of contacts 52 and 56). in addition, shoulders 158 and 162 are<br>
appropriately dimensioned and manufactured of suitable material so as to<br>
enable support members 150A and 150B to also allow venting of circuit<br>
breaker 10 whereby pressure can be released. Upon a particular threshold<br>
pressure within circuit breaker 10, the outer edges of shoulders 158 and 162<br>
"wing" slightly outward (away from the grooves) to provide this outward<br>
venting through slots 154A, 154B, 155A, and 155B, white at the same time<br>
maintaining sidewalls 152 and 153 at or near a constant separation distance.<br>
The width of connection walls 160 and 163 near shoulders 158 and 162,<br>
respectively, are selected so as to permit such venting through the slots<br>
notwithstanding the presence of those portions in the slots. Additional venting<br>
is provided by openings 21 (Figure 1) which are formed at the interface<br>
between recesses 21A of base 12 and the bottom of sidewalls 153 of cover<br>
14. Openings 21 are small enough and appropriately configured so that<br>
insertion of foreign items therein is substantially prevented.<br>
Although two support members 150A and 150B are implemented in the<br>
exemplary embodiment, other numbers of such support mechanisms may, of<br>
course, be employed. Furthermore, the exact placement of one or more such<br>
support members is preferably experimentally established via the analysis of<br>
stress conditions in the base and cover of a particular circuit breaker. \n one<br>
embodiment, support members 150A and 150B are formed of molded material<br>
comprising quantum 8800 (60% glass reinforced).<br>
Now referring to Figures 47A and 47B, shown is an insulation barrier or<br>
deflector 500 of the present invention. Deflector or shield 500 includes a<br>
vertical wall 502 having sides with channels or grooves 504. Integrally<br>
connected to wall 502 is a shoulder 506 on which is formed a rounded cap<br>
508. An opening 509 is formed in the top of cap 508, and an opening 510 is<br>
formed in the underside of shoulder 506, forming a cylindrical cavity<br>
therebetween. In one embodiment, deflector 500 is integrally molded of a<br>
thermoset plastic material.<br>
Now referring also to Figures 48 and 49, shown in Figure 48 is a side<br>
elevationat view of the internal components of circuit breaker 10 without arc<br>
extinguisher assembly 34. Line terminal 29 is shown connected to a self-<br>
retaining collar 295. In Figure 49, deflector 500 is shown positioned above<br>
collar 295, with cap 508 on top of and covering screw 488 such that screw 488<br>
may at least be partially inserted within opening 510. Vertical wall 502 of<br>
deflector 500 is positioned along the side of collar 295 that normally faces arc<br>
extinguisher assembly 34.<br>
Referring also now to Figure 50, shown is deflector 500 in relation to<br>
base 12 and cover 14 (the other circuit breaker components, including collar<br>
295, not shown for the sake of clarity). When deflector 500 is implemented<br>
within circuit breaker 10, it is vertically slid into base 12 such that grooves 504<br>
engage vertically-extending protrusions 514 which are formed on the inner<br>
surfaces 152B of sidewalls 152 (see also Figure 43). This engagement<br>
substantially prevents any lateral movement of deflector 500 relative to base<br>
12, and enables vertical wall 502 to extend substantially perpendicularty<br>
between sidewalls 152 of base 12 without any gaps near its edges.<br>
Protrusions or rails 514 are, of course, appropriately positioned in base 12 so<br>
that a fully inserted deflector 500 is property aligned with respect to the collar<br>
295 that is connected to line terminal 29. When cover 14 is secured to base<br>
12, portions of cover 14 are positioned close to and above the top of cap 508<br>
whereby vertical movement of deflector 500 relative to base \2 is also<br>
substantially prevented. In addition, one of holes 20 of cover 14 aligns with<br>
opening 509 of deflector 500, thereby enabling a tool such as a screwdriver to<br>
be externally inserted into the cavity of cap 508 and to appropriately<br>
manipulate screw 488 (Figure 29) of collar 295 in order to tighten or loosen the<br>
connection of line terminal 29 to an external conductor.<br>
Positioned as described above within circuit breaker 10, deflector 500<br>
provides an insulation barrier for effectively protecting collar 295 from arcing<br>
and/or hot gases that may be generated within circuit breaker 10, particularly<br>
during interruption of high currents.<br>
Referring now to Figures 51-54, shown is an example of a conventional<br>
multi-wire lug assembly 360 that may be used as an accessory for circuit<br>
breaker 10 to enable more than one conductor line to be routed therethrough.<br>
Assembly 360 includes a body 362 with a plurality of lugs 364 arranged in<br>
step-like fashion thereon. Assembly 360 also includes a front wall 365 from<br>
which protrudes an appropriately configured connector portion 366 that is<br>
insertable into load conductor opening 26 in base 12 (see Figure 1) and<br>
securable to load terminal 28 of circuit breaker 10 via a securement device<br>
such as self-retaining collar 295. Also shown is a lug insulator 370 of the<br>
present invention. Insulator 370 includes a main body 372 formed of two<br>
substantially parallel plates 374 with a wall 376 (Figure 52) therebetween.<br>
Near its front, insulator 370 also includes an integral locking strap or locking<br>
structure 378 with two vertical side bars 379 and a horizontal bar 381<br>
therebetween forming an opening 380 that is appropriately sized and<br>
configured for insertion of connector 366 of lug assembly 360 therein. Each<br>
plate 374 includes a tapered portion 382, a front portion 383, and, in the<br>
exemplary embodiment, an internally disposed protrusion 384 (only one is<br>
shown). In a preferred embodiment, insulator 370 is comprised of<br>
thermoplastic material.<br>
As shown in Figure 53, before connection to a circuit breaker, lug<br>
assembly 360 may advantageously be assembled to lug insulator 370, with<br>
body 362 placed between plates 374 and connector 366 inserted through<br>
opening 380 of locking strap 378 until front wail 365 contacts bars 379 and bar<br>
381 of locking strap 378. Positioned as such, a top surface 363 of lug<br>
assembly 360 abuts against the bottoms of protrusions 384 of plates 374.<br>
This abutment, along with wail 376 (Figure 52) of insulator 370 and horizontal<br>
bar 381 of locking strap 378, serves to help secure lug assembly 360 to lug<br>
insulator 370 and prevent vertical separation therebetween. After the<br>
aforementioned assembly, connector 366 of lug assembly 360 may then be<br>
inserted, in normal fashion, into load conductor opening 26 in base 12 of<br>
circuit breaker 10 (as shown in Figure 54) and secured to toad terminal 28 via<br>
a securement device such as collar 295 (not visible). Note that front portions<br>
383 of plates 374 abut against external surfaces of base 12, providing<br>
enhanced stability to the connection. Once connector 366 is secured to load<br>
terminal 28, insulator 370 is locked in place and cannot be separately removed<br>
(pulled away) due to the contact between locking strap 378 thereof and front<br>
wall 365 of lug assembly 360.<br>
Lug insulator 370 provides electrical insulation for multi-wire lug<br>
assembly 360. While providing this protective insulation, lug insulator 370<br>
nonetheless provides easy access to lugs 364 of lug assembly 360. In<br>
particular, tapered portions 382 of plates 374 follow the step-like configuration<br>
of lugs 364 so that convenient access is provided for all lugs.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been<br>
described with a certain degree of particularity, various changes to form and<br>
detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention<br>
as hereinafter claimed.<br>
