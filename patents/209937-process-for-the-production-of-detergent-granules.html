PROCESS  FOR THE PRODUCTION OF DETERGENT GRANULES<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House,  165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra,  India<br>
The  following   specification   particularly  describes  the   nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
M/l<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08I3S<br><br>
/ 'PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF DETERGENT GRANULES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD 5<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of detergent compositions fay a non-spray drying process.<br>
10<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Traditionally, detergent powders were produced by spray drying.  However, the spray drying process is both capital 15  and energy intensive and the products were quite bulky, having a relatively low bulk density.<br>
The desire for powders with higher bulk densities led to the development of processes which employ mainly mixing, without<br>
20  the use of spray drying.  These mixing techniques offer<br>
great flexibility in producing powders of various different compositions from a single plant, by post-dosing, various components after an initial granulation stage.  The resultant powders have fairly high bulk densities, which is<br>
2 5  desirable for some product forms.  However, many of these<br>
non-spray drying techniques are unsuitable for production of powders over a wide bulk density range and in particular, for the production of lower bulk density powders.<br>
30  One kind of process, which does not involve spray-drying, and which is capable of producing medium bulk densities<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08138<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
between those of spray dried and other non-spray dried powders, involves use of a low shear granulator, usually a fluidised bed apparatus.  Although fluidised bed granulation processes per se can give good control of bulk density, 5  there was still a need for greater flexibility and in particular, for producing lower BD powders.<br>
A common fluidised bed process involves contacting a neutralising agent such as an alkaline detergency builder<br>
10  with a liquid acid precursor of an anionic surfactant in the fluidised bed or other low shear apparatus.  Such a process is described in WO-A-96/04359.  The acid precursor is thereby neutralised to the salt form of the surfactant and the surfactant and other components inside the apparatus<br>
15  form granules.<br>
in order to adapt the low shear granulation process of WO-A-96/04359 to produce lower bulk densities, it was proposed in WO-A-99/00475 to incorporate some inorganic acid<br>
20  together with the liquid acid precursor of the anionic<br>
surfactant.  A subsidiary advantage of this process is that the powders produced show improved dissolution rates in the wash liquor. However, there is no mention of any effect of the particle size of the neutralising agent used to<br>
25  neutralise the anionic acid precursor and the inorganic acid.<br>
WO-A-00/37605 discloses a process in which an organic (non-surfactant) acid is used in combination with a carbonated 3 0  neutralising agent to provide products with bulk densities below about 600 g/1.  In the examples, the neutralising<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08138<br><br>
-   3    -<br>
agent, sodium bicarbonate, is of 5-40,um size.  However, the total disclosure only mentions high shear mixer/granulators and there is no link made between the particle size of the neutralising agent and the bulk density of the product. 5<br>
It is an object of the present invention to use a non-surfactant salt formed in  situ  to yield lower bulk densities and optionally also, improved powder properties, in lower shear mechanical granulation processes. 10<br>
This object is achieved by forming the salt from a neutralising agent having a smaller particle size.<br>
15  DEFINITION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a low shear mechanical granulation process for the production of detergent granules, the process comprising contacting an acid 20  precursor of an anionic surfactant, a non-surfactant acid<br>
and a solid carbonated neutralising agent wherein the solid<br>
carbonated neutralising agent has a d3(2 average particle<br>
size no  more than 90 um,   preferably no  more than 80um,   more preferably no more than 70/um, still more preferably no more 25  than 60/um, yet more preferably no more than 50um and especially no more than 40/um.<br>
Relative to equivalent granules produced by equivalent low shear processes whereby the average particle size of the 30  neutralising agent is larger, granules produced by the<br>
present invention have lower bulk densities and optionally<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08138<br><br>
-   4    -<br>
one or more of the following benefits, namely better flow, less stickiness, smaller particle size, narrower particle size distribution and better dissolution in water.  In some embodiments, the process of the present invention may enable 5  a higher surfactant loading of the granules whilst maintaining acceptable powder properties.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
10<br>
The process of the present invention may be carried out in either batch or continuous mode of operation as desired.<br>
The Solid Carbonated Neutralising Agent<br>
15<br>
As used herein, the term "solid carbonated neutralising agent" means any material introduced to the process as a solid and which is able to release carbon dioxide upon reaction with the non-surfactant acid.<br>
20<br>
The solid carbonated neutralising agent preferably comprises one or more materials selected from alkali metal carbonates, sesqicarbonates and bicarbonates, preferably sodium salts thereof, as well as burkeite.<br>
25<br>
The neutralising agent is most preferably present at a level sufficient to neutralise fully the anionic acid precursor and (in the first aspect of the present invention) the non-surfactant acid.  If desired, a stoichiometric excess of<br>
30  neutralising agent may be employed to ensure complete<br>
neutralisation and/or to perform an alternative function.<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08I38<br><br>
-    5   -<br>
For example, if the neutralising agent comprises sodium carbonate, it can act as a alkaline buffering agent or detergency builder, the latter especially when also accompanied by a seed crystal material such as calcite. 5<br>
The maximum d312  average particle size of the solid<br>
carbonated neutralising agent is expressed above and in<br>
claim 1.  Preferably the minimum d3,2  particle size of the<br>
solid carbonated neutralising agent is 1/um, more preferably 0  4/um, most preferably 10/um.<br>
By ,,average d3,2 size" is meant the surface weighted mean diameter given by the equation:<br><br>
wherein ni is the number of particles in size class i<br>
0        D1 is the median diameter value in size class i m is the number of size classes<br>
If evaluation is performed by sieve analysis, preferably at least 8 sieves are used.  However, preferably laser 5  diffraction is used, e.g. using a Sympatec or Malvern<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT7EP02/08138<br><br>
-    6   -<br>
instrument. In that case, preferably analysis is carried out on the basis of at least 31 size classes.<br>
Of course, a given d3,2    average particle size may be 5  inherent in a commercially available raw material, or may be achieved by milling a commercial sample.  It may also be achieved by mixing two or more raw materials of different morphologies.<br>
10  The solid carbonated neutralising agent may be provided as a raw material already having the required particle size or it may be sourced as more coarse material and reduced by an appropriate technique such as milling.<br>
15  The Acid Precursor of an Anionic Surfactant<br>
The acid precursor of the anionic surfactant may actually comprise one or more acid precursors of different anionic surfactants.  The most preferred of these is alkyl benzene<br>
2	0  sulphonic acid, for example having from 10 to 14 carbon<br>
atoms on average, in the alkyl chain thereof.  Other suitable acid precursors of anionic, surfactants comprise the acid precursors of primary alkyl sulphates and alkyl olefin sulphonates, as well as the acid precursors of alkyl ether 25  sulphates.  In all cases, these materials preferably have on average in the aliphatic moiety thereof, from 10 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
Within the scope of the term "acid precursor of an anionic<br>
3	0  surfactant" are saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, the<br>
resultant  "anionic surfactant" therefore being soap.<br><br>
7<br>
Typical chain lengths of these fatty acids are from 10 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
The Non-Surfactant Acid<br>
The non-surfactant acid is an essential feature of the first aspect of the invention and an optional feature of the second aspect of the invention. It may comprise one or more inorganic acids which are compatible with the anionic surfactant precursor and/or one or more organic acids which are not surfactants or acid precursors of anionic surfactants. Preferably, non-surfactant organic acids have less than 10, more preferably less than 8, in some cases, less than 6 carbon atoms, e.g. formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, citric acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, aspartic acid, glutaric acid, tartaric acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, 3-chetoglutaric acid and citramalic acid. Of the inorganic acids, sulphuric acid is preferred. However, other suitable inorganic acids include, for example phosphoric acid, nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
AS indicated in IN190487,acid precursors of anionic surfactants commonly include inorganic acid, usually sulphuric acid, as an impurity or by-product of their process of manufacture. IN 190487 states that the inorganic acid should constitute at least 2.5% by weight of the acidic component (i.e. anionic acid precursor plus inorganic acid). The most preferred level is 20% by weight of that total. These levels of non-surfactant acid in the process of the present invention are also desirable.<br><br>
8<br>
However, IN 190487 also sets a preferred upper limit of 50% by weight of the acidic<br>
component.<br>
Nevertheless, in the context of the present invention, it is even more preferred that the<br>
non-surfactant acid is used at a level which is at least 50%, still more preferably at least<br>
60%, especially at least 70% by weight of the total weight of the anionic acid precursor<br>
plus non-surfactant acid.<br>
Notwithstanding the exact amount of non-surfactant acid used relative to the non-surfactant acid precursor, of more significance to the reduction bulk density and other benefits is the total amount of salt formed in situ by reaction of the non-surfactant acid with the neutralizing agent. It is preferred that this amount of in situ salt is at least 5% by weight, preferably at least 10% by weight, more preferably at least 25% by weight, most preferably at least 50% of those granules. The level of salt thus produced depends in self-evident fashion, upon the amounts of non-surfactant acid and neutralizing agent used. This is in contrast to the teaching of IN190487 which only mentions a maximum level of 4% by weight of in situ salt on the basis of the weight of the granules. The maximum total in situ salt level in the granules, is preferably 95%, more preferably 90%, still more preferably 80% and especially 60% by weight of the granules.<br>
Where the non-surfactant acid is a solid, preferably it is introduced as a solution in an appropriate solvent such as water.   Inorganic acids and some organic non-surfactant<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08138<br><br>
_   9   _<br>
acids are supplied in various concentrations.  As well as salt impurities, the remainder of the product is mainly water.  The non-surfactant acid will often be a source of water introduced to the process.  Preferably, this is kept 5  to a minimum.  However, towards the end of the process,<br>
optionally a little water or preferably, an aqueous solution of an inorganic alkali such as sodium hydroxide or sodium silicate, may be sprayed on separately, to reduce stickiness.<br>
10<br>
The total water in all components applied at or around the time of contacting the neutralising agent with the non-surfactant acid and anionic acid precursor does not exceed 25wt% of the total of acid precursor plus non-surfactant<br>
15  acid, but preferably no more than 10wt%.  If the water level is above 10%, preferably drying is carried out in the granulator or in a subsequent stage, e.g. using heated air. However, if desired, a controlled amount of water may be added to facilitate neutralisation.  The water may be added<br>
20  in amounts of 0.5 to 10wt% by weight of the final detergent composition.  Any such water is suitably added prior to or together or alternating with the addition of the acidic components.<br>
25  The in situ  formed Salt<br>
The first aspect of the invention requires the in  situ formation of the salt.<br>
3 0  The precise nature of the salt formed will depend on the amounts and nature of the reactants and the reaction<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EPO 2/08138<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
conditions.  For example, in the case- of sulphuric" acid and ~" any of the neutralising agents recited in the previous section, the resultant salt may be a sulphate, hydrogen sulphate, mixed carbonate/sulphate etc. or mixtures thereof. 5<br>
Order of Addition of Components<br>
The mechanical granulation apparatus may comprise a single such apparatus or two or more apparatuses connected in<br>
10  series, provided at least one is of low shear type.  Where two or more such machines are connected in series, individual starting materials may be added in different machines.  Whether there is one or more machines, individual components may be dosed into different positions in those<br>
15  machines.<br>
However, the most preferred way of carrying out the first aspect of the present invention is to pre-mix at least part of the anionic acid precursor and the noti-surfactant acid 2 0  and dose that mixture into the apparatus to contact the carbonated solid neutralising agent.<br>
Another variant is for the non-surfactant acid and the<br>
anionic acid precursor to be dosed separately into the<br>
25  apparatus simultaneously to contact the neutralising agent.<br>
Another variant comprises separate dosing of the anionic acid precursor and the non-surfactant acid sequentially into the apparatus to contact the neutralising agent, such that 30  at least some of tJie acid precursor contacts the<br>
neutralising agent before start of dosing of the non-<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08138<br><br>
-    11    -<br>
surfactant acid, or vice  versa,   with at least some overlap time in dosing.  The non-surfactant acid may even be dosed starting from the time at, or after, cessation of the dosing of the anionic acid precursor. 5<br>
The least preferred embodiment is with sequential dosing, i.e. with overlap, or immediately sequentially, or with a time interval therebetween, of the non-surfactant acid and the acid precursor, such that dosing of the non-surfactant 10  acid starts before dosing of the anionic acid precursor.<br>
Variants of the above methods will readily be appreciated by those skilled in the art, for example with "pulsed" dosing of anionic acid precursor and non-surfactant acid, either 15  with time overlap or with time intervals therebetween. However, the aforementioned general principles still generally apply.<br>
The Mechanical Granulation Apparatus 20<br>
The present invention requires use of a low shear granulator.  As used herein, the term "low shear mechanical granulation process" means a process whereby the only or the final stage of granulation is effected by a low shear non-25  spray-drying method, i.e. using a low shear mechanical<br>
granulator.  Thus, as well as processes which do not involve spray drying at any stage, it also includes, for example, a process whereby a feed of solids produced by spray-drying is passed to a subsequent process stage wherein the spray-dried 3 0  particles are involved in further granulation by a process which includes a low shear non-spray drying granulation<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08138<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
technique.  The term would not encompass a technique whereby spray-dried powders are further dried in a low shear apparatus unless they are also at that stage, granulated with some further component.  The term does include 5  processes where pre-granulation occurs in a non-low shear mixing apparatus and further granulation occurs in a low shear machine, but preferably, at least some neutralisation of non-surfactant acid then occurs in that low shear apparatus.<br>
10<br>
A preferred kind of low shear granulator is of the gas fluidisation type, which comprises a fluidisation zone in which the liquid binder is sprayed into or onto the solid neutralising agent.  However, a rotating drum matching, or<br>
15  V-blender can also be used.  When the low shear granulator is of the gas fluidisation kind it may sometimes be preferable to use equipment of the kind provided with a vibrating bed.<br>
20  If the low-shear granulator is of the gas fluidisation kind, then the anionic acid precursor and non-surfactant acid can be sprayed from above and/or below and/or within the midst of the fluidised material comprising the solid neutralising agent.<br>
25<br>
If a gas fluidisation granulator is used as the low-shear granulator, then preferably it is operated at a superficial<br>
air velocity of about 0.1-2.0 ms-1 , either under positive or<br>
negative relative pressure and with an air inlet temperature 30  ranging from -10° or 50C up to 800C, or in some cases, up to 200°C.  An operational temperature inside the bed of from<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08138<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
ambient temperature to 60°C is typical.  Depending on the process, it may be advantageous to vary the temperature (upwardly and/or downwards, during at least part of the process).<br>
5<br>
A low-shear granulator used in the process of the present invention may be adapted to recycle "fines", i.e. powdered or part-granular material of vary small particle size, so that they are returned to the input of the low shear<br>
0  granulator and/or input of any pre-mixer/granulator.<br>
Preferably the fine particulates are elutriated material, e.g. they are present in the air leaving a gas fluidisation chamber.<br>
15 It is preferred to operate the fluidised bed granulator such that solid material is contacted with a spray of the liquid components to meet the requirement that the excess velocity<br><br>
(where pp is the particle density) is at a critical value of at least 2 for at least 30% of the process.<br>
(Ue) of fluidisation gas relative to the mass or volume flux of the spray (qmliq or qvliq) when determined at the 0  normalised nozzle-to-bed distance (Do)  is set so that the flux number (FNm or FNV). as determined- by.<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08138<br><br>
-   14   -<br>
It is also preferred that d3/2 average droplet diameter of the liquid components is not greater than ten times the d3,2 average particle diameter of that fraction of the solids which has a d3(2 particle diameter of from 20 urn to 200 urn, 5  provided that if more than 90% by weight of the solid<br>
starting material has a d3,2 average particle diameter less than 20 um then the d3,2 average particle diameter of the<br>
total solid starting materials shall be taken to be 20 um. If more than 90% by weight of the solid starting material 0  has a d3(2 average particle diameter greater than 200 urn than the d3(2 average particle diameter of the total starting solid material shall be taken to be 200 um<br>
In a refinement of processes of the invention which use a 5  low shear granulator, the neutralising agent may be contacted and mixed with a first portion of the acid components in a first mixer, which may be for example a low, moderate or high shear mixer to form a partially granulated material.  Suitable granulators for carrying out this first 20  stage are - described in more detail hereinbelow.  This can<br>
then be admixed with a second portion of the acid components in a low shear granulator, to form the granulated detergent product.  If the acidic components are dosed separately in this way, they do not necessarily need to comprise the same 5  ratio of anionic acid precursor to non-surfactant acid.<br>
In such a two-stage granulation process, it is preferred, but not absolutely necessary, for the total of liquid binder<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08138<br><br>
-   15   -<br>
to be dosed only in the partial granulation (first) and second steps.  Conceivably, some could be dosed before partial granulation and/or other fluidisation.  Also, the content of the liquid binder (e.g. the non-surfactant acid 5  content) could be varied between the partial granulation and second stages.<br>
Whether or not an initial pre-granulation step is used, particulate material comprising the solid neutralising agent<br>
10  and optionally, other components, may be introduced into the fluidised bed and the required amounts of anionic acid precursor and non-surfactant acid then introduced, preferably by spraying, onto the said material, preferably from above.  Optionally, a flow aid may be introduced with<br>
15  the starting materials.  However, it is preferred that the flow aid be added after introduction of part of the anionic acid precursor and/or non-surfactant acid, in order to improved powder properties.<br>
2 0  However, the invention requires use of a low shear<br>
mechanical granulator.  Other suitable granulators for an optional pre-granulation step include a high speed<br>
R<br>
mixer/granulator such as a Lodige CB machine or a moderate¬speed mixer such as a LodigeR KM machine.  Other suitable<br>
25  equipment includes Drais T160 series manufactured by Drais<br>
Werke GmbH, Germany; the Littleford mixer with internal chopping blades and turbine-type miller mixer having several blades on an axis of rotation.  A low- or high-shear mixer granulator has a stirring action and/or a cutting action 30  which are operated independently of one another.  Preferred<br><br>

Compositional   Features<br>
15      The  invention  also  encompasses  both granules  and detergent compositions  obtainable by a  process  according to  the present   invention.<br>
Granules made by a process  according  to the present 20      invention optionally contain one  or more  additional<br>
components . in  addition to. those  arising- from processing- of the  anionic  acid precursor,   the  non-surfactant  acid and  the neutralising  agent.<br>
2 5      In addition,   granules made  by  a process  according  to  the present   invention may be  incorporated  in a detergent composition  comprising one or more post  dosed materials. Solid post-dosed materials  comprise powders,   other granules {whether or not  made by a process  other  than the   invention)<br>
30      and mixtures  thereof.     Granules  made by the process of  the<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT7EP02/08138<br><br>
-   17   -<br>
invention and post-dosed solids can simply be admixed or subject to further granulation by any suitable process. Post-dosed liquids are conveniently sprayed onto the granules themselves and/or onto (if present) any post-dosed 5  solids.<br>
As well as the non-surfactant acid (where applicable) and anionic acid precursors (which are usually pourable or viscous liquids, or pastes), one or more other liquid<br>
10  materials such as liquid nonionic surfactants and/or organic solvents may be applied to any suitable stage.  The total amount of anionic acid precursor and non-surfactant acid will normally be as high as possible, subject to the presence of any other components and subject to other<br>
15  considerations referred to below.  Some of the anionic acid precursor and any non-surfactant acid optionally may be pre-neutralised.  Other optional components applied at or around the time of contacting the neutralising agent with the anionic acid precursor and any non-surfactant acid,<br>
20  preferably constitute less than 5wt%, more preferably less than 2wt%, of the total of non-surfactant acid plus anionic acid precursor but may constitute up to 25wt%, 50wt% or even 75wt% of the liquid binder.<br>
25  The weight ratio of all acid precursor(s) of anionic<br>
surfactant(s) to any optional nonionic surfactants, will normally be from 20:1 to 1:20.  However/ this ratio may be, for example, 15:1 or less, 10:1 or less/ or 5:1 or less of acid precursors of anionic surfactant(s) to nonionic<br>
30  surfactants (s) .  On the other hand, the nonionic may be the major component so that the ratio is 1:5 or more, 1:10 or<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08138<br><br>
-   18   -<br>
more, or 1:15 or more of acid precursors of anionic surfactant(s) to nonionic surfactants(s).  Ratios in the range from 5:1 to 1:5 a of acid precursors of anionic surfactant(s) to nonionic surfactants(s) are also possible. 5<br>
Optionally, a "layering agent" or "flow aid" may be introduced at any appropriate stage.  This is used to improve the granularity of the product, e.g. by preventing aggregation and/or caking of the granules.  It has already 10  been described above, how such a material may be introduced. Any layering agent/flow aid is suitably present in an amount of 0.1 to 15wt% of the detergent composition and more preferably in an amount of 0.5 to 5wt%.<br>
15  Suitable flow aids include crystalline or amorphous alkali metal silicates, aluminosilicates including zeolites, Dicamol, calcite, diatomaceous earth, silica, for example precipitated silica, chlorides such as sodium chloride, sulphates such as magnesium and sodium sulphate, carbonates<br>
2 0  such as calcium carbonate and phosphates such as sodium tripolyphosphate.  Mixtures of these materials may be employed as desired.<br>
In addition to the anionic surfactant obtained by the 25  neutralisation step, further anionic surfactants or nonionic surfactants as mentioned above, also cationic, zwitterionic, amphoteric or semipolar surfactants and mixtures thereof may be added at a suitable time.  In general, suitable surfactants include those generally described in "Surface 30  active agents and detergents" Vol. I by Schwartz and Perry. If desired, soap derived from saturated or unsaturated fatty<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EPO 2/08138<br><br>
-   19   -<br>
acids having, for example, C10 to C18 carbon atoms may also be present.<br>
The total detergent active is suitably present at a level of 5  5 to 40wt%, preferably 10 to 30wt% of the final granulated detergent product.<br>
A complete detergent composition often contains a detergency builder.  Such a builder may be introduced with the<br>
10  neutralising agent and/or added subsequently as desired.<br>
Preferably ,the builder is introduced with the agent.  However, as already explained, some carbonated solid neutralising agents by themselves, or in the presence of a co-agent, can act as builders.  Sodium carbonate is a<br>
15  typical example.  Therefore, such materials may be incorporated in excess of the amounts necessary to neutralise the anionic acid precursor and non-surfactant acid.<br>
20  Generally speaking, the total amount of detergency builder in the granular detergent product is suitably from 10 to 80wt%, preferably 15 to. 65wt% and more preferably 15 to 50wt%.<br>
25  Other suitable builders include crystalline and amorphous aluminosilicates, for example, zeolites as disclosed in GB 1 473 201, amorphous aluminosilicates as disclosed in GB 1 473 202 and mixed crystalline/amorphous aluminosilicates as disclosed in GB 1 470 250; and layered<br>
30  silicates as disclosed in EP 164 514B.  Inorganic phosphate<br><br>

PCT/EP02/08138<br><br>
-   20   -<br>
builders,   for example,   sodium orthophosphate,   pyrophosphate and  tripolyphtosphate,   may  also be present.<br>
Aluminosilicates,   whether used as  layering  agents   and/or 5      incorporated in the  bulk of   the particles may suitably be present   in a total   amount   from 10   to  60  wt%   and preferably an amount  of  from  15   to  50   wt%  of  the  granulated  detergent product.     The  zeolite used  in most  commercial  particulate detergent  compositions  is   zeolite A.     Advantageously,<br>
10      however,   maximum aluminium  zeolite  P   (zeolite MAP)   described and claimed in EP  384   070  may be  used.     Zeolite  MAP  is  an alkali  metal  aluminosilicate  of  the  P type  having  a  silicon to  aluminium ratio  not  exceeding  1.33,   preferably not exceeding  1.5,   and more preferably not  exceeding   1.07.<br>
15<br>
Organic builders that may be present include polycarboxylate polymers such a polyacrylates, acrylic/maleic copolymers, and acrylic phosphinates; monomeric polycarboxylates such as citrates, gluconates, oxydisuccinates, glycerol mono-di- and<br>
20  trisuccinates, carboxymethyloxysuccinates, carboxymethyioxymal ona tes,   dipi col inates,<br>
hydroxyethyliminodiacetates, alkyl- and alkenylmalonates and succinates; and sulphonated fatty acid salts.  A copolymer of maleic acid, acrylic acid and vinyl acetate is especially<br>
25  preferred as it is biodegradable and thus environmentally desirable.  This list is not intended to be exhaustive.<br>
Especially preferred organic builders are citrates, suitably used in amounts of from 5 to 3 0 wt%, preferably from 10 to 30  25 wt%; and Acrylic polymers, more especially acrylic/maleic copolymers, suitably used in amounts of from 0.5 to 15 wt%,<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08138<br><br>
-   21   -<br>
preferably from 1 to 10 wt%.  Citrates can also be used at lower levels (e.g. 0.1 to 5 wt%) for other purposes.  The builder is preferably present in alkali metal salt, especially sodium salt form. 5<br>
Suitably, the builder system may comprise a crystalline layered silicate, for example, SKS-6 ex Hoechst, a zeolite, for example, zeolite A and optionally an alkali metal citrate.<br>
10<br>
Detergent compositions according to the invention may also suitably contain a bleach system.  Fabric washing compositions may desirably contain peroxy bleach compounds, for example, inorganic persalts or organic peroxyacids,'<br>
15  capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution.<br>
Granules obtained by the process of the present invention suitably have a low bulk density in the range 300 to 650 g/1, or 450 to 650 g/1, for example, in the proximity of 500 20  g/1 and is thus comparable to a bulk density obtained by the method of spray-drying.<br>
The composition may also comprise a particulate filler which suitably comprises an inorganic salt, for example sodium 25  sulphate and sodium chloride.  The filler may be present at a level of 5 to 60% by weight of the composition.<br>
A fully formulated detergent composition produced according to the invention might for example comprise the detergent 30  active and builder and optionally one of more of a flow aid,<br><br>
WO 03/016453<br><br>
PCT/EP02/08138<br><br>

a  filler and other minor ingredients  such as   colour, perfume,   fluorescer,   bleaches   and enzymes.<br>
The   invention will  now be   illustrated by the   following non-5      limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
10      This   example  illustrates  the  effect  of using milled  sodium carbonate  as  a neutralising  agent   for a LAS/sulphuric  acid mixture,   on the bulk density of  a granular detergent product.<br>
15      Liquid  solutions  comprising various  ratios  of   linear  alkyl benzene  sulphonic  acid   (LAS)   and  sulphuric acid were prepared as   indicated  in Table  1.     The  liquid  solutions were then  sprayed onto particulate material   in a  fluidised bed apparatus   at  a temperature  of   60°C -  70°C.     The  particulate<br>
20      material  comprised sodium carbonate  as neutralising  agent, added  in excess  to  cope with  the  alternative   function as  a builder,   and other materials   such as   sodium tripolyphosphate (STP),   zeolite   {as  a   flow aid),   sodium sulphate   {as   a filler)   and minors   such as   fluorescer and anti-redeposition<br>
25      agent   {SCMC).     Fluid bed granulation effected  the  formation of  neutralised acids  and the  production of  a   free  flowing granular detergent  product.<br>
In  control A,   the  sodium carbonate was  a commercial   grade  of 30      having a  d3,2  average particle  size  of   106/um.      In Examples   1-<br><br>

Stickiness<br>
This test 'is used to measure the cohesiveness of a detergent powder. The powder is compressed into a compact and the 5  force required to break the unconfined compact is measured. The total weight required to break the compact (in kg) is stated in the table.<br>
Dissolution test<br>
10<br>
The detergent powder is added to water of 18 degrees French Hardness, at a temperature of 25°C and which is stirred at a constant rate. As the powder dissolves, the ionic strength of the solution increases proportionately with time and is<br>
15  measured using a conductivity probe. By plotting<br>
conductivity versus time a profile of the dissolution rate of the powder can be generated. The time at which 90% of the maximum conductivity has been reached, is reported.<br><br>
