				<td>METHOD AND MACHINE FOR BINDING ELONGATE OBJECTS<br>
TOGETHER<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for binding<br>
elongate objects together by means of at least one<br>
wire, in particular for lashing reinforcing bars,<br>
electric cables or the like, two claws provided with<br>
guide surfaces fox- the wire being guided down over the<br>
objects to be bound together, after which a wire is fed<br>
along the guide surface of one claw and across to the<br>
guide surface of the other claw, so that it is shaped<br>
into a wire loop surrounding the objects on three<br>
sides, and the legs of the wire loop are twisted<br>
together on the fourth side of these objects.<br>
The invention also relates to a machine for use in<br>
implementing such a method.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Conventionally, the lashing of reinforcing bars to form<br>
reinforcing mats is carried out with the aid of simple,<br>
manual tools, which is a very time-consuming and thus<br>
expensive and also laborious operation, which is apt to<br>
give rise to attritional injuries. The reason for this<br>
is that, when lashing reinforcing mats for concrete<br>
slabs, arches or the like using previous aids, the<br>
operator has to bend for long periods of time, which<br>
leads to great stress on the back.<br>
In this connection, the lashing of the reinforcing bars<br>
is usually effected with the aid of tongs or a twisting<br>
tool, by means of which the ends of a wire, which is<br>
arranged by hand around the reinforcing bars at the<br>
various intersection points, are twined or twisted<br>
together for firm connection of the bars. Carrying out<br>
lashing in the conventional manner also involves risks<br>
of accident, especially in the case of work on roofs,<br>
bridges and the like, owing to the stooped working<br>
position which, inter alia, leads to risks of falling<br>
accidents.<br>
In my International patent application PCT/SE91/00571,<br>
a machine is descx-ibed for binding intersecting bars<br>
together by means of wires, in particular for lashing<br>
reinforcing bars, which machine works in accordance<br>
with the method indicated in the first paragraph above.<br>
By means of this machine, the lashing operation can be<br>
made considerably mox-e efficient at the same time as<br>
the abovementioned risks of injury can be eliminated or<br>
considerably reduced, as this machine allows the<br>
operator to work upright.<br>
In known lashing machines, which are provided with a<br>
rotatable twisting head arranged above the jaws so as<br>
to replace the manual twisting-together of the wire<br>
ends with the aid of tongs or the like, there is inter<br>
alia a risk of the lashing wire breaking as a result of<br>
excessive tension in it if the wire parts are secured<br>
in the twisting head. Furthermore, it can be difficult,<br>
owing to tensile forces in the wire, to make the latter<br>
surround the reinforcing bars closely at the twisting<br>
location.<br>
The present invention is based on the knowledge that<br>
this is due to the fact that the machine cannot imitate<br>
the movement of the hand during manual twisting. When<br>
manual twisting-together of two wire ends is carried<br>
out, the wire is first stretched around the reinforcing<br>
bars. During twisting, the hand and thus the wire ends<br>
will then approach the upper reinforcing bar in the<br>
course of twisting owing to the fact that the twisting<br>
itself requires a certain wire length.<br>
In a twisting machine with a rotatable twisting head,<br>
the wire ends are usually secured in the twisting head<br>
throughout the twisting operation, which means that the<br>
extra wire length required for the twisting itself<br>
cannot be fed down through the twisting head. This<br>
results in increased tension in the wire, which may<br>
lead to the latter breaking and those portions of the<br>
wires which are twisted together being drawn up from<br>
the reinforcing bars, so that an interspace is formed<br>
between the uppermost bar and the twisted-together<br>
portions of the wire ends.<br>
Another disadvantage of known lashing machines is that<br>
they comprise pivotable claws which have to be closed<br>
and opened a great many times a day by hand movements<br>
of the operator, which is very tiring. Moreover, the<br>
risk of functional disorders of the machine increases.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
method for binding elongate objects together in the way<br>
indicated in the first paragraph above, which can be<br>
implemented without risk of the wire breaking or the<br>
attachment of the wire loop obtained to the objects<br>
being defective.<br>
Another object is to provide a simple, reliable machine<br>
for use in implementing the method.<br>
The invention is based on the knowledge that the<br>
abovementioned aims can be achieved by virtue of the<br>
twisting head being made so that the wire ends are held<br>
in it in such a way that wire can be drawn out from the<br>
head when the tension in the wire exceeds a given value<br>
during a twisting operation.<br>
According to the present invention, a method of the<br>
type indicated in the first paragraph is then<br>
particularly characterized in that the wire is fed to<br>
the said guide surface of one claw via a first guide<br>
arrangement in an arrangement which is rotatable<br>
relative to the claws, and is fed away from the second<br>
claw via a second guide arrangement in the rotatable<br>
arrangement, in that the rota table arrangement is made<br>
to rotate for twisting-together of the two parts of the<br>
wire for binding together the objects the wire<br>
surrounds, and in that, during twisting together, the<br>
wire is held in each guide arrangement in the said<br>
rotatable arrangement such that the wire length<br>
necessary for twisting-together of the wire parts is<br>
allowed to be drawn out while a resistance is overcome.<br>
By virtue of the fact that wire can be drawn out from<br>
the twisting head during twisting together, no<br>
detrimental tension or traction arises in the wire,<br>
which may cause the wire to break. As the drawing-out<br>
of wire takes place counter to a certain resistance,<br>
the twisting-together will take place closely adjacent<br>
to the objects to be bound together. In this way,<br>
functioning similar to that during manual twisting is<br>
achieved.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a retracting force is<br>
applied to the wire after it has been fed but before<br>
twisting together has started. In this way, the wire is<br>
stretched, so that it surrounds very closely the<br>
objects to be bound together, which further improves<br>
the twisting result.<br>
The wire is suitably fed to the claws from a reel and<br>
is cut off before the rotatable arrangement is made to<br>
rotate. During the feed of the wire from the guide<br>
surface of one claw to the guide surface of the other<br>
claw, the wire is guided by a movable means which is<br>
guided by the first said claw and is carried along by<br>
the wire in its feed movement. This allows the use of<br>
fixed claws, which is a very great advantage since,<br>
inter alia, tiring hand movements are avoided, and<br>
because a machine of the type described has to be very<br>
robust and impact-resistant in order to cope with the<br>
very rough treatment to which it is usually subjected<br>
on a building site.<br>
The particularly characteristic features of a machine<br>
for use in implementing the method emerge from the<br>
first independent claim directed to the machine.<br>
An especially preferred embodiment of this machine is<br>
characterised in that the rotatable arrangement is in<br>
the form of a cylinder with guide ducts for the wire<br>
passing through in the axial direction and in that the<br>
said cylinder is arranged rotatably in a cylindrical<br>
guide.<br>
Further features of the invention emerge from<br>
subsequent claims.<br>
The invention will be described in greater detail below<br>
with reference to the embodiments shown by way of<br>
example in accompanying drawings.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawing figures<br>
Fig. 1 shows diagrammatically a machine according to<br>
the invention before a work operation.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates how the lower part of the machine is<br>
positioned over an intersection of reinforcing bars to<br>
be bound together.<br>
Figs 3-8 show one embodiment of the machine according<br>
to the invention partly in section and in various<br>
states during the performance of a work cycle.<br>
Figs 9-13 show a preferred embodiment of the machine in<br>
the same states as shown in Fig 3-8<br>
Detailed description of embodiments of the machine<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates diagrammatically the basic<br>
construction of one embodiment of a machine according<br>
to the invention. Reference number 1 designates a<br>
handle and 2 an activating switch. The handle 1 is<br>
connected to the rest of the machine via a telescopic<br>
part 3 which can be freed and set in different<br>
positions by means of a locking button 4. In this way,<br>
the overall length of the machine can be adapted<br>
depending on the work operation concerned and the<br>
height of the operator.<br>
The machine comprises two fixed claws 6 and 7 connected<br>
firmly to the cylindrical outer casing 5. The claws are<br>
separated from one another by a spacing which allows<br>
them to be guided down over an intersection of<br>
reinforcing bars 8 or other objects to be bound<br>
together. In this connection, the outer casing 5 is<br>
designed as a supporting body with a seat 9 adapted to<br>
the shape of the reinforcing bars 8. Before a lashing<br>
operation, the machine can then be set down on the<br>
reinforcing bars 8, so that it rests on these (see<br>
Fig. 2).<br>
The claws 6, 7 are made with guide grooves 10 and,<br>
respectively, 11 for a lashing wire 12 which is used<br>
for binding reinforcing bars together. This is effected<br>
by wire from a wire reel arranged in the housing 13<br>
being fed to a twisting arrangement 14 which, after the<br>
wire has been made to surround two intersecting<br>
reinforcing bars by means of the claws 6, 7 and after<br>
cutting off the wire, twists together the two legs of<br>
the wire loop obtained, as will be described in greater<br>
detail below.<br>
The twisting head 14 is driven by a shaft 15 from an<br>
electric motor 16 via a gear reduction device 17.<br>
Further components of one embodiment of the machine and<br>
a work cycle for it will now be described in greater<br>
detail with reference to Figs 3-8. In addition to parts<br>
described previously, these figures show<br>
diagrammatically a battery 18, which drives the motor<br>
16. The housing 13 contains a reel 19 for lashing wire<br>
12, which, reel can, in connection with lashing wire<br>
being drawn off from it by means of two feed rollers<br>
20, be displaced along a guide in the wire-feed<br>
direction while compression of a spring 21 takes place.<br>
Reference number 22 designates a knife, arranged in the<br>
fixed outer casing, for cutting off the wire 12 before<br>
a twisting-together operation.<br>
The twisting head consists of an inner cylinder 14,<br>
which is mounted rotatably in the cylindrical outer<br>
casing 5. The inner cylinder 14 comprises two feed and<br>
guide ducts 23 and 24 for the lashing wire. Also<br>
mounted in the inner cylinder 14 is a scissors-like<br>
construction which comprises two legs which are<br>
pivotable relative to one another and can be pressed<br>
apart by virtue of a suitably somewhat elastic ball 25<br>
being pressed downwards between the upper ends 26 of<br>
the legs, which results in the lower ends 27 of the<br>
legs being pressed outwards and entering into braking<br>
engagement with lashing wire fed into the ducts 23 and<br>
24, as will be described in greater detail below. Owing<br>
to the lever action obtained, it will be possible for<br>
the leg ends 27 to be pressed outwards with great<br>
force.<br>
The ball 25 is provided with a guide pin 29 which is<br>
inserted freely into a threaded spindle 28 and can be<br>
pressed into the spindle 28 counter to the action of a<br>
spring 30. Reference number 31 designates a bearing<br>
arrangement which prevents the guide pin 29 and the<br>
ball 25 being carried along in the rotation of the<br>
spindle 28.<br>
The threaded spindle 28 interacts with a corresponding<br>
thread in a hole 32 in a top closure of the outer,<br>
fixed cylinder 5. The threaded spindle 28 merges with<br>
an upper, smooth part 43 with a driving pin 33 which<br>
projects out into a slot 34 in a tubular driving shaft<br>
15 from the gear reduction device 17.<br>
Reference number 3 5 designates a solenoid which is fed<br>
via slip-ring contacts 36 and actuates a locking means<br>
37 which, when the solenoid is activated, is pressed in<br>
and fixes a lashing wire 12, which has been introduced<br>
into the duct 24, so that it cannot be retracted.<br>
As shown in the section through the claw 6 in Fig. 3A,<br>
a channel-shaped guide device 38 is arranged in the<br>
guide groove 10 in the claw 6. The channel-shaped guide<br>
device 38 is arc-shaped and displaceable along the<br>
claw, as will be described in greater detail below. The<br>
guide channel 38 is connected via a line 39 to a<br>
spring-loaded roller 40, so that displacement of the<br>
guide channel 38 takes place while a spring in,, the<br>
roller 40 is tensioned.<br>
At its front edge, the guide channel 38 is made with a<br>
stop surface 41, with which the front end of the<br>
lashing wire. 12 will interact in order to carry the<br>
guide channel along in its feed movement. The opposite<br>
claw 7 comprises a recess 42 adapted to receive a part<br>
of the front part of the guide channel 38 in order to<br>
free the front end of the wire 12 from the stop surface<br>
41, as will be explained in greater detail below.<br>
In order for it to be possible to bring about reliable<br>
guidance of the wire during its feed, the guide groove<br>
11 in the second claw 7 is closed by means of two<br>
spring-loaded, cover-like elements 44 (see Fig. 3B)<br>
which can be displaced in the direction away from one<br>
another when a wire 12 is drawn out from the guide<br>
groove 11 in the lateral direction, as will be<br>
described in greater detail below.<br>
In Fig. 3, the machine has been set down, so that it<br>
rests on the upper of two intersecting reinforcing bars<br>
8, and is ready for feed of the lashing wire 12, which<br>
has been cut by means of the knife 22 in a previous<br>
lashing operation.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates how the feed rollers 20 have been<br>
started for drawing a wire 12 off from the reel 19.<br>
This has then been displaced along its guide in the<br>
wire-feed direction while compressing the spring 21.<br>
The spring 21 should be so weak that it is compressed<br>
when wire is drawn off but is still capable of<br>
returning the reel 19 to its upper end position when<br>
wire is fed back into the space in the housing 13. If<br>
so required, the housing 13 can be provided with means<br>
which interact with the reel 19 to bring about a<br>
certain braking of the rotation of the reel in order to<br>
ensure that the reel is displaced counter to the action<br>
of the spring 21 during drawing-off of wire. In this<br>
figure, the wire 12 has been fed down to the guide<br>
channel 38 mounted in the claw 6, so that the front end<br>
of the wire has come into contact with the front stop<br>
wall 41 of the channel and has in this connection<br>
carried the channel along in its continued feed<br>
movement. The wire 12 will therefore, during its<br>
passage across the gap between the claws 6 and 7, be<br>
guided by a guide channel 38 carried along by the wire<br>
itself. The use of such a guide channel makes it<br>
possible to make the machine with fixed claws which do<br>
not have to be capable of moving towards one another<br>
during feed of the wire, which is a very great<br>
advantage from a number of points of view, as mentioned<br>
above.<br>
It can be seen from Fig. 5 how, as a consequence of the<br>
continued feed of the wire 12, the front part of the<br>
guide channel 38 has reached the guide groove 11 of the<br>
second claw 7 and has in this connection been inserted<br>
into a recess 42. The result of this is that the front<br>
end of the wire has been freed from the stop wall 41<br>
and fed up further into the guide groove 11 in the claw<br>
7 (see Fig. 5A) . In the position shown in Fig. 5, the<br>
end of the wire 12 has been fed up into the guide duct<br>
24 in the inner cylinder 14 past the position of the<br>
fixing device 37 operated by means of the solenoid 35.<br>
In this position, the feed of the wire is stopped, and<br>
the solenoid 35 is activated, so that the front end of<br>
the wire is fixed in the guide duct 24 in the cylinder<br>
14 (see Fig. 6). When this has taken place, the driving<br>
direction of the feed rollers 20 is reversed, a certain<br>
length of the wire 12 then being retracted. The length<br>
of wire retracted is inserted into the housing 13, the<br>
wire reel 19 being returned under the action of the<br>
spring 21. This return is also assisted by the feeding-<br>
back of the wire, it being possible for the reel to be<br>
locked for rotation in the clockwise direction. If so<br>
required, however, the reel 19 can also be rotated for<br>
taking up retracted wire. In the case of rigid wire,<br>
however, it is preferred that the wire only has to be<br>
fed into the casing 13 by the rollers 20 and under the<br>
influence of the tensile force from the spring 21.<br>
When the retraction described of the wire 12 takes<br>
place, the latter will be drawn out in the lateral<br>
direction from the outwardly open guide channel 38 in<br>
the claw 6 and will also be drawn out in the lateral<br>
direction from the guide groove 11 in the claw 7. The<br>
cover-like closing elements 44 will then be pressed<br>
apart by the wire counter to the action of associated<br>
springs. The position shown in Fig. 6 is then reached,<br>
in which the wire 12 closely surrounds the reinforcing<br>
bars 8 to be twisted together in the same way as in the<br>
case of a manual lashing operation. In this connection,<br>
the spring-loaded spool 40 has also, via its line 39,<br>
drawn the guide channel 38 back into its starting<br>
position in the claw 6.<br>
Before twisting together, the wire 12 is cut off by<br>
means of the knife 22, and the solenoid 35 is<br>
deactivated, so that the locking means. 37 frees the<br>
wire end (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, the motor 16 is<br>
started, which causes the tubular output shaft 15 of<br>
the gear reduction device 17 to begin to rotate (see<br>
also Fig. 7A). The spindle 43 provided with the drivex-<br>
pin 33 will be carried along in this rotation, which<br>
leads to the lower, threaded part 28 of the spindle<br>
drawing the spindle downwards, the driver pin 33<br>
running in the slot 34. In this connection, the spring<br>
30 and the guide pin 29 will press the somewhat elastic<br>
ball 25 down between the upper ends 26 of the scissors-<br>
like arrangement in the cylinder 14. This means that<br>
the lower ends 27 of the legs will be pressed out into<br>
firm engagement with the wire 12 in the guide ducts 23<br>
and 24 in the cylinder 14. This takes place without any<br>
rotation of the scissors-like construction or the<br>
cylinder 14 on account of the guide pin 29 and the<br>
spring 30 being freely guided in the sleeve-shaped<br>
spindle 28.<br>
When the spindle 28 has descended to the ball 25, the<br>
engagement of the leg ends 27 with the wire 12 in the<br>
guide ducts 23, 24 has reached such a value that the<br>
wire ends are retained securely in the guide ducts but<br>
in such a way that they can still, when a certain<br>
tensile force arises in the wire, be drawn out of the<br>
guide ducts owing to the fact that at least the surface<br>
layer of the ball 25 is elastic.<br>
In this position, the threaded spindle 28 will make<br>
contact with the elastic ball 25 and will then carry<br>
both the ball and the scissors-like construction and<br>
thus the inner cylinder 14 as well along in its<br>
continued rotational movement (see Fig. 8) . This is<br>
effected while certain additional deformation of the<br>
elastic ball 25 takes place. Owing to the rotation of<br>
the inner cylinder 14, the ends of the wire 12 will be<br>
twisted together on the top side of the uppermost<br>
reinforcing bar 8 and will in this connection bring<br>
about secure binding-together of the reinforcing bars<br>
at the intersection point. To achieve tight binding-<br>
together of the reinforcing bars, the spacing between<br>
the mouths of the two guide ducts 23, 24 in the inner<br>
cylinder 14 and the spacing between the lower smrface<br>
of the latter and the top surface of the uppermost<br>
reinforcing bar should be selected depending on the<br>
dimensions of the reinforcing bars to be bound<br>
together. The man of art can easily establish suitable<br>
values for these spacings by experimentation, so that<br>
twisting takes place while the wire ends are drawn in<br>
the lateral direction, like when tying a shoelace. It<br>
is then possible to achieve as tight a binding-together<br>
of the reinforcing bars as is illustrated in Fig. 8. A<br>
distance between the lower surface of the inner<br>
cylinder and the top surface of the uppermost<br>
reinforcing bar of the order of 1 cm gives sufficient<br>
space to accommodate the twist and results in a good<br>
twisting result. In this connection, it may prove<br>
suitable to arrange a rubber ring in the mouth of each<br>
guide duct in order to increase the friction against<br>
the wire.<br>
The embodiment described above includes separate means,<br>
the scissors-like construction, for securing the wire<br>
in the guide ducts.<br>
However, such means can normally be dispensed with,<br>
especially when using a relatively stiff lashing wire,<br>
such as that which is used for instance in Sweden for<br>
lashing reinforcing bars in concrete constructions. Due<br>
to the stiffness of the wire, after the wire has been<br>
drawn off from the reel it tends to resume its curved<br>
shape which leads to the wire being pressed against the<br>
walls of the guide ducts at various positions. This<br>
results in an increased friction between the wire and<br>
the walls of the ducts.<br>
Further, as the wire during a twisting operation is<br>
pulled out obliquely from the mouths of the two guide<br>
ducts the wire is bent around and pressed against the<br>
edge ox each mouth. This gives rise -to a substantial<br>
increase of the force required to pull out the wire<br>
from the guide ducts.<br>
Thus, there is normally such a resistance against the<br>
pulling out of the wire that a tight twist is obtained<br>
without the use of any separate securing means in the<br>
guide ducts.<br>
This makes it possible to design a very simple, robust<br>
and reliable lashing machine the lashing head of which<br>
in its simplest embodiment may comprise an inner<br>
rotable cylinder provided with two guide ducts for the<br>
lahing wire and an outer, fixed guiding cylinder.<br>
Such a preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
will now be described with reference to Figs 9-13 which<br>
corrspond to and show the machine of this preferred<br>
embodiment in the same states and situations as the<br>
already described embodiment has been shown in Figs 3-6<br>
and 8. Parts of the preferred embodiment which directly<br>
correspond to parts of the already described embodiment<br>
have been give the same reference numerals as in that<br>
embodiment. Such parts and their operation will not be<br>
described once again.<br>
In Fig 9 the lashing machine is shown in the same state<br>
as in Fig 3. The scissors-like construction has been<br>
dispensed with and the twisting head comprises just an<br>
inner rotatable cylinder 14 which is driven by a shaft<br>
45 from the gear reduction device 17 and guided in the<br>
outer cylindrical casing 5. The inner end 46 of the<br>
shaft 45 is threaded into the inner cylinder 14.<br>
However, the shaft can be coupled to the inner cylinder<br>
also by other means as is realised by the skilled man.<br>
Like the previously described embodiment the inner<br>
cylinder 14 comprises two feed and guide ducts 23 and<br>
24 for the lashing wire 12 and solenoid 35 which<br>
actuates a locking means 37 in the guide duct 24.<br>
As regards Figs 10-12 reference is made to the<br>
description of Figs 5-7 showing the previously<br>
described embodiment in certain operation states.<br>
Following the step illustrated in Fig 12 the wire 12 is<br>
cut off by means of the knife 22, and the solenoid 35<br>
is deactivated, so that the locking means 37 frees the<br>
wire end, see Fig 13. Then the motor 16 is started,<br>
which causes the drive shaft 45 to rotate. Due to the<br>
coupling between the shaft and the inner cylinder 14<br>
also this cylinder will be carried along in the<br>
rotation of the shaft.<br>
Owing to the rotation of the inner cylinder 14, the<br>
ends of the wire 12 will be twisted together on the top<br>
side of the uppermost reinforcing bar 8 and will in<br>
this connection bring about secure binding-together of<br>
the reinforcing bars at the intersection point. To<br>
achieve tight binding-together of the reinforcing bars,<br>
there must be a certain tension in the wire during the<br>
twisting operation. This tension is created due to the<br>
resistance that must be overcome when pulling out the<br>
wire. The resistance is caused by the friction between<br>
the wire and the ducts 23 and 24 in the inner cylinder<br>
and especially the friction against the edges of the<br>
lower mouths of the ducts where the wire is bent when<br>
pulled out at an oblique angle during a twisting<br>
operation. In order to increase this friction a ring of<br>
rubber or other high friction and wear-resistant<br>
material can be arranged in the mouths.<br>
The friction can also be increased by reducing the area<br>
of the ducts over their total length or just as one or<br>
more restrictions in the ducts. The ducts can also<br>
comprise different sections which form a small angle<br>
relatively each other.<br>
The result of a twisting operation is shown in Fig 13.<br>
As an alternative to the previously described<br>
x-etraction of the wire, shown in Fig. 6 and 12, in<br>
order to obtain a stretching of the wire around the<br>
reinforcing bars 8 to be bound together, after the feed<br>
of the wire has been stopped a pulling force can be<br>
applied to the leading end portion of the wire 12 which<br>
has been fed up into the guide duct 24 in the inner<br>
cylinder 14. This pulling force can be applied by means<br>
of two feed rollers which can be of the same kind as<br>
the feed rollers 20 and arranged in the inner cylinder<br>
14.<br>
In order to obtain a strong stretching of the wire so<br>
that it closely surrounds the reinforcing bars 8 to be<br>
twisted together the feed of the wire through the first<br>
guide duct 23 is positively locked before the pulling<br>
force is applied. This can be obtained by means of a<br>
solenoid actuated locking means arranged in the inner<br>
cylinder 14 so that it locks the wire in the first<br>
guide duct 23 in the same manner as the solenoid<br>
actuated locking means 37 of the earlier described<br>
embodiment locks the wire in the second guide duct 24.<br>
Alternatively the locking of the wire 12 can be<br>
obtained by means of locking of the feed rollers 20 or<br>
the reel 19 for rotation or in any other manner obvious<br>
to the skilled man.<br>
The above described alternative manner of stretching<br>
the wire around the bars to be twisted together results<br>
in an even less complicated machine as the reel 19 for<br>
lashing wire 12 does not have to be displaceable but<br>
just rotatable.<br>
If so required, the machine can be provided with means<br>
which, after lashing has been performed, bend down the<br>
twisted-together wire ends so as to avoid risks of<br>
injury. For this purpose, the operator can<br>
alternatively use one of the impact-resistant claws.<br>
The outer surface of this can then suitably be provided<br>
with a roller for interaction with the wire ends. In<br>
order to facilitate feed of the wire 12 into the inner<br>
cylinder 14 before a work operation, the inner and<br>
outer cylinders can be made with spring-loaded<br>
position-adjusting means which cause the inner cylinder<br>
always to return to exactly the same position relative<br>
to the outer cylinder after each completed work cycle.<br>
The invention has been described above in connection<br>
with two embodiments shown in the drawings. However, as<br>
the man of art will readily understand, these can be<br>
varied in a number of respects within the scope of the<br>
claims as far as various detailed solutions are<br>
concerned. The elastic ball of the first embodiment can<br>
for instance be replaced by an element of a different<br>
design, which can interact with the scissors-like<br>
construction or another arrangement for securing the<br>
wire in the guide ducts. It is important that the<br>
arrangement brings about the requisite retention of the<br>
wire in order to make tight lashing-together of the<br>
reinforcing bars possible but allows the necessary<br>
length of the wire to be drawn past the arrangement in<br>
order to prevent excessive tension being built up in<br>
the wire, which may, for example, lead to the wire<br>
breaking. The expert in the field can propose<br>
alternative arrangements with this function.<br>
Alternatively, this arrangement can be made in such a<br>
way that, instead of continually braking the drawing-<br>
out of the wire, it intermittently frees the wire<br>
completely for short periods of time and locks it<br>
completely during intermediate periods. Likewise, the<br>
design of the guide channel bridging the gap between<br>
the fixed claws can be varied in different respects.<br>
The work sequences described above can be performed<br>
automatically after starting by pressing-in the<br>
activating button 2 under the control of an electronic<br>
unit (not shown). The programming of this control unit<br>
can be performed by the skilled man and has therefore<br>
been omitted so as not to prolong this description<br>
unnecessarily.<br>
