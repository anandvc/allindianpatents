				<td>Method for individualizing security documents and security document<br>
This invention relates to a method for individualizing security documents<br>
and to a security document and a group of individualized security documents<br>
wherein a first printed image, which can be identical for a group of documents, is<br>
overprinted at least partly with a second printed image, which can be different for<br>
sub-groups of said group or for each document of said group.<br>
DE 29 33 436 C2 discloses for example a multilayer ID card containing an<br>
application-neutral, high security quality printed image, for example a guilloche<br>
pattern produced by steel gravure printing, on a paper substrate onto which user-<br>
related data, for example a paragraph or other individualizing data, are copied<br>
directly by an electro-photographic method to connect said data with the paper<br>
substrate undetachably and untamperably. Said substrate is then laminated with<br>
transparent cover foils to form the ID card. The method can also be used in<br>
connection with other documents, papers of value, shares, etc., requiring<br>
protection.<br>
The only possibility of forgery is unauthorized personalization of original<br>
blanks printed with the application-neutral printed image, but this can be<br>
prevented by accordingly safe storage of said blanks. Total forgery of the high<br>
security quality printed paper blanks is also impossible. The described method is<br>
therefore expedient whenever the forgery-proofness and tamper-proofness of<br>
document and data must be ensured, on the one hand, but the individual data<br>
are to be applied with relatively simple means, on the other hand.<br>
The same interest in tamper- and forgery-proofness as well as simple<br>
individualizability exists for application of individual data to passport pages and<br>
labels to be stuck to passport pages, so-called visa stickers, and in addition in<br>
connection with documents accompanying goods, customs documents,<br>
authenticity certificates in the form of stickers or tags or labels, vouchers,<br>
admission tickets, checks, shares and deeds.<br>
Data pages of passports and visa stickers are frequently<br>
provided with nonvariable prints produced by intaglio<br>
printing. For example, the header of such documents sped-<br>
fies the national emblem and the name of a country which are not overprinted since<br>
they might otherwise be at least partly concealed by the overprint. Individual and/or<br>
user-related data are therefore printed at other places using a laser printer, daisy-whee<br>
or ink jet printer for example.<br>
The problem of the present invention is to combine a high security quality printed im<br>
age common to a group of documents with an easily produced individualizing print ir<br>
especially suitable forgery-proof fashion.<br>
This problem is solved by an individualization method and by a corresponding security<br>
document having the features of the independent claims. Advantageous embodiments<br>
and developments of the invention are stated in dependent claims.<br>
Accordingly, a printed image produced by intaglio printing in conventional fashion,<br>
which is identical for a group of security documents and can be for example a guil-<br>
loche pattern, is overprinted by an individualizing printed image using a printing ink<br>
that is flowable at least at the time of printing. This has the consequence that said<br>
printing ink is repelled by the intaglio printing ink and deposited at places where no<br>
intaglio printing ink is located. The printed image produced by intaglio printing thus<br>
remains completely visible and forms fine lines within the individualizing printed im-<br>
age. The fine lines do not essentially impair the information content of the individual-<br>
izing printed image, even when the individualizing printed image is a rendition by<br>
printing technology of a photographic portrait, for example of the document owner,<br>
referred to in the following as the photograph. The individualizing printed image is<br>
merely, when viewed under the magnifying glass, interrupted by the structures pro-<br>
duced by intaglio printing, the details becoming apparent in particular only when<br>
viewed through a magnifying glass. Such superimposed structures are virtually non-<br>
tamperable.<br>
An especially suitable method for producing the individualizing printed image has<br>
proved to be an ink jet printing method with commercial black or color cartridges.<br>
This method is inexpensive and uses printing ink that is repelled by customary steel<br>
gravure printing inks. A likewise suitable method is a digital printing process devel-<br>
oped by the company, Indigo B.V./Netherlands (also referred to here as the Indigo<br>
printing process). In this method, electrically charged color particles dispersed in a<br>
liquid are applied to a substrate by means of electric fields. The Indigo process yields<br>
similarly good printing quality to offset printing, but permits continuous change of the<br>
printed motifs. Since the printed motifs can also be characters rendering individual<br>
data, this digital printing process is particularly suitable for individualizing documents.<br>
But the inventive method is fundamentally applicable to all security documents having<br>
an application-neutral printed image comprising mutually contrasting light and dark<br>
areas (i.e. in particular an intaglio image), whereby either the light or the dark areas of<br>
the printed image have a repellent effect on the printing ink of an individualizing<br>
printed image printed thereover, so that the printing ink of the individualizing printed<br>
image is deposited substantially only in the accordingly other areas. Obviously, when<br>
this inventive principle is realized by printing technology, small residues of the print-<br>
ing ink of the individualizing print can remain for example in small pores or fine<br>
grooves of the inking of the first printed image without appreciably influencing the<br>
general visual impression.<br>
Preferably, the areas where printing ink is deposited are unprinted substrate areas,<br>
since unprinted substrate areas are especially suitable for receiving printing ink, in par-<br>
ticular in the case of a paper substrate, for example a normal security paper.<br>
But it is equally possible that the substrate is a material repelling the printing ink of the<br>
individualizing printed image, for example printing ink on a plastic substrate, but that<br>
the same printing ink does in fact adhere to the areas of the application-neutral image<br>
printed with adhesive material. If the application-neutral image is printed with dark<br>
printing ink on a light substrate, this causes the application-neutral image to appear<br>
like a negative in its overprinted part.<br>
The individualizing printed image can contain one or more pieces of individualizing<br>
information, for example a continuous number (serial number), a photograph and/or<br>
personal data of the document owner in plaintext and/or the same or other data in the<br>
form of a machine-readable bar code.<br>
In the following, the invention will be explained by way of example with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. la shows a first high security quality printed image identical for a group of secu-<br>
rity documents, on a substrate;<br>
Fig. lb shows a detail of the substrate from Fig. la in cross section;<br>
Fig. 2a shows the substrate from Fig. la with a second, individualizing printed image;<br>
Fig. 2b shows the same detail of the substrate as Fig. lb with the additional individual-<br>
izing print at the time when the individualizing printed image is applied;<br>
Fig. 3a shows an enlarged representation of the first and second printed images printed<br>
one over the other, and<br>
Fig. 3b shows the same detail as Fig. 2b shortly after the second, individualizing<br>
printed image is printed.<br>
Fig. la shows schematically a document comprising substrate 3 with first print 1. Print<br>
1 is a high security quality printed image which is identical for a large number of secu-<br>
rity documents, for example identical for the pages of a passport document of a certain<br>
nation or for example for all visa stickers used for a certain nation.<br>
The embodiment of Fig. la involves a uniform basic pattern produced by intaglio<br>
printing, typically by steel gravure in the case of industrially applied methods. But it<br>
can likewise be an informative printed image, such as the portrait of a well-known per-<br>
sonality, as is known from bank notes.<br>
Intaglio printing is frequently used for protection from forgery in the production of<br>
high-quality printed products since printing plate production is very elaborate and ex-<br>
pensive and this method can produce a very characteristic printed image with tactile<br>
portions, which cannot be imitated with other printing processes. Depressions are en-<br>
graved in the printing plate as engraved areas, typically in the form of lines. For the<br>
printing operation, the engraved areas of the plate are filled with ink. Surplus ink is<br>
removed from the plate using a wiping cylinder or doctor blade, so that only the en-<br>
graved lines remain ink-filled. This wiping process thus removes all ink constituents<br>
on the plate surface. Using a counterpressure cylinder with an elastic surface, the sub-<br>
strate to be printed, normally paper, is then pressed onto the plate at high pressure. The<br>
document is thereby pressed into the engraved areas of the plate filled with pasty ink,<br>
thus coming in contact with the printing ink. When the data carrier is detached it ex-<br>
tracts printing ink from the depressions of the engraved lines. The thus achieved<br>
printed image has printed areas that vary in ink layer thickness depending on the depth<br>
of engraving. If translucent printing inks are used in intaglio printing, a light color tone<br>
is obtained when a light, in particular white, data carrier is printed with small ink layer<br>
thicknesses, and stronger, darker color tones when printing is done with thick ink layer<br>
thicknesses. In comparison with other common printing processes, intaglio printing<br>
can produce printed images with relatively great and different ink layer thicknesses.<br>
From a security point of view this offers the advantage that the resulting printed im-<br>
ages are manually tangible if accordingly deep engravings are used. If especially fine<br>
engravings are used, extremely fine and very sharp printed lines can also be realized.<br>
Fig. lb shows a detail of the document from Fig. la in cross section. The substrate is a<br>
typical security paper, optionally with watermarks. One can see that printed image 1 is<br>
composed of unprinted areas la and areas lb printed with intaglio printing ink. For<br>
printed image 1 to be able to show its optical effect, the color of printed areas lb con-<br>
trasts with the color of unprinted areas la, which is typically white if substrate 3 is not<br>
colored. Fig. lb also indicates the typical tangible structure of a paper substrate printed<br>
by intaglio, with the printing ink extracted from the engraved areas standing out on<br>
one side. The pressing of the substrate into the engraved areas of the plate by the elas-<br>
tic pressure cylinder causes printed areas lb to be pressed in a little on the accordingly<br>
opposite side of the substrate.<br>
The security document with first printed image 1 identical for a group of documents as<br>
described with respect to Figs, la, lb is then individualized by a second printed image<br>
being printed over the first printed image by the ink jet printing method, as shown in a<br>
top view in Fig. 2a and in cross section in Fig. 2b. The individualizing print reads<br>
"INKJET" in this embodiment. It can be printed with black or colored printing ink.<br>
Instead of the print "INKJET," individualizing print 2 might for example also com-<br>
prise personal individual data or a multicolor or black-and-white photograph.<br>
Fig. 2b shows the layer structure of the document from Fig. 2a at the time when sub-<br>
strate 3 is printed with individualizing printed image 2. First and second areas la, 1b<br>
of first printed image 1 are first overprinted completely using a Canon BJC7100 ink jet<br>
printer with a commercial black printing ink cartridge. Due to the repellent effect of<br>
the intaglio printing ink on the printing ink of individualizing printed image 2, the lat-<br>
ter printing ink flows laterally off the intaglio printing ink and is deposited in un-<br>
printed spaces la. This process is indicated by double arrows in Fig. 2b. The result is a<br>
distribution of material as shown in Fig. 3b, according to which the printing ink of in-<br>
dividualizing printed image 2 only colors areas la of substrate 3 that remained un-<br>
printed when first image 1 was printed by intaglio.<br>
Fig. 3a shows an enlarged top view of this effect with reference to the letter "K" of<br>
individualizing printed image 2. Printed image 1 applied by intaglio printing forms a<br>
regular background pattern here, for example in red color on a white background. In<br>
the area of the letter "K" of individualizing printed image 2 the unprinted intermediate<br>
areas of background pattern 1 are filled with black printing ink, and the red color of<br>
the background pattern which is lighter by comparison remains recognizable visually<br>
and without aids in the individualizing printed image. Such a combination of two su-<br>
perimposed printed images, one of which is also tactile, guarantees high protection<br>
from forgery since it is not reproducible by simple conventional printing methods or<br>
color copiers. It can be checked without elaborate aids even by non-experts, and unau-<br>
thorized subsequent changes and tamperings in individual printed image 2, for exam-<br>
ple by erasure or covering, are easily recognizable due to the change in printed image<br>
1 that they almost necessarily cause.<br>
