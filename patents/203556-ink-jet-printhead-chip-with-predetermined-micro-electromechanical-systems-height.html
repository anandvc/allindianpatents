				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to ink jet printing. In particular, the invention relates to an inkjei printhead chip with predetermined micro-electromechanicaJ systems height.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many different types of printing have been invented, a large number of which are presently in use. Known forms of printers have a variety of methods for marking the print media with a relevant marking media. Commonly used forms of printing include offset printing, laser printing and copying devices, dot matrix type impact printers, thermal paper printers, film recorders, themal wax printers, dye sublimation pnnters and ink jet primers both of the drop on demand and continuous flow type. Each type of printer has its own advantages and problems when considering cost, speed, quality, reliability, simplicity of construction and operation etc.<br><br><br>
Ink Jet printers themselves come in many different forms. The utilization of a continuous stream of ink in ink jet printing appears to date back to at least 1929 wherein US Patent No. 1941001 by<br><br>
US Patent 3596275 by Sweel also discloses a process of a continuous ink jet printing including the step wherein the ink jet stream is modulated by a high frequency electro-static field so as to cause drop separation.   This technique is still utilized by several manufacturers including Elmjet<br><br>
and Scitex (see also US Patent No. 3373437 by Sweet et al)<br>
Piezoelectric ink jet printers are also one form of commonly utilized ink jet printing device. Piezoelectric systems are disclosed by Kyser et. al. in US Patent No. 3946398 (1970) which utilizes a diaphragm mode of operation, by Zolten in XJS Patent 3683212 (1970) which discloses a squeeze mode of operation of a piezoelectric crystal, Stemme in US Patent No. 3747120 (1972) discloses a bend mode of piezoelectric operation, Howkins in US Patent No. 4459601 discloses a piezoelectric push mode actuation of the ink jet stream and Fischbeck in US 4584590 which discloses a shear mode type of piezoelectric transducer element.<br>
Recently, thermal ink jet printing has become an extremely popular form of ink jet printing. The ink jet printing techniques include those disclosed by Endo et al in GB 2007162 (1979) and Vaught et al in US Patent 4490728. Both the aforementioned references disclose ink jet printing techniques rely upon the acdvation of an electrothermal actuator which results in the creation of a bubble in a constricted space, such as a nozzle, which thereby causes the ejection of ink from an aperture connected to the confined space onto a relevant print media. Printing devices utilizing the electro-thermal actuator are manufactured by manufacturers such as Canon and Hewlett Packard.<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, many different types of printing technologies are available. Ideally, a printing technology should have a number of desirable attributes. These include inexpensive construction and operation, high-speed operation, safe and continuous long-term operation etc. Each technology may have its own advantages and disadvantages in the areas of cost, speed, quality, reliability, power usage, simplicity of construction operation, durability and consumables.<br>
In the parent application, USSN 09/112,767, there is disclosed a printing technology that is based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. In particular there is disclosed a printing mechanism that incorporates a MEMS device. There is also disclosed a method of fabricating such a mechanism.<br><br>
The fabrication of MEMS devices is based on integrated circuit fabrication techniques. Very generally, a sacrificial material is deposited on a wafer substrate. A functional layer is then deposited on the sacrificial material. The functional layer is patterned to form a MEMS component. The sacrificial layer is then removed to free the MEMS component.<br>
Applicant has found that topography of a MEMS chip is very important. The components are required to move- It follows that the topography must be such that sufficient clearance is provided for movement of the components. This means that such features as nozzle chambers must be deep enough to provide for functional movement of an actuator positioned in the nozzle chamber.<br>
There are, however, problems associated with deep topography. This problem is illustrated in figures A and B of the drawings. In Figure A there is shown a substrate 1 with a layer of sacrificial material 2 positioned on the substrate 1.<br>
One problem is immediately apparent. It is extremely difficult to achieve a uniform deposition on side walls 2 and a floor 3 ofthe cavity 4. The fluid dynamics of the deposition process is the primary reason for this. As a result, a portion of the sacrificial material within the cavity 4 tends to taper in to the side walls 2.<br>
Accurate etching of the sacrificial material relies on a high image focus on the layer 2. It will be appreciated that this focus could be lost in the cavity 4, due to the depth of the cavity 4. This results in poor etching within the cavity 4.<br>
Etching is carried out using a device that etches in steps. These are usually 1 micron in depth. It follows that each stepping process removes 1 micron of sacrificial material at a time. As can be seen in Figure B, once a required part ofthe layer 2 has been removed, a part is left behind in the cavity 4. This is called a stringer 5. It will be appreciated that the stringer 5 is difficult to remove and is therefore an undesirable result.<br><br>
The Applicant has conceived the present invention to provide a printhead chip that incorporates MEMS components that are spaced a predetermined distance from a wafer substrate so that sufficient ink ejection can be achieved. The predetermined distance is such that the chip topography avoids the problems described above.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED AND OTHER EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the prefcfTed embodiments of the invention, a drop on demand ink jet nozzle arrangement is provided which allows for the ejection of ink on demand by means of a thermal actuator which operaiei to eject the ink from a nozzle chamber. The nozzle chamber is formed (Erectly over an ink supply channel thereby allowing for an extremely compact form of nozzle arrangement. The extremely compact form of nozzle arrangement allows for minimal area to be taken up by a printing mechanism thereby resulting in improved economics of fabrication.<br>
Turning iniiially to Figs. 1-3, the operation of the preferred embodiment of the nozzle anangememis now described. In Fig. 1, there is illustrated a sectional view of two Inkjet nozzle arrangements 10,11 which are formed on a silicon wafer 12 which includes a series of through-wafer ink supply channels 13.<br>
Located over a portion of the wafer 12 and over the ink supply channel 13 is a thermal actuator 14, which is actuated so as to eject ink from a corresponding nozzle chamber. The actuator 14 is placed substantially over the ink supply channel 13. In the quiescent position, the ink fills the nozzle chamber and an ink meniscus 15 forms across an ink ejection port 35 of the chamber.<br>
The actuator 14 is spaced between 6 microns and 10 microns above the wafer 12-<br><br>
When ji is desired to eject a drop from the chamber, the thermaJ actuator 14 is activated by passing a current through the actuator 14. The actuation causes the actuator 14 to rapidly bend upwards as indicated in Fig. 2. The movement of the actuator 14 results in an increase in the inlc pressure around an ejection port 35 (Rgure 4) of the chamber, which in turn causes, a significant bulging of the meniscus 15 and a flow of ink out of the nozzle chamber. The actuator 14 can be constructed so as to impart sufficient momentum to the ink to cause the direct ejection of a drop.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 3, the activation of actuator 14 can be timed so as to turn the actuation current off at a predetermined point. This causes the return of the actuator 14 to its original position thereby resulting in a consequential backflow of ink in the direction of an arrow 17 into the chamber. A body of ink 18 necks and separates and continues towards output media, such as paper, for printing. The actuator 14 then returns to its quiescent position and surface tension effects result in a refilling of the nozzle chamber via the ink supply channel 13 as a consequence of surface tension effects on the meniscus 15. In time, the condition of the ink returns to that depicted in Fig. 1.<br>
In Figs. 4 and 5, there is illustrated the structure of a single nozzle arrangement 10 in more detail. Fig. 4 is a part sectional view while Hg. 5 shows a corresponding exploded perspective view.<br>
Many ink jet nozzle arrangements are formed at a time, on a selected wafer base 12 utilizing standard semi-conductor processing techniques in addition to micro-machining and micro-Fabrication process technology further details of this form of fabrication are set out in further ietail further on in this specification.<br>
\ CMOS drive circuitry layer 20 is formed on the wafer 12. The CMOS layer 20 can, in iccordance with standard techniques, include multi-level metal layers sandwiched between jxide layers and preferably at least a two level metal process is utilized. In order to reduce the lumber of necessary processing steps, the masks utilized include areas that provide for a build<br><br>
up of an aluminum barrier 21 which can be constructed from a first level 22 of aluminum and second level 23 of aluminum. Additionally, aluminum portions 24 are provided which define electrical contacts to a subsequent heater layer. The aluminum barrier 21 is important for providing an effective barrier to the possible subsequent etching of the oxide within the CMOS layer 20 when a sacrificial etchant is utilized in the construction of the nozzle arrangement 10 with the etchable material preferably being glass layers.<br>
A nitride passivation layer 26 is formed on the CMOS layer 20 to protect the lower CMOS layers from sacrificial etchants and ink erosion. Above the nitride layer 26 there is formed a gap 28 in which an air bubble forms during operation. The gap 28 can be constructed by laying down a sacrificial layer and subsequendy etching the gap 28 as will be explained hereinafter. The air gap 28 is between 6 microns and 10 microns thick.<br>
On top of the air gap 28 is constructed a polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) layer 29 which comprises a gold serpentine heater layer 30 sandwiched between two PTFE layers. The gold heater layer 30 is constructed in a serpentine form to allow it to expand on heating. The heater layer 30 and PTFE layer 29 together comprise the thermal actuator 14 of Fig. 1.<br>
The outer PTFE layer 29 has an extremely high coefficient of thermal expansion (approximately 770x10"*, or around 380 times that of silicon). The PTFE layer 29 is also nonnally highly hydrophobic which lesulls in an air bubble being forraed under the actuator in the gap 28 due to out-gassing etc- The top PTFE surface layer is treated so as to make it hydrophilic in addition to those areas around the ink supply channel 13. This can be achieved with a plasma etch in an ammonia atmosphere. The heater layer 30 is also formed within the lower portion of the PTFE layer.<br>
The heater layer 30 is connected at ends e.g. 31 to the lower CMOS drive layer 20 that contains the drive circuitry (not shown). For operation of the actuator 14, a current is passed through the gold heater element 30 that heats the bottom surface of the actuator 14. The bottom surface of actuator 14, in contact with the air bubble remains heated while any top surface heating is carried away by the exposure of the top surface of actuator 14 to the ink widiin a chamber 32.<br><br>
Hence, the bottom PTFE layer expands more rapidly resulting in a general rapid upward bending of actuator 14 (as illustrated in Fig. 2) that consequentially causes the ejection of ink ftom the ink ejection port 35.<br>
Turning off the current to the heater layer 30 can deactivate the actuator 14. This will result in a return of the actuator 14 toils rest position.<br>
On top of the actuator 14 are formed nitride side wail portions 33 and a top wall portion 34. The wall portions 33 and the top portions 34 can be formed via a dual damascene process utilizing a sacrificial layer. The top wall portion 34 is etched to define the ink ejection port 35 in addition to a series of etchant holes 36 which are of a relatively small diameter and allow for effective etching of lower sacrificial layers when utilizing a sacrificial etchant. The etchant holes 36 are made small enough such that surface tension effects restrict the possibilities of ink being ejected irom the chamber 32 via the etchant holes 36 rather than the ejection port 35.<br>
The various steps involved in the construction of an array of ink jet nozzle arrangements are explained in Figs. 6 to 15.<br>
1.	Turning initially to Fig. 6, the starting position comprises a silicon wafer 12 including a CMOS layer 20 which has nitride passivation layer 26 and which is surface finished with a chemical - mechanical planarization process.<br>
2.	The nitride layer is masked and etched as illustrated in Rg. 7 so as to define portions of the nozzle arrangement and areas for interconnection between any subsequent heater layer and a lower CMOS layer.<br>
3.	Next, a sacrificial oxide layer is deposited, masked and etched as indicated in Rg. 8 with the oxide layer being etched in those areas where a subsequent heater layer electronically contacts the lower layers.<br><br>
4.	As illustrated in Fig. 9, a ] micron layer of PTFE is deposited and first masked and etched for the heater contacts to the lower CMOS layer and then masked and etched for the heater shape.<br>
5.	Next, as illustrated in Fig. 10, the gold heater layer 30, 31 is deposited. Due to the fact that it is difficult to etch gold, the layer can be conformally deposited and subsequently portions removed utilizing chemical mechanical planarization so as to leave those portions associated with the heater element. The processing steps 4 and 5 basically comprise a dual damascene process.<br>
6.	Next, a top PTFE layer is deposited and masked and etched down to the sacrificial layer as illustrated in Fig. U so as to define the heater shape. Subsequently, the surface of the PTFE layer is plasma processed so as to make it hydrophilic. Suitable processing can exclude plasma damage in an ammonia atmosphere. Alternatively, the surface could be coated with a hydrophilic material.<br>
7.	A further sacrificial layer is then deposited and etched as illustrated in Fig. 12 so as to form the structure for the nozzle chamber. The sacrificial layer is then masked and etched in order to define a deposition area for the nozzle chamber walls.<br>
8.	As illustrated in Hg, 13, the nozzle chamber is formed by coaformally depositing three microns of nitride and etching a mask nozzle rim to a depth of otw micron for the nozzle rim (the etched depth not being overly time critical). Subsequently, a mask is utilized to etch the ink ejection port 35 in addition to the sacrificial layer etchani holes 36.<br>
9.	As illustrated in Fig. 14, the backside of the wafer is masked for the ink channels and plasma etched through the wafer. A suitable plasma etching process can include a deep anisotropic trench etching system such as that available from SDS Systems Limited (See) "Advanced Silicon Etching Using High Density Plasmas" by J.K. Bhardwaj, H. Ashraf, page 224 of Volume 2639 of the SPIE Proceedings in Micro Machining and Micro Fabrication Process Technology).<br><br>
10.       As illustrated in Fig. 15, the sacrificial layers are etched away utilizing a sacrificial etchant such as hydiochloric acid. Subsequently, the portion underneath the actuator that is around the ink channel is plasma processed through the backside of the wafer to make the panel end hydrophilic.<br>
Subsequently, the wafer can be separated into separate printheads and each printhead is bonded into an injection moulded ink supply channel and the electrical signals to the chip can be tape automated bonded (TAB) to the printhead for subsequent testing. Rg. 16 illustrates a top view of nozzle arrangement constructed on a wafer so as to provide for pagewidth multicolor output<br>
One form of detaled manufacturing process that can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps:<br>
1.	Using a double sided polished wafer, Complete drive transistors, data distribution, and liming circuits using a 0.5 micron, one poly, 2 metal CMOS process. This step is shown in Rg. 18. For clarity, these diagrams may not be to scale, and may not represent a cross section though any single plane of the nozzle. Fig. 17 is a key to representations of various materials in these manufacturing diagrams, and those of other cross-referenced ink jet configurations.<br>
2.	Deposit I micron of low stress nitride. This acts as a barrier to prevent ink diffusion through the silicon dioxide of the chip surface.<br>
3.	Deposit 3 microns of sacrificial material (e.g. polyimide).<br>
4.	Etch the sacrificial layer using Mask 1. This mask defines the actuator anchor point. This step is shown in Fig. 19.<br>
5.	Deposit 0.5 microns of PTFE.<br><br>
6.	Etch the FTFE, nitride, and CMOS passivation down to second level metal using Mask 2. This mask defines the heater vias- This step is shown in Fig. 20.<br>
7.	Deposit and pattern resist using Mask 3. This mask defines the heater.<br>
8.	Deposit 0.5 microns of gold (or other heater material witfi a low Young"s modulus) and strip the resist. Steps 7 and 8 form a lift-off process. This step is shown in Hg. 21.<br>
9.	Deposit 1.5 microns of PTFE.<br><br>
10.	Etch the PTFE down to the sacrificiaj layer using Mask 4. This mask defines the actuator and the bond pads. This step is shown in fig. 22.<br>
11.	Wafer probe. All electrical connections are complete at this point, and the chips are not yet separated.<br>
12.	Plasma process the PTFE to make the top and side surfaces of the actuator hydrophilic. This allows the nozzle chamber to fill by cillarity.<br>
13.	Deposit 10 microns of sacrificial material.<br>
14.	Etch the sacrificial material down to nitride using Mask 5. This mask defines the nozzle :;hainber. This step is shown in Rg. 23.<br>
15.	Deposit 3 microns of PECVD glass. This step is shown in Fig. 24.<br>
1.6- Etch to a depth of 1 micron using Mask 6, This mask defines a rim of the ejection port. This tep is shown in Fig. 25.<br>
7. En:h down to the sacrificial layer using Mask 7. This mask defines the ink ejection port and le sacrificial etch access holes. This step is shown in Fig. 26.<br><br>
18.	Back-etch completely throu the silicon wafer (with, for example, an ASE Advanced Silicon Etcher from Surface Technology Systems) using Mask 8. This mask defines the ink inlets fliai are ecched through the wafer. The wafer is also diced by this etch. This step is shown in Fig. 27.<br>
19.	Back-etch the CMOS oxide layers and subsequently deposited nitride layers and sacrificial layer through to PTFE using the back-etched silicon as a mask.<br>
20.	Plasma process the PTFE through the back-etched holes to make the top surface of the actuator hydrophilic. This allows the nozzle chamber to fill by capillarity, but maintains a hydrophobic surface underneath the actuatw. This hydrophobic section causes an air bubble to be trapped under the actuator when the nozzle is filled with a water-based ink. This bubble serves two purposes: to increase the efficiency of the heater by decreasing thermal conduction away from the heated side of the PTFE, and to reduce the negative pressure on the back of the actuator.<br>
21.	Etch the sacrificial material. The nozzle arrangements are cleared, the actuators freed, and the chips are separated by this etch. This step is shown in Rg. 28.<br>
22.	Mount ttie printheads in their packaging, which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels that supply the appropriate color ink to the ink inlets at the back of the wafer.<br>
23.	Connect the printheads to iheir interconnect systems. For a low profile connection with minimum disruption of airflow, TAB may be used. Wire bonding may also be used if Oie printer is to be operated with sufficient clearance to the pr.<br>
24.	Hydrophobize the front surface of the printheads.<br>
25.	Fill the completed printheads with ink and test them A filled nozzle is shown in Fig. 29.<br><br>
In Fig. 30 of the drawings, a nozzle arrangement, in accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, is designated generally by the reference numeral 110. An ink jetprinthead chip of the invention has a plurality of nozzle arrangements 110 arranged in an array 114 (Figs. 34 and 35) on a silicon substrate 116. The array 114 will be described in greater detail below.<br>
The arrangement 110 includes a silicon substrate or wafer 116 on which a thelectric layer 118 is deposited. A CMOS passivation layer 120 is deposited on the thelectric layer 118.<br>
Each nozzle arrangement 110 includes a nozzle 122 defining a nozzle opening 124, a connecting member in the form of a lever arm 126 and an actuator 128. The lever arm 126 connects the actuator 128 to the nozzle 122.<br>
As shown in greater detail in Figs. 31 to 33 of the drawings, the nozzle 122 comprises a crown portion 130 with a skirt portion 132 depending from the crown portion 130. The skirt portion 132 forms part of a peripheral wall of a nozzle chamber 134 (Figs. 31 to 33 of the drawings). The nozzle opening 124 is in fluid communication with the nozzle chamber 134. It is to be noted that the nozzle opening 124 is surrounded by a raised rim 136 that "pins" a meniscus 138 (Fig. 31) of a body of ink 140 in the nozzle chamber 134.<br>
The skirt portion 132 is positioned between 6 microns and 10 microns above the CMOS passivation layer 120.<br>
An ink inlet aperture 142 (shown most clearly in Fig. 35 of the drawing) is defined in a floor 146 of the nozzle chamber 134. The aperture 142 is in fluid communication with an ink inlet channel 148 defined through the substrate 116.<br>
A wall portion 150 bounds the aperture 142 and extends upwardly from the floor portion 146. The skirt portion 132, as indicated above, of the nozzle 122 defines a first part of a peripheral wall of the nozzle chamber 134 and the wall portion 150 defines a second part of the peripheral jvall of the nozzle chamber 134.<br><br>
The wall 150 has an inwardly directed Jip 152 at its free end that serves as a fluidic sea) that inhibits the escape of ink when the nozzle 122 is displaced, as will be described in greater detail below. It will be appreciated that, due to the viscosity of the ink 140 and the small dimensions of the spacing between the lip 152 and the skirt portion 132, the inwardly directed lip 152 and surface tension function as a seal for inhibiting the escape of ink from the nozzle chamber 134.<br>
The actuator 128 is a thermal bend actuator and is connected to an anchor 154 extending upwardly from the substrate 116 or, more particularly, from the CMOS passivation layer 120. The anchor 154 is mounted on conductive pads 156 which forni an electrical connection with the actuator 128.<br>
The actuator 128 comprises a first, active beam 158 arranged above a second, passive beam 160. In a preferred embodiment, both beams 158 and 160 are of, or include, a conductive ceramic material such as titanium nitride (TiN).<br>
Both beams 158 and 160have their first ends anchored to the anchor 154 and their opposed ends connected to the arm 126. When a current is caused to flow through the active beam 158 thermal expansion of the beam 158 results. As the passive beam 160, through which there is no current flow, does not expand at the same rate, a bending moment is created causing the ann 126 and, hence, the nozzle 122 to be displaced downwardly towards the substrate 116 as shown in Rg. 32 of the drawings- This causes an ejection of ink throu the nozzle opening 124 as shown at 162 in Fig. 32 of the drawings. When the source of heat is removed from the active beam 158, i.e. by stopping current flow, the nozzle 122 tetums to its quiescent position as shown in Fig. 33 of the drawings.<br>
When e noxzle 122 returns to its quiescent position, an ink droplet 164 is formed as a result of the breaking of an ink droplet neck as illustrated at 166 in Rg. 33 of the drawings. The ink droplet 164 then travels on to the print media such as a sheet of paper. As a result of the formation of the ink droplet 164, a "negative" meniscus is formed as shown at 168 in Fig. 33 of<br><br>
uie drawings. This "negative" meniscus 168 results in an inflow of ink 140 into Uie nozzle chamber 134 such that a new meniscus 138 (Fig, 31) is fomied in readiness for the next ink drop ejection &amp;om the nozzle an"angement 110.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 34 and 35 of the drawings, the nozzle array 114 is described in greater detail. The array 114 is for a four-color printhead. Accordingly, the array 114 includes four groups 170 of nozzle arrangements, one for each color. Each group 170 has its nozzle arrangements 110 arranged in two rows 172 and 174. One of the groups 170 is shown in greater detail in fig. 35 of the drawings.<br>
To facilitate close packing of the nozzle arrMigements 110 in the rows 172 and 174, the nozzle arrangements 110 in the TOW 174 are offset or staggered with respect to the nozzle arrangements 110 in the row 172. Also, the nozzle arrangements 110 in the row 172 are spaced apart sufficiently far from each other to enable the lever arms 126 of the nozzle arrangements 110 in the row 174 to pass between adjacent nozzles 122 of the arrangements 110 in the row 172. It is to be noted that each nozzle arrangement 110 is substantially dumbbell shaped so that the nozzles 122 in the row 172 nest between the nozzles 122 and the actuators 128 of adjacent nozzle arrangements 110 in the row 174.<br>
Further, to facilitate close packing of the nozzles 122 in the rows 172 and 174, each nozzle 122 is substantially hexagonally shaped.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, when tfie nozzles 122 are displaced towanis the substrate 116, in use, due to the nozzle opening 124 being at a slight angle with respect to the nozzle chamber 134 ink is ejected slightly off the perpendicular. It is an advantage of the arrangement shown in Egs. 34 and 35 of the drawings that the actuators 128 of the nozzle arrangements UO in the rows 172 and 174 extend in the same direction to one side of the rows 172 and 174. Hence, the ink droplets ejected from the nozzles 122 in the row 172 and Uie ink droplets ejected from the nozzles 122 in the row 174 are parallel to one another resulting in an improved print quality.<br><br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 34 of the drawings, the substrate 116 has bond pads 176 arranged thereon which provide the electrical connections, via the pads 156, to the actuators 128 of the nozzle arrangements 110. These electrical connections are formed via the CMOS layer (not shown).<br>
Referring to Fig. 36 of the drawings, a development of the invention is shown. With reference to the previous drawings, like reference numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.<br>
In this development, a nozzle guard 180 is mounted on the substrate 116 of the array 114. The nozzle guard 180 includes a body member 182 havingapluraiity of passages 184 defined therethrough. The passages 184 are in register with the nozzle openings 124 of the nozzle arrangements 110 of the array 114 such that, when ink is ejected fix)m any one of the nozzle openings 124, the ink passes through the associated passage 184 before striking the print media.<br>
The body member 182 is mounted in spaced relationship relative to the nozzle arrangements UQ by limbs or struts 186. One of the struts 186 has air inlet openings 188 defined therein.<br>
In use, when the array 114 is in operation, air is charged diroug the inlet openings 188 to be forced through the passages 184 together with ink travelling through the passages 184.<br>
The iak is not entrained in the air as the air is charged through the passages 184 at a different velocity from that of \hz ink droplets 164. For example, ths. ink droplets 164 are ejected ft"om the nozzles 122 at a velocity of approximately 3m/s. The air is charged through the passages 184 at a velocity of approximately Im/s.<br>
The purpose of the air is to maintain the passages 184 clear of foreign particles. A danger exists that these foreign particles, such as dust particles, could fall onto the nozzle arrangements 110 adversely affecting their operation. With the provision of the air inlet openings 88 in the nozzle guard 180 this problem is, to a large extent, obviated.<br><br>
The nozzle arrangements 110 are configured to define a relatively flat topography for the printhead chip. This is emphasized by the fact that the skirt portion 132 of each nozzle arrangement is between 6 microns and 10 microns from the ink passivation layer 120. The problems associated with having deep topography are set out in the Background to the Invention above. It follows that a particular advantage of the configuration of the nozzle arrangements 110 is that these problems are addressed.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 37 to 39 of the drawings, a process for manufacturing the nozzle arrangements 110 is described.<br>
Starting with the silicon substrate or wafer 116, the thelectric layer 118 is deposited on a surface of the wafer 116. The thelectric layer 118 is in the form of approximately 1.5 microns of CVD oxide. Resist is spun on to the layer 118 and the layer 118 is exposed to mask 20O and is subsequently developed.<br>
After being developed, the layer 118 is plasma etched down to the silicon layer 116. The resist is then stripped and the layer 118 is cleaned. This step defines the ink inlet aperture 142.<br>
In Fig. 37b of ihc drawings, approximately 0.8 microns of aluminum 202 is deposited on the layer I ]S. Resist is spun on and the aluminum 202 is exposed to mask 204 and developed. The aluminum 202 is plasma etched down to the oxide layer 118, the resist is stripped and the device Is cleaned. This step provides the bond pads and interconnects to the ink jet actuator 128. This interconnect is to an NMOS drive transistor and a power plane with connections made in the CMOS layer (not shown).<br>
Approximately 0.5 microns of PECVD nitride is deposited as the CMOS passivation layer 120. Resist is spun on and the layer 120 is exposed to mask 206 whereafter it is developed. After development, the nitride is plasma etched down to the aluminum layer 202 and the silicon layer 116 in the region of the inlet aperture 142. The resist is stripped and the device cleaned.<br><br>
A layer 208 of a sacrificial material is spun on to the layer 120. The layer 208 is 6 microTis of photosensitive polyimide or approximately 4 \im of high temperature resist. The layer 208 is softbaked and is then exposed to mask 210 whereafter it is developed. The layer 208 is then hardbaked at 400°C for one hour where the layer 208 is comprised of polyimide or at greater than 300°C where the layer 208 is high temperamre resist. It is to be noted in the drawings that the pattern-dependent distortion of the polyimide layer 208 caused by shrinkage is taken into account in the design of the mask 210.<br>
In the next step, shown in Rg. 37e of the drawings, a second sacrificial layer 212 is applied. The layer 212 is either 2 m of photosensitive polyimide, which is spun on, or approximately 1.3 nm of high temperature resist. The layer 212 is softbaked and exposed to mask 214, After exposure to the mask 214, the layer 212 is developed. In the case of the layer 212 being polyimide, the layer 212 is hardbaked at 400°C for approximately one hour. Where the layer 212 is resist, it is hardbaked at greater than 3000 for approximately one hour.<br>
A 0.2 micron multi-layer metal layer 216 is then deposited. Pan of this layer 216 fonns the passive beam 160 of the actuator 128.<br>
It is to be noted that at this stage, there is between 5.3 microns and 8 microns of sacrificial material forming a deposit area for the passive beam 160 of the actuattw 128.<br>
The layer 216 is formed by sputtering l.OOOA of titanium nitride (TiN) at around 300""C followed by sputtering 50A of tantalum nitride (TaN). A further 1,00OA of TiN is sputtered on followed by 50A of TaN and a further 1,00OA of TiN.<br>
Other materials that can be used instead of TiN are TiBa, MoSiz or (Ti, A1)N.<br>
The layer 216 is then exposed to mask 218, developed and plasma etched down to the layer 212 whereafter resist, applied for the layer216, is wet stripped taking care not to remove the cured layers 208 or 212.<br><br>
A third sacrificial layer 220 is applied by spinning on 4 m of photosensitive polyimide or approximately 2.6 m high temperature resist. The layer 220 is softbaked whereafter it is exposed to mask 222. The exposed layer is then developed followed by hardbaking. In the case of polyimide, the layer 220 is hardbaked at 4O0""C for approximately one hour or ai greater than SOOC where the layer 220 comprises resist.<br>
A second multi-layer metal layer 224 is applied to the layer 220. The constituents of the layer 224 are the same as the layer 216 and are splied in the same manner. It will be appreciated that both layers 216 and 224 are electrically conductive layers.<br>
The layer 224 is exposed to mask 226 and is then developed. The layer 224 is plasma etched down to the polyimide or resist layer 220 whereafter resist applied for the layer 224 is wet stripped taking care not to remove the cured layers 208, 212 or 220. It will be noted that the remaining part of the layer 224 defines the active beam 158 of the actuator 128.<br>
A fourtli sacrificial layer 228 is applied by spinning on 4 jiin of phott&gt;sensitive polyimide or approximately 2.6iim of high temperature resist. The layer 228 is softbaked, exposed to the mask 230 and is then developed to leave the island parti<ms as shown in jrg. of the drawings. remaining portions layer are hardbaked ax for approximately ane hour case polyimide or at greater than resist.></ms>
\s shown in fig. 371 of the drawing a high Young"s modulus thelectric layer 232 is deposited, rhe layer 232 is constituted by approximately Ijim of silicon nitride or aluminum oxide. The ayer 232 is deposited at a temperature below the hardbaked temperature of the sacrificial ayers 208, 212, 220, 228. The primary characteristics required for this thelectric layer 232 are high elastic modulus, chemical inertness and good adhesion to TiN.<br>
I fifth sacrificial layer 234 is applied by spinning on 2nm of photosensitive polyimide or pproximateiy 1.3(im of high temperature resist. The layer 234 is softbaked, exposed to mask<br><br>
236 and developed. The remaining portion of the layer 234 is then hardbaked at 400°C for one hour in the case of the polyimide or at greater than 300"C for the resist.<br>
The thelectric layer 232 is plasma etched down to the sacrificial layer 228 taking care not to remove any of the sacrificial layer 234.<br>
This step defines the nozzle opening 124, the lever arm 126 and the anchor 154 of the nozzle arrangement 110,<br>
A high Young"s modulus thelectric layer 238 is deposited. This layer 238 is formed by depositing 0.2m of silicon nitride or aluminum nitride at a temperature below the hardbaked temperature of the sacrificial layers 208,212, 220 and 228.<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 37p of the drawings, the layer 238 is anisotropically plasma etched to a depth of 0.35 niicrons. This etch is intended to clear the thelectric from the entire surface except the side walls of the thelectric layer 232 and the sacrificial layer 234. This step creates the nozzle rim 136 around the nozzle opening 124, which "pins" the meniscus of ink, as described above.<br>
An ultraviolet (UV) release tape 240 is applied. 4mn of resist is spun on to a rear of the silicon wafer 116. The wafer 116 is exposed to mask 242 to back etch ihe wafer 116 to define the ink inlet channel 148. The resist is then stripped firom the wafer 116.<br>
A further UV release tape (not shown) is appliedtoarearof the wafer 16 and the tape 240 is removed. The sacrificial layers 208,212, 220,228 and 234 are stripped in oxygen plasma to provide the final nozzle arrangement 110 as shown in Figs. 37r and 38r of the drawings. For ease of reference, the reference numerals illustrated in these two drawings are the same as those in Fig. 30 of the drawings to indicate the relevant parts of the nozzle arrangement 110. Figs. 40 and 41 show the operation of the nozzle arrangement 110, manufactured in accordance<br><br>
with the process described above with reference to Figs. 37 and 38, and these figures correspond to Figs. 31 to 33 of the drawings.<br>

The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.<br>
