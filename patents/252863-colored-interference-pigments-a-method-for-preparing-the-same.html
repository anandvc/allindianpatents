[Title of the Invention] The interference colored<br>
pigments having metallic luster, the preparing method of the<br>
same, and use of the same<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to novel colored<br>
interference pigments having metallic luster, the preparing<br>
method of the same, and use of the same.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
Highly anti-corrosive thin platelet-like metal pigments<br>
having high anti-corrosive and good dispersibility without<br>
damaging the original surface smoothness of thin platelet-like<br>
metal substrate such as aluminum flake etc. are well known (for<br>
example, patent document 1. The corrosion resistance for<br>
highly anti-corrosive thin platelet-like metal substrate<br>
pigments is achieved in that after treating the surface of thin<br>
platelet-like metal substrate with phosphoric acid compounds<br>
and/or boric acid compounds (the first layer) in non-aqueous<br>
system, thereafter a hydrated metal oxide is coated thereon (the<br>
second layer) by sol-gel method in non-aqueous system. Further,<br>
colored interference pigments having metallic luster are<br>
obtained by coating one or more hydrated metal oxide layers (the<br>
third layer or more) onto the outer layer of highly anti-corrosive<br>
thin platelet-like metal pigments used as a base by wet process<br>
method in aqueous system (paragraph [0034] of patent document<br>
1).<br>
However, when a hydrated iron oxide is coated directly<br>
onto such "highly anti-corrosive thin platelet-like metal<br>
pigments" as the base for aiming at a reddish color by just applying<br>
the conventional wet process method, the denseness of the<br><br>
hydrated iron oxide layer is not sufficient, and therefore it<br>
is not possible to achive colored interference pigments having<br>
metallic luster with a reddish color having high luster, high<br>
coloration, strong and improved interference color and high<br>
[0003]<br>
Further, patent document 2 discloses luster pigments based<br>
on multiplycoated platelet like metallic substrates having color<br>
flop with one layer packet comprising, (A) a first layer having<br>
lower refractive index (not greater than 1.8), (B) a second<br>
selectively absorbing layer having high refractive index (not<br>
less than 2.0), and if desired, additionally (C) a third layer<br>
different than the layer (B) underneath. The formation of<br>
multiply layer by combining the first layer (A) having lower<br>
refractive index in said luster pigments with the outer layer<br>
(B) having high refractive index, can increase the reflection<br>
at the multi-layer boundary and improve the interference color<br>
(non-patent document 1, patent document 3, patent document 4,<br>
and patent document 5). There is description of aluminium oxide<br>
or silicon dioxide as an example of the first layer (A), and<br>
is also descriptionof high refractive index materials consisting<br>
of iron (III) oxide, chromium (III) oxide, titanium (III) oxide,<br>
etc. for the second layer (B). Further, as the coating method,<br>
the CVD process and the process by wet-chemical hydrolysis of<br>
an organic metal compound in an organic solvent system are<br>
described; however, there is no description on the reaction in<br>
an aqueous system which can be easily performed (herein defined<br>
as "wet-process method") , and multiply alternate coated layers<br>
containing a selectively absorbing layer were formed directly<br>
on thin platelet-like metal particles without an intermediate<br>
binder layer, to generate the color by interference. The CVD<br>
process is not expected to achieve the homogeneity of the coating<br><br>
compared with a wet-process method.<br>
[0004]<br>
Patent document 6 discloses multi-layer coated pigments<br>
based on thin platelet-like metal produced by coating the metal<br>
pigments with the amorphous glassy layer consisting of SiO, B2O3<br>
and/or phosphate, or mixtures thereof . However, when aluminum,<br>
which can be easily oxidized, is used as thin platelet-like<br>
metal substrate, hydrogen is easily generated since the coating<br>
process is the direct reaction in aqueous system, and thereby<br>
the smoothness of the metal surface will be damaged, resulting<br>
in irregular reflection from the boundary between the metal and<br>
the "amorphous glassy" layer or losing metallic luster. Thus<br>
it is difficult to achieve the desired coloration with the<br>
lustrous interference color. Moreover, the generation of<br>
hydrogen may cause a potential hazard in practical applications.<br>
[0005]<br>
For example, patent document 7 discloses silica coated<br>
aluminum pigment which exhibits corrosion resistance forming<br>
the silica layer on the surface of aluminum pigment with<br>
silica-containing compound. The layer formed is a single layer<br>
containing phosphorous in the silica coated layer (described<br>
in paragraph [002] ) ; however, there is no description concerning<br>
the interference color having metallic luster with a reddish<br>
color by coating hydrated iron oxide on the outer layer.<br>

in a non-aqueous system.<br>
[0011]<br><br>

platelet - like metal substrate having a layer of an ant i -corrosive<br>
treatment in a non-aqueous system.<br>
The present invention also relates to the above-mentioned<br>

[Advantages of the Invention]<br>
[0015]<br>
The colored interference pigment having metallic luster<br>
of the present invention is one in which thin platelet-like metal<br>
substrate having a layer of an anti-corrosive treatment in a<br>
non-aqueous solution is coated with an intermediate binder layer<br>
consisting of hydrated tin oxide thereon to improve the adhesion<br>
and denseness of hydrated iron oxide layer formed outside thereof<br>
compared with a case having no intermediate binder layer<br>
(hydrated iron oxide layer is directly coated on thin<br>
platelet-like metal substrate having a layer of an anti-corrosive<br>
treatment), so that a reddish color with high luster and high<br>
coloration is achieved. Moreover, since thin platelet-like<br>
metal substrate having a layer of a highly anti-corrosive<br><br>
treatment is used during coatings, it is able to achieve<br>
homogeneous coatings by utilizing so-called wet-process method<br>
in which the procedure is simple and easy to operate.<br>
[Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention]<br>
[0016]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained in<br>
more detail together with the preparing method.<br>
The highly anti-corrosive thin platelet-like metal<br>
substrate used in the present invention has a layer of an<br>
anti-corrosive treatment in a non-aqueous system. The thin<br>
platelet-like metal substrates as the core of the above-mentioned<br>
highly anti-corrosive thin platelet-like metal substrates are<br>
composed of metals and metal alloys.<br>
The thin platelet-like metal substrates used in the<br>
present invention have an average particle diameter of 2 to 100<br>
µm and an average thickness of 0.02 to 5 µm, preferably an<br>
average particle diameter of 5 to 50 µm and an average thickness<br>
of 0.05 to 2µm, and more preferably, they have an average<br>
particle diameter of 5 to 30 µm and an average thickness of 0.1<br>
to 2µm. Specific examples of flakes include aluminum flakes,<br>
titanium flakes, iron flakes, bronze flakes, stainless steel<br>
flakes, aluminum bronze flakes, various aluminum alloy flakes,<br>
various titanium alloy flakes, and others. Preferred flakes<br>
include aluminum flakes, titanium flakes, stainless steel flakes,<br>
bronze flakes, etc; and, even more preferred flakes include<br>
aluminum flakes (for example, supplied by Silver Line Co. Ltd. ,<br>
Showa Aluminum Co. Ltd., Toyo Aluminum Co. Ltd., Asahi-Kasei<br>
Metals Co. Ltd., Eckart-Werke, etc.), titanium flakes, and<br>
stainless steel flakes, etc. of which there is a stable supply<br>
commercially available as the brilliant metallic pigments.<br>
[0017]<br>
Among these, thin platelet-like metal substrates<br><br>
commercially available in various states may be used, such as<br>
those substrates that have already been suspended in an organic<br>
solvent to prevent the oxidative corrosion caused by the moisture<br>
contained in the air (for example, pigment pastes suspended in<br>
mineral spirit etc.), those substrates that, for the purpose<br>
of leafing or for improving dispersibility, have been treated<br>
with different types of surface treatment agents and have been<br>
suspended in an organic solvent and those substrates on whose<br>
surface an oxidation protection film (passivation film, i.e.<br>
surface oxidized thin-film layer) has been applied beforehand.<br>
Regarding the object of the present invention, its effect is<br>
brought out particularly by metal flakes having high<br>
corrosiveness, as long as the surface is largely free from<br>
oxidation, hence the use thereof is preferred. For example,<br>
those substrates with high corrosiveness such as aluminum flakes<br>
which are available in the market at the state of suspension<br>
in an organic solvent before being handled and those substrates<br>
which have been treated with different surface treatment agents<br>
and have been suspended in an organic solvent are particularly<br>
recommended for use inthepresent invention. It is alsopossible<br>
touse thinplatelet-likemetal substrates and thinplatelet-like<br>
alloy substrates which have been subject beforehand to an<br>
anti-corrosive (passivation) treatment.<br>
[0018]<br>
The metal substrates having a layer of an anti-corrosive<br>
treatment in a non-aqueous system used in the present invention<br>
include, thin platelet-like metal substrates which are treated<br>
on their surface with phosphoric acid compounds and/or boric<br>
acid compounds, and are further coated with one or more hydrated<br>
metal oxide layers of one or more metals selected from the group<br>
consisting of silicon, aluminum, zirconium, and titanium by<br>
sol-gel method such as, for example, described in patent document<br><br>
1 (JP, A, 2003-41150). Considering their good surface<br>
smoothness, dispersibility and surface inherent metallic luster,<br>
good adhesion of the intermediate binder layer and the hydrated<br>
iron oxide layer formed further outside thereof according to<br>
the present invention, the above-mentioned anti-corrosive thin<br>
platelet-like metal substrates comprising a layer of phosphoric<br>
acid compounds and/or boric acid compounds and one or more<br>
hydrated metal oxides layer of one or more metals selected from<br>
silicon, aluminum etc. by sol-gel method are adopted.<br>
[0019]<br>
Those treatments of highly anti-corrosive thin<br>
platelet-like metal substrates with phosphoric acid compounds<br>
and/or boric acid compounds may be carried out in accordance<br>
with the description in JP, A, 2003-41150.<br>
The metals used for the hydrated metal oxides layer, which<br>
is to be successively formed, may be selected from the group<br>
consisting of silicon, aluminum, zirconium, and titanium.<br>
Among these, silicon and aluminum are preferred due to their<br>
good transparency and low index of refraction. Especially,<br>
silicon is preferred because it is easy to handle. The sol-gel<br>
method (described in JP, A, 2003-41150) among non-aqueous<br>
reactions for coating the second layer of this high<br>
anti-corrosive treatment is preferred to maintain the surface<br>
smoothness.<br>
In the description of the present specification, for<br>
example, thin platelet-like metal treated with phosphoric acid<br>
compounds and/or boric acid compounds combined with further<br>
hydrated metal oxide layer in non-aqueous system described in<br>
JP, A, 2003-41150, is defined as "thin platelet-like metal<br>
substrate having a layer of an anti-corrosive treatment in a<br>
non-aqueous system" , thereon the layer comprising hydrated tin<br>
oxide is coated as "intermediate binder layer" (first layer),<br><br>
and the hydrated iron oxide layer, which is an outer layer thereof,<br>
is coated as "the second layer." Further, the term "hydrated<br>
oxide" used in "hydrated metal oxide" generally refers to, unless<br>
otherwise stated, "oxides", "hydroxides", "hydrates of oxide" ,<br>
and "hydrated oxides" of metal, and "mixtures thereof" in the<br>
present invention. The term "oxide" in "metal oxide" is also<br>
based on the definition for "hydrated oxide". Moreover, when<br>
representing such "hydrated metal oxide" by chemical formula<br>
(which is described, for example, in an embodiment, etc.), it<br>
is conveniently represented by the form of oxide.<br>
[0020]<br>
Next, the intermediate binder layer (the first layer) for<br>
improving the adhesion and denseness of the second layer will<br>
be described.<br>
The intermediate binder layer, which is the closely<br>
followed outer layer of the above-mentioned highly<br>
anti-corrosive thin platelet-like metal substrate, can be<br>
obtained in the following way. A suitable material for the<br>
intermediate binder layer (the first layer) is hydrated tin<br>
oxide.<br>
The above-mentioned highly anti-corrosive thin<br>
platelet-like metal substrate is dispersed in water while<br>
keeping the temperature at 60 to 90 °C to be easy to control<br>
the homogeneous coated layer, and a tin salt aqueous solution<br>
and a basic aqueous solution are simultaneously added to the<br>
suspension while keeping the pH constant thereby coating the<br>
hydrated tin oxide layer (intermediate binder layer) onto the<br>
highly anti-corrosive metal substrate. The pH is preferably<br>
less than 4.7. And more preferably, the value of pH of 0.5 to<br>
3.0 may be adopted.<br>
[0021]<br>
The amount of hydrated tin oxide in the intermediate binder<br><br>
layer (the first layer) for thin platelet-like metal substrate<br>
having a layer of an anti-corrosive treatment in a non-aqueous<br>
system needs to be a sufficient amount not to cause the underlying<br>
base (the layer treated in non-aqueous system) to be exposed.<br>
That is, the amount must be over the amount to be necessary to<br>
form a monolayer. The amount of hydrated tin oxide per unit<br>
area (m2) of thin platelet-like metal substrate having the layer<br>
with anti-corrosive treatment in non-aqueous system is<br>
appropriately not less than 0.0008g as metal oxide (SnO2).<br>
Specifically, the amount of hydrated tin oxide used in<br>
the intermediate binder layer (the first layer) needs to be<br>
adjusted appropriately according to the kind, particle size and<br>
particle size distribution of thin platelet-like anti corrosive<br>
metal substrate . Considering the unit surface area of the highly<br>
anti-corrosive metal substrate, of course, the amount is<br>
decreased when the particle size is large, and it is necessary<br>
to increase the amount when the particle size is small.<br>
[0022]<br>
The amount of hydrated tin oxide is adjusted to be within<br>
the possible range in which the sufficient adhesion and the<br>
improvement of denseness of the second layer are achieved and<br>
the hue of the interference color can be controlled; thus the<br>
amount per unit area (m2) of thin platelet-like metal substrate<br>
having a layer of an anti-corrosive treatment in a non-aqueous<br>
system is preferably 0.0008g to 0.3g as metal oxide (SnO2) , more<br>
preferably 0.0009g to 0.2g, and further preferably 0.01g to 0.1g.<br>
For example, when using the highly anti-corrosive substrate<br>
(specific surface area of 3.01 m2/g (described in Table 3 of<br>
JP, A, 2003-41150)) including metal aluminum as thin<br>
platelet-like metal, the suitable amount is 0.001g to 0.06g per<br>
unit area (m2) of the highly anti-corrosive metal substrate.<br>
The aqueous solution of tin salt to be used is water-soluble<br><br>
tin(II) salt or tin(IV) salt. For example, tin(II) chloride,<br>
tin(IV) chloride, tin(II) sulfate, tin(II) acetate, tin(II)<br>
oxalate etc. are preferred.<br>
[0023]<br>
Hereinafter, the coating of hydrated iron oxide (the second<br>
layer) after forming the above-mentioned intermediate binder<br>
layer will be described. In the present invention, though the<br>
coating of hydrated iron oxide (the second layer) onto the surf ace<br>
of the intermediate binder layer (the first layer) may be<br>
performed through the vapor deposition method or sol-gel method,<br>
it is more preferable to adopt the wet process (see the description<br>
in JP, A, 2003-41150 for the definition) in which, in contrast<br>
to the vapor deposition method and so-gel method, it has no<br>
restrictions on the raw materials and production facilities and<br>
it is easy to achieve the homogeneous coated layer, and it is<br>
easy to operate a simple process with a wide range of applications .<br>
[0024]<br>
A definition of the wet- process method, as used in the<br>
present invention, has been given before, to be more specific,<br>
in an aqueous system, the method consists of (1) in the case<br>
of neutralizing hydrolysis, selecting the desired water-soluble<br>
metal salt (for example, nitrate salt, sulfate salt, chloride,<br>
acetate salt, and further metal acid salt, etc.) and the<br>
prescribed amount of aqueous solution while separately preparing<br>
an alkaline aqueous solution (an acidic aqueous solution in the<br>
case of metal acid salt), dropping these into the suspension<br>
of highly anti-corrosive thin platelet-like metal pigment<br>
which is the base obtained beforehand while maintaining a<br>
predetermined pH to form a hydrolyzed layer on the surface,<br>
thereafter washing, filtering, drying and, if desired,<br>
calcining; and (2) in the case of thermal hydrolysis, adding<br>
the predetermined amount of the desired water-soluble metal salt<br><br>
to a suspension of highly anti-corrosive thin platelet-like<br>
metal pigment which is the base obtained beforehand and by heating,<br>
forming ahydrolyzed layer and, thereafter, washing, filtering,<br>
drying and, if desired, calcining. Moreover, as a variation<br>
of the method by neutralization hydrolysis (1) , a method using,<br>
instead of the alkaline aqueous solution, urea and acetoamide<br>
producing alkalinity through heating,(the so-called<br>
"homogeneous precipitation method") can also be mentioned.<br>
[0025]<br>
The iron (III) salt to be used may be water-soluble salts<br>
such as chloride, sulfate, and nitrate. After coating the<br>
above-mentioned intermediate binder layer (the first layer),<br>
the iron salt aqueous solution is successively added while<br>
maintaining the pH constant (not higher than 4) using an alkaline<br>
aqueous solution. Specif ic examples of alkaline aqueous solution<br>
used in the present invention include aqueous alkali metal<br>
hydroxide solution such as sodium hydroxide, potassiumhydroxide<br>
etc., aqueous alkali metal carbonate solution such as sodium<br>
carbonate, potassium carbonate etc., aqueous alkali metal<br>
bicarbonate solution such as sodium bicarbonate, potassium<br>
bicarbonate etc. , ammonium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate or<br>
an aqueous ammonia solution etc. The amount of hydrated ion oxide<br>
is preferably 0.01g to 1.0g as metal oxide (Fe2O3) per unit area<br>
(m2) of thin platelet-like metal substrate having a layer of<br>
an anti-corrosive treatment in a non-aqueous system in order<br>
to achieve a reddish color and to improve its chromaticity<br>
sufficiently. Therefore, the amount may be appropriately<br>
changed depending on the hue and surface smoothness of individual<br>
thin platelet-like metal substrate, and the properties of highly<br>
anti-corrosive metal substrate obtained and treated in<br>
non-aqueous system. The temperature during this coating<br>
process is preferably the same as one during the coating of the<br><br>
above-mentioned intermediate binder layer (the first layer) in<br>
terms of efficiency. Thus the obtained suspension containing<br>
the colored thin platelet-like interference pigments having<br>
metallic luster with a reddish color are then filtered and washed,<br>
dried, and calcined.<br>
[0026]<br>
The colored interference pigments having metallic luster<br>
with a reddish color obtained according to the present invention,<br>
exhibit a reddish body color with an interference color by coating<br>
with an intermediate binder layer to improve the adhesion and<br>
denseness of the hydrated iron oxide layer (the second layer)<br>
coated thereon.<br>
[0027]<br>
By performing different types of additional surface<br>
treatments, the colored interference pigments having metallic<br>
luster with a reddish color obtained according to the present<br>
invention meet with the quality required for the applications<br>
for which these treatments are used. For example, it is possible<br>
to carry out treatments for light resistance, water resistance<br>
and weather resistance required for applications as automobile<br>
paints (for example, according to JP, A, 63-130673, JP, A,<br>
01-292067, etc.), e.g. treatments for high plane orientation<br>
properties (leafing) required e.g. in the painting and printing<br>
fields (for example, according to JP, A, 2001-106937, JP, A,<br>
11-347084), water-borne treatments for water-borne paints or<br>
inks (for example, according to JP, A, 8-283604), silicon<br>
treatment for improving dispersibility and<br>
hydrogenpolysiloxane treatment for improving hydrophobic and<br>
oleophobic properties for applications in the cosmetics field,<br>
surface treatments for weld-line prevention when used as resin<br>
(forexample, according to JP, A, 03-100068, andJP, A, 03-93862) ,<br>
and different treatments for improving dispersibility.<br><br>
[0028]<br>

(Example 1)<br>
Preparation of the colored interference pigment having metallic<br>
luster with a reddish color (Fe2O3/SnO2/ [SiO2/Al(P)])<br>
50 g of thin platelet-like metal substrate having a layer<br>
of an anti-corrosive treatment ([SiO2/Al(P) ] obtained according<br>
to example 4-b in paragraph [0061] of JP, A, 2003-41150, the<br>
specific surface area : 3.01 m2/g) are suspended in 1 liter of<br>
water. The suspension is heated to 75°C under stirring. 100g<br>
of SnCl45H2O solution with a concentration of 2 9g/l are dropped<br>
into the suspension while keeping the pH at 1.8 using 32% by<br>
weight aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (preparation of the<br>
first layer, "intermediate binder layer"). Thereafter, the pH<br>
is further adjusted to 3.0 using 32wt% sodium hydroxide . Then,<br>
1816g of FeCl3(III) aqueous solution with a concentration of<br>
3 0g/l are dropped until the desired hue of color is reached while<br>
keeping the pH at 3.0 using 32wt% sodium hydroxide (preparation<br>
of the second layer) . From the suspension, the solid parts are<br>
filtered, washed, dried, and calcined at 350°C for 30 minutes,<br>
the colored interference pigments having metallic luster with<br>
a reddish color are obtained. The amount of coated hydrated<br>
tin oxide is 0.0033g as metal oxide (SnO2) per unit surface area<br>
(m2) of thin plate-like metal substrate having a layer of an<br>
anti-corrosive treatment in a non-aqueous system. Also the<br>
obtained colored interference pigment having metallic luster<br>
with a reddish color have the specific surface area of 25.95<br>
m2/g. SEM observation confirms the existence of high dense and<br>
homogeneous coated layer of hydrated iron(III) oxide shown in<br>
Fig. 1. The amount of hydrated iron(III) oxide is about 0.18<br>
g as Fe2O3 per unit area (m2) of thin plate-like metal substrate<br>
having a layer of an anti-corrosive treatment in a non-aqueous<br>
system. Cross section by SEM observation, shown in Fig. 2,<br><br>
demonstrates clearly the existence of hydrated tin oxide layer<br>
(the intermediate binder layer) having a thickness of about 2 0<br>
nanometers.<br>
Table 1 shows L value, a value, b value, chromaticity C,<br>
and hue angle h. A colored interference pigment having metallic<br>
luster with brilliant reddish color having high chromaticity<br>
is obtained.<br>
[0042]<br>
(Comparative example 1)<br>
Preparation of a colored interference pigment having metallic<br>
luster (Fe2O3/[SiO2/Al(P)])<br>
The pigment is obtained by the same procedures as in example<br>
1 except that the process of preparation of the intermediate<br>
layer from SnCl45H2O is omitted. Only the hue of an orange color<br>
is obtained, while the reddish color is not achieved. SEM<br>
observations reveal the existence of inhomogeneous coated layer<br>
of Fe2O3 with a large amount of non-coated hydrated iron oxide<br>
particles shown in Fig. 1. It's specific surface area is 40.67<br>
m2/g.<br>
[0043]<br>
Evaluation of coloration<br>
1 weight part of the sample obtained as described in Example<br>
1 above is dispersed in 9 weight parts of acryl-modified<br>
nitrocellulose lacquer and coated on a black and white hiding<br>
test paper with an applicator (bar coater #20) . After drying,<br>
the color measurement is performed by using the<br>
goniospectrophotometer GCMS-3 (manufactured by Murakami Color<br>
Research Laboratory). The results of the color measurement is<br>
shown in Table 1.<br>
[0044]<br>
Table 1 Result of color measurement by<br>
goniospectrophotometer and specific surface area (incidence<br><br><br>
Where, chromaticity (C) represents the square root of (a*2 +b*2),<br>
and hue angle(h) represents Tan-1 (b*/a*).<br>
[0045]<br>
It is demonstrated by the above results that the colored<br>
interference pigment having metallic luster with a reddish color<br>
obtained by coating with intermediate binder layer (first layer)<br>
consisting of hydrated tin oxide according to example 1 of the<br>
present invention exhibits both high luster and high chromaticity<br>
as shown in Fig. 3, compared to the comparative example.<br>
Comparative example 1 which has no intermediate binder<br>
layer can not achieve the colored interference pigment having<br>
metallic luster with a reddish color having high chromaticity.<br>
Table 1 shows the specific surface areas of example 1 and<br>
comparative example 1. As shown in Table 1, one having the<br>
intermediate binder layer of hydrated tin oxide as the first<br>
layer has a smaller specific surface area and further hydrated<br>
iron oxide coated layer has a high density or exhibits denseness<br>
and therefore shows good adhesion.. Thus, the chromaticity of<br>
reddish color has been increased.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
Preparation of the colored interference pigment having<br>
metallic luster with a reddish color (Fe2O3/SnO2/[SiO2/Al(P)])<br>
100 g of thin platelet-like metal substrate having a layer<br>
of an anti-corrosive treatment ( [SiO2/Al (P) ] obtained according<br>
to example 4-b in paragraph [0061] of JP,A,2003-41150, the<br><br>
specific surface area: 3.01 m2/g) are suspended in 2 liter of<br>
water. The suspension is heated to 75°C under stirring. 186 ml<br>
of SnCl45H2O solution with a concentration of 50g/l are dropped<br>
into the suspension while keeping the pH at 1.8 using 20% by-<br>
weight aqueous solution of sodium carbonate (preparation of the<br>
first layer, "intermediate binder layer"). Thereafter, the pH<br>
is further adjusted to 3.0 using 20wt% sodium carbonate. Then,<br>
4540g of FeCl3(III) aqueous solution with a concentration of<br>
87.75g/l are dropped until the desired hue of color is reached<br>
while keeping the pH at 3.0 using 20wt% sodium carbonate<br>
(preparation of the second layer). From the suspension, the solid<br>
parts are filtered, washed, dried, and calcined at 350°C for<br>
30 minutes, the colored interference pigments having metallic<br>
luster with a reddish color having hue angle (h) of 32.52 are<br>
obtained. The amount of coated hydrated tin oxide is 0.0133g<br>
as metal oxide (SnO2) per unit surface area (m2) of thinplate-like<br>
metal substrate having a layer of an anti-corrosive treatment<br>
in a non-aqueous system. Also the obtained colored interference<br>
pigment having metallic luster with a reddish color having hue<br>
angle (h) of 32.52 has the specific surface area of 29.80 m2/g.<br>
SEM observation confirms the existence of high dense and<br>
homogeneous coated layer of hydrated iron (III) oxide. The amount<br>
of hydrated iron (III) oxide is about 0.76 g as Fe2O3 per unit<br>
area (m2) of thin plate-like metal substrate having a layer of<br>
an anti-corrosive treatment in a non-aqueous system.<br>
