Process for the Continuous Production of anOlefinic Oxide<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the continuous production of an olefmic oxide, for example propylene oxide, ethylene oxide and butylene oxide. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the continuous production of propylene oxide by direct oxidation of propylene with hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Olefin oxides, hereafter referred to as epoxides, are intermediates that are useful for preparing a wide variety of compounds. Thus, for example, epoxides may be used to produce glycols, condensation polymers such as polyesters, or for the preparation of intermediates that are useful in the synthesis of polyurethane foams, elastomers, sealants and the like.<br>
It is known to prepare epoxides by direct oxidation of olefinic compounds with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of suitable catalysts.<br>
The catalysts generally used are zeolite compounds in a modified form (EP 100 119) or suitably treated with a neutralizing agent whose function is to neutralize the acidic groups present on the surface of the catalyst, which may promote side reactions of degradation of the epoxide.<br>
Thus, for example, EP-A-230 949 describes an epoxidation process which uses as catalyst a titanium silicalite treated, before or during the reaction, with a neutralizing agent chosen from organosilicon derivatives of the type X-SIR3 or water-soluble substances derived from cations of groups I and II of different basic strength.<br>
EP-A- 712 852 describes a process for epoxidizing olefins in the presence of titanium silicalite which uses as neutralizing agent a non-basic salt chosen from lithium chloride, sodium nitrate, potassium sulphate and ammonium phosphate.<br>
EP-A- 940 393 describes a process for synthesizing epoxides in which the titanium silicalite used as catalyst is treated, before it Is used, with organic molecules containing a substituted amide group. Working according to the said process gives an H2O2 conversion of 90% and a selectivity towards epoxide of 91%.<br><br>
wo 00/17178 describes a process in which titanium silicalite is used in the presence of low concentrations of a tertiary amine and/or a tertiary amine oxide.<br>
Although these catalysts show good activity and selectivity when freshly prepared, they however show a gradual deactivation in the course of the epoxidation reaction, with a reduction in the yields of epoxide over time, due 'substantially to the decrease in the conversion of the hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The need for frequent removal and/or recovery and regeneration of the catalyst makes these processes difficult to use industrially. In addition, the relatively mediocre selectivity makes it necessary to recover and dispose of substantial amounts of by-products.<br>
In addition, a zeolite-based catalyst subjected to frequent thermal regeneration cycles generally tends to become degraded, in particular when alkali metals such as sodium or potassium that are still present, even in small amounts, remain absorbed on the structure, in the reaction reagents.<br>
To overcome these problems, a number of processes make use of particular reactor-based solutions or of particular operating conditions.<br>
For example, WO 99/01445 describes a process for epoxidizing propylene in the presence of titanium silicalite, in which the temperature and pressure are increased in the course of the epoxidation reaction, so as to maintain a high efficiency of the catalytic system.<br>
By working according to this process, after 85 hours, the catalyst begins to decay and needs to be separated out and regenerated.<br>
The Applicant has now found that, by using suitable operating conditions in the reaction between an olefin and hydrogen peroxide, it is possible to keep the catalytic activity stable over time, thus reducing and desirably minimizing the frequency of the regeneration cycles, and to obtain high yields of epoxides, maintaining over time a high conversion and selectivity with respect to the hydrogen peroxide and producing the epoxide with a high production efficiency and a high degree of purity.<br><br>

Olefins which may be used in the process of the present invention are those of general formula (I)<br><br><br>
in which: R1, R2, R3 and R4, which may be identical or different, may be hydrogen, an alkyl radical containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an aryl radical, an alkyiaryl radical containing from 7 to 20 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyi radical containing from 6 to 10 carbon atoms or an alkylcycloalkyl radical containing from 7 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
The radicals R1. R2, R3 and R4 may constitute pairs of saturated or unsaturated rings. In addition, the said radicals may contain halogen atoms, nitro or nitrile groups, sulphonic groups and esters thereof, carbonyl, hydroxyl, carboxylic, thiol, amine and ether groups.<br>

The preferred olefin is propylene. Generally, propylene is used in a purity of greater than 70%. Preferably, propylene is available as a steam-tracking stream in a minimum purity of 96%, the remainder comprising propane and typical C3 impurities.<br>
The oxidizing agent used in the process of the present invention suitably is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or a compound which is capable of generating H2O2 under the epoxidation conditions.<br><br>
The amount of hydrogen peroxide relative to the olefin is not critical, but it is preferable to use an olefin/H2O2 molar ratio of between 10:1 and 1:10 and preferably between 6:1 and 1:1.<br>
The epoxidation reaction may be carried out in one or more solvents that are liquid at the epoxidation temperatures, that are compatible with hydrdgen peroxide and that are capable of dissolving the olefin and the olefinic oxide produced.<br>
Typically, solvents of polar nature are used, such as: alcohols, aqueous-alcoholic mixtures, ketones, ethers, esters, aliphatic, cydoaliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of alcohols that are suitable for the process of the present invention are methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, t-butyl alcohol and cyclohexanol. Examples of ketones are acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and acetophenone. Examples of ethers are tetrahydrofuran and butyl ether.<br>
Preferably, methanol and, among the ketones, acetone are used. The methanol/water mixture with a weight ratio between the two compounds of between 10/90 and 99/1 is particularly preferred.<br>
The buffer suitably is chosen from aqueous ammonia, ammonium acetate, ammonium formate or a system comprising a nitrogenous base and a salt thereof with an organic or mineral acid, as described in Italian patent application No. Ml 99A/001658.<br>
Suitably, the buffer is fed continuously with one of the reagent flows fed into the epoxidation reactor, in an amount such as to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture, measured under the worthing conditions, at a value above 5 and preferably between 5.5 and 8.<br>
The epoxidation catalyst which may be used in the process of the present invention suitably is chosen from those generally known as titanium silicalites although other known epoxidation catalysts may be employed as desired.<br><br>
for example, the titanium silicalites MFI structure may be used, which are described in US-A-4 410 501, in which their structural properties are also reported.<br>
Titanium silicalites in which some of the titanium is replaced with other metals such as boron, aluminium, iron or gallium may also be used. These substituted titanium silicalites and the methods for preparing them are described in EP-A-226 257. EP-A-226 258 and EP-A-266 825.<br>
Titanium silicalites of MEL or intermediate MFl/MEL structure, described in Belgian patent 1 001 038, may also be used. Other titanium silicalites may be chosen from titanium-containing p-zeolites of BEA structure, described in Spanish patent 2 037 596, and zeolites ZSM-12 containing titanium and optionally aluminium, described in "Journal of Chemical Communications. 1992, page 745".<br>
A catalyst which is preferred according to the present invention is the titanium silicalite of general formula (II):<br>
XTiO2-(1-x)SiO2<br>
in which x represents a number between 0.0001 and 0.04, preferably the value of X is between 0.01 and 0.025, which are described, for example, in US-A-4 410 501. US-A-4 824 976, US-A-4 666 692, US-A-4 656 016, US-A-4 859 785 and US-A-4 937 216.<br>
The catalyst may be used in the form of powder, pallets, microspheres, an extrudate or other suitable physical forms.<br>
The use of a binder (co-gel) or of an inert support in combination with the catalyst may be advantageous. Supported catalysts may be prepared using known methods.<br>
The inert support may typically consist of silica, alumina, silica-alumina, zeolites, active charcoal and other materials that are well known in a state of the art.<br>
The amount of catalyst used in the process of the invention is not critical; however, it is chosen so as to allow the epoxidation reaction to proceed to completion in the shortest possible time.<br><br>
Generally, the amount of catalyst will be chosen as a function of various parameters, such as the reaction temperature, the reactivity and concentration of the olefin, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, the type and composition of the solvents, the catalytic activity and the type of reactor or of reaction system used.<br>
Typically, the amount of catalyst will be between 1% and 15% by weight relative to the reaction mixture and preferably between 4% and 10% by weight.<br>
The temperature used in the process of the present invention is generally between 20°C and 150°C. preferably between 40°C and 100°C and particularly preferably between 55°C and 90°C.<br>
The pressure at which the process is performed is that which allows the olefin to be maintained in the liquid phase at the chosen reaction temperature. In general, the process is performed at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure when gaseous olefins are used.<br>
The reactor used in the epoxidation reaction may be any reactor capable of operating continuously and of carrying out the reaction in a system such as the one described, achieving an efficient context between the olefin, the liquid phase and the catalyst held in suspension.<br>
Examples of reactors that are suitable for this purpose are stirred reactors, bubble reactors, gas-lift reactors with Internal or external circulation or CSTRs (Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors) or PFRs (Plug Flow Reactors), as described in the prior art.<br>
Preferably, the reactors R1-R3 are of the CSTR type and are isothermic.<br>
The olefin charge, by which is meant the fresh olefin, the recycled olefin or mixtures thereof, is fed into the reaction stage (R1-R3) at a controlled throughput and in excess to maximize the conversion end selectivity towards olefinic oxide and to maintain the reaction pressure. Preferably, the three reactors R1-R3 are fed with a mixture consisting of fresh olefin originating from the amount in storage and from a recycled olefin.<br><br>
According to one embodiment of the process of the present invention, before introducing the fresh olefin into the reactors R1-R3, it is purified in the distillation column C4.<br>
The feed of hydrogen peroxide may be divided into two portions such that the ratio of the feeds to the reactors R1 and R2 is between 90:10 and 10:90 and preferably between 60:40 and 40:60. A 50:50 ratio is particularly preferred.<br>
The reactors R1 and R2 operate under substantially identical conditions, that is to say at a temperature of about 55-75°C and at a pressure of 13 bar. while the reactor R3, which works as the finishing reactor, that is to say the reactor which depletes the hydrogen peroxide fed to the reactors R1 and R2. operates at a temperature of 70-90°C and at a pressure of 8 bar.<br>
The overall oxidation reaction of the olefin is carried out so as to have in the stream leaving the unit R3 an H2O2 concentration of less than 100 f5pm.<br>
In the first reactor, the reaction selectivity towards the hydrogen peroxide is preferably 98 mol% with a 96% conversion, in the second reactor the reaction selectivity towards the hydrogen peroxide is preferably 97.8 mol% with a 95% conversion, and in the third reactor the selectivity is preferably 80 mol% with a 95% conversion.<br>
Suitably the distillation (flash) columns operate substantially under the same operating conditions and discharge at the top streams in vapour phase comprising unreacted olefin, olefinic oxide, inert gases, for exampfe aliphatic hydrocarbons, for instance propane, and solvent vapours. At the bottom, the columns discharge streams in liquid phase of differentiated composition.<br>
Suitably the head vapours from columns C1-C3 are fed into a distillation column C4 to recover, at the top, the unreacted olefin. This olefin is preferably recycled into the synthesis of the olefinic oxide after partial removal of the inert gases. Column 04 is suitably also fed with vapours of the vent gases from the reactors R1-R3.<br><br>
The temperature at the bottom of column C4 should not exceed 80°C with residence times in the region of one minute, so as to avoid degradation of the olefinic oxide.<br>
Whereas the tailstreams from the distillation columns C1 and C2 still may contain substantial amounts of hydrogen peroxide and are therefore recycled into the synthesis of the olefinic oxide, the tailstream from column C3 is suitably substantially free of H2O2 and comprises solvent, water and reaction by-products.<br>
Suitably this stream is fed into a section for decomposition of the residual hydrogen peroxide, together with an aqueous solution of alkali metal or alkaline-earth metals hydroxides or carbonates to control the pH of the H2O2 decomposition reaction to values &gt;10 and to avoid the formation of light by-products derived from the oxidation of the solvent and from the degradation of the epoxide. For example, when the solvent used in the epoxidation reaction is methanol, these by-products are methyl formate and dimethoxymethane.<br>
Preferably, the decomposition reactors R-4A/B are fixed-bed tubular reactors arranged in series.<br>
The decomposition reaction of the hydrogen peroxide is exothermic and suitably takes place in the liquid phase at about 80°C-90X, with a residence time of between 1 and 10 minutes and preferably between 2 and 5 minutes.<br>
Examples of catalysts used In the decomposition reaction consist of group VIII metals or oxides thereof. The supports are desirably selected from those of the prior art which are mentioned above.<br>
The mixture leaving R-4A/B is preferably fed into a phase separator V-4 in which the oxygen separated by the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide is separated from the inert diluent gas, preferably nitrogen, introduced downstream of the reactor R-4B to keep the solvent/oxygen mixture released in the flash column below the lower flammability limit.<br>
Suitably, the solvent-oxygen-inert gas mixture leaving V-4 is then condensed in the two condensers in series E-421 and E-422 to recover the<br><br>
solvent, while the uncondensable materials (oxygen and inert gas with traces of solvent) are discharged.<br>
The liquid mixture leaving V-4 is preferably fed into the distillation column C6, at the top of which is recovered the solvent, which is then recycled, while from the bottom the water (reaction water and the water from the H2O2 solution) and the by-products are discarded.<br>
The heat of condensation recovered at the top of column C6 may be used to serve some or all the boiling needs present in the process. In this case, the column pressure is maintained at a value which is suitable for this<br>
purpose.<br>
Suitably a liquid stream rich in olefinic oxide is extracted from the bottom of the distillation column C4 and is conveyed to a purification section C5. Preferably, this section consists of two columns that are in series on account of the large number of plates (99) and separates out at the top residual vapours that are still present (unreacted olefin and inert gases), at the bottom a liquid stream containing solvent and olefinic oxide (recycled into the distillation column C3) and, laterally, liquid stream consisting of olefinic oxide of commercial purity. By commercial purity is meant a purity levelof at least 99,8%.<br>
The vapours extracted from the top of the purification column C5 may still contain significant amounts of olefinic oxide and suitably are recycled upstream of the distillation column C4.<br>
By working according to the process of the present invention, the catalyst suitably shows fewer signs of decay after 1000 hours than when employed in a convention process for the production of an olefin oxide and desirably shows insignificant or no signs of decay after 1000 hours and the production efficiency and reaction selectivity are high.<br>
The process for preparing olefinic oxides may be understood more cleariy with reference to the block diagrams in Figure 1, which represent an illustrative and non-limiting embodiment.<br>
With reference to Figure 1. R1, R2 and R3 represent reactors of CSTR type arranged in series, C1, C2 and C3 represent three stripping columns<br><br>
associated with the reactors R1-R3 for recovery of the olefinic oxide produced, C4 represents a distillation column for recovery and recycling of the unreacted olefin; C5 represents a distillation column for purifying the olefinic oxide; C6 represents a distillation column for recovering/recycling the reaction solvent and for discharging the water and the reaction byproducts, E represents a condenser for condensing the olefinic oxide entrained by the recycled olefin, and C represents a compressor for bringing the recycled olefin to the working pressure of the synthesis reactors.<br>
With reference to Figure 1, the olefin, for example propylene, is fed in parallel into reactors R1-R2-R3 via the lines (2H11H21). The hydrogen peroxide is fed in parallel into R1-R2 via the lines (1) and (11); the buffer is fed into the reactors R1-R2-R3 in parallel via the lines (T1)-(T2HT3), while the recycled solvent (4) is fed entirely into the reactor R1. Any losses of solvent in the production cycle are replaced by means of the "make-up" line (3).<br>
The filtered liquid reaction product leaving the first reactor R1 Is fed via the line (6) into the first distillation column C1, from the top of which is recovered the propylene oxide produced (7), in the vapour phase, and from the bottom of which is recovered a liquid stream (8) still containing hydrogen peroxide, fed into the reactor R2.<br>
The filtered liquid reaction product leaving the second reactor R2 is fed via the line (9) into the second distillation column C2, from the top of which is recovered the propylene oxide produced (12), in the vapour phase, and from the bottom of which is recovered a liquid stream (13) still containing hydrogen peroxide, which is fed into the reactor R3.<br>
The filtered liquid reaction product leaving the third reactor R3 is fed via the line (14) into the third distillation column C3, from the top of which is recovered the propylene oxide produced (16). in the vapour phase, and from the bottom of which is fed a liquid stream (15) still containing hydrogen peroxide, which is fed into the reactor R4.<br>
The basic solution (T4) is also fed into R4. The liquid reaction product leaving the reactor R4 is fed via the line (22) into the flash tank V4, the vapour phase of which is sent to two condensers in series E421-E422 via<br><br>
the line (19); the gaseous discharge from E422 into the atmosphere, containing oxygen, nitrogen and traces of methanol, is represented the line (17). The diluent nitrogen is fed into V4 via the line (AZ).<br>
The operating example given below is for purely illustrative purposes and is non-limiting.<br>
