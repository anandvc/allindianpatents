[Patent Document 1]<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-1079 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
Incidentally, in a light vehicle such as a motorcycle, it is necessary to take the environmental resistance of a reception unit corresponding to mud, dust, water, external force and so forth into consideration from the environment in assembly thereof.  In the conventional apparatus described above, the reception antenna is covered with a cover member made of a synthetic resin material.  However, there is the possibility that the reception performance may be deteriorated by an influence of the dielectric constant of the synthetic resin.  In order to prevent such deterioration of the reception performance, it is necessary to adjust the reception circuit after the antenna is covered with the cover member, which is cumbersome.<br>
[0004]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of such a circumstance as described above, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a remote control apparatus for a light vehicle wherein the environmental resistance of a reception unit can be assured while the necessity for re-adjustment is eliminated.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
[0005]<br>
In order to attain the object described above, according to the invention as set forth in claim 1, a remote control apparatus for a light vehicle wherein a reception unit for receiving a signal from a normal portable transmitter carried by a vehicle user is disposed on a light vehicle in which an accommodating box is disposed below a riding seat mounted for opening and closing movement and, when a signal received by the reception unit is a predetermined ID signal, at least starting of an engine is enabled is characterized in that the reception unit is disposed in the accommodating box or in the riding seat. [0006]<br>

[0007]<br>
According to the invention as set forth in claim 3, in addition to the configuration of the invention as set forth in claim 1, a maintenance lid for allowing maintenance relating to an engine disposed below the<br>
accommodating box to be performed is provided for opening and closing movement on a bottom wall of the accommodating box, and the reception unit is disposed in the accommodating box in such a manner as to be covered with part of the maintenance lid.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
[0008]<br>
With the invention as set forth in claim 1, since the reception unit is disposed in the accommodating box or the riding seat, the environmental resistance of the reception unit corresponding to mud, dust, water, external force and so forth can be assured while it is made unnecessary to cover the reception unit with a cover member made of a synthetic resin material.  Accordingly, while the necessity for re-adjustment of the reception unit is eliminated, also the water-proof performance can be assured.<br>
[0009]<br>
Meanwhile, with the invention as set forth in claim 2, the antenna and the reception circuit are provided on the opposite faces of the board so that the reception unit can be made compact, and the space necessary to dispose the reception unit in the accommodating box or the riding seat can be set small to the utmost.<br>
Furthermore, with the invention as set forth in claim 3, since the reception unit is covered with the maintenance lid which is opened when maintenance relating to the engine is to be performed, the reception unit can be disposed at a position suitable to perform the maintenance while interference of the reception unit with an article accommodated in the accommodating box is prevented.<br>
