				<td>MIST STERILIZATION SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to sterilization, and<br>
more particularly to sterilization employing a chemical<br>
sterilant in mist form.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It has been recognized that a mist of chemical<br>
sterilant can effectively sterilize instruments, such as<br>
medical instruments. Vapor phase sterilization systems<br>
are also known, but require additional expense and<br>
complexity to produce and accommodate the deep vacuum and<br>
elevated temperatures associated with such systems.<br>
One problem associated with delivery of a mist in a<br>
sterilization system is to adequately move the mist to<br>
fill the sterilization chamber and cover the item to be<br>
sterilized. Kodera et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4,366,125,<br>
provide the mist in extremely fine droplets to encourage<br>
its easy dispersion, and flow is enhanced with a carrier<br>
agent, namely warm air. Blidschun et al., in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,680,163, additionally encourage movement of the<br>
mist towards the device by inducing opposite electrical<br>
charges between the device and the mist. Sheiman, in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,379,616, attempt to use kinetic energy<br>
to flow the mist without a carrier. Each of these prior<br>
attempts rely upon positive pressure to push the mist<br>
into the sterilization chamber.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention improves significantly over<br>
the prior attempts to move the mist efficiently to fill a<br>
sterilization chamber and cover the surface of a device<br>
therein to be sterilized.<br>
A method of disinfecting or sterilizing an article<br>
according to the present invention comprises the steps<br>
of: placing the article into a chamber; reducing pressure<br>
in the chamber to a first pressure; introducing a mist<br>
comprising a sterilant into the chamber; and diffusing<br>
the mist through the chamber into contact with the<br>
article. The first pressure is below atmospheric<br>
pressure and above the vapor pressure of the sterilant<br>
thus enhancing diffusion of the mist throughout the<br>
chamber.<br>
The method can employ many different sterilants<br>
which might work in mist form, with one preferable<br>
sterilant comprising hydrogen peroxide, such as a<br>
solution comprising hydrogen peroxide and water.<br>
The first pressure is preferably at least 5 torr<br>
below atmospheric pressure, more preferably 15 torr below<br>
atmospheric pressure, and most preferably at least 30<br>
torr below atmospheric pressure.<br>
Preferably the article is sterilized in this<br>
procedure. Mere disinfection may suffice for many uses.<br>
Preferably, the procedure is sufficiently efficacious to<br>
sterilize a stainless steel blade with at least 106<br>
Bacillus stearothermophilus spores in less than 60<br>
minutes .<br><br>
Preferably, the chamber has an interior and the<br>
method further comprises sterilizing the interior of<br>
chamber.<br>
Preferably, residual sterilant is removed from the<br>
chamber.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
FIG. 1 discloses a sterilization container 10<br>
comprising an enclosure 12 having a lid 14 and containing<br>
an instrument 16 to be sterilized. Ports 18 allow a<br>
sterilizing mist, such as a hydrogen peroxide solution<br>
mist, to enter the enclosure 12 and contact the<br>
instrument 16. The container 10 is enclosed within a<br>
sterilization chamber 20 that comprises a pump 22 for<br>
drawing at least a partial vacuum on the chamber 20 and a<br>
source 24 liquid sterilant. A mist generating apparatus<br>
2 6 generates a mist from the sterilant and admits the<br>
mist into the chamber 20. Prior to such admission, the<br>
pump 22 draws a slight vacuum upon the chamber to induce<br>
suitable dispersion of the mist within the chamber 20.<br>
For generating a mist of hydrogen peroxide,<br>
ultrasonic mist generators are preferred as they do not<br>
tend to decompose hydrogen peroxide. Such generators are<br><br>
employed in cold humidifiers. One suitable example is<br>
described by Takahashi et al. in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,299,739, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A biological indicator 28 and chemical indicator 30<br>
are contained within a compartment 32, which is in fluid<br>
communication only through the enclosure 12, through a<br>
screen 33, to ensure adequate exposure to the sterilant<br>
mist and proper sterilization. A biological indicator<br>
indicates whether a test microorganism has been<br>
successfully killed in the sterilization process and a<br>
chemical indicator indicates the presence of, and in some<br>
instances and integrated exposure to, the sterilization<br>
media. Examples of biological and chemical indicators<br>
can be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,552,320, 5,942,438,<br>
6,218,189, and 6,436,659 each of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
As described above, prior system designers have<br>
sought more efficient means for delivering a sterilizing<br>
agent as a mist, essentially by forcing the mist into a<br>
chamber. The present invention dramatically improves<br>
over these systems by drawing the mist into the<br>
sterilization chamber 20 via a partial vacuum.<br>
Experiments were conducted with 30% peroxide mist<br>
using either a 5 torr positive pressure to push or a 5<br>
torr negative pressure to pull the mist into the chamber<br>
to determine the effect of mist uniformity on efficacy.<br>
Stainless steel blades 34 inoculated with 1.2xl06 Bacillus<br>
stearothermophilus spores were place at the corners and<br>
in the center of a chamber 36 (see FIG. 2). The results<br>
as shown in Table 1 indicate that the use of a reduced<br>
pressure to pull the mist produces better sterilization<br>
efficacy in the chamber 36 than the use of positive<br><br>
pressure to push the mist. Not all samples were<br>
sterilized after ten minutes with the use of 5 torr<br>
positive pressure to push mist into chamber 36. Most of<br>
the positive samples are located near the top of the<br>
chamber 36. In contrast, sterilization was achieved with<br>
no positive samples in 5 minutes with the use of 5 torr<br>
negative pressure to pull mist into chamber.<br>
Table 1<br>
Efficacy with 30% peroxide mist<br><br>
While a pressure of negative 5 torr was tested,<br>
other pressures, particularly lower pressures will likely<br>
enhance the results. With a sufficiently low pressure<br>
the mist will vaporize. Generally this enhances<br>
sterilization efficiency, but the pump necessary to<br>
achieve such pressure will be more complex and expensive<br><br>
than one employed solely to enhance dispersion of the<br>
mist within the container.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates an alternative sterilization<br>
system 62 employing a container 60 which comprises an<br>
enclosure 64 having a lid 66 and containing an instrument<br>
68. The container 60 is preferably formed so as to be<br>
usable in other sterilizing systems such a steam,<br>
ethylene oxide or vapor phase hydrogen peroxide, thus<br>
simplifying user inventory. Therefore it is preferably<br>
formed of a material suitable for use in steam, hydrogen<br>
peroxide and ethylene oxide sterilization process, such<br>
as a liquid crystal polymer as described by Wu in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,379,631, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Suitable polymers include polybenzoate-naphthalate;<br>
polybenzoate-terphthalate-bisphenol-isophthalate;<br>
polybenzoate-terphthalate-ethylene glycol; and<br>
polynaphthalate-amino terephthalate. A biological<br>
indicator 70 and chemical indicator 72 are provided as in<br>
the previous container.<br>
The sterilizer 62 comprises a vacuum pump 7 4 and a<br>
sterilant source and mist generator 76 which connect via<br>
an interface 78 to the container 60. The sterilizer 62<br>
has a receiving bay 80 for receiving a portion of the<br>
container 60. An interface 82 on the container 60<br>
interfaces with the interface 78 on the sterilizer 62 to<br>
place the container enclosure 64 into fluid communication<br>
with the vacuum pump 74 and mist generator 76. One or<br>
more valves 84 controls the fluid communication between<br>
the mist generator 76 and the interface 78 and also the<br>
vacuum pump 74 and the interface 78. A simple<br>
sterilization process would involve engaging the<br>
container 60 into the receiving bay 80 of the sterilizer<br>
62 and then drawing a slight vacuum on the enclosure 64<br><br>
via the vacuum pump 74. Once the vacuum is established,<br>
mist from the mist generator 76 can be admitted into the<br>
enclosure 64 and dispersed throughout. After a<br>
sufficient period of time the sterilant will effect the<br>
sterilization of the instrument 68 and the container 60<br>
can be removed from the receiving bay 80.<br>
Depending upon the form of the interface 82, the<br>
container 60 may be left under vacuum after removal from<br>
the bay 80. Different formats for the interface will be<br>
described hereinafter. A vacuum relief valve 86 is<br>
provided and when the operator opens the vacuum relief<br>
valve 86 and hears an inrush of air the operator will<br>
know that the integrity of the container 60 has not been<br>
violated since the time of the sterilization procedure.<br>
Turning also to FIGS. 4 and 5, an interface 90<br>
comprises an aperture 92 into the enclosure 64, the<br>
aperture 92 being covered by a semipermeable filter 94 to<br>
allow passage of sterilizing media yet disallow passage<br>
of potentially contaminating microorganisms. This would<br>
provide flexibility in using the container for other<br>
sterilization systems such as a steam or vapor phase<br>
chemical sterilization type systems. An O-ring or gasket<br>
96 sur: unds the aperture 92 to help ensure a pressure<br>
tight seal with the interface 78 on the sterilizer 62.<br>
To close the aperture 92 for use in a self-contained<br>
sterilization procedure, a panel 98 slides over the<br>
aperture 92 and seals against the O-ring 96, as depicted<br>
in FIG. 5. For use in the present system 62 of FIG. 3,<br>
the semipermeable filter can be replaced with a screen.<br>
When used with a screen closing the panel 98, preferably<br>
automatically, prior to disconnection from the interface<br>
78 a. is storage of sterilized instruments within the<br>
container 60.<br><br>
Turning also to FIG. 6, an alternative embodiment of<br>
an interface 100 comprises an aperture 102 surrounded by<br>
an 0-ring or gasket 104 and having a frame 106 to receive<br>
various inserts. A first insert 108 fits into the frame<br>
106 and comprises a screen 110 having holes large enough<br>
to easily pass a mist of sterilant media into the<br>
enclosure 64. A second alternative insert 112 comprises<br>
a semipermeable filter 114 for passing vapor phase<br>
sterilant media yet disallowing passage of contaminating<br>
microorganisms. A third insert 116 comprises merely a<br>
solid plate to block the aperture 102 entirely.<br>
The first insert 108 having the screen 110 would be<br>
most useful for use with a sterilizer such as the<br>
sterilizer 62 in which the sterilant media enters the<br>
container 60 as a mist and in which the instruments 68<br>
will not be stored in the container 60 after the<br>
procedure but rather will be used immediately thereafter,<br>
or where such instruments do not require complete<br>
sterility after the procedure. For instance, if the<br>
instruments 68 are dental instruments, a high level of<br>
sterilization efficiency may be desirable to kill<br>
difficult pathogens from a prior patient, but after the<br>
sterilization it would be acceptable to store the<br>
instruments in a clean environment yet not in a bacteria<br>
proof enclosure. Some means, such as insertion of a<br>
plate 116 to seal the container 60 would allow sterile<br>
storage therein.<br>
Turning also to FIGS. 7 and 8, an alternative insert<br>
120 fits into the frame 106 and is primarily useful when<br>
employing a mist form of the sterilization media in the<br>
sterilizer 62 combined with the need to store the<br>
instruments 68 in the container 60 in a sterile form<br><br>
after the sterilization process is complete. The insert<br>
120 employs a self-closing mechanism 121 which opens upon<br>
insertation of the container 60 into the sterilizer 62 to<br>
allow introduction of mist into the enclosure 64 and<br>
which closes automatically upon removal of the<br>
sterilization container 60 from the sterilizer 62 to seal<br>
the enclosure 64 from potentially contaminating<br>
microorganisms. The insert 120 comprises a body 122<br>
having a flange 124 which fits into the frame 106 and<br>
seals against the O-ring or gasket 104. An open tube 126<br>
extends outwardly from the body 122 to receive an adapter<br>
128 from the sterilizer interface 78. The body 122<br>
contains the self-closing mechanism 121. It comprises a<br>
valve member 130 biased toward a valve seat 132 on the<br>
body by a spring 134 or other biasing member. When<br>
seated on the valve seat 132 the valve member 130 seals<br>
the body 122 from the tube 126, thus effectively sealing<br>
the container aperture 102.<br>
The adapter 128 comprises a pipe 136 having a distal<br>
end 138 that abuts the valve member 130 driving it away<br>
from the valve seat 132. One or more openings 140 of<br>
some form at or near the pipe distal end 138 place the<br>
pipe 136 into fluid communication with the body 122 and<br>
thus with the enclosure 64. Seals 142 provide a tight<br>
seal between the pipe 136 and tube 126. Spring loaded<br>
members 144 engage detents 146 on the pipe 136 to hold it<br>
in place. Upon removal of the container 60 from the bay<br>
80 the pipe 136 will disengage from the valve member 130<br>
and close the self-closing mechanism 121.<br>
The mechanism of FIG. 7 relies upon the enclosure 64<br>
to be near or above ambient pressure to keep the self-<br>
closing mechanism 121 closed. With a pressure slightly<br>
above ambient, opening of the relief valve 84 (FIG. 3)<br><br>
still causes an audible air rush to alert a user to the<br>
integrity of the container's seal. The slightly positive<br>
pressure further inhibits ingress of potentially<br>
contaminating microorganisms. In such a procedure, after<br>
the mist effects sterilization of the instrument or<br>
instruments 68, the pump 74 provides sterile, filtered<br>
air to the enclosure 64 .<br>
Turning to FIGS. 9 and 10, if a vacuum is desired<br>
for storage of the container 60, an alternative insert<br>
150 may be used. It comprises a body 152 and flange 154<br>
for connection to the container 60 and a tube 156 for<br>
receiving an adapter 158 from the sterilizer 62 (not<br>
shown in FIGS. 9 and 10). The body 152 contains a valve<br>
member 160 biased toward a valve seat 162 by a biasing<br>
member 164. However, it differs from the previous<br>
embodiment in that it closes toward the container 60,<br>
such that a vacuum in the container 60 holds the valve<br>
member 160 closed. A flange 166 on the valve member 160<br>
engages a flange 168 on a pipe 170 of the adapter 158.<br>
The pipe 170 rotates to engage the flanges 166 and 168<br>
with each other and is then retracted slightly to pull<br>
the valve member 160 away from the valve seat 162. Seals<br>
172 are provided between the pipe 170 and tube 156.<br>
Spring loaded members 174 engage detents 176 on the pipe<br>
170 to hold the parts in the proper orientation. After<br>
the sterilization process the process is reversed to seat<br>
the valve member 160.<br>
While the provision of various inserts 108, 112,<br>
116, 120 and 150 provides the most flexibility, either of<br>
the inserts 120 or 150 could be integral with the<br>
container rather than removable.<br><br>
Further, to enhance its flexibility, the container<br>
60 may include multiples of the features disclosed<br>
herern. For instance, especially when configured with<br>
the inserts 120 and 150 with their self-closing feature<br>
it rs preferred to have, especially at the top and bottom<br>
of the container 60 (best seen in FIG. 3), additional<br>
filtered ports 180 which may be sealed. Such ports could<br>
be similar to the interface 90, or could have screw-on<br>
covers or other sealing mechanisms. Preferably, the<br>
filters can be replaced, as is preferable with any of the<br>
filters discussed herein. Such additional ports provide<br>
enhanced diffusion of sterilant into and out of the<br>
container 60 when used in a standard chamber 20 such as<br>
disclosed in FIG. 1. When used in the process of FIG. 3<br>
the ports 180 would be left closed.<br>
FIG. 11 discloses an alternative embodiment of a<br>
container 200, especially useful in the sterilizer 62 of<br>
FIG. 3, but offering enhanced flow through the container<br>
200. It comprises an enclosure 202 having a lid 204,<br>
provision for a biological indicator 206 and chemical<br>
indicator 208 and an optimal sealable filtered port 210<br>
in the lid 204. The port 210, and perhaps addition ports<br>
in the bottom or other surfaces, allow the container to<br>
also function in traditional steam and chemical vapor<br>
sterilization systems. An inlet/exit port 212 has an<br>
opening 214 for receiving a probe 216 from the sterilizer<br>
60. A normally closed spring loaded valve 218 opens when<br>
the probe 216 is inserted into the opening 214 and abuts<br>
the valve 218. A solid partition 220 separates the<br>
enclosure 202 into an upper portion 222 and lower portion<br>
224. A screened aperture 226 in the partition, away from<br>
the port 212, connects the upper and lower portions 222<br>
and 224. The opening 214 is partitioned into an upper<br>
path 228 and lower path 230. A screened partition 232<br><br>
separates the upper portion 222 from the upper path 228<br>
and the lower path 230 communicates with the lower<br>
portion 224. The probe 216 is preferably similarly<br>
separated into an upper path 234 adapted to communicate<br>
with the opening upper path 228 and a lower path 236<br>
adapted to communicate with the port lower path 230.<br>
When the probe 216 enters the opening 214 it opens<br>
the valve 218. The vacuum pump 74 draws a partial vacuum<br>
on the container 200 and then sterilizing mists flow in<br>
from the probe upper path 234 into the opening upper path<br>
228 and into the enclosure upper portion 222. The mist<br>
can later exit the enclosure 202 by flowing through the<br>
aperture 226 into the enclosure lower portion 224 and out<br>
through the opening and probe lower paths 230 and 236<br>
under the draw of the vacuum pump 74. After the probe<br>
216 is removed, the spring loaded valve 218 closes and<br>
seals the enclosure 202. Instruments for sterilization,<br>
which were placed into the upper portion 222 through the<br>
lid 204, and are now sterile.<br>
FIG. 12 illustrates a similar container 240<br>
comprising an enclosure 242 having a lid 244, a filtered<br>
port 246 and provisions for a biological indicator 248<br>
and chemical indicator 250. The enclosure 242 is<br>
separated into an upper portion 252 and lower portion 254<br>
by a solid partition 256 having a screened aperture 258.<br>
The container 240 has an inlet port 260 into the upper<br>
portion 252, with a spring-loaded valve 262 and an exit<br>
port 264 from the lower portion 254, also with a spring-<br>
loaded valve 266. The inlet port 260 receives an inlet<br>
probe 268 and the exit port 264 receives an exit probe<br>
270. A screen 272 separates the inlet port 260 from the<br>
upper portion 252. Mists flow from the inlet probe 268<br><br>
into the enclosure upper portion 252 and exit from the<br>
exit probe 270 as in the previous embodiment.<br>
The flow could be continuous, in which case it would<br>
be desirable to continually recirculate the same<br>
sterilant through the enclosure 242. Alternatively, the<br>
exit probe 270 can be used to lower the pressure in the<br>
enclosure 242 to and then the inlet probe 268 can supply<br>
sterilant mist such as hydrogen peroxide mist to the<br>
enclosure 242. After a sufficient time to effect<br>
sterilization, the exit probe 270 can draw out the<br>
sterilant.<br>
One of skill in the art will recognize that the<br>
location of the ports 260 and 264 can be changed to<br>
address other functional needs while keeping with the<br>
concept of flowing gases more efficiently through the<br>
container 240. For instance, they could be located on<br>
the bottom of the container with suitable partitioning<br>
within the enclosure 242 to route incoming gases to the<br>
enclosure upper portion 252. Rather than have spring-<br>
loaded valve 262 and 266 which move directly away from<br>
the incoming probes 268 and 270, spring-loaded flap<br>
valves (not shown) which rotate away from the incoming<br>
probe could be substituted therefor and would not tend to<br>
push the probe out after its insertion.<br>
To remove residual sterilant, especially hydrogen<br>
peroxide, it may be advisable to circulate warm dry air<br>
through any of the containers disclosed above, to draw a<br>
vacuum with the vacuum pump or to induce a plasma such as<br>
in the Jacobs et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,643,876,<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
While the invention has been particularly described<br>
in connection with specific embodiments thereof, it is to<br>
be understood that this is by way of illustration and not<br>
of limitation, and that the scope of the appended claims<br>
should be construed as broadly as the prior art will<br>
permit.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
placing the article into a chamber;<br>
reducing pressure in the chamber to a first pressure;<br>
introducing a mist comprising a sterilant into the chamber;<br>
diffusing the mist through the chamber into contact with the article;<br>
and<br>
wherein the first pressure is below atmospheric pressure and above the<br>
vapor pressure of the sterilant whereby to enhance diffusion of the mist<br>
throughout the chamber.<br>
2.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the sterilant comprises<br>
hydrogen peroxide.<br>
3.	A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein the mist comprises a solution<br>
comprising hydrogen peroxide and water.<br>
4.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the first pressure is 5 torr below<br>
atmospheric pressure.<br>
5.	A method as claimed in claim 4 wherein the first pressure is 15 torr<br>
below atmospheric pressure.<br>
6.	A method as claimed in claim 4 wherein the first pressure is 30 torr<br>
below atmospheric pressure.<br><br>
7.	A method as claimed in claim 1 further comprising sterilizing the article.<br>
8.	A method as claimed in claim 7 sufficiently efficacious to sterilize a<br>
stainless steel blade with 106 Bacillus stearothermophilus spores in less than<br>
60 minutes.<br>
9.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the chamber has an interior and<br>
the method further comprising sterilizing the interior of chamber.<br>
10.	A method as claimed in claim 1 further comprising removing residual<br>
sterilant from the chamber.<br><br>
A method of disinfecting or sterilizing an article comprising the steps of:<br>
placing the article into a chamber; reducing pressure in the chamber to a first<br>
pressure; introducing a mist comprising a sterilant into the chamber; diffusing<br>
the mist through the chamber into contact with the article; and wherein the first<br>
pressure is below atmospheric pressure and above the vapor pressure of the<br>
sterilant whereby to enhance diffusion of the mist throughout the chamber.</td>
