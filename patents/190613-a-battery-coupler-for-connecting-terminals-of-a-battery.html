				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a battery coupler with fuses.<br>
Some motorcycles are provided with a coupler for electrical connection connected to the terminals of a battery, and some couplers are provided with a plurality of fuses including a main fuse and load limiting fuses.<br>
A motorcycle or the like is provided with spare fuses in addition to the aforesaid plurality of fuses, and a coupler provided with the spare fuses has been proposed. [Problem: to be Solved by the Invention}<br>
In the conventional coupler, the plurality of .fuses, are-, arranged along the width, i.e., along the shorter side, of the coupler.  Therefore, the width of the coupler is greater than that of the battery.  The coupler having such a large width is disadvantageous in laying out parts on a vehicle having a small body by nature, such as a motorcycle. [Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To solve such a problem, the present invention provides a battery coupler to be connected to the terminals of a battery and integrally provided with fuses including spare fuses, characterized in that the plurality of fuses other . than the spare fuses are arranged along the direction.of arrangement of the battery terminals, and the spare fuses are disposed perpendicularly to the direction along which the plurality of fuses other than the spare fuses are arranged, in a plane'substantially the same as a plane including the plurality of fuses other than the spare fuses. [Function]<br>
Since the plurality of fuses are arranged on the coupler along the direction of arrangement of the terminals of the battery, and the spare fuses are disposed on the<br>
coupler perpendicularly to the direction of arrangement of the plurality of fuses in a place substantially the same as the plane including the plurality of fuses, a comparatively large number of fuses can be efficiently arranged on the coupler and hence the width of the coupler is smaller than that of a corresponding conventional coupler.<br>
Thus according to the present invention, there is provided a battery coupler for connecting the terminals of a battery comprising a plurality of fuses integrated therewith including spare fuses characterised in that said fuses other than the spare fuses are provided along the direction of the battery terminals, and said spare fuses are disposed perpendicularly to the direction along which said plurality of fuses other than spare fuses are provided in the same plane as a plane including said plurality of fuses other than the spare fuses.<br>
[Embodiments]<br>
A battery coupler in a preferred embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>

Fig. 9 is a circuit diagram of an electric system of the midget motorcycle.<br>
When a combination switch 61 is placed in an ON position, power is supplied from the positive terminal (+) of the battery 20 through, the main fuse 27 and the fuse. 28 for an ignition system, to an.ignition controller. (DC-GDI) 62, and through the load limiting fuse 29 to loads.  When a start switch 66 is closed in a state where a front wheel stop switch 63 or a rear wheel stop switch 64 is closed to light a stop indicator lamp 65, and the motorcycle is stopped, a. start relay 67 is actuated to supply power to a starter motor '68.  The starter motor 68 drives the crankshaft of the engine, not shown, and an ac generator (ACG) 69 for rotation, and then a pulse generator 70 sends an ignition timing signal indicating the angular position of the<br>
crankshaft to the ignition controller 62.  The ignition controller-62 interrupts the current flowing through the primary winding of an ignition coil 71 in synchronism with the ignition timing signal generated by the pulse .generator 70 to generate a high voltage in the secondary winding, of the ignition coil 71 to make a spark plug 72 generate a spark.<br>
The output power of the ACG 69 is rectified and the voltage of the same is stabilized by a regulator/rectifier, the stabilized power is supplied through the main fuse 27 to the battery 20 to charge the same, and is supplied to the loads through the combination switch 61 and the load limiting fuse 29.<br>
The loads include a horn 75 connected through a horn switch 74 to the power circuit, a light-emitting diode 77 for an oil indicator/ to be turned on when.an oil level switch 76 is .closed, a fuel gage 78, a turn indicator unit 79, a tail lamp 80 and instrument illuminating lamps 81 and 82.<br>
The output power of the ACG 69 is supplied to the low-beam lamp 84 and the high-beam lamp 85, which are selectively turned on by operating a beam switch 83, of a headlight, and a high-beam indicating lamp 86.<br>
Although power is supplied to the ignition controller 62 through the fuse 28 for the ignition system in this<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A battery coupler for connecting the terminals of a battery comprising a<br>
plurality of fuses integrated therewith including spare fuses characterised in<br>
that said fuses other than the spare fuses are provided along the direction of<br>
the battery terminals, and said spare fuses are disposed perpendicularly to the<br>
direction along which said plurality of fuses other than spare fuses are provided<br>
in the same plane as a plane including said plurality of fuses other than the<br>
spare fuses.<br>
