are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants above and below the ground, such as<br>
shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems,<br>
flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested<br>
material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes,<br>
offshoots and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds is<br>
carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the surroundings, environment or storage<br>
space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation,<br>
fogging, scattering, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of<br>
seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds; according to the present invention, can :be converted into the customary<br>
formulation forms, when they are used as insecticides. As formulation forms there can be mentioned,<br>
for example, solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, water dispersible granules, suspensions,<br>
powders, foams, pastes, tablets, granules, aerosols, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with<br>
active compound, microcapsules, seed coating agents, formulations used with burning equipment (as<br>
burning equipment, for example, fumigation and smoking cartridges, cans, coils, etc.), ULV [cold<br>
mist, warm mist], etc.<br>
These formulations can be produced according to per se known methods, for example, by mixing the<br>
active compounds with extenders, namely liquid diluents or carriers; liquefied gas diluents or carriers;<br>
solid diluents or carriers, and optionally with surface-active agents, namely emulsifiers and/or<br>
dispersants and/or foam-forming agents.<br>
In case that water is used as extender, for example, organic solvents can also be used as auxiliary<br>
solvents.<br>
As liquid diluents or carriers there can be mentioned, for example, aromatic hydrocarbons (for<br>
example, xylene, toluene, alkylnaphthalene, etc.), chlorinated aromatic or chlorinated aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons (for example, chlorobenzenes, ethylene chlorides, methylene chloride, etc.), aliphatic<br>
hydroparbons [for example, cyclohexane etc. or paraffins (for example, mineral oil fractions etc.)],<br>
alcohols (for example, butanol, glycols and their ethers, esters, etc.), ketones (for example, acetone,<br>
methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, etc.), strongly polar solvents (for<br>
example,-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, etc.), and water.<br>
Liquefied gas diluents or carriers are substances that are gases at normal temperature and pressure<br>
and there can be mentioned, for example, aerosol propellants such as butane, propane, nitrogen gas,<br>
carbon dioxide, halogenated hydrocarbons. .<br>
As solid diluents there can be mentioned, for example, ground natural minerals (for example, kaolin,<br>
clay, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite, diatomaceous earth, etc.), ground synthetic<br>
minerals (for example, highly dispersed silicic acid, alumina, silicates, etc.).<br>
As solid carriers for granules there can be mentioned, for example, crushed and fractionated rocks<br>
(for example, calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, dolomite, etc.), synthetic granules of inorganic or<br>
organic meals, particles of organic materials (for example, saw dust, coconut shells, maize cobs,<br>
tobacco stalks, etc.), etc.<br>
As-emulsifiers "and/or Tfoam-forming agents, there can be mentioned, for example, nonionic and<br>
anionic emulsifiers [for example, polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty acid<br>
alcohol ethers (for example, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers), alkylsulfonates, alkylsulfates, arylsulfonates,<br>
etc.], albumin hydrolysis products, etc.<br>
30<br>
Jjl^persants include, for example., lignin sulfite waste liquor and methyl cellulose.<br>
Tackifiers can also be used in formulations (powders, granules, emulsifiable concentrates). As said<br>
tacldflers, there can be mentioned, for example, carboxymethyl cellulose, natural or synthetic<br>
polymers (for example, gum Arabic, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, etc.).<br>
Colorants can also be.used. As said colorants there can be mentioned, for example, inorganic<br>
pigments (for example, iron oxide, titanium oxide, Prussian Blue, etc,), organic dyestuffs such, as<br>
alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs or metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and further trace nutrients such as<br>
salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
Said formulations can contain the aforementioned active component of the amount in the range of<br>
generally 0.1-95% by weight, preferably 0.5-90% by weight.<br>
The active compounds of the formula (I) of the present invention can exist also as a mixed agent with<br>
other' active compounds, for example, insecticides, poisonous baits, bactericides, miticides,<br>
nematicides, fungicides, growth regulators or herbicides in the form of their commercially useful<br>
formulations and in the application forms prepared from such formulations. Here, as the<br>
above-mentioned insecticides, there can be mentioned, for example, organophosphorous agents,<br>
carbamate agents, carboxylate type chemicals, chlorinated hydrocarbon type chemicals, insecticidal<br>
substances produced by microorganisms, etc. .<br>
Further, the active compounds of the formula (I) of the present invention can exist also as a mixed<br>
agent with a synergist, and such formulations and application forms can be mentioned as<br>
commercially useful. Said synergist itself must not be active, but is a compound that enhances the<br>
action of the active compound.<br>

When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be<br>
present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these<br>
formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents. Synergistic agents are compounds, which increase<br>
%•. action of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be<br>
active itself.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be<br>
present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these<br>
formulations, as a mixture with inhibitors which reduce degradation of the active compound after use<br>

The content of the active compounds of the formula (T) of the present invention in a commercially<br>
useful application form can be varied in a wide range.<br>
The concentration of the active compounds of the formula (!) of the present invention at the time of<br>
actual usage can be, for example, in the range of 0.0000001-100% by weight, preferably 0.00001-1%<br>
byweight. .<br>
The pompounds of the formula (I) of the present invention can be applied by usual methods suitable<br>
to the application forms.<br>
In case of application against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compounds of the<br>
present invention have a good stability against alkali on limed .substrates and further show an<br>
excellent residual effectiveness on wood and soil.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In<br>
a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional<br>
biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a<br>
further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if<br>
appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms),, and parts<br>
thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or<br>
in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants<br>
having certain properties ("traits") which have been obtained ;by conventional breeding, by<br>
mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. These can be cultivars, bio- or genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate,<br>
vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive<br>
("syneigistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity<br>
jpctrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to<br>
the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased<br>
tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier<br>
harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional<br>
value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products<br>
are possible which exceed the effects which were-actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferably<br>
to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received<br>
genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful traits to these plants. Examples of<br>
such trails are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance<br>
to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting,<br>
accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the<br>
harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and<br>
particularly emphasized examples of such traits are a better defence of the plants against animal and<br>
microbialpests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also<br>
increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic<br>
plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya<br>
beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus<br>
fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and<br>
oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects,'<br>
arachnids, nematodes and worms by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants<br>
by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CryIA(a), CryIA(b),<br>
CryIA(c), CryllA, CrylUA, CryHIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, CrySBb and CryEF and also combinations<br>
thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants")- Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the<br>
increased defence of the plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance<br>
(SAR), systemin, phytoalexius, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins<br>
and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants<br>
to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or<br>
phosphinotricin (for example the 'TAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question<br>
can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants"<br>
which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties<br>
which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize,-cotton, .soya .beans),<br>
KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn®<br>
(cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are<br>
maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya'bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup<br>
Ready© (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton., soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to<br>
p|«sphinotricinj for example oilseed rape), IMT® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to<br>
sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner<br>
for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield®<br>
(for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits<br>
or genetic traits still to be developed, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with<br>
the compounds of the general formula I and/or the active compound mixtures according to the<br>
invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the<br>
treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds<br>
or mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
Then the present invention will be described more specifically by examples. The present invention,<br>
however, should not be restricted only to them in any way.<br>
