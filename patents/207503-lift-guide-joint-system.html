				<td>LIFT GUIDE JOINT SYSTEM<br>
The present invention relates to a lift guide joint system.<br>
Lift guides require higher and higher quality coefficients each day due to the increase in speed of the lifts and due to the comfort demands of the users.<br>
On the other hand, and even in the event that a high quality is achieved in the manufacture of the guides, the assembly problem still exists, as this requires measurements, regulation and adjustments of the joints of the different guide lengths, which must be done in the place where the lift is going to be located and by qualified personnel that do not belong to the manufacturer of the guides.<br>
It is obvious that any improvement in the simplification of the assembly will represent a great advance in this technological field.<br>
A traditional guide comprises blade-head and wings-base, each piece of guide being jointed to the next one by grooving and tonguing.<br>
The applicant considers that one of the main causes of these problems is the grooving and tonguing currently used to join the different lengths of the guides, so it is not used in the invention.<br>
In patent US-4079817 the guide joint system uses a plate screwed to the lower surface of the two lengths of guide to be joined together. An additional control is required to align the two lengths of the guides and the alignment is only carried out on one axis, such as. the OX-axis.<br>
The system targeted by the invention is based on using a joint-anchorage plate on each side of the guides and on each connection, and which are anchored (screwed) to the wings, preferably above them.<br>
With the system targeted by the invention, an additional control of the alignment is not necessary because by tightening the screws of the plate, the two guides to be jointed together are simultaneously and perfectly aligned on both OX and OY axes.<br>
 -2-<br>
The   guides   do   not   require machining   tongue and groove (grooving and<br>
tonguing joint) or planing of the base. Advantages of the system:<br>
- The guides are the same on both sides and do not have tongues and grooves.<br>
- The tongue do not have to be spliced with the groove with the subsequent<br>
time saving.<br>
- The guides are automatically aligned when the screws are tightened, which<br>
saves a lot of time.<br>
- The gaps in the joints are much less as it only affects the thickness of the<br>
head so the joint quality is much higher.<br>
- Only one wrench is required to tighten the screws (as a system is used which<br>
avoids turning the screw).<br>
- It is not necessary to control the roller path because the joint is guaranteed by<br>
the assembly system on not having adjustments (time saving and no need for specialized<br>
personnel).<br>
- The plate weighs less as it is in two parts, so it is better to handle.<br>
- The plate joint is rigid with respect to both OX and OY axes, without the:<br>
possibility of the guides moving on the plate.<br>
For a better understanding of the present invention, a preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, subject to accessory changes that take nothing away from its foundation.<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the current already known guide.<br>

Figure 6b is a side view of figure 6a.<br>
Below an example of a non-limiting practical execution of this invention is described.<br>
Figure 1 shows a lift guide (1) already known with its groove;!(2) combined with the tongue (2) of the next guide that it must be joined to.<br>
This type of guide (1) is comprised of a blade-head (3) and wings (4)with divergent upper surface (5) and lower surface (6).<br>
In order for,the lift to correctly slide on these guides (1) already known, the following conditions must be satisfied for a good alignment on the OX and OY axes of the guides:<br>
The upper surface (7) of the head (3) must be strictly parallel to the lower surface (6) of the wings (4), which involves two independent machining operations, the upper surface (7) of the head (3) normally being brushed and the Tower surface (6) of the wings (4) planed.<br>
- Minimum play in the grooving and tonguing of the combined groove (2) and tongue.<br>
 - To join the guides (1) together a plate is used (not illustrated),<br>
screwed to the lower surfaces (6) of the wings (4) of both guides (1), which means<br>
that the play between the relative screws and holes (8) must be thoroughly controlled.<br>
- Assembly of the guides with the relative adjustment/alignment<br>
means to be handled "in situ" at the installer's discretion (the operator does not<br>
usually come from the guide manufacturer).<br>
In the system targeted by the invention the grooving and tonguing joint and planing is no longer used.<br>
Two guides (1) are seen in Figure 2a, butt-joined by means of two equal joint-bridge plates (9), one on each side.<br>
A joint-bridge plate (9) is comprised of a central body (91), which is partially placed on the upper surface (5) of the wings (4) of the two guides (1) to be spliced, and which extends along one edge with an upper flap (92) in contact with the head (3) and on the other edge with a lower flap (93).<br>
Preferably the upper and lower flaps (92), (93) form obtuse angles (a1) (a2) with the central body (91) (figure 4b).<br>
In this first practical execution the lower flap (93) extends below the wings (4) of the guides (1).<br>
The joint-bridge plates (9) are secured to the guides (1) with tightening screws (10) arranged on the central body (91).<br>
In this first practical execution, when the screws (10) (figure 2c) and anchorage nut (14) are tightened, the support area between plate (9) and guides (1) is the lower surface (6) of the wings, with the extension (94) of the lower flap (93).<br>
In the case of figure 2 the grip is due to the nut (14) without the head of the screw (10) pressing against the joint-bridge plate (9) as seen in sectioned figure 2c.<br>
In the rest of the practical executions illustrated it is the screw head (10) that exercises pressure on the joint-bridge plate (9).<br>
When the screws (10) are tightened, this gives rise to a side thrust force of the upper flap (92) against the head (3) so that the heads (3) of the two guides<br>
 6<br>
(1) to be joined together are centred, as a result minimising the gap between them and aligning both guides (1) on the OY axis.<br>
In the third and fourth executions (figures 4 and 5) the joint-bridge plate (9) presents a central body (9|) and similar upper (92) and lower (93) flaps that are preferably parallel.<br>
In the manufacturing process the upper surface.(.5) of the wings (cuts (12) as a support area for the central body (91) ) and the upper surface (7) of the head (3) are machined at the same time thus managing to align both guides on the OX-axis, the gap in that direction being minimum.<br>
By tightening screws (10) the thrust force of the upper flap (92), already explained, on the head (3), gives rise to the OY alignment.<br>
In this case, applicable to other practical executions, the relative openings and heads of screw are non-rotating, for example square.<br>
In the variant of figure 5 the head of tightening screw (10) is a side moving cam.<br>
In the second practical execution, figure 3, the tightening screws (1) are non-rotating as in the variant of figure 4, but the support area of the joint-bridge plate (9) on the guide (1) is carried out on a bevelling (13) carried out on the upper edge of the wings (4).<br>
In figures 6a, 6b, it can be seen that the joint-bridge plate (9) has a longitudinal protuberance (p), which is located in a combined channel ® executed in the wings (4) of the guide (1).<br>
In the figures, the channel (r) appears with a wedge shape and on the upper surface (5) of the wings, but it can be placed in any part of the wings and may have any shape whatsoever, the shape and location of the protuberance (p) resulting, therefore, from the plate (9).<br>
In all the executions.explained, the "in situ" installer just has to place the two joint-bridge plates (9) of each joint (one on each.side of each joint), tighten the screws and the running path is left without having to make readjustments,<br>
 settings or measurements, like a continuous guide, perfectly aligned according to the OX and OY axes.<br>
