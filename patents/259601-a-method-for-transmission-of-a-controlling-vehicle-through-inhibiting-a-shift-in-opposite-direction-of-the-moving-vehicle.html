FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains generally to a vehicle transmission control method<br>
enabling a smooth forward or reverse shifting event, particularly to a method for<br>
inhibiting an immediate shifting event or gear shift when an operator of a vehicle<br>
requests a shifting event in a direction opposite the vehicle's direction of travel, and<br>
more particularly to a method for transmission of a controlling vehicle through inhibiting<br>
a shift in opposite a shift in opposite direction of the moving vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Vehicle transmissions include various gear positions or settings, commonly denoted as<br>
PRNDL for park, reverse, neutral, drive, and low drive, respectively. The PRNDL settings<br>
are selectable by a vehicle operator by moving a shift lever or other shift mechanism to<br>
thereby command or initiate a shift request. When shifting into reverse, for example,<br>
conventional or mechanically geared vehicle transmissions generally require moving or<br>
shifting a gear arrangement into a particular configuration suitable only for the reverse<br>
operation, i.e. vehicle propulsion in the rearward direction. With such conventional<br>
transmissions, the engine, which rotates or spins in only one direction, must provide<br>
rotational force or torque to propel the vehicle in both forward and reverse operating<br>
directions. Thus, reverse gearing must be configured to alter the direction of engine<br>
rotation at the output of the transmission.<br>
Therefore, with conventional transmissions the reverse shift is prevented under certain<br>
circumstances. For example, if the vehicle is moving forward at a particular speed in<br>
excess of a predetermined threshold speed, reverse shifts may be disabled or prevented<br>
so as to protect the engine and/or transmission from excessive shift shock. Likewise,<br>
when the vehicle is traveling at a relatively high rate of speed in a reverse direction, a<br>
"forward/drive" shift request may be disabled or prevented. Such shift control<br>
functionality may be provided using integrated transmission controls or other methods<br>
and/or control devices suitable for preventing the shifting event.<br><br>
In contrast to vehicles having a conventional transmission, hybrid vehicles are<br>
alternately or concurrently powered by an engine and/or one or more electric<br>
motor/generators, with forward and reverse operations typically achieved without<br>
specific gearing changes or shifting. In such hybrid transmissions, forward and reverse<br>
operations are achieved with the same mechanical configuration within the transmission.<br>
For example, "forward/drive" is achieved by commanding transmission output torque in<br>
a positive direction, while "reverse" is achieved by commanding transmission output<br>
torque in a negative direction. Therefore, unlike many conventional transmissions,<br>
hybrid transmissions may execute a reverse shift under limited forward operating<br>
conditions, or a forward shift under limited reverse operating conditions. However, both<br>
conventional and hybrid transmission control methodologies may be less than optimal<br>
when operating under certain drive conditions, particularly when the vehicle is traveling<br>
at a relatively high rate of speed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, a method is provided for controlling a vehicle transmission including<br>
recording a threshold transmission output speed, detecting the actual output speed of<br>
the transmission, detecting a shift request, comparing the detected and threshold output<br>
speeds, and executing a normal pedal progression map when the detected output speed<br>
is less than or equal to the threshold output speed. The method also executes a pair of<br>
inhibit limits or curves when the detected output speed is greater than the threshold<br>
output speed. The inhibit limits are configured to inhibit or delay a shift in the direction<br>
opposite the direction of travel when the detected output speed exceeds the threshold<br>
output speed by slowing the vehicle until the detected output speed drops below the<br>
threshold output speed.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the method includes configuring the vehicle with a speed<br>
sensor, a shift sensor, and a powertrain control module (PCM), sensing the transmission<br>
output speed using the speed sensor and relaying the detected output speed to the<br>
PCM, and sensing the shift request using the shift sensor and relaying the detected shift<br>
request to the PCM.<br><br>
In another aspect of the invention, the inhibit limits gradually slow the transmission<br>
output speed to zero upon detection of the shift request, and the PCM executes a<br>
corresponding forward or reverse pedal progression map to enable a shift upon reaching<br>
the threshold output speed.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the inhibit limits gradually approach zero output<br>
torque as vehicle speed increases, reaching zero output torque at a relatively high rate<br>
of vehicle speed, thereby simulating a neutral condition of the transmission upon a<br>
detected shift request at a relatively high rate of forward or reverse vehicle speed.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a vehicle is provided having a transmission with a<br>
detectable actual output speed, a speed sensor operable for detecting the actual output<br>
speed, a shift sensor operable for detecting a shift request, and a PCM having a stored<br>
threshold output speed value. The PCM has a stored algorithm for inhibiting an<br>
immediate shift when the shift request is in the direction opposite the direction of<br>
vehicle travel and when the detected actual output speed is greater than the stored<br>
threshold output speed value.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the vehicle includes a forward and reverse set of<br>
shift inhibit limits. The PCM is operable for selecting the forward set when the detected<br>
output speed is greater than the stored threshold output speed value and the vehicle is<br>
traveling in the reverse direction, and for selecting the reverse set of inhibit limits when<br>
the detected output speed is greater than the stored threshold output speed value and<br>
the vehicle is traveling in the forward direction.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the inhibit limits gradually approach zero output<br>
torque as the vehicle speed increases, reaching zero output torque at a relatively high<br>
rate of vehicle speed, thereby simulating a neutral condition upon detecting a shift<br>
request at a relatively high rate speed.<br>
The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes<br>
for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic graphical illustration of a vehicle in accordance with the present<br>
invention;<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic flow chart illustrating the preferred method or algorithm of the<br>
invention;<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic graphical representation of a forward pedal progression map<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like components,<br>
there is shown in FIG. 1 a schematic illustration of a vehicle 10 in accordance with the<br>
present invention. Vehicle 10 includes an engine 12 having an engine output shaft 13<br>
operatively connected to a transmission 14. The transmission 14 may be a conventional<br>
or mechanical/geared transmission, a continuously variable transmission, or alternately<br>
may be a hybrid transmission having includes at least one electric motor/generator 16,<br>
shown in phantom in FIG. 1 and represented therein as "M/G" for simplicity. In such an<br>
alternate hybrid configuration, motor/generator 16 is powered by an energy storage<br>
device (ESD) 18, for example a rechargeable battery or battery pack, when<br>
motor/generator 16 is acting in its capacity as a motor, and is operable for recharging<br>
ESD 18 when operating in its capacity as a generator. Transmission output shaft 17<br>
imparts or transfers an actual transmission output speed, represented as arrow N0, to a<br>
set of wheels 19 to thereby propel or drive vehicle 10.<br>
A controller or powertrain control module (PCM) 22 is operatively connected to engine<br>
12 and transmission 14. PCM 22 is in communication with the transmission 14 by way of<br>
a speed sensor 11 and a shift sensor 15, with sensors 11 and 15 being respectively<br>
configured, adapted, and/or programmed to sense the actual transmission output speed<br>
(N0) and a transmission shift request, such as an attempted movement of a gear shift<br>
mechanism (not shown). PCM 22 further includes memory 26 having a control method<br>
50 (see FIG. 2), as described hereinbelow,	<br><br>
which is configured or programmed to execute a shifting event, i.e. a shift into<br>
"forward/drive" or "reverse", when vehicle 10 is operating or traveling in the direction<br>
opposite that of the intended shift. That is, the method 50 inhibits an immediate or<br>
instantaneous shift into "forward/drive" or "reverse" by executing a gradual, controlled<br>
deceleration of vehicle 10 when a driver or operator of vehicle 10 selects or attempts to<br>
shift to "forward/drive" or "reverse" during a relatively high rate of vehicle speed in the<br>
opposite direction. The period of gradual deceleration is then sustained until a threshold<br>
transmission output speed value is reached, at which point PCM 22 can launch or<br>
execute the shifting event, and then proceed to execute previously stored or<br>
programmed forward and reverse pedal progression maps, as will be described later<br>
hereinbelow. The rate of deceleration is preferably selected to provide optimal comfort<br>
to a vehicle occupant, and also preferably low enough such that the engine 12 and<br>
transmission 14 are not subjected to excessive force or shift shock.<br>
Turning to FIG. 3, a forward pedal progression map 30 is shown that may be used with<br>
vehicle 10 of the present invention when vehicle 10 is operating in a "forward/drive"<br>
condition. In forward map 30, "output torque" is arranged or positioned along the Y-<br>
axis, and "vehicle speed" is arranged or positioned along the X-axis. As will be<br>
understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, a "pedal progression map" is a map of<br>
the amount of axle or transmission output torque requested or commanded for a<br>
particular accelerator position and/or a particular vehicle speed. Such pedal progression<br>
maps are commonly embodied as two-dimensional lookup tables which may be rapidly<br>
accessed by a controller such as PCM 22 of the present invention. Forward map 30 is<br>
bounded from above by 100% or fully depressed accelerator pedal position (curve 31),<br>
i.e. "full open" throttle, and from below by 0% accelerator pedal position (curve 32).<br>
The shape of curves 31 and 32 may be contoured according to the specific design<br>
parameters of transmission 14 (see FIG. 1), and therefore may vary depending on the<br>
design of the transmission 14. However, regardless of transmission design, curves 31<br>
and 32 generally define four pedal progression regions 34, 36, 38, 39 with respect to the<br>
intersecting X and Y axis.<br><br>
Region 34 describes a first "rollback" region or operating condition. Region 34 is a region<br>
in which an increasing torque is commanded in the direction of intended, i.e. forward,<br>
motion as vehicle 10 increases its speed in the direction opposite the intended motion.<br>
For example, rollback region 34 may execute when vehicle 10 is rolling backward with<br>
transmission 14 in "drive". While in region 34, PCM 22 commands an increasing torque<br>
suitable for slowing the rate of rollback.<br>
Next, region 36, which is the largest region of forward map 30, represents a<br>
"propulsion" operating condition. Region 36 is a region in which torque is commanded in<br>
the direction of intended motion to thereby accelerate vehicle 10 or to maintain an<br>
existing speed. As vehicle speed increases, the output torque required to maintain<br>
vehicle speed eventually drops to a relatively constant value, as indicated by the shape<br>
of curve 31. Below propulsion region 36, and below the X-axis, is a third or "drag"<br>
region 38. Region 38 is a region or operating condition in which torque is commanded<br>
opposite the direction of intended motion in order to slow vehicle 10 when the<br>
accelerator pedal (not shown) is near zero or unapplied, in order to simulate a condition<br>
of engine drag.<br>
Finally, region 39 represents a "creep region", or a region or operating condition in<br>
which a small amount of torque is commanded in the direction of intended motion<br>
during relatively low vehicle speeds and low accelerator pedal apply level or percentage<br>
of apply capacity, so that vehicle 10 moves in the intended direction. For example, creep<br>
region 39 may be entered when vehicle 10 is executing low speed maneuvers, such as<br>
while entering a garage.<br>
Turning to FIG. 2, the method 50 of the invention preferably initiates upon start-up of<br>
vehicle 10. Beginning with step 52, algorithm 50 detects the actual transmission output<br>
speed (N0) of transmission output 17, and temporarily stores or records the detected<br>
output speed (No) in memory 26. Detection of transmission output speed (N0) may be<br>
accomplished using one or more speed sensors 11, which mechanically and/or<br>
electrically detect transmission output speed (N0) and transmit the measured or<br>
detected speed value to PCM 22. Speed sensor 11 is any sensor equipped to directly<br>
and/or indirectly detect or sense the actual transmission output speed (N0), such as by<br>
detecting a throttle command or pedal	<br><br>
position/percent of apply of a vehicle throttle or accelerator pedal (not shown), and/or<br>
by directly or indirectly measuring rotational speed of transmission output 17. After<br>
transmission output speed (N0) has been detected, algorithm 50 then proceeds to step<br>
54.<br>
In step 54, algorithm 50 detects a shift request, i.e. an operator-initiated request to shift<br>
the transmission 14 (see FIG. 1) into "forward/drive" or "reverse" when vehicle 10 is<br>
traveling in a direction opposite that of the requested shift. Detection of a shift request<br>
may be accomplished using one or more shift sensors 15 which mechanically and/or<br>
electrically detect the shift request and transmit the detected shift request to PCM 22,<br>
where it is temporarily stored or recorded in memory 26. If no shift request is detected,<br>
the method 50 remains in step 54, and in a "forward/drive" or "reverse" operating<br>
condition according to forward map 30 (see FIG. 3) or reverse map 40 (see FIG. 4),<br>
respectively, until such a shift request is detected. Once detected, the method 50<br>
proceeds to step 56.<br>
In step 56, the method 50 compares the detected actual transmission output speed (N0)<br>
(see step 52) to a maximum or threshold transmission output speed, labeled in FIG. 2 as<br>
Nt, which is stored in memory 26. Memory 26 of PCM 22 is preferably preloaded or<br>
programmed with the threshold output speed value (Nt), which is preferably determined<br>
during pre-production vehicle development and testing, and which may vary depending<br>
on the specific design parameters of a given transmission 14. For example, in a<br>
conventional transmission, it may be preferable to set the threshold output speed (Nt) at<br>
zero to minimize shift shock, while a low but non-zero threshold output speed (Nt) may<br>
be used in conjunction with a hybrid transmission. Threshold output speed (Nt) is a<br>
speed below which algorithm 50 may efficiently and/or smoothly execute a forward or<br>
reverse pedal progression map, as discussed later hereinbelow with reference to step 58<br>
and FIG. 4, after executing the requested shifting event. If the detected transmission<br>
output speed (N0) is less than or equal to the stored threshold output speed (Nt),<br>
algorithm 50 proceeds to step 58. If, however, the detected transmission output speed<br>
(N0) is greater than the threshold output speed (Nt), algorithm 50 proceeds to step 60.<br><br>
In step 58, the method 50 executes a normal forward or reverse pedal progression map<br>
30 and 40, respectively (see FIGS. 3 and 4, respectively), as determined by the direction<br>
of travel of vehicle 10. That is, if vehicle 10 is traveling in "forward/drive", the pedal<br>
progression is governed by forward map 30 (see FIG. 3), and likewise, if vehicle 10 is<br>
traveling in "reverse", the pedal progression is governed by a reverse map 40 (see FIG.<br>
4). The algorithm 50 then continues operating within forward map 30 or reverse map 40<br>
until a shifting event in the opposite direction is requested.<br>
In step 60, which as explained above is executed if the method 50 determines that the<br>
detected transmission output speed (N0) is greater than the threshold output speed (Nt)<br>
(see step 56), the method 50 executes or imposes a set of separate or virtual "shift<br>
inhibit limits" before proceeding to step 58, with step 60 inhibiting or delaying the<br>
immediate shifting event. Steps 58 and 60 are best described together, with reference<br>
to FIGS. 3 and 4.<br>
Turning to FIG. 4, a "reverse pedal progression map" or reverse map 40 according to<br>
the invention is shown. As with the previously described forward map 30 of FIG. 3,<br>
reverse map 40 is bounded from above by 100% or fully depressed accelerator pedal<br>
position (curve 41), i.e. "full open" throttle, and bounded from below by 0% accelerator<br>
pedal position (curve 42). The shape of curves 41 and 42 may be contoured according<br>
to the specific design parameters of the transmission 14 (see FIG. 1). Reverse map 40<br>
further includes an upper reverse inhibit limit or curve 45, and a lower reverse inhibit<br>
limit or curve 47.<br>
As those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, transitioning immediately from<br>
forward map 30 of FIG. 3 to curves 41 and 42 of reverse map 40 (see FIG. 4)<br>
immediately upon movement of a shift lever (not shown) from "forward/drive" to<br>
"reverse" would not provide an optimally smooth and efficient shifting event under most<br>
vehicle speeds above a minimal or zero predetermined threshold speed (Nt). Therefore,<br>
in accordance with the invention, curves 45 and 47 are imposed on curves 41 and 42 of<br>
map 40.<br><br>
When vehicle 10 is moving in a forward direction according to forward map 30<br>
and an operator selects or shifts to "reverse", PGM 22 selects reverse map 40,<br>
and moves from forward map 30 of FIG. 3 to reverse map 40 of FIG. 4 at the<br>
same vehicle speed. However, rather than attempting to directly apply or<br>
execute reverse map 40 under the same output torque, PGM 22 instead applies a<br>
gradually increasing negative torque along following curves 45 and 47 to<br>
counteract the positive torque of transmission output 17, and at a level that is<br>
sufficient to produce an acceptable and/or comfortable rate of deceleration to<br>
vehicle 10. In other words, PGM 22 utilizes the previously described algorithm 50<br>
to impose curves 45 and 47 during positive speed conditions, and continues to<br>
impose curves 45 and 47 to the exclusion of curves 41 and 42, until vehicle 10<br>
reaches the threshold output speed value (Nt) (see step 56), at or near a zero<br>
vehicle speed to thereby minimize any shift shock.<br>
Curves 45 and 47 preferably flatten to or approach zero output torque at<br>
progressively higher vehicle speeds, thereby simulating a "neutral" operating<br>
condition at zero output torque and relatively high vehicle speeds. Once reaching<br>
the threshold output speed (Nt), PGM 22 executes the requested shifting event<br>
and continues operating according to reverse map 40. Within the scope of the<br>
invention, PGM 22 may be calibrated as desired, such as by modifying curves 41,<br>
42, 45, and 47, in order to produce the desired shift effect for transmission 14.<br>
Finally, similar forward inhibit limits 35 and 37 may be applied in the event<br>
vehicle 10 were to travel in a reverse direction at a high rate of speed, and an<br>
operator were to attempt to shift into "forward/drive". In such an event, rather<br>
than attempting to immediately switch to forward map 30 (see FIG. 3) at the<br>
corresponding vehicle speed point, a set of forward inhibit limits or curves 35<br>
and 37 would be imposed. Once curves 35 and 37 have slowed or reduced the<br>
reverse speed below the threshold speed (Nt), PCM 22 (see FIG. 1) may then<br>
execute a shifting event into "forward/drive" and continue operating according to<br>
forward map 30, as previously described hereinabove.<br><br>
In this manner, the method 50 may provide a smooth shifting event or transition<br>
between "reverse" and "forward/drive", and vice versa, when the vehicle 10 is<br>
moving, while maintaining propulsion capability throughout the transition, and<br>
even when the transition is made at a relatively high rate of speed. Additionally,<br>
method 50 provides for improved "rock cycles" when an operator attempts to<br>
alternately "rock" a vehicle forward and backward, such as when attempting to<br>
gain traction, since seamless transitions are enabled from "forward/drive" to<br>
"reverse" and back.<br>
While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in<br>
detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize<br>
various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within<br>
the scope of the disclosure.<br><br>
