BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pyrimidine derivatives, compositions and medicaments containing the same, as well as processes for the preparation and use of such compounds, compositions and medicaments. Such pyrimidine derivatives are useful in the treatment of diseases associated with inappropriate or pathological angiogenesis.<br>
The process of angiogenesis is the development of new blood vessels from the preexisting vasculature. Angiogenesis is defined herein as involving: (i) activation of endothelial ceils; (ii) increased vascular permeability; (in) subsequent dissolution of the basement membrane and extravasation of plasma components leading to formation of a provisional fibrin gel extracellular matrix; (iv) proliferation and mobilization of endothelial cells; (v) reorganization of mobilized endothelial cells to form functional capillaries; (vi) capillary loop formation; and (vi) deposition of basement membrane and recruitment of perivascular cells to newly formed vessels. Normal angiogenesis is active during tissue growth from embryonic development through maturity and then enters a period of relative quiescence during adulthood. Normal angiogenesis is also activated during wound healing, and at certain stages of the female reproductive cycle. Inappropriate or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with several disease states including various retinopathies, ischemic disease, atherosclerosis, chronic inflammatory disorders, and cancer. The role of angiogenesis in disease states is discussed, for instance, in Fan et al, Trends in Pharmacol Sci. 16:54-66; Shawver et al, DDT Vol. 2, No. 2 February 1997; Folkmann, 1995, Nature Medicine 1:27-31.<br>
In cancer the growth of solid tumors has been shown to be dependent on angiogenesis. The progression of leukemias as wed as the accumulation of fluid associated with malignant ascites and pleural effusions also involve pro-angiogenic factors. (See Folkmann, J., J. Nat'l. Cancer Inst, 1990, 82, 4-6.) Consequently, the targeting of pro-angiogenie pathways is a strategy being widely pursued in order to provide new therapeutics in these areas of great, unmet medical need.<br><br>
2<br>
Central to the process of angiogenesis are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors, termed vascular endothelial growth factor receptor(s) (VEGFRs), The roles VEGF and VEGFRs play in the vascularization of solid tumors, progression of hematopoietic cancers and modulation of vascular permeability have drawn great interest in the scientific community. VEGF is a polypeptide, which has been linked to inappropriate or pathological angiogenesis (Pinedo, H.M. et a! The Oncologist, Vol.5, No. 90001, 1-2, April 2000). VEGFR(s) are protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that catalyze the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in proteins that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and survival. (A.F. Wilks, Progress in Growth Factor Research, 1990, 2, 97-111; SA Courtneidge, Dev, Supp.l, 1993, 57-64; JA Cooper, Sernin. Cell Biol., 1994, 5(6), 377-387; R.F. Paulson, Sernin. Immunol., 1995, 7(4), 267-277; AC. Chan, Curr. Opin, Immunol., 1996, 8(3), 394-401).<br>
Three PTK receptors for VEGF have been identified: VEGFR1 (Flt-1); VEGFR2 ( Flk-1 and KDR) and VEGFR3 (Fit-4). These receptors are involved in angiogenesis and participate in signal transduction. (Mustonen, T. et al J. Cell Biol 1995:129:895-898; Ferrara and Davis-Smyth, Endocrine Reviews, 18(l):4-25, 1997; McMahon, G., The Oncologist, Vol. S, No 90001. 3-10, April 2000).<br>
Of particular interest is VE6FR2, which is a transmembrane receptor PTK expressed primarily in endothelial cells. Activation of VEGFR-2 by VEGF is a critical step in the signal transduction pathway that initiates tumor angiogenesis. VEGF expression may be constitutive to tumor cells and can also be upregulated in response to certain stimuli. One such stimulus is hypoxia, where VEGF expression is upreguiated in both tumor and associated host tissues. The VEGF ligand activates VEGFR2 by binding to its extracellular VEGF binding site. This leads to receptor dimerization of VEGFRs and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues at the intracellular kinase domain of VEGFR2. The kinase domain operates to transfer a phosphate from ATP to the tyrosine residues, thus providing binding sites for signaling proteins downstream of VEGFR-2 leading ultimately to angiogenesis, (Ferrara and Davis-Smyth, Endocrine Reviews, 18(1):4-25, 1997; McMahon, 6., The Oncologist Vol. 5, No. 90001, 3-10, April 2000.)<br><br>
Consequently, antagonism of the VEGFR2 kinase domain would block phosphorylation of tyrosine residues and serve to disrupt initiation of angiogenesis. Specifically, inhibition at the ATP binding site of the VEGFR2 kinase domain would prevent binding of ATP and prevent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. Such disruption of the pro-angiogenesis signal transduction pathway associated with VEGFR2 should therefore inhibit tumor angiogenesis and thereby provide a potent treatment for cancer or other disorders associated with inappropriate angiogenesis.<br>
The present inventors have discovered novel pyrimidine derivative compounds, which are inhibitors of VEGFR-2 kinase activity. Such pyrimidine derivatives are useful in the treatment of disorders, including cancer, associated with inappropriate angiogenesis.<br>

31<br>
While it is possible that, for use in therapy, therapeutically effective amounts of a compound of formula (1), as well as salts, solvates and physiological functional derivatives thereof, may be administered as the raw chemical, it is possible to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, the invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, which include therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of the formula (!) and salts, solvates and physiological functional derivatives thereof, and one or more pharmaceuticaly acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients. The compounds of the formula (I) and salts, solvates and physiological functional derivatives thereof, are as described above. The carrier(s), diluent(s) or excipient(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is also provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation including admixing a compound of the formula (I), or salts, solvates and physiological functional derivatives thereof, with one or more pharmaceutical acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations may be presented in unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Such a unit may contain, for example, 0.5mg to 1g, preferably 1mg to 700mg. of a compound of the formula (!) depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration and the age, weight and condition of the patient Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient Furthermore, such pharmaceutical formulations may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmacy art.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example by the oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual or transdermal), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intradermal) route. Such formulations may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by bringing into association the active ingredient with the carriers) or excipient(s).<br><br>
32<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil liquid emulsions.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceuticafly acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Powders are prepared by comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing with a similarly comminuted pharmaceutical carrier such as an edible carbohydrate, as, for example, starch or mannitol. Flavoring, preservative, dispersing and coloring agent can also be present<br>
Capsules are made by preparing a powder mixture as described above, and filling formed gelatin sheaths. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate or solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrating or soiubilizing agent such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate or sodium carbonate can also be added to improve the availability of the medicament when the capsule is ingested.<br>
Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like. Tablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant and pressing into tablets. A powder mixture is prepared by nixing the compound, suitably comminuted, with a diluent or base as described above, and optionally, with a binder such as carboxymethylcellulose, an aliginate, gelatin, or<br><br>
33<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a solution retardant such as paraffin, a resorption accelerator such as a quaternary salt and/or an absorption agent such as bentonite, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials and forcing through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be run through the tablet machine and the result is imperfectly formed slugs broken into granules. The granules can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The compounds of the present invention can also be combined with a free flowing inert carrier and compressed into tablets directly without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A clear or opaque protective coating consisting of a sealing coat of shellac, a coating of sugar or polymeric material and a polish coating of wax can be provided. Dyestuffs can be added to these coatings to distinguish different unit dosages.<br>
Oral fluids such as solution, syrups and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of the compound. Syrups can be prepared by dissolving the compound in a suitably flavored aqueous solution, while elixirs are prepared through the use of a non-toxic alcoholic vehicle. Suspensions can be formulated by dispersing the compound in a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilizers and emulsifiers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxy ethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavor additives such as peppermint oil or natural sweeteners or saccharin or other artificial sweeteners, and the like can also be added.<br>
Where appropriate, dosage unit formulations for oral administration can be microencapsulated. The formulation can also be prepared to prolong or sustain the release as for example by coating or embedding particulate material in polymers, wax or the like.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and salts, solvates and physiological functional derivatives thereof, can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, .such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles.<br><br>
34<br>
Liposomes   can   be   formed   from   a   variety   of   phospholipids,   such   as   cholesterol, stearyiamine or phosphatidylcholines.<br>
The compounds Of formula (i) and saits, solvates and physiological functional derivatives thereof may also be delivered by the use of monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The compounds may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, poiyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, pofylactic acid, polepsilon caprolactone, poiyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches intended to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. For example, the active ingredient may be delivered from the patch by iontophoresis as generally described in Pharmaceutical Research, 3(6), 318 (1986).<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration may be formulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols or oils.<br>
For treatments of the eye or other external tissues, for example mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredient may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in-oil base.<br><br>
35<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administrations to the eye include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges, pastilles and mouth washes.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for rectal administration may be presented as suppositories or as enemas.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oil solutions of the active ingredient.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for administration by inhalation include fine particle dusts or mists, which may be generated by means of various types of metered, dose pressurised aerosols, nebulizers or insufflators.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous<br><br>
36<br>
injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets.<br>
It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention will depend upon a number of factors including, for example, the age and weight of the animal, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, the nature of the formulation, and the route of administration, and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. However, an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) for the treatment of neoplastic growth, for example colon or breast carcinoma, will generally be in the range of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg body weight of recipient (mammal) per day and more usually in the range of 1 to 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Thus, for a 70kg adult mammal, the actual amount per day would usually be from 70 to 700 mg and this amount may be given in a single dose per day or more usually in a number (such as two, three, four, five or six) of sub-doses per day such that the total daily dose is the same. An effective amount of a salt or solvate, or physiologically functional derivative thereof, may be determined as a proportion of the effective amount of the compound of formula (I) perse. It is envisaged that similar dosages would be appropriate for treatment of the other conditions referred to above.<br>
The compounds of the present invention and their salts and solvates, and physiologically functional derivatives thereof, may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of the above-mentioned conditions. In particular, in anti-cancer therapy, combination with other chemotherapeutic, hormonal or antibody agents is envisaged as well as combination with surgical therapy and radiotherapy. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, or a physiologically functional derivative thereof, and<br><br>
37<br>
the use of at least one other cancer treatment method. Preferably, combination therapies according to the present invention comprise the administration of at least one compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, or a physiologically functional derivative thereof, and at least one other pharmaceutically active agent, preferably an anti-neopiastic agent. The compound(s) of formula (I) and the other pharmaceutically active agent(s) may be administered together or separately and, when administered separately this may occur simultaneously or sequentially in any order. The amounts of the compound(s) of formula (I) and the other pharmaceutically active agent[s] and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.<br>
The compounds of the Formula (I) or salts, solvates, or physiologically functional derivatives thereof and at least one additional cancer treatment therapy may be employed in combination concomitantly or sequentially in any therapeutically appropriate combination with such other anti-cancer therapies. In one embodiment, the other anticancer therapy is at least one additional chemotherapeutic therapy including administration of at least one anti-neoplastic agent. The administration in combination of a compound of formula (I) or salts, solvates, or physiologically functional derivatives thereof with other anti-neoplastic agents may be in combination in accordance with the invention by administration concomitantly in (1) a unitary pharmaceutical composition including both compounds or (2) separate pharmaceutical compositions each including one of the compounds. Alternatively, the combination may be administered separately in a sequential manner wherein one anti-neoplastic agent is administered first and the other second or vice versa. Such sequential administration may be close in time or remote in time.<br>
Anti-neoplastic agents may induce antineoplastic effects in a cell-cycle specific manner, i.e., are phase specific and act at a specific phase of the cell cycle, or bind DNA and act in a non cell-cycle specific manner, i.e., are non-cell cycle specific and operate by other mechanisms.<br><br>
38<br>
Anti-neoplastic agents useful in combination with the compounds and salts, solvates or physiologically functional derivatives thereof of formula I include the following:<br>
(1)	cell cycle specific antineoplastic agents including, but not limited to, diterpenoids such as paclitaxel and its analog docetaxel; vinca alkaloids such as vinblastine, vincristine, vindesine, and vinorelbine; epipodophyllotoxins such as etoposide and teniposide; fiuoropyrimidines such as 5-fluorouracil and fluorodeoxyuridine ; antimetabolites such as allopurinol, fludurabine, methotrexate, cladrabine, cytarabine, mercaptopurine and thioguanine; and camptothecins such as 9-amino camptothecin, irinotecan, CPT-11 and the various optical forms of 7-(4-methylpiperazino-methylene)-10,11 -ethylenedioxy-20-camptothecin;<br>

The compounds of formula (I) and salts, solvates and physiological functional derivatives thereof, are believed to have anticancer activity as a result of inhibition of the protein kinase VEGFR2 and its effect on selected cell lines whose growth is dependent on VEGFR2 protein kinase activity.<br>
The present invention thus also provides compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof, or physiologically functional derivatives thereof, for use in medical therapy, and particularly in the treatment of disorders mediated by inappropriate VEGFR2 activity.<br>
The inappropriate VEGFR2 activity referred to herein is any VEGFR2 activity that deviates from the normal VEGFR2 activity expected in a particular mammalian subject Inappropriate VEGFR2 activity may take the form of, for instance, an abnormal increase in activity, or an aberration in the timing and or control of VEGFR2 activity. Such inappropriate activity may result then, for example, from overexpression or mutation of the protein kinase or ligand leading to inappropriate or uncontrolled activation of the receptor. Furthermore, it is also understood that unwanted VEGFR2 activity may reside in an abnormal source, such as a malignancy. That is, the level of VEGFR2 activity does not have to be abnormal to be considered inappropriate, rather the activity derives from an abnormal source. In a like manner, the inappropriate angiogenesis referred to herein is any angiogenic activity that deviates from the normal angiogenic activity expected in a particular mammalian subject Inappropriate angiogenesis may take the form of, for instance, an abnormal increase in activity, or an aberration in the timing and or control of angiogenic activity. Such inappropriate activity may result then, for example, from overexpression or mutation of a protein kinase or ligand leading to inappropriate or uncontrolled activation of angiogenesis. Furthermore, it is also understood that unwanted angiogenic activity may reside in an abnormal source, such as a malignancy. That is, the<br><br>
40<br>
level of angiogenic activity does not have to be abnormal to be considered inappropriate, rather the activity derives from an abnormal source.<br>
The present invention is directed to methods of regulating, modulating, or inhibiting VEGFR2 for the prevention and/or treatment of disorders related to unregulated VEGFR2 activity. In particular, the compounds of the present invention can also be used in the treatment of certain forms of cancer. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention can be used to provide additive or synergistic effects with certain existing cancer chemotherapies and radiation, and/or be used to restore effectiveness of certain existing cancer chemotherapies and radiation.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also useful in the treatment of one or more diseases afflicting mammals which are characterized by cellular proliferation in the area of disorders associated with neo-vascularization and/or vascular permeability including blood vessel proliferative disorders including arthritis and restenosis; fibrotic disorders including hepatic cirrhosis and atherosclerosis; mesangial cell proliferative disorders include glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes, proliferative retinopathies, organ transplant rejection and glomerulopathies; and metabolic disorders include psoriasis, diabetes mellitus, chronic wound healing, inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases.<br>

Compounds of general formula (I), (II), (III), and (IV) may be prepared by methods known in the art of organic synthesis as set forth in part by the following synthesis schemes. Generally, the following schemes are illustrated using compounds of formula (II), but it is recognized that such schemes are easily adaptable by the skilled artisan to prepare compounds of formula (I), including compounds of formula (111) and (IV). It is also recognized that in all of the schemes described below, it is well understood that protecting groups for sensitive or reactive groups are employed where necessary in accordance with general principles of chemistry. Protecting groups are manipulated according to standard methods of organic synthesis (T. W. Green and P. G. M. Wuts (1991) Protectinq Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley ft Sons). These groups are removed at a convenient stage of the compound synthesis using methods that are readily apparent to those skilled in the art The selection of processes as well as the reaction conditions and order of their execution shall be consistent with the preparation of compounds of formula (I). Those skilled in the art will recognize if a stereocenter exists in compounds of formula (I). Accordingly, the present invention includes both possible stereoisomers and includes not only racemic compounds but the individual enantiomers as well. When a compound is desired as a single enantiomer, it may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis or by resolution of the final product or any convenient intermediate. Resolution of the final product, an intermediate, or a starting material may be effected by any suitable method known in the art See, for example, Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds by E. L Eliel, S. H. Wilen, and L N. Mander (Wiley-lnterscience, 1994).<br>
Compounds of formula (II), wherein W is C-H, can be prepared according to the<br>
synthetic sequence shown in Scheme 1 and further detailed in the Examples section<br>
following. Typically 2,4-Dichloropyrimidine (1) undergoes a displacement reaction at C4<br>
with an appropriate aminoindazole (A) to provide the 2-chloro-4-arylaminopyrimidine<br><br>
44<br>
derivative (B). For compounds of formula (11), wherein X4 is hydrogen, a further displacement at C2 is carried out with an appropriate arylamine (C) to provide the compound of Formula (II), wherein X4 is hydrogen. Alternatively, for compounds of Formula (II), wherein X4 is not hydrogen, chloropyrimidine B is treated with di-t-butyl-dicarbonate to affect BOC protection at N1 of the indazole (Scheme 2). Subsequent N-alkylation under standard conditions affords the N4-alkyl-2-chloropyrimidine D, which is treated with an arylamine C in a similar fashion as above to provide the compound of Formula (II), wherein X4 is not hydrogen. In exceptional cases, BOC deprotection is not fully facilitated in the displacement reaction and the initial reaction product is further exposed to TFA or HCI to afford the desired product<br><br><br><br>
45<br>
Compounds of Formula (II), wherein W is C-F, can be prepared according to the synthetic sequence shown in Scheme 3 and further detailed in the Examples section following. 5-Fiuorouracil (2) is converted to 5-fluoro-2,4-dichloropyrimidinc (3) by treatment with POCl3. The remaining steps in the synthesis of compounds of Formula (11), wherein W is C-F, are parallel to those described above in Scheme 1 and/or Scheme 2. Compounds of formula (HI), wherein W is C-F, can be prepared by using 5-fluoro-2,4-dichloropyrimidine (3) with appropriate adaptation of Scheme 10 following, such adaptation being within the purview of those skilled in the art.<br><br><br>
46<br>
Compounds of Formula (II), wherein W is N, can be prepared according to the synthetic sequence shown in Scheme 4 and further detailed in the Examples section following. 2,4-Dichloro~1,3,5-triazine (4) is treated with an arylamine C in a suitable solvent (e.g., CH3CN) to afford the a chlorotriazine E. Compound E is further treated with arylamine A (X4 is H or alkyl) to provide the compound of Formula (II). Compounds of formula (III), wherein W is N, can be prepared by using 2,4-Dichloro-1,3.5-triazine (4) with appropriate adaptation of Scheme 10 following, such adaptation being within the purview of those skilled in the art<br><br>

The aniline moieties of Formula (1), depicted as structure C in Schemes 1, 2 and 4 above, are available through multi-step organic synthesis familiar to one who is skilled in the art The following schemes illustrate the methods that can be used to derive the anilines of structure C, which are incorporated into compounds of Formula (I) of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Scheme 5, the appropriately substituted meta- or para-NO2  benzylamine can be condensed with an alkyl- or aryisulfonyl chloride under suitable conditions (e.g., triethylamine, CH2CI2) to provide a sulfonamide F. The NO2 moiety of F can be reduced using SnCl2/conc. HCl or by hydrogenation (e.g., 10% Pd/C in methanol) to provide the desired aniline. Other embodiments of the present invention can be derived from anilines that are prepared as shown in Scheme 6. A nitro-substituted benzyl chloride G is converted to a sodium benzylsulfonate salt H by reaction at elevated temperature with Na2SO3 in a H2O/dioxane mixture. Treatment of H with SOCl2 (cat DMF/CH2Cl2) provides the corresponding sulfonylchloride I. which can be treated with an amine to provide a sulfonamide J. Reduction of the nitro group in J can be accomplished in similar fashion as described above in Scheme 5.<br><br>
48<br><br>
Scheme 7 depicts the synthesis of other anilines of structure C that are useful in the preparation of compounds of Formula (I). An appropriate thiolate anion undergoes a displacement reaction with a nitro-substituted benzyl chloride G to provide a benzylic sulfide K. Oxidation of the sulfide, for example with mCPBA, provides the corresponding sulfone, which is then reduced by standard methods to the desired aniline C.<br><br>
Scheme 8 depicts the synthesis of other anilines of structure C that are useful in the preparation of compounds of Formula (I). The 2-methoxyacetanilide undergoes chlorosulfonylation under standard conditions to provide the expected arylsulfonyl chloride L   Amination of L with an amine affords a sulfonamide, which is hydrolyzed<br><br>
49<br><br>
Scheme 9 depicts the synthesis of other anilines of structure C that are useful in the preparation of compounds of Formula (1). The para-methoxy sulfenimide M can be prepared as described in the prior art Mitsunobu-type substitution with an alcohol provides the phenyl sulfide N. (In certain cases, one who is skilled in the art will recognize that the same phenylsulfide N can be derived by alkylation of the para-methoxy thiophenoxide anion with an alkyl halide.) Oxidation of sulfide N affords a sulfone 0, which undergoes nitration to provide the methoxynitrosulfone P. Methoxynitrosulfone P is reduced as already described by the earlier scheme to the aniline C.<br><br><br>
50<br>
Scheme 10 depicts the synthesis of compounds of Formula (111). A substituted 6-nitroindazole O undergoes alkylation by an appropriate alkylating agent (e.g., trimethyloxonium tetraflouroborate, triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate, benzyl halide) to provide the N2-atkylated nitroindazole R. Reduction of the nitro group using standard conditions (e.g., SnCl2, aqueous acid or 10% Pd/C, methanol, ammonium formate) followed by condensation with 2.4-dichloropyrimidine provides the chloropyrimidine S. Alkylation of the bisaryl amine nitrogen under appropriate alkylation conditions (e.g., Mel, CS2CO3, DMF) affords intermediate T, which undergoes subsequent condensation with an appropriately substituted aniline to provide the compound of Formula (111).<br><br>

Unless otherwise indicated, the compounds of Examples 22-37 and 41-68 were prepared according to the general procedures set forth above in Example 21. in most cases the hydrochloride salts of these examples were readily obtained as described in the experimental above. In certain cases it was more convenient to isolate the final compound as its free base by partitioning with an organic solvent (e.g., ethyl acetate) and an aqueous base (e.g. aqueous sodium bicarbonate). It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the syntheses of these examples will use either of Scheme 1 or Scheme 2 described above, depending on group X4. the nature of which defines the alkylating agent whose use is described in Scheme 2. The NMR data characterizing these examples describe either the salt form or the free base form.<br>

The plate was incubated at 37 °C overnight The medium was removed by aspiration, and test compounds were added to each well in a volume of 0.1 ml/well in serum-free M199 medium. Compound concentrations ranged from 1.5 nM to 30 micromoiar. The plate was incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Another 0.1 ml of serum-free M199 medium containing BSA'and VEGF (or bFGF) was added to give a final concentration of 0.1% BSA and 10 ng/ml VEGF (0.3 ng/ml bFGF). The plate was incubated at 37°C for 72 hrs. BrdU was added to each well after the first 48 hrs to give a concentration of 10 micromoiar. The colorimetric ELISA assay was performed according to manufacturer's (Roche Molecular Sciences) instructions, with detection by absorbance reading at 450 nm. Results were plotted as concentration of test compound vs. absorbance to give an ICso value for inhibition of BrdU incorporation.<br>
