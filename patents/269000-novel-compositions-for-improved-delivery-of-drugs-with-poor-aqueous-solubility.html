COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
	(See section 10 and rule 13)	<br>
1.	TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
"Novel compositions for improved delivery of drugs with poor aqueous<br>
solubility"<br>
2.	APPLICANT (S)<br>
(a) NAME: NAGARSENKER, MANGAL SHAILESH<br>
(b)NAT10NALITY: INDIAN	<br>
(c) ADDRESS: A-401, Vikas Palms, Ambedkar Road, Thane (West) - 400 602<br>
Maharashtra, India.<br>
3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed.	<br><br><br><br>
Technical field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an easily reconstitutable, novel pre-concentrate<br>
pharmaceutical compositions capable of providing active pharmaceutical ingredients in<br>
solubilized form either in situ with the biological fluid of the body or with distilled water<br>
and buffers. The present invention further relates to compositions which are designed<br>
with the aim of improving delivery of pharmaceutical active ingredients with poor<br>
aqueous solubility. More particularly, the present invention relates to the improved<br>
parenteral delivery of Propofol, and improvement in cefpodoxime proxetil and triclosan<br>
delivery.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
Identifying the strategies for efficient delivery of hydrophobic drugs in order to improve<br>
their therapeutic performance has always been a mainstay of drug delivery research and<br>
their importance would continue to increase; as approximately 40% or more of the new<br>
chemical entities being generated through drug discovery programmes are poorly water-<br>
soluble.<br>
Solubilization is one way of improving the delivery Of hydrophobic drugs, which has<br>
been extensively investigated by the pharmaceutical scientists. In particular, colloidal<br>
delivery systems such as microemulsions and nanoemulsions have gained a great interest<br>
in the last two decades.<br>
Propofol falls under the pharmaceutical category Of anesthetic agents. Chemically<br>
Propofo! of formula I is 2,6-diisopropylphenol with the molecular formula C12H18O and<br>
its molecular weight is 178.27. Its chemical structure is, as follows:<br><br>
2	.<br><br>
Propofol is commonly used both for anesthesia and for sedation. It is the intravenous<br>
anesthetic of choice for ambulatory surgery in outpatients. Propofot has low water<br>
solubility, therefore it must be administered in the form of a lipid emulsion. Due to its<br>
high lipid-solubility, Propofol was initially formulated as a solution with the surfactant<br>
Cremophore EL, but the occurrence of pain on injection and anaphylactoid reactions<br>
prompted to search for alternative formulations.<br>
US patent no, 5714520 claims oil in water emulsion of Propofol for parenteral<br>
administration comprising a water-immiscible solvent such as a vegetable oil, a surfactant<br>
from a natural source, disodium edetate and water.<br>
WO9632135 discloses a pharmaceutical composition containing an inclusion complex of<br>
Propofol and a cyclodextrin for administration as an injection.<br>
GB1472793 discloses compositions in the form of aqueous or non-aqueous compositions,<br>
solid or semi-solid mixtures and oil-in-water emulsions of Propofol comprising<br>
surfactants, solubilising agents, additional solvents, stabilizers, preservatives, anti-<br>
oxidants, sequestering agents and other excipients.<br>
Cefpodoxime proxetil (CFP) is an orally absorbed, broad spectrum, third generation<br>
cephalosporin ester implicated in treatment of upper respiratory tract and urinary tract<br>
infections.<br>
3<br>
Cefpodoxime proxetil of Formula II is RS)-l(isopropoxycarbonyloxy)ethyI (+)-(6R,7R)-<br>
7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-[(Z)methoxyirnino] acetamido]-3- methoxymethyl-8-oxo-5-<br>
thia-1-azabicyclo [4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2- carboxylate with the molecular formula<br>
C21H27NsO9S2 and molecular weight 557.59. Its chemical structure is as follows:<br><br><br>
Cefpodoxime proxetil has low oral bioavailability (50%) due to hydrolysis by<br>
cholinesterases in intestinal lumen. It has low aqueous and pH dependant solubility.<br>
Lipid based systems like submicronic emulsions have shown to improve the<br>
bioavailability of Cefpodoxime proxetil. Though submicronic emulsion is an attractive<br>
approach, the quantity of submicronic emulsions required for administration of single<br>
dose of cefpodoxime proxetil and palatability related issues associated with Cefpodoxime<br>
proxetil and lipid excipients could be limiting factors for patient compliance and their<br>
commercial viability. Hence, there is a strong need for development of lipid- based drug<br>
delivery strategy that will retain all the bioavailability related advantages associated with<br>
the submicronic emulsion and at the same time would overcome limitations associated<br>
with submicronic emulsion.<br>
Triclosan (TC) is a poorly water-soluble nonionic compound with broad-spectrum<br>
antibacterial/ariti-microbial activity.<br>
Triclosan of Formula III is 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) with the molecular<br>
formula C12H7Cl3O2. Its chemical structure is as follows:<br><br>
Triclosan is used in the treatment of plaque, caries and gingivitis. Moreover, triclosan has<br>
also shown to have anti-acne and anti-malarial activity.<br>
Triclosan appears to kill bacteria mainly by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis. Triclosan<br>
binds to bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase enzyme (ENR), which is encoded<br>
by Fabl. This binding increases the enzyme's affinity for nicotinamide adenine<br>
4<br><br>
dinucleotide (NAD+), This results in the formation of a stable ternary complex of Fabl-<br>
NAD+-triclosan, which is unable to participate in fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acid is<br>
necessary for reproducing and building cell membranes. Humans do not have an ENR<br>
enzyme, and thus are not affected. Some bacterial strains are resistant to triclosan due to<br>
FabI mutations which decrease triclosan's effect on FabI-NAD+ binding.<br>
Object of the invention:<br>
The Object of the present invention relates to an easily reconstitutable, novel pre-<br>
concentrate pharmaceutical compositions capable of providing active pharmaceutical<br>
ingredients in solubilized form either in situ with the biological fluid of the body or with<br>
distilled water and buffers.<br>
Another object of the invention provides compositions which are designed with the aim<br>
of improving delivery of pharmaceutical active ingredients with poor aqueous solubility.<br>
Yet another object of the invention relates to the improved parenteral delivery of<br>
Propofol, and improvement in cefpodoxime proxetil and triclosan delivery.<br>
Further object of the invention is to overcome the disadvantages like hyperlipidemia, poor<br>
physical stability, embolism and pain at injection site associated with the currently<br>
marketed Propofol formulations.<br>
In a further object of the invention, the use of preconcentrate is also extended to deliver<br>
Cefpodoxime proxetil and triclosan in solubilized form for improving their oral and/or<br>
dermal delivery.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The present invention describes an easily reconstitutable, novel pre-concentrate<br>
pharmaceutical compositions capable of providing active pharmaceutical ingredients in<br>
solubilized form either in situ with the biological fluid of the body or with distilled water<br>
and buffers. The present invention further describes compositions which are designed<br>
5<br><br>
with the aim of improving delivery of pharmaceutical active ingredients with poor<br>
aqueous solubility. More particularly, the present invention describes the improved<br>
parenteral delivery of Propofol, and improvement in cefpodoxime proxetil and triclosan<br>
delivery.<br>
The present invention more particularly describes pharmaceutical compositions for<br>
parenteral administration in the form of novel preconcentrates containing Propofol and<br>
various pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as surfactants, solubilisers,<br>
stabilisers, oils and modified oils either alone or in combination yielding Propofol in<br>
stable, solubilized and ready to administer injectable form, on dilution with sterile water<br>
for injection or other vehicles such as 0.9% saline, 2.25% glycerine, 5% dextrose and 5 %<br>
sorbitol.<br>
Further, the invention describes preconcentrates prepared with pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients such as surfactants, co-surfactants, solubilisers, stabilisers, oils and<br>
modified oils either alone or in combination that can yield cefpodoxime proxetil and<br>
triclosan in microemulisified or nanoemulsified form on dilution with distilled water and<br>
buffers.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The present invention describes novel pharmaceutical preconcentrates designed for<br>
improved delivery of hydrophobic drugs with special emphasis on Propofol,<br>
Cefpodoxime proxetil and Triclosan. Moreover, the compositions described herein could<br>
be employed for parenteral or oral or dermal delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients<br>
depending upon the ingredients used in their preparation.<br>
Propofol, 2,6-diisopropylphenol, is a short-acting anesthetic agent, administered by<br>
intravenous route for short surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation in the intensive<br>
care unit. Propofol is poorly water soluble. It is very popular amongst clinicians due to<br>
its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, rapid onset and recovery even after long periods of<br>
anesthesia and low incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting. However, its poor<br>
6<br><br>
aqueous solubility poses a challenge to formulation scientists which the present inventors<br>
have tried to overcome.<br>
Cefpodoxime proxetil is a poorly bioavailable, high dose cephalosporin antibiotic having<br>
pH dependant solubility and poor aqueous solubility,<br>
Triclosan (TC) is a broad-spectrum antibacterial/anti-microbial agent and has poor water<br>
solubility, which makes it difficult to formulate.<br>

The compositions described in the examples 11 to 17 can be prepared by first dissolving<br>
Cefpodoxime proxetil in oily phase with the help of magnetic stirring and then by adding<br>
the remaining ingredient followed by gentle heating at 60°C (whenever required) to yield<br>
a homogenous preconcentrate. These preconcentrates would yield microemulsions or<br>
nanoemulsions after dilution with distilled water or physiological buffers. These<br>
preconcentrates can be filled in hard gelatin or soft gelatin capsules or can be adsorbed<br>
onto solid carriers to obtain a unit dosage form. These compositions after ingestion would<br>
present Cefpodoxime proxetil in nanoemulsified form in vivo.<br>
Various experiments performed with some selected compositions would be presented<br>
herein. In all the experiments related to Propofol, compositions described in Examples 2,3<br>
and 4 are used. In all the experiments related cefpodoxime proxetil, composition<br>
described in Example 16 is used.<br>
12<br><br>
Experiment 1<br>
Globule size of Propofol:<br>
The compositions described in Examples 2,3 and 4 were diluted suitably with 0.9% saline<br>
and the globule size of Propofol was determined by using photon correlation spectroscopy<br>
(PCS). The globule size of Propofol was found to be less than 30nm in all the cases.<br>
Moreover, there was no considerable increase in the globule size on storing the<br>
microemulsions for 18 hrs confirming their suitability for IV infusion of Propofol.<br>
Experiment 2:<br>
pH determination:<br>
The compositions described in Examples 2,3 and 4 were prepared and their pH was<br>
determined in triplicate at room temperature. The compositions exhibited pH in the range<br>
of 4.7-5.1<br>
Experiment 3:<br>
Effect of centrifugation and freeze-thaw cycling:<br>
The compositions described in Examples 2,3 and 4 were prepared. The compositions<br>
were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min to assess effect of centrifugation. Furthermore,<br>
compositions were subjected to freeze-thaw cycling. One freeze-thaw cycle consisted of<br>
storing of compositions at -20°C for 24 h. After this, they were stored at room<br>
temperature for another 24 hrs. Compositions could withstand centrifugation and freeze-<br>
thaw cycling.<br>
Experiment 4:<br>
Effect of autoclaving;<br>
The preconcentrates described in Examples 2,3 and 4 were prepared, filled in glass vials,<br>
sealed and sterilized by autoclaving at 121°C for 15 min. The effect of autoclaving was<br>
f<br>
determined by evaluating the Propofol content, globule size and pH of the compositions<br>
before and after the autoclaving.<br>
Autoclaving did not have any significant effect on the Propofol content, globule size and<br>
pH of the compositions.<br>
13<br><br>
Experiments:<br>
In vitro hemolysis:<br>
In vitro hemolysis of compositions described in Examples 2, 3 and 4 was assessed using<br>
heparinized fresh human whole blood. Blood samples were pooled and subdivided into<br>
three portions (1.6 ml each) and each of the portions Was spiked with various Propofol<br>
microemulsions (0.4 ml) such that the final concentration of Propofol in all the blood<br>
samples was 10 ng/ml.<br>
Immediately after addition, the blood-microemulsion mixture was gently agitated for<br>
5-10 seconds and incubated at 37°C for 2 hrs. After incubation, the mixtures were placed<br>
in the ice-cold water for 2 min to quench the hemolytic process. The intact red blood cells<br>
were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 5°C. The<br>
negative control was prepared by incubating 1.6 ml of blood with 0.4 ml of 0.9 % sodium<br>
chloride solution at 37°C for 2 h. In order to obtain I00°/0 hemolysis of the blood, 1.6 ml<br>
of blood was diluted with 14.4 ml of double distilled water and the mixture was incubated<br>
at 37°C for 30min. This sample served as positive control. The controls received same<br>
treatment as that of test samples so as to separate intact erythrocytes from the mixture.<br>
However, in case of negative control all the erythrocytes remained intact and in case of<br>
positive control none of the erythrocytes remained intact.<br>
The supernatant from all the samples (including positive and negative control) was<br>
removed, transferred to another microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm<br>
for 5 min at 5°C in order to get rid of any intact erythrocytes that may have come while<br>
withdrawing the supernatant. Supernatant, 0.3 ml was Suitably diluted with 4.15 ml of<br>
0.9% saline in case of test samples and negative control and with double distilled water in<br>
case of positive control and analyzed for the content of hemoglobin by measuring the<br>
absorbance of supernatant at 540 nm.<br>
The extent of hemolysis as percentage (% H) was determined by using following equation<br>
% H = [(Abs - Abs control) / (Abs100 - Abs control)X 100<br>
where,<br>
Abs is absorbance of sample,<br>
Abs control is absorbance of control sample (negative control),<br>
Absioo is absorbance of sample in which 100 % hemolysisj occurred (positive control).<br>
14<br><br>
The compositions led to very negligible hemolysis (less than 1%) even after 2 hrs of<br>
contact with blood.<br>
Experiment 6:<br>
In-vivo anesthetic efficacy<br>
In-vivo anesthetic efficacy was carried out to test anesthetic power of the developed<br>
Propofol formulations. The efficacy of developed formulations was compared with<br>
marketed Propofol emulsion (Propovan™, Bharat Serums Pvt Ltd., Mumbai).<br>
Adult female Wistar rats with body mass of 200-250 g, were obtained from Hafflcins<br>
Institute, Mumbai at the beginning of the experiments. Rats were maintained under an<br>
artificial 12 h light-dark cycle (lights on from 08:00 to 20:00 h) and at a constant<br>
temperature of 23 ± 2°C and 65% humidity. Food and water were freely available, and the<br>
animals were acclimatized for &gt;7 days before use. Experiments were performed between<br>
08:00 and 14:00 h. Animal care and handling throughout the experimental procedure<br>
were performed in accordance to the CPCSEA guidelines. The experimental protocol was<br>
approved by the Animal Ethical Committee of the Bombay College of Pharmacy. Rats<br>
were injected intravenously (single bolus in the lateral tail vein) with the different<br>
formulations of Propofol, each containing equimolar concentration of Propofol [10<br>
mg/(ml kg)]. For intravenous administration, animals were restrained in an appropriate<br>
plexiglass cage and a tail vein was used. Following the drug administration, rats (six per<br>
treatment group) were observed for the following 60 min, and the onset and duration of<br>
loss of the righting reflex (LORR) were recorded. The duration of LORR, expressed as<br>
mean ± S.D. was subjected to statistical analysis. The statistical significance of<br>
differences in the duration of LORR data were analyzed utilizing analysis of variance<br>
(ANOVA) followed by Dunnet's test (GraphPad InStat Demo Version). Differences were<br>
considered statistically significant at P 
15<br><br>
The results of the in vivo anesthetic efficacy test are shown below in table 1<br>

Experiment 7:<br>
Globule size analysis of cefpodoxime proxetil preconcentrate:<br>
Composition described in example 15, 50 mg was diluted to 50 ml with different dilution<br>
media viz. double distilled water, buffer pH 1.2, buffer pH 3.0 and pH 6.8 buffer. The<br>
mean globule size and size distribution of resulting nanoemulsions was determined using<br>
PCS.<br>
The globule size of all the nanoemulsions was found to be less than 200nm.<br>
