Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a metallic tone compact and a method of forming a metallic tone compact and more particularly to a molding technique for a resin compact which is colored in a metallic tone.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
In the prior art, when a resin compact which is colored in a metallic tone is formed using a die, a matrix resin is mixed with a metallic material such as glass, aluminum flakes or powder. Since the metallic material of aluminum has less effect, especially on the matrix resin of a deep color system, a metallic material such as mainly amorphous glass is often used.<br>
However, when such amorphous glass is used as the metallic material, if a metallic tone compact is formed by injection molding, there are problems that scratches are easily produced with a die, the external appearance of a product deteriorates, and maintenance such as polishing of the die is frequently required.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to enhance a sense of luminance of color in a deep color system by using glass and, at the same time, to decrease the amount of maintenance work on a die.<br>
To attain the above-mentioned object according to the present invention, a metallic tone compact made of resin which is colored in a metallic tone by mixing a matrix resin with a metallic material is provided, characterized in that the metallic material is glass powder around which a resin coating layer with a higher melt temperature than the matrix resin is formed.<br>
According to the present invention, glass powder around which a resin coating layer with a higher melt temperature than a matrix resin is formed is used as a metallic material, and formed using a die.<br><br>
As the glass powder, flat-shaped one may be used.<br>
In this manner, the metallic material provided with the resin coating layer formed around the glass powder is mixed with the matrix resin to form a molding material. As a result, even when the molding material is filled into the die under high pressure, the resin coating layer on the surface of the metallic material serves as a cushioning material and can control problems where even the amorphous glass directly contacts the die, causing scratches on the die.<br>
Also, in resin molding using the die, a weld mark is easily generated at a confluence of the resin as shown in Fig. 2. In particular, when a matrix resin 51 is mixed with a metallic material 52 such as amorphous glass, the weld mark tends to be prominent. However, when a resin coating layer is provided around the glass, it also has an effect that the weld mark is not prominent.<br>
Since the resin coating layer is designed to have a higher melt temperature than the matrix resin, when melted matrix resin is injected into the die, the resin coating layer does not melt and can prevent the glass from becoming exposed.<br>
In this connection, if the material of the matrix resin is ABS or AES, as the molding temperature is 200 - 230^, an acrylic resin and the like of which the melt temperature is over 300^3 are applicable as the resin material for the resin coating layer.<br>
The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a view explaining a metallic material according to the present invention; and<br>
Fig. 2 is a view showing the condition in which a weld mark is generated at a confluence of a resin.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a view explaining a metallic material according to the present invention.<br>
A metallic molding technique according to the present invention is characterized in that when a matrix resin is mixed with a metallic material to form a metallic resin molding, amorphous glass powder is used to obtain a sense of luminance even in the case of the matrix resin of a deep color system, and in this case, scratches cannot be easily produced on a die.<br>
Namely, as shown in Fig. 1, the present metallic material!lMs provided with a resin coating layer{3 Wound a high luminance amorphous glass powder(2.JWhen the metallic material(l)is mixed with the matrix resin and formed by injection molding, the metallic material/ljallows the resin coating layer (3 )o serve as a cushioning material to prevent the die from causing scratches.<br>
A result of an evaluation test for die scratches will now be described.<br>
A copolymer resin of styrene system (with the brand name EXCELOY HMX850) is used as a matrix resin. A molding material in which 0-15% of the present metallic material (l^is mixed with the matrix resin was provided for long-run molding of 2,000 shots at a cylinder temperature of 230*0 and under an injection pressure of 80kgs/cm2. Visual external inspection was carried out on the moldings after 2,000 shots.<br>
Referring to the metallic material(l^ the high luminance glass 2 has a mean thickness of 4 fi and a mean diameter of 45 M, while the resin coating layer 3 is an acrylic resin and has a mean thickness of 0.1 li.<br>
Further, the melt temperature of the resin coating layer 3 of this acrylic resin is over 300*0 and adhesive properties of the coating exhibit almost 100% bonding strength until near 280^.<br>
As a result, any external change of the moldings could not be found after<br><br>
2,000 shots and it was also confirmed that no scratches were generated on the die.<br>
Under these circumstances, it is expected that maintenance such as polishing of the die can be decreased compared with the prior art.<br>
Further, problems generally result in the molding material in which the metallic material is mixed, such as a weld mark at a confluence of the resin within the die. However, when the present metallic material 1 is used, it was also confirmed that the weld mark was not prominent.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is not limited to a specific embodiment stated above. It is therefore apparent that numerous changes and modifications having substantially the same structure as and the same action and effect as the matters defined in the appended claims of the present invention belong to the technical scope of the present invention.<br>
For example, the kind and the like of the matrix resin are optional, and the kind and the like of the resin coating can be optionally combined if they are above the melt temperature of the matrix resin.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, the metallic tone compact made of resin which is colored in a metallic tone by mixing a matrix resin with a metallic material is provided, in which glass powder around which a resin coating layer with a higher melt temperature than the matrix resin is formed is used as the metallic material. Thus, the resin coating layer can control problems whereby the die is damaged.<br>
The present invention also has a secondary effect that makes it difficult to<br>
generate a weld mark at a confluence of the resin.<br>
