The reaction is preferably effected in an inert solvent, if necessary, in the presence of a suitable dehydrating agent.<br>
Examples of the dehydrating agent which can be used are dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide, and dialkyl (e.g., C1-C4) azodicarboxylates (e.g., diethylazodicarboxylate, diisopropylazodicarboxylate)-trialkyl (e.g., C5-C20) phosphineor triarylphosphine (e.g., triphenyJphosphine, trioctyJphosphine, tribulylphosphine).<br>
Examples of the solvent which can be used are hydrocarbons such as benzene, xylene and toluene; ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydro-furan and dioxane; and haiogenated hydrocarbons such as carbon tetrachloride, dichloro-methane, chlcrobenzene and dichlorobenzene.<br>
The reaaion temperature is usually set within the range of -SO"C to 2CX)°C or the boiling point of a solvent used in the reaction.<br>
The molar ratio of the materials and dehydrating agents to be used in the reaction can be freely determined, but it is favorable to effect the reaction at an equimolar ratio or a ratio closer thereto.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is subjected to ordinary post-treatments such as organic solvent extraction and concentration, and the desired compound of the present invention can be isolated. Further, purification can be carried out by an ordinary technique such as chromatography, distillation or recrystallization.<br>
(Production Process H for the present compounds wherein Y and Zare both<br><br><br><br>
Examples of the solvent which can be used are ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and cyclohexanone; ethers such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, tetrahydro-furan, dioxane and dialkyi (e.g., C1-C4) ethers (e.g., diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether); N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, sulforane, acetonitrile, nitromethane; halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloro¬form, i ,2-dichloroethane and chlorobenzene; hydrocarbons such as toluene, benzene and xylene; and water. If necessary, a mixture of these solvents can be used.<br><br>
Examples of the base which can be used are hydroxides of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; carbonates of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as lithium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate; hydrides of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as lithium hydride, sodium hydride, potassium hydride and calcium hydride; alkali metal alkoxides (e.g., C^-C^ such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide and potassium tert-butoxide; organic bases such as triethylamine and pyridine. If necessary, catalysts such as ammonium salts (e.g., triethylbenzylammonium chloride) may be added to the reaction system at a ratio of 0.01 to 1 mole per mole of the compound of the general fonnula [XIV].<br>
The reaction temperature is usually set within the range of -20°C to !50°C or the boiling point of a solvent used in the reaction, preferably -5"Cto 100°C or the boiling point of a solvent used in the reaction.<br>
The molar ratio of the starting materials and dehydrating agents to be used in the reaction can be freely determined, but it is favorable to effect the reaction at an equimolar ratio or a ratio closer thereto.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is subjected to ordinary post-treatments such as organic solvent extraction and concentration, and the desired compound of the present invention can be isolated. Further, purification can be earned out by an ordinary technique such as chromatography, distillation or recrystallization.<br>
When the present compound has an asymmetry cari)on atom, it is to be construed to include its optically acrive isomers (C+)-form and (-)-fonn) having biological activity and their mixtures at any ratio. When the present compound exhibits geometrical isomerism, it is to be construed to include its geometrical isomers (cis-form and trans¬form) and their mixtures at any ratio.<br>
The following are typical examples of the present compound (wherein R is as shown in Tables 1 to 46), which are not to be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
