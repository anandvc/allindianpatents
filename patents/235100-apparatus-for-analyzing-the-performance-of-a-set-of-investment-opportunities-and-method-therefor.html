				<td>APPARATUS FOR ANALYZING THE PERFORMANCE<br>
OF A SET OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES<br>
AND METHOD THEREFOR<br>
Cross reference to related applications<br>
The present patent application claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application<br>
60/266,705, Brian A. Hunter, et al., System for selecting portfolio managers, filed 2/06/2001.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for analyzing the performance of a set<br>
of investment opportunities and method therefor, and generally relates to systems" for<br>
presenting information to users in a manner which aids the user in selecting from among<br>
alternatives and more specifically to interactive systems which air investors in selecting<br>
investments that best meet the investor's requirements.<br>
2. Description of related art<br>
The development of networked computing, and of the Interact in particular, has made<br>
life both easier and more difficult for the investor, Life has become easier because it is<br>
easier than ever before to find and retrieve the data that is needed to make Wise<br>
investment decisions and to manipulate the data once it has been retrieved. Life has<br>
become harder because the very plethora of data and the number of ways of<br>
manipulating it complicate the process of turning the data into the information the<br>
investor needs: namely, information which permits the investor to choose wisely<br>
among alternative investment possibilities;<br>
The bases upon which a wise investor chooses his or her investments are return, risk,<br>
and diversity; The investor wants investments which offer a relatively good return at a<br>
relatively low risk and further wants diversity among the risks that his investments are<br>
exposed to, so that circumstances which produce a loss on one investment do not<br>
produce losses on others of the investments. Thus, what the investor needs to choose<br>
wisely is a way of looking at data about individual investment possibilities which<br>
reveals the following for each investment of interest with regard to a period of time:<br>
• the overall return yielded by the investment over the period as compared to a<br>
benchmark of interest;<br>
• the volatilitv of the investment over the period, which provides a measure of its risk:<br>
and<br>
• the resiliency of the investment with regard to market shocks over the period.<br>
What an investor is of course looking for is investments which maximize return and<br>
resiliency while minimizing volatility.<br>
Once the investor has found a number of investments of interest, the investor needs to<br>
look at groups of the possible investments to see how investments in the group relate to<br>
each other from the point of view of diversify of risk. Diversity of risk measures the<br>
degree to which the risks that affect the value of one investment are independent of the<br>
risks that affect another investment. In general, the greater the diversity of risk in a set<br>
of investments, the more secure the value of the entire set of investments is.<br>
What is needed is a single easy-to-use tool which provides the above information to the<br>
investor and provides it in a fashion which makes it easy for the investor to compare the<br>
risks and returns of individual investment possibilities and to see how the investment<br>
possibilities relate to each other with regard to diversity of risk. It is an object of the<br>
invention disclosed herein to provide such a tool.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The tool of the invention analyzes the performance of a set of investment opportunities.<br>
The tool includes an analyzer that analyzes investment performance information<br>
covering a period of time for each investment opportunity of the set and. a graphical user<br>
interface that is usable by a user of the apparatus to control operation of the analyzer<br>
and display results of the analysis. The analyzer operates in a screening mode whose<br>
displayed results permit the user to compare performance of the investment<br>
opportunities and in a fitting mode whose displayed results permit the user to compare<br>
performance of pairs of the investment opportunities with regard to diversity of risk.<br>
In further aspects of the invention, the analyzer computes the Hunter Ratio, a pseudo-<br>
reliability metric, for each of the investment opportunities in the set and a Blend<br>
Anxiety metric for pairs of the investment opportunities. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
the analyzer computes the Hunter Ratio in the screening mode and the Blend Anxiety' in<br>
the fitting mode. In the preferred embodiment, the Blend Anxiety of a pair of<br>
investment opportunities is the covariance of the pair's performance.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the tool can be used for a method of investment<br>
analysis in which the investment opportunities are first analyzed to determine their<br>
Hunter Ratios and pairs of the investment opportunities are then analyzed to determine<br>
their Blend Anxiety.<br>
The tool's graphical user interface further permits the user to select a subset of the<br>
potential investment opportunities and to do so according to asset olasses of the<br>
potential investment opportutumties The user can also select a set of operations to be<br>
performed on the investment performance information by the analyzer and a portion of<br>
the period of time for which the investment performance information is available. The<br>
operations will be performed on the investment performance information for the<br>
selected portion of the period of time. The user can further select subsets of the<br>
investors from which the pairs for which the Blend Anxiety is computed are taken,<br>
Results of the analysis are output to spreadsheets which can be manipulated in the<br>
customary fashion by the user.<br>
Other objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the arts to which the<br>
invention pertains upon perusal of the following Detailed Description and drawing,<br>
wherein:<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The following Derailed Description will begin with an overview of the tool as it appears<br>
to the user and will then describe an implementation of the tool.<br>
Functional overview of the tool; FIG. 1<br>
The tool is implemented in a standard computer system, with a standard graphical user<br>
interface (GUI) in which the output is a display on a display device such as a CRT and<br>
inputs to active areas on the display are made using a keyboard and a pointing and<br>
selection device such as a mouse, The user can do three things with the tool:<br>
• select asset classes and investment opportunities belonging to the asset classes to be<br>
investigated and benchmarks and time periods to be used in the investigation; an<br>
asset class is to be understood in the present context as any set of investment<br>
opportunities which share a common characteristic, including belonging to a<br>
particular investment strategy; benchmarks are measures such as the rate of return<br>
on U.S. bonds against which other investments are compared;<br>
• screen the investment opportunities by seeing how they compare according to<br>
various measures of investment value for the selected benchmarks and time periods;<br>
and<br>
• fit investment opportunities to see the extent to which they increase the diversity of<br>
risk in a set of investment possibilities and therefore reduce the overall risk of the<br>
set.<br>
FIG. 1 is a flowchart 101 which shows operation of the tool at the level just described.<br>
A user starts using the tool at 103, and the tool executes loop 105 until the user desires<br>
to stop. At any point in his or her use of the tool,, the user has the choice to perform<br>
activities belonging to one of three general classes, as shown by case statement 107:<br>
• In selection branch 109, editing the general parameters which determine the asset<br>
classes and investment opportunities to be investigated, the benchmarks, and the<br>
time period (111).<br>
• Id screening branch 113, the following activities:<br>
editing screening parameters including output fields, output calculations to be<br>
performed to produce additional output fields, and time periods for the output<br>
calculations (117);<br>
doing the output calculations; and<br>
displaying the output fields.<br>
• In fitting branch 121, the following activities:<br>
editing fitting parameters that determine which investment opportunities are<br>
compared which each other for diversity of risk (123);<br>
doing the fitting calculations (125); and<br>
- displaying the fitting results (127).<br>
In general, a user of the tool will proceed as follows: having selected asset classes,<br>
investments belonging to the asset classes, periods of time, and output calculations of<br>
interest in selection branch 109 and having used screening branch 113 to see the<br>
performance of the selected investment opportunities, the user will select a promising<br>
subset of the investment opportunities that were screened in screening branch 113 for<br>
fitting in fitting branch 121 to see. what the diversity of risk offered by the investments<br>
in the promising subset is. The user may: then use the diversity of risk in making his or<br>
her final selections from among the investments originally selected in selection branch<br>
109.<br>
Details of the tool as seen by the user<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the investment opportunities that the user is comparing are<br>
managed investment funds; in the user interface, these managed investment funds are<br>
termed managers. It is, however, important to note that the operations performed by the<br>
tool could be performed with regard to any investment opportunity for which data is<br>
available which is analogous to that used in the present invention to analyze fund<br>
managers.<br>
Windows for select branch 109 Figs. 2 and 3<br>
When a user begins using the tool, the first window encountered is window 201 shown<br>
in FIG. 2. In terms of FIG. 1, window 201 belongs to branch 109. Window 201 permits<br>
the user to specify managers and benchmarks to be used in evaluating the selected<br>
managers. Tab control 203 allows the user to switch between manager and benchmark<br>
views (205). Manager view 203 includes a list 204 of managers; individual managers in<br>
the list may be selected using the check boxes to the left of the list entries. The buttons<br>
at 215 permit the user to select all managers in list 204 or to clear all managers in list<br>
204, "Select Asset Class" dropdown 202 allows the user to filter the list by asset class;<br>
when an asset class is selected, only the managers who manage investments belonging<br>
to that asset class appear in list 204. The "All" option shows all managers for which the<br>
tool has performance data. Tab 207 is the Assign Benchmark tab. When a manager is<br>
selected from list 204, it is added to list 208 of manager-benchmark pairs. The manager<br>
will then be screened against the selected benchmark Clicking "Set" button 210 in a<br>
list entry in list 208 will update all managers selected for the benchmark with the<br>
information for the benchmark defined in that row. As will be explained in more detail<br>
latet, period tab 209 permits the user to specify an analysis period for the screening<br>
and/or fitting, tab 211 selects the whidow for. the screening operation, and tab 213<br>
selects the window for the fitting operation.<br>
FIG. 3 shows window 301 of branch 109 with a detailed view of tab 209 which the user<br>
employs to determine the period of time to be used in the screening and/or fitting<br>
analyses of the managers selected in tab 203 with regard to the benchmarks selected<br>
with regard to tab 207. The available options are:<br>
• All 303 - all reported periods for each selected manager;<br>
• Maximum common periods across selected managers 305 — the timeframe is limited<br>
to the maximum intervals that all selected managers share<br>
• Last 307 - The time period is limited to the most recent entered yeais/months (e.g. 6<br>
months, 3 years, etc.)<br>
• Custom Period 311 - User may enter any time period. A start date for the period<br>
can be specified, or the user may choose "From Inception" (313). Similarly, the<br>
user may also specify an ending date, or choose "Last Reported" (315).<br>
Windows for screening branch ! 13: Figs. 4-6<br>
FIG 4 shows window 401 that appears when the user selects screenig tab 211This<br>
tab corresponds to block 115 in flowchart 101. It permits the user to further define a<br>
screening operation that uses the managers, benchmark, and time period selected using<br>
screens 201 and 301. Using tab 211, the user may define the fields he or she wishes to<br>
appear in the display produced for the results of the screening operation and may also<br>
specify that the screening operation be performed. Beginning at 403, that portion of tab<br>
211 provides checkboxes which permit the user to select a number of fields to appear in<br>
the output. Portion 405 permits the user to select operations from a list 407 of<br>
operations. When an operation is selected, a field containing the results of the operation<br>
appeais in the display produced for the results of the screening operation. When the<br>
user has finished setting up the scan using screen 401, the user clicks on button 417 to<br>
start the scan.<br>
Continuing with details of portion 403, the start date, end date, and # of months check<br>
boxes cause fields to be produced with time expressions as determined by the settings of<br>
time tab 209. The values that appear in the remaining fields are defined relative to the<br>
value of the benchmark that was assigned using tab 207. The values are calculated as<br>
follows:<br>
• % Benchmark Upside - Calculated as (Total Positive Retums)/(Total Positive<br>
Benchmark Returns)<br>
• % Benchmark Downside - Calculated as (Total Negative Returns) / (Total<br>
Negative Benchmark Returns)<br>
• Benchmark Up/Down Ratio - Calculated as (% Benchmark Upside) / (%<br>
Benchmark Downside)<br>
• % Periods w/ Gain — Calculated as (Number of periods w/ positive returns) / (Total<br>
number of periods)<br>
• Average Gain To Loss - Calculated as (Sum of positive returns/Number of positive<br>
returns)<br>
Output calculations portion 405 permits the user to specify calculations that are to be<br>
performed using the data for the selected managers and benchmarks. The output<br>
calculations are selected using subwindow 407, which permits selection of the<br>
calculation (409), the period over which it is to run (411). and the format 413 in which it<br>
is to be displayed. Button 415 permits the user to customize the calculation period.<br>
Only a single output calculation, the Hunter Ratio, is specified at 407; however, the<br>
output calculations which may be specified using window portion 405 include the<br>
following in the preferred embodiment: the Sharps ratio, rolling returns, drawdown,<br>
standard deviation, and the Hunter ratio. More than one such calculation may be<br>
specified for a given screening. With the exception of the Hunter ratio, these<br>
calculations are well known. All of these calculations employ rolling returns for the<br>
manager and/or the benchmark. The rolling return is calculated as follows:<br>
Rolling Returns - the rolling return for the analysis period;<br>
For each return, in series<br>
Rolling Return = Rolling Return * (1 + Period Return)<br>
Total Return = Rolling Return - 1<br>
Next<br>
In summary, the calculations are performed as follows:<br>
• Drawdown - Ratio of the series to the series benchmark over a defined period of<br>
market volatility: (Rolling Return for period) / (Rolling Benchmark Return for<br>
period)<br>
• Sharpe Ratio - Calculated as:<br>
Period Rolling Return - Period T-Bill Rolling Return<br>
Standard Deviation(Period Returns)<br>
• Hunter Ratio - The average of alln-period Sharpe ratios divided by the standard<br>
deviation of all n-period Sharpe ratios for a series. Calculated as:<br>
Average(Sharpe Ratio over n periods)/StdDev(Sharpe Ratio over n periods)<br>
Computation of the standard deviation is too well known to require further explanation.<br>
The Hunter Ratio is a novel metric. It reflects a manager's performance persistence over<br>
time while minimizing period selection bias. It thus provides a notion of the manager's<br>
reliability without the computational requirements of reliability measurements such as<br>
those described in PCT/US01/00636, Hunter, et al., Resource allocation techniques,<br>
filed 9 January 2001. For this reason, the Hunter Ratio is termed a pseudo-reliability<br>
measure. The Hunter Ratio is measured over a minimum of 3 year rolling periods from<br>
inception of a manager's performance and becomes more statistically valid at 5 and 7<br>
year rolling periods.<br>
Coupling the Hunter Ratio with the other statistics produced in screening adds still more<br>
perspective. For example, we can screen over shorter term convulsive periods pertinent<br>
to the asset class of the managers being screened and use drawdown to take a snapshot<br>
of how each manager looks under the microscope of disaster periods. The Hunter Ratio<br>
and drawdown together give a unique picture of the likelihood of a manager to weather<br>
both the worst market storms and more moderate intermittent market pressures and at<br>
the same time deliver an absolute upside at a margin above both competitors and a<br>
relevant benchmark for the asset class in question.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a number of subwindows that are used with window 401 to further<br>
configure screening. Subwindow 501 appears when button 415 is: clicked on for the<br>
Hunter Ratio eutry in list 407; it permits the user to define one or more periods over<br>
which the Hunter Ratio is to be calculated; Subwindow 503 appears when button 415 is<br>
clicked for any of the other output calculations; it permits the user to specify that the<br>
analysis period indicated on period tab 209 be used or to specify one or more special<br>
analysis periods for the computation. The special periods may be specified in the same<br>
way as time periods on period tab 209. The results of the calculation for each of the<br>
time periods selected for the Hunter Ratio or the other computations will appear in a<br>
separate field in the spreadsheet. Where the calculation involves a benchmark, it is the<br>
benchmark selected using tab 207. Subwindow 505 appears after the user clicks on<br>
start screening button 417. It permits the user to specify the order in which tire fields<br>
will appear in the rows of the spreadsheet that is the result of the screening operations.<br>
The vertical order of the fields in subwindow 50d becomes the left-to-right order-of the<br>
fields in the spreadsheet row.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the results of the calculations specified using screening tab<br>
211 on the managers and benchmark specified using tabs 203 and 205 for the period<br>
specifed using tab 209 are output to a spreadsheet FIG 6 shows the spredsheet as it<br>
appears where the user has specified a.benchmark'and four managers. Spreadsheet 601<br>
has two worksheets, one, identified by tab 609, which shows the results of screening,<br>
and one, identified by tab 611, which shows the results of fitting. In spreadsheet 601,<br>
the user has selected tab 609. The spreadsheet has a row 605 in table 603 for each of<br>
the selected managers. The fields in the row correspond to those selected using tab 211;<br>
they are ordered as the user specifies in subwindow 505 (note, however, that the order<br>
actually shown in subwindow 505 was: not used for spreadsheet 601). Header 607 has<br>
the titles of the fields. Any of the usual spreadsheet operations can of course be<br>
performed on table 603, including sorting the rows according to the values in a selected<br>
field. Here, as shown at 613, the rows have been sorted by the value of the Hunter<br>
Ratio.<br>
Windows for fitting branch 121: Figs. 7 and 8<br>
The fitting operation compares pairs of managers from the point of view of diversity of<br>
risk. This is done by computing the correlation and the covariance for the returns of the<br>
pair, The greater the diversity of risk, the lower the correlation and covariance for the<br>
pair. The advantage of computing the covariance in addition to the correlation is that<br>
covariance is a more powerful indicator of diversification. It is more powerful because<br>
it measures diversification and ths impact of the blending of the volatilities of the<br>
two managers. Mathematically, the covariance is the product of the correlation<br>
coefficients of the two managers multiplied by their respective standard deviations. So,<br>
you can have two highly volatile managers in two very different asset classes and if the<br>
correlation is, near zero then they may very well be an excellent fit or, vice versa, a high<br>
correlation where the managers are less volatile can result in a very poor combination<br>
that yields a lot of investor anxiety when both deliver large negative returns at the same<br>
time. It is this relationship between the covariance and investor anxiety which has lead<br>
the developers of. the present invention to use the term Blend Anxiety in their user<br>
interface. Other measures of Blend Anxiety may be used in other embodiments of the<br>
tool. One such measure is provided by the investment allocation techniques described<br>
in PCT/US01/00636, cited above.<br>
FIG. 7 shows window 701, in which the details of fitting tab 213 can be seen. Fitting<br>
tab 213 permits the user to select two groups of managers upon which the fitting<br>
operation will be performed. One group is termed the x axis group and the other is<br>
termed the y axis group. Each member of the x axis group is fitted to each member of<br>
the y axis group. The fitting operation is done over a period that is specified using tab<br>
209.<br>
The groups of managers are selected from the set of managers that was previously<br>
specified using tab 203. When the user selects fitting tab 213, tire managers that were<br>
previously selected at 204 appear in selected items field 703. Buttons 709 and 711 can<br>
be used to move the managers in field 703 between that field and x-axis field 705,<br>
which lists the managers currently selected for the x-axis group. The equivalent buttons<br>
for y-axis field 707 can be used to move managers between field 703 and y-axis field<br>
707, which lists the managers currently selected for the y-axis group. Managers can be<br>
ordered within field 705 by using buttons 713, and the same can be done within field<br>
707 using the equivalent buttons there. Clicking on preview button 715 provides a<br>
preview of the arrangement of the spreadsheet that will be produced by the fitting<br>
operation, while clicking on start fitting button 717 begins the fitting operation on the<br>
selected X axis group and Y axis group.<br>
FIG. 8 shows the spreadsheet worksheet 801 that results from the fitting operation.<br>
Worksheet 801 appears when the user selects tab 611. In this case, worksheet S01<br>
shows the result of applying the fitting operation to an X-axis group 806 of three<br>
managers and a Y-axis group 802 of six managers. The fitting operation is for the time<br>
period specified at 811. In general, each member of (he Y axis group has a row 803 in<br>
the spreadsheet; each member of the X axis group has two fields 805 in each of the<br>
rows. The contents of the fields for a given X axis manager in the row belonging to a<br>
given Y axis manager are the correlation coefficient and the covarianee values for the<br>
pair made up of the given X axis manager and the given Y axis manager. In row 803,<br>
field 807 contains the correlation coefficient and field 809 contains the covariance<br>
value. In the display, they are termed "Diversity" (Div) and "Blend Anxiety" (BA).<br>
The arrangement shown in window 801 makes it easy for users of the tool to understand<br>
how two investment possibilities relate to each otherwith regard to diversity of risk.<br>
Measuring reliability of combinations of potential investments<br>
Together, the Hunter Ration and Blend Anxiety provide users of the tool with a way of<br>
measuring" the reliability of combinations of potential investments. As indicated above,<br>
the Hunter Ratio reflects a manager's performance persistence over time, and thus<br>
measures reliability of a manager. Thus, in order to find reliable combinations of<br>
managers, the user can first screen the managers in question to determine their Hunter<br>
Ratios, and then fit pairs of managers with acceptable Hunter Ratios. The pairs with<br>
the be?st Fits make up a set of managers which cap then be further analyzed using the<br>
resource allocation techniques described in PCT/US01/0Q636, cited above.<br>

includes copy databases 917 and 919. Copy database 917 contains a copy of data from<br>
benchmark data 903 and copy database 919 contains a copy of data from manager data<br>
905. The copies 917 and 919 are obtained by downloading via Internet 907 from<br>
databases 903 and 905. In a preferred embodiment, benchmark database 903 is a<br>
commercial database provided" by Ibbotson Associates and manager data 905 is the<br>
commercial Plan Sponsor Network database, provided by Effron. ProFiler database 921<br>
is a Microsoft® Access database made by Microsoft Corporation.<br>
When the ProFiler is operating, profiler database 921 contains benchmark information<br>
from database 917 and manager information from database 919 and may also contain<br>
further manager itifoirnatiuii provided by users of iue ProFiler. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, data base 921 is implemented in a Microsoft® Access database system.<br>
Server processor 909 further includes ProFiler server side application program 911,<br>
which performs those parts of the operation of the ProFiler which are done on server<br>
processor 909 and analysis engine 913, which is the part of application program 911<br>
which does the calculations necessary to produce the output spread sheets. Server-side<br>
application program 911 is hosted in OS host services program 915, which provides<br>
application program 911 with middleware services such as connection pooling, instance<br>
management, and threading. In a preferred embodiment, server processor 909 is<br>
running under the Microsoft Windows 2000 Server operating system and OS host<br>
services 915 is embodied as "Windows Component;Services.<br>
Client processor 925 is a standard PC running a Microsoft Windows operating system.<br>
The operating system provides a GUI which is displayed on monitor 929 and receives<br>
inputs from mouse 931 and keyboard 933, Also included in client processor 925 is an<br>
Excel spreadsheet program which manipulates profiler spreadsheets 923. ProFiler<br>
client-side application 927 receives inputs from and provides outputs to the GUI and<br>
also provides result data received from server-side application 911 to pro filer<br>
spreadsheets 923.<br>
Prior to commencing operation of the profiler, a manager of server processor 909<br>
downloads copy 917 of benchmark data from database 903 and copy 919 of manager<br>
data from database 905. When a user at client processor 925 begins execution of<br>
profiler client-side application 927, server-side application 911 provides initial window<br>
201; after the user has selected managers, a benchmark, a period, and the screening<br>
operation, and for the screening operation, the results fields to be output and the<br>
operations to be performed, server-aide application 911 responds to these inputs when<br>
the user clicks on start screening button 417 by copying the data for the selected<br>
managers and benchmark for the selected period from databases 917 and 919 to<br>
database 921. Analysis engine 913 then performs the specified operations and outputs<br>
the results to client-side application program 927, which incorporates them into the<br>
screening worksheet of the ProFiler spreadsheet in spreadsheets 923, The user of client<br>
processor 925 can then use Excel to manipulate the spreadsheet in the usual fashion.<br>
If tire user instead selects the fitting operation, the- user may again select managers and a<br>
time period and can also assign managers to either the X-axis group or the Y-axis group.<br>
When the user has done these things using window 701 and clicks on start fitting button<br>
717. analysis engine 913 computes the correlation coefficient and the covariance for<br>
each possible pairing of a manager from the X-axis group with a manager from the Y-<br>
axis group and outputs the results to client-side application program 927, which<br>
incorporates them into the fitting workshop of the PrdFilet Spreadsheet in spreadsheets<br>
923. Again, the user of client processor 925 can then use Excel to manipulate the<br>
spreadsheet in the usual fashion.<br>
