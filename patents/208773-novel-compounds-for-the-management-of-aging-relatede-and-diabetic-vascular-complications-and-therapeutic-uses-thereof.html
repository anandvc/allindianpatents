				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a new class of compounds of pyridinium series and to their use in treatment of diabetes and related illnesses. More particularly the invention relates to compounds of this series, methods for their<br>
15 preparation, pharmaceutical composition containing these compounds and their use in the treatment of complications of diabetes mellitus. The compounds of this series exhibit AGE breaking activity, which is essential for the treatment of diabetic and aging-related complications including kidney disease, nerve damage, atherosclerosis, retinopathy and dermatological conditions. The invention also<br>
20 extends to the method of reversing the discoloration of teeth resulting from nonenzymatic browning in the oral cavity which comprises administration of an amount effective to reverse pre-formed advanced glycosylation crosslinks.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
25 Maillard in 1912 found that reducing sugars, such as glucose and ribose<br>
react with proteins to form brown pigments. Further studies have shown that this<br>
is an irreversible non-enzymatic reaction, which occurs in several natural systems including stored foodstuff. Maillard reaction occurs in two stages, early and advanced. Initially, proteins react with glucose to form stable Amadori products, which subsequently cross-links to form advanced glycation end products (AGE). In most cases, the formation of AGE also accompanies browning of the proteins<br>
 and increase in the fluorescence.<br>
In diabetes, where blood glucose level is significantly higher than normal, the reaction of glucose with several proteins such as haemoglobin, lens crystallin and collagen, gives rise to the formation of AGE, which in turn, is responsible for the complications associated with diabetes, such as nephropathy,<br>
microangiopathy, endothelial dysfunction and other organ dysfunctions. In addition, the activity of several growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor, is also impaired. AGE products, unlike normal proteins in tissue, have a slower rate of turnover and replenishment. It has been reported that AGE products may in fact elicit a complex immunological reaction involving RAGE<br>
(Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products) receptors and activation of several incompletely defined immunological processes. It has been documented that diabetes with evidence of microangiopathy and macroangiopathy also show evidence of oxidative stress, the mechanism of which has not been elucidated.<br>
In vitro AGE formation can be studied in the laboratory by incubating<br>
reducing sugars, such as ribose or glucose with bovine serum albumin. AGE formation can be detected by increase in the fluorescence or increased cross reactivity with anti-AGE antibodies. The increase in fluorescence seems to precede formation of AGE specific antigenic epitopes. This increase in fluorescence is used to monitor the increased AGE formation in vitro (Brownlee<br>
M et al, Science 1986; 232:1629-1632). In addition to the increase in the fluorescence, one of the most important features of in vitro AGE formation is the formation of antigenic epitopes that are specific to AGE and not to the native proteins. Therefore, it is possible to raise antibodies against advanced glycation end products of one protein and use them to detect AGE formation in other<br>
is proteins. This has served as an important analytical tool in AGE research.<br>
Due to the clinical significance of AGE formation, many approaches are being used to diagnose, prevent, or revert AGE formation in the body. The formation of AGE could be inhibited by reacting with an early glycosylation product that results from the original reaction between the target protein and<br>
20 glucose. The inhibition was believed to take place as the reaction between the inhibitor and the early glycosylation product appeared to interrupt the subsequent reaction of the glycosylated protein with additional protein material to form the cross linked late stage product. Compounds like aminoguanidine act to inhibit AGE formation by such mechanism.<br>
 The formation of AGE on long-lived proteins is also associated with cross-<br>
linking of these proteins. The AGE derived protein cross-links have been shown to be cleaved by compounds like N- phenacyl thiazolium bromide (PTB), which reacts with and cleaves covalent, AGE derived protein cross links (Vasan et al. Nature 1996; 382: 275-278 ; US 5,853,703, Date of Patent : Dec. 29, 1998). The 10 mechanism of reducing the AGE content in tissues is expected to take place relatively rapidly, in contrast to aminoguanidine, which acts slowly by its very nature of mechanism of action. This current specification is related to compounds of pyridinium class, which break pre-formed AGE, like PTB, and in some cases even more effectively by than PTB.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a new class of compounds of the pyridinium series which are useful for the management of diabetes and aging related vascular complications and particularly in the treatment of complications of diabetes mellitus and other aging related conditions including kidney disease, nerve damage, atherosclerosis, retinopathy and dermatological conditions. The invention also extends the method to reverse the discoloration of teeth resulting from nonenzymatic browning in the oral cavity which comprises administration of an amount effective to reverse the pre-formed advanced<br>
 glycosylation crosslinks, etc.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide compounds of the pyridinium series, which exhibit AGE breaking activities.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method of preparation of compounds of the pyridinium series which exhibit AGE breaking activities.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide pharmaceutical<br>
compositions with a new class of compounds of the pyridinium series according<br>
to the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts in combination with<br>
suitable carriers, solvents, excepients, diluents and other media normally<br>
employed in preparing such compositions.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a method of treatment of a diabetic patient by administration of the compounds of the invention, either singly or in combination with drugs for anti-diabetic therapy, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in required dosage in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, solvent, excepients, carriers or other media as may be appropriate for the purpose.<br>

According to the embodiment of the present invention, the present compounds are used for the treatment of diabetic complications, and aging related<br>
complications including kidney disease, nerve damage, atherosclerosis, retinopathy, dermatological conditions and colouration of teeth occurring due to the higher levels of preformed AGE. The increased levels of preformed AGE can be brought under control by breaking the AGE products using compounds mentioned in the invention.<br>
 The invention also provides a process for the preparation of novel<br>
compounds of the pyridinium series.<br>
The said process for the preparation of compound 1, comprises, adding a solution of phenacyl bromide in isopropanol to N,N"-bis-(nicotinyl)hydrazine dissolved in methanol, refluxing for six hours, cooling, filtering the precipitated<br>
 solid, washing the solid with hot ethyl acetate and finally purifying the solid with 20 ml of methanol: ethyl acetate (3 : 1) to yield the desired compound.<br>
Similarly, the other novel compounds of general formula I, are prepared from properly substituted pyridine derivatives followed by quarternization with appropriate reagent by refluxing in alcoholic solvents like, methanol, ethanol,<br>
 propanol, etc and high boiling solvents like toluene or xylene etc, for 6-48 hrs. to give the desired compounds.<br>
The in vitro AGE formation, studied in the laboratory, by incubating reducing sugar ribose, with protein bovine serum albumin, resulted in browning of solution and increase in the fluorescence. Fluorescence was used as the criteria to<br><br>
5 monitor the increased AGE formation. Example 1<br>
AGE breaker activity has been confirmed by the screening procedure as mentioned below:<br>
Materials: Bovine serum albumin (fraction V) (BSA)<br>
Ribose, analytical grade<br>
Phosphate buffered saline (PBS)<br>
Equipment:<br>
Microplate ELISA Reader - Spectramax Plus (Molecular Devices, USA) 15 Microplate washer, (Bio -Tec Instruments, USA)<br>
pH meter<br>
Methods of experiment:<br>
160 mg/ml of protein, bovine serum albumin, BSA and 1.6M glucose sugar<br>
were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline, PBS. Sodium azide was added at 20 0.02% concentration as a preservative. The solution was filtered asceptically<br>
through a 0.22 µM filter and kept for aging at 37°C for 16 weeks. After 16 weeks<br>
the solution was dialyzed against PBS, aliquoted and stored at - 20°C.<br>
To determine the AGE breaking activity, 10µg/ml and lOOµg/ml of the 16<br>
weeks AGE-BSA was incubated with different concentrations of the test<br>
15<br>
compounds at 37°C for 24 hours and AGE breaking activity of the test compounds by ELISA was determined. ELISA was performed as follows:<br>
1. Different concentrations of 16 weeks AGE-BSA were coated on a microtitre plate as standard. Each concentration is coated in triplicates.<br>
 2. The test samples were coated on microtitre plate at a concentration of 5 ng. to 20 ng per well in triplicates.<br>
3. The plate was incubated at 37°C for one hour.<br>
4. After incubation the plate was washed with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20).<br>
5. Blocking with 5% skimmed milk in PBS at 37°C for one hour was done.<br>
6. The plate was washed with PBST.<br>
7. Primary antibody against AGE-BSA was added and the plate is incubated at 37°C for one hour.<br>
8. The plate was washed with PBST<br>
20 9. Secondary antibody anti rabbit HRPO (Horse-Radish Per Oxidase) conjugate was added and the plate is incubated at 37°C for one hour. 10. The plate was washed with PBST.<br>
11. Colour development with OPD (orthophenylenediamine dihydrochloride) and hydrogen peroxide was done.<br>
i<br>
16<br>
5 12. OD (optical density) at (450nm reading - 620nm reading) was measured after incubation at 37°C for 15 minutes with Microplate ELISA Reader.<br>
The breaker activity of the compounds were determined by the following formula:<br>
% Breaker activity = OD450-620Control - OD450-20Test ------------------------------------------- x 100<br>
OD450-620Control<br>
OD450-620Control= Absorbance of 20ng AGE-BSA after incubation at 37°C for 24 hours without test compound<br>
OD450-620 Test= Absorbance of 20ng AGE-BSA after incubation at 37°C for 24 hours with required concentration of test compound<br>
Using specific examples, the % AGE breaking activity was calculated and<br>
recorded in Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br>
Hence compound 6 has significant AGE breaking activity i.e. a comparatively<br>
much superior potency vis-a-vis PTB.<br>
The following examples give method of preparation of the specific novel<br>
compounds of the invention as given in Table 1. The following compounds 10 suggested are by way of example alone and in no way restrict the invention.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of N,N"-bis [3-carbonvl-l- (2-phenyl-2-oxoethvD pyridiniumf<br>
hvdrazine dibromide (compound 1):<br>
To a boiling solution of N,N"-bis-(nicotinyl)hydrazine (1.21 g., 0.005 mol.) in methanol (20 ml.), a solution of phenacyl bromide (1.99 g., 0.01 mol.) in<br>
isopropanol (10 ml.) was added and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 6 hrs.<br>
The reaction mixture was concentrated under vacuum (~10 ml.) and filtered. The<br>
obtained residue was washed with hot ethylacetate and then the isolated solid was<br>
powdered. It was recrystallised from a mixture of methanol and ethylacetate (3:1, 20 20 ml) to afford a pale yellow solid.<br>
