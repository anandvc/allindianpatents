				<td>Device for increasing the Density of Laser Prints<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1) FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a printing mechanism, more particularly, lo a device for increasing the density of all kinds of laser prints.<br>
2) DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
In the procedure of a plate making for printing, it is necessary to make typesetting and image of an original into a film. However, the black color from the existing laser printer is not dark enough due to the quality of printer and toner, thereby fail to make a plate for printing. Therefore, either the conventional technique using a reproduction camera or the contemporary way adapts an exclusive computer - image setter - to output a positive or negative film in order for plate making. (For exposing images to the printing plate.) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention aims to solve the problems of necessarily making a typesetting and image into a film first, in the procedure of a plate making, not having dark enough density on the image area printed by laser printer due to<br>
the quality of a printer and quantity of the toner, thereby fail to make a plate for printing. Although the contemporary technique using an image setter to output<br>
1<br>
a film for plate making is getting common, but the price of an image setter is quite expensive. It may be necessary for a printing work to purchase an image setter for making their own film or rely on a trade house to output the film for<br>
them, in order to make plates for printing, but it is really too expensive and the material cost of this special film is also very high. And if by the conventional way, end usershave to invest much more on a reproduction camera and a film processor, most of them need a skillful technician. To solve the said prior art problems, the present invention provides a device for increasing the density of laser prints from a personal computer, comprising a machine, a rolling mechanism and a driving mechanism; wherein a paper inlet and a paper outlet are disposed on said machine; a processing tank for darkening the toner of a laser print is disposed at the lower aspect of said rolling mechanism and said driving mechanism inside the machine; some solvent used by the prior art for darkening the toner is placed inside said processing tank; furthermore, a refill tank connects onto said processing tank for darkening the toner; one end of said<br><br>
refill tank is disposed on an outer lateral side of said machine thereby <br>
 facilitating a user to refill said solvent from outside of the device. Said rolling<br>
\ mechanism comprises an upper rolling shaft and a lower rolling shaft; wherein,<br>
said upper rolling shaft is made of soft material while said lower rolling shaft is<br>
made of rigid material; two ends of said upper and lower rolling shafts are<br>
respectively disposed inside shaft holes on two lateral plates; said two lateral plates fix said machine via bolts; one part of said lower shaft immerses in said processing tank for darkening the toner; said rolling mechanism connects with said driving mechanism. Said driving mechanism comprises an electric motor, a driving gear and a driven gear; said electric motor drives said driving gear which further drives said driven gear; the rotating direction of said driving gear opposilcs that of the driven gear; said driving gear and said driven gear respectively and fixedly connect with one of said upper and lower rolling shafts in said rolling mechanism. When said driving mechanism works, a sheet of paper rolls through between said upper and lower rolling shafts; said solvent inside said processing tank for darkening the toner conducts the darkening procedure. Said machine comprises a front case and a rear case; said two cases fix together via bolts; said paper inlet is disposed on said front case; said paper outlet is disposed on said rear case; an electric on-and-off switch is disposed on said machine. The working procedure of the present invention is that, after image area are printed onto the translucent tracing paper from a laser printer, the tracing paper is fed through the device of the present invention for darkening the toner of the image area; said tracing paper is placed in said paper inlet area; activating said on-and-off switch makes said driving mechanism drive said upper and lower rolling shafts to rotate. At this time, said two rolling<br>
shafts roll the sheet of paper located in said paper inlet area into said machine. Since some part of said lower rolling shaft immerses inside said processing tank for darkening the toner, said toner darkening solvent contacts the paper and darkens image area covered by the toner along the rolling of said lower rolling shaft; then the image darkened tracing paper is sent out from said paper outlet, after drying it which works directly as a film ready for plate printing.<br>
The present invention corresponds to the prior art. Since said processing tank<br><br>
for darkening the toner is disposed at the lower aspect of said rolling<br>
mechanism, the present invention utilizes the solvent used by the prior art for darkening the toner to darken the image area directly and evenly on said tracing<br>
paper thereby solving the problem of having uneven darkening result obtained in the traditional darkening operation by hand painting or by spray, and saving the expenses for film and other auxiliary equipment; in addition, said device for increasing the density of laser prints is easy, economic and convenient to operate by an average person.<br>
To enable a further understanding of achieving the above mentioned objectives and effectiveness, the technical contents of the present invention is described by the brief description of the drawings and the detailed description<br>
of a preferred embodiment.<br>
