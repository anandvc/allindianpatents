CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is based on provisional application USSN 60/195,090 and a continuation-in-part of L'SSN 09/216.787 (entitled '"High Energy Phototherapeutic Agents"), filed on December 21. 1998, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entiretv.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to certain radiodense medicaments and methods for treatment of human or animal tissue using such medicaments in combination with radiation therapy, wherein these radiodense medicaments serve as radiosensitizers in high energy phototherapy. The inventors of the present invention have found that such medicaments are useful for treatment of a variety of conditions affecting the skin and related organs, the mouth and digestive tract and related organs, the urinary and reproductive tracts and related organs, the respiratory tract and related organs, the circulatory system and related organs,  the head and neck,  the  endocrine and lymphoreticular systems and related organs, various other tissues, such as connective tissues and various tissue surfaces exposed during surgery, as well as various tissues exhibiting microbial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection. These medicaments are in various formulations that may include liquid, semisolid, solid or aerosol delivery vehicles, and are suitable for intracorporeal administration via various conventional modes and routes, including intravenous injection (i.v.), intraperitoneal injection (i.p.), intramuscular injection {im.), intracranial injection (i.e.), intratumoral injection (i.r.), intraepithelial injection (i.e.), transcutaneous delivery (tc.), and per oesophageal (p.o.) administration. Irradiation of tissues containing such medicaments with ionizing radiation produces a desirable therapeutic response, such as destruction of microbial infection, reduction or elimination of tissue irritation, reduction or elimination of hyperproliferative tissue, reduction or elimination of cancerous or precancerous tissue, reduction or elimination of surface or subsurface lipocvies or lipid deposits, and many other similar indications.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Diseased tissue or tumors, such as those of cancer, are often treated using high energy, highly penetrating ionizing radiation (i.e., ionizing radiation, or radiation), in a process known as radiation therapy.<br>
Conventional radiation therapy (which typically uses ionizing radiation with energies of I keV or higher) generally works by anacking rapidly growing cells with ionizing radiation. Use of such radiation is attractive due to its ability to penetrate deeply into tissue, especially when diseased tissue consists of, or is located within, bone or other dense or opaque structures. Unfortunately, using rapid growth as the sole targeting criterion does not limit the effects of such treatment to diseased tissue, and as a result, heathy tissue is often destroyed or damaged.<br>
As a result, some improvements have been made in the methods for delivery of the radiation to the disease site so as to limit the effects of such radiation to the general area of the diseased tissue. However, since healthy tissue and diseased tissue typically have a similar biological response to ionizing radiation, a need exists to improve the potency of (or biological response to) the delivered radiation within the vicinity of the diseased tissue to the diseased tissue, so as to not affect the surrounding healthy tissue.<br>
Accordingly, some investigators have focused their efforts on developing agents that become activated by, or increase the therapeutic potential of, such ionizing radiation. Such agents are known as radiosensitizers, and when used in combination with ionizing radiation constitute a therapeutic modality known as high energy phototherapy. Since radiosensitizers function by absorbing or otherwise interacting with penetrating, ionizing radiation and locally transforming this radiation into a more biologically active form, it is desirable that such radiosensitizer agents exhibit high intrinsic radiodensity and a capacity for preferential concentration in diseased tissue (thus allowing maximal, selective delivery of the therapeutic effects of such radiation to such diseased tissue containing such agent).<br>
Due to the focal nature of many diseases, it is desirable to achieve this preferential concentration of the radiosensitizer through natural processes or via localized application of agent. The desired result is then for radiation to become more efficacious when the radiosensitizer is present in tissue, so that less radiation is needed to treat the lesion, tumor or other diseased tissue, and accordingly, potential damage to surrounding healthy tissue.<br><br>
resulting from collateral exposure :o the radiation, is reduced. Herxe. safety and efficacy can be improved by having agents capable of preferential concentration in diseased tissue.<br>
The ultimate success or failure of high energy phototherapy thus depends on: (1) therapeutic performance of radiosensitizer agents, and (2) disease specificitv' in deliver/ of agents to the site of disease or diseased tissue. Currently used agents and targeting approaches, however, have had unacceptable results in each of these categories.<br>
The therapeutic performance of a radiosensitizer is a function of enhanced absorption of the applied radiation dose in sensitized tissues relative to that in non-sensitized tissues. This differential absorption is commonly effected by use of radiodense agents having a high absorption cross-section for a paricular type of radiation (such as x-rays). For example, metal or halogen atoms are often used, either in atomic form or incorporated into a molecular carrier, due to their high x-ray cross-section. Absorption of x-rays by such radiodense materials appears to lead to secondary radiative emissions, ionization, and other chemical or physical processes that increase the localized cytotoxicity of the applied energy (i.e., radiation-induced cell death, or "light . cytotoxicity").<br>
However, a high light cytotoxicity is not enough to make an agent an acceptable agent. The agent must also have a negligible effect when energy is not applied (i.e., have a low toxicity in the absence of radiation, or "dark cytotoxicity"). Unfortunately, many agents presently under investigation as radiosensitizers are disadvantageous as they either have (a) a relatively high dark cytotoxicity or (b) a low light (c\totoxicity)-to-dark cytotoxicity ratio which limits their effectiveness and acceptability. In contrast, agents having a high light-to-dark cytotoxicity ratio are desirable because they (1) can be safely used over a range of dosages, (2) will exhibit improved efficacy at the treatment site (due to the compatibility with use at higher dosages as a consequence of their relative safety), and (3) will be better tolerated throughout the patient's body.<br>
An additional problem with many current radiosensitizers is that the agent does not achieve significant preferential concentration in diseased tissue. Specifically, most radiosensitizer targeting has been based on physical targeting, such as diffusion into tumors through leaky neovasculature, which ultimately succeeds or fails based on permeability of the tumor to agents that are aqueously soluble or are in a suspension formulation. As a result, large doses of the agent typically need to be administered, either<br><br>
locally or systemically. so as to saturate all tissues, hopefully reaching a therapeutic level in the desired treatment region or target. After such agent administration, a patient has to wait a clearance time of from hours to days to allow excess agent to hopefully clear from the healthy tissues surrounding the desired treatment site. Thereafter, irradiation of residual agent at the treatment site hopefully produces the desired therapeutic effect in the diseased tissue. Tnis approach unfortunately can also damage healthy surrounding tissue by undesired activation of residual agent still present in the healthy surrounding tissue. One approach to solving this problem is to couple the radiosensitizer with a moiety-capable of providing improved biotargetting of the diseased tissue. This, however, has proven to be very difficult to achieve.<br>
It would also be highly desirable if the radiosensitizer could be used to improve identification of target size, location and depth so that the therapeutic radiation could be more precisely delivered to the target, such as to a cancerous tumor. Further, combined diagnostic use (as a contrast agent) and therapeutic use (as a radiosensitizer) of the agent would reduce risk to the patient by (1) reducing the number of required procedures necessary for diagnosis and treatment, (2) reducing the overall diagnosis and treatment time, and (3) reducing cost.<br>
Thus, the inherent disadvantages of various current radiosensitizer agents and medicaments containing such agents have made acceptable radiation therapy for various human and animal conditions difficult or impossible.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide new intracorporeal radiodense medicaments, medical uses for such medicaments based on improved specificity of such medicaments for the desired tissue to be treated, and methods for treatment using such medicaments, thereby resulting in increased efficacy and safety and reduced cost of treatment.<br>

Such medicaments will thus be referred to as   intracoporeal   medicaments   (i.e.,   medicaments   suitable   for   intracorporeal administration).<br>
1.	Properties of the preferred radiodense components and medicament formulations.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have discovered a class of radiodense agents that are broadly applicable for producing intracoporeal medicaments for high energy phototherapeutic treatment of disease in certain human and animal tissues. These radiodense agents are referred to as haiogenated xanthenes and are illustrated in Figure la, where the symbols X, Y, and Z represent various elements present at the designated positions, and the symbols R' and R" represent various functionalities present at the designated positions. The halogen content of the haiogenated xanthenes makes this class of agent highly efficient absorbers of x-rays or other ionizing radiation of energy greater<br><br>
than approximately 1 keV and less than approximately 1000 MeV, and thus suitable as radiodense components in various radiosensitizer medicaments used in conjunction with such radiation in high energy phototherapy.<br>
Selected chemical and physical properties (such as chemical constituents at positions X. Y, and Z and functionalities R' and R", along with molecular weight) of representative halogenated xanthenes are summarized in attached Table 1 {infra). Certain general properties of this class of agents are discussed in further detail in USSN 09/130,041. filed on August 6,1998 (entitled "Improved Method for Targeted Treatment of Disease'); USSN 09/184,388, filed on November 2, 1998 (entitled "Method for Improving Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy"); USSN 09/216,787, filed on December 2K 1998; (entitled "High Energy Phototherapeutic Agents"); and USSN 60/149,015, filed on August 13, 1999 (entitled 'Improved Topical Medicaments and Methods for Photodynamic Treatment of Disease"), each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.   In general, the halogenated xanthenes are characterized by a large radiation absorbance cross-section, low dark cytotoxicity (toxicity to cells or tissues in the absence of radiation), high light cytotoxicity (toxicity to cells or tissues upon irradiation). relatively low cost, an ability to clear rapidly from the body, and chemical and radiosensitizer properties that are substantially unaffected by the local chemical environment or the attachment of functional derivatives at positions R' and R".  The halogenated xanthenes also exhibit a preference for concentration in diseased tissue, and thus are capable of exhibiting enhanced radiation dose enhancement over that possible with previously known agents. These special properties of the halogenated xanthenes, and in particular intracorporeal medicaments formulated from such agents, make such agents and medicaments excellent for high energy phototherapeutic treatment of disease in human and animal tissues.<br>
One preferred embodiment of an intracorporeal medicament according to the present invention contains a radiodense ingredient, afa concentration of from greater than approximately 0.001% to less than approximately 20%, comprised of at least one halogenated xanthene, including for example one or more of: 4',5'-Dichloronuorescein: 2',7'-Dichlorofluorescein;4,5,6,7-Tetrachlorofluorescein;2',4',5',7'-Tetrachlorofluorescein: Dibromofluorescein; Solvent Red 72; Diiodofluorescein; Eosin B; Eosin Y; Ethyl Eosin: Erythrosin    B;    Phloxine    B;    Rose    Bengal    (4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2\4\5\7'-<br><br>
tetraiodofluorescein: shown in Figure 1 b); 4.5.6,7-Tetrabromoerythrosin: Mono-. Di-. or Tribromoervihrosin; Mono-, Di-, or Trichloroerythrosin; Mono-, Di-. or Trifluoroerv'throsin; 2'.7'-Dichloro-4.5,6,7-Tetrafluorofluorescein; 2',4.5.6,7,7'-Hexafluorofluorescein; and 4,5.6,7-Tetrafluoronuorescein. Since the radiation cross-section of halogens increases substantially in the order F throsin and its derivatives, make these agents even more preferrable for use as a radiodense ingredient in such medicaments.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have found that intracorporeal medicaments that contain, as a radiodense ingredient, at least one halogenated xanthene, exhibit preferential accumulation of said radiodense ingredient in diseased tissue. Such accumulation of said radiodense ingredient within or in physical proximity to such tissue increases the efficiency of radiosensitization of such tissue (i.e., conversion of applied ionizing radiation into localized cytotoxic effects in or near such tissue). This yield enhancement is believed to result from the increased probability that proximally-released energy (i.e., scattered or otherwise re-emitted energy released upon interaction of applied ionizing radiation with said radiosensitizer) will interact favorably with the target tissue (before annihilating or otherwise dissipating in an inefficacious manner) whenever said radiodense ingredient responsible for such released energy is concentrated as close as possible to such target tissue. Stated in simple terms, the released energy, generally having a short mean free path, has a higher probability of interacting with target tissue if it is released from a radiodense ingredient that has been delivered to a location within or close to the target tissue.<br>
For example, it is possible to estimate an agent's potential for tissue accumulation based on the partition coefficient, Kp. This in vitro parameter is commonly purported to have predictive value relating to in vivo agent delivery at the cellular level. In particular, a value greater than unity is considered to indicate agents capable of localizing in tumor<br><br>
or other diseased tissue, and more specifically in plasma membranes of cells composing such tissue, and thereby being capable of exhibiting enhanced therapeutic efficacy in such tissue. Kp is determined by measuring the ratio of equilibrium concentrations of an agent in a lipophilic phase (n-octanol) contacted with an aqueous phase (saline). Comparative values of K9 are shown in Table 2 {infra). The large Kp values for the halogenated xanthenes indicate that the halogenated xanthenes will exhibit a tendency to accumulate in tumor or other diseased tissue, and should thereby be capable of exhibiting superior high energy phototherapeutic efficacy in such tissue.<br>
A specific example of such preferential accumulation and therapeutic response of the halogenated xanthenes in diseased tissue is exhibited by Rose Bengal. In particular, the inventors of the present invention have found that Rose Bengal will accumulate preferentially in (i.e.. target) some tumors and other diseased tissues. This preference for accumulation in diseased tissue is illustrated by the following examples which we meant to illustrate and not limit the present invention:<br>
Initially, tumor cell suspensions (for example, melanoma, breast tumor, liver tumor, renal carcinoma, gall bladder tumor or prostate tumor) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice resulting in formation of primary tumors, within a few weeks, at the injection site having a tumor volume of approximately 0.5-1<br>
cm2<br>
Thereafter, a solution of Rose Bengal (for example, 
In addition, the inventors of the present invention discovered that intratumoral injection (/. /.) of various Rose Bengal formulations in the other model tumors (i.e.. breast tumor, liver tumor, renal carcinoma, gall bladder tumor or prostate tumor) resulted in similar persistent accumulation of Rose Bengal throughout the tumor volume, with more than 75% of the injected Rose Bengal dose remaining in the tumor after several weeks. Peritumoral injection (i.e., injection into normal tissue around the outside margins of the tumor) exhibited no such persistence in normal tissue, with less than 1% of Rose Bengal remaining in the vicinity of the tumor after 24 hours.<br><br>
Thus, the inventors of the present invention have shown that medicaments containing at least one halogenated xanthene, and in particular Rose Bengal, exhibit a marked preference for accumulation in tumor and other diseased tissue upon intracorporeal administration, and that once present in such tissue, said medicaments can be utilized as potent, highly tissue specific radiosensitizers.<br>
In addition to superior suitability for direct administration into desired tissue to be treated, such as a focal tumor, the preference of'the halogenated xanthenes for accumulation in certain tissues provides a basis for highly-selective, systemic delivery of the halogenated xanthenes to such tissues. For example, Rose Bengal's relatively large panition coefficient is indicative of a preference for accumulation in lipophilic tissue, such as cutaneous lipocytes. The inventors of the present invention have found that systemic administration of Rose Bengal, for example as an aqueous solution administered via intraperitoneal injection {i,p.) or per oesophagus (p.o.), resulted in highly selective accumulation of said agent in certain tissues, such as in the cutaneous fat deposits of obese laboratory mice. Histologic examination of skin samples from such animals shows that the accumulated agent is substantively limited to cutaneous lipocytes. Furthermore, activation of this accumulated agent precipitates selective destruction of such lipocytes with no effect in overlying skin or underlying muscle tissue.<br>
Moreover, the inventors of the present invention have discovered that the facility with which the halogenated xanthenes target specific tissues or other sites can be further optimized by attachment of specific functional derivatives at positions R' and R-, so as to change the chemical partitioning or biological activity of the agent. For example, attachment of one targeting moiety or more at positions R' or R" can be used to improve targeting to specific tissues, such as cancerous tumor tissues or sites of localized infection. An example of this is esterification at position R' with a short aliphatic alcohol, such as ethanol or n-hexanol, to produce a derivatized agent exhibiting enhanced partitioning into lipid-rich tumor tissues.<br>
It is thus a further embodiment of the present invention to include a targeting moiety in at least one of the at least one halogenated xanthene active ingredients, such targeting moiety being selected from a group that includes deoxyribonuceic acid (DNA). ribonuclerc acid (RNA), amino acids, proteins, antibodies, ligands, haptens, carbohydrate receptors, carbohydrate complexing agents, lipid receptors, lipid complexing agents.<br><br>
protein receptors, protein complexing agents, chelators, encapsulating vehicles, short-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, esters, amides, amines, nitriles, azides, hydrophilic moieties, and hydrophobic moieties. A further example of this embodiment is derivatization of Rose Bengal with a lipid (at position R', via esterification), so as to increase the lipophilicity of Rose Bengal, and thereby modify its targeting properties in a patient. An additional further example of this embodiment is derivatization of Rose Bengal with folate (at position R', via esterification or other modes of attachment), so as to increase selective targeting of cancer and other cells exhibiting enhanced folate receptor activity or folate metabolism.<br>
As a further e.xample of the desirable chemical, biochemical, and physical properties of the halogenated xanthenes and halogenated xanthene derivatives, the inventors of the present invention have shown that such agents exhibit a remarkable combination of low dark cytotoxicity and high light cytotoxicity. This is evidenced by the following results: intracorporeal administration ofa medicament containing Rose Bengal into tumor-bearing laboratory animals at levels equivalent to or greater than 100 mg/kg resulted in negligible biological effects in the absence of irradiation; however, irradiation of tumor tissue in such animals subsequent to such administration resulted in marked destruction of such tumor tissue. Further, as previously described, the inventors of the present invention have shown that such agents are readily cleared from healthy tissues in a matter of several hours, and are known to be rapidly excreted in bile, urine and feces, without doing damage to those healthy tissues while it was there. This is in dramatic contrast to many conventional radiodense agents, some of which exhibit half-lives in healthy tissues on the order of many weeks.<br>
Further examples of the desirable properties of the halogenated xanthenes and halogenated xanthene derivatives are as follows: the halogenated xanthenes and halogenated xanthene derivatives are easily synthesized using simple low-cost synthetic methods, can be readily purified, and exhibit excellent stability (such as a long shelf life without need for refrigeration or an inert atmosphere).<br>
Because the halogenated xanthenes and their derivatives are, in general, fine solid powders in their pure form, it is preferred that, for proper delivery to desired tissues, such agents be formulated in appropriate delivery vehicles. Approaches to such formulation<br><br>
will be generally knovvn ro those of ordinariy skill in the art. Specifically, such formulations are preferred so as to facilitate agent delivery into the body and subsequent contact with, and delivery to. desired tissues to be treated.<br>
It is thus a further embodiment of the present invention that at least one halogenated xanthene or halogenated xanthene derivative be formulated as an intracorporeaJ medicament in a form suitable for intracorporeal administration via various conventional modes and routes.
