				<td>The present invention concerns an elongated spinning machine with a long ma¬chine frame  with a plurality of spindle motors, equipped with a spindle drive shaft each provided for driving a large number of spinning positions, with a large number of drafting systems co-ordinated to a spinning position each, and with a suction duct extending in longitudinal direction along the machine frame and connected to an air suction fan arrangement.<br>
Modern spinning machines require considerable power for their operation. To a large extent the power supplied is transformed into heat, in particular into friction-al heat. This is undesirable not only in view of the thermally induced expansion of various machine parts which in combination with the thermally induced drift in the electronic systems associated with the spinning machine can impair the qual¬ity of the yarns protruded, but also shortens the life span&gt;of individual machine elements, especially of motors.<br>
From EP O 478 993 a method of cooling drive arrangements, with a power elec¬tronics system in particular, of a ring spinning machine or of a twisting machine in which at least a part air stream of the exhaust air of the machine is conveyed to¬wards a heat exchanger of the power electronics system, is accelerated before reaching the later, is warmed up while passing, and after passing is exhausted from the machine via an air outlet opening. In this manner a portion of the ma¬chine is cooled, namely the power electronics system, which during operation heats up most intensely, in such a manner that the heat generated can be elimi¬nated with particular ease.<br>
Furthermore from EP O 326 688 a method is known of eliminating heat from a room containing ring spinning machines in which the heat emitting machine parts are cooled using a cooling fluid circulating in at least one closed circuit the heated cooling fluid being cooled by an air stream conveyed away from the room. This method, however, due to the necessity of providing a cooling fluid circuit, is very demanding concerning the construction. The cooling system trans¬fers the heat to be eliminated from dll machine elements to a heat exchanger and<br><br>
therefrom is carried off by the air stream. The heat transfer thus is effected, as in EP O 478 993, at a point of high heat density.<br>
For the design of modern spinning machine there is a tendency to apply section¬al construction, owing to which instead of a small number of particularly powerful motors a large number of preferentially identical motors is provided. Thus e.g. a large number of drive motors is associated with the spindles, in which arrange¬ment even a separate low-powered motor may be provided for each spindle. Thus heat generation is spread over a larger volume which impedes heat elimi¬nation generally.<br>
It thus is a goal of the present invention to provide, on a spinning machine of the type mentioned initially, a heat elimination system of simple construction which is efficient and still can be manufactured economically.<br>
This goal is achieved owing to the characteristics according to the characterizing part of the claim 1.<br>
The present invention thus makes use of the air suction fan system which is pro¬vided on the elongated spinning machine anyhow for effecting the suction action along the machine, for creating a cooling arrangement for the spindle motors dis¬tributed along the length of the machine. Arrangement of the spindle motors in¬side the air duct, through the wall of which the spindle drive shafts extend, not only permits an advantageous lay-out of the air stream in the air duct but also prevents undesirable warming up of the other elements of the spinning machine by the heat given off by the spindle motors as the wall screens off the heat.<br>
Arrangement of a dust filter upstream of the cooling duct according to the claim 2 prevents the eventual impairment of the function of the motors over time due to dust settling thereon.<br>
Owing to the enlargement of the suction duct upstream of the dust filter the speed is reduced at which the air flows through the filter and thus a more efficient dust<br><br>
collecting action is effected. Owing to the correspondingly enlarged filtering cross section area the filter needs to be exchanged less frequently.<br>
The arrangement of the air suction fan system downstream from the filter also helps protect the air suction fan system from gradually becoming soiled.<br>
In an advantageous arrangement the air suction fan system is located upstream from the cooling duct, the air thus being pushed through the duct. Owing to this arrangement an efficient suction action can be effected, adequate vacuum being applied, in the suction duct even if the cooling duct is not sealed and built to with¬stand pressure. Thus it is possible, without impairing the function, to dispense with, or at least to simplify considerably, a seal for the spindle drive shaft opening in the wall of the cooling duct. Even if a small portion of warmed air should es¬cape along the spindle drive shaft no excessive warming up of the spinning ma¬chine occurs.<br>
The air suction fan system can be arranged in the machine frame head end or in the machine foot end in the connection duct between the air suction duct and the cooling duct. If desired, machine elements located in the machine head or foot ends also can be cooled.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the air suction duct arranged along the machine frame is separated in a head portion and a foot portion re¬spectively, in such a manner that air from the first duct portion extending towards the foot end is drawn into the machine frame foot end only, and that air from the other duct portion extending towards the head end is drawn into the machine frame head end portion by a second air suction fan system. This lay-out permits arrangement of two air suction fan systems which practically can be operated independently from each other.<br>
In a further improvement of the preferred embodiment of the invention air from only one of the two part air stream from the divided air suction duct passes through the cooling duct. By suitably choosing the separation point of the two<br><br>
duct portions the volume of the air stream used for cooling can be determined in such a maimer that e.g. the load on each of the two fan motors will be equal. A common exhaust outlet for both air streams also can be provided at one end of the machine frame.<br>
Preferentially radial fans are applied in air suction fan systems.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an elongated spiiming machine with a long machine frame, with a plurality of spindle motors, equipped with a spindle drive shaft each, provided for driving a large nimiber of spiiming positions, with a large number of drafting system co-ordinated to a spiiming position each, and with a suction duct extending in longitudinal direction along the machine frame and connected to an air suction fan arrangement, characterized in that a cooling duct is provided extending along the machine frame at least over the length of the arrangement of all spindle drive motors, inside which duct the spindle drive motors are located, and through the wall of which the spindle drive shafts extend, and which is connected in such a maimer that at least part of the air volume sucked in by the air suction fan system through the air suction duct also flows through the cooling duct.<br>
The invention is described in more detail in the following with reference to illus¬trated design examples. It is shown in:<br>
Fig. 1 a side view of a spiiming machine shown schematically according to a first design example of the present invention, and in<br>
Fig. 2 a side view shown schematically of a second design example according to the<br>
invention.<br>
According to the Fig. 1 an elongated spiiming machine 10 comprises a machine frame<br>
35 which takes up a series of spinning positions, or spindles 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d,<br>
respectively, to which a yam 32 is supplied from a drafting system 16 each. The<br>
spindles can be driven individually or as shown in a plurality of groups by spindle<br>
motors 14a, 14b, 14c via a spindle drive shaft 14' each.<br><br>
To all spindles jointly an upper air suction duct 18 is co-ordinated through which a suction fan system 20 arranged laterally in the head end 26, preferentially con- taining a radial fan, sucks in air preferentially in particular through a dust filter 24 arranged in a ftinnel-shaped enlargement 18' of the air suction duct 18 in the head end 26 of the machine frame 35. Air suction at the spinning positions otherwise is conventional and thus is not described in more detail here.<br>
The air suction fan system 20 presses the air sucked in and freed of dust through an air<br>
deflecting tube 34 also arranged in the head end 26 of the machine frame 35 to the<br>
intake opening 22" of a cooling duct 22 arranged along the machine frame 35. The<br>
cooling duct 22 is laid out to take up the spindle motors 14 in such	<br><br>
a manner that the spindle drive shafts 14" extend through the wall 22' of the cool¬ing duct 22. Any devices transmitting and/or distributing torque from the spindle drive shafts to the spindles, if such devices should be provided, preferentially are arranged outside the cooling duct.<br>
If desired air tight sealing of the spinning positions can be provided. In the cool¬ing duct 22 furthermore electrical circuitry for powering and controlling the spind¬le motors 14 is housed.<br>
The cooling duct 22 extends to the foot end 26' of the spinning machine 10 and from there the air stream is conveyed through the cooling duct 22 and exhausted via an outlet duct to e.g. to the outside.<br>
During operation the air suction fan system 20 via the openings provided in the duct 18 first sucks in air from the spinning positions into the head end 26 of the spinning machine 10 where the air stream is enlarged In the funnel-shaped en¬largement 18' and passes at reduced speed through the dust protection filter 24 arranged upstream from the air suction fan system 20. The stream of cleaned air thereupon is pressed via the connecting duct 34 into the duct 22. In the duct 22 the air is warmed up as it cools the spindle motors 14 which generate heat dur¬ing operation as they drive the spindles 12 via the spindle drive shafts 14', and the warmed air then enters the foot end 26' and from there is exhausted via the outlet 28 away from the machine frame 35.<br>
For cooling the spinning machine thus one air duct merely is to be provided that can be produced cost-efficiently, in the wall of which simple holes are arranged without any particularly costly seals for the spindle drive shafts whereas provi¬sion of a separate fan arrangement for cooling is not required. Furthermore, if the cooling duct is dimensioned properly, the air flow resistance therein remains so small that the air suction fan system 20 required as such is powerful enough or requires just a minor increase in its power rating.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in the Fig. 2, in<br><br>
which elements identical or similar to the ones shown in the Fig. 1 are designat¬ed by the same reference numbers.<br>
According to the Fig. 2 the elongated spinning machine 10 again comprises a machine frame 35 supporting an air suction duct 18 through which air is sucked in from the spinning positions 12 via a filter arrangement 24 by ^n air suction fan system 20 into the head end 26 of the machine frame 35 and is pressed via a connecting duct 34 into a cooling duct 22 through the wall 22' of which spindle drive shafts 14' of spindle motors 14 extend.<br>
Other than shown in the Fig. 1, however, in the air suction duct 18 a dividing wall is arranged which separates the air duct 18 into a head end side duct portion 18a and a foot end side duct portion 18b. The air sucked in via the air suction openings arranged along the duct 18 through the head end side duct portion 18a is pressed, as described before, by the air suction fan system through the cooling duct 22. For providing the suction action in the foot end side duct portion 18' a second air suction fan system 20 with a separate motor 30 is provided in the foot<br>
a dust filter 24 arranged in a funnel-shaped enlargement 18' of the air duct. From the air suction fan system arranged in the foot end 26' of the machine frame 35 air flows towards an outlet 28 where it merges with the air leaving the cooling duct 22, the combined air stream being exhausted.<br>
In the design example shown in the Fig. 2 only the air sucked into the duct por¬tion 18a of the air suction duct 18, extending from the separation wall 36 towards the head end 26 is used for cooling the spindle motors in the cooling duct 22, whereas the air sucked into the duct portion 18b extending towards the foot end 26' is pressed from the foot end 26' into the outlet 28. Suitable choice of the posi¬tion of the separation wall 36 in this arrangement permits setting of the air vol¬ume required for cooling the spindle drive motors 14 independently, to a large extent, of the total air volume sucked through the air suction duct 18 in such a manner that the extent of cooling action can be varied over a wide range. As an alternative the separation wall 36 also can be installed In the air suction duct 18<br>
^<br><br>
in such a manner that the air suction fan systems require substantially the same power rating each. A further advantage results if additionally a power electronics system known as such in modern spinning machines is to be cooled. In this case the power electronics system can be placed in the foot end 26' of the machine frame 35 in such a manner that it is being cooled by the air stream leaving the duct portion 18b without impairing the cooling action on the spindle-drive motors.<br>
Notwithstanding the fact that in the Figures a plurality of spindles is shown co-or¬dinated with a spindle motor each, an individual motor can be associated with each spindle. Furthermore the connecting duct 34 not necessarily must be plac¬ed inside, but also may be arranged outside, the head end 26 of the machine frame 35.<br><br>
