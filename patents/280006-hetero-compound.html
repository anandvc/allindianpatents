				<td>DESCRIPTION HETERO COMPOUND<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel hetero compound and a medicine containing the same as an active ingredient, particularly an agent for treating immunological diseases.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Sphingosine-1 -phosphate is a metabolite of sphingolipid which is a physiologically active substance secreted from an activated platelet (Non-Patent Document 1).    The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor is a G protein-binding type, and belongs to an Edg-family which is the endothelial differentiation gene.    Up to now, five receptors of SlPi(Edgl), SlP2(Edg5), SlP3(Edg3), SlP4(Edg6) and SlP5(Edg8) have been found.   All of these receptors are broadly distributed in cells and tissues throughout the body, but SI Pi, SI P3 and S1P4 are predominantly expressed in lymphocyte and endothelial cell, SIP2 is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cell, and SIP5 is predominantly expressed in brain and spleen, and amino acid sequences thereof are well-conserved in human and rodent (Non-Patent Document 1). Many receptors bind to G proteins by stimulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate.    SIPi bind to Gj/o, S1P2 and S1P3 bind to Gj/o, Gq, G12/13 and Gs, S1P4 binds to Gy0, G12/13 and Gs, SIP5 is coupled to G1/o and G12/13, and cell growth caused by activation of MAPK, change of cytoskeletal system and cell infiltration caused by activation of Rac (and/or Rho), and generation of cytokine and mediator caused by activation of PLC and calcium influx into cell, and the like (Non-Patent Document 1) are induced.    It has been known that by the stimulating action of S1P1 of sphingosine-1 -phosphate, migration of lymphocyte, inhibition of apoptosis, generation of cytokine, sequestering lymphocyte in thymus and other secondary lymphoid tissues are induced, and angioplasty in vascular<br>
 <br>
endothelial cell is promoted (Non-Patent Document 2).    On the other hand, expression<br>
of S1P3 is also found on cardiomyocyte, and transiently-decrease in heart rate<br>
(infrequent pulse) or in blood pressure by stimulation of sphingosine-1 -phosphate is<br>
observed (Non-Patent Document 3) while infrequent pulse is not observed by<br>
stimulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate in a knockout mouse wherein SIP3 is<br>
genetically deleted (Non-Patent Document 4).    It has been reported that FTY720<br>
phosphate ester which is an active body of FTY720 currently in a clinical trial has non¬<br>
selective agonist activity for SIPi, S1P3, S1P4 and S1P5 (Non-Patent Document 5), and<br>
especially infrequent pulse induced by the stimulation effect through SIP3 is frequently<br>
expressed as an undesirable side effect in clinical trial (Non-Patent Document 6).<br>
Accordingly, it is considered that for sequestering lymphocyte through a sphingosine-1 -<br>
phosphate receptor, the stimulation from SI Pi is essential (Non-Patent Document 7),<br>
while the stimulation from SIP3 is not essential which is rather considered to be related<br>
to the induction of undesirable side effect.   Thus, for the development of	..   .   ,..-.„..,. :<br>
immunosuppressive agent with few side effects, development of agonist having weak effect on SIP3 and selectively effecting on SIPi is desired.<br>
[0003]<br>
For example, as a compound having SIPi agonist activity, a carboxylic acid derivative represented by the following formula has been known (Patent Document 1).<br>

(Preparation Method)<br>
The compound (I) of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be prepared by applying various known synthetic methods, taking advantages of the characteristics based on their basic backbones or the kind of the substituents.   Here, depending on the kind of the functional groups, it is in some cases effective from the viewpoint of the preparation techniques to protect the functional group with an appropriate protecting group, or to replace it by a group which may be easily converted into the functional group, during the steps of from starting materials to intermediates.   Examples of such a functional group include an amino group, a hydroxyl group, and a carboxyl group, and examples of a protecting group thereof include the protecting groups as described in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", edited by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, (USA) (3rd edition, 1999), which may be optionally selected and used in response to the reaction conditions.     By such a method, the desired compound can be obtained bv introducing a protecting group to<br>
 <br>
carry out the reaction, and then, if desired, removing the protecting group or converting it into a desired group.<br>
In addition, a prodrug of the compound (I) of the present invention can be prepared by introducing a specific group during the steps of from starting materials to intermediates, similar to the aforementioned protecting groups, or by carrying out the reaction using the obtained compound (I) of the present invention.     The reaction may be carried out by employing common esterification, amidation, dehydration, or a method conventionally known to a person skilled in the art.<br>

The in vitro SI Pi agonist activity of the compound of the present invention was evaluated by the increase in the functional bonding activity into the G-Protein of a GTP[y-35S] using the membrane of a human SIPi expressing cell.    A cDNA encoding a human SIPi was cloned from a human colorectal cDNA library, and introduced to an expression vector pcDNA3.1 to construct a SlPi-pcDNA3.1.   Then, by Lipofectamine 2000 (GIBCO), the SIPrpcDNA3.1 was transfected into a CHO cell, and cultured in a Ham's F-12 culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL Penicillin, 100 ug/mL Streptomycin, and 1 mg/mL G418 disulfate, to obtain a stable, G418-resistant strain.    The cultured human SI Pi expressing cells were isolated in a 1 mM EDTA/2Na-containing PBS, and disrupted under ice-cooling by a homogenizer made of glass in a 1 mM Tris HC1 (pH 7.4) buffer solution containing 0.1 mM EDTA and a protein inhibitor.    It was centrifuged at 1,400x 10 min, and a supernatant was further centrifuged at 4°C for 60 min at 100,000xg, and suspended in a 10 mM Tris HC1 (pH 7.4) buffer solution containing 1 mM EDTA.    The obtained membrane (0.13 mg/mL) and 50 pM GTP[y-35S] (NEN; inactive 1250 Ci/mmol) were reacted in a 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) buffer solution (total amount: 150 uL) containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA, and 5 uM GDP for 1 hour together with the compound of the present invention (10'12 to 10"5 M), and then a membrane was recovered on a GF-C plate with a Cell Harvester (Packard, FilterMate).   The FilterMate was dried at 50°C for 60 min, and Microscinti-o (Packard) was added thereto for measurement by a liquids scintillation counter for a microplate (Packard, TOP count).   For evaluation of the human S1P i agonist activity of the compound of the present invention and the comparative compound, the percentages with the rate of a<br>
 <br>
maximum reaction to make the GTP[y-35S] bonds saturated in the presence of the compound being set at 100%, and the rate of the reaction of the GTP[y-35S] bonds in the absence of the compound being set at 0% was used, a non-linear regression curve was plotted, and a concentration to cause an agonist activity operating 50% of the maximum reaction was defined as an EC50 value (nM).<br>

o  A<br>
 <br>
blood sample were immediately added EDTA/4K and heparin to prevent clotting, and the number of the lymphocytes in blood was measured with an automatic haematology analyzer (Sysmex Corp.; XT-2000i).   For the reduction of the number of the lymphocytes in peripheral blood by the compound of the present invention, the percentage with the number of the lymphocytes in groups administered with 0.5% methyl cellulose-containing distilled water being set at 100%, as performed at the same time was used, and the dose to cause 50% reduction of the number of the lymphocytes in peripheral blood by administration of the compound of the present invention was defined an ED50 value (mg/kg).<br>
[0040]<br>
