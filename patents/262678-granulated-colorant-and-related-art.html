				<td>Granulated colorant and related art<br>
The present invention relates to a nigrosine granulated colorant that is used to impart a color to thermoplastic resin and for other purposes and has good handlability and good dispersibility in resin, a method of producing the same, a high-concentration master batch using the granulated colorant, a method of producing the same, and a colored composition using the granulated colorant or high-concentration master batch.<br>
Because thermoplastic resins have excellent mechanical and chemical properties, they are widely used in plastic molding products in the field of components for automobiles, electric/electronic products and the like, and the demands are increasing in the field of engineering plastics. Additionally, thermoplastic resins are fitted to a broad range of industrial applications by formulating fibrous reinforcing material in thermoplastic resins to improve the heat resistance and chemical resistance, and to confer mechanical properties matching with various applications. In particular, in the field of automobiles, bicycles and the like, there has been a remarkable trend toward replacement of conventional metal parts with fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin parts, for the purpose of weight reduction, manufacturing process rationalization and corrosion prevention.<br>
Thermoplastic resins are colored for decoration, color identification, improvement of light fastness of molded products, content protection and shading and for other purposes, with black coloring being the most important  in the  industry.      Traditionally,  various  inorganic  pigments  and<br><br>
2<br><br>
organic dyes/pigments, such as carbon black, black metal complex dyes, nigrosine dyes and perinone black, have been used to impart a black color to thermoplastic resins. Of these, nigrosine dyes enable imparting vividly black colors with excellent appearance and surface gloss, and hence have been widely used to impart a color to thermoplastic resins with various attempts.<br>
Specifically, such attempts include a molded blend wherein a polyamide resin is colored with carbon black and nigrosine (Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. SHO-60-43379), a glass fiber-reinforced black polyamide resin composition comprising a polyamide resin, a surface-treated glass fiber and an azine dye (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. HEI-6-128479), a black polyamide resin composition wherein a polyamide resin is colored with a nigrosine dye, aniline black and carbon black (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. HEI-9-255869), a polyester resin composition wherein a polyester resin is colored with a dye having a phenazine ring (nigrosine dye) (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. HEI-10-292098), a colored thermoplastic resin composition wherein a crystalline resin (e.g., polyamide resin, polybutylene terephthalate resin, etc.) is colored with a modified nigrosine dye and related art (Domestic Re-publication of PCT International Publication No. WO00/26302).<br>
Generally, in coloring a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin, a problem arises that the colorant (particularly black pigment) is difficult to sufficiently uniformly disperse in the resin even with a long time of kneading, because a fibrous reinforcing material is present in the resin. In   particular,   the   spoilage  of the   gloss,   appearance   and   the   like   of the<br><br>
3<br>
colored molded product by the fibrous reinforcing material floating on the surface of the molded product during molding has been problematic. In this regard, there is room for improving colored resin compositions comprising a nigrosine dye.<br>
Additionally, because nigrosine dyes are powders having small values of bulk density and average particle diameter, nigrosine dye dusting can occur during dye charge, blending with the resin, and the like, posing the problem with work environment deterioration, so that special measures have been required to prevent the dusting.<br>
Furthermore, a master batch of nigrosine dye is produced by, for example, blending a resin and a dye in a mechanical mixer such as a Henschel mixer or blender, and extrusion-molding the blend using a single-screw extruder or twin-screw extruder into a resin pellet. In this manufacturing process, however, drawbacks, including phenomena such as bridging in the hopper and unsmooth feed of raw materials (resin, nigrosine dye, etc.) into the screw during extrusion kneading due to fluidity differences between nigrosine dye and resin, and a lack of fluidity due to dye wetting and adhesion as a result of dye exposure to the gas from the resin, additives and the like in the extrusion process, have been likely. As such, nigrosine dyes are extremely poorly handlable; it has been difficult to fill a nigrosine dye in a master batch at high concentrations.<br>
The present invention has been developed in view of the aforementioned problems in the prior art, and is intended to provide a colorant    that    modifies    the    dusting    of    nigrosine    dye,    ensures    good<br><br>
4<br>
handlability in transportation, packaging, charge and the like, is unlikely to lose shape during the handling, and enables good and uniform dispersion of a nigrosine dye in a resin by blending or kneading with the resin in various forms of color imparting, including coloring a resin containing a fibrous reinforcing material and high-concentration resin coloring, a method of producing the same, a master batch that does not exhibit bridging or separation of a colorant from resin during blending or kneading said colorant with the resin during production and uniformly contains a high concentration of nigrosine dye, a method of producing the same, and a colored composition that uniformly contains a nigrosine dye, has a well controlled crystallization temperature with nigrosine dye, enables easier commercialization of products that must meet the rigorous demands for precision molding and dimensional accuracy, confers good appearance and surface gloss to molded products, has excellent light fastness, undergoes little color changes over time, and has good mechanical properties.<br>

6<br>
hardness of 1 to 20 N.      The aforementioned hardness is preferably 2 to 1 5 N, more preferably 3 to 12 N.<br>
The blending step in the above-described method of producing a granulated colorant is preferably a step for blending 100 parts by weight of a nigrosine dye and 20 to 55 parts by weight of water using a rotary mechanical mixer.

7<br>
granulated colorant per 100 parts by weight of said thermoplastic resin using an extruding machine, wherein the granulation product after drying by said drying step has a bulk density of 0.4 to 0.7 g/ml and a hardness of 1 to 20 N.

The present inventors found that it is possible to prevent nigrosine dye dusting, to ensure shape stability for the granulation product during handling in transportation, packaging, charge and the like, and to prevent drawbacks, including phenomena such as bridging in the hopper and unsmooth feed of raw materials (resin, nigrosine dye, etc.) into the screw, due to fluidity differences of a colorant from the resin, and a lack of fluidity due to dye wetting by the gas from the extruding machine, during blending or kneading with the resin during production of a master batch or colored composition, by granulating a powdery nigrosine dye into a granulation product (preferably into a cylindrical form) while adjusting the hardness and bulk density, and developed the present invention.<br>
The  granulated  colorant  of the  present  invention  modifies  nigrosine<br><br>
8<br>

9<br>
better handlability compared with powdery nigrosine. The granulated colorant of the present invention also exhibits good fluidity and stable dispersibility in resin, and is suitably used to produce a high-concentration master batch and an ordinary-concentration resin composition.<br>
Also, because the nigrosine dye in the granulated colorant of the present invention functions as a positively charged charge control agent, it enables suitable use of the granulated colorant of the present invention in manufacturing a toner for developing electrostatic images utilizing the good dispersibility thereof in resin.<br>
Furthermore, because the granulated colorant of the present invention functions as a black oil-soluble nigrosine dye, it can be suitably used in solution in a solvent and the like in recording liquids, writing instrument ink and the like, and can also be used as a colorant for leather and the like.<br>

Nigrosine dyes used in the present invention<br>
As the nigrosine dye which is a raw material for the granulated colorant (granulation product of powdery nigrosine dye) of the present invention, the black azine-series condensed mixture described as C.I. SOLVENT BLACK 5, C.I.  SOLVENT BLACK 5:1, C.I.  SOLVENT BLACK<br><br>
11<br>
5:2 and C.I. SOLVENT BLACK 7 in the COLOR INDEX can be suitably used (in this specification, C.I. Generic Names are described according to the third edition of the COLOUR INDEX). Synthesis of the nigrosine dye can be achieved by, for example, oxidizing and dehydrate-condensing aniline, aniline hydrochloride and nitrobenzene in the presence of iron chloride at a reaction temperature of 160 to 180°C. Nigrosine is produced as a mixture of various different compounds depending on reaction conditions, raw materials charged, charge ratio and the like; for example, it is postulated that nigrosine may be a mixture of various triphenazineoxazines represented by the following Formula (I) or (II) and phenazineazine compounds represented by Formulas (III) to (VI).<br><br>
12<br><br>
[In Formulas (I) to (VI), X' represents an anion, for example, CT or OH'.]<br>
Examples   of  commercially   available   nigrosine   dyes   include   Spirit Black SB,  Spirit Black SSBB, Spirit Black AB  (all  are categorized  under<br><br>
13<br>
C.I. SOLVENT BLACK 5); Nigrosine Base SA, Nigrosine Base SAP, Nigrosine Base SAP-L, Nigrosine Base EE, Nigrosine Base EE-L, Nigrosine Base EX, Nigrosine Base EX-BP (all are categorized under C.I. SOLVENT BLACK 7) and the like [all are product names of nigrosines manufactured by Orient Chemical Industries, Ltd.]. From among these nigrosine dyes, desired one meeting the requirements can be selected.<br>
The aforementioned nigrosine dye can, for example, be one having an average particle diameter of 5 to 30 urn. Preferably, the average particle diameter is 5 to 20 urn, more preferably 5 to 15 urn. By using such a nigrosine dye, it is possible to obtain a granulation product having a hardness that meets the requirement of the present invention at high yield.<br>
As an example of the method of determining the average particle diameter in this case, a method can be mentioned that comprises adding water to the dye, previously mixed with an activator, and performing a determination under particular conditions. Examples of useful analyzers include a precision distribution analyzer [Multilyzer III (product name): manufactured by Beckman Coulter, K.K.], a laser diffraction/scattering particle size distribution tester [product number: LA-910, manufactured by Horiba Ltd.] and the like.<br>
To obtain a granulated colorant of good quality, it is preferable that the aforementioned nigrosine dye have a specific surface area of 1.5 to 5.5 rrr/g, as determined by the BET method. More preferably, the specific surface area is 2.5 to 4.0 m2/g. When a nigrosine dye is blended with a binder and granulated by compression extrusion and the like using a granulating machine, it is possible to obtain a granulation product at good<br><br>
14<br>
yield by appropriately blending a nigrosine dye having a specific surface area of 1.5 to 5.5 m2/g, as determined by the BET method, with a binder (e.g., water); the granulation product obtained is capable of well exhibiting the effect of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, it is important that the nigrosine dye in the granulated colorant of the present invention should be a nigrosine dye having an Fe content of not more than 1.0% by weight. More preferably, the Fe content is not more than 8000 ppm. The dispersibility and compatibility of the nigrosine dye for the resin are thereby improved, so that a particularly good high-concentration master batch is obtained. The Fe content in such a nigrosine can be determined by atomic absorptiometry.<br>
A treatment to reduce the Fe content of such a nigrosine can, for example, be performed as described below. Specifically, the Fe content in the nigrosine dye after drying can be reduced or adjusted by removing the iron hydroxide separating during the base treatment of nigrosine with the addition of sodium hydroxide to the nigrosine condensation product obtained by condensing aniline and aniline hydrochloride with nitrobenzene in the presence of ferric chloride, using a centrifuge such as a screw decanter or a Sharpless centrifuge.<br>
A particularly preferable nigrosine dye is a nigrosine dye having low contents of the reaction starting material aniline and the reaction solvent nitrobenzene. Specifically, a nigrosine dye having an aniline content of not more than 2000 ppm, preferably not more than 1000 ppm (more preferably not more than 700 ppm), and a nitrobenzene content of not more than 500 ppm (more preferably not more than 300 ppm) can be mentioned.<br><br>
15<br>
As examples of the method of purifying such a nigrosine dye, the following methods (1) to (6) can be mentioned.<br>
(1)	A method of adding a solvent having a boiling point of 100 to 230°C,<br>
and removing the aniline and/or nitrobenzene along with the solvent under<br>
heating and reduced pressure.      Examples of such solvents include xylene,<br>
toluene,   ethylbenzene,   mesitylene,   decahydronaphthalene,   dibutyl   ether,<br>
ethylene glycol and the like.<br>
(2)	A method of washing the nigrosine dye with a solution in which aniline<br>
and/or nitrobenzene is soluble, and removing the solvent.     As examples of<br>
such    a    solution,    organic    solvents    (e.g.,    alcohols,    glycols),    aqueous<br>
solutions,    mixed    solutions    of   organic    solvents    and    water,    or    acidic<br>
solutions of these solvents or solutions can be mentioned.<br>
(3)	A   method   of   removing   the   aniline   and/or   nitrobenzene   simply   by<br>
heating at reduced pressure.<br>
(4)	A method of thermal distillation.<br>
(5)	A method of distillation such as steam distillation.<br>
(6)	A   method   of  oxidation   using   oxygen,   ozone,   bleaching   powder   or<br>
another oxidant.<br>
Nigrosine dye granulation process for obtaining a granulated colorant The   granulated   colorant   of  the   present   invention   is   a   granulation<br>
product of a powdery nigrosine dye, which granulation product has a bulk<br>
density of 0.4 to 0.7 g/ml and a hardness of 1 to 20 N, preferably 2 to 15 N,<br>
and more preferably 3 to 12 N.<br>
When using the granulated colorant of the present invention, it can be<br>
effective   even   if  a   mixture   of  the   granulated   colorant   of  the   present<br><br>
16<br>
invention and an ungranulated nigrosine dye (e.g., powdery nigrosine dye) is used as the colorant. For example, when the granulated colorant of the present invention accounts for at least 70% by weight (preferably not less than 75% by weight, more preferably not less than 80% by weight) of the nigrosine dye used as the colorant, it can be fully effective.<br>
As a suitable shape of the granulation product, a cylindrical pellet having a diameter (0) of 2 to 4 mm can be mentioned. A preferable length thereof is 7 to 12 mm.<br>
In the present invention, a granulation product having a cross-section not completely circular but with an irregularity of not more than 20% of the diameter, a granulation product having a nearly circular cross-section, such as an ellipsoidal or deformed circle, and/or a granulation product having a cross-section the shape and dimensions of which are not constant in the axial direction, can also be deemed a cylindrical granulation product.<br>
Regarding the shape of the granulation product, a non-cylindrical column is acceptable. For example, the granulation product may be a non-cylindrical columnar pellet of 2 to 4 mm (more preferably 2.5 to 3.5 mm) in height and width and 3 to 10 mm (more preferably 8 to 10 mm) in length.<br>
Although the method of granulation to obtain the granulated colorant of the present invention is not subject to limitation, extrusion granulation can be mentioned as a suitably used method. As the extrusion granulating machine for performing extrusion granulation, the forward pressing screw type, lateral pressing screw type, forward pressing ram type, lateral pressing   roll   type,   downward   pressing   roll   type,   lateral   pressing   basket<br><br>
17<br>
type, and downward pressing screen type and the like can be mentioned, with preference given to, for example, a downward pressing roll type extrusion granulating machine.<br>
The method of producing the granulated colorant of the present invention comprises a blending step for blending a powdery nigrosine dye and water, a granulation step for obtaining a cylindrical granulation product from the blend obtained in the aforementioned blending step using an extrusion granulating machine, and a drying step for drying the granulation product obtained in the aforementioned granulation step, wherein the granulation product after drying by the aforementioned drying step has a bulk density of 0.4 to 0.7 g/ml, and a hardness of 1 to 20 N, preferably 2 to 15 N, and more preferably 3 to 12 N. The blending step is preferably a step for blending 100 parts by weight of a nigrosine dye and 20 to 55 parts by weight of water (preferably 30 to 45 parts by weight of water) using a rotary mechanical mixer. The granulation step is preferably operated using a granulating machine such as an extrusion granulating machine.<br>
Hardness is important to the granulated colorant of the present<br>
invention.	By    appropriately    adjusting    the     hardness     thereof,     the<br>
granulated colorant of the present invention is obtained with two characteristics: a loss of shape is unlikely and stability and ease of handling are maintained during transportation, charge and the like, and the nigrosine is well dispersible in the resin during blending or kneading with the resin in coloring the resin at the time of resin molding and the like. The hardness of the granulated colorant (i.e., the granulation product after<br><br>
18<br>
the granulation drying step) is 1 to 20 N. Preferably, the hardness is 2 to 15 N, more preferably 3 to 12 N.<br>
Adjustment of the hardness of the granulated colorant of the present invention can be achieved by, for example, adjusting the granulation pressure and/or revolution speed of the extrusion granulating machine in the granulation step for granulating the blend obtained in the blending step using the extrusion granulating machine. In addition to this adjustment of the hardness in the granulation step, a granulation product with an appropriately adjusted hardness can be obtained efficiently by adjusting the hardness of the blend after the blending step for blending a nigrosine dye and a binder preferably to 1 to 20 N, more preferably to 2 to 15 N.<br>
In addition to water, non-water binders can be used as the binder for obtaining the granulated colorant of the present invention. Examples of the binder other than water alone include a surfactant, wax, metal soap, polyethylene glycol, or a mixture of any of these and water.<br>

In addition to the above-described ingredients, the granulated colorant may be supplemented as appropriate with commonly used heat stabilizers, antioxidants, ultraviolet absorbents, fillers and the like<br>
High-concentration master batch production process using the granulated colorant<br>
The high-concentration master batch of the present invention is a master batch obtained by blending at least the above-described granulated colorant of the present invention and a thermoplastic resin, which comprises 25 to 100 parts by weight (more preferably 60 to 100 parts by weight) of a nigrosine dye in the granulated colorant per 100 parts by weight of the thermoplastic resin. The high-concentration master batch of the present invention can also be obtained using a mixture of the granulated colorant of the present invention and an ungranulated nigrosine dye (e.g., powdery nigrosine dye) as the colorant. For example, when the granulated colorant of the present invention accounts for at least 70% by weight (preferably not less than 75% by weight, more preferably not less than 80% by weight) of the nigrosine dye used as the colorant, the high-concentration master batch of the present invention uniformly comprising a nigrosine dye at a high concentration can be obtained.<br>
The effect of the high-concentration master batch of the present invention is remarkable particularly when the nigrosine dye concentration<br><br>
21<br>
is high. Hence, the high-concentration master batch of the present invention permits easy and sure obtainment of a master batch uniformly comprising a nigrosine dye at a high concentration (e.g., not less than 40% by weight). In the case of a conventional master batch wherein a powdery nigrosine dye is dry-blended, the nigrosine dye concentration is about 20 to 40% by weight, the upper limit being about 40% by weight. However, a high-concentration master batch using the granulated colorant of the present invention can be made to have a nigrosine dye concentration of 40 to 50% by weight or more, and prevents bridging and the like by the nigrosine dye in the hopper in the master batch production step.<br>
The high-concentration master batch of the present invention is obtained by a production method comprising a blending step for blending a powdery nigrosine dye and water, a granulation step for obtaining a cylindrical granulation product from the blend obtained in the aforementioned blending step using an extrusion granulating machine, a drying step for drying the granulation product obtained in the aforementioned granulation step (wherein the granulation product after drying by the drying step has a bulk density of 0.4 to 0.7 g/ml and a hardness of 1 to 20 N, preferably 2 to 15 N, more preferably 3 to 12 N), and a blend-molding step for blending at least the granulated colorant obtained via the aforementioned drying step and a thermoplastic resin, and molding the blend into a master batch comprising 25 to 100 parts by weight of a nigrosine dye in the aforementioned granulated colorant per 100 parts by weight of the aforementioned thermoplastic resin using an extruding machine (e.g., master batch in the form of resin pellet).<br><br>
22<br>
Specifically, a master batch in the form of pellet can be obtained by, for example, blending the granulated colorant of the present invention and a resin, and if necessary other materials, as uniformly as possible, by an optionally chosen method of blending, homogenizing this blend by kneading in a molten state using a heated extruding machine, then extruding it into wire shape and cutting the wire to a desired length.<br>
As the aforementioned thermoplastic resin, polyamide (nylon) resin, polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin, polyethylene terephthalate resin, polybutylene terephthalate resin, polyphenylene sulfide resin, polycarbonate resin, polysulfone resin and polyether ether ketone resin and the like can be mentioned. The high-concentration master batch of the present invention can also be formulated with various additives (e.g., auxiliary colorant, wax etc.) as necessary.<br>
Colored composition using the granulated colorant or master batch<br>
The colored composition of the present invention is a colored composition obtained by blending at least the granulated colorant of the present invention or the high-concentration master batch of the present invention and a thermoplastic resin or thermoplastic elastomer, wherein 0.01 to 10 parts by weight (preferably 0.01 to 5 parts by weight) of a nigrosine dye in the aforementioned granulated colorant or high-concentration master batch is contained per 100 parts by weight of the aforementioned thermoplastic resin or thermoplastic elastomer. An ungranulated nigrosine dye (e.g., powdery nigrosine dye) can be used as a colorant along with a granulated colorant, as described above.<br>

23<br>
present invention include polyamide (nylon) resin, polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin, polyethylene terephthalate resin, polybutylene terephthalate resin, polyphenylene sulfide resin, polycarbonate resin, polysulfone resin, polyether ether ketone resin and the like. These thermoplastic resins can be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds. A copolymer or mixture based mainly on these polymers; or a polymer alloy comprising these thermoplastic resins at not less than 10% by weight, and the like can also be used.<br>
A preferable thermoplastic resin is 1 or 2 or more synthetic resins selected from the group consisting of polyamide resin, polyethylene terephthalate resin, polybutylene terephthalate resin, and polyphenylene sulfide resin.<br>
Examples of the thermoplastic elastomer in the colored composition<br>
of the present invention include thermoplastic elastomers such as<br>
polystyrene-series	thermoplastic	elastomers,	polyolefin-series<br>

The colored composition of the present invention produces molded products having excellent impact resistance and appearance, and is highly practical. The colored composition of the present invention has an at least 10% better elongation characteristic compared with the same composition, but not containing a colorant.<br>
The colored composition of the present invention can contain a reinforcing material and a filling material, as long as the object of the present  invention   is  not  interfered  with.      Examples  of these  reinforcing<br><br>
24<br>
materials and filling materials include fibrous, powdery, granular or tabular inorganic fillers such as glass fiber, carbon fiber, aromatic polyamide fiber, gypsum fiber, brass fiber, stainless steel fiber, steel fiber, ceramic fiber, boron whisker fiber, graphite, mica, talc, silica, calcium carbonate, glass beads, glass flakes, glass microbaloons, clay, wallastenite, titanium oxide, and molybdenum disulfide.

In the case of glass fiber, for example, the content thereof is preferably 5 to 120 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of thermoplastic resin. If the glass fiber content is less than 5 parts by weight, a satisfactory reinforcing effect is difficult to achieve with the glass fiber; if the glass fiber content exceeds 120 parts by weight, the moldability tends to decrease. Preferably, the glass fiber content is 10 to 60 parts by weight, particularly preferably 20 to 50 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of thermoplastic resin.<br>
Furthermore, the colored composition of the present invention can be formulated with various additives as required. Examples of such additives include auxiliary colorants, dispersing agents, stabilizers, plasticizers, modifiers, ultraviolet absorbents or light stabilizers, antioxidants, antibacterial/antifungal agents, antistatic agents, flame retardants, and elastomers for improved impact resistance.<br>
Examples of modifiers include silicon compounds such as amino-modified silicone oil and alkyl-modified silicone oil.<br>

Example 17 (a) Fluidity test using powder fluidity analyzer<br>
A   fluidity   comparison   test    was   performed    using   the    granulated colorant A-l  obtained in Example  1, the granulated colorant A-10 obtained in Example 10, and the raw material Nigrosine Base SAP. Instrument used:  powder fluidity analyzer FT-4 (manufactured by Sysmex Corporation)<br>
Measuring conditions: flow rate test<br>
Flow rate test: Changes in fluidity at four different blade speeds (100 mm/sec, 70 mm/sec, 40 mm/sec, 10 mm/sec) were evaluated. The results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. As the rate of the figure changes shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 decreases, the fluidity is evaluated to be better.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Blade speed	Granulated colorant A-1	Granulated colorant A-10	Nigrosine Base SAP<br>
100 mm/sec	5374	4354	712<br>
70 mm/sec	5390	4382	858<br>
40 mm/sec	5550	4570	1122<br>
10 mm/sec	5604	4608	1654<br>
As a result of the above-described flow rate test, granulated colorant<br><br>
49<br>
A-l and granulated colorant A-10 exhibited constant fluidity independent of the changes in flow rate (blade speed).      Because Nigrosine Base SAP is powdery and hence has small particle-to-particle gaps, it is speculated that the lower portion of the sample is compacted in the container due to the weight of the upper portion of the sample; if the blade speed is slow, this compaction proceeds to increase the resistance of the lower portion of the sample, which is considered to be among the causes of the fluidity reduction. (b) Fluidity test using simple fluidity tester<br>
Test method: A simple fluidity tester having an opening with a shutter capable of forming a circular opening permitting adjustment of the diameter thereof at the center of the base of a 300-ml cylindrical container was used. After the sample was filled in the simple fluidity tester with the shutter closed, the shutter was gradually opened, and the portion of the sample fallen for each opening diameter was weighed. The measured results are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2. Both PA resin in Table 2 and 6-nylon in Figure 2 refer to polyamide 6 resin.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
Opening diameter (mm)	5	8	10	12	15	20	25	30	35	40	45<br>
PA resin (g)	0.42	0.56	77.06	80.49	82.48	84.53	87.23	90.36	—	—	—<br>
Granulated colorant A-1 (g)	0.48	0.69	0.69	1.12	75.35	80.73	84.57	89.59	—	—	—<br>
Granulated colorant A-10 (g)	1.00	1.00	1.42	1.42	53.83	57.57	70.17	78.71	—	—	—<br>
Nigrosine Base SAP (g)	1.01	1.01	1.01	1.01	1.51	2.22	2.22	3.06	6.79	9.83	71.38<br>
Based on these results of the fluidity determination, an approximation curve were generated to obtain equations showing the relationship between opening  diameter  (abscissa:   x)  and  the  ratio  by  weight  of the  portion  of<br><br>
50<br>
sample fallen to the entire sample (ordinate: y), and the opening diameter corresponding to a fall of 50% by weight of the sample quantity filling in the simple fluidity tester, x50, was calculated. As the opening diameter x50 decreases, the fluidity is evaluated to be better.<br>
The equations showing the relationship between opening diameter (abscissa: x) and the ratio by weight of the portion of sample fallen to the entire sample (ordinate: y) and the opening diameter corresponding to a fall of 50% by weight of the sample quantity, x50, for each sample are shown below.<br>
Polyamide 6 resin: y = 38.251x - 305.45 (If y = 50, x50 = 9.29 mm)<br>
Granulated colorant A-l: y = 24.744x - 295.82 (If y = 50, x50 = 13.9 mm)<br>
Granulated colorant A-10: y = 17.469x - 208.20 (If y = 50, x50 = 14.7 mm) Nigrosine Base SAP: y = 12.309x - 482.53 (If y = 50, x50 = 43.3 mm)<br>
As shown above, the fluidities of granulated colorant A-l and granulated colorant A-10 were relatively close to the fluidity of polyamide 6 resin, whereas the fluidity of Nigrosine Base SAP, which is a powdery nigrosine, was much inferior to the fluidities of granulated colorant A-l and granulated colorant A-10. Comparing the fluidities of granulated colorant A-l, which is in the form of a cylindrical pellet, and granulated colorant A-10, which is in the form of a flake, granulated colorant A-l exhibited better fluidity.<br><br>
