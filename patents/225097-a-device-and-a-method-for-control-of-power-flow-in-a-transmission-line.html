A device and a method for control of power flow in a transmission line<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a device and a method for control of power flow in a three-phase transmission line. More precisely the invention concerns a power control device and method wherein an additional voltage is serially applied to the transmission line, for each of its phases. The additional voltage is generated in dependence on a controllable part of the voltage between the other two phases of the transmission line. The invention is also related to a use of such a device for control of the distribution of transmitted power between parallel transmission lines and for damping of oscillations in active power between two power networks interconnected by means of a transmission line.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A transmission line in this context shall mean a three-phase ac line that interconnects two electric power networks and transmits active power between the power networks.<br>
Different kinds of devices for both static and dynamic control of the power flow in such a transmission line are known. The object of the control may be a static distribution of power between power lines or power networks, as well as damping of power oscillations in the transmission line.<br>
One such known device is a so-called phase shifting transformer (PST). The device comprises, for each of the phases of the transmission line, a series transformer, the secondary winding of which is connected into the phase conductor, and a shunt transformer, the primary winding of which is connected between the other two phase conductors. The secondary winding of the shunt transformer is provided with an on-ioad tap changer and its secondary voltage, which is thus variable, is applied to the primary winding of the series transformer. The additional voltage which arises across the series transformer, and which is thus a series voltage vectorially added to the voltage of the phase conductor, attains, by this connection, a phase position that is displaced by 90° relative to the phase voltage of the phase conductor. By varying the amplitude of the additional voltage by means of the on-load tap changer, the power flow in the transmission line is influenced.<br><br>
Such a phase-shifting transformer will be further described in the following.<br>
As an alternative to the use of on-load tap changer, the secondary voltage of the shunt transformer may be applied to converter equipment, suitable for the purpose, for electronic control of the amplitude of the secondary voltage, for example by phase-angle control.<br>
The on-load tap changer constitutes a mechanical component that requires maintenance and is subjected to wear. Further, it is relatively slow, the time for a change of the amplitude of the additional voltage being of the order of magnitude of seconds.<br>
Electronic control of the amplitude of the additional voltage may be made faster but, because of its principle of operation, it injects harmonics in the transmission line.<br>
Another such known device is a so-called universal power flow controller (UPFC). A three-phase transformer is connected in shunt connection to the transmission line and the secondary voltage of the transformer is applied to a first three-phase converter of the type pulse-width-modulated, self-commutated voltage-source converter. A second converter of the same kind is connected, by means of a dc voltage intermediate link with a capacitor, to the first converter and the second converter is connected, via its ac terminals, to series transformers connected to the transmission line. As is known, the output voltage of the second converter allows itself to be controlled both with respect to amplitude and phase angle, and may thus be used for a fast and continuous control of both active and reactive power.<br>
The amount of power electronics is, however, relative extensive and complicated and this type of controller is therefore less attractive. Further, this type of converter exhibits sensitivity to short-circuit currents and is inclined to apply harmonic associated with the fundamental frequency of the transmission line, as well as harmonics associated with the carrier frequency of the pulse-width modulation.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a device and a method of the kind described in the introduction, which, in relation to the prior art, constitute an improvement with respect to the above-mentioned drawbacks.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention according to the features in the characterizing part of the independent claim 1 and according to a method as claimed in the independent claim 11. Preferred embodiments are described in the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by arranging on a first phase of the transmission line a transformer with its secondary winding in series connection with the first phase of the transmission line and its primary winding in connection with a closed circuit comprising a variable reactance impedance means, the reactance of which being selectively varied by a controller containing a processor. In a further advantageous development of the invention a first end of the primary winding is connected to earth and a second end of the primary winding is connected to a second phase of the transmission line with a series circuit containing a reactive impedance element for receiving a voltage in dependence of the second phase transmission line voltage.<br>
In yet a further advantageous development of the invention a first end of the primary winding is connected to a second phase of the transmission line with a first series circuit containing a first reactive impedance element and a second end of the primary winding is connected to a third phase of the transmission line with a second series circuit containing a second reactive impedance element for receiving a voltage in dependence of the second phase transmission line voltage. In one embodiment of this development of the invention the first and second reactive impedance element comprises a fixed reactance. In a second embodiment ol this development of the invention the variable reactance impedance means of the closed circuit comprises a first variable reactance impedance element and a second variable reactance impedance element.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the object is achieved by coupling, for each of the phases of the transmission line, to the respective phase, a series circuit with a first and a second terminal and a connection point, the series circuit comprising a first reactive impedance element advanta-<br><br>
geously having a fixed reactance connected between the first terminal and the connection point, and a second reactive impedance element with controllable reactance connected between the connection point and the second terminal, whereby one of said terminals is coupled to the respective phase of the transmission line and the other terminal is coupled to a terminal at each of the other two series circuits such that, for all the phases, either the first or the second terminal is coupled to the transmission line, that the additional voltage is formed in dependence on the voltage between the connection points at the other two series circuits, and that the control of the power flow is performed by varying the reactance of the second impedance element.<br>
In an advantageous further development of the invention, the second impedance element comprises a series circuit of one inductive and one capacitive reactance element so dimensioned in relation to each other that the phase position of the additional voltage may be varied to lie both before and after the phase position for the voltage of the transmission line in the respective phase, such that the active power flow in the transmission line may be influenced both in an increasing and a decreasing direction.<br>
In another advantageous further development of the invention, the first impedance element comprises a first fixed inductor and the second impedance element comprises a cross-magnetized inductor with a magnetic core, a main winding for alternating current, and a control winding for direct current, the reactance of the second impedance element being varied by controlling a magnetic flux associated with the main winding by orthogonal magnetization of the magnetic flux in dependence on a direct current applied to the control winding.<br>
In still another advantageous further development of the invention, the first reactive impedance element comprises a first fixed inductor, and the second impedance element comprises inductor equipment with a number of mutually series-connected fixed second inductors, each one of these being parallel-connected to a controllable short-circuit device, the reactance of the second impedance element being varied by respectively activating and deactivating the short-circuit devices.<br>
In yet another advantageous further development of the invention, the second impedance element comprises inductor and capacitor equipment with a number of mutually series-connected fixed capacitors, each one of these being parallel-connected to a controllable short-circuit device in series with an inductor, the reactance of the second impedance element being varied by respectively<br><br>
actance of the second impedance element being varied by respectively activating and deactivating the short-circuit devices.<br>
When arranging an inductive reactance unit in series with a valve in a capacitive reactance unit the capacitive unit is capable of being boosted, by which technique the reactance is capable of being continuous varied within a defined range. This technique is well known from Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitors (TCSC) and uses the ability for the capacitor to appear larger in ohms.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention and applicable to any of the embodiments above the device comprises a control unit comprising a computer. A computer program loaded in the computer senses the voltage of each phase of the transmission line and controls the switching devices and the boosting function of each serial circuit.<br>
Additional advantageous further developments of the invention will be clear from the following description and the appended claims.<br>
With a device according to the invention, the following advantages are achieved, inter alia.<br>
Shunt inductors already present in the transmission line may be utilized as a component in the device.<br>
No mechanically movable parts, nor any converter equipment with continuous control are required.<br>
The device does not apply any harmonics to the transmission line.<br>
The device may also be utilized as a shunt inductor to absorb reactive power when control of power flow is of secondary interest.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following description relates to the method, the device as well as the use of the device.<br>
Throughout the description the same reference numerals are used in the various figures for those parts of the device, and for quantities occurring in the device, which are of the same kind.<br>
Figure 1A shows a first power network NW1, connected to a second power network NW2 via a three-phase transmission line with the phase conductors La, Lb and Lc. The three phases are designated a, b and c.<br>
A prior art phase-shifting transformer (PST) 1 is connected to the transmission line between two nodes Nl and N2. The voltage of the transmission line at the node Nl is designated V 1 in vector form, the components of the vector consist of the phase voltages Va, Vb and Vc of the node. Analogously/ the voltage at the node 2 is designated V 2 .<br>
For simplicity, the figure only shows that part of the transformer that belongs to the phase c. The phase-shifting transformer comprises a shunt transformer 11, the primary winding 111 of which is connected between the phase conductors La and Lb in the transmission line. The secondary winding 112 of the shunt transformer is provided with an on-load tap changer 113, only roughly indicated in the figure. A series transformer 12c has a secondary winding 122c connected into the phase conductor Lc and its primary winding 121c is connected to the secondary winding of the shunt transformer between a terminal on the on-load tap changer of the shunt transformer and an end terminal on the secondary winding. The additional voltage VSc occurring across the series transformer attains, by this con-<br><br>
nection, a phase position that is displaced by 90° relative to the phase voltage Vc. The position of the on-load tap changer may be changed in dependence on a control signal (not shown in the figure), and the voltage applied to the primary winding of the series transformer, and hence the amplitude for the additional voltage VSc, are thus dependent on a controllable part of the voltage between the phases a and b. Although not shown in the figure, it should, of course, be understood that a series transformer of the same kind as the series transformer 12c is connected to each of the other two phases of the transmission line and that a voltage is applied thereto in an analogous manner.<br>
Figure IB shows in vector form the relationship between the node voltages V T, V2 and VS , where thus the voltage VS has components VSa, VSb and VSc, where VSa and VSb thus represent additional voltages occurring across the series transformers (not shown). The phase-shifting transformer thus achieves a phase shift, in Figure IB designated *, between the voltages in the nodes 1 and 2. The flow of active power P between the nodes is determined, as is known, besides by the node voltages and the impedance of the transmission line between the nodes, by the factor sin* and may thus be influenced by changing the position of the on-load tap changer.<br>
Figure 2 shows an embodiment of a device according to the invention. In the same way as for the known device according to Figure 1A, for the sake of simplicity Figure 2 only shows that part of the device that belongs to the phase c. Compared with the known device described with reference to Figure 1 A, the shunt transformer with its on-load tap changer have been replaced by other components, which will be described in greater detail below.<br>
A series circuit formed from reactive impedance elements comprises a first reactive impedance element with a fixed reactance in the form of a fixed inductor 21a and a second reactive impedance element with a variable reactance in the form of a controllable inductor 22a and a capacitor 23a connected in series. The first impedance element is connected between a first terminal Tl at the series circuit and a connection point Ja belonging to the series circuit. The second impedance element is connected between the connection point Ja and a second terminal T2a at the series circuit. The first terminal Tla is coupled to the phase conductor La of the transmission line.<br><br>
A series circuit of the same kind as that described above comprises a fixed inductor 21b, a controllable inductor 22b, and a capacitor 23b. This series circuit has a first terminal Tib, a second terminal T2b, and a common connection point Jb. The inductors 2Tb, 22b, and the capacitor 23b are interconnected and connected to the terminals and the connection point in a manner analogous to that described above. The first terminal Tib of the series circuit is coupled to the phase conductor Lb and the two terminals T2a and T2b are mutually coupled to each other.<br>
As in the device described with reference to Figure 1A, the series transformer 12c is connected with its secondary winding 122c into the phase conductor Lc, whereas its primary winding 121c is coupled between the connection points Ja andjb.<br>
It is realized that a device of the above kind achieves a phase shift between the node voltages V1 and V 2 in a manner similar to that described with reference to Figure 1 A. The flow of active power P between the nodes is thus also determined, in this device, besides by the node voltages and the impedance of the transmission line between the nodes, by the factor sin f, which in turn, as is easily realized, is dependent on the voltage between the connection points Ja and Jb,<br>
This voltage, in turn, obviously depends on the relationships between the reactances of the first and second impedance elements, that is, the flow of active power between the nodes Nl and N2 is influenced when the reactance for the second impedance element is varied. The relative influence from the second impedance element increases with increasing transmitted power in the transmission line.<br>
The controllable inductor comprised in the second impedance element achieves a voltage component VSc with a phase position in relation to the phase position of the phase voltage of the transmission line such that the power flow in the transmission line from the node Nl to the node N2 is influenced in a decreasing direction. The capacitor comprised in the second impedance element achieves a voltage component VSc with a phase position in relation to the phase position for the phase voltage of the transmission line such that the power flow in the transmission line from the node Nl to the node N2 is influenced in an increasing direction.<br><br>
By a suitable dimensioning of the reactances for the controllable inductor and capacitor in relation to each other, the phase position for the additional voltage VSc may be caused to vary to be both before and behind the phase position for the phase voltage Vic of the transmission line by variation of the reactance for the controllable inductor. In this way, thus, controllability is obtained in both directions for the active power flow in the transmission line such that the active power flow in the transmission line may be influenced both in an increasing and a decreasing direction.<br>
The controllable inductor comprised in the second impedance element may, in an advantageous embodiment of the invention, be constituted by an inductor controllable by means of so-called cross magnetization. Such an inductor has a magnetic core with a main winding for alternating current and is, in addition thereto, provided with a control winding for direct current. By varying a direct current supplied to the control winding, the magnetic flux associated with the main winding is influenced by orthogonal magnetization of the magnetic core. Such a cross-magnetized inductor is known, for example, from US patent 4,393,157.<br>
Figure 3A shows the embodiment according to Figure 2 with all of the three phases illustrated. A series transformer 12a has a secondary winding connected into the phase conductor La, and a series transformer 12b has a secondary winding connected into the phase conductor Lb. An additional voltage VSa arises across the series transformer 12a, and an additional voltage VSb arises across the series transformer 12b.<br>
A series circuit of the same kind as those described with reference to Figure 2 comprises a fixed inductor 21c, a controllable inductor 22c, and a capacitor 23c. This series circuit has a first terminal Tic, a second terminal T2c, and a common connection point Jc. The inductors 21c and 22c and the capacitor 23c are connected to each other and to the terminals and the connection point in a manner analogous to that described above. The first terminal Tic of the series circuit is coupled to the phase conductor Lc and the terminals T2a, T2b and T2c are mutually coupled to each other and shown in the figure as coupled to ground potential.<br>
The series transformers 12a and 12b are connected with their secondary windings into the respective phase conductors La and Lb. The primary winding of the series transformer 12a is coupled between the connection points Jb and Jc, whereas<br><br>
the primary winding of the series transformer 12b is coupled between the connection points Ja and Jc.<br>
Figure 3B shows in vector form the relationship between the node voltages V 1, vl and the additional voltage VS , where thus the voltage vH has the components Via, VXb and Vic, the voltage V2 has the components Via, V2b and V2c. VS has the components VSa, VSb and VSc,<br>
Figure 4A shows a further embodiment of a device according to the invention. Contrary to the embodiment described in connection with Figure 3A, the respective first terminals Tla, Tib and Tic of the series circuits, in this embodiment, are connected to centre taps 123a, 123b and 123c on the secondary windings of the respective series transformer. Further, for the phase a, the second impedance element 22a comprises inductor equipment with a number of mutually series-connected fixed inductors, which for reasons of space are only shown as two inductors 221a and 223a in the figure. Each one of the fixed inductors 221a and 223a may be bypassed by means of a controllable short-circuit device, in the figure illustrated as a thyristor switch 222a and 224a, respectively, which may be influenced by a control signal (not shown). The respective second impedance elements for the phases b and c are designed in an analogous manner and comprise, for the phase b, fixed inductors 221b and 223b (the designations being omitted in the figure to render it more readily readable) with thyristor switches 222b and 224, respectively, and, for the phase c, fixed inductors 221c and 223c with thyristor switches 222c and 224c, respectively.<br>
For reasons of space, only two series-connected fixed inductors per phase are shown in the figure, but the number may, of course, be advantageously increased to increase the possibilities of control of the reactance of the second impedance element. Preferably, the inductance values for the inductors 221a, 223a,.... are chosen according to a geometrical scale to further increase the possibilities of variation of the reactance of the second impedance element.<br>
Figure 4B shows in vector form the relationship between the node voltages V 1, V2 and the additional voltage VS in this embodiment of the invention. By connecting the respective first terminals Tla, Tib and Tic of the series circuits to the centre taps 123a, 123b and 123c on the secondary windings of the series transformers, the advantage is achieved, contrary to the embodiment described with<br><br>
reference to Figure 3, that the node voltage V 2 will have the same amplitude as the node voltage V T.<br>
Figure 5 shows a use of a device according to the invention. Two three-phase transmission lines LI and L2 connect nodes Nl and N2. Node Nl is supplied, via a transformer T, with power from a generator G. To node N2, a load C is connected. Of the power supplied to node Nl, one part PI is distributed on the transmission line LI and one part PI is distributed on the transmission line L2. The nominal voltage of the transmission lines is 400 kV.<br>
A device 2 according to the invention is coupled to the transmission line L2. The device is illustrated in a simplified single-line diagram, but it is to be understood that it is designed, for example, in the manner described with reference to Figure 3A. The first reactive impedance element with a fixed reactance thus comprises an inductor 21, and the second reactive impedance element comprises an inductor 22 with a variable reactance and, in series connection therewith, a fixed capacitor 23.<br>
In the embodiment of the invention shown I fig 5 the device also comprises a control unit 30 containing computer means 31 and memory means 32 for storing data and a computer program. The control unit also comprises sensor means 33 for receiving control data and a plurality of actuator means 34,35 for controlling the reactance of the variable reactive impedance element of the different phases.<br>
In a practical embodiment, the load C consumes an active power of 600 MW and a reactive power of 150 MVAr, that is, PI + PI = 600M W .<br>
The series transformer 12 has a rated power of 135 MVA, a transformation ratio of 60/60 kV, and a short-circuit reactance of 10 %.<br>
The fixed inductor 21 has a rated power of 120 MVAr at 400 kV, corresponding to a reactance of 1 333 ohms. The reactor 22 has a reactance that is variable in the interval of 30-150 ohms whereas the capacitor 23 has a fixed reactance of -60 ohms. The reactance of the second reactive impedance element may thus in this case be varied from -30 ohms to +90 ohms.<br>
Studies have shown that the power P2 can be controlled from 150 MW to 450 MW when the reactance of the second impedance element is varied from - 30<br><br>
ohm to + 90 ohms. The voltage across the second reactive impedance element thereby varies within the interval of 46 - 56 kV whereas the current through the impedance element varies within the interval 1.14 - 0.25 kA,<br>
In the embodiment of the invention according to fig 6 a further development of the second reactive impedance element is shown. In the simplified connection chart shown there is arranged a plurality of reactive impedance circuits 22,23 each containing a branch comprising a valve element 27. In a reactive impedance circuit 22 comprising a inductive element closing the valve will cause a short circuit state. In a reactive impedance circuit 23 comprising a capacitive element an open valve will make the reactive impedance capacitive and a closed valve will make the reactive impedance capacitive and inductive.<br>
Both the capacitive and the inductive reactance units are in the embodiment in fig 6 thyristor switched. Two capacitive units and two inductive units are indicated. The actual number may however vary from installation to installation. Consequently, there may be any number of inductive reactance units and/or capacitive reactance units in the general case.<br>
As already indicated, the sizes of the capacitive 23 and inductive 22 reactance units, in ohms, are preferably arrange according to a binary sequence such that a high resolution control range can be obtained with relatively few units.<br>
The circumstance that there is an inductive reactance unit 23L in series with the valve in the capacitive reactance unit 23 makes it possible to "boost" the capacitive unit. The concept of boosting a capacitor is a well-known technique, e.g. from the context of Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitors (TCSC), which provides a mean for making the capacitor appear larger in ohms (fundamental frequency component) than it actually is. Having the ability to boost the capacitive reactance unit is thus advantageous.<br>
Combining binary sized reactance units and the ability to boost one capacitive reactance units 1 pu makes it possible to provide virtually infinite control resolution. Table 1 illustrates one example with 4 binary sized inductive reactance units (XCR1-XCR4) and two binary sized capacitive reactance units (XCR5,XCR6), where there is a possibility to boost the last unit (XCR6) 1 pu, in this case 50% boost, such that it can assume any reactance between -2 and -3 pu. By doing this it is possible to assume any value within the control range (-4 pu to 13 pu).<br><br><br><br>
damages due to these large voltages, a surge arresters 26 is installed at each phase for instantaneous limitation of the voltage. In order to limit the energy absorbed by the surge arrestors, the thyristor control unit turns all thyristors on such that the controllable reactance units are by-passed through the thyristor valves and the voltages are thereby reduced to a safe level. If the current through the valves becomes too large, such that it with time tends to over-heat the valves, there is an option to close a mechanical by-pass breaker 25 which normally is open. In order to protect each individual reactance unit against damaging high voltages, the thyristor control unit will also invoke a thyristor by-pass based on the magnitude of the current increasing above a given threshold.<br>
The control of the reactance of the second impedance element occurs in some manner known to the person skilled in the art by supplying a deviation between a sensed value of active power in the transmission line and a reference value thereof to a controller, whereby a reference value for desired reactance is formed in dependence on an output signal from the controller. In the event that the second impedance element consists of a cross-magnetized inductor, this reference value may be in the form of a suitably adapted direct current supplied to the control winding of the inductor. In the event that the second impedance element comprises fixed inductors provided with short-circuit devices, as described with reference to Figure 4A, these short-circuit devices may be activated, for example by choosing in a table of the relationship between reactance and activated short-circuit device(s).<br>
In Fig 7 another advantageous control objective of the device according to the invention is illustrated. As long as the sensed apparent power flow or sensed current on the line under consideration is within limit the device according to the invention is neutral. If the limit S""* is violated, the device is activated and controlled so as to bring it within the limit.<br>
In Fig. 8 another advantageous control objective of the device according to the invention is illustrated. As long as the sensed active power flow on the line under consideration is within limits the device according to the invention is neutral. If one of the limits P™ or P"" is violated, the device is activated and controlled so as to bring it within the limits.<br>
In Fig. 9 another advantageous control objective of the device according to the invention is illustrated. Instead of using the sensed active power flow as an indi-<br><br>
cation of how hard the transmission path is loaded (as in Fig. 8), the sensed or estimated angle spread is used. This may be advantageous for transmission interfaces which have stability induced limits. As long as the angle spread over the transmission path under consideration is within limits the device according to the invention is neutral. If one of the limits £™x or 5]£* is violated, the device is<br>
activated and controlled so as to bring it within the limits.<br>
Transmission corridor limits due to stability problems, voltage or angle, are usually expressed in terms of maximum allowable P-transfer. The P-limit reflects that the transmission network is highly loaded. Another measure of the loading, more appropriate in this situation, is the angle spread over<br>
When damping power oscillations, a signal representing oscillations in the active power in the transmission line is formed in some manner known to the person skilled in the art, and this signal, after suitable signal processing, is summed to the output signal from the above-mentioned controller.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiments shown, but, of course, the person skilled in the art may modify it in a plurality of ways within the scope of the invention as defined in the claims. Thus, of course, the embodiment described with reference to Figure 4A may be equipped with capacitors in a manner corresponding to the capacitors 23a, 23b and 23c in connection with the embodiment described with reference to Figure 3A.<br>
The capacitors may also be individually divided into a number of series-connected units, in which each unit is equipped with a controllable short-circuit device of a kind similar to that described with reference to Figure 4A<br>
As mentioned above, in the embodiment described with reference to Figure 4A, the second impedance element 22a, 22b and 22c, respectively, may preferably be made with a larger number of mutually series-connected fixed inductors than what is shown in Figure 4A.<br>
The fixed reactance of the first impedance element may advantageously consist of a shunt inductor present in the transmission line.<br><br><br>
