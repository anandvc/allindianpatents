				<td>Technical  Field of the Invention<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a method and a control device for generating a transmit power level of  a  wireless  communication  apparatus  for  operation  in  a  wireless  communication system.<br><br><br>
Description of Related Art<br><br><br><br>
Progress  in  radio  and  VLSI  (Very  Large  Scale  Integration)   technology  has  fostered widespread use of radio communications in consumer applications . Portable devices, such as mobile terminals, can be produced having acceptable cost, size and power consumption due to large scale, inexpensive production of versatile chips having small size and low power consumption.<br><br><br>
An element in any multi-user communication system is a medium access control (MAC) scheme. When several users make use of the same bearer medium, such as radio, that can support the exchange of information, a suitable access scheme may be designed to give each user access to the communication channel while minimizing interference and delay. If the number of users is small, a polling scheme can be used in which a central controller (such as a master in Bluetooth®) sequentially polls the units to check if they have information to send. If the offered traffic is low, polling may introduce overhead and may introduce unnecessary delay as users are polled that have no desire to access the channel.<br><br><br>
In  that  case,  a  random  access  scheme  may  be  more  efficient.  For  example  in  cellular telephone systems, such as GSM, a random access channel (RACH) exists in the uplink (from terminal to base station). The RACH is a channel on which a terminal can send a request message to be allocated a dedicated traffic or communication channel by the base<br>
station. When two or more terminals send a request message simultaneously, a collision may occur at the base station receiver. A suitable contention resolution scheme has to be implemented to resolve such simultaneous access attempts.<br><br>
A random back-off method  may be used to avoid that  two or more terminals  repeatedly collide  with each  other.  However  this  introduces extra  delay  (i.e.  latency)  in the  access method.<br><br><br>
A contention resolution scheme works effectively if signals received from slave units have similar  signal  strength  when  received.  A  wireless  communication  network  employing  a random access scheme may suffer from the near far effect, i.e. signals from a first communication apparatus being located closer to a network node, which operates as master unit, overshadow signals from a second communication apparatus being located farther away from the network node. In such situations, signals from the second communication apparatus may not be received by the network node at all, or be received only when all other units in a cell make no requests for a communication channel. This is a problem, because it may take a long time to establish a communication channel to a unit located at the border of the cell operated by the network node.<br><br><br>
Another problem with transmissions according to a random access scheme is that when fixed transmit power levels are utilized the power resources may not be utilized effectively. This may particularly be a problem in a battery powered communication apparatus having limited power resources.<br><br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br><br><br><br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an effective access scheme in a wireless communication network.<br><br><br>
According  to  a  first  aspect,  a  method  for  generating  a  transmit  power  level  for  a communication  apparatus  for  operation  in  a  wireless  communication  network  having  a network  node  comprises:  transmitting  to  the  network  node  a  first  request  message,  for requesting access to a communication channel, using a first transmit power level by the communication apparatus; determining  based on access information  derived from received data whether an access collision occurred at the network node as a consequence of the first request message; and generating, based on the determination, a second transmit power level to be used for transmitting a second request message.<br><br>
The  step  of generating may  comprise  setting  the  value of the second  transmit  power  level equal  to  the  value  of  the  first  transmit  power  level  if  it  is  determined   from  the  access information  that an access collision occurred at the network node.<br><br><br>
The step of generating may comprise  generating the second transmit  power level based on the first transmit  power  level and  a power adjustment,  and  applying  the second  transmit  power level when the second  request message for requesting  access to the communication channel is transmitted.<br><br><br>
The transmit power adjustment  may be received from the network node.<br><br><br><br>
The  step   of  generating  may  comprise   generating   the  second   transmit   power   level  by increasing  the first transmit  power  level if it is determined  from  the access  information  that access  collision  did  not occur  at the  network  node,  and  that  access  to the  communication channel  was not granted;  or decreasing  the first transmit  power level if it is determined  from the access information  that access collision did not occur at the network node, and that access to the communication channel  was granted.<br><br><br>
The step  of decreasing may  be carried  out only if it is determined  that the second  transmit power level will be equal to or above a minimum transmit power level.<br><br><br>
The step  of increasing  may  be carried  out only  if it is determined  that  the second  transmit power level will be equal to or below a maximum transmit  power level.<br><br><br>
The step of determining  may comprise  determining  whether  an  acknowledgement message has been received  in response  to transmitting  the request  message.  The step of determining may  comprise   determining   whether   an  access  condition   has  been  altered,   which   is  an indication that an access collision  occurred  at the network node as a consequence of the first request message.<br><br><br>
The  step  of  determining  whether   an  access   condition   has   been  altered   may  compnse determining  whether  the received data is received in a next beacon message  received within a<br><br>
predetermined time period after a first beacon message has been received. The received data may be an indication of an altered access condition.<br><br><br>
The step of determining may comprise determining, based on the received data of the next beacon message, whether the communication apparatus is allowed to transmit in an access window  indicated  by  the  received  data.  The  access  window  may  be  an  altered  access condition.<br><br><br>
The altered access condition may indicate that another communication apparatus has been granted access to a communication channel. The step of generating may comprise increasing the first transmit power level to generate the second transmit power level in response to the altered access condition.<br><br><br>
According to a second aspect, a control device for generating a transmit power level for a communication  apparatus  for  operation  in  a  wireless  communication  network  having  a network node comprises a controller adapted to generate a request message for requesting access  to a c'ommunication channel,  to  be transmitted  to  the  network  node  using  a first transmit power level.  The controller  is adapted  to determine  based on access information derived from received data whether an access collision occurred at the network node as a consequence of a first access message. The control device also comprises a transmit power control  unit  adapted  to  generate  a  second  transmit  power  level  for  the  communication apparatus in dependence of whether an access collision occurred at the network node. The second transmit power level is to be used for transmitting a second request message.<br><br><br>
The transmit power control unit may be adapted to generate the second transmit power level based on the first transmit  power level and a power adjustment.  Also the transmit power control unit m,ay be adapted to apply the second transmit power level when the second request message for requesting access to the communication channe1 should be transmitted.<br><br><br>
The controller may be adapted to receive the transmit power adjustment from the network node.<br><br>
The transmit  power control  unit may be adapted to generate the second  transmit  power level by increase  the first  transmit  power  level  if access  to  the communication channel  was not granted, or decrease  the current  transmit power level if access to the communication channel was granted.<br><br><br>
The transmit  power  control  unit may  be adapted  to determine  whether  the second  transmit power level will be equal  to or above a minimum transmit  power level, and to only decrease the first transmit  power  level if the second  transmit  power  level  will be equal  to or above a minimum transmit power level.<br><br><br>
The transmit  power  control  unit may  be adapted  to determine  whether  the  second  transmit power level will be equal to or below a maximum transmit  power level, and to only increase the  first transmit  power  level  if the next transmit  power  level  will  be equal  to or  below  a maximum transmit power leveL<br><br><br>
The controller  may be adapted  to determine  whether an acknowledgement message  has been received in response to transmitting  the first request message.<br><br><br>
The controller may also be adapted to determine whether an access condition  has been altered.<br><br><br><br>
Furthermore,  the controller  may  be adapted  to determine  whether  a next beacon  message  is received within a predetermined time period after a first beacon  message  has been received. The next beacon message may include the access information.<br><br><br>
The controller  may be adapted  to determine, based on access information included  in the next beacon  message,  whether  the communication apparatus  is allowed  to transmit  in an access window indicated  by the next beacon message. The access information  may include an altered access condition.<br><br><br>
According to a third aspect, a transceiver  unit comprises the control device.<br><br><br><br>
According to a fourth aspect, a communication apparatus comprises  the control device.<br><br>
According  to  fifth  aspect,  a computer  program  product  comprises  computer  program  code means  for  executing  the  method  for  generating  a transmit  power  level  when  the computer program code means are run by an electronic device having computer  capabilities.<br><br><br>
Further embodiments of the invention  are defined in the dependent  claims. It is an advantage of the invention in that it supports implementation of a fair access scheme in a wireless communication network.<br><br><br>
It should be emphasized  that the term<br><br><br><br>

Detailed Description ofEmbodiments<br><br><br><br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a first and a second communication apparatus 1, 2 for operation in a wireless communication network. The communication apparatus 1 may be adapted to wirelessly communicate with one or several network nodes 3, such as a base station, in the wireless communication network. The communication  apparatus 1, 2 may act as a slave unit. The network node 3 may act as a master unit. The wireless communication network may employ a random access scheme, such as is used in a GPRS, a Bluetooth®, or an IEEE 802.11, or a UMTS  (Universal   Mobile  Telecommunication  Standard)  communication   network.  The network unit 3 may be connected to or be part of another communication network 4, such as a LAN (Local Area Network) or a WAN (Wide Area Network).<br><br><br>
To achieve robustness in the communication network, the communication apparatus 1, 2 is adapted to apply a transmit power control scheme. A request message for a communication channel is transmitted using a first transmit power level. A second transmit power level to be used for transmitting a second request message for requesting access to a communication channel may be generated. The second transmit power level is generated in dependence of whether a collision between the first request message and another request message from a different  communication  apparatuses  operating  in  the  wireless  communication  network occurred at the network node 3 as a consequence of the first request message. In the communication  apparatus  1,  2 it  may be determined  whether  a collision  occurred  at  the network node 3 based on access information derived from received data. The transmit power control scheme  may  be a  scheme for  controlling random  access  transmit  power,  i.e. the transmit power used for transmitting  a random access message for requesting access to a random access network.<br><br><br>
Any  master  unit  in  the  network  node  may  grant  access  to  the  communication  channel. Network node 3, which may receive the request message from the communication apparatus<br>
1,  2,  may  forward  the  request  message  to  another  network  node  in  the  communication network. The other network node may then act as the master unit and determine access to the communication channel.<br><br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an embodiment of a transceiver unit 9 of the communication apparatus 1, 2. Transceiver unit 9 comprises a transmitter (Tx) unit 11, a receiver (Rx) unit 12, a transmit power control unit 13, a controller 14, and a memory 15. Also, the transceiver unit 9 may be connected to an antenna 10 for receiving/transmitting signals from/to the network node 3. The transmit power control unit 13 together with the controller 14 may form a control device for controlling a transmit power level to be utilized by the transmitter unit 11.<br><br><br>
The transmitter unit 11 may comprise various components for establishing a connection with and transmitting signals to the network node 3. Such components may include one or several filters, an  up:converter  for  up- converting  an  IF signal  to  an  RF signal,  and/or  a  power amplifier, such as a variable gain amplifier, for amplifying a signal  to be transmitted. The transmit power level to be used by the transmitter unit 11 may be established by the transmit power control unit 13, which may be connected to various components of the transmitter unit<br>
11, e.g. the power amplifier.<br><br><br><br>
The receiver unit 12 may comprise  various components, such as  one or several filters, a down-converter, and/or a discriminator for deriving data from a received and down- converted signal. The data may be supplied to the controller 14 for further processing.<br><br><br>
The transmit power control unit 13 may be implemented by hardware, such as an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) or an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) . Alternatively, the transmit power control unit 13 is implemented by software code portions to be run by a processor, such as a CPU (Central Processing Unit).<br><br><br>
The controller 14 may be implemented by a processor, such as a CPU. The processor may run software code portions for carrying out the functions of the controller 14.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, the controller 14 is implemented by an ASIC or an FPGA. For example, the controller 14 may be adapted to generate the request message to be transmitted to the network node.  Also,  the   controller   14  may  be  adapted  to  determine   whether   access  to  the communication channel has been granted. Controller 14 may implement the functions of the transmit power control unit 13.<br><br>
9<br><br>
The communfcation apparatus 1, 2 may comprise  one or several  memories,  such as a RAM (Random   Access   Memory),   a  ROM  (Read  Only  Memory)  , a  flash   memory,  and/or  a nonvolatile   memory,  which  are  jointly  illustrated  by  memory  15.  Memory   15  may  store software  code portions  for carrying  out functions  performed  by other  units of the electronic device 1, such as the controller  14 and/or the transmit power control unit 13.<br><br><br>
When   the  communication  apparatus   1,  2  1s operating   in  the  communication  network, collisions  may  occur  at  the  network  node  3  if  two  or  several   requests  for  access  to  a communication channel  are received from different  communication apparatuses  1, 2 simultaneously at the  network  node  3. Also  errors  may occur  due  to other  factors,  such as interference  from  other  communication systems  and/or  noise,  when  the  network  node  is receiving  a request  for  a communication channel,  wherein  the  access  request  might  not be granted.<br><br><br>
If the first communication apparatus  1 acting as a slave is much closer to the network  node 3 acting  as  the  master,  or  if  the  first  communication  apparatus   1 uses  considerably   more transmit   power   than   the   second   communication  apparatus  2   acting   as   a   slave,   first communication apparatus  1 may overshadow  the transmissions of the second communication apparatus  2. That  is,  although  there  is some  interference  from  the  second  communication apparatus  2, the carrier-to-interference ratio (C/1) at the network  node 3 is sufficiently  large such that the network  node 3 can decode the message of the first communication apparatus  1 without  errors.  As  a  result,  the  network  node  3  may  grant  access  to  the  communication channel   for   the   first   communication  apparatus    1,  as   it   is   not   aware   of   the   second communication  apparatus   2  trying  to  get  access.  Therefore,   the  closest   communication apparatus  or the communication apparatus  transmitting  the strongest  signals  (the signals that are received  with the largest RX level) is favoured above the communication apparatus  being most remote  or  being  the  one  that  is transmitting  the  weakest  signals.  To  provide  robust access for all slave devices  operating  in the network, collisions  of request  messages  may be detected. This can be accomplished if collisions  result in errors at the receiver.  Therefore, the contending  signals  should   all  be  received  approximately   at  the  same  power  level  at  the receiver. This requires  automatic  transmit  power control . The transmit  power control  should<br><br><br><br>
10<br><br>
be such that the power received at the master (network node) should be approximately the same for signals received from all slave devices operating in the network.<br><br><br>
The transmit power control may be relatively coarse. For example, in Bluetooth®, errors may occur when the interfering power is less than 8 dB below the desired power (C/I=8dB). The accuracy of the transmit power control may e.g. be within 5-6 dB.<br><br><br>
When it is desired to get access to a communication channel, a request message for requesting access to the communication channel may be transmitted from the communication apparatus<br>
1, 2 to the network node 3. To achieve robustness in the system, the transmit power control scheme may be utilized during an access procedure. A request message for requesting access to a communication channel in the network may be transmitted to the network node 3, which may process tpe request itself or forward the request to any other network node. To transmit the request message, a first transmit power level may be used.<br><br><br>
The transmit power control scheme may be implemented without any explicit feedback from the network node 3. The controller 14 may be adapted to determine whether access to the communication channel is granted by the network node 3 in response to the request message. Furthermore, the transmit power control unit 13 may be adapted to adjust the transmit power level to be utilized by the transmitter unit 11, e.g. for the transmission of a subsequent request message or for the transmission of data in response to having acquired access to the communication  channel.  A  second  transmit  power  level  may  be  used  to  transmit  the subsequent request message. The second transmit power level generated based on whether a collision occurred at the network node 3 due to the first request message. The determination may be made based on access information derived from received data, which is transmitted by the network node 3.<br><br><br>
In an embodiment, the controller 14 may be adapted to determine whether access to the communication channel has been granted by the network node 3 by determining whether received data, which comprises an acknowledgement message as access information, has been received from the network node 3 in response to transmitting the request message. If an acknowledgement message has been received in response to transmitting the request message, the controller may inform the transmit power control unit 13 that the network node 3 granted<br><br>
11<br><br>
access to the communication channel in response to the request message. Consequently, a collision did not occur due to a request message. Then, the transmit power control unit 13 may adjust the transmit power level to be used by the transmitter unit 11, e.g. by decreasing the transmit power level to be used for transmitting a subsequent request message. If an acknowledgement message was not received in response to transmitting the request message, e.g. within a predetermined time period, the controller 14 is adapted to determine whether the network node 3 detected a collision, i.e. whether the network node 3 detected two request messages at the same time.<br><br><br>
According to an embodiment,  if the network node 3 detects a collision  between multiple request messages, the network node 3 alters an access condition in response to detecting the collision. The altered access condition is transmitted to the communication apparatus 1, 2. An access condition may be access information, based on which it may be determined whether a collision occurred at the network node 3. The altered access condition may be detected by the controller  14. The  altered  access  condition  may  be an  access  condition  provided  by  the network node 3 on an access channel. The access condition may be the length of an access window, in which a request message may be sent over the access channel. Alternatively or additionally, the access  condition  may be providing split  access  windows.  A split access window may be an indication of a collision at the network node 3. The split window may be detected by the controller 14 and be an indication of altered access condition. The altered access condition may e.g. be transmitted in a separate message.  Alternatively, the altered access condition is transmitted in another message, which may contain a flag indicating that it carries an altered access condition, e.g. a beacon signal or message.<br><br><br>
By comparing a first access condition valid prior to transmitting a first request message, and a second access condition valid after transmitting the first request message, the controller 14 may determine if a collision occurred at the network node. The network node may alter an access  condition  in  response  to  detecting  a  collision  or  an  error.  If  the  controller  14 determines that the first and the second access conditions are different, the network node 3 detected a collision. Therefore, the communication apparatus 1, 2 may not be granted access to the communication channel if the access condition has been altered. Thus, the controller 14 may inform the transmit power control unit 13 that the network node did not grant access to the communication channel and detected a collision. Then, the transmit power control unit 13<br><br>
may generate the transmit power level to be used by the transmitter unit 11 in dependence of the determined collision and the non-granting of access to the communication channel. The value of the second transmit power level may be set to be equal to the transmit level used to transmit the first transmit power level, e.g. if it is determined from the access information that an access collision occurred at the network node 3. One advantage of this embodiment is that it takes both collisions of request messages at the network node 3 and overshadowing into consideration, wherein the access scheme becomes more effective.<br><br><br>
According to an embodiment, the transmit power control unit 13 may be adapted to generate the transmit power level to be used by the transmitter unit 11. The second transmit power level  may  be generated  based  on  the  power  level  used for  transmitting  the  first  request message  and  a  power  adjustment.  Then, the second  power  level  may  be applied  by the transmit power control l.lllit e.g. by outputting a power level signal to the transmitter unit 11. The second power level may be applied when a subsequent request message for requesting access to a communication channel should be transmitted. The value of the power adjustment may e.g. be stored in the memory 15 and be dependent on whether the network node 3 has granted access to a communication channel in response to a request message. The power adjustment may e.g. be a discrete value, such as t.P, where Pis  a power value.<br><br><br><br><br>
In an embodiment, the controller 14 may be adapted to generate the transmit power level to be used by the transmitter unit 11 by generating a second power level for transmitting a second request message. If it is determined that a collision did not occur at the network node 3 due to the first request message but network node 3 did not grant access to the comml.lllication channel, the transmit power level may be increased. Then, the second transmit power level may  be  generated  by  increasing  a  first  transmit  power  level,  which  was  used  for  the transmission of the first request message. If it is determined that the network node 3 did grant access to the communication  channel in response to the first request message, the transmit power level may be decreased. Then, the second transmit power level may be generated by decreasing  the  first  transmit  power  level.  The  transmit  power  level  may  be increased/decreased by a power adjustment value t.P.<br><br>
In an embodiment, conditional generation  of the power level to be used by the transmitter unit<br><br>
11 is provided by the transmit  power control unit 13. The transmit power level may be limited to a minimum  transmit power level, Pmin, and a maximum  transmit power level, Pmax. Thus, the current  transmit  power  level, which was used for transmitting  a first request  message, is only decreased  if it is determined  that a next transmit  power  level will be equal to or above Pmin. Similarly,  the current  transmit  power level is only increased  if it is determined  that the next transmit power level will be equal to or below Pmax. The next transmit  power level may be applied for transmitting a subsequent  request message.<br><br><br>
Fig. 3 illustrates an embodiment of a method for generating  a transmit  power level m a communication apparatus for  operation  with  a random  access  scheme.  In a first  step  100, transmit  power  control  unit  13 initializes  the transmit  power  level,  P_tx,  by setting  it to an initial transmit power level. Then, the communication apparatus  1, 2 may enter a sleep mode. In  step  101,  the  communication  apparatus    1,  2  may   be  idle.   In  the   idle   state,   the communication apparatus  I  may  wake  up from a sleep  mode  and  may  listen  for  a beacon signal, e.g. at a predetermined beacon instant or for any other reason. However,  if no beacon signal  is transmitted, the communication apparatus  1 may  remain  idle  until  it is desired  to access a communication channel. If a beacon signal is transmitted  or for any other reason, e.g. in response  to a channel  request,  it may be determined  in step  102  whether  it is desired  to access a communication channel.  If the answer in step 1 02 is no, the procedure may return to step  101. If the answer  in step  102 is yes, the procedure  proceeds  to step 103, wherein  the request  message  for requesting  access  to a communication channel  may  be transmitted  over an  access  channel.  In  step  1 04,  it  is determined  whether  the  network  node  3 has  granted access to the communication channel  in response to the request message, e.g. by determining whether  any  acknowledgement  message  has  been  received   within  a  predetermined   time period, whether any acknowledgement message has not been received  within a predetermined time period, or whether an access condition  has been altered. If the answer in step 104 is yes, the procedure  proceeds  to step 105. In step 105, the transmit  power  level  to be used by the transmitter   unit  11  for  transmitting   a  subsequent   request  message  is  generated.  The  new transmit power level may be generated  e.g. by decreasing  the transmit power level which was used for transmitting  a previous request message. Alternatively, the transmit power level to be used is determined  to be equal to the previously used transmit power level, e.g. if a minimum transmit power level has been reached. If the answer in step 1 04 is no, the procedure  proceeds<br><br>
to step 106. In step 106 it is determined  whether a collision  was detected at the network node<br><br>
3. The determination in step 106 may be based on access  information  derived  from received data from the network  node 3. The determination  may e.g. be determined  based on an access condition,  or a collision  indication.  If the access condition  has been altered, it may indicate a collision.  A collision  indication  may e.g. be a separate message  or a flag of another message, e.g. control  information  in a  beacon  signaL If the answer  in step  106  is no,  the procedure proceeds to step I 07. In step 107, the transmit power level is generated,  e.g. by increasing the transmit  power level to be used by the transmitter  11 when transmitting a subsequent  request message.  From  step  107,  the  procedure  returns  to  step  10I,  wherein  the  communication<br>
apparatus  1 may  be  idle  until  the  subsequent  request  message  may  be  transmitted.   If  the<br><br>
answer in step 106 is yes, the procedure  proceeds to step 108, wherein  a request message for requesting  access  to the communication channel  is transmitted.  In step  109, it is determined whether the network  node 3 has granted access to the communication channel,  e.g. according to the same principles  as was used in step 104. If the answer  in step 109 is no, the procedure returns to step 106. If the answer  in step 109 is yes, and from step 105, the procedure proceeds to  step  110.  In  step  110,  the  communication apparatus  enters  a  communication mode,  in which communication with the network may commence.<br><br><br>
The steps according to the embodiment of the method illustrated  in Fig. 3 need not be carried out in the illustrated  order.  Furthermore, all steps illustrated  need not be carried  out in other embodiments.<br><br><br>
Figs. 4a-4d, and 5 illustrate  an example  for altering an access condition,  which is altering the length of or opening  new access  windows. The example given in Figs. 4a- 4d may be utilized in a Bluetooth  network,  and may apply a fast method for contention resolution  that can cope with a hidden  node as well.  A time  slotted  Bluetooth  channel  with slots of 625  )lS  may be used. Each communication apparatus  1, 2 in the network may be al1ocated an access number. The access nu!llber is unique for each communication apparatus  1, 2 and can be allocated by a master  unit, such as the network  node 3, at first connection setup. The access  numbers  may range from 0 to K-1, where K is the total number of slave devices. The master unit may send a beacon  message  302  (Fig.  4a)  at regular  intervals  T_beacon.  Initially,  two  access  windows (each e.g. 312.5  )lS)  may  be provided  just after the beacon message  is sent in slot 310. The beacon message  302  may  include  an indication  that units with an even  access  number  may<br><br>
respond in a first access window 312 and units with an odd access number may respond in a second access window 314.<br><br><br>
The request message sent by the slave unit may include its access number, e.g. in a header part of the request message. The request message may have the Bluetooth format with a preamble, and an FEC ((Forward Error Correction) coded header containing an address field, which includes the access number, and a header error check (HEC) code to detect errors.<br><br><br>
If the master experiences a signal in the first access window 312 but the reception fails due to errors (which may occur due to collisions) as shown in Figure 4b, the master will directly send a next beacon message 304 in slot 320, as shown in Figure 4b. Apparently, slaves with even access numbers are contending.<br><br><br>
The  access  condition   may  be  altered  by  sending  the  next  beacon  message  within  a predetermined time period. Thus, the next beacon message may comprise access information based on which collision determination may be made in the communication apparatus l, 2. The next beacon message 304 may include a reference to two access windows 322 and 324 (e.g. 312.5 )..LS  each) just after slot 320, in which the next beacon message 304 was sent. However, only the slaves with access numbers 4k (k=O, 1, 2, ...) may respond in window 322, whereas units with access numbers 4k+2 must use window 324. In this way, the units with even access numbers have been split into two groups that contend independently in access windows 322 and 324. If the master experiences a signal in the second access window 314, the message in the next beacon message 304' will indicate that only the units with access numbers 4k+l (k=O, 1, 2, ...) may respond in access window 322' whereas units with access numbers 4k+3 must use window 324' (Fig. 4c) . Thus, the number of units that is contending in the same access window is divided by two. If errors have been detected in both access window 312 and 314, two pairs of new windows may be provided (Fig. 4d) . Beacon message<br>
304" indicates two (even) access windows where slaves having access numbers 4k and 4k+2<br><br>
can contend, respectively; beacon message 306" indicates two (odd) access windows where slaves having access numbers 4k+l and 4k+3 can contend, respectively. This procedure of splitting windows when contention is experienced can be extended even further when further collisions are experienced. For example, if collisions are experienced in access window 322<br><br>
allowing slaves with access numbers 4k to contend, a next beacon may provide two access windows for units with access numbers 8k and 8k+4, respectively.<br><br><br>
The procedure can be generalized by using the tree construction as shown in Fig. 5. Initially, all slaves contend in a single access window. When collisions are experienced, the master will provide two new access windows, one window to be used by slaves having access numbers 2k (even numbers) and the other window to be used by slaves having access numbers 2k+l (odd numbers) . If the access window for the slaves having even access numbers still experience errors, two new access windows are opened, one access window for access numbers 4k, the other access window for access numbers 4k+2. If the access window for the slaves having odd access numbers still experience errors, two new windows are opened, one window for access numbers 4k+l, the other  window for access  numbers 4k+3, and so  on.  In  general, errors detected in a window allowing slaves with access numbers I*K+J (with J=O, 1,2, ... 1-1) will result in two new access windows to be used by slaves having access numbers 2*I*K+J and<br>
2*I*K+J+I, respectively.<br><br><br><br>
New access windows may indicate an altered access condition. Consequently, new access windows  may  be  an  indication  that  a  collision  occurred  at  the  network  node  3  as  a consequence of a request message.<br><br><br>
Errors or collisions may be detected at the master receiver, which may provide additional access windows in response to detecting the errors or collisions. In cable and fibre media, collisions  will  always  result  in errors.  This  may  not  be  the  case  in  a  radio or  wireless environment. If one slave X is much closer to the master, or if it uses considerable more transmit power than the other slaves Yn, it will overshadow the transmissions of other slaves. That is, although there is some interference from slaves Yn, the carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I) at the master receiver is sufficiently large such that the master can decode the message of slave X without errors. As a result, the master will not open more access windows since it is not aware of other slaves trying to get access. Therefore, the closest or strongest slave (the one transmitting signals that is received with the largest RX level) will be favoured over the others. To keep a fair  access  for all the slave devices, collision  is detected. This can be accomplished if collisions result in errors at the receiver. Therefore, the contending signals should approximately all be received at the same power level at the receiver. This may be<br><br>
provided by automatic transmit power control, which in turn may be provided by utilizing the method according to the invention. The transmit power control should be such that the power received at the master should be approximately the same for all slave devices . The transmit power control does not have to be very accurate. For example, in Bluetooth® errors may occur when the interfering power is less than 8 dB below the desired power (C/I=8dB) . So if the  power  control   is  accurate   within  e.g.  5-6  dB,  the  method  works  acceptable  for Bluetooth®.<br><br><br>
Fig. 6 illustrates another embodiment for generating a transmit power level. The embodiment of Fig. 6 is a combination of some of the steps according to the embodiment of Fig. 3 and some additional steps. The procedure is started according to step 100 of Fig. 3 and proceeds to step 400. In step 400, a first beacon message is received. Then, the procedure proceeds to step<br>
102 of Fig. 3. Steps 102-104 are carried out as described in relation to Fig. 3. Ifthe answer in step 102 is no, the procedure returns to step 400. If the answer in step 1 04 is no, the procedure proceeds to step 401, i.e. steps 401-405 may be carried out as a subroutine in step 106. In step<br>
401,   it  is  determined   whether  a  next   beacon  message   has  been  received   within  a<br><br>
predetem1ined time period after having received the first beacon signal. The predetermined time period may depend on split of access windows and may be in the order of a few time slots. For example, if the error occurs in slot 312 or 314 (Figs. 4b-4c) the predetermined time period is at least until beacon message 304 or 304' is received. Similarly, if the error occurs in time slots 312 and 314 as in Fig. 4d, the predetermined time period is at least until beacon message 306' ' is received. If it is determined in step 401 that a next beacon signal was not received within the predetermined time period, the procedure proceeds to step 402. The next beacon signal may be an indication of an altered access condition. In step 402 it is determined that  no  collision  was  detected  as  the  next  beacon  signal  was  not  received,  wherein  the procedure proceeds to step 107 of Fig. 3. Then, the procedure proceeds according to the steps of Fig 3. If the answer in step 401 is yes, the procedure proceeds to step 403. In step 403 it is determined whether the communication apparatus 1 is allowed to transmit an access message. The determination in step 403 may be carried out by determining whether the next beacon message   contained   references   to   two   access   windows   and   an   indication   that   the communication  apparatus  1  is  allowed  to  transmit  in  one  of  the  access  windows.  The indication may be provided by access numbers. The access nun1bers may indicate the access nun1ber of  one  or  several ,communication  apparatuses  that  are  allowed  to  transmit  in  a<br><br>
respective access window. Thus, the access number of the communication apparatus 1 may be compared to received access numbers. If the answer in step 403 is yes, the procedure proceeds to step 404. In step 404, the value of the transmit power level which was used to transmit a previous access  message  is  maintained  to  be  applied  for  transmitting  a  following access message, wherein the procedure proceeds to step 108. If the answer in step 403 is no, the procedure returns to step 401. If the procedure once again ends up in step 106, e.g. if the answer in step 1 09 is no, it will return to step 401.<br><br><br>
In another embodiment, the communication apparatus 1, 2 is adapted for communication in a network suppmting GPRS. When the communication apparatus 1, 2 is adapted for GPRS it applies transmit  power  control (TPC) . According to prior art devices  adapted  for GPRS communication, TPC is not applied during the access request: the access burst is always sent at the maximum transmit power PMAX. This means that terminals close to the base stations have a power advantage and will have higher success of successful AB<br>
(Access Burst) delivery. Also, the power resources are not utilized effectively.  With other words, a communication  apparatus with favourable propagation conditions may get priority over a communication apparatus with less favourable propagation conditions. To achieve fairness in the system and prevent starvation of transmitting units at the cell edge, the transmit power control scheme according to the invention may be used during the access procedure in a communication apparatus adapted for GPRS communication. Thus, the communication apparatus 1, 2 may utilize its power resources more efficiently and the near far problem is solved. Further details can be found in "3GPP TS 03.64 V8.12.0 (2004-04), Release 1999, 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group GSM/EDGE; Radio Access Network; General Packet Radio Service (GPRS);<br>
Overall description of the GPRS radio interface; Stage 2".<br><br><br><br>
In still another embodiment, the communication apparatus I, 2 may be adapted for communication in a WLAN network set up according to an IEEE 802.11 standard, such as IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, or 802. Hg. These versions differ only at the physical layer and are evolutions of the former IEEE 802.11 standard to provide higher data rates. The MAC layer of the IEEE 802.11 standard has been stable for a long time. Recently additions have been developed to improve security (IEEE 802.Hi) and QoS (Quality of Service) (IEEE 802.He).<br><br>
In 802.11, a Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) has been specified, which allows units to access the communication channel in a contention-based fashion. A Carrier-Sense Multiple Access scheme combined with a Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme may be used in order to prevent units to access the channel simultaneously, which would cause collisions and errors. When a communication apparatus wants to have access, it listens for the channel for a minimum of DIFS seconds, where DIFS (DCF Inter Frame Spacing) is a standardized guard time. If during this time, no other transmissions are heard, the communication apparatus starts to use the channeL However, when the channel is sensed to be busy, transmission is deferred. Instead, a backoff counter value is randomly selected between 0 and CW, where CW is the length of the contention window (CW). Initially, CW is set at a minimum value CWmin (i.e.<br>
15). The communication  apparatus then regularly listens to the channel to see if it is free. When it has been free for at least DIFS seconds, it starts to count down the backofi counter, one decrement per slot, where a slot is a standardized time duration (smaller than DIFS). As long as the channel is sensed free, the counter is decremented for every slot. When the counter reaches zero, the communication apparatus 1,2 starts using the channel. When during count down the channel is sensed to be busy again, the decrementing is suspended, the counter value is frozen, and the communication apparatus has to wait for another free time of DIFS seconds before it can continue to count down. Further details can be found in "Mangold S. et al . , "Analysis   of   IEEE   802.   lie   for   QoS   support   in   Wireless   LANs",   IEEE   Wireless Communications, Dec. 2003, pp. 40-50".<br><br><br>
The contention-based scheme described above for IEEE 802.11 is no guarantee for error-free communications. Units may choose the same random backoff value. Their counters may reach zero simultaneously and a collision may occur when both start to transmit. This will likely happen when CW is small and the number of units is large. Therefore, when a collision occurs (which may be detected by the communication apparatus 1, 2 if it does not receive an acknowledgment  via an ARQ protocol, or receives a collision indication from the network node 3), the requesting communication apparatus I, 2 may increase its CW value (e.g. by a factor of 2) and determine a new backoff value. For every new collision, the CW value may be increased until a maximum value is reached, CWmax. After a successful transmission, the CW value is reset to a minimum value CWmin.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
20<br><br>
The increase (doubling) of the contention window CW is based on the occurrence of errors (no ACK received/collision  indication received) . This may happen when two units transmit simultaneously. However, collisions do not always need to result in errors for both units . The success of reception of a packet depends on the Signal-to- Noise ratio experienced at the receiver. If signals from a first communication apparatus 1, 2 are received by the network node 3 at a much higher power level than signals from a second communication apparatus 3, the SNR of the strongest received packet of a signal may be sufficient for error free reception. This is also called the capture effect. In this case, the weakest received transmission will be in error, and only the source of that transmission will increase its contention window CW. If there is no power control (power control is not defined in the 802.11 standard), units with better propagation condition have priority above units with worse propagation conditions.<br><br><br>
If errors or collisions  occur,  a communication  apparatus  1, 2 adapted  for communication according to WLAN IEEE 802.11 may be adapted to utilize the method according to the invention. Thus, the transmit power level may be generated based on whether collisions occur at the network node 3. The communication apparatus 1, 2 may first follow the normal contention-based techniques using the backoff counter. However, if the channel is used and a collision occurs, not only is the CW increased, but the transmit power may be increased. Conversely, when the channel access was successful, not only is the CW reset to CWmin (it could already be at this value), but the transmit power may be decreased as well.<br><br><br>
The invention may also be used in UMTS. The specification 3GPP TS 25.214 V5.10.0 (2004-<br><br>
12) discloses transmit power control. If no grant is acknowledged in response to a request for a communication channel, the communication apparatus will increase its transmit power level according to s id specification. However, as discussed above, it is not always advantageous to increase the transmit power even if grant is not acknowledged, e.g. when a collision occurs. Therefore, said specification could be amended according to the principles of the invention. Also for UMTS the transmit power level to be utilized may be determined based on whether collision occurred at the network node due to a first request message. If the network node detects collision, it may transmit access information indicating that a collision occurred. The access information may e.g. be a collision indication. The collision indication may e.g. be a flag  of  control  information  transmitted  in  a  beacon  signal.  Alternatively,  the  collision indication  may  be  transmitted  in  a  separate  collision  indication  message.  If collision  is<br><br>
detected,  the transmit  power  level to be used for transmitting  a second  request  message  may be equal to the transmit  power  level used to transmit  the first  request message.  Also, if it is detected from access infom1ation that another unit has been acknowledged access to the communication  channel,   it  may  be  determined   that  a  capturing   effect  occurred   and  the network  node• 3, which  did  not  receive  the first  request  message.  Then,  the transmit  power level may be increased  for the second request message.<br><br><br>
The communication apparatus 1, 2 may  be adapted  for communication in various  types  of wireless  networks  employing a random  access  scheme,  and  is  not limited  by the network types given as examples above.<br><br><br>
It is an advantage  of the invention  that power  efficient  transmissions in the communication apparatus  may be provided.  Also, access in the network becomes effective  when the transmit power control is utilized.<br><br><br>
The  invention  may  be  embedded  in a computer  program  product,  which  enables implementation of the method  and functions  described  herein. The invention  may be carried out  when  the  computer   program  product  is  loaded  and  run  in  a system  having  computer capabilities.
