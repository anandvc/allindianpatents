				<td>This invention relates to a process for the synthesis of lithium aluminium nickelate (LIAI0.5 Ni0.5 O2) cathode material useful for the rocking chair lithium ion cells<br>
The invention particularly relates to the preparation of lithium aluminium nickelate (LIA10.5 Ni0.5 O2) a composite, which is very useful for high voltage lithium reversible cells and can be prepared by mixing oxides of aluminium, nickel with lithium hydroxide by heating together all in solid state condition. LIA10.5 Ni0.5 O2 is a reversible cathode material useful for high voltage cells of lithium in no aqueous media.<br>
LIA10.5 Ni0.5 O2 compound is hexagonal material is well known from 1995 as a good battery cathode for reversibility in non-aqueous solutions. LiAh/4 Ni3/4 O2 can be prepared by heating a pressed mixture of LiNO3, AI(OH)3 and 2NiCO3 3Ni(OH)2 in stochiometric proportion at 750°C for 24 hrs in air [S.I. Pyun, J.Power Source, 81 - 82 (1999)442].<br>
In a recent paper LiAlyNh.y O2 was obtain by co-precipitation and freeze drying technique, in which an aqueous solutions of Al (NO3)3, Ni(NO3)2 and LiNO3 were mixed together. Then the obtained precursors were fired for 2 hrs at 700 - 800°C in air or oxygen [ Y.I.Jang, B.Huang, H.Wang, G R Maskaly and H. Tamura, J. Power source, 81 - 82 (1999) 589].<br>
In all the above procedures available in the literature some disadvantages were observed. They are as follows:<br>
Phase impurity<br>
Longer duration of thermal preparation<br>
High temperature of operation<br>
pH control<br>
Several steps of preparation<br>
The main object of this present invention in to formulate a new procedure for the synthesis of LIA10.5 Ni0.5 O2 cathode material for the rocking chair lithium ion cells which obviate the draw backs of the hither to known methods. Further object of this invention in cyclability of the system by introducing aluminium in lithium nickelate compound &amp; their by ensuring better reconsibility &amp; partially replacing nickel also.<br>
Still another object is to use glycerol as binding agent to make an uniform homogenous mixture which permits uniform reaction to occur without any side reaction .<br>
Yet another object to this invention is to prepare lithium aluminium nicklate with oxides of nickel, aluminium &amp; hydroxide of lithium.<br>
According the present invention relates to an improved process for the synthesis of lithium aluminium nickelate (LIA10.5 Ni0.5 O2) cathode material useful for the rocking chair lithium ion cells which comprises of heating hydroxides of lithium with oxides of nickel &amp; aluminium in the molar ratio of 1: 0.5 : 0.5 respectively in the form of paste with glycerol and urea at temperatures initially at 200°C , subsequently kept at 800°C for 12 hours, cooling the resultant to room temperature to get lithium aluminium nickelate cathode material.<br>
In one of the embodiment of this invention the molar ratio of Li: Ni: Al is an 1 :<br>
The temperature of preparation of this compound in between 600°C to 800°C. In yet another embodiment of this invention glycerol is used as a binding agent for uniform product formation. This prevents any side reactions &amp; partial reactions.<br>
A novel method of preparing this compound viz., LiAl0.5 Ni0.5 64 was carried out by uniform mixing of oxides of Al and Ni with LiOH and this mixture was made into a paste by adding necessary quantity of glycerol and the paste was calcined at 750°C continuously for 12 hrs in a furnace. The prepared product was subjected to x-ray analysis. The product was found to be in single phase.<br>
The present invention, describes the method of synthesis of cathode material for a secondary battery, by heating a paste prepared by mixing fine particles of LiOH, Al2O3 and NiO in glycerol. This paste was initially heated slowly in a furnace to evaporate off glycerol in order to get a dried mass at 250°C. This dried mass was then continuously heated to 800°C for 12 hrs. The compound formed was slowly cooled to room temperature and was ground well and then examined for its particles size, colour and XRD exposure. It was found that the prepared sample was black in colour and was homogenous, X-rays analysis confirmed the formation of LiAlo.s Ni0.5 O2 according to Fig. 1. The novelty of this process is use of finding agent glycerol and flux therefore<br>
The process given pure product and leaves behind no unreacted components. The process does not produce partial reactions.<br>
The time takes for normal preparation of the product is much less than other know methods.<br>
Single unit procedures compared to other methods.<br>
The following examples are given by the way of illustration and should not be construed the scope of this invention.<br>

Hydroxide of lithium and oxides of nickel and were ground well to a fine powder in a pestle &amp; motar arrangement. Glycerol was slowly added &amp; then the mixture was ground well to form a paste. The paste was transferred in to a silica porcelain / crucible.<br>
The contract was slowly heated to 200°C initially &amp; finally to 800°C for 12 hours. The product formed after the reaction was looked to ambient temperature &amp; was ground well. The fine power was x-rayed to confirm the identity of the product &amp; purity<br>
The following advantages are claimed in this invention for the preparation of lithium aluminium nickelate.<br>
A uniform homogeneous mixture of the ground compounds viz., oxides of aluminium and nickel with LiOH were made into a paste to get a product of high purity.<br>
Glycerol was used as a solvent for binding the oxides viz., aluminium and nickel with LiOH for making a paste of required consistency. The addition of glycerol enhanced the product of fine particles.<br>
The addition of flux (urea) / excess addition of glycerol (solvent) as a binding material for oxides does not change the colour or quality of the end product.<br><br><br><br><br>
