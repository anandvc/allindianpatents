				<td>A system and method for generating a local oscillator (LO) frequency in a zero intermediate frequency (IF) receiver or transmitter is presented. A signal is received from a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). The signal has a VCO frequency. The VCO frequency is divided by a number N to produce a signal having a divided-down frequency. The signal having the VCO frequency is then mixed with the signal having the divided-down frequency to produce an output signal having an output frequency. Local oscillator leakage is reduced. Thus, the receiver or transmitter may operate in multiple wireless communication bands and modes and meet the associated specifications. Fig. 7</td>

CONVERSION PROCESSES<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[0001]	This invention relates in general to wireless communications. Specifically,<br>
this invention relates to systems and methods for direct conversion transceivers.<br>
Background and Belated Art<br>
[0002]	The field of communications has experienced a tremendous growth due in<br>
large part to the improved capabilities of wireless devices. Wireless devices employ radio<br>
waves to enable distant communications without the physical constraints of wire-bascd<br>
systems, Information, such as voice, data, or paging information, is conveyed by radio<br>
waves transmitted over predetermined frequency bands. Allocation of available frequency<br>
spectra is regulated to ensure that numerous users may communicate without undue<br>
interference.<br>
[0003]	Information to be transmitted from a source to. a destination is seldom<br>
acquired in a format that is ready for radio transmission. Typically, a transmitter takes an<br>
input signal and formats it for transmission in a predetermined frequency band. The input<br>
signal, also referred to as a baseband signal, modulates a earner in the desired frequency<br>
band.  For -Example, a radio transmitter that receives an audio input signal modulates a<br>
carrier frequency with the input signal.<br>
[01)041	A corresponding remote receiver tuned to the same carrier frequency as the<br>
transmitter must receive and demodulate the transmitted signal.   That is, the remote<br>
receiver most recover the baseband signal from the modulated carrier.  The baseband<br>
signal may be directly presented to a user or may be farther processed prior to being<br>
presented to the user Many consumer wireless devices, such as radios, televisions, and<br>
pagers, are solely receivers.<br>
10005]	Transceivers are wireless devices that integrate a transmitter and receiver in<br>
a single package-  Transceivers enable nearly instantaneous two-way communications.<br><br><br>
[0010]	Intemodulation distortion is the result of two or more signals mixing<br>
together to produce additional unwanted distortion within the signal bandwidth. For two<br><br><br>
produce uudesired signals, such as DC signal levels that are proportional to the amplitude modulation (AM) component of the jammer signal. AM jammer signals may be located at any frequency within a receive frequency band.<br><br><br>
receive frequncy band is 869-894 MHz, and the associated transmit frequency band is 824-849 MHz, Similarly, receive and transmit frequency bands are allocated to Japan Cellular, IMT, and Korean PCS.<br><br>
(0020]	Communications standards  set  forth specifications  that wireless<br>
communication devices must meet. For instance, spurious emissions, sensitivity, jamming<br><br>
range and current consumption for elements in receiver 101 after IF filters 70, In addition, phase and amplitude matching between the I and Q channels 106,107 may be achieved<br><br>
more easily because the IF signal is at a lower frequency range. In view of these benefits receiver 10;. is well-suited for multi-mode and multi-band applications, wherein received<br><br><br>
receiver 200, the received RF signal is mixed with a local oscillator (LO) frequency to produce a baseband signal Because it does not incorpoiate an IF signal path, receiver 200 eliminates cost, board area, and power consumption associated with IF componentSt which mclude IF S AWs, LC matching and discrete filters, a pre-amp, AGC, IF mixers, and the IF VCO and PLL. Further, less part-to-part and temperature variation occurs.<br>
[0027A]	WO 00/52840 describes a multi-band transceiver utilizing a direct<br>
conversion receiver. The direct conversion receiver generates a local oscillator signal by filtering a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) signal using a low pass filter, or by doubling the VCO signal in frequency, and passing the result through a low pass<br>
filter.<br><br><br><br>
[0031]	In CDMA, sensitivity is tested with a signal, set to a level such that a certain<br>
frame error rate (FER) is met.  IS-98 specifies that the device under test must meet a<br><br>
[0034]	Therefore, what is needed is a direct conversion transceiver that can<br>
modulate RF signals in multiple bands and multiple modes.<br><br><br>
[0038]	The features, objects, and advantages of the disclosed embodiments will<br>
become mors apparent from the detailed description set forth below when taken in conjunction with the drawings in which like reference characters identify correspondingly throughout, and wherein:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
that outputs a signal whose frequency is a divided down version of an input signal For instance, divider 430 may divide by an integer N, wherein the value of N may be set by a control signa..<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0103]	The foregoing detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings that<br>
illustrate exemplary embodiments of the present inventions. Other embodiments are possible and modifications may be made to the embodiments without  ieparting from the spirit and scope of the invention. For mstance, many of the above devices; may be indirectly coupled to one another such that the devices are separated by intermediate devices, such as filters or amplifiers. Moreover, the teachings of the present invention may be applied to future-developed modulation standards and operating bands. Therefore, the detailed description is not meant to limit the invention.
