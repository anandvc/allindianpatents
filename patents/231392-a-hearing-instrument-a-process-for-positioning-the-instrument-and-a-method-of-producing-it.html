CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present Application is related to and claims benefit of priority from previously filed and co-<br>
pending provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/365,947, filed March 20, 2002 by George<br>
Doudoukjian for A HEARING AID INSTRUMENT AND ASSOCIATED PROCESS FOR<br>
PRODUCTION.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a structure for a hearing instrument and to method for<br>
production of a hearing instrument and, in particular, to a hearing aid that includes a shell molded<br>
by a rapid shell manufacturing process, the shell fitting into an ear and having a faceplate with a<br>
molded opening therein, and a precisely dimensioned interface frame formed as a full, unitary<br>
frame or as a set of rails and having an outer contour adapted to fit into the molded opening and<br>
an inner contour adapted to electronic components for mounting of hearing aid electronic<br>
components.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The majority of present hearing instruments are produced as units fitting entirely within the ear or<br>
within the ear canal. These hearing aids commonly referred to as "in-the ear" or "in-the-canal"<br>
instruments. Such instruments are typically constructed as a "shell" containing a battery and the<br>
electronic components, the shell having a faceplate that typically includes one or more doors or<br>
portals providing access to the battery and electronic components.<br>
The hearing aid shell fits substantially within the ear canal so that in use the faceplate is the only<br>
visible part of the instrument. The shell is custom molded or shaped to the inner contours of the<br>
individual users ear canal to provide a fit that is comfortable and that retains the instrument<br>
securely in the ear. The customization of the shell to each individual user requires the precise<br>
shaping of the shell to the inner contours of the individual user's ear canal, which requires that<br>
each shell be molded or cast with complex contours. In order to reduce costs, the individual shells<br>
are typically produced by a "rapid shell manufacturing" process wherein a powder or a liquid<br>
material is irradiated with a laser beam into a solid form of a desired shape. The laser beam is<br><br>
directed to irradiate selected small volumes of the powder or liquid to eventually cause the<br>
transformation of the entire powder or liquid into the solid in the selected and irradiated volumes<br>
and to thereby also define and form the desired shape.<br>
A recurring problem in this and other processes for molding, casting or otherwise forming hearing<br>
aid shells, however, is that hearing aid components are relatively small, as are the available space<br>
and dimensions within a shell, so that the components must be mounted securely within a shell<br>
within very tight dimensions and tolerances. In addition, the components of the hearing aid, such<br>
as the microphone, amplifier, sound processing circuitry, sound output transducer and battery, are<br>
mounted into the shell through an opening covered by a door. The access door may be separate<br>
from or combined with a battery access opening and battery cover, and which thereby presents<br>
additional problems with respect to the dimensions of the shell. The problem is compounded in<br>
that the component access opening, and perhaps also the battery access opening and their<br>
associated doors or portals, often serve as structural elements or components for positioning and<br>
mounting the components. For example, in some prior art systems some or all of the electronic<br>
components are mounted onto a circuit board, which in turn is mounted into the shell access<br>
opening in various ways, such as by adhesives or screws into a lip formed in a rim of the shell<br>
access opening, or by mating edges of the opening and the circuit board.<br>
For various reasons, such as inherent inaccuracies in the "rapid shell" forming processes and<br>
machines, variations and tolerances in the molding materials, and variations in temperature and<br>
humidity during the molding processes, it is difficult to achieve the necessary dimensional<br>
accuracies with rapid shell manufacturing processes, or with other processes commonly used to<br>
manufacture hearing aid shells. For example, erroneous or poor dimensional control tolerances in<br>
a shell may prevent the secure mounting of components within the shell, or may cause the<br>
components to interfere with one another. The tolerances may thereby prevent secure support or<br>
mounting between the components or between the components and shell or may place undue<br>
strains on electrical or mechanical connecting components. In the instance of a circuit board<br>
mounted onto a lip around the shell access opening, for example, the lip may be too narrow or the<br>
overlap between the edge of the circuit board and the lip insufficient to provide a secure mount,<br>
the actual opening of the shell access opening may be too small or too large, and so on. It will also<br>
be recognized that these problems and other related problems are compounded yet further when<br><br>
the shell access opening is of a complex shape, which will frequently occur when the components<br>
are mounted into the shell access opening as a pre-assembled unit, itself having a complex shape.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An instrument, such as a hearing instrument for positioning in the ear of a user, and a mounting<br>
frame for use within the instrument for mounting an electronic assembly. The instrument has a<br>
housing or shell containing an electronic assembly, a faceplate, and a frame for insertion in the<br>
faceplate for attachment of the electronic assembly. The frame has an outer contour and an inner<br>
contour wherein the outer contour is simpler in detail than the inner contour to adapt the frame to<br>
both the dimensional precision with which the shell may be made and the dimensional precision<br>
required for mounting the electronic assembly.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, therein are shown diagrammatic illustrations of a hearing aid<br>
Instrument 10 of the present invention and of the process of assembly of such a hearing aid<br>
Instrument 10. As shown therein, a hearing aid Instrument 10, and in particular an "in-the-ear" or<br>
"in-the-canal" instrument, includes a Shell 12 fitting into the ear canal and having mounted<br>
therein the electronic and electrical Components 14 of the Instrument 10. As indicated,<br><br>
Components 14 may include, for example, a Battery 16, a Microphone 18 for receiving sound<br>
input, a Transducer 20 for generating sound output, and Electronic Components 22, which may<br>
include, for example, an Amplifier 24 and/or other forms of electronic signal processing<br>
components, such as a Digital Signal Processor 26 or Filter 28. Some or all of Components 14<br>
may also be pre-assembled into one or more Component Units 30 by any of a number of methods<br>
well known in the arts, such as attachment to one another by adhesives, interlocking parts or<br>
mechanisms, or mounting to one or more circuit boards which are then assembled into the<br>
Instrument 10, and so on.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2. the casing of an Instrument 10 will typically be comprised of the Shell 12 and<br>
a Faceplate 32, which is usually the only visible part of the Instrument 10 when the Instrument 10<br>
is in the user's ear. The Faceplate 32 may be manufactured as a separate part from the Shell 12<br>
and attached thereto or, for example in the rapid shell manufacturing process, as an integral part<br>
of the Shell 12.<br>
The Shell 12 or the Faceplate 32 of the Instrument 10 will normally include a Shell Access<br>
Opening 34 through which the Components 14 are inserted into the Shell 12. Shell Access<br>
Opening 34 is typically closed or covered by a Shell Access Cover 36 which may be, for example,<br>
either a plate or a hinged door, and may be mounted into Shell Access Opening 34 by a friction<br>
fit, by resilient clips, by adhesives, pins, screws or stakes or any other suitable means for securing<br>
Shell Access Cover 36.<br>
The Battery 16 is typically accessible through a Battery Access Opening 38, which may be a part<br>
of or separate from Shell Access Opening 34. Battery Access Opening 38 is normally covered by<br>
a Battery Door 40, which may be separate from or a part of Shell Access Cover 36. Battery Door<br>
40 may be hinged to Shell Access Cover 36 or to Faceplate 32 or to another part of Shell 12 and,<br>
in some instances, Shell Access Cover 36 may be hinged to Battery Door 40. Battery Door 40<br>
typically also includes a holder and contacts for the Battery 16, so that the Battery 16 is swung out<br>
of the Shell 12 on the Battery Door 40 when the Battery Door 40 is opened and is thereby more<br>
readily accessible.<br>
As discussed previously, Components 14 are relatively small and the space and dimensions within<br>
a Shell 12 for mounting Components 14 are relatively small, so that the Components 14 or pre-<br>
assembled Components 30 must be mounted within a Shell 12 very precisely and to within<br>
relatively tight dimensions and tolerances. As also described, Components 14 or Component<br><br>
Units 30 are typically mounted into the Shell 14 through a Shell Access Opening 34, which may<br>
also serve as a structural element or support for positioning and mounting the Components 14 or<br>
Component Units 30. For example, and as discussed herein above, a hearing aid of the prior art<br>
may provide a mounting lip or shelf surrounding the Shell Access Opening 34 and some or all of<br>
the Components 14 may be mounted on a circuit board, the edge of which is attached onto the<br>
mounting lip. As described, however, inherent limitations in controlling the dimensions and<br>
tolerances of a Shell 12 and Shell Access Opening 34 in the rapid shell manufacturing process and<br>
in other shell processes, may hinder the manufacture of a shell with a shell access opening of<br>
sufficiently controlled tolerances to allow a secure mount between, for example, the circuit board<br>
and the lip of the Shell Access Opening 34 or the Shell 12 itself. Again, this problem is<br>
compounded yet further when one or more Components 14 are of complex shapes or when a pre-<br>
assembled Component Unit 30 has a complex shape.<br>
According to the present invention, the conflict between rapid and flexible but imprecise shell<br>
manufacturing processes, such as rapid shell manufacturing, and the requirement for precise,<br>
secure mounting of hearing aid components may be resolved by use of an Interface Frame 42 as<br>
illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. As illustrated therein, an Interface Frame 42 is inserted and mounted<br>
into a Shell Access Opening 34 of a Shell 12 and provides a structure by which Components 14 or<br>
Component Units 30 are mounted into a Shell 12.<br>
In a first embodiment of the present invention, illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4, an Interface Frame 42,<br>
which in this embodiment is a generally rectangular, four sided Mounting Framework 44 having<br>
an Inner Contour 46 and an Outer Contour 48. The Inner Contour 46 is formed by the four<br>
Interior Surfaces 50 of Framework Sides 52 and is formed to the relatively tight dimensional<br>
tolerances and to the shapes and contours necessary to provide precise, secure mounting of one or<br>
more Components 14 or one or more Component Units 30, or both. As will be readily recognized,<br>
the Components 14 or Components Units 30 may be secured to a Mounting Framework 44 by any<br>
of a number of methods well known in the arts, such as by a friction fit or a resilient spring fit,<br>
typically wherein the Framework Sides 52 form resilient mounting clips or shapes, or by<br>
adhesives, screws, pins, and so on.<br>
The Outer Contour 48 is formed by the four Exterior Surfaces 54 of Framework Sides 52 and may<br>
generally be of simpler shape or contour than the Inner Contour 46 formed by Interior Surfaces 50<br>
and need not be produced or formed to the same dimensional tolerances as Inner Contour 46. The<br><br>
principle requirements imposed on Outer Contour 48 and Exterior Surfaces 54 are that Outer<br>
Contour 48 and Exterior Surfaces 54 mate with Shell 12 and Shell Access Opening 34 in such a<br>
manner as to provide a secure attachment between Mounting Framework 44 and Shell 12 within<br>
the method selected for manufacture of Shell 12 and of attaching the Mounting Framework 44 to<br>
the Shell 12. For example, the maximum outside dimensions of Outer Contour 48 may be formed<br>
smaller than the minimum interior dimensions of Shell Access Opening 34 and provided with a<br>
lip, rim or tabs having outside dimensions greater than the maximum inside dimensions of Shell<br>
Access Opening 34 so that the lip, rim or tabs always overlap at least some part of Shell 12<br>
around Shell Access Opening 34. The lip, rim or tabs may be attached to Shell 12 by, for<br>
example, adhesives, screws, attachment to a lip formed in the rim of the shell access opening,<br>
mating edges of the opening and the Components 14 or Component Units 30, friction or<br>
interference fits, and so on. It will also be recognized that in certain circumstances a Shell 12 may<br>
be formed onto or around an Interface Frame 42, thereby forming the bond, connection or<br>
attachment of the Interface Frame 42 to the Shell 12 during the fabrication of the Shell 12. For<br>
example, when a Shell 12 is molded , cast or formed by a "rapid shell" process, the Interface<br>
Frame 42 may be placed in the mold, casting form or "rapid shell" molding workspace at the<br>
appropriate location, so that the Interface Frame 42 will thereby be incorporated into the<br>
completed Shell 12 at the desired location.<br>
In summary, Inner Contour 46 formed by Interior Surfaces 50 of Framework Sides 52 are<br>
dimensioned and formed to the shapes and more stringent dimensional tolerances required to<br>
provide secure mechanical mounting for Components 14 or Component Units 30. Outer Contours<br>
48 are formed by Exterior Surfaces 54 and dimensioned and formed to the shapes and tolerances<br>
adequate to provide secure mounting in a Shell Access Opening 34 of a Shell 12. A Mounting<br>
Framework 44 thereby meets the dimensional requirements for secure mounting of the<br>
Components 14 or Component Units 30 and allows for inequities in the manufacturing tolerances<br>
of a Shell 12 manufactured by a rapid shell manufacturing process or by a similar low precision<br>
process. It will also be recognized that a Mounting Framework 44 may be manufactured by any of<br>
a number of methodologies or processes capable of providing relative small structures or forms to<br>
relatively tight dimensional tolerances, at least in those areas, such as Inner Contour 46, where<br>
tighter tolerances are necessary. Examples of such would be by metal or plastic injection molding<br><br>
processes or any metal or plastic forming processes capable of achieving the required shapes and<br>
dimensional tolerances.<br>
An alternate embodiment of an Interface Frame 42 is illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6, wherein<br>
Interface Frame 42 is a multi-part structure wherein the structural parts of the Interface Frame 42<br>
may be directly attached to connected to one another or may be structurally related to form the<br>
Interface Frame 42 by attachment to another component, such as the Shell 12. In the embodiment<br>
illustrated in Fig. 5, the multi-part Interface Frame 42 is comprised of two or more Insert Rails 56<br>
and the Inner Contour 46 of the Interface Frame 42 is primarily defined by the Interior Rail<br>
Surfaces 58 of Insert Rails 56. Again, the Interior Surfaces 58 of Insert Rails 56 and thereby Inner<br>
Contour 46 are formed to the relatively tight dimensional tolerances and to the shapes and<br>
contours necessary to provide precise, secure mounting of one or more Components 14 or one or<br>
more Component Units 30, or both. It will be recognized, in this regard, that those portions of<br>
Inner Contour 46 that are not formed of the Interior Rail Surfaces 58 of Insert Rails 56 will be<br>
defined, for example, by the inner edge or edges of the Shell Access Opening 34, and that this<br>
may result in a difference in the dimensional tolerances of the Inner Contour 46 in these regions.<br>
Again, the Components 14 or Components Units 30 may be secured to Interior Rail Surfaces 58<br>
by any of a number of methods well known in the arts, such as by a friction fit or a resilient spring<br>
fit, typically wherein the Insert Rails 56 are formed so as to form resilient mounting clips or<br>
shapes, adhesives, screws, pins, and so on.<br>
The Outer Contour 48 is similarly defined by Exterior Rail Surfaces 60 of Insert Rails 56 and may<br>
again be of simpler shape or contour and than the Inner Contour 46 formed by Interior Rail<br>
Surfaces 58, and again need not be held to the same dimensional tolerances. The principle<br>
requirements imposed on Outer Contour 48 and Exterior Rail Surfaces 60 are again that Outer<br>
Contour 48 and Exterior Rail Surfaces 60 mate with a Shell 12 and a Shell Access Opening 34 in<br>
such a manner as to provide a secure attachment between the Insert Rails 56 and the Shell 12<br>
within the method selected for manufacture of Shell 12 and of attaching the Insert Rails 56 to the<br>
Shell 12. As previously described, and for example, the maximum outside dimensions of Outer<br>
Contour 48 formed by the Rails 56 may be formed smaller than the minimum interior dimensions<br>
of Shell Access Opening 34 and each Rail 56 may be provided with a lip, rim, tabs or channel<br>
having outside dimensions greater than the maximum inside dimensions of Shell Access Opening<br>
34 so that the lip, rim, tabs or channel always overlap at least some part of Shell 12 around Shell<br><br>
Access Opening 34. The lips, rims, tabs or channels may be attached to Shell 12 by, for example,<br>
adhesives, screws, attachment to a lip formed in the rim of the shell access opening, mating edges<br>
of the opening and the Components 14 or Component Units 30, friction or interference fits, and so<br>
on.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 5, for example, a resilient material may be selected for part or all of Rails 56<br>
and the Interior Rail Surfaces 58 of the Rails 56 may be formed as resilient clips for holding, for<br>
example, a circuit board on which some or all of the Components 14 are mounted. It will be<br>
understood that Rails 56 may be attached to the Shell 12 or Faceplate 32 may a variety of<br>
methods, including for example adhesives, screws, attachment to a lip formed in the rim of the<br>
shell access opening, mating edges of the opening and the Components 14 or Component Units<br>
30, friction or interference fits, and so on.<br>
In this regard, it should be noted that in the embodiment of an Interface Frame 42 as a generally<br>
rectangular, four sided Mounting Framework 44 having four Framework Sides 52, the relative<br>
positions of Framework Sides 52 with respect to one another and with respect to the Shell Access<br>
Opening 34 are fixed by virtue of the Framework Sides 52 being integral parts of a unitary<br>
Mounting Framework 44. In the implementation of an Interface Frame 42 as Insert Rails 56,<br>
however, the Insert Rails 56 are individual elements and, as such, the relative positions of the<br>
Insert Rails 56 with respect to one another and with respect to the Shell Access Opening 34 are<br>
not fixed by the elements themselves. As such, the manufacture of the Instrument 10 must provide<br>
or include a method for fixing the locations of the Insert Rails 56 with respect to one another and<br>
with respect to the Shell 12 and Shell Access Opening 34 when inserting and mounting the Insert<br>
Rails 56 into the Shell Access Opening 34. For example, and as illustrated in Fig. 6, when the<br>
Shell 12 is manufactured separately from the Interface Frame 42, as in a rapid shell manufacturing<br>
method, the Instrument 10 manufacturing process may include a Rail Jig 62 to hold the Insert<br>
Rails 56 in a predetermined position with respect to one another when inserting and mounting the<br>
Insert Rails 56 into a Shell Access Opening 34, and to manipulate the Insert Rails 56 into a<br>
predetermined position with respect to the Shell Access Opening 34. In other Shell 12<br>
manufacturing processes, such as conventional molding processes, the Rail Jig 62 may comprise a<br>
part of a mold used to cast or mold the Shell 12, that is, to hold the Insert Rails 56 in a<br>
predetermined position with respect to one another and in a predetermined position with respect to<br>
the Shell Access Opening 34.<br><br>
Again, therefore, the Interior Rail Surfaces 58 of Insert Rails 56 are dimensioned and formed,<br>
individually and with respect to one another, to the shapes and more stringent dimensional<br>
tolerances required to provide secure mechanical mounting for Components 14 or Component<br>
Units 30. The Exterior Rail Surfaces 62 are in turn dimensioned and formed to the shapes and<br>
tolerances adequate to provide secure mounting in a Shell Access Opening 34 of a Shell 12. An<br>
Interface Frame 42 comprised of Insert Rails 56 thereby meets the dimensional requirements for<br>
secure mounting of the Components 14 or Component Units 30 and the manufacturing tolerances<br>
of a Shell 12 that is manufactured by a rapid shell manufacturing process or similar process. It<br>
will be recognized that Insert Rails 56 may be manufactured by any of a number of methodologies<br>
or processes capable of providing relative small structures or forms to relatively tight dimensional<br>
tolerances. Examples of such would be by metal or plastic injection molding processes, stamping,<br>
or any metal or plastic forming processes capable of achieving the required shapes and<br>
dimensional tolerances.<br>
Lastly, an Interface Frame 42, whether comprised of a Mounting Framework 44 or of Insert Rails<br>
56, may be adapted to mount and support either or both of a Battery Door 40 or a Shell Access<br>
Door 36. As illustrated in Fig. 7 for an exemplary Mounting Framework 44, one or more of the<br>
Framework Sides 52 of the Mounting Framework 44 may be formed as, or have formed therein,<br>
Door Sockets 64 for receiving and retaining Hinge Pivots 66 of, for example, a Battery Door 40.<br>
In the example shown in Fig. 7, the Battery Door 40 comprised moveable a part of the Faceplate<br>
32 and forms a part of the Shell Access Door 36, which in the present example is a non-hinged<br>
panel that may be fixed in place or removable. The Battery Door 40 will typically mount a battery<br>
clip of holder for receiving and holding the Battery 16 and circuit connections to the Battery 16.<br>
The Door Sockets 64 are formed as grooves in one end of each of opposing Framework Sides 52,<br>
and the Hinge Pivots 66 on Battery Door 40 may be formed as separate hinge pins or as a single<br>
pin forming both hinges. Hinge Pivots 66 may also be formed of a wire or metal strip shaped to<br>
provide the door pivots and to provide both a clip for holding the battery and as one of the<br>
connections to the battery connection wire, as illustrated in Fig. 7.<br>
It will be recognized that Door Sockets 64, Hinge Pivots 66 and the details of the design of a<br>
Battery Door 40 or Shell Access Cover 36 will be dependent upon the particular design<br>
requirements and layout of a given Instrument 10 and the choices made by the designer.<br><br>
It will also be recognized that a Rail 56 may be formed as or have formed therein similarly<br>
functioning Door Sockets 64, and so on, and that there are many possible arrangements of<br>
Faceplate 32, Shell Access Cover 36 and Battery Door 40, depending on the choice of the<br>
designer.<br>
Finally, it will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the relevant arts that the present<br>
invention may be implemented or embodied in a variety of other devices and instruments that<br>
through necessity or design combine a shell or mounting having dimensional tolerances that<br>
conflict with the dimensional tolerances required to mate the shell or mounting with other<br>
components. Such devices may include, for example, a wide range of medical or scientific<br>
devices or instruments, such as devices having or requiring individually tailored or fitted shells,<br>
mountings or other components, devices intended for one time use, devices requiring minimum<br>
shell or casing costs, and devices having disposable or destructible housings or shells containing,<br>
for example, reusable, complex or expensive components, and so on. In general, the present<br>
invention may be implemented in any situation in which it is necessary to mate or otherwise<br>
mutually adapt or fit two or more components or parts having different dimensional tolerances or<br>
requirements.<br>
Since certain changes may be made in the above described invention without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention herein involved, it is intended that all of the subject matter of the<br>
above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted merely as<br>
examples illustrating the inventive concept herein and shall not be construed as limiting the<br>
invention.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A hearing instrument for insertion into an ear canal of a user,<br>
comprising :<br>
a shell for enclosing hearing instrument components and<br>
comprising an integrated faceplate, the faceplate facing generally<br>
outwardly from the ear canal and comprising<br>
an opening; and<br>
an interface frame that mates with the integrated faceplate, the<br>
interface frame comprising<br>
an outer contour, the dimensions of the outer contour conforming<br>
to the dimensions of the opening in the faceplate; and<br>
an inner contour of predetermined, fixed dimensions, where the<br>
hearing instrument components are secured to the inner contour.<br>
2.	A hearing instrument as set forth in claim 1, where the<br>
components comprise at least, one component unit.<br><br>
3.	A hearing instrument, as set forth in claim 1, where the interface<br>
frame comprises a plurality of rails.<br>
4.	A hearing instrument as set forth in claim 1, where the interface<br>
frame further comprises a door.<br><br>
A structure for an instrument or device, such as a hearing aid instrument, having<br>
a shell for enclosing the instrument components and an opening through a wall or face<br>
of the shell for access to the components wherein the shell has relatively large<br>
dimensional tolerances while the components are to be mounted within relatively close<br>
dimensional tolerances. A unitary or multi-part interface frame for mounting the<br>
components into the shell is mounted to the shell, typically in the opening therein, and<br>
has an outer contour adapted to the dimensional and shape tolerances of the shell and an<br>
inner contour adapted to the dimensional tolerances of the components.</td>
