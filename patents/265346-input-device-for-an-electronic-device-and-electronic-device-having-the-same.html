Field of the Invention<br>
[001] The present invention is generally directed to an input device for an<br>
electronic device, and the electronic device having the same. More particularly,<br>
the input device includes both a roller member and at least one button adjacent the<br>
roller member and an electronic device including the same.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
[002] Many electrical devices include an input device that is configured to<br>
control some aspect or function of the electrical device. These electrical devices<br>
may be mobile terminals, which in turn can take the form of cellular phones,<br>
PDAs (Personal Digital Assistant), and the like, which a user can carry with<br>
himself/herself to send/receive various kinds of information, such as images,<br>
voices, and text massages via wireless communication or to receive various<br>
services via connection to a predetermined server.<br>
[003] Because a mobile terminal performs a wireless communication function in<br>
addition to various other functions in correspondence with a user's demand, such<br>
as play music, videos, and take pictures, the mobile terminal often includes an<br>
input device that is configured to control one or more functions of the mobile<br>
terminal and may allow for various forms of input.<br>
[004] For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,333,473 to Sawada et al discloses an input<br>
device mat is both rotatable and pressable to provide signals. In particular, the<br>
input device can provide five different signals (two signal based on rotation and<br>
three signals based on a downward displacement). As described in the patent, the<br>
input device includes a frame member 24 and two pressable switches 22A and<br>
22B. The three signals generated by a downward displacement are generated by<br>
pressing switch 22A individually, pressing switch 22B individually, and pressing<br>
switches 22A and 22B simultaneously. The two rotation signals are based on the<br><br>
rotation direction of a knob 25. As described in the patent, when either switch is<br>
pressed independently, most of the pressing force is applied to that switch,<br>
however, because of the frame configuration 24, some force is applied to the<br>
opposite switch.<br>
[005] As such, that the switches are repeatedly exposed to more force than is<br>
necessary. In addition, because it is difficult to press both switches 22A and 22B<br>
simultaneously, a separate timing function has to be provided to determine<br>
whether a user desired to generate the third signal by pressing both switches 22A<br>
and 22B. As a result, additional power is consumed while waiting to detect the<br>
pressing of both switches 22A and 22B.<br>
[006] To address this problem, an input device, as shown in FIG. 1, can be<br>
provided that generates two rotation signals and a single pressing signal. A<br>
rotation member 200 is provided on a body 300. Press switches 400 are provided<br>
to either side of the rotation member 200, however due to the size of a user's<br>
fingers, the press switches have to provide a minimum spacing 210 to ensure that<br>
they are not pressed when the rotation member 200 is utilized.<br>
[007] Because electronic devices, and mobile terminals in particular, are<br>
becoming slimmer, spacing of components is very important. As a result, the input<br>
device shown in FIG. 1 leaves wasted space.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

device is provided that includes a base, a frame pivotally connected to the base, a<br>
roller member rotatably supported by the frame, and at least one button pivotally<br>
connected at a side of the base.<br><br>
[009] In another aspect, the at least one button includes a pair of buttons and each<br>
button is located on the base near opposite ends of the roller member.<br>
[0010] In a different aspect, the roller member includes a cylindrical body and a<br>

the ring magnet may have a plurality of alternating North and South poles.<br>
[0012] In still a further aspect, the input device may include a click magnet located<br>
between the ring magnet and the frame. The click magnet is configured to provide<br>
slight resistance to the rotation of the roller member.<br>
[0013] In another aspect, the input device may include an elastic pad located<br>
between the circuitry supporting substrate and the frame.<br>
[0014] Also in accordance with principles of the invention, an electronic device is<br>

display module.<br>
[0016] In another aspect, the second body may include a recessed portion<br>
configured to cover the input device in a closed position without transmitting a<br>
force to the input device.<br>
[0017] Further scope of applicability of the present application will become more<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0025] Reference will now be made in detail to an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention, which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Hereinafter,<br>
an input device and electronic device incorporating the input device according to<br>
the present invention will be explained in more detail. In addition, while the<br>
present invention is explained by reference to a folding type mobile terminal, it is<br>
equally suitable for other mobile terminals including bar type, swivel type, and<br>
slide type mobile terminals as well other electronic devices.<br>
[0026] As seen in FIGS. 2-4, an input device 100 includes a body portion 110<br>
configured to pivotally and rotatably support a roller member 120 and to pivotally<br>
support a pair of buttons 130. Preferably an upper surface 133 of each button 130<br>
is shaped to have the same radius of curvature as the roller member to provide a<br>
smooth and continuous appearance. It is understood that only a single button may<br>
be provided. A signal detection member 140 is located beneath the body 110 and<br>
is configured to detect rotational movement and/or a pressing force via a rotation<br>
sensor module 150 and a plurality of switches 143, respectively, as will be<br>
described in detail below.<br><br>
[0027] The body portion 110 includes a base 113 and a frame 111 pivotally<br>
attached to the base 113 such that the frame 111 supports the roller member 120<br>
and allows the roller member 120 to be pressed downward with respect to the base<br>
113. In particular, the roller member 120 includes a cylindrical body 121 and shaft<br>
portions 123 that are supported in the frame 111 by support members Ilia. It is<br>
understood that the shaft portions 123 could be a single shaft with the cylindrical<br>
body 121 attached to the shaft or each shaft portion could be attached at the ends<br>
of or formed integral with the cylindrical body 121. The frame 111 also includes a<br>
lower surface 111b that is shaped to allow the roller member to rotate in the frame<br>
111. A pair of cutout portions 111c is formed in the lower surface 111b to avoid<br>
interfering with the rotational sensor module 150.<br>
[0028] The base 113 defines an open region 113a that allows the roller member<br>
120 to partially extend through the base 113 while being supported by the frame<br>
111. Arched portions 113b are formed on opposite sides of the base and serve to<br>
secure the shaft 123 of the roller member between the base 113 and the frame 111<br>
and defines the location of the rotational axis I-I for the input device 100. A base<br>
mounting portion 113d is provided on one edge of the frame 113 so that the frame<br>
113 can be mounted to the signal detection member 140. More particularly, the<br>
frame 113 is attached to a circuitry supporting substrate 141 of the signal detection<br>
member 140. Finally, button supports 113c are formed on the base 113 to connect<br>
the buttons 130 to the base via connection holes 131 formed in the buttons 130.<br>
[0029] The input device 100 generates a signal when the roller member 120 is<br>
rotated or pressed downwards towards the signal detection member 140.<br>
Specifically, the rotation sensor module 150 detects the forward and reverse<br>
rotation of the roller member 120 within the frame 113 and converts that rotation<br>
to a signal. One of the switches 143 is arranged beneath the roller member 120<br>
such that a downward displacement of the roller member 120 causes the frame 111<br>
to contact the switch 143. The depressed switch then transmits a signal.<br><br>
[0030] The input device 100 also generates a signal when one of the switches 143<br>
located underneath a corresponding button 130 is depressed. As mentioned above,<br>
each of the buttons 130 is pivotally connected to the base 113 via a pair of button<br>
supports 113c. The button supports 113c corresponding to each button 130 define<br>
a pivot axis II-II about which the corresponding button 130, 133 pivots.<br>
[0031] An elastic pad 145 is located between the frame 111 of the body 110 and<br>
the signal detection member 140. The elastic pad may be formed of rubber,<br>
silicone, or other elastic material and assists in protecting the signal detection<br>
member 140. As shown in FIG. 2, the elastic pad includes a plurality of raised<br>
surfaces that correspond to the switches 143 and other elements formed on the<br>
circuitry supporting substrate 141.<br>
[0032] The circuitry supporting substrate 141 is preferably a thin member. Each of<br>
the plurality of switches 143 is preferable a dome switch.<br>
[0033] As shown in FIG. 2, the rotation sensor module 150 includes a ring magnet<br>
151 and a sensor 153, such as a Hall IC that is configured to detect rotation of the<br>
ring magnet 151. In particular, a ring magnet 151 is located on each of the shaft<br>
portions 123. As shown in FIG. 3B, the ring magnet includes a plurality of<br>
alternating North and South poles. The Hall IC can detect the rotation of the roller<br>
member 120 via the rotation of the ring magnet and can output a signal based on<br>
that rotation.<br>
[0034] The rotation sensor module 150 can also include a click magnet 155 that<br>
provides a clicking .feeling to the user. As shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, the click<br>
magnet 155 is supported by the frame 111 and is disposed underneath the ring<br>
magnet 151. In the particular embodiment shown, the click magnet has a North<br>
pole arranged above the South pole and facing the ring magnet such that the<br>
rotation of the roller member alternates the poles of the ring magnet near the click<br><br>
magnet 155. This causes the feeling of clicking for the user as the roller member<br>
120 prefers to be in a state where the poles of the ring magnet 151 complement the<br>
poles of the click magnet. As a result, if the roller member is stopped at position<br>
where a North pole on the ring magnet is facing a North pole on the click magnet,<br>
the roller member is urged to move forward or backward until the poles of the ring<br>
magnet 151 complement the poles of the click magnet 155.<br>
[0035] In addition to providing a clicking feeling, the click magnet helps retard the<br>
rotation of roller member by providing a slight resistance to the rotation of the<br>
roller member 120. In other words, the roller member 120 is not free to continue<br>
rotating after a rotational force is applied.<br>
[0036] The assembled input device 100 is shown in FIG. 4. As noted above, the<br>
cylindrical member 121 extends through the base 113, which is attached to the<br>
circuitry supporting substrate 141 via the base mounting portion 113d and is<br>
rotatable about rotation axis I-I. Buttons 130 cover the ends of the base and are<br>
pivotable about the pivot axis II-II defined by the button supports 113c. Both the<br>
, circuitry printable substrate 141 and elastic pad 145 are partially visible. It is<br>
evident, that the input device 100 can readily receive rotational force applied to the<br>
cylindrical body 121 and that the cylindrical body can rotate within the base 113.<br>
In this.manner, a compact input device can be provided where the amount of<br>
wasted space between components is minimized.<br>
[0037] A pressing or rotational force can be applied to the cylindrical body 121<br>
and to the buttons 130 such that the cylindrical body 121 and buttons 130 engage<br>
the signal detection member 140. Each of the signals generated by the switches<br>
143 and the rotation detection module 150 can be used to cause different effects in<br>
conjunction with a mobile terminal. For example, the rotational motion of the<br>
roller member 120 can be used as a scroll function to scroll up and down, while<br>
the pressing motion on the buttons can be used to scroll left and right. There are<br><br>
many different functions that can be associated with the operation of the input<br>
device 100.<br>
[0038] A folding type mobile terminal having a first body 160 and a second body<br>
170 pivotally attached to the first body 160 is shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. With<br>
particular reference to FIG. 5, an input device similar to the one describe above is<br>
incorporated into the first body 160.<br>
[0039] The first body 160 includes an upper portion 161 and a lower portion 162.<br>
The upper portion 161 includes a keypad 163 and an opening 161a through which<br>
roller member 120 and buttons 130 can extend. The circuitry supporting substrate<br>
141 has been replaced with a circuitry supporting substrate 141' and additional<br>
switches 143' that correspond to keypad 163. The circuitry supporting substrate<br>
141' provides for control of the various components of the mobile terminal as well<br>
as providing for the functionality of the input device as described above for<br>
circuitry supporting substrate 141. The input device includes the base mounting<br>
portion 113d and is attached to the circuitry supporting substrate 141' via a<br>
mounting hole 141 'a. The elastic pad 145 is located on the circuitry supporting<br>
. substrate 141'.<br>
[0040] As shown in FIG. 6, the roller member 120 and buttons 130 are exposed<br>
through the opening 161a in the first body when the second body 170 is in the<br>
open position. The first body 161 also allows information to be inputted by the<br>
keypad 163. A microphone 164 is also provided in the first portion 161. The upper<br>
portion 161 also includes extended portions 167 that cooperate with the second<br>
body 170 to provide the pivotability of the second body 170.<br>
[0041] The lower portion 162 of the may also contain a battery compartment 165<br>
for energizing the mobile terminal.<br><br>
[0042] The second body 170 includes a display module 171 and a speaker 173. A<br>
recessed portion 175 is also formed in me second body 170 and it is arranged to<br>
cover the roller member 120 and buttons 130 without applying a pressing force<br>
diereto. The display module 171 cooperates widi the circuitry supporting substrate<br>
141' to allow a user to control the display via the roller member 120 and buttons<br>
130, as well as the keypad 163. As shown in FIG. 6, menu selection can be<br>
performed by moving left and right using buttons 130 to select an item 1 to 5 and<br>
scrolling up and down using the roller member 120 within the selected item 2. In<br>
addition, the roller member can be used as an enter key by pressing the roller<br>
member 120 downwards to select sub-item b. As noted above, there are many<br>
different functions that can be assigned to the roller member 120 and buttons 130,<br>
and the above examples are not intended to be exhaustive.<br>
[0043] Accordingly the present invention provides the following effects and<br>
advantages.<br>
[0044] First, because me roller member is located on a pivotable frame, which in<br>
turn is mounted to the base, and the buttons are mounted on the base a more<br>
compact input device can be provided.<br>
[0045] Second, because of the versatility of the input device, it can be utilized to<br>
operate many different components of a mobile terminal, such as a camera, video<br>
player, or otiier additional components without having separate buttons set up for<br>
each function of the various components.<br>
[0046] The invention thus being described, it will be obvious that die same may be<br>
varied in many ways.. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from<br>
the spirit and scope of die invention, and all such modifications as would be<br>
obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included widiin the scope of the<br>
