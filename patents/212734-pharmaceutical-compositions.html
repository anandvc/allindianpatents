PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutics! compositions of (1S, 4R)-cis-4-[2-amino-6-cyclopropylamino}-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyciopentene-1-methanol.<br>
(1Sf4R)-cis-4-[2-amino-6-cyclopropviamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-<br>
methanol and its antiviral use, particularly against HIV infections is described in European Patent Specification Number 0434450. The succinate salt of (1S,4R)-cis-4-[2-atnino-6-cyclopropy!amino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyciopentene-1-methanoi is described in W096/06844. The hemisulfate salt of (1S, 4R)-cis-4-[2-ammo-6-cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyciopentene-1-methanol is described in WO98/52949.<br>
(1S,4R}-cis-4-[2-amino-6-cyclopropyiamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanoi (also known as 1592U89) is currently under clinical investigation as an anti-H1V pharmaceutical agent There exists a need for the compound to be prepared in solution form, for example for pediatric use.<br>
Solutions of (1S,4R)-cis-4-[2-amino-6-cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanoi are bitter-tasting and therefore require the addition of sweeteners and taste-rnaskers. However, formulation of (1S, 4R)-cis-4-[2-ammo-6-cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol in solution is difficult because materials containing a -C00H group present problems with (1S, 4R)-cis-4-[2-amino-6-cyciopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yi3-2-cyciopentene-1-methanoi compatibility. For example, glucose forms an adductwith the compound by replacing the methanol group on the cyclopentyl ring of (1S, 4R}-cis-4-[2-amino-6-cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyciopentene-1 -methanol. (1S, 4R)-cis-4-(2-amino-6-cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol has been found to be incompatible with sucrose (which degrades to glucose and fructose) as well as glucose.<br>
Solutions of (1S, 4R)-Cis-4-[2-amino-6-cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol containing sorbitol result in a color change and the formation of dark colored particulates at pH 4.5 - 6.5,<br>
 2<br>
In addition, propylene glycol concentration appears to have an influence on color formation, with higher levels of propylene glycol (10%) causing color formation.<br>
We have found that sorbitol or saccharin or a combination of sorbitol and saccharin are compatible with (1S, 4R)-cis-4-[2-amino-6-cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-eyclopentene-1-methanol and do not lead to the formation of adducts with it. In addition, lowering the pH to about 4.0 eliminates the color change and the formation of particulates. We have also found that combinations of fructose, acesulfame and saccharin are compatible with (1S, 4R)-cis-4-[2-amino-6-cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol. In addition, we have found that abacavir is stable in pH ranges of about 2.0 to about 4.5 and about 6.6 to 7.5.   Advantageously, the pH may be 3.8 to 4.5. We have also found that the addition of a metal chelator, for example citrate, improves the stability of abacavir in solution.<br>

According to another aspect, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of an HIV infection in an infected animal, for example, a mammal including a human, which comprises treating said animal with a composition according to the invention.<br>
Reference herein to treatment extends to prophylaxis as well as the treatment of established infections, symptoms, and associated clinical conditions such as AIDS related complex (ARC), Kaposi's sarcoma, and AIDS dementia.<br>
The present invention also provides the use of a composition, as hereinbefore described, in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of HIV infections and associated clinical conditions hereinbefore described.<br>
In general a suitable dose of 1592U89 for administration to a human for treatment of an HIV injection may be in the range of 0.1 to 120 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, preferably in the range of 3 to 90 mg per kilogram body weight per day and most preferably in the range 5 to 60 mg per kilogram body weight per day.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated all weights of active ingredients are calculated in terms of the drug per se. In the case of a physiologically functional derivative of 1592U89 or a solvate of any thereof the figures would be increased proportionately. The desired dose may preferably be presented as one, two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day. These sub-doses may be administered in unit dosage forms, for example, containing from 1 to 1500 mg, preferably from 5 to 1000 mg, most preferably from 10 to 700 mg of active ingredient<br>
 7<br>
per unit dosage form. Alternatively, if the condition of the recipient so requires, the dose may be administered as a continuous infusion.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may contain one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients and optionally other therapeutic agents. The carrier(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formula and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
The present invention may conveniently be presented as a pharmaceutical composition in a unit dosage form. A convenient unit dosage composition contains the active ingredients in amounts of from 50 mg to 3 g each, for example, 100 mg to 2 g.<br>
The concentration of 1592U89 hemisulfate salt may be 1 - 90 mg/ml at a pH range of about 2.0 to about 4.5.<br>
The unit dosage form may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods represent a further feature of the present invention and include the step of bringing into association the active ingredients with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredients with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product.<br>
Preferred unit dosage compositions are those containing a daily dose or daily subdose of the active ingredients, as hereinbefore recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions are often prescribed to the patient in "patient packs" containing the whole course of treatment in a single package, usually a blister pack or a foil pouch. Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescriptions, where a pharmacist divides a patient's supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally missing in traditional prescriptions. The inclusion of a package insert has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physicians instructions and, therefore, lead generally to more successful treatment.<br>
 8<br>
It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the compositions of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art, for example, those suitable for oral administration may include such further agents as sweeteners, thickeners and flavoring agents.<br>
1592U89 may be prepared by the method described in European Patent Specification Number 0434450 or PCT Application No. 6B95/00225 which are incorporated herein by reference hereto.<br>
The succinate salt of 1592U89 may be prepared by the method described in PCT Application No. GB95/02014, which is incorporated herein by reference hereto.<br>
The following examples are intended for illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of (1S, 4R)-cis-4-[2-Amino-6-cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-<br>
eyclopentene-1-methanol hemisulfate salt<br>
A stirred mixture of water (25 ml) and isopropanol (IPA) (100 ml) was heated to 45 to 55°C and (1S, 4R)-cis-4-[2-amino-6-cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyciopentene-1-methanoi succinate salt (WO 96/06844) (50 g)) was added, and washed in with IPA (12.5 ml). The mixture was heated under reflux for about 0.5 h to give a clear solution and then cooled to 65 to 75°C and a solution of concentrated sulfuric acid (6.07 g) in water (12.5 ml) was added. A mixture of IPA (37.5 ml) and water (12.5 ml) was added and the solution was cooled to 45 to 55°C, whereupon a seed of authentic (IS, 4R)-cis-4-[2-amino-6-cyclopropyiamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol hemisulfate salt was added. After stirring in this temperature range for about 1h to allow crystallisation to become established, further IPA (300 mL) was added, maintaining the temperature of the mixture in the range 45 to 55°C. The suspension was cooled to 0 to 5°C over about 2h, and the product was filtered, washed with IPA (2 x 75 ml), and dried in vacuo at 40 to 45°C to give the title compound as a fawn colored powder (34.3 g, 90%); m.p. 224- 225°C (decomp.); 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6)d: 10.76(br m, 1, purine NH), 8.53(vbr m, 1, NH), 7.80(s.1,purine CH), 6.67{br m, 1, NH2), 6.13(m,1, = CH), 5.87(m,1, CH), 5.40(m,1,NCH), 3.45(d, J = 5.8HZ.2, 0CH2), 2.96(br, m, 1 CH of cyclopropyl), 2.87(m,<br>

1.	Use of Sorbitol Solution<br>
40% of the Propylene Glycol USP was added to an appropriately-sized auxiliary vessel. Methylparaben NF and Propyiparaben NF was added to the Propylene Glycol USP with mixing, and mixed until dissolved. Purified Water USP was dispensed into a stainless steel manufacturing tank equipped with a suitable mixer to approximately 40% of final batch volume. The appropriate volume of Sorbitol Solution USP was dispensed into the manufacturing tank. While mixing, the 1592U89 Hemisulfate was added and mixed until dissolved. While continuing to mix, the paraben/glycol solution, the remaining Propylene Glycol USP, artificial strawberry flavor, artificial banana flavor, Saccharin Sodium NF, Citric Acid Anhydrous USP, and Sodium Citrate Dihydrate USP were added and mixed until dissolved. The mixer was turned off and the solution brought to a volume of 500 L and mixed until a homogeneous solution was achieved. The solution was sampled and the pH measured. The pH was adjusted to 3.8 -4.5 with NaOHor HCI solution. The final solution was filtered through a clarifying filter into an appropriately-sized receiving vessel. Clean, compressed, filtered air was blown into bottles and the bottles were filled with 1592U89 hemisulfate oral solution, capped, and torqued. Alternatively, Water for Injection USP may be used in place of Purified Water USP throughout the manufacturing procedure.<br>
2.	Use of Sorbitol NF<br>
Alternatively, Sorbitol NF may be used in place of Sorbitol Solution USP.  Purified Water USP was added to a volume of approximately 70% of the batch in a stainless steel manufacturing tank equipped with a suitable mixer. While mixing, the Sorbitol NF was<br>
