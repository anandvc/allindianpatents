				<td>This invention relates to a wave powered buoyancy engine to generate energy.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
It is known to convert wave energy to power by placing the turbine in the path of the waves. But difficulties have been experienced for running the turbines smoothly, particularly when the waves move from sea to shore and thereafter recedes. Accordingly, complicated devices have been proposed to overcome the problems to run the turbines smoothly.<br>
It is the object of this invention to develop a simple device based on the well known principle that floating objects displace volume of water whose weight is greater than the weight of the object in air. A floating object thus experiences an upward force called the force of buoyancy. This force of buoyancy is equal to the difference between the weight of the water displaced by the floating object and the weight of the object in air.<br>
It is the object of the invention to use the force of buoyancy experienced by a float, in conjunction with the periodic wise and fall of sea waves to produce energy.<br>
This simple device developed on the above principle is called a wave powered buoyancy engine comprising:<br>
at least two vertical rails fixed on the sea bed,<br>
a float which can move up and down between the said rails in response to the crest and trough of the sea waves.<br>
the said float having a vertical shaft on its top,<br>
the said shaft being connected to means which uses the vertical motion of the shaft to pressurize a fluid which in turn generates power.<br>
The said two rails are fixed on the sea bed close to the place where sea waves starts,<br>
A shield is provided on the said rails at a height facing the incoming waves when the rails are fixed near the sea shore,<br>
The means to use the vertical motion of the shaft to pressurize a fluid is a reciprocating pump or any other known device.<br>
The said means is further connected to a turbine for generating electricity,<br>
The float's weight can be varied with the force of buoyancy produced at the motion of waves, the more the weight of the float, the more the generation of power.<br>
The reciprocating pump is connected to a chamber containing sea water for causing the low pressure in the said chamber for evaporating the sea water to vapour, and also condensing the vapours through a condenser being provided in the said chamber for converting the saline sea water into desalinated water.<br>
This application of the buoyancy engine is based on the principle of spontaneous evaporation at low pressure and the cooling caused thereof.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows a wave powered buoyancy engine according to this invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows the application of the wave powered buoyancy engine used for converting sea water to desalinated water.<br>
Referring to the drawings, item (1) shows the float, which can move up and down between the rails (2) in response to the crest and trough of the sea waves. The said float (1) has a vertical shaft (3) on its top. The said shaft (3) is connected to means such as a reciprocating pump (4) for using vertical motion of the shaft to pressurize a fluid for running a turbine (not shown) for generating electricity. The said reciprocating pump (4) is further connected to a turbine (not shown) for generating electricity.<br>
WORKING<br>
The float rests on the surface of the water, it experiences a force of buoyancy equal to the difference in the weight of the water the float displaces and the weight of the float in air. As a wave occurs and the float experiences a crest of the wave it moves upwards on the guide rails (2) the shaft (3) transfers the buoyancy force of the upward moving float to a reciprocating pump (4) for using this force to pressurize a fluid.<br>
As the wave passes and the crest is replaced by a trough the float (1) moves downwards on guide rails (2) under the force of the weight of the float, the force of the downward motion of the float is transferred by the shaft (3) to the reciprocating pump that can pressurize a fluid. The reciprocating pump is a double piston pump (7) &amp; (8) having piston (5) and (6).<br>
The piston move with the motion of the float and thereby pressurize a fluid which can be used to turn a turbine (not shown) for generating electricity.<br>
The reciprocating pump can create a vacuum viz low pressure in a chamber containing sea water (CI) and thereby evaporate the sea water to vapour and also pump the said vapours through a condensor (C2) provided in the said chamber for condensing the said vapours and thereby converting the saline water to desalinated water or fresh water.<br><br><br><br><br>
I claim:<br>
A wave powered buoyancy engine comprising:<br>
at least two vertical rails fixed on the sea bed,<br>
a float which can move up and down between the said rails in response to the crest and trough of the sea waves.<br>

the said shaft being connected to means which uses the vertical motion of the shaft to pressurize a fluid which in turn generates power.<br>

A wave powered buoyancy engine as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said rails are provided with shild at a height facing the incoming waves when the rails are fixed near the sea shore,<br>
4.	A wave powered buoyancy engine as claimed in claim 1 wherein, the means to use the vertical motion of the shaft to pressurize a fluid is a reciprocating pump or any other known device.<br>
5.	A wave powered buoyancy engine as claimed in claim 4 wherein, the said means is further connected to a turbine for generating electricity,<br>
6.	A wave powered buoyancy engine as claimed in claim 1 wherein the float's<br>
weight can be varied with the force of buoyancy produced at the motion of waves.<br>
A wave powered buoyancy engine as claimed in claim 4 wherein, the reciprocating pump is connected to a chamber containing sea water for causing the low pressure in the said chamber for evaporating the sea water to vapour, and also condensing the vapours through a condenser being.<br>

8.       A wave powered buoyancy engine substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br></td>
