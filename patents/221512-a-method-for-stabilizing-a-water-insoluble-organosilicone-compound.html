				<td>STABILIZED HAIR CARE PRODUCTS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to an improved method of stabilizing hair care products comprising water insoluble organosilicone compounds such as dimethicone by using an energy saving process which does not require high temperatures. Background of the Invention<br>
One of the most prominent ingredients in a conditioning hair care products such as a conditioning shampoo (also called a "2 in 1" shampoo product) is a silicone and/or its derivatives. While it is desirable to add high molecular weight silicone derivatives to shampoos to achieve conditioning effects, it can be difficult to formulate surfactant insoluble silicone-containing shampoos that are stable and do not have the problem of separating out the silicone component. Various attempts at incorporating these silicone conditioning agents into such conditioning shampoos have included dispersing, suspending or emulsifying such agents; these approaches result in the opacification of the products and sometimes results in unstable products due to the separating out of the silicone. Higher levels of a silicone material such as dimethicone are useful in providing increased amounts of conditioning to the hair. However, higher levels of dimethicones are very difficult to physically stabilize in detergent systems.<br>
There have been various attempts at solving the separation problem. For example, one method of stabilizing dimethicones uses alcohols having 20-40 carbons, such as are commercially available. Such compositions are found in U.S. Patent 5,213,716 to Patel et al, U.S. Patent 4,997,641 to Hartnett et al, and assigned to the same assignee as this application. Another method is found in U.S. Patent 4,741,855 to Grote et al, which teaches the use of long chain (C16-C22) acyl derivatives such as ethylene glycol distearate or long chain (C16-C22) amine oxides, as suspending agents. U.S. Patent Number 5,152,914 to Forster et al teaches the use of suspending agents chosen from polyethylene glycol mono- or diesters of (C16-C22) fatty<br>
acids having from 2 - 7 ethylene oxide groups. U. S. Patent Number 4,704,272 to Oh et al. Teaches the use of xanthan gum and long chain acyl derivatives as suspending agents for insoluble, non-volatile silicone.<br>
There have also been approaches to silicone chemistry in personal care and shampoo products which have used different chemistries in order to obtain better products.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 5,543,074 to Hague et al describes personal washing compositions comprising silicone oil and a suspending agent selected from polyacrylic acid, copolymers of acrylic acid with hydrophobic monomers, and copolymers of acrylic acid and acrylate esters.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 5,073,296 to Kopolow et al teaches a method of stabilizing an oil-in-water emulsion using a water-soluble vinyl compound and a free-radical polymerization initiator. The oil may be a cosmetically active material such as silicone oil. A comonomer such as a methacrylate or a neutralized acrylic acid may be added to the vinyl compound.<br>
Further references for hair care compositions with insoluble silicones include U.S. Patent Number 4,997,641 to Hartnett et al and U.S. Patent Number 5,415,857 to Robbins et al, both assigned to the same assignee as this application.<br>
Other references which relate to personal care and which may comprise silicone oils which are stabilized by the addition of vinyl monomers and acryl comonomers which are polymerized in-situ include U.S. Patent Number 5,084,208 to Negrin et al; U.S. Patent 5,169,622 to Kopolow et al; U.S. Patent Number 5,169,623 to Kopolow et al; U.S. Patent Number 5,474,712 to Dotolo et al (conditioning shampoo which consists of, inter alia, a polyalkyleneoxide-modified polydimethyl siloxane and polyacrylic acid and acrylic copolymer emulsifier); U.S. Patent 5,037,648 to Joiner (skin conditioning preparation with , inter alia, polyacrylic acid and dimethicone); and U.S. Patent Number 5,234,682 to Machio et al<br>
(includes a cosmetic composition consisting essentially of, inter alia, dimethicone and acrylates topolymer).<br>
Other hair care references include U.S. Patent 5,051,250 to Patel et al and U.S. Patent Number 5,346,642 to Patel et al, both assigned to the same assignee as this application.<br>
Some of these methods require the use of heat to get the silicone and the C20 - C40 into solution and thus increase the batch time.<br>
There still remains a need to have a 2-in-1 shampoo composition which successfully incorporates a water insoluble non-volatile silicone into a composition which has good stability.<br>
It is a further object to obtain a hair care composition which successfully incorporates a water insoluble silicone into a composition for hair which and which can be manufactured by a low energy process.<br>
Thus, it is an object of this invention to provide an improved method of stabilizing a water insoluble silicone material such as dimethicone and a composition made by such method which is suitable for hair care use. It is a further object of this invention to provide a method for stabilizing a silicone material such as dimethicone which does not require high temperatures. It is yet another object of the invention to provide a method for stabilizing a silicone material such as dimethicone which reduces batch time. These and other objects of the invention will be apparent from the following description. Summary of the Invention<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
While general ranges of each of the components have been listed above, more particular ranges and selections are as follows.<br>
Particular water insoluble organosilicone compounds include:<br>
(a)	dimethicones, dimethicone derivatives and mixtures of the foregoing having a<br>
viscosity in the range of 5-100,000 centipoise (cps), particularly 30-70,000 and even more<br>
particularly 60,000; for example organosilicone compounds of Formula I:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula I<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R5, R6, and R7 are alkyls of 1-6 carbons (especially 1-2 carbons) and z is selected so that the viscosity described above is achieved; and<br>
(b)	aminosilicones of Formula n<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula II<br>
wherein R1, R2. R3, R5, R6, and R7 are alkyls of 1-6 carbons (especially 1-2 carbons); and R4 is<br>
R8-NH-CH2CH2-NH2, R8 is an alkylene of 3-6 carbons;<br>
x= is an average value and is a number in the range of 500-10,000, particularly 500-4,000,<br>
more particularly 500-1000, and especially 750-800; and<br>
y= is an average value and is a number in the range of 1-10, particularly less than 5 and<br>
especially 1.<br>
The dimethicones and silicones previously described can be used in mixtures, especially mixtures where high viscosity materials are mixed with lower viscosity materials. Examples of suitable materials include a dimethicone from Dow Corning (Midland, Michigan) known as Dow Corning Fluid 200 and a dimethicone from Union Carbide (Tarrytown, New York) known as Silicone L-45.<br>
Acrylic stabilizers may be selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid derivatives and their copolymers. Examples of such compounds may be represented by Formula in and Formula IV:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R10 is a member of the group consisting of hydrogen and C1 - C22 alkyl group; and n is an average value and is a number from 3-9200, preferably 3 - 4100, and is selected so that the molecular weight is in the range of 218 - 2,000,000, particularly 218-1,500,000, especially 218 - 1,000,000; and<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R11 and R12 are each independently selected from the same group defined for R10, and m is selected from the same group as defined for n.<br>
For the acrylic acid derivatives and their copolymers compounds any of the acid groups may be:<br>
(a)	neutralized by a member selected from the group consisting of cosmetically<br>
acceptable bases such as sodium hydroxide: phosphates such as sodium phosphate, dibasic;<br>
any other basic salt suitable for use in cosmetic products; and amines such as C3 - C22 aliphatic<br>
amines (especially primary alkyl amines).<br>
(b)	esterified with a member of the group consisting of C3 - C22 aliphatic alcohols.<br>
Additionally the acrylic acid derivatives and their copolymers can be used to form a complex with a cationic compound such as cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride or distearyl diammonium chloride, and polycationics made with such cationic complexes.<br>
Examples of suitable stabilizing agents include acrylates/steareth-20 methacrylate copolymer (for example, ACULYN® 22, from Rohm &amp; Haas, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and acrylates copolymer (for example, ACULYN® 33; ACUSOL®-445, -810, and -830; and ACRYSOL® ASE 75 from Rohm &amp; Haas). For the ACULYN-33 product (having a pH of approximately 3.8), a neutralization step is performed with sodium phosphate (such as disodium phosphate), sodium hydroxide or a cosmetically acceptable organic amine to increase the pH to approximately 6.5. The stabilizing agents should be of a grade and purity acceptable for cosmetic use or purified as needed to be cosmetically acceptable.<br>
More particular values for the groups described above are as follows. For the detersive surfactant mixture more particular groups and ranges are: (1) 1.00-35.0 percent, especially 5.00-30.0 percent, and. more particularly, 6.00-30.0 percent of an anionic detergent selected , for example, from the group consisting of water soluble lipophilic sulfates and/or sulfonates of 8-22 carbon atoms, preferably of 10-20 carbon atoms, more preferably 10-16 or 10-18 carbon atoms, and most preferably 12-16 or 12-18 carbon atoms. Among such anionic detergents there may be mentioned, as examples thereof, higher (10-18 carbons) alkyl sulfates, higher (10-18 carbons) paraffin sulfonates, higher (10-18 carbons) olefin sulfonates, higher (10-18 carbons) fatty acid monoglyceride sulfates, higher (10-18 carbons) fatty alcohol lower (C1 - C6) alkoxy (and polyoxy) sulfates, linear higher (10-18 carbons) alkyl benzene sulfonates and dialkyl sulfosuccinates. The most preferred of these anionic detergents is the higher (10-18 carbons) alkyl sulfates of 10-16 carbon atoms and the higher alkyl lower alkoxy sulfates of 10-18 carbon atoms (preferably with the higher alkyl thereof being lauryl and with 2 or 3 ethoxy groups per mole). However, such alkyls may be of 12-16 carbon atoms and the alkoxy content may be of 1-20 per mole, such as 2-6 ethoxy groups per mole. A most preferred higher fatty alcohol sulfate is lauryl sulfate, and a particularly preferred higher fatty alcohol poly-lower alkoxy sulfate is di- or triethoxylated lauryl alcohol sulfate. Most preferably the anionic detergent will be a mixture of higher (10-18 carbons) alkyl sulfate and higher (10-18 carbons) alkyl ether sulfate, with either being present in greater or equal proportion, and with the ratio of amounts of such components being in the range of 10:1 to 1:10, especially 7:1 to 1:7, for example, 1:5 to 5:1, when both such anionic detergents are present. The anionic detergents will usually be employed in the forms of their water soluble salts, which will usually be salts of alkali metals (sodium, potassium), ammonium, amines (such as dimethylamines and trimethylamine) or lower alkanolamines (such as triethanolamine, diethanolamine and monoethanolamine). Particular examples of suitable<br>
anionic detergents include sodium lauryl sulfate with 2 moles of ethoxylation ("SLES") and corresponding ammonium salt and the triethanolamine salt thereof; olefm sulfonate; tridecyl benzene sulfonate; C12 - C16 acyl monoglyceride sulfate;<br>
(2)	0.05-10.00 percent and, more particularly, 0.05-5.00 percent of an anionic<br>
hydrotrope. for example, sodium cumene sulfonate. sodium benzene sulfonate ; and<br>
(3)	0.50-15.00 percent and, more particularly, 1.00-10.00 percent of an amphoteric<br>
surfactant selected from, for example, cocoamidopropylbetaines, sodium laureth-2-<br>
sulfosuccinate, amphopropionic acid, cocamidobetaine, cocobetaine, cocobetainamido sodium<br>
lauriminodipropionate, dodecyl dimethylamine oxide, octyl dimethylamine oxide, octadecyl<br>
dimethylamine oxide, cocamidopropylamine, cocoamphodipropionic acid,<br>
cocamidopropylhydroxy sultaine.<br>
Another particular groups is an anionic detergent is selected from the group consisting of C12 alkyl C2-3 alkoxy sulfate, C12 alkyl ethoxy sulfate and C10 - C18 fatty alcohol ethoxy sulfates.<br>
The cationic polymers suitable for use with this invention include derivatives of natural polymers such as cellulose and gums. These derivatives are water-soluble to the extent of at least 0.5 percent by weight at 20 degrees C. Generally such polymers have more than 10 monomer units in their molecules and a molecular weight of about 1000 - 1,00,000, preferably 2000 - 500,000. Usually the lower the molecular weight the higher the degree of substitution by the cationic, usually quaternary, group.<br>
Particular materials are those where the cationic portion is a quaternary group such as, for example, where the quaternary group is an alkyl ammonium group selected from the group consisting of C8 - C22 amidopropyl dimethylamine lactate, C8 - C22 amidopropyl morpholine lactate; C8 - C22 amine oxide; dimethylamine lactate; and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable natural polymers which may be converted into the desired cationic polymers Tire hydroxy alkyl celluloses and alkyl hydroxy alkyl celluloses. Cationic hydroxy alkyl celluloses and their preparation are described in British Patent Number 1,166,062 assigned to Union Carbide. These hydroxy ethyl celluloses are marketed under the trade designation JR 125, JR 30M and JR 400 and are believed to have a molecular weight of 150,000 - 400,000 and a degree of substitution off a quaternary group of about 0.3. Polyquaternium-10 is a polymeric quaternary ammonium salt of hydroxyethyl cellulose reacted with a trimethyl ammonium substituted epoxide and is the name for this previous class of materials. Other polyquaternium materials may also be useful. These include products known as Polyquaterniums with numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-9, 11-20, 22, 24, 27-30, especially Polyquatemium-6, Polyquatemium-7; Polyquaternium-10. Alkyl hydroxy alkyl celluloses having the same formula as hydroxy alkyl cellulose, but with additional alkyl substituents at other sites on the anhyhdrogiucose unit also are available. More particularly, the ethyl hydroxy ethyl celluloses are available under the trade name "MODOCOLL" with a molecular weight in the range of about 50,000 - 500,000 and a degree of substitution of about 0.1 - 0.8.<br>
Other suitable natural cationic polymers are the galactomannan gums, for example, guar gum and hydroxy alkylated guar gum, especially cationic guar gum. The molecular weight of guar gum is believed to be from about 100,000 - 1,000,000. A suitable cationic guar gum carrying the group -CH2CH=CHCH2N(CH3)3CT1 with a degree of substitution of about 0.2 - 0.8 is commercially available under the trade names JAGUAR C-17 and C-13.<br>
The proportion of the cationic natural polymer usually will be from about 0.05 percent to 1.0 percent, more particularly from 0.1 percent to 0.8 percent and, more particularly, from 0.1 percent to 0.5 percent by weight of the final composition.<br>
When the cationic natural cellulose or galactomannan gum polymers are present in the inventive compositions, up to one half of the natural polymer may be substituted by a second<br>

The invention also comprises a method for making such stabilized compositions. The major advantage of this process is that it does not require the use of elevated temperature in order to make the stabilized compositions. The method comprises combing the ingredients using conventional mixing equipment using the following steps:<br>
A)	form a main mixture by combining water and surfactant;<br>
B)	separately prepare a dispersion of a cationic polymer such as a polyquaternium compound<br>
in water;<br>
C)	add the dispersion of cationic polymer in water to the main mixture of water and surfactant<br>
to form a gel and continue mixing, preferably until the gel is clear, smooth and homogeneous;<br>
D)	adjust the pH of the mixture to 5.0-8.0 such as by the addition of sodium phosphate<br>
dibasic;<br>
E)	add a surfactant to the mixture such as sodium cumene sulfonate ("SCS") and mix until<br>
uniform;<br>
F)	separately add a first portion of the fragrance, if desired, in combination with a thickening<br>
agent such as cationic guar gum to the mixture;<br>
G)	disperse a thickening agent (optionally with the first portion of fragrance), then add the<br>
dispersion to the main mixture, and mix until uniform;<br>
H) separately prepare a mixture of a foam booster and thickening agent such as<br>
tocodiethanolamide ("CDEA") with disteryldiammonium chloride ("DSDAC") and,<br>
optionally, any remaining portion of the fragrance, and mix until preferably the solution of<br>
these materials is clear (if desired, a low level of heat or the upper range of ambient<br>
temperature may be used, such as in the range of 30-35 degrees);<br>
I) combine the mixture of part "H" with the main mixture until uniform:<br>
J) add the stabilizing component, for example, acrylates copolymer, to the main mixture and<br>
mix until uniform;<br>
K) add the dimethicone to the main mixture and mix until uniform;<br>
L) add in other optional ingredients either alone or in combination to the main mixture and<br>
continue mixing until the mixture is uniform;<br>
M) cool the mixture to 25 degrees if needed;<br>
N) adjust pH of the mixture as necessary;<br>
O) adjust viscosity of the mixture as necessary; and<br>
P) filter product.<br>
In the final products made by this method, the viscosity will be in the range of 1500 -10,000 cps, and particularly 4500 + cps; the pH will be in the range of 4-8, particularly 5-7 and more particularly 6-7; and the specific gravity will be in the range of 0.99-1.01, particularly 0.995 ±0.01.<br>
In evaluating the stability of the shampoos made according to this invention, storage tests can be done. Storage for a selected period of time at a temperature of 49 degrees C may be undertaken to see if any separation of product contents occurred. If separation does not occur after three months, the product is judged as stable with acceptable viscosity, pH, emulsion stability, and color.<br>

Basic Method<br>
A main mixing vessel is selected and equipped with a variable speed "Lightnin' Mixer". The main mixing vessel should be stainless steel (304L or 316L or their equivalent). The other mixing vessels (for example used in Parts 2 and 4) may be stainless steel or plastic and selected to be suitable for the materials used, except that a separate stainless steel vessel as described for the main mixing vessel is needed for Part 5. The vessel for Part 5 should be equipped for minimal mixing and, optionally, heating. Vacuum equipment is not required, but care must be taken not to promote foam formation. Additional equipment may be used if desired.<br>
1.	To the main mixing vessel add suitable amounts of water (preferably deionized water)<br>
and surfactant (for example, ammonium lauryl sulfate ("ALS")). Mix until uniform.<br>
2.	To a separate, dry, clean container, add a suitable amount of unheated , room<br>
temperature water (preferably deionized water). Disperse a suitable amount of a cationic<br>
polymer (for example, Polyquaternium-10) in the water. Mix well until this premix is free of<br>
lumps, but do not mix longer than 5 minutes just prior to addition or it may gel. Add this<br>
premix of Part 2 to the main mixing vessel. Mix the contents of the main vessel for at least 15<br>
minutes or until the gel is clear, smooth and shiny. This should be accomplished before Continuing.<br>
3.	Add a suitable amount of sodium phosphate dibasic to control pH and a suitable<br>
amount of sodium cumene sulfonate ("SCS") to control viscosity to the main mixing vessel.<br>
Mix the batch for at least 15 minutes or until uniform.<br>
4.	To a separate, dry, clean container add a suitable amount of fragrance. Sprinkle in a<br>
suitable amount of cationic guar gum into the fragrance with mixing. Continue mixing until<br>
the cationic guar gum is completely dispersed and free of lumps. Add this mixture from Part 4<br>
to the main mixing vessel and mix the contents of the main mixing vessel for at least 15<br>
minutes or until uniform.<br>
5.	To a separate, heatable, dry clean container add a suitable amount of each of<br>
cocodiethanolamide ("CDEA") and distearyl diammonium chloride ("DSDAC") and about<br>
half of the allocated amount of fragrance. Mix until the solution is clear. Optionally low heat<br>
may be applied to raise the temperature to 30-35 degrees C. This material is then added to the<br>
main mixing vessel and the contents stirred for at least 15 minutes or until uniform.<br>
6.	A suitable amount of acrylates copolymer (or other acrylic stabilizing agent) is then<br>
added to the main mixing vessel. The contents are mixed for at least 15 minutes or until<br>
uniform. A suitable amount of Dimethicone (60,000 cst) is added to the main mixing vessel<br>
and the contents are mixed for at least 15 minutes or until uniform.<br>
7.	To a separate, dry, clean container is added suitable amounts of water (preferably<br>
deionized water) Goldschmidt TegoPearl N-100 and colors. This mixture is mixed for at least<br>
15 minutes or until uniform. The remaining material from Part 7 is then added to the main<br>
mixing vessel with mixing. The mixing is continued for at least 15 minutes or until uniform.<br>
8.	A preservative such as KATHON CG is added to the main mixing vessel and mixing is<br>
continued for at least 15 minutes or until uniform.<br>
9.        If needed the product is cooled to 25 degrees C. Specifications are checked on the watch sample. If necessary, sodium phosphate dibasic is added to increase pH, sodium phosphate monobasic is added to decrease pH; sodium cumene sulfonate (SCS) is added to reduce viscosity, CDEA is added to increase viscosity. If sodium chloride is used as a thickener, the amount should not exceed 1 percent by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
