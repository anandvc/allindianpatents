				<td>The present invention relates to a source-<br>
antenna for transmitting/receiving electromagnetic<br>
waves, more particularly a system of source-antennas<br>
allowing the reception of satellite television signals<br>
in a certain frequency band such as the Ku band lying<br>
between 10.7 and 12.75 GHz and of satellite<br>
communications in a second frequency band such as the<br>
Ka band at around 30 GHz in transmission and at around<br>
20 GHz in reception, using just a single structure of<br>
antennas.<br>
There are at present source-antenna structures<br>
for transmitting/receiving electromagnetic waves which<br>
operate with two frequency bands. These source-antennas<br>
make it possible to meet the requirements of satellite<br>
communication systems in respect of high bit rate<br>
multimedia applications. An antenna of this type has <br>
been proposed in patent WO 99/357/1 in the name of<br>
THOMSON multimedia. These dual-band antenna structures<br>
are composed of two cofocused antennas. Thus, as<br>
described in the abovementioned patent application, the<br>
first antenna used for reception or downpath consists<br>
of an array of n patches. This array can be used in<br>
linear or circular polarization and benefit from two<br>
orthogonal polarizations. The second antenna used for<br>
transmission or uppath consists of a waveguide<br>
terminating in a dielectric rod commonly referred to as<br>
a "polyrod". This antenna can be used in linear or<br>
circular polarization and benefit from two orthogonal<br>
polarizations. These two antennas are made in such a<br>
way that the phase centres of the "polyrod" and of the<br>
array of patches practically coincide and can be placed<br>
at the focus of the system of antennas.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to<br>
incorporate into a transmission/reception source-<br>
antenna structure operating in two frequency bands<br>
another source-antenna structure which operates in<br>
respect of reception, namely the downpath, at a lower<br>
working frequency than the other two frequencies, more<br>
particularly in a frequency band allowing the reception<br>
of conventional satellite television signals. This<br>
makes it possible to obtain an antenna structure<br>
operating on three frequency bands.<br>
Thus, the subject of the present invention is a<br>
source antenna for transmitting/receiving<br>
electromagnetic waves comprising means for transmitting<br>
electromagnetic waves with longitudinal radiation<br>
operating in a first frequency band and means for<br>
receiving electromagnetic waves, characterized in that<br>
the means for receiving electromagnetic waves consist<br>
of a first array of n radiating elements operating in a<br>
second frequency band and a second array of n"<br>
radiating elements operating in a third frequency band,<br>
the first and second arrays and the longitudinal-<br>
radiation means having a substantially common phase<br>
centre and the radiating elements of the first and<br>
second arrays being arranged around the longitudinal-<br>
radiation means.<br>
 According to one embodiment, the first array of<br>
n radiating elements consists of an array of n patches<br>
having linear or circular, orthogonal double<br>
polarization, the first array of n patches being<br>
connected to a feed circuit made in microstrip<br>
technology on a first substrate.<br>
Moreover, the means for transmitting<br>
electromagnetic waves with longitudinal radiation<br>
consist of an antenna of the longitudinal-radiation<br>
travelling wave type with axis coinciding with the axis<br>
of radiation, excited by means comprising a waveguide,<br>
the waveguide being filled with a dielectric material.<br>
This makes it possible to restrict the dimensions of<br>
the cross section of the waveguide and to reduce the<br>
guided wavelength inside the guide. Moreover, the<br>
antenna of the travelling wave type may consist of a<br>
dielectric rod known as a "polyrod" or of a helix.<br>
Furthermore, the second array of n" radiating<br>
elements consists of an array of n" radiating elements<br>
having linear or circular, orthogonal double<br>
polarization and a wide band. This array is made,<br>
preferably, by using two parallel substrates, one of<br>
the substrates being the first substrate receiving the<br>
first array.<br>
According to a first embodiment, the substrate<br>
is covered with a metallic layer forming an earth plane<br>
comprising demetallized zones, at the level of the<br>
radiating elements of the second array.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the<br>
radiating elements of the array with orthogonal double<br>
polarization and a wide band consist of two patches<br>
which are superimposed and made respectively on each<br>
substrate and coupled electromagnetically. In this<br>
case, the two substrates may be connected plumb with<br>
the demetallized zones by metallic walls.<br>
According to another embodiment, the radiating<br>
elements of the array with orthogonal double<br>
polarization and with a wide band consist of a patch<br>
coupled electromagnetically to a probe connected to the<br>
feed circuit.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the<br>
radiating elements of the array with orthogonal double<br>
polarization and a wide band consist of an aperture<br>
made in the first substrate and a probe connected to<br>
the feed circuit and made on the parallel substrate.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the<br>
radiating elements of the array with orthogonal double<br>
polarization and a wide band consist of an aperture<br>
made in the first substrate and a patch connected to<br>
the feed circuit and made on the parallel substrate.<br>
Moreover, the second array of n" radiating<br>
elements is connected to a feed circuit made in<br>
microstrip technology.<br>
According to a characteristic of the present<br>
invention, the first array of n radiating elements is<br>
an array with four elements arranged in a square and<br>
the second array of n" radiating elements is an array<br>
with four elements arranged in a cross around the first<br>
array.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the<br>
first and second frequency bands correspond to the Ka<br>
band and the third frequency band corresponds to the Ku<br>
band.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the<br>
present invention will become apparent on reading the<br>
following description, this description being given<br>
with reference to the herein-appended drawings in<br>
which:<br>
Figure 1 is a plan view from above of a source-<br>
antenna system operating in three frequency bands, in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>

Figures 5a-5b to 9a-9b respectively represent a<br>
view from above and a sectional view of various<br>
embodiments of radiating elements or "patches" used for<br>
receiving in Ku band and in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
 To simplify the description, the same<br>
references will be used in the various figures to<br>
designate the elements fulfilling the same functions or<br>
identical functions.<br>
We shall now describe with reference to Figures<br>
1 to 4 a first embodiment of a source-antenna for<br>
transmitting/receiving electromagnetic waves operating<br>
in three frequency bands. More specifically and as<br>
represented in Figures 2 and 4, the source-antennas<br>
system comprises a first source-antenna used for<br>
transmission or uppath, which, in the embodiment<br>
represented, operates in the Ka band, namely around<br>
30 GHz.<br>
As represented more particularly in Figures 2<br>
and 4, the source-antenna structure used in this case<br>
consists essentially of a waveguide 12 terminating in a<br>
dielectric rod 11, this antenna structure being known<br>
,<br>
by the term "polyrod". The cross section of the<br>
waveguide 12 can be circular, rectangular, square or<br>
other. The shape of the cross section depends on the<br>
amount of room left free by the other two source-<br>
antenna structures, as will be explained hereinbelow.<br>
In the embodiment represented, the cross<br>
section of the waveguide is a circular section 12. As<br>
represented also in Figure 4, this cross section is<br>
filled with dielectric material whose purpose is to<br>
reduce the guided wavelength inside the guide. It is<br>
obvious to the person skilled in the art that other<br>
types of travelling-wave source-antennas may be used to<br>
embody the antenna structure of the uppath. Mention may<br>
be made, in particular, of helical antennas.<br>
A first embodiment of the two source-antenna<br>
structures used on reception, namely for the downpath,<br>
will now be described with reference to Figures 1 to 3.<br>
As represented more particularly in Figures 1 and 2,<br>
the source-antenna structure used for the downpath in<br>
the Ka band, namely around 20 GHz, consists of an array<br>
20 of patches in linear polarization with two<br>
orthogonal polarizations and fed in series/parallel.<br>
More particularly, four patches 231, 232, 233, 234 of<br>
square shape arranged in a cross have been made on a<br>
substrate 21. The patches are arranged around the<br>
"polyrod" in such a way that their diagonal is at a<br>
distance D equal to 0.7 lg where lg is the guided<br>
wavelength.<br>
In the embodiment represented, the patches are<br>
connected as represented in Figure 1, namely the patch<br>
231 is connected to the patch 232 by a line 241, the<br>
patch 232 is connected to the patch 233 by a line 244,<br>
the patch 233 is connected to the patch 234 by a line<br>
243 and the patch 234 is connected to the patch 231 by a<br>
line 242. Moreover, the feed lines 26, 27 are connected<br>
in a specific manner on another input of the patches<br>
231, 234, 233. The feed line 26 is connected by a line<br>
251 to the patch 231, and by a line 252 to the patch 234<br>
and the feed line 27 is connected to the patch 234 by a<br>
line 253 and to the patch 233 by a line 254 in such a<br>
manner as to produce a series/parallel feed. In this<br>
case, the lines 241, 242, 243 and 244 are of the same<br>
length. Given the gap between two patches, these lines <br>
have lengths like lg/2 modulo the guided wavelength. <br>
One embodiment of the transmission/reception<br>
source-antenna structure for the downpath used in the<br>
Ku band, namely between 10.7 GHz and 12.75 GHz, will<br>
now be described with reference to Figures 2 and 3. In<br>
this case, the antenna comprises an array of four<br>
patches. This array of patches is arranged in a square<br>
around the array of four patches in a cross used for<br>
the electromagnetic wave source-antenna in the Ka band,<br>
owing to its lower working frequency.<br>
As represented in Figure 2, the Ku band source-<br>
antenna structure is made by using two parallel<br>
substrates 21, 33 on which electromagnetically coupled<br>
parallel patches 321, 341 have been made, the lower<br>
substrate 33 being used to make the feed circuit which<br>
will be described subsequently and which can receive<br>
patches as represented in Figures 2 and 3, these<br>
electromagnetically coupled patches increasing the pass<br>
band. As represented in Figures 1 to 3, each patch 321,<br>
322, 323, 324 is positioned on the first substrate 21 in<br>
a demetallized part 311, 312, 313, 314 of the layer 22<br>
and the second substrate 33 on which a parallel patch<br>
341 to 344 has been made receives the feed array. The<br>
feed array is represented in greater detail in<br>
Figure 3. In this case, each patch is fed at two points<br>
in such a way as to obtain the two orthogonal<br>
polarizations. More specifically, the patch 341 is<br>
connected to the point C2 of the first feed circuit by<br>
a line 351, the patch 344 is connected to the point C2<br>
by a line 354, the patch 343 is connected to the point C1 by a line 353<br>
and the patch 342 it connected to the point C1 by a line 352. The points<br>
C1 and C2 are connected to the point C3 respectively by a line 355 and<br>
356, the point C3 being connected to a feed line. The length of the lines<br>
353 and 354 is equal, likewise the length of the lines 352 and 311 is equal<br>
and such that length 352 - length 353 =lg/2. Moreover , the patch 343 is<br>
connected by a second input to the point C4 by a line 363, the patch 342<br>
is connected to the point C4 by a line 362, the patch 341 is connected to<br>
the point C5 by a line 361, the patch 344 is connected to the point C5 by<br>
a line 364, the point C4 being connected to the point C6 by a Kne 366 and<br>
the point C5 being connected to the point C6 by a line 365. The point C6<br>
is connected to another feed in such a way as to obtain a parallel feed.<br>
In the second case, the lines 361, 362, 363, 364 are of the same length<br>
and the difference DL between the length of the line 365 and the length<br>
of the line 366=lg/2.<br>
The various feed lines are connected in a known manner to<br>
reception circuits comprising at least a low-noise amplifier and a<br>
frequency converter. The circuits being weft known to the person skilled<br>
in the art, they will not be described in greater detail. Thus, with the<br>
circuit described hereinabove, the patches 341, 342, 343, 344 are all fed<br>
in phase and with the same amplitude by two power dividers made in<br>
microstrip technology, the feeding of the patches having to be done in<br>
phase so that the electric fields add together in the direction of<br>
propagation of the guided waves. Specifically, the phase shift d between<br>
two horizontally polarized waves is equal to d = b* DL where b = (2p/Ag),<br>
lg being equal to the wavelength of the guided wave.<br>
In the embodiment represented, the patches are excited via<br>
opposite lateral sides. Thus, the patch 341 is excited via its toft lateral<br>
side, this creating, at an instant t, a field E oriented from left to right<br>
while simultaneously the patch 344 is excited via its<br>
right lateral side which creates at the same instant t<br>
a field E oriented from right to left ultimately giving<br>
out-of-phase fields. By introducing a wavelength<br>
difference given by the difference of the length of the<br>
lines 351 and 354 which is equal to lg/2, a further<br>
phase shift d is created such that d = b* DL = <br>
(2P/lg)*x (lg/2) = P, thereby cancelling out the<br>
difference of the phases between the said electric<br>
fields. This configuration improves the quality of the<br>
polarization, since it eliminates the problems of cross<br>
polarization.<br>
Various embodiments of the patches used in the<br>
framework of the Ku band reception source-antenna<br>
structure will now be described with reference to<br>
Figures 5a-5b to 9a-9b. Various figures represent the<br>
lower right part of the system of Figure 1.<br>
Represented in Figures 5a-5b is another<br>
embodiment of the patches. In this case, a patch 302<br>
with square shape has been deposited on the upper<br>
substrate 300. As represented clearly in the figure,<br>
the earth plane 301 has been recessed in such a way as<br>
to form a window 303 facilitating radiation. Moreover,<br>
a second patch 306 electromagnetically coupled to the<br>
first patch 302 is made parallel to the first patch 302<br>
on the lower substrate 304. The patch 306 is fed by the<br>
lines 307 and 307" in two orthogonal sides. In<br>
accordance with this embodiment, metal walls 304 are<br>
provided plumb with the window 303 in such a way as to<br>
favour forward radiation of the superimposed patches<br>
306 and 302. The part between the two substrates 305-<br>
300 is filled with air. According to a variant, it<br>
could be filled with a material such as a foam.<br>
Represented in Figures 6a and 6b is another<br>
embodiment with superimposed patches. In this case, the<br>
upper substrate 310 furnished with the earth plane 311<br>
is recessed to form a window 314. The part lying<br>
between the upper substrate 310 and the lower substrate<br>
315 is filled with foam. The patch 312 is made on the<br>
foam and is coupled electromagnetically to the patch<br>
316 made on the lower substrate 315. The patch 316 is<br>
fed like the patch 306 of Figures 5a and 5b by the<br>
lines 317 and 317".<br>
Yet another embodiment has been represented in<br>
Figures 7a and 7b. In this case, a patch 322 has been<br>
made on the upper substrate 320 in the window 323<br>
obtained by demetallizing the earth plane 321. The feed<br>
circuit formed at least of the lines 327 and 327" is<br>
made on the lower substrate 325 furnished with an earth<br>
plane 326. In this case, the patch 322 is coupled<br>
electromagnetically with the lines 327, 327".<br>
The embodiments of Figures 8a and 8b and<br>
Figures 9a and 9b are akin to a radiating aperture.<br>
Thus, as represented in Figures 8a and 8b, the upper<br>
substrate 330 furnished with its earth plane 331 is<br>
recessed to form a window 333. In the embodiment<br>
represented, the upper substrate 330 is mounted on the<br>
lower substrate 335 with interposition of the metal<br>
walls 334. The feed lines 337, 337" are made on the<br>
lower substrate 335. In this case, the radiating<br>
aperture thus made is excited by probes.<br>
In the variant represented in Figures 9a and<br>
9b, a patch 336 is made on the lower substrate 335.<br>
This patch 336 is connected to the feed lines 337, 337"<br>
in a conventional manner.<br>
The embodiments described hereinabove by way of<br>
example make it possible to incorporate a source-<br>
antenna in reception operating in the Ka band with a<br>
source-antenna in reception operating in the Ku band,<br>
the two antennas being cofocused.<br>
It is obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the frequency bands are given by way of<br>
illustration and that the invention can also operate in<br>
other bands.<br>
It is obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that other types of arrays could be used to produce the<br>
source-antennas structures used on reception, in<br>
particular any type of array comprising radiating<br>
elements with linear or circular, orthogonal<br>
double polarization.<br>

The Invention relates to an improvement to a compact, low cost and hybrid<br>
waveguide/microstrip feed such that for the high frequency transmitting band, the<br>
feed is realised in a W/G technology using a well known compact polyrod feed<br>
solution, and for the low frequency receiving band, the feed is realized in a<br>
microstrip technology. In order to ensure the necessary wide frequency<br>
bandwidth, a small array of dual band electromagnetically coupled patch<br>
antennas is used. This antenna operates within two frequency bands. The<br>
present invention proposes a new structure able to operate within three<br>
frequency bands. According to the invention, the antenna feed comprises a<br>
second network of n" radiating elements operating in a third frequency band. This<br>
invention is used for satellite antennas.</td>
