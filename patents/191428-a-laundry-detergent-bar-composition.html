				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to improved laundry detergent bar composition. More particularly, it relates to laundry detergent bars comprising anionic detergent surfactant, a detergent builder, an effective amount of a dye transfer inhibitor for improved whitening and dye transfer inhibition, and an effective amount of an optical brightener for improved whitening and dye transfer inhibition.<br>
Detergent compositions in the form of synthetic detergent granules and liquids are used in many societies to launder clothes, particularly in those societies where mechanical washing machines are common. In portions of such societies, and more frequently in societies where mechanical washing machines are not common, laundry detergent bars comprising synthetic organic surfactants and detergency builders are used in the laundering of clothes.<br>
Technical developments in the field of laundry detergent bars have concerned formulating bars which are effective in cleaning clothes; which have acceptable sudsing characteristics in warm and cool water and in hard and soft water; which have acceptable in-use wear rates, hardness, durability and feel; which have low smear; and which have a pleasing odor and appearance. Examples of laundry bars include those described in the following Patents and publications: U. S. Patent 3,178,370 (issued to Okenfuss on April 13, 1965 and incorporated herein by reference) describes laundry detergent bars comprising sodium alkylbenzene sulfate (ABS), sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium bicarbonate trisodium orthophosphate, and water, and processes for making these; Philippine Patent 13,778 (issued to Anderson on September 23, 1980) describes synthetic detergent laundry bars containing surfactant, alkali metal pyrophosphate, from about 18% to about 60% alkaline earth metal carbonate, and from about 1% to about 20% water. U.S. Pat. 4,543,204 (issued to Gervasio on September 24, 1985) discloses laundry detergent bars containing 10 to 35% of higher fatty alkyl sulfate, and from 1 to 10% of higher fatty acid which makes the bars more resistant to breaking on handling and storage;<br><br>
U.S. Patent 5,089,174, issued to Kaw et al, on Feb. 18, 1992, discloses an improved laundry bar comprising a mixture of anionic surfactants comprising alkyl sulfate and alkylbenzene sulfonate, wherein fatty alcohol is added to advantageously reduce bar wear rate and improve solubility. Surfactant ratios of 90/10 to 10/90 by weight of alkyl sulfate/alkylbenzene sulfonate are disclosed; and Philippine Patent 26,860 (issued Nov. 16, 1982 to Unilever) discloses a laundry bar containing surfactant which is at least 1/3 primary alkyl sulfate and 12-60% builder consisting of at least two alkali metal phosphate selected form orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, and tripolyphosphate.<br>
Methods for making laundry detergent bars are well known in the art. Examples of methods and processes for making laundry bars include those described in the following Patents and publications: Philippine Patent 23,689 (issued Sept. 27, 1989 to Unilever) discloses a process for making a bar containing 7-45% detergent surfactant, comprising the steps of neutralizing with alkaline material (such as carbonate) the acid precursor of the detergent surfactant, in the presence of a desiccant/adsorbent material, such as oleum, sulfuric acid, and anhydrous sulfate, followed by the addition of other ingredients, prior to formation into bars; and Philippine Patent 24,551 (issued Aug. 3, 1990 to Unilever) discloses a process for making a bar containing 7-45% detergent surfactant and 0-60% builder, comprising the steps of neutralizing with alkaline material (such as carbonate) the acid precursor of the detergent surfactant, in the presence of 0.25 - 50% by weight of silica-containing material, such as crystalline aluminosilicate, silica gels, and amorphous silica, followed by the addition of other ingredients, prior to formation into bars.<br>
One of the most persistent and troublesome problems arising during conventional laundering operations is the tendency of some colored fabrics to release dye or dyes into the laundering solutions. These so-called fugitive dyes are then transferred onto other fabrics oftentimes having colors different than the fugitive dyes. This problem is commonly referred to in the art as "dye transfer." For white colored fabrics, this is usually perceived as increased dinginess. Conveniently, the coloring matter in the "dirt" on the fabrics being laundered which may likewise be transferred to other fabrics in the laundering solution is included within the meaning of dye transfer.<br>
As is known, one way of overcoming the dye transfer problem is to complex or otherwise absorb the fugitive dyes before they have the opportunity to'become attached to other fabric articles in the laundering solution. To that end, various polymers have been included in detergent compositions to inhibit dye transfer. For example, European Application No. 372 291, Jacobs et al, discloses a process for washing discoloration-sensitive textiles in which the washing or laundering solution contains several water-soluble polymers including N-vinylimidazol, N-vinyloxazolidone, N-vinylpyrrolidone and copolymers thereof to inhibit dye transfer.<br><br>
Optical brighteners are fluorescent whitening agents that show dye transfer inhibition benefits bv a fabnc surface modification mechanism. The brighteners can displace dyes from the fabric surface due to its greater fabric affinity. The bnghtener then gives the fabric surface a more anionic character which is expected to repel inbound fugitive dyes, decreasing the dyes' kinetics of desorption.<br>
However, none of the dye transfer inhibitorss or optical brighteners alone are completely satisfactory in performance. Therefore, there remains a need to improve the whitening and dye transfer inhibition of clothes washed using laundry bars while maintaining good soil cleaning and removal, and other physical bar properties.<br>
An object of the present invention is to improve the whitening and dye transfer inhibition of clothes washed by laundry bars containing an effective amount of a dye transfer inhibitor in combination with an effective amount of an optical bnghtener, while providing good surfactant mileage, cleaning, wear rate, solubility, and other bar aesthetics.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The laundry detergent bars of the present invention comprise detergent surfacuint, deicrgency builder, an effective amount of a dye transfer inhibitor, and an effective amount of an optical brighlener to improve the whitening and dye transfer inhibition of the clothes washed by the bars.   Preferably, the bars comprise from about 10% to about 60% by weight anionic surfactant, from about 5% to about 60% by weight detergent builder, from about 0.10% to about 2.0% of a dye transfer inhibitor, and from about 0.05% to about 1.0% of an optical bnghtener.<br>
Non-limiting dye transfer inhibitor examples of polymeric materials include polyvinylpyrridine N-oxide. polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), PVP-poryvinylirrtidazole copolymer, and mixtures thereof. Copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidonc and N-vinylimidazole polymers (PVPI) are also preferred for use as dye transfer inhibitors herein.<br>
Preferred optical brighteners are diamino stilbenc, distyrilbiphcnyl-iype optical brighteners, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The novelty of the invention lies in the combination of the optical brightener and the dye transfer inhibitor.<br><br>
According to the present invention relates to a laundry detergent bar composition comprising:<br>
(a)	from 10% to 60% by weight anionic surfactant such as hereinbefore described;<br>
(b)	from 5% to 60% by weight detergent builder such as hereinbefore described;<br>
(c)	from 0.1 % to 2.0% of a dye transfer inhibitor such as hereinbefore described; and<br>
(d)	an effective amount of an optical brightener such as hereinbefore described in order to improve whiteness and dye transfer inhibition of clothes.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
While this specification concludes with claims distinctly pointing out and particularly claiming that which is regarded as the invention, it is believed that the invention can be better understood through a careful reading of the following detailed description of the invention. In this specification all<br>
percentages are by weight, all temperatures are expressed in degrees Celsius, molecular weights are in weight average, and the decimal is represented by the point(.), unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Detergent surfactant<br>
Laundry bars of the present invention typically comprise 10% to about 60% of an anionic surfactant. A preferred anionic surfactant for use is an alkyl sulfate (AS) having an alkyl chain of from 10 to 20 carbon atoms, a branched-chain alkylbenzene sulfonate (ABS) having an alkyl chain of from 10 to 22 carbon atoms, a linear-chain alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) having an alkyl chain of from 10 to 22 carbon atoms, and mixtures thereof. Preferred bars comprise about 15% to about 40%, more preferably from about 18% to about 32%, such anionic surfactant.<br>
The alkyl portion of said ABS or LAS surfactant preferably contains from 10 to 16 carbon atoms, more preferably from 10 to 14 carbon atoms. Most preferably, the alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant is LAS.<br>
The alkyl portion of the AS surfactant preferably contains from 10 to 18 carbon atoms, more preferably from 12 to 16 carbon atoms. The AS surfactant can comprise a mixture of a longer-chain AS, such as one having 16 to 18 carbons, and a shorter-chain alkyl such as one having 11-13 carbons. Preferred AS surfactants include coconut alkyl sulfate, tallow alkylsulfate, and mixtures thereof; most preferably, coconut alkyl sulfate.<br>
The cation for the ABS, LAS and the AS is preferably sodium, although other useful cations include triethanolamine, potassium, ammonium, magnesium, and calcium, or mixtures thereof.<br>
A preferred anionic surfactant comprised a mixture of AS and alkylbenzene sulfonate. A mixture of AS and alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant typically comprises a ratio by weight of AS surfactant: alkylbenzene sulfonate from 10:90 to 95:5, more preferably from 40:60 to 95:5, and most preferably from 75:25 to about 90:10. In a preferred embodiment, the laundry bar comprises an anionic surfactant comprising a molar ratio mixture of AS and LAS of from 0:100 to about 100:0, more preferably from about 82:18 to about 88:12, and most preferably from about 84:16 to about 87:13. Such detergent bars are disclosed in co-pending Philippines Patent application 47165-A, filed Oct. 29, 1993, by Rodney M. Wise and Belal U. Siddique, assigned to The Procter &amp; Gamble Company.<br>
Other optional surfactants include zwitterionic, nonionic, amphoteric surfactants alone or in conjunction with anionic surfactants.<br>
Detergent Builder<br>
The laundry bars of the present invention comprise from about 5% to about 60% by weight detergent builder. Preferred laundry bars comprise from about 5% to about 30% builder, more preferably from about 7% to about 20%, by weight of the bar. These detergent builders can be, for example, water-soluble alkali-metal salts of phosphates, pyrophosphates, orthophosphates, tripolyphosphates, higher polyphosphates, and mixtures thereof. A preferred builder is a water-soluble alkali-metal salt of tripolyphosphate, and a mixture of tripolyphosphate and pyrophosphate. The builder can also be a non-phosphate detergent builder. Specific examples of a non-phosphorous, inorganic detergency builder include water-soluble inorganic carbonate and bicarbonate salts. The alkali metal (e.g., sodium and potassium) carbonates, bicarbonates, and silicates are particularly useful herein.<br>
Sodium carbonate is a particularly preferred ingredient in laundry bars, since in addition to its use as a builder, it can also provide alkalinity to the laundry bar for improved detergency, and also can serve as a neutralizing agent for acidic components added in the bar processing. Sodium carbonate is particularly preferred as a neutralizing inorganic salt for an acid precursor of an anionic surfactant used in such laundry bars, such as the alkyl sulfuric acid and alkyl benzene sulfonic acid.<br>
Also useful are aluminosilicate ion exchange materials. These aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be either naturally occurring or synthetically derived. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite B, and Zeolite X. In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material is Zeolite A and has the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, especially about 27.<br>
Water-soluble organic detergency builders, for example alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium polycarboxylates, are also useful herein. Specific examples of useful polycarboxylate builder salts include sodium, potassium, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, mellitic acid, benzene polycarboxylic acid, polyacrylic acid, polymaleic acid, acrylic acid-maleic acid copolymers, polyaspartic acid, and citric acid, or such acids per se. These polymers typically have an average molecular weight of less than about 100,000, more preferably about 1000-10,000. Other useful polycarboxylate detergency builders are the materials set forth in U.S. Pat. 3,308,067 issued to Diehl on March 7, 1967, incorporated herein by reference. Mixtures of detergent builders can be used in the present invention.<br>
Co-polymers of acrylic acid and maleic acid are preferred as auxiliary builders, since it has been observed that their use in combination with the fabric softening clay and the clay flocculating agent further stabilizes and improves the clay deposition and fabric softening performance.<br>
Specific preferred examples of builders include sodium tripolyphosphates (STPP) and sodium pyrophosphates (TSPP), and mixtures thereof. Other specifically preferred examples of builders include zeolite and polycarboxylates.<br>

Any polymer backbone can be used as long as the amine oxide polymer formed is water-soluble and has dye transfer inhibiting properties. Examples of a suitable polymeric backbone is polyvinyl, polyalkylene, polyester, polyether, polyamide, polyimide, polyacrylate and mixtures thereof. The polymer can include random or block copolymers where one monomer type is an amine N-oxide and the other monomer type is an N-oxide. The amine N-oxide polymers typically have a ratio of amine to the amine N-oxide of 10:1 to 1:1,000,000. However, the number of amine oxide groups present in<br>
the polyamine oxide polymer can be varied by appropriate copolymerization or by an appropriate degree of N-oxidation. The polyamine oxides can be obtained in almost any degree of polymerization. Typically, the average molecular weight is within the range of 500 to 1,000,000; more preferred 1,000 to 500,000; most preferred 5,000 to 100,000.<br>
The dye transfer inhibitor is advantageously used at levels in the bar up to about 10%, preferably from about 0.1% to 2%, more preferably from about 0.1% to about 0.25%.<br>
Alternative dye transfer inhibitor can also be used. Copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole polymers (referred to as "PVPI") are also preferred for use herein. Preferably the PVPI has an average molecular weight from 5,000 to 1,000,000, more preferably from 5,000 to 200,000, and most preferably from 10,000 to 20,000. (The average molecular weight range is determined by light scattering as described in Barth, et al., Chemical Analysis, Vol 113. "Modern Methods of Polymer Characterization", the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.) The PVPI copolymers typically have a molar ratio of N-vinylimidazole to N-vinylpyrrolidone from 1:1 to 0.2:1, more preferably from 0.8:1 to 0.3:1, most preferably from 0.6:1 to 0.4:1. These copolymers can be either linear or branched.<br>

Examples of PVP are disclosed in, for example, EP-A-262,897 and EP-A-256,696, incorporated herein by reference. Compositions containing PVP can also contain polyethylene glycol ("PEG") having an average molecular weight from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 10,000. Preferably, the weight ratio of PEG to PVP is from about 2:1 to about 50:1, and more preferably from about 3:1 to about 10:1.<br>
Optical Brightener<br>
Optical brighteners are fluorescent whitening agents that show dye transfer inhibition benefits via a fabric surface modification mechanism. The brighteners can displace dyes from the fabric surface due to its greater fabric affinity. The brightener then gives the fabric surface a more anionic character which is expected to repel inbound fugitive dyes, decreasing the dyes' kinetics of desorption.<br>
Preferred optical brighteners are diamino stilbene and distyrilbiphenyl-type optical brighteners. Preferred as examples of such brighteners are 4,4'-bis{[4-anilino-6-bis(2-hydoxyethyl)amino-l,3,5-trizin-2-yl]amino}stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid disodium salt, 4-4'-bis(2-sulfostyryl) biphenyl and 4,4'-<br>
bis[(4-anilino-6-morpholino-l,3,5-triazin-2-yl) amino]stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid disodium salt. Such optical brighteners, or mixtures thereof, can be used at levels in the bar of from about 0.05% -1.0%, preferably 0.05% - 0.5%.<br>

In addition to the auxiliary surfactants mentioned above, a hydrotrope, or mixture of hydrotropes, can be present in the laundry detergent bar. Preferred hydrotropes include the alkali metal, preferably sodium, salts of tolune sulfonate, xylene sulfonate, cumene sulfonate, sulfosuccinate, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the hydrotrope, in either the acid form or the salt form, and being substantially anhydrous, is added to the linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid prior to its neutralization. The hydrotrope will preferably be present at from about 0.5% to about 5% of the laundry detergent bar.<br>
Fabric Softening Clay<br>
The fabric softening clay is preferably a smectite-type clay. The smectite-type clays can be described as expandable, three-layer clays; i.e., alumino-silicates and magnesium silicates, having an ion exchange capacity of at least about 50 meq/100 g. of clay. Preferably the clay particles are of a size that they can not be perceived tactilely, so as not to have a gritty feel on the treated fabric of the clothes. The fabric softening clay can be added to the bar to provide about 1% to about 30% by weight of the bar, more preferably from about 5% to about 20%, and most preferably about 8% to 14%.<br>
While any of the smectite-type clays described herein are useful in the present invention, certain clays are preferred. For example, Gelwhite GP is an extremely white form of smectite-type clay and is<br>
therefore preferred when formulating white granular detergent compositions. Volclay BC, which is a smectite-type clay mineral containing at least 3% iron (expressed as Fe2O3) in the crystal lattice, and which has a very high ion exchange capacity, is one of the most efficient and effective clays for use in the instant compositions from the standpoint of product performance. On the other hand, certain smectite-type clays are sufficiently contaminated by other silicate minerals that their ion exchange capacities fall below the requisite range; such clays are of no use in the instant compositions.<br>
Clay Flocculating Agent<br>
The polymeric clay flocculating agent is selected to provide improved deposition of the fabric<br>
softening clay. Typically such materials have a high molecular weight, greater than about 100,000.<br>
Examples of such materials can include long chain polymers and copolymers derived from monomers<br>
such as ethylene oxide, acrylamide, acrylic acid, dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate, vinyl alcohol,<br>
vinyl pyrrolidone, and ethylene imine. Gums, like guar gums, are suitable as well.<br>
A preferably clay flocculating agent is selected from high molecular weight polyethylene oxide, polyacrylic amide, and polyacrylate having a molecular weight of about 100,000 to about 10 million. It has been found that the use of a clay flocculating agent in a laundry bar containing softening clay provides surprisingly improved softening clay deposition onto the clothes and clothes softening performance, compared to that of laundry bars comprising softening clay alone. The amount of clay flocculating agent to be used in the laundry bar is preferably an effective amount to provided noticeably improved fabric softening performance. The amount of clay flocculating agent to be used can vary depending on the type of clay flocculating agent employed, the type of fabric softening clay, and the types and levels of other detergent adjuvants in the laundry bar. The level of clay flocculating agent is conveniently referred to in terms of its weight percentage of the amount of fabric softening clay in the bar. The bar will typically comprise, by weight of fabric softening clay, about 0.001% to about 30% clay flocculating agent, more preferably about 0.01% to about 15%, and most preferably about 0.5% to about 5%.<br>
The effectiveness of the clay flocculating agent in general becomes greater as the molecular weight of the flocculating agent increases. The polymers typically have an average molecular weight of about 100,000 to about 10 million, more preferably from about 150,000 to about 5 million. As with the level of clay flocculating agent, selection of an appropriate polymer molecular weight will depend on the type of clay and the type of flocculating agent, as well as the other components of the composition.<br>
The preferred clay flocculating agent is a poly(ethylene oxide) polymer.<br>
Detergent Chelant: A particularly preferred optional component of the present invention is a detergent chelant. Such chelants are able to sequester and chelate alkali cations (such as sodium, lithium and potassium), alkali metal earth cations (such as magnesium and calcium), and most preferably, heavy metal cations such as iron, manganese, zinc and aluminum. Preferred cations include sodium, magnesium, zinc, and mixtures thereof. The detergent chelant is particularly beneficial for maintaining good cleaning performance and improved surfactant mileage, despite the presence of the softening clay and the clay flocculating agent. Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that the softening clay structure contains iron (Fe) and other transition metal ions. In the washing process, substitution by calcium and magnesium in the wash water and in the soils of the iron or other transition metal ions can occur, dislodging the transition metal ion into the wash solution. These metal ions are known to contribute to yellowing and graying of fabrics. The detergent chelant can reduce significantly these effects.<br>
The detergent chelant is preferably a phosphonate chelant, particular one selected from the group consisting of diethylenetriamine penta(methylene phosphonic acid), ethylene diamine tetra(methylene phosphonic acid), and mixtures and salts and complexes thereof, and an acetate chelant, particularly one selected from the group consisting of diethylenetriamine penta(acetic acid), ethylene diamine tetra(acetic acid), and mixtures and salts and complexes thereof. Particularly preferred are sodium, zinc, magnesium, and aluminum salts and complexes of diethylenetriamine penta(methylene phosphonate) diethylenetriamine penta (acetate), and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably such salts or complexes have a molar ratio of metal ion to chelant molecule of at least 1:1, preferably at least 2:1.<br>
The detergent chelant can be included in the laundry bar at a level up to about 5%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 3%, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 2%, most preferably from about 0.5% to about 1.0%. Such detergent chelant component can be used beneficially to improve the surfactant mileage of the present laundry bar, meaning that for a given level of anionic surfactant and level of detergent chelant, equivalent sudsing and cleaning performance can be achieved compared to a similar bar containing a higher level of the anionic surfactant but without the detergent chelant.<br>
The detergent chelants can be used in a particulate or granular form, or in an aqueous or solvent solution. Methods of preparing such salts and complexes are well known, and are described in U.S. Patent 4,259,200, issued 3/31/81, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. A preferred form is a particulate or a granular form. Such particulate or granules of the detergent chelant can be formed with an organic or inorganic binding material. A suitable organic binding material is e.g. a nonionic surfactant. Suitable inorganic binding materials include sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium<br>
carbonate, magnesium sulfate, and the like. Any granulation technique known in the art can be employed, e.g. by spraying a molten nonionic surfactant on to a moving bed of the dried metal complex, fluid-bed drying, etc.<br>
Enzyme: Another particularly preferred component is a detergent enzyme. Non-limiting types of enzymes include cellulase, lipase, amylase, lipolase, malease, protease, catalase, maltase, and phosphatase. Particularly preferred are cellulase, lipase, protease, amylase, and mixtures thereof. Enzymes are advantageously used at levels up to 5%. A particularly cellulase enzyme which provides fabric care and softening benefits by in situ enzymatic hydrolysis of amorphous, non-crystalline cellulose, which is associated with damaged cellulosic fibers. A particularly preferred cellulase is Carezyme® cellulase, supplied by Novo Nordisk.<br>
Another useful optional component of the laundry detergent bars of this invention is silicate, especially sodium or magnesium silicate. Sodium silicate can be used at up to about 15% silicate solids having a weight ratio of SiO2 to Na2O between about 1.0:1 and about 3.4:1.<br>
Another preferred additional component is a layered, crystalline alkaline silicate. A preferred commercially-available layered silicate is known as "SKS-6" (Na2Si2Os), is available from Hoechst, and is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,664,839, issued May 12, 1987. Another preferred layered silicate is disclosed in EP Publication 550,048, July 7, 1993 (Kao), which discloses a synthesized crystalline material having a chain structure and having a composition represented by the following formula in anhydrous form:<br>
xM2OySiO2ZM'O, wherein M represents Na and/or K; M' represents Ca and/or Mg; y/x is 0.5 to 2.0; and z/x is 0.005 to 1.0, said chain structure appearing as a main scattering peak in Raman spectra at least 970+20 cm"1 in the range of 900 to 1200 cm-1. Such layered silicate material is particularly preferred because it can provide both alkalinity, and calcium sequestering or builder functionality.<br>
Another preferred additional component of the laundry bar is fatty alcohol having an alkyl chain of 8 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably from 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Fatty alcohol is effective at reducing the bar wear rate and smear (mushiness) of the present laundry bars. A preferred fatty alcohol has an alkyl chain predominandy containing from 16 to 18 carbon atoms, so-called "high-cut fatty alcohol," which can exhibit less base odor of fatty alcohol relative to broad cut fatty alcohols. Typically fatty alcohol is contained in the laundry bar at up to a level of 10%, more preferably from about 0.75% to about 6%, most preferably from about 2% to about 5%. The fatty alcohol is generally added to the formulation of the present invention as free fatty alcohol. However, low levels of fatty alcohol can be introduced into the bars as impurities or as unreacted starting material. For example,<br><br><br>
laundry bars based on coconut fatty alkyl sulfate can contain, as unreacted starting material, from 0.1% to 3.5%, more typically from 2% to 3%, by weight of free coconut fatty alcohol on a coconut fatty alkyl sulfate basis.<br>
The free fatty alcohol can also serve as a suds booster, for reinforcing and extending suds generation and longevity. For suds boosting, a preferred fatty alcohol has an alkyl chain predominantly having 12 to 14 carbon atoms, used in the composition at a level from about 0.5% to 3%. Preferably, a narrow-cut C12 alkyl alcohol is used at a level of 0.5% to 2%.<br>
Another preferred component of the laundry can include a soil release polymer. Such soil release polymers can be used at levels up to 5%, preferably at from about 0.05% to about 3%, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 1.0%. A soil release polymer can improve the multi-cycle cleaning of clothes washed with the laundry bar. Preferred soil release polymer materials includes those disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,877,896, issued Oct. 31, 1989, and U.S. Patent 5,182,043, issued Jan. 26, 1993, herein disclosed by reference.<br>

The soil release polymer can be added to the bar composition during the making process in a liquid or a granular form. In a preferred embodiment, the soil release polymer is in a low density, porous particulate form. Such porous soil release polymer form can be made by spray-drying a solution of<br><br><br>
the soil release polymer in liquid form, alone or with one or more carrier materials, to remove substantially all free water or other solvent liquid, by spray drying methods well known in the art.<br>
Another preferred optional component in the laundry bar is a secondary fabric softener component in addition to the softening clay. Such materials can be used at levels of about 0.1% to 5%, more preferably from 0.3% to 3%, and can include: amines of the formula R4R5R6N, wherein R4 is C5 to C22 hydrocarbyl, R5 and R6 are independently C1 to C10 hydrocarbyl. One preferred amine is ditallowmethyl amine; complexes of such amines with fatty acid of the formula R7COOH, wherein R7 is C9 to C22 hydrocarbyl, as disclosed in EP No. 0,133,804; complexes of such amines with phosphate esters of the formula R8O-P(0)(OH)-OR9 and HO-P(O)(OH)-OR9, wherein R8 and R9 are independently C1 to C20 alkyl of alkyl ethoxylate of the formula -alkyl-(OCH2CH2); cyclic amines such as imidazolines of the general formula 1-(higher alkyl) amido (lower alkyl)-2-(higher alkyl)imidazoline, where higher alkyl is from 12 to 22 carbons and lower alkyl is from 1 to 4 carbons, such as described in UK Patent Application GB 2,173,827; and quaternary ammonium compounds of the formula R10R11R12R13N+X wherein R10 is alkyl having 8 to 20 carbons, R11 is alkyl having 1 to 10 carbons, R12 and R13 are alkyl having 1 to 4 carbons, preferably methyl, and X is an anion, preferably C1" or Br", such as C12-13 alkyl trimethyl ammonium chloride.<br>
Yet another optional component in the laundry bar is a bleach component. The bleaching component can be a source of "OOH group, such as sodium perborate monohydrate, sodium perborate tetrahydrate and sodium percarbonate. Sodium percarbonate (2Na2CO3-3H2O2) is preferred since it has a dual function of both a source of HOOH and a source of sodium carbonate.<br>
Another optional bleaching component is a peracid per se, such as a formula:<br>
CH3(CH2)w-NH-C(O)-(CH2)zCO3H wherein z is from 2 to 4 and w is from 4 to 10. (The compound of the latter formula where z is 4 and w is 8 is hereinafter referred to as NAPAA.)

Binding agents for holding the bar together in a cohesive, soluble form can also be used, and include natural and synthetic starches, gums, thickeners, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Soil suspending agents can be used.

Soil suspending agents can also include water-soluble salts of carboxymethylcellulose and carboxyhydroxymethylcellulose. A preferred soil suspending agent is an acrylic/maleic copolymer, commercially available as Sokolan®, from BASF Corp. Other soil suspending agents include polyethylene glycols having a molecular weight of about 400 to 10,000, and ethoxylated mono- and polyamines, and quaternary salts thereof.<br>
Dyes, pigments, germicides, and perfumes can also be added to the bar composition.<br>
Processing:<br>
The detergent laundry bars of the present invention can be processed in conventional soap or detergent bar making equipment with some or all of the following key equipment: blender/mixer, mill or refining plodder, two-stage vacuum plodder, logo printer/cutter, cooling tunnel and wrapper.<br>
In a typical process, the fabric softening clay and the clay flocculating are mixed, typically with other raw materials, in the blender. Alkylbenzene sulfonic acid (when used) is added into a mixture of alkaline inorganic salts (preferably which includes sodium carbonate) and the resulting partially neutralized mixture is mechanically worked to effect homogeneity and complete neutralization of the mixture. Once the neutralization reaction is completed, the alkyl sulfate surfactant is added, followed by the remaining other ingredient materials. The mixing can take from 1 minute to 1 hour, with the usual mixing time being from 2 to 20 minutes. The blender mix is discharged to a surge tank. The product is conveyed from the surge tank to the mill or refining plodder via a multi-worn transfer conveyor.<br>
The alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (HLAS) can be made by well-known processes, such as with SO3 or oleum. It can be preferably to include excess inorganic sulfuric acid (H2SO4) in the stock of HLAS, which, upon neutralization, helps to increase the temperature of the product due to the heat of neutralization of the inorganic sulfuric acid.<br><br>
Alternatively the fabric softening clay and the clay flocculating agent can, independently, be added at other times or places in the process, depending on the type of equipment and type of formulation to be made.<br>
After milling or preliminary plodding, the product is then conveyed to a double stage vacuum plodder, operating at a high vacuum, e.g. 600 to 740 millimeters of mercury vacuum, so that entrapped air is removed. The product is extruded and cut to the desired bar length, and printed with the product brand name. The printed bar can be cooled, for example in a cooling tunnel, before it is wrapped, cased, and sent to storage.<br>
