WO 2007/002418	PCT/US2006/024503<br><br>
LOW-LEAKAGE CURRENT SOURCES AND ACTIVE<br>
CIRCUITS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to electronics circuits, and more specifically to current sources and active circuits.<br>
II.	Background<br>
[0002] Current sources are widely used to provide current for various circuits such as amplifiers, buffers, oscillators, and so on. Current sources may be used as bias circuits to provide bias currents, active loads to provide output currents, and so on. Current sources are often fabricated on integrated circuits (ICs) but may also be implemented with discrete circuit components.<br>
[0003] As IC fabrication technology continues to improve, the size of transistors continues to shrink. The smaller transistor size enables more transistors and thus more complicated circuits to be fabricated on an IC die or, alternatively, a smaller die to be used for a given circuit. The smaller transistor size also supports faster operating speed and provides other benefits.<br>
[0004] Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is widely used for digital circuits and many analog circuits. A major issue with shrinking transistor size in CMOS is leakage current, which is the current passing through a transistor when it is turned off. A smaller transistor geometry results in higher electric field (E-field), which stresses a transistor and causes oxide breakdown. To decrease the E-field, a lower power supply voltage is often used for smaller geometry transistors. However, the lower supply voltage also increases the propagation delay of the transistors, which is undesirable for high-speed circuits. To reduce the delay and improve operating speed, the threshold voltage (Vt) of the transistors is reduced. The threshold voltage determines the voltage at which the transistors turn on. However, the lower threshold voltage and smaller transistor geometry result in higher leakage current. [0005] Leakage current is more problematic as CMOS technology scales smaller. This is because leakage current increases at a high rate with respect to the decrease in<br><br>
WO2007/002418	PCT/US2006/024503<br><br>
transistor size. Leakage current can impact fee performance of certain circuits such as phase lock loops (PLLs), oscillators, digital-to-analog converters (DACs), and so on. [0006] Some common techniques for combating leakage current include using high threshold voltage (high-Vt) transistors and/or larger transistor sizes (e.g., longer gate lengths). High-Vt transistors may impact circuit performance (e.g., slower speed) and typically require an additional mask step in the IC fabrication process. Larger-size transistors are marginally effective at combating leakage current since (1) leakage current is a relatively weak function of channel length and (2) there are practical limits on how long the channel length may be extended. Both of these solutions may thus be inadequate for certain circuits.<br>
[0007] There is therefore a need in the art for a current source with low leakage current and good performance.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008] Low-leakage current sources and active circuits suitable for use in various circuit blocks (e.g., amplifiers, buffers, oscillators, DACs, and so on) are described herein. An active circuit is any circuit with at least one transistor, and a current source is one type of active circuit. For a low-leakage circuit, a transistor provides an output current when enabled in an ON state and presents low leakage current when disabled in an OFF state. Since leakage current is a strong function of threshold voltage, low leakage current is achieved by manipulating the voltages at the gate and source of the transistor to increase the threshold voltage of the transistor, which in turn decreases the leakage current.<br>
[0009] In an embodiment, a circuit comprises first, second, and third transistors, which may be P-channel field effect transistors (P-FETs) or N-channel field effect transistors (N-FETs). The first transistor provides the output current when enabled and presents low leakage current when disabled. The second transistor couples to the first transistor and enables or disables the first transistor. The third transistor couples in series with the first transistor and connects or isolates the first transistor to/from a predetermined voltage, which may be a positive power supply voltage, circuit ground, a negative power supply voltage, a regulated voltage, or some other voltage. The circuit may further include a pass transistor that provides a reference voltage to the source of the first transistor when the first transistor is disabled.   In the ON state, the first<br><br>
WO 2007/002418	PCT/US2006/024503<br>
transistor provides the output current, and the second and third transistors do not impact performance. In the OFF state, the second and third transistors are used to provide the proper voltages to the first transistor to place it in a low-leakage state. <br>
[0010] The first, second, and third transistors may be used for a low-leakage current source within a current mirror. In this case, the current mirror further includes fourth and fifth transistors. The fourth transistor is diode connected and receives a reference current from a current source. The fifth transistor couples in series with the fourth transistor. The first and third transistors mirror the fourth and fifth transistors, and the output current is related to the reference current. The low-leakage current source may be used as an active load (e.g., for an amplifier), a bias circuit to provide a bias current, and so on. The first, second, and third transistors may also be used for an amplifier stage. In this case, the first transistor may be operated as a gain transistor that provides signal gain.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022] The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any embodiment or design described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or designs.<br>
[0023] The low-leakage current sources and active circuits described herein may be implemented in various technologies with adjustable transistor threshold voltage. Some exemplary technologies include P-channel metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), N-channel MOSFETs, and so on. For clarity, the following description is for circuits implemented with FETs and further assumes that (1) the bulk/substrate/body of an integrated circuit is tied to a low power supply (Vss), which may be circuit ground, (2) the body of N-FETs are connected to the low power supply, and (3) the body of P-FETs are connected to a high power supply (VDD)- Also for simplicity, the low power supply is circuit ground in the following description. [0024] FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a conventional N-MOS current mirror 100. Current mirror 100 includes N-FETs 112 and 122 and a current source 114. N-FET 112 is diode connected and has it source coupled to circuit ground, its gate coupled to its drain, and its drain coupled to current source 114. Current source 114 provides a reference current of Iref. N-FET 122 has its source coupled to circuit ground, its gate coupled to the gate of N-FET 112, and its drain providing an output current of IoUt. [0025] During normal operation, the gate-to-source voltage (Vgs) of N-FET 112 is set such that the Iref current from current source 114 passes through N-FET 112. The same Vgs voltage is applied at N-FET 122 since the gates of N-FETs 112 and 122 are coupled together and the sources are also coupled together. If N-FET 122 is identical to N-FET 112, then N-FET 122 is forced to provide the same Iref current since the Vgs voltage is the same for both N-FETs. N-FET 122 is thus a current source that mirrors N-FET 112. N-FET 122 may also be designed to provide an output current that is related to (and not necessarily equal to) the Iref current. The lout current from N-FET 122 is dependent on the Iref current flowing through N-FET 112 and the ratio of the size of N-FET 122 to the size of N-FET 112.<br>
[0026] Current mirror 100 may be turned off by collapsing or turning off current source 114. When this occurs, only leakage currents flow through N-FETs 112 and 122, with the amount of leakage current being determined by various parameters such as<br><br>
WO 2007/002418	PCT/US2006/024503<br>
the threshold voltage (Vt), the drain-to-source voltage (Vds), and the gate-to-source voltage (Vgs) of these N-FETs. For certain applications, the leakage current of N-FET 122 may be too high, especially as transistor size shrinks.<br>
[0027] FIG. 2 shows a schematic diagram of an embodiment of an N-MOS low-leakage current mirror 200. Current mirror 200 includes N-channel N-FETs 210, 212, 220, 222, and 224 and a current source 214. N-FETs 210 and 212 and current source 214 are coupled in series. N-FET 210 has it source coupled to circuit ground, its gate coupled to the VDD supply voltage, and its drain coupled to the source of N-FET 212. N-FET 212 is diode connected and has its gate and drain coupled together and to current source 214, which provides a reference current of Iref.<br>
[0028] N-FETs 220 and 222 are coupled in series and form a low-leakage current source. N-FET 220 has its source coupled to circuit ground, its gate receiving an enable control signal (Enb), and its drain coupled to the source of N-FET 222. N-FET 222 has its gate coupled to the gate of N-FET 212 and its drain providing an output current of lout. N-FET 224 has its source coupled to the source of N-FET 222, its gate receiving a<br>
complementary enable control signal (Enb), and its drain coupled to the gates of N-<br>
FETs212and222.<br>
[0029]      N-FETs 210, 212, 220, and 222 are coupled such that the current flowing<br>
through N-FETs 220 and 222 mirrors the current flowing through N-FETs 210 and 212.<br>
N-FETs 210 and 220 may be scaled in size relative to N-FETs 212 and 222. N-FET 222<br>
is an output transistor that provides the lout current. N-FET 220 acts as a switch that<br>
connects or isolates the source of N-FET 222 to/from circuit ground. N-FET 224 is a<br>
control transistor that enables or disables N-FET 222. Current mirror 200 operates as<br>
described below.<br>
[0030]      FIG. 3A shows low-leakage current mirror 200 in the ON state, which may<br>
also be called an active state or some other name. la the ON state, the Enb signal is at<br>
logic high and the Enb signal is at logic low. N-FET 210 is always turned on, and the Vgs voltage of N-FET 212 is set such that the Iref current from current source 214 flows through N-FET 212. N-FET 220 is turned on by the logic high on the Enb signal, and the voltage at node Nz is determined by the V&amp; voltage of N-FET 220, which is typically small for a switch, e.g., several milli-volts (mV). N-FET 224 is turned off by the logic low on the Enb signal. The same gate voltage (Vg) is applied at both N-FETs 212 and 222 since the gates of these N-FETs are coupled together. N-FET 222 is turned<br><br>
WO 2007/002418                                                                                                              PCT/US2006/024503<br><br>
on and provides the Iout current. This Iout current is dependent on (1) the Iref current flowing through N-FETs 210 and 212 and (2) the ratio of the sizes of N-FETs 220 and 222 to the sizes of N-FETs 210 and 212. In the ON state, current mirror 200 behaves like conventional current mirror 100, albeit with a small resistive degeneration due to N-FETs 210 and 220.<br>
[0031] BIG. 3B shows low-leakage current mirror 200 in the OFF state, which may also be called a low-leakage state or some other name. In the OFF state, the Enb signal is at logic low and the Enb signal is at logic high. N-FET 220 is turned off by the logic low on the Enb signal and isolates the source of N-FET 222 from circuit ground. N-FET 224 is turned on by the logic high on the Enb signal, which results in a zero or low Vds voltage for N-FET 224. The V^ voltage of N-FET 222 is equal to the Vds voltage of N-FET 224 because the drain of N-FET 224 is coupled to the gate of N-FET 222 and the sources of these N-FETs are coupled together. N-FET 222 is turned off because of the zero or low Vgs voltage, as long as the drain voltage of N-FET 222 is sufficiently high.<br>
[0032] Table 1 summarizes the logic values of the control signals, the states of N-FETs 220, 222, and 224, the current via N-FET 222, and the voltage at node Nz for the ON and OFF states.<br>

[0033] In the OFF state, low leakage current is achieved for N-FET 222 via several mechanisms. First, the Vgs voltage of N-FET 220 is zero or a low value due to N-FET 224 being turned on. Second, the source voltage (Vs) of N-FET 222 is raised higher than circuit ground. This is achieved by turning off N-FET 220 and isolating the source<br><br>
WO 2007/002418	PCT/US2006/024503<br><br>
of N-FET 222, which results in node Nz being a high impedance (hi-Z) node. The voltage at node Nz is then raised higher by diode-connected N-FET 212 and switched-on N-FET 224 and is approximately equal to the V&amp;s voltage of switched-on N-FET 212. The ON Vgs voltage of N-FET 212 is determined by the Lref current as well as the dimension of N-FET 212. If the bulk/substrate of the integrated circuit is tied to circuit ground, then the source-to-bulk voltage (Vsb) of N-FET 224 is increased by raising the voltage at node Nz. The higher Vab voltage increases the threshold voltage Vt of N-FET 222, which then decreases the leakage current through N-FET 222. [0034] The threshold voltage Vt is a function of the VSb voltage and may be expressed as:<br>
V.-V.o + y^+V,,,-^) ,	Eq(l)<br>
where y is a parameter that is dependent on electrical characteristics of the transistor; <br>
            is a Fermi potential; and<br>
Vto is the threshold voltage with Vsb = 0 volt.<br>
[0035] If the Vgs voltage is less than the ON voltage of the transistor, then the leakage current increases linearly with an increasing VdS voltage and further decreases exponentially as the Vth, voltage is increased. A small leakage current may be obtained with a Vgs voltage that turns off N-FET 222, a Vds voltage that is as small as possible, and a threshold voltage that is as high as possible. A transfer function for drain current (la) versus Vgs voltage for a MOS transistor resembles the well-known transfer function for a diode. The drain current for the MOS transistor is small for a Vgs voltage that is less than a "knee" voltage, which may be several hundred mV. Thus, low leakage current may be achieved by applying a sufficiently small Vgs voltage to N-FET 222. Leakage current is a strong function of the threshold voltage. Thus, low leakage current may be achieved by manipulating the gate and source voltages of N-FET 222 to increase the threshold voltage. In addition, the leakage current of N-FET 220 flows through N-FET 224, which presents a lower impedance path than N-FET 222. Low leakage current thus flows through N-FET 222 in the OFF state. <br>
[0036] The gate voltage of N-FET 222 may be set to a lower voltage that ensures that the gate-to-drain voltage (Vgd) of N-FET 222 is not forward biased when N-FET 222 is turned off. This may be achieved by reducing the Lref current of current source<br><br>
WO 2007/002418	PCT/US2006/024503<br>
214 in the OFF state, which then reduces the Vgs voltage of N-FET 212, which in turn reduces the gate voltage of N-FET 222. For example, the Vgs voltage of N-FET 212 may be reduced to less than a diode voltage drop (e.g., reduced to between 200 to 300 mV), which then ensures that N-FET 222 will not be forward biased even if the voltage at the output node (Vout) drops to 0 mV. A different biasing scheme would then be needed for in this case.<br>
[0037] Exemplary designs of conventional current mirror 100 in FIG. 1 and low-leakage current mirror 200 in FIG. 2, with comparable Iout current and transistor sizes, were evaluated. The leakage current of N-FET 122 within current mirror 100 is up to 100 nano-Amperes (nA). In contrast, the leakage current of N-FET 222 within current mirror 200 is approximately 70 pico-Amperes (pA). The low-leakage design shown in FIG. 2 can thus substantially reduce the amount of leakage current (by a factor of more than 1000 for the exemplary designs). The low leakage current is highly desirable for many low-leakage applications, as described below.<br>
[0038] FIG. 4 shows a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a P-MOS low-leakage current mirror 400. Current mirror 400 includes P-FETs 410, 412, 420, 422, and 424 and a current source 414. P-FETs 410 and 412 and current source 414 are coupled in series. P-FET 410 has it source coupled to the VDD power supply, its gate coupled to circuit ground, and its drain coupled to the source of P-FET 412. P-FET 412 is diode connected and has its gate and drain coupled together and to current source 414, which provides a reference current of W.<br>
[0039] P-FETs 420 and 422 are coupled in series and form a low-leakage current source. P-FET 420 has its source coupled to the VDD power supply, its gate receiving<br>
the Enb signal, and its drain coupled to the source of P-FET 422. P-FET 422 has its gate coupled to the gate of P-FET 412 and its drain providing an output current of Iout. P-FET 424 has its source coupled to the source of P-FET 422, its gate receiving the Enb signal, and its drain coupled to the gates of P-FETs 412 and 422. <br>
[0040] P-FETs 410, 412, 420, and 422 are coupled such that the current flowing through P-FETs 420 and 422 mirrors the current flowing through P-FETs 410 and 412. P-FET 422 is an output transistor that provides the Iout current. P-FET 420 acts as a switch that connects or isolates the source of P-FET 422 to/from the VDD power supply. P-FET 424 is a control transistor that enables or disables P-FET 422. Current mirror 400 operates as described below.<br><br>
WO 2007/002418	PCT/US2006/024503<br>
[0041] In the ON state, the Enb signal is at logic high and the Enb signal is at logic low. P-FET 410 is always turned on, and the Vgs voltage of P-FET 412 is set such that the Iref current from current source 414 passes through P-FET 412. P-FET 420 is turned on by the logic low on the Enb signal, and P-FET 424 is turned off by the logic high on the Enb signal. P-FET 422 is turned on and provides the Iout current, which is dependent on the Iref current and the ratio of the sizes of P-FETs 420 and 422 to the sizes of P-FETs 410 and 412.<br>
[0042] In the OFF state, P-FET 420 is turned off by the logic high on the Enb signal, and P-FET 424 is turned on by the logic low on the Enb signal. The zero or low Vds voltage for P-FET 424 turns off P-FET 422. Low leakage current is achieved for P-FET 422 by (1) turning off P-FET 420 to obtain high impedance at node Nz and (2) bringing the source voltage of P-FET 422 lower via P-FETs 412 and 424. This causes the threshold voltage V, of P-FET 422 to increase, which decreases the leakage current through P-FET 422. In addition, the leakage current of P-FET 420 is funneled through P-FET 424, which presents a lower impedance path than P-FET 422. Low leakage current thus flows through P-FET 422 in the OFF state.<br>
[0043] JIG. 5 shows a schematic diagram of another embodiment of an N-MOS low-leakage current mirror 500. Current mirror 500 includes N-FETs 510, 512, 520, 522, 524 and 526 and a current source 514. N-FETs 510 and 512 and current source 514 are coupled in series and in the same manner as N-FETs 210 and 212 and current source 214, respectively, in FIG. 2. N-FETs 520 and 522 are also coupled in series and form a low-leakage current source. N-FET 524 has its source coupled to circuit ground,<br>
its gate receiving the Enb signal, and its drain coupled to the gates of N-FETs 512 and 522. N-FET 526 has its source coupled to the source of N-FET 522, its gate receiving<br>
the Enb signal, and its drain coupled to a reference voltage of VWf. N-FET 510 is always turned on.<br>
[0044] Transistors 510, 512, 520, and 522 are coupled such that the current flowing through N-FETs 520 and 522 mirrors the current flowing through N-FETs 510 and 512. N-FET 522 is an output transistor that provides the Iout current. N-FET 520 acts as a switch that connects or isolates the source of N-FET 522 to/from circuit ground. N-FET 524 is a control transistor that enables or disables N-FET 522. N-FET 526 is a pass transistor that, when enabled, couples the Vref voltage to node Nz. Current mirror 500 operates as described below.<br><br>

[0045] In the ON state, N-FET 520 is turned on by the logic high on the Enb signal, and N-FETs 524 and 526 are both turned off by the logic low on the Enb signal. N-FET 522 is turned on by the gate voltage of N-FET 512 and provides the Iout current, which is dependent on the Iref current and the ratio of the sizes of N-FETs 520 and 522 to the sizes of N-FETs 510 and 512.<br>
[0046] In the OFF state, N-FET 520 is turned off by the logic low on the Enb signal, and N-FETs 524 and 526 are both turned on by the logic high on the Enb signal. The zero or low VdS voltage for N-FET 524 turns off N-FET 522. Low leakage current is achieved for N-FET 522 by (1) turning off N-FET 520 to obtain high impedance at node Nz and (2) providing the Vref voltage to the source of N-FET 522 via N-FET 526. This increases the threshold voltage of N-FET 522, which decreases the leakage current through N-FET 522. In addition, the leakage current of N-FET 520 flows through N-FET 526, which presents a lower impedance path than N-FET 522. <br>
[0047] For current mirror 500, a Vas voltage of zero volts may be achieved for N-FET 522 in the OFF state, for example, by buffering the Vout voltage at the drain of N-FET 522 and using this buffered voltage as the Vref voltage, which is then provided to the source of N-FET 522 via N-FET 526. If this feedback mechanism is not utilized and if the Vout voltage is not known, then the Vref voltage may be set to VDD/2 or to the expected voltage at the drain of N-FET 522.<br>
[0048] As indicated by the various embodiments described above, low leakage for an output transistor (e.g., N-FET 222, 422, or 522) that provides an output current may be achieved by (1) applying a low, zero, or reverse biased Vgs voltage to turn off the output transistor and (2) bringing the source of the output transistor away from the supply voltage (e.g., VDD or Vss) and toward the Vout voltage. The second part may be achieved by isolating the source of the output transistor with a switch transistor (e.g., FET 220, 420, or 520) and manipulating the voltage at the source of the output transistor (e.g., with FET 224,424, or 526).<br>

The drain of N-FET 212 couples to the drain of P-FET 642 and provides a load current of Iloadl. The drain of N-FET 222 couples to the drain of P-FET 644 and provides a load current of Iloadl - Load circuit 200 is the active load for differential pair 640. In steady state, with the same voltage being applied to the gates of P-FETs 642 and 644, the Iloadl current flowing through FETs 642 and 212 is equal to the Iloadl current flowing through FETs 644 and 222, and the bias current is equal to the sum of both load currents (i.e., Iloiss= Iloadl + Iloadl2)• Amplifier 600 operates as follows. <br>

P-FET 422 is turned off by the zero or low V^ voltage with P-FET 424 being turned on, and low leakage current flows through P-FET 422. Similarly, N-FET 222 is turned off by the zero or low Vgs voltage with N-FET 224 being turned on, and low leakage current flows through N-FET 222 and hence the output of amplifier 600. Current source 214 is turned on within load circuit 200, provides a low impedance path for the leakage current of N-FET 220, and raises the gate voltage of N-FET 222. <br>

[0062] JIG. 9 shows a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a dual-stage amplifier 900 utilizing low-leakage current sources and active circuits. Amplifier 900 includes a first stage 902, an output stage 904, and a load circuit 906. First stage 902 may be implemented with various designs, e.g., with differential pair 640 and current mirror 200 as shown in FIG. 6. Output stage 904 includes a common-source amplifier 938 and an active load that is implemented with a low-leakage current source 928. [0063] Within load circuit 906, P-FETs 910 and 912 and a current source 914 are coupled in series and in the same manner as P-FETs 410 and 412 and current source 414, respectively, in FIG. 4. P-FETs 920 and 922 are coupled in series and form a load circuit for first stage 902. P-FETs 910, 912,920, and 922 are also coupled such that the average current flowing through P-FETs 920 and 922 is related to the current flowing through P-FETs 910 and 912.<br>
[0064] Load circuit 928 includes P-FETs 924, 930 and 932 that are coupled in the same manner as P-FETs 824, 830 and 832, respectively, in FIG. 8. Load circuit 928 is the active load for output stage 904 and is also part of load circuit 906. [0065] Common-source amplifier 938 includes N-FETs 954, 960, 962 and 966 that are coupled in the same manner as N-FETs 854, 860, 862 and 866, respectively, in FIG. 8. The gate of N-FET 962 is the input of output stage 904 and is coupled to the output of first stage 902. The drain of N-FET 962 is the output of output stage 904 and is coupled to the drain of N-FET 932 within load circuit 928. Amplifier 900 operates as follows. <br>
[0066]      In the ON state, the logic high on the Enb signal turns on N-FET 960 and<br>
turns off P-FET 924, and the logic low on the Enb signal turns on P-FET 930 and turns off N-FET 954. Load circuit 928 is turned on and provides the bias current for common-source amplifier 938. Common-source amplifier 938 is also enabled, receives and amplifies the output signal (Vol) from first stage 902, and provides the output signal (Vout) for amplifier 900. <br>
[0067]      In the OFF state, the logic low on the Enb signal turns off N-FET 960 and<br>
turns on P-FET 924, and the logic high on the Enb signal turns off P-FET 930 and turns on N-FET 954.

current flows through N-FET 962. P-FET 932 and N-FET 962 present low leakage currents to the output of amplifier 900.<br>
[0068] For the embodiment shown in FIG. 9, only output stage 904 is disabled in the OFF state.  First stage 902 may also be disabled in the OFF state by providing the<br>
gate of P-FET 920 with the Enb signal.<br>
[0069] In general, an amplifier may include any number of stages. To obtain low leakage current in the OFF state, the output stage of the amplifier may utilize low-leakage current sources for the biasing circuit (e.g., as shown in FIGS. 6 through 8) and/or low-leakage current sources for the active load (e.g., as shown in FIGS. 6 through 9). The output stage may also utilize a low-leakage active circuit for the gain portion of the stage (e.g., as shown in FIG. 9).<br>
[0070] Low-leakage current sources and active circuits described herein may be used for various circuit blocks such as amplifiers (e.g., as shown in FIGS. 6 through 9), unity gain buffers, charge pumps, active loop filters, DACs, and other circuit blocks where low leakage is desirable. The low-leakage current sources and active circuits may also be used for various applications such as PLL, automatic gain control (AGC), time tracking loop, and so on. The use of low-leakage circuits for an exemplary PLL is described below.<br>
[0071] FIG. 10 shows a PLL 1000 suitable for use in various end applications (e.g., wireless communication). A voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) 1050 generates an oscillator signal having a frequency that is determined by a VCO control signal (e.g., a voltage) from a loop filter 1040. A frequency divider 1060 divides the oscillator signal in frequency by a factor of N, where N £ 1, and provides a feedback signal. <br>
[0072] A phase frequency detector 1010 receives a reference signal and the feedback signal, compares the phases of the two signals, and provides a detector signal that indicates the detected phase difference or error between the two signals. For example, detector 1010 may provide Early and Late digital signals that indicate whether the reference signal is early or late with respect to the feedback signal. A low-leakage charge pump 1020 receives the detector signal and generates a current signal that is determined by (and related to) the detected phase difference. Charge pump 1020 may utilize low-leakage current sources and/or low-leakage active circuits to provide low leakage current when disabled.<br><br>
WO 2007/002418	PCT/US200./024S03<br>
[0073] A tuning/calibration circuit 1030 may provide an adjustment signal (e.g., a voltage) used to tune VCO 1050, calibrate VCO 1050, and so on. This adjustment signal is buffered by a low-leakage buffer 1032 and provided to a summer 1022. Summer 1022 sums the current signal from charge pump 1020 and the buffered signal from buffer 1032 and provides a summed signal to loop filter 1040. Loop filter 1040 filters the signal from summer 1022 and provides the VCO control signal. Summer 1022 may also be placed after (instead of before) loop filter 1040, and the signal from buffer 1032 may be summed with the signal from loop filter 1040 to obtain the VCO control signal.<br>
The VCO control signal controls the frequency of the oscillator signal. Any noise on the VCO control signal translates into phase noise on the oscillator signal. Low-leakage circuits may be used throughout PLL 1000 to reduce noise and error on the VCO control signal. During normal operation, loop filter 1040 may be active and tuning/calibration circuit 1030 and buffer 1032 may be disabled. Loop filter 1040 adjusts the VCO control signal such that the phase of the feedback signal is locked to the phase of the reference signal. Once the PLL is locked to the reference signal, the current signal from charge pump 1020 is typically active for only a small portion of each clock cycle. Charge pump 1020 may be enabled during the time that the current signal may be active and disabled at all other times. This results in low leakage current charging/discharging loop filter 1040 when charge pump 1020 is disabled. During normal operation, buffer 1032 is disabled and presents low leakage current to summer 1022. Low leakage results in less noise since leakage current interferes with the signal from phase frequency detector 1010. During tuning/calibration, circuit 1030 is active and provides the adjustment signal, and low-leakage buffer 1032 provides signal drive for the adjustment signal.<br>
[0074] The low-leakage current sources and active circuits described herein may be implemented in various IC process technologies such as C-MOS, N-MOS, P-MOS, bipolar-CMOS (Bi-CMOS), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and so on. CMOS technology can fabricate both N-FET and P-FET devices on the same die, whereas N-MOS and P-MOS technologies can fabricate N-FETs and P-FETs, respectively. The low-leakage current sources and active circuits may also be fabricated with various device size technologies (e.g., 0.13 mm, 90 nm, 30 nm, and so on). The low-leakage current sources and active circuits described herein are more effective and beneficial as IC<br><br>

process technology scales smaller (i.e., to smaller "feature" or device length). The low-leakage current sources and active circuits may also be fabricated on various types of IC such as radio frequency ICs (RFICs), digital ICs, mixed-signal ICs, and so on. <br>

ABSTRACT<br>
"LOW-LEAKAGE CURRENT SOURCES AND ACTIVE CIRCUITS"<br>
A low-leakage circuit includes first, second, and third transistors, which may be P-channel or N-channel FETs. The first transistor provides an output current when enabled and presents low leakage current when disabled. The second transistor enables or disables the first transistor. The third transistor connects or isolates the first transistor to/from a predetermined voltage (e.g., VDD or Vss). The circuit may further include a pass transistor that provides a reference voltage to the source of the first transistor when the first transistor is disabled. In an ON state, the first transistor provides the output current, and the second and third transistors do not impact performance. In an OFF state, the second and third transistors are used to provide appropriate voltages to the first transistor to place it in a low-leakage state. The first, second, and third transistors may be used for a low-leakage current source within a current mirror, an amplifier stage, and so on.<br></td>
