THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 OF 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10 ; rule 13)<br>
1. TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
METHOD OF TREATING A TEXTILE<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act. 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever house, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
This invention relates to a method of treating textiles such as laundry fabrics, more specifically to a method whereby bleaching by atmospheric oxygen is catalysed after the treatment. This invention also relates to textiles thus treated.<br>
In a conventional bleaching treatment, a substrate such as a laundry fabric or other textile is contacted is subjected to hydrogen peroxide, or to substances which can generate hydroperoxyl radicals, such as inorganic or organic peroxides.<br>
A preferred approach to generating hydroperoxyl bleach radicals is the use of inorganic peroxides coupled with organic precursor compounds. These systems are employed for many commercial laundry powders. For example, various European systems are based on tetraacetyl ethylenediamine (TAED) as the organic precursor coupled with sodium perborate or sodium percarbonate, whereas in the United States laundry bleach products are typically based on sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulphonate (SNOBS) as the organic precursor coupled with sodium perborate. Alternatively, or additionally, hydrogen peroxide and peroxy systems can be activated by Dleach catalysts, such as by complexes of iron and the ligand N4Py (i.e. N, N-bis(pyridin-2-yl-mewyl)-bis(pyridin-2-yl)methylamine) disclosed in W095/34628, or the ligand Tpen (i.e. N, N, N\ N'-tetra(pyridin-2-yl-methyl)ethylenediamine) disclosed in W097/48787,^ It has long been thought desirable to be able to use atmospheric oxygen (air) as the source for a bleaching species, as this would avo.'d the need for costly fiydroperoxyl generating systems. Unfortunately, air-as such is kinetically inert towards bleaching substrates and exhibits no bleaching ability. Recently some progress has been made in this area. For example, WO 97/38074 reports the use of air for oxidising stains on fabrics by bubbling air througrfan aqueous solution containing an aldehyde and a radical initiator, whereas according to W095/34628 and W097/48787 referred to above, molecular oxygen may<br><br>
be used as the oxidant with the iron catalysts, as an alternative to peroxide generating  systems.<br>
However, the known art teaches a bleaching effect only as long as fhe substrate is being subjected to the bleaching treatment. Thus, there is no expectation that hydrogen peroxide or peroxy bleach systems could continue to provide a bleaching effect on a treated substrate, such as a laundry fabric after washing and drying, since the bleaching species themselves or any activators necessary for the bleaching systems would be assumed to be removed from the substrate, or consumed or deactivated, on completing the wash cycle and drying.<br>
It would be desirable to be able to treat a textile such that, after the treatment is completed, a bleaching effect is observed on the textile. Furthermore, it would be desirable to be able to provide a bleach treatment for textiles such as laundry fabrics whereby residual bleaching occurs when the treated fabric has been treated and is dry.<br>
We have now found this can be achieved by a treatment method in accordance with the present invention, by catalysing bleaching of the substrate by atmospheric oxygen after treatment of the substrate.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of treating a textile by contacting the textile with an organic substance which forms a complex with a transition metal, whereby the complex catalyses bleaching of the textile by atmospheric oxygen after the treatment.<br>
The present invention further provides a dry textile having an organic substance as defined above applied or deposited thereon, whereby bleaching by atmospheric oxygen is catalysed on the textile.<br><br>
Advantageously, by enabling a bleacliing effect even after the textile has been treated, the benefits of bleaching can be prolonged on the textile. Furthermore, since a bleaching effect is conferred to the textile after the treatment, the treatment itself, such as a laundry wash cycle, may for example be shortened. Moreover, since a bleaching effect is achieved by atmospheric oxygen after treatment of the textile, hydrogen peroxide or peroxy-baged bleach systems can be omitted from the treatment substance.<br>
The organic substance may be contacted to the textile fabric in any suitable manner. For example, it may be applied in dry form, such as in powder form, or in a liquor that is then dried, for example as an aqueous spray-on fabric treatment fluid or a wash liquor for laundry cleaning, or a non-aqueous dry cleaning fluid or spray-on aerosol fluid. Other suitable means of contacting the organic substance to the textile may be used, as further explained below.<br>
Any suitable textile that is susceptible to bleaching or one that one mighf wish to subject to bleaching may be used. Preferably the textile is a laundry fabric or garment.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the method according 10 the present invention is carried out on a laundry fabric using an aqueous treatment liquor. In particular, the treatment may be effected in a wash cycle for cleaning laundry. More preferably, the treatment is carried out in an aqueous detergent bleach wash liquid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the treated textile is dried, by allowing it to dry under ambient temperature or at elevated temperatures.<br>
v<br>
The bleaching method may be carried out by simply leaving the substrate in contact with the organic substance for a sufficient period of time. Preferably, however, the organic substance is in an aqueous medium, and the aqueous medium on or containing the substrate is agitated.<br><br>
The organic substance can be contacted to the textile fabric in any conventional manner. For example it may be applied in dry form, such as in powder form, or in a liquor that is then dried, for example in an aqueous spray-on fabric treatment fluid or a wash liquor for laundry cleaning, or a non-aqueous diy cleaning fluid or spray-on aerosol fluid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the treated textile is dried, by allowing it to dry under ambient temperature or at elevated temperatures.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the method according to the present invention is carried out" on a laundry fabric using aqueous treatment liquor. In particular the treatment may be effected in, or as an adjunct to, an essentially conventional wash cycle for cleaning laundry. More preferably, the treatment is carried out in an aqueous detergent wash liquor. The organic substance can be delivered into the wash liquor from a powder, granule, pellet, tablet, block, bar or other such solid form. The solid form can comprise a carrier, which can be particulate, sheet-like or comprise a three-dimensional object The carrier can be dispersible or soluble in the wash liquor or may remain substantially intact. In other embodiments, the organic substance can be delivered into the wash liquor from a paste, gel or liquid concentrate.<br>
It is particularly advantageous that the organic substance used in the method of the present invention makes use of atmospheric oxygen in its bleaching activity. This avoids  the requirement that peroxygen bleaches and/or other relatively large quantities of reactive substances need be used in the treatment process. Consequently, only a relatively small quantity of bleach active substance need be employed and this allows dosage routes to be exploited which could previously not be used. Thus, while it is preferable to include the organic substance in a composition that is normally used in a washing process, such as a pre-treatment, main-wash, conditioning composition or ironing aid, other means for ensuring that the organic substance is present in the wash liquor may be envisaged.<br><br>
For example, it is envisaged that the organic substance can be presented in the form of a body from which it is slowly released during the whole or part of the laundry process. Such release can occur over the course of a single wash or over the course of a plurality of washes. In the latter case it is envisaged that he organic substance can be released from a carrier substrate used in association with the wash process, e.g. from a body placed in the dispenser drawer of a washing maciune, elsewhere in the delivery system or in the drum of the washing machine. When used in the drum of the washing machine the carrier can be freely moving or fixed relative to the drum. Such fixing can be • achieved by mechanical means, for example by ba. bs that interact with the drum-wall, or employ other forces, for example a magnetic force. The modification of a washing machine to provide for means to hold and retain such a carrier is envisaged similar means being known from the analogous art of toilet block manufacture. Freely moving carriers such as shuttles for dosage of surfactant materials and/or other detergent ingredients into the wash can comprise means for the release of the organic substance into the wash.<br>
In the alternative, the organic substance can be presented in the form of a wash additive that preferably is soluble. The additive can take any of the physical forms used for wash additives, including powder, granule, pellet, sheet, tablet, block, bar o: other such solid form or take the form of a paste, gel or liquid. Dosage of the additive can be unitary or in a quantity determined by the user. While it is envisaged that such additives can be used in the main washing cycle, the use of them in the conditioning or drying cycle is not hereby excluded.<br>
&gt;<br>
The present invention is not limited to those circumstances in which a washing machine is employed, but can be applied where washing is performed in some alternative vessel. In these circumstances it is envisaged that the organic substance can be delivered by means of slow release from the bow), bucket or other vessel which is being employed, or from any implement which is being employed,,such as a brush, bat or dolly, or from any suitable applicator.<br><br>
Suitable pre-treatment means for application of the organic substance to the textile material prior to the main wash include sprays, pens, roller-ball devices, bars, soft solid applicator sticks and impregnated cloths or cloths containing microcapsules. Such means are well known in the analogous art of deodorant application and/or in spot treatment of textiles. Similar means for application are employed in those embodiments where the organic substance is applied after the main washing and/or conditioning steps have been performed, e.g. prior to or after ironing or drying of the cloth. For example, the organic substance may be applied using tapes, sheets or sticking plasters coated or impregnated with the substance, or containing microcapsules of the substance. The organic substance may for example be incorporated into a drier sheet so as to be activated or released during a tumble-drier cycle, or the substance can be provided in an impregnated or microcapsule-containing sheet so as to be delivered to the textile when ironed.<br>
The organic substance may comprise a preformed complex of a ligand and a transition metal. Alternatively, the organic substance may comprise a free ligand that complexes with a transition metal already present in the water or that complexes with a transition metal present in the substrate. The organic substance may also be included in the form of a composition of a free ligand or a transition metal-substitutable metal-ligand complex, and a source of transition metal, whereby the complex is formed in situ in the medium.<br>
The organic substance forms a complex with one or more transition metals, in the latter case for example as a dinuclear complex. Suitable transition metals include for example: manganese in oxidation states II-V, iron I-IV, copper I-I.U, cobalt I-III, nickel I-in, chromium II-VII, silver I-II, titanium II-IV, tungsten IV-VI, palladium II, ruthenium II-V, vanadium II-V and molybdenum Il-VI.<br>

The ligand or complex may be formed as a neutral species but it is often advantageous, for reasons of stability or ease of synthesis, to have a charged species with appropriate anion.<br>
Therefore, in an alternative fourth embodiment, the ligand of formula (E) is ion-paired with a counter ion, which ion-pairing is denoted by formula (F):<br>
[HxL]lYq<br>
wherein<br>
H is an hydrogen atom;<br>
Y is a counter anion, the type of which is dependent on the charge of the<br>
complex;	
x is an integer such that one or more nitrogen aioms in L is protonated;<br>
z represents the charge of the comp:ex and is an integer which can be positive or zero;<br>
q=z/[charge of Y]; and<br>
L is a ligand of formula (E) as defined above. \ In a further alternative fourth embodiment, '.he organic substance forms a metal complex of formula (G) based on the ion pairing of formula (F) thus:<br>
[MxL]zYq<br><br>
wherein L, Y, x, z and q are as defined for formula (F) above and M is a metal selected from manganese in oxidation states II-V, iron II-V, copper I-I1J, cobalt I-UI, nickel I-EQ, chromium II-VI, tungsten IV-VI, palladium V, ruthenium II-IV, vanadium III-IV and molybdenum IV-VI.<br>
Especially preferred are the complexes of formula (G) wherein M represents manganese, cobalt, iron or copper.<br>
In a preferred fourth embodiment, the organic substance forms a complex of the formula (H):<br><br>
z<br>
wherein M represents an iron atom in oxidation state II or III, a manganese atom in oxidation state II, III, IV or V, a copper atom in oxidation state I, II or III or a cobalt atom in oxiqation state II, III or IV, X is a group which is either a bridge or is not a bridge between iron atoms, Y is a counter ion, x and y being &gt;=1, 0=<n and z being the charge of metal complex p="z/charge" y r r2 independently one or more ring substituents selected from hydrogen electron donating withdrawing groups r3 to rj alkyl hydroxyalkyl alkenyl variants any these when substituted by groups.></n><br>
For the avoidance of doubt, "==" means "greater than or equal to".<br>
Preferably, in the complex of formula (H), M :epresents an iron atom in oxidation state II or III or a manganese atom in oxidation state H, IE, IV, or V. Preferably the oxidation state of M is III.<br>
When M is iron, preferably the complex of formula (K) is in the form of a salt of iron (inoxidised state) dihalo-2,1 l-4iazo[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane, dihalo-4~methoxy-2,l 1-diazo[3.3] (2,6) pyridinophane and mixtures thereof, especially in the form of the chloride salt.<br>
When M is manganese, preferably trie complex of formula (H) is in the form of a salt of manganese (in oxidised state) N, N'-dimethyl-2,l l-diazo[3.3](2,6)pyridfnophane, especially in the form of the monohexafluo.-ophosphate salt.<br>
Preferably, X is selected from H20, OH*, G2\ SH\ S2", S042", NR9R10\ RCOO", NR9R10RU, CI", Br", F, N3" and combinations thereof wherein R9, Rio and R| 1 are independently selected from -H, CM alkyl and aryl optionally substituted by one or more electron withdrawing and/or donating groups. More preferably, X is a halogen,<br>
u<br>
especially a fluoride ion.<br>
In the formulae (F), (G) and (H), the anionic counter ion equivalent Y is preferably selected from CI", Br", I', N03\ C104\ SOT, PF6-, RS03\ RS04", CF3SO3", BPh4*, and OAc". A cationic counter ion equivalent is preferably absent.<br>
In formula (H), R| and R2 are preferably both hydrogen. R3 and R4 are preferably CM alkyl, especially methyl. R$-R« are each preferably hydrogen.<br><br>
According to the values of x and y, the aforementioned preferred iron or manganese catalysts of formula (H) may be in the forn; of a monomer, dimer or oligomer. Without . being bound by any theory, it has been conjectured that in the raw material or detergent composition state, the catalyst exists mainly or solely in monomer form but could be converted to dimer, or even oligomeric fori a, hi the wash solution.<br>
In typical washing compositions the level of the organic substance is such that the in-use level is from luM to 50mM, with preferred in-use levels for domestic laundry operations falling in the range 10 to 100 }iM, Higher levels may be desired and applied in industrial textile bleaching processes.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous medium has a pH in the range from pH 6 to 13, more preferably from pH 6 to 11, still more preferably from pH 8 to 11, and most preferably from pH 8 to 10, in particular from pH 9 to 10.<br>
The method of the present invention has particular application in detergent bleaching, especially for laundry cleaning. Accordingly, in another preferred embodiment, the method uses the organic substance in a liquor that additionally contains a surface-active ° material, optionally together with detergency builder.<br>
The bleach liquor may for example contain a surface-active material in an amount of from 10 to 50% by weight. The surface-active material may be naturally derived, such as soap, or a synthetic material selectedjrom anionic, nonionic, amphoteric, zwitterioivc, cationic actives and mixtures thereof. Many suitable actives are commercially available and are fully described in the literature, for example in "Surface Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
Typical synthetic anionic surface-actives are usually water-soluble alkali metal salts of organic sulphates and sulphonates having alkyl groups containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, the term "alkyl" being used to include the alkyl portion of higher aryl<br><br>
groups. Examples of suitable synthetic anionic detergent compounds aie sodium and ammonium alkyl sulphates, especiaJiy those obiai.ied by sulphating higher (Cs-Cig) alcohols produced, for example, from tallow or coconut oil; sodium and ammonium alkyl (C9-C20) benzene sulphonates, particuarl;- scdium linear secondary alkyl (C10-C15) benzene sulphonates; sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates, especially those ethers of the higher alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil fatty acid monoglyceride sulphates and sulphonates; sodium and amnionium salts of sulphuric acid esters of higher (Cg-Cn) fatty alcohol alkylene oxide, particularly ethylene oxide, reaction products; the reaction products of fatty acids such as coconut fatty acids esterified with isethionic acid and neutralised with sodium hydroxide; sodium and ammonium salts of fatty acid amides of methyl taurine; alkane r.ionosulphonates such as those derived by reacting alpha-olefins (Cg-C2o) with sodium bisulphite and those derived by reacting paraffins with SO2 and CI2 and then hydroly:»ing with a base to produce a random sulphonate; sodium and ammonium (C7-C12; diulkyl sulphosuccinates; and olefin sulphonates, which term is used to describe Material made by reacting olefins, particularly (C10-C20) alpha-olefins, with SO, and then neutralising ind hydrolysing the reaction product. The preferred anionic detergent compounds are sodium (CIO-CIS) alkylbenzene sulphonates, and sodium (Ci6-Cig) alkyl ether sulphates.<br>
Examples of suitable nonionic surface-active compounds which may be used, preferably together with the anionic surface-active compounds, include, in particular, the reaction products of alkylene oxides, usually ethylene oxide, with alkyl (C6-C22) phenols, generally 5-25 EO, i.e. 5-25 units of ethylene oxides per moiecule; and the condensation products o^aliphatic (Cg-Cis) primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with -ethylene oxide, generally 2-30 EO. Other so-called nonionic surface-actives include alkyl polyglycosides, sugar esters, long-chain tertiary amine oxides, long-chain tertiary phosphine oxides and dialkyl sulphoxides.<br>
Amphoteric or zwitterionic surface-active compounds can also be used in the compositions of the invention but this is not normally desired owing to their relatively<br><br>
high cost. If any amphoteric or zwitterioni;; detergent compounds are used, it is generally in small amounts in composition: based on the much more commonly uied synthetic anionic and nonionic actives.<br>
The detergent bleach liquor will preferably comprise from 1 to 15 % wt of anionic surfactant and from 10 to 40 % by weight of nonionic surfactant.. In a further preferred embodiment, the detergent active system is free from Ci^Cn fatry acid soaps.<br>
The bleach liquor may also contains a detei gency builder, for example in an amount of from about 5 to 80 % by weight, preferably from about 10 to 60 % by weight.<br>
Builder materials may be selected from 1) calcium sequestrum" materials, 2) precipitating materials, 3) calcium ion-exchange materials and 4) mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of calcium sequestrum builder materials include alkali metal polyphosphates, such as sodium tripolyphosphate; nitrilotriacetic acid and its water-soluble salts; the alkali metal salts of carboxymethyloxy succinic acid, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid,<br><br>
oxydisuccinic acid, mellitic acid, benzene polyearboxylic acids, citric acid; and    polyacetal carboxylates as disclosed in US-.V4, i44,226 and US-A-4,146,495.<br>
Examples of precipitating builder materials include sodium orthophesphate and sodium carbonate.<br>
• Example^of calcium ion-exchange builder materials include the various rypes of water-insoluble crystalline or amorphous ahunino silicates, oC which zeolites are the best known representatives, e.g. zeolite A, zeolite B (also known as zeolite P), zeolite C, zeolite X, zeolite Y and also the zeolite P-type as described in EP-A-0,384,070.<br>
In particular, the bleach liquor may contajn any one of the organic and inorganic builder materials, though, for environmental reasons, phosphate builders are preferably omitted<br><br>
or oruy useu in very small amounts. Typical builders usable in the present invention are, for example, sodium carbonate, calcite/carl.omite, the sodium salt of nitrilotriacetic acid, sodium citrate, carboxyrnethyloxy malonat--, carboxymethyloxy succinaxe and water-insoluble crystalline or amorphous alumincsilicatc builder materials, each of which can be used as the main builder, either alone or in admixture with minor amounts of other builders or polymers as co-builder.<br>
It is preferred that the composition contains not more than 5% by weight of a carbonate builder, expressed as sodium carbonate, mere preferably not more than 2.5 % by weight to substantially nil, if the composition pH lies in the lower alkaline region of up to 10.<br>
Apart from the components already mentioned, the bleach liquor can contain any of the conventional additives in amounts of which such materials are normally employed in fabric washing detergent compositions. Examples of these additives include buffers such as carbonates, lather boosters, such as alkanoiamides, particularly die monoethanol amides derived from palmkemel fatty acids and coconut fatty acids; lather depressants, such as alkyl phosphates and silicones; anti-redeposition agents, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and alkyl or substituted aikyl cellulose ethers; stabilisers, such as phosphonic acid derivatives (i.e. Deques;® types); fabric softening agents; inorganic salts and alkaline buffering agentg, such as sodium sulphate and sodium silicate; and, usually in very small amounts, fluorescent a^enis; perfumes; enzymes, such as proteases, celluloses, lipases, amylases and oxidases; germicides and colourants.<br>
Transition metal sequestrants such as EDTA, and phosphonic acid derivatives such as EDTMP (ethylene diamine tetra(rnethylene phosphonate)) may also be included, in addition to the organic substance specified, for example to improve the stability sensitive ingredients such as enzymes, fluorescent agents and perfumes, but provided the composition remains bleach'.ng effective. However, the treatment composition containing the organic substance, is preferably substantially, and more preferably completely, devoid of transition metal'sequestrants (other than the organic substance).<br><br>
Whilst the present invention is based on the catalytic bleaching of a substrate by atmospheric oxygen or air, it will be appreciates} that small amounts of hydrogen peroxide or peroxy-based or -generating systems inay be included in the treatment composition, if desired. Preferably, however, the composition will be devoid of peroxygen bleach or peroxy-based or -generating bleach systems.<br>
The invention will now be further illustrateu by way of the following ncn-limiting examples:<br><br>
