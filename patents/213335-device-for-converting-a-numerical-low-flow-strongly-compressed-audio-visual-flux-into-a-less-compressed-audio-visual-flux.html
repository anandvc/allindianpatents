PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes   the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
16-3-2006<br>
Original <br>
16 MAR 2006<br><br>
The architectures of broadcast and reception of audio-visual numerical programs, are practically, since some years, all based on the norms of compression and of transport MPEG2 (like ISO/IEC 13818-1,for example) and DVB, thus, putting in place the initial objective of uniformity of the equipments and especially of reduction of the numerical band with (for lesser cost and more programs). This technology equips the broadcast stations and those of reception by satellite, by cable and recently for the numerical terrestrial television.<br>
A 'pure' numerical flux "would weigh" several dozens of mega bits per second as against a compressed numerical flux, according to the state of initial art, being reduced to some mega bits per second. The compression was defined more than dozens of years ago and, the most utilized for the audio visual is always the MPEG2 in "Main profile at main level" mode (MP(S&gt;ML)<br>
The materials of reception and of decoding some cases, Mpeg2 MP(5).ML compatible, like numerical receptors also known as decoders allow to de compress the video and the audio in order to play them on the television sets (after analog conversion). These materials will be named 'Receptors' in the note that follows.<br>
Unfortunately, if, today an operator would like to reduce its costs of broadcast by limiting its band with for the same quality of the programs or would like to augment the number of channels for the same band with by utilizing the new technologies of audio and video compression, it must replace all the mentioned existing receptors installed specially. In fact the mentioned receptors have all the component cables in hardware and do not support the new modes of compression.<br>
It is the same for a new regional or associate operator with lesser financial avenues, who must pay cost of the entire tariff for broadcast when for the same quality of broadcast its right of entry could be divided by 10 due to its progress of new<br>
technologies used in the domains of internet (like MPEG4, H264, Windows Media 9, etc	) In fact the PC environments, in<br>
permanent evolution are more favorable to the software evolution and same materials.<br>
A solution to this problem is, the device, according to the invention which permits to convert a numerical low flow audio visual flux and strongly compressed (for the transport needs) according to a recent method and unknown to the receptor already in place with the user, in another audio visual numerical flux less compressed but perfectly adapted (utilizing compression MPEG2, for example') to the mentioned receptor in place designed to play it.<br>
The device according to a particular mode of the invention can be detached under the form of a module to the norm DVB-CI (CENELEC EN50221) to connect in a slot PCMCIA of a receptor 'open' DVB - CI compatible. These types of open receptors are already deployed to several million units in the world.<br>
The device according to another special mode of invention can also be directly integrated in a material of reception "closed" or to the norm "open" DVB-CI under form of chip set or the additional card. The addition to the mentioned device disturbs none of the other vital functions of the receptor like the tuner, man-machine interface (MMI and OSD), access control, interactive motors, encoders PAL/SECDAM etc....and asks only for a minor integration effort.<br><br><br>
The device according to the invention can be precisely adapted to the present needs of the operators by personalizing it to the level of desired compression, but also for future since it is composed of a reserve of power machine and a supple and shrewd architecture, permitting to let it evolve by updated software for example (local or remote controlled "by the airs")<br>
By way of a non-limiting example of implementation, the mentioned device could be easily realized on the basis of a programmable DSP with Its memory and it's associated material accelerators.<br>
The device according to another particular mode of invention can contain the function of disentangling with or withouta chip card even if this is not its primary function. In all the cases, the device according to the invention must locate itself after the function of disentangling of used packets.<br>
The advantages of the invention resides in the case that one always transforms an old receptor to an evolutionary apparatus with "the best of technology" it offers, while using all the infrastructure of broadcast and of reception that is in place since a number of years, a right of acceptable entry to some new operators of broadcast or a drastic reduction of the costs to that already in operation.<br>
It no longer changes the model of operators put in place by confusion than the packets remaining transported in MPEG2 (encapsulated)<br>
Figure 1 represents a possible implementation according to the invention. The module DVB-CI (10) describes what connects it in a DVB-CI receptor is decomposed in several functional blocks.<br>
Device (10,20) for converting a numerical low flow strongly compressed audiovisual flux into a less compressed audiovisual flux comprises: extraction means (11) for extracting the "very compressed useful flux" encapsulated in the packets of transport identifiable from a flux of entering transport; decompression means (13) for decompressing the mentioned useful flux in a numerical not compressed flux; recompression means (14) for sufficiently recompressing the new numerical not compressed flux; re-encapsulation means (15) for re encapsulating the new resulting flux in some packets of transport; re-injection means (15) for reinjecting the mentioned packets in the flux of outgoing transports while taking care not to synchronize video and audio; filter means (11) for filtering and removing purely and simply certain packets audio/video of flux of transport entering initially, identified as not concerning the visualization or the hearing of the selected program in progress to put in place in the outgoing transport flux; and memory (17) to stock in temporary or permanent fashion the "very compressed" useful flux in order to replay it at the demand of the user before realizing the classical function of the numerical recorder. Device wherein the mentioned packets re-compressed, re encapsulated and re injected by multiplexing in the flux of transport returning to the mentioned receptor to the place of the packets of the flux initially used with eventually the same identifications of packets. Device wherein the mentioned packets re-compressed, re-encapsulated and re-injected by multiplexing in the flux of transport returning to the mentioned receptor while supplementing some packets of initial useful flux while also conserving the initial packets having served to generate the new flux but becoming useless, with other identifications of packets. Device wherein it realizes the function of disentangling for the useful flux before attaining its principal function of trans-compression. Device wherein it is integrated for whole or part in a detachable periphery. Device wherein it is integrated in whole or part, to an existing material in the form of component (s) or of the card(s) to connect.<br><br><br>
The synchronization of the mentioned module (10) with the mentioned receptor to which it is connected is done by its intermediary of the block C1 {(16) conforming to the norm DVB-CI.<br>
The flux completes the normal Tsin coming to the mentioned receptor, returning in the block of filter and of extraction of the used packets (11) and while resorting to multiplexing due to the identification of the mentioned packets (Identified packet" orPID.<br>
It returns next in the block of de-encapsulation (12) of the used flux.<br>
The mentioned flux is used then to return to the block of decompression audio/video (13) particular to the needs of the operator of the broadcast, that arises to more than all compressed to a very high flow (can attain 100 Mbits according to the quality)<br>
This non-compressed flux then passes through the block of re-compression MPEG2 (14) before rendering it comprehensible by the receptor MPEG2 that goes to play. One must note that the power of calculation to put in place to this re-compression cannot be very high because the new compressed flux MPEG2 must not be transported but must be used only locally. It is strongly possible to compress only the flux "I frames" and that the prediction of movement (strong consumption of power for calculation) be reduced to its bare minimum (none or small p-frames" and /or some "b-frames")<br>
As conclusion, the mentioned re-compressed flux MPEG2 is re-injected by multiplexing in the flux of the Tsout outlet, returning to the same due to the block of re-encapsulation MPEG2 (15) to the place of flux used initially (very compressed) on the same PIDs or in supplement to the initial useful flux on other pre-determined PIDs. While respecting the temporal brands and at the same time making sure not to desynchronize video and audio.<br>
The new packets MPEG2 also reconstituted will be more voluminous than those of useful initial "very compressed" flux and they thus must be injected during the periods of inactivity of flux or to the place of audio/video packets not concerning the visualization of the program in course if necessary.<br>
The figure 2 describes a particular mode of realization of another module DVB-CI (20) according to the invention. Moreover some identical functions to those described in the Figure lof the mentioned module (20) can temporarily or in the permanent fashion stock the "very compressed" flux in a cache memory (17), local or off site in order to replay it at the need of the user, before attaining the classical functions of the numerical recorder as such for example and without limitation, pause, fast forward or rewind., recording etc. all while serving some devices of command and of visualization thereby keeping at disposal the receptor to which it is connected.<br>
The monitoring by the user is rendered possible due to the standard functions of all the receptors to the DVB-CI norm. In fact such a receptor can transmit the received information from the remote to all the compatible module DVB-C:I and in particular to the mentioned module (20) by the intermediary of the block of control CI (16) and the mentioned module (20) can counter or question the user due to the posting in the MMI mode on the screen of the television connected to the mentioned receptor and monitored by the mentioned module (20) DVB CI compatible by the same channel of communication but in a contrary sense<br><br><br>
According to different modes of realization of the device according to the invention, this last, allows to convert to the shutter a low flow numerical audiovisual flux, and strongly compressed for the needs of the transport in a numerical audio visual flux less compressed to adapt it to the existing equipments charged to play. It can:<br>
•	Extract the "very compressed" used flux encapsulated in some packets of transport (MPEG2, for example) identifiable (by PID for example) from a flux of entering transport (Tsin, for example)<br>
•	Decompress the mentioned used flux in a numerical non-compressed flux. (Of bitmap type for the video, for example)<br>
•	Re-compress (in MPEG2, for example) lightly but sufficiently, the new numerical non-compressed flux.<br>
•	Re-encapsulate the new resulting flux in some packets of transport (MPEG2 for example)<br>
•	Re-inject the mentioned packets in the flux of transport leaving (Tsout for example) while respecting the temporal brands while taking care not to synchronize video and audio.<br>
•	Return the mentioned packets re-compressed re encapsulated and re-injected by the mentioned receptor multiplexing in the flux of transport to the place of initial used flux packets and with the same identifications of packets (PIDS, for example)<br>
•	Return the mentioned packets re—compressed, re-encapsula'ed and re-injected by multiplexing to the mentioned receptor of the flux of transport in supplement to the packets of useful initial flux. (Useless) with some other pre¬determined identifications of packets (PIDs for example)<br>
•	Filter and cancel, purely and simply certain audio video packets of the flux of transport entering initially, identified as not concerning the visualization or the hearing of the selected programmes running, "to make room" in the flux of the outgoing transport<br>
•	To temporarily or in a permanent fashion stock the" very compressed" useful flux in a local memory or off site (17) in order to replay it at the demand of the user before realizing the classical function of the numerical recorder.<br>
•	Realizing the function of disentangling of useful flux having to accomplish its principal function of trans-compression<br>
•	To be integrated in a detachable module in the format PCMIA compatible with the DVB-CI (CENELEC EN 50221) norm<br>
•	To be integrated to an existing material under the form of composition or the card(s) to connect<br><br><br>
