				<td>DESCRIPTION PREVENTIVE OR REMEDY FOR DISEASES CAUSED BY HYPERGLYCEMIA<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an agent for the prevention or treatment of a disease associated with hyperglycemia, comprising as an active ingredient a selective sodium-dependent glucose transporter (hereinafter referred to as SGLT) 1 inhibitor.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to an agent for the prevention or treatment of a disease associated with hyperglycemia, comprising as an active ingredient an SGLT1 inhibitor substantially showing no inhibitory effect on absorbing fructose through the small intestine, for example, an SGLT1 inhibitor substantially showing no f acilitative glucose transporter (hereinafter referred as to GLUT) 2 and/or GLUTS inhibitory effect.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, development and application of various agents for the treatment of diabetes have been progressing with the background of rapid increase of patients with diabetes and of necessity of strict blood sugar level control confirmed by large-scale clinical trials (e.g., see the following References 1-3) . For example, a-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose, miglitol and voglibose, which delay carbohydrate absorption by<br><br>
prevention of carbohydrate digestion at the small intestine, are used to improve postprandial hyperglycemia. It has been reported that blood glucose level and HbAlc were significantly improved with application of these agents to patients with type 2 diabetes (e.g., see the following References 4-6). It has<br>
been also reported that acarbose , one of a- glucosidase inhibitors , has an effect on preventing or delaying the incidence of diabetes by applying to patients with impaired glucose tolerance (e.g., see the following Reference 7).  Direct ingestion of mono-saccharide such as glucose is increased with recent change of meal carbohydrate composition. However, a-glucosidase inhibitors do not inhibit monosaccharide absorption (e.g. , see the following Reference 8) .  Therefore, it has been desired to develop agents which exert a wider range of inhibitory effect on carbohydrate absorption.<br>
It has been known that SGLT1 exists in the small intestine, which controls carbohydrate absorption. It has been also reported that glucose and galactose malabsorption arises in patients with dysfunction due to congenital abnormalities of human SGLT1 (e.g., see the following References 9-11). In addition, it has been confirmed that SGLT1 is involved in glucose and galactose absorption (e.g., see the following References 12 and 13). Furthermore, carbohydrate digestion and absorption are generally increased in diabetes . For example, in OLETF rats and rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetic symptoms, it has been confirmed that expression of SGLT1 mRNA and protein levels are increased, and absorption of glucose and the like is<br><br>
accelerated ( e . g ., see the following References 14 and 15 ).  It has been also confirmed that mRNA and protein of SGLT1 are highly increased in the human small intestine (e.g. , see the following Reference 16) . Therefore, SGLT1 inhibitors inhibit absorption of carbohydrates such as glucose at the small intestine, subsequently can prevent elevation of blood glucose level. Especially, it is considered that SGLT1 inhibitors are effective in normalizing postprandial hyperglycemia based on blocking or delaying carbohydrate absorption by the mechanism mentioned above.<br>
It has been well known phlorizin is an SGLT inhibitor. In addition, Phlorizin has been known to decrease blood glucose level by enhancement of urinary glucose excretion (e.g., see the following References 17-20). However, phlorizin orally administered does not have this effect, because of degradation<br>
by (3-glucosidase that exists in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. , see the following References 21-22).<br>
It has been known that fructose at excess dosage beyond physiological condition leads to abnormal metabolism of lipid, purine and copper (e.g., see the following Reference 23). In recent years, it has been reported that small amounts of dietary fructose prevents elevation of blood glucose level in human, dogs and rats (e.g., see the following References 24-28). It is considered that these effects are based on enhancement of glucose uptake and of glycogen accumulation, and suppression of glucose production in liver (e.g., see the following References 24, 25, 27 and 29). In detail, fructose absorbed<br><br>
through the small intestine is taken in hepatocytes and converted to fructose-1-phosphate by fructokinase, and is translocated to nucleus.  Glucokinase, which is known to decrease in patients with diabetes , exists in nucleus as inactive form complexed with the regulatory protein and fructose-6-phopsphate.  The flucotose-6-phosphate in glucokinase complex is displaced by fructose-1-phosphate. Accompany to this displacement, the glucokinase is released from the regulatory protein to become active and then translocated to the cytosol. Activated glucokinase converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Thus, accelerated utilization of glucose results in increase of hepatic glucose uptake (e.g., see the following Reference 23).  In addition, it has been reported that simultaneous administration of fructose reduced plasma insulin level in glucose tolerance tests using human and dogs (e.g. , see the following References 24 and 26) . As mentioned above, small amounts of fructose have the effect of enhancing liver glucose uptake and glycogen accumulation, and of reducing insulin level. Therefore, it is considered that it can exert various effects such as improvement of glycogen synthesis which is lowered in patients with diabetes , lowering risk of macroangiopathy and protection of exhausted pancreatic beta cells due to postprandial hyperglycemia in addition to lowering blood glucose level in patients with diabetes.<br>
An object to be solved in the present invention is to develop novel agents having a wider range of inhibitory effect on carbohydrate absorption at the small intestine, which are<br><br>
suitable for use in the prevention or treatment of a disease associated with hyperglycemia.<br>
As mentioned above, phlorizin is an agent having an inhibitory effect on SGLT, and is degraded rapidly to phloretin by|3-glucosidase that exists in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. , see the following References 30 and 31) . It has been known that phloretin inhibits GLUT (e.g. , see the following Reference 32) . Thus , in the gastrointestinal tract, phlorizin has an inhibitory effect not only on SGLT but also on GLUT. It has been also known that, in small intestinal epithelial cells, GLUTS is localized at the brush border membrane in small intestinal luminal side, and GLUT2 is localized at the basolateral membrane in capillary vessel side, and these GLUTs are involved in fructose absorption at the small intestine (e.g., see the following Reference 33) .<br>
The present invention is to provide a novel agent for the prevention or treatment comprising as an active ingredient a selective SGLT1 inhibitor, which is effective for a disease associated with hyperglycemia and can exert an effect caused by fructose ingestion.<br>

In the present invention, "selective SGLT1 inhibitor" means a medicament that the active ingredient and/or its metabolite exhibit an SGLT1 inhibitory effect substantially showing no inhibitory effect on absorbing fructose through the small intestine. As the inhibitory effect on absorbing fructose, GLUT2 inhibitory effect, GLUTS inhibitory effect and the like can be exemplified. As the selective SGLT1 inhibitor, the compounds described in Examples 1 and 2, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and hydrates thereof can be concretely exemplified.  Furthermore, the selective SGLT1 inhibitor of the present invention includes other compounds having the above-mentioned effect. Estimation of SGLT1 inhibitory effects in human and the other mammals can be performed an assay method described in the following Example 3 or analogous method thereto . Similarly, estimation of GLUT2 and GLUTS inhibitory effects can be performed assay methods described in the following References 33 and 34, or analogous method thereto.<br>
In the present invention, as the disease associated with hyperglycemia, diabetes (especially postprandial hyperglycemia), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired<br><br>
fasting glycemia (IFG), diabetic complications (e.g., cetinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, ulcer, macroangiopathy) , Dbesity, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, hyper-dholes terolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, lipid metabolism disorder, atherosclerosis, hypertension, congestive heart failure, edema, hyperuricemia, gout or the like can be exemplified.<br>
Firstly, the present inhibitors have confirmed the amount of residual fructose in the gastrointestinal tract by performing fructose tolerance test using phlorizin as a known SGLT inhibitor and the compound described in Example 2 of the present invention as an SGLT1 inhibitor. As a result, it was found that the compound of the present invention substantially show no inhibitory effect on absorbing fructose, while phlorizin significantly inhibits absorption of fructose.<br>
Next, in order to investigate whether effects caused by fructose ingestion are present, the present inventors have performed the following test using Zucker fatty fa/fa rats , model animals of type-2 diabetes. As the test drugs, acarbose and miglitol as a-glucosidase inhibitors, phlorizin as an SGLT inhibitor, and the compounds described in Examples 1 and 2 of the present invention as SGLT1 inhibitors were used.  In the fructose-containing diet group, mixed carbohydrate (starch: sucrose: lactose = 6:3:1), which corresponds approximately to carbohydrates in regular diets, was loaded, (e.g., see the following Reference 35 ). On the other hand, in the fructose-free diet group, mixed carbohydrate substituted the corresponding<br><br>
amount of starch for the amount of glucose contained within sucrose, was loaded, because sucrose is a disaccharide and is iigested to glucose and fructose in the gastrointestinal tract. Then, comparison study of each diet was performed.  As a result, after the sucrose-containing diet administration compared with the sucrose-free diet administration, while a-glucosidase inhibitors and phlorizin did not reduce plasma glucose concentration, compounds of the present invention significantly reduced plasma glucose concentration.  From these findings, it was found that a selective SGLT1 inhibitor substantially showing noGLUT2 and GLUTS inhibitory effect signif icantlyreduces plasma glucose concentration based on fructose ingestion. On the other<br>
hand, since a-glucosidase inhibitors reduced fructose absorption by inhibiting of sucrose digestion, and phloretin, which is produced by disesting phlorizin at the gastrointestinal tract, inhibited fructose absorption via its GLUT inhibition, they did not improve plasma glucose concentration at all.<br>
Basing upon the above findings, pharmaceutical compositions comprising as an active ingredient a selective SGLT1 inhibitor have the above-mentioned effect caused by fructose ingestion at regular diets in addition to a wider range of inhibitory effect on carbohydrate absorption.  Therefore, they can exhibit a marked hypoglycemic effect. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are extremely suitable as agents for the prevention or treatment of the above-mentioned various diseases associated with hyperglycemia.<br><br>
Furthermore, in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, a hypoglycemic medicament substantially showing no inhibitory effect on absorbing fructose and/or a medicament for the treatment of diabetic complications other than the selective SGLT1 inhibitor can be suitably comprised or used simultaneously or at different dosage intervals in combination thereto.  As the hypoglycemic medicament which can be comprised or used in combination with the compound of the present invention, an insulin sensitivity enhancer (e.g., pioglitazone hydrochloride, rosiglitazone maleate), an SGLT2 inhibitor, abiguanide (e.g., metforminhydrochloride, buformin hydrochloride), an insulin secretion enhancer (e.g., tolbutamide, acetohexamide, tolazamide, glyclopyramide, glybuzole, glyburide/glibenclamide, gliclazide, nateglinide, repaglinide, mitiglinide, glimepiride) , an insulin and the like can be exemplified.  In addition, as the medicament for the treatment of diabetic complications, an aldose reductase inhibitor (e.g., epalrestat), a sodium channel antagonist (mexiletine hydrochloride), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (e.g., imidapril hydrochloride, lisinopril), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (e.g., potassium losartan, irbesartan), antidiarrhoics or cathartics (e.g., polycarbophil calcium, albumin tannate, bismuth subnitrate) and the like can be exemplified.<br>
As the pharmaceutical compositions employed in the present invention, various dosage forms can be exemplified. Among them, oral pharmaceutical compositions such as tablets, powders,<br><br>
granules, tine granules, capsules, ary sirups, solutions and the like are preferable.  The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention also include sustained release formulations including gastrointestinal mucoadhesive formulations and gastric retention formulations (e.g. , see the following References 36 to 39).<br>
These pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared by admixing with or by diluting and dissolving with an appropriate pharmaceutical additive such as excipients, disintegrators, binders, lubricants, diluents, buffers, isotonicities, antiseptics, moistening agents , emulsifiers, dispersing agents , stabilizing agents , dissolving aids and the like, and formulating the mixture in accordance with conventional methods.  In case of the uses in combination with the other medicament, they can be prepared by formulating each active ingredient together or individually by analogous methods to that described above.<br>
The dosage of the selective SGLT1 inhibitor in pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention is appropriately decided depending on the sex, age, body weight and degree of symptoms and treatment of each patient. For example, dosages of the compounds described in Examples 1 and 2 are approximately within the range of from 0.1 to l,000mg per day per adult human in the case of oral administration, and the daily dose can be divided into one to several doses per day and administered suitably. Also, in case uses in combination with the other medicament, the dosage of the compound of the present invention can be decreased, depending on the dosage of the other<br><br>
medicament<br>

Assay for inhibitory effects on rat SGLTl activity<br>
1} Cloning and construction of the vector expressing rat SGLTl<br>
Using rat kidney cDNA library (QUICK-Cline™ cDNA ; Clontech) as template, the DNA fragment coding 111 to 2203 bp of rat SGLTl (ACCESSION : M16101), which was reported by Kasahara et al. , was amplified by PCR method and inserted into the SrfI site of pCMV-Script (Stratagene). The DNA sequence inserted was perfectly matched to the previously reported sequence on the amino acids level. 2) Establishment of cell line stably expressing rat SGLTl<br>
The expression vector of rat SGLTl was digested with Mlul into a linear DNA. The linear DNA was transfected into CHO-K1 cells by means of lipofection (Superfect Transfection Reagent: QIAGEN) . Neomycin resistant cell lines were selected by culture in the medium containing G418 (1 mg/mL, LIFE TECHNOLOGIES) , and<br>
then the activity against the uptake of methyl-a-D-gluco-pyranoside was measured by the method described below. The cell line, which showed the greatest uptake activity, was selected<br>
•<br>
and designated as CrSl. CrSl cells were cultured in the presence<br><br>
of G418 at 200<br>
3) Measurement of the inhibitory activity against the uptake<br>
of methyl-a-D-glucopyranoside (a-MG)<br>
CrSl cells were seeded into a 96-well culture plate at a density of 3 x lo4 cells/well and cultured in the presence of G418 at 200 p.g/mL for 2 days, and were used in the uptake assay. A mixture of non-labeled (Sigma) and 14C-labeled a-MG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the uptake buffer (pH 7.4; containing 140 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 rnM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 10 mM 2- [ 4- ( 2-hydroxyethyl) -1-piperazinyl]ethane sulf onic acid, and 5 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) at the final concentration of 1 mM. A test compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulf oxide, and then appropriately diluted with distilled water. The test compound solution was added to the uptake buffer containing 1 mM a-MG, and designated as a measurement buffer. For the control group, the measurement buffer without any test compound was prepared. For measuring the basal uptake, a basal uptake measurement buff er, which contains 140 mM chorine chloride instead of sodium chloride, was prepared. After removing the culture medium of CrSl cells , 180 \iL of the pre-treatment buffer (the basal uptake buffer without a-MG) was added to each well and incubated at 37" C for 10 minutes. After repeating the same treatment, the pre-treatment buffer was removed. To each well<br>
was added 75 (J.L of the measurement buffer or the basal uptake buffer was added and incubated at 37° C for 1 hour. After removing<br>
the measurement buffer, cells were washed twice with 180 ^L per<br><br>
well of the washing buffer (the basal uptake buffer containing 10 mM non-labeled cx-MG) . The cells were solubilized by 75 |o.L per well of 0. 2 mol/L sodium hydroxide. The cell lysates were transferred into PicoPlates (Packard), and then added 150 ^.L of MicroScint-40 (Packard) and mixed. Radioactivity was measured by means of micro-scintillation counter TopCount (Packard) . One hundred % was set to the difference between the uptake in the control group and the basal uptake, and the uptake of methyl a-D-glucopyranoside at each drug concentration were calculated. The drug concentration, at which 50% uptake of methyl a-D-glucopyranoside was inhibited (IC50 value), was calculated using logit plot. The results are shown in Table 1. [Table 1] Test Example 1 (Table Remove)<br>
Effects of an SGLT1 inhibitor on absorption of fructose<br>
The male Wistar rats (aged 8 weeks old) were orally administered a compound of Example 2 (0.3 mg/kg) or phlorizin (40, 100 mg/kg).  Immediately after the administration , 0.2g/kg of fructose was loaded. After 30 minutes, rats were sacrificed with exsanguination under ether anesthesia and then the contents<br>
of stomach and small intestine were collected with 10 mL ice-cold saline. Fructose concentration was measured by fructose assay kit (D-glucose / D-Fructose; Roche diagnostics) and calculated residual fructose (% of dose) in the gastrointestinal tract. Statistical analysis between control and treated groups are calculated using T test. The results are shown in Table 2. In the Table, ** and *** are showed significantly difference at P
 Test Example 2<br>
Effects of SGLT1 inhibitors, an SGLT inhibitor and a-glucosidase inhibitors after mixed-carbohydrate containing sucrose loading.<br>
After overnight fasting, the male Zucker fa/fa rats (aged 15-17 weeks old) were orally administered an SGLT1 inhibitor (the compound of Example 1, 0.5 mg/kg; the compound of Example 2, 0.3 mg/kg), a-glucosidase inhibitor (acarbose: 5 mg/kg, miglitol: 5 mg/kg) or an SGLT inhibitor (phlorizin, 100 mg/kg) . Immediately after the compound administration, mixed-carbohydrate with sucrose (starch : sucrose : lactose =6:3:<br>
1) or without sucrose (starch : lactose = 7.5 : 1) was loaded at a dose of 1.6 g glucose/kg. The blood was collected immediately before and after the administration with the time course (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 hours). The plasma was collected to quantify the plasma glucose concentration. The area under the curve of plasma glucose concentration from 0 to 3 hours was calculated by the trapezoidal method. Statistical analysis was T test between existence and nonexistence of sucrose in mixed-carbohydrate solution on each compound. The results are shown in Figure 1.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprising as an active ingredient a selective SGLT1 inhibitor have the above-mentioned effect caused by fructose ingestion at regular diets in addition to a wider range of inhibitory effect on carbohydrate absorption. Therefore, they can exhibit a marked hypoglycemic effect. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions are extremely suitable as agents for the prevention or treatment of the above-mentioned various diseases associated with hyperglycemia.<br><br>
