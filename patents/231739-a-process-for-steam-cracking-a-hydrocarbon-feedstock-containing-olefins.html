				<td>A PROCESS FOR STEAM CRACKING A HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCK<br>
CONTAINING OLEFINS<br>
The present invention relates to a process for steam cracking a hydrocarbon feedstock to<br>
produce an effluent containing light olefins, in particular propylene. In particular, olefinic<br>
feedstocks from refineries or petrochemical plants can be converted selectively so as to<br>
redistribute the olefin content of the feedstock in the resultant effluent.<br>
The use of steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks is well known in the art. For the<br>
production of an effluent containing propylene, it is known to steam crack a feedstock<br>
comprising a straight run (SR) naphtha, which contains substantially no olefins but straight<br>
chain and isoparaffins. However, the propylene yield is quite low, and the ratio of propylene<br>
to ethylene (the lower oletins) is also quite low.<br>
There is a need in the art to increase the production of propylene using such a steam cracker.<br>
It is also known to crack catalytically an olefin-containing feedstock using a crystalline silicate<br>
catalyst, for example from WO-A-99/29802.<br>
It is further known to use a crystalline silicate cracking catalyst to produce light olefins such<br>
as ethylene. For example, WO-A-98/56877 discloses a process for improving the conversion<br>
of a light hydrocarbon feedstock to light olefins comprising the steps of first contacting the<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock with a light olefin producing cracking catalyst, such as a ZSM-5<br>
zeolite, and subsequently thermally cracking the unseparated stream to produce additional<br>
ethylene.<br>
There is a need for a high yield propylene production method which can readily be integrated<br>
into a refinery or petrochemical plant, taking advantage of feedstocks that are less valuable for<br>
the market place (having few alternatives on the market), and which can increase the<br>
propylene production from the steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for steam cracking olefi<br><br>
feedstocks present in refineries and petrochemical plants which has a high conversion of<br>

high propylene yield and purity.<br>

having a stable olefinic conversion and a stable product distribution over time.<br>

feedstocks having a high yield on an olefin basis towards propylene, irrespective of the origin<br>
and composition of the olefinic feedstock.<br>

The various aspects of the present invention will now be described in greater detail however<br>
by example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a process scheme in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention<br>
for processing refinery and/or petrochemical feedstocks, the process scheme incorporating a<br>
reactor for selectively catalytically cracking olefins into lighter olefins over a crystalline<br>
silicate catalyst and a downstream steam cracker; and<br>
Figures 2 to 5 show the relationship between the propylene/ethylene weight ratio and<br>
feedstock and temperature for various Examples of the present invention and Comparative<br>
Examples.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, catalytic cracking of olefins is<br>
performed in the sense that olefins in a hydrocarbon stream are cracked into lighter olefins and<br>
selectively into propylene. The feedstock and effluent preferably have substantially the same<br>
olefin content by weight. Typically, the olefin content of the effluent is within±15wt%, more<br>
preferably ±lOwt%, of the olefin content of the feedstock. The feedstock may comprise any<br>
kind of olefin-containing hydrocarbon stream. The feedstock may typically comprise from 10<br>
to 100wt% olefins and furthermore may be fed undiluted or diluted by a diluent, the diluent<br>
optionally including a non-olefinic hydrocarbon. In particular, the olefin-containing feedstock<br>
may be a hydrocarbon mixture containing normal and branched olefins in the carbon range G4<br>
to C10, more preferably in the carbon range C4 to C6, optionally in a mixture with normal and<br>
branched paraffins and/or aromatics in the carbon range C4 to C10. Typically, the olefin-<br>
containing stream has a boiling point of from around -15 to around 180°C.<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments of the present invention, the hydrocarbon feedstocks<br>
comprise C4 mixtures from refineries and steam cracking units. Such steam cracking units<br>
crack a wide variety of feedstocks, including ethane, propane, butane, naphtha, gas oil, fuel<br>
oil, etc. Most particularly, the hydrocarbon feedstock may comprises a C4 cut from a<br>
fluidized-bed catalytic cracking (FCC) unit in a crude oil refinery which is employed for<br>
converting heavy oil into gasoline and lighter products. Typically, such a C4 cut from an FCC<br>
unit comprises around 50wt% olefin. Alternatively, the hydrocarbon feedstock may comprise<br>
a C4 cut from a unit within a crude oil refinery for producing methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)<br>
which is prepared from methanol and isobutene. Again, such a C4 cut from the MTBE unit<br><br>
typically comprises around 50wt% olefin. These C4 cuts are fractionated at the outlet of the<br>
respective FCC or MTBE unit. The hydrocarbon feedstock may yet further comprise a C4 cut<br>
from a naphtha steam-cracking unit of a petrochemical plant in which naphtha, comprising C5<br>
to C9 species having a boiling point range of from about 15 to 180°C, is steam cracked to<br>
produce, inter alia, a C4 cut. Such a C4 cut typically comprises, by weight, 40 to 50% 1,3-<br>
butadiene, around 25% isobutylene, around 15% butene (in the form of but-1-ene and/or but-<br>
2-ene) and around 10% n-butane and/or isobutane. The olefin-containing hydrocarbon<br>
feedstock may also comprise a C4 cut from a steam cracking unit after butadiene extraction<br>
(raffinate 1), or after butadiene hydrogenation, thereby comprising a hydrotreated C4 stream<br>
(known in the art as a "hydrotreated raw C4" stream), or a raw C4 feedstock,or a raffinate 2<br>
feedstock from an MTBE or an ethyl tert-butyl ether(ETBE) unit, or a raffinate from an<br>
olefins metathesis unit.<br>
The feedstock may yet further alternatively comprise a hydrogenated butadiene-rich C4 cut,<br>
typically containing greater than 50wt% C4 as an olefin. Alternatively, the hydrocarbon<br>
feedstock could comprise a pure olefin feedstock which has been produced in a petrochemical<br>
plant.<br>
The olefin-containing feedstock may yet further alternatively comprise light cracked naphtha<br>
(LCN) (otherwise known as light catalytic cracked spirit (LCCS)) or a C5 cut from a steam<br>
cracker or light cracked naphtha, the light cracked naphtha being fractionated from the<br>
effluent of the FCC unit, discussed hereinabove, in a crude oil refinery. Both such feedstocks<br>
contain olefins. The olefin-containing feedstock may yet further alternatively comprise a<br>
medium cracked naphtha from such an FCC unit or visbroken naphtha obtained from a<br>
visbreaking unit for treating the residue of a vacuum distillation unit in a crude oil refinery or<br>
a coker naphtha. The olefin-containing feedstock may alternatively comprise a raffinate 2<br>
feedstock, containing olefins but having a high isoparaffin content.<br>
The olefin-containing feedstock may comprise a mixture of one or more of the above-<br>
described feedstocks.<br><br>
The use of a C5 cut as or in the olefin-containing hydrocarbon feedstock has particular<br>
advantages because of the need to remove C5 species in any event from gasolines produced by<br>
the oil refinery. This is because the presence of C5 in gasoline increases the ozone potential<br>
and thus the photochemical activity of the resulting gasoline. In the case of the use of light<br>
cracked naphtha as the olefin-containing feedstock, the olefin content of the remaining<br>
gasoline fraction is reduced, thereby reducing the vapour pressure and also the photochemical<br>
activity of the gasoline.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the process of the invention, olefinic feedstocks can<br>
be cracked selectively in the presence of an MFI-type or MEL-type catalyst so as to<br>
redistribute the olefinic content of the feedstock in the resultant effluent. The catalyst and<br>
process conditions are selected whereby the process has a particular yield on an olefin basis<br>
towards a specified olefin in the feedstocks. Typically, the catalyst and process conditions are<br>
chosen whereby the process has the same high yield on an olefin basis towards propylene<br>
irrespective of the origin of the olefinic feedstocks for example the C4 cut from the FCC unit,<br>
the C4 cut from the MTBE unit, the light cracked naphtha or the C5 cut from the light crack<br>
naphtha, etc. The propylene yield on an olefin basis is typically from 30 to 50% based on the<br>
olefin content of the feedstock. The yield on an olefin basis of a particular olefin is defined as<br>
the weight of that olefin in the effluent divided by the initial total olefin content by weight.<br>
For example, for a feedstock with 50wt% olefin, if the effluent contains 20wt% propylene, the<br>
propylene yield on an olefin basis is 40%. This may be contrasted with the actual yield for a<br>
product which is defined as the weight amount of the product produced divided by the weight<br>
amount of the feed. The paraffins and the aromatics contained in the feedstock are only<br>
slightly converted in accordance with the preferred aspects of the invention.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the present invention, the catalyst for the cracking of<br>
the olefins comprises a crystalline silicate of the MFI family which may be a zeolite, a<br>
silicalite or any other silicate in that family or the MEL family which may be a zeolite or any<br>
other silicate in that family. The three-letter designations "MFI" and "MEL" each represent a<br>
particular crystalline silicate structure type as established by the Structure Commission of the<br>
International Zeolite Association. Examples of MFI silicates are ZSM-5 and silicalite. An<br><br>
example of an MEL zeolite is ZSM-11 which is known in the art. Other examples are Boralite<br>
D, and silicalite-2 as described by the International Zeolite Association (Atlas of zeolite<br>
structure types, 1987, Butterworths).<br>
The preferred crystalline silicates have pores or channels defined by ten oxygen rings and a<br>
high silicon/aluminium atomic ratio.<br>
Crystalline silicates are microporous crystalline inorganic polymers based on a framework of<br>
XO4 tetrahedra linked to each other by sharing of oxygenions, where X may be trivalent (e.g.<br>
A1,B,...) or tetravalent (e.g. Ge, Si,..). The crystal structure of a crystalline silicate is defined<br>
by the specific order in which a network of tetrahedral units are linked together. The size of<br>
the crystalline silicate pore openings is determined by the number of tetrahedral units, or,<br>
alternatively, oxygen atoms, required to form the pores and the nature of the cations that are<br>
present in the pores. They possess a unique combination of the following properties: high<br>
internal surface area; uniform pores with one or more discrete sizes; ion exchangeability; good<br>
thermal stability; and ability to adsorb organic compounds. Since the pores of these<br>
crystalline silicates are similar in size to many organic molecules of practical interest, they<br>
control the ingress and egress of reactants and products, resulting in particular selectivity in<br>
catalytic reactions. Crystalline silicates with the MFI structure possess a bi-directional<br>
intersecting pore system with the following pore diameters: a straight channel along [010]:<br>
0.53-0.56nm and a sinusoidal channel along [100]: 0.51-0.55nm. Crystalline silicates with the<br>
MEL structure possess a bi-directional intersecting straight pore system with straight channels<br>
along [100] having pore diameters of 0.53-0.54 nm.<br>
The crystalline silicate catalyst has structural and chemical properties and is employed under<br>
particular reaction conditions whereby the catalytic cracking readily proceeds. Different<br>
reaction pathways can occur on the catalyst. Under the process conditions, having an inlet<br>
temperature of around 500 to 600°C, preferably from 520 to 600°C, yet more preferably 540<br>
to 580°C, and an olefin partial pressure of from 0.1 to 2 bars, most preferably around<br>
atmospheric pressure, the shift of the double bond of an olefin in the feedstock is readily<br>
achieved, leading to double bond iscmerisation. Furthermore, such isomerisation tends to<br><br>
reach a thermodynamic equilibrium. Propylene can be, for example, directly produced by the<br>
catalytic cracking of hexene or a heavier olefinic feedstock. Olefinic catalytic cracking may<br>
be understood to comprise a process yielding shorter molecules via bond breakage.<br>
The catalyst preferably has a high silicon/aluminium atomic ratio, whereby the catalyst has<br>
relatively low acidity. In this specification, the term "silicon/aluminium atomic ratio" is<br>
intended to mean the Si/Al atomic ratio of the overall material, which may be determined by<br>
chemical analysis. In particular, for crystalline silicate materials, the stated Si/Al ratios apply<br>
not just to the Si/Al framework of the crystalline silicate but rather to the whole material.<br>
Hydrogen transfer reactions are directly related to the strength and density of the acid sites on<br>
the catalyst, and such reactions are preferably suppressed so as to avoid the formation of coke<br>
during the olefin conversion process, and composition of the olefinic feedstock. Such high<br>
ratios reduce the acidity of the catalyst, thereby increasing the stability of the catalyst.<br>
Moreover, the use of high Si/Al atomic ratios has been found to increase the propylene<br>
selectivity of the catalyst, i.e. to reduce the amount of propane produced. This increases the<br>
purity of the resultant propylene.<br>
In accordance with one aspect, a first type of MFI catalyst has a high silicon/aluminum atomic<br>
ratio, e.g. at least about 180, preferably greater than about 200, more preferably greater than<br>
about 300, whereby the catalyst has relatively low acidity. Hydrogen transfer reactions are<br>
directly related to the strength and density of the acid sites on the catalyst, and such reactions<br>
are preferably suppressed so as to avoid the formation of coke during the olefin conversion<br>
process, which in turn would otherwise decrease the stability of the catalyst over time. Such<br>
hydrogen transfer reactions tend to produce saturates such as paraffins, intermediate unstable<br>
dienes and cyclo-olefins, and aromatics, none of which favours cracking into light olefins.<br>
Cyclo-olefins are precursors of aromatics and coke-like molecules, especially in the presence<br>
of solid acids, i.e. an acidic solid catalyst. The acidity ofthe catalyst can be determined by the<br>
amount of residual ammonia on the catalyst following contact of the catalyst with ammonia<br>
which adsorbs to the acid sites on the catalyst with subsequent ammonium desorption at<br>
elevated temperature measured by differential thermogravimetric analysis. Preferably, the<br><br>
silicon/aluminum ratio ranges from 180 to 1000, most preferably from 300 to 500.<br>
With such high silicon/aluminum ratio in the crystalline silicate catalyst, a stable olefin<br>
conversion can be achieved with a high propylene yield on an olefin basis of from 30 to 50%<br>
whatever the origin and composition of the oleflnic feedstock. Such high ratios reduce the<br>
acidity of the catalyst, thereby increasing the stability of the catalyst.<br>
The MFI catalyst having a high silicon/aluminum atomic ratio for use in the catalytic cracking<br>
process of the present invention may be manufactured by removing aluminum from a<br>
commercially available crystalline silicate. A typical commercially available silicalite has a<br>
silicon/aluminum atomic ratio of around 120. The commercially available MFI crystalline<br>
silicate may be modified by a steaming process which reduces the tetrahedral aluminum in the<br>
crystalline silicate framework and. converts the aluminum atoms into octahedral aluminum in<br>
the form of amorphous alumina. Although in the steaming step aluminum atoms are<br>
chemically removed from the crystalline silicate framework structure to form alumina<br>
particles, those particles cause partial obstruction of the pores or channels in the framework.<br>
This inhibits the oleflnic cracking processes of the present invention. Accordingly, following<br>
the steaming step, the crystalline silicate is subjected to an extraction step wherein amorphous<br>
alumina is removed from the pores and the micropore volume is, at least partially, recovered.<br>
The physical removal, by a leaching step, of the amorphous alumina from the pores by the<br>
formation of a water-soluble aluminum complex yields the overall effect of dealumination of<br>
the MFI crystalline silicate. In this way by removing aluminum from the MFI crystalline<br>
silicate framework and then removing alumina formed therefrom from the pores, the process<br>
aims at achieving a substantially homogeneous dealumination throughout the whole pore<br>
surfaces of the catalyst. This reduces the acidity of the catalyst, and thereby reduces the<br>
occurrence of hydrogen transfer reactions in the cracking process. The reduction of acidity<br>
ideally occurs substantially homogeneously throughout the pores defined in the crystalline<br>
silicate framework. This is because in the olefin cracking process hydrocarbon species can<br>
enter deeply into the prose. Accordingly, the reduction of acidity and thus the reduction in<br>
hydrogen transfer reactions which would reduce the stability of the MFI catalyst are pursued<br>
throughout the whole pore structure in the framework. The framework silicon/aluminum<br><br>
ratio may be increased by this process to a value of at least about 180, preferably from about<br>
180 to 1000, more preferably at least 200, yet more preferably at least 300, and most<br>
preferably around 480.<br>
In accordance with another aspect, a second type of MFI catalyst has a high silicon/aluminium<br>
atomic ratio, greater than about 300, whereby the catalyst has relatively low acidity and the<br>
catalyst has not been steamed or dealuminated as described hereinabove.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect, an MEL catalyst for use in the catalytic cracking process<br>
may be manufactured by steaming an as-synthesised or commercially available crystalline<br>
silicate. The MEL crystalline silicate catalyst for use in the invention most typically comprises<br>
a ZSM-11 catalyst which may be synthesized either using diaminooctane as the templating<br>
agent and sodium silicate as the silicon source or tetrabutyl phosphonium bromide as the<br>
templating agent and a silica sol as the silicon source. Thus the ZSM-11 catalyst may be<br>
prepared by mixing sodium silicate with 1,8 diaminooctane together with aluminium sulphate<br>
to form a hydrogel which is then allowed to crystallise to form the crystalline silicate. The<br>
organic template material is then removed by calcining. Alternatively, the ZSM-11 catalyst is<br>
produced by reacting tetrabutyl phosphonium bromide and sodium hydroxide together with<br>
the silica sol prepared from colloidal silica. Again, a crystallisation is performed to produce<br>
the crystalline silicate and then the product is calcined.<br>
In order to reduce the sodium content of the MEL crystalline silicate, the crystalline silicate is<br>
subjected to an ion exchange with a salt. Thereafter the material is dried. Typically, the<br>
crystalline silicate is subjected to ion exchange with ammonium ions, for example by<br>
"immersing the crystalline silicate in an aqueous solution of NH4CI or NH4NO3. Such an ion<br>
exchange step is desirable if the amount of sodium ions present in the crystalline silicate is so<br>
high that a crystalline sodium silicate phase is formed following calcination of the crystalline<br>
silicate which would be difficult to remove.<br>
The initial MEL crystalline silicate may be modified by a steaming process which, without<br>
being bound by theory, is believed to reduce the tetrahedral aluminium in the crystalline<br><br>
silicate framework and to convert the aluminium atoms into octahedral aluminium in the form<br>
of amorphous alumina. Although in the steaming step aluminium atoms are chemically<br>
removed from the MEL crystalline silicate framework structure to form alumina particles,<br>
those particles appear not to migrate and so do not cause partial obstruction of the pores or<br>
channels in the framework which would otherwise inhibit the olefinic cracking processes of<br>
the present invention. The steaming step has been found to improve significantly the<br>
propylene yield, propylene selectivity and catalyst stability in the olefinic catalytic cracking<br>
process.<br>
The steam treatment on the MEL catalyst is conducted at elevated temperature, preferably in<br>
the range of from 425 to 870°C, more preferably in the range of from 540 to 815°C and at<br>
atmospheric pressure and at a water partial pressure of from 13 to 200kPa. Preferably, the<br>
steam treatment is conducted in an atmosphere comprising from 5 to 100% steam. The steam<br>
treatment is preferably carried out for a period of from 1 to 200 hours, more preferably from<br>
20 hours to 100 hours. As stated above, the steam treatment tends to reduce the amount of<br>
tetrahedral aluminium in the crystalline silicate framework, by forming alumina.<br>
Following the steaming step, the MEL catalyst is thereafter calcined, for example at a<br>
temperature of from 400 to 800°C at atmospheric pressure for a period of from 1 to 10 hours.<br>
Following the steaming step, the MEL catalyst may be contacted by a complexing agent for<br>
aluminium which may comprise an organic acid in an aqueous solution thereof or a salt of<br>
such an organic acid or a mixture of two or more such acids or salts. The complexing agent<br>
may in particular comprise an amine, such as ethyl diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) or a salt<br>
thereof, in particular the sodium sult thereof. Following the contacting of the MEL crystalline<br>
silicate by the complexing agent the crystalline silicate may be subjected to a second ion<br>
exchange step for reducing the sodium content of the crystalline silicate still further, for<br>
example by contacting the catalyst with an ammonium nitrate solution.<br>
The MEL or MFI crystalline silicate catalyst may be mixed with a binder, preferably an<br>
inorganic binder, and shaped to a desired shape, e.g. extruded pellets. The binder is selected<br><br>
so as to be resistant to the temperature and other conditions employed in the catalyst<br>
manufacturing process and in the subsequent catalytic cracking process for the olefins. The<br>
binder is an inorganic material selected from clays, silica, metal oxides such as Zr02 and/or<br>
metals, or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. The binder is preferably<br>
alumina-free. If the binder which is used in conjunction with the crystalline silicate is itself<br>
catalytically active, this may alter the conversion and/or the selectivity of the catalyst. Inactive<br>
materials for the binder may suitably serve as diluents to control the amount of conversion so<br>
that products can be obtained economically and orderly without employing other means for<br>
controlling the reaction rate. It is desirable to provide a catalyst having a good crush strength.<br>
This is because in commercial use, it is desirable to prevent the catalyst from breaking down<br>
into powder-like materials. Such clay or oxide binders have been employed normally only for<br>
the purpose of improving the crush strength of the catalyst. A particularly preferred binder for<br>
the catalyst of the present invention comprises silica.<br>
The relative proportions of the finely divided crystalline silicate material and the inorganic<br>
oxide matrix of the binder can vary widely. Typically, the binder content ranges from 5 to<br>
95% by weight, more typically from 20 to 50% by weight, based on the weight of the<br>
composite catalyst. Such a mikture of crystalline silicate and an inorganic oxide binder is<br>
referred to as a formulated crystalline silicate.<br>
In mixing the catalyst with a binder, the catalyst may be formulated into pellets, extruded into<br>
other shapes, or formed into a spray-dried powder.<br>
Typically, the binder and the crystalline silicate catalyst are mixed together by an extrusion<br>
process. In such a process, the binder, for example silica, in the form of a gel is mixed with<br>
the crystalline silicate catalyst material and the resultant mixture is extruded into the desired<br>
shape, for example pellets. The reafter, the formulated crystalline silicate is calcined in air or<br>
an inert gas, typically at a temperature of from 200 to 900°C for a period of from 1 to 48<br>
hours.<br>
The binder preferably does not contain any aluminium compounds, such as alumina. This is<br><br>
because as mentioned above the preferred catalyst has a selected silicon/aluminium ratio of<br>
the crystalline silicate. The presence of alumina in the binder yields other excess alumina if<br>
the binding step is performed prior to the aluminium extraction step. If the aluminium-<br>
containing binder is mixed with the crystalline silicate catalyst following aluminium<br>
extraction, this re-aluminates the catalyst. The presence of aluminium in the binder would<br>
tend to reduce the olefin selectivity of the catalyst, and to reduce the stability of the catalyst<br>
over time.<br>
In addition, the mixing of the catalyst with the binder may be carried out either before or after<br>
any steaming step.<br>
The various preferred catalysts have been found to exhibit high stability, in particular being<br>
capable of giving a stable propylene yield over several days, e.g. up to ten days. This enables<br>
the olefin cracking process to be performed continuously in two parallel "swing" reactors<br>
wherein when one reactor is operating, the other reactor is undergoing catalyst regeneration.<br>
The catalyst also can be regenerated several times. The catalyst is also flexible in that it can<br>
be employed to crack a variety of feedstocks, either pure or mixtures, coming from different<br>
sources in the oil refinery or petrochemical plant and having different compositions.<br>
In the process for catalytic cracking of olefins when dienes are present in the olefln-containing<br>
feedstock, this can provoke a faster deactivation of the catalyst. This can greatly decrease the<br>
yield on an olefin basis of the catalyst to produce the desired olefin, for example propylene,<br>
with increasing time on stream. When dienes are present in the feedstock which is<br>
catalytically cracked, this can yield a gum derived from the diene being formed on the catalyst<br>
which in turn decreases the catalyst activity. It is desired for the catalyst to have a stable<br>
activity over time, typically for at least ten days.<br>
In accordance with this aspect, prior to the catalytic cracking of the olefins, if the olefin-<br>
containing feedstock contains dienes, the feedstock is subjected to a selective hydrogenation<br>
process in order to remove the dienes. The hydrogenation process requires to be controlled in<br>
order to avoid the saturation of the mono-olefins. The hydrogenation process preferably<br><br>
comprises nickel-based or palladium-based catalysts or other catalysts which are typically<br>
used for first stage pyrolysis gasoline (Pygas) hydrogenation. When such nickel-based<br>
catalysts are used with a C4 cut, a significant conversion of the mono-olefins into paraffins by<br>
hydrogenation cannot be avoided. Accordingly, such palladium-based catalysts, which are<br>
more selective to diene hydrogenation, are more suitable for use with the C4 cut.<br>
A particularly preferred catalyst is a palladium-based catalyst, supported on, for example,<br>
alumina and containing 0.2-0.8wt% palladium based on the weight of the catalyst. The<br>
hydrogenation process is preferably carried out at an absolute pressure of from 5 to 50 bar,<br>
more preferably from 10 to 30 barand at an inlet temperature of from 40 to 200°C. Typically,<br>
the hydrogen/diene weight ratio is at least 1, more preferably from 1 to 5, most preferably<br>
around 3. Preferably, the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) is at least 2h-1, more preferably<br>
from 2 to 5h-1.<br>
The dienes in the feedstock are preferably removed so as to provide a maximum diene content<br>
in the feedstock of around 0.1% by weight, preferably around 0.05% by weight, more<br>
preferably around 0.03% by weight.<br>
In the catalytic cracking process, the process conditions are selected in order to provide high<br>
selectivity towards propylene, a stable olefin conversion over time, and a stable olefinic<br>
product distribution in the effluent. Such objectives are favoured by the use of a low acid<br>
density in the catalyst (i.e. a high Si/Al atomic ratio) in conjunction with a low pressure, a<br>
high inlet temperature and a short contact time, all of which process parameters are<br>
interrelated and provide an overall cumulative effect (e.g. a higher pressure may be offset or<br>
compensated by a yet higher inlet temperature). The process conditions are selected to<br>
disfavour hydrogen transfer reactions leading to the formation of paraffins, aromatics and<br>
coke precursors. The process operating conditions thus employ a high space velocity, a low<br>
pressure and a high reaction temperature. The LHSV ranges from 5 to 30h-1, preferably from<br>
10 to 30h-1. The olefin partial pressure ranges from 0.1 to 2 bars, preferably from 0.5 to 1.5<br>
bars. A particularly preferred olefin partial pressure is atmospheric pressure (i.e. 1 bar). The<br>
hydrocarbon feedstocks are preferably fed at a total inlet pressure sufficient to convey the<br><br>
feedstocks through the reactor. The hydrocarbon feedstocks may be fed undiluted or diluted<br>
in an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen. Preferably, the total absolute pressure in the reactor ranges from<br>
0.5 to 10 bars. The use of a low olefin partial pressure, for example atmospheric pressure,<br>
tends to lower the incidence of hydrogen transfer reactions in the cracking process, which in<br>
turn reduces the potential for coke formation which tends to reduce catalyst stability. The<br>
cracking of the olefins is preferably performed at an inlet temperature of the feedstock of from<br>
500 to 600°C, more preferably from 520 to 600°C, yet more preferably from 540 to 580°C,<br>
typically around 560°C to 570°C.<br>
The catalytic cracking process can be performed in a fixed bed reactor, a moving bed reactor<br>
or a fluidized bed reactor. A typical fluid bed reactor is one of the FCC type used for<br>
fluidized-bed catalytic cracking in the oil refinery. A typical moving bed reactor is of the<br>
continuous catalytic reforming type. As described above, the process may be performed<br>
continuously using a pair of parallel "swing" fixed bed reactors.<br>
Since the catalyst exhibits high stability to olefinic conversion for an extended period,<br>
typically at least around ten days, the frequency of regeneration of the catalyst is low. More<br>
particularly, the catalyst may accordingly have a lifetime which exceeds one year.<br>
For example, olefin-rich streams from refinery or petrochemical plants are cracked into light<br>
olefins, in particular propylene. The light fractions of the effluent, namely the C2 and C3 cuts,<br>
can contain more than 92% olefins. Such cuts are sufficiently pure to constitute chemical<br>
grade olefin feedstocks. The propylene yield on an olefin basis in such a process can range<br>
from 30 to 50% based on the olefinic content of the feedstock which contains one or more<br>
olefins of C4 or greater. In the process, the effluent has a different olefin distribution as<br>
compared to that of the feedstock, but substantially the same total olefin content.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a process scheme incorporating a reactor for cracking an<br>
olefin-rich hydrocarbon feedstock which is selective towards light olefins in the effluent. The<br>
process scheme may integrate such a reactor into an oil refinery.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 1, the process scheme includes a reactor 2 for selectively catalytically<br>
cracking an olefin-rich hydrocarbon feedstock to form light olefins, such as propylene. The<br>
reactor 2 is typically a fixed bed reactor, and contains as a catalyst a crystalline silicate of the<br>
MFI or MEL type as described hereinabove. The reactor 2 is also operated under the<br>
temperature, flow rate and pressure conditions as described herein for the selective catalytic<br>
cracking process. The reactor 2 is fed along an input 4 with one or more of a variety of olefin-<br>
rich hydrocarbon feedstocks derived from a petrochemical plant and/or derived from an oil<br>
refinery.<br>
The petrochemical feedstocks which are fed along input 4 may particularly comprise at least<br>
one of a hydrotreated raw C4 feedstock, LCCS, a raffinate 2 feedstock, araffinate 1 feedstock,<br>
a raffinate 2 feedstock from a methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) or an ethyl tert-butyl ether<br>
(ETBE) unit, a raffinate from an olefins metathesis unit, in particular for the production of<br>
propylene from ethylene and butene, or a hydrotreated olefin-containing stream from an FCC<br>
unit, a visbreaker or a delayed coker.<br>
The selective catalytic cracking process in. the reactor 2, as well as cracking the feedstock<br>
olefins into lighter olefins, in particular propylene, can also desulphurise the incoming<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock by decomposition (or cracking) of any mercaptans (which may be<br>
present as impurities in an FCC feedstock) into valuable olefins and hydrogen sulphide. The<br>
hydrogen sulphide is subsequently removed in the reactor 2 or from the effluent by techniques<br>
known in the art. The use of an MFI-type crystalline silicate such as silicalite which is not<br>
highly sensitive to poisoning by heteroatoms such as sulphur in combination with this<br>
desulphurisation process enables the provision of a smaller sweetening unit (not shown), or<br>
the provision of a sweetening unit operating under reduced load, than would otherwise be<br>
required for treating an FCC feed stock containing sulphur as an impurity. Thus the use of the<br>
reactor for selective catalytic cracking of the olefin-containing hydrocarbon feedstock<br>
additionally desulphurises the incoming C4+ FCC effluent thereby reducing the capital and<br>
operating costs of the known sweetening unit for FCC effluents.<br>
The effluent from the reactor 2 is outputted along a line 6 to a first (de-C3) fractionator 8 in<br><br>
which the effluent is fractionated into a C2/C3 overhead fraction outputted along line 10 and a<br>
C4+ bottom fraction outputted along line 12. The C2/C3 fraction, including a high proportion<br>
of propylene, is fed to a second xactionator 14 via a common input line 16 therefor.<br>
The C4+ fraction outputted on line 12 from the first fractionator is fed via an input 18 to a<br>
steam cracker 20.<br>
The steam cracker 20 is of a construction generally known in the art which comprises a<br>
plurality of heating coils, in a plurality of furnaces of the steam cracker, over which the<br>
feedstock is passed, together with steam. The feedstock is heated, prior to introduction into<br>
the steam cracker 20, to a temperature, known as the inlet radiation temperature, which<br>
typically ranges from 535 to 620 °C, most typically being about 600°C. In the steam cracker<br>
20, the temperature of the coils, known as the coil outlet temperature, is typically from 760 to<br>
860°C, most typically about 78C °C. The coil inlet pressure for the steam cracker typically<br>
ranges from 2 to 4 bara, most typically from 2.6 to 2.9 bara, and the coil outlet pressure is<br>
most typically from 2 to 3 bara, most typically about 2.15 bara. The steam is introduced into<br>
the steam cracker in a weight ratio with respect to the total hydrocarbon feed to the steam<br>
cracker of from 0.1 steam: 1 hydrocarbon feedstock, most typically about 0.35 steam: 1<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock on a weight basis. The throughput of the steam cracker 20 used in the<br>
invention is typically about 14 tonnes of hydrocarbon feedstock per hour.<br>
In accordance with the illustrated embodiment of the invention, but not essential to the<br>
method of the invention, the hydrocarbon feedstock supplied to the steam cracker 20 also<br>
includes a second hydrocarbon feedstock fraction, which may typically comprise a straight run<br>
naphtha, which is fed along a lino 22 via a plurality of parallel inputs 24,26,28 into the steam<br>
cracker 20. Accordingly, the composite feedstock for the steam cracker 20 comprises the C4+<br>
fraction fed on input 18 together with the feedstock fed on inputs 24,26 and 28.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect, the respective hydrocarbon feedstocks on inputs 18,24,<br>
26 and 28 are steam cracked in respective furnaces of a common steam cracker 20. Thus,<br>
preferably, each feedstock is steam cracked in dedicated furnace(s) of the steam cracker 20.<br><br>
In particular, it is desired that the olefins are cracked at low severity (temperature) whereas<br>
naphthas are preferably cracked at higher severity (temperature).<br>
When the hydrocarbon feedstock fed on line 22 comprises a straight run naphtha, the straight<br>
run naphtha typically comprises C5-C9 straight and/or isoparaffins with substantially no<br>
olefinic content, but however paraffins of C9+ may additionally be present.<br>
The effluent from the steam cracker 20 is outputted along an output 30 which is fed into the<br>
common input 16 for the second fractionator 14. The second fractionator 14 commonly<br>
fractionates both combined effluents on lines 10 and 30 respectively, and the output of the<br>
second fractionator 14 comprises individual fractions of C2, C3, etc. which are recovered.<br>
The recovered C3 fraction has a high proportion, typically greater than 94wt%, propylene.<br>
This comprises chemical-grade propylene which may be used in subsequent processes as a<br>
starting feedstock, for example in the production of polypropylene.<br>
In accordance with the present invention therefore, olefinic feedstocks are subject to a<br>
catalytic cracking process which selectively catalytically cracks the olefins in the feedstock<br>
and thereafter, the effluent is separated into a C2- and C3- combined product that is recovered<br>
in a common fractionation train, and into C4+ products which are routed to a dedicated steam<br>
cracking furnace, with the effluent from the steam cracking furnace thereafter being sent to the<br>
common fractionation train. The steam cracker may optionally be fed with additional<br>
hydrocarbon feedstocks which substantially do not comprise olefins, such as for example a<br>
straight run naphtha.<br>
It has been found in accordance with the present invention that the use of an olefin cracking<br>
step as a feed pre-treatment for the steam cracking of olefinic feedstocks allows the<br>
propylene/ethylene ratio in the steam cracking effluent to be shifted to values higher than the<br>
normal ranges observed when a straight run naphtha is subject to steam cracking. In an<br>
existing steam cracking plant the throughput of the steam cracking furnace has a maximum<br>
value, and thus the present invention provides the advantage that, without increasing the<br><br>
maximum throughput permitted by the steam cracker, the increase of the propylene yield<br>
using the steam cracker may be dramatically increased by changing the feedstocks for the<br>
steam cracker and in particular by using definic cracking as a pre-treatment for at least part of<br>
the steam cracking, with additional pre-fractionation of the effluent from the olefinic cracking<br>
process so as to remove propylene and ethylene primarily from the feedstock for the steam<br>
cracker. Some existing petrochemical plants currently generate a raw C4 hydrocarbon stream<br>
containing olefins which often need to be recycled. The process of the present invention<br>
enables such raw C4 hydrocarbon streams containing olefins to be incorporated into the steam<br>
cracking scheme so as to provide valuable effluents.<br>
With regard to the operation of the steam cracker, it has been found that the optimum for<br>
propylene production in the steam cracker, measured by the propylene/ethylene weight ratio,<br>
tends to occur when the steam cracker is operated at low severity, typically at a temperature of<br>
from 760 to 860 °C, most typically about 780°C. It has also been found that when the steam<br>
cracker is operated at such low severity, the steam cracker is subjected to reduced coking of<br>
the coils, i.e. reduced progressive build up of carbon deposits on the coils, which is in turn<br>
favourable for longer runs of the ovens between shutdown and overhaul.<br>
The present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the flowing<br>
non-limiting Examples.<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 4<br>
These Comparative Examples were computer simulated using the SPYRO simulation<br>
software known in the art, in which a straight run naphtha having a simulated composition<br>
was subjected to simulated steam cracking in a steam cracker.<br>
In Comparative Example 1, the simulated composition shown in Table 1 (NPAR, DPAR, NAP<br>
and ARO respectively represent N-paraffins, isoparaffins, naphthenes and aromatics) was<br>
steam cracked in a steam cracker having a coil outlet temperature of 780°C, and an inlet<br>
radiation temperature of 535°C, a throughput of 14.2 tonnes per hour, a steam dilution of 0.35<br><br>
kg of steam per kg of hydrogen feedstock, a coil inlet pressure of 2.67 bara and a coil outlet<br>
pressure of 2.15 bara. The residence time was 515 milliseconds. The duty of the cracker was<br>
9.6 megawatts. For an inlet flow rate of 14200 kg per hour, the effluent included 2872 kg per<br>
hour ethylene and 2520 kg per hour propylene, yielding a propylene/ethylene weight ratio of<br>
0.878.<br>
In Comparative Examples 2 to 4, the same naphtha feedstock was similarly subjected to<br>
simulated steam cracking at coil outlet temperatures of 800,820 and 840°C respectively using<br>
a constant steam cracker feed rate (14.2 tonnes per hour).<br>
In Comparative Example 2, the simulated conditions were modified to have a coil inlet<br>
pressure of 2.69 bara. The residence time was 500 milliseconds. The duty of the cracker was<br>
10.5 megawatts. For an inlet flow rate of 14200 kg per hour, the effluent included 3312 kg<br>
per hour ethylene and 2571 kg per hour propylene, yielding a propylene/ethylene weight ratio<br>
of 0.776.<br>
In Comparative Example 3, the simulated conditions were modified to have a coil inlet<br>
pressure of 2.71 bara. The residences time was 487 milliseconds. The duty of the cracker<br>
was 11.3 megawatts. For an inlet flow rate of 14200 kg per hour, the effluent included 3693<br>
kg per hour ethylene and 2486 kg per hour propylene, yielding a propylene/ethylene weight<br>
ratio of 0.673.<br>
In Comparative Example 4, the simulated conditions were modified to have a coil inlet<br>
pressure of 2.72 bara. The residence time was 477 milliseconds. The duty of the cracker<br>
wasl2.0 megawatts. For an inlet flow rate of 14200 kg per hour, the effluent included 4007<br>
kg per hour ethylene and 2281 kg per hour propylene, yielding a propylene/ethylene weight<br>
ratio of 0.569.<br>
It may be seen from these Comparative Examples that the propylene/ethylene weight ratio for<br>
the steam cracking of the straight run naphtha is a maximum of 0.878 at 780°C, and this<br>
decreases with increasing coil outlet temperatures. These results are shown in Figure 2.<br><br>
Comparative Examples 5 to 8<br>
In these Comparative Examples, an LCCS having the simulated composition shown in Table<br>
2 was subjected to simulated steam cracking at coil outlet temperatures of 780, 800, 820 and<br>
840°C under the conditions summarised below and the propylene/ethylene weight ratio of the<br>
effluent at constant steam cracker feed rate are also summarised in Figure 2.<br>
In Comparative Example 5, the simulated composition shown in Table 2 was steam cracked in<br>
a steam cracker having a coil outlet temperature of 780°C, and an inlet radiation temperature<br>
of535°C, a throughput of 14.2 to ones per hour, a steam dilution of 0.35 kg of steam per kg of<br>
hydrogen feedstock, a coil inlet pressure of 2.64 bara and a coil outlet pressure of 2.15 bara.<br>
The residence time was 540 milli seconds. The duty of the cracker was 7.7 megawatts. For an<br>
inlet flow rate of 14200 kg per ho ur, the effluent included 1874 kg per hour ethylene and 1952<br>
kg per hour propylene, yielding a propylene/ethylene weight ratio of 1.041.<br>
In Comparative Examples 6 to 8, the same LCCS feedstock was similarly subjected to<br>
simulated steam cracking at coil outlet temperatures of 800,820 and 840°C respectively using<br>
a constant steam cracker feed rale (14.2 tonnes per hour).<br>
In Comparative Example 6, the simulated conditions were modified to have a coil inlet<br>
pressure of 2.66 bara. The residence time was 527 milliseconds. The duty of the cracker was<br>
8.3 megawatts. For an inlet flow rate of 14200 kg per hour, the effluent included 2135 kg per<br>
hour ethylene and 1940 kg per hour propylene, yielding a propylene/ethylene weight ratio of<br>
0.908.<br>
In Comparative Example 7, the simulated conditions were modified to have a coil inlet<br>
pressure of 2.67 bara. The residence time was 516 milliseconds. The duty of the cracker<br>
was8.8 megawatts. For an inlet flow rate of 14200 kg per hour, the effluent included 2376 kg<br>
per hour ethylene and 1841 kg per hour propylene, yielding a propylene/ethylene weight ratio<br>
of 0.775.<br><br>
In Comparative Example 8, the simulated conditions were modified to have a coil inlet<br>

cracker having a coil outlet temperature of 780°C, and an inlet radiation temperature of 535°C,<br><br>
a throughput of 14.2 tonnes per hour, a steam dilution of 0.35 kg of steam per kg of hydrogen<br>

In Example 1 the build up of coke on the coils on the steam cracker was estimated as part of<br>
the simulation. In the Spyro simulation model the coil in the furnace is shaped as a W and has<br>
four coil positions where coke measurements can be made or estimated. The calculated values<br>
were 0.4 equivalent mm per month for coil position 1,0.5 equivalent mm per month for coil<br>
position 2,0.7 equivalent mm per month for coil position 3 and 0.8 equivalent mm per month<br>
for coil position 4. In contrast, for Example 2 the corresponding coking values were 0.5,0.6,<br><br>
0.9 and 1.2 equivalent mm per month, for Example 3 the corresponding coking values were<br>
0.6, 0.7, 1.1 and 1.6 equivalent mm per month and for Example 4 the corresponding coking<br>
values were 0.7, 0.9, 1.4 and 2.1 equivalent mm per month.<br>
These values show that there is reduced coking when the steam cracker is operated at a low<br>
severity, in particular at about 780°C.<br>
Examples 5 to 8<br>
In these Examples, which are modifications to Examples 1 to 4, the simulated LCCS was<br>

C2 in the effluent to produce the composition of Table 6 and then followed by simulated steam<br>
cracking under substantially the same conditions as for the corresponding Examples 1 to 4.<br>
The feed rate was 14.2 tonnes per hour for the steam cracker and an initial inlet feed rate for<br>
the olefinic catalytic cracker was 16938.9 kg/hour, since the C3/C2 overhead fraction from the<br>
fractionator bypassed the steam cracker<br>
For Example 5 the propylene/ethylene weight ratio was 1.802 for the composite effluent to be<br>
sent to the combined fractior ator.<br>
For Examples 6,7 and 8, the corresponding propylene/ethylene weight ratios in the composite<br>
effluent were 1.608, 1.428 and 1.262.<br>
The total propylene/ethylene weight ratio results for each temperature are summarised in<br>
Figure 3.<br>
As for Examples 1 to 4 the build up of coke on the coils on the steam cracker was estimated<br>
and the corresponding values were for Example 5 0.0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 equivalent mm per<br>
month, for Example 6 the corresponding coking values were 0.0,0.2,0.4 and 0.6 equivalent<br>
mm per month, for Example 7 the corresponding coking values were 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 and 1.0<br><br>
equivalent mm per month and for Example 8 the corresponding coking values were 0.1, 0.4,<br>
0.8 and 1.5 equivalent mm per month.<br>

severity, in particular at about 7 80°C.<br>

The feed rate was 14.2 tonnes per hour for the steam cracker and an initial inlet feed rate for<br>
the olefinic catalytic cracker was 19192.9 kg/hour, since the C3/C2 overhead fraction from the<br>

In these Examples, the simulated hydrotreated raw C4 hydrocarbon feedstock of Comparative<br>
Examples 13 to 16 was initially subjected to a simulated olefin catalytic cracking process so as<br>
to produce a simulated effluent therefrom having the composition shown in Table 9. This<br>
effluent was then subjected to simulated steam cracking at the four temperatures of 780,800,<br>
820 and 840°C under the conditions summarised below to yield respective propylene/ethylene<br>
weight ratios of 2.080, 1.671,1.316 and 1.007.<br>
In Example 17, the simulated composition shown in Table 9 was steam cracked in a steam<br>
cracker having a coil outlet temperature of 780°C, and an inlet radiation temperature of 535°C,<br>

hydrocarbon feedstock was similarly subjected to simulated steam cracking at coil outlet<br>
temperatures of 800, 820 and 840°C respectively using a constant steam cracker feed rate<br>
(14.2 tonnes per hour).<br>
In Example 18, the simulated conditions were modified to have a coil inlet pressure of 2.69<br>
bara. The residence time was 475 milliseconds. The duty of the cracker was 5.4 megawatts.<br>
For an inlet flow rate of 14200 kg per hour, the effluent included 2170 kg per hour ethylene<br>

These Examples also showed reduced coking when the steam cracker was operated at low<br>
severity.<br>
Examples 21 to 24<br>
In these Examples, which are modifications to Examples 17 to 20, the simulated hydrotreated<br>
raw C4 hydrocarbon feedstock was initially subjected to simulated olefinic catalytic cracking<br>
to produce the composition of Table 9 and then additionally subjected to simulated<br>
fractionation from the effluent of C3 and C2 in the effluent to produce the composition of<br>
Table 10 and then followed by simulated steam cracking under substantially the same<br>
conditions as for the corresponding Examples 17 to 20. The feed rate was 14.2 tonnes per<br>
hour for the steam cracker and ar an initial inlet feed rate for the olefinic catalytic cracker was<br>
22775 kg/hour, since the C3/C2 overhead fraction from the fractionator bypassed the steam<br>
cracker.<br>
For Example 21 the propylene/ethylene weight ratio was 3.166 for the composite effluent to<br>
be sent to the combined fractionator.<br>

Figure 3.<br>
These Examples also showed reduced coking when the steam cracker was operated at low<br>
severity.<br>
Comparative Examples 17 to 32<br>
In these Comparative Examples, the straight run naphtha, LCCS, raffinate 2 and hydrotreated<br>
raw C4 feedstocks employed in the earlier Comparative Examples were subjected to steam<br>
cracking at a coil outlet temperature of 780, 800,820 and 840°C with the steam cracker being<br>
operated not at constant steam cracker feed rate, as in the earlier Comparative Examples, but<br>
rather at constant steam cracker furnace duty. For the simulations, the furnace geometry was<br>
kept unchanged and the coil pressure drop increased accordingly, while the residence time<br>
decreased. The simulation therefore needs to be considered as "maximum" case and would<br>
be likely to require a modification, in known manner, of the furnace and coils assembly in an<br>
actual furnace. The results of the propylene/ethylene weight ratios for these Comparative<br>
Examples are summarised in Figure 4.<br>
Examples 25 to 40<br>
For these Examples, the furnace was, like for Comparative Examples 17 to 32, operated at<br>
constant furnace duty and as for Examples 5 to 8,13 to 16 and 21 to 24 an initial feedstock,<br>
comprising LCCS, raffinate 2 or nydrotreated raw C4 respectively, was subjected to simulated<br>
catalytic cracking, fractionation to remove the C3/C2 overhead, then steam cracking, and then<br>
combination of the steam cracked effluent with the C2/C3 overhead, and with the steam<br>
cracking having been carried out at constant furnace duty at 780, 800, 820 or 840°C. The<br>
resultant total propylene/ethylene weight ratios for the combined effluent are summarised in<br>
Figure 5.<br>
Examples 41 and 42<br><br>
In these examples, the conditions and feedstocks for the catalytic cracker were the same as for<br>
Examples 5 and 13 respectively, but the steam cracker was fed with the unfractionated<br>
effluent from the catalytic cracker and was also supplied with a straight run naphtha. The<br>
weight ratio of effluent from the, catalytic cracker: straight run naphtha was 15:85 for each<br>
example. The composition of each composite feedstock for the steam cracker in each<br>
example is shown in Tables 11 and 12.<br>
Using steam cracking conditions substantially the same as for the corresponding Examples 5<br>
and 13 respectively, the propylene/ethylene weight ratio in the final effluent was 0.937 for<br>
Example 41 and 0.972 for Example 42. These values are higher than the corresponding<br>
values for Example 1 when just straight run naphtha was steam cracked. This shows that<br>
when a steam cracker is used to crack a straight run naphtha, in order to increase the<br>
production of propylene, and in particular, in order to increase the propylene/ethylene weight<br>
ratio in the effluent, a proportion of the naphtha feed may be replaced with an olefin<br>
containing feed such as the effluent from a catalytic cracker for cracking the olefins in a<br>
feedstock such as LCCS or raffinate 2. The composite feedstock for the steam cracker may<br>
comprise from 5 to 95 wt %, most typically about 15 wt% of the olefin containing feed and<br>
from 95 to 5 wt %, most typically about 85 wt% of the straight run naphtha feed.<br>
Examples 43 to 48<br>
For Examples 43, 44 and 45, Example 41 was repeated but at 800, 820 and 840°C to yield<br>
propylene/ethylene weight ratios in the final effluent of 0.821,0.707 and 0.594 respectively.<br>
For Examples 46, 47 and 48, Example 42 was repeated but at 800, 820 and 840°C to yield<br>
propylene/ethylene weight ratios in the final effluent of 0.851,0.733 and 0.616 respectively.<br>
Again, these values are higher than the corresponding values for Example 1 when just straight<br>
run naphtha was steam cracked.<br>
It may be seen from a comparison of the Examples and Comparative Examples that the use of<br>
an olefin catalytic cracking process as a pre-treatment for a feedstock for a steam cracker for<br>
producing an olefin-containing effluent results in a greater propylene/ethylene weight ratio as<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

14.	A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 13, wherein the steam cracking of the<br>
second hydrocarbon feedstock is performed in the steam cracker at an outlet coil<br>
temperature of from 760 to 860°C<br>
15.	A process as claimed in claim 14 wherein the outlet coil temperature is<br>
being 780°C.<br><br>
There is disclosed a process for steam cracking a hydrocarbon feedstok<br>
containing olefins to provide increased light olefins in the steam cracked<br>
effluent, the process comprising passing a first hydrocarbon feedstock containing<br>
one or more olefins through a catalytic cracking reactor containing a crystalline<br>
silicate to produce an intermediate elfluent with an olefin content of lower<br>
molecular weight than that of the feedstock, fractionating the intermediate<br>
effluent to provide a lower carbon fraction and a higher carbon fraction, and<br>
passing the higher carbon fraction, as a second hydrocarbon feedstock, through a<br>
steam cracker to produce a steam cracked effluent<br></td>
