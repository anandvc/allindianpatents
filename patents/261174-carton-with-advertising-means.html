				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a carton for containing a plurality of articles and in<br>
particular to a carton which is provided with a shaped panel to increase the<br>
advertising effect of the carton.<br>
It is known to provide carton having apertures shaped to accommodate the articles<br>
they are intended to contain, GB 2346602 to Grimes and GB 1481559 to Von Nell<br>
and Jaekel are examples of this.<br>
Cartons for packaging multiple articles, such as beverage or food containers are often<br>
formed from high-grade paperboard and have graphic printable surfaces, which are<br>
necessary for providing cartons with advertising printed on the carton. When using<br>
cartons constructed from a minimum amount of material the surface area available<br>
for printing such graphics may be reduced. Similarly, if low-grade paperboard<br>
material is used to construct a carton, the outer surfaces of the carton may not be<br>
printable with graphic or the quality may be poor. It is therefore desirable to provide<br>
a carton having other means of incorporating advertising and marketing material.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a carton for<br>
containing a plurality of articles, such as yoghurt pots, the carton comprising a<br>
plurality of main panels for forming the carton top, side and bottom walls, the carton<br>
further comprising a shaped panel struck from at least one of said carton walls, the<br>
shaped panel being defined in part by a first aperture struck from the one carton wall<br>
and in part by an end edge of the one carton wall wherein the shaped panel provides<br>
means for enhancing the visual impact of the carton upon an observer.<br>
Preferably, the first aperture is struck entirely from a side wall of the carton and is<br>
defined in part by a substantially vertical straight edge extending between the top<br>
wall and the bottom wall, which substantially vertical straight edge provides a frame<br>
of reference against which a user can discern the shaped panel.<br>
Preferably, the end edge of the one carton wall is contoured to define a first edge of<br>
the shaped panel.<br>
2<br><br>
Preferably, first aperture is defined in part by a contoured edge which defines a<br>
second edge of the shaped panel.<br>
Preferably, the shaped panel is shaped similarly to an outline of an article to be<br>
contained within the carton to emulate a feature of that article on said one carton<br>
wall.<br>
Preferably, the shaped panel contains/displays a graphical representation of an object<br>
and at least part of an outline of the object is defined by one or both of the first<br>
aperture and the cut line.<br>
Preferably, the first aperture and said end edge are spaced from each other and do not<br>
intersect such that the shaped panel remains integral with said one wall.<br>
Preferably, the shaped panel is shaped to enhance the visual impact upon the<br>
observer of a message to be displayed upon the carton.<br>
Preferably, the message to be displayed may be indicative of a quality of the contents<br>
of the carton said quality for example being a health benefit provided by the contents.<br>
Preferably, the shaped panel is shaped to enhance a trademark or trade name<br>
displayed upon the carton.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention is illustrated Figure 1. Figure 1<br>
illustrates a panel 10 which may form a main panel of a carton, such as a side panel<br>
of a wraparound carton. Figure 6 illustrates a wraparound carton 450 comprising the<br>
main panel 10 of the fifth embodiment shown in Figure 5, the main panel 10 forms<br>
the side panel of the wraparound carton 450. The main panel 10 is vertically elongate<br>
as viewed in Figure. 1 and is formed of paperboard or other foldable sheet material<br>
such as a plastic sheet or the like. In the embodiments shown in figures 1-6 the main<br>
panel 10 is designed to form part of a carton 450 for packaging articles such as pots<br>
of foodstuff (e.g., yoghurt; pudding; processed fruits, vegetables or meet; etc.),<br>
beverage containers (e.g., cans, bottles, bricks, cups, glasses, etc.), wrapped or<br>
packaged dried leaves (e.g., tea bags, cigars, cigarettes, etc.), wrapped candies or the<br>
like.<br>
Figure 6 shows a carton 450 containing sixteen articles C which are arranged in two<br>
tiers each tier comprising a 2x4 array of 8 yoghurt pots. It is however envisaged that<br>
other articles and/or different numbers of articles in different arrangements may be<br>
contained within the carton 450 and that the blank may therefore be sized<br>
accordingly. Furthermore, the wraparound carton 450 is shown by way of example<br>
only to illustrate the type of carton in which the main panels 10, 110, 210, 310, 410<br>
of the illustrated embodiments may be incorporated.<br>
The main panel 10 will now be described in detail with specific reference to Figure<br>
1. The other embodiments of the present invention, illustrated in Figures 2-6, each<br>
contain similar features to those of the first embodiment. Such features are depicted<br>
by similar reference numerals in the figures, but for ease of understanding the<br>
4<br><br>
reference numerals in subsequent embodiments have been raised by a factor of 100,<br>
200, 300 or 400.<br>
Main panel 10 may form a complete carton wall or may only form part of a<br>
composite carton wall, when incorporated in a set up carton (such as that shown in<br>
Figure 6). Main panel 10 comprises an upper edge 28 and a lower edge 30. It is<br>
envisaged that in setup carton the upper and lower edges 28, 30 may be defined by a<br>
hinged connection between the main panel 10 and a top wall and a bottom wall of the<br>
carton respectively such that the main panel 10 provides a side wall of the carton.<br>
This is illustrated in Figure 6 where main panel 410, shown in Figure 5, forms a side<br>
wall of a wraparound carton 450 and the main panel 410 is hingedly connected<br>
between a top wall 428 and a bottom wall 430. The other side wall 429 of the carton<br>
450 hingedly connected between the top and bottom walls 428, 430. As a result, the<br>
walls 410, 428, 429, 430 form the carton 450 of a tubular structure.<br>
Returning to the main panel 10 of Figure 1, a shaped panel 18 is formed from the<br>
main panel 10, the remainder of which panel is denoted as a graphic portion 16. In<br>
Figure 1, it can be seen that the shaped panel 18 is formed from the main panel 10,<br>
and the outline of the shaped panel 18 is defined in part by an aperture 20 and in part<br>
by an end edge 26 of the main panel 10. The other opposed end edge of the main<br>
panel 10 is designated by reference numeral "27". The graphic portion of the main<br>
panel 10 is defined between the aperture 20 and the other end edge 27 of the main<br>
panel 10. The first aperture 20 comprises a substantially vertical straight edge 22<br>
which extends along a notional line between the top side edge 28 of the graphic<br>
portion 16 and the bottom side edge 30. This vertical straight edge 22 serves to<br>
define a frame of reference against which an observer can distinguish the shape of<br>
the shaped panel 18.<br>
The first aperture 20 is also defined by a first contoured edge 24, which edge 24 also<br>
defines an edge of the shaped panel 18. In this embodiment the shaped panel 18 has<br>
an outline shape which represents a cartoon character's head, such as a monkey or<br>
dinosaur. The shaped panel 18 is further defined by a second contoured edge<br>
provided by the end edge 26, which edge 26 is also shaped to depict a portion of the<br>
5<br><br>
character's head. The shaped panel 18 remains integral with the graphic portion 16 by<br>
the spacing and separation between the cut edge 26 and the aperture 20.<br>
It can be seen by referring to Figures 1 -6 that the shaped panel is formed solely from<br>
one panel forming part of the carton. In the embodiments shown this is the side wall,<br>
however in alternative embodiments this may be the top, bottom or end panel.<br>
Turning now to Figure 2, 4, 5 and 6 it can be seen that the end edge 126, 326, 426<br>
and the aperture 120, 320, 420 both extend substantially between the top and the<br>
bottom walls of a setup carton.<br>
In Figure 3 it can be appreciated that the contoured edge 244 defines an edge of a<br>
second aperture 240 struck form the main panel 210.<br>
Figure 4 shows that the end edge 326 and the aperture 320 in combination define a<br>
shaped panel shaped to represent a downwardly pointing arrow. The shaped panel 18<br>
is formed having a symmetrical shape.<br>
It will further be appreciated that removal of portion of the main panel 10 to define<br>
the shaped panel 18 has the effect of exposing to view at least part of the contents of<br>
the carton 450. The location of the aperture and the contoured end edges may be<br>
selected so as to expose a specific portion of the carton contents so as to cooperate<br>
with the message enhancing quality of the shaped panel 18.<br>
The shaped panel 18 forms a shaped panel which may serve to enhance the visual<br>
impact of the carton upon a potential purchaser. The shaped panel may highlight or<br>
enhance or otherwise represent a message which it is desired to be conveyed to the<br>
purchaser. For example the message may be that the contents of the package have<br>
some health benefit such as weight control, cholesterol reduction, immune system<br>
enhancement or intestinal health benefit. Such a message may be printed on or<br>
otherwise carried by one or more of the articles to be packaged in the carton of the<br>
invention or by the graphic portion or other portion (including the top, bottom and<br>
side walls) of the carton of the invention. Alternatively the shaped panel may be<br>
shaped to enhance a trademark, trade name or a cartoon image to be printed or<br>
otherwise displayed on one or more of the articles or on the graphic portion or other<br>
portion of the carton.<br>
6<br><br>
It will be appreciated that any of the embodiments shown in Figures 1-5 may form<br>
part of a carton as shown in Figure 6. Turning to the construction of the carton 450<br>
from a blank (not shown), a series of sequential folding and gluing operations are<br>
required, which preferably can be performed in a straight line machine, so that the<br>
carton 450 and/or blank are not required to be rotated or inverted to complete the<br>
construction. The folding process is not limited to that described below and can be<br>
altered according to particular manufacturing requirements. It is envisaged that the<br>
carton 450 will be formed around a group of articles C. However in cartons other<br>
than the wraparound carton 450 shown in Figure 6 the carton may be formed into a<br>
tubular structure prior to loading of the articles C.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention it is envisaged that other articles may be<br>
contained within the carton and that the invention is not limited to a carton, or a<br>
blank for forming a carton, for containing yoghurt pots arranged in two tiers or 2x4<br>
arrays. Accordingly alterations may be made to accommodate other articles.<br>
It can be appreciated that various changes may be made without departing from the<br>
scope of the present invention, for example, the size and shape of the panels may be<br>
adjusted to accommodate articles of differing size or shape. The shaped panel may be<br>
shaped according to a variety of user requirements. Other variations may also be<br>
made within the scope of the invention.<br>
It will be recognised that as used herein, directional references such as "top",<br>
"bottom", "front", "back", "end", "side", "inner", "outer", "upper" and "lower" do not<br>
limit the respective panels to such orientation, but merely serve to distinguish these<br>
panels from one another. Any reference to hinged connection should not be<br>
construed as necessarily referring to a single fold line only; indeed it is envisaged<br>
that hinged connection can be formed from one or more of the following, a score<br>
line, a frangible line or a fold line without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
