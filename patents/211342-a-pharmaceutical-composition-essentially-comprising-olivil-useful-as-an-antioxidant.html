				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the isolation of compound namely (-)-Olivil from a new plant^sgurce,<br>
Stereospermum Personatum in good yield. It is provedjoJbe useful and better antioxidant<br>
molecule than the presently used medicinally important lipophilic antioxidante_.PrubucpJLand a-<br>
Tocopherol. It may have better therapeutic potential in inflammatory disease conditions,<br>
atherosclerosis, diabetic complications, cancer, hepatotoxicity and variety of disease conditions^<br>
mediated through or fostered by oxidative stress and / or overt oxidative burden due to<br>
increased generation or under scavenging of free radicals.<br>
Background and prior art references<br>
There is a considerable amount of epidemiological evidence indicating association between diet<br>
rich in fruits and vegetables and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and certain forms of<br>
cancer. It is generally assumed that the active principles contributing to these protective effects are<br>
nothing but primarily, the antioxidant phytochemicals.<br>
Research in the past decades have accumulated enough evidence to show the beneficial effect<br>
of free-radical scanvengers/antioxidants as antimutagenic, antinflammatory, antiamerosclerotic,<br>
antidiabetic, antihepatotoxic, antiageing and in a variety of neurological disorders. The search<br>
for new antioxidant principles is becoming therefore, essential to improve the pharmacological<br>
treatment of pathalogical conditions related either due to free radical / oxidative damage or due<br>
to imbalance between antioxidant/oxidant homeostasis such as cataract, rheumatic diseases,<br>
atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenarative conditions.<br>
The pharmacological approaches therefore have focused on the search of potential resources<br>
rich in antioxidant principles. The medicinal importance of plants bearing rich proportion of<br>
antioxidant principles is therefore becoming hot item.<br>
Stereospermum personatum is a medicinal plant used in traditional Indian System of Medicine<br>
and is widely advocated in the preparations for diuretic, lithontriptic, expectorant, cardiotonic,<br>
aphrodisiac, appetizer, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, dyspepsia, diarrhea, renal and vesical calculi,<br>
cough, asthma, hyperdipsia, haemorrhoids and hyperacidity disease conditions( Indian<br>
Medicinal Plants, Vol 5 p 192). It is further reported to possess antibacterial antifungal,<br>
hypoglycaemic activity, and against p388 lymphocytic leukemic cells (Ind. Jour, of Exp. Biol.,<br>
1971,9, 100). Hence, it becomes pertinent to look for the molecules possessing such important<br>
biological properties. In this connection, the phytochemical investigation of Stereospermum<br>
personatum has been taken up. The applicants made efforts to the isolation of (-)-Olivill in<br>
good yield<br>
(-)-Olivil is known to possess several activities, which are shown in Table. 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a novel composition containing (-)-Olivil and an<br>
additive, which is used as an antioxidant.<br>
Another object is to provide a new source for obtaining (-)-Olivil in good yield.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for producing (-)-Olivil from a plant<br>
source namely Stereospermum personatum.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is relates to use of(-)-OIivil as an antioxidant.<br>
Summary of Invention:<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a novel composition containing (-)-Olivil and useful as<br>
antioxidant. The invention further provides a method for the isolation of (-)-Olivil from a new<br>
plant source namely Stereospermum Personation.<br>
In accordance with this invention, it has been found that (-)-Olivil is isolated from a new<br>
source, Stereospermum Personatum in significant yield and it has been found that (-)-Olivil<br>
show antioxidant property.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
Antioxidant compounds recently have attracted the attention due to their broad spectrum of<br>
activities in disorders of multiple origin viz., coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes,<br>
rheumatic disorders and inflammatory conditions where free radicals play important role. Much<br>
attention is being directed now to harness and harvest the antioxidant compounds from natural<br>
resources.<br>
The compound (-)-Ohvil is used in pure form. Hence, the usage may be more advantageous<br>
than a mixture of compounds having similar properties, which are in current use. It is also<br>
important to note that the process of isolation of (-)-Olivil is highly economical.<br>
The present invention provides a useful source, Stereospermum Personatum, comprising<br>
antioxidant principle of which (-)-Olivil is isolated as pure and potent antioxidant molecule. (-)-<br>
Olivil has been compared with existing pharmacologically / therapeutically accepted<br>
antioxidant Probucol and alpha-tocopherol. It is found that (-)-Olivil is better than the above<br>
mentioned reference drugs and hence may be used with phannaceutically / therapeutically<br>
acceptable additives.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, (-)-Olivil may be effective in much less amount<br>
than the reference drugs mentioned above.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention relates to a composition useful as antioxidant, said<br>
composition comprising an effective amount of (-)-Olivil in combination with or associated<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable additives.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutically acceptable additive is selected in<br>
such a manner that it does not affect or interfere with the efficacy of (-)-Olivil.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, the additive is selected from nutrients such as<br>
carbohydrates, sugar, proteins, fats and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the ratio of (-)-Olivil to the additive is in the range<br>
between 0.1:10 to 3:10, preferably 0.4:10 to 2:10.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the amount of (-)-Olivil administered is in the<br>
range between 300 mg to 400mg per dose at least twice a day<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the composition is administered through oral route<br>
in the form of tablets, capsules, syrup or powder.<br>
One more embodiment of the invention relates to process for isolation of (-)-Olivil from the<br>
plant Stereospermum personation said process comprising the steps of:<br>
a) extracting the dried wood powder of Stereospermum Personatum with hexane;<br>
b) further extracting the residue from step (a) with chloroform;<br>
c) concentrating the chloroform solution from step (b) under vacuum;<br>
d) absorbing the dark brown extract on a silicagel (60-120mesh) and loaded on<br>
silicagel (60-120 mesh) column (4 cm dia to height of 100 cm);<br>
e) eluting the column with chloroform methanol gradient, and<br>
f) collecting the eluted fraction with 4 % methanol in chloroform and<br>
concentrating the fraction to obtain pure (-)- Olivil.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the solvents used are selected from hexane,<br>
chloroform and methanol.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the yield of(-)-Olivil obtained is about 0.073%<br>
of the plant dried material.<br>
One more embodiment relates to use of (-)-Olivil as an antioxidant or free-radical scavenger for<br>
animals and human beings.<br>
In yet another embodiment relates to use of (-)-Olivil for the manufacturing of a composition<br>
useful as an antioxidant.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, (-)-Olivil is administered orally.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention relates to a method for the treatment of free radical<br>
scavenging, comprising the steps of administration of an effective amount of (-)-Olivil to <br>
subject in need thereof preferably, (-)-0//v/7 is administered in the range of 300 mg-<br>
400mg/dose, twice a day.<br>
Stereospermum personatum hence is a new source for (-)-Olivil and its presence in this plant in<br>
good yields makes this invention more important. A comparison of yield (-)-OlMl from<br>
different plants is given in Table.2<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The present invention embodies isolation of (-)-Olivil, as antioxidant principle from a new plant<br>
source and identify its free radical scavenging property compared with medicinally important<br>
antioxidant drug molecules.<br>

In our copending patent application no. NF369/2001 we have claimed a process (-)-Olivifrom a natural source Stereospermum personatum.<br>
The invention is further described in the following examples that are given by the way of<br>
illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the invention in any manner.<br>
Example 1<br>
Experimental protocol: A process for the isolation of above lignans. The dried wood powder<br>
of Stereospermum personatum (3 Kg) was loaded on a Soxhlet apparatus. The powder was first<br>
extracted with hexane. The residue from the extraction of hexane was further extracted with<br>
chloroform. The chloroform solution was concentrated under vacuum. The dark brown extract<br>
(22 g) was adsorbed on silica gel (60-120 mesh) and loaded on silica gel (60-120 mesh)<br>
column. (4 cms diameter to a height of 100 cms).<br>
The column is subjected to elution with chloroform methanol gradient. The chloroformmethanol<br>
gradient is so selected to obtain specific fraction and thereby the desired compound.<br>
In the present case, the fractions eluted at 4% methanol in chloroform are collected separately<br>
and concentrated.<br>
The above fractions are subjected to further purification using silica gel column (&gt;200mesh, 2.5<br>
cm dia and 50 cm length) using chloroform methanol gradient. The eluent at 4% methanol in<br>
chloroform gave pure (-)-Olivil (2.2 g). The spectrochemical data of(-)-Olivil are given below:<br>

Example!<br>
In vitro evaluation of free radical scavenging antioxidant potency:<br>
Antioxidant activity of the compounds was tested for its capacity/potency to scavenge most<br>
widely used free radical, l,l-diphenyl-2-picryl hyrazyl radical (DPPH). The well-accepted and<br>
tested antioxidants namely probucol and a-tocopherol were taken as reference compounds.<br>
Img/ml DMSO concentration of the compounds were prepared and subsequently, diluted to<br>
lower concentrations with DMSO. 200 ul of test compounds were reconstituted to 1 ml in tris-<br>
HC1 buffer (pH 7.4). Equal volume of 500 uM of DPPH radical dissolved in ethanol was<br>
reacted with this. After incubation for 45 minutes in dark, the absorbency at 517 nm was<br>
recorded. Percent radical scavenging activity was calculated accordingly. All the readings were<br>
taken in triplicate. Results (Fig.l and Table 3) shows that compound under consideration<br>
possess potent antioxidant/free- radical scavenging property.<br>
