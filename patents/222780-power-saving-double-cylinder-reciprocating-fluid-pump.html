The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
POWER SAVING DOUBLE CYLINDER RECIPROCATING FLUID PUMP Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a power saving double cylinder reciprocating fluid pump. More particularly, the present invention relates to a double cylinder reciprocating fluid pump capable of being driven independent of the nature of the driving source, whether electrically, on fossil fuels or mechanically, without loss of performance and with significant savings in terms of power requirement. Background of the invention<br>
Water distribution systems are an essential component of agricultural operations across die world. Various methods of water distribution, particularly, ground water distribution systems by positive displacement reciprocating pumps have been known for several hundred years. In several parts of the world, traditional methods of drawing ground water for distribution using oxen or other field animals are still in vogue. As is evident however, such methods are not adequate to meet the large demands of water for irrigation, being limited in terms of output water and animal strength.<br>
A significant amount of power generated in a predominantly agricultural country such as India is consumed by irrigation. The cost of the power is in the end passed on the consumer as part of the price paid for agricultural products. This problem is accentuated by the fact that power outages result in a non-availabihty of power for the rural sector quite often. As a result of the frequent power outages, most people involved in agriculture using pump sets use diesel based generators to run their equipment such as threshers or pumps for drawing and supplying water. Therefore methods by which power consumption can be minimized are essential to ensure that the cost to the economy is not excessive.<br><br><br>
US Patent 6210125 discloses a reciprocating pump capable of operation using both electric and manual pedal power. The pump includes one way engagement clutch elements, which prevent hazardous pedal movement and potential pump damage. However, the entire focus in this patent is on pedal power i.e. manual power and not animal power as a source of power for the pump. The pump is also otherwise heavy and of conventional design.

The present invention relates to a novel power saving double cylinder reciprocating fluid pump. More particularly, the present invention relates to a double cylinder reciprocating fluid pump capable of being driven independent of the nature of the driving source, whether electrically, on fossil fuels or mechanically, without loss of performance and with significant savings in terms of power requirement.<br>
The pump of the invention consists of a main shaft with a driving gear connected thereto. The rotation of the main shaft due to externally applied power causes the driving gear to rotate thereby driving a driven gear provided on a crankshaft. This results in the alternate movement of the connecting rods in their respective liners. Thus both pistons move alternately in their respective liners. That is, when one piston moves up down, the other piston moves up and vice versa. Each cylinder and piston is provided with a respective suction valve and delivery valve. The delivery valves are both connected to the output line. The upward movement of the piston results in the corresponding suction valve provided at the bottom of the cylinder in the block housing to open due to air pressure thereby resulting in an intake of the fluid such as water. The suction valve is then closed due to the pressure applied due to the downward movement of the second piston. This downward movement also results in the opening of the corresponding delivery valve, thereby causing the fluid intake to be evacuated from the pump into the<br><br>
line. The opening and closing of the sets of valves is also controllable externally by the use of appropriate timing means in order to improve their efficiency.<br>
The pump of the invention can run on 1 to 1.5 KW motor compared to the standard usage of conventional double capacity motors while providing the same output. The piston and liners are made of fiber reinforced material such as glass filled plastic and are therefore hard enough to resist wear and tear and operating pressures while being lightweight at the same time.<br>
The vertical arrangement of the pump, the external control of the valves and the use of glass filled plastic liners and pistons results in a tremendous improvement in the ergonomics and aesthetics of the pump. The savings in terms of energy is up to 60% when the source of power is electric power and up to 80% when the fuel used for powering the pump is diesel.<br>
The pump of the invention comprises essentially of three sections:<br>
a)	a first head section<br>
b)	a second block section<br>
c)	a third gear section<br>
The head section is further divided into one part containing the suction valves for the respective cylinders and a second part containing the respective delivery valves. The delivery valves are provided at an interface between the head section and the external output line for discharge of the fluid to be sucked by the operation of the pump. The suction valves are made of glass filled polyvinyl chloride and are contained preferably in aluminium housing. Similarly, the delivery valves are also made of glass filled polyvinyl chloride and are also housed in respective aluminium housing. The head section is<br><br>
generally in the shape ofaY bend, the bottom of which is connected to the suction valve housing. The suction valve is attached to bores provided in a block.<br>
The block section contains the two cylinders containing their respective pistons and liners. The liners are preferably made of glass filled polyvinyl chloride material. The use of glass filled polyvinyl chloride material results in a substantial reduction in the weight of the pump without adversely affecting the sturdiness of the components and their resistance to the wear and tear of operation.<br>
The gear section comprises essentially of two walls. A delivery gear is provided which is attached to a crankshaft which is in turn attached to the two cylinders through a connecting rod. The connecting rod is attached to the block by means of a stand. A drive gear is provided on a main shaft which is connected at one end to a power source and at the other end to the delivery/driven gear in order to transmit the power input in the form of rotary motion to the crankshaft. This results in the alternate upward and downward movement of the two pistons provided in their respective cylinders. A balancing wheel is also provided attached to the main shaft in order to minimize the vibrations during operation.<br>
When the main shaft rotates due to the supply of power, the driving gear attached thereto also rotates thereby rotating the driven gear provided on the crankshaft. This results in alternating movement of the connecting rod in the crankshaft. As a result, the two pistons provided in their respective cylinders also move up and down in their respective liners. The continuous upward and downward movement of the two pistons in an alternating manner results in the opening and closing of the respective suction valves and delivery valves thereby resulting in a continuous supply of the fluid.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, a chain drive can be used to transfer motion to the main shaft. The ratio of the teeth on the driven and driving sprockets are preferably the same as for the driving and driven gears. The driving sprocket is mounted on the main shaft and the driven sprocket is placed abutting the Y bend. The Y bend is also provided with an secondary shaft which is provided with two cams over which the suction valves move, thereby regulating their opening and closing. A third gear can optionally be provided meshing with a fourth gear with an equal number of teeth. The fourth gear is provided on the secondary shaft. This enables the external regulation of the opening and closing of the valves.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which are illustrative and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
Figure la is a schematic representation of the pump of the invention. The pump comprises a main shaft (4) connected at one end to a power supply (1) through a driving sprocket (2). A driving gear (3) is provided connected to the main shaft (4) and communicating with a driven gear (8). The driven gear (8) is connected to a crankshaft (6) which is in turn connected to connecting rod (7). The rotation of the driving gear (3) causes the driven gear (8) to rotate thereby causing the crankshaft (6) also to rotate. This in turn causes the connecting rod (7) to move thereby moving the two pistons (9, 9") to move within their respective cylinders and liners (10, 10") in an alternate and continuous manner. The upward movement of one piston (9,9") causes the suction valves (11) provided connected to the bore of the block within the Y bend (14) to open thereby resulting in an intake of fluid such as water. The corresponding downward movement of the other piston ((9",9) results in the closing of the suction valve (11) and the opening of<br><br><br>
the delivery valve (17 in Figure lb). The suction valves and delivery valves are connected to their respective cams (15) which are in turn connected to a secondary shaft (130 which is in turn connected through a driven sprocket (12) to the driving sprocket (2).<br>
Figure 1 b is a schematic representation of the dehvery pipe (16), which is connected to the secondary shaft (18,13 in Figure 1). Each delivery valve (17) is provided with a respective cam (19) to control the opening and closing thereof. The other end of the block is connected to the main shaft (20,4 in Figure 1).<br>
Figure 2a and 2b are schematic representations of the piston used in the pump of the invention showing preferred internal dimensions thereof.<br>
Figures 3a and 3b are schematic representations of the liner of the used in the pump of the invention showing the preferred internal dimensions thereof.<br>
Figures 4a and 4b are schematic representations of the block ring used in the pump of the invention showing the preferred internal dimensions thereof.<br>
The most preferred embodiment of the pump comprises of weight of around 35 kilograms with a size of around 3" x 2" x 1.5". The delivery is of about 3". The dehvery head is preferably 30m and most preferably two gears are used in a ratio in the range of 1:5 to 1:6. The piston cylinders can be 1 to 3 while the valves are 2 to 6. The piston oil rings number from 1 to 3. The power required to run the pump is in the range of 1 to Vz KW. The dehvery capacity of this preferred embodiment is 30000 to 50000 litres per hour.<br>
The pump of the invention has several applications apart from irrigation, such as for driving a thresher. A significant advantage of the pump of the invention is that it consumes substantially less power or diesel thereby leading to tremendous savings in terms of energy costs. The variability of the power source used (animal power, manual<br><br><br>
power, electric or diesel power)  means that even absence of conventional energy resources such as fuels do not adversely affect the utility of the pump.<br>
The pump of the invention enables the reduction on reliance on synthetic or artificial power sources such as fossil or organic fuels or electricity since the pump can also run based on manual or animal power. For example, the power pulley can be connected to a pair of oxen to run the pump without adversely affecting the performance or the delivery output thereof.<br><br>
