frame 100. Further, left and right side surfaces 351 and 352<br>
of the rib 331 are inclined outwardly to the left and the right<br>
in a width direction as they get closer to a rear portion,<br>
respectively.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the first winged portions 332 and 333<br>
extend leftward and rightward from a tip end of the rib 331 in<br>
the width direction, respectively. The second winged portions<br>
334 and 335 extend leftward and rightward from a proximal end<br>
of the rib 331, respectively above the first winged portions<br>
332 and 333. Connection portions 361 and 362 connected to the<br>
left side member 301 and the right side member 302 are provided<br>
in intermediate portions of the left and right first winged<br>
portions 332 and 333, respectively. In this embodiment, screw<br>
holes for screwing the connection portions 361 and 362 are<br>
formed in the connection portions 361 and 3 62, respectively.<br>
Further, a tip end of the left first winged portion 332 is<br>
connected to a tip end of the left second winged portion 334<br>
via a wall 363. The wall 363 has a shape proportional to an<br>
inner side surface of the left side member 301 and includes a<br>
connection portion 364 connected to the inner side surface of<br>
the left side member 301. In this embodiment, the left side<br>

Moreover, in this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 7, a wall<br>
3 65 connected to an inner side surface of the right side member<br>
302 is provided on a tip end of the right first winged portion<br>
333. The wall 365 has a shape proportional to the inner side<br>
surface of the right side member 302 and includes a connection<br>
portion 366 connected to the inner side surface of the right<br>
side member 302. In this embodiment, the right side member 302<br>
and the front side member 303 are connected with each other by<br>
connecting the connection portions 322 and 323 of the right side<br>
member 302 shown in Fig. 6 to the connection portions 3 62 and<br>
366 of the front side member 303 shown in Fig. 7. Furthermore,<br>
in this embodiment, the exhaust pipe 317 connected to the engine<br>
200 extends to a front side of the engine 200 and, on the front<br>
side of the engine 200, extends rearward while forming a<br>
U-shaped curve. As shown in Fig. 5, a gap allowing the exhaust<br>
pipe 317 connected to the engine 200 to pass through is formed<br>
between the tip end of the right second winged portion 335 and<br>
the right side member 302.<br>
In this embodiment, the front side member 303 is a resin<br>
molded part and molded by a pair of metal molds that can cut<br>
away the front side member 303 longitudinally. In other words,<br>
each of the respective regions such as the rib 331, the first<br>
winged portions 332 and 333, and the second winged portions 334<br>
and 335 is formed into a shape that enables each region to be<br>
<br>
 <br>
cut away in a cutting direction of the metal molds. The front<br>
side member 303 can thereby be molded by the pair of metal molds<br>
without a complicated cutting structure.<br>
Next, as shown in Fig. 5, the stay 304 is attached to the<br>
body frame 100 above the front side member 303 and supports upper<br>
portions of the left side member 301 and the right side member<br>
302. In this embodiment, the stay 304 is a rod-like member.<br>
A bracket 125 for attaching the stay 304 to an upper position<br>
than a position at which the front side member 303 is attached<br>
is attached to the body frame 100. Attachment pieces 372 are<br>
welded to a central portion 371 of the stay 304. The stay 304<br>
is provided on the front side of the body frame 100 and the<br>
attachment pieces 372 are attached to the bracket 125 of the<br>
body frame 100 by means of bolts. Left and right side portions<br>
373 and 374 of the stay 304 extend obliquely rearward and are<br>
connected to the connection portion 314 and 324 in the upper<br>
portions of the left side member 301 and the right side member<br>
302 shown in Figs. 4 and 6, respectively. In this embodiment,<br>
the connection portions 314 and 324 in the upper portions of<br>
the left side member 301 and the right side member 302 are formed<br>
out of protrusions each having a return formed on a tip end,<br>
respectively. Due to this, although not shown, flanges are<br>
formed on both left and right ends of the stay 304 and fitting<br>
holes into which the protrusions of the connection portions 314<br>
and 324 are fitted are formed in the flanges, respectively. A<br>
 <br>
rubber ring (bush) is fitted into each of the fitting holes,<br>
thereby fitting the protrusion of each of the connection<br>
portions 314 and 324 into each fitting hole without slackening.<br>
This structure can facilitate attaching or detaching of the left<br>
side member 301 and the right side member 302 to or from the<br>
stay 304.<br>
A structure of the under cowl 300 according to this<br>
embodiment has been described so far. The under cowl 300<br>
includes the left side member 301 covering up at least a part<br>
of the left side of the engine 200 and the right side member<br>
302	covering up at least a part of the right side of the engine<br>

embodiment, the front side member 303 connecting the left side<br>
member 301 with the right side member 302 is connected to the<br>
body frame 100. Due to this, as compared with an instance in<br>
which a member corresponding to the front side member is not<br>
connected to the body frame 100 as disclosed in the Japanese<br>
Examined Patent Publication No. 3-62590, the rigidity of the<br>
under cowl 300 can be secured. Furthermore, the under cowl 300<br>
can be attached to the body frame 100 with high accuracy.<br>
Moreover, in this embodiment, the under cowl 300 is constituted<br>
by the three members, that is, the left side member 301, the<br>
<br>
 <br>
right side member 302, and the front side member 303. Due to<br>
this, the under cowl 300 can be molded by a pair of simple metal<br>
molds without a complicated cutting structure. Further, the<br>
under cowl 30 0 can be coated in a state in which such members<br>
as the left side member 301, the right side member 302, the front<br>
side member 303, and the stay 304 are detached from the under<br>
cowl 300. Therefore, the respective members can be coated<br>
easily and beautifully according to rider's preference.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, the under cowl 3 00<br>
covers up both side portions of the engine 200 when viewed from<br>
a front side of the straddle-type vehicle 1000 as shown in Fig.<br>
5. Due to this, flowing air can be introduced from a front side<br>
of the under cowl 300 into the both sides of the engine 200,<br>
making it possible to efficiently cool the engine 200.<br>
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1, the under cowl 300 covers<br>
up a front side portion of the engine 200 when viewed from a<br>
lateral side of the straddle-type vehicle 1000. Due to this,<br>
the flowing air can be efficiently introduced from the front<br>
side of the under cowl 300 into the engine 200. The engine 200<br>
can thereby be efficiently cooled. Further, in this embodiment,<br>
the under cowl 300 does not cover up a rear side portion of the<br>
engine 200 when viewed from the lateral side of the<br>
straddle-type vehicle 1000. Due to this, the air surrounding<br>
the engine 200 can be promptly released during running. The<br>
engine 200 can thereby be efficiently cooled.<br>
 <br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, the straddle-type<br>
vehicle 1000 includes the stay 304 attached to the body frame<br>
100 above the front side member 303, and the stay 304 supports<br>
the upper portions of the left side member 301 and the right<br>
side member 302, respectively. Furthermore, in this<br>
embodiment, the lower portions 316 and 326 of the left side<br>
member 301 and the right side member 302, respectively are<br>
attached to the bracket attached to the body frame 100 (to be<br>
specific, the attachment portion 133 provided on the footrest<br>
bracket 312). This can further improve the rigidity of the<br>
under cowl 300 and attachment position accuracy.<br>
Additionally, in this embodiment, the front side member<br>
303 includes the rib 331 extending forward and downward from<br>
the region attached to the body frame 100 and the first winged<br>
portions 332 and 333 extending leftward and rightward from the<br>
tip end of the rib 331 in the width direction. The first winged<br>
portions 332 and 333 are connected to the left side member 301<br>
and the right side member 302, respectively. The left and right<br>
side surfaces 351 and 352 of the rib 331 are inclined outwardly<br>
to the left and the right in a width direction as they get closer<br>
to the rear portion, respectively. The front side member 303<br>
also includes the second winged portions 334 and 335 extending<br>
leftward and rightward from the proximal end of the rib 331.<br>
The left second winged portion 334 is connected to the left side<br>
member 301. In this embodiment, shapes of the rib 331, the first<br>
<br>
 <br>
winged portions 332 and 333, and the second winged portions 334<br>
and 335 enable the rigidity of the under cowl 300 to be improved,<br>
the flowing air to be introduced into the periphery of the engine<br>
200 during running, and the engine 200 to be efficiently cooled.<br>
In this embodiment, the gap allowing the exhaust pipe 317<br>
connected to the engine 200 to pass through is formed in the<br>
front side member 303. Due to this, the under cowl 300 can be<br>
arranged without disturbing insertion of the exhaust pipe 317.<br>
The straddle-type vehicle according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention has been described so far based on the<br>
drawings. However, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
above-stated embodiment.<br>
For example, the respective shapes of the left side member,<br>
the right side member, the front side member, and the stay, the<br>
attachment structure of the under cowl to the body frame,<br>
connection structures of the left side member, the right side<br>
member, the front side member, and the stay that constitute the<br>
under cowl and the like are not limited to the above-stated<br>
embodiment but can be variously changed. For example, in the<br>
above-stated embodiment, the front side member includes the<br>
second winged portions extending leftward and rightward from<br>
the rib, respectively and the left second winged portion is<br>
connected to the left side member. Alternatively, the right<br>
second winged portion may be connected to the right side member.<br>
Further, while the front side member includes the second winged<br>
<br>
 <br>
portions extending leftward and rightward from the rib, the left<br>
and right second winged portions may be connected to the left<br>
side member and the right side member, respectively.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
above-stated embodiment but can be applied to various types of<br>
