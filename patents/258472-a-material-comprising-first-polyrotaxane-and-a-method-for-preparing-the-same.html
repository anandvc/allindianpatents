MATERIAL COMPRISING POLYROTAXANE AND POLYMER AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a material comprising a polyrotaxane and a polymer, and a method for producing the material. In particular, the present invention relates to a material in which a part or all of polymers and the polyrotaxane are crosslinked with each other through photo-crosslinking reaction, and a method for producing the material.<br>
Background Art<br>
A part of the present inventors have proposed a crosslinked polyrotaxane (See Patent Document 1, whole of which is incorporated herein by reference).  The crosslinked polyrotaxane is formed by crosslinking polyrotaxanes, each of which is comprised of a pseudopolyrotaxane, which comprises a linear molecule (axis) and cyclic molecules (rota) in which the linear molecule is included in a cavity (cavities) of cyclic molecules in a skewered manner, and capping groups , each of which is located at each end of the pseudopolyrotaxane (each end of the linear molecule) in order to prevent the dissociation of the cyclic molecules.  The crosslinked polyrotaxane has viscoelasticity generated by the movement of a cyclic molecule. Thus , even if strain is applied to the crosslinked polyrotaxane, the strain is dispersed uniformly in the crosslinked polyrotaxane by this action.  Therefore, crack or scratch is<br><br>
not generated, in contrast to the conventional crosslinked polymer, and thus, the crosslinked polyrotaxane is expected to be applied in various fields. Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent No. 3475252.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problem to be solved by the Invention<br>
The crosslinking described in examples of Patent Document 1 is carried out by addition of a crosslinking agent.  Thus, in the crosslinking, it is necessary to carry out treatment such as acidifying or basifying or heating the system to allow the reaction to proceed.  However, if crosslinking is carried out without such treatment, the handling becomes easy.  In addition, although polyrotaxanes are crosslinked with each other in crosslinked polyrotaxane, development of compounds produced by cross linking polyrotaxane with other polymers is highly promoted, and crosslinkage is also requested to be carried out without the above treatment in some cases of the other polymers.<br>
Additionally, the above crosslinking possesses the problem of making the handling of the crosslinked substance difficult as the crosslinkage proceeds.<br>
An obj ect of the present invention is to solve the problems described above.<br>
Specifically, an object of the present invention is to provide a material comprising a polyrotaxane and a polymer in which the polyrotaxane and the polymer are crosslinked with each other by irradiation of light, and a method for producing the<br><br>
material.<br>

Effects of the invention<br>
The present invention can provide a material comprising a polyrotaxane and a polymer in which the polyrotaxane and the polymer are crosslinked with each other by irradiation, and a method for producing the material.<br><br>
Preferred Embodiments for Carrying Out the Present Invention<br>
The present invention will be described in detail hereinafter.<br>
The present invention provides a material comprising a first polyrotaxane and a polymer , wherein the first polyrotaxane comprises a first cyclic molecule (s) , a first linear molecule which is included in a cavity (cavities) of the first cyclic molecule (s) in a skewered manner, and a first capping group which is located at each end of the first linear molecule to prevent the dissociation of the first cyclic molecule(s) , and wherein a part of the polyrotaxane and the polymer is bound to each other by a photo-crosslinking reaction through the first cyclic molecule(s).  In other words, the material according to the present invention comprises the first polyrotaxane and the polymer, and a part of the polyrotaxane and the polymer is bound to each other by a photo-crosslinking reaction through the first cyclic molecule(s), and the material has a binding group generated by the photo-crosslinking reaction.<br>
Furthermore, the polymer may be a second polyrotaxane which may be same as or different from the first polyrotaxane.<br>
The material according to the present invention will be illustrated using Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of a material 1 of the present invention, which comprises a polymer 3 and a first polyrotaxane 5. The first polyrotaxane 5 has a first linear molecule 6, a first cyclic molecule 7 and a first capping group 8. The polymer 3 and polymer 3' and the polyrotaxane 5 are bound through the cyclic molecule 7.  When<br><br>
stress of deformation along an arrow direction is loaded on the material 1 as shown in Fig. 1(a) , the material 1 can adopt a configuration as shown in Fig. 1(b) . .That is, since the first cyclic molecule 7 can move along the first linear molecule 6 (in other -words, the linear molecule can move in the cyclic molecule), stress of deformation can be absorbed within the material.<br>
The present invention can carry out linkage between the polymer 3 and the first polyrotaxane 5 by photo-crosslinking reaction.<br>
Use of photo-reactive groups between a cyclic molecule of the first polyrotaxane and the polymer can carry out photo-crosslinking reaction, as described later.  Use of photo-crosslinking reaction allows reaction conditions, e.g. , acidity or basicity or temperatures, to be mild, different from the reaction using a conventional crosslinking agent. Therefore, the cross-linking reaction according to the present invention can be carried out without adversely affecting the polymer or the first polyrotaxane to be used.  Further, conventional crosslinking reactions are restricted to the case where a polyrotaxane is soluble in the employed solvent.  The use of the photo-crosslinking reaction of the present invention removes the restriction and can improve the selectivity of solvents in the reaction, including cross-linking reactions without using solvents. More, although the difficulty in handling of the cross-linked substances is observed in the conventional crosslinking reaction, the photo-crosslinking<br><br>
reaction according to the present invention can provide the advantage of making the handling of the crosslinked substances easier.<br>
The photo-crosslinking reaction according to the present invention can be carried out by using photo-reactive groups of a cyclic molecule of the first polyrotaxane and the polymer. The photo-reactive groups may include groups each having an unsaturated bond (e.g. , groups each having an unsaturated double bond) or photosensitive groups.<br>
In a case where the photo-reactive group is a group having an unsaturated bond, the photo-crosslinking reaction is initiated by means of photo-irradiation and a reaction initiator to generate bindings between the groups each having the unsaturated bond.  In this case, a reaction initiator may be present in the reaction field.  Alternatively, in a case where the photo-reactive group is a photosensitive group, the photo-crosslinking reaction is initiated by photo-irradiation to generate bindings between photosensitive groups without using a reaction initiator.<br>
The groups each having an unsaturated bond, e.g. , groups each having an unsaturated double bond, may include, but are not limited to, olefinic groups, for example, acrylic groups, methacrylic groups, vinyl ether groups, styryl groups, and the like.<br>
The reaction initiator may be at least one selected from the group consisting of quinones, aromatic ketones, benzoin, benzoin ethers, biimidazole compounds and derivatives thereof,<br><br>

The materials can be produced, for example, by methods described below:<br>
A method of producing the material according to the present invention comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	preparing the first polyrotaxane which comprises a first cyclic molecule(s), a first linear molecule which is included in a cavity (cavities) of the first cyclic molecule(s) in a skewered manner, and a first capping group which is located at each end of the first linear molecule to prevent the dissociation of the first cyclic molecule(s), and the first cyclic molecule(s) has (have) a first photo-reactive group;<br>
b)	preparing the polymer comprising a second photo-reactive group which may be the same as or different from the first photo-reactive group;<br>
c)	mixing the first polyrotaxane and the polymer to obtain<br>
the mixture; and<br>
d)	irradiating the mixture and binding at least a part<br>
of the first polyrotaxane and the polymer to each other by a<br>
photo-crosslinking reaction through the first cyclic<br>
molecule(s), to obtain the material.<br>
In the step c) , other polymers can be present in addition<br><br>
to the polymer having the second photo-reactive group. For example, the other polymers may include the same kind of polymers as polymers having the second photo-reactive group that are different only in not having the second photo-reactive group. The first and second photo-reactive groups may also be all groups each having an unsaturated bond, all photosensitive<br>
groups, partially group (s) each having an unsaturated bond, or<br>
*<br>
partially photosensitive groups .  Additionally , the groups each<br>
having the unsaturated bond may be all the same kind of groups or may contain two or more kinds of unsaturated bonds. The photosensitive group may be all the same kind of groups or may contain two or more kinds of photosensitive groups. Moreover, the groups as mentioned above can be used as groups each having the unsaturated bond and photosensitive groups.<br>
In the photo-crosslinking reaction, a reaction initiator may be used. In this case, during the step c) or subsequent to the step c) and prior to the step d) , the method according to the present invention may further comprise a step of adding a reaction initiator to the mixture. This makes it possible to, for example, carry out photo-crosslinking reaction between the groups each having the unsaturated bond, which is initiated by a reaction initiator by irradiation of light in the step d) to bind the first polyrotaxane to the polymer. Furthermore, the reaction initiators used herein may include initiators similar to those mentioned above.<br>
In a case where a part of the first and second photo-reactive groups are groups each having an unsaturated bond<br><br>
and a part of the first and second photo-reactive groups are photosensitive groups, the timing of the photo-crosslinking reaction in the step d) can be shifted as in the following.  That is, i) after groups each having an unsaturated bond are reacted with each other, photosensitive groups are reacted with each other to give bonded substances.  In addition, ii) after photosensitive groups are reacted with each other, groups each having an unsaturated bond are reacted with each other to give bonded substances.  Moreover, iii) groups each having an unsaturated bond and photosensitive groups are reacted with each other almost simultaneously to give bonded substances.  The reactions of the items i) to iii) can be employed, depending on reaction conditions of groups each having an unsaturated bond and photosensitive groups, solvents (conditions if not used) to be used, characteristics of materials to be obtained and the like.<br>
Although a polymer used in the present invention depends on applications of the material, the method according to the present invention may further comprise a step of crosslinking the polymers with each other, prior to the step b) or subsequent to the step b).<br>
The present invention will be illustrated more specifically by way of the following Examples , but is not limited thereby.<br>
