				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a system for automatic operation of the barrier used for railway crossing.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Manually operated barrier is as such known to have been provided which keeps at least one man engaged for its operation and the same is associated with several distinct disadvantages such as non return of the barrier to its original position in case any object comes under it.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to propose a system for automatic operation of the barrier used for railway crossing.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a system for automatic operation of the barrier used for railway crossing which does not require anybody to monitor the operation of the barrier.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose a system for automatic operation of the barrier used for railway crossing comprising pole, which indicates about the opening and closing of the barrier.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose a system for automatic operation of the barrier used for railway crossing comprising pole which also produces siren to make the public alert.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to propose a system for automatic operation of the barrier used for railway crossing comprising signal to guide the driver of the train.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a system for automatic operation of the barrier used for railway crossing characterized in that LED on one side of the rail and a switch (S1) on the other side of the rail, which is connected to a photo detector in connection of a relay (R1'), which is further connected to relay (R3') through relay (R2' and R4') wherein the relays are attached to a motor and a plurality of switches.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows: arrangement of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 shows: a relay used in the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTEION WITH REFERENCE TO ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Reference may be made to Figure. 1 wherein light emitting diode LED (1) is provided on one side of the rail and an observer in the form of a switch (Si) which is also known as selfoc lens is provided in front of the LED on the other side of the rail, which observes LED and receives signal from the same. However, as soon as the train passes through the rail, LED is disconnected with the switch and the switch transmits a signal through an optical fibre cable to a photo detector (2) for the detection of the signal and conversion of the same into electrical energy, which is utilized by the system for its operation.<br>
The detector is connected to a Relay (R2'), through a relay (Rll- The relay as shown in fig (2) is a magnetic instrument, which produces a magnetic field. Both the relays (R2' and R3) regulate the switches (S4 and Ss) under the barrier which are connected to relay (R3'). Switch (S2) stops the motor as soon as the barrier rests on it. Switch (S2) is connected to a motor (M) which is connected to the relays (R2' 8B R4)as shown in Fig.l. The motor used is preferably DC motor. In the instance, the barrier encounters any obstacle under it while being closed, the switch (S4) transmits signal to the relay (R3) connected with the relay (R4'), which changes the direction of current through the motor. This causes the barrier to go up to its original position. Thereafter, switch (Ss) comes into action to bring the barrier down on the switch (S2), which stops the processing of the whole system.<br>
As soon as the barrier goes up after passing of the train, Switch (S6) provided on the barrier stops the motor connected therewith.<br>
Relay (R4) is also connected with relay (R2') and controls fluctuation of voltage in the motor.<br>
Another LED and switch (S3) are provided on the other side of the rail, which have similar connection as that of first set of LED and Switch (S1).<br>
A weight sensor is disposed under the rail at required distance from the barrier, adjacent to which a microwave solid device comprising Microwave Transistor (Tunnel diode) is positioned. As soon as, the train passes over the rail under which weight sensor is located, the microwave device becomes operational and transmits microwave to a radio buzzer installed on the pole, which makes buzzing noise with the flash of red light to indicate that, the barrier is not operational, in the instance the barrier is out of order. Otherwise, no action is taken by the pole.<br>
Further, a pole is provided on both sides of railway i.e. on the roads approaching the rail so as to alert the public. The pole comprises a green and red light with a buzzer. The pole indicates green light when the barrier opens up and red light with a siren when the barrier closes down. Further, a signal is provided between the Switch (I &amp; III) and barrier on the side of the rail i.e. on both sides of approach to guide the driver in<br>
the train. The signal comprises yellow and green light, which indicates non operation and closure of the barrier respectively. The pole and signal are connected with the motor. The barrier is provided with atleast one gear for the control of its speed according to the requirement.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to modifications, adaptations and changes by those skilled in the art. Such variant embodiments employing the concepts and features of this invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
1.	A system for automatic operation of the barrier used for railway crossing characterized in that LED on one side of the rail and a switch (S1) on the other side of the rail, which is connected to a photo detector in connection of a relay (R1'), which is further connected to relay (R3') through relay (R2' and R4') wherein the relays are attached to a motor and a plurality of switches.<br>
2.	A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the relay (R3') is connected to switches (S4 and S5).<br>
3.	A system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the relays (R2' and R4') are connected to a motor.<br>
4.	A system as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein switches (S2 and S6) are connected to the motor.<br>
5.	A system as claimed in any of the preceding claims, comprising a pole such as herein described on the road to alert the public and signal such as herein described on the rail side to guide the driver in the train wherein the pole and signal are connected to the motor.<br>
6.	A system as claimed in any of the preceding claims, comprising a weight sensor positioned adjacent to a microwave solid device under the rail so as to make a radio buzzer on the pole operational with the flash of red light in case the barrier is out of order.<br>
7. A system for automatic operation of the barrier used for railway crossing substantially as herein described and illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br></td>
