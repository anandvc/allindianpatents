				<td>FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
The present invention in general relates to mobile communication devices. Further, this invention relates to a method and system for priority-based deactivation of calls in mobile communication devices. More particularly this invention relates to a method of deactivating calls based on priority in accordance of the battery level.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
A mobile communication device, also referred as User Equipment (UE), is a device that is used to make two types of calls, namely, Circuit Switched (CS) calls and/or Packet Switched (PS) calls in a mobile communication environment such as GPRS, 3G or other similar environments. Different types of calls are handled by different protocols. The Circuit Switched calls are handled by Call Control (CC) protocol and Packet Switched calls are handled by Session Management (SM) protocol. The User Equipment is usually powered only by a small battery with limited power storage capacity. The configuration and settings of the user equipment and other relevant data necessary for the functioning of the user equipment is stored in Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM) and Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) of the mobile communication device.<br>
Presently, the user equipment needs to draws only a very small current from the battery if no call is active, and if any of CS or PS call is active, a large current is drawn from the battery. Therefore, depending on the traffic, which is generated to/from the UE, the battery used in UE lasts several hours before it needs to be recharged / replaced. The same has been described in www.3gpp.org.<br>
A mobile subscriber, having CS and PS capable user equipment, can make CS and PS calls from his/her UE.<br>
The Circuit Switched call traffic will consist of one of the following -<br>
-	Circuit Switched Data<br>
-	Circuit Switched Voice<br><br>
The Packet Switched call traffic will consist of one of the following:<br>
-	Conversational<br>
-	Streaming<br>
-	Interactive<br>
-	Background<br>
For PS calls, a Quality of Service (QoS) profile is negotiated by the UE at the time of call activation. And the respective network shall guarantee the QoS thus negotiated. Depending on the negotiated QoS parameters and type of traffic, the traffic channels are allocated by the network. These traffic channels are used by the UE to send and receive data or voice. Even in circumstances where the UE does not have a valid subscription, the user is allowed by the network to make emergency calls. To perform all of the above tasks, the UE has only a finite and limited source of battery backup that lasts a specific amount of time, which, in turn is subject to traffic generated to/from UE.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
The deactivation of calls can be initiated by user or network. Presently, the technology of deactivation of calls in progress by checking the battery level is not available. None of the mobile communication devices available have or support this feature. Priorities, which may be mapped to battery level, are not assigned to calls in the existing technologies. In fact, all calls are allowed until battery becomes too weak to handle the call. If more than one call is active at the same time, more current will be drawn from the battery.<br>
So, if more than one call (PS/CS) is active simultaneously, it is very difficult for the UE to decide which call should be dropped/deactivated in certain abnormal conditions such as battery becoming low on power during the call progress, because information on importance/priority of the call is unavailable to the UE. Hence, if ongoing calls are allowed to continue in such conditions, then the battery, which cannot provide enough power for such long periods to UE, will drain out<br><br>
rapidly and the user stands the risk of losing important data. Another result of such situations is that the calls are not deactivated graciously when the power level of the battery drops below a minimum required level. Enumerated below are a few examples of such scenarios:<br>
-	When the user is accessing his/her bank account over the UE and also downloading a file simultaneously and battery power level is detected to be low, then there is the risk that the user may lose banking transaction or the file, either of which may be more important from user's perspective at that time.<br>
-	When the user is downloading an important file and another CS or PS call is also active and battery level is detected to be low, then there is the risk that the user may lose the file being downloaded, which may be more important at that particular instant to the user.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is to invent a mobile communication device and a method for priority based deactivation of calls thereof.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method to deactivate the ongoing PS or CS calls based on the user assigned importance to calls when battery level is detected low.<br>
It is another object of this invention to invent a method by which the battery power level of the mobile communication device is continuously/periodically checked, priorities to the active calls assigned, mapping is done between battery power level and the priority levels, and a mechanism is provided to deactivate calls based on their assigned priorities vis-S-vis the current battery power level.<br>
It is another object of the invention to deactivate the calls based on assigned priorities either manually or automatically.<br>
It is another object of the invention to gracefully deactivate the call having lesser priority in accordance with rules set in this regard to the assignment of priorities to<br><br>
the calls and the assigned mapping between the different power levels.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses a mobile communication device having incorporated a program through which prioritizing and deactivation of calls depending on such priorities is achieved. Also, in the present invention, a method is disclosed wherein when there is more than one call (CS/PS) is active at any point of time and battery power backup level drops below some pre-specified threshold level, then, calls are deactivated based on importance of the call so that the most important call can continue. However, the importance of the call will be decided by the user. The user has the option of specifying the importance of each call either by specifying the same initially in the call setup of the UE or during the call itself.<br>
In the manual mode, the user is prompted before deactivating a call so that he may, if he so desires reassign the priorities to the active calls. In the automatic mode, the calls are gracefully deactivated in accordance with the rules set in regard to the assignment of priorities to the calls and the assigned mapping between the different power levels and the priorities.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention comprises a mobile communication device as herein described is capable of prioritising and of deactivation of calls of lesser priority received by it especially when the calls are received during low battery power.<br>
Further the present invention comprises a method for deactivation of calls based on priorities, wherein when there is more than one call (CS/PS) active at any point of time and battery power backup level drops below some pre-specified threshold level, then calls are deactivated based on user-specified priority of the call which in turn is mapped to the pre-specified battery power level values so that the most important call can continue.<br><br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and the detailed description as follows.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS Figure 1 illustrates the mapping of priorities to the battery level.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the mapping of priorities to active calls.<br>
Figure 3 exemplifies battery power levels.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the method used to deactivate the calls based on assigned priorities.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
In the present invention, when there is more than one call (OS/PS) is active at any point of time and battery power backup level drops below some pre-specified threshold level, then calls are deactivated based on importance of the call so that the most important call can continue. The importance of the call is decided only by the user, either during the call or by initially specifying the same in the UE call setup.<br><br>
The following subsections describe the invention in detail.<br>
Structure of the Invention<br>
The following description presents a description of the proposed invention:<br>
Let the highest battery power level be Lh. Let the threshold value of battery level be Lt. Let minimum required power level for call to be active, be Lmin. If battery<br>
power levels are defined L1, L2, L3,	, Ln, Active calls are C1, C2, C3	,Cm<br>
and priority of calls are P1, P2, P3,	, Pn respectively where:<br>
Lt&gt;=L1 &gt;L2&gt;L3	&gt;Ln<br>
P1 <p2></p2>
The following rules are applied for priority and power levels :<br>
-	The total numbers of priorities are equal to number of power levels.<br>
-	One call can have one and only one priority at any point in time.<br>
-	More than one call can have same priority at any point in time.<br>
-	There is one to one mapping between priorities and power levels.<br>
-	There is one to many mapping between priorities and active calls.<br>
All calls would be allowed without any indication to the user when the battery level is in the range between Lt and Lh. Let the detected power level be Ld where L1 
When the mode of deactivation is automatic then all calls having priority mapping with the power level 
Operation of the invention<br><br>
The method involves following steps:<br>
(a)	The battery power level of the UE is checked continuously;<br>
(b)	If the power is above threshold, the calls can go on smoothly and the process of checking battery power is continued;<br>
(c)	If the battery power is less than the minimum power required, then all the calls having power less than or equal, the detected power are deactivated and the process of battery power detection is continued;<br>
(d)	If the battery power is below threshold, the status of deactivation mode is checked whether it is automatic or manual;<br>
(e)	If the mode is automatic, then all the calls having power level less than or equal to threshold value are gracefully deactivated and the process of checking battery power level is continued;<br>
(f)	If the mode is manual, then the user will be prompted for deactivation of all calls having priority mapping with the power level less than or equal to threshold value;<br>
(g)	If the user confirms deactivation, the call is deactivated gracefully and it is checked whether more calls are there with power 
(h) If the user does not confirm deactivation, he is asked to reassign priority. If he assigns new priority, it is stored and it is checked whether more calls with power
(i) If the user does not assign priority, it is checked whether more calls with power
Effects/Advantage(s) of the Invention<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention to provide a mechanism to deactivate the calls, as per the priorities dynamically assigned by the user, as the battery power level goes down.<br><br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, printer or a multi function device.<br>
