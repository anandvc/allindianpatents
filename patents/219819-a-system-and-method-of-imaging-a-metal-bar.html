BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	RELATED FIELD<br>
The present invention relates a method and system for imaging a metal bar, an imaging system that can image the surface details of a workpiece, such as a rolled/drawn metal bar.<br>
2.	DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
It is known to produce a metal bar by a mechanical process such as rolling or drawing. Such metal bar is different than a metal slab, bloom, or strip (hereafter referenced as Metal Flat) in that the cross section of such a bar has a smaller circumference/cross-section-area ratio such that the bar may rotate/twist about a longitudinal axis while moving forward longitudinally. For example, the bar shapes shown in Figure 2 have a ratio of circumference to cross-sectional-area that is equal to or smaller than 4.25 when the cross sectional area is unity for the given shape. The shape, when taken in cross section, of such a metal bar may be a round shape, an oval shape, or a polygonal shape, as shown as a hexagon, octagon or a square in Figure 2. A metal bar of this type is typically referred to as "long products" rather than "flat products" in the related industries. Rolling, drawing, extrusion and the like, as used in this disclosure and hereafter referenced as a Reducing Process, describe the ways for reducing the cross sectional dimensions of the metal workpiece through mechanical contact of the applicable tools, such as rollers and drawing dies, and the workpiece. These Reducing Processes are generally continuous, or substantially continuous, in nature.<br>
In the metal production industry, the presence or absence of surface defects is a<br><br>
relevant criterion upon which assessments of the metal products are made. For instance, surface defects account for half of the external rejects (i.e., rejected by the customer) for the steel bar and rod industry. However, the conventional art provides no reliable means to detect such defects. There are several challenges that conventional inspection approaches have been unable to overcome.<br>
First, in the case where inspection occurs while the metal bar products are "hot," the temperature can be as high as 1,1000 C, preventing the use of many inspection technologies. Second, the traveling speed of such a metal bar as prescribed above can be, presently, as fast as 100 times, several times faster than the speed of tie fastest metal strip and nearly 100 times faster than a metal slab or bloom. Further, speed increases are expected in the near future in the range of 150 in/s to 200 In/s. Conventional inspection approaches simply cannot accommodate such high traveling speeds. Third, a high temperature metal bar such as described above is typically confined in a sectional conduit so that the bar will not cobble. Cobbling is an incident wherein a hot, high speed metal bar runs freely outside the conduit. The space, therefore, for any inspection device is extremely limited.<br>
While it is known to apply various imaging approaches to the inspection of cast or rolled Metal Flats, imaging technologies have heretofore not been used in Long Products (i.e., metal bar) inspection. Conventional imaging systems are not believed capable for use in inspecting metal bars and the like because the geometry of the metal bars invalidate the illumination and imaging designs that are used to enhance/capture defects on flat surfaces. Figure 4 illustrates the differences of applying illumination and of capturing images on a flat workpiece versus a round workpiece. As to the non-flat workpiece, the freedom in optical alignment and optical working ranges disappears when the object of interest does not have a flat surface. For instance, the image line and the illumination line may not overlap if the light or the camera is tilted, as shown in exemplary fashion in Figure 4. Furthermore, metal bars typically are at a higher temperature than Metal Flats. Heat dissipation of an object is proportional to the area exposed to the cooling media, such as ambient air or water spray. The area of a Metal Flat<br><br>
is several times larger than that of a metal bar, assuming both the flat and the bar are made of the same material and both have the same longitudinal unit density and cross section area.<br>
It is, however, known to employ imaging-based instruments for bar gauge measurement/control (shadow measurement), bar existence/presence, and bar traveling speed measurement In the Reducing Process.<br>
It is also known to employ electro-magnetic devices, such as eddy current-based instruments, in the assessment of long products. Eddy-current based sensing systems are used for the detection of surface imperfections in the Reducing Process for in-line inspection. This approach has a high response rate, able to work in a high throughput production line environment (e.g., one kilometer of hot steel bars per minute). However, this approach has several drawbacks. First, it must be very close to the hot surface (typically less than 2.5 mm). Accordingly, it is vibration sensitive and temperature sensitive. Moreover, it is not quantitative in the sense that it is NOT able to describe the nature of the detected defect. Finally, eddy-current approaches are incapable of detecting certain types of defects. As a result, the inspection outcome from eddy current devices is not used by the metal industry for a deterministic judgment on the quality of a specific product. Rather, the output of eddy current-based instruments is only used for qualitative analysis, such as "this batch of steel bars is generally worse than the batch produced last week," in the Reducing Process for process control purposes, for example, only.<br>
Another approach attempted in the art employs ultrasonic sensing. This is an approach to replace the eddy current sensors with ultrasonic ones. However, many of the restrictions associated with eddy current-based instruments, such as the short working distance, apply with equal force.<br>
Other inspection technologies used in the art include magnetic penetrant, circumflux, and infrared imaging with induction heating. The use of these technologies, however, is restricted. First, these techniques can only be used on "cold" metal bars. That<br><br>
is, these technologies cannot be used for in-line inspection during or shortly after hot rolling applications. Also, the metal bars must be descaled before inspection. In addition, the use of magnetic penetrant is messy and cumbersome. This process typically relies on human observation with ultra violet illumination, instead of automatic imaging and detection. The circumflux device is an eddy-current based unit, designed with a rotating detection head. Such rotating mechanism limits the application of this device in metal bar inspection with high traveling speeds, typically used at about 3 m/s. Such device is also expensive due to the moving sensing head design. The combination of induction heating and infrared imaging is based on the fact that induction current is only formed on the surface of the metal bar, and the surface defects on the metal bar will result in higher electrical resistance. Therefore, the spots with surface defects will heat up faster than other areas. There are issues associated with this approach in that (a) such faster heat up is a transient effect and thus timing (time to take images) is very critical; and (b) infrared sensors are not available for very high data rates and therefore cannot support metal bars with high traveling speed. Of course, inspection is possible after manufacture of the metal bars. However, post-manufacturing inspection often is not possible because the product is so long and coiled up, making the bar surfaces not accessible for cold inspection technologies.<br>
Currently, real-time inspection of metal bars manufactured with Reducing Processes is very limited. Metal bars are generally shipped from the manufacturer to the customer even if defective signals are posted by a conventional in-line eddy current inspection system. Customer complaints may therefore appear 5 to 6 months later due to surface defects on the metal bar products that are not immediately apparent to the customer. Such complaints cost the metal bar suppliers (i.e., manufacturers). The metal bar suppliers will either refund the customers for the entire coil/batch or cost share the expenses of additional labor to inspect the parts made out of the metal bar coil/batch.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,635,111 issued to Moore entitled "OPTICAL FIBER INSPECTION SYSTEM" operates in a discontinuous mode where a first step, one that involves the movement of the work piece to be imaged (i.e., the nuclear fuel pellets), and<br><br>
a second step, one that involves the imaging of such a worlc piece, are interleaved. Moore does not meet the limitations referred to above regarding a system "for imaging an elongated bar extending and moving.... (ii) Imaging "a first predetermined width of said bar while said bar is moving", nor (iii) "a computing unit... configured to receive image data for a plurality of image belts acquired by said image acquisition assembly as said bar moves because it does not perform these functions while the workpiece is moving.<br>
US. Patent 5,654,977 to Morris in combination to the system of Moore does not cure the basic failure of Moore to teach a system for imaging a moving bar, as defined in the various recitations set out above<br>
There is therefore a need for an apparatus and method to minimize or eliminate one or more of the problems set forth above.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is one object of the present invention to overcome one or more of the aforementioned problems associated with conventional approaches for an imaging-based apparatus suitable to be used in-line or off-line to detect surface defects on rolled/drawn metal bars.<br>
The present invention is directed to solving one or more of the problems associated with conventional metal bar inspection systems as well as problems associated with applying metal flat inspection systems to metal bars for non-destructive inspection of surface defects on metal bars through the use of an imaging system.<br>

as well as those subject to rotation relative to a longitudinal axis and may potentially be traveling at a very high speed. Others advantages of the present invention include (i) effectively employed to image and detect defects on non-flat surfaces; (ii) use for inspecting metal bars regardless of its temperatiHe; (ni) use for inspecting metal bars traveling at speeds at or faster than 100 m/s; (iv) pJxm<si sa incre waking distance to the metal bar surface thus minimizing or eliminating problems set forth in background for eddy-cuirent based instruments providing an output comprising quantitative data with verifiable defective site images inspection of workpiece even before scale forms on its suitable use at any stage reducing stands end line process not affected by relying upon transient effects real-time near quauty information a systan absent moving sensing heads components and system needing only very small gap than mm enable operating between guiding conduit sections. however apparatus method need have every one foregoing advantages majority them. invaition being limited appended claims.></si>

Figure 1 is a simplified schematic and block diagram of a system in accordance with<br>
the present invention.   Figure 1 shows line light assembly which may include at least one<br><br>
light source 2, a light conduit 4, a pluraUty of line Hghts 6 and a corresponding plurahty of optical boosters 8. Figure 1 further shows a computing unit 10 and an image acquisition assembly that may include a plurality of cameras 12 each having a corresponding lens 14.<br>
With continued reference to Hgnre 1, a woifc&gt;iece or object under inspection, such as an elongated metal bar 16 extending akmg a kmgfiadns^ irrig^ is shown moving along its longitudinal direction 20 at a speed up to 100 m/s or faster while bar 16 is going through a reducing process. The metal bar 16 may be formed from one selected from the group comprising steel, stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, nickel, copper, bronze, or any other metal, and/or their alloys. The bar 16 may be solid or hollow. Typically such metal bar 16 is traveling inside a conduit, as shown in greater detail as conduit 24 in Figure 5, not shown in Figure 1. A gq) 26, shown in Figure 5, is defined between two adjacent conduits 24, and is typically very small, for exan^ile betweai about 20 to 50 mm taken in the axial direction for high-speed transit of metal bars 16. It should be undastood titiat metal bar 16 may be at an elevated temperature, for example as hot as 1,100° C for a hot rolling process. It should also be appreciated that metal bar 16, given its geometry, is prone to twist/rotate about its longitudinal axis in the direction indicated by arrow 21 in Figure 1 when it travels in direction 20. This possibility for rotation has, among oiher items, presented problems for conventional imaging systems. As will be described in greato- detail below, the present invention overcomes this problem to provide an imaging system that is robiist to twisting and/or rotation.<br>
In order to detect surface defects on bar 16, an imaging system in accordance with the present invention must be provided having certain features, as described below. With continued reference to Figure 1, the imaging system includes an image acquisition assembly that preferably comprises n imaging cameras 12, \\^erein n is an integer 3 or greater. The parameter n  is selected to be three or higher based on an analysis set forth below.   Each<br><br>
camera 12 is arranged so as to cover a circumferential span of at least 120° in order to image the entire surface of bar 16. That is, the image acquisition assembly has a composite or combined field of view configiired to image the entire circumference of the sirrface of the bar 16 to define an image belt 18. As furfer described below, the image acquisition assembly is further configured to produce image data based on the image belt 18. The analysis for the parameter n for the nimiber of cameras will now be set forth.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, a regular lens 14 associated with camera 12 will have a viewing angle (field of view) formed by the two tangential lines of sight 28 extending from a focal point of lens 14 to the surface of bar 16. This viewing angle, wheal projected onto a non-flat surface, such as the one shown in Figure 6, will restdt in a circumferential coverage 30 that is less than 180° and will be insufficient to cover 360° with only two lens/camera units where the lens are not telecentric.<br>
Figure 7 shows an arrangement with a telecentric lens 14'. A true telecentric lens, which collects lines of sight that are in parallel, even if used, would not practically provide for a two-lens/camera system because of arc length variation. In particular, the lines of sight 28 are parallel with the addition of telecentric lens 14' to lens 14. In this case, the circumferential coverage 30 is 360°. Theoretically speaking, the entire surface of round shaped bar 16 can be covered using only two lens/camera units. However, as alluded to above, a problem of non-uniform pixel sizes arises.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 8, the evenly spaced lines of sight 34, as derived firom an evenly-spaced imaging sensor 32 having a plurality of pixels, can result in an uneven arc length 36 on the surface of bar 16, pixel-to-pixel. Even spacing is a very typical arrangement on an imaging sensor such as a CCD chip. The arc length 36 can be calculated using equation (1) as follows:<br>
EQN(l):        S = p/cos(θ)<br><br>
where S is the arc length 36 mapped to the pixel in position y, p is the pitch of the pixel array or the pixel size, and 9 is the projected angle that can be derived from<br>
EQN (2):	9 = arcsin (y / r), in which y 
From Figure 8 one can learn that as y —»• r, 9 —*■ 90°. As 9 —* 90°, S the arc length 36 will approach infinity based on EQN (1). Jn reality, S wiD saU. be a finite number. However, S will be substantially (several times) larger than p, the pixel size. That is, the image resolution in this area will deteriorate so much that this approach is infeasible. Note that the same arc length analysis can be applied to the bottom half in Figure 8, in which case y —&gt; -r.<br>
With three cameras, 9 can be established at 60°. What 9 = 60°, S the arc length 36 (at the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions in Figure 8) is only 2p, an acceptable and controllable deterioration in image resolution. If better image resolution is desired, four cameras or five cameras, or even more may be used {i.e., the parameter referred to above can be an integer equal to foiff, five or greater). All the lens 14/camera 12 combinations, as illustrated in Figure 1, are preferably arranged such that all such lens/camera combinations are positioned along a circular path 22 that is concentric to the circular geometry of the exemplary metal bar 16 such that the working distances, the distance firom each lens 14 to the nearest metal surface, are the same or nearly the same for all the lans/camera combinations. Note that the path 22 may stay circular if the metal bar is non-circular, say a hexagon, for the purpose of generally serving the same manufacturing line. One that is skilled in the art can appreciate that the path 22 can, if desired, be made to conform to the actual bar geometry.<br>
In order to accommodate the potentially very high traveling speed of the metal bar 16, high data rate cameras 12 are preferably used. The cameras 12 in the system are thus preferably digital cameras, with digital outputs to computing imit 10. This digital output format is desirable to accommodate the harsh environment for signal fidelity. This digital format image  signal  may be  received by the  computing unit   10  through  standard<br><br>
communication channels such as IEEE-1394 (also known as Fire Wire), Camera Link or USB ports, or a special interface known as a frame grabber. Each camera 12 preferably is able to generate 10,000,000 (or 10 Mega) pixels per second such that a defect feature that is 0.025 mm X 0.5 mm can be identified. It should be appreciated, however, that to detect larger features, a reduced resolution, and hence reduced data rate (in pixel per second) would be required. Line scan cameras are preferred even though progressive (non-interlaced) area scan cameras can be used, when the bar 16 is not traveling fast. Line scan cameras have an advantage over area scan cameras in that line scan cameras only require a line of illumination, instead of an area of illumination. This will simplify the illumination complexity earned by the non-flat surface. In the case of using line scans, all the cameras in Figure 1 will be aligned such that their imaging lines will be forming a circumferential ring, an image belt 18, on bar 16. This alignment is necessary to address the issue of twist and/or rotation (item 21). If this alignment is not held, the twisting or rotating motion can result in incomplete coverage of the bar surface.<br>
Referencing back to Figure 1 again, each camera will have a lens 14 to collect light reflected from the bar surface, Telecentric lenses (lenses that collect parallel image light rays, as illustrated with Figure 7) are prefored for a more uniform arc length distribution, even though regular lenses can be used. In addition, cameras 12 may be configured to include a lens iris to control exposure, and further, preferably configured (if included) with the use of a predetermined lens iris setting for improved depth of focus/field in the application.<br>
With continued reference to Figure 1, the imaging system according to the present invention also includes a line light assembly configured to project a light line belt onto the surface of the metal bar 16. Preferably, the Hne light assembly includes a plurality of line lights 6. These line lights 6 can be individual light sources, such as lasers, or Hght deUvery<br><br>
devices, such as optical fiber lights, as shown in Figure 1. The light delivery devices must work with at least one light source, as shown ia Figure 1. More than one light source can be used if higher light density is needed for illumination. For metal bars 16 that travel at very high speed, the cameras may be light starved due to very high line/firame rates equating to a relatively short exposure time. An optical booster 8 may therefore be used for each hne hght to concentrate the light and increase The light  intensity. This booster 8 can be a cylindrical lens or a semi-cylindrical lens. To use the imaging system in accordance with the present invention for metal bars 16 that are at an elevated temperature, the Une lights and the boosters must be made of special materials configured to withstand such elevated temperatures. Each hne Ught 6, for example, may be configured to have its own glass window to serve this purpose. In the case of optical fiber line U^it, the material tiiat binds the fibers together must be able to withstand high temperature, such as tiie high temperature epoxy. The boosters 8 must be made of materials that can withstand higji temparature, too. Usable materials include glass, Pyrex, cr3^tal, sapphire, and the like.<br>
Figure 9 is a top view of the preferred embodiment shown in Figure 1. To cope with light starving, the alignment between the line lights and the cameras is important. As illustrated in Figure 9, the surface of metal bar 16 after the reducing process, before, for example, a descaling process, can be treated as a reflective surface. Therefore, the optical law set forth in equation (3) ^phes:<br>
EQN (3):	"incident angle == reflective angle"<br>
EQN (3) is preferably used in a prefared embodiment to maximize the reflected tight that is c^tured by the plurality of cameras 12. The line lights 6 will each emit the light ray 40, which is boosted by a booster 8 and projected onto the surface of the metal bar 16. The light ray 40 is reflected to the path 42 and received by the lens 14 and eventually by the camera 12.   Note that in Figure 9, the metal bar 16 travels in the direction 20. The projected<br><br>
and reflected light rays 40 and 42 form an angle 44, equally divided by the normal line to the surface of the metal bar 16. This angle 44 must be as small as possible, due to the illumination problem described above that is associated with a non-flat surface, as illustrated in Figure 4. In Figure 4, the light line 18 and line image hne 18 will not overlap on a non-flat surface. The ideal case is for the and 44 in Figure 9 to be CP. As this is only possible by using a beam splitter, it is less practical to do so when the system is light starving due to inherent power losses imposed by using a beam splitter for example. The highest efficiency a beam splitter can achieve is 25%, assuming a 0% transmission loss. Therefore, the angle 44 is preferably selected so as to be reasonably small, such as 1° or in its neighborhood. If necessary, a reflective mirror 38 can be used to assist in packing the camera and the light for a small angle 44. This is another reason to use line scan cameras in this application. Line scan cameras only need an image path 42 with a small width, such as from 5 to 30 microns. The angle 44 can be kept very small with this small image path feature.<br>
Figure 10 shows in greater detail a portion of the lighting setup of Figure 9. As mentioned above, the angle 44 will not be 0 degrees unless a beam splitter is used. Therefore, each line light 6 must have a substantial width W (item 41 in Figure 10). One can see that in Figure 10 the metal bar 16 has a centerline 46. The line 48 indicates the 60° mark on the bar surface, starting from the tangential boundary on the left hand side of the bar, as shown in Figure 10, and increasing to the right One camera must be able to image the metal bar 16 for the upper half to this 60° mark line 48. In a three-camera embodiment, the above calculations apply. If more cameras are used, the line 48 may represent 45° for a four-camera system, at 36° for a five-camera system, and so forth. If designed symmetrically, the camera can also image the bottom half of the metal bar 16 for 60°. In order to achieve this coverage, the light line width W must be greater than a threshold based on:<br>
EQN (4): W &gt; 2 • r • (1 - cos60°) • sina<br><br>
in which r is the bar radius and a is the incident angle (half of the angle 44). The 60° can be replaced by another angle if a different numbers of cameras other than three are used in the inventive imaging system. This notion is further illustrated in Figure 11, in which the image line 42 is clearly curved differently, yet covered by the H^t line 40. In other words, the image acquisition assembly (e.g., the ptarality of cameras in the preferred embodiment) captures an image belt 18 having a first predetermined width over the entire circumference of the surface of the bar 16. The line light assembly (e.g., the plurality of line light sources in the preferred embodiment) projects a light line belt onto the surface of the bar 16 having a second predetermined width. The line light assembly is disposed and aligned relative to the image acquisition assembly such the image belt falls within the light line belt. Through the foregoing, the problem of non-flat surfaces is ova-come.<br>
Additionally, these line lights must be positioned such that the light intensity as reflected from a point on the bar surface to the camera that covers that point is uniform for all the points on the image belt 18 (Figure 1). A more detailed illustration is shown in Figure 12. All the illumination must follow the law described in EQN (3). Figure 12 illustrates this arrangement for one camera. It should be appreciate that such arrangement may be duplicated for other cameras used in the inventive imaging system. Based on EQN (3), the angle formed by the incident light ray 40 and the reflected light ray 42 must be evenly divided by the surface normal 50. As in Figure 12, an illuminator 52 preferably includes a curved surface. Illuminator 52 is a device whose emitted Hght rays (perpendicular to this curved surface at the point of emission) will be reflected by the surface of the bar 16 to the imaging sensor in camera 12 and lens 14 based on EQN (3). Note that curve 52 need not be a circular curve. This curve 52 depends on the distance between the curve 52 and the surface of the bar 16 (i.e., target). Curve 52 may not be a smooth curve if the bar is not circular. Even though an illuminator with curve 52 can be made with modem technologies, such<br><br>
illuminator can only be used with bars 16 at the designated diameter. In some apphcations it is not practical. An alternative is to simulate such illumination effect with an array of light lines 6 and 8, as shown in Figure 12. Each combiuation of light line/booster can be made adjustable such that its direction can be re-pointed as shown by item 54 to accommodate targets with different diameters. The light line approach is also beneficial in the case that the bar 16 is not circular.<br>
Referencing back to Figure 1, a computing unit 10 is coupled to plurality of cameras 12. The computing unit 10 is configured to receive the image data for a pluraUty of image belts 18 acquired successively by the cameras 12 as the bar 16 moves along the longitudiaal axis in the direction 20 (direction 20 best shown in Figure 1). Frame grabbers may be used to receive the image signals. The cameras 12 in the system, howevra-, are preferably digital cameras, as described above. The computing unit may comprise one or more computers in order to have enough confuting power to process the image data. Image processing hardware may be used in conjimction with the software for fester computing speed. If multiple computers are used, these computers can be Uiiked together through inter-computer Unks such as TCP/IP or the like.<br>
In auy event, computing unit 10 is configured to process the image data to detect predetermined features of the surface of bar 16. In a preferred embodiment, the features are surface defects. Thus, the image data will be processed for defects, such defects being shown in exemplary fashion in Figures 13A-13B. The images typically contain both the real defects {e.g., item 302) and noise, such as scratch marks (e.g., item 304). Image processing algorithms, implemented in computer codes such as C, C++, machine languages, and the like, or implemented in hardware logic, are used to filter out the noise, and to detect tiie tme defects, as shown in 306. The defects to be identified can be long and have a large aspect ratio, as shown in Figures 14A - 14C, where item 308 may be 1000 mm long, and item 310<br><br>
may indicate a width of 0.050 mm. Or, the defects can be short and have a nearly 1-to-l aspect ratio, as shown in Figures 15A-15C. These algorithms are known in the art, but will be described generally. A first layer of processing may involve a comparison of local contrast in the image, such as by comparing a first predetermined threshold to the local contrast. A second layer of processing naay involve applying a second predetermined threshold to detect the nature of the defect such as size, location, length and width and the like.<br>
The preferred embodiment described and illustrated in connection with Figure 1 will also have protection against dust, water, vibrations, and other damagiag factors in a typical metal process plant such as a hot rolling mill or a cold drawing mill.<br>
Those skilled in the art shall appreciate the possibility of further restrain the bar and separately using three or more single-camera systems in the reducing process line for inspection.<br>
Those skilled in the art shall also ^jpreciate tirnt covering (e.g., inspection of ) a portion of tiie bar surface less than the entire circxmiference may be useful enough for statistical process control purpose in the reducing process line.<br>
Those skilled in the art shall also understand that a very high speed (high data rate and higji jframe rate) area scan camera can be used in place of the line scan cameras if only a certain portion of each of the area scan images is used for processing.<br>
One can also understand that if the metal bars are at an elevated temperature, an optical filter can be used in conjunction with ttie lens such that only certain wavelengths in the reflected light rays 42 (in Figure 12) will be used to carry the surface information of the metal bars. Such wavelengths are those not emitted or not dominantly emitted by the metal bars at the said elevated temperature. For metal bars at or colder than 1,650° C, the wavelength 436 nm can be used.  In this case, an interference filter at 436 nm will be used<br><br>
with the lens. This wavelength can vary with the temperature. If the temperature decreases, longer wavelength can be used.<br>
In a still further variation, the light line assembly may be configured to include a strobe light, wherein the computing unit 10 synchronizes the illumination (i.e., the strobing) with the image capture function performed by the image acquisition assembly {e.g., the cameras 12 in the preferred embodiment).<br>
In a yet still further embodiment, the computing unit 10 is configured to maintain a running record of the detected defects, including (i) a respective location of each detected defect relative to a "start" position, such as the leading end, on me bar 16 being manufactured through processes that mechanically reduce the cross-sectional area of the metal bars; (ii) a respective notation of the nature of the detected defect, such as the size, shape, contrast; and (iii) optionally, an actual image of the site of and surrounding the detected defect. The record may be useful to the supplier/manufacturer, for example, for determining an up-front discount, and may be provided to the customer {e.g., on a diskette or other electronic means) for use in further processing, for example, what portions of the coil to avoid or do follow-up work on.<br><br><br>
