				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to nitric oxide releasing derivatives of paracetamol The present invention particularly relates to novel nitrate esters of paracetamol The present invention pertains to process of preparation of nitrate esters of paracetamol More particularly, the invention relates to nitric oxide releasing derivatives of paracetamol which show better analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities and decreased liver toxicities as apparent from their biochemical and histopathologic profile<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Paracetamol (paracetamol, 1) is among most commonly used analgesics  It effectively reduces fever and mild-to moderate pain, and is regarded, in general, as a very safe drug Nevertheless, overdose (deliberate) is a common cause of hepatic injury, accounting for ~ 40% of cases of acute liver failure in the USA [Wu, C C Nitric oxide and inflammation Curr Med Chem - Anti-inflammatory &amp; anti-allergy agents, 2004, 3, 217-222, Joshi, G P NCX-701 NicOx Curr Opin Investig Drugs, 2004, 5, 755-759, and Moore, P K, Marshall, M  Nitric oxide releasing paracetamol (nitroparacetamol)   Dig  Liver Dis, 2003, 35 ] It is an effective analgesic and antipyretic agent and unlike other NSAIDs (Non-steroidal  Anti-inflammatory  Drugs)  has  been reported to have  little antiinflammatory effects       [ Fiorucci, S , Antonelh, E , Mencarelh, A , Palazzetti, B , Alvarez-Miller, L , Muscara, M , del Soldato, P , Sanpaolo, L , Wallace, J L , Morelh, A A NO-releasing  derivative  of paracetamol  spares  the  liver  by  acting  at  several checkpoints  in the  Fas pathway   Br   J   Pharmacol,  2002,   135,  589-599 ]  It  is metabolized in liver by three pathways-glucuromdation, sulfonation (both accounting for 95% of metabolism) or via cytochrome P450 enzyme system (5%) in which it is converted to a toxic metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoqumone lmine, 2) which further is rendered harmless through an interaction with the endogenous antioxidant glutathione<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
But overproduction of this toxic metabolite leads to depletion of glutathione stores in liver and further accumulation of the toxic metabolite causes tissue injury and cell death [ Futter, L E, al-Swayeh, O A, Moore, P K A comparison of the effect of nitroparacetamol and paracetamol on liver injury Br J Pharmacol, 2000, 132, 10-12 ] Numerous derivatives of paracetamol have been synthesized to get a safer non-hepatotoxic drug One of the major achievements has been by Nocox in Italy It has designed NCX-701 (3) by adding NO moiety to paracetamol, via an aliphatic spacer to improve the anti-inflammatory activity of paracetamol, based on the well-demonstrated activity of NO on cytokine synthesis and regulation of proinflammatory mediators [Wallace, J L Paracetamol hepatotoxicity NO to the rescue Br J Pharmacol, 2004,143, 1-2 ]<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
NO may modulate spinal and sensory neuron excitability through multiple mechanisms that may improve the anti-nociceptive activity of paracetamol The pharmacological profile of NCX 701 has been reviewed [ Marshall, M , Moore, P K Effect of nitric oxide releasing paracetamol and flurbiprofen on cytokine production in human blood Eur J Pharmacol, 2004, 483, 317-322, and al-Swayeh, O A, Futter, L E, Clifford, R H, Moore, P K Nitroparacetamol exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activity Br J Pharmacol, 2000, 130, 1453-1456] Compared with NSAIDs, paracetamol possesses little anti-inflammatory activity in humans and it does not induce damage of<br>
the gastric mucosa, but it could cause liver damage (or even poisoning) when used in high dosage The aim of coupling paracetamol with NO has, therefore, been to improve its anti-inflammatory activity, and also to exploit the cytoprotective properties of NO to reduce potential liver damage Concerning safety, several studies have highlighted the liver sparing profile of NCX 701 compared to paracetamol The beneficial protective effect on the liver has been supposed to be related to the fact that NO can reduce the synthesis of several pro-inflammatory cytokines [ Wallace, J L Paracetamol hepatotoxicity NO to the rescue Br J Pharmacol, 2004, 143, 1-2] The antiinflammatory activity related to NO release has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, [Marshall, M , Moore, P K Effect of nitric oxide releasing paracetamol and flurbiprofen on cytokine production in human blood Eur J Pharmacol, 2004, 483, 317-322 , al-Swayeh, O A, Futter, L E, Clifford, R H, Moore, P K Nitroparacetamol exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activity Br J Pharmacol, 2000, 130, 1453-1456, AND, Paul Clark, M J, Howat, D , Flower, R J, Moore, P K , Perretti, M Nitroparacetamol (NCX-701) exhibits anti-inflammatory activity in the zymosan air pouch Inflamm Res, 2001, 50, S158]demonstrating that NCX 701 is not only a safer drug than paracetamol, but that it also possesses a wider action due to additive mechanisms Several papers have compared the anti-nociceptive activity of NCX 701 versus paracetamol, [Romero-Sandoval, E A , Mazano, J, Howat, D , Herrero, J F NCX-701 (nitroparacetamol) is an effective antinociceptive agent in rat withdrawal reflexes and wind-up Br J Pharmacol, 2002, 135, 1556-1562 , Romero-Sandoval, A E, Del Soldato, P , Herrero, J F The effects of sham and full spinahzation on the antinociceptive effects of NCX-701 (nitroparacetamol) in monoarthritic rats Neuropharmacology, 2003, 45, 412-419 , and Gaitan, G , Del Soldato, P , Herrero, J F Low doses of nitroparacetamol or dexketoprofen trometamol enhance fentanyl antinociceptive activity Eur J Pharmacol, 2003, 481, 181-188 ] regularly showing the superiority of NCX 701 Moreover, sub-effective doses of NCX 701 have enhanced the anti-nociceptive activity of the u-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl A Phase II study clinical trial has demonstrated that lg NCX 701 provides similar analgesic efficacy to paracetamol lg in post-operative dental pain, therefore with a reduced exposure to<br>
paracetamol, confirming a contribution of NO to the anti-nociceptive mechanisms of NCX 701<br>
O-Dealkylation of a homologous series of alkoxy acetanihdes [p-methoxy, p-ethoxy phenacetin, p-(n)-propoxy- and p-(n)-butoxy acetanihdes, 4-7] have shown to release paracetamol<br>
The compounds (6 and 7) were structurally related to phenacetin (5), and were synthesized to check whether they release paracetamol (1) upon O-dealkylation, which they did The chain length in the synthesized compounds was varied to study the effect of chain lengthening on the rate of release of paracetamol<br>

There was a need to develop the novel molecules which are having better analgesic and antnnflamatory activity The advantages of the present invention are that these NO releasing compounds have shown better analgesic and antiinflammatory activity than the parent drug, and less liver toxicity in biochemical and histopathological studies<br>

Overproduction of this toxic metabolite 2 leads to depletion of glutathione stores in liver<br>
and further accumulation of the toxic metabolite causes tissue injury and cell death Enzymes like alkaline phosphatase (ALP, EC 3 13 1), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (EC 2 6 12) and the total proteins are considered as plasma markers of liver injury Nitric oxide releasing paracetamol derivatives 12 and 13 were evaluated for their effect on the markers of liver injury like enzymes ALP and SGPT/ALT The plasma level of these enzymes is found to<br>
increase in the case of liver toxicity The graph indicates that the rise (with comparison to the basal value) in the case of 1 is much more than in the case of NO releasing derivatives 12 and 13, showing that they cause lesser liver toxicity than the parent drug paracetamol 1<br>
Histopathology (FIG 5 Sheet No 3)For liver histopathology, the livers were removed and portions were fixed in 10% buffered formalin (pH 7 4) They were then processed by standard histopathological techniques, stained with Haematoxyhn and Eosin (H&amp;E), and examineed for morphologic evaluation for liver injury<br>
