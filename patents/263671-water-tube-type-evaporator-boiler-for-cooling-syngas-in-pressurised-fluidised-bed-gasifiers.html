INVENTION	<br>
'This invention relates to integrated gasification based power generation; in particular pressurized fluidized bed gasification based systems capable of using any grade of coals. More particularly; the invention relates to an improved water type evaporator for cooling and recovering heat from the syngas in pressurized<br>
  fluidized bed gasification systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Pressurised Fluidised Bed gasification is increasingly being used in combine.cycle plants to generate electricity through integrated gasification and for other applications. Such combined cycle plants are capable of using various grades of low calorific value and high ash content coals.<br>
In a refractory lined pressurized fluidized bed gasifier, a mixture of air and steam is introduced through a distributor located at a bottom of the gasifier. Coal is continuously injected to the gasifier through ejector using compressed air. Coal: gas also called 'fuel gas' is produced due to the chemical reaction of coal with air and steam. The fly ash and unbrurit carbon particles in fuel gas are separated by a serially arranged cyclones. The coal gas at the exit of the cyclone is cooled in a Heat Recovery Boiler (HRB). The gas is further cooled in an Economiser. Part of the steam is utilized for gasification process and the rest expands in the steam turbine to generate electricity. The gas is further processed in a gas cleaning system and admitted to a combustion chamber of a gas turbine to generate electricity.<br><br>
One of the existing clean coal technology options is the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) method of power generation.<br>
In such plants, the syngas from the gasifier leaving the cyclones at around 950 -1000°C is cooled by heat recovery units before the syngas is sent to the gas clean up system and then to the gas turbine or for other uses. Generally an evaporator (boiler) is arranged to face the hot gas, followed by an economizer. The existing arrangement adopts a shell type heat exchanger with gas flow through tubes and water /steam mixture on the shell side. With the increase in size of the gasifier, the shell size normally increase. With the increase in pressure of the steam / water mixture (as proposed for larger plants to improve efficiency), the shell thickness and hence weight increases. In some cases it may lead to multiple units in parallel. The thickness of tube sheets also, increases considerably, leading to complexity in design. Depending on the nature of ash, plugging of tube and shut down for cleaning are also experienced. Even when water tube arrangement is adopted the tubes are arranged in a circle and gas flow is allowed parallel to the tubes.<br>
US Patent No. 5253703 dated 19.10.1993, titled WASTE HEAT EXCHANGER' discloses a heat exchanger particularly adapted to handle dusty hot waste gases and is of the shell and tube type. This heat exchanger includes a vertically oriented shell through which the waste gases flow longitudinally with shell containing a tube assembly of vertical tubes having external, longitudinally extending heat transfer fins. Thus, particles may get deposited on the heat transfer surfaces due to fins.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved water type evaporator for cooling and recovering heat from the syngas in pressurized fluidized bed gasification systems.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an improved water type evaporator for cooling and recovering heat from the syngas in pressurized fluidized bed gasification systems which prevents the ash accumulation on heat transfer surfaces.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose an improved water type evaporator for cooling and recovering heat from the syngas in pressurized fluidized bed gasification systems which generates saturated steam for admission into the gasifler and generation of coal gas, the water/ steam mixture flowing" inside the tube and the gas flowing over the tubes;<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose an improved water type evaporator for cooling and recovering heat from the syngas in pressurized fluidized bed gasification systems, which is reliable and easy, to operate and        . maintain.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
- Figures 1(a), 1(b), 1(c) shows the assembled elevation, plan and side view of an improved water tube type evaporator for integrated gasification and combined cycle plant&gt; comprising a tube bundle (01) having a plurality of smaller diameter tubes arranged vertically with two rows connected to an inlet header (14) and an outlet header (07). The inlet headers (14) are connected to downcomer pipes (05) (supplying water from a drum) by a set of supply tubes (06). The steam water mixture from the outlet headers (07) are taken to the drum (not shown)<br><br>
by a set of riser pipes (08). The tubes bundle (01) with the headers (07,14) and supply tubes (06) and the riser pipes (08) are housed inside a shell (02A) having openings for the pipe connections including a gas inlet (09), a gas outlet (10) a, hopper (12) for ash collection, and a flanged end cover (02) with man hole (11).<br>
To protect the shell (02A) from direct contact with the hot gas, an enclosures is formed with the first and last row tubes (03,04) in the gas flow direction, with fins (13) between the tubes. The side enclosures are formed with a separate row of tubes (15,16) with the inlet and outlet headers (07,14) the supply and riser pipes (06,08) provided with fins between the tubes which forms. By connecting the panels to the first and last row of tubes (03, 04) in the gas flow direction a gas tight enclosure is formed. However the space between the outlet headers (07) is left for easy removal of the tubes for maintenance. This space is also used for continuity of pressure on the top side of the shell (02A) and hence pressure equalization. As a safety measure a thin layer of special refractory lining. on the inner side of the shell is also provided.<br>
