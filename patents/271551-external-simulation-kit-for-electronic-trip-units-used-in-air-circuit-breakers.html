EXTERNAL SIMULATION KIT FOR ELECTRONIC TRIP UNITS USED IN<br>
AIR CIRCUIT BREAKERS<br>
numbered as	dated<br>
A)	FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY:<br>
1.	The present invention relates generally to electronic units and particularly to electronic trip units and specifically to the design and use of external simulation kit for electronic trip units. The present invention also describes the provisions to keep the trip details type of test, test settings, trip time are stored in one kit.<br>
B)	DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART:<br>
2.	This invention relates to a design and use of external simulation kit for electronic trip units. The different fault conditions such as overload, short Circuit (I2T On &amp; Off), instantaneous, and earth faults (I2T On &amp; Off) are simulated by the kit for testing the electronic trip unit. This invention also has the capability to download the stored trip records of the trip units to the simulation kit and the data can be used for future analysis.<br>
3.	Air circuit breakers are commonly and are generally used in protecting high cost equipments from current faults. External simulation kit is used to test the electronic trip units by simulating the various fault conditions. Various fault conditions are generated by the simulation kit and provided to the trip unit to check the functionality of the trip unit under the simulated condition. With the help of menu navigation system (Keypad or/and LCD), user can select various trip unit simulation<br>
condition and levels. Based on the selected level the trip unit will respond to the simulation. Almost this external simulation kit is performing in a Power on Self-test and error condition. The errors detected are then displayed into the LCD monitor.<br>
4.	The main purpose of developing this external simulation kit is for testing the functionality of the electronic trip unit of circuit breakers. The entire series of trip units developed for circuit breakers can be tested. Every trip unit differs in their functionality for different current ranges with an unique characteristic of the specific trip unit. The simulation-kit provides a common platform for testing a range of individual performance shown by the trip unit.<br>
5.	The patent disclosed in this field has a testing method for all the fault conditions such as overload, short circuit, instantaneous and earth fault in a trip unit. These indicator functions signal when a short circuit, overload or ground fault occurred. Some of the patents disclosed also have a bypass circuit that insures that tripping of the breaker is not jeopardized by failure of the indicators.<br>
6.	However, as per the inventor's description there is no specific simulation kit as a feature, which offers multiple functionality of testing of circuit breakers under various fault conditions. And also many earlier inventions did not give a way to external simulation kit for electronic trip units individual phase faults like on which phase the fault occurred. There is a need for a simple, low cost, easy to maintain simulation kit for circuit breaker, which indicates the state of the breaker. The state of the breaker includes various fault conditions indication such as long time faults, short time faults, instantaneous faults and earth faults thereby increasing the precise method of finding the fault condition in a cheaper manner. <br>
C)	OBJECT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
7.	It is the primary object of the invention to invent a method of indication that utilizes external simulation kit for electronic trip units to the various faults such as overload, short circuit (I2T On &amp; Off), instantaneous fault and earth fault (I2T On &amp; Off).<br>
8.	It is another object of the invention is to invent a simulation kit that incorporates different faults conditions as on Power on Self-test. If the test fails, it shall be displayed on the LCD monitor.<br>
9.	It is another object of the invention to identify the trip records stored in the electronic trip unit, which can be downloaded to the external simulation kit and the data can be used for future analysis.<br>
10.	It is another object of the invention is to invent a method for generating test reports and are stored with the date &amp; time stamping of when the test was conducted along with the details of the tests (value &amp; settings) and with the corresponding unit identification number.<br>
11.	It is another object of the invention is to invent an external simulation kit with all functionalities controlled by a PC using a proprietary protocol.<br>
D)	PROPOSED SOLUTION:<br>
12.	We propose a novel design in the field of circuit breaker fault identification by simulating the fault conditions and visualizing these faults stored into external simulation kit. We propose a simulation kit for testing circuit breakers in the field of power distribution system, which protect the system against various faults such as overload, short-circuit, instantaneous and earth fault.<br>
13.	This External Simulation kit has a user interface consisting of a Keypad (7 keys: up, down, left, right, esc, enter, test) &amp; a LCD Display (2 XI6 alphanumeric display). It has 10 user configurable set groups, which contains information such as trip unit type, type of test to be simulated, pick up value &amp; the time delay for the test. Also it is possible to set the trip unit settings to the factory default values using the simulation kit. Apart from conducting the trip test this simulation unit can also be used for the downloading of the trip records from the trip units so that further analysis can be done.<br>
14.	In LED indication it is not possible to differentiate on which phase exactly the fault has occurred. This invention enables the user to view the phase in which the fault has occurred through the multi color LED's. Basically these releases will be self- powered. Therefore even if the power is not be available for the trip unit the records are stored in the breaker, which has tripped.<br>
