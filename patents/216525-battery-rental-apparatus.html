In this charging apparatus, an isolation chamber for collecting and recovering or processing heat or gas generated during charging processing is provided at an uppermost portion of a support member on a tower of the apparatus and processing of heat generated when the secondary batteries are charged is performed.<br>
While the charging apparatus of the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Application No. Heisei 6-293251 is provided with an isolation chamber for collecting and recovering or processing heat or gas, it<br>
does not have means for keeping the secondary batteries to a predetermined preservation temperature against a variation of the ambient temperature or heat generated upon charging of the secondary batteries, and where the charging apparatus is installed outdoors, there is a subject that the temperature of the secondary batteries is excessively high or excessively low and this gives rise to deterioration of the performance of the secondary batteries and the efficiency in charging drops. [0005]<br>
Particularly, a battery rental apparatus for an electrically-operated vehicle is supposed to be installed outdoors from a utilization object of the same, and temperature control is demanded particularly since it is exposed to a high temperature environment under the direct rays of the sun or to a low temperature environment in the winter.<br>
[0006]<br>
In order to avoid such severe environmental (temperature) conditions, the battery rental apparatus should be arranged indoors.  However, where it is arranged indoors, there is a limitation to the location of a battery rental apparatus and to the number of battery rental apparatus to be installed, and there is a subject that the<br>
convenience for a user is deteriorated.<br>
Particularly, as a motor-assist bicycle which includes a removable battery propagates, it is demanded that a user can exchange a battery anywhere and at any time.<br>
This invention has been made to solve such subjects as described above, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a battery rental apparatus superior in convenience which can keep the preservation temperature of a battery within a fixed temperature range and can be installed at any place.<br>
