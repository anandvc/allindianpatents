				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Drive Device for Hybrid Vehicle<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to a drive device for a hybrid vehicle, and particularly to a drive device employed in a hybrid vehicle and having an inverter and a motor accommodated in one casing.<br>
Background Art<br>
In many of present hybrid vehicles, an inverter has a large box-shaped casing fixed to a chassis, and a motor casing (transaxle) is arranged under the casing.   When consideration is given to the drive device for a hybrid vehicle that can be mounted in as many types of vehicles as possible, it is difficult for the configuration having two casing to standardize parts of the device, since optimum arrangement of these casings is performed for each type of the vehicle.<br>
In principle, it is desired that the units to be combined for operation are accommodated in one casing and are integrated with each other.   Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2004-343845 (which will be referred to as the "Patent Document 1" hereinafter) has disclosed a drive device for a hybrid vehicle having a motor and an inverter integrated with each other.   In the Patent Document 1, a structure includes a drive device casing formed of a plurality of casing portions that are coupled together and accommodate electric motors, respectively, and a plurality of inverters corresponding to the respective electric motors.   In this structure, the plurality of inverters are collectively arranged in one of the above casing portions, and fluid passages for cooling the inventions are formed between the casing portion provided with the inverters and the respective inventions.   The above structure can integrate the inverters corresponding to the respective electric motors with the drive device and<br>
farther can achieve inverter cooling.<br>
However, in the drive device casing disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2004-343845 (Patent Document 1), the casing portions accommodating the respective motors are coupled to the casing portion accommodating the inverter. Therefore, in the structure of the drive device for the hybrid vehicle disclosed in the Patent Document 1, electromagnetic noises caused by a switching operation of a power element in the inverter are liable to leak through a coupling portion where the above casing portions are coupled together.   Therefore, countermeasures must be taken to prevent leakage of the electromagnetic noises through the coupling portion where the casing portion of the inverter is coupled to the other portions.   If the countermeasures are insufficient, leaked electromagnetic noises may adversely affect other equipment on the vehicle.<br>
Since the inverter is simply arranged on the motor in the above structure, the structure is susceptible to improvement in connection with a vertical position of a center of gravity of the vehicle carrying the drive device.   Further, sufficient consideration is not given to reduction in space required in the hybrid vehicle for arranging the drive device.   For allowing mounting of the drive device on many kinds of vehicles, it is desired that the inverters and the motors are arranged in a contour substantially equal to that of an automatic transmission that neighbors to an engine in an ordinary vehicle<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The invention has been made for overcoming the above problems, and an object of the invention is to prevent external leakage of electromagnetic noises from a drive device for a hybrid vehicle having an integrated inverter,<br>
A drive device for a hybrid vehicle according to the invention includes a power transmitting mechanism, a power control unit, a casing, a cover member and a fixing member,   The power transmitting mechanism combines a power generated by a rotational electric machine with a power generated by an internal combustion engine and<br>
providing the combined powers to a drive shaft.   The power control unit controls the rotational electric machine.   The casing has a first accommodating portion employed for accommodating the power control unit, and a second accommodating unit employed for accommodating at least the rotational electric machine and formed integrally with the first accommodating portion.   The cover member is fixed to the casing and covering an opening in the first accommodating portion<br>
According to the above drive device for the hybrid vehicle, since the casing portions (the first and second accommodating portions) for the power control unit and the rotational electric machine are integrally formed, a mating surface (a coupling portion) is not formed between the casing portions.   Therefore, the structure can suppress external leakage of the electromagnetic noises generated by the power control unit from the casing.   Accordingly, it is possible to reduce a cost required for countermeasures against leakage of the electromagnetic noises and to prevent external leakage of the electromagnetic noises from the drive device.<br>
Preferably, the drive device for the hybrid vehicle according to the invention further includes a damper coupled to a crankshaft of the internal combustion engine The rotational electric machine has a rotation axis matching with a rotation axis of the damper.   Further, the second accommodating portion is configured to accommodate the rotational electric machine, the damper and the power transmitting mechanism.   In a view obtained by projection in a direction perpendicular to a direction of the rotation axis and perpendicular to a vertical direction in a vehicle-mounted state, the first accommodating portion is arranged such that the power control unit is located within a horizontal size, in the vehicle-mounted state, of the second accommodating portion<br>
In the above drive device for the hybrid vehicle, the horizontal size of the drive device can be kept small so that a volume or sizes of the drive device can be small, and vehicle-mountability can be improved.<br>
Preferably, in the drive device for the hybrid vehicle according to the invention, the power control unit further includes a circuit board that carries a power element of an<br>
inverter arranged corresponding to the rotational electric machine and is arranged above the rotational electric machine in a vehicle-mounted state.<br>
According to the above drive device for the hybrid vehicle, the first accommodating unit accommodates the circuit board that carries the power element generating electromagnetic noises, and thereby achieves the structure that can effectively prevent external leakage of the electromagnetic noises from the casings.<br>
Preferably, in the drive device for the hybrid vehicle according to the invention, the power control unit includes an inverter arranged corresponding to the rotational electric machine, and a voltage converter configured to generate an input voltage of the inverter.   The voltage converter includes a reactor arranged on one side of a rotation axis of the rotational electric machine, and a capacitor arranged on the other side of the rotation axis of the rotational electric machine<br>
According to the above drive device for the hybrid vehicle, the capacitor and the reactor, which are components of the voltage converter, can be arranged using spaced on one and the other sides of the rotational electric machine, respectively.   Therefore, the required space and therefore the sizes of the drive device can be reduced, and a weight balance with respect to the rotational electric machine can be improved.<br>
In the above structure, the power control unit further includes a circuit board having at least a portion arranged in a region between the reactor and the capacitor, and carrying a power element of the inverter and the voltage converter<br>
According to the above drive device for the hybrid vehicle, the circuit board can be arranged not to overlap the reactor and the capacitor when viewed in the vertical direction in the vehicle-mounted state.    Therefore, it is possible to prevent increase in size in the vehicle height direction of the drive device that may be caused by the arrangement of the circuit board.   Thereby, a center of the vehicle can be low, and drive stability can be improved.<br>
Preferably, the drive device for the hybrid vehicle according to the invention further includes a damper coupled to a crankshaft of the internal combustion engine.<br>
The rotational electric machine has a rotation axis matching with a rotation axis of the damper.   Further, in a view obtained by projection in a direction of the rotation axis, the power control unit is arranged in the casing such that the power control unit is located within a horizontal size, in a vehicle-mounted state, of a projected portion of a portion accommodating the damper, the rotational electric machine and the power transmitting mechanism.<br>
According to the above drive device for the hybrid vehicle, the size thereof in the front-back direction of the vehicle can be reduced, and the drive device can be compact<br>

Motor generator MG2 operates as an electric power generator producing an electromotive force between the opposite ends of three-phase coil 39 by an interaction<br>
between the magnetic field of the permanent magnets and the rotation of rotor 37 Motor generator MG2 also operates as an electric motor driving and rotating rotor 3 7 by an interaction between the magnetic field formed by the permanent magnets and the magnetic field formed by three-phase coil 34.<br>
Reducer RD performs the speed reduction by the structure in which a planetary carrier 66, i.e., one of the rotary elements of the planetary gear is fixed to the casing of the vehicle drive device.   More specifically, speed reducer RD includes a sun gear 62 coupled to the shaft of rotor 37, a ring gear 68 rotating together with ring gear 52 and a pinion gear 64 that meshes with ring gear 68 and sun gear 62 for transmitting the rotation of sun gear 62 to ring gear 68.<br>

Reactor LI is arranged on one side of the rotation axis of motor generators MG1 and MG2, and capacitor C2 is arranged on the other side of the rotation axis. Power element board 120 is arranged in a region between capacitor C2 and reactor LI Motor generator MG2 is arranged under power element board 120.<br>
Power element board 120 carries inverter 22 controlling motor generator MG1, inverter 14 controlling motor generator MG2 and an arm unit 13 of the booster converter.<br>
Power supply bus bars that are stacked vertically are arranged in a region between inverters 14 and 22.   The bus bars extend from U-, V- and W-phase arms 15, 16 and 17 of inverter 14 to terminal base 116 connected to the stator coil of motor generator MG2, respectively.   Likewise, the three bus bars extend from inverter 22 to terminal base 118 connected to the stator coil of motor generator MG1.<br>
Since power element board 120 is liable to be hot, a water passage is arranged under power element board 120 for cooling it, and casing 102 is provided with cooling water inlet 114 and outlet 112 of the water passage.   These inlet and outlet are formed by driving union nuts into casing 102 through flanges 106 and 105<br>
The voltage supplied from battery unit 40 in Fig. 1 through the power cables to terminals 43 and 44 is boosted by booster converter 12 including reactor LI and arm unit 13, is smoothed by capacitor C2 and is supplied to inverters 14 and 22.<br>
By using the battery voltage boosted by booster converter 12, it is possible to reduce the battery voltage to about 200 V and further to drive the motor generator with a high voltage exceeding 500 V so that the electric loss can be suppressed owing to the<br>
power supply with a small current and, at the same time, a high output of the motor can be achieved.<br>
For additionally integrating booster converter 12 as drive device 20 together with inverters 14 and 22 as well as motor generators MG1 and MG2, consideration must be given to positions of arrangement of reactor LI and capacitor C2 that are relatively large parts.<br>
The power elements (IGBT elements) arranged on power element board 120 generate electromagnetic noises due to the switching operation for power conversion Therefore, a structure is required for leaking the electromagnetic noises externally from the casing of drive device 20.<br>
Fig. 5 conceptually illustrates the structure for preventing the leakage of the electromagnetic noises in the drive device according to the embodiment of the invention Fig. 5A shows a comparative example similar to that disclosed in the foregoing Patent Document 1 and specifically shows an example of the leakage preventing structure for the electromagnetic noises in the hybrid vehicle drive device integrated with the inverter Fig. 5B shows the structure according to the embodiment of the invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5 A, the drive device of the comparative example includes a casing member CSl forming an accommodating space MS for the motor generators and a casing member CS2 forming an accommodating space IS for the power control unit such as inverters, and these casing members CSl and CS2 are produced independently of each other.   As shown in the figure, each of casing members CSl and CS2 requires an opening for taking out the bus bars or interconnections electrically connecting the inverters and the motor generators together.   Fixing members fx couple casing members CSl and CS2 together so that the drive device including the motor generators is integrated with the inverters.<br>
Casing member CS2 is provided at its upper portion with an opening for attaching the power control unit.   This opening is finally closed by a cover member CV coupled to casing member CS2 by fixing members fx.   Thereby, the power control unit<br>
including the inverters is closed by casing member CS2 and cover member CV with respect to an external space of drive device 20.<br>
In the structure of the comparative example, however, there is a possibility that the electromagnetic noises leak not only through a coupling portion (mating surface) FS1 of casing member CS2 and cover member CV but also through a coupling portion (mating surface) FS2 of casing members CS2 and CS1.   Therefore, an appropriate coupling structure for preventing the electromagnetic noises is required for each of mating surfaces FSl and FS2.<br>
However, in the drive device according to the embodiment of the invention, as can be seen from Fig. 5B, a casing CSO has a structure in which a motor accommodating portion CM forming accommodating space MS for the motor generators is formed integrally with an inverter accommodating portion CI forming accommodating space IS for the power control unit including the inverters.   More specifically, casing CSO does not have a portion corresponding to mating surface FS2 in Fig. 5A, and has inverter accommodating portion CI and motor accommodating portion CM that are formed continuously to each other.   Casing CSO having the integral structure thus formed is produced by casting of aluminum alloy.<br>
Further, cover member CV is arranged similarly to the structure in Fig, 5 A. Therefore, the power control unit including the inverters is isolated from the outside of drive device 20 by casing CSO having inverter accommodating portion CI and motor accommodating portion CM formed integrally with each other as well as cover member CV<br>
Therefore, the structure shown in Fig. 5B is different from that shown in Fig. 5A in that the mating surface for coupling the independent casing members together is not present so that it is possible to prevent effectively the external leakage of the electromagnetic noises from the power control unit to the outside of drive device 20. Consequently, it is possible to reduce a cost that is required for countermeasures against the electromagnetic noise leakage, and to prevent the external leakage of the<br>
electromagnetic noises from the drive device.<br>
[Detailed Description of Component Arrangement and Structure for Preventing Electromagnetic Noise Leakage]<br>
Detailed description will now be given on the arrangement of the components of drive device 20 in the casing.<br>
Fig. 6 is a side view of drive device 20 viewed in a direction XI in Fig. 4<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, casing 102 is provided with an opening 109 for attaching the motor generators and for maintenance.   In the vehicle-mounted state, opening 109 is closed by a lid (not shown).<br>
Motor generator MG2 is arranged inside opening 109.   Rotor 37 is arranged inside stator 36 connected to the U-, V- and W-phase bus bars.   A hollow shaft 60 can be viewed at the center of rotor 37.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, stator 36 of motor generator MG2 protrudes into space IS accommodating power control unit 21 in casing 102 to a large extent    Therefore, reactor LI and capacitor C2 are arranged on one and the other sides of motor generator MG2, respectively, so that the large parts are efficiently accommodated.   This can achieve the compact drive device for the hybrid vehicle.<br>
Further, the opening formed above the accommodating space of power control unit 21 is closed by cover 150 fixed to casing 102 by the fixing members, i.e., bolts 152 As already described with reference to Fig. 5B, casing 102 has the structure in which the accommodating portion defining accommodating space (accommodating chamber) MS of motor generator MG2 is formed integrally with the accommodating portion defining accommodating space (accommodating chamber) IS of power control unit 21    A mating surface between casing 102 that is formed integrally and cover 150 must be configured to prevent leakage of the electromagnetic noises from the inside. Fig. 7 is a cross section taken along line VII-VII in Fig. 4. Fig. 7 shows a cross section of motor generator MG2 and a cross section of an accommodating chamber accommodating power control unit 21.<br>
The drive device for the hybrid vehicle includes motor generator MG2, motor generator MGl arranged behind motor generator MG2 in Fig. 7 and having the rotor coaxial with that of motor generator MG2, the power split device arranged coaxially with the crank shaft and located between motor generators MGl and MG2, and power control unit 21 controlling motor generators MGl and MG2.   Power control unit 21 has reactor LI and smoothing capacitor C2 that are arranged in a divided fashion on one and the other sides of the rotation center axis of motor generator MG2, respectively. Motor generators MGl and MG2, the power split device and power control unit 21 are accommodated in the metal casing in the integrated fashion<br>
For preventing leakage of a lubricating oil of motor generator MG2 toward power element board 120, casing 102 is provided with a partition 200 between the two spaces.   Partition 200 is provided at its top surface with a water passage 122 for cooling power element board 120.   Water passage 122 is in communication with cooling water inlet 114 and cooling water outlet 112 already described.<br>
A bus bar 128 transmits a negative power supply potential from terminal 44 to power element board 120. Another bus bar (not shown) transmits the positive power supply potential from terminal 43 to reactor LI.<br>
A portion carrying a rotation shaft 130 of the reduction gear protrudes into the accommodating chamber accommodating this power control unit<br>
Description will now be given on the cross section of motor generator MG2.   A winding portion of coil 39 of stator 36 is visible radially inside the stator, and rotor 37, a casing partition 202 and hollow shaft 60 of the rotor are visible radially inside the winding portion.<br>
Fig. 8 is a side view of drive device 20 viewed in a direction X2 in Fig. 4.   In Fig 7, a control board 121 controlling the power element is arranged above the power element board.<br>
Fig. 9 is a cross section taken along line IX-IX in Fig. 4.<br>
Referring to Figs. 8 and 9, crankshaft 50 of the engine is connected to a damper<br>
124, of which output shaft is connected to power split device PSD<br>
Damper 124, motor generator MGl, power split device PSD, reducer RD and motor generator MG2 are coaxially arranged in this order from the side near the engine toward the other side.   Rotor 32 of motor generator MGl has a hollow shaft, through which an output shaft of damper 124 extends.<br>
The shaft of rotor 32 of motor generator MGl is spline-engaged with sun gear 51 located on the side near power split device PSD.   The shaft of damper 124 is coupled to planetary carrier 54, which carries the rotation axes of pinion gears 53 for revolution around the shaft of damper 124.   Pinion gears 53 mesh with sun gear 51 and ring gear 52 in Fig. 2 formed on the inner periphery of the ring gear casing.<br>
A portion of rotor shaft 60 of motor generator MG2 near reducer RD is spline-fitted to sun gear 62.   Planetary carrier 66 of reducer RD is fixed to partition 202 of casing 102.   Planetary carrier 66 carries the rotation shafts of pinion gears 64.   Pinion gears 64 mesh with sun gear 62 and ring gear 68 in Fig. 2 formed on the inner periphery of the ring gear casing.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 9, motor generator MGl and damper 124 can be attached through an opening 111 on the right in Fig. 9 of casing 104, and motor generator MG2 can be attached through left opening 109 of casing 102.   Reducer RD and power split device PSD can be attached through the mating plane of flanges 105 and 106.<br>
Opening 109 of casing 102 is tightly closed by a lid 71, a liquid gasket and the like for preventing leakage of the lubricating oil.   A lid 72 is arranged behind opening 111 of casing 104, and the space accommodating motor generator MGl is tightly closed by an oil seal 81, a liquid gasket and the like for preventing leakage of the lubricating oil<br>
The shaft of rotor 32 of motor generator MGl is rotatably carried by a ball bearing 78 held by lid 72 and a ball bearing 77 held by a partition 203.   Rotor 32 has a hollow shaft, through which the shaft of damper 124 extends therethrough.   Needle bearings 79 and 80 are arranged between the shaft of rotor 32 and the shaft of damper<br>
124.<br>
The shaft of rotor 37 of motor generator MG2 is rotatably carried by a ball bearing 73 held by lid 71 and a ball bearing 74 held by partition 202.<br>
The ring gear casing that are provided at its inner periphery with the ring gear of reducer RD and the ring gear of power split device PSD are rotatably carried by a ball bearing 75 held by partition 202 and a ball bearing 76 held by partition 203.<br>
The chamber accommodating power control unit 21 and the chamber accommodating motor generator MG2 are separated from each other by partition 202 of casing 102, but are partially connected via a through hole into which terminal base 116 is inserted.   The bus bar of the stator coil of motor generator MG2 is connected to one side of terminal base 116, and the bus bar of inverter 14 is connected to the other side thereof.   For allowing electrical connection of these bus bars, an electrically conductive member extends through terminal base 116.   Thus, terminal base 116 is configured to pass the electricity without allowing passage of lubricating oil ingredients from the motor generator MG2 side.<br>
Likewise, terminal base 118 connects the space accommodating the power control unit and the space accommodating motor generator MG1 together to pass the electricity without passing the lubricating oil ingredients.<br>
Fig. 10 is a cross section taken along line X-X in Fig. 4. Referring to Fig. 10, a section of reactor LI is shown in the accommodating chamber accommodating power control unit 21.   Reactor LI has a core formed of a stack of electromagnetic steel plates and a coil wound therearound.<br>
Rotation shaft 130 of reduction gear RG shown in Fig. 7 is arranged near reactor LI, and a counter driven gear 132 of reduction gear RG is arranged in a central position Counter driven gear 132 meshes with counter drive gear 70 in Fig. 2.   A final drive gear 133 is arranged on the same shaft as counter driven gear 132, and differential gear DEF that is a final driven gear meshing with final drive gear 133 is shown under final drive gear 133.<br>
Fig. 11 is a view of the casing projected in the direction of the rotation axis and particularly shows the counter of the casing and the parts accommodated therein<br>
Fig. 11 shows, inside the casing of the drive device of the vehicle, damper 124 coupled to the crank shaft of the internal combustion engine, motor generator MG2 that has the rotor coaxial with damper 124 and the stator arranged around the rotor, power split device PSD receiving the torques from damper 124 and motor generator MG2, reduction gear RG that has the rotation axis extending substantially parallel to the rotation axis of damper 124 and radially shifted therefrom, and receives the torque from power split device PSD, differential gear DEF that has a rotation axis extending substantially parallel to the rotation axis of damper 124 and radially shifted therefrom, and meshes with reduction gear RG for transmitting the torque to the wheels, board 120 controlling motor generator MG2, and power control unit 21 including reactor LI and capacitance C2.   The casing accommodates damper 124, motor generator MG2, reduction gear RG, differential gear DEF and power control unit 21<br>
In Fig. 11 that is a view of the casing projected in the direction of the rotation axis, the vehicle drive device in the vehicle-mounted state has a horizontal size of X3, which is determined between an outer edge of the casing portion accommodating differential gear DEF and an outer edge of casing 104 accommodating damper 124 Therefore, it can be understood that capacitor C2, board 120 and reactor LI forming the power control unit are located within size X3.<br>
In Fig. 11, the drive control device in the vehicle-mounted state has a vertical size or height of Y3.   An outer edge of the casing portion accommodating differential gear DEF defines a lower end of size Y3.   An outer edge of the casing portion accommodating damper 124 defines an upper end of size Y3.    Therefore, it can be understood that capacitor C2, board 120 and reactor LI forming power control unit 21 is arranged within size Y3.<br>
In the view of the casing projected in the direction of the rotation axis, the casing portion accommodating power control unit 21 in the vehicle-mounted state has a height<br>
not exceeding a height of the space of the remaining casing portion accommodating damper 124, motor generator MG2, reduction gear RG and differential gear DEF.   The structure of the casing and the arrangement of power control unit 21 are determined to satisfy this relationship of the heights.   Thereby, the vehicle can have a center of gravity in a low position, and can improve a drive stability.<br>
Also, in connection with the horizontal direction in the vehicle-mounted state, the structure of the casing and the arrangement of power control unit 21 are determined such that the casing portion accommodating power control unit 21 is located inside the projected portion of the space of the other casing portion.   Thereby, the vehicle drive device has a small contour.<br>
Fig. 12 is a view of the casing projected in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and perpendicular to a vertical direction, and particularly shows a counter of the casing and parts accommodated therein.<br>
Referring to Fig. 12, size X3 in the direction perpendicular to the vertical direction of the casing in the vehicle-mounted state is likewise defined between the outer edge of the lid of the casing portion accommodating motor generator MG2 and the outer edge of the casing portion accommodating damper 124, and it can be understood that capacitor C2, board 120 and reactor LI forming the power control unit 21 arranged within a size Z3.<br>
Thus, as already described with reference to Fig. 11, size Y3 in the vertical (i.e., height) direction is determined by the portion accommodating damper 124, motor generator MG2, reduction gear RG and differential gear DEF.   In the view of the casing projected perpendicularly to the rotation axis and perpendicularly to the vertical direction in the vehicle-mounted state, the casing portion that accommodates power control unit 21 including board 120, reactor LI and capacitor C2 is contained in the space of the remaining casing portion, i.e., the portion accommodating damper 124, motor generator MG2, reduction gear RG and differential gear DEF.<br>
As described above, the components of the power control unit, i.e., power<br>
element board 120, reactor LI and capacitor C2 are arranged using the space remaining around the structure in which where reduction gear RG and differential gear DEF are arranged in addition to motor generators MG1 and MG2, reducer RD and power split device PSD.   Thereby, the drive device for the hybrid vehicle can have a small height and a compact structure.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, the spaces on the opposite sides of motor generator MG2 are used for arranging reactor LI and capacitance C2, respectively, and the structure using the space on only one side is not employed.   Thereby, a weight balance with respect to motor generator MG2 can be improved, and the required space can be further reduced.<br>
Power split device PSD, reduction gear RG receiving the torque from power split device PSD and differential gear DEF meshing with reduction gear RG to transmit the torque to the wheels correspond, as a whole, to a "power transmitting mechanism" that combines the powers generated by motor generators MG1 and MG2 with the power generated by the engine, and transmits the combined powers to the drive shaft<br>
Each of reduction gear RG and differential gear DEF corresponds to the power transmission gear receiving the torque from power split device PSD.   However, reduction gear RG and differential gear DEF are not essential, and the invention can be applied to vehicles that do not have reduction gear RG or that are of a rear drive vehicle having differential gear DEF not integrated with the drive device.<br>
Further, the invention can be applied to a parallel hybrid using an electric motor for assisting driving when an engine is accelerating or the like, and to a structure in which only one motor is integrated in the drive device.<br>
According to the embodiment of the invention, as described above, the casing of the drive device for the hybrid vehicle and particularly the casing integrated with the power control unit including the inverter has the motor generator accommodating portion and the power control unit (inverter) accommodating portion that are integrally formed so that the external leakage of electromagnetic noises from the drive device can<br>
be prevented.<br>
According to the structure of the drive device described above, the hybrid vehicle including the drive device can keep the center of gravity in a low position, and the drive stability of the vehicle can be improved as compared with conventional structures.   Further, a required space in an engine room can be reduced.<br>
The power control unit portion including the inverter can be arranged to occupy a low and compact space by using the remaining spaces beside the transaxle, i.e., the spaces beside motor generator MG2 and the power split device.   Thereby, the transaxle portion can have a form or contour close to that of a conventional gasoline-powered vehicle so that it is possible to achieve the drive device for the hybrid vehicle that can be mounted on more kinds of vehicles.<br>
Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the scope of the present invention being interpreted by the terms of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
