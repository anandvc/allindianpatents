3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
ORIGINAL<br><br>
Description<br>
The invention primarily concerns a measuring system with optical signal and energy transmission between an intelligent sensor head and a central measuring unit for medium-voltage or high-voltage systems or in mining. Furthermore, the invention relates to a method therefore.<br>
For measuring the operating voltage in medium- or high-voltage station control systems normally voltage transformers are used. According to the operating voltage of the station control system the isolation and turns ratio have to be chosen in order to decrease the operating voltage to an indicating voltage of less than 100 V which is suitable for measurement purposes. Depending on the respective task (billing measurement, line and apparatus protection technique, performance measurement technique) single-pole or two-pole isolated voltage transformers are used in very different forms of construction.<br>
Voltage transformers generally make up a high share of costs for station control systems and station control instrumentations. They have large physical dimensions and have influence on the construction of the station control system. They are sensitive against over voltages and represent the weakest element of hardware in the constmction of a station control system. Secondary connection lines between voltage transformer and protective relay or between voltage transformer and measurement unit can be considerably influenced by magnetic fields, ground leakage currents, short-circuit currents and interference fields, which often leads to a corruption of the measurement results.<br>
DE 37 27 950 C2 discloses a device for performing voltage measurements in medium-voltage and high-voltage station control systems, which offers a complete substitution for usage of voltage transformers within the scope of performance measurement technique. The opto-electronic sensors used there enable an electrical and mechanical decoupling of measurement location and indication, they are insensitive against interference fields and over voltages and, besides, they are distinguished by small physical dimensions and relatively low costs. For performing voltage measurements as a phase comparison measurement, in particular two opto-electronic sensors are provided which are connected at the supporting insulator with switching electrode. Furthermore, two opto-electronic sensors of ferroelectric type are provided which are each connected over optical waveguide with a remote situated transceiver unit and which are sampled simultaneously by these transceiver units by means of the reflection method. A phase comparison device is connected to both transceiver units whereas two comparators connected to both transceiver units converted the conveyed analog input signal into a square-wave signal. Two monostable multivibrators connected to the comparators generate short pulses from the square-wave signal synchronous to the zero crossovers of both phases. Finally, a sum counter is provided which is connected to ttie output of both multivibrators and counts simultaeously incoming pulses as a single pulse and counts incoming pulses with a delay as separate pulses. Devices for evaluation and indication of phase coincidence, phase opposition, lack of a phase distribution and functionality are connected to the outputs of the sum counter. In an alternative way of realization a series connection of a diode and a further capacitor is provided parallel to the capacitor between switching electrode and earth and a voltage dependent CMOS pulse generator is connected parallel to this. The outputs of the pulse generator are connected over a capacitor to the opto-electronic sensor of ferroelectric type, wrtiich is connected via optical waveguide with a light transceiver with measuring amplifier. The measuring amplifier contains an element for converting the pulse frequency into a value appropriate for the input of a voltage measurement device, consisting of a digital-to-analogue converter or a frequency-to-voltage converter. In a device according to DE 37 27 950 C2 signal processing and evaluation is done remote from the measurement location, respectively centrally.<br>
DE 38 24 000 C2 discloses a monitoring unit for protection against damage to pylons where sensors other than optical waveguide sensors can also be used. In particular, at every foot of the pylon an optical waveguide, an infrared detector or a vibration detector is employed as a sensor and from there an optical waveguide is conducted to the monitoring device. In case of the optical waveguide sensor a dismantled waveguide of loop type is conducted along a corner stile foot of the pylon and, at the upper end of the monitoring area, passes into a twin-wire mantled optical waveguide cable. This cable is conducted along a corner stile of the pylon to a central monitoring device which is located in a metal housing within the upper third of the pylon on a cross beam of the pylon. Besides the central monitoring device, for every infrared detector and vibration detector a single monitoring device exists which is made up of an electronic module in a metal housing and is located at the upper end of the monitoring area in a comer stile of the pilon. From there a single-wire optical waveguide cable is conducted to the central monitoring device, While infrared or vibration detectors are integrated into the signal device, in the case of the optical waveguide sensor its conductor only is inserted into the signal device. In the central device the optical signals transmitted from the single devices are converted and provided to the evaluation logic which, in co-operation viiith the task scheduler, forwards the alarm message via radio data transmission to an observation point. There a distinction of the signal devices, which triggered the message, is possible. The signal devices with infrared detector or vibration detector have a battery supply and the following components, which are in series arrangement: sensor, amplifier, filter, evaluation logic, light emitting diode and socket for the connector of the optical waveguide cable to the central device.<br>
Furthermore, a HP filter for suppressing unwanted temperature outputs is used for the passive infrared detector, whereas an active BP filter for frequency selection is used for the vibration detector. In the evaluation logic a decision is made wrfiether there is an alarm case or not. In the monitoring device according to DE 38 24 000 C2 a signal pre-processing and evaluation is already perfomied at the measuring location.<br><br>
DE 198 32 707 C2 discloses a combined current and voltage converter for outdoor switching stations with a semi-conventional voltage converter of a CC-, RR- or RC-divider type and an all-optical current converter in form of an optical waveguide loop surrounding the high-voltage conductor. Furthermore, a common converter evaluation device for both current converter and voltage converter is provided which has ground potential. When evaluating the signals from the voltage converter and the current converter, the measurement values of the single phases can thus be assigned to each other, and a phase-synchronous measurement of the single phases can be performed.<br>
DE 195 43 363 C2 discloses a transducer arrangement for measuring currents and voltages in medium- or high-voltage systems comprising at least one cun-ent or voltage sensor for acquisition of measurement values, one coder for encoding of measurement values, one optical transmitter for transmitting and one optical receiver for receiving of the encoded measurement values, and at least one decoder for decoding of measurement values at the receiver location. For enabling an easy installation of the transducer arrangement in a medium- or high-voltage system as well as an adaptation to the respective measurement requirements without big efforts, the transducer arrangement consists of combinable modules with standardized interfaces. Moreover, at least one sensor module is provided with the current or voltage sensor, at least one transmitter module with the encoder and the voltage sensor, and at least one receiver module with the optical receiver and the decoder. The sensor module and the transmitter module are adapted to each other with respect to their physical dimensions and their connectors and they are combined mechanically to a high-voltage module, which guarantees an easy installation in the high-voltage system. In a preferred embodiment the sensor module for measuring DC or AC voltages comprises a voltage sensor in the form of a preferably frequency compensated ohmic voltage divider w/hich is provided w/ilh a surge protector on the low voltage side. The transmitter module may comprise a voltage-to-frequency converter for generating a pulsed carrier signal as an encoder as well as an optical transmitter with at least a transmitter diode fo7 converting the carrier signal into optical pulses. The receiver module accordingly comprises an optical receiver with a light sensitive receiver diode for converting optical pulses into an electrical pulsed carrier signal as well as a frequency-to-voltage converter as a decoder. Transmitter module and receiver module are both connected together with an optical waveguide. Furthermore, the high-voltage module comprises an auxiliary energy supply unit for supplying the transmitter module wheras the auxiliary energy supply unit being supplied by the optical waveguide.<br>
DE 100 10 913 CI discloses a device for monitoring the gas density of an insulating gas-filled high-voltage transmission line, which is separated into several line sections by partition walls, which comprises components placed in the vicinity of the partition walls for measuring the gas density in the line sections and transmitting of measurement results as well as a signal processing unit for receiving and evaluating the measurement results. In particular, the measurement components are supplied by a centrally located energy source containing a light source over at least one energy supply line in form of an optical waveguide. The measurement components contains opto-electric energy converter for converting light into electric energy and several measurement components are connected in series with the light source over a common energy supply line. The energy supply line and the signal transmission line can also be combined in form of a simple optical waveguide. The measurement component mainly consists of an energy conditioning unit, a computing unit and a sensor unit. The energy conditioning unit is supplied with energy by an energy source containing a light source over an energy supply line in form of an optical waveguide and an opto-electric energy converter. Depending on the configuration of the monitoring device the light source contains one or more laser diode modules each with a power of up to 500mW. Furthermore the energy conditioning unit contains a capacitor, for example a low leakage current ELKO or an array of tantalum or ceramic capacitors, which stores the energy delivered from the energy source and if required provides it to the computing unit. The computing unit mainly comprises a microprocessor, which serves for controlling the sensor unit, acquisition and preprocessing of the values measured by the sensor unit and transmitting of the preprocessed measured values to the signal processing unit over a light emitting diode, a signal transmission line in form of an optical waveguide and an optical sensor. In the respective method for monitoring the gas density of an isolating gas-filled high-voltage transmission line, the measuring component is fed from the energy source with constant power during a wait cycle, then the gas density is measured by the measuring component, the measured value is transmitted to the signal processing unit and then the measurement component is reset to wait state up to the next measurement.<br>
Finally, DE 695 20 371 T2 discloses an optical -fiber interface system, wherein a regulation effects that the current fed to a laser light source is as low as admissible so that at the same time a remote interface and a process variable transmitter are provided with sufficient energy. In particular a first locally stationed microcontroller device is provided, which serves for adjustable supply of optical energy at a first output connector and serves for reception of digital encoded, optically transmitted information from the remote location at a first input connector of the microcontroller device. An analog transmit device is electrically connected to the first locally stationed microcontroller device and arranged in a way that optionally either analog or digital information or both at the same time can be conveyed to a local control system. A second microcontroller device is stationed in a remote location, i.e. remote from the first microcontroller device, and serves for receiving of analog and/or digital signals, which define the state of a process variable, like pressure, temperature, flow, motion, density or other parameters, vAich were captured by a remote process variable transmitter, and for conveying optical coded state infonnation to a second output connector. An energy supply unit is coupled to the second microcontroller unit and the remote process variable transmitter and supplies them with electric energy. The energy supply unit contains an optical-to-electric energy converter with a second input connector. At least one optical fibre is connected between the first output connector of the locally stationed equipment and the second input connector of the remote stationed optical-to-electrical energy converter. The same or a second optical fibre is connected between the second output connector of the remote stationed microcontroller unit and the first input connector of the first locally stationed microcontroller unit. Furthermore, a unit that includes the first microcontroller unit initially conveys optical energy with an<br><br>
eye safe lower value to the first output connector. The second microcontroller unit reacts to the reception of the eye safe lower light energy value over the first optical fibre and transmits a start-up command over the fibre-optical link to the first locally stationed microcontroller device, wrtiereby additional light energy above the eye safe lower value is only delivered to the first optical fibre if it is property connected between the respective output and input connectors. Furthermore, a light source energy supply unit exists locally which supplies a light source, like e.g. a gas laser, a laser diode or a LED with electrical energy, and the light source contains a device for modulating the intensity of the optical energy, wtiich is conveyed to the first output connector. The first microcontroller unit also contains a first microprocessor for controlling the light source energy supply unit and the light source modulation unit. The first microprocessor receives energy status information from the remote stationed second microcontroller device, which enables a control, particularly a PI control (Proportional-integral-control), of optical energy, i.e. the laser current wfiich is provided from the local location to the remote location, in a "quasi-static operation" with a check of the laser voltage at regular intervals (status messages; message of six 8-bit bytes).<br>
The above discussion of prior art acknowledges different measurement systems, wrtiich mostly contains a central signal processing unit and several electrical measuring components and which perform an optical transmission over optical waveguides of the measured values delivered from the measuring components. As such measuring have to meet high requirements with respect to operational safety, e.g. in monitoring of a high-voltage power switch, a safe capturing of measured values and a reliable fibre-optical data transmission is desirable. However, too little attention is paid to the fact that the constant activation of the laser diode for remote supply of the measuring component leads to a considerable shortening of the lifetime of the laser diode. Additionally, due to electromagnetic influences originating from the high-voltage system, particulariy because of switching procedures at a high voltage level, interference signals in the optical signal transmission may cause malfunctions by clock displacement of the measured signals (measured currents respectively measured voltages). Even the fibre-optical interface system according to DE 695 20 371 T2 writh its "quasi-static operation" only effects that the current that is fed into the laser light source is as low as admissible. Therefore, a fibre-optical measuring system is missing in practice, which has low power consumption and enables a safe optical data transmission. This is especially important because the industry manufacturing medium-voltage or high-voltage systems can be considered as a very progressive industry vi4iich quickly picks up improvements and simplifications and puts them into practice.<br>
In contrast to known measuring systems, it is the underlying purpose of the present invention to provide such a measuring system that has low energy consumption and yet enables a safe optical data transmission.<br>
This purpose is achieved by a measuring system for medium-voltage or high-voltage systems or in mining with optical signal and energy transmission between a sensor head wnth at least one sensor element and a .central measuring unit having<br>
•	an optical transmitter provided in the central measuring unit, which is controlled by a microprocessor which and emits a superposition of different light components to a first optical waveguide for purposes of data communication and energy supply of the sensor head,<br>
•	an optical receiver connected to the first optical waveguide and a microprocessor provided in the sensor head, where the microprocessor, being activated by the optical receiver, serves for controlling the sensor element, acquiring and processing of the values measured by the sensor element and controls data communication for transmission of preprocessed measurement values to the central measuring unit over an optical transmitter, a second optical waveguide and an optical receiver located in the central measuring unit<br>
wherein said microprocessors carry out transmitting, measuring and monitoring tasks as a distributed controller with bidirectional data communication, wherein a frame synchronization signal serves both for supplying power as well as for deriving a clock signal for block-oriented data transmission and/or a data communicafion is carried out for conducting a parameterization and/or programming between the central measuring unit and the sensor head, and wherein a preprocessing of the measured values is carried out in the sensor head, particulariy a measured value correction and/or a range switching and/or a reprogramming of the filtering characteristics and/or an automatic compensation are/is carried out in the sensor head.<br>
The inventive measuring system has the advantage that - due to the distributed controlling - malfunctions in the transducer system are immediately recognized'and unwanted consequences, for example a false alarm or shutdown of the medium-voltage or high-voltage system respectively the monitored device, can be avoided. Furthemore, measurements can be carried out with high resolution (e.g. raised from currently 12 bit to 16 bit) as well as a range switching and a measured value con-ection can be carried out in the sensor head with respect to offset, gain, temperature or lifetime (aging). The automatic compensation can be performed both during manufacturing (enabling improved inspection technologies and fabrication techniques) and during operation. Moreover, the measuring system according to the invention enables a combined controlling of energy and data transmission and, due to the in total needed low power consumption and due to the dynamic operafing mode, the lifetime of the optical transmitter (laser diode) is increased considerably compared to the appreciated state of the art.<br>
Furthermore this purpose is achieved by a method for measuring of cun'ents or voltages In medium-voltage or high-voltage systems or in mining with optical signal or energy transmission between a central measuring unit and a sensor head having at least one sensor element, wherein microprocessors situated in the measuring unit and in the sensor head carry out<br><br>
transmitting, measuring and monitoring tasks as to the principle of distributed controlling with bidirectional data communication, wherein the microprocessor located in the measuring unit controls the energy transmission in a dynamic operation based on a frame synchronization signal, wherein for preprocessing the measured values and/or automatic compensation in the sensor head, a measuring of the reference voltage in a climatic test chamber and storing in at least one microprocessor is carried out, and wherein the microprocessor located in the sensor head carries out an compensation operation and an error computation and controls a DC-free and error correcting data transmission.<br>
The inventive method has the advantage that in a surprisingly easy way low energy consumption and safe optical data transmission are possible, where depending on the operating status parameters or data are transmitted between both microprocessors acting as a distributed controllers with bidirectional data communication and data/messages are monitored with respect to data transmission quality and arrival on time.<br>
The fine tuning of the energy transmission is carried out by means of a pulse width modulation together with a two-position control or a simple threshold control, and wherein the measured values (MW) which contain an error component are corrected in the sensor head (SK) before data transmission wVn the aid of ambient temperature, reference voltages and offset voltage measured in the sensor head (SK).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an analog-to-digital converter is provided in the sensor head, which is connected with the microprocessor and the microprocessor corrects the digital measured value received from the analog-to-digital converter and/or expands the data with system information, segments the resulting data, encodes them by means of block coding and provides them wnth information for segmentation in such a manner that a DC-free and error correcting data transmission is possible.<br>
This embodiment of the invention has the advantage that overioad of the amplifiers provided for data transmission is reliably avoided (in consequence of the DC-free characteristic) and that by adding redundancy at the transmitter and error correction at the receiver a safe data transmission can be built up (in consequence of the possibility for error correction).<br>
In a further development of the invention, the sensor head contains a multiplexer whose inputs are each connected to sensor elements, where the switching of the measuring channels is carried out by the microprocessor.<br>
This further development of the invention is advantageous in that further measurement signals can be fed to the microprocessor which allows, for example, to carry out a compensation in the sensor head or phase comparison measurements (several sensor heads).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an impedance converter for the measurable value to be tapped is connected to the output of the multiplexer and a differential amplifier with configurable gains is located between the output of the impedance converter and the input of the analog-to-digital converter, vrfiich is connected to the microprocessor for range switching.<br>
This embodiment of the invention is advantageous in that the impedance converter generates a high-impedance input w4ierein the differential amplifier facilitates the adaptation to the dynamic range of the analog-to-digital converter. Furthermore, the range sviritching allows the usage of the measuring system according to the invention for several measuring ranges (whereas so far in the state of art a separate measuring system has been required for every measuring range).<br>
In accordance with the invention, the sensor element preferably contains an ohmic voltage divider for measuring DC or AC voltages and/or for current measurement contains an inducfive current converter with a successive filter for filtering of transients and high-voltage impulses and a serially connected protective device.<br>
The combination of filter and protective device reliably avoids both the corruption of the measurement by transient and high-voltage impulses and the damaging/destruction of the measuring system.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a temperature sensor is located in the sensor head, which is connected to one of the inputs of the multiplexer. Furthermore, the sensor head contains, according to claim 7, a reference voltage source and controlled by the microprocessor the respective temperature dependent reference voltage value - used for compensation - can be fed in over an input of the multiplexer or a control input of the analog-to-digital converter.<br>
This embodiment of the invention is advantageous in that in surprisingly simple way, compensation with respect to temperature and aging, i.e. the subtraction of the temperature response of the reference voltage and the temperature response and the aging of the components, e.g. the amplifier, is made possible.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a filter connected wnth the optical receiver is provided in the sensor head, wherein the frame synchronization signal and/or the successive data signal can be measured at the output of the filter and can be fed to the microprocessor.<br>
The filter enables the filtering of the signals of interest (frame synchronization/data) respectively the removal of interference signals of higher frequencies, wherein the frame synchronizafion facilitates the synchronization of transmitter and receiver in a simple way. In another preferred embodiment of the invention a voltage converter connected to the optical receiver is located in the sensor head, which serves for voltage supply in the sensor head, and the microprocessor monitors the voltage measurable at the energy accumulator of the voltage converter.<br><br>
In a measuring system according to the invention, the energy supply is done by optical means, whereby a separation of the potentials is given in a simple way. Monitoring the voltage allows a reduction of the transmitted energy to the requirement amount, which results in a longer lifetime of the optical transmitter/the laser diode. The generation of light pulses preferably is done with the method of pulse width modulation (instead of an amplitude modulation), so that the energy consumption can be optimized. Furthermore, a defined start¬up/shut-down behaviour (particularly communication) only occurs if the required voltage has been reached.<br>
Preferably, an amplifier is precedingly connected in series to every optical transmitter, and furthermore another amplifier is subsequently connected in series to the optical receiver in the central measuring unit.<br>
The use of amplifiers allows at the same time an energy-saving way of work and a correct operation of the optical transmitter/laser diodes by only generating the current required by those.<br>
Finally, the central measuring unit contains, at least one interface circuit and a digital signal processor connected to the microprocessor is located in the central measuring unit, which can be both configured and read out from outside over the interface circuit.<br>
Thus, the digital signal processor can be read out as well as configured/programmed in a simple way, «rtiich allows e.g. to configure other computations.<br>

The block diagram of a first embodiment of the inventive sensor head is shown in FIG. 2, wherein an optical receiver LE2 connected to the first optical waveguide LW1 and a microprocessor MP2 are provided in the sensor head SK. According to the invention the microprocessor MP2, being activated by the optical receiver LE2, serves for controlling the sensor element S1, acquiring and processing of the values measured by the sensor element S1 and for transmission of preprocessed measurement values to the central measuring unit MG. For this purpose, the microprocessor MP2 controls an optical transmitter LS2 located in the sensor head SK, wherein data communication occurs over a second optical waveguide LW2 to an optical receiver LE1 located in the central measuring unit MG.<br>
Both microprocessors MP1, MP2 carry out transmitting, measuring and monitoring tasks as to the principle of distributed controlling with bidirectional data communication. Furthermore, a preprocessing of the measured values is carried out in the inventive sensor head SK, whereas a measured value correction and/or a range switching and/or a reprogramming of the filtering characteristics and/or an automatic compensation; this is explained in the follownng.<br><br>
According to the invention a frame synchronization signal is transmitted between the central measuring unit MG and the sensor head SK, which serves both for supplying power as well as for deriving a clock signal for block-oriented data transmission (see FIG. 3d). The sensor head SK becomes its supply voltage from the optical transmitter LS1 over the first optical waveguide LW1 by means of time-discrete laser pulses, which together with the laser pulse vindth are a measure for the supply voltage. FIG. 3d shows the laser pulse LI and the pause P, w/here the largest wndth of the laser pulse LI is depicted by a dotted line. After the laser pulse LI the central measuring unit MG optionally transmits a data of one byte (plus start and stop bit ST, SB see FIG. 3a). Thereby the following parameters can be transmitted for example; measurement range to be configured, filter configuration, distance between the reference measurements. Data transmission is carried out with the method agreed upon in the parameter exchange, wherein data safety can preferably be obtained by use of parity bit and checksum. With the detection of every frame synchronization signal a timer starts in the microprocessor MP2. If the timer exceeds a preconfigurable time limit it has to be assumed that supply of the unit is faulty. The central measuring unit is notified of this by a telegram, the sensor head SK goes into an idle state and waits for the next signals of the optical transmitter LS1 (laser diode). Thus, the clock of the laser pulses LI controls the time of transmission of the measurement data from the sensor head SK to the central measuring unit MG. Every request to transmit data to the central measuring unit MG is marked by the start of a laser pulse LI. Thereby the microcontroller MP1 receives two pieces of information about its generation of the operating voltage for the two-position control. For this purpose two voltage comparators indicate if the voltage delivered by the laser pulse LI is too high (upper threshold) or too low (lower threshold) so that the laser pulse LI can be changed (decremented, i.e. reducing the energy supply step by step or infinitely variable or incremented, i.e. increasing the energy supply step by step or infinitely variable) step by step (dynamic operation). For this voltage information one bit wnthin the transmit telegram is sufficient, which is reported by the sensor head SK to the central measuring unit MG (increase or reduce). Preferably it is also possible to carry out a simple threshold control with a preconfigurable threshold, e.g. with the lower threshold. In this dynamic operation the influences of the measured temperature, reference voltages and offset voltage (measurement against ground) are also taken into account as the sensor head SK is subject to higher changes in temperature (see the subsequent explanations).<br>
In the sensor head SK an analog-to-digital converter ADC is provided which is connected to the microprocessor MP2. In normal operation mode the microprocessor MP2 performs a serial readout of the digitalized measured value MW (see FIG. 3a) from the analog-to-digifal converter ADC, carries out an error correction and coding and serially transmits the corrected and coded data over the second optical waveguide LW2 to the central measuring unit MG. The sensor head SK contains a multiplexer MUX, which has each of its inputs connected to sensor elements S1 (FIG. 2, FIG. 7), wherein the switching between measurement channels KU is carried out by the microprocessor MP2. At the output of the multiplexer MUX an impedance converter IW is connected tor the measurable value and between the output of the impedance converter IW and the input of the analog-to-digital converter ADC a differential amplifier DV with configurable gain is located, which serves for range switching BU and is controlled by the microprocessor MP2 respectively is switched when a gain is configured. Furthermore, the sensor head SK contains a reference voltage source REF. The microprocessor MP2 generates a correction value from the measurement of the reference voltage (e.g. three-point calibration). With this calibration the inventive measurement system eliminates the gain error and offset error (as long as the non-linearity is negligibly small), wrfierein the respective temperature-dependent reference voltage value is fed in over an input of the multiplexer MUX or a control input of the analog-to-digital converter ADC. Furthermore, a filter Fl connected to the optical receiver LE2 is located in the sensor head SK, where the frame synchronization signal and/or the subsequent data signal can be measured at the output and fed into the microprocessor MP2. Thereby, the rising edge of the frame synchronization signal, w4iich is at the start of every data transmission, i.e. the laser pulse, can be detected (comparator). Furthermore, a voltage converter SPW connected to the optical receiver LE2 is located in the sensor head SK, which serves for voltage supply in the sensor head SK (including the amplifier V2), where the microprocessor MP2 monitors the voltage measurable at the energy store of the voltage converter SPW.<br>
In the embodiments shown in FIGS. 2 or 7, the sensor element S1 for measurement of DC or AC voltage contains an ohmic voltage divider and/or an inductive current converter with a subsequent filter Fl for filtering of transient and high-voltage impulses for current measurement as well as a protective element SCH (against overvoltage) connected in series. In case of measurements vwth a test shunt the voltage is measured at four places of the test shunt in order to reduce the thermic voltage, whereby the test cables are connected to a clamp bar being twisted and shielded. The clamp bars as well as the four inner and outer shields are bridged. The potential of the shields serves as a reference potential in the sensor head SK and it is possible to connect several sensor heads SK (see FIG. 7) in parallel for measuring of a test shunt.<br>
Furthermore a temperature sensor TS is located in the sensor head SK, which is connected to one the outputs of the multiplexer MUX.<br>
Based on the temperature and, for example, on the temperature increase caused by the current flow through the shunt the<br>
microprocessor MP2 calculates a correction value. By means of this correcfion value and a shunt correction value (see system<br>
infomnafion SI) the error caused by the temperature increase is compensated.	'<br>
For obtaining a DC-free and safe transmission the data are, according to the invention, coded before being transmitted. FIG. 3a shows the stajcture for an embodiment of a transmit telegram. The 16-bit data word MW fed in by the analog-to-digital converter ADC is segmented by the microprocessor MP2, e.g. into 4-bit segments, and these words are coded into 7-bit words (with information for<br><br>
segmentation) by means of a coding table, which is stored in the microprocessor MP2 or in a memory (not depicted). Preferably, a word containing system information SI (voltage control, temperature, etc.) is transmitted in addition to these four words.<br>
In this embodiment the data volume to be expected is calculated from the number of blocks transmitted per frame. For the example shown in FIG. 3a, 45 bits have to be transmitted after encoding (including start and stop bits ST, SB) for a sample value of 16 bit, vi/hich equals one block. Depending on the desired sampling frequency a variable number of blocks have to be transmitted in a frame. As the number of blocks has to be an integer, the sampling frequency cannot be chosen arbitrarily. Subsequently, several examples for transmission rates at different sampling rates are listed:<br>
tframe;118|js<br>
Lfsample = 17,86 kHz; transmission rate = 45 Bit * 17,86 kHz = 803,7 kBit/s<br>
tframe: 156ps<br>
Lfsample = 12,82 kHz; transmission rate = 45 Bit * 12,82 kHz = 576,9 kBit/s<br>
tframe: 118|js<br>
Lfsample = 59,3 kHz; transmission rate = 45 Bit * 59,3 kHz = 2,67 MBit/s<br>
tframe: 156ps<br>
Lfsample = 57,7 kHz; transmission rate = 45 Bit * 57,7 kHz = 2,6 MBit/s<br>
The frame stmcture for two different sampling frequencies, preferably sampling frequency 60 kHz respectively 10 kHz is shovm in FIG.<br>
3b, respectively FIG. 3c.<br>
According to the invention, for increasing the measurement accuracy an en-or correction is carried out for the digitalized measured values MW (e.g. voltage values). The correction factors required therefore are determined by the microprocessor MP2 located in the sensor head SK by means of a periodic compensation procedured and are used for correction up to the next compensation. As during readin of a compensation value a readin and processing of a current measured voltage value MW cannot be carried out, an interpolated value is coded and transmitted, according to the invention, instead of the regular value. The processing sequence for interpolating the measured values (n-2) and (n-1) to value (n) is shown in FIG. 8 and the processing sequence for determining the con-ection factor is shown in FIG. 9; there the difference to normal operation is emphasized by the word "or". The interpolation of the measured values (n-2) and (n) to value (n-1) was done in an analogue way (not shovm). By storing the measured values (n-2) and (n), virtiere the compensation procedure (n-1) is lying in between, an interpolation of the measured value (n-1) can be performed. The distance behveen capturing the compensation values is preferably in the range of minutes.<br>
Furthermore, in a inventive measuring method, the reference voltage is measured in a climatic test chamber from outside with a precise measuring instrument. The measured values, which are for example measured at temperatures of -40'C, CC und +85°C are stored in the microprocessor MP2; an example for this is shovm in FIG, 4. The measured values describe a parable, which is used for error correction. Using the parabolic equation it is possible to determine a value of the reference voltage for every temperature. According to the invention a table of intermediate values is computed by means of the parabolic equation as described in the follownng;<br><br>
In the compensation procedure for example two voltages (+VRef, -VRef) and GND are digitalized successively by the analog-to-digital converter ADC. Additionally, the current temperature of the unit/sensor head SK is determined by the temperature sensor TS. With these parameters an error correction can be performed as followre.<br>
The reference voltage value can be determined from the table depending on the current temperature. Then the compensation parable is computed wnth the real value of the reference voltage (temperature-dependent), the measured values of the reference voltage (pos., neg.) and the offset at GND.<br><br>
Accordingly, an equation system with three variables has to be solved, the compensation parable has to be detemiine ed, the correction factors (a, b, c) have to be stored and used up to the next compensation.<br><br><br>
This means that for correcting one measured value, two multiplications and two additions have to be computed.<br>
In case of using a straight-line curve instead of a parable for compensation the correction procedure is reduced to one multiplication and one addition. Additionally, the correction factors can be determined with less computational effort, wherein the temperature correction computation of the measured value, e.g. received from (he test shunt, is carrfed out by means of a polygonal sequence stored in the microprocessor MP2 and the temperature in the shunt (over the measured temperature in the shunt) (aging of the test shunt is not taken into account by the error correction procedure). The interval between the reference measurements is reported from the microprocessor MP1 to the microprocessor MP2 of the sensor head during paramerization, and during the reference measurement a measuring of the cun-ent value is not carried out and the preceding measured value is transmitted. In order to guarantee a small jitter (several hundred ns) between the single measurements, the measurement of the value is carried out directly with the frame synchronization signal.<br>
FIG. 6a shows an interface circuit (Serial Peripheral Interface) which is located between analog-to-digital converter ADC and microprocessor MP2. The SPI interface is based on an 8-bit shift register. The clock SCK is provided by the microprocessor MP2. A clock generation by the microprocessor MP2 only occurs if data are transmitted. Between transmissions SCK is in an idle mode. Transmitting and receiving occurs simultaneously. While microprocessor MP2 transmits its data, data from the analog-to-digital converter are received. This means that a transmission of data always has to be carried out even if currently nothing is received. The data exchange depicted in FIG. 6a, shows the following: data to SDO are transmitted vwth the falling edge, data to SDI are received mVh the rising edge. The idle level of SCK is high.<br>
The cooperation between analog-to-digital converter ADC and microprocessor MP2 is described subsequently. Data have to be transmitted constantly from microprocessor MP2, so that a clock is generated for the analog-to-digital converter ADC. These data are dummy data without information content and transmitting and receiving is performed simultaneously. All in all, 24 bit = 3 byte have to be transmitted for one conversion cycle. After transmission of the first byte has been carried out, which is signalled by an interrupt, the receive buffer has to be read in the internjpt service routine and a new byte has to be written into the transmit buffer. During this time the interface circuit SPI does not provide a clock to the analog-to-digital converter ADC and hence the ADC does not work. No data are lost. After handling of the interrupt service routine another byte is transmitted to the analog-to-digital converter ADC and simultaneously another one is received. The time schedule for control by microprocessor MP2 is shown in FIG. 6a and 6b.<br>
The complete conversion cycle requires 24 clocks, vi/here the time for handling of the interrupt service routine has to be added two times. Task within the interrupt service routine are:<br>
-	reading of the receive buffer<br>
-	writing of the transmit buffer<br>
L        The inten-upt is erased when a writing into the transmit buffer or a reading from the receive buffer is carried out.<br>
Control of the analog-to-digital converter ADC may possibly be effected by connecting the MOSI pin (Master out. Slave in) to the analog-to-digital-converter ADC. By transmitting respective data the analog-to-digital-converter ADC can be activated or deactivated. The multiplexer MUX offers the possibility to connect reference voltages to the analog-to-digifal-converter ADC. These voltages are used by the microprocessor MP2 for correction of the gain error v/iich originates from the analog path. The correction computation can be switched off in order to receive the original measured values from the analog-to-digital converter ADC.<br>
The power dissipation of the measurement system according to the invention has been determined in extensive test series as follows:<br><br><br>
The power dissipation of the voltage reference REF and the multiplexer MUX can be neglected.<br>
A second embodiment with several sensor heads is shown in FIG. 7, wherein identical references are used.<br>
The inventive measurement system can be used in any application where optical signal and energy transmission have to meet great demands and a maximum of efficient and safe transmission of measurement data has to be guaranteed, e.g. in mining, in medium-voltage or high-voltage systems or in industrial electronics, particularly in automatic control engineering. According to the invention a dynamic operation is performed based on the frame synchronization signal and the pulse width modulation together with a two-point control or a simple threshold control (fine tuning), the measurement values MW, which naturally contain an error component, are corrected in the sensor head SK by using the ambient temperature measured in the sensor head SK, the measured reference voltages and the measured offset voltage, and depending on the operation status parameters or data are transmitted between both microprocessors MP1, MP2 working as a distributed controller with bidirectional data communication and data/messages are monitored for data transmission quality and arrival on time.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the measurement system can for example be used within the scope of real-time networking of conirois {a}so real-time control over Ethernet or Poweriink), where the ability of the subscribers (e.g. drives, fast l/Os, sensors, actuators, display systems) for synchronization among each other and processing of data in the regulator clock of the drives is a requirement; the temperature sensor TS is connected over the interface circuit SPI to the microprocessor MP2 and is cyclically polled by the latter; instead of the microprocessors it is also possible to use a programmable logic for preprocessing of the measured values; sensor signals from external sensors S1 conveyed to the microprocessor MP1 over the digital signal processor can be fed in, etc.<br><br><br>
