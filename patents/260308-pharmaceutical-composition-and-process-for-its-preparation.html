[0001] This application claims priority from U.S.<br>
Provisional Patent Application Serial Number 60/600,907<br>
which was filed on August 12, 2004.<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] This invention relates to the field of<br>
controlled release delivery of biologically active<br>
compounds and to compositions and methods useful for the<br>
controlled release delivery of biologically active<br>
compounds containing at least one basic group.<br>
2.	Background of the Invention<br>
[0003] The ability to deliver biologically active<br>
compounds in a controlled manner over a period of time<br>
is an ongoing challenge. The controlled release delivery<br>
of biologically active compounds can improve the<br>
bioavailability by protecting them against degradation<br>
in vivo and concomitantly replace multiple injections or<br>
continuous infusions which are necessary due to the<br>
short half-life of these biologically active compounds.<br>
Reduced frequency for administration could improve<br>
patient compliance. Biodegradable polymers have been<br>
used for more than three decades as drug carriers in<br>
implantable devices [hanger, R. and Chasin, M. (Eds)<br>
Polymers as Drug Delivery Systems, Marcel Dekker, New<br>
York, NY, 1990] . The advantage of using biodegradable<br>
polymers as sustained delivery carriers for biologically<br>
active compounds is that they do not require removal<br>
after delivering their dose because they are hydrolyzed<br>
to soluble non-toxic oligomers or monomers. The<br><br>
biodegradation rate depends on the physicochemical<br>
properties of the polymers, including crystallinity,<br>
hydrophobicity, chemical structure, molecular weight and<br>
molecular weight distribution. Theoretically, these<br>
properties can be designed or tailored to develop drug<br>
delivery systems in a controlled release manner and<br>
desired duration of treatment.<br>
[0004] Various biologically active compounds have<br>
been described in the prior art in combination with<br>
biodegradable polymers to achieve extended release by<br>
using appropriate polymers under physiological<br>
conditions. The biologically active compound in<br>
compositions of the prior art can be in the form of an<br>
uncharged molecule, molecular complex, salt, ether,<br>
ester, or amide [OS 6,528,080, 5,739,176, 5,077,049 and<br>
OS 4,938,763]. Specific examples of salts used in<br>
injectable or implantable compositions include acetate,<br>
chloride, citrate, maleate, phosphate, succinate,<br>
sulfate, tartrate, etc. However, the success of such<br>
formulations is limited to a few biologically active<br>
compounds which are stable and have a wide therapeutic<br>
blood concentration range, e.g., leuprolide, gosorelin<br>
and rhGH. If a biologically active compound contains<br>
reactive functional groups and has a narrow therapeutic<br>
blood concentration window, the successful development<br>
of controlled release delivery systems for such a<br>
biologically active compound has been very challenging.<br>
This is primarily due to the instability of the<br>
biologically active compounds in the delivery systems<br>
and uncontrolled release pattern of the biologically<br>
active compounds from the delivery systems, e.g., burst<br>
effect at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end<br><br>
of the release. Some biologically active compounds<br>
contain basic groups (including primary, secondary, and<br>
tertiary amines) may pose serious obstacles for<br>
successful development of controlled release delivery<br>
systems using biodegradable polymers. The compounds may<br>
alter (or catalyze) the hydrolysis process of the<br>
polymer carrier in an uncontrolled mariner and/or react<br>
with the polymers or their degradation products to form<br>
undesired amide drug derivatives. The formation of these<br>
derivatives not only decreases the dose actually<br>
delivered, but also may causes unexpected side effect.<br>
The interaction/reaction between biologically active<br>
compound and polymer carriers may occur either 1) during<br>
formulation when the biologically active compounds are<br>
incorporated in the polymer carrier, such as<br>
microencapsulation, injection molding, extrusion<br>
molding, mixing with polymer solutions in organic<br>
solvent, etc.; 2) during storage and 3) during the<br>
process of biodegradation and the release of<br>
biologically active compounds in vivo.<br>
[0005] The interaction/reaction between biologically<br>
active compounds contain basic functional groups, i.e.,<br>
amines, and polymers were reported during the<br>
microparticle formation process using solvent<br>
evaporation/extraction methods where the biologically<br>
active compound and polymer were dissolved/dispersed in<br>
organic solvents [Krishnan M. and Flanagan DR., J<br>
Control Release. 2000 Nov 3;69 (2):273-81]. Significant<br>
amount of amide moieties were formed. It was clearly<br>
shown that commonly used solvents for fabrication of<br>
biodegradable polymer drug delivery systems could permit<br>
rapid reaction between biologically active compound and<br><br>
polymer. In another study, the accelerated degradation<br>
of polymers by organic amines was reported [Lin WJ,<br>
Flanagan DR, Linhardt RJ. Pharm Res. 1994<br>
Jul;11(7):1030-4. ]. It was also reported that the<br>
degradation of polymer matrix containing simple drug<br>
salts, e.g., epirubicin HC1, was found to hasten the<br>
degradation of the polymers and subsequently affect the<br>
release behavior from these particles [Birnjbaum DTr<br>
Brannon-Peppas L. Molecular weight distribution changes<br>
during degradation and release of PLGA nanoparticles<br>
containing epirubicin HC1. J Biomater Sci Polym Ed.<br>
2003/14 (1):87-102]. Domb et al reported the drugs<br>
containing reactive amines and their salts in the in<br>
vitro aqueous degradation media also expedites the<br>
degradation of biodegradable polymers [Domb AJ, Turovsky<br>
Lr Nudelman R., Pharm Res. 1994 Jun;ll(6) :865-8] . Both<br>
of the reaction and catalyzed degradation are<br>
undesirable for the controlled release delivery of<br>
biologically active compounds for a prolonged time<br>
period.<br>
[0006] When biodegradable polymers such as<br>
polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polyhydroxybutyric<br>
acid, polyortho-esters, polyacetals and the like are<br>
used as drug delivery systems, the biodegradation of<br>
polymers (such as polylactide and polylactide-co-<br>
glycolide for example) leads to water-uptake and<br>
generation of aqueous channels or pores from which<br>
biologically active compounds can leak out (or diffuse<br>
out) if they become water soluble. In addition, the<br>
accumulation of polymer degradation products lowers pH<br>
within the degrading polymer matrices and local pH<br>
values between 1.5 and 4.7 have been recently reported<br><br>
(Na DH, Youn YS, Lee SD, Son MO, Kim WA, DeLuca PP , Lee<br>
KC. Monitoring of peptide acylation inside degrading<br>
PLGA microspheres by capillary electrophoresis and<br>
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. J Control Release. 2003 Oct<br>
30;92 (3):291-9; and references cited therein). The<br>
acidic microenvironment" inside the polymer matrices can<br>
induce several undesired chemical degradation reactions,<br>
especially for the biologically active compounds<br>
containing reactive amine groups, such as peptides and<br>
proteins.<br>
[0007] More examples with respect to the instability<br>
or reaction/interaction of biologically active compounds<br>
and polymers during formulation, storage, and in vivo<br>
release in the prior art have been reviewed in the<br>
literature, [Schwendeman SP., Recent advances in the<br>
stabilization of proteins encapsulated in injectable<br>
PLGA delivery systems. Crit Rev Ther Drug Carrier Syst.<br>
2002;19 (1):73-98; Sinha VR, Trehan A., Biodegradable .<br>
microspheres for protein delivery.. J Control Release.<br>
2003 Jul 31;90(3):261-80J, which are all incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[0008] Some organic acids, such as acetic acid,<br>
citric acid, benzoic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid,<br>
heparin, ascorbic acid and their non-toxic salts, have<br>
been described in the prior art and used in various<br>
controlled release biodegradable systems as polymer<br>
degradation enhancers. {PCT-patent application<br>
W093/17668 (page 14, lines 4-13) and US patent<br>
4,675,189) {Column 11, lines 5-19). Thus, such acid<br>
additives are not expected to stabilize the polymers.<br>
[0009] Various other approaches have been<br>
investigated to achieve successful controlled release<br><br>
delivery of biologically active compounds containing<br>
reactive basic groups. However, despite tremendous<br>
research efforts, there are only a few products for<br>
controlled release delivery of biologically active<br>
compounds commercially available so far [see e.g.r US<br>
Pat. Nos. 4,728,721 (Leuprolide, Lupron Depot);<br>
4,938,763 (Leuprolide, Eligard); 5,225,205 (Triptorelin<br>
Pamoate, Trelstar); 4,767,628 (Goserelin Acetate,<br>
Zoladex); 5,538,739 (Octreotide, SANDOSTATIN LAR);<br>
5,654,010 (recombinant human growth hormone, Nutropin<br>
Depot); 4,675,189; 5,480,656; 4,728,721].<br>
[0010] Clearly, there is a need to develop novel and<br>
suitable delivery system which stabilizes the<br>
biologically active compounds, controls the degradation<br>
of polymers, limits the burst effect, and maintains drug<br>
release within therapeutic limits for the duration of<br>
the treatment. Thus, it is an object of this invention<br>
to address the above-enumerated deficiencies in the<br>
prior art and provide a pharmaceutical composition for<br>
controlled release delivery of biologically active<br>
compounds to a subject comprising:<br>
a)	a complex of a biologically active compound<br>
having at least one basic functional group and a<br>
polyanion derived from hexahydroxycyclohexane<br>
having at least two negatively charged functional<br>
groups; and<br>
b)	a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier comprising<br>
a biodegradable, water-insoluble polymer.<br>
[0011] The instant invention also provides methods<br>
for producing such controlled release pharmaceutical<br>
compositions and methods of use thereof.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] The present invention provides compositions<br>
and methods for the controlled release delivery of one<br>
or more biologically active compounds to a subject.<br>
Specifically, a pharmaceutical composition for<br>
controlled release delivery of biologically active<br>
compounds to a subject comprising: a) a complex of a<br>
biologically active compound having at least one basic<br>
functional group and a polyanion derived from<br>
hexahydroxycyclohexane having at least two negatively<br>
charged functional groups; and b) a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier comprising a biodegradable, water-<br>
insoluble polymer. . By complexing a biologically active<br>
compound with a polyanion, the tight, stable complex may<br>
be incorporated into a long-acting dosage system having<br>
a low initial burst release and a more desired drug<br>
release curve over time than that is found in much of<br>
the prior art.<br>
[0013] It is surprisingly found that the polyanions<br>
of the invention may reduce or prevent the<br>
interaction/reaction between biologically active<br>
compounds containing basic groups and polymers or their<br>
degradation products by forming stable complexes. The<br>
complexes may have low solubility' in water or biological<br>
fluid. Preferably the complexes also have low solubility<br>
in the solvents used to prepare the dosage form. These<br>
properties can not only stabilize the biologically<br>
active compound and slow the degradation of polymer<br>
during the formulation process, but also during release<br>
by reducing or preventing the interaction/reaction<br>
between the biologically active compound and the polymer<br>
and/or its degradation products. More importantly, these<br><br>
properties may result in the delivery of biologically<br>
active compounds from biodegradable polymer carriers<br>
with a highly desirable release profile. It can permit<br>
continuous delivery of a biologically active compound to<br>
a subject for prolonged periods of time, e.g., from<br>
weeks to months to benefit the subject.<br>
[0014] It is therefore an object of this invention<br>
to provide a pharmaceutical composition for controlled<br>
release delivery of biologically active compounds to a<br>
subject comprising: a) a complex of a biologically<br>
active compound having at least one basic functional<br>
group and a polyanion derived from<br>
hexahydroxycyclohexane having at least two negatively<br>
charged functional groups; and b) a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier comprising a biodegradable, water-<br>
insoluble polymer..<br>
[0015] It is a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a group of biologically active<br>
compounds containing at least one basic functional group<br>
that could benefit from the sustained controlled release<br>
delivery systems.<br>
[0016] It is a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a group of polyanions that can form<br>
stable complex with biologically active compounds.<br>
[0017] It is a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a process for making the complexes<br>
between a biologically active compound and a polyanion<br>
of the invention.<br>
[0018] It is a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a complex which may reduce or<br>
prevent the undesired degradation of polymers by the<br>
biologically active compound not only during the<br><br>
formulation and storage, but also during the degradation<br>
of polymer and drug release in vivo.<br>
[0019] It is a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a complex which may stabilize the<br>
biologically active compound not only during formulation<br>
and storage, but also during the degradation of polymer<br>
and drug release in vivo.<br>
[0020] It is a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier comprising biodegradable water insoluble<br>
polymers having dispersed therein the biologically<br>
active compound/polyanion complex that exhibits<br>
sustained release of the biologically active compound.<br>
[0021] It is a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
composition having incorporated therein the biologically<br>
active compound/polyanion complex that can release the<br>
biologically active compound which has retained their<br>
biological activities.<br>
[0022] It is a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
composition for use in medical applications, such as<br>
drug delivery, vaccination, gene therapy, etc.<br>
[0023] It is a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
composition suitable for oral or parenteral<br>
administrations; mucosal administration; ophthalmic<br>
administration; subcutaneous, intraarticular, or<br>
intramuscular injection; administrations by inhalation;<br>
and topical administrations.<br>
[0024] These and other objects of the present<br>
invention will become apparent after reading the<br><br>
following detailed description of the disclosed<br>
embodiments.<br>

[0029] The term "polyanion", as defined herein, is<br>
meant to include any molecules containing at least two<br>
or more negatively charged functional groups. Polyanions<br>
of the invention are derived from hexahydroxycyclohexane<br>
by esterifying with phosphate or sulfate groups capable<br>
of forming stable complexes with the biologically active<br>
compounds. Myo-inositol is one of nine known cis-trans<br>
isomers of hexahydroxycyclohexane, a 6-carbon ring<br>
structure found in abundance in plants and animals. For<br>
example, inositol hexaphosphate (InP6, phytic acid) is a<br>
natural dietary ingredient and constitutes 0.4-6.4%<br>
(w/w) of most cereals, legumes, nuts, oil seeds and<br>
soybean. An expanding body of evidence indicates that<br>
many, if not all, mammalian cells contain inositol<br>
polyphosphates with 5 or more phosphate groups. For<br>
example, InP6 is found in most mammalian cells, where it<br>
may assist in regulating a variety of important cellular<br>
functions. InP6 has also been shown to function as an<br>
antioxidant by chelating divalent cations such as copper<br>
and iron, preventing the generation of reactive oxygen<br>
species responsible for cell injury and carcinogenesis.<br>
Some other examples of inositol polyanion include, but<br>
not limited to, lower inositol phosphates, (i.e.,<br>
inositol pentaphosphate, inositol tetraphosphate,<br>
inositol triphosphate, inositol diphosphate), and other<br>
polyphosphorylated organic compounds, inositol<br>
hexasulphate (InS6) and lower inositol sulfates. The<br>
polyanions can be either in acid or in salt forms.<br><br>
[0030] The polyanions of at least two or more<br>
negatively charged groups are especially preferred, in<br>
particular, the inositol hexaphosphate (InP6, phytic<br>
acid), and inositol hexasulphate (InS6).<br>
[0031] The term " stable complex" is meant to refer<br>
to a physically and chemically stable complex that forms<br>
upon appropriate combining of a biologically active<br>
compound and polyanion under conditions such that a<br>
stable complex is formed, e.g., aqueous solutions of the<br>
biologically active compound and polyanion are mixed<br>
until the complex forms. The complex may be in the form<br>
of a solid (e.g., a paste, granules, a powder or a<br>
lyophili'zate) or the powdered form of the complex can be<br>
pulverized finely enough to be homogeneously dispersed<br>
in biodegradable polymer carriers. This complex<br>
typically takes the form of a precipitate that is<br>
produced upon combining aqueous preparations of the<br>
biologically active compound and polyanion. Optionally,<br>
one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may<br>
be incorporated into the complex. Such excipients may<br>
function as stabilizers for the biologically active<br>
compound or its complex. Non-limiting examples include<br>
sodium bisulfite, p-aminobenzoic acid, thiourea,<br>
glycine, methionine, mannitol, sucrose, polyethylene<br>
glycol (PEG), and the like.<br>
[0032] By way of example, a soluble antibiotics (e.g.<br>
doxorubicin) may be dissolved in water and a solution of<br>
InP6 may be added thereto. The drug:InP6 complex<br>
precipitates out. The precipitates can be washed and<br>
then separated by centrifugation or filtration. The<br>
separated complex was dried under vacuum.<br><br>
[0033] As a further example, to a solution of a local<br>
anesthetic (e.g. tetracaine hydrochloride) there may be<br>
added an aqueous solution of InP6. The drug:InP6 complex<br>
precipitates out.<br>
[0034] As a further example, to a solution of a<br>
peptide (e.g. glycagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1)) there may<br>
be added an aqueous solution of InP6. The peptide:InP6<br>
complex precipitates out. The precipitates can be washed<br>
and then separated by centrifugation or filtration. The<br>
separated complex was dried under vacuum.<br>
[0035] As a further example, to a solution of an<br>
enzyme (e.g. lysozyme) there may be added an aqueous<br>
solution of InP6. The enzyme:InP6 complex precipitates<br>
out. The precipitates can be washed and then separated<br>
by centrifugation or filtration. The separated complex<br>
was dried under vacuum.<br>
[0036] The stable complex between a biologically<br>
active compound and polyanion of the invention can be .<br>
incorporated into a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier<br>
comprising biodegradable water-insoluble polymers,<br>
optionally with some excipients. The term "biodegradable<br>
water-insoluble polymer" is meant to include any<br>
biocompatible and/or biodegradable synthetic and natural<br>
polymers that can be used in vivo. The "biodegradable<br>
water-insoluble polymer" is also meant"to include the<br>
polymers that are insoluble or become insoluble in water<br>
or biological fluid at 37 °C. The polymers may be<br>
purified, optionally, to remove monomers and oligomers<br>
using techniques known in the art (e.g, US Patent<br>
4,728,721). Some non-limiting examples of the polymers<br>
are polylactides, polyglycolides, poly(lactide-co-<br>
glycolide)s, polycaprolactones, polydioxanones,<br><br>
polycarbonates/ polyhydroxybutyrates, polyalkylene<br>
oxalates, polyanhydrides, polyamides, polyesteramides,<br>
polyurethanes, polyacetals, polyorthocarbonates,<br>
polyphosphazenes, polyhydroxyvalerates, polyalkylene<br>
succinates, and polyorthoesters, and copolymers, block<br>
copolymers, branched copolymers, terpolymers and<br>
combinations and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0037] Further, the biodegradable water-insoluble<br>
polymer can include end capped, end uncapped, or a blend<br>
of end capped, end uncapped polymers. An end capped<br>
polymer is generally defined as having capped carboxyl<br>
.end groups. An uncapped polymer is as classically<br>
defined in the art, specifically having free carboxyl<br>
end groups.<br>
[0038] Suitable molecular weights for polymers may be<br>
'determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Factors that may be considered when determining<br>
molecular weights include desired polymer degradation<br>
rate, mechanical strength, and rate of dissolution of<br>
polymer in solvent. Typically, a suitable range of<br>
molecular weights of polymers is of about 2,000 Daltons<br>
to about 150,000 Daltons with a polydispersity of from<br>
1.1 to 2.8, depending upon which polymer is selected for<br>
use, among other factors.<br>
[0039] As used herein, the term of "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier" is intended to include any carriers<br>
with environment responsive properties (e.g.,<br>
thermosensitive, pH sensitive, electrical sensitive,<br>
etc.), injectable solutions or suspensions, particles,<br>
films, pellets, cylinders, discs, microcapsules,<br>
microspheres, nanospheres, microparticles, wafers,<br><br>
micelles, liposomes, and other known polymeric<br>
configurations used for drug delivery.<br>
[0040] Methods for forming various pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable polymer carriers are well known in the art.<br>
For examples, various methods and materials are<br>
described in US Patents: 6,410,044; 5,698,213;<br>
6,312,679; 5,410,016; 5.529,914; 5,501,863; and PCT<br>
Publication No. WO 93/16687; 4.938,763; 5,278,201;<br>
5,278,202; EP 0,058,481; which are all incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[0041] According to the invention, compositions can<br>
be produced when biologically active compound/polyanion<br>
complex are dispersed in polymeric matrix to form solid<br>
implants, which can be injected or implanted to a<br>
subject. These implants can be prepared from the<br>
biologically active compound/polyanion complex of the<br>
invention, optionally containing pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients, using conventional polymer melt-<br>
processing techniques, such as, but not limited to,<br>
extrusion, compression and injection molding, wherein<br>
elevated temperatures (preferably less than 100 °C) are<br>
used to melt the polymer matrix in the preparation of<br>
the implant. Preparations of such implants can be<br>
carried out under aseptic conditions, or alternatively<br>
by terminal sterilization by irradiation, using but not<br>
limited to, Gamma irradiation or electron beam<br>
sterilization.<br>
[0042] According to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, homogeneous mixture of biologically active<br>
compound/polyanion complexes and polymers can be<br>
prepared by dry-mixing in any appropriate apparatus, for<br>
example in a ball mill, and at room temperature or even<br><br>
at a lower temperature, for example 
proportion of the powdered components can vary within a<br>
broad range, for example from 0.1 to 30% in weight for<br>
the biologically active compound, depending upon the<br>
therapeutic effects required. Homogeneous mixture of<br>
biologically active compound/polyanioii complexes and<br>
polymers can also be prepared by dispersing the<br>
complexes in polymer solution in an organic solvent,<br>
followed by the removal of- the organic solvent by<br>
evaporation or lyophilization. The resulting solid can<br>
be pulverized to fine powders.<br>
[0043] According to the invention, once a given<br>
mixture is well homogenized, it can be molded using the<br>
techniques known in the art. For example, it can be<br>
progressively compressed with progressive heating<br>
before being molded. The compression ratio may vary<br>
depending on numerous factors, such as the geometry of<br>
the apparatus or the grain size of the powdered mixture.<br>
The control of the preheating and -of the change it<br>
undergoes as the mixture progresses is more critical:<br>
depending upon the nature of the products to be treated<br>
(copolymer, biologically active compound), every<br>
endeavor is made to maintain a temperature gradient not<br>
exceeding approximately 100 °C. The initial temperature<br>
to which the powdered mixture is subjected can be 25 °C,<br>
lower or higher, depending on circumstances.<br>
[0044] The molding temperature should be kept as low<br>
as possible, preferably, not exceed 100 °C, and the upper<br>
limit of the temperature is dictated by the nature of<br>
the biologically active compound, which should not<br>
undergo deterioration. An adequate pressure and an<br>
adequate temperature promote the perfect homogenization<br><br>
of the ingredients and, in particular, the uniform<br>
distribution of the complex throughout the mass of the<br>
copolymer can be readily determined by simple<br>
experimentations.<br>
[0045] Alternatively, the homogenized powders can be<br>
compression molded at room temperature, similar to the<br>
preparation of FTIR pellet.<br>
[0046] In one embodiment of the invention, a<br>
copolymer of D,L-lactide and glycolide with a 50/50<br>
molar ratio of D,L-lactide to glycolide is dissolved in<br>
methylene chloride. To this solution, tetracaine phytate<br>
is added and dispersed with a high shear mixer. The<br>
resulting mixture is placed in a rotating evaporator and<br>
the majority of the methylene chloride is removed under<br>
vacuum. The resulting thick dispersion is poured onto a<br>
glass plate to form a film. The film thus obtained is<br>
melted and compression molded to give a film about 0.5<br>
mm thick.<br>
[0047] According to the invention, alternatively, the<br>
homogenized powders can be melted and compression<br>
extruded or injection molded into different shapes of<br>
solid implants as known in the art. The actual extrusion<br>
can be carried out by means of a nozzle of standard<br>
shape and dimensions. The cooling of the extruded<br>
product is achieved by any appropriate means, such as<br>
cold sterile air or gas or simply through natural loss<br>
of heat.<br>
[0048] According to the invention, these solid dosage<br>
forms, e.g., fiber, rod, film, or wafer, can be reduced<br>
to microparticulate forms by comminution or milling. The<br>
extruded or molded product described above adequately<br>
cooled is then pulverized at low temperature, preferably<br><br>
at a temperature lower than 0 °C, or even much lower, for<br>
example -20 °C. The product thus pulverized may then be<br>
subjected to sieving to obtain desired particle size.<br>
The preferred particle sizes may range from 1 Dm to 500<br>
Dm, and these microparticle delivery systems can be<br>
suspended in a suitable conventional pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable injection vehicle.<br>
[0049] According to another aspect of the invention,<br>
particularly effective and useful parenteral<br>
pharmaceutical formulations of biologically active<br>
compounds can also be prepared in the form of solutions<br>
or suspensions of a polymer in a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable solvent containing dispersed or solubilized<br>
drug/polyanion complex . By complexation with a<br>
polyahion, the reactive groups in biologically active<br>
compound are not available to interact with polymer in<br>
solution. Thus, the stability of biologically active<br>
compound in the compositions of the present invention<br>
was improved by complexing with polyanions of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0050] Thus, according to the present invention,<br>
however, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a biologically active compound complexed with<br>
a polyanion and a polymer, for extended release of the<br>
biologically active compound, characterized in that the<br>
composition is in the form of an injectable<br>
solution/suspension, comprising:<br>
(a) a complex of a biologically active compound<br>
having at least one basic functional group and a<br>
derivative of hexahydroxycyclohexane having at<br>
least two negatively charged functional groups; and<br>
(b) a biodegradable water-insoluble polymer;<br><br>
(c) a pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvent<br>
which is a solvent for the polymer<br>
[0051] Suitable biologically active compound and<br>
polyanion are those defined above, and particularly<br>
preferred polyanions are those containing at least two<br>
phosphate or sulfate groups as defined above, more<br>
preferably InP6 or InS6.<br>
[0052] The molar ratio of biologically active<br>
compound to polyanion in the complex will vary from<br>
0.1:1 to 1:0.1 according to the nature of biologically<br>
active compound and polyanion, and the period of peptide<br>
drug release desired.<br>
[0053] Any suitable biodegradable polymer can be<br>
employed, provided the polymer is insoluble or become<br>
insoluble in aqueous medium or body fluid at 37 °C.<br>
Suitable biodegradable polymers are those defined above.<br>
[0054] The type, molecular weight, and amount of<br>
biodegradable polymer present in the compositions can<br>
influence the length of time in which the biologically<br>
active compound is released from the controlled release<br>
implant. The selection of the type, molecular weight,<br>
and amount of biodegradable polymer present in the<br>
compositions to achieve desired properties of the<br>
controlled release implant can be performed by a person<br>
with ordinary skills in the art.<br>
[0055] Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable organic<br>
solvent include, but not limited to, N-methyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidone, N, N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide,<br>
propylene carbonate, caprolactam, triacetin, benzyl<br>
benzoate, benzyl alcohol, ethyl lactate, glyceryl<br>
triacetate, esters of citric acid, and polyethylene<br><br>
glycols, alkoxypolyethylene glycols and polyethylene<br>
glycol acetates, etc., or any combination thereof.<br>
[0056] The criteria for the organic solvents of<br>
biodegradable polymers are that they are<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable and miscible to dispersible<br>
in aqueous medium or body fluid. The suitable organic<br>
solvent should be able to diffuse into body fluid so<br>
that the liquid composition coagulates or solidifies to<br>
form an implant in place. Single and/or mixture of such<br>
solvents can be employed, the suitability of such<br>
solvents can be determined readily by simple<br>
experimentations.<br>
[0057] The pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
invention typically contain biologically active compound<br>
in a range of 0.1 to 40% w/v. In general, the optimal<br>
drug loading is dependent upon the period of release<br>
desired and the potency of the biologically active<br>
compound. Obviously, for biologically active compound<br>
of low potency and longer period of release, higher<br>
levels of incorporation may be required.<br>
[0058] The viscosity of the solution compositions of<br>
the invention is determined by the molecular weight of<br>
the polymer and organic solvent used. For example, when<br>
poly(lactide-co-glycolide) is used, the solution of<br>
polyester in NMP has a lower viscosity than in mPEG350.<br>
Typically, when the same solvent is used, the higher the<br>
molecular weight and concentration of the polymer, the<br>
higher the viscosity. Preferably the concentration of<br>
the polymer in solutions is below 70% by weight. More<br>
preferably concentration of the polymer in solutions is<br>
between 20 to 50% by weight.<br><br>
[0059] Preferably, the complex should have a low<br>
solubility in organic solvent used. The reactive groups<br>
of the biologically active compound will be bound to the<br>
polyanion and thus are not available for<br>
interaction/reaction with polymer or solvent. This<br>
greatly reduces the risk of unfavorable<br>
interaction/reaction with the polymer and its<br>
degradation products.<br>
[0060] According to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a simple salt, tetracaine chloride, is mixed<br>
with 50/50 poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) having a<br>
carboxy terminal group solution in NMP. For the in vitro<br>
studies, small drops of the mixture (about 100 mg) are<br>
added to phosphate buffered saline solution. The<br>
receiving fluid is replaced at selected time points with<br>
fresh solution, and the removed PBS solution is analyzed<br>
for drug concentration using appropriate analytical<br>
methods.<br>
[0061] According to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, tetracaine phytate is mixed with 50/50<br>
poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) having a carboxy terminal<br>
group solution in NMP. The drug complex was dispersed<br>
uniformly in the polymer solution. For the in vitro<br>
studies, small drops of the mixture (about 100 mg) are<br>
added to phosphate buffered saline solution. The<br>
receiving fluid is replaced at predefined time points<br>
with fresh solution, and the removed PBS solution is<br>
analyzed for drug concentration using appropriate<br>
analytical methods.<br>
[0062] According to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, octreotide phytate and octretide acetate were<br>
mixed with 50/50 poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) having a<br><br>
carboxy terminal group solution in NMP and<br>
methoxypolyethylene glycol 350. The drug complex was<br>
dispersed uniformly in the polymer solutions. The<br>
compositions were kept at room temperature.and the<br>
stability of octreotide in the composition was monitored<br>
by HPLC analysis over time. The complexation of<br>
octreotide with phytic acid significantly improved the<br>
stability of octreotide in the composition over time.<br>
[0063]According to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, octreotide phytate and octretide acetate were<br>
mixed with 50/50 poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) having a<br>
carboxy terminal group solution in NMP and<br>
methoxypolyethylene glycol 350. The drug complex was<br>
dispersed uniformly in the polymer solutions. The<br>
compositions were administered subcutaneously in<br>
Sprague-Dawley male rats to form an implant in place.<br>
The initial release of octreotide was determined by<br>
implant retrieval at predefined time intervals after<br>
administration and analysis of the octreotide remaining<br>
in the implant. The stability of octreotide during the<br>
formulation and release was also evaluated. The<br>
complexation of octreotide with phytic acid<br>
significantly lowered the initial release of octreotide<br>
and improved the stability of octreotide during the<br>
release process over time.<br>
[0064] The release of biologically active compound<br>
from these implants formed in place will follow the same<br>
general rules for release of a drug from a monolithic<br>
polymeric device. The release of biologically active<br>
compound can be affected by the size and shape of the<br>
implant, the loading of biologically active compound<br>
within the implant, the permeability factors involving<br><br>
the biologically active compound and the particular<br>
polymer, and the degradation of the polymer. Depending<br>
upon the amount of biologically active compound selected<br>
for delivery, the above parameters can be adjusted by<br>
one skilled in the art of drug delivery to give the<br>
desired rate and duration of release.<br>
[0065] The amount of injectable solution composition<br>
administered will typically depend upon the desired<br>
properties of the controlled release implant. For<br>
example, the amount of injectable solution composition<br>
can influence the length of time in which the<br>
biologically active compound is released from the<br>
controlled release implant.<br>
[0066] According to another aspect of the invention,<br>
compositions in the forms of microspheres are produced<br>
by encapsulating biologically active compound/polyanion<br>
complex in polymeric carrier. The biologically active<br>
compound/polyanion complex can be encapsulated using<br>
various biocompatible and/or biodegradable polymers<br>
having unique properties which are suitable for delivery<br>
to different biological environments or for effecting<br>
specific functions. The rate of dissolution and,<br>
therefore, delivery of biologically active compound is<br>
determined by the particular encapsulation technique,<br>
polymer composition, polymer crosslinking, polymer<br>
thickness, polymer solubility, size and solubility of<br>
biologically active compound/polyanion complex.<br>
[0067] Biologically active compound/polyanion complex<br>
to be encapsulated are suspended in a polymer solution<br>
in an organic solvent. The polymer solution must be<br>
concentrated enough to completely coat the biologically<br>
active compound/polyanion complex after they are added<br><br>
to the solution. Such an amount is one which provides a<br>
weight ratio of biologically active compound/polyanion<br>
complex to polymer between about 0.01 and about 50,<br>
preferably between about 0.1 and about 30. The<br>
biologically active compound/polyanion complex should be<br>
kept suspended and not allowed to aggregate as they are<br>
coated by contact with the polymer.<br>
[0068] Preferably, the complex should have a very low<br>
solubility in organic solvent used. The reactive groups<br>
of the biologically active compound will be bound to the<br>
polyanion and thus are not available for interaction<br>
with polymer or solvent. This greatly reduces the risk<br>
of unfavorable interaction with the polymer.<br>
[0069] A polymer solution of the biologically active<br>
compound/polyanion complex can therefore be subjected to<br>
a variety of microencapsulation techniques including<br>
spray drying, spray congealing, emulsion, solvent<br>
evaporation emulsion.<br>
[0070] According to one embodiment of the invention,<br>
the biologically active compound/polyanion complex is<br>
suspended in a polymer solution in an organic solvent.<br>
The suspended complexes or microparticles along with the<br>
polymer and organic solvent are transferred to a larger<br>
volume of an aqueous solution containing an emulsifier.<br>
In the aqueous solution, the suspended complexes are<br>
immersed in the aqueous phase, where the organic solvent<br>
evaporates or diffuses away from the polymer. The<br>
solidified polymer encapsulates the biologically active<br>
compound/polyanion complex to form a composition. The<br>
emulsifier helps to reduce the interfacial surface<br>
tension between the various phases of matter in the<br>
system during the hardening phase of the process.<br><br>
Alternatively, if the encapsulating polymer has some<br>
inherent surface activity, there may be no need for<br>
addition of a separate surface active agent.<br>
[0071] Emulsifiers useful to prepare encapsulated<br>
biologically active compound/polyanion complex according<br>
to this invention include poloxamers and polyvinyl<br>
alcohol as exemplified herein, surfactants and other<br>
surface active compounds which can reduce the surface<br>
tension between the polymer encapsulated biologically<br>
active compound/polyanion complex and the solution.<br>
[0072] Organic solvents useful to prepare the<br>
microspheres of the present invention include acetic<br>
acid, acetone, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate,<br>
chloroform and other non-toxic solvents which will<br>
depend on the properties of the polymer. Solvents should<br>
be chosen that solubilize the polymer and are ultimately<br>
non-toxic.<br>
[0073] A preferred embodiment of this invention is<br>
that the integrity of the biologically active<br>
compound/polyanion complex is maintained during the<br>
encapsulation process. The complexation is maintained<br>
during the suspending process by using an organic<br>
solvent in which the biologically active<br>
compound/polyanion complex has a very low solubility.<br>
Subsequently, once the coated complexes are transferred<br>
to the aqueous solvent, rapid hardening of the polymeric<br>
carrier and sufficient encapsulation of the biologically<br>
active compound/polyanion complex in the previous step<br>
shields the complex material from dissolution.<br>
[0074] The polymers used to encapsulate the<br>
biologically active compound/polyanion complex can be<br>
either homo-polymers or co-polymers as described above.<br><br>
[0075] In another embodiment/ double-walled polymer<br>
coated microspheres may be advantageous. Double-walled<br>
polymer coated microspheres may be produced by preparing<br>
two separate polymer solutions in methylene chloride or<br>
other solvent which can dissolve the polymers. [See<br>
Pekarek, K. J.; Jacob, J. S. and Mathxowitz, E. Double-<br>
walled polymer microspheres for controlled drug release,<br>
Nature, 1994, 361, 258-260] . The biologically active<br>
compound/polyanion complex are added to one of the<br>
solutions and dispersed. Here, the biologically active<br>
compound/polyanion complex become coated with the first<br>
polymer. Then, the solution containing the first polymer<br>
coated biologically active compound/polyanion complex is<br>
combined with the second polymer solution. Now, the<br>
second polymer encapsulates the first polymer which is<br>
encapsulating the biologically active compound/polyanion<br>
complex. Ideally, this solution is then dripped into a<br>
larger volume of an aqueous solution containing a<br>
surface active agent or emulsifier. In the aqueous<br>
solution, the solvent evaporates from the two polymer<br>
solutions and the polymers are precipitated to<br>
encapsulate the complex.<br>
[0076] Although the formulations described above are<br>
primarily those for injectable or implantable routes of<br>
administration, the biologically active<br>
compound/polyanion complex of the invention may also be<br>
used in the manufacture of orally, nasally, or topically<br>
administrable formulations.<br>
[0077] Thus, according to the present invention, the<br>
compositions containing the biologically active<br>
compound/polyanion complex can be administered to a<br>
subject where sustained controlled release delivery of a<br><br>
biologically active compound is desired. As used herein,<br>
the term "subject" is intended to include warm-blooded<br>
animals, preferably mammals, most preferably humans.<br>
[0078] As used herein, the term "administered to a<br>
subject" is intended to refer to dispensing, delivering<br>
or applying a composition (e.g., pharmaceutical<br>
formulation) to a subject by any suitable route for<br>
delivery of the composition to the desired location in<br>
the subject, including delivery by oral, by nasal, by<br>
injection and/or implantation subcutaneously,<br>
intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, intradermally,<br>
intravenously, intraarterially, or intrathecally, by<br>
administration to mucosal membranes, or by in situ<br>
delivery to provide the desired dosage of a biologically<br>
active compound based on the known parameters for<br>
treatment of the various medical conditions with the<br>
biologically active compound.<br>
[0079] The term " controlled release delivery", as<br>
defined herein, is intended to refer to continual<br>
delivery of a pharmaceutical agent in vivo over a period<br>
of time following administration, preferably at least<br>
several days to weeks or months. Sustained controlled<br>
release delivery of the agent can be demonstrated by,<br>
for example, the continued therapeutic effect of the<br>
agent over time (e.g., for GLP-1, sustained delivery of<br>
the peptide can be demonstrated by continued Ale<br>
reductions over time). Alternatively, sustained delivery<br>
of the agent may be demonstrated by detecting the<br>
presence of the agent in vivo over time.<br>

then lyophilized. The yield is 187 mg (88.5%).<br>
[0083] The solubility of doxorubicin phytate was<br>
measured in deionized water, phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS, pH 7.4), Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO),<br>
Dimethylacetamide (DMAC), IV-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP),<br>
and methoxypolyethylene glycohol 350 (mPEG). Results<br>
are shown in the table below:<br><br><br>
chloride (DCM). The above organic phase was emulsified<br>
in 500 mL of 1.0% (w/v) PVA solution which was pre-<br>
cooled in the refrigerator (~4°C) . The emulsion was<br>
continued to stir for 3 h at RT to evaporate the DCM.<br>
The hardened microspheres were collected by decanting<br>
off the supernatant, washed three times with deionized<br>
water, and then freeze-dried. Reddish microspheres were<br>
obtained. The drug content in the microspheres is ~5.1%<br>
as determined by HPLC.<br>
[0085] The microspheres containing DOX-HC1 were<br>
prepared by using DOX-HC1 in the place of DOX-PA using<br>
the same procedure above.<br>
Example 3 — Preparation of encapsulated doxorubicin<br>
phytate<br>
[0086] The doxorubicin phytate prepared in Example 1<br>
is encapsulated in polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)<br>
using a double emulsion method. 1.4 mg of doxorubicin<br>
phytate is added in methylene chloride containing PLGA<br>
(0.6 g PLGA/ml solvent; 20 ml). The mixture is<br>
homogenized for 30 sec at 3,000 rpm, using a homogenizer<br>
with a microfine tip. The resulting suspension is<br>
transferred to a stirred tank (2000 ml) containing 1%<br>
poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and methylene chloride (4.5<br>
ml). The solution is mixed at 1,000 rpm for 1 min. The<br>
microspheres in the PVA solution are precipitated by<br>
immersion in distilled water, washed and filtered. The<br>
microspheres are then washed with distilled water<br>
containing 0.1% Tween, to reduce agglomeration and dried<br>
with nitrogen for 2 days at 4 °C.<br>
Example 4 - Preparation of tetracaine phytate<br>
[0087] 1.0 g tetracaine hydrochloride {3.33 mmol) was<br>
dissolved in 40 mL water and with vigorous stirring,<br>
20.5 mL of the phytic acid solution of Example 1 was<br><br>
added. After another 30 min of stirring, the<br>
precipitate was centrifuged and washed with water. The<br>
final products were in the form of white powder. The<br>
solubility of the complex in different buffers is shown<br>
: below.<br><br>
[0088] Polymer (e.g., poly(lactide-co-glycolide)<br>
(PLGA) microspheres were prepared by an oil-in-water<br>
(O/W) single emulsion technique. PLGA was dissolved in<br>
methylene chloride (DCM). For the encapsulation of<br>
tetracaine, the drug was mixed with the PLGA solution in<br>
DCM. The mixed solution or suspension was emulsified in<br>
500 mL of 0.5-1% (w/v) PVA (PVA, 88% hydrolyzed, average<br>
molecular weight of 31,000-50,000, Sigma-Aldrich)<br>
solution pre-cooled in the refrigerator at 4 °C. The<br>
emulsion was stirred continuously for 3 h at RT to<br>
evaporate the DCM. The hardened microspheres were<br>
collected, washed three times with deionized water, and<br>
then freeze-dried.<br>
[0089] In the case of preparation of microspheres<br>
containing tetracaine phytate (TCPA), 210 mg of TCPA was<br>
suspended in 5 mL PLGA solution. The suspension was<br>
sonicated for 10 min. This suspension was slowly added<br>
to the continuous phase (1% PVA solution) pre-cooled at<br>
4 °C while stirring. The emulsion was stirred<br>
continuously for 3 h at room temperature to evaporate<br>
the DCM. The hardened microspheres were collected,<br>
washed three times with deionized water, and then<br>
freeze-dried. The tetracaine load was about 3.2%.<br><br>
[0090] Polymer microspheres containing tetracaine<br>
hydrochloride (TC-HC1) were prepared in a similar manner<br>
by replacing TCPA with TC-HCl.<br>
Example 6 — Preparation of pellets containing tetracaine<br>
phytate<br>
[0091] Implantable pellets containing tetracaine<br>
phytate was prepared by compression molding process.<br>
249 mg PLGA powder were thoroughly mixed with 25.7 mg<br>
tetracaine phytate using a mortar and pestle. Then ~50<br>
mg mixture were molded using a Delta Press to form a<br>
pellet. The pellets containing tetracaine hydrochloride<br>
were also prepared for comparison.<br>
Example 7 — Preparation of implants containing<br>
tetracaine phytate<br>
[0092] 2.56 g of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)<br>
(RG504H, from Boehringer-Ingelheim) is dissolved in 7.73<br>
grams of methylene chloride. To this solution, 256 mg of<br>
tetracaine phytate is added and dispersed with a high<br>
shear mixer.<br>
[0093] The resulting mixture is placed in a rotating<br>
evaporator and the majority of the methylene chloride is<br>
removed under vacuum. The resulting thick dispersion is<br>
poured onto a glass plate and spread with an adjustable<br>
blade set at 0.7 mm.<br>
[0094] The film thus obtained is melted and<br>
compression molded at 80 °C to give a film about 0.5 mm<br>
thick. The film is incubated in phosphate buffered<br>
saline (containing 0.02% sodium azide) at pH 7.4 and 37<br>
°C, and the buffer solution is assayed periodically by DV<br>
to determine the amount of tetracaine released.<br>
[0095] Similar molded implants can be manufactured<br>
using, in place of tetracaine, other biologically active<br>
compound containing at least one basic functional group.<br><br>
Example 8 — Injectable formulations of tetracaine<br>
phytate and its in vitro release<br>
[0096] 40% (w/v) of poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide)<br>
(PLGA) having a carboxy terminal group solution in NMP<br>
is prepared by dissolving 160 mg of PLGA (RG503H, from<br>
Boehringer-Ingelheim) in 0.4 mL NMP. 39.9 mg of<br>
tetracaine phytate is mixed with the polymer solution by<br>
syringe flushing. Small drops of the mixture (about 100<br>
mg) are added to phosphate buffered saline solution at<br>
pH 7.4. The receiving fluid is replaced at selected time<br>
points with fresh solution, and the removed" PBS solution<br>
is analyzed for drug concentration using UV detection at<br>
280 nm.<br>
Example 9 - Preparation of the complex of lidocaine with<br>
phytic acid<br>
[0097] 1.0 g lidocaine hydrochloride (3.69 mmol) is<br>
dissolved in 400 mL water and with vigorous stirring,<br>
28.8 mL of the phytate solution of Example 1 is added.<br>
After 30 min, the pH is adjusted to 3.5 with 0.1 N HC1<br>
solution. After another 30 min of stirring, the<br>
precipitate is filtered and washed 4 times with water.<br>
The final product is lyophilized.<br>
Example 10 - Preparation of the complex of amoxicillin<br>
with phytic acid<br>
[0098] 1.0 g amoxicillin hydrochloride (2.74 mmol) is<br>
dissolved in 400 mL water and with vigorous stirring,<br>
21.3 mL of the phytate solution of Example 1 is added.<br>
After 30 min, the pH is adjusted to 3.5 with 0.1 N HC1<br>
solution. After another 30 min of stirring, the<br>
precipitate is filtered and washed 4 times with water.<br>
The final product is lyophilized.<br>
[0099] Similar complexes may be manufactured by using, in<br>
place of amoxicillin hydrochloride, other compounds<br>
containing at least one basic group.<br><br>
Example 11 — Preparation of the complex of octreotide<br>
with phytic acid<br>
[00100] 20 mg/mL solution of octreotide was prepared<br>
by dissolving 215 mg octreotide in 10.75 mL water. 5 mL<br>
of this solution was mixed with 1.45 ml of PA solution<br>
(1%, w/v) at pH 3.12. The mixture was vortexed for 1<br>
min and then the mixture was put on a rotator to mix for<br>
another hour. The complex was separated by<br>
centrifugation and rinsed with water once. The<br>
precipitated product was freeze dried for 48 h. The<br>
final product in the form of white powder was obtained.<br>
Example 12 — The Stability of Octreotide in Injectable<br>
formulations<br>
[00101] Injectable formulations of octreotide were<br>
prepared by dispersing octreotide in polymer solution in<br>
an appropriate solvent. For example, poly(DL-lactide-co-<br>
glycolide) (PLGA) having a 50/50 ratio of lactide to<br>
glycolide (PLG DL2.5A from Alkermes) was dissolved in N-<br>
methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), or methoxypolyethylene<br>
glycohol (mPEG), or polyethylene glycohol dimethyl ether<br>
(PEGDM) to give a 40% solution by weight. The injectable<br>
formulations were prepared by dispersing octreotide<br>
phytate or acetate in the polymer solutions. The<br>
mixture was thoroughly mixed until a uniform suspension<br>
or solution was obtained-. Six injectable formulations<br>
were prepared as shown below.<br><br><br><br>
[00102] The stability of octreotide in the above<br>
injectable formulations at room temperature was<br>
monitored by HPLC and the results are shown in the table<br>
below. The complexation of octreotide with phytic acid<br>
completely prevented the degradation and/or acylation of<br>
octreotide in PLGA solutions in mPEG and PEGDM, while a<br>
slight degradation of octreotide was observed in PLGA<br>
solutions in NMP at room temperature over time. When<br>
octreotide acetate was used, significant amount of the<br>
octreotide was degraded or reacted after three days at<br>
room temperature. In the case of PLGA solution in NMP,<br>
almost 100% of octreotide was degraded or acylated.<br>
Therefore, octreotide phytate would be the preferred<br>
form to prepare stable formulations containing the<br>
peptide.<br><br><br>
Example 13 - The Stability of Octreotide in Injectable<br>
formulations<br>
[00103] Poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) having a<br>
50/50 ratio of lactide to glycolide (DL2.5A from<br>
Alkermes) was. dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP),<br>
or methoxypolyethylene glycohol (mPEG) to give a 40%<br>
solution by weight. The injectable polymer solutions<br>
were prepared by dispersing octreotide phytate or<br>
acetate or citrate. The mixture was thoroughly mixed<br>
until a uniform suspension or solution was obtained.<br>
Injectable formulations were prepared as shown below.<br><br>
[00104] The stability of octreotide in the above<br>
injectable formulations at room temperature was<br>
monitored by HPLC and the results are shown in the table<br>
below. It appears that both salt forms of octreotide<br>
and the solvent affect the stability of octreotide. In<br>
terms of the stability of octreotide, mPEG is preferred<br>
than NMP and phytate complex form of octreotide is<br>
preferred than acetate and citrate salt of octreotide.<br><br><br><br>

Octreotide in citrate form; /Pa: Octreotide in phytate<br>
form.<br>
Example 14 - Initial Release of Octreotide in vivo in<br>
Rats<br>
. [00105] Poly{DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) was<br>
dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), or<br>
methoxypolyethylene glycohol (mPEG) to give a 40%<br>
solution by weight. The injectable formulations were<br>
prepared by dispersing octreotide phytate or acetate.<br>
The mixture was thoroughly mixed until a uniform<br>
suspension or solution was obtained. Injectable<br>
formulations prepared are shown in the table below.<br>
These formulations of octreotide (roughly about 100 uL)<br>
were administered subcutaneously in the back of the<br>
Sprague-Dawley male rats. The release of octreotide was<br>
determined by implant retrieval at predefined time<br>
intervals (30 min for group G and 24 h for groups A<br>
through F) after administration and analysis of the<br>
octreotide remaining in the implant. The stability of<br>
octreotide during the formulation and release was also<br>
evaluated.<br><br><br><br>
[00106] Formulations A and G are similar with a slight<br>
higher drug content for G, but the animals were<br>
harvested and implants were retrieved at different time<br>
points. The results appear to show the gradual release<br>
of octreotide over time. The octreotide released from<br>
the implants was about 3.29±7.73% in group G at 0.5 hour<br>
and 10.82±7.10% in group A at 24 hours post<br>
administration. Comparing to formulation B, the<br>
complexation of octreotide with phytic acid<br>
significantly improved both initial release and<br>
stability of the peptide in the formulation and release<br>
processes. The results also showed that mPEG was a<br>
preferred solvent over NMP in terms of octreotide<br>
stability. NMP seems to be a better solvent for both<br>
octreotide and PLGA which may promote the acylation<br>
reaction between octreotide and PLGA or its degradation<br>
products.<br>
[00107] The results on octreotide stability in<br>
PLGA/NMP vehicle correlate to those obtained in vitro<br>
(refer to example 13 &amp; 14) . However, the<br>
degradation/reaction rate seemed slower in vivo than<br>
that in vitro (30% vs 85% after 24 h). This difference<br><br>
could be explained by the fact that the implant was<br>
quickly formed after administration by dissipating<br>
solvent NMP to the surrounding tissues of the animals.<br>
The solvent dissipation would result in the increase of<br>
viscosity of the vehicle or solidification of the PLGA,<br>
leading to a slower reaction rate between octreotide and<br>
PLGA or its degradation products. However, the solvent<br>
dissipation was a slow process as significant amount of<br>
NMP (up to 35%) could still be detected in the implant<br>
24 hours after administration. This indicates that the<br>
residual solvent may be trapped in the implant much<br>
longer than desired. Therefore, the use of biologically<br>
active compound in its more stable form is very<br>
important to develop a beneficial formulation.<br>
Example 15 - In Vivo Release of Octreotide in Rats<br>
[00108] The injectable formulations were prepared by<br>
dispersing octreotide phytate in Poly(DL-lactide-co-<br>
glycolide) (PLGA) solution in mPEG350. The mixture was<br>
thoroughly mixed until a uniform suspension was<br>
obtained. Injectable formulations prepared are shown in<br>
the table below. These formulations of octreotide<br>
(roughly about 100 uL) were administered subcutaneously<br>
in the back of the Sprague-Dawley male rats. The<br>
release of octreotide was determined by implant<br>
retrieval at predefined time intervals after<br>
administration and analysis of the octreotide remaining<br>
in the implant. The stability of octreotide during the<br>
formulation and release was also evaluated.<br><br><br><br><br>
[00109] The initial release of OCT from formulations A<br>
and B were 11.1+1.7 % and 14.0+4.2 % respectively, while<br>
from formulations C, D, and E were 0.4+2.0 %, 1.5±2.7 %,<br>
and 3.8+4.5 % respectively. Although the difference was<br>
not statistically significant, there seems a tendency<br>
that the initial release of OCT increases with the<br>
decrease of polymer concentration. In addition, OCT was<br>
stable during the formulation process and in vivo<br>
release in these formulations.<br>
Example 16 — Preparation of the complex of glycagon like<br>
peptide,1 (GLP-1) with phytic acid<br>
[00110] ' 50 mg GLP-1 acetate (Mw 3297.7, 0.0152 mmol)<br>
was dissolved in 5 ml water and with vigorous stirring,<br>
1.01 mL of 1% phytic acid solution at pH 3.2 was added<br>
(a molar ratio of GLP-1:phytate = 1:1). After another<br>
30 min of stirring, the mixture was centrifuged. The<br>
supernatant was decanted off and the precipitate was '<br>
rinsed twice with water and then freezedried. The final<br>
product was in the form of white powder.<br>

[00111] 50 mg GLP-1 acetate (Mw 3297.7, 0.0152 mmol)<br>
was dissolved in 5 ml water and with vigorous stirring,<br>
1.35 mL of 1% potassium inositol hexasulfate (InS6)<br>
solution at pH 1.0 was added (a molar ratio of GLP-<br>
l:InS6 = 1:1). After another 30 min of stirring, the<br>
mixture was centrifuged. The supernatant was decanted<br>
off and the precipitate was rinsed twice with water and<br>
then freeze-dried. The final product was in the form of<br>
white powder.<br>
Example 18 - Preparation of the complex of PYY with<br>
phytic acid<br>
[00112] 1.0 g PYY acetate (0.247 mmol) is dissolved in<br>
100 mL water and with vigorous stirring, 11.5 mL of the<br>
phytate solution of Example 1 is added (a molar ratio of<br>
PYY:phytate = 1:1). After another 30 min of stirring,<br>
the precipitate is filtered and washed 4 times with<br>
water. The final product is lyophilized.<br>
Example 19 — Preparation of lysozyme phytate<br>
[00113] 100 mg lysozyme (7.1 Qmol) was dissolved in 40<br>
mL water and with vigorous stirring, 3.1 DL of the<br>
phytate solution of Example-1 was added. After another<br>
30 min of stirring, the precipitate was filtered, washed<br>
4 times with water, and lyophilized. The final product<br>
in the form of white powder was obtained.<br>
[00114] Similar complexes may be manufactured by<br>
using, in place of lysozyme, either naturally occurring<br>
peptides/proteins or their synthetic analogues.<br><br>
