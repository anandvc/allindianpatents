PFIZER INC., a corporation organised under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America., of 235 East 42nd Street, New York, New York, 10017, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>

wherein 5     A represents N;<br>
R1 represents H, lower alkyl (which alkyl group is optionally interrupted by<br>

which process comprises the dehydrogenation of a compound of general formula II,<br><br>
wherein A, R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined above,<br>
which process is referred to hereinafter as "the process of the invention'<br>
10 The compounds of general formulae I and II can be represented by the formulae IA and IB and IIA and IIB as detailed hereinafter. The novel process according to the present invention includes compounds of the formulae IA, IB, IIA and IIB.<br><br><br>
The  term  "aryr",  when used herein,  includes   six-  to  ten-membered 5     carbocyclic aromatic groups, such as phenyl and naphthyl and the like.<br>
Het groups may be fully saturated, partly unsaturated, wholly aromatic,<br>
partly aromatic and/or bicyclic in character.    Het groups that may be<br>
mentioned   include   groups   such, as   optionally   substituted   azetidinyl,<br>
10    pyirolidinyl,   imidazolyl,   indolyl,    oxadiazolyl,   thiadiazolyl,   triazolyl,<br><br>
tetrazolyl, oxatriazolyl, thiatriazolyl, pyridazinyl, morpholinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, piperidinyl, pyrazolyl, imidazopyridinyl, piperazinyl, thienyl and furanyl.<br>
5 The point of attachment of any Het group may be via any atom in the ring system including (where appropriate) a heteroatom. Het groups may also be present in the N- or S-oxidised form.<br>
The term "lower alkyl" (which includes the alkyl part of alkylHet and       alkylaiyl groups), when used herein, includes C1-6 alkyl (e.g. C1-4 alkyl). Unless otherwise specified, alkyl groups may, when there is a sufficient number of carbon atoms, be linear or branched, be saturated or unsaturated, be cyclic, acyclic or part cyclic/acyclic, and/or be substituted by one or more halo atoms.<br>
15<br>
As defined herein, the term "halo" includes fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.<br>
Compounds of formulae I, IA and IB may contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and may therefore exhibit optical and/or diastereoisomerism.<br>
20 The process of the invention thus also relates to the formation of stereoisomers of compounds of formulae I, IA and IB and mixtures thereof. Stereoisomers may be separated using conventional techniques, e.g. chromatography or fractional crystallisation. The various stereoisomers may be isolated by separation of a racemic or other mixture of the compounds<br>
25 using conventional, e.g. fractional crystallisation or HPLC, techniques. Alternatively the desired optical isomers may be made by reaction of the appropriate optically active starting materials under conditions which will not cause racemisation or epimerisation, or by derivatisation, for example with a<br><br><br>
homocbiral acid followed by separation of the diastereomeric esters by conventional means (e.g. HPLC, crystallisation, chromatography over silica or, for example, via classical resolution with a homochiral acid salt).   The formation of all stereoisomers is included within the scope of the invention. 5<br>
Preferred compounds of formulae I, IA and IB include those in which: R1 represents C1-4 alkyl, which alkyl group is optionally interrupted by an oxygen atom, and/or is optionally terminated by a Het group (such as a pyridmyl group); 10     R2 represents C1-4 alkyl;<br>
. R3 represents C1-5 alkyl, which alkyl group is optionally interrupted by an oxygen atom; R4 represents C1-3 alkyl.<br>
15     More preferred compounds of formulae I, IA and IB mclude those in which: R1 represents linear C1-3alkyl, which alkyl group is optionally interrupted by an oxygen atom, or is optionally terminated by a 2-pyridinyl group (e.g. to form a 2-pyridinylmethyl group); R2 represents linear C2-3 alkyl;<br>
20     R3 represents linear or branched C2-4 alkyl, which alkyl group is optionally interrupted by an oxygen atom; R4 represents C1-2 alkyl.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds that may be formed in the process of the 25     invention include sildenafil, and the following four compounds:<br><br><br><br><br>
The process of the invention may be carried out in accordance with reaction conditions known to those skilled in the art in the presence of a suitable dehydrogenation agent (for example: a catalyst such as palladium on carbon (e.g. 5% Pd/C or 10% Pd/C), preferably in the presence of a hydrogen acceptor such as cyclohexene or maleic acid and/or an acid such as<br><br><br>
trifluoroacetic acid, HC1 or H2S04; a high oxidation potential quinone such as 2,3,5,6-tetracrdoro-l,4~benzoquinone or 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-benzoquinone; (atmospheric) oxygen; Mn02; or triphenylmethanol in trifluoroacetic acid). A hydrogen sulfite salt such as sodium hydrogen 5 sulfite may also serve to effect removal of hydrogen from the compound of general formula II (HA and HB). Preferred dehydrogenation agents include catalysts such as 5% Pd/C or 10% Pd/C, preferably in the presence of a hydrogen acceptor such as cyclohexene or maleic acid and/or an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid. The reaction may be carried out in an appropriate 10 organic solvent system, which solvent system should not significantly react chemically with, or significantly give rise to stereochemical changes in, the reactants or product once formed, or significantly give rise to other side reactions. Preferred solvent systems include aromatic hydrocarbons, such toluene and xylene.<br>
15<br>
The process of the invention may be carried at above room temperature (e.g. between 125 and 250Â°C, preferably 150 and 230Â°C, more preferably 175 and 220Â°C, depending upon the solvent system that is employed), and/or at high pressure (e.g. between 13.8 and 68.9 kPa (2 and 10 psi), preferably 20 between 27.6 and 41.4 kPa (4 and 6 psi), such as around 34.5 kPa (5 psi)), and/or, optionally, in an inert atmosphere (i.e. in the presence of an inert gas, such as nitrogen or argon).<br>
Appropriate reaction times and reaction temperatures depend upon the 25     solvent system that is employed, as well as the compound that is to be formed, but these may be determined routinely by the skilled person.<br><br><br>
We have found that compounds of general formula II (and IIA and KB) hereinbefore defined may be prepared, advantageously, by way of reaction of an aldehyde compound of formula HI,<br><br>
wherein A, R3 and R4 are as hereinbefore defined, with a compound of formula IV,<br><br>
wherein R and R2 are as hereinbefore defined.<br>
10 This condensation/cyclisation reaction may be carried out at above room temperature (e.g. at around the reflux temperature of the solvent that is employed) in the presence of a suitable solvent (for example: an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as toluene or xylene; chlorobenzene; or diphenylether). This reaction may also be carried out under pressure at a higher temperature<br>
15     than the reflux temperature of the relevant solvent that is employed.<br><br>
The compounds of general formula IV may be represented by the formulae IVAandlVB.<br><br><br><br><br>
10<br>
15<br><br>
Advantageously, we have found that compounds of general formula I (and IA and IB) hereinbefore defined may be formed directly from corresponding compounds of formula III in a "one pot" procedure, in which a compound of formula III is reacted with a compound of general formula IV at high temperature, and under pressure, using an appropriate reaction vessel. Following this reaction, the dehydrogenation agent(s) may be added to the reaction vessel and the dehydrogenation reaction performed on the intermediate compound of formula IIA or IIB, formed in situ, under similar conditions to those described hereinbefore.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it is believed that the reaction between compounds III and IV proceeds via either an imine intermediate of general structure:<br><br>
20<br><br><br>
or an aminol intennediateof general structure:<br><br>
to form the compound of general formula II as hereinbefore defined.<br><br>
Compounds of formula III may be prepared by known techniques.   For example:<br>
(a) Compounds of formula III in which A represents CH may be prepared 5     from readily available starting materials of formula V,<br><br>
wherein R3 is as hereinbefore defined, in analogous fashion to the techniques described in German patent application DE 24 44 720, the disclosure in which document is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
10<br>
(b) Compounds of formula HI in which A represents CH may alternatively be prepared by oxidation of a compound of formula VI,<br><br><br><br><br>
15<br><br>
wherein R3 and R4 are as hereinbefore defined, in the presence of a suitable oxidising agent (for example: Mn02; tetra-7?-propylammomum perruthenate (catalytic) combined with 4-methylmorpholine N-oxide; or oxafyl chloride combined with dimefhylsulfoxide and triethylamine) and an appropriate organic  solvent  (for  example:   acetone;  dichloromethane;   an aromatic<br><br>
hydrocarbon  (e.g.   toluene  or xylene);   chlorobenzene;   or  an  aliphatic hydrocarbon (e.g. pentane, hexane or petroleum ether)).<br>
Compounds of formula VI may be prepared directly by reduction of a 5     corresponding carboxylic acid of formula VH,<br><br>
wherein R3 and R4 are as hereinbefore defined, under conditions known to those skilled in the art (for example, using: L1AIH4; borane; NaBH4, added after activation with iodine; diisobutylaiuminium hydride; or NaBH4 10 combined with an acid activating agent (e.g. carbonyldiimidazole, thionyl chloride or methyl chloroformate)). Compounds of formula VII may be prepared according to, or by analogy with, methods described in European patent application EP 812 845.<br>
15 However, in order to prepare compounds of formula VI more conveniently, we prefer that a compound of formula VII is first esterified under standard conditions to form a compound of formula VIIIA,<br><br><br>
wherein Ra represents lower alkyl (e.g. C1-6, such as linear or branched C1-4, alkyl (e.g. methyl, ethyl or n- or j-propyl)) and R3 and R4 are as hereinbefore defined, followed by reduction of the ester using techniques known to those 5 skilled in the art (e.g. catalytic hydrogenation or, more preferably, chemical reduction). Appropriate chemical reducing agents include, for example, Red-AlÂ®, DIBAL-H or L1AIH4. When the reducing agent is, for example, Red-AlÂ®, the reduction may be carried out in the presence of a suitable organic solvent (for example: an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. toluene or 10 xylene); chlorobenzene; an aliphatic hydrocarbon (e.g. pentane, hexane or petroleum ether); THF; diisopropyl ether; or dichloromethane), under a positive pressure of inert gas (e.g. nitrogen or argon), for example at or around room temperature.<br>
15     (c) Compounds of formula HI in which A represents N may be prepared by reduction of a corresponding compound of formula "VTEB,<br><br><br>
wherein Ra, R3 and R4 are as hereinbefore defined, in the presence of a suitable reducing agent, for example, Red-AlÂ® or DIBAL-H. When the reducing agent is DIBAL-H, this reduction may be performed, for example, 5 at low temperature (e.g. at -78Â°C) in the presence of an appropriate solvent (for example: an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. toluene or xylene); chlorobenzene; an aliphatic hydrocarbon (e.g. pentane, hexane or petroleum ether); THF; diisopropyl ether; or dichloromethane).<br>
10     Preferred compounds of formula III include those in which A represents N.<br>
Compounds of formula VIIIB may be prepared in accordance with the methods detailed in the preparation section herein and by known techniques. For example, compounds of formula VIIIB may be prepared according to or 15 by analogy with the procedures described in WO 99/54333 (in particular the procedures described in Preparations 18 and 19 of that document), the disclosures in which document are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Compounds of formulae IV and V, and derivatives thereof, when not 20     commercially available or not subsequently described, may be obtained by<br><br>
conventional synthetic procedures or by analogy with the processes described herein, in accordance with standard techniques, from readily available starting materials using appropriate reagents and reaction conditions.<br>
5<br>
Compounds may be isolated from reaction mixtures using known techniques.<br>
Substituents on the aryl (e.g. phenyl), and (if appropriate) heterocyclic, 10 group(s) in compounds defined herein may be converted to other substituents using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. For example, amino may be converted to amido, amido may be hydrolysed to amino, hydroxy may be converted to alkoxy, alkoxy may be hydrolysed to hydroxy etc.<br>
15 It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, in the processes described above, the functional groups of intermediate compounds may be, or may need to be, protected by protecting groups.<br>
Functional groups which it is desirable to protect thus include hydroxy, amino 20 and carboxyiic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include nialkylsilyl and diarylalkylsilyl groups (e.g. rert-butyldimethylsilyl, tert-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl and alkylcarbonyl groups (e.g. methyl- and ethylcarbonyl groups). Suitable protecting groups for amino include benzyl, rert-butyloxycarbonyl, 9-25 fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl. Suitable protecting groups for carboxyiic acid include C1-6 alkyl, allyl or benzyl esters.<br><br><br>
The protection and deprotection of functional groups ma.y take place before or after any of the reaction steps described hereinbefore.<br>
Protecting groups may be removed in accordance with techniques which are 5     well known to those skilled in the art and as described hereinafter.<br>

Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that, in order to obtain compounds of formulae IT, HA or DB in an alternative, and, on some occasions, more convenient, manner, the individual process steps, mentioned herein may be<br>
15 performed in a different order, and/or the individual reactions may be performed at a different stage in the overall route, (i.e... substituents may be iadded to â–  and/or chemical transformations performed, upon, different intermediates, to .those, associated hereinbefore with a particular reaction). This will depend inter alia on factors such as the nature of other functional<br>
20 groups present in a particular substrate, the avaHability of key intermediates and the protecting group strategy (if any) to be adopted. Clearly, the type of chemistry involved will influence the choice of reagent that is used in the said synthetic, steps, the need, and type, of ^protecting groups that .are employed, and the sequence for accomplishing the synthesis.<br>
25<br>
Certain .intermediates that are employed in. the processes described herein are .novel. According to the invention there is further provided compounds .of formulae HA, IT8, HI,. VI and VTUA as defined hereinbefore,<br><br><br>
The process of the invention possesses the advantage that sildenafil and<br>
analogues thereof may be prepared from commercially-available starting<br>
materials in fewer steps than in processes described in the prior art, without<br>
5     concomitant losses in terms of yield of key intermediates and of final<br>
compounds.   The process of the invention has the further advantage that<br>
sildenafil and analogues thereof may be made directly from readily available<br>
intermediates   described herein  (i.e. .compounds  of formula HI)  in  a<br>
convenient one-pot procedure.<br>
10<br>
Further, the process of the invention may .have the advantage that sildenafil and analogues thereof may be prepared in less.time, more conveniently, and at a lower cost, than when prepared in processes described in the prior.art.<br>
