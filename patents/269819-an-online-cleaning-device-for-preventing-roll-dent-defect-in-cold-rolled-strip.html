				<td>FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention relates generally to an online roll cleaning device for<br>
preventing roll dent defect in cold rolled strip. In particular it relates to cleaning<br>
of top and bottom rolls of a burr masher unit to prevent dents along the length<br>
of the rolled strip due to entrapment of strip-borne particles and metallic fines.<br>
It also relates to cleaning of tension leveller de-curve rolls for correction of shape<br>
of cold rolled strips.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A burr masher unit is used for removing burr from the edge of the strip after<br>
trimming. The problem is of dent from the top and bottom rolls of the burr<br>
masher unit due to entrapment of strip-borne particles and metallic fines<br>
resulting in breakdown loss like frequent line stoppage for roll cleaning and poor<br>
quality with dents along the length of the strip.<br><br>
At the recoiling and inspection lines in cold rolling mills there can be frequent<br>
production stoppage of cold rolled material due to the problem of dent appearing<br>
from de-curve roll of the tension leveller unit for correcting the shape of input<br>
strip due to entrapment of strip borne particles and metallic fines. This results in<br>
breakdown loss like frequent line stoppages for roll cleaning and poor quality of<br>
strips with dents.<br>
The frequency and intensity of the dents are in proportion to the processing<br>
speed and age of previous processing lines like skin pass mill (SPM), batch<br>
annealing furnace (BAF), electrolytic cleaning line (ECL) and pickling tandem cold<br>
rolling mill (PLTCM).<br>
In order to overcome the problem use of custom made doctoring system was<br>
considered to fit the application at recoiling and inspection lines. However, for<br>
installing this a lead-time of a minimum of one month would be required. This<br>
would mean stoppage of the cold rolling mill. The cost of such a system is also<br>
prohibitively high. Further no manufacturer of doctor blades will be prepared to<br>
give any guarantee for 100 % eradication of dents in the strips.<br><br>
There was therefore, a need for providing a cleaning system for the trimmer burr<br>
masher unit and for the tension leveller unit to eliminate formation of dents due<br>
to entrapment of strip-borne particles and metallic fines.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention therefore is to provide an online roll<br>
cleaning device for the rotating rolls for continuous cleaning to produce dent free<br>
strips.<br>
This and other objects of the present invention are achieved by providing a<br>
cleaning device with a wiper pad and an abrasive structured strip covered by a<br>
specially designed Lint Free cloth.<br>
For continuous cleaning of rotating rolls, the cleaning device can be pressed onto<br>
the rolls using a suitable arrangement. Such an effective cleaning mechanism at<br>
the tension leveller unit and the burr masher unit is capable of solving over 90 %<br>
of the dent problem in the strips.<br><br>
For cleaning de-curved rolls a pivoted lever and a counter weight arrangement<br>
can be used for keeping the device pressed onto the rolls.<br>
In a burr masher until the top and bottom burr masher rolls are each provided<br>
with one roll cleaning device pressed onto the burr masher rolls.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the present invention provides an online roll cleaning<br>
device for preventing roll dent defect in cold rolled strip, characterized by a<br>
metallic frame carrying the device, said device comprising a wiper pad for<br>
applying pressure to maximize the area of contact between the cleaning device<br>
and the roll; an abrasive structured strip for giving necessary softness and<br>
scrubbing action of particles from the roll surface; and a special cloth covering<br>
for said wiper pad and said abrasive structured strip for wiping out metallic fines<br>
and non-metallic particles from the roll surface without creating any scratch mark<br>
thereon.<br><br>
