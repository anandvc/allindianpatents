Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a vertical take-off and landing personal flight device, i.e. a device which can be secured to the pilot rather like a jet belt, and which gives the pilot controllable powered flight.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Personal flight devices were developed in the 1960s and 1970s, but were essentially rocket based devices Qet belts) which gave extremely short flight times (typically about 26 seconds) and were difficult to control. Further, these devices were fuelled by rocket fuel which is intrinsically dangerous.<br>
In a related type of device fuel is fed to a catalyst bed to produce hot gas which is distributed between two spaced counter-rotating turbines to generate vertical thrust from the turbine exhausts. The device is steered by shrouds or deflector rings pivoted to the base of each turbine.<br>
More recently, a number of personal flight devices have been proposed which use ducted fans as their means of propulsion:- for example a device which includes a pair of ducted fans and which is steered by tilting the ducted fans relative to the pilot.<br>
A broadly similar type of design has been proposed, using shrouded propellers rather than ducted fans.<br>
As the terms are used in this specification, the distinction between a 'shrouded propeller' and a 'ducted fan' essentially is that a ducted fan comprises one or more rotating aerofoils or fans (single or multi-bladed) mounted completely within a duct; the duct increases the overall efficiency of the fan. A shrouded propeller comprises a rotating aerofoil or propeller which is surrounded by a shroud, the only function of the shroud being to protect the propeller - the shroud does not appreciably affect the efficiency of the propeller.<br>
A further proposal describes a device which includes a pair of ducted fans. In this device, the fans are rigidly secured to the supporting harness, and steering is achieved by control flaps mounted adjacent to the outlet of each fan. However, in this design the two fans are<br><br>
contra-rotating ano mus nave TO D8 GHVCM via a y^ait^A ^my d n-(duvctj ^nipiuA i^&gt;u transmission system; this adds considerable weight to the device.<br>
Other prior art proposals have been for single shrouded propellers or ducted fans. Single propeller/fan devices have the drawback that the propeller/fan has to be extremely large to provide adequate lift, and to balance the devices the pilot generally has the propeller/fan above or below him, which is far from ideal from a safety point of view. A further drawback is that the thrust from a single propeller/fan has to be split in some way to give steering and this tends to result in high frictional losses in the steering tubes or ducts.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is a personal flight device which overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art devices described above, and which provides a lightweight yet powerful personal flight device which is comparatively safe to use.<br>
The present invention provides a personal flight device which includes:-<br>
a housing which is securable to a pilot;<br>
at least one pair of fans, one fan of the pair mounted to one side of the housing, and the other fan of the pair mounted to the other side of the housing; wherein each fan rotates about an axis of rotation, wherein the axis of rotation of each fan is fixed relative to the housing; and<br>
at least one engine mounted on the housing for driving the fans, wherein both fans rotate in the same direction for producing thrust<br>
It is envisaged that the device probably would use only a single engine and a single pair of fans, since it is important for most applications to keep the overall weight of the device as low as possible. However, it would be possible to use more than one pair of fans, each pair driven by its own engine or both/all pairs driven by a single engine. Preferably, each fan would be a ducted fan, but rt would be possible to use a non-ducted fan.<br>
Preferably, the housing is securable to a pilot by means of a harness, and includes protective shielding between the pilot and the engine and fans.<br>
The engine may be any suitable reliable, robust, lightweight engine e.g. a two-stroke or a four-stroke internal combustion engine, rotary engine, or a gas turbine.<br><br>
"he drive means may be any reliable lightweight drive means e.g. a chain drive, a fluid irive or a belt drive. Preferably, the drive means is a flexible belt drive, most preferably a oothed belt drive or a micro-V belt drive. A belt drive is preferred because a belt drive nay easily be inspected by a pilot to check for wear or damage, and modern belt drives give a low-weight high-efficiency drive. For additional security, two or more drive means nay be used in parallel.<br>
Preferably, the device also includes steering means, which may be any suitable means, e.g. a steering vane on one or more fans; a moveable steering shroud around the lower end of one or more fans; or steering jets. Preferably, the steering means comprises a steering vane on each fan, arranged to direct the airflow leaving the fan in use, and controllable by the pilot.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Referring to the drawings, a personal flight device 1 includes a pair of ducted fans 2,3 which are supported and spaced apart by a central housing 4, which also supports an engine 6 and a fuel tank (not visible).<br><br><br><br>
The fans 7,8 are driven from the engine 6 by a drive means in the form of a pair of toothed drive belts 11a,11b to the corresponding hub 7a,8a. The toothed belt drive is shown (diagrammatically) in Fig.s 4 and 6. As shown in Fig. 6, the engine 6 drives a drive pulley 6a through a flexible coupling 6b, to dampen torsional vibration from the engine 6. Two drive belts 11 a,11 b are engaged with the drive pulley 6a, one belt alongside the other.<br>
The first drive belt 11a passes around the pulley 6a, through an aperture 9b in the duct 9 and around the hub 7a to drive the fan 7. The second drive belt 11b passes around the pulley 6a, through an aperture 10b in the duct 10, and around the hub 8a to drive the fan 8. In use, both fans 7,8 are rotated in the same direction, but the airflow from the bottom 9a, 10a, of each duct 9,10 is made linear (i.e. substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the corresponding fan) by the use of a row of stators 12. The stators 12 are spaced, and extend radially around the inner circumference of each duct 9,10 below the corresponding fan 7,8. Each stator 12 is a 'spoke' which extends radially from the inner wall of the duct towards the hub.<br>
Fig. 8a shows the simplest arrangement of stators, in which each stator is a flat parallel-sided plate, with the length of each plate extending radially from the inner wall of the duct towards the hub.<br>
Fig.s 8b,9 and 10 illustrate a more aerodynamically efficient design of stator 12b, in which each stator 12b is a curved aerofoil cross-section plate, one end of which is secured to the inner wall of the duct and the other end of which is secured to the hub. As shown in Fig.s 9 and 10, each stator 12b twists along its longitudinal axis from the hub to the duct. Stators of this design have a higher efficiency than the simple flat stators 12a, but are more expensive to produce and to fit.<br>
The housing 4 is slightly wider than the shoulder width of the pilot, and approximately the same height as the pilot. In the "at rest" position shown in Fig.s 1 and 3 of the drawings, »     the lower edge 5 of the housing 4 rests on the ground and is stabilised by a pair of angled rear supports 21 (Fig. 3 only).<br><br><br>
The control arrangement for the control vanes is a simple lever control:- in the case of fan 2, movement of the control lever 17 in the direction of arrow X moves the control vane in the direction of arrow B, and movement of the lever 17 in the direction of arrow Y moves the control vane in the direction of arrow A. Alternatively, a cable could be used in place of each rod. Another possibility is to use a non-mechanical control system, by substituting an electric actuator for controlling each control vane.<br>
Each control vane is mounted diametrically across the lower edge 9a, 10a, of the corresponding duct 9,10 and is arranged to pivot about an axis substantially perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the corresponding fan and hub. Each vane has an aerofoil cross section. Each vane projects partly below the lower edge of the corresponding duct, as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
In use, the pilot stands in the space 20 (Fig. 2) and is strapped to the device by means of a parachute type a harness (not shown) which is mounted on the housing 4. Once strapped in, the pilot starts the engine 6 to rotate the fans 7,8 within the ducts 9,10 to give vertical lift to the device. The amount of lift is governed by the acceleration of the engine 6, which is controlled by the throttle 16. Forward movement is given by angling the control vanes of the fans 2,3 using the control levers 17,19. The control vanes also are used to turn the device left or right.<br>
Rotating both fans 7,8 in the same direction means that the fans can be driven directly from the engine and there is no need for a gearbox to alter the direction of drive. This saves a great deal of additional weight, and also eliminates a component which would need maintenance and be a possible source of failure. Rotating both fans in the same direction would impart torque to the device were it not for the stators which render the airflow leaving the fans 2,3 substantially linear.<br><br><br>
It is envisaged that the primary use of the above-described device would be a one-person transport. However, it would be possible to substitute any of a range of remote-control devices for the pilot, and to operate the device remotely.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
