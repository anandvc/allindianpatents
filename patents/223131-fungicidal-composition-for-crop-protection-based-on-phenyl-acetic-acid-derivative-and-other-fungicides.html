[lacuna]<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide fungicidal mixtures having good fungicidal activity, in particular against fungal diseases in rice, exceeding the activity of the mixture components on their own.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the mixtures according to claim 1.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are known per se and are described in the literature (WO 97/15552).<br>
The fungicides of the formulae II and III are also known and<br>
described in the literature. Moreover, they are commercially<br>
; available under the trade names given hereinbelow in brackets:<br>
II: EP 341,475, common name: carpropamide (trade name:WIN®, from Bayer)<br>
III:CAS RN 139 920-32-4, proposed common name: dichlocymet (development product of Sumitomo)<br>
The compounds V, and also processes for their preparation, are described in WO 97/35838.<br>
The compounds IV and processes for their preparation are explained in a more detailed manner below; the corresponding compounds are described in the older patent application PCT/EP 98/01031 or DE 19710618.8.<br>
Owing to their C=C and C=N double bonds, the preparation of the compounds I may yield E/Z isomer mixtures which can be separated into the individual compounds in a customary manner, for example by crystallization or chromatography.<br>
However, if the synthesis yields isomer mixtures, a separation is generally not necessarily required since in some cases the individual isomers can be converted into one another during the preparation for use or upon use (for example under the action of light, acids or bases). Similar conversions may also occur after the use, for example in the treatment of plants in the treated plant or in the harmful fungus or animal pest to be controlled.<br><br>
with regard to the C=X double bond, preference is given to the cis isomers of the compounds I (configuration based on the -OCH3 or the -CH3 group in relation to the -C02R2 group) with respect to their activity.<br><br>
with regard to the "C(R3)=NOCH2- double bond, preference is given to the cis isomers of the compounds I (configuration based on the radical R2 in relation to the -OCH2- group) with respect to their activity.<br>
With respect to their biological activity, preference is given to compounds of the formula I in which m is 0.<br>
Likewise, preference is given to compounds of formula I in which R2 is methyl.<br>
Besides, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is hydrogen, cyano, cyclopropyl, methyl, ethyl, 1-methylethyl or CF3.<br>
Moreover, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is methyl.<br>
Besides, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is cyano.<br>

Moreover, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is methyl.<br>
Additionally, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is ethyl.<br>
Moreover, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is isopropyl.<br><br>
Moreover, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is cyclopropyl.<br>
Moreover, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is CF3.<br>
Additionally, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is unsubstituted or substituted aryl or hetaryl.<br>
Additionally, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is unsubstituted or substituted pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl or triazinyl.<br>
Additionally, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is unsubstituted or substituted furyl, thienyl or pyrrolyl.<br>
Additionally, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is unsubstituted or substituted oxazolyl, thiazolyl, isoxazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyrazolyl or imidazolyl.<br>

Moreover, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyl, C2-C6-alkenyl, C2-C6-alkynyl, allyl, arylalkyl, hetarylalkyl, aryloxyalkyl, hetaryloxyalkyl, aryl or hetaryl.<br>
Additionally, preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is C1-C6-alkyl.<br>
Further preferred compounds I are disclosed in WO 97/15,552.<br>
With respect to the fungicidal activity against harmful fungi, such as, for example, Pyricularia oryzae,  preference is given to the cycloalkylalkanecarboxamides IV which have the substituents<br><br>
r<br><br>
below, where the preference in each case can be seen on its own or in combination:<br>
The carbon atom carrying the groups R2 and R10 preferably has the R configuration.<br>
Preference is given to cycloalkylalkanecarboxamides IV in which R2 is methyl and R10 is either methyl or hydrogen; particular preference is given to compounds IV in which R2 is methyl and Ri° is hydrogen.<br>
Furthermore, preference is given to cycloalkylalkanecarboxamides of the formula IV in which W is unsubstituted or substituted phenyl which is in particular substituted in the 2-position or in positions 2 and 4. Very particular preference is given to substitution in the 4-position of the phenyl ring and here preferably to substitution by cyano or methoxy, preferably by methyl and in particular by halogen, where in this case preference is in turn given to chlorine.<br>
Additionally, preference is given to cycloalkylalkanecarboxamides IV where n = 1. The substituents R2 and R** are preferably C1-C4-alkyl and in particular methyl. Preference is also given to the combination in which one of the two substituents is hydrogen and the other is C1-C4-alkyl and in particular methyl.<br>
Furthermore, preference is given to a-chloro or<br>
a-bromocycloalkylalkanecarboxamides IV (Y = bromine or chlorine). Particular preference is given to a-cyanocycloalkylalkanecarboxamides IV (Y = cyano).<br>
Finally, preference is given to cycloalkylalkanecarboxamides of the formula IV in which A is unsubstituted or substituted cyclopropyl. Particular preference is given to cyclopropyl carrying one to three substituents selected from the group consisting of chlorine and C1-C3-alkyl, in particular methyl. Chlorinated cyclopropyl preferably carries two chlorine atoms, these being in a geminal  position at the cyclopropane ring. Alkylated or preferably methylated cyclopropyl preferably carries one of the alkyl(methyl) substituents at the carbon atom of the site where the cyclopropane ring is linked to the remainder of the molecule.<br><br>
with respect to their use, particular preference is given to the compounds I which are compiled in the Tables 1 to 13 below.<br>

Furthermore1 we have found processes by which the carboxamides IV can be prepared in good yields.<br>
In a preferred process, the carboxamides IV<br><br>
are obtained by reacting the carboxylic acid derivatives VI,<br><br>
with cunines of the formula VII<br><br>
The amide formation is carried out according to the processes known from the literature. The free carboxylic acids of the formula VI' where Z is hydroxyl are generally first converted into an activated carboxylic acid derivative VI where Z is, for example, chlorine.<br>
The activation of the carboxylic acids VI' can preferably also be carried out in situ by using the carboxylic acids VI' directly with addition of, for example, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, ethyl chloroformate, diethyl cyanophosphonate, triphenylphosphine/ azodicarboxylic ester, 2-pyridine disulfide/triphenylphosphine,<br><br>
carbonyldiimidazole, thionyl chloride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, etc. In general, for example the carbodiimides are added in equimolar amounts, based on the carboxylic acids VI'.<br>
Activation of the carboxylic acids via acyl cyanides is carried out, for example, by reacting the carboxylic acids VI' with diethyl cyanophosphonate, preferably in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, toluene or dichloromethane (cf. Tetrahedron Lett, li (1973), 1595-8) .<br>
Activation via anhydrides is carried out, for example, by reacting the carboxylic acids VI' with chloroformates such as ethyl chloroformate, generally in the presence of bases and, if appropriate, in an inert solvent, such as toluene or tetrahydrofuran (cf. "Houben-Weyl", 4th Ed. (1974), 15/1, pages 28-32).<br>
The amide formation is preferably carried out in the presence of bases, such as tertiary amines, for example triethylamine or dimethylcyclohexylamine, alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydroxides, pyridine, etc. The starting materials and the auxiliary base are advantageously employed in equimolar amounts. In certain cases, a slight excess of auxiliary base of from 0.1 - 0.5 equivalents may be advantageous.<br>
Suitable solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane and ligroin, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride and 1,2-dichloroethane, ethers such as methyl tert-butyl ether and tetrahydrofuran, polar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile and dimethylformcimide or esters such as ethyl acetate, or mixtures of these.<br>
The molar ratio of carboxylic acid derivative VI to eimine VII is generally from 0.8 to 1.5 and preferably from 0.9 to 1.1.<br>
After the reaction has gone to completion, work-up is carried out as usual, for example by introducing the reaction mixture into water, followed by extraction of the eimide.<br>
The amines of the formula VII are known or can be easily obtained (cf. Organikum (1993) Barth Verlagsgesellschaft mbH Leipzig, p. 509 ff.; Indian J. Chem. 10 (19721 366K<br><br>
The preparation of a-cyanocyclopropane acetic acid is described in Org. Prep. Proced. Int. 5. (1973), 25-29. Scheme 1 shows a general route for constructing carboxylic acids of the formula VI' (cf. Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. M (1983), 1597-1601 and J. Polym. Sci., Polym. Chem. Ed. 11 (1976), 2357-9).<br><br>
Carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula VIA can furthermore be prepared in accordance with Scheme 2.<br><br><br><br>
The cycloalkylacetic acids of the formula VIII where A is as defined in claim 1 are known (J. Chem. Technol. Biotechnol., Chem. Technol., 13A (1983), 109-15; NL 65 06 881; Chem. Ber. H (1908), 2627; Chem. Ber. 15 (1902), 2688).<br>
The cycloalkylacetic acids VIII can be brominated in the a position in accordance with the protocol in J. Am. Chem. Soc 20. ' (1948), 3626. Work-up in the presence of a C1-C6-alcohol leads directly to the corresponding ester. The subsequent bromine/cyano exchange is carried out as described in Synth. Commun. 21 (1993), 2323-9. The hydrolysis of the esters to give the carboxylic acids VIAA' is carried out by standard procedures (Organikum 1993 Earth Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Leipzig, p. 431ff.).<br>
The carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula VIB can be obtained, for example, by the route shown in Scheme 3.<br><br><br>
The starting materials, acyl- or formylcycloalkanes of the formula IX, are generally accessible (cf. inter alia J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. I, 6. (1994), 739 -52). These are reacted in a Knoevenagel reaction with C1-C6-alkyl a-halo- or a-cyanoacetates to give the Michael systems X (cf. Chem. Heterocycl. Compd, 2A (1988), 860-4).<br>
The condensation is generally carried out in a solvent that is immiscible with water, such as hexane, toluene or xylene, with removal of the water that is formed during the reaction. To this end, the reaction mixture is heated at the boil and under reflux for several hours.<br>
Bases, such as, for example, piperidine, pyridine, ammonia or P-alanine, in the presence of an acid, such as, for example, glacial acetic acid, serve as catalysts.<br>
An alkyl Grignard reagent of the formula XI where R2 is as defined in claim 1 and Hal is chlorine, bromine or iodine is subsequently added to a Michael system of the formula X to give saturated systems of the type VIB.<br>
The reaction is carried out in solvents which are inert under the reaction conditions. Particular preference is given to ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dimethoxyethane or methyl tert-butyl ether. The reaction temperature is generally set to from -10 to 80°C and preferably to from 10 to 60*'C.<br><br>
The Grignard reagent XI is generally employed in equimolar amounts, based on the Michael system X. In some cases, it proves advantageous to employ an excess of from 0.2 to 0.5 molar equivalents of the Grignard reagent.<br>
In general, the addition is carried out, catalyzed by copper, by addition of 1 - 10 mol% of, for example, copper(I) iodide. This results in a higher selectivity for 1,2-addition versus 1,4-addition.<br>
The free carboxylic acids VIB' are finally prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of the corresponding esters (Organikum 1993 Barth Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Leipzig, p. 431ff.).<br>
An elegant route to<br>
2-cyano-3-(2,2-dichlorocyclopropyl)-3-methylbutanoic acid is shown in Scheme 4.<br><br>
The preparation of 2-cyano-3,3-dimethylpent-4-enoic acid from the 3-methylbut-2-enyl ester of cyanoacetic acid is described in DE 26 49 711 and Res. Disci. 241 (1985), 55. By addition of dichlorocarbene, which is obtainable from chloroform and alkali metal hydroxides by standard methods, 2"Cyano-3-(2,2-dichloro-cyclopropyl)-3-methylbutanoic acid can be obtained directly. To increase the yield it is advantageous to protect the carboxylic acid function prior to the cyclopropanation step (for example by conversion into the tert-butyl ester).<br><br>
By the abovementioned processes, carboxylic acid derivatives VI are obtainable which are suitable, for example, for preparing the carboxamides IV according to the invention.<br>
The particularly preferred embodiments of the carboxylic acid derivatives VI with respect to the substituents R21, R21, A and Y correspond to those of the carboxamides IV.<br>
Z is a nucleophilically replaceable radical, such as hydroxyl, C1-C4-alkoxy, halogen, for example bromine or chlorine, hetaryl, for example imidazolyl or pyridyl, carboxylate, for example acetate or trifluoroacetate, etc.<br>
Particular preference is given to carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula VI in which n is 1 and/or A is unsubstituted or substituted cyclopropyl. In the case that n is 0, preference is given to carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula VIA in which A is cyclopropyl which may carry one to three substituents, such I as, for example, chlorine and/or Ci-C3-alkyl. Chlorinated cyclopropyl preferably carries two chlorine atoms in a geminal position at the cyclopropane ring.<br>
The compounds V can be prepared starting from the corresponding carboxylic acids Xlla<br><br>
by reaction with amines XIII (the literature references "Houben-Weyl" are based on : Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, 4th Edition, Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart).<br>
The carboxylic acids Xlla are known from EP-A 653 418.<br>
The amines XIII are also generally known or obtainable by known methods (cf. WO-A 95/23 784).<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out by initially converting the carboxylic acids Xlla into carboxyl-activated derivatives XII, especially into acyl halides - for example the chlorides -, acyl cyanides or anhydrides (cf- Tetrahedron Letters, Volume 18, page 1595 to page 1598 (1973) or "Houben-Weyl", Volume 15/1, page<br><br><br>
28 to page 32). These derivatives XII are then reacted with the amines XIII in the presence of bases.<br>
Suitable for preparing the acyl cyanides is1 for example, the reaction of the carboxylic acids Xlla with diethyl cyanophosphonate, especially in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, toluene or dichloromethane.<br>
To prepare the carboxyl-activated anhydrides, preference is given to reacting the carboxylic acids Xlla with chloroformates such as isobutyl chloroformate in the presence of bases and, if appropriate, in an inert solvent such as toluene or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The reaction of the cimines XIII with the carboxyl-activated carboxylic acids III [sic] is preferably carried out in a solvent such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran or toluene.<br>
The amines XIII themselves may also act as the bases, and they are usually recovered from the crude product.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this process step, the carboxylic acid XII [sic], the amine XIII, the reagent suitable for preparing the carboxyl-activated derivative of the carbamoylcarboxylic acid XII and the base are reacted in a one-pot process, if appropriate in an inert solvent.<br>
The reaction mixture obtained in this manner is worlced-up in a customary manner to give the compounds V, for excunple by mixing with water, separation of the phases and, if appropriate, chromatographic purification of the crude products. Some of the end products are obtained in the form of colorless or slightly brownish, viscous oils, which can be freed of volatile components under reduced pressure and at moderately elevated temperature. If the end products are obtained as solids, purification can also be carried out, for example, by recrystallization or digestion.<br>
Depending on the nature of the substituents, the compounds of the formula V may be present as geometrical and/or optical isomers or isomer mixtures. In particular, the carbon atom in the compounds V which carries the groups R2 and R2 may have R or S configuration according to lUPAC nomenclature. Both the pure isomers described here and the mixtures of the isomers have fungicidal activity.<br><br>
In the compounds V, with respect to the radical R21, the remaining part pf the molecule may be arranged exo or endo. Both isomers and their mixtures are in each case fungicidally active.<br>
With respect to their biological action against harmful fungi, preference is given to compounds V in which the carbon atom carrying groups R21 and R21 has R configuration.<br>
Moreover, preference is given to compounds V in which R21 ig hydrogen and R21 is C1-C4-alkyl, especially methyl.<br>
Furthermore, preference is given to compounds V in which Ar is optionally substituted phenyl which is substituted in particular in the 2-position or in the 2- and 4-position and especially in the 4-position. Preferred sole substituents in the 4-position are cyano, preferably methyl and in particular halogen, especially chlorine.<br>
Additionally, preference is given to compounds V in which R21 is unsubstituted or substituted bicycloalkyl having 6 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
Moreover, preference is given to compounds V in which R21 is unsubstituted or substituted bicycloalkenyl having 7 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
Particular preference with respect to their use is given to the compounds compiled in Tables 1 to 29 of WO-A 97/35838.<br>

Correspondingly, in the case of the compounds II to V, the application rates are from 0.001 to 5 kg/ha, preferably from ' 0.005 to 2 kg/ha, in particular from 0.01 to 1.0 kg/ha.<br>
For seed treatment, the application rates of the mixture are generally from 0.001 to 250 g/kg of seed, preferably 0.01 to 100 g/kg, in particular 0.01 to 50 g/kg.<br>
If phytopathogenic harmful fungi are to be controlled, the separate or joint application of the compounds I and at least one of the compounds II to V is effected by spraying or dusting the seeds, the plants or the soils before or after sowing the plants, or before or after plant emergence.<br>
The fungicidal synergistic mixtures according to the invention can be formulated for example in the form of ready-to-spray solutions, powders and suspensions or in the form of highly concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for broadcasting or granules, and applied by spraying, atomizing, dusting, broadcasting or watering. The use form depends on the intended purpose; in any case, it should ensure as fine and<br><br>
uniform as possible a distribution of the mixture according to the invention.<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, for example by * expanding the active ingredient with solvents and/or carriers, if desired by use of emulsifiers and dispersants.

Powders, materials for broadcasting and dusts can be prepared by mixing or jointly grinding the compounds I and at least one of the compounds II to V or the mixture of the compounds I and at least one of the compounds II to V with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules (eg. coated granules, impregnated granules or homogeneous granules) are usually prepared by binding the active ingredient, or active ingredients, to a solid carrier.<br><br>
Fillers or solid carriers are, for example, mineral earths, such as silica gel, silicic acids, silica gels [sic], silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium 1oxide, ground synthetic materials, and fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers.<br>
The formulations generally comprise 0.1 to 95% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 90% by weight, of one of the compounds I and at least one of the compounds II to V or of the mixture of the compounds I and at least one of the compounds II to V. The active ingredients are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR or HPLC spectrum [sic].<br>

Evaluation is carried out by determining the infected leaf areas in percent. These percentages are converted into efficacies. The efficacy (W) is calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br><br>
W == (1 - a)-100/p<br>
a  corresponds to the fungal infection of the treated plants in % and<br>
P  corresponds to the fungal infection of the untreated (control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were not infected.<br>
The expected efficacies of the mixtures of the active ingredients were determined using Colby's formula [R.S. Colby, Weeds 15., 20-22 (1967)] and compared with the observed efficacies.<br>

Use Example 1 - Activity against Pyricularia oryzae (protective)<br>
Leaves of potted rice seedlings c.v. "Tai-Nong 67" were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous preparation of active ingredient prepared using a stock solution comprising 10% of active ingredient, 63% of cyclohexanone and 27% of emulsifier. The following day, the plants were inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of Pyricularia oryzae. The test plants were subsequently placed in climatized chambers at 22-2410 and 95-99% relative atmospheric humidity for 6 days. The extent of the development of the disease on the leaves was then determined visually.<br>
The visually determined values for the percentage of diseased leaf areas were converted into efficacies as percent of the untreated control. An efficacy of 0 is the same disease level as in the untreated control, an efficacy of 100 is 0% disease. The expected efficacies for the active ingredient combinations were determined using Colby's formula (Colby, S. R. (Calculating<br><br>
synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations". Weeds, 15, pp. 20-22, 1967) and compared with the observed efficacies.<br>
