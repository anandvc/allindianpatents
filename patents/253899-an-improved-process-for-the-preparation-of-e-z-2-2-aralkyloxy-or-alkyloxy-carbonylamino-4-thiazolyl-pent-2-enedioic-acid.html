Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of thiazolyl derivative used as an intermediate in the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotic. More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Ceftibuten intermediate of the formula (I).<br><br>
I wherein R is amino protecting group.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,634,697 describes cephalosporin compounds including Ceftibuten, a commercially important third generation cephalosporin type antibiotic of formula (VII). <br>
The synthesis of Ceftibuten starting from penicillin G is described in Yoshioka, Pure Appl. Chem., 59, 1041 (1987). However, this process is costly and inefficient leaving a current need for a more cost effective and efficient process for the commercial scale preparation of ceftibuten.<br>
The electrochemical transformation of derivatives of cephalosporin C is reported in Jones, et al., J. Pharm. Pharmac, 20, (Suppl.) 45S-47S (1968), and<br><br>
Hall, J. Pharm. Sci., 62, (6) 980-983 (1973). The formation of 3-exomethylene cephalosporins via eletrochemical reduction is described in Ochiai, et al., J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. I, 258-262 (1974) and U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,792,995 and 4,042,472. Baldwin, et al., Tetrahedron, 49, (22) 4907-4922 (1993), also describes the electrochemical reduction of cephalosporin C to form a 3-exomethylene compound. The electrochemical processes described above are chemically inefficient, providing low yields.<br>
According to the literature evidence, in the process of preparation of Ceftibuten, two key intermediates are widely employed namely 7[3-aminocephem-4-carboxylic acid or its salts or esters and (E,Z)-2-{2-[[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]amino]-4-thiazolyl} -pent-2-enedioic acid.<br>
In view of the vital antibiotic activities of Ceftibuten or its derivatives of the formula (VII), various methods of preparation were reported that utilize the compound of formula (I).<br>
Many processes are known in the literature for the preparation of compound of formula (I). US 4,652,652 discloses the preparation of compound of formula I.<br><br><br><br>
The aforementioned prior art involves drawbacks like more number of steps including protection and deprotection of esters, usage of alkoxyacrylic acid or its derivatives, which are hazardous and environmentally not safe. The processes involve cumbersome workups and lower yields.<br>
Considering the foregoing limitations, we undertook an investigation in our lab to develop a process, which involves less number of steps and succeeded with a process, which yield the title compound in good quality, quantity and eco-friendly manner.<br>
Objectives of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of (E,Z)-2-{2[[(aralkyloxy or alkyloxy)carbonyl]amino]-4-thiazolyl}-pent-2-enedioic acid (DIACID) of formula<br>
(I).<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a commercially viable process for the preparation of DIACID or its derivatives of formula (I), which would be easy to implement on manufacturing scale.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to obviate usage of toxic and hazardous chemicals like acrylaldehyde, alkoxyacrylicacid or its derivatives.<br>
