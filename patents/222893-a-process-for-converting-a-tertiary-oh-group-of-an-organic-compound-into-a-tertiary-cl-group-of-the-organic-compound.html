				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for converting a tertiary OH group of an<br>
organic compound into a tertiary Cl group of the organic compound.<br>
In particular the invention relates to a process for producing a compound of general<br>
formula (I) <br>
and, more precisely, in the form of its racemates. its pure stereoisomers. in particular<br>
enantiomers or diastereomers. or in the form of mixtures of stereoisomers. in<br>
particular the enantiomers or diastereomers. in any mixing ratio; in the illustrated<br>
form or in the form of its salts, in particular the physiologically acceptable salts,<br>
particularly preferably in the form of the hydrochloride, or in the form of its<br>
solvates. in particular the hydrates.<br>
As is known EP 0 753 506 Al, the compound of formula (I) has an analgesic effect<br>
and is also used as an intermediate product to produce further analgesic substances.<br>
EP 0 753 506 Al discloses a process for producing the compound of formula (I)<br>
starting from a compound of general formula (II).<br><br>
the production of which is known from the literature (K. Flick et al., Arzneim.-<br>
Forsch./Drug Res. 28 (1), issue la (1978)), wherein, to convert the tertiary alcohol<br>
function on the cyclohexyl radical into a C-substitution with retention on the carbon<br>
atom marked by *. thionyl chloride is used as the chlorination reagent and as the<br>
solvent. This process therefore requires large quantities of thionyl chloride. The<br>
subsequent working up while expelling the excess thionyl chloride with a stream of<br>
nitrogen gas or by distillation is stressful for humans, the environment and operating<br>
equipment. Furthermore, only poor yields (maximum of 55% of theoretical) are<br>
achieved.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a process with which an organic<br>
compound comprising a tertiary OH group, in particular a compound of formula (II).<br>
is converted into a corresponding organic compound comprising a tertiary Cl group,<br>
in particular into a compound of formula (I), in a high yield. It is also desirable to<br>
reduce the quantity of chlorinating agent to be used, compared to the process known<br>
from the literature, using this process.<br>
The object is achieved by a process for converting a tertiary OH group of an organic<br>
compound into a tertiary Cl group of the organic compound, characterised in that the<br>
tertiary alcohol is suspended or dissolved in a solvent, selected from the group<br>
comprising toluene, o-xylene. m-xylene, p-xylene and mixtures thereof, thionyl<br>
chloride being added to the resultant suspension or solution and then the resultant<br>
organic compound comprising the tertiary Cl group is separated from the further<br>
reaction components.<br>
It is preferred in this case that at least 1 equivalent but not more than 3 equivalents<br>
of thionyl chloride is/are used. The preferred solvent is toluene.<br>
Separation of the resultant organic compound comprising the tertiary Cl group can<br>
be effected in different ways. Thus the organic compound comprising the tertiary Cl<br>
group can be isolated, after the reaction has taken place, by distilling off the further<br>
reaction components with the solvent. Distilling off is also taken to mean the partial<br>
removal of the solvent with the further reaction components by supplying heat under<br>
vacuum. It is also possible, after the reaction has taken place, to obtain the organic<br>
compound comprising the tertiary Cl group as a solid by cooling to below ambient<br>
temperature and to then dry it at temperatures between 35°C and 75°C, preferably<br>
under vacuum. The halogenated organic compound is preferably obtained in the<br>
form of its hydrochloride.<br>
This process according to the invention allows synthesis of organic compounds<br>
comprising a tertiary Cl group, starting from the corresponding tertiary alcohol<br>
while retaining the stereochemistry at the stereogenic centre in high yields of more<br>
than 70% and while reducing the quantity of thionyl chloride to be used.<br>
The process according to the invention has proven to be particularly advantageous<br>
for producing a compound of formula (I)<br>
in the form of its racemates, its pure stereoisomers, in particular enantiomers or<br>
diastereomers, or in the form of mixtures of stereoisomers, in particular the<br>
enantiomers or diastereomers. in any mixing ratio; in the illustrated form or in the<br>
form of its salts, in particular physiologically acceptable salts, particularly preferably<br>
in the form of the hydrochloride, and/or in the form of its solvates, in particular the<br>
hydrates; wherein the process is characterised in that a compound of formula (II)<br>
in the form of its racemates. its pure stereoisomers. in particular enantiomers or<br>
diastereomers. or in the form of mixtures of stereoisomers. in particular the<br>
enantiomers or diastereomers. in any mixing ratio: in the illustrated form or in the<br>
form of its salts, in particular physiologically acceptable salts, particularly preferably<br>
in the form of the hydrochloride, and/or in the form of its solvates. in particular the<br>
hydrates;<br>
(a) is suspended in a solvent, which is selected from the group comprising<br>
toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene and mixtures thereof;<br>
(b) thionyl chloride is added to the resultant suspension; and<br>
(c) the reaction product comprising the tertiary Cl group of formula (I) is<br>
separated from the further reaction components.<br>
It is advantageous here that the reaction product of formula (1) is separated (c) by<br>
distilling off the solvent with the further reaction components. Distilling off is also<br>
taken to mean the partial removal of the solvent with the further reaction<br>
components by supplying heat under vacuum. Alternatively, separation (c) can take<br>
place by precipitating the reaction product of formula (I) by means of cooling the<br>
reaction mixture to below ambient temperature and then drying the reaction product<br>
at temperatures between 35°C and 75°C, preferably under vacuum.<br>
Toluene is preferred as the solvent or solubiliser. The use of other non-polar solvents<br>
as toluene and/or xylene, for example THF, heptane, hexane and cyclohexane, has<br>
not proven to be advantageous, as the reaction is then carried out with the formation<br>
of numerous by-products, i.e. not sufficiently selectively. It is also preferred that 1 to<br>
2 equivalents, in particular 1.5 to 1.7 equivalents, particularly preferably 1.6<br>
equivalents of thionyl chloride - based on the compound of formula (II) - are used.<br>
This represents a drastic reduction in the quantity of thionyl chloride to be used<br>
compared with the process known from EP 0 753 506 Al. Much higher yields,<br>
which are greater than 70% of the theoretical yield, are also achieved with complete<br>
conversion of the starting compound (II).<br>
The compound (II) is preferably reacted at elevated temperature, in particular at a<br>
temperature of 30 to 50°C. preferably 35 to 45°C. for 1 to 4 hours, preferably 2 to 3<br>
hours, though the reaction time can also be longer or shorter than this.<br>
It has been found that the reaction according to the invention of (II) to (I) in the<br>
presence of catalysts, for example dimethyl formamide. does not result in higher<br>
conversion rates or improved yields; however, these catalysts do not disturb the<br>
course of the reaction either.<br>
The starting compound (II) is generally used in the form of its hydrochloride. It is<br>
suspended in the inert or non-polar solubiliser, toluene, in which it does not dissolve<br>
at either low or high temperature. The addition of the thionyl chloride, which for its<br>
part is relatively non-polar, should not make any difference but during the course of<br>
the reaction it will be seen that the educt (II) dissolves completely. It is also<br>
surprising, and advantageous to process management as a whole, that - in contrast to<br>
what is conventional in reactions with thionyl chloride, such as in the process of EP<br>
0 753 506 A1 known from the literature, no sulphur dioxide gas and no hydrogen<br>
chloride gas develops during heating. It is possible that the educt of formula (II)<br>
and/or the product of formula (I) go into a complex comprising sulphur dioxide and<br>
hydrogen chloride, so the compounds (I) and (II) remain in solution and SO2 and<br>
HC1 are not released as gases. The complexing of amines with SO2 in organic<br>
solvents is known in the literature (see for example J. Grundnes, S. D. Christian. J.<br>
Am. Chem. Soc. (1968) 90. 2239-2245), while the - hypothetical - complexing with<br>
HC1 has not previously been observed.<br>
Irrespective of whether the hypothesis of complexing applies, the surprising<br>
circumstance whereby the reactants of the reaction remain in a homogeneous<br>
solution has proven to be advantageous with respect to yield and reaction. A further<br>
advantage is that it is possible to separate the desired reaction product from the<br>
solubiliser and the further reaction components in that the solubiliser. preferably<br>
toluene, is distilled off. preferably under vacuum: the sulphur dioxide that has<br>
formed and the hydrogen chloride are also removed in the process.<br>
It is also advantageous to achieve separation of the product (I) by cooling the<br>
reaction mixture to a temperature below ambient temperature, preferably to 0 to<br>
10°C. in particular to about 2° bis 4°C. which leads to precipitation of the crude<br>
product. Subsequent treatment in a drying cabinet at elevated temperatures of<br>
preferably 35 to 75°C. in particular 40°C. and preferably under vacuum, in particular<br>
at a pressure of 1 to 300 mbar, preferably 50 to 180 mbar, most particularly<br>
preferably 50 to 150 mbar, yields the pure product, preferably as hydrochloride.<br>
It is particularly preferred to carry out the process according to the invention with<br>
the stereoisomers of compound (II) which have the configuration (IIa) and/or (IIb):<br>
The reaction according to the invention with thionyl chloride leads, as expected with<br>
retention of the stereochemistry at the centre of the reaction, to the corresponding<br>
stereoisomers of compound (I). It is also preferred to use the compound (II) in the<br>
process according to the invention as the enantiomer with the absolute configuration<br>
(IIa). i.e. as (1S,2S)-2-dimethylaminomethyl-l-(3-methoxyphenyl)-cycIohexanol, in<br>
particular as the hydrochloride. (1 S,2S)-[2-chloro-2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-<br>
cyclohexylmethyl]-dimethylamine. in particular in the form of the HC1 salt, is<br>
obtained as the product here.<br>
As known from EP 753 506 Al. the compounds of formula (I) have an analgesic<br>
effect and can be used as intermediate compounds to produce further analgesicalh<br>
active cyclohexyl compounds.<br>
It is therefore also preferred to convert a compound of formula (I), produced by the<br>
process according to the invention by (d) catalytic hydrogenation. into a compound<br>
of formula (III):<br>
Hydrogenation is preferably carried out by heterogeneous catalysis with palladium<br>
on activated carbon, of which the quantity can be varied within a wide range<br>
between 1% through 5% to 10% palladium on activated carbon. Suitable solvents<br>
include alkyl alcohols, in particular methanol and ethanol. The compound (I) is<br>
conventionally used as the hydrochloride.<br>
The hydrogenation step (d) is preferably carried out with retention of the<br>
stereochemistry on the carbon atom marked by an asterisk (*) in formula (I) or (III).<br>
The optionally formed quantity of compound (III) with inverted stereochemistry on<br>
the carbon*atom is so low that it can easily be separated during conventional<br>
working up. This process is therefore eminently suitable, starting from the<br>
enantiomer with the absolute configuration (IIa), via the corresponding enantiomer<br>
of compound (Ia)<br>
for producing the compound (III) as the enantiomer with the absolute configuration<br>
(IIIa)<br>
(The compound (1Kb) mirror-inverted to (IIa) can be correspondingly produced,<br>
starting from the optical antipode (IIb) via (Ib)).<br>
As an alternative to hydrogenation by means of heterogeneous catalysis, the<br>
compound of formula (III) is also accessible by hydrogenation with complex zinc-<br>
boron hydrides of (I), as described in EP 0 753 506 Al.<br>
The compound of formula (III), preferably produced by the process according to the<br>
invention, can also be converted by methyl ether cleavage in a further step (e) into<br>
the compound of formula (IV):<br>
Aqueous hydrobromic acid was formerly used for this methyl ether cleavage (EP 0<br>
753 506 Al). However, these reaction conditions have various drawbacks. To<br>
achieve satisfactory yields therefore a high excess of acid has to be used, and. after<br>
the reaction has taken place, has to be laboriously distilled off and destroyed. The<br>
fact that methyl bromide is formed as the reaction product when HBr is used is<br>
particularly serious. Methyl bromide is a toxic, highly flammable gas with a boiling<br>
point of 4°C. which, it is suspected, damages the ozone layer of the earth's<br>
atmosphere and for which a production ban in the European Union is therefore being<br>
considered.<br>
A process is therefore required which allows the desired methyl ether cleavage while<br>
avoiding the use of HBr and at the same time guarantees high yields of the product<br>
(IV).<br>
It has accordingly been found that due to the simultaneous use of methionine and<br>
methane sulphonic acid, the methyl ether cleavage of (III) to (IV) can be carried out<br>
extremely easily and with high yields of more than 70%. (The use of<br>
methionine/methane sulphonic acid to produce phenols has been described by N.<br>
Fujii et al., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I (1977) 2288-2298, but they do not convert any<br>
amine-substituted compounds). Here the compound (III), preferably in the form of<br>
the hydrochloride. is suspended in a mixture of a large excess of methane sulphonic<br>
acid, conventionally between 5 and 40 equivalents, in particular 10 to 30<br>
equivalents, particularly preferably about 20 equivalents, and 1 to 2. equivalents<br>
preferably about 1.1 to 1.3 equivalents of methionine. and then heated for 1 to 12<br>
hours, preferably 3 to 8 hours, in particular 5 hours, to temperatures of 50 to 100 °C.<br>
preferably 70 to 90°C. After cooling and conventional working up. the desired<br>
phenol (IV) is obtained in high yields without by-products and at most very small<br>
quantities of unreacted starting material (III), preferably as hydrochloride: by<br>
recrystallisation from water. (IV) is obtained in the form of hydrochloride hydrates.<br>
It is surprising in this connection that the dimethylamino group otherwise very<br>
unstable in an acid medium proves to be stable compared with the large excess of<br>
methane sulphonic acid present.<br>
An efficient process for producing the analgesic compound known from EP 0 753<br>
506 Al with the absolute configuration (IVa), starting from the tertiary alcohol (II)<br>
with the absolute configuration (IIa), is thus provided which can also be carried out<br>
on an industrial scale. The synthesis sequence is shown in diagram I. (The same<br>
applies to the optical antipode of (IVa) with (1S,2S) configuration.<br>
Diagram 1<br>
The invention will be described hereinafter by examples, without being limited<br>
thereto.<br>
Examples<br>
The syntheses were carried out using commercially available reagents and<br>
substances or with compounds that had been produced by processes known from the<br>
literature.<br>
The reaction products were identified and the chemical and optical purity analysed<br>
by NMR spectroscopy and HPLC chromatography.<br>
Example 1<br>
Chlorination using thionyl chloride: Production of (lS,2S)-[2-chIoro-2-(3-<br>
methoxy-phenyl)-cyclohexylmethyl]-dimethylamine hydrochloride<br>
3 kg (10 mol) (1S.2S)-2-dimethylaminomethyl-l-(3-methoxy-phenyl)-cyclohexanol<br>
hydrochloride were suspended in 10 1 toluene and heated to 30°C. 1.9 kg (16 mol)<br>
thionyl chloride were added within 10 min. The mixture was heated to 35° to 45°C.<br>
A clear solution was produced after 2 to 3 hours. Further processing was effected<br>
according to variant A or B.<br>
Variant A:<br>
3 kg toluene were distilled off under vacuum via a gas washer. Hydrogen chloride<br>
gas and sulphur dioxide escaped as the toluene was distilled off. The mixture was<br>
then cooled to 2°C and stirred for 2 hours at this temperature. The precipitate was<br>
centrifuged off and thoroughly rewashed with toluene. The product could be used<br>
directly or after drying for subsequent hydrogenation. The yield was 2.87 kg (90 %<br>
of theoretical) (1S,2S)-[2-chloro-2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-cyclohexylmethyl]-<br>
dimethylamine hydrochloride.<br>
Variant B:<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled to 2°C and stirred for 4 hours. The precipitate<br>
formed was centrifuged off and dried in a drying cabinet for 17 hours at 40°C and<br>
under a vacuum of 
subsequent hydrogenation. The yield was 2.55 kg (80 % of theoretical) (lS,2S)-[2-<br>
chloro-2-(3-methoxy-phenyl)-cyclohexylmethyl]-dimethylaminehydrochloride.<br>
Identification was effected by comparing the analytical data of the product obtained<br>
in variant A or B and the compound known from EP 0 753 506 Al, which exhibited<br>
identity. The chemical and optical purity was analysed by HPLC on a Nucleosil 100-<br>
5 C8 HD column (250 x 3 mm) by gradient elution with acetonitrile/water.<br>
Detection was effected using a UV spectrometer at 210 nm.<br>
Example 2<br>
Heterogeneously catalysed hydrogenation: Hydrogenation of (lS,2S)-[2-chloro-<br>
2-(3-methoxy-phenyI)-cycIohexyImethyl]-dimethylamine hydrochloride<br>
3.18 kg (10 mol) (lS.2S)-[2-chloro-2-(3-methoxy-phenyl)-cyclohexylmethyl]<br>
dimethylamine hydrochloride (from Example 1) were dissolved in 15 1 methanol.<br>
and 350 g palladium on activated carbon 5% were added. Hydrogen was introduced<br>
at normal pressure and ambient temperature until hydrogenation was complete. The<br>
catalyst was suction filtered, the solvent concentrated to a small volume and the base<br>
liberated using aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. After shaking out the aqueous<br>
phase using ethyl acetate and distilling off the organic solvent 2.47 kg (100 % of<br>
theoretical) (1 R.2R)-[2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-cyclohexylmethylamine]-dimethylamine<br>
as a slightly yellow coloured oil remained.<br>
The oil was dissolved in acetone and the hydrochloride precipitated using<br>
hydrochloric acid gas. 2.27 kg (80 % of theoretical) (lR,2R)-[2-(3-methoxy-<br>
phenyl)-cyclohexylmethylj-dimethylamine hydrochloride were obtained as a<br>
colourless powder with a content of 
cyclohexylmethyl]-dimethylamine hydrochloride. which was removed from 2-<br>
propanol by recrystallisation.<br>
Identification was effected by comparing the analytical data of the product obtained<br>
and the compound known from EP 0 753 506 Al, which exhibited identity. The<br>
chemical and optical purity was analysed by HPLC on a Nucleosil 100-5 C8 HD<br>
column (250 x 3 mm) by gradient elution with acetonitrile/water. Detection was<br>
effected using a UV spectrometer at 210 nm.<br>
Example 3<br>
Methylether cleavage using methane sulphonic acid/methionine: Production of<br>
(lR,2R)-3-(2-dimethyIaminomethyl-cyclohexyl)-phenol hydrochloride<br>
2.83 kg (10 mol) (lR.2R)-[2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-cyclohexyl-methyl]-dimethylamine<br>
hydrochloride were suspended in a mixture of 8.70 1 methane sulphonic acid and<br>
1.50 kg (D.L) methionine and heated for 5 hours to 70° to 90°C. The mixture was<br>
cooled to 30°C and adjusted using 32% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to a pH<br>
of 12 to 14. The base was extracted with ethyl acetate. After concentrating the<br>
organic solvent and precipitation in acetone with hydrochloric acid gas (or aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid) 1.86 kg (80 %) (lR,2R)-3-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-cyclohexyl)-<br>
phenol hydrochloride with a content of 
(methoxyphenyl)-cyclohexyl-methyl]-dimethylamine hydrochloride.<br>
Recrystallisation from water produced colourless crystals (1.5 kg. 80 %) of (1R,2R)-<br>
3-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-cyclohexyl)-phenol hydrochloride dihydrate.<br>
Identification was effected by comparing the analytical data of the product obtained<br>
and the compound known from EP 0 753 506 Al. which exhibited identity. The<br>
chemical and optical purity was analysed by HPLC on a Nucleosil 100-5 C8 HD<br>
column (250 x 3 mm) by gradient elution with acetonitrile/water. Detection was<br>
effected using a UV spectrometer at 210 nm.<br>
