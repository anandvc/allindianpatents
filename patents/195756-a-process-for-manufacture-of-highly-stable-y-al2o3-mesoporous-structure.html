				<td>Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a highly stabie ?-A2O3 and in particular, to a highly stable mesoporous ?-Al2O3, stabilized by a small doping of R3+ cations where R is selected from Eu3 +, La3+, Tb3 + and Cr3 + or other additive adapted to retain the mesoporous structure and<br>
porosity when exposed to elevated temperatures Also disclosed is the process for simple<br>
and cost-effective manner of manufacture of such stabilized ?-A2O3 in a mesoporous<br>
structure<br>
Background Art<br>
The ?-Al2O3 is an important polymorph of alumima It has been an indispensable industrial material in the form of various filters (for gas separation, solid separation, bacteria elimination, dust elimination, etc ), catalyst carriers, acoustic materials, insulating materials, gas sensors, thin film coatings, high-temperature gas-separation and reactors This is extensively used as catalytic supports for automotive gas exhaust catalysts in internal combustion engines The activity depends on its small size and large surface area It is used as catalysts to effectively reduce nitrogen oxides and oxidize the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons contained in gas exhaust This becomes unstable when exposed to temperatures above 1100 K, which often arise for a significant period as a result of fuel detonation in an engine<br>
A mesoporous ?-Al2O3 of stable microslructure and properties is very much demanded in these applications Several methods such as sol-gel chemistry, sonohydrolysis of alkoxide precursor, hydrothermal process, and Al-metal hydrolysis have been used to synthesize 7-A12O3 in controlled size at a nanometer scale In most of these methods, ?-Al2O3 forms at temperature between 400 and 1000 K At higher temperatures, it transformations to other polymorphs with a-Al2O3 as the equilibrium phase<br>
As such the above methods could not provide a mesoporous ?-Al2O3 This metastable phase exists in small crystallites of size under 10 nm It requires a strict control of a homogeneous micro structure at this scale and that is not so easy especially with the sol-gel method, which<br><br>
2<br>
involves a heterogeneous reaction at relatively high temperature to ensure a complete decomposition of precursor with a complete elimination of byproduct impurities<br>
US 20020192150 discloses preparation of stable ?-Al2O3 involving doping with a suitable<br>
additive such as rare-earth (R) oxide to delay the undesirable phase transformation and<br>
 prevent grain growth at elevated temperatures Other dopants include oxides of barium,<br>
 cerium, zirconium, phosphorus, or silicon Commercial doping of ?-Al2O3 involves the use<br>
of ?-Al2O3. It is the most effective to support ?-Al2O3 structure to as high temperature as<br>
1273 K In all such prior art methods a rather large amount of stabilizer of 3 to 5 mol % is<br>
used to achieve a sufficient degree of ?-Al2O, stabilization R2O3 are expensive and add<br>
significantly to the cost of the final product Hence, a need remains for a low cost<br>
manufacturing of stabilized ?-Al2O3<br>
US 20020043734 discloses a method of producing an alumina porous material using a mixed powder of alumina powder and aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)3 at different percentages as the starting material comprising the steps of heating the mixed powder to decompose the aluminum hydroxide and further heat treating it within a temperature range of 1,000 to 1,600 °C and to the alumina porous material produced by the above-mentioned method with a porosity exceeding 40 volume % and its specific surface area of 8 to 40 m2 /g and further to a filter and catalyst carrier that are obtained using this alumina porous material<br>

It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a highly stabilized ?-Al2O3 structure which would be stable at high temperature such as about 1400 K and at the same time would be cost-effective to obtain<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacture of ?-Al2O3 which would be environment friendly and require no additional reagent<br>
Yet further object is directed to provide a method of manufacture of ?-Al2O3 having a mesoporous structure throughout the temperature range to upto about 1400 K<br><br>
3<br>
Yet another object is to provide a method of manufacture of ?-Al2O3 which would be convenient and simple to stabilize ?-Al2O3 phase<br>
Yet further object is to provide a method of providing of ?-Al2O3 which would require very small amount of doping to stabilize ?-Al2O3 phase over an extended range of temperature to 1400 K and involve simple and fewer steps<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The starting reagents used are preferably commercial RC13 6H2O or (NH4)Cr2 of 99 9 % purity and a mesoporous AlO(OH) aH2O powder A freshly prepared AlO(OH) aH2O by hydrolysis of a pure Al-metal (99 9 %) in cold water vapour (as described in our copending Ind Patent Appln Nos 102/Cal/2001) was used It had - 90 % initial porosity An<br><br>
6<br>
aqueous RC13 6H2O or (NH4)2Cr2O7 solution in 004 to 040 M or 0 2 to 1 0 M concentration was used The final reaction and doping were carried as follows<br>
As shown schematically in scheme 1, the method of the present invention includes the steps of (a) providing an aqueous R3+ solution, (b) soaking R3+ cations in divided groups in mesopores by reacting (a) with a hydrogenated mesoporous AlO(OH) aH2O powder at room temperature, (c) washing the resultant in distilled water to remove the chloride ions and other byproduct impurities, and then (d) drying it at ~ 450 K in air A product of finely divided loose powder of highly stable ?-Al2O3 of nanoparticles with R2O3 additives after heating at 500 to 1000 K in air or vacuum was obtained<br><br>
Scheme 1: A schematic diagram in forming a stable ?-Al2O3 mesoporous by a reactive R3+ doping with a mesoporous AlO(OH) aH2O precursor power.<br>
On a dropwise addition of R3+ cations (in the aqueous solution) to a hydrogenated mesoporous AlO(OH) aH2O precursor, a coreduction reaction occured and converted RCl3 to R2O3 as per the reaction,<br><br>
7<br>
2RC13 + 6A1O(OH) aH2O ? R2O3 + 3A12O3 + 6 {aH2O + HCl} (1)<br>
The sample dried at 450K, was analyzed with X-ray diffraction, which revealed that the Eu2O3 occured in nanoparticles in R3c hexagonal crystal structure dispersed in an amorphous Al2O3 On heating, they dissolve in A12O3 in a complete amorphous structure at ~ 700 K A reconstructive nucleation and growth occurs and results in ?-Al2O3 in 2 h of heating at 900 to 1100 K in air In 0 4 mol % Eu3+ Al2O3 sample, the lattice parameter is a<br>
- 0 7890 nm in comparison to the standard a = 0 7924 nm value in O7H -FD3M cubic crystal<br><br>
structure It had 40 % porosity as analyzed by N2 gas sorption Average crystallite size is determined to be 6 5 nm by the widths in the diffraction peaks In TEM micrograph, the particles and pores appear in 5-10 nm size in a mesoporous structure<br>
Beneficially, the Eu2O3, which dissolved in the amorphous A12O3 on heating at lower temperatures, does not recrystallize at such high temperatures That intimately adheres to the ? -Al2O3 recrystallized in nanoparticles in integral part of the modified surfaces or grain boundaries Similar results appear with other La3+, Tb3+ or Cr3+ additives as explored in this work As given in Table 1, all of them stabilize the?-Al2O3in nanoparticles over a wide range of temperature extending to as high value as 1400 K In no case, the crystallite size<br>
grows above 10 nm on heating the sample to this critical value of temperature<br>
The objects of the invention and its advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in<br>
relating to non-limiting exemplary illustrations as per the following examples<br>
Example - 1 :<br>
This example was carried out with a pure AlO(OH) aH2O powder of a mesoporous structure It had derived by hydrolysis of a pure Al-metal (99 9 %) in cold water vapour as described above It had reactive hydrogen gas filled-up in pores by reaction with H2 gas, which generates during the synthesis On heating, it decomposed to a pure ?-Al2O3 power (mesoporous) The pores act as an efficient stabilizer so that the product retains its struture of ?-Al2O3 up to a temperature of 1250 K, with 40 % porosity and 8 0 nm controlled size<br><br>
8<br>

Example-2 :<br>
In this example, Eu3+ is doped in ?-Al2O3 in a solid solution It was done with a reactive doping through a mesoporous AlO(OH) aH2O powder According to it, a predetermined volume of aqueous EuCl3 solution (0 04 to 0 4 M concentration) was added dropwise to a hydrogenated mesoporous AJO(OH) aH2O powder at room temperature The volume or mass in two reactants was taken in a way that gave 0 2 to 15 mol % EU2O3 in the final product with ?-Al2O3 Stirring the mixture over a magnetic stirrer promoted a homogeneous reaction A paste like specimen formed which was dried at ~ 450 K in air after repeated washing in distilled water A nanopowder (mesoporous) resulted in Eu3+ doped ?-Al2O3 on heating at 900 to 1100 K in air or vacuum The Eu3+ additives promoted the ?-Al2O3 stability so that it exists up to an extended temperature of 1400 K A 2 h of heating at 1400 K retains 10 nm crystallite size and 30 % porosity<br>
Example-3 :<br>
The same procedure of Example -2 was extended to obtain stabilized ?-Al2O3 with other additives of R = La3+, Tb3+ or other rare-earth cations The reaction was carried out by a dropwise addition of an aqueous RCl3 solution (0 04 to 0 4 M concentration) to a hydrogenated mesoporous AlO(OH) aH2O powder A R3+ doped ?-Al2O3 powder (mesoporous) results in 2 h of heating at 900 to 1300 K in air by recovered precursor powder after washing and drying at 450 K in air It exists to a temperature of 1400 K with a maximum of 10 nm crystallite size and 30 % porosity<br>
Example-4 :<br>
The above procedure of Example -2 or 3 is extended to obtain a stabilized ?-Al2O3 with Cr2O3 additive, which is an economic material in comparison to those of rare-earth oxides used in these examples The reaction was carried out in a similar manner by a dropwise addition of an aqueous (NH4)2Cr2O7 solution (0 2 to 10 M concentration) to a hydrogenated mesoporous AlO(OH) aH2O powder A Cr3+ doped ?-Al2O3 powder<br><br>
9<br>
(mesoporous) resulted in 2h of heating at 800 to 1000 K in air by the precursor powder after washing and drying at 450 K in air It exists to a temperature of 1300 K with a maximum of 10 nm crystallite size and 35 % porosity<br>
The preferred optimal contents of the various R2O3 additives were further identified as given in Table 1 The EU2O3 or Tb2O3 is found to be the most effective in stabilizing ?-Al2O3 over an extended range of temperatures<br><br>

As apparent from the table, the stabilized ?-Al2O3 are far superior to those obtained following other known methods of ?-Al2O3 stabilization Moreover, the method of the invention gave mesoporous structure, which further stabilize this phase with the intergranular additives Importantly, only 0 2 to 15 mol % of the additives is sufficient enough to meet the maximum stability<br><br>
10<br>
Furthermore, the additives of R2O3, with R = Eu3+, La3+, Tb3+ or Cr3+, used in the present method do not segregate in an independent phase on heating the sample to the critical value of temperature As a result, the improved stability in a solid solution of the product with ?-Al2O3 is achieved It provides for new optical properties with strong photoluminescence in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum with new applications of optical materials Obviously, the invention serves as a very simple and economic method for processing of stabilized ?-Al2O3in a mesoporous structure with a simple reaction in water The method is further adapted to incorporate several other additives either to promote ?-A2O3 phase in an extended thermal stability or to induce new properties<br><br>
