PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a method of operating an electronic valve, in particular a valve adapted for use in a high power converter such as an Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT), wherein a process of changing a charging state of a control electrode of the valve is repeatedly performed in a similar manner. More particularly, the invention relates to converters comprising such valves, e.g. for delivering electric energy to a driving motor of a railroad traction vehicle. Furthermore, the invention relates to a corresponding arrangement for operating the electronic valve.<br>
Controlling the valves by using pulse signals generated by a control device is well known in the art. In particular, a first edge of a pulse signal initiates a process of switching-on of at least one of the valves and a second edge of the pulse signal initiates a process of switching-off of the valve or of the valves. The first edge may be - defined by a step-like increase of a voltage from a low potential to a high potential at a control signal input of a driver circuit, or, in the case of a light pulse, by a transition from dark to light at a control signal input. The second edge may be defined by a step-like decrease of the voltage from a high potential to a low potential at the control signal input or by a transition from light to dark at the control signal input. In particular, the initiation of the switching process causes a current flow to or from the control electrode (e.g. gate) of the valve, whereby the control electrode is charged or discharged and, as a result, a current flow through the valve is enabled or disabled. However, the invention, which will be described later, can also be applied in connection with other embodiments of initiation and/or control of the switching process.<br>
In recent times, collector-emitter voltages of IGBTs have been increased significantly. For example, it has become possible to switch voltages of some thousand volts, for example voltages ranging between 3300 or 6500 volts. As a result, the task of reducing switching losses has gained in significance, particularly where IGBTs are<br><br><br>
concerned, which are used in converters. The switching speed is an important factor which is to be taken into account for any strategy in reducing switching losses. Unfortunately, the switching speed depends on several quantities, such as the individual properties of the IGBT, the operation temperature, the level of the voltage to be switched, the level of the current flowing through the valve and any inaccuracies of a driving device for driving an electric current to or from the control electrode. If a valve, connected in series to another valve is switched too fast, a short circuit may occur. If the switching speed cannot be controlled precisely, it is therefore necessary to slow down the switching process.<br>
CA 2456681 Al discloses a control process for piloting the opening and/or closure of an electronic power component, wherein the piloting process comprising a plurality of steps for controlling the application of a succession of different commutation voltages on a control electrode of said component between the instant when the piloting process begins and the instant when the opening and/or closure of the electronic power component must stop, the passage from one step to the following step in this piloting process being effected automatically as soon as a corresponding condition of passage is satisfied. The control process comprises the following steps: (a) reading the value of at least one operational parameter characteristic of the reaction of the electronic power component in response to the successive application of said commutation voltages, (b) verifying, thanks to the values read, whether this reaction of the electronic power component is produced in a predetermined imparted time, (c) if so, allowing said piloting process to continue normally, and (d) if not, interrupting said piloting process and immediately triggering of a process for safeguarding the integrity of the electronic power component.<br>
There are different approaches of performing the control process for switching the valve on or off. All these approaches can be realised in connection with the invention, which will be described later. For example, a voltage source with a controllable voltage can be used in combination with a resistor, located in an electrical connection between the voltage source and the control electrode of the<br>
valve. According to another approach, a voltage amplifier with pre-programmed voltage slopes may be used. Furthermore, a current source amplifier with preÂ¬programmed levels of the current to or from the control electrode may be provided. In any case, the process of switching the valve on or switching it off may be divided into a plurality of time zones, wherein the voltage of the voltage source, the voltage slope of the voltage amplifier or the current level of the current source amplifier differ from time zone to time zone. The respective time zone is terminated by an event, such as the event when the gate-emitter voltage of an IGBT reaches a predefined level.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and an arrangement of the kind indicated above, whereby it is possible to control the repeated execution of the switching process of the valve with precision in order to allow fast execution of the switching process.<br>
The present invention is defined by the attached patent claims.<br>
It is proposed to define a specific operating state of the valve, which operating state can be reached by changing a charging state of a control electrode of the valve, and to monitor whether the specific operating state is reached at a predetermined point in time. For example, the predetermined point in time may be predetermined by a time interval of a set length. The starting point of such a time interval may be defined by receipt of a control signal at a control unit for controlling the process of changing the charging state of the control electrode, wherein the process is initiated on receipt of the control signal or a time period of predetermined length after the receipt.<br>
Alternatively, the time interval may start at a time when the valve reaches a second specific operating state. For example, the second specific operating state may be defined by a first specific (low) collector - emitter voltage and the first specific operating state (which is reached after the second specific operating state) may be<br>
- 9 SEP 2008<br><br>
defined by a second specific collector - emitter voltage which is higher than the first specific collector - emitter voltage. Other definitions of the first or second specific operating state are possible. For example, the second specific operating state (or a corresponding event) may be defined by reaching a negative threshold for the emitter(Main) - emitter(Kelvin) voltage, indicating the beginning of current reduction.<br>
Preferably, the length of the time interval may be fixed for all similar processes of changing the charging state of the valve, wherein each of the similar processes is to be performed in one of a plurality of consecutive procedures of switching on or switching off the valve.<br>
Furthermore, the following is proposed: A method of operating an electronic valve, in particular a valve adapted for use in a high power converter, wherein<br>
a process of changing a charging state of a control electrode, in particular of<br>
an insulated gate of the valve, is repeatedly performed,<br>
for an earlier execution of the process, it is determined whether a specific<br>
operating  state   is   reached   at  a   predetermined   point   in  time   and   a<br>
corresponding determination result is obtained and<br>
the process of changing the charging state is adapted for a future execution of<br>
the process using the determination result.<br>
An arrangement for operating an electronic valve may comprise:<br>
a driver device adapted to drive an electric current to and/or from a control<br>
electrode of the valve,<br>
a determining device adapted to determine whether a specific operating state<br>
of the valve is reached at a predetermined point in time, and adapted to<br>
obtain a corresponding determination result and<br>
a control unit for repeatedly controlling a process of changing a charging state<br>
of the control electrode of the valve in order to switch on or to switch off the<br>
valve, wherein the control unit is connected to the determining device or<br><br><br>
wherein it comprises the determining device, and wherein the control unit is adapted to perform a future execution of the process of changing the charging state of the control electrode by controlling the driver device in a corresponding manner, taking the determination result into account.<br>
The electronic valve may be any valve whose switching process can be controlled by directly or indirectly adjusting the current to or from the control electrode. Examples are: IGBTs and Metall Oxide Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs), or more generally speaking, valves that have an insulated control electrode (gate). However, IGBTs are preferred for high-power applications, such as converters used to provide electric energy to power consumers like driving motors or industrial machines.<br>
The specific operating state is to be understood as a state in which at least one quantity, in particular an electric quantity (such as the collector emitter voltage, the gate emitter voltage, the collector current or a derivative) fulfils a defined condition, e.g. a state in which the quantity is equal to a defined value. Strategies for optimising the switching process have been discussed in detail in many publications before the invention. With the invention, it is now possible to optimise the switching procedure in a simple, but highly effective way. The switching speed of the valve can be precisely controlled by monitoring whether the specific operating state is reached at the predetermined point in time or not.<br>
With the invention, the repeated processes of charging and/or discharging can be controlled in a particularly stable manner, as the determination of whether the specific operating state is reached at the predetermined point in time, and/ or the adaptation of the process of changing the charging state can be performed by digital data processing (which is realised in the most preferred embodiment of the invention). Compared to analogue data processing, there is much less sensitivity to noise or interference.<br>
- 9 SEP 2008<br><br>
Furthermore, the process of changing the charging state is corrected taking the determination result into account. For example, the current to or from the control electrode (e.g. the gate current) is increased if the specific operating state (which depends on the level or height of the current) is reached too late. With the invention, a particularly robust auto-correction of the process can be performed: this process is not directly dependent on the determination result, as this would be the case when a deviation between the actual operating state and the (desired) specific operating state (e.g. a voltage deviation) is fed back in a conventional control loop in order to regulate the process in dependence on the extent of the deviation. In particular if a corresponding analogue signal is used (which is typical for conventional control purposes), the process becomes dependent on the operating state and the physical properties of any device which is used to determine and/or feed back the analogue signal. As a result, the process itself becomes dependent on device properties and varying conditions. Furthermore, the control process is sensible to noise and interference. In contrast to this, it is possible to adjust the process in a manner which will be described in more detail and which uses the determination result merely as a "yes-or-no" result: Either the specific operating state is reached or not. However, modifications of this approach are within the scope of the invention as well. Consequently, the process can be controlled more closely to the allowable limits and, as a benefit, switching losses can be reduced. In other words: The valve can safely be operated within the range of allowable limits (e.g. peak voltage, time derivative of voltage, time derivative of current carried by the valve) although the switching losses are low. Furthermore, a safe operation prevents the valve (and, for example, a converter which includes the valve) from being destroyed.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the process (and thus the time zone, if applicable) is terminated at or before the predetermined point in time. As a result, it is possible to evaluate the determination result and to adapt the process for future execution, e.g. for the subsequent execution. In all cases, the timing of the process and the predetermined point in time are preferably in a fixed relation, so that the<br>
- 9 SEP 2008<br><br>
determination result comprises reliable information of how to adapt the process. In the most preferred embodiment, the process has a fixed length, and there is a fixed time difference (which may be zero) between the end time of the process and the predetermined point in time.<br>
Since the adaptation of the process is based on the predetermined point in time, the process can be performed nearly independently from operating conditions. This applies particularly to the operating conditions which influence the switching speed (as mentioned above), as long as the predetermined point in time can precisely be determined. In particular, the clock can be used as well as a clock signal generator for a logic device, which is adapted to control an operation of the valve and, optionally, to control further operational tasks, such as the operation of further valves of a converter and/or the operation of the complete converter, or at least subsystems of the converter. For example, modern logic devices, such as CPLDs (Complex Programmable Logic Devices) and/or FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) may be used as the logic device. These logic devices require a clock signal generator, which is operated at a high accuracy, e.g. at an accuracy of at least 100 ppm (=0.01 %). Such a high accuracy is usually sufficient for the determination of the predetermined point in time.<br>
Furthermore, it is not necessary to use a real time clock for the determination of the predetermined point in time. Rather, it is possible, for example, to count clock signals of the clock signal generator triggered by a trigger signal. E.g. the trigger signal may be signal which initiates the switching-on or switching-off of the valve.<br>
Preferably, the process is one of a plurality of consecutive processes to be performed in order to change the charging state of the control electrode, in particular in order to switch the valve on or to switch it off. For example, it is possible to define a specific operating state for more than one of the processes, and to subsequently perform the method of the invention for these processes. Thus, these processes can be adapted separately. For example, the current to or from the control electrode can be adjusted<br>
- 9 SEP 2008<br><br>
separately for these different processes (time zones). Furthermore, the determination result may be obtained for each of a multiplicity of consecutive procedures of switching on and/or switching off the valve.<br>
In particular when the determination result is obtained by digital data processing, it is preferred to define a tolerance time interval, wherein the predetermined point in time is within the tolerance time interval. In this case, it is determined that the specific operating state is reached at the predetermined point in time, if the specific operating state is reached within the tolerance time interval. In other words: it is decided that there is no need to adapt the process of changing the charging state if the specific operating state is reached within the limits of the tolerance time interval.<br>
By way of example, the adaptation of the process of changing the charging state is described in more detail in the following. Preferably, at least one quantity (in particular an electric current to or from the control electrode or a voltage slope of a voltage source is used to drive the electric current) can be adjusted in order to adapt the process, wherein the at least one quantity is adjusted correspondingly to the determination result.<br>
In order to start the operation of the valve (in particular when it is switched on for the first time after a non-working period) with a defined value of the at least one quantity and in order to avoid interference, an initial value of the at least one quantity is chosen so that<br>
a changing rate of an electric voltage at the valve, or at a driver circuit for<br>
controlling an operation of the valve, in particular a gate-emitter voltage,<br>
this electric voltage and/or<br>
a changing rate of an electric current flowing through the valve is/are within specified limits, in particular not greater than a limit. Preferably, the initial value may be chosen so that the limits are not exceeded for the least favourable working conditions of the valve (e.g. the lowest possible operation<br><br>
temperature, the highest possible level of the voltage to be switched, the lowest possible level of the current flowing through the valve).<br>
In particular, an adjustment of the quantity is performed if the specific operating state is not reached within the tolerance time interval for at least one execution of the process.<br>
It is preferred to adjust the at least one quantity by a small amount, in particular by an amount so small that a single adjustment cannot have a negative effect on the operation of the valve during the following switching process, even if the adjustment is performed by mistake (e.g. due to interference or noise). In particular, the amount is so small that the valve can safely be operated within a range of allowable limits (e.g. peak voltage, time derivative of voltage, time derivative of current carried by the valve) during the following switching operation of the valve. The idea behind this embodiment is to make the adaptation of the process particularly stable. One small adjustment cannot result in an operation state which is significantly different from the operation state before the adjustment.<br>
Small adjustments may lead to a slowed adaptation of the process. It might be necessary to perform a plurality of adjustments (e.g. between consecutive switching processes) by a small amount in order to reach the specific operation state in time. However, since a valve is typically switched on and off at switching frequencies of some 100 Hz or some kHz for many applications, and since the operating conditions, such as temperature and voltage to be switched (e.g. collector-emitter voltage) do not change quickly, a slow adaptation is sufficient and does not lead to high overall switching losses. Rather, due to the stable and precise adaptation, it is possible to operate the valve close to the optimal operating situation, i.e. the situation with the smallest switching losses.<br>
In particular, the at least one quantity may be adjusted by a predetermined amount or by a predetermined fraction of the instantaneous value of the quantity (e.g. a<br><br><br>
fraction which is in the range of 0.1 to 1 % of the instantaneous value and/or a fraction which in the range of 0.1 to 1 % of the maximum value of the at least one quantity), if the specific operating state is not reached at the predetermined point in time. For example, the quantity may be a charging or discharging current which is kept constant during a part of the charging or discharging process. If (by way of example) the maximum charging current is 12 A, adjustment steps of 50 mA may preferably be used in order to adjust the current and in order to reach the specific operating state at the predetermined point in time.<br>
In addition or alternatively, the at least one quantity may be changed to a value selected from a pre-determined set of values, wherein the value is selected according to the determination result.<br>
In all cases which are described in the two preceding paragraphs, the adaptation of the process shows a "digital" behaviour, since the set of possible new values is restricted to a limited number of values.<br>
Furthermore, according to the most preferred embodiment of the invention, the new value of the at least one quantity, which is used to perform the next following process of changing the charging state of the control electrode, is directly dependent on two factors only: the previous value of the quantity and the determination result. Thus, the new value is not influenced by any analogue feedback of the operating state of the valve. In particular, for each process of changing the charging state the control signal applied to the control electrode is "predetermined", except for influences of the environment of the valve which can be considered as constant.<br>
Generally, it is not absolutely necessary to use a tolerance time interval when small adjustment steps are performed. However, according to an embodiment of the invention, the at least one quantity may be adjusted by an amount so small that, after its adjustment, the specific operating state is not reached beyond the tolerance time interval at the next following execution of the process. In other words: the specific operating state will not be reached after the tolerance time interval at the following<br>
 9 SEP 2008<br><br>
execution if it was reached before the tolerance time interval at the present execution, and vice versa.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferred that the decision of whether to adapt the process of changing the charging state does not depend on a single determination result only. Rather, the determination result may be obtained for a plurality of executions (e.g. five) of the process, and all these determination results are taken into account. For example, a group with a fixed number of consecutive executions of the process is evaluated for the decision after each execution. More particularly, the decision to adjust the process may only be derived if each of the determination results, which have been taken into account, suggests the adjustment (e.g. the specific operating state has been reached too late for all corresponding executions of the process).<br>
In particular, the process is terminated at the predetermined point in time by changing a value of the at least one quantity, for example by changing the current to or from the control electrode. There are different options to determine whether the specific operating state is reached at the predetermined point in time. For example, a quantity which is characteristic for an operating state of the valve may be evaluated at the predetermined point in time, and may be compared to a comparison value in order to determine whether the specific operating state is reached at the predetermined point in time.<br>
However, it is preferred to define an event which may occur during or after the process of changing the charging state. At the very time of the event occurring, the specific operating state is reached. Therefore, it is proposed to determine a second point in time where the event occurs, and to evaluate whether the second point in time is before or after the predetermined point in time. The adaptation of the process does not require a value determination of the time difference between the second point in time and the predetermined point in time (it is, nevertheless, possible to use this information for the adaptation). In particular, if the adaptation is performed by adjusting a quantity by a predetermined amount or fraction (as<br>
- 9 SEP 2008<br><br>
described above), the only requirement will be to know whether the second point in time comes/came before or after the predetermined point in time. As a result, the process can be adapted so that the defined event will occur at the desired (predetermined) point in time, when the process will be executed again<br>
A corresponding embodiment of the arrangement proposed above comprises an event determining device which is connected to the control unit, wherein the event determining device is adapted to determine an occurrence of a predefined event during charging or discharging the control electrode.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention includes a converter for converting a current, in particular for a high power application such as providing electric energy to a driving motor of a railroad traction vehicle. The converter comprises the arrangement proposed above, wherein the converter can be operated by repeatedly switching the valve on and off, and wherein the arrangement and the control electrode are connected to each other via a connection for discharging and/or charging the control electrode.<br>
In addition, the present invention includes the programmable logic device, comprising the control unit of the arrangement proposed above, wherein the programmable logic device is adapted to control the process of changing the charging state of the control electrode, according to one of the embodiments of the method proposed above.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention will be described in more detail, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawing by way of example. However, the following description is not intended to limit the scope of protection of the invention. In the drawing, the same reference numerals are used for identical parts or units and for parts or units with a similar function. The figures of the drawing show:<br><br><br>
Fig. 1      an arrangement according to the most preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention; Fig. 2      an arrangement with a converter and a load; Fig. 3      a gate current as a function of time during a process of switching on an<br>
IGBT; and Fig. 4      a gate current as a function of time during a process of switching off an<br>
IGBT<br>
Fig. 1 shows an IGBT 18. The insulated gate of the IGBT 18 is denoted with the reference numeral 17, the collector with the reference numeral 20 and the emitter with the reference numeral 19. An event detecting device 16 for detecting the occurrence of predetermined events is connected to the emitter 19, to the collector 20 and to the gate 17. Considering the IGBT in more detail, the IGBT comprises an emitter (Main) and an emitter (Kelvin). Thus, it is also possible to determine the specific operating state by observing a voltage between the emitter (Main) and the emitter (Kelvin).<br>
A control unit 10 for controlling processes of switching on and switching off the IGBT 18 (and optionally at least one further IGBT) is provided. The event detecting device 16, a gate current amplifier 12 for driving a current to and/or from the gate 17 and a signal converter 14 for converting an optical control signal to an electrical control signal are connected to the control unit 10. The gate current amplifier 12 is connected to the gate 17. Furthermore, a high-precision electronic clock signal generator 11 is connected to the control unit 10.<br>
The control unit 10 may be a programmable logic device. The IGBT 18 - and further electronic valves - may be part of a converter such as the converter 21 shown in Fig. 2, wherein the converter 21 is connected to an energy supply circuit (e. g. a direct current intermediate circuit) or to an energy supply network 27 (e.g. a single-phase alternating current network of a railway system). Furthermore, the converter 21 is connected to a load 25 (e.g. a driving motor of a railroad traction vehicle) and its<br>
" 9 SEP 2008<br><br>
operation is controlled by a controlling device 23, which controls the operation using PWM signals, for example. In particular, optical switching signals that correspond to the PWM signals may be transferred from the controlling device 23 to the signal converter 14 in order to trigger a switching process to be performed by the control unit 10.<br>
The operation of the arrangement shown in Fig. 1 will be described in the following with reference to Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. When a corresponding optical control signal is received at a signal input 13 of the signal converter 14, the optical signal is converted to an electrical signal, for example by stepping-up a voltage from a low level to a high level. The electrical signal is transferred to a signal input 15 of the control unit 10. On receipt of the control signal (e.g. when the voltage steps-up to the high level) the control unit 10 initiates a procedure of switching on the IGBT18.<br>
The procedure is divided into a plurality of time zones (first zone: from time tl to time t2, second zone: from time t2 to time t3, third zone: from time t3 to time t4, fourth zone: from time t4 to time t5), wherein the control unit 10 causes the gate current amplifier 12 to drive a gate current IG of a given, constant height in each of the time zones. The height or level of the gate current IG in at least some of the time zones is dependent on a correction procedure described in the following, wherein the correction procedure corresponds to a preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
On the other hand, the lengths of the time zones do not depend on the correction procedure. Rather, the lengths are fixed for a given operation state of the arrangement shown in Fig. 2. For example, the lengths may be adapted, if the load 25 is operated in a different manner. In the particular example of Fig. 3, the length of the first time zone is 1 us plus/minus 20 ns, the length of the second time zone is 0.5 us plus/minus 20 ns, the length of the third time zone is 0.3 us plus/minus 20 ns and the length of the fourth time zone is 1 us plus/minus 20 ns.<br><br>
In an alternative embodiment, the length of at least one of the time zones can be adjusted, for example in order to adapt the operation to modified operating conditions and/or in order to increase the safety and/or the accuracy of the switching process thus decreasing switching losses.<br>
In order to perform the correction procedure and in order to decide whether the level of the gate current IG is to be adjusted, the time of a predefined event occurring is monitored and/or registered. For example, a corresponding signal is transferred from the event detecting device 16 to the control unit 10 when the event occurs. The control unit 10 determines whether the event occurred before, at or after a predetermined or defined point in time. If the event did not occur at the point in time (or, optionally, within a tolerance period of defined length, including the point in time), the control unit 10 either adjusts the level of the gate current IG for future use in the same time zone of the next following process of switching the valve, or it uses the information obtained to decide later whether such a correction is to be performed.<br>
For example, the correction may be performed if the event repeatedly occurs too early for the corresponding time zones of consecutive switching processes. For example, the correction may be performed only, if the event occurs too late in a predefined number (e. g. five) of consecutive switching processes. This may eliminate the influence of noise and/or any interference.<br>
Clock signals, which are repeatedly transferred from the high precision clock 11 to the control unit 10, are used by the control unit 10 in order to precisely determine the defined point in time. For example, the control signal which initiates the process of switching the valve 18, triggers the start of a counting procedure for counting clock signals, wherein the predetermined point in time corresponds to a specific number of counted signals. When the number of clock signals counted is equal to the specific number, the defined point in time has arrived and the control unit 10 evaluates whether the defined event occurred before or after the end of the time zone<br>
~ 9 SEP 2008<br><br>
(optionally plus or minus a tolerance time). If the event has not occurred yet (optionally including the tolerance time period), it is decided that the event is too late (not in time).<br>
If the control unit 10 decides that the process of charging or de-charging the gate 17 is to be adapted in at least one of the time zones, it outputs a corresponding control signal to the gate current amplifier 12, wherein the control signal causes the gate current amplifier 12 to drive a gate current at the corresponding amended level during the respective time zone.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferred to correct the height of the gate current IG by small steps only, e.g. by steps of smaller or equal to 1 % of a default value of the current. The default value may be used as an initial value at the beginning of an operation of the valve, when the correction process has not been performed yet. After each correction step, it is checked whether the current is still too high (or too low) before a further correction step is performed.<br>
The description of the correction procedure applies to all time zones of the switching process for which an event is defined. In the first time zone of a process of switching on the IGBT 18, the gate 17 is pre-charged. The corresponding defined event is the event that the voltage VGE between the gate 17 and the emitter 19 reaches a defined voltage level, e.g. a voltage level of 3 Volt. In the second zone the actual start of a current flow (collector-emitter current) through the IGBT 18 is prepared. The defined event is the event that an increase of the collector-emitter current occurs for the first time after the first time zone (or an increase is detected). For the third time zone no event is defined. In the third time zone a reverse recovery of a freewheeling diode (not shown in Fig. 1) may be performed. The diode is connected in parallel to a second IGBT, wherein the second IGBT and the IGBT 18 may be connected in series to each other. E.g., the second IGBT and the IGBT 18 may be part of the converter 21 and may be used to control one phase of a three-phase alternating current. In the fourth time zone the voltage VCE between the collector 20 and the emitter 19 is<br><br><br>
reduced. The defined event is the event that the voltage VCE reaches a defined voltage level.<br>
Fig. 3 shows three time-dependent signals S1, S2, S3, which are transferred from the event detecting device 16 to the control unit 10 and which indicate the occurrence of a corresponding event.<br>
The step-like increase of the signal S1 indicates the occurrence of the event defined for the first time zone. As shown in Fig. 3, the event occurs after time t2 which suggests increasing the level (the plateau) of the gate current. The decision whether the level is actually increased or not may depend on the signal S1 obtained for further executions of the charging process of the first time zone. A corresponding routine which is capable of making the decision is implemented in the control unit 10.<br>
The step-like increase of the signal S2 indicates the occurrence of the event, defined for the second time zone. As shown in Fig. 3, the event occurs earlier than the time t3. This does not necessarily suggest the adjustment (in this case: the decrease) of the level of the gate current during the second time zone, since the event defined for the first time zone did not occur in time. There are different ways of handling this situation. According to a first approach, the occurrence time of the event is compared with time t3, the end time of the second time zone. According to a second approach, the occurrence time of the event is compared with the occurrence time of the event defined for the first time zone (when signal S1 steps-up to a higher signal level), plus the duration of the second time zone.<br>
It is preferred to choose the start values for the gate currents in all time zones in such a manner that all events occur too late at the beginning of the valve operation.<br>
- 9 SEP 2008<br><br>
The step-like decrease of the signal S3 indicates the occurrence of the event defined for the fourth time zone. As shown in Fig. 3, the event occurs slightly after the time t5.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a corresponding procedure of switching off the IGBT 18. As in the case of Fig. 3, there are four time zones with constant gate current level, wherein an event is defined and the level of the gate current IG can be adjusted (as indicated by short vertical lines pointing up and down) in a corresponding correction procedure for three of the time zones. Three time-dependent signals S4, S5 and S6, which are transferred from the event detecting device 16 to the control unit 10, indicate the occurrences of the corresponding events.<br><br>
