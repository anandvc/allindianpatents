STABILIZED, SOLID-STATE POLYPETIDE PARTICLES<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
		[0001] Field of the Invention: The invention is directed to polypeptide<br>
	formulations in solid-state, wherein the polypeptide is stabilized against degradation at<br>
5	elevated temperatures over an extended period of time. In particular, tbe present<br>
	invention provides formulations and methods for preparing solid-state polypeptide<br>
	particles, wherein the polypeptides are stabilized through one or more stabilizing<br>
	conditions.<br>
		[0002] State of the Art: Implantable devices capable of delivering desired<br>
10	doses of an active agent, such as a polypeptide, over extended periods of time are<br>
	known in the art. For example, U.S. patents 5,728,396, 5,985,305, 6,113,938,<br>
	6,156,331, 6,375,978, and 6,395,292 teach implantable osmotic devices capable of<br>
	delivering a stable active agent formulation, such as a solution or a suspension, and at a<br>
	desired rate over an extended period of time (i.e., a period ranging from about two<br>
15	weeks to several months or more). Implantable drug delivery systems also include<br>
	depot-type materials, such as those described in U.S. patents 6,468,961, 6331,311, and<br>
	6,130,200, Depot materials typically sequester the active agent within a biodegradable<br>
	or bioerodible depot material such that the active agent is delivered from the implanted<br>
	depot material based on diffusion of the active agent or degradation or erosion of the<br>
20	depot material, Exemplary depot materials include PLGA-based systems, which are<br>
	typically capable of delivering the active agent over periods ranging from about 2<br>
	weeks to 6 months. Because they can be designed to deliver a desired active agent at<br>
	therapeutic levels over an extended period of time, implantable delivery systems can<br>
	advantageously provide long-term therapeutic dosing of a desired active agent without<br>
25	requiring frequent visits to a healthcare provider or repetitive self-medication.<br>
	However, delivering therapeutic polypeptides over an extended period of time using an<br>
	implantable drug delivery system presents various technical challenges.<br>
		[0003] In particular, it has proven challenging to maintain the stability of<br>
	therapeutic polypeptides loaded in an implantable delivery system designed to deliver<br>
30	the polypeptide over a period of weeks or months. In order to achieve an implantable<br><br>
WO 2004/039392									PCT/US2003/034229<br>
	system of suitable size that provides delivery of therapeutic doses of a polypeptide over<br>
	an extended period of time, it is generally necessary to load the system with a solution<br>
	or suspension containing a high concentration of the polypeptide to be delivered.<br>
	However, if such a solution or suspension is exposed to temperatures that approach or<br>
5	exceed physiological conditions (e,g., temperatures that approach or exceed 37Â° C) over<br>
	an extended period of time, the polypeptide contained in the solution or suspension will<br>
	degrade if the polypeptide is not stabilized. Degradation of polypeptides exposed to<br>
	temperatures that approximate or exceed physiological conditions can proceed through<br>
	various pathways and can alter, reduce or destroy the biological activity of the<br>
10	polypeptide. Therefore, in order to achieve an implantable delivery system capable of<br>
	successfully delivering a therapeutic polypeptide over an extended period of time, the<br>
	polypeptide loaded therein must be stabilized against degradation such that the system<br>
	is capable of delivering therapeutic doses of biologically active polypeptide over the<br>
	functional life of the implantable system.<br>
15		[0004] Sugars have been used in polypeptide formulations to stabilize the<br>
	polypeptides contained therein against degradation over time. In particular, sugars have<br>
	been used as lyoprotectants, working to inhibit polypeptide aggregation by reducing<br>
	molecular unfolding during the lyophilization process. Sugars also impart long-term<br>
	stability by limiting molecular mobility and by mimizing molecular interactions<br>
20	during and after the lyophilization process. However, when using a sugar to stabilize a<br>
	polypeptide, it is often necessary to use large amounts in order to achieve a desired<br>
	degree of stabilisation. As is taught in U.S. patent 5,267,958 to Andya et al., as much<br>
	as 100 to 510 molar ratios of stabilizing sugar may be needed in order to achieve an<br>
	acceptable stabilization effect, and polypeptide formulations including such large<br>
25	amounts of stabilizing sugar are not well suited for loading in an implantable drug<br>
	delivery system.<br>
		[0005] Where a high concentration of stabilizing sugar is needed to achieve<br>
	a desired degree of polypeptide stabilization within a delivery system, the overall bulk<br>
	of the polypeptide formulation contained within the system increases, while the<br>
30	maximum concentration of polypeptide that can be loaded into the system decreases.<br>
	As the concentration of the polypeptide in the formulation loaded into an implantable<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2004/039392								PCT/US2003/034229<br>
	system decreases, the amount of polypeptide formulation required to achieve a desired<br>
	dosing regimen and the minimum size of the implanted system increase. It would be an<br>
	improvement in the art, therefore, to provide formulations and methods for stabilizing<br>
	therapeutic polypeptides that reduce or altogether eliminate the need for a stabilizing<br>
5	sugar. It would be a further improvement in the art if such formulations and methods<br>
	were capable of stabilizing polypeptides to such an extent that the polypeptides could<br>
	be loaded into an implantable deiivery system at a high concentration and still exhibit<br>
	acceptable stability and therapeutic activity after exposure to temperatures up to or<br>
	exceeding physiological conditions over an extended period of time.<br>
10					SUMMARY OP THE INVENTION<br>
		[0006] The present invention includes solid-state polypeptide particles,<br>
	wherein the polypeptide contained within the particles is stabilized against degradation<br>
	at temperatures up to and exceeding physiological conditions. As they are used herein,<br>
	the term "physiological conditions" refers to environments having a temperature of<br>
15	about 37Â° C and the term "polypeptide" includes oligopeptides and proteins and<br>
	encompasses any natural or synthetic compound containing two or more amino acids<br>
	linked by the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of another. In each<br>
	embodiment, the polypeptide particles of the present invention incorporate a<br>
	polypeptide material that is stabilized against degradation by one or more stabilizing<br>
20	conditions. In particular, the polypeptide particles of the present invention are<br>
	formulated to stabilize the polypeptide contained therein by controlling one or more of<br>
	the following particle conditions: pH, sugar content, surfactant content, buffer content,<br>
	and metal ion concentration. Because the polypeptide particles of the present invention<br>
	can be formulated to combine the additive effects of two or more stabilizing conditions,<br>
25	where the polypeptide particles of the present invention include a stabilizing sugar, the<br>
	amount of stabilizing sugar needed to achieve acceptable polypeptide stability is<br>
	significantly reduced. In a preferred embodiment, the polypeptide particles of the<br>
	present invention are formulated to stabilize the polypeptide contained therein without<br>
	the use of a stabilizing sugar.<br><br><br><br><br>
3<br><br>
WO 2004/039392								PCT/US2003/034229<br>
		[0007] The present invention also includes aqueous stabilizing solutions. In<br>
	order to form the solid-state polypeptide particles of the present invention, an aqueous<br>
	stabilizing solution according to the present invention, which contains the polypeptide<br>
	to be stabilized, may be formed and subjected to a suitable particle formation process,<br>
5	such as a lyophilization or spray drying process. An aqueous stabilizing solution<br>
	according to the present invention, therefore, is formulated such that, upon subjecting<br>
	the aqueous stabilizing solution to a particle formation process, the aqueous stabilizing<br>
	solution yields solid-state polypeptide particles that contain polypeptide material<br>
	stabilized by one or more stabilizing conditions. By controlling the pH, sugar content,<br>
10	surfactant content, buffer content, metal ion concentration, or polypeptide concentration<br>
	of an aqueous stabilising solution according to the present invention, solid-state<br>
	polypeptide particles having a wide range of desired stabilization characteristics can be<br>
	produced.<br>
		[0008] The present invention further includes methods for producing<br>
15	stabilised, solid-state polypeptide particles. The method of the present invention<br>
	includes dissolving the polypeptide to be stabilised in an aqueous stabilizing solution of<br>
	the present invention and reconstituting the polypeptide in solid-state polypeptide<br>
	particles. The formulation of the solid-state peptide particles produced by the method<br>
	of the present invention will depend on the aqueous stabilizing solution used. In one<br>
20	embodiment, the method of the present invention includes dissolving a polypeptide to<br>
	be stabilized in an acidic stabilizing solution. In another embodiment, the method of<br>
	the present invention includes dissolving a polypeptide to be stabilized in an acidic<br>
	stabilizing solution in the presence of a stabilizing sugar, a metal ion, or both a<br>
	stabilizing sugar and a metal ion. In yet another embodiment, the method of the present<br>
25	invention includes dissolving a polypeptide to be stabilized in a buffered, near neutral<br>
	stabilizing solution in the presence of a surfactant, a stabilizing sugar, a metal ion, or<br>
	both a stabilizing sugar and a metal ion. In each embodiment of the method of the<br>
	present invention, the step of reconstituting solid-state peptide particles may be carried<br>
	out by subjecting the aqueous stabilizing solution to a suitable particle formation<br>
30	process, such as a lyophilization or spray drying process. Though the method of the<br>
	present invention may be varied to achieve particles having any one of a variety of<br>
	formulations, in each instance the method of the present invention is tailored to provide<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/039392								PCT/US2O03/034229<br>
	solid-state polypeptide particles, wherein the polypeptide is stabilized through one or<br>
	more stabilizing conditions.<br>
		[0009] The solid-state polypeptide particles of the present invention provide<br>
	excellent polypeptide stabilization, allowing recovery of up to 96% of the stabilized<br>
5	peptide after two months storage at 60Â° C. Moreover, the solid-stale polypeptide<br>
	particles of the present invention can be loaded into suspension formulations at<br>
	relatively high concentrations (i.e., 25% polypeptide particle or more), which facilitates<br>
	the formulation of suspensions having relatively higher concentrations of the stabilized<br>
	polypeptide. The solid-state polypeptide particles of the present invention, therefore,<br>
10	facilitate the loading of an acceptably- sized implant delivery system with a<br>
	concentration of stabilized, therapeutic polypeptide that is sufficiently high to enable<br>
	delivery of therapeutic doses of the stabilized, therapeutic polypeptide over an extended<br>
	period of time.<br>

15				DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
		[0027] In a first embodiment, the solid-state polypeptide particles of the<br>
	present invention include a polypeptide that is stable at acidic pH and are formulated to<br>
	exhibit an acidic reconstitution pH. The pH of the aqueous stabilizing solution prior to<br>
	particle formation (the "apparent pH") controls the pH exhibited by the subsequently<br>
20	formed particles (the "reconstitution pH") and defines the protonation state of the<br>
	polypeptide within the solid-stale polypeptide particles. For the purposes of the present<br>
	invention, particles exhibiting an acidic reconsitution pH include polypeptide particles<br>
	exhibiting a reconsttution pH below about pH 5, with particles exhibiting a<br>
	retconstitution pH below pH 4 being preferred and particles exhibiting a reconstitution<br>
25	pH ranging from about pH 2 to about pH 4 being particularly preferred. Controlling the<br>
	pH exhibited by the salid-state polypeptide particles of the present invention allows<br>
	control over the protonation state of the polypeptide included in the solid-state particles,<br>
	and it has been found that formulating the solid-state polypeptide particles of the<br>
	present invention at an acidic pH imparts a substantial stabilization effect. It is believed<br>
30	that formulating the solid-state polypeptide particles of the present invention at acidic<br>
	pH stabilizes the polypeptide because the acidic environment favors protonation of<br>
	amino groups included in the polypeptide. Often the amino groups included in a<br><br><br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/039392								PCT/US2003/034229<br><br>
	polypeptide are involved in the formation of reactive intermediates that are prone to<br>
	inter- or intra-molecular reactions that alter the chemical nature of the peptide and<br>
	function as a significant pathway of polypeptide degradation. By maintaining the<br>
	polypeptide in an environment that favors protonation of the amino groups included in<br>
5	the polypeptide, it is believed that the polypeptide particles according to the first<br>
	embodiment limit the involvement of amino groups in the formation of reactive<br>
	intermediates and, as a result, limit the degradation of the polypeptide resulting from<br>
	inter- or intra-molecular reactions.<br>
		[0028] The addition of metal ions to solid-state particles according to the<br>
10	first embodiment provides additive polypeptide stabilization. Where the solid-state<br>
	polypeptide particles according to the first embodiment are formulated to include metal<br>
	ions, the metal ions are preferably provided by a divalent metal salt, such, as, CaCl2,<br>
	MgCl2 or ZnCl2. The precise amount of metal ion included in a solid-state polypeptide<br>
	particle according to the first embodiment will depend on the particular peptide to be<br>
15	stabilised, the pH of the particle, and the presence or absence of a stabilizing sugar.<br>
	However, where a solid-state peptide particle according to the first embodiment<br>
	includes a metal ion, the particle is generally formulated such that the molar ratio of the<br>
	metal ion to stabilized polypeptide is between about 1/1 and 10/1, with a molar ratio<br>
	ranging from about 2/1 to about 6/1 being preferred, and a molar ratio of about 4/1<br>
20	being particularly preferred. The addition of metal ions, to the solid-state polypeptide<br>
	particles of the present invention reduces the amount of polypeptide dimerization over<br>
	time, and thereby imparts additive polypeptide stabilization. It is believed that the<br>
	metal ions work to reduce polypeptide dimerization through the formation of ionic<br>
	linkages or salt bridges with the polypeptide molecules, which ionic linkages or salt<br>
25	bridges limit the opportunity for interaction between polypeptide molecules.<br>
		[0029] The addition of a stabilizing sugar to solid-state peptide particles<br>
	according to the first embodiment also provides additive polypeptide stabilization. The<br>
	inclusion of a stabilizing sugar imparts additive polypeptide stabilization by limiting<br>
	polypeptide molecular mobility and reducing intermolecular interaction between<br>
30	polypeptide molecules. However, because the solid-state polypeptide particles of the<br>
	present invention can be formulated to stabilize the polypeptide via two or more<br><br><br>
8<br><br>
WO 2004/039392									PCT/US2003/034229<br>
	additive stabilizing conditions, where solid-state polypeptide particles according to the<br>
	present invention are formulated to include a stabilizing sugar, the amount of sugar<br>
	required to achieve an acceptable level of stability is significantly reduced. In<br>
	particular, where solid-state polypeptide particles according to the first embodiment are<br>
5	formulated to include a stabilizing sugar, the sugar is generally included in an amount<br>
	ranging from about 0.1/1 wt/wt to about 1/1 wt/wt relative to the polypeptide stabilized.<br>
	In preferred embodiments, solid-state polypeptide particles of the present invention<br>
	including a stabilizing sugar will include the stabilizing sugar in amounts ranging from<br>
	about 0.1/1 wt/wt to about 0.5/1 wt/wt or from about 0.1/1 wt/wt to about 0.25/1 wt/wt<br>
10	relative to the polypeptide stabilized. Where solid-state polypeptide particles according<br>
	to the first embodiment are formulated to include both a stabilizing sugar and metal<br>
	ions, the amounts of sugar and metal ions required to achieve a desired degree of<br>
	polypeptide stabilization may be reduced relative formulations that include stabilizing<br>
	sugar without metal ions or metal ions without stabilizing sugar. Such a potential<br>
15	advantage may be achieved due to the additive stabilizing effects of the sugar, the metal<br>
	ions, and acidic ecvironmental pH.<br>
		[0030] Though non-reducing sugars are generally useful as stabilizing<br>
	sugars in solid-state polypeptide particles according to the present invention, it has been<br>
	found that not all sugars are suitable for stabilization of a peptide particle according to<br>
20	the first embodiment Specifically, it has been found that sucrose, a sugar commonly<br>
	used in the stabilization of polypeptides, is not suitable for use under acidic conditions.<br>
	In fact, when sucrose is used under such conditions, it has been found to produce a<br>
	destabilizing effect. It is believed that such a destabilizing effect is generated becuase<br>
	sucrose itself is not chemically stable in an acidic environment. In particular, sucrose<br>
25	undergoes hydrolysis into glucose and fructose at acidic pH. Although, trehalose is a<br>
	disaccharide like sucrose, trehalose is chemically stable under acidic conditions and at<br>
	elevated temperatures, Methyi-mannopyranoside ("methyl-MP"), a monosaccharide, is<br>
	also chemically stable in an acidic environment. Moreover, both trehalose and methyl-<br>
	MP have been found to provide significant additive polypeptide stabilization when<br>
30	included in solid-state polypeptide particles formulated to exhibit an acidic pH.<br>
	Therefore, where solid-state polypeptide particles according to the first embodiment are<br>
	formulated to include a stabilizing sugar, the sugar included in the formulation must be<br><br>

WO 2004/039392								PCT/US2003/034229<br>
	stable under acidic conditions and is preferably stable under acidic conditions at<br>
	temperatures up to and exceeding physiological conditions.<br>
		[0031] Solid-state polypeptide particles according to the first embodiment<br>
	can be prepared from an aqueous stabilising solution. To prepare an aqueous<br>
5	stabilizing solution suitable for preparing solid-state polypeptide particles according to<br>
	the first embodiment, the polypeptide to be stabilized is dissolved in an acidic solution.<br>
	An acidic aqueous stabilizing solution may be achieved through the addition of a<br>
	suitable acid, such as HCl, in an amount that provides a solution having a desired pH.<br>
	The pH of an aqueous stabilizing solution according to the present invention plays a<br>
10	crucial role in stabilizing the polypeptide contained within the solid-state polypeptide<br>
	particles that are produced using the aqueous stabilizing solution. In order to achieve<br>
	solid-state polypeptide particles according to the first embodiment (i-e., having an<br>
	acidic reconstitution pH), it may be necessary to prepare the aqueous stabilizing<br>
	solution at an apparent pH that is significantly lower than the targeted reconstitution<br>
15	pH. An aqueous stabilizing solution suitable for preparing solid -state polypeptide<br>
	particles according to the first embodiment may also include a metal salt or stabilizing<br>
	sugar dissolved therein. The amount of metal salt or stabilizing sugar dissolved in an<br>
	aqueous stabilizing solution suitable for producing solid-state polypeptide particles<br>
	according to the first embodiment may vary. However, where the aqueous stabilizing<br>
20	solution is to be used to prepare solid-state polypeptide particles including a stabilizing<br>
	sugar, the aqueous stabilising solution will preferably include the desired stabilizing<br>
	sugar at an amount ranging from about 0.1/1 wt/wt to about 1/1 wt/wt relative to the<br>
	polypeptide to be stabilised. Moreover, where the aqueous stabilizing solution is to be<br>
	used to prepare solid-state polypeptide particles including a metal ion, the aqueous<br>
25	stabilizing solution is preferably prepared to include the desired metal ion at a molar<br>
	ratio of metal ion to polypeptide ranging from about 1/1 to about 10/1.<br>
		[0032] In order to form solid-state polypeptide particles according to the<br>
	first embodiment from an acidic aqueous stabilizing solution, the stabilizing solution is<br>
	subjected to a known particle formation process, For example, an aqueous stabilizing<br>
30	solution according to the present invention may be processed using a lyophilization or<br>
	spray drying process to achieve solid-state peptide particles. In a specific embodiment,<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2004/039392										PCT/US2l003/034229<br>
	solid-state polypeptide particles according to the present invention are prepared from an<br>
	aqueous stabilizing solution according to the present invention using a lyophilization<br>
	cycle that includes freezing stabilizing solution at 4Âº C for 30 minutes and at -50Âº C<br>
	for 3 hours (with a cooling rate of 2.5Â°C/min). After freezing the aqueous stabilizing<br>
5	solution as described, a primary drying cycle is conducted at a chamber pressure of 50<br>
	mT at -30ÂºC for 10 minutes and then at 0ÂºC for 10 hours. The primary drying cycle is<br>
	followed by a secondary drying cycle at a chamber pressure of 200 mT at 0ÂºC for 3<br>
	hours and then at 20 ÂºC for 12 hours and at 30ÂºC for 6 hours, with all temperature levels<br>
	ramped at 0.5ÂºC/min. However, the present invention is not limited to solid-state<br>
10	polypeptide particles produced by the precise lyophilization process described herein.<br>
	Several suitable lyophilization and spray drying processes are known in the art of<br>
	protein particle formation and may be applied to provide solid-state polypeptide<br>
	particles according to the present invention.<br>
		[0033] In a second embodiment, the solid-state polypeptide particles of the<br>
15	presesnt invention are formulated to exhibit a near neutral reconstitution pH. As it is<br>
	used herein, the term "near neutral" refers to a pH ranging from pH 5 to about pH 8.<br>
	Preferably, solid-state polypeptide particles according to the second embodiment are<br>
	formulated to exhibit a reconstitution pH of between about pH 5 and pH 7. Polypeptide<br>
	particles according to the second embodiment of the present invention include a buffer<br>
20	and further include a surfactant, a stabilizing sugar, a metal ion, or both a stabilizing<br>
	sugar and a metal ion. It has been found that formulating solid-state polypeptide<br>
	particles to exhibit near neutral reconstitution pH and to include buffering excipieuts<br>
	significantly stabilises the polypeptide material included in the solid-state particles. It<br>
	is believed that at near neutral pH a buffer may serve to stabilize the polypeptide<br>
25	included in solid-state particles through a counter ion effect. In particular, it is thought<br>
	that the buffer material may interact with or bind to one or more sites included in the<br>
	polypeptide that exhibit a tendency to react inter- or intra-molecularly in such a way<br>
	that such sites are no longer available to react<br>
		[0034] Buffers suitable for use in formulating solid-state polypeptide.<br>
30	particles according to the second embodiment are those that buffer at near neutral pH.<br>
	Specific examples of buffers that may be used in solid-state polypeptide particles<br><br><br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/039392								PCT/US2003/034229<br>
	according to the second embodiment include amino acid or peptide buffers, such as<br>
	histidine buffer {His-6) or histidine-glutamic acid (His-Glu) buffer, and inorganic<br>
	buffers, such as succinate and citrate buffers. Solid-state polypeptide particles<br>
	according to the second embodiment are generally formulated with up to about 20%<br>
5	buffer by weight, with polypeptide particles including up to about 15% buffer by weight<br>
	being preferred. However, the precise amount of buffer included in solid-state<br>
	polypeptide particles according to the second embodiment may vary according to the<br>
	amount and type of polypeptide included in the particles. Moreover, the amount and<br>
	type of buffer used to formulate solid-state polypeptide particles according to the<br>
10	second embodiment may also be adjusted order to achieve solid-state polypeptide<br>
	particles exhibiting a desired reconstitution pH.<br>
		[0035] By formulating solid-state particles according to the second<br>
	embodiment to include a stabilising sugar, a metal ion, or both a stabilizing sugar and a<br>
	metal ion, the stabilization of the polypeptide included in the particles increases beyond<br>
15	that achieved by simply formulating the polypeptide in a near neutral environment in<br>
	the presence of a buffer. Where solid-state polypeptide particles are formulated<br>
	according to the second embodiment and include a stabilizing sugar, a metal ion, or<br>
	both a stabilizing sugar and a metal ion, the amount of sugar and metal ion included in<br>
	the particles preferably falls within the ranges detailed in relation to the solid-state<br>
20	peptide particles of the first embodiment. In particular, if solid-state polypeptide<br>
	particles according to the second embodiment are formulated to include a stabilizing<br>
	sugar, the amount of stabilizing sugar included in the particles preferably ranges from<br>
	about 0.1/1 wt/wt to about 1/1 wt/wt relative to the polypeptide to be stabilized. Again,<br>
	non-reducing sugars are generally useful as stabilizing sugars in solid-state polypeptide<br>
25	particles according to the present invention, but because they are formulated at near<br>
	neutral pH, however, solid-state polypeptide particles according to the second<br>
	embodiment may incorporate stabilizing sugars, such as sucrose, that are not stable in<br>
	an acidic environment. Further, if solid-state polypeptide particles according to the<br>
	second embodiment are formulated to include a metal ion, the particles are preferably<br>
30	formulated to include the desired metal ion at a molar ratio of metal ion to polypeptide<br>
	ranging from about 1/1 to about 10/1. Where solid-state polypeptide particles<br>
	according to the second embodiment are formulated to include both a stabilizing sugar<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2004/039392								PCT/US2003/034229<br><br>
	and metal ions, the amounts of sugar and metal ions required to achieve a desired<br>
	degree of polypeptide stabilization may be reduced relative formulations that include<br>
	stabilizing sugar without metal ions or metal ions without stabilizing sugar. Such a<br>
	potential advantage may be achieved due to the additive stabilizing effects of the sugar,<br>
5	the metal ions, and buffer conditions at near neutral pH.<br>
		[0036] Where solid-state peptide particles according to the second<br>
	embodiment are formulated to include a surfactant, the surfactant used is preferably an<br>
	anionic surfactant, such as sodium dedocyl sulfate (SDS). The amount of surfactant<br>
	included in solid-state polypeptide particles according to the second embodiment may<br>
10	vary according to the amount and type of polypeptide to be stabilized as well as the<br>
	nature and amount of other excipients included in the particles, nevertheless, where<br>
	solid-state polypeptide particles according to the second embodiment are formulated<br>
	from an aqueous stabilising solution containing the desired surfactant in an amount<br>
	ranging from about 0.02 wt% up to about 0.2 wt%.<br>
15		[0037] Solid-state polypeptide particles according to the second<br>
	embodiment can be prepared from an aqueous stabilizing solution. To prepare an<br>
	aqueous stabilizing solution suitable for preparing solid-state polypeptide particles<br>
	according to the second embodiment, the polypeptide to be stabilized is dissolved in a<br>
	solution exhibiting a near neutral apparent pH and including a surfactant, a metal salt, a<br>
20	stabilizing sugar, or both a metal salt and a stabilizing sugar, as desired. A near neutral<br>
	stabilizing solution may be achieved through the addition of a suitable buffer, such as<br>
	those buffers already discussed, in an amount that provides a solution having a desired<br>
	apparent pH. As is true of aqueous stabilizing solutions used to prepare solid-state<br>
	polypeptide particles according to the first embodiment, the apparent pH of an aqueous<br>
25	stabilizing solution used to create solid-state polypeptide particles according to the<br>
	second embodiment controls the recocstitution pH of the solid-state polypeptide<br>
	particles produced using the aqueous stabilizing solution. Therefore, the amount and<br>
	type of buffer used in an aqueous stabilizing soluion for producing solid-state<br>
	polypeptide particles according to the second embodiment may be varied in order to<br>
30	achieve a desired apparent pH and a desired reconstitution pH. Moreover, in order to<br>
	achieve solid-state polypeptide particles that characterized by a buffer content within<br><br>
13<br><br>
WO 2004/039392									PCT/US2003/034229<br>
	the ranges described herein, the amount of buffer included in the aqueous stabilizing<br>
	solution will vary depending, upon, among other factors, the type of buffer used, the<br>
	precise amount of buffer desired in the solid-state particles, and the nature and amounts<br>
	of the polypeptide and other excipients to be included in the solid-state particles. For<br>
5	example, in the Examples that are detailed below, stabilizing solutions characterized by<br>
	a lOmM concentration of histidine buffer provided solid-state polypeptide particles<br>
	containing 14 wt% buffer material.<br>
		[0038] The amount of metal salt or stabilizing sugar dissolved in an aqueous<br>
	stabilizing solution suitable for producing solid-state polypeptide particles aaccording to<br>
10	the second embodiment may also vary depending on the amount and nature of the<br>
	polypeptide to be stabilized as well as the nature of the metal salt or stabilising sugar.<br>
	However, where an aqueous stabilizing solution for preparation of solid-state<br>
	polypeptide particles according to the second embodiment includes a stabilizing sugar,<br>
	the aqueous stabilizing solution will preferably include tbe desired stabilizing sugar at<br>
15	an amount falling within the ranges already described (i.e., irona about 0.1/1 wt/wt to<br>
	about 1/1 wt/wt relative to the polypeptide to be stabilised, with the ranges of from<br>
	about 0.1/1 wt/wt to about 0.5/1 wt/wt and from about 0.1/1 wt/wt and 0.25/1 wt/wt<br>
	being preferred). Moreover, where an aqueous stabilizing solution for preparation of<br>
	solid-state polypeptide particles according to the second embodiment includes a metal<br>
20	ion, the aqueous stabilizing solution is preferably prepared to include the desired metal<br>
	ion at a molar ratio of metal ion to polypeptide falling within the ranges already<br>
	described (i.e., a molar ratio of metal ion to polypeptide ranging from about 1/1 to<br>
	about 10/1, with the range of about 2/1 to about 6/1 being preferred and a molar ratio of<br>
	about 4/1 being particularly preferred).<br>
25		[0039] In order to form solid-state polypeptide particles according to the<br>
	second embodiment from a near neutral aqueous stabilizing solution, the near neutral<br>
	stabilizing solution is subjected to a known particle formation process. As described in<br>
	relation to the formation of particles according to the first embodiment, solid particles<br>
	according to the second embodiment may be formed from an appropriately formulated<br>
30	aqueous stabilizing solution using a lyophilization or spray drying process. For<br>
	example, the lyophilizataou process described herein is suitable for providing solid-state<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2004/039392									PCT/US2003/034229<br>
	polypeptide particles according to the second embodiment from an aqueous stabilizing<br>
	solution. Again, however, the present invention is not limited to the use of the<br>
	particular lyophilization process detailed. Particle formation through lyophilization and<br>
	spray drying processes is well known in the art and any suitable lyophilization or spray<br>
5	drying process may be applied to the aqueous stabilizing solutions of the present<br>
	invention to provide solid-state polypeptide particles according to the present invention.<br>
		[0040] The solid-state polypeptide particles, the aqueous stabilizing<br>
	solutions, and the methods of the present invention are particularly well suited to the<br>
	stabilization of peptides belonging to the superfamily of peptides including Pituitary<br>
10	Adenylate Cyclase Polypeptide ("PACAP") and glucagon. In humans, the<br>
	PACAP/glucagon superfamily of peptides includes at least nine different types of<br>
	bioactive peptides PACAP-27; PACAP-38; glucagon; glucagon-like peptides, such as<br>
	GLP-l and GLP-2; growth hormone releasing factor ("GRF"); vasoactive intestinal<br>
	polypeptide ("VIP"); peptide histidine methionine ("PHM"); secretin; and glucose-<br>
15	dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ("GIP"). Eight of these nine different types of<br>
	bioactive peptides are found in the brain and are classified as neuropeptides. In<br>
	addition many members of the PACAP/glucagon superfamily are present in the<br>
	gastrointestinal, pancreatic and gonadal organs {See, The origin and function of the<br>
	pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)/glucagon superfamify,<br>
20	Endocrine Reviews, 21 (6):619-670). The peptides included in the PACAP/glucagon<br>
	superfamily are related in structure by their N-Terminal amino acids, and the genes and<br>
	precursor molecules used in the cellular production of the various different peptides<br>
	included in the PACAP/glucagon superfamily are similar in structure.<br>
		[0041] Of particular interest is a synthetic PACAP-R3 agonist analog ("the<br>
25	PACAP analog") manufactured by Bayer Corporation ("Bayer"). This synthetic peptide<br>
	is defined by the following 31 amino acid sequence: HSDAVFTDNY TRLRKQVAAK<br>
	KYLQSIKRY. Bayer engineered the PACAP analog for potency and selectivity to<br>
	the R3 receptor in tbe pancreas. To improve stability of the PACAP analog, the<br>
	original methionine at position 17 was replaced with a valine and the asparagine<br>
30	originally located at position 24 was replaced with a glutamine. The PACAP analog is<br>
	useful in treating Type II Diabetes, and it would be desirable to deliver the PACAP<br><br><br>
15<br><br>
WO 2004/039392									PCT/US2003/034229<br>
	analog from an implantable drug delivery system capable of delivering the PACAP<br>
	analog to a subject (humans) at therapeutic doses over a period of at least three months,<br>
	and preferably at least 6 months. However, whether it is maintained in a solid state or<br>
	dissolved in aqueous or organic solvent solutions, unprotected PACAP analog is<br>
5	unstable at temperatures that approach or exceed physiological conditions. Therefore,<br>
	in order to load the PACAP analog in a suspension suitable for delivery from an<br>
	implantable, extended release delivery systems, the solid-state PACAP analog particles<br>
	must be stabilised against the degradation that would otherwise result from extended<br>
	exposure to temperatures that approximate or exceed physiological conditions.<br>
10		[0042] As solid-state PACAP analog is exposed to temperatures<br>
	approximating or exceeding physiological conditions, the most significant source of<br>
	degradation has been determined to be aggregate formation. In particular, using<br>
	lyophiized PACAP analog, it was detennined that the major degradation products for<br>
	unprotected, lyophilized PACAP analog are covalent dimers, dimer-OAc and PACAP-<br>
15	OAc adducts. Presently it is believed that the degradation of PACAP analog into such<br>
	aggregate products proceeds via reactive intra-molecular cyclic imide formation<br>
	followed by nucleophilic attack by acetate ions, by another molecule of PACAP analog,<br>
	or by both. Likely sites of modification for these proposed degradation paths are at the<br>
	Asp3 Ala4 and the Gln24Ser25 amino acids of the PACAP analog molecule. It has<br>
20	been further determined that N-terminal peptide bond cleavage also occurs to degrade<br>
	solid-state, unprotected PACAP analog. This proteolysis was found predominantly at<br>
	pH4 and presumably occurs via assisted intra-molecular ring closure of the Asp3<br>
	carboxyl side chain. However, as is detailed in the Examples that follow, various<br>
	embodiments of the solid-state polypeptide particles of the present invention are<br>
25	effective in stabilising PACAP analog against degradation, even when the particles are<br>
	maintained at temperatures of 40Â° C and 60Â° C over a period of months.<br>
		[0043] Though several different embodiments of the method of the solid-<br>
	state polypeptide particles of the present invention, provide effective stabilization of<br>
	PACAP analog, three embodiments provide superior stabilization. In one embodiment,<br>
30	solid-stale PACAP analog particles are lyophilized from a stabilizing solution<br>
	exhibiting an apparent pH of 2. The solvent for the stabilizing solution is formed using<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2004/039392								PCT/US2003/034229<br><br>
	H2O having the pH adjusted to the desired value using diluted HCL. The solid-state<br>
	PACAP analog particles according to this embodiment allow 92% recovery of the<br>
	initial PACAP analog and permit only 1.1% dimer formation after two months of<br>
	storage at 60Â° C. Figure 9 presents the two-month stability results, which demonstrate<br>
5	the greatly improved stability of solid-state PACAP particles prepared from a<br>
	stabilizing solution having an apparent pH of 2.<br>
		[0044] In a second eambodiment, the solid- state polypeptide particles are<br>
	formulated at acidic pH and include trehalose and PACAP analog at a 0.55/1 w/w ratio<br>
	(trehalose/PACAP analog). These particles allow 96% recovery of the initial PACAP<br>
10	analog and allow only 0.7% dimer formation, even after two months of storage at 60Â°<br>
	C. To formulate solid-state PACAP analog particles characterized by an acidic pH and<br>
	including frehalose and PACAP analog at a 0.55/1 w/w ratio, an acidic aqueous<br>
	stabilizing solution may be used. Such a stabilizing solution can be prepared using a<br>
	suitable acid, such as diluted HCL. The pH of such a solution (the apparent pH) is<br>
15	preferably adjusted to a pH of about 2 and the trehalose aud PACAP analog are<br>
	dissolved in the solution at the desired 0.55/1 w/w ratio. The prepared solution may<br>
	then subjected to a lyophilization or spray drying process 10 provide the desired solid-<br>
	stale PACAP analog particles.<br>
		[0045] In a third embodiment, the solid state polypeptide particles are again<br>
20	formulated at acidic pH and include PACAP analog and Ca2+ ions at a 4/1 molar ratio<br>
	(Ca2+/PACAP analog). After two months of storage at 60Â° C, particles formed<br>
	according to this formulation provide 95% recovery of the initial PACAP analog and<br>
	allow only 0.8% dimer formation. To formulate solid-state PACAP analog particles<br>
	characterized by an acidic pH and including Ca2+ and PACAP analog at a 4/1 molar<br>
25	ratio, an acidic aqueous stabilizing solution may be prepared. Again, such a solution<br>
	may be prepared using a suitable acid, such as diluted HCL, and the pH of the solution is<br>
	preferably adjusted to a of about pH 2. The appropriate amount of Ca2+ ions and<br>
	PACAP analog may be provided in solution by dissolving amounts of CaCl2 and<br>
	PACAP that result in a solution having a molar ratio of Ca2+ to PACAP analog of 4/1.<br>
30	The prepared stabilizing solution may then be Subjected to a lyophilization or spray<br>
	drying process to provide the desired solid-state PACAP analog particles.<br><br>
17<br><br>
WO 2004/039392									PCT/US2003/034229<br><br>
		[0046] Though the stability of the PACAP analog contained within the<br>
	particles described herein has been evaluated for a maximum period of two months at a<br>
	maximum temperature of 60Â° C, the findings provided by such evaluations and a<br>
	comparison of degradation kinetics at 40Âº C indicate that the method of the present<br>
5	invention is suitable for providing solid-state PACAP analog particles that are<br>
	stabilized against degradation well beyond two months at temperatures that<br>
	approximate physiologic temperature (i.e., 40Âº C). Specifically, it has been found that<br>
	the total rate of degradation of PACAP analog contained within particles is<br>
	approximately five times higher at 60Â° C than at 40Â° C. Moreover, the rate of<br>
10	aggregation or dimerization within the solid-state PACAP particles produced according<br>
	to the present invention is ten times higher at 60Â° C than at 40ÂºC. Therefore, where<br>
	solid-state PACAP analog particles produced by the method of the present invention are<br>
	maintained at approximately 37Â° C, it is anticipated that the PACAP analog contained<br>
	within the particles will demonstrate acceptable stability for up to six months and likely<br>
15	longer.<br>
		[0047] Though, the Examples that follow are directed to the stabilization of<br>
	PACAP analog, the present invention is not so limited. For instance, the method of the<br>
	present invention may be used to provide stabilized, solid-state particles of other<br>
	members of the PACAP/glucagon superfamily, particularly those family members, such<br>
20	as human VIP and human growth hormone releasing factor, which that have<br>
	substantially homologous amino acid sequences. However, the method of the present<br>
	invention is also not limited to stabilization of members of the PACAP/glucagon<br>
	superfamily. The solid-state polypeptide particles, aqueous stabilizing solutions, and<br>
	methods of the present invention may be useful for stabilizing any polypeptide that<br>
25	exhibits degradation due to proteolysis or aggregate formation or has primary structures<br>
	prone to degradation pathways, such as those observed for PACAP.<br>
							EXAMPLE 1<br>
		[0048] Due to the nature of the suspension vehicles used in implantable<br>
	drug delivery systems, mixing of the suspension formulation bulk and subsequent<br>
30	loading of the suspension formulation into the implantable systems are often conducted<br>
	at elevated temperatures. To evaluate the stability of PACAP analog (or simply<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2004/039392								PCT/US2003/034229<br>
	"PACAP") suspended in various suspension vehicles at elevated temperatures,<br>
	unprotected, lyophilized PACAP was suspended in four different suspension vehicles<br>
	(LI/GML/PVP, BA/PVP, EHI/PVP, and PEG/PVP). To suspend the PACAP into the<br>
	suspension vehicles 3.3 mg PACAP acetate was manually mixed into each of the<br>
5	different suspensions to achieve a PACAP content of approximately 3%. The stability<br>
	of the PACAP suspension formulations was then evaluated after incubation at 65Â° C for<br>
	four hours. The stability of the prepared PACAP suspensions was evaluated by RP-<br>
	HPLC and SEC, and as can be seen by reference to table 1, the results showed that<br>
	PACAP was stable throughout the four hour incubation period and, therefore, should<br>
10	survive the temperature conditions typically associated with the suspension formulation<br>
	manufacturing processes.<br>
		[0049] The PACAP suspensions were then further incubated at 37Â° C and<br>
	65Â° C an additional 17 days. After the additional 17-day incubation period, a marginal<br>
	15 stability loss was observed in the suspensions incubated at 37ÂºC (Table 2), while a<br>
	relatively more aggressive degradation was observed in the suspensions incubated at<br>
	65 Â°C (Table 3). The results revealed covalently linked aggregation as the major<br>
	degradation pathway in the evaluated PACAP suspensions. The fact that aggregation<br>
	occurred with and without the presence of vehicle suggests that the suspension vehicle<br>
20	was not responsible for the resultant self-association. In addition other chemical<br>
	degradation contributed to the loss of lyophilized PACAP.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
25		[0050] The preliminary findings from the processing study led to the<br>
	evaluation of the stabilization effect of sugar (sucrose) and non-ionic surfactant (Tween<br>
	80) on PACAP lyophiles and suspensions. In order to carry out tbe evaluation, samples<br>
	were prepared with PACAP in 10 mM NH4OAc (pH6.4) at 3 levels of Tween 80 (0,<br>
	0.05, 0.2wt%) and sucrose (0,0.5/1,1/1, w/w). A solution of PACAP in 10 mM of<br>
30	histidine (pH 6.4) and sodium succinate (pH 5.6) was also prepared. Each of the<br>
	PACAP solutions were lyophilized to obtain reconstituted, solid-state PACAP particles,<br>
	and individual vials were provided 3.3 mg samples of the material reconstituted from<br>
	each of the solutions, with the samples containing (1) no additive, (2) 0.2wt% Tween<br><br>
19<br><br>
WO 2004/039392								PCT/US2003/034229<br>
	80, (3) 0.2%wt Tween 80+0-5:1, w/w sucrose, and (4) 1:1, w/w sucrose. The various<br>
	3.3 mg samples were manually mixed with LL/GMI/PVP and BA/PVP to provide<br>
	suspension formulations having about 3% PACAP content, and the suspension<br>
	formulations were subjected to 4 hours of incubation at 65 Â°C. After the initial<br>
5	incubation period, the various suspension formulations were stored as described below<br>
	and evaluated by RP-HPLC and SEC.<br><br>
		[0051] Figure 1 shows that sucrose suppressed PACAP aggregation while<br>
	the presence of Tween 80 had no added effect. The overall stability, assessed by<br>
10	percent PACAP remaining, also increased accordingly. The extent of PACAP<br>
	aggregation was shown to be a function of storage temperature (Figure 2). Lyophilized<br>
	PACAP without a stabilizer was stable for at least 3 months at 4ÂºC and aggregated<br>
	substantially more rapidly at 60ÂºC compared to 40ÂºC. This study demonstrated that<br>
	sucrose stabilized lyophilized PACAP both at the physiological (40Â°C) and accelerated<br>
15	(60ÂºC) temperatures.<br>
		[0052] Figures 3 and 4 show a linear increase of PACAP aggregate<br>
	formation over 3 months at 40 and 60Â°C, respectively, for the lyophilized formulations<br>
	prepared with various different excipieats. Histidine and sodium succinite proved to be<br>
	better stabilizers than ammonium acetate. Except in the samples containing 1:1 w/w<br>
20	sucrose, the rate of aggregation aÂ± 60Â° C was approximately 10 times faster than that<br>
	observed at 40Â° C, and the rate of total degradation was about 5 times faster at 60Â°C<br>
	than that observed at 40Â°C (Table 4). These results indicate that high sucrose content<br>
	increased thermal stability by decreasing overall molecular mobility and protein-protein<br>
	interaction.<br>
25		[0053] The total degradation, on the other hand, followed a less linear<br>
	relationship over a 3-month period of time (Figure 5). This experiment demonstrated<br>
	that lyophilized PACAP (prepared at an apparent pH of 6.4 in ammonium acetate)<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2OO4/039392									PCT/US2003/034229<br>
	containing an equal amount of sucrose (w/w) resulted in the best (but not acceptable)<br>
	stability, with an estimated 8.4% the total degradation in 6 months at 40ÂºC.<br>
		[0054] In addition, this experiment showed that sucrose suppressed<br>
	aggregate formation for PACAP suspensions in BA/PVP and LL/GML/PVP (Figures 6<br>
5	and 7) similarly to lyophilized PACAP formulations alone. The stabilization effect of<br>
	sucrose in respect to aggregate formation appeared to be reduced in the BA/PVP<br>
	suspension. Also a higher amount of sucrose was needed for a similar longer-term<br>
	stability of PACAP in BA/PVP (Figure 8).<br>
		[0055] In order to characterize the degradation products and elucidate the<br>
10	degradation paths, the reconstituted stability sample (lyophilized PACAP stoned at<br>
	60ÂºC for 24 days) was analyzed by electrospray-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and<br>
	the degradation products were identified using an RP-HPLC process.<br>
		[0056] A molecular weight (MW) of 3743 amu was assigned to the intact<br>
	PACAP. Based on the KP-HPLC analysis, the major degradation products were<br>
15	identified to be covalent dimer and dimer-OAc adducts. Sigificantly, a cluster of<br>
	peaks, which elute after the main peak but prior to the elution of the dimer peaks, all<br>
	have a mass is to that for PACAP-OAc adduct (i.e., 3785 amu,). The<br>
	combined results from the RP-HPLC and the electrospray-time-of-flight mass<br>
	spectrometry -analyses suggest that both degradations were rendered through same<br>
20	reactive internediate(s), Based on this analysis, the potential degradation, mechanism<br>
	can be postulated as follows:<br>
		Scheme 1; Hypothesized Mechanism<br><br>
25<br>
		[0057] It can be hypothesized that the degradation proceeds by a two-step<br>
	mechanism via the rate-limiting cyclic imide intermediate formation followed by a<br>
	nucleophilic addition of an acetate ion, another PACAP molecule, or both. Since the<br><br>
21<br><br>
WO 2004/039392								PCT/US2003/034229<br>
	water content was low for all samples (
	addition of water was not predominant.<br>
		EXAMPIE3<br>
5		[0058] Solid-state P ACAP paricles were prepared via a lyophilization<br>
	process (FTS Duro stop) from three different polypeptide solutions prepared in<br>
	NH4OAc buffer at pH6. Each of the three different solutions contained a different<br>
	amount of sucrose with the first containing no sucrose, the second containing a weight<br>
	ratio of sucrose to PACAP of 0.5/1, and the third containing a weight ratio of sucrose to<br>
10	PACAP 1/1. Solid-state PACAP particles prepared from each of the three solutions<br>
	were stored at control temperature ranging from 2Â° C to 8Âº C, a temperature<br>
	approximating physiologic temperature (40Â° C), and a temperature exceeding<br>
	physiologic temperature (60Â° C). The stability of the PACAP contained within each<br>
	group of solid-state PACAP particles was assessed at 24 days and 3 months. To assess<br>
15	PACAP stability within each group of particles, the particles were reconstituted in<br>
	water and analyzed by reversed-phase RP-HPLC (acelonitrile gradient elution with<br>
	mobile phase containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and a UV detection at 214 nm) and<br>
	size exclusion HPLX (SEC, isocreatic elution, 30% acetonitrile mixed wife 70% of<br>
	aqueous solution containing 0,1% trifluoroacetic acid and 200 mM of sodium chloride,<br>
20	and a UV detection at 220 run).<br>
		[0059] The rate of aggregation (assessed by SEC) was found to bo 10 times<br>
	higher at 60Â° C than at 40Â° C for all formulations tested (Table 5). Except in solid- state<br>
	PACAP particles prepared with a PACAP to sucrose weight ratio of 1/1, the rate of<br>
	total degradation (assessed by RP HPLC) observed in the various solid-state PACAP<br>
25	particles was about 5 times faster at 60Â° C that at 40Â° C.<br>
		EXAMPLE 4<br>
		[0060] The effect of pH on the stability of PACAP molecules over time was<br>
	evaluated. In order to make such an evaluation, PACAP raw material was first<br>
	dissolved in H2O in three different solutions, with the first solution having a pH of 2,<br>
30	the second solution having a pH of 4, and the third solution having a pH of 6. The pH<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2004/039392								PCT/US2003/034229<br><br>
	of each solution was adjusted to the desired value using diluted HCL. Each of the three<br>
	solutions was placed in lyophinzation vials, and solid-state PACAP particles were<br>
	produced from each of the three solutions through the lyophilization process already<br>
	described herein. Particles from each of the three solutions were then stored for two<br>
5	months at 60Âº C, and the stability of the PACAP included in the solid-state particles<br>
	was thereafter evaluated using RP-HPLC and SEC. Figure 9 presents the two-month<br>
	stability results, which demonstrate the greatly improved stability of solid-state PACAP<br>
	particles prepared at acidic pH.<br>
10		EXAMPLE 5<br>
		[0061] The stability of PACAP included in solid-state PACAP particles<br>
	prepared at varying pH with an amount of potentially stabilizing sugar was evaluated.<br>
	In each imtance the solid-state PACAP particles consisted of a 7.3 molar equivalent of<br>
15	one of three different sugars sucrose; trehalose; and methyl mannopyranoside (all from<br>
	Sigma). The solid-state PACAP particles evaluated were prepared from eight different<br>
	aqueous solutions. The first two aqueous solutions were prepared by dissolving<br>
	PACAP into a first solution having a pH adjusted to 2 and a second solution having a<br>
	pH adjusted to 6 (as before the pH of the various solutions described in this Example<br>
20	was adjusted using diluted HCl). The third and fourth aqueous solutions were prepared<br>
	by dissolving both PACAP and methyl-MP into a solution having a pH adjusted to 2<br>
	and into a solution having a pH adjusted to 6. The fifth and sixth aqueous solutions<br>
	were prepared by dissolving both PACAP amd trehalose into a solution havhig a pH<br>
	adjusted to 2 and into a solution having a pH adjusted to 6. And the seventh and eighth<br>
25	aqueous solutions were prepared by dissolving both PACAP and sucrose into a solution<br>
	having a pH adjusted to 2 and into a solution having a pH adjusted to 6.<br>
		[0062] Solid-state PACAP particles were prepared from each of the eight<br>
	solutions through lyphilization, as has already been described, and solid-state PACAP<br>
	particles produced from each of the eight solutions were then stored at 60Â° C for two<br>
30	months, After exposing the various solid-state PACAP particles to 60Âº C over two<br>
	months, the stability of the PACAP included in various particles was evaluated using<br>
	RP HPLC and SEC processes.<br><br>
23<br><br>
WO 2004/039392								PCT/US/2003/034229<br>
		[0063] The HPLC analyses indicated all three sugars investigated showed<br>
	improved stability when included in PACAP particles prepared at pH 6. In particular,<br>
	at pH 6, sucrose provided roughly a 6-fold improvement in preventing aggregate<br>
	formation and trehalose provided roughly a 4-fold improvement in the same measure.<br>
5	Moreover, both trehalose and methyl MP provided additive stability to the PACAP<br>
	included in particles prepared at pH2 (Table 6) relative to PACAP particles prepared at<br>
	pH 2 without the addition of a stabilizing sugar. However, when included in PACAP<br>
	particles prepared at pH 2, sucrose exhibited a significant destabilizing effect. The<br>
	destabilization effect of sucrose for PACAP prepared at pH2 was believed to be a result<br>
10	of sucrose decomposition during the process of producing the PACAP particles from a<br>
	solution having an acidic pH.<br>
		EXAMPLE 6<br>
		[0064] PACAP particles containing histidine buffer (Sigma) and PACAP<br>
15	particles containing histidine buffer in combination with calcium chloride (CaCl2, JT<br>
	Baker), sucrose and sodium dedocyl sulfate (SDS, Pierce) were prepared and the<br>
	stabilization of PACAP provided by such particles was evaluated. To prepare the<br>
	PACAP particles evaluated, six different aqueous solutions were prepared. Each<br>
	solution included a desired amount of PACAP dissolved therein, and the pH of each of<br>
20	the six solutions prepared was adjusted to 6 by the addition of diluted HCL The first<br>
	aqueous was prepared without additives (histidine buffer, CaCl2, sucrose, or SDS). The<br>
	second aqueous solution was prepared with a 10 mM concentration of histidine buffer.<br>
	The third aqueous solution was formulated with a 10 mM concentration of histidine<br>
	buffer as well as a 10 mM concentration of CaCl2. The fourth aqueous solution was<br>
25	formulated with a 10 mM concentration of histidine buffer and included sucrose at a<br>
	0.5/1 weight ratio (sucrose/PACAP) relative to PACAP. The fifth aqueous solution<br>
	was prepared with a 10 mM concentration of histidine buffer, a 10 mM concentration of<br>
	CaCl2, and an amount of sucrose providing a 0.5/1 weight ratio (sucrose/PACAP)<br>
	relative to PACAP. The sixth aqueous solution was formulated with a 10 mM<br>
30	concentration of histidine buffer and 0.02 wt% SDS. Solid-state PACAP particles were<br>
	then produced from each of the six solutions using the lycphilization process already<br>
	described herein. The PACAP particles produced from each solution were then stored<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2004/039392									PCT/US2003/034229<br>
	at 60Â° C for two months, and the stability of the PACAP contained within the various<br>
	different particles was evaluated using RP-HPLC and SEC processes after such storage.<br>
	As can be seen in Table. 7, the presence of hitidine buffer greatly suppresses PACAP<br>
	aggregate formation (a roughly 6-fold decrease in aggregate formation). In addition,<br>
5	sucrose, CaCl2 and SDS further stabilized the peptide, providing roughly 14 fold to 20<br>
	fold decreases in aggregate formation.<br>
		EXAMPLE 7<br>
10		[0065] To evaluate the stabilizing effect of CaCl2 in PACAP particles<br>
	prepared at acidic and near neutral pH, four different types of particles were formulated,<br>
	stored at 60Âº C for two months, and then analyzed for PACAP degradation. The four<br>
	difierent particle formulations were prepared from four different aqueous solutions.<br>
	Each of the four solutions included a desired amount of PACAP dissolved therein, and<br>
15	the pH of each solution was adjusted to the desired level using diluted HCl.The first<br>
	aqueous solution was formulated without additives (histidine or CaCl2), and the pH of<br>
	the first solution was adjusted to 2. Tht second aqueous solutioin was formulated with a<br>
	10 mM concentration of CaCl2, and the pH of the second solution was adjusted to 2.<br>
	The third aqueous solution was formulated with a 10 mM concentration of histidine<br>
20	buffer, and the fourth aqueous solution was formulated with a 10 mM concentration of<br>
	histidine buffer as well as a 10 mM concentration of CaCl2, Solid-state PACAP<br>
	particles were prepared from each of the four aqueous solutions (the composition of<br>
	each of the different particles is outlined in Table 8) using the lyophilization process<br>
	already described, and PACAP particles produced from each of the four solutions were<br>
25	stored at 60Âº C for two months. After storage of the particles at 60Â° C for two months,<br>
	the stability of PACAP included in particles was evaluated using RP-HPLC and SEC<br>
	processes. As can be seen in Table 8, the results of such evaluation demonstrated that<br>
	CaCl2 further improved the stability of PACAP particles at both pH 2 and 6 (Table 8).<br>
