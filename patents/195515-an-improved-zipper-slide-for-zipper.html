DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Fig. 1 shows a zipper slide for zipper according to the prior art. This structure of zipper slide 1 comprises a slide base 10, a swivel hook plate 11, a spring 12, and a pull tab 13. The hook plate 11 has a middle part pivoted to the slide base 10 by a rivet 111. The pull tab 13 is coupled to one end of the hook plate 11. The spring 12 is mounted in the slide base 10 and connected between a part of the slide base 10 and the one end of the hook plate 11. This structure of the zipper<br>
slide 10 is functional. However, because the hook plate 11 is<br>
- 4-<br><br>
pivotally connected to the slide base 10 by the rivet 111, the assembly of the zipper slide consumes much labour and, cannot be achieved by a fully automatic machine.<br>
Referring to FIGS, from 2 through 4? an improved zipper slide 70 for zipper in accordance with the present invention is shown comprising a slide base 20, a hook plate 30, a spring element 40, a locating plate 50, and a pull tab 60. An automatic machine to save labour cost assembles the zipper slide 70.<br>
The slide base 20 is made of metallic material, for example, aluminum alloy or zinc alloy, comprising two parallel guide ways 21, which receive the respective zipper tapes (not shown) and have a respective rear part disposed in communication with each other, and a longitudinally extended upright partition block 22, which separates the guide ways 21. The upright partition block 22 comprises a recessed receiving chamber 23, which receives the hook plate 30.<br>
Referring to FIGS. From 2 through 4 again, the recessed receiving chamber 23 of the partition block 22 comprises a hook hole 24, a first receiving space 25, a second receiving space 26 disposed below the hook hole 24, and a retaining portion 27.<br>
The hook plate 30 is made of metallic material, for example, aluminum ally or zinc alloy, comprising a hooked tip 31 extended from one end thereof and inserted and inserted through the hook hole 24 into the second receiving space 26 of the recessed receiving chamber 23 of the partition block 22 of the slide base 20, a bottom but 32 supported in the first receiving space 25 of the recessed receiving chamber 23 of the partition block 22 of the slide base 20<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
(see FIG. 4), a bearing portion 33 extended from an opposite end thereof and stopped against a part of the peripheral wall of the first receiving space 25 of the recessed receiving chamber 23 of the partition block 22 of the slide base 20, and a top face 33 adapted to support the spring element 40.<br>
The pull tab 60 is made of metallic material, for example, aluminum alloy or zinc alloy, having a knuckle 63 at its one end to which a coupling ring 62 is pivoted for coupling the pull tab 60 to the hooked tip 31 of the hook plate 30. The coupling ring 62 defines a hole 61 through which the hooked tip 31 of the hook plate 30 passes. As indicated in FIG. 3, the coupling ring 62 couples the pull tab 60 to the hook plate 30. Further, the pull tab 60 can be marked with a trademark or logo.<br>
The spring element 40 may be variously shaped. According the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the spring element 40 is a flat spring plate. Alternatively, the spring element 40 can be a curved clamping plate or U-shaped spring plate. When installed, the spring element 40 has one end fixedly connected to the retaining portion 27 of the recessed receiving chamber 23 of the partition block 22, and the other end pressed on the top face 33 of the hook plate 30 to hold the hook plate 30 in position, keeping the hooked tip 31 of the hook plate 30 hooked in the hook hole 24 of the slide base 20 (see FIG. 4).<br>
The locating plate 50 is made of metallic material, for example, aluminum alloy or zinc alloy, and fixedly fastened to the recessed receiving chamber 23 of the partition block 22 of the slide base 20 at a top side. The locating plate 50, the slide base 20, the spring element 40 and the hook plate 30 are fixedly fastened together by stamping<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
(see FIG. 3).<br>
Referring to FIGS. From 5 through 7, when pulling the pull tab 60 forwards, the bearing portion 33 is forced against the peripheral wall of the first receiving space 25 of the recessed receiving chamber 23 of the partition 22 of the slide base 20, the top face 34 of the hook plate 30 is stopped against one end of the locating plate 50, and the hooked tip 31 of the hook plate 30 is hooked in the hook hole 24, and therefore the slide base 20 is positively moved with the pull tab 60 relative to the zipper tapes being received in the guide ways 21. When stopped from pulling the pull tab 60, the spring power of the spring element 40 forces the hook plate 30 downwards, thereby causing the hooked tip 31 of the hook plate 30 to be engaged into the second receiving space 26 of the recessed receiving chamber 23 of the partition block 22 of the slide base 20 again.<br>
According to the present invention, the slide base 20, the hook plate 30 and the spring element 40 are fastened together by stamping. Because the assembly process of the zipper slide 70 eliminates manual riveting, the manufacturing cost of the zipper slide 70 is low.<br>
A prototype of zipper slide for  zipper has been constructed with the features of FIGS. 2-7. The zipper slide for invisible zipper functions smoothly to provide all of the features discussed earlier.<br>
Although a particular embodiment of the invention has been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited except as by the appended claims.<br>
