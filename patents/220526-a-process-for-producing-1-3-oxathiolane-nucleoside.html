				<td>A process for producing 1,3- oxathiolane nucleoside<br>
This application is in the area of methods for the manufacture of 1, 3-oxathiolane nucleosides and claims priority to U.S. provisional applications serial nos. 60/096,214, filed on August 12,1998 and 60/122,841 on March 3, 1999.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The success of various synthetic nucleosides such as AZT,D4T, DD1, and DDC in inhibiting the replication of HIV in vivo or in vitro led researchers in the late 1980's to design and test nucleosides that substitute a heteroatom for the carbon atom at the 3'-position of the nucleoside. Norbeck, et al., disclosed that (±)-l-[cis-(2,4)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-4- dioxolanyl]thymine (reffered to as (±)-dioxolane-T) exhibits a modest activity against HIV (ECso of 20uM in ATH8 cells), and is not toxic to uninfected control cells at a concentration of 200 uM. Tetrahedron Letters 30 (46), 6246, (1989). European Patent Application Publication No. 337713 and U.S. Patent No. 5,041,449, assigned to Biochem Pharma, Inc., disclose recemic 2-substituted-l,3-dioxolanes that exhibit antiviral activity. Published PCT application numbers PCT US91/09124 and PCT US93/08044 disclose isolated B-D-l,3-dioxolanyl nucleosides for the treatment of HIV infection. WO 94/09793 discloses the use of isolated B-D-1,3-dioxolanyl nucleosides for the treatment of HBV infection.<br>
Published PCT US 95/11464 discloses that (-)-(2S,4S)-l-(2-hybroxymethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-yl) cytosine is useful in the treatment of tumors and other abnormal cell proliferation.<br>
U.S. Patent No.5,047,407 and European Patent Application Publication No. 0382526, also assigned to Biochem Pharma, Inc., diclose that a number of racemic 2-substituted-5-substituted-1, 3-oxathiolane nucleosides have antiviral activity, and specifically report that racemic mixture of 2-hydroxymethyl-5-(cytosine-l-yl)-l, 3-oxathiolane (referred to below as BCH-189) has approximately the same activity against HIV as AZT, with less toxicity. The (-)-enantiomer of BCH-189(U.S. Patent No.5,539,116 to Liotta,et al), known as 3TC, is now solved commercially for the treatment of HIV in humans in the United States. See also EP 513 200 Bl.<br><br>
It has also been disclosed that cis-2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-l-yl)-l,3-oxathiolane ("FTC") has potent HIV activity. See Schinazi, et al., "Selective Inhibition of Human Immunodeficiency viruses by Racemates and Enantiomers of cis-5-Fluoro-l-[2-(Hydroxymethyl)-!,3-Oxathiolane-5-yl]Cytosine" Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, November 1992, page 2423-2431. See also U.S. Patent Nos. 5,814,639; 5,914,331; 5,210,085; U.S. Patent No. 5,204,466, WO 91/11186, and WO 92/14743.<br>
Because of the commercial importance of 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides, a number of processes for their production have been described in patents and scientific literature. Three key aspects of the synthesis must be considered during design of the process. First, the reaction scheme must provide an^fficient route to the 1,3-oxathiolane ring structure, preferably, with substituent groups in place for use in subsequent reactions. Second, the reaction scheme must provide an efficient means to condense the 1,3-oxathiolane ring with a suitably protected base, which, in trie case of 3TC is cytosine, and in the case of FTC is 5-fluorocytosine. 'Third, the reaction must be stereoselectiye, i.e., it must provide the enantiomer of choice. The substituents on the chiral carbons (the specified purine or pyrimidine base (referred to as the C5 substituent)) and CH2OH (referred to as the C2 substituent)) of the 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides can be either cis (on the same side) or trans (on opposite sides) with respect to the oxathiolane ring system. Both the cis and trans racemates consist of a pair of optical isomers. Hence, each compound has four individual optical isomers. The four optical isomers are represented by the following configurations (when orienting the oxathiolane moiety in a horizontal plane such that the -S-CHa- moiety is in back): (1) cis (also referred to as P), with both groups "up", which is the naturally occurring L-cis configuration (2) cis, with both groups "down", which is the non-naturally occurring p-cis configuration; (3) trans (also referred to is the a-configuration) with the C2 substituent "up" and the C5 substituent "down"; and (4) trans with the C2 substituent "down" and the C5 substituent "up". The two cis enantiomers together are referred to as a racemic mixture of p-enantiomers, and the two trans enantiomers are referred to as a racemic mixture of a-enantiomers. In general, it is fairly standard to be able to separate the pair of cis racemic optical isomers frorrthe pair of trans racemic optical isomers. It is a significantlyhore difficult challenge to separate or otherwise obtain the individual enantiomers of the cis-configuration. For 3TC and FTC, the desired stereochemical configuration is the p-L-isomer.<br>
Kraus, et al., ("Synthesis of New 2,5-Disubstituted 1,3-Oxathiolanes. Intermediates in Nucleoside Chemistry", Synthesis, pages 1046-1048 (1991)) describe the problems associated with the reaction of an aldehyde of a glyoxylate or glycolic acid with mercaptoacetic acid in toluene in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid. Kraus notes that a requirement for the success of this reaction is that glycolic derivatives which exist in the hydrate form have to be converted into the free aldehyde by azeotropic removal of water with toluene before the cyclocondensation. Thereafter, to complete the reduction of both the lactone and carboxylic acid functions, different catalytic reductive reagents had to be employed. Reduction with sodium borohydride failed, and borane-methyl sulfide complex (BMS) was able to reduce only the carboxylic acid function. When the temperature was raised, or a large excess of BMS was used, ring opening occurred leading to polymeric material. Reduction of the 2-carboxy-l,3-oxathiolan-5-one with sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride in toluene gave a mixture of products. Tributyl tin hydride gave no reduction. Finally, when the reduction was performed on the protected lactones, it was not possible to isolate the desired compound, regardless of the catalytic reductive conditions.<br>
Because of these difficulties, Kraus, et al. proposed a reaction that involved the cyclocondensation of anhydrous glyoxylates with 2-mercaptoacetaldehyde diethyl acetal at reflux in toluene to produce 5-ethoxy-1,3-oxathiolane derivatives which could be reduced with BMS to give the corresponding 2-hydroxymethyl- 1,3-oxathiolane in 50% yield, which after benzoylation provided a mixture of cis and trans 2-benzoyloxymethyl-5-ethoxy-1,3-oxathiolane.   This process is also described in U.S. Patent No. 5,047,407.<br>

In light of the importance of 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a process for the production of 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides which can be used on a manufacturing scale.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Processes for the preparation of 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides are provided that include efficient methods for the preparation of the 1,3-oxathiolane ring and subsequent condensation of the 1,3-oxathiolane with a pyrimidine or purine base. Using the processes described herein, the compound can be provided as an isolated enantiomer.<br>
It has been discovered that 2-[RlC(O)OCH2]-l,3-oxathiolanyl-5-one can be prepared in high yield by directly reacting an acetal of the formula (R!0)2CHR wherein R is -(CH2-O-C^R1), and R1 is alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocyclic, alkaryl, alkylheteroaryl, or alkylheterocyclic, or aralkyl, with mercaptoacetic acid in an organic solvent, for example acetonitrile, in the presence of a Lewis or protic acid in an organic solvent with a minimum amount of water. Alternatively, the aldehyde precursor (OK)2CHR or (R10)(OH)CHR can be used. The acetal can also be used as a mixture of the hemiacetal, the acetal monomer or higher condensation products thereof. By reacting the mercaptoacetic acid directly with the acetal, side products are decreased, which increases product purity and yield of this starting material. The acetal is conveniently produced, as an example, by reacting a diether alcohol with n-butyryl chloride.<br>
(R'O^CHR can be prepared by any appropriate route, and for example by either (i) reaction of a compound of the formula OH-CH2-OC-CH2-OH with RC(O)C1 to form RC(0)OCH2C(H)=C(H)OC(0)R, which is ozonized or otherwise cleaved to form the desired compound: or (ii) reduction of (R1O)2CHC(0)H to form (R10)2CHCH2OH, which is reacted with C1C(O)R to form the desired compound.<br>
In another alternative route, HC(O)CH20C(0)R* is reacted with mercaptoacetic acid to form the desired 1,3-oxathiolane ring. HC(0)CH20C(O)R' can be prepared by any appropriate route, and for example, by the methods A and B illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
The 5-(O protecting group)-2-protected hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolane or its 5-acetyloxy derivative can be condensed with a protected silylated pyrimidine or purine base, including cytosine or 5-fluorocytosine, using a Lewis acid such as tin chloride, (Cl)3Ti(isopropoxide), trimethylsilyl inflate, trimethylsilyl iodide, or other Lewis acid known to catalyze the condensation, including those Lewis acids described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,663,320; 5,864,164; 5,693,787; 5,696,254; 5,744,596; and 5,756,706 to provide the corresponding nucleoside with high ^-selectivity. It is surprising that (Cl)3li(isopropoxide) is useful as a catalyst for condensation of the 1,3-oxathiolane with the protected base, given that it has been reported that no coupling of the 1,3-oxathiolane with protected pyrimidine base occurs with HgCh, EtjAlCl, or TiChCO-isopropyl):.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, glycolic acid is substituted for mercaptoacetic acid in the presence of a Lewis acid to form the corresponding 1,3-dioxolane, which can be condensed with a purine or pyrimidine base to provide a 1,3-dioxolane nucleoside. It is preferred to conduct the cyclocondensation of an acetal (or aldehyde) with glycolic acid in the presence of a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride diethyl etherate rather than a protic acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid.<br>
It has also been discovered that a 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside can be produced by: (i) preparing a 5-halo-2-protected-oxymethyl- 1,3-oxathiolane; and (ii) reacting the 5-halo-2-protected-oxymethyl- 1,3-oxathiolane with a protected purine or pyrimidine base at low temperature, and preferably below 25 degrees Celcius, and more preferably below 10 degrees Celcius.  It was surprising that the condensation reaction can be carried out effectively without the aid of a Lewis add! In a preferred embodiment, the halogen in the 5-positioi, of the oxathiolane is a chloro substituent. The reaction typically produces a mixture of 0 and a anpmers that must be separated.. The B anomer typically is produced in excess over the a anomer. The separation of 6 and a anomers can be effected by any known method, including fractional crystallization, chromatography (achiral or chiral), or the preparation and separation of diastereomeric derivatives. In one embodiment, a racemic 5-acylated-2-protected-oxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolane is chlorinated at low temperature (e.g., 0 degrees Celcius), and then condensed with a protected base such as 5-fluorocytosine or cytosine, to<br>
produce a mixture of diastereomers (with the P compound typically in substantial excess). In another embodiment, a chiral 5-acylated-2-protected-oxymethyl-l,3-oxathiolane is chlorinated and then reacted with a protected base. Any 5-acylated-2-protected-oxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolane can be used that provides the desired product. Nonlimiting examples of appropriate acyl moieties include, but are not limited to acetate, propionate, butyrate, benzoate, p-methoxybenzoate, and p-(t-butyl)-benzoate.  The halogenaton reaction can be carried out in any useful organic solvent, including toluene, chloroform, acetic acid, tetrahydrofuran, ether, benzene, etc. The anomeric ratio of a to P produced in the condensation reaction can be affected by the solvent selected for use in the reaction. One can easily test various organic solvents to select that solvent which provides the optimal yield of the desired product.<br>

It has been discovered that 2-[R1C(0)OCH2O]-l,3-oxathiolanyl-5-one can be prepared in high yield by directly reacting an acetal of the formula (alkylO^CHR, wherein R is -(CH2-0-C(O)R'), and R1 is alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkaryl, alkheteroaryl or aralkyl, with<br>
mercaptoacetic acid in the presence of a Lewis or protic acid in an organic solvent with a minimum amount of water. The acetal can be used as a mixture of the hemiacetal, the acetal monomer or higher condensation products thereof. By reacting the mercaptoacetic acid directly with the acetal, side products are decreased, which increases product purity and yield of this starting material.<br>
The 5-(0 protecting group)-2-protected hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolane or its 5-acetyloxy derivative can be condensed with a protected silylated pyrimidine or purine base, including cytosine or 5-fluorocytosine, using a Lewis acid such as tin chloride, (Cl)3Ti(isopropoxide), trimethylsilyl triflate, trimethylsilyl iodide, or other Lewis acid known to catalyze the condensation, including those Lewis acids described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,663,320; 5,864,164; 5,693,787; 5,696,254; 5,744,596; and 5,756,706 to provide the corresponding nucleoside with high B-selectivity. It is surprising that (Cl)3Ti(isopropoxide) is useful as a catalyst for condensation of the 1,3-oxathiolane with the protected base, given that it has been reported that no coupling of the 1,3-oxathiolane with protected pyrimidine base occurs with HgCfc, EtzAlCl, or TiC^O-isopropyl)<br>
In an alternative embodiment, glycolic acid is substituted for mercaptoacetic acid to form the corresponding 1,3-dioxolane, which can be condensed with a purine or pyrimidine base to provide a 1,3-dioxolane nucleoside.  It is preferred to conduct the cyclocondensation of an acetal (or aldehyde) with glycolic acid in the presence of a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride diethyl etherate rather than a protic acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid.<br>
It has also been discovered that a 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside can be produced by: (i) preparing a 5-acylated-2-protected-oxymethyl- 1,3-oxathiolane and (ii) reacting the 5-halo-2-protected-oxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolane with a protected purine or pyrimidine base at low temperature, and preferably below 25 degrees Celcius, and more preferably below 10 degrees Celcius. It was surprising that the condensation reaction can be carried out effectively without the aid of a Lewis acid. In a preferred embodiment, the halogen hi the 5-position of the oxathiolane is a chloro substituent. The reaction typically produces a mixture of 8 and a anomers that must be separated.. The 6 anomer typically is produced in excess over the a snomer. The separation of B and a anomers can be effected by any known method, including fractional crystallization, chromatography (achiral or chiral), or the preparation and separation of diastereomeric derivatives. In one embodiment, a racemic 5-acylated-2-protected-oxymethy 1-1,3-oxathiolane «s chlorinated at low temperature (e.g., 0 degrees<br>
Celcius), and then condensed with a protected base such as 5-fluorocytosine or cytosine, to produce a mixture of diastereomers (with the P compound typically in substantial excess). In another embodiment, a chiral 5-acyIated-2-protected-oxymethyl-l,3-oxathiolane is chlorinated and then reacted with a protected base. Any 5-acylated-2-protected-oxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolane can be used that provides the desired product. Nonlimiting examples of appropriate acyl moieties include, but are not limited to acetate, propionate, butyrate, benzoate, p-methoxybenzoate, and p-(t-butyl)-benzoate. The halogenation reaction can be carried out in any useful organic solvent, including toluene, chloroform, acetic acid, tetrahydrofuran, ether, benzene, etc. The anomeric ratio of o to P produced in the condensation reaction can be affected by the solvent selected for use in the reaction. One can easily test various organic solvents to select that solvent which provides the optimal yield of the desired product.<br>
The selected 5-acylated-2-protected-oxymethyl-l,3-oxathiolane can be halogenated to a 5-chloro, 5-bromo, or 5-iodo derivative using known methods, for example,<br>

II.      Preparation of 13-Oxathiolane Lactone Ring<br>
Figure 1 illustrates one route for carrying out the disclosed process. 2-Butene-l,4-diol is reacted with a carboxylic acid chloride or other ester precursor to provide a 2-butene-l,4-diol diester. The selection of the carboxylic acid chloride or other ester precursor will be governed by the group desired at the 2-position of the resulting 1,3-oxathiolane ring. For example, if butyryl chloride is reacted with 2-butene-l,4-diol, in the resulting 2-[R1C(O)OCH20]-l,3-oxathiolanyl-5-one, R1 will be propyl. In other embodiments, the carboxylic acid chloride or other ester precursor is selected such that R1 is alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkaryl, alkheteroaryl or aralkyl.<br>
In the second step of the reaction, the 2-butene-l,4-diester is cleaved, preferably by ozonolysis, to provide an acetal of the formula (alkylO^CHR, wherein R is -(CHb-O-CCCOR1), and R1 is alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkaryl, alkheteroaryl or aralkyl. Ozonolysis reactions are typically carried out at very low temperatures, usually, -70 °C or less. By carrying out the reaction at a higher temperature, perhaps -10 °C, specialized low temperature reactors are not needed. The reaction affording acetals can be run in a variety of alcoholic solvents with or without co-solvents such as dichloromethane. The preferred alcoholic solvent is methanol. Ozonolysis reactions are often quenched with dimethyl sulfide, however, the use of thiourea has been found to afford the desired product in higher purity.<br>
Alternatively, an acetal of the formula (alkylO^CHR, wherein R is (CH2OC(0)R') and R' is alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkheteroaryl, or aralkyl, can be prepared by acylation of (alkylOJiCHCHjOH with an appropriate acid halide or anhydride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine.<br>
In a key step of the process, the acetal is then directly reacted with mercaptoacetic acid in the presence of a Lewis or protic acid in an organic solvent with a minimum amount of water. The acetal can be used as a mixture of the hemLcetal, the acetal monomer or higher condensation products thereof. Any protic acid or Lewis acid that provides the desired results is appropriate for use in this process. It has been found that the cyclocondensation of an acetal with mercaptoacetic acid efficiently provides a 1,3-oxathiolane. Conversely, the cyclocondensation of an aldehyde with mercaptoacetic acid is often times problematic affording much lower yields of desired 1,3-oxathiolane contaminated with unreacted aldehyde as well as aldehyde by-products.<br>
In the next step, the 2-protected hydroxymethyl-5-oxo-l,3-oxathiolane is resolved by a number of available methods which are known in the art. The 2-substituent can be selected on the basis of ease of resolution at this stage. The group, for example, can be one known to be cleaved stereoselectively by an enzyme. U.S. Patent No. 5,204,466 to Liotta, et al., describes a method to resolve the oxathiolane by enzymatic stereoselective hydrolysis using porcine pancreatic lipase, subtilisin, or pig liver esterase. U.S. Patent No. 5,663,320 claims a process for producing a chiral 1,3-oxathiolane intermediate that includes resolving the racemic intermediate with a chiral auxiliary. WO 91/17159 discloses the use of cellulose triacetate or |}-cyclodextrin chiral columns to separate the enantiomers of the 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides.<br>
The desired isolated (2R)-enantiomer of the 2-protected hydroxymethyl-5-oxo-l,3-oxathiolane, which in the case of 3TC and FTC, provides the p-L-enantiomer is reduced to the corresponding 5-0-protected compound, for example, the 5-acetate, using a reducing agent, preferrably lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates four additional embodiments (methods A-D) for preparing the 1,3-oxathiolane ring. As a nonlimiting illustrative example of method A hi Figure 2, (5-oxo-l,3-oxathiolan-2-yl) methyl butanoate can be prepared by a four-step process which does not require purification of the intermediate products. In a first step, (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-yl) methyl butanoate is prepared from solketal and n-butyryl chloride in t-butyl methyl ether, DMAP and triethylamine. The (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-yl) methyl butanoate is then placed in solution with Dowex SOW X8-100 H* resin in methanol, to yield 2,3-dihydroxypropyl butanoate. The resulting diol is then reacted with a solution of sodium periodate in distilled water to produce 2-oxoethyl butanoate. Using 2-oxoethyl butanoate, the (5-oxo-l,3-oxathiolan-2-yl) methyl butanoate can be prepared by reaction with mercaptoacetic acid as p-TsOH-H20 hi acetonitrile. The (5-oxo-l,3-oxathiolan-2-yl) methyl butanoate can be converted into its 5-acetyloxy derivative by reacting with lithium tri-t-butoxy aluminum hydride in THF.<br>
As a nonlimiting example using method B in Figure 2 to obtain the (5-oxo-l,3-oxathiolan-"-yl) methyl butanoate or its 5-acetyloxy derivative is to react' ,2-dihydroxy ethane with n-butyryl chloride in triethylamine. This reaction produces 2-hydroxyethyl butanoate, which is further reacted Pa05 in dry DCM, followed by DMSO and triethylamine to produce 2-oxyethyl butanoate. The 2-bxyethy butanoate can be converted to the 5-<br>
acetyloxy derivative of (5-oxo-l,3-oxathiolan-2-yl) methyl butanoate by the process described above, or it can be converted into (5-oxo-l,3-oxathiolan-2-yl) methyl butanoate by reacting with mercaptoacetic acid and CSA in dry DCM.<br>
As a nonlimiting example using method C in Figure 2, (5-oxo-l,3-oxathiolan-2-yl) methyl butanoate or the 5-acetyloxy derivative thereof may be obtained from process which includes reacting 2,2-diethoxyethy! butanoate in DCM and treating with TFA and water. This reaction yields 2-oxoethylbutanoate, which may be reacted with mercaptoacetic acid in CSA and DCM to produce the desired (5-oxo-l,3-oxathiolan-2-yl) methyl butanoate., or with l,4-dithiane-2,5-diol in THF to obtain the 5-acetyloxy derivative.<br>
Method D in Figure 2 is similar to the method described above illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
These steps are more fully understood by reference to the following examples, which are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
To a 200 gallon reactor equipped with an efficient cooling system was charged methyl tert-butyl ether (MtBE, 278 L), DMAP (391 g, 3.2 moles), triethylamine (102.3 L, 74.4 kg, 736.2 moles) and 2-butene-l,4-diol (26.4 Li 28.2 kg, 320 moles). The stirrer was started and the temperature of the reaction mixture was cooled to approximately 4°C. Butyryl chloride (69.6 L, 71.5 kg, 672 moles) was added to the reaction mixture at such a rate as to maintain the batch temperature below 20°C. The triethylamine hydrochloride precipitates during the addition and the reaction mixture becomes a thick, but movable slurry. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture (silica gel plate; Analtech No. 02521, eluted with 9:1 hexane/EtOAc, and visualized with PMA stain) indicated the reaction was complete after stirring for an additional hour after the addition was complete. Water (120 L) was added to the reactor, and the resulting mixture was stirred until all of the solids dissolved. The phases were separated. The lower (aqueous) layer was checked by TLC analysis for the absence of product (if product is present, save the layer for future product recovery). The upper, organic layer was washed with water (72L), saturated aquec-is potassium bicarbonate (72L, checked to make sure the exiting aqueous layer was basic, evaporated, under reduced pressure, to afford 69.4 kg of 2-butene-l ,4-dibutyrate (95% yield) as a pale golden oil. The NMR spectrum was consistent with a reference spectrum.<br>
Example 2     Ozonolysis of 2-oxoethyl butyrate methyl hemiacetal<br>
To a 12 L, three necked round bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, immersion thermometer, oil filled gas outlet bubbler and an ozone inlet tube was charged 2-butene-l,4-dibutyrate (1005.0 g, 4.4 moles) and methanol (5 L). The Ozonia CFS-2 ozone generator, 1200 watts, 1 atmosphere oxygen, flow 1 m3/h, stirrer was started and the mixture was cooled hi an ice/methanol bath to -20°C. Ozone bubbled into the solution. The temperature of the mixture rose to -10 °C during the addition of ozone. After two hours, thin layer chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture (silica gel plate, Analtech No. 02521, eluted with 9:1 hexane/EtOAc and visualized with PMA stain) showed the complete disappearance of the starting material. The stirred reaction mixture was purged with nitrogen for 15 minutes and cooled back down to -20°C. Thiourea (170 g, 2.23 moles, Johnson Matthey IOB16) was added in 17 gram portions over 1.5 hours. The temperature of the mixture rose to 0 °C. One hour after the complete addition of thiourea, thin layer chromatography and 1H NMR analysis showed the complete disappearance of the ozonide. The mixture was cooled back down to -20°C and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to afford 1.5 kg of 2-oxoethyl butyrate methyl hemiacetal (97% yield) as a pale yellow oil. The NMR spectrum was consistent with a reference spectrum.<br>
Example 3    Preparation of 2-Butyryloxymethyl-l,3-oxathioIan-5-oiie<br>
To a 72-L round-bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, immersion thermometer, nitrogen inlet, pressure equalizing addition funnel and distillation head was charged toluene (31 L, Fisher) and 2-oxoethyl butyrate methyl hemiacetal (10kg, 9.3 kg actual correcting for residual MeOH). This starting material is actually a mixture of the acetal, hemiacetal, dimer, and trimer. The stirrer was started and mercaptoacetic acid (4.5 L, 64.7 moles) was added dropwise through the addition funnel over two hours. The temperature of the reaction mixture increased to 28°C during the addition. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture (silict gel ,late; Analtech No. 02521, eluted with 7:3 hexane/EtOAc, and visualized with PMA stain) indicated the starting material was consumed when the addition was concluded. The mixture was heated to 85°C (internal temperature). The distillate (5 L of a mixture of toluene and aqueous methanol) was<br>
collected over at 75°C (head temperature). Thin layer chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture (silica gel plate; Analtech No. 02521, eluted with 7:3 hexane/EtOAc, and visualized with PMA stain) indicated the reaction was complete after eight hours of heating. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and pumped slowly into a 100-L reactor containing 16 L of stirred saturated aqueous potassium bicarbonate solution. The mixture was stirred for 20 minutes then stopped and the layers were allowed to separate. The organic layer was washed with 6 L of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution and was evaporated to dryness. The crude product was passed through a 2 inch Pope Scientific wiped-film still (column temperature at 90°C, 0.5 mm vacuum, at a rate of ca. 0.5 kg per hour). Low boiling impurities were in the distillate flask while the product was collected in the bottom flask. The yield was 5.8 kg (53.8%). This material was 92% pure by GC analysis (HP-1 Methyl Silicone Gum Column, nitrogen carrier gas at 50 mL/min, Flame lonization Detector. 280 °C, 65 °C held for 1 min then ramp at 12.5 °C/min up to 250 °C and held for 1 min, injection volume: 1-2 uL of an EtOAc solution). The NMR spectrum was consistent with a reference spectrum.<br>
Example 4 Preparation of 5-Acetoxy-2-butyryIoxymethyl-l-3-oxathioIane<br>
To a 50-L four-neck round-bottom flask equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer, two N2-bubblers, a stopper and a thermocouple/thermowell was charged with anhydrous THF (4.1 L, Aldrich). To this was added slowly, in 100-g portions, lithium aluminum hydride pellets (334 g; 8.8 mol; Aldrich lot # 04414KR). This slurry was further diluted with an additional amount of THF (4.1 L) and allowed to stir for 15 hours. Temperature after addition initially rose to 37°C and eventually cooled to 22 °C. The resulting grey mixture was cooled to -5 °C using an ice/MeOH bath. The stopper was replaced with a 5-L pressure equalizing addition funnel and was charged with a mixture of tert-butanol (2.0 kg; 2.6 L; 27.6 mol) and THF (600 mL). This mixture was slowly added to the reaction mixture over 2.5 hours. Reaction temperature increased to 15.9 °C during the addition. The cooling bath was removed and r^plac' 1 with a warm water bath, warming the reaction temperature to 33°C. This temperature was maintained for 1.5 hours or until the gas evolution ceased. The reaction mixture was cooled to -6 °C using an ice/MeOH bath. To the addition funnel was charged a mixture of 2-butyryloxymethyl-l,3-oxathiolan-5-one [1410.6<br>
g; 6.9 mol and THF (350 mL)]. This mixture was slowly added to the reaction mixture, keeping the internal temperature below 5 °C. The reaction was allowed to stir for 1.5 hours at which point an aliquot (five drops of reaction mixture) was quenched with acetic anhydride/4-dimethylaminopyridine and diluted with ethyl acetate (ca. 1 mL). GC analysis of the aliquot mixture (HP-1 Methyl Silicone Gum Column, nitrogen carrier gas at 50 mL/min, Flame lonization Detector: 280 °C, 65 °C held for 1 min then ramp at 12.5 °C/min to 250 °C and held for 1 min injection volume: 1 uL of the quenched reaction mixture) showed no more starting lactone (RT = 7.4 minutes). The cooling bath was replenished with fresh ice/MeOH mixture and the reaction was cooled to -9.0 °C. To the resulting greenish reaction mixture was added 4-dimethylaminopyridine (42 g; 0.35 mol) in one portion. To the addition runnel was charged acetic anhydride (7065.5 g; 6.5 L; 69.0 mol) in portions. This was slowly added to the reaction mixture over 1.5 hours maintaining the temperature below ODC. The resulting greenish reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 13 hours while gradually wanning it up to 19 °C. GC analysis (HP-1 Methyl Silicone Gum Column, nitrogen carrier gas at 50 mL/min, Flame lonization Detector. 280 °C, 65 °C held for 1 min then ramp at 12.5 °C/min to 250 °C and held for 1 min. injection volume: 1-2 uL of the reaction mixture) showed the reaction to be complete (formation of two new peaks at RT= 8.4 and 8.6 minutes).<br>
The brownish-orange reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (13 L). Half of the reaction mixture was filtered through a pad of celite (7.5 cm thick in an 18-inch table-top runnel). Filtration proceeded extremely slowly. Celite (1.5 kg) was added to the second half of the reaction mixture. This was allowed to stir for four hours and was filtered through a pad of celite using the same protocol as above. The filtration proceeded smoothly. The combined filtrates were transferred to a 72-L drop-bottom flask equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer. To this was added saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (20 L). The icsulting biphasic mixture was stirred for one hour at which point the layers were separated and the organic layer was washed with an additional saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (10 L), followed by saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (20 L). The layers were separated and the organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (3.0 kg) using a lightning stirrer to agitate the suspension. The magnesium sulfate was removed by vacuum filtration and the filtrate was evaporated in vacuo (35 °C water bath) to afford a red liquid. This was further concentrated using a high vacuum pump (23 mmHg; 40 °C) for 1.5<br>
hours which afforded the crude 5-acetoxy-butyryloxymethyl-l,3-oxathiolane as a red oil (1483.0 g; 87% yield).<br>
A 10-g portion of the crude 5-acetoxy-butyryloxymethyl-l,3-oxathiolane was dissolved in hexane (100 mL, 10 volumes) and stirred vigorously until a small portion of red oil remained on the bottom of the flask. To this stirred mixture was added silica gel (2 g) and this mixture was stirred for 10 minutes. The resulting slurry was filtered through a pad of celite affording a pale yellow filtrate. Evaporation of solvent in vacuo provided 5-acetoxy-butyryloxymethyl- 1,3-oxathiolane as a yellow oil (7.7 g; 77% recovery). While the TLC baseline impurities were removed, the GC analysis did not change.<br>
Example 5     Condensation of 5-acetoxy-butyryloxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolane with 5-fluorocytosine using iodotrimethylsilane as the Lewis acid<br>
A 3-L three necked round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, stopper and a water-cooled reflux condenser fitted with a nitrogen bubbler was charged with 5-fluorocytosine (51.6g, 0.40 mol), hexamethyldisilazane (665 mL, 3.10 mol) and ammonium sulfate (2.0g). The resultant slurry was heated to reflux for 2.5h whereupon the formation of a white solid on the inner wall of the condenser was observed. The resulting yellow solution was allowed to cool to room temperature at which time a white solid formed in the reaction solution. The excess hexamethyldisilazane was removed under reduced pressure while maintaining an inert atmosphere. To this white solid was added methylene chloride (890 mL) producing a clear, yellow solution. The reaction vessel was equipped with a thermocouple/thermowell, a claisen head fitted with a pressure equalizing addition funnel and a nitrogen bubbler. The reaction solution was cooled to -5 °C in an ice-methanol bath at which point a solution of oxathiolan; acetate (175.6g (62% pure by GC), 0.41moL) in methylene chloride (300mL) was transferred in portions to the addition runnel and subsequently added to the reaction mixture in a dropwise fashion over 45 minutes. The temperature of the reaction solution was maintained between -5 °C and O °C. Following addition, the addition funnel was rinsed with 100 mL of methylene chloride and this was added to the reaction mixture. A solution of iodotrimethylsilane (89.0 mL, 0.62 mol) in methylene chloride (150mL) was transferred to the addition runnel and was subsequently added to the reaction mixture over 45 minutes, keeping the internal temperature of the<br>
mixture between -5 °C and O °C. Some white smoke formation was noted during the initial addition, but this soon dissipated toward the end of the addition. The resulting reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature where it was stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was carerully quenched with saturated, aqueous sodium bicarbonate and the resulting layers split. The organic layer was washed with brine and concentrated under reduced pressure affording 228 g of a yellow-brown semi-solid. HPLC analysis showed an approximate 1:1 mixture of a and p anomers. A portion of this material was recrystallized from toluene affording a clean separation of the a and p anomers.<br>
Example 6     Removal of butyrate protecting group<br>
An 8.0g (25 mmol) sample of the butyrate ester (SA.494.89.1) was dissolved in 160 mL of methanol, vigorous stirring was initiated and the solution was immersed in an ice/water bath. After 10 min this solution was treated with 6.4g of DOWEX SBR strongly basic anion (OH") exchange resin (Sigma cat# 1-9880, p. 1803). After stirring for 3h the bath was removed and stirring was continued until TLC analysis revealed complete consumption of starting material. The mixture was diluted with 100 mL of methanol and filtered. The resin was washed with 100 mL of methanol and the combined solution was concentrated affording a pale-yellow solid. This solid was triturated with 20 mL of COLD ethyl acetate and the resultant solid was dried affording 5.0g (81%) of 9/152-15 as an off-white solid.<br>
It should be noted that the resin should be exhaustively washed with methanol, and then dried prior to use. A good TLC system for this reaction is 15% methanol/85% chloroform.<br>
Alternatively, the butyrate ester may be removed by treating the ester with primary or secondary amine in an alcohol solvent. The preferred amines are ammonia and butylamine and the preferred solvent is methanol.<br>

To a well-stirred solution of solketal (21, 62.6 ml, 500 mmol), Et3N (83.6 ml, 600 mmol) and DMAP (5 g, 40.9 mmol) in tert-butyl methyl ether (11) at 0 °C, n-butyryl chloride (52.4 mL, 500 mmol) was added dropwise over a 75 minute period. The mixture was stirred for an additional hour at 0 °C and then at room temperature for an additional 5 hours. The mixture was diluted with AcOEt (11), washed with water (11), dried (MgSO4), filtered and evaporated to afford 22 (104.6 g, 500 mmol, 100 %) as an oil.
