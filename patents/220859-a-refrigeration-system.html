"A REFRIGERATION SYSTEM"<br>
DAIKIN INDUSTRIES, LTD., a corporation of Japan, of Umeda Center Building, 4-12, Nakazaki-nishi-2-chome, Kita-ku, Osaka, shi, Osaka 530-8323, Japan,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
s<br><br>
Specification<br>
Refrigeration System<br>
5    TECHNICAL FIELD:<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a refrigeration system which uses a working medium containing an R32 (chemical formula: CH2F2) refrigerant.<br>
10    BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] For heat-pump refrigeration systems using a refrigerant, since HCFC-base refrigerants having larger ozone-depleting coefficients have became a target of CFC regulation, an R410A (R32 : R125 =' 50 : 50) refrigerant<br>
15   that is an HFC-base refrigerant having an ozone-depleting<br>
coefficient of zero is in use as an alternative refrigerant<br>
therefor.   As  refrigeration  systems  using  the  R410A<br>
refrigerant,  indeed  those  capable  of  obtaining  COP<br>
(Coefficient Of Performance) levels equivalent to that of<br>
20   an R22 refrigerant have been developed into products, but<br>
further improvement in COP is desired from the recent<br>
years'  demand for energy saving.   However,  the R410A<br>
refrigerant has a problem that it cannot be improved in COP<br>
beyond the R22 refrigerant without increasing the size of<br>
2-<br><br>
the heat exchanger to thereby increase the amount of charged refrigerant with the resulting cost increased.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION 5    [0003]  - Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a refrigeration system capable of improving the COP while  ensuring sufficient  reliability by using  a working medium containing an R32 refrigerant. [0004]    In order to achieve the above object, there is 10   provided a refrigeration system which uses a working medium composed of an R32 refrigerant or a mixed refrigerant containing at least 70 wt% of the R32, and polyvinyl ether oil whose viscosity at 40°C is 46 - 82 est.<br>
[0005]    The present  applicant has  discovered  through 15   experiments that a favorable lubricity of the compressor, a sufficient reliability, and a high COP can be obtained, while global environmental problems are provided _ for, by using for the refrigeration system a working medium which consists of the low-GWP  (Global Warming Parameter) R32 20   refrigerant free from ozone layer depletion or a mixed refrigerant  containing  at  least  70  wt%  of  R32,  and polyvinyl ether oil whose viscosity at 40°C is 46 - 82 est. Therefore, according to the refrigeration system having the above constitution, the COP of the system can be improved 25   by lowering the viscosity at 40°C of the polyvinyl ether<br>
3<br><br>
oil used as refrigeration oil for the R32 refrigerant within a range of 4 6 - 82 est that allows sufficient reliability to be obtained,  and thereby improving • the mechanical efficiency of the compressor.   Further,  by 5   selecting a polyvinyl ether oil whose viscosity at 40°C is low within the range of 4 6 - 82 est as the refrigeration oil, the refrigeration system such as a split-type air conditioner having an indoor unit and an outdoor unit separately can be made larger in the high-low difference 10   between the indoor unit and the outdoor unit, larger in the length of the connecting pipe that connects together the indoor unit and the outdoor unit, and further thinner in the diameter of the gas connecting pipe, as compared with systems using the R410A refrigerant or the R22 refrigerant. 15    [0006]    In one embodiment of the present invention, the viscosity of the polyvinyl ether oil at 40°C is 46 - 68 est.<br>
[0007] According to this embodiment, the COP of the system can be improved more reliably. 20 [0008] In one embodiment of the present invention, a. winding of a stator of a motor for a compressor is coated with an insulating layer of at least one selected from among crosslinked-polyethylene, polyvinyl formal, polyester, polyesterimide, polyamide and polyamide imide.<br>
Ll<br><br>
[0009] According to the refrigeration system of the above embodiment, by coating the winding of the stator of the motor for the compressor with an insulating layer of, at least one selected from among crosslinked-polyethylene, 5 polyvinyl formal, polyester, polyesterimide, polyamide and polyamide imide, weather resistance of the insulating layer is improved, high reliability can be obtained, and long-term service can be achieved.<br>
[0010]    In one embodiment of the present invention, at 10   least  one  among  an  antifoaming  agent,  a  moisture supplemental agent or an extreme pressure additive is added to the polyvinyl ether oil.<br>
[0011]   According to the refrigeration' system of the above embodiment, by adding an antifoaming agent to the 15   polyvinyl ether oil, foamability can be suppressed, and seizure  of  the  compressor  caused  by  suction  of  the refrigerant due to a foaming phenomenon can be prevented. Further, by adding a moisture supplemental agent to the polyvinyl  ether  oil,  degradation  in  chemical  reaction 20   caused by an effect of moisture and freezing in portions of low temperatures can be prevented.  Further, by adding an extreme pressure additive to the polyvinyl ether oil, a chemical adsorption film is formed on the sliding surface of the compressor so that the lubricity of the slidable 25   portion can be improved.<br>
f<br><br><br>
[0012] In one embodiment of the present invention, the refrigeration system comprises a refrigerant circuit in which a compressor, a condenser, a decompressor, and an evaporator are connected in a loop, the refrigerating cycle 5 having no dryer for eliminating moisture in the refrigerant.<br>
[0013] According to the refrigeration system of the above embodiment, by using the polyvinyl ether oil resistant to moisture and less in degradation for the 10 refrigeration oil, the dryer can be eliminated, allowing a cost reduction and downsizing of the system to be achieved. [0014] Also, there is provided an air conditioner using a working medium composed of an R32 refrigerant or a mixed refrigerant containing at least 70 wt% of the R32 and 15   polyvinyl ether oil whose viscosity at 40°C is 46 - 82 est,<br>
wherein the air conditioner has an indoor unit and an outdoor unit.<br>
[0015] According to the air conditioner having this constitution, the high-low difference between the indoor 20 unit and the outdoor unit can be increased, the length of' the connecting pipes can be increased, and further the diameter of the gas connecting pipes can be narrowed, as compared with air conditioners using the R410A refrigerant or the R22 refrigerant.<br>

15    BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0019]   A refrigeration system of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference  to illustrated embodiments. [0020]    Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram showing a schematic<br>
20   configuration  of  a  heat-pump  air  conditioner  as  a refrigeration system according to an embodiment of the invention, where reference numeral 1 denotes a compressor, numeral 2 denotes a four-pass switching valve one of whose ends is connected to the discharge side of the compressor<br>
25   1, numeral 3 denotes an outdoor heat exchanger one of whose<br>
1<br><br>
^r-<br>
ends is .connected to the other end of the  four-pass switching valve  2,  numeral  4  denotes  a  motor-driven expansion valve one of whose ends is connected to the other end of the outdoor heat exchanger 3, numeral 5 denotes an indoor heat exchanger one of whose ends is connected to the other end of the motor-driven expansion valve 4,  and numeral 6 denotes an accumulator one of whose ends is connected to the other end of the indoor heat exchanger 5 through the four-pass switching valve 2 while the other end is connected to the suction side of the compressor 1.  The air conditioner  includes  a  temperature  sensor  11  for detecting the discharge pipe temperature of the compressor lt    a temperature sensor 12 for detecting the refrigerant temperature of the outdoor heat exchanger 3, a temperature sensor  13  for  detecting  outside  air  temperature,  a temperature  sensor  14  for  detecting  the  refrigerant temperature of the indoor heat exchanger 5, a temperature sensor 15 for detecting indoor temperature, a temperature sensor 16 for detecting the 'refrigerant temperature on the suction side of the compressor 1, and a control unit 7 for, upon receiving signals from the temperature sensors 11 -16,  controlling  the  compressor  1,  the  motor-driven expansion valve 4, and the like.  In addition, a closing valve 21 is disposed between the motor-driven expansion valve 4 and the indoor heat exchanger 5, while a closing<br><br>
valve 24 is disposed between the indoor heat exchanger 5 and the four-pass switching valve 2.<br>
[0021]    An outdoor unit 10 is made up of ' the compressor 1, 'the four-pass  switching valve 2,  the outdoor heat 5   exchanger  3,  the motor-driven expansion valve  4,  the accumulator 6, the control unit 7, the closing valve 21, the closing valve 24, the temperature sensors 11 - 13, the temperature sensor 16, and an outdoor fan (not shown), while an indoor unit 20 is made up of the indoor heat 10   exchanger 5, the temperature sensor 14, the temperature sensor 15, and an indoor fan (not shown).<br>
[0022]    The  air  conditioner  uses  a  working  medium consisting of an R32 refrigerant or a mixed refrigerant containing at least 70 wt% of the R32, and polyvinyl ether 15   oil (product model number: FV4 6 - FV 82, made by Idemitsu Kosan)  whose viscosity at 40°C is  46 -  82 est.   In addition,  eentistokes  [est]  is  the unit of  kinematic viscosity, which is expressed also in mmVsec.  Also, the kinematic viscosity is measured with a glass capillary 20   viscosimeter in conformance with a kinematic viscosity test method of JIS K2283-1983.<br>
[0023]    In the air conditioner of the above constitution,<br>
for air cooling operation, the four-pass switching valve 2<br>
is switched to a switching position depicted in solid line,<br>
25   causing the compressor 1 to be activated, where a high-<br><br>
pressure refrigerant discharged from the  compressor  1 enters the outdoor heat exchanger 3 through the four-pass switching valve 2.  Then, the refrigerant condensed by the outdoor heat exchanger 3 is depressurized by the motor-driven expansion valve 4, and then enters the indoor heat exchanger 5 through a connecting pipe 22.  The refrigerant that has evaporated at the indoor heat exchanger 5 returns to  the  suction  side  of  the  compressor  1  through  a connecting pipe 23, the four-pass switching valve 2, and the accumulator 6.  Thus, the working medium containing the R32 refrigerant circulates through a refrigerant circuit composed of the compressor 1,   the outdoor heat exchanger- 3, the  motor-driven  expansion  valve  4,  the  indoor  heat exchanger 5 and the accumulator 6, thereby performing a refrigerating cycle. Then, the indoor air is circulated by the  indoor  fan  (not  shown)  through  the  indoor  heat exchanger 5, thereby cooling the room interior. [0024]   As a result of examining the reliability of the compressor and the COP (Coefficient Of Performance) of the system by changing the viscosity grade of the polyvinyl ether oil  added to. the  R32  refrigerant,  the  present applicant has  found that  favorable  properties  can be obtained with the viscosity at 40°C in a range of 46 - 82 est as shown in Figs. 2A and 2B.  That is, Fig. 2A shows the reliability of the compressor relative to the viscosity<br>
10<br><br>
grade, while Fig. 2B shows the COP ratio of this system to a system using R410A refrigerant relative to the viscosity grade. As shown in Figs. 2A and 2B, when the viscosity at 40°C is in the range of 46 - 82 est, the reliability of the compressor is improved and moreover the COP ratio of the system is also improved as compared with the system using R410A refrigerant.  More preferably, setting the viscosity at 40°C of the polyvinyl ether oil to within a range of 4 6 - 68 est allows the COP of the system to be securely improved.  In addition, when mixed refrigerants containing at least 70 wt% of the R32 refrigerant is used, there is almost no difference in the improvement effects on the reliability of the compressor and the COP ratio of the system.<br>
[0025] For comparisons among the R410A refrigerant, the R22 refrigerant and the R32 refrigerant, the high-low difference of the indoor unit and the outdoor unit, the length of the connecting pipe, and the diameter of the gas connecting pipe were examined by experiments with the viscosity grade of the refrigeration oils changed. In this case, the experiments were carried out by using polyvinyl ether oil (product model number: FVC, made by Idemitsu Kosan) as the refrigeration oil for the R410A refrigerant, Suniso oil as the refrigeration oil for the R22 refrigerant,  and  polyvinyl  ether  oil  (FV)  as  the<br>
1/<br><br>
refrigeration oil for the R32 refrigerant, and with an air conditioner having a refrigeration power of 4 - 5 kW. As a result of the experiments, as shown in Fig. 3A that, among the R410A, R22 and R32 refrigerants, the maximum high-low 5   difference between the indoor unit and the outdoor unit decreased with rising viscosity grade of the refrigeration oil, whereas the maximum high-low difference between the indoor unit and the outdoor unit in every viscosity grade of the R32 refrigerant was larger than those of the R410A 10   and R22 refrigerants.  Further, as shown in Fig. 3B, among the R410A, R22 and R32 refrigerants, the maximum -length of the connecting pipe'increased with lowering viscosity grade of the refrigeration oil, whereas the maximum length of the connecting pipe in  every viscosity grade  of the  R32 15   refrigerant was larger than those of the R410A and R22 refrigerants.   Further,  as shown in Fig. 3C,  among the R410A, R22 and the R32 refrigerants, the minimum diameter of the gas connecting pipe increased with rising viscosity grade  of  the  refrigeration  oil,  whereas  the  minimum 2 0   diameter of the gas connecting pipe in every viscosity grade of the R32 refrigerant was narrower than those of the R410A and R22. refrigerants.<br>
[0026]    Thus, there can be provided an air conditioner<br>
capable of obtaining sufficient reliability and high COP<br>
25   while global environment,problems are dealt with, by using<br>
)x<br><br>
a working medium containing the R32 refrigerant having a<br>
low GWP (Global Warming Parameter).<br>
[0027]    In addition, by coating the winding of the stator<br>
of the motor for the compressor with an insulating layer of 5   at least one selected from among crosslinked-polyethylene,<br>
polyvinyl formal, polyester, polyesterimide, polyamide and polyamide imide, weather resistance of the insulating layer<br>
is improved and high reliability can be obtained.<br>
[0028]    Further, by adding an antifoaming agent to the 10   polyvinyl ether oil, foamability can be suppressed, and seizure  of  the  compressor  caused  by  suction  of  the refrigerant due to a foaming phenomenon can be prevented. ' Further, by adding a moisture supplemental agent to the polyvinyl  ether oil,  degradation in  chemical  reaction 15   caused by an effect of moisture and freezing in portions of low temperatures can be prevented.  Further, by adding an extreme pressure additive to the polyvinyl ether oil, a chemical adsorption film is formed on the sliding surface of the compressor'by the extreme pressure additive so that 20   the lubricity of the slidable portion can be improved.<br>
[0029]    Further, whereas using a dryer with the R32 for<br>
the purpose of eliminating moisture is quite difficult<br>
because of the R32's low molecular weight, using for the<br>
refrigeration oil the polyvinyl ether oil having a property<br>
25   of higher resistance to moisture than other synthetic oils<br>
13<br><br>
such as ester oil allows an air conditioner without a dryer or with a small dryer to be realized.<br>
[0030] Further, by selecting a polyvinyl ether oil whose viscosity at 40°C is low within the range of 46 - 82 est as 5 the refrigeration oil, the high-low difference between the indoor unit 20 and the outdoor unit 10 can be increased, the connecting pipes 22, 23 which connect the indoor unit 20 and the outdoor unit 10 together can be elongated, and further the diameter of the gas connecting pipes can be 10 narrowed, as compared with those using the R410A refrigerant or the R22 refrigerant.<br>
[0031]    Although the above embodiment has been described on an air conditioner as a refrigeration system,  the present  invention  may  also  be  applied  to  other 15   refrigeration systems.<br>
[0032] Further, although an air conditioner using the R32 refrigerant has been described as the refrigeration system in the above embodiment, yet the refrigerant to be used in the refrigeration system is not limited to this, 20 and mixed refrigerants containing at least 70 wt% of the R32 may also be used. For example, a mixed refrigerant of the R32 refrigerant with C02, which is a mixed refrigerant containing not less than 70 wt% and not"more than 90 wt% of the R32 against C02, or a mixed refrigerant of the R32 25   refrigerant and the R22 refrigerant,  which is a mixed<br>
lu<br><br>
refrigerant containing not less than 70 wt% and not more than 90 wt% of the R32 against the R22 refrigerant may be used.<br>
h<br><br>
