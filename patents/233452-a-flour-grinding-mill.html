 A FLOUR GRINDING MILL<br><br>
                                   SANDEEP TALAKSHI SETHIA<br>
of B-205, Shanti Park, Geeta Najgar, Patak Road,<br>

THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES <br>
 THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER <br>
               I N WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br>
This invention relates to flour grinding mills. More particularly, this invention relates to a portable flour-grinding mill having a rotatably driven grinding wheel and a fixed grinding wheel spaced apart and adjusting means for selectively moving the rotating grinding wheel toward and away from the fixed grinding wheel. The instant grinding mill can be manually operated if necessary, and a collection means for the newly ground floor is disclosed.<br>
The art of milling or comminuting grain by rotary grinding and/or cutting or chopping devices is extremely old and well developed. Conventionally, such mills have been ponderous and slow in operation. There is a need for a small, efficient grain grinder for making whole wheat flour and the like rapidly, grinding it very shortly or immediately before flour is to be used so as to void loss of vitamins and other nutrients in the whole grain. Such devices are finding favor in homes because they make it possible to have freshly ground whole grain flour on demand, which can be made into bread and other products while the flour retains the nutrients which are<br>
too  often  removed  in  conventional  milling  or  lost  in<br>
prolonging storage in warehouses and stores.<br>
A large variety of hand-powered and electrical-powered home grain mills are known. In the prior art there is disclosed a portable mill for grinding wneat and other grains comprising two annular grinding Atones, one fixed and the<br><br>
other driven, each secured to steel cutting burrs which have their cutting edges substantially in the grinding plane and of<br>
which receives grain through a central opening in the burrs.<br>
i<br>
The grain is cut or chopped by secant or non-radial cutter elements closely facing each other and set for shearing action. These forces the grain as it is cut radially outward between annular grinding stones which are secured respectively to the stationary and the driven Totary but The driven burr is directly connected to the drive shaft of the motor, the motor being provided with a thrust bearing to oppose the thrust between the chopping and grinding elements. A hopper above the stores supplies the feed and includes a removable bottom sea ed to the sides, and is provided with a metering opening to feed grain at controlled rate into a feed channel connected with the inlet through the stationary burr. The spacing between the two grinding stones is adjusted by moving the mounting block on which the fixed stone is secured.<br><br>
in the prior art there is an upstanding box-like<br>
According to another embodiment disclosed a flour mill comprising housing including a substantially cylindrical abrasive grinding wheel having a multiplicity of spirally disposed tooth-like breaks suitably fastened 1 o one of the sidewalks of the housing, a substantially similar grinding wheel opposingly mounted and journal ed for rotation in the sidewall opposite the fixed grinding wheel, and means for<br><br>
The fixed grinding wheel in one of its walls, a<br>
driving the rotating grinding wheel. is provided with an entranceway<br>
downwardly sloping hopper-like bo torn portion is supported by the fixed wheel in the housing and includes an exitway coincident with the entranceway of the fixed wheel. The wheels are selectively spaced apart with respect to each other to grind grain into flour or cereals. The fixed wheel is mounted on a mounting block, which has a resilient portion for adjusting the spacing between the respective wheels. It is an object of the present invention to provide a flourmill of simple construction including means operable to control and    contain     flour     and     grain    within     the     mill.<br>
Many types and styles of milling wheels have been developed for use in such mills. Some of the milling wheels known to the prior art are constructed entirely of metal, but such wheels are generally not preferred because of the preference for stone ground flour. Milling wheels with stone or cast stone grinding surfaces have been of two types. Some such wheels are cast entirely from ceramic materials. Ceramic wheels of this type produce excellent flour but have<br>
attendant disadvantages associated with the extremely poor heat conductivity of the ceramic material from which they are constructed. As a consequence, the grinding surface becomes unduly hot, tending to scorch the flour produced, particularly when wet grain is milled. Moreover, because heat is not readily radiated from the stone surfaces, a large<br><br>
quantity of heat is transferred from the rotor stone into the driven shaft to which it is mounted, thereby causing the shaft to expand. This expansion tends to decrease the spacing between the rotor and stator stones, thereby causing the stones to jam or overload the motor<br>
Efforts have been made to solve some of the problems associated with the poor heat conductivity of cast stone wheels through the expedient of attaching a cast stone ring to a metallic center. Such efforts have heretofore been unsatisfactory, both because of the relatively large proportion of stone in the composite wheel and because of the difficulties associated with achieving a balanced rotor and with maintaining good alignment between the grinding surface and the axis of the metallic insert.<br>
There thus remains a need for a composite matched set of milling wheels with a stone grinding interface, good heat conductivity and balance, efficient milling characteristics and reliable alignment capabilities.<br>
An object of this invention is to provide means for selectively positioning the grinding wheels with respect to each other for grinding flour or cereal.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a portable<br><br>
flourmill, which can be used effectively to grind a wide variety of grains.<br>
It is still another object of this invention to provide a portable flourmill that can be easily cleaned and/or disassembled.<br>
    It is yet still another object of this invention to provide a new and improved design for the grinding wheels of a portable flourmill.<br>
The present invention will be more fully appreciated upon reference to a detailed description pf a presently preferred embodiment thereof.<br>
flat &amp; tapered areas on to a removable interior<br>
Generally, the present invention comprises an upstanding box-like housing including a substantially cylindrical abrasive grinding wheel having both its grinding face, suitably fastened<br>
wall, a substantially cylindrical abrasive grinding wheel having symmetrically disposed V shaped radial profile on its grinding face opposingly mounted and journalized for rotation in an interior wall opposite the fixed grinding wheel, and means for driving the rotating grinding wheel. The fixed grinding wheel is provided with an entranceway in one of its walls. The grinding face of each grinding wheel has a flat<br>
outer portion and a concave inner portion. A downwardly<br><br>
sloping feed hopper rests on a plate fixed to the removable<br><br>
interior wall and includes an exit-way coincident with the entranceway of the fixed wheel. The wheels are selectively spaced apart with respect to each o^ her to grind into flour or cereals. Means for adjusting the spacing between the respective wheels by moving the movable wheel is provided in the apparatus here disclosed.<br>
The entranceway aforesaid leads from a loading chamber/hopper for the grain or cereal into the grinding area of the mill. Preferably the entry through the fixed stone comprises a circular opening or aperture, the midpoint of which is coincident with the midpoint of the grinding face of the stone.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the exitway from the grinding area is in the form of an arcuate chute which leads into an apertured container through which the chute can be inserted for receiving the ground cereal or flour.<br>
In accordance with still another preferred embodiment of the invention, the apertured container serves as a receptacle to store the portable grinding mil in its inoperative configuration. The apertured container has a lid element which has a perforated wall to permit gases to escape from the container when ground cereal is being introduced into the container in the operative configuration of the grinding mill.<br><br>
According to this invention mere is provided a flour grinding mill, consisting of a grinding section and a bin section removably fitted to the grinding section; said grinding section consisting of a motor compartment in which a motor is disposed along an operative vertical axis; having a shaft projecting both upwards and downwards; a fan fitted on the operative down ward extension of the said shaft, the upward extension of the shaft projecting into a grinding compartment and a hopper compartment; a fixed grinding stone and a grinding wheel fitted to the motor shaft extending into the grinding compartment an annular gap being defined between the fixed grinding stone and the motor shaft; said gap being in communication with the hopper to enable grain or other material to be ground to stream from the hopper through the gap into the grinding area; a chute leading from the grinding area which can be introduced through an aperture in the side wall of the bin into the bin and air vent means for forcing air with the help of the said fan into the grinding area to force ground material from the grinding area through the chute into the interior of the bin.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a sectional schematic view of the grinding mill in accordance with this invention.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to FIG.l, the mill generally indicated by the reference numeral 10 of this invention comprises a grinding'device 12 and a flour receptacle cum housing 14. In housing forming a motor compartment B an electric motor, of suitable size and speed, is seated. The motor is fastened to the interior wall of compartment B by means of four throughbolts. The motor consists of the stator 42 and the rotor 40 which is connected at one end to the rotating shaft 18 passing through bearing 38 and to the bottom end to the fan 44 on a support panel inside the housing B. A bin 14, for receiving the ground flour, is slidably fitted into a Chute extending from the middle grinding area of the mill 12. The bin 14 can readily be pulled out for emptying, as needed. Bin 14 is readily made of bent sheet stainless steel aluminium.<br>
The mill or grinding area 30 itself is situated in a compartment A above the motor compartment area B. This compartment A is adjustably threaded by threads 34 to the compartment B and has a fixed lateral interior wall 32 having an a'perture through which extends the shaft 18 of the motor. A grain hopper 16 is provided above the wall 32. The hopper 16 also has an aperture through which the shaft 18 of the motor extends through and aperture 25. Grain placed in the hopper 16 forms a stream 22 which passes through the aperture 25 and enters the grinding area 30. In the grain<br><br>
transmission zone the shaft 18 is provided with frets 20 to assist in the flow of the grain stream 22 into the grinding area 30.<br>
Fixed to the wall 32 is the fixed grinding stone consisting of the centrally bored base 24 and grinding vanes 28. The vanes have a straight outward edge with a frusto concial inner taper in the region of the central bore . The central annular bore receives the stream of grain 22 therethrough. Fitted on the shaft below the fixed grinding stone is the rotating adjustable grinding wheel 26. The grinding wheel 26 is mounted to the shaft 18 and rotates therewith. The distance X between the rotating grinding wheel and the fixed grinding stone can be varied or adjusted by rotating the threading engagement at the threads 34 by means of an adjustable thread guide 36 fitted thereto thereby bringing the wheel closer to the grind stone or taking it away further apart. By adjusting the threading engagement and by adjusting the distance X, it is possible to bring the rotating grinding wheel closer to the fixed grind stone or move them a further distance apart. Bringing the two elements closer will result in finer ground grain size and moving the two elements further apart will result in coarser particle size. It is seen that the fineness of flour ground is controlled by and related to the distance between the two element the wheel and the stone, that the fineness can be controlled by moving the rotating wheel closer or further away from the fixed<br><br>
stone. Thus it is seen that in adjusting the clearance between the stones, any irregularities in stone surface smoothness can be readily compensated for by adjustment of the movable wheel towards the stone to conform to the fixed stone while maintaining   the   clearance   between   them   as   needed.<br>
The fan 44 forms a novel arrangement for displacing air into the grinding area 30. Air is drawn through vents 52, 48 and 50 and pushes the ground flour from the grinding area through the chute C into the inner area 54 of the bin 14. The air is then displaced through the meshed lid 56 of the bin 14.<br>
Unlike other mills on the market, the instant mill 10 is significantly quieter since most of the motor, other than the cooling area is housed in chamber B beneath grinding area 30 which insulates the noise away from the surroundings. In addition, since a panel, separates the motor from the revolving mill wheel and stone, there is little or no chance for flying dust and flour particles to enter the motor and do damage thereto. A cushioned washer 46 is provided at the base to further dampen any noise or vibration.<br>
One other big advantage to the user is that the key sections of the mill dissemble for easy cleaning. These include, interior panel housing the fixed stone, bin 14 and compartments A and B. The rotating wheel is anchored to the motor shaft in a<br><br>
Conventional manner, e.g. bolting 'and can be removed with hand tools, if need be.<br>
While in the preferred embodiment discussed above, the V-shaped grooves or flutes are found in the rotating wheel, it is also within the scope of this invention for the flutes to be in the fixed stone. It is further within the scope of the invention for there to be flutes within both wheel and stone as illustrated in the drawing. It is also to.be seen that the use of V-shaped grooves has been found to give excellent results with all grains, including corn and wheat.<br>
Though not required, it is preferred to employ a current sensitive relay as is known in the art, in conjunction with a standard motor to switch from a starting mode to a running mode.<br>
It is also to be seen that from the point of view of aesthetics, it is also within the scope of this invention to employ rounded corners and edges on the exterior portions of the apparatus that define the housing, as well as to employ various woods, relief carving and other modes of decoration of the housing.<br>
In operation, grain is placed into the hopper portion and caused to flow by gravity down the bore of the shaft 18 through the exitway and through the bore in the fixed grinding stone and is caused to be thrown against the<br><br>
grinding face of stone and wheels in response to the rotation of the wheel Ground grain fells into the bin 14. In the inoperative configuration the grinding mill 12 can be housed within the bin 14 for convenient storage as a single compact device.<br>
Having thus described in detail a preferred apparatus which embodies the concepts and principles of the invention and which accomplishes the various objects, purposes and aims thereof, it is to be appreciated and vail be apparent to those skilled in the art that may physical changes could be made in the apparatus without altering the inventive concepts and principles embodied therein. Hence, it is intended that the scope of the invention be limited only to the extent indicated in the appended claims.<br><br>
