The invention relates to a wind energy installation having a generator which is driven by a rotor with variable-pitch blades for production of electrical energy, with a pitch adjustment de¬vice being provided for adjustment of the blades, which device has an emergency circuit with an electrical energy store for op¬eration of the blades by means of a blade pitch control motor.<br>
For safety reasons, wind energy installations with variable-pitch rotor blades are generally designed to adjust the rotor blades by means of an autonomous energy store even when the power supply system fails. In order to make it possible to safely stop the wind energy installation in a situation such as this, an emergency drive apparatus is provided. DE-B-103 35 575 discloses a pitch adjustment drive having an emergency drive de¬vice which has a rechargeable battery as an independent electri¬cal energy store for the pitch adjustment drive. The recharge¬able battery is connected to a converter in such a way that, in the event of a fault, the rechargeable battery is connected to the converter by means of a switch, thus providing the power re¬quired to operate the motor. However, it has been found that, during operation of the emergency drive device, certain load states can occur in which the rotor blade whose pitch is to be adjusted drives the motor. This then results in overrunning. In this case, electrical power is produced in the blade pitch con¬trol motor, thus resulting in the risk of the electrical power that is produced being fed back into the rechargeable battery. Feedback such as this is undesirable for a number of reasons, and can lead to damage. High charging currents can occur during feedback, for which the rechargeable battery is unsuitable. In general, the internal resistance of a rechargeable battery while being charged is higher than while it is being discharged, as a<br><br>
result of which dangerously high battery voltages can occur dur¬ing charging and in particular during undesirable charging with high charging currents. A further damaging effect is that, when feedback occurs, this can lead to a rise in the no-load rotation speed of the blade pitch control motor. This leads to a shift in the characteristics and increases the loads acting in the pitch adjustment device and on the blades.<br>
It has been proposed to use a chopper device to destroy the electrical power that is produced by the blade pitch control mo¬tor when overrunning, and in this way to protect the recharge¬able battery against damaging high-current charging. In order to control the braking chopper, the voltage or the current flowing in the emergency circuit can be measured. However, it has been found that, during voltage-controlled operation, the problems of excessively high charging current cannot be coped with safely in all operating states.<br>
The invention is based on the object of improving the protection of the electrical energy store in a wind energy installation of the type mentioned initially.<br>
The solution according to the invention resides in the features of the independent claims. Advantageous developments are the subject matter of the dependent claims.<br>
In a wind energy installation having a generator, which is driven by a rotor with variable-pitch blades, in order to pro¬duce electrical energy, with a pitch adjustment device being provided for adjustment of the blades, in which an emergency circuit is connected to an electrical energy store for operation of the blades by means of the energy store, or is passed to ground or to some other suitable current sink.<br><br>
If overrunning occurs as a result of the aeirodynamic forces act¬ing on the blades when the rotor blade pitch is adjusted quickly, particularly to its safe windmilling position, then the blade pitch control motor acts as a generator. It therefore pro¬duces a current which effectively flows backwards via the emer¬gency circuit to the electrical energy store. However, the cur¬rent does not reach the electrical energy store but bypasses it by means of the shunt path. The essence of the invention is the idea of determining the magnitude of the current passing the shunt path such that it corresponds to the current produced by the blade pitch control motor when overrunning. The invention achieves this by the current mirror device. This results in the capability to reduce to zero the current which is fed back into the electrical energy store, and which corresponds to the dif¬ference between the current produced by the blade pitch control motor and the current carried away via the shunt path. This is achieved by no feedback current flowing back into the battery. The idea of the current mirror in the shunt path on which the invention is based therefore ensures in a surprisingly simple manner that the electrical energy store is safely protected against feedback currents.<br>
In this case, in its simplest form, the current mirror device can be designed such that it has an input and an output, with a determining device for the feedback current of the blade pitch control motor being connected to the input, and its output de¬termining the current through the shunt path. This allows the current mirror device to be formed in a simple manner from pas¬sive components. This not only reduces the required production effort but also, thanks to the low level of complexity, allows high reliability in operation.<br>
However, alternatively or additionally, it is also possible for the current mirror device to be provided with an active control-<br><br>
ler. For this purpose, the current mirror device is expediently designed such that it has a controllable switching element in series with a load element, which controllable switching element is operated by means of a special controller. When the switching element is operated by the controller, it switches on, as a re¬sult of which the current can flow through the load element in the shunt path; when the switching element is not operated, it opens and the current flow in the shunt path is interrupted. The controller need not necessarily be in the form of a physically separate unit but can also just as well be integrated in an al¬ready existing control unit, for example a system management control unit which is generally provided in any case.<br>
The controller may expediently have a clock generator which, in particular, may be in the form of a pulse-width modulator (PWM). This allows an operating signal for the switching element to be generated in a simple manner. For example, in particular, a pulse-width modulator makes it possible to operate the switching element at a fixed frequency of, for example, 4 kHz, and via the duty ratio, to determine the current to be carried away via the shunt path. There is therefore a linear relationship between the duty ratio of the pulse-width modulator and the current in the shunt path. A linear transfer function such as this is particu¬larly advantageous when additional control processes are pro¬vided.<br>
A determining device for the feedback current is expediently connected to the controller. In this case, this is generally a measurement sensor for the current of the blade pitch control motor. However, the possibility should not be excluded of a measure being formed for indirect determination of the feedback current instead of direct measurement of the current in the course of calculation from other variables which it may be pos¬sible to measure more easily, such as a difference voltage.<br><br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention which may be used for independent protection, the controller provides ad¬ditional functions which go beyond a pure current mirror func¬tion. In this variant of the invention, which is referred to as a "modified current mirror", it is possible in particular to provide for the transfer function of the current mirror to have an offset or for its gradient to be variable. An offset module can expediently be provided for this purpose which is designed to set a basic current through the shunt path during emergency operation. In this case, a basic current means the current which flows irrespective of whether or not the blade pitch control mo¬tor is being driven, and thus produces feedback current. In this case,   emergency operation means the operating mode in which the electrical energy storage device produces the electrical energy for operation of the blade pitch control motor. The basic cur¬rent which is produced by the offset module has the effect that some power is always consumed during emergency operation, thus reducing the voltage of the electrical energy store. In particu¬lar, this has the consequence that the voltage resulting from the end-of-charge voltage is quickly reduced to the rated volt¬age. This creates an additional buffer range which protects the electrical energy store from overvoltage if current is fed back as a result of the blade pitch control motor being driven.<br>
In order to avoid an undesirable load on the electrical energy store, particularly in situations such as these, in which the blade pitch control motor has to apply a large amount of power in order to adjust the blades, a blanking device can expediently be provided which is designed to reduce the basic current when the blade pitch control motor is on full load. Reducing the ba¬sic current, which can be reduced to a value of zero, means that, in situations such as these, the entire current which is<br><br>
produced by the electrical energy store flows into the blade pitch control motor and thus produces the maximum power.<br>
It is also expediently possible to provide for the controller to have a gradient control module which is designed to linearly am¬plify the mirror current in the shunt path. This makes it possi¬ble to increase the ratio between the current in the shunt path and the feedback current from the blade pitch control motor. This makes it possible to create buffers to compensate for tol¬erances which can result from the feedback current not being op¬timally determined. In particular, this also makes it possible to use lower quality measurement devices for determining the feedback current, or to generate the feedback current indirectly from other measurement variables which are expediently available in any case.<br>
The controller can preferably also have a threshold value module which is designed to operate the switching element such that an adjustable maximum current in the shunt path is not exceeded. This means that overloading of components in the shunt path can be reliably prevented, even in the extreme case. The risk of failure of the current mirror according to the invention and the risk resulting from this of premature failure of the electrical energy store or an undesirable characteristic change for pitch adjustment during emergency operation can thus be avoided.<br>
The controller furthermore expediently has a compensation module for the energy store, which is designed to modify the mirror current as a function of its state of charge. If a resistor is provided as the load element in the shunt path, then the current flowing through it is dependent not only on the operation of the switching element but also on the voltage of the electrical en¬ergy store. When the battery voltage is falling, this leads to a corresponding reduction in the current in the shunt path. The<br><br>
compensation module is provided in order to prevent an exces¬sively low current from flowing in the shunt path, and changes the operating signal for the switching element as a function of the actual voltage such that a higher current is achieved in the shunt path. Ideally, the compensation module is adjusted such that the current in the shunt path is independent of the actual voltage of the electrical energy store. A voltage measurement device is provided, preferably on the electrical energy store, in order to make this possible.<br>
The controller preferably also has a protective module which is designed to reduce the mirror current as a function of a load state of the load element. The electrical power carried in the shunt path and which is dissipated by the load element is de¬pendent on the square of the current. Particularly at high cur¬rent levels, this results in a major rise in the electrical power to be absorbed. This can lead to overloading of the compo¬nents in the shunt path, particularly of the load element. In particular, there is the risk of thermal overloading, which can easily result in a failure of the load element and therefore failure of the shunt path. In order to avoid this, the protec¬tive module monitors the load state of the load element and, if necessary, ensures that the current in the shunt path is re¬duced. A temperature measurement device is expediently provided in order to monitor the load element. This is the case in par¬ticular when the load element is in the form of a braking resis¬tor. This provides a simple and direct measurement capability for the load state. Alternatively, however, it is also possible to provide an estimation device for the load state in order to avoid additional sensor systems. This is designed to determine a measure for the thermal load state of the energy store from a voltage signal from the electrical energy store and from the output signal from the controller. In order to allow the load state of the load element to be determined better not only in<br><br>
the case of load peaks which occur briefly but also in the case of loads occuring over a relatively long time, the estimation device expediently has a low-pass filter element whose time con¬stant is chosen such that it corresponds to the thermal time constant of the load element. This allows an integration func¬tion to be provided in a simple and expedient manner in order to allow the load to be borne by the load element to be detected even over a relatively long time period. A comparison device is preferably also provided, to one of whose inputs an output of the low-pass filter element is applied, and to whose other input a temperature limit value signal is applied. It is designed to output an output signal when the limit temperature is exceeded, as a result of which the protective module reduces the current through the shunt path, or even decreases it to zero.<br>
The invention also relates to a method having the features of the independent method claim. Reference should be made to the above statements in order to.explain the method of operation.<br>

A wind energy installation according to the invention, annotated in its entirety by the reference number 1, comprises a tower 10 with a pod 11 arranged at its upper end such that it can rotate on the azimuth plane. A rotor 2 is arranged on one end face of the pod 11, such that it can rotate about a rotor shaft 20, The rotor 2 comprises a plurality of rotor blades 21 {2 in the il¬lustrated example). A rotor blade hub 22 connects the rotor blades 21 to the rotor shaft 20, which drives a generator 13,<br><br>
which is arranged in the pod 11, in order to produce electrical energy. The electrical energy is passed to a converter 14 and is output to an electrical grid system 9 via a three-phase line (only one phase of which is illustrated) 15 and a transformer 16. A control device 18 for the wind energy installation 1 is furthermore also arranged in the pod 11 and is used in a manner known per se for system management of the wind energy installa¬tion.<br>
The rotor blades 21 are arranged on the hub 22 in such a way that their pitch angle 9 is adjustable. A pitch adjustment device 3 is provided in order to adjust the pitch angle and comprises blade pitch control motors 55 which are arranged in the region of the root of the respective rotor blade 21. The pitch adjust¬ment device has an emergency pitch adjustment module 5 which is designed to provide emergency pitch adjustment for the rotor blades 21 even in the event of failure of the grid system 9 or in the event of a fault in the power supply to the rotor blade hub 22. In order to provide sufficient electrical power, an autonomous electrical energy store is provided in the rotor blade hub 22, and in the illustrated exemplary embodiment is in the form of a rechargeable battery 50.<br>
The design and method of operation of the pitch adjustment de¬vice during emergency operation will now be explained with ref¬erence to figure 2. The pitch adjustment device, which is anno¬tated in its totality with the reference number 5, for emergency operation comprises a battery contactor 51 via which the re¬chargeable battery 50 is connected to connecting lines 52, and further via a motor contactor 54 to the blade pitch control mo¬tor 55. The invention provides for the pitch adjustment device 5 to be operated as follows during emergency operation. Electrical energy which is provided by the rechargeable battery 50 flows via the battery contactor 51 and the connecting lines 52 to the<br><br>
motor contactor 54, and to the blade pitch control motor 55. The motor, through which current is passed in this way, rotates the rotor blade 21 associated with it (or a plurality of rotor blades 21 associated with it in the case of a central pitch mo¬tor) , to be precise generally to the windmilling position of the rotor blades 21, which is intended to stop the wind energy in¬stallation. Aerodynamic loads can be produced because of the wind forces acting on the rotor blades 21, resulting in the ro¬tor blade 21 being moved more quickly in the direction of the windmilling position than corresponding to the rotation speed of the blade pitch control motor 55. In consequence, the blade pitch control motor 55 starts to overrun. While overrunning in this way, it acts like a generator and can produce a current which is illustrated as the motor current IME in figure 2. Con¬ventionally, this motor current which is produced by the blade pitch control motor 55 during overrunning would be passed via the connecting lines 52 and the battery contactor 51 into the rechargeable battery 50, thus resulting in the rechargeable bat¬tery 50 being charged. Since these may be relatively high cur¬rents, there is the risk of damaging high-current charging of the rechargeable battery 50. There is also the risk during over¬running of magnetic saturation occurring in the blade pitch con¬trol motor 55, which would result in its operating characteris¬tic being shifted such that its no-load rotation speed would rise undesirably.<br>
In order to avoid this, the invention provides a current mirror device 6, which is switched such that a shunt path 60 is con¬nected between the connecting lines 52, The current mirror de¬vice 6 is arranged in the shunt path 60. The design and method of operation of the current mirror device 6 will be explained in more detail in the following text.<br><br>
A particularly simple version, but which is completely adequate for the purpose according to the invention, of a current mirror device with passive components as  illustrated in the basic  lay¬out in figure 3 and in detail in figure 4 will be used for ex¬planatory purposes. A passive current mirror device 6' such as this comprises only resistors and transistors. The motor feed¬back current flowing via the connecting line 52 is measured by means of a current sensor 61. It is expedient for the current sensor 61 to be in the form of a transformer with a transforma¬tion ratio of 500:1. By way of example, if the motor feedback current is 50 A, it produces a control current of 0.1 A. The measurement sensor 61 is connected to a collector of a transis¬tor 77', whose emitter is connected to ground via a resistor 76'. A resistor 75' which leads to the collector, as well as a control connection 78', are connected to a base of the transis¬tor 77'. This circuit results in a voltage which is dependent on the current of the measurement sensor 61 being produced at the control connection 78', A switching transistor 73' is also pro¬vided and is preferably in the form of a Darlington power tran¬sistor (for balancing reasons, the transistor 77' is expediently likewise a Darlington power transistor). The collector of the switching transistor Is connected to the connecting line 52, and its emitter is connected via a load resistor 71' to ground. The collector-emitter path through the switching transistor 73' therefore forms a shunt path 60 for the rechargeable battery 50. The control connection 78' is connected to the base of the switching transistor 73'. The transistor 77' and the switching transistor 73' therefore have a common base potential. The load resistor 71' has a resistance value with respect to the resistor 75' corresponding to the inverse of the transformation ratio. With the above  transformation ratio of 500:1 and using, by  way of example a resistance of 50 ohm for the resistor 76', this means that the load resistor 71' has a value of 0.1 ohms. The current mirror device 6' illustrated in figure 4 is a conven-<br><br>
tional current mirror circuit which is designed such that its branch which contains the transistor 77' detects the motor cur¬rent IMR produced by the blade pitch control motor 55 when it is overrunning, and carries away a current Ig of equal magnitude via the shunt path 60, via the other branch which contains the load transistor 73^ Ideally, this means that all of the current which is produced by the blade pitch control motor 50 when it is over¬running is carried away via the shunt path 60, thanks to the current mirror device 6'. No current therefore flows to the re¬chargeable battery 50, that is to say the current IBR is zero. The rechargeable battery 50 is therefore protected against unde¬sirable high-current charging by the blade pitch control motor 55 when it is overrunning. Furthermore, the process according to the invention of carrying away the current that is produced by the blade pitch control motor 55 when it is overrunning means that the voltage between the connecting lines 52 and therefore the voltage on the blade pitch control motor 55 does not rise during overrunning, either. This avoids the undesirable increase in the no-load rotation speed of the blade pitch control motor 55 when overrunning, as a result of magnetic saturation phenom¬ena.<br>
In many cases, a simple current mirror device 6* such as this, and as illustrated in figure 3, is adequate for protection of the rechargeable battery 50 and in order to maintain advanta¬geous operating characteristics during emergency operation. Ac¬cording to one particularly advantageous aspect of the inven¬tion, which may be used for independent protection, it is, how¬ever, also possible to provide an extended current mirror device 6. This comprises an active controller 8 which operates a switching element 7 which is arranged in the shunt path 60. It should be noted that the controller 8 need not necessarily be in the form of a separate unit but can just as well be integrated<br><br>
in a control device, which is already provided, for system man¬agement 18.<br>
First of all, the design of the switching element 7 will be ex¬plained. Along the shunt path 60, this comprises a load resistor 71 and a semiconductor switch 73 which is arranged in series with it and is preferably in the form of an IGBT. A freewheeling diode 72 is also provided across the load resistor 71, for pro¬tection against voltage spikes. Furthermore, a capacitor 79 is provided and is used to make the current, which is clocked by the semiconductor switch, uniform. The load resistor 71 is used on the one hand, to dissipate the electrical power passed through the shunt path 60, and on the other hand for protection of the semiconductor switch 73 against overloading. This means that the value of the load resistor 71 must be chosen to be at least sufficiently high that the maximum permissible current through the semiconductor switch 7 3 is not exceeded at the maxi¬mum voltage of the rechargeable battery 50. On the other hand, the resistance must be chosen to be sufficiently small that a minimum current is still achieved in the shunt.path 60 even when the voltage of the rechargeable battery 50 is reduced. A resis¬tance value of R = 10 Q has been proven for a pitch adjustment device with a rechargeable battery with an end-of-charge voltage of 320 V and an internal resistance of 0.5 Q.   The IGBT which is used as the semiconductor switch 73 has a control connection 78, to which the control device of the extended current mirror de¬vice 6 is connected.<br>
The controller 8 has a main module 80 and, as an output stage, a clock generator which is preferably in the form of a pulse-width modulator 89. The output of the pulse-width modulator 89 passes an output signal A via a connecting line 88 to the control input 78 of the semiconductor switch element 73. The pulse-width modu¬lator 8 9 is designed to produce a clock signal of a frequency<br><br>
of, for example, 4 kHz for a normalized control signal S (which may assume values between 0 and 1), and.  to vary the duty ratio of the clock signal between 0 and 100% as a function of the mag¬nitude of the normalized control signal. In this case, the pulse-width modulator 89 preferably carries out a linear conver¬sion process. A measurement sensor for the motor feedback cur¬rent 61 and a measurement sensor for the voltage 62 are each provided as an input signal to the main module 80. The main mod¬ule 80 operates in such a way that it determines the control signal S for the pulse-width modulator 89 based on the current value measured by the sensor 61, in which case various correc¬tion factors can be taken into account. One correction factor is the setting of an offset. An offset module 83 is provided for this purpose. The use of the offset module 83 to set an offset means that a specific current (the offset current) flows through the shunt path 60 even when the blade pitch control motor 55 is not overrunning. The offset current results in a defined load on the rechargeable battery 50, and this has the desirable effect that the voltage across the rechargeable battery 50 can be re¬duced quickly from the comparatively high end-of-charge voltage to the rated voltage. The rated voltage forms a stable operating point for the rechargeable battery 50, since the voltage de¬creases only slowly as the rechargeable battery 50 is progres¬sively discharged. A blanking module 84 expediently interacts with the offset module 83 and is designed to reduce the offset current when there is a high load on the rechargeable battery 50, to be precise if necessary down to a value of zero. This en¬sures that the full power of the rechargeable battery 50 is available when it is required to drive the blade pitch control motor 55.<br>
Furthermore, a gradient control module 85 is provided and is used to linearly vary the ratio of the mirror current in the shunt path 60 with respect to the feedback current produced by<br><br>
the blade pitch control motor 55. Normally, this change results in an increase in the mirror current, although a reduction should not be completely precluded. An increase in the mirror current by means of the gradient control module 85 makes it pos¬sible to produce a buffer for tolerances relating to the meas¬urement of the feedback current or other variables. This ensures that, even under the influence of tolerances or measurement in¬accuracies, the current in the shunt path is always sufficiently high to absorb the feedback current produced by the blade pitch control motor 55. This ensures, even in difficult circumstances, that the rechargeable battery 50 is not charged by the feedback current.<br>
Furthermore, a compensation module 82 can expediently be pro¬vided, and is designed to introduce a correction factor into the calculation of the control signal, in order to compensate for fluctuations in the instantaneous voltage of the rechargeable battery 50. This makes it possible to compensate for fluctua¬tions in the current in the shunt path 60 caused by a change in the voltage of the rechargeable battery 50. In order to detect the voltage of the rechargeable battery 50, the compensation module 82 is expediently connected to the voltage sensor 62.<br>
Furthermore, a protective module 81 can be provided in the main module 80, and is designed to reduce the current in the shunt path 60 as a function of a load state of the load resistor 71. For this purpose, a temperature sensor 74 may be arranged on the load resistor. If the temperature on the load resistor 71 threatens to exceed an impermissibly high level, which would thus lead to overloading on the load resistor 71, then the pro¬tective module 81 is used to limit the mirror current in the shunt path 60, if necessary. This is based on the knowledge that it may be better to accept a temporary reduction in the mirror current than to risk a failure of the mirror device overall as a<br><br>
result of destruction of the load resistor 71. - Howeverr it is not absolutely essential to use a costly temperature sensor 74 for the load resistor 71. It is also possible to provide for the load state of the load resistor 71 to be estimated from previous measurement variables. An appropriate estimation device 86 can be provided for this purpose.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a schematic diagram which comprises a meas¬urement of the voltage of the rechargeable battery 50, prefera¬bly by means of the measurement sensor 62, and also detection of the operating signal A by means of the switching,element 73, for example of the line 88. Based on these input variables, a calcu¬lation unit 811 determines a power signal, for example by squar¬ing the measured voltage divided by the value of the load resis¬tor 71 multiplied by the duty ratio of the operating signal A, This is a measure of the power dissipated in the load resistor 71. A temperature difference signal AT can be determined by means of a multiplication element 812, taking account of a pa¬rameter for the thermal resistance. This is a measure of the theoretically resulting steady-state temperature increase. A low-pass filter element 813 can be provided in order to take ac¬count of the dynamics, and takes into account the thermal time constant of the load resistor 71. A measure of the dynamic tem¬perature increase is then produced at its output and is applied to one input of a comparator 814, to whose other input a measure of the maximum permissible limit temperature increase ATmax is applied. If the actual dynamic temperature increase exceeds this limit value, then the comparator outputs a signal which causes the protective module 81 to trip. No additional temperature sen¬sors 74 are required for the load resistor 71 when using this calculation.<br>
The fundamental method of operation of the main module 80 is il¬lustrated in a summarized form in figure 8, A measure of the mo-<br><br>
tor feedback current IMR is used, as an input variable. An addi¬tionally flowing basic current G in the shunt path 60 is added by means of the offset module 83. A gain factor k for the cur¬rent mirror characteristic is set by means of the gradient con¬trol module 85. If normalized variables are used for the calcu¬lation, then limiting is carried out in the range between 0 and 1. Any reduction in the voltage from the rechargeable battery 50 starting from the rated voltage is taken into account by means of the compensation module 82. This results in an increase in the control signal S and thus in the operating signal A when the voltage of the rechargeable battery 50 falls. After limiting to the range 0 to 1 again, an output signal S of the main module 80 is formed and is applied to the input of the pulse-width modula¬tor 89. This uses the normalized control signal S to form a fixed-frequency operating signal A, whose duty ratio is governed by the magnitude of the control signal.<br>
The following text will make use of various characteristics in order to explain the way in which the extended current mirror according to the invention can be operated with and without con¬sideration of the additional modules.<br>
Figure 9 shows the characteristic of the pure current mirror, as results, for example, for the simple embodiment shown.in figure 3. The motor feedback current IMR is shown as a normalized value on the abscissa, and the current Is in the shunt path is shown, likewise as a normalized value, on the ordinate. If no feedback current IMR is flowing, its value is therefore 0 or less and, in a corresponding manner, the mirror current through the shunt path 60 is likewise 0. When the feedback current IMR rises, then the mirror current Is flowing through the shunt path 60 therefore increases linearly until, finally, the norm value is in each case reached. Even this basic function of the current mirror en-<br><br>
sures protection of the rechargeable battery 50 against damaging high-current charges during overrunning.<br>
Figure 10 shows a characteristic for an extended current mirror as shown in figure 2. As in figure 9, the motor feedback current and the current in the shunt path are illustrated in a normal¬ized form. In addition, the offset module 83 is provided and shifts the characteristic to the left on the graph. This means that, even when the motor feedback current IMR is 0, a current with a magnitude of 0.2 (a normalized current in the illustrated example) already flows in the shunt path 60. If a motor feedback current also occurs, then the current in the shunt path 60 is increased correspondingly linearly, by virtue of the current mirror device 6.<br>
Figure 11 shows another variant. As in figure 9, the motor feed¬back current and the current in the shunt path are shown in a normalized form. The gradient control module 85 is additionally provided in this case. This leads to the mirror current being amplified by a constant factor when a motor feedback current oc¬curs. More current therefore flows through the shunt path 60 than is produced by the blade pitch control motor 55 when over¬running. This means that no feedback current can flow to the re¬chargeable battery 50, even when tolerances are taken into ac¬count .<br>
Figure 12a) shows a characteristic which results when the offset module 83 and the compensation module 87 are taken into account. The offset module.83 results in the characteristic being shifted to the left {cf the dashed rising characteristic). Furthermore, the compensation module 81 is provided. This leads to the cur¬rent being completely maintained in the shunt path 60 when the voltage of the rechargeable battery 50 is below the rated volt¬age, and not being reduced corresponding to the reduced voltage.<br><br>
Figure 12b) shows the corresponding control signal S which is transmitted from the main module 8 0 to the pulse-width modulator 89. The solid line illustrates the situation when the voltage of the rechargeable battery 50 corresponds to the rated voltage, and  the dashed line corresponds to the situation when the volt¬age is less.<br>
Finally, by way of example, figure 13 shows the effect of the two embodiments illustrated in figures 2 and 3. The solid line shows the embodiment as shown in figure 3 with a simple current mirror. As long as the blade pitch control motor 55 receives current from the rechargeable battery 50 {IMR is negative), no current Ig flows in the shunt path 60 (see the solid curve in the left-hand section of figures a), b) and c)). A mirror current Is flows through the shunt path 60 only when the motor feedback current IMR becomes positive. The magnitude of this mirror cur¬rent Is corresponds precisely to the positive component of the motor feedback current, as a result of which no current flows to the rechargeable battery 50 (see the central area in the graphs a), b) and c)). - The right-hand area corresponds to the left-hand area.<br>
The dashed-dotted curve shows the current flow in the shunt path in the second embodiment as shown in figure 2. In this embodi¬ment with the so-called "extended current mirror", the offset module 6 3 results in a basic current always flowing through the shunt path 60 when the blade pitch control motor 55 is producing a feedback current IMR when overrunning, or when the current -IMR driving the motor exceeds a magnitude of -0.2 of the normalized motor current. This ensures that a discharge current flows,out of the rechargeable battery 50 even when the motor is overrun¬ning.<br><br><br>
