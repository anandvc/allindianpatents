				<td>This invention relates to a process for the conversion of Heavy Normal Parafins (HNP) to LPG and liquid transportation fuels.<br>
Heavy ricrm.i.1 paraffins are utilized commercially for the production of internal olefins by catalytic dehydrogenaticn (molex process) and sec-alcohols by boric acid protected oxidation (Easkhirov process). However, these paraffins can be cracked in presence of a suitable acidic catalyst and the products formed are LPG and liquid transportation fuel. Conventional methods for the production of LPG and liquid transportation fuel are through distillation of crude oil, catalytic and steam cracking  of  vacuum gas   oil   naphth  as   feedstocks.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the conversion of heavy normal praffins (C 14 to C 18 range) to LPG and liquid hydrocarbon type of fuel using dealumi-nated  zeolite-Y  as   a   catalyst.<br>
We have developed a process for the conversion of heavy normal<br>
paraffins to LPG and liquid fuel by catalyatic cracking in<br>
presence of dealuminated zeolite-Y.. The reaction conditions are:<br>
Temperature	-   2 85   to   410      °   C<br>
Weight   Hourly  Space  Velocity   (WHSV)	-   16   to   160   h-1<br>
Reaction Time	-     20   to   15C   seconds.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the conversion of heavy normal paraffin's (HNP) in C14 to C18 range to LPG and liquid transportation fuel which comprises reacting neavy normal paraffin's C14- CI8 with the dealuminated zeolite-Y as a catalyst at a temperature in the range of 285-410°C, space velocity in the range of 16 - 160IT1 for a period ranging from 20-150 sec. if desired separating LPG and liquid transportation fuel by conventional methods.<br>
kerosene and diesel fractions. The gaseous products are LPG, trace amounts of dry gas (H2 + C1, + C2) • Small amount of coke is also produced as by product during the reaction.<br>
Heavy normal paraffins, n-paraffin mixture in the range of<br>
C14 to Cl8 produced by Indian petrochyemical Limited, Baroda,<br>
India with the following characteristics was used as the feed.<br>
Bioling range	:     260-340° C<br>
Composition (wt%) C14 - 16.6 C15 - 38.5 C16 - 24.8 C1? - 12.8 C18 - 5.3 C18 - 1.9 Aromatics   -       0.1<br>
Zeolite Y dealuminated to levels of 40 and 60% was used as catalyst. The novel zeolite Y delauminated catalysts is subject matter of our co-pending patent application No. 1247/Del/95 .-<br>
Cracking experiments were conducted in a micro processor controlled auto MAT fixed bed unit with facility to estimate the coke make in situ. The dealuminated zeolite -Y sample (0.5 ± 0.02g) diluted by quartz powder (1.5g, 80-100 mesh) was loaded in the reactor. The catalyst bed was heated to 300 ± 2°C in a stream of nitrogen (30 cm-3 min ) for 15 minutes. A constant quantity (1.285 ± 0.05 g) of the paraffin feed preheated to 200°C was injected   into the reactor while varying the time on stream.<br>
The catalyst bed was then stripped with nitrogen (3 0cm° min -1) for 15 minutes. The liquid product was collected in an ice cooled receiver and analysed by simulated distillation gas  chro-nanagraaphg. Thegaseous product were analysed by gas chromatography using a squalane column at ambient temperature. The coke laden catalyst was regenerated at 650°C in a stream of air (50 cm3 min-1 ) for 30 minutes or so, till the carbon dioxide content in the outgoing flue gases was less than 0.1 %. The gaseous enroute were, passed through a converter at 450°C containing cupric oxide to oxidise any carbon monooxide to carbon dioxide. The yield of coke was computed from the flow rate of the flue gases at the exist and the carbon dioxide content monitored by an on-line IR analyser.<br>
Cracked product consists of trace amount of dry gas (a mixture of H2 + C1, + C2) , LPG (a mixture of C3 and C4) , hydrocar bons boiling in gasoline range (IBP-150°C). The FBP of the cracked liquid product was around 320-330°C and the product boiling in the range of 150-330°C is suitable for use as kerosene and diesel. Reactions like isomerisation, H-transfer and cyclisa-tion occur to a significant extent. The liquid product will be a mixture of normal and isopraffins, olefins, naphthenes and aro-matics in varying amount. This makes the gasoline boiling range product rich in olefins and aromatics which are potential contributor to octane number. H-transfer reaction is known to be suppressed duringing catalytic cracking in presence of delaumi-nated zeolite-Y. The diesel range product has limited concentration of aromatics, which guards the product cetane value within acceptable limit. The LPG produced is highly olefinic which makes it guite useful as the raw material for a number of petrochemical products.<br>
The following examples illustrate the process of invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
