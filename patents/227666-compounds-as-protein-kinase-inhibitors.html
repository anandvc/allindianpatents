TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to inhibitors of protein kinases. The invention also<br>
provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of the invention and methods<br>
of using the compositions in the treatment of various disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by a<br>
better understanding of the structure of enzymes and other biomolecules associated with<br>
diseases. One important class of enzymes that has been the subject of extensive study is protein<br>
kinases.<br>
[0004] Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that arc<br>
responsible for the control of a variety of signal transduction processes within the cell. (Sec,<br>
Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book, I and II, Academic Press, San Diego,<br>
CA: 1995).' Protein kinases are thought to have evolved from a common ancestral gene due to<br>
the conservation of their structure and catalytic function. Almost all kinases contain a similar<br>
250-300 amino acid catalytic domain. The kinases may be categorized into families by the<br>
substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.).<br>
Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these kinase families<br>
(See, for example. Hanks, S.K., Hunter, T, FASEB J. 1995, 9, 576-596; Knighton et ai, Science<br><br>
1991, 253, 407-414; Hiles et al., Cell 1992, 70, 419-429; Kunz et al, Cell 1993, 73, 585-596;<br>
Garcia-Bustos et al., EMBOJ. 1994,13, 2352-2361).<br>
[0005] In general, protein kinases mediate intracellular signaling by effecting a phosphoryl<br>
transfer from a nucleoside triphosphate to a protein acceptor that is involved in a signaling<br>
pathway. These phosphorylation events act as molecular on/off switches that can modulate or<br>
regulate the target protein biological function. These phosphorylation events are ultimately<br>
triggered in response to a variety of extracellular and other stimuli. Examples of such stimuli<br>
include environmental and chemical stress signals (e.g., osmotic shock, heat shock, ultraviolet<br>
radiation, bacterial endotoxin, and H2O2), cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor<br>
necrosis factor a (TNF-α)), and growth factors (e.g., granulocyte macrophage-colony-<br>
stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)). An extracellular stimulus<br>
may affect one or more cellular responses related to cell growth, migration, differentiation,<br>
secretion of hormones, activation of transcription factors, muscle contraction, glucose<br>
metabolism, control of protein synthesis, and regulation of the cell cycle.<br>
[0006] Many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by protein<br>
kinase-mediated events as described above. These diseases include, but are not limited to,<br>
autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological<br>
and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and asthma,<br>
Alzheimer's disease, and hormone-related diseases. Accordingly, there has been a substantial<br>
effort in medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that arc effective as therapeutic<br>
agents.<br>
[0007] A family of type III receptor tyrosine kinases including Flt3, c-Kit, PDGF-receptor<br>
and c-Fms play an important role in the maintenance, growth and development of hematopoietic<br>
and non-hematopoietic cells. [Scheijen, B, Griffin JD, Oncogene, 2002, 21, 3314-3333 and<br>
Reilly, JT, British Journal of Haematology, 2002, 116, 744-757]. FLT-3 and c-Kit regulate<br>
maintenance of stem cell/early progenitor pools as well the development of mature lymphoid<br>
and myeloid cells [Lyman, S, Jacobsen, S, Blood, 1998, 91, 1101-1134]. Both receptors contain<br>
an intrinsic kinase domain that is activated upon ligand-mediated dimerization of the receptors.<br>
Upon activation, the kinase domain induces autophosphorylation of the receptor as well as the<br>
phosphorylation of various cytoplasmic proteins that help propogate the activation signal leading<br>
to growth, differentiation and survival. Some of the downstream regulators of FLT-3 and c-Kit<br><br>
receptor signaling incjude, PLCγ, PI3-kinase, Grb-2, SHIP and Src related kinases (Scheijen, B,<br>
Griffin JD, Oncogene, 2002, 21, 3314-3333]. Both receptor tyrosine kinases have been shown<br>
to play a role in a variety of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic malignancies. Mutations that<br>
induce ligand independent activation of FLT-3 and c-Kit have been implicated acute-<br>
myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), mastocytosis and<br>
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). These mutations include single amino acid changes in<br>
the kinase domain or internal tandem duplications, point mutations or in-frame deletions of the<br>
juxtamembrane region of the receptors. In addition to activating mutations, ligand dependent<br>
(autocrine or paracrine) stimulation of over-expressed wild-type FLT-3 or c-Kit can contribute to<br>
the malignant phenotype [Scheijen, B, Griffin JD, Oncogene, 2002, 21, 3314-3333].<br>
[0008] c-fms encodes for macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (M-CSF-1R) which<br>
is expressed predominately in the monocytes/macrophage lineage [Dai, XM et al.. Blood, 2002,<br>
99, 111-120]. MCSF-1R and its ligand regulate macrophage lineage growth and differentiation.<br>
Like the other family members, MCSF-1R contains an intrinsic kinase domain that is activated<br>
upon ligand-induced dimerization of the receptor. MCSF-1R is is also expressed in non-<br>
hematopoietic cells including mammary gland epithelial cells and neurons. Mutations in this<br>
receptor are potentially linked to myeloid leukemias and its expression is correlated with<br>
metastatic breast, ovarian and endometrial carcinomas [Reilly, JT, British Journal of<br>
Haematology, 2002,116, 744-757 and Kacinski, BM, Mol. Reprod and Devel., 1997,46, 71-74].<br>
Another possible indication for antagonists of MCSF-1R is osteoporosis [Teitelbaum, S, Science<br>
2000, 289, 1504-1508.<br>
[0009] PDGF-receptor (PDGFR) has two subunits- PDGFR-α and PDGRR-β which can<br>
form homo or heterodimers upon ligand binding. There are several PDGF ligands: AB, BB, CC<br>
and DD. PDGFR is expressed on early stem cells, mast cells, myeloid cells, mesenchymal cells<br>
and smooth muscle cells [Scheijen, B, Griffin JD, Oncogene, 2002, 21, 3314-3333]. Only<br>
PDGFR-β has been implicated in myeloid leukemias- usually as a translocation partner with Tel,<br>
Huntingtin interacting protein (HJJP1) or Rabaptin5. Recently it was shown that activation<br>
mutations in PDGFR-cc kinase domain arc in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) [Heinrich,<br>
MC et al., Sciencexpress, 2003]<br>
[0010] Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases consisting of a<br>
(5-sheet rich amino-terminal lobe and a larger carboxy-terminal lobe that is largely α-helical.<br><br>
The CDKs display the 11 subdomains shared by all protein kinases and range in molecular mass<br>
from 33 to 44 kD. This family of kinases, which includes CDK1, CKD2, CDK4, and CDK6,<br>
requires phosphorylation at the residue corresponding to CDK2 Thrl60 in order to be fully active<br>
[Meyer, L., Drug Resistance Updates 2000,3, 83-88].<br>
[0011] Each CDK complex is formed from a regulatory cyclin subunit (e.g., cyclin A, B1,<br>
B2, Dl, D2, D3, and E) and a catalytic kinase subunit (e.g., CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, and<br>
CDK6). Each different kinase/cyclin pair functions to regulate the different and specific phases<br>
of the cell cycle known as the G1, S, G2, and M phases [Nigg, E., Nature Reviews 2001, 2, 21-<br>
32; Flatt, P., Pietenpol, J., Drug Metabolism Reviews 2000, 32, 283-305].<br>
[0012] The CDKs have been implicated in cell proliferation disorders, particularly in cancer.<br>
Cell proliferation is a result of the direct or indirect deregulation of the cell division cycle and the<br>
CDKs play a critical role in the regulation of the various phases of this cycle. For example, the<br>
over-expression of cyclin Dl is commonly associated with numerous human cancers including<br>
breast, colon, hepatocellular carcinomas and gliomas [Flatt, P., Pietenpol, J., Drug Metabolism<br>
Reviews 2000, 32, 283-305]. The CDK2/cyclin E complex plays a key role in the progression<br>
from the early G1 to S phases of the cell cycle and the overexpression of cyclin E has been<br>
associated with various solid tumors. Therefore, inhibitors of cyclins Dl, E, or their associated<br>
CDKs arc useful targets for cancer therapy [Kaubisch, A., Schwartz, G., The Cancer Journal<br>
2000,6,192-212].<br>
[0013] CDKs, especially CDK2, also play a role in apoptosis and T-cell development.<br>
CDK2 has been identified as a key regulator of thymocyte apoptosis [Williams, O., et al,<br>
European Journal of Immunology 2000, 709-713]. Stimulation of CDK2 kinase activity is<br>
associated with the progression of apoptosis in thymocytes, in response to specific stimuli.<br>
Inhibition of CDK2 kinase activity blocks this apoptosis resulting in the protection of<br>
thymocytes.<br>
[0014] In addition to regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis, the CDKs are directly involved<br>
in the process of transcription. Numerous viruses require CDKs for their replication process.<br>
Examples where CDK inhibitors restrain viral replication include human cytomegakovirus,<br>
herpes virus, and varicella-zoster virus [Meijer, L., Drug Resistance Updates 2000, 3, 83-88].<br>
[0015] Inhibition of CDK is also useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such<br>
as Alzheimer's disease. The appearance of Paired Helical Filaments (PHF), associated with<br><br>
Alzheimer's disease, is caused by the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein by CDK5/p25<br>
[Meijer, L., Drug Resistance Updates, 2000 3, 83-88].<br>
[0016] Another kinase family of particular interest is the Src family of kinases. These<br>
kinases are implicated in cancer, immune system dysfunction and bone remodeling diseases. For<br>
general reviews, see Thomas and Brugge, Anna. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997, 13, 513; Lawrence<br>
and Niu, Pharmacol. Ther. 1998, 77, 81; Tatosyan and Mizenina, Biochemistry (Moscow) 2000,<br>
65,49; Boschelli et al. Drugs of the Future 2000, 25(7), 717, (2000).<br>
[0017] Members of the Src family include the following eight kinases in mammals: Src, Fyn,<br>
Yes, Fgr, Lyn, Hck, Lck, and Blk. These are nonreceptor protein kinases that range in molecular<br>
mass from 52 to 62 kD. All arc characterized by a common structural organization that is<br>
comprised of six distinct functional domains: Src homology domain 4 (SH4), a unique domain,<br>
SH3 domain, SH2 domain, a catalytic domain (SHI), and a C-terminal regulatory region.<br>
Tatosyan et al. Biochemistry (Moscow) 2000,65,49-58.<br>
[0018] Based on published studies, Src kinases are considered as potential therapeutic targets<br>
for various human diseases. Mice that are deficient in Src develop osteopetrosis, or bone build-<br>
up, because of depressed bone resorption by osteoclasts. This suggests that osteoporosis<br>
resulting from abnormally high bone resorption can be treated by inhibiting Src. Soriano et al.,<br>
Cell 1992,69,551 and Soriano et al., Cell 1991,64, 693.<br>
[0019] Suppression of arthritic bone destruction has been achieved by the overexpression of<br>
CSK in rheumatoid synoviocytes and osteoclasts. Takayanagi et al., J. Clin. Invest. 1999, 104,<br>
137. CSK, or C-terminal Src kinase, phosphorylates and thereby inhibits Src catalytic activity.<br>
This implies that Src inhibition may prevent joint destruction that is characteristic in patients<br>
suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. Boschelli et al., Drugs of the Future 2000,25(7), 717.<br>
[0020] Src also plays a role in the replication of hepatitis B virus. The virally encoded<br>
transcription factor HBx activates Src in a step required for propagation of the virus. KJein et al.,<br>
EMBOJ. 1999,18, 5019, and Klein et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997,17, (All.<br>
[0021] A number of studies have linked Src expression to cancers such as colon, breast,<br>
hepatic and pancreatic cancer, certain B-cell leukemias and lymphomas. Talamonti et al, J.<br>
Clin. Invest. 1993, 91, 53; Lutz et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. 1998 243, 503; Rosen et al., J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 1986, 261, 13754; Bolen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1987, 84, 2251; Masaki<br>
et al., Hepatology 1998. 27, 1257; Biscardi et al.. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999, 76, 61; Lynch et al.,<br><br>
Leukemia, 1993, 7, 1416. Furthermore, antisense Src expressed in ovarian and colon tumor cells<br>
has been shown to inhibit tumor growth. Wiener et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 1999, 5, 2164; Staley<br>
et al., Cell Growth Diff., 1997,8, 269.<br>
[0022] Other Src family kinases are also potential therapeutic targets. Lck plays a role in T-<br>
cell signaling. Mice that lack the Lck gene have a poor ability to develop thymocytes. The<br>
function of Lck as a positive activator of T-cell signaling suggests that Lck inhibitors may be<br>
useful for treating autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis. Molina et al., Nature, 1992,<br>
357, 161. Hck, Fgr and Lyn have been identified as important mediators of integrin signaling in<br>
myeloid leukocytes. Lowell et al., J. Leukoc. Biol., 1999, 65, 313. Inhibition of these kinase<br>
mediators may therefore be useful for treating inflammation. Boschelli et al., Drugs of the<br>
Future 2000,25(7), 717.<br>
[0023] Syk is a tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in FcεRI mediated mast cell<br>
degranulation and eosiniphil activation. Accordingly, Syk kinase is implicated in various<br>
allergic disorders, in particular asthma. It has been shown that Syk binds to the phosphorylatcd<br>
gamma chain of the FcεRI receptor via N-terminal SH2 domains and is essential for downstream<br>
signaling [Taylor et al, Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995, 75,4149].<br>
[0024] Inhibition of eosinophil apoptosis has been proposed as key mechanisms for the<br>
development of blood and tissue eosinophilia in asthma. IL-5 and GM-CSF are upregulated in<br>
asthma and are proposed to cause blood and tissue eosinophilia by inhibition of eosinophil<br>
apoptosis. Inhibition of eosinophil apoptosis has been proposed as a key mechanism for the<br>
development of blood and tissue eosinophilia in asthma. It has been reported that Syk kinase is<br>
required for the prevention of eosinophil apoptosis by cytokines (using antisensc)[Yousefi et al,<br>
J Exp Med 1996,183, 1407].<br>
[0025] The role of Syk in FcγR dependent and independent response in bone marrow derived<br>
macrophages has been determined by using irradiated mouse chimeras reconstituted with fetal<br>
liver cells from Syk -/- embryos. Syk deficient macrophages were defective in phagocytosis<br>
induced by FcyR but showed normal phagocytosis in response to complement [Kiefer et al, Mol<br>
Cell Biol 1998, 18, 4209]. It has also been reported that aerosolized Syk antisense suppresses<br>
Syk expression and mediator release from macrophages [Stenton et al, J Immunology 2000, 164,<br>
3790].<br><br>
[0026] The Janus kinases (JAK) are a family of tyrosine kinases consisting of JAK.1, JAK2,<br>
JAK3 and TYK2. The JAKs play a critical role in cytokine signaling. The down-stream<br>
substrates of the JAK family of kinases include the signal transducer and activator of<br>
transcription (STAT) proteins. JAK/STAT signaling has been implicated in the mediation of<br>
many abnormal immune responses such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases such as<br>
transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis as<br>
well as in solid and hematologic malignancies such as leukemias and lymphomas. The<br>
pharmaceutical intervention in the JAK/STAT pathway has been reviewed [Frank Mol. Med. 5,<br>
432-456 (1999) &amp; Seidel, et al, Oncogene 19, 2645-2656 (2000)].<br>
[0027] JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 are ubiquitously expressed, while JAK3 is predominantly<br>
expressed in hematopoietic cells. JAK3 binds exclusively to the common cytokine receptor<br>
gamma chain (γc) and is activated by EL-2, DL-4, EL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. The proliferation and<br>
survival of murine mast cells induced by IL-4 and IL-9 have, in fact, been shown to be<br>
dependent on JAK3- and γc- signaling [Suzuki et al, Blood 96, 2172-2180 (2000)].<br>
[0028] Cross-linking of the high-affinity immunoglobulin (Ig) E receptors of sensitized mast<br>
cells leads to a release of proinflammatory mediators, including a number of vasoactive<br>
cytokines resulting in acute allergic, or immediate (type I) hypersensitivity reactions [Gordon et<br>
al, Nature 346, 274-276 (1990) &amp; Galli, N. Engl. J. Med., 328, 257-265 (1993)]. A crucial role<br>
for JAK3 in IgE receptor-mediated mast cell responses in vitro and in vivo has been established<br>
[Malaviya, et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 257, 807-813 (1999)]. In addition, the<br>
prevention of type I hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, mediated by mast cell-<br>
activation through inhibition of JAX3 has also been reported [Malaviya et al, J. Biol. Chem.<br>
274,27028-27038 (1999)]. Targeting mast cells with JAK3 inhibitors modulated mast cell<br>
degranulation in vitro and prevented IgE receptor/antigen-mediated anaphylactic reactions in<br>
vivo.<br>
[0029] A recent study described the successful targeting of JAK3 for immune suppression<br>
and allograft acceptance. The study demonstrated a dose-dependent survival of Buffalo heart<br>
allograft in Wistar Furth recipients upon administration of inhibitors of JAK3 indicating the<br>
possibility of regulating unwanted immune responses in graft versus host disease [Kirken,<br>
Transpl. Proc. 33, 3268-3270 (2001)].<br><br>
[0030] IL-4-mediated STAT-phosphorylation has been implicated as the mechanism<br>
involved in early and late stages of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Up-regulation of proinflammatory<br>
cytokines in RA synovium and synovial fluid is a characteristic of the disease. It has been<br>
demostrated that EL-4-mediatcd activation of IL-4/STAT pathway is mediated through the Janus<br>
Kinases (JAK 1 &amp; 3) and that IL-4-associated JAK kinases are expressed in the RA synovium<br>
[Muller-Ladner, ct al, / Immunol. 164,3894-3901 (2000)].<br>
[0031] Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder<br>
affecting about 10% of ALS patients. The survival rates of FALS mice were increased upon<br>
treatment with a JAK3 specific inhibitor. This suggested that JAK3 plays a role in FALS [Trieu,<br>
et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 267, 22-25 (2000)].<br>
[0032] Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are activated by,<br>
among others, the JAK family kinases. Results form a recent study suggested the possibility of<br>
intervention in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by targeting JAK family kinases with specific<br>
inhibitors for the treatment of leukemia [Sudbeck, et al, Clin. Cancer Res. 5, 1569-1582 (1999)].<br>
JAK3 specific compounds were shown to inhibit the clonogenic growdi of JAK3-expressing cell<br>
lines DAUDI, RAMOS, LCI; 19, NALM-6, MOLT-3 and HL-60.<br>
[0033] In animal models, TEL/JAK2 fusion proteins have induced myeloproliferative<br>
disorders and in hematopoietic cell lines, introduction of TEL/JAK2 resulted in activation of<br>
STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and cytokine-independent growth [Schwaller, et al, EMBO J. 17,<br>
5321-5333 (1998)].<br>
[0034] Inhibition of JAK 3 and TYK 2 abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, and<br>
inhibited cell growth of mycosis fungoides, a form of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. These results<br>
implicated JAK family kinases in the constitutively activated JAK/STAT pathway that is present<br>
in mycosis fungoides [Nielsen, et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94, 6764-6769 (1997)].<br>
Similarly, STAT3, STAT5, JAK1 and JAK2 were demonstrated to be constitutively activated in<br>
mouse T cell lymphoma characterized initially by LCK over-expression, thus further implicating<br>
the JAK/STAT pathway in abnormal cell growth [Yu, et al, J. Immunol. 159, 5206-5210 (1997)].<br>
In addition, IL-6 -mediated STAT3 activation was blocked by an inhibitor of JAK, leading to<br>
sensitization of myeloma cells to apoptosis [Catlett-Falcone, et al. Immunity 10,105-115 (1999)].<br>
[0035] One kinase family of interest is Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein<br>
serine/threonine kinase (ROCK), which is believed to be an effector of Ras-related small GTPase<br><br>
Rho. The ROCK family includes pl60ROCK (ROCK-1) (Ishizaki et al., EMBO J. 1996, 15,<br>
1885-1893) and ROKot/Rho-kinase/ROCK-II (Leung et al, J. Biol. Chem. 1995, 270, 29051-<br>
29054; Matsui et al., EMBO J. 1996, 15, 2208-2216; Nakagawa et al., FEBS Lett. 1996, 392,<br>
189-193), protein kinase PKN (Amano et al. Science 1996, 271, 648-650; Watanabe et al.,<br>
Science 1996, 271, 645-648), and citron and citron kinase (Madaule et al. Nature, 1998, 394,<br>
49M94; Madaule et al., FEBS Lett. 1995, 377, 243-248). The ROCK family of kinases have<br>
been shown to be involved in a variety of functions including Rho-induced formation of actin<br>
stress fibers and focal adhesions (Leung et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 1996, 16, 5313-5327; Amano et<br>
al., Science, 1997, 275, 1308-1311; Ishizaki et al., FEBS Utt. 1997, 404, 118-124) and in<br>
downregulation of myosin phosphatase (Kimura et al., Science, 1996, 273, 245-248), platelet<br>
activation (Klages et al., J. Cell. Biol., 1999,144, 745-754), aortic smooth muscle contraction by<br>

1999, 516, 67-74), neurite retraction (Hirose et al., J. Cell. Biol.. 1998, 141, 1625-1636),<br>
neutrophil chemotaxis (Niggli, FEBS Lett., 1999, 445, 69-72), wound healing (Nobes and Hall,<br>

and cell transformation (Sahai et al., Curr. Biol., 1999, 9, 136-145). More specifically, ROCK<br>
has been implicated in various diseases and disorders including hypertension (Satoh et al., J.<br>

Acta 2002, 1590, 123-130). Accordingly, the development of inhibitors of ROCK kinase would<br>
be useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of disorders implicated in the ROCK kinase<br>
pathway.<br>
[0036] ERK2 (extracellular signal regulated kinase) is a member of the mammalian mitogen-<br>
activated protein (MAP)l kinase family. (MAP)l kinases are serine/threonine kinases that<br>
mediate intracellular signal transduction pathways (Cobb and Goldsmith, J Biol. Chem., 1995,<br>
270, 14843; Davis, Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995, 42, 459) and are activated by mitogens and growth<br>
factors (Bokemeyer et al. Kidney Int. 1996, 49, 1187). Members of the MAP kinase family<br>
share sequence similarity and conserved structural domains, and, in addition to ERK2, include<br>
the JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase), and p38 kinases. JNKs and p38 kinases are activated in<br><br>
response to the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and intcrleukin-1, and by cellular stress<br>
such as heat shock, hyperosmolarity, ultraviolet radiation, lipopolysaccharides and inhibitors of<br>
protein synthesis (Derijard et al.. Cell 1994, 76, 1025; Han et al., Science 1994, 265, 808;<br>
Raingeaud et al., J Biol. Chem. 1995, 270, 7420; Shapiro and Dinarcllo, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 1995, 92, 12230). In contrast, ERKs are activated by mitogens and growth factors<br>
(Bokemeyer et al.. Kidney Int. 1996,49, 1187).<br>
[0037] ERK2 is a widely distributed protein kinase that achieves maximum activity when<br>
both Thrl83 and Tyrl85 are phosphorylated by the upstream MAP kinase kinase, MEK1<br>
(Anderson et al., Nature 1990, 343, 651; Crews et al., Science 1992, 258, 478). Upon activation,<br>
ERK2 phosphorylates many regulatory proteins, including the protein kinases Rsk90 (Bjorbaek<br>
et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1995, 270, 18848) and MAPKAP2 (Rouse et al., Cell 1994, 78, 1027), and<br>
transcription factors such as ATF2 (Raingeaud et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 1996, 16, 1247), Elk-1<br>
(Raingeaud et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 1996,16, 1247), c-Fos (Chen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA<br>
1993,90,10952), and c-Myc (Oliver et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995, 210, 162). ERK2 is<br>
also a downstream target of the Ras/Raf dependent pathways (Moodie et al.. Science 1993, 260,<br>
1658) and may help relay the signals from these potentially oncogenic proteins. ERK2 has been<br>
shown to play a role in the negative growth control of breast cancer cells (Frey and Mulder,<br>
Cancer Res. 1993, 57, 628) and hyperexpression of ERK2 in human breast cancer has been<br>
reported (Sivaraman et al., J Clin. Invest. 1997, 99, 1478). Activated ERK2 has also been<br>
implicated in the proliferation of endothelin-stimulatcd airway smooth muscle cells, suggesting a<br>
role for this kinase in asthma (Whelchel et al.. Am. J. Respir. Cell MoL Biol. 1997,16, 589).<br>
[0038] Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase comprised<br>
of α and β isoforms that are each encoded by distinct genes [Coghlan et al., Chemistry &amp;<br>
Biology 2000, 7, 793-803; and Kim and Kimmcl, Curr. Opinion Genetics Dev., 2000 10, 508-<br>
514]. GSK-3 has been implicated in various diseases including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease,<br>
CNS disorders such as manic depressive disorder and neurodegenerative diseases, and<br>
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy [PCT Application Nos.: WO 99/65897 and WO 00/38675; and Haq<br>
et al., J. Cell Biol. 2000, 151, 117-130]. These diseases are associated with the abnormal<br>
operation of certain cell signaling pathways in which GSK-3 plays a role. GSK-3 has been<br>
found to phosphorylate and modulate the activity of a number of regulatory proteins. These<br>
proteins include glycogen synthase, which is the rate limiting enzyme necessary for glycogen<br><br>
synthesis, the microtubule associated protein Tau, the gene transcription factor β-catenin, the<br>
translation initiation factor elF2B, as well as ATP citrate lyase, axin, heat shock factor-1, c-Jun,<br>
c-myc, c-myb, CREB, and CEPBα. These diverse protein targets implicate GSK-3 in many<br>
aspects of cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and development.<br>
[0039] In a GSK-3 mediated pathway that is relevant for the treatment of type II diabetes,<br>
insulin-induced signaling leads to cellular glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. Along this<br>
pathway, GSK-3 is a negative regulator of the insulin-induced signal. Normally, the presence of<br>
insulin causes inhibition of GSK-3 mediated phosphorylation and deactivation of glycogen<br>
synthase. The inhibition of GSK-3 leads to increased glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake<br>
[Klein et al, PNAS 1996, 93, 8455-8459; Cross et al., Biochem. J. 1994, 303, 21-26); Cohen,<br>
Biochem, Soc. Trans. 1993, 21, 555-567; and Massillon el al., Biochem J. 1994, 299, 123-128].<br>
However, in a diabetic patient, where the insulin response is impaired, glycogen synthesis and<br>
glucose uptake fail to increase despite the presence of relatively high blood levels of insulin.<br>
This leads to abnormally high blood levels of glucose with acute and long- term effects that may<br>
ultimately result in cardiovascular disease, renal failure and blindness. In such patients, the<br>
normal insulin-induced inhibition of GSK-3 fails to occur. It has also been reported that in<br>
patients with type II diabetes, GSK-3 is overexpressed [see, PCT Application: WO 00/38675].<br>
Therapeutic inhibitors of GSK-3 are therefore potentially useful for treating diabetic patients<br>
suffering from an impaired response to insulin.<br>
[0040] GSK-3 activity is also associated with Alzheimer's disease. This disease is<br>
characterized by the well-known β-amyloid peptide and the formation of intracellular<br>
neurofibrillary tangles. Aβ peptides are derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by<br>
sequential proteolysis, catalysed by the aspartyl protease BACE2, followed by presenilin-<br>
dependent y-secretase cleavage. It has been demonstrated that antibodies against P-amyloid<br>
plaques can slow cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (Hock et al., Neuron,<br>
2003, 38, 547-554), and thus other P-amyloid-lowering strategies (e.g., the development of<br>
agents capable of inhibiting P-amyloid peptide) would be useful in the treatment of Alzherimer's<br>
disease and other psychotic and neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, the neurofibrillary<br>
tangles contain hyperphosphorylatcd Tau protein, in which Tau is phosphorylatcd on abnormal<br>
sites, and thus agents capble of inhibiting the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein would be<br><br>
useful in the treatment of Alzherimer's disease and other psychotic and neurodegenerative<br>
disorders.<br>
[0041] GSK-3 is known to phosphorylate these abnormal sites in cell and animal models.<br>
Furthermore, inhibition of GSK-3 has been shown to prevent hyperphosphorylation of Tau in<br>
cells [Lovestone et al.. Current Biology 1994, 4, 1077-86; and Brownlees et al., Neuroreport<br>
1997, 8, 3251-55]. Therefore, GSK-3 activity promotes generation of the neurofibrillary tangles<br>
and the progression of Alzheimer's disease. It has also been shown that GSK-3 facilitates APP<br>
processing and that a GSK-3 inhibitor (lithium) inhibits of the generation of Aβ peptides through<br>
the inhibition of GSK-3 (Phiel et al. Nature 2003, 423, 435-439). Thus, the development of<br>
inhibitors of GSK-3 would be useful for the reduction of the formation of amyloid plaques and<br>
neurofibrillry tangles, the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease, and would also be<br>
useful for the treament of other psychotic and neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
[0042] Another substrate of GSK-3 is β-catenin, which is degradated after phosphorylation<br>
by GSK-3. Reduced levels of β-catenin have been reported in schizophrenic patients and have<br>
also been associated with other diseases related to increase in neuronal cell death [Zhong et al..<br>
Nature 1998, 395, 698-702; Takashima et al., PNAS 1993, 90, 7789-93; and Pei et al., J.<br>
Neuropathol. Exp 1997,56, 70-78].<br>
[0043] GSK-3 activity is also associated with stroke [Wang et al.. Brain Res 2000, 559, 381-<br>
5; Sasaki et al., Neurol Res 2001. 23, 588-92; Hashimoto et al., J. Biol. Chem 2002,277, 32985-<br>
32991].<br>
[0044] The AGC sub-family of kinases phosphorylate their substrates at serine and threonine<br>
residues and participate in a variety of well-known signaling processes, including, but not<br>
limited to cyclic AMP signaling, the response to insulin, apoptosis protection, diacylglycerol<br>
signaling, and control of protein translation (Peterson et al, Curr. Biol. 1999, 9, R521). This<br>
sub-family includes PKA, PKB (c-Akt), PKC, PRK1, 2, p7056k; and PDK.<br>
[0045] AKT (also known as PKB or Rac-PK beta), a serine/threonine protein kinase, has<br>
been shown to be overexpressed in several types of cancer and is a mediator of normal cell<br>
functions [(Khwaja, A., Nature 1999, 401, 33-34); (Yuan, Z.Q., et al., Oncogene 2000, 19,<br>
2324-2330); (Namikawa, K„ et al., J Neurosci. 2000, 20, 2875-2886,)]. AKT comprises an N-<br>
terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a kinase domain and a C-terminal "tail" region.<br>
Three isoforms of human AKT kinase (AKT-1, -2 and -3) have been reported so far [(Cheng,<br><br>
J.Q., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1992, 89, 9267-9271); (Brodbeck, D. et al., J. Biol. Chem.<br>
1999, 274, 9133-9136)]. The PH domain binds 3-phosphoinositides, which are synthesized by<br>
phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PDK) upon stimulation by growth factors such as platelet<br>
derived growth factor (PDGF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-<br>
1) [(Kulik et at., Mol. Cell. Biol, 1997,17, 1595-1606,); (Hemmings, B.A., Science, 1997, 275,<br>
628-630)]. Lipid binding to the PH domain promotes translocation of AKT to the plasma<br>
membrane and facilitates phosphorylation by another PH-domain-containing protein kinases,<br>
PDK1 at Thr308, Thr309, and Thr305 for the AKT isoforms 1, 2 and 3, respectively. A second,<br>
as of yet unknown, kinase is required for the phosphorylation of Scr473, Ser474 or Ser472 in the<br>
C-terminal tails of AKT-1, -2 and -3 respectively, in order to yield a fully activated AKT<br>
enzyme.<br>
[0046] Once localized to the membrane, AKT mediates several functions within the cell<br>
including the metabolic effects of insulin (Calera, M.R. et al, J. Biol Chem. 1998, 273, 7201-<br>
7204) induction of differentiation and/or proliferation, protein synthesis and stress responses<br>
(Alessi, D.R. et al, Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998, 8, 55-62,).<br>
[0047] Manifestations of altered AKT regulation appear in both injury and disease, the most<br>
important role being in cancer. The first account of AKT was in association with human ovarian<br>
carcinomas where expression of AKT was found to be amplified in 15% of cases (Cheng, J.Q. et<br>
al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.S.A. 1992, 89, 9267-9271). It has also been found to be<br>
overexpressed in 12% of pancreatic cancers (Cheng, J. Q. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.<br>
1996. 93, 3636-3641). It was demonstrated that AKT-2 was over-expressed in 12% of ovarian<br>
carcinomas and that amplification of AKT was especially frequent in 50% of undifferentiated<br>
tumours, suggesting that AKT may also be associated with tumour aggressiveness (Bellacosa, et<br>
al.. Int. J. Cancer 1995, 64,280-285).<br>
[0048] PKA (also known as cAMP-dependent protein kinase) has been shown to regulate<br>
many vital functions including energy metabolism, gene transcription, proliferation,<br>
differentiation, reproductive function, secretion, neuronal activity, memory, contractility and<br>
motility (Beebe, S J., Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994, 5, 285-294). PKA is a tetramcric holocnzyme,<br>
which contains two catalytic subunits bound to a homo-dimeric regulatory subunit (which acts to<br>
inhibit the catalytic sub-units). On binding of cAMP (enzyme activation), the catalytic subunits<br>
dissociate from the regulatory subunits to yield the active serine/threonine kinase (McKnight,<br><br>
G.S. et al. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1988, 44, pp. 307). Three isoforms of the catalytic subunit<br>
(C-α, C-β and C-γ) have been reported to date (Beebe, S.J. el al, J. Biol. Chem. 1992, 267,<br>
25505-25512) with the C-α subunit being the most extensively studied, primarily because of its<br>
elevated expression in primary and metastatic melanomas (Becker, D. et al, Oncogene 1990, 5,<br>
1133). To date, strategies to modulate the activity of the C-α subunit involve the use of<br>
antibodies, molecules that block PKA activity by targeting regulatory dimers and antisense<br>
oligonucleotides expression.<br>
[0049] The ribosomal protein kinases p7056k- and -2 are also members of the AGC sub-<br>
family of protein kinases and catalyze the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the<br>
ribosomal protein S6, which has been implicated in the translational up-regulation of mRNAs<br>
coding for the components of the protein synthetic apparatus. These mRNAs contain an<br>
oligopyrimidine tract at their 5' transcriptional start site, termed a 5TOP, which has been shown<br>
to be essential for their regulation at the translational level (Volarevic, S. et al., Prog. Nucleic<br>
Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001, 65, 101-186). p7056K dependent S6 phosphorylation is stimulated in<br>
response to a variety of hormones and growth factors primarily via the PI3K pathway (Coffer,<br>
P.J. et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun, 1994 198, 780-786), which may be under the<br>
regulation of mTOR, since rapamycin acts to inhibit p70S6K activity and blocks protein synthesis,<br>
specifically as a result of a down-regulation of translation of these mRNA's encoding ribosomal<br>
proteins (Kuo, C.J. et al.. Nature 1992, 358, 70-73).<br>
[0050] In vitro PDK1 catalyses the phosphorylation of Thr252 in the activation loop of the<br>
p70 catalytic domain, which is indispensable for p70 activity (Alcssi, D.R., Curr. Biol., 1998, 8,<br>
69-81). The use of rapamycin and gene deletion studies of dp70S6K from Drosophila and<br>
p70S6Kl from mouse have established the central role p70 plays in both cell growth and<br>
proliferation signaling.<br>
[0051] The 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) plays a key role in<br>
regulating the activity of a number of kinases belonging to the AGC subfamily of protein kinases<br>
(Alessi, D. et al., Biochem. Soc. Trans 2001, 29, 1). These include isoforms of protein kinase B<br>
(PKB, also known as AKT), p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) (Avruch, J. et al., Prog. Mol.<br>
Subcell. Biol. 2001,26, 115), and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (FrOdin, M. et al, EMBO J. 2000,19,<br>
2924-2934). PDK1 mediated signaling is activated in response to insulin and growth factors and<br>
as a consequence of attachment of the cell to the extracellular matrix (integrin signaling). Once<br><br>
activated these enzymes mediate many diverse cellular events by phosphorylating key regulatory<br>
proteins that play important roles controlling processes such as cell survival, growth,<br>
proliferation and glucose regulation [(Lawlor, M.A. et al., J. Cell Sci. 2001, 114, 2903-2910),<br>
(Lawlor, M.A. et al., EMBO J. 2002, 21, 3728-3738)]. PDK1 is a 556 amino acid protein, with<br>
an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which<br>
activates its substrates by phosphorylating these kinases at their activation loop (Belham, C. et<br>
al., Curr. Biol. 1999, 9, R93-R96). Many human cancers including prostate and NSCL have<br>
elevated PDK1 signaling pathway function resulting from a number of distinct genetic events<br>
such as PTEN mutations or over-expression of certain key regulatory proteins [(Graff, J.R.,<br>
Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 2002, 6, 103-113), (Brognard, J., et al.. Cancer Res. 2001, 61, 3986-<br>
3997)]. Inhibition of PDK1 as a potential mechanism to treat cancer was demonstrated by<br>
transfection of a PTEN negative human cancer cell line (U87MG) with antisense<br>
oligonucleotides directed against PDK1. The resulting decrease in PDK1 protein levels led to a<br>
reduction in cellular proliferation and survival (Flynn, P., et al., Curr. Biol. 2000, 10, 1439-<br>
1442). Consequently the design of ATP binding site inhibitors of PDK1 offers, amongst other<br>
treatments, an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy.<br>
[0052] The diverse range of cancer cell genotypes has been attributed to the manifestation of<br>
the following six essential alterations in cell physiology: self-sufficiency in growth signaling,<br>
evasion of apoptosis, insensitivity to growth-inhibitory signaling, limitless replicative potential,<br>
sustained angiogenesis, and tissue invasion leading to metastasis (Hanahan, D. et al., Cell 2000,<br>
100, 57-70). PDK1 is a critical mediator of the PDK. signalling pathway, which regulates a<br>
multitude of cellular function including growth, proliferation and survival. Consequently,<br>
inhibition of this pathway could affect four or more of the six defining requirements for cancer<br>
progression. As such it is anticipated that a PDK1 inhibitor will have an effect on the growth of<br>
a very wide range of human cancers.<br>
[0053] Specifically, increased levels of PDK pathway activity has been directly associated<br>
with the development of a number of human cancers, progression to an aggressive refractory<br>
state (acquired resistance to chemotherapies) and poor prognosis. This increased activity has<br>
been attributed to a series of key events including decreased activity of negative pathway<br>
regulators such as the phosphatase PTEN, activating mutations of positive pathway regulators<br>
such as Ras, and overexpression of components of the pathway itself such as PKB, examples<br><br>
include: brain (gliomas), breast, colon, head and neck, kidney, lung, liver, melanoma, ovarian,<br>
pancreatic, prostate, sarcoma, thyroid [(Teng, D.H. et al, Cancer Res., 1997 57, 5221-5225),<br>
(Brognard, J. et al.. Cancer Res., 2001, 61. 3986-3997), (Cheng, J.Q. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. 1996, 93, 3636-3641), (Int. J. Cancer 1995, 64, 280), (Graff, J.R., Expert Opuu Ther.<br>
Targets 2002,6, 103-113), (Am. J. Pathol. 2001,159, 431)].<br>
[0054] Additionally, decreased pathway function through gene knockout, gene knockdown,<br>
dominant negative studies, and small molecule inhibitors of the pathway have been demonstrated<br>
to reverse many of the cancer phenotypes in vitro (some studies have also demonstrated a similar<br>
effect in vivo) such as block proliferation, reduce viability and sensitize cancer cells to known<br>
chemotherapies in a series of cell lines, representing the following cancers: pancreatic [(Cheng,<br>
J.Q. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. 19%, 93, 3636-3641), (Neoplasia 2001, 3, 278)], lung<br>
[(Brognard, J. et al.. Cancer Res. 2001, 61, 3986-3997), (Neoplasia 2001, 3, 278)], ovarian<br>
[(Hayakawa, J. et al., Cancer Res. 2000, 60, 5988-5994A (Neoplasia 2001, 3, 278)], breast (Mol.<br>
Cancer Ther. 2002, /, 707), colon [(Neoplasia 2001, 3, 278), (Arico, S. et al., J. Biol. Chem.<br>

kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK, p7056k-1 and -2, and PKB), CDK, GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYK<br>
activation, particularly given the inadequate treatments currently available for the majority of<br>
these disorders.<br>

fully saturated or have one or more units of unsaturation and has two points of attachment to the<br>
rest of the molecule.<br><br>
(0080] As detailed above, in some embodiments, two independent occurrences of R° (or R+,<br>
R, R' or any other variable similarly defined herein), are taken together with the atom(s) to<br>
which they are bound to form an optionally substituted 3-12 membered saturated, partially<br>
unsaturated, or fully unsaturated monocyclic or bicyclic ring having 0-4 heteroatoms<br>
independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur.<br>
[0081] Exemplary rings that are formed when two independent occurrences of R° (or R+, R,<br>
R' or any other variable similarly defined herein), are taken together with the atom(s) to which<br>
each variable is bound include, but are not limited to the following: a) two independent<br>
occurrences of R° (or R+, R, R' or any other variable similarly defined herein) that are bound to<br>
the same atom and are taken together with that atom to form a ring, for example, N(R°)2. where<br>
both occurrences of R° are taken together with the nitrogen atom to form a piperidin-1-yl,<br>
piperazin-1-yl, or morpholin-4-yl group; and b) two independent occurrences of R° (or R+, R, R'<br>
or any other variable similarly defined herein) that are bound to different atoms and are taken<br>
together with both of those atoms to form a ring, for example where a phenyl group is substituted<br>
with two occurrences of these two occurrences of R° are taken together with<br>
the oxygen atoms to which they are bound to form a fused 6-membered oxygen containing ring:<br>
  It will be appreciated that a variety of other rings can be formed when two<br>
independent occurrences of R° (or R', R, R' or any other variable similarly defined herein) are<br>
taken together with the atom(s) to which each variable is bound and that the examples detailed<br>
above are not intended to be limiting.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include all isomeric (e.g.,<br>
enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational)) forms of the structure; for<br>
example, the R and S configurations for each asymmetric center, (Z) and (E) double bond<br>
isomers, and (Z) and (E) conformational isomers. Therefore, single stereochemical isomers as<br>
well as enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational) mixtures of the present<br>
compounds are within the scope of the invention. Unless otherwise stated, all tautomeric forms<br>
of the compounds of the invention are within the scope of the invention. Additionally, unless<br>
otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds that differ only<br><br>
in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the<br>
present structures except for the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium or tritium, or the<br>

including cardiomegaly, cystic fibrosis, viral disease, autoimmune diseases, atherosclerosis,<br>
restenosis, psoriasis, inflammation, hypertension, angina pectoris, cerebrovascular contraction,<br>
peripheral circulation disorder, premature birth, arteriosclerosis, vasospasm (cerebral vasospasm,<br>
coronary vasospasm), retinopathy, erectile dysfunction (ED), AIDS, osteoporosis, Crohn's<br>
Disease and colitis, neurite outgrowth, and Raynaud's Disease. In preferred embodiments, the<br>
disease, condition, or disorder is atherosclerosis, hypertension, erectile dysfunction (ED),<br>
reperfusion/ischemia (e.g., stroke), or vasospasm (cerebral vasospasm and coronary vasospasm).<br>
[00147] Accordingly, in another aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
compositions are provided, wherein these compositions comprise any of the compounds as<br>
described herein, and optionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or<br>
-143-<br><br>
vehicle. In certain embodiments, these compositions optionally further comprise one or more<br>
additional therapeutic agents.<br>
[00148] It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present invention can exist<br>
in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative<br>
thereof. According to the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative includes,<br>
but is not limited to, pharmaceuticaJly acceptable prodrugs, salts, esters, salts of such esters, or<br>
any other adduct or derivative which upon administration to a patient in need is capable of<br>
providing, directly or indirectly, a compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or<br>
residue thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts which are, within<br>
the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and<br>
lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are<br>
commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means<br>
any non-toxic salt or salt of an ester of a compound of this invention that, upon administration to<br>
a recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound of this invention or<br>
an inhibitorily active metabolite or residue thereof. As used herein, the term "inhibitorily active<br>
metabolite or residue thereof means that a metabolite or residue thereof is also an inhibitor of a<br>
FLT-3, FMS, c-KTT, PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-family of protein kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK,<br>
p70S6K-l and -2, and PKB), CDK, GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYK.<br>
[00149] Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S. M.<br>
Berge et ai, describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in /. Pharmaceutical Sciences,<br>
1977, 66, 1-19, incorporated herein by reference. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds of this invention include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and<br>
bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an<br>
amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid,<br>
oxalic acid, raaleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other<br>
methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include<br>
adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyratc,<br>
camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate,<br>
ethanesulfonatc, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate,<br><br><br>
heptanoate, hexanoatc, hydroiodidc, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate,<br>
Iauryl sulfate, malatc, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalcnesulfonate, nicotinate,<br>
nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate,<br>
picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearatc, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate,<br>
undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali<br>
metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium and N+(C1-4alkyl)4 salts. This invention also envisions<br>
the quatemization of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds disclosed herein.<br>
Water or oil-soluble or dispcrsablc products may be obtained by such quatemization.<br>
Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium,<br>
magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate,<br>
nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such<br>
as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, loweralkyl sulfonate and aryl<br>
sulfonate.<br>
[00150] As described above, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of the present<br>
invention additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle,<br>
which, as used herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle, dispersion<br>
or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents,<br>
preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form<br>
desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sixteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack<br>
Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980) discloses various carriers used in formulating<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof.<br>
Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the compounds of the<br>

[00151] Uses of Compounds and Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions<br>
[001S2] In yet another aspect, a method for the treatment or lessening the seventy of a<br>
proliferative disorder, a cardiac disorder, a neurodegenerative disorder, a psychotic disorder, an<br>
autoimmune disorder, a condition associated with organ transplant, an inflammatory disorder, an<br>
immunologically mediated disorder, a viral disease, or a bone disorder is provided comprising<br>
administering an effective amount of a compound, or a pharmaceuucally acceptable composition<br>
comprising a compound to a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments of the present<br>
invention an "effective amount" of the compound or pharrnaceutically acceptable composition is<br>
that amount effective for treating or lessening the severity of a proliferative disorder, a cardiac<br>
disorder, a neurodegenerative disorder, a psychotic disorder, an autoimmune disorder, a<br>
condition associated with organ transplant, an inflammatory disorder, an immunologically<br>
mediated disorder, a viral disease, or a bone disorder. The compounds and compositions,<br>
according to the method of the present invention, may be administered using any amount and any<br>
route of administration effective for treating or lessening the seventy of a proliferative disorder,<br>
a cardiac disorder, a neurodegenerative disorder, an autoimmune disorder, a condition associated<br>
with organ transplant, an inflammatory disorder, an immunologically mediated disorder, a viral<br>
disease, or a bone disorder. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject,<br>
depending on the species, age. and general condition of the subject, the seventy of the infection,<br><br><br>
the particular agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The compounds of the invention arc<br>
preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.<br>
The expression "dosage unit form" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of agent<br>
appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage<br>
of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending<br>
physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any<br>
particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being<br>
treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the<br>
specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient;<br>
the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific<br>
compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental<br>
with the specific compound employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts. The term<br>
"patient", as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human.<br>
[00153] The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be administered<br>
to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracistemally, intravaginally,<br>
intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal<br>
spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated In certain<br>
embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally at<br>
dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about 1 mg/kg to<br>
about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired<br>
therapeutic effect.<br>
[00154] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and<br>
elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents<br>
commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and<br>
emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl<br>
alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in<br>
particular, cottonseed, groundnut, com, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol,<br>
tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting<br>
agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br><br><br>
[00159] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders,<br>
and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate<br>
and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic<br>
acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymcthylcellulose, alginates, gelatin,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating<br>
agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain<br>
silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, 0 absorption<br>
accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example,<br>
cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i)<br>
lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearatc, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form<br>
may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
[00160] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-<br>
filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular<br>
weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules,<br>
pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other<br>
coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain<br>
opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only,<br>
or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.<br>
Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled<br>
gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight<br>
polethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[00161] The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more<br>
excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and<br>
granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling<br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid<br>
dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as<br>
sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice,<br>
additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids<br><br><br>
[00155] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous<br>
suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting<br>
agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable<br>
solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for<br>
example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may<br>
be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In<br>
addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For<br>
this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In<br>
addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
[00156] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a<br>
bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid<br>
compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable<br>
medium prior to use.<br>
[00157] In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is often<br>
desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.<br>
This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material<br>
with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of<br>
dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively,<br>
delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving<br>
or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming<br>
microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-<br>
polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular<br>
polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other<br>
biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable<br>
formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that<br>
are compatible with body tissues.<br>
[00158] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which<br>
can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating<br>
excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are<br>
solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or<br>
vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br><br>
such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and<br>
pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain<br>
opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only,<br>
or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.<br>
Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.<br>
[00162] Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this<br>
invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants<br>
or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic<br>
formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this<br>
invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches,<br>
which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body.<br>
Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper<br>
medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the<br>
skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing<br>
the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
[00163] As described generally above, the compounds of the invention are useful as inhibitors<br>
of protein kinases. In one embodiment, the compounds and compositions of the invention are<br>
inhibitors of one or more of FLT-3, FMS, c-KIT, PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-family of protein<br>
kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK, p70S6k-l and -2, and PKB), CDK, GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYK,<br>
and thus, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the compounds and compositions<br>
are particularly useful for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder<br>
where activation of one or more of FLT-3, FMS, c-KIT, PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-family of<br>
protein kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK, p70S6K-l and -2, and PKB), CDK, GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or<br>
SYK is implicated in the disease, condition, or disorder. When activation of FLT-3, FMS, c-<br>
KIT, PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-family of protein kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK, p70S6k-1 and -2, and<br>
PKB), CDK, GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYK is implicated in a particular disease, condition, or<br>
disorder, the disease, condition, or disorder may also be referred to as "FLT-3, FMS, c-KIT,<br>
PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-family of protein kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK, p70S6k and -2, and PKB),<br>
CDK, GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYK -mediated disease" or disease symptom. Accordingly, in<br>
another aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating or lessening the severity of a<br><br><br>
disease, condition, or disorder where activation or one or more of FLT-3, FMS, c-KIT, PDGFR,<br>
JAK, AGC sub-family of protein kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK, p70S6K-l and -2, and PKB), CDK,<br>
GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYK is implicated in the disease state.<br>
[00164] The activity of a compound utilized in this invention as an inhibitor of FLT-3, FMS,<br>
c-KIT, PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-family of protein kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK, p70S6K-l and -2, and<br>
PKB), CDK, GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYK, may be assayed in vitro, in vivo or in a cell line.<br>
In vitro assays include assays that determine inhibition of either the phosphorylation activity or<br>
ATPase activity of activated FLT-3, FMS, c-KIT, PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-family of protein<br>
kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK, p70S6k and -2, and PKB), CDK, GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYK.<br>
Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the inhibitor to bind to FLT-3, FMS, c-KIT,<br>
PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-family of protein kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK, p70S6K-l and -2, and PKB),<br>
CDK, GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYK. Inhibitor binding may be measured by radiolabclling the<br>
inhibitor prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/ FLT-3, FMS, c-KIT, PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-<br>
family of protein kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK, p70S6K-l and -2, and PKB), CDK, GSK, SRC,<br>
ROCK, or SYK complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound. Alternatively,<br>
inhibitor binding may be determined by running a competition experiment where new inhibitors<br>
are incubated with FLT-3, FMS, c-KIT, PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-family of protein kinases (e.g.,<br>
PKA, PDK, p70S6K-l and -2, and PKB), CDK, GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYK bound to known<br>
radioligands.<br>
[00165] The term "measurably inhibit", as used herein means a measurable change in FLT-3,<br>
FMS, c-KJT, PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-family of protein kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK, p70S6K-l and<br>
-2, and PKB), CDK, GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYK activity between a sample comprising said<br>
composition and a FLT-3, FMS, c-KIT, PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-family of protein kinases (e.g.,<br>
PKA, PDK, p70S6K-1 and -2, and PKB), CDK, GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYK kinase and an<br>
equivalent sample comprising FLT-3, FMS, c-KIT, PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-family of protein<br>
kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK, p70S6K-l and -2, and PKB), CDK, GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYK<br>
kinase in the absence of said composition.<br>

[00191] The compounds of this invention or pharmaceutically acceptable compositions<br>
thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating implantable medical devices,<br>
such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Accordingly, the<br>
present invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for coating an implantable device<br>
comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes and<br>
subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. In still another<br>
aspect, the present invention includes an implantable device coated with a composition<br>
comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes and<br>
subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device.<br>
[00192] Vascular stents, for example, have been used to overcome restenosis (re-narrowing of<br>
the vessel wall after injury). However, patients using stents or other implantable devices risk<br>
clot formation or platelet activation. These unwanted effects may be prevented or mitigated by<br>
prc-coating the device with a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a kinase<br>
inhibitor. Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices are<br>
described in US Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coalings are typically<br>
biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane,<br>
polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and mixtures<br>
thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of fluorosiliconc,<br>
polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to impart controlled<br>
release characteristics in the composition.<br>
[00193] Another aspect of the invention relates to inhibiting FLT-3, FMS, c-KIT, PDGFR,<br>
JAK, AGC sub-family of protein kinases (e.g., PKA, PDK, p70S6k-1 and -2, and PKB), CDK,<br>
GSK, SRC, ROCK, and/or SYKactivity in a biological sample or a patient, which method<br><br>
comprises administering to the patient, or contacting said biological sample with a compound of<br>
formula I or a composition comprising said compound. The term "biological sample", as used<br>
herein, includes, without limitation, cell cultures or extracts thereof; biopsied material obtained<br>
from a mammal or extracts thereof; and blood, saliva, urine, feces, semen, tears, or other body<br>
fluids or extracts thereof.<br>

[00550] The compounds are assayed as inhibitors of full-length recombinant human Src<br>
kinase (from Upstate Biotechnology, cat. no. 14-117) expressed and purified from baculo viral<br>
cells. Src kinase activity is monitored by following the incorporation of 33P from ATP into the<br>
tyrosine of a random poly Glu-Tyr polymer substrate of composition, Glu:Tyr = 4:1 (Sigma, cat.<br>

to give a final DMSO concentration of 2.5%. The assay plate is incubated at 30°C for 10 min<br>
before initiating the reaction with 100 μM ATP. The absorbance change at 340 nm with time,<br>

[00559] In general, compounds of the invention, including compounds in Table 1, are<br>
effective for the inhibition of SYK.<br>
[00560] Example 7: Inhibition of FMS:<br>
[00561] Compounds were screened for their ability to inhibit FMS activity using a radiometric<br>
filter-binding assay. This assay monitors the 33P incorporation into a substrate poly(Glu, Tyr)<br><br>
4:1 (pE4Y). Reactions were carried out in a solution containing 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10<br>
mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% BSA and 2.5% DMSO. Final substrate<br>
concentrations in the assay were 90 μM ATP and 0.5mg/mL pE4Y (both from Sigma Chemicals,<br>
St Louis, MO). The final concentration of compounds is generally between 0.01 and 5μM.<br>
Typically, a 12-point titration was conducted by preparing serial dilutions from 10 mM DMSO<br>
stock of test compound. Reactions were carried out at room temperature.<br>
[00562] Two assay solutions were prepared. Solution 1 contains 100 mM HEPES (pH7.5),<br>
10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaCl, 1 mg/ml pE4Y and 180μM ATP(containing 0.3μCi of [Y-33P]ATP<br>
for each reaction). Solution 2 contains 100 mM HEPES (pH7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaCl,<br>
2 mM DTT, 0.02% BSA and 3 nM FMS. The assay was run on a 96 well plate by mixing 50μL<br>
each of Solution 1 and 2.5 mL of the test compounds. The reaction was initiated with Solution2.<br>
After incubation for 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction was stopped with 50/iL of<br>
20% TCA containing 0.4mM of ATP. All of the reaction volume was then transferred to a filter<br>
plate and washed with 5% TCA by a Harvester9600 from TOMTEC (Hamden, CT). The<br>
amount of 33P incorporation into pE4y was analyzed by a Packard TopCount Microplate<br>
Scintillation Counter (Meriden, CT). The data was fitted using Prism software to get an IC50 or<br>
Ki.<br>
[00563] In general, compounds of the invention, including compounds in Table 1, are<br>
effective for the inhibition of FMS.<br>
[00564] Example 8: Rock Inhibition Assay:<br>
[00565] Compounds were screened for their ability to inhibit ROCK I (AA 6-553) activity<br>
using a standard coupled enzyme system (Fox et al. (1998) Protein Sci. 7, 2249). Reactions were<br>
carried out in a solution containing 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaCl, 2<br>
mM DTT and 1.5% DMSO. Final substrate concentrations in the assay were 45 μM ATP<br>
(Sigma Chemicals, St Louis, MO) and 200 μM peptide (American Peptide, Sunnyvale, CA).<br>
Reactions were carried out at 30 °C and 45 nM ROCK I. Final concentrations of the components<br>
of the coupled enzyme system were 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 350 μM NADH, 30 μg/ml<br>
pyruvate kinase and 10 jig/ml lactate dehydrogenase.<br>
[00566] Certain compounds of the invention were found to inhibit ROCK.<br>
[00567] Example 9: JAK3 Inhibition Assay<br><br>
[00568] Compound inhibition of JAK was assayed by the method described by G. R. Brown,<br>
et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000, vol. 10, pp 575-579 in the following manner. Into<br>
Maxisorb plates, previously coated at 4°C with Poly (Glu, Ala, Tyr) 6:3:1 then washed with<br>
phosphate buffered saline 0.05% and Tween (PBST), was added 2 μM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and a<br>
solution of compound in DMSO. The reaction was started with JAK enzyme and the plates<br>
incubated for 60 minutes at 30°C. The plates were then washed with PBST, 100 μL HRP-<br>
Conjugated 4G10 antibody was added, and the plate incubated for 90 minutes at 30°C. The plate<br>
was again washed with PBST, 100μL TMB solution is added, and the plates were incubated for<br>
another 30 minutes at 30°C. Sulfuric acid (100 μL of 1M) was added to stop the reaction and the<br>
plate is read at 450 nm to obtain the optical densities for analysis to determine Ki values.<br>
[00569] Compounds were tested and found to inhibit JAK-3.<br>
[00570] PDK-1 Inhibition Assay<br>
[00571] Compounds were screened for their ability to inhibit PDK-1 using a radioactive-<br>
phosphate incorporation assay (Pitt and Lee, J. Biomol. Screen., (1996) 1, 47). Assays were<br>
carried out in a mixture of 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT.<br>
Final substrate concentrations in the assay were 40 μM ATP (Sigma Chemicals) and 65 μM<br>
peptide (PDKtide, Upstate, Lake Placid, NY). Assays were carried out at 30 °C and 25 nM<br>
PDK-1 in the presence of -27.5 nCi/μL of [v-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,<br>
Amersham, UK). An assay stock buffer solution was prepared containing all of the reagents<br>
listed above, with the exception of ATP, and the test compound of interest. 15 μl of the stock<br>
solution was placed in a 96 well plate followed by addition of 1 μl of 0.5 mM DMSO stock<br>
containing the test compound (final compound concentration 25 μM, final DMSO concentration<br>
5%). The plate was preincubated for about 10 minutes at 30°C and the reaction initiated by<br>
addition of 4 μl ATP (final concentration 40 μM).<br>
[00572] The reaction was stopped after 10 minutes by the addition of 100μL 100mM<br>
phosphoric acid, 0.01% Tween-20. A phosphocellulose 96 well plate (Millipore, Cat no.<br>
MAPHNOB50) was pretreated with 100μL 100mM phosphoric acid, 0.01% Tween-20 prior to<br>
the addition of the reaction mixture (100μL). The spots were left to soak for at least 5 minutes,<br>
prior to wash steps (4 x 200μL 100mM phosphoric acid, 0.01% Tween-20). After drying, 20μL<br>
Optiphase 'SuperMix' liquid scintillation cocktail (Perkin Elmer) was added to the well prior to<br>
scintillation counting (1450 Microbeta Liquid Scintillation Counter, Wallac).<br><br>
[00573] Compounds showing greater than 50% inhibition versus standard wells containing the<br>
assay mixture and DMSO without test compound were titrated to determine IC50 values.<br>
[00574] Compounds of the invention were tested and were found to inhibit PDK-1.<br><br>
