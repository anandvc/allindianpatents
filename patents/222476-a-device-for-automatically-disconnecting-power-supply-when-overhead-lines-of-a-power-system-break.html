The present invention relates bo a device for automatically cutting off electric power suooly when a live overhead wire breaks or falis onto the ground.<br>
Electric  power from the generating station is suppi led  to  the consumers through uninsulated overhead conductors - A large number of  people die every year by   unintentionally coming into  contact with a live wire which has fallen onto the ground.<br>
The main object of this invention is to prevent unintentionally coming into contact with a broken live wire, which has falien onto the ground.<br>
This can be achieved bv automatically cutting off the electric power supply as soon as the live wire breaks and falls onto the ground.<br>
When a phase wire breaks, it hangs downward, causing the device fi xed onto the line along i bs iength also to hang downward - This causes a metal ball to roll down a cylinder short circuiting the phase line with the neutral line and blowing a fuse provided in the circuit. The electric power supply through the phase line is thus stopped automatically with the breaking of the wire.<br><br>
The invention will now be described in detail with the help of the accompanying drawing where Figure 1 shows the device in a schematic form.<br>
The device comprises a hoi low cylinder 5 made of non-conductive material, one end of which is closed. A metal 1ic bail 2 wi th a diameter slightly less than the diameter of the hollow cylinder 5, is placed inside the cylinder 5- A triangular shaped frame 3 carrying the hoi low cylinder 5 along one of its sides is fitted on to the phase line with the help of two clips 4- The frame 3 is also made of non-conductive material.<br>
The triangle is preferably a right angled triangie with the hypoteneus carrying the hollow cylinder 3.<br>
When the electric line runs in a level plane one of the two adjacent sides of the right angled triangular frame 3 containing the right angle can be made with a length of about 30 cm and this side can be called the base line 6 of the frame 3- The other adjacent side with a length of about 10 cm represents the height 7 of the frame - The third side is the hypoteneus of the structure. The hollow cylinder 5 which is carried by the hypoteneus of the triangular frame 3 has a length equal to the length of the hypoteneus.<br><br>
A metallic ball 2 is placed inside the hollow cylinder 5- Two bracket shaped metallic strips 1 are fixed separately inside the cylinder near to the open end in such a way that their convex sides face each other without touching. The ball can roll freely inside the cylinder. The two bracket shaped strips 1 are connected separately to two high gauge insulated electric wires and these two wires are passed over the cylinder up to the closed end and they are fixed firmly there.<br>
The cylinder   5 is fixed along the hypoteneus of	tne  triangular<br>
structure 3 in such a way that the closed end of	the cylinder  is<br>
away from the base line 6. Two clios 4 are fixed	to the two ends<br>
of the base line 6.<br>
A small hole is provided at the closed end of the cylinder 5. A small hole is also provided on the triangular frame near to the closed end of the cylinder.<br>
The device of the present invention is fitted onto the phase line in between two electric posts and at the same time close to that post  which come first in the direction of the flow  of  electric<br><br>
current. The device is fixed onto the phase line along its length using tne clips 4 provided with the base line 6 of the tn angular frame 3 in such a way that the closed end of the hallow cylinder 5 faces against the direction of the flow of electric current.<br>
The device thus hangs verticaliy downwrds from the phase line and the metallic ball 2 in the cylinder 5 rests at the closed end as the closed end is at a lower level compared with the open end.The two strips 1 provided on the cyi inder 5 are connected by two wires provided with the device, one each to the phase wire and fca the neutral wire.<br>
A string passing through the hole provided on the frame near to the closed and of the cylinder can be tied bo he post so that swinging of the device can be prevented during any movement of the electric line. This can be avoided if the neutral line is below the phase line as the connectinq wire between the apparatus and the neutral line itself serves the above mentioned purpose.<br>
Electric supply lines are provided withfuses not shown, at different places. In the event of breaking of the phase line, to<br><br>
which this device is fixed, the wire falls and hangs downwards from the electric post causing the device also to hang  downwards with the closed end up and the open &amp;nd   (now covered with a  cap) down. Th is causes the metallic ball 2 to rol1 downwards from the closed end to the open end (now covered with a cap) making   the metal   ball to rest in between the two bracket  shaped  metal 1IC strips 1, filling the gap between them.<br>
As one of these two strips is connected to the phase line and the other to the neutral line, the electric ci rcuit is short circuited. This causes the melting and breaking of the fuse wire provided in the circuit. When the fuse wire oreaks, the electric supply to the broken 1ine is stopped «<br>
The same thing as described above will also happen in the event of the phase line coming down dangerously low-When this device is connected to an electric line running steeply downwards, a right angled triangular frame wnich has more height must be used so that the metal 1ic bai1 remains always at the closed end of the cylinder.<br><br><br>
