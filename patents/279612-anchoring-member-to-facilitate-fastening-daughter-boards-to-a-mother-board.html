				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of printed circuit boards ("PCB"). More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to devices and methods for fastening daughter<br>
boards in parallel relation to mother boards a predetermined distance apart.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the past, there have been many different types of PCBs. Furthermore, the PCBs<br>
can be arranged and connected together in arrangements, sometimes referred to as mother<br>
board and daughter board arrangements. Typically, a mother board is a main PCB and a<br>
daughter board is a peripheral or secondary PCB, usually smaller in size than the mother<br>
board and physically and electrically connected thereto.<br>
Typically, a daughter board is arranged in a perpendicular fashion to the mother<br>
board. However, a daughter board can also be arranged in a parallel fashion to a mother<br>
board. In general, a structural device is used to facilitate fastening of the daughter board to<br>
the mother board. The daughter board may be electrically connected to the mother board<br>
in any known manner.<br>
Typically, daughter boards are oriented on one side of the mother board, whether<br>
the daughter boards are arranged in parallel, or, perpendicular to the mother board.<br>
Because of this, many devices used to facilitate fastening of the daughter board to the<br>
mother board have a single active side which can be coupled to the daughter board.<br>
However, in some cases, it is necessary to have daughter boards present on both sides of a<br>
mother board.<br>
The prior art has suffered from several disadvantages. In particular, prior art<br>
devices have generally been one sided, meaning that each structural device can only secure<br>
a daughter board to one side of a mother board. This means that if daughter boards are to<br>
be arranged on both sides of a mother board, several individual structural devices must be<br>
used, each facing in different directions. Clearly, this can increase the cost because of the<br>
number of structural elements required to secure the daughter boards to the mother boards.<br>
 <br>
Furthermore, this can greatly increase the amount of area, also referred to as "real estate",<br>
used on the mother board because, whether or not a structural element is used to secure a<br>
mother board to one side or the other side of the mother board, the area or real estate on<br>
the mother board used by the structural element is gone and cannot be used for other<br>
elements or purposes. Furthermore, the additional elements present on a mother board<br>
increase the complexity of the wiring circuit printed on the mother board thereby<br>
increasing the overall cost to design and build a mother board.<br>
In addition, in some cases, daughter boards are designed to have holes which mate<br>
with the structural element. In such cases, where the daughter boards are to be designed<br>
for more than one use, or more than one orientation, several holes must be present on the<br>
daughter board in order to accommodate the different possible locations and orientations<br>
of the structural elements on the mother board. This also decreases the available area or<br>
real estate available for use on the daughter board. This also increases the complexity of<br>
the wiring circuit printed on the daughter board.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to at least partially overcome some of -<br>
the disadvantages of the prior art. Also, it is an object of this invention to provide an<br>
improved type of structural element for securing daughter boards on both sides of a mother<br>
board and in parallel thereto.<br>
Accordingly, in one of its aspects, this invention resides in an anchoring member<br>
for facilitating fastening a first daughter board, said first daughter board having at least one<br>
circuit element thereon, to a first side of a mother board, said mother board having at least<br>
one circuit element thereon, and for facilitating fastening of a second daughter board, said<br>
second daughter board having at least one circuit thereon, to a second side of the mother<br>
board, said second side of the mother board being opposed from said first side of the<br>
mother board, said anchor member comprising: an elongated body extending in a<br>
longitudinal direction; a first coupling member for coupling the first daughter board to the<br>
elongated body substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction; a second<br>
 <br>
coupling member for coupling the second daughter board to the elongated body<br>
substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction; a friction fit surface for securing<br>
the elongated body to the mother board; a positioning flange for positioning the elongated<br>
body in an inserted position in the mother board; wherein the elongated body can be<br>
inserted into an aperture of the mother board in the longitudinal direction to the inserted<br>
position where the positioning flange abuts the first side of the mother board and the<br>
friction fit surface interacts with the aperture to secure the elongated body in the inserted<br>
position; wherein, when the elongated body is in the inserted position, the first coupling<br>
member can couple the first daughter board to the elongated body on the first side of the<br>
mother board, and the second coupling member can couple the second daughter board to<br>
the elongated body on the second side of the mother board, with the first daughter board,<br>
mother board and second daughter board being arranged in substantially parallel<br>
arrangement.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention resides in a method of fastening a first<br>
daughter board having at least one circuit element thereon to a first side of a mother board,<br>
said mother board having at least one circuit element thereon, and for fastening a second<br>
daughter board having at least one circuit thereon, to a second side of the mother board,<br>
said second side of the mother board being opposed from said first side of the mother<br>
board, said method comprising: inserting an elongated body into the aperture until a<br>
friction fit surface on the elongated body interacts with the aperture at an inserted position,<br>
said elongated body extending in a longitudinal direction; coupling the first daughter board<br>
to a first coupling member substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction at a<br>
first end of the elongated body; coupling the second daughter board to a second coupling<br>
member substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction at the second end of the<br>
elongated body, said first end being positionally opposed from said second end; wherein<br>
the elongated body is inserted into the aperture in the longitudinal direction with the<br>
second end first; wherein the first daughter board, mother board and second daughter<br>
board are arranged in substantially parallel arrangement.<br>
 <br>
In a still further aspect, the present invention resides in a printed circuit board<br>
assembly comprising: a mother board having a first side and second side and at least one<br>
aperture; an elongated body extending in a longitudinal direction and secured in said<br>
aperture, said elongated body having a first coupling member at a first end and a second<br>
coupling member at a second end, said second end positionally opposed from said first end<br>
in the longitudinal direction; a first daughter board having at least one electric circuit, said<br>
first daughter board coupled to the elongated body substantially perpendicularly to the<br>
longitudinal direction with the first coupling member; a second daughter board having at<br>
least one electric circuit thereon, said second daughter board coupled to the elongated body<br>
substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction with the second coupling<br>
member; wherein the first daughter board and second daughter board are fastened to the<br>
mother board in a substantially parallel arrangement with the first daughter board on the<br>
first side of the mother board and the second daughter board on the second side of the<br>
mother board.<br>
Accordingly, one advantage of at least one aspect of the present invention is that<br>
the a single anchoring member can be used to secure daughter boards to either side of a<br>
mother board and in parallel arrangement thereto. This can decrease the real estate used<br>
on the mother board because a single structural element can be used to secure two different<br>
daughter boards to the same mother board. This can also decrease the complexity of the<br>
overall circuit on the mother board by decreasing the number of apertures that must be<br>
incorporated into the mother board for securing the daughter boards thereto.<br>
A further advantage of at least one aspect of the present invention is that the cost of<br>
manufacture can be decreased in that a single structural element can be used to secure two<br>
daughter boards, thereby decreasing the assembly costs as well as the material costs.<br>
A further advantage of at least one aspect of the present invention is that the design<br>
of the daughter boards can be made more symmetrical, particularly where the daughter<br>
boards perform the same function. In this way, a single aperture, or other fastening device,<br>
can be used on a daughter board rather than having separate apertures or fastening devices<br>
 <br>
in different locations on the daughter board corresponding to the different possible<br>
locations a corresponding structural element on a mother board could fasten to a daughter<br>
board depending on the orientation of the daughter board. Similarly, if the same structural<br>
element is also to be used for a heat sink, such as an aluminium plate, a single offsetting<br>
hole or other fastening element can be used to fasten the heat sink to the structural element<br>
on the mother board regardless of the orientation of the aluminium board with respect to<br>
the mother board during manufacture.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention and its advantages can be understood by<br>
referring to the present drawings. In the present drawings, like numerals are used for like<br>
and corresponding parts of the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, one embodiment of the present invention relates to a<br>
structural element and, in particular, an anchoring member, shown generally by reference<br>
numeral 100, for facilitating fastening a first daughter board 1 and a second daughter board<br>
2 in parallel arrangement on either side of a mother board 3. The anchoring member 100<br>
comprises, in one preferred embodiment, an elongated body 102 extending in a<br>
longitudinal direction, indicated generally by the arrow identified with the symbol Ld.<br>
Preferably, the anchoring member 100 comprises a friction fit surface, as shown<br>
generally by reference numeral 103, for securing the elongated body 102 to the mother<br>
board 3. The friction fit surface 103 can be any type of surface which can secure the<br>
elongated body 102 to the mother board 3 and may include a screw bore arrangement, an<br>
adhesive surface, a chemical reaction, such as a thermosetting resin or epoxy, or heat<br>
shrinking. In a preferred embodiment, as illustrated in Figure 1, the friction fit surface 103<br>
comprises serrated edges 104.<br>
Preferably, the friction fit surface 103 extends along the longitudinal direction Ld<br>
of the elongated body 102 a distance comparable to the thickness t of the mother board 3.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the elongated body 102 is cylindrical in shape, as<br>
illustrated in Figure l,_but it is understood that the elongated body 102 may have any other<br>
elongated shape including oval, triangular, rectangular or square. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, where the elongated body 102 is cylindrical in shape, the serrated surface<br>
104 will extend along at least a portion, and preferably all, of the circumference C.<br>
 <br>
As also illustrated in Figure 1, the elongated body 102 preferably has a positioning<br>
flange 108. In a preferred embodiment, the positioning flange 108 is adjacent the friction<br>
fit surface 103 and abuts against the first side 31 of the mother board 3 when the elongated<br>
body 102 is in the inserted position. Preferably, the positioning flange 108 extends<br>
radially out for at least a portion of the circumference C, and more preferably all of the<br>
circumference C, of the elongated body 102. In this way, the positioning flange 108 can<br>
abut against the first surface 31 of the mother board 3 along a larger surface area to better<br>
ensure that the elongated body 102 has been inserted into the inserted position and to avoid<br>
potential damage to the mother board 3 during this insertion.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the elongated body 102 in the inserted position. As illustrated<br>
in Figure 2, the elongated body has been inserted into an aperture 33 in the mother board 3.<br>
This can be accomplished, for instance, by the elongated body 102 being inserted, such as<br>
by press fitting, in the longitudinal direction Ld into the aperture 33 of the mother board 3<br>
until the position flange 108 abuts the first surface 31 of the mother board 3. In this<br>
inserted position, the friction fit surface 103, in this case being the serrated edges 104,<br>
interact with the aperture 33 to secure the elongated body 102 in the inserted position.<br>
The anchoring member 100 also preferably comprises a first coupling member 111<br>
for coupling the first daughter board 1 to the elongated body 102 substantially<br>
perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction Ld. The anchoring member 100 also<br>
preferably comprises a second coupling member 112 for coupling the second daughter<br>
board 2 to the elongated body 102 substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal<br>
direction Ld. By substantially perpendicularly is meant substantially perpendicular or<br>
normal to a plane defined by the first daughter board 1 or second daughterboard 2, as the<br>
case may be. In a preferred embodiment, the first coupling member 111 is located at a first<br>
end 131 of the elongated body 102 and the second coupling member 112 is located at a<br>
second end 132 of the elongated body 102. The first end 131 is preferably positionally<br>
opposed in the longitudinal direction Ld from the second end 132.<br>
 <br>
As also illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, the first coupling member 111 and the<br>
second coupling member 112 may comprise a first fastening member 121 and a second<br>
fastening member 122, respectively. In one preferred embodiment, the first fastening<br>
member 121 and the second fastening member 122 can comprise a first threaded bore 123<br>
and a second threaded bore 124 illustrated in Figure 1. The first threaded bore 123 and the<br>
second threaded bore 124 may have a set depth, or, may be part of a threaded bore<br>
extending within the elongated body 102 in the longitudinal direction Ld. In either case,<br>
the first threaded bore 123 and the second threaded bore 124 may receive a first threaded<br>
screw 125 and a second threaded screw 126, respectively, as illustrated, for instance, in<br>
Figure 3. The first threaded screw 125 and the second threaded screw 126 may pass<br>
through a first coupling member 111 in the first daughter board 1 and a second coupling<br>
member 112 in the second daughter board 2, respectively.<br>
In this preferred embodiment, the fastening members 121, 122 will fasten the<br>
daughter boards 1, 2 as illustrated, for instance, in Figure 3. However, it is understood that<br>
any other type of coupling members 111, 112 could be used and the present invention is<br>
not restricted to fastening members 121,122 comprising threaded bores 123, 124 and<br>
corresponding threaded screws 125, 126. For example, the coupling members 111, 112<br>
could include serrated surfaces (not shown), a heat shrink arrangement, an adhesive, a<br>
chemical reaction including thermosetting resins such as epoxy, and any other type of<br>
device or means for coupling the daughter boards 1, 2 to the elongated body 102.<br>
As also illustrated in Figure 3, when the elongated body 102 has been inserted in<br>
the inserted position, the first coupling member 111 can couple the first daughter board 1<br>
to the elongated body 102 at a first distance Dl from the first surface 31 of the mother<br>
board 3. The second coupling member 112 can couple the second daughter board 2 to the<br>
elongated body 102 at the second distance D2 from the second side 32 of the mother board<br>
3. As also illustrated in Figure 3, the first daughter board 1, the mother board 3 and the<br>
second daughter board 2 will be arranged in substantially parallel arrangement. As also<br>
illustrated in Figure 3, the daughter boards 1, 2 may have at least one circuit element<br>
thereon, shown generally by reference numbers 12 and 22, respectively. The at least one<br>
 <br>
circuit elements 12, 22 in Figure 3 are shown to be RJ-45 connectors 250, but any type of<br>
circuit elements 12, 22 could be used. The mother board 3 may also comprise at least one<br>
circuit elements, shown generally by reference numeral 34 in Figure 2, but the mother<br>
board 3 need not necessarily have a circuit element 34 and could just act as a member to<br>
which the anchoring member 10 facilitates fastening by the daughter boards 1,2.<br>
It is understood that the first distance Dl and the second distance D2 may be<br>
substantially equal. Alternatively, the first distance Dl and the second distance D2 may be<br>
different. In either case, the length of the elongated body 102 in the longitudinal direction<br>
Ld can be adjusted to accommodate any distance Dl, D2, whether they are the same or<br>
different.<br>
As also illustrated in Figure 2, and discussed above, in a preferred embodiment, the<br>
positioning flange 108 is adjacent to the friction fit surface 103. In this way, assembly of<br>
the anchoring member 100 into the mother board 3 is facilitated by simply press fitting the<br>
elongated body 102 into the aperture 33 of the mother board 3 by pushing the elongated<br>
body 102 in the longitudinal direction Ld into the aperture 33 until the positioning flange<br>
108 abuts the first side 31 of the mother board 3. Preferably, the second end 132 is<br>
inserted into the aperture 33 first. Because the positioning flange 108 is preferably<br>
adjacent the friction fit surface 103, the friction fit surface 103 will interact with the edges<br>
of the aperture 33 in the mother board 3 to secure the elongated body in the inserted<br>
position when the positioning flange 108 abuts the first side 3 of the mother board 3.<br>
In this inserted position, the distance from the positioning flange 108 that is<br>
abutting the first side 33 of the mother board 3 to the first coupling member 111 will<br>
correspond to a first length LI which will be related to the first distance D1. Similarly,<br>
when in the inserted position, the distance from the positioning flange 108 to the second<br>
coupling member 112 in the longitudinal direction Ld will correspond to the second length<br>
L2 and be related to the second distance D2 plus the thickness t of the mother board 3.<br>
This is the case because the positioning flange 108 abuts the first side 31 of the mother<br>
 <br>
board 3 while the second daughter board 2 is to be placed a distance D2 from the second<br>
side 32 of the mother board 3.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a further preferred embodiment where heat sinks, shown<br>
generally by reference numeral 50, are attached to the coupling members 111, 112. This<br>
can be accomplished in a preferred embodiment as illustrated in cross-section in Figure 6<br>
by having a first standoff pin 127 and a second standoff pin 128 inserted into the first<br>
threaded bore 123 and the second threaded bore 124 instead of threaded screws 125,126.<br>
The standoff pins 127,128 in this embodiment comprise modified first and second<br>
fastening members 121, 122 in that they replace the threaded screws 125, 126 referred to<br>
above. Similarly, the standoff pins 127,128 may receive counter sink screws 57 to<br>
connect heat sinks 50 to the standoff pins 127,128 which, in turn, are connected to the<br>
anchoring member 100. This can be used, for example, to structurally secure a heat sink<br>
50 to the at least one circuit elements 12, 22 on the daughter boards 1, 2.<br>
Preferably, if the daughter boards 1,2 have at least one circuit element 12,22,<br>
which comprise fiber optic transceivers 40, then a heat sink 50 is preferred to assist in<br>
dissipating the heat generated by the fiber optic transceivers 40, and any other of the circuit<br>
elements 12,22 the daughter boards 1,2 may comprise. The heat sink 50 may simply be<br>
thermally conductive plates, such as aluminium, which conducts heat away from a heat<br>
source.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates daughter boards 1,2 assembled to a mother board 3 and<br>
inserted in an IED 200. For convenience, the front cover of the IED 200 has been removed<br>
from Figure 8. As illustrated in Figure 8, the heat sink 50 are preferably in thermal contact<br>
with the casing 202 of the IED 200 in order to facilitate dissipation of the heat generated.<br>
The heat sink 50 is also arranged in parallel arrangement to the mother board 3 as<br>
well as the daughter boards 1,2. This is understood because the heat sinks 50 can best<br>
operate to dissipate heat when they are in contact with a large surface area of the heat<br>
generating elements, in this embodiment the fiber optic transceivers 40. Furthermore, as<br>
 <br>
illustrated in Figure 8, in order to dissipate energy away from the heat generating<br>
components, the heat sinks 50 must also be in contact with the large surface area of the<br>
outer case 220 of the IED 200.<br>
Figure 8 also illustrates how an IED 200 can have a large port density per area,<br>
which means that there are a large number of ports 210, in a small area and all on one side<br>
of the IED 200 using the anchor member 100 according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The IED 200 can be designed to have a larger number of ports 210 per area<br>
because the anchor member 100 facilitates fastening the daughter boards 1, 2 in parallel<br>
arrangement on either side 31, 32 of the mother board 3 to increase the number of ports<br>
210 per area. Furthermore, as also illustrated in Figure 8, the heat sinks 50 can also be<br>
arranged in a more efficient arrangement. This can give the IED 200 a more sleek design<br>
and also a more efficient use of space. It is also understood that the daughter boards 1, 2<br>
could be separated from the first side 31 and the second side 32 of the mother board 3 by<br>
different distances Dl, D2 which could permit customization of the ports 210 in the IED<br>
200.<br>
It is also understood that in cases where the daughter boards 1, 2 have a circuit<br>
element 12, 22 that does not generate a great deal of heat, then a heat sink 50 may not be<br>
necessary. For instance, Figure 3 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention where<br>
RJ-45 connectors 250 are used. Typically, the RJ-45 connectors 250 do not generate a<br>
large amount of heat. If the assembly shown in Figure 3 is inserted in an IED 200, then<br>
heat sinks 50 would generally not be necessary. This would also decrease the area of the<br>
IED 200 and increase the port density per area because the thickness associated with the<br>
heat sinks 50 would be avoided.<br>
It is understood that while a preferred embodiment would relate to use of this<br>
invention to improve the orientation of daughter boards 1, 2 with respect to a mother board<br>
3 where the daughter boards 1, 2 comprise RJ-45 connectors 250 and/or fiber optic<br>
transceivers 40, the invention is not so limited. As illustrated in Figure 5, the daughter<br>
boards 1, 2 may have any type of circuit element 12, 22 associated therewith.<br>
 <br>
It is also understood that while the description above has been made with respect to<br>
an anchor member 100, it is understood that the daughter boards 1, 2 may be secured to the<br>
mother board 3 with more than one anchor member 100. In particular, Figure 7, which is a<br>
side view of the assembly shown in Figure 6, better illustrates that the daughter boards 1,2<br>
are, in fact, coupled to separate anchor devices, identified by reference numerals 100a,<br>
100b, for ease of reference. In this way, the daughter boards 1, 2 as well as the heat sinks<br>
50 can be more securely fastened to the mother board 3. In a futher preferred embodiment,<br>
the first side 31 of the mother board 3 faces upwards, against gravity, when the mother<br>
board 3 has been installed in an IED 250. In this way, the positioning flange 108 can<br>
provide additional support for the first and second daughter boards 1,2. This is also true<br>
when heat sinks 50 are also coupled to the elongated body 102.<br>
Accordingly the anchoring member 100 of the present invention facilitates<br>
fastening of a first daughter board 1, a mother board 3 and a second daughter board 2 in<br>
substantially parallel arrangement. The anchoring member 100 may also be used to<br>
facilitate fastening of the heat sinks 50, also in parallel arrangement with the mother board<br>
3 and daughter boards 1,2. Moreover, the present anchoring member 100 facilitates<br>
fastening of the heat sinks 50 on the outer surface of the daughter boards 1,2. In this way,<br>
the daughter boards 1,2 are sandwiched between the heat sinks 50. The mother board 3 is<br>
then sandwiched between the daughter boards 1, 2 as illustrated at least in Figures 6, 7 and<br>
8, to form a printed circuit board assembly, shown generally by reference numeral 190.<br>
