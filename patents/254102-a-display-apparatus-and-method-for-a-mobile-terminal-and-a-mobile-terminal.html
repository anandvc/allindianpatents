	Figure 5 shows an example of a bar-type mobile terminal employing the<br>
present invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the bar-type mobile terminal includes two display<br>
units 30 and 40, and also can be implemented to have only one display unit in<br>
appearance. Namely, a screen is divided into two (first and second display<br>
regions) or more regions, and each region can independently perform displaying.<br>
Providing only one display unit having a plurality of regions, instead of the<br>
two separate display units 30 and 40, to the mobile terminal can be applied to the<br>
above-mentioned folder type mobile terminal, the slide type mobile terminal and<br>
the flip type mobile terminal in the same manner.<br>
	Figures 6A to 6C show other examples of the folder type mobile terminal<br>
employing the present invention. Specifically, this folder type mobile terminal is<br>
constructed such that, with the mobile terminal closed, namely, when two bodies<br>
of the mobile terminal are overlapping, the second display unit 40 is exposed.<br>
As for the basic structure of the folder type mobile terminal as shown in<br>
Figures 6A to 6C, the mobile terminal includes a first body 200, a second body<br><br>
300, a first display unit 30, a second display unit 40, a hinge part 400 for allowing<br>
one body (e.g., a second body) of the mobile terminal to be rotated with respect to<br>
the other body (e.g., a first body), and a transparent protection window 60 for<br>
protecting the second display unit 40 from external impacts or scratches in a state<br>
that the first body 200 and the second body 300 overlap.<br>
As shown in Figure 6B, the second body 300 is constructed such that a<br>
space for receiving the second display unit 40 is formed corresponding to a shape<br>
of the second display unit 40 to expose the second display unit in a state that the<br>
mobile terminal 100 is closed.<br>
	Figure 6B is an exploded view of the mobile terminal in Figure 6A and<br>
Figure 6C is a front view with the mobile terminal in Figure 6A closed.<br>
The mobile terminals of Figures 2A to 2F can have a third display unit (not<br>
shown) outside the second body 300. In this respect, however, in terms of power<br>
consumption, it may not be desirable that the mobile terminals have the external<br>
display unit.<br>
The mobile terminal in accordance with the present invention can<br>
simultaneously execute a plurality of tasks through the first and second display<br>
units 30 and 40, and in this case, while the user processes a task in one display<br>
unit, the other display unit is maintained (remains) in a non-active state. Namely,<br>
while the user processes a task in the first display unit 30, the controller 20 of the<br>
mobile terminal can activate the first display unit 30 and can deactivate the<br>
second display unit 40. Conversely, when the user processes a task in the second<br>
display unit 40, the controller can deactivate the first display unit 30 and can<br>
activate the second display unit 40.<br>
	In order for the user to select the display units 30 and 40, a display unit<br><br>
selecting means can be provided, and as the display unit selecting means, a<br>
button of a keypad can be used or a select button (soft key) can be additionally<br>
provided in the mobile terminal.<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Figure 6B, an up select button 117a and<br>
5a down select button 117b as the display unit selecting means (or an activation<br>
switching unit) can be additionally provided in the mobile terminal.<br>
When the user presses the up select button 117a, the first display unit 30<br>
can be activated and a signal inputted through the input unit 10 is inputted for an<br>
operation executed on the first display unit 30.<br>
	When the user presses the down select button 117b, the second display<br>
unit 40 can be activated, and a signal inputted through the input unit 10 is inputted<br>
for an operation executed on the second display unit 40.<br>
When the user depresses the up select button 117a or the down select<br>
button 117b for a prolonged period of time (e.g., 3 seconds or longer), the mobile<br>
terminal 100 may perform display switching (refer to the second embodiment of<br>
the present invention).<br>
If the first and second display units 30 and 40 are implemented as a<br>
inputtable display unit (e.g., a touch screen), the user can perform the above-<br>
described operations by simply touching the screen without using the display unit<br>
selecting means 117a and 117b.<br>
The display unit selecting means can be operated in the same manner<br>
when one display unit having the plurality of regions is provided.<br>
The 'plurality of simultaneously executed tasks' have the same but<br>
independent relationships with each other, and the 'tasks' refer to typically<br>
provided functions with the following types:<br><br>
(1)	Online services (e.g., online games, wireless Internet services, VOD<br>
(Video On Demand) services, file downloading, or the like)<br>
(2)	message services (e.g., chatting, instant messenger functions, short<br>
message services, multimedia messages, e-mail, or the like)<br>
	(3) call services (e.g., voice communications, video communications, or<br>
the like)<br>
(4)	functions of taking images (e.g., video (moving picture), still image,<br>
etc)<br>
(5)	various supplementary functions (e.g., scheduler, phone book<br>
searching, calculator, writing a memo, recording communication contents<br>
(recording sounds and images), setting a terminal state, searching calendar<br>
dates, displaying world time functions, setting alarms (or morning call features),<br>
reproducing videos or music files, or the like).<br>
The mobile terminals in accordance with the present invention can<br>
operate as follows.<br>
Figure 7 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary the processes of a display<br>
method for the mobile terminal in accordance with the present invention, and<br>
Figures 8A to 11 show exemplary first and second display units of the mobile<br>
terminal in accordance with the present invention.<br>
	As shown in Figure 7, the mobile terminal receives user instructions<br>
through the input unit 10 and executes one or more tasks in turn according to the<br>
inputted instructions. And, the controller 20 displays the executed tasks on the<br>
first and second display units 30 and 40 (steps S10 and S20).<br>
Thereafter, when a new instruction from the user is inputted through the<br>
input unit 10, the controller determines the appropriate display unit for performing<br><br>
the instruction. If the inputted instruction is to be displayed on a currently<br>
deactivated display unit, the controller 20 activates the currently deactivated<br>
display unit and processes the corresponding operation (step S30).<br>
Figures 8A to 8C show exemplary display units of the mobile terminal in<br>
accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, Figure 8A shows a case where the mobile terminal 100 executes<br>
only one operation. As shown in Figure 8A, the first display unit 30 displays<br>
buddies registered in an instant messenger function, showing the person with<br>
whom the user is talking, indicating who is in an online state and who is in an<br>
offline state, while the second display unit 40 displays a standby screen.<br>
As shown in Figure 8A, when the mobile terminal 100 executes one task<br>
through one screen, the controller 20 can maintain the other screen in a standby<br>
state. Namely, when the first display unit 40 displays an executed task (e.g.,<br>
instant messenger), the controller 20 maintains the second display unit 30 in the<br>
standby state, and if the second display unit 40 displays an executed task (e.g.,<br>
instant messenger), the controller maintains the first display unit 30 in the standby<br>
state.<br>
Table 1 shows the features related to the embodiment of Figure 8A.<br><br><br><br>
Figure 8B shows a case where the mobile terminal 100 simultaneously<br>
executes two tasks (e.g., instant messenger and phone book searching). As<br>
shown in Figure 8B, the first display unit 30 displays an instant messenger window<br>
like the case shown in Figure 8A, and the second display unit 40 displays a phone<br>
book search window.<br>
The embodiment of Figure 8B shows a case where the user searches a<br>
phone number of a person while executing the instant messenger function.<br>
Namely, in the present invention, the mobile terminal 100 can display one specific<br>
task (e.g., the instant messenger) through the first display unit 30 and<br>
simultaneously can display another task (e.g., phone book searching) through the<br><br>
second display unit 40. That is, the mobile terminal 100 allows the user to process<br>
two or more independent tasks simultaneously.<br><br>
	Figure 8C shows a case where three tasks (e.g., instant messenger,<br>
phone book searching, and schedule management) are executed simultaneously.<br>
As shown in Figure 8C, the first display unit 30 displays an instant messenger<br>
window like the case as shown in Figure 8A, and the second display unit 40<br><br>
displays icons (or other graphics) 61-63 of the tasks being currently executed<br>
(instant messenger, phone book searching, and schedule management).<br>
When a specific button (or key) is pressed (or activated) to make the<br>
icons 61-63 of the tasks being executed appear on the display unit 30 or 40, the<br>
controller 20 detects this through the input unit 10 and displays the icons 61-63 of<br>
the instant messenger function, phone book searching and schedule<br>
management either on the first display unit 30 or on the second display unit 40.<br>
Thereafter, when the user selects a specific icon by operating direction keys (
T , -», I), the controller displays a corresponding task window on the second<br>
display unit 40. Though Figure 8C shows the task windows displayed on the<br>
second display unit 40, the user can display them on the first display unit 30.<br><br><br><br>
Figures 9 and 10 show the state of exemplary display units (before and<br>
15after display switching) of a mobile terminal in accordance with a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the second embodiment of the present invention, the mobile terminal<br>
100 exchanges the displaying of a task (e.g., short message input) of the first<br>
display unit 30 and a task (e.g., schedule management) of the second display unit<br>
2040, when the user presses a certain button or activates such function in another<br>
manner.<br>
As shown in Figure 9, the mobile terminal 100 displays a short message<br>
input window on the first display unit 30 and schedule management on the second<br><br>
display unit 40. When the user instructs to the switching of displaying the tasks,<br>
the controller 20 displays mutually exchanged tasks of the first and second<br>
displays 30 and 40.<br>
The display switching can be performed when the user presses the up<br>
select button 117a or the down select button 117b for a certain time (e.g., 3<br>
seconds) or longer or when the user simultaneously presses the up select button<br>
117a and the down select button 117b for a certain time (e.g., 3 seconds) or<br>
longer.<br>
In Figure 9, icons 61, 63 and 65 shown at an upper portion of the second<br>
display unit 40 indicate the tasks being currently executed by the mobile terminal<br>
100. Through the icons 61, 63 and 64, the user can recognize the tasks being<br>
currently executed in the mobile terminal 100.<br>
Table 4 shows the features related to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br><br><br><br>
Figure 11 shows exemplary display units of a mobile terminal in<br>
accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
When the user activates the first display unit 30 by pressing a certain<br>
20button (or other activation means) and presses a specific key (e.g., menu key (or<br>
other activation means) for additionally executing a new task, as shown in Figure<br>
11, the controller 20 displays menu items on the first display unit 30.<br>
Thereafter, when the user selects one of icons of menu items, the<br>
controller 20 executes a task corresponding to the selected icon and newly adds<br>
the selected icon to a list of tasks being currently executed of the second display<br>
unit 40.<br><br>
The list of tasks being currently executed is displayed as an icon type (or<br>
other graphics) at an upper portion of the second display unit, and the user can<br>
recognize through the icons that the instant messenger 61, the schedule<br>
management 63 and the short message input 64 are being currently executed.<br>
	Table 5 shows the features related to the third embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br><br><br>
As so far described, the display apparatus and method for a mobile<br>
terminal in accordance with the present invention has the following advantages.<br>
That is, the mobile terminal can simultaneously process a plurality of<br>
tasks through a plurality of display units to allow the user to substantially perform<br>
multitasking.<br>
Because the mobile terminal has a plurality of display units which can<br>
independently perform displaying, the user can simultaneously process tasks<br>
such as instant messenger function and video reproducing by using the display<br>
units.<br>
The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and<br>
are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching<br>
can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses. The description of the<br>
present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the<br>
claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover<br>
the structure described herein as performing the recited function and not only<br>
structural equivalents but also equivalent structures.<br><br>
