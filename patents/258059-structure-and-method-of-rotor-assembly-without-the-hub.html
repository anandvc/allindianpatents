STRUCTURE AND METHOD OF ROTOR ASSEMBLY WITHOUT THE HUB<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to a structure and method of assembling a rotor<br>
assembly, without the use of a rotor steel hub.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Conventional electric motors generally comprise of a cylindrical stator and<br>
a rotor assembly located within the stator. Typically, the rotor assembly is constructed<br>
with the aid of a heavy steel hub. The hub is used to ensure that the rotor laminations are<br>
connected to external structures and support the structure of the rotor assembly. The use<br>
of a hub requires special machining for locking rotor components or tabs to the hub. In<br>
the use of a hub to assemble the rotor assembly, the rotor components or tabs must be<br>
perfectly aligned to complete the assembly process.<br>
[0003]	In order for the hub to slide over the rotor lamination stack, a gap must be<br>
created. The hub is ordinarily contracted with the use of liquid nitrogen at -300째 F while<br>
the rotor laminations are expanded with the use of an oven at 400째 F. As the temperatures<br>
normalize, the gap dissipates and a "shrink-fit" between the hub and rotor laminations<br>
results.<br>
[0004]	Other typical rotor assemblies include a supporting rotor shaft extending<br>
through a central hole in the stack of rotor laminations. The rotor shaft may also be<br>
welded onto either end of the stack of rotor laminations.<br>
 2<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	The present invention eliminates the use of a hub in assembling the rotor<br>
assembly. There is no supporting rotor shaft extending through the center of the stack of<br>
rotor laminations or attached at the ends of the stack of rotor laminations.<br>
[0006]	A structure and method of assembling a rotor assembly is provided. The<br>
first step comprises forming a first lamination stack by stacking individual first rotor<br>
laminations. The first lamination stack has a first end and a second end. The second step<br>
comprises stacking individual second rotor laminations onto the second end of the first<br>
lamination stack, thereby creating a second lamination stack. The second lamination<br>
stack has a first end and a second end. The third step comprises stacking a set of third<br>
rotor laminations onto the second end of the second lamination stack thereby creating a<br>
third lamination stack. The third lamination stack has a first end and a second end.<br>
[0007]	In another aspect of the invention, the first, second and third lamination<br>
stacks are cast to lock the first, second and third rotor laminations together. The first, second and third rotor laminations have a generally ring-like shape with a variable inner diameter and a substantially common outer diameter. The first, second and third rotor laminations have substantially the same outer diameter, whereas the second rotor laminations have a substantially larger inner diameter than the first and third rotor laminations.<br>
[0008]	The elimination of the hub results in the elimination of the use of liquid<br>
nitrogen at -300째 F and oven at 400째 F in the "shrink-fit" process described above. Fewer parts are needed with the method of this invention than are typically required, resulting in less inventory problems. The cost of assembling the rotor is reduced as is the time required to manufacture and assemble the rotor.<br>
[0009]	The above method also leads to improved rotor heat transfer for improved<br>
rotor oil cooling. As a result of the elimination of the rotor hub, the oil contained within the rotor has better contact with the rotor laminations, leading to better heat transfer. A cooler motor draws less electric current to operate, thereby reducing electric power consumption,The improved method also leads to better concentricity between the outer<br>
 3<br>
and inner diameters of the rotor. The gap between the outer diameter of the rotor and<br>
stator inner diameter will be more uniform and consistent since the flange bearing<br>
journals on both ends are more concentric.<br>
[0010]	The above features and other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes<br>
for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0011]	FIGURE 1 is a fragmentary schematic perspective view of the rotor<br>
assembly;<br>
[0012]	FIGURE 2 is a fragmentary schematic cross sectional view of the rotor<br>
assembly; and<br>
[0013]	FIGURE 3 is a schematic perspective view of the bolt used in the present<br>
invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0014]	In the embodiment described below, the rotor assembly is used in an<br>
electric motor in a hybrid transmission for a vehicle. However the method and structure<br>
described below is suitable for use with rotors for induction machines, permanent magnet<br>
and switch reluctance machines as well as other suitable machines.<br>
[0015]	Referring to Figure 1, a perspective view of part of a rotor assembly 10 is<br>
illustrated. Figure 2 is a schematic cross sectional view of part of the rotor assembly 10. The rotor assembly comprises a first lamination stack 20, second lamination stack 30 and a third lamination stack 40. The first lamination stack 20 is made up of individual first rotor laminations 22. The first lamination stack 20 has a first end 24 and a second end 26. The rotor assembly 10 also comprises a second lamination stack 30, attached to the second end 26 of the first lamination stack 20. The second lamination stack 30 is made up of individual second rotor laminations 32. The second lamination stack 30 has a first end<br>
 4<br>
34 and a second end 36. The rotor assembly 10 also comprises a third lamination stack<br>
40, attached to the second end 36 of the second lamination stack 30. The third lamination<br>
stack 40 is made up of individual third rotor laminations 42. The third lamination stack<br>
40 has a first end 44 and a second end 46. The first lamination stack 20 and the third<br>
lamination stack 40 are substantially identical in size, see discussion below.<br>
[0016]	The first, second and third rotor laminations 22, 32 and 42 respectively are<br>
generally circular disks which are made of flat sheets of silicone steel. The sheets, which may be made of other suitable materials, are fitted into a punching die (not shown) which punches holes into the sheet resulting in a generally ring-like shape. Other non-circular shapes that are suitable for use in various electric machine rotor assemblies may also be employed.<br>
[0017] As shown in Figure 1, the first, second and third rotor laminations 22, 32 and 42 have an opening with center 50, an inner circumference 52 and an outer circumference 54. The distance between two points on the outer circumference 54, going through the center 50 of the opening represents the outer diameter OD of each rotor lamination, as shown in Figure 1. The distance between two points on the inner circumference 52, going through the center 50 of the opening represents the inner diameter ID of each rotor lamination, as shown in Figure 1. Each of the first, second and third rotor laminations 22, 32, 42 have annulus regions A1, A2 and A3, respectively, between their respective inner and outer circumferences 52 and 54.<br>
[0018]	In the embodiment shown, the first, second and third rotor laminations 22,<br>
32 and 42 are stacked in an axial direction. The first lamination stack 20 has an axial length L1. The second lamination stack 30 has an axial length L2. The third lamination stack 40 has an axial length L3. There are approximately 25 first rotor laminations 22 in the first lamination stack 20. There are approximately 220 second rotor laminations 32 in the second lamination stack 30. There are approximately 25 third rotor laminations 42 in the third lamination stack 40. Thus, in the preferred embodiment, the second lamination stack 30 has an axial length L2 greater than either of the first and third lamination stacks 20 and 40, i.e. the second lamination stack 30 contains a greater number of individual<br>
 5<br>
rotor laminations than either of the first and third lamination stacks 20 and 40 or the laminations of the combined laminations of the first and third lamination stacks 20 and 40. Existing automated lamination feeding and stacking machines can be utilized for this assembly process.<br>
[0019]	In terms of the sizes of the individual rotor laminations, the first, second<br>
and third rotor laminations 22, 32 and 42 have substantially the same outer diameter OD. However the first and third rotor laminations 20 and 40 have substantially smaller inner diameters ID than the second rotor laminations 30, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, to allow for the placement of bolt holes 60. Thus the annulus region A1 and A3 is larger for the first and third rotor laminations 20 and 40 than the annulus region A2 of the second rotor lamination 30.<br>
[0020]	As shown in Figure 1, slots 62 extend along the periphery of the outer<br>
circumference 54 of the first, second and third rotor laminations 22, 32 and 42. The first, second and third lamination stacks 20, 30 and 40 are cast together by first being placed in a die cast mold fixture (not shown). The first, second and third lamination stacks 20, 30 and 40 are molded by applying pressure to lock the first, second and third lamination stacks 20, 30 and 40 together.<br>
[0021]	Molten aluminum or other suitable material is injected into the slots 62.<br>
The molten aluminum flows through the slots 62 from the first end 24 of the first lamination stack 20 to the second end 46 of the third lamination stack 40. A means of pressure such as hydraulic back pressure is applied against the molten metal forcing the molten metal into the slots 62 to lock the first, second and third rotor laminations 22, 32 and 42 together in a unitary configuration, thereby avoiding air gaps, porosity and bubbles. For example, the first, second and third lamination stacks 20, 30 and 40 may be compressed together in a die-casting machine so as to lock the first, second and third rotor laminations 22, 32 and 42 together. The molten aluminum solidifies to create a first end ring 64 at the first end 24 of the first lamination stack 20 and a second end ring 66 at the second end 46 of the third lamination stack 40, see Figure 2. The aluminum or other<br>
 6<br>
suitable material first and second end rings 64 and 66 serve to enhance the conductivity of the rotor assembly 10.<br>
[0022]	As shown in Figures 1 and 2, bolt holes 60 extend along the periphery of<br>
the inner circumference 52 of the first and third rotor laminations 22 and 42. The bolt holes 60 are configured to receive a corresponding bolt 68.<br>
[0023]	Figure 3 is a schematic perspective view of a bolt 68. The head of each<br>
bolt 68 has a flat side 67 that may be used to wedge and lock the bolt 68 in the first and third lamination stacks 20 and 40. Each bolt 68 has serrations 69 that prevent the bolt 68 from rotating and interact with complementary slots on the inside of each bolt hole 60. The flat side 67 of the head of the bolt 68 and the serrations 69 provide anti-rotation when the first and second flange 74 and 76 (see discussion below) is assembled and the nut 78 is tightened. There are twelve bolt holes 60 in the preferred embodiment, however any number of bolt holes may be used. A representative first bolt 70 and representative second bolt 72 is shown in Figure 2, attached onto the first lamination stack 20 and the third lamination stack 40, respectively.<br>
[0024]	A first flange 74 is attached onto the first end 24 of the first lamination<br>
stack 20, using the first bolt 70 for orientation. The first bolt 70 goes through a hole in the first flange 74. A second flange 76 is attached onto the second end 46 of the third lamination stack 40, using the second bolt 72 for orientation. The second bolt 72 goes through a hole in the second flange 76. As stated above, the preferred embodiment describes a rotor assembly 10 used in an electric motor (not shown) in a hybrid transmission. The first and second flanges 74 and 76 are mechanical devices that provide a means of attachment for the first, second and third lamination stacks 20, 30 and 40 to the gears and/or other parts of the electric motor in the transmission. The first and second flanges 74 and 76 help transmit power to the mechanical components of the electric motor. A set of nuts 78 are placed over the edges of the first and second bolts 70 and 72 for secure attachment of flange to rotor assembly.<br>
 7<br>
[0025]	Alternatively, a single flange with multiple holes to mate with respective<br>
first and second bolts 70 or 72 may be used. Any number of multiple flanges may also be used. The flange may be constructed of steel or other suitable materials. The physical structure or configuration of the flange may be varied depending on the layout and design of the components to be attached to the rotor laminations 22, 32 and 42 through the flange. Method<br>
[0026]	A method for assembling the rotor assembly 10 described above is<br>
provided. The first step comprises forming a first lamination stack 20 by stacking<br>
individual first rotor laminations 22. The first lamination stack 20 has a first end 24 and a<br>
second end 26. The second step comprises stacking individual second rotor laminations<br>
32 onto the second end 26 of the first lamination stack 20 thereby creating a second<br>
lamination stack 30. The second lamination stack 30 has a first end 34 and a second end<br>
36. The third step comprises stacking a set of third rotor laminations 42 onto the second<br>
end 36 of the second lamination stack 30 thereby creating a third lamination stack 40.<br>
The third lamination stack 40 has a first end 44 and a second end 46.<br>
[0027]	The first, second and third lamination stacks 20, 30 and 40 may be cast<br>
together in a die cast mold fixture and molded to lock the first, second and third rotor laminations 22, 32 and 42 together. A dowel pin or a guide bar (not shown) may be used to ensure the proper alignment of the first, second and third lamination stacks 20, 30 and 40. The guide bar may be used to align the stacking of the first, second and third lamination stacks in the die cast mold fixture prior to molding. The dowel pin or guide bar may be inserted into a respective one or more slots 62 of the rotor lamination 42 and extend axially through the slot to the first end 24 of the first lamination stack 20 or from the first end 24 to the second end 46.<br>
 8<br>
[0028]	A first bolt 70 may be attached onto the first lamination stack 20 as well as<br>
a second bolt 72 onto the third lamination stack 40. A first flange 74 may be attached<br>
onto the first end 24 of the first lamination stack 20, using the first bolt 70 for orientation;<br>
and a second flange 76 may be attached onto the second end 46 of the third lamination<br>
stack 40, using the second bolt 72 for orientation.<br>
Other Steps<br>
[0029]	A further step may comprise machining the outer circumference 54 of the<br>
first second and third rotor laminations 22, 32 and 42. Machining involves grinding the<br>
outer circumference 54 for smoothness and precision of dimensions. This process may<br>
be done at the final rotor assembly, which involves assembling both flanges.<br>
[0030]	A further step may involve fine-tuning a speed sensor wheel 80. Certain<br>
rotor assemblies may contain a speed sensor wheel 80, as shown in Figure 2. The speed<br>
sensor wheel 80 may be an integral part of the flange structure or it may be mounted<br>
separately by welding, using bolts or other means. If mounted on the structure, the speed<br>
sensor wheel 80 must be attached securely so it does not vibrate.<br>
[0031]	Finally, a next step may be final balancing of the rotor assembly 10, which<br>
involves removing and adding extremely small amounts of weight at either end of the<br>
rotor assembly 10. This serves to balance the weight of the rotor assembly 10 from one<br>
end to the other, leading to reduced vibration and noise.<br>
[0032]	The thickness of the hub used typically in constructing a rotor restricts the<br>
width A2 of rotor laminations to what can be fitted within the hub. Eliminating the hub<br>
allows for the cross-sectional area of the rotor laminations to be increased. This allows<br>
for a greater electromagnetic flux path and increased efficiency of the motor.<br>
Furthermore, the electric motor performance and efficiency is improved as a result of the<br>
elimination of the contact pressure applied by the hub on the rotor laminations.<br>
[0033]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br>

The rotor laminations in the first, second and third lamination stacks have substantially the same outer diameter, whereas the rotor laminations in the second lamination stack have a substantially larger inner diameter than the first and third rotor laminations. The elimination of the hub results in reducing total cost and manufacturing cycle time, and in improved features, performance and efficiency of the rotor assembly.</td>
