		This invention relates to a filter for a vehicular wastewater treatment system<br>
	and, more specifically, to a filter made from a synthetic material that isstructured to<br>
	filter particles and support a biological agent, as well as the use thereof.<br>
10 	Background Information<br>
		Vehicular wastewater treatment systems, such as systems used on trains,<br>
 	utilize a biological agent to breakdown solid waste. The biological agent istypically<br>
	 a coliform bacteria, an aerobic bacteria. The wastewater treatment system includes a<br>
 	toilet that is coupled to, and in fluid communication with, a treatment tank. The<br>
15 	treatnaeut tank is further coupled to, and fluid communication with a chlorinator<br>
 	assembly. Generally, wastewater, including solid particles, is flushed from the toilet<br>
 	into the treatment tank. in the tank, the wastewater passes through a filter that is<br>
 	disposed above the water level of the rank. The liquid portion of the wastewater<br>
	 paasses through the filter into the lower portion of the tank- the majority of the solid<br>
20 	waste particles, which are too large to pass through the filter, are trapped above the<br>
	 filter. The biological agent feeds on the solid waste, breaking the solid waste into<br>
	 liquids and gases. The gas is vented from the system and the liquid flows to the lower<br>
	 portion of the tank. Wastewater, and any liquid created by the biological agent, flow<br>
	 into the chlorinator for further treatment<br>
25 		The current filter used in the treatment tank employs natural redwood bark as<br>
	 both a filter media and as a substrate upon which, the biological agents grow. The<br>
	 bark is disposed in, and provide passage through, a membrane adjacent to, but spaced<br>
	 from, the bottom of the tank. However, the availability of bark is being reduced due<br>
	 to depletion and harvesting moratoriums, Additionally, the bark filters are not<br>
30 	compatible with anti-bacterial cleaning agents. That is, a cleaning agent used in the<br>
	 toilet passed through the filter after the toilet was flushed. The bark filter absorbed<br><br>
WO 2004/037382								PCT/US2003/000870<br>
2-<br>
	 the cleaning agent and retarded the growth of the biological agent. Absorption of a<br>
 	strong cleaning agent ruined the filter and the filter would have to be replaced.<br>
 		There is, therefore, a need fora filter structured to replace the bark filter that<br>
	 traps solid particle in wastewater and supports the growth of biological agents.<br>
5 		There is a further need far a filter that will not absorb a cleaning agent.<br>
	 There 	is a further need for a filter that is compatible with the structure of<br>
	 existing treatment tanks of vehicular wastewater treatment systems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
10 		The disclosed "invention provides a synthetic filter for use in a vehicular waste<br>
	 treatment system. The synthetic filter is a replacement for the redwood bark filter.<br>
 	The synthetic filter is a generally solid cylindrical elongated body having a plurality<br>
 	of longitudinal comb-like slots and vanes to allow for liquid passage. There are<br>
 	preferably, two sets of longitudinal comb-like slots and vanes extending towards<br>
15 	opposite sides of the cylinder. The filter may also include two longitudinal channels.<br>
 	The channels are disposed on opposite sides of the filter from each other and about 90<br>
 	degrees from the comb-like slots/vanes. The filter is structured to fit strugly in holes<br>
 	in the membrane between an upper chamber and a lower chamber in the treetment<br>
	tank used in the present filter system. The filter is made from a flexible material and,<br>
20 	as such, the comb-like slots/varues may deform slightly as the filter is installed in the<br>
 	dam holes, When installed, the filter will allow a maximum particle size of about<br>
 	0.04 inch to pass therethrough. the filter is made from a synthetic material. The<br>
 	synthetic, material may be a thermoplastic rubber, such as Santoprene®, Grade 64A<br>
 	manufactured by Advanced Elastomer Syslems, 388 S. Main St., Akron Ohio, 44311,<br>
25 	or a thermoplastic elastomer, such as Evoprene®, Grade G963, manufectured by<br>
 	Alpha Gary, Albis North America, P.O. Box 711, Rosenberg, TX 77471-0711. Such<br>
 	a synthetic material will not absorb a cleaning agent and, as such, accidental use of an<br>
 	antibacterial clearing agent in the toilet will not ruin the filter.<br>
 		It is an object of this invention to provide a filter structured to replace the bark<br>
30 	filter that traps solid particle in wastewater and supports the growth of biological<br>
 	agents<br><br>
WO 2004/037382								PCT/US2003/000870<br>
3<br>
		It is a further object of this invention to provide a filter that will not absorb a<br>
	cleaning agent<br>
		It is a further object of this invention to provide a filter that is compatible with<br>
	the structure of existing treatment tanks of vehicular wastewater treatment systems.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
		 As used herein, "wastewater" shall include both liquid waste and solid Waste,<br>
	 and any combination thereof.<br>
20 		As used herein, "support for a biological agent" shall mean physical support,<br>
	 such as a structure, and/or a surface that encourages the growth of biological<br>
	 organisms.<br>
		 As shown in Figure 1, a vehicular waste treatment system 10 includes one or<br>
	 more toilet assemblies 20, a treatment tank assembly 30, and a chlorinator system 60.<br>
25 	The toilet assemblies 20 are coupled to, and in fluid communication with, the<br>
	 treatment tank assembly 30 by conduits 22. The toilet assemblies 20 operate in a<br>
	 manner known in the art and collect wastewater which typically includes liquid waste<br>
	 such as water and urine as well as solid waste, such as feces and paper. When the<br>
	 toilet assemblies 20 are flushed, the wastewater is passed to the treatment tank<br>
30 	assembly 30 via conduirs 22.<br>
		 As shown in Figures 2 and 3. the treatment tank assembly 30 includes a tank<br>
	 assembly 32, a plurality of upper filter assemblies 34, a membrane 36, and a plurality<br><br>
WO 2004/037382								PCT/US2003/000870<br>
4<br>
	of lower filters 38. The lank assembly 32 includes a top 40, a sidewall 42, and a<br>
	 bottom 44. An inlet port 45 through the top 40 or, as shown, through the sidewall 42<br>
	 adjacent to the top 40- The inlet port 45 is coupled to, and in fluid communication<br>
	 with, the conduits 22, The membrane 36 is disposed adjacent to, but spaced from, the<br>
5	 tank assembly bottom 44. The membrane 36 extends across the entire interior of the<br>
	 tank, assembly 32 and, except for the filter openings 37, described below, is<br>
	 watertight. The membrane 36 includes a plurality of filtter openings 37. The filter<br>
	 openings 37 pfeferably have a diameter of about 1.5 inches. The membrane 36<br>
	 divides the task assembly 32 into an upper chamber 46 and a lower chamber 48. The<br>
10	 lower filters 38, detailed herein after, extend through the filter openings 37. Thus, for<br>
	 wastewater to pass from the upper chamber 46 to the lower chamber 48, the<br>
	 wastewater must pass through a lower filter 38. The lower chamber 48 includes an<br>
	 exit port 50 which extends through the sidewall 42. An egress conduit 52 is coupled<br>
	 to, and in fluid communication with, the exit port 50.<br>
15		 The egress conduit 52 is further coupled to, and in fluid communication with,<br>
	 the chlorinator system 60, The chlorinator system 60 includes a tablet chamber 62<br>
	 and a serpentine conduit 64. The tablet chamber 62 includes a tablet opening 66<br>
	 where a user may insert chlorine tablets. The egress conduit 52 is, more specifically,<br>
	 coupled to, and in fluid communication with, the tablet chamber 62. The tablet<br>
20	 chamber 62 is further coupled to, and in fluid communication with, the serpentine<br>
	 conduit 64. The serpentine conduit 64 preferably extends in a zigzag pattern, below<br>
	 the treatment tank assembly 30 and includes a plurality of baffles (not shown) or other<br>
	 means for slowing the flow of wastewater.<br>
		 As shown in Figure 4, each lower filter 38 is made from a synthetic material,<br>
25	 preferably Santoprene, Each lower filter 38 includes an elongated body 70 which is,<br>
	 preferably, a generally solid cylinder. The elowgated body 70 preferably has a<br>
	 maximum diameter between about 1.4 and 1.8 inches, and more preferably aboul 1.6<br>
	 inches. The elongated body 70 has a plurality of longitudinal comb-like slots 72 and<br>
	 vanes 74 to allow for liquid passage. There are, preferably a first set 76 and a second<br>
30 	set 78 of longitudinal comb-like slots 72 and vanes 74, The first and second set of<br>
	 longitudinal combs/vanes 76, 78 extend towards opposite sidas of the filter body 70.<br>
	 The lower filter 38 nay also include two longitudinal channels 80. The channels 80<br><br>
WO 2004/037382								PCT/US2003/000870<br>
5<br>
	are disposed on opposite sides of the filter body 70 from each other and about 90<br>
	degrees from the first and second set of longitudinal combs/vanes 76, 78, Each filter<br>
	body 70 is structured to fit strugly in the filter openings 37. Each filter body 70 is<br>
	made from a flexible, material and, as such, the first and second set of longitudinal<br>
5	 combs/vanes 76, 78 may deform slightly as the filter body 70 is installed in the filter<br>
	openings 37. The vanes 74 are spaced about 0.09 inch apart, that is, the slots 72 have<br>
	a width of about 0.09 inch. The interior end 82 of the slots 72, that is the end nearest<br>
	a centerline extending between the first and second set of longitudinal combs/vanes<br>
	76, 73, is pointed. This shape allows the first and second, set of longitudinal<br>
10	 combs/vanes 76, 78 to be collapsed more easily as the filter body 70 is inserted into<br>
	the filter opening 37. Because the elongated filter body 70 has a diameter that is larger<br>
	than the filter openings 37. when the filter body 70 is installed in the membrane<br>
	openings 37 the first and second set of longitudinal tombs/vanes 76. 78 are<br>
	compressed so that the slots 72 have a width of about 0.04 inch. Thus, solid particles<br>
15	 having a diameter greater than about 0.04 inch cannot pass through the lower filters<br>
	38. The portion of the filter body 7.0 that, extends into the upper chamber 46<br>
	preferably extends at least about 2.5 inches above the membrane 36.<br>
		The upper filter assemblies 34 are mounted in the upper chamber 46 and<br>
	attached to the interior of the rank sidewall 42. The upper filter assemblies 34 include<br>
20	 a mounting bracket 90, a housing 92, and a plurality of upper filters 94. The upper<br>
	filters 94 may have the same cross-sectional shape as the lower filters 38. The<br>
	mounting bracket 90 couples the housing 92 to the tank side wall 42. The upper filters<br>
	94 are disposed in the housing 92. The housing 92 is water permeable. The upper<br>
	filters 94 provide a substrate for the aerobic biological agent when the wastewater<br>
25	 level in the treatment task assembly 30 is above the top of the lower filters 38. The<br>
	upper filters 94 may be disposed either horizontally or vertically within the upper<br>
	filter assembly housing 92.<br>
		In operation, wastewater is flushed from the toilet assemblies 20, via the<br>
	conduits 22, into the treatment tank assembly 30. The wastewater moves to the<br>
30	 bottom of the upper chamber 46 and is disposed on top of rhe membrane 36- The<br>
	liquid portion of the wastewater passes through the slots in the lower filters 38 into<br>
	the lower chamber 48. Solid waste particles in the wastewater having a diameter of<br><br>
WO 2004/037382								 PCT/US2003/000870<br>
6<br>
	greater than about 0.04 inch will be blocked by the lower filters 38 and held in the<br>
	upper chamber 46. An aerobic biological agent, such as a coliform bacteria, is present<br>
	in the treatment rank assembly 30, or is introduced along with the wastewater. The<br>
	biological agent breaks the solid waste partitles down into various liquids and gases,<br>
5	 The gases are vented from the treatment tank assembly 30 and the liquids pass<br>
	through the lower filters 38 into the lower chamber 48. Wastewater and other liquids<br>
	in the lower chamber 48 are passed on to the chlorinator system 60. The chlorinator<br>
	system 60 allows the user to add chlorine tablets which will kill all biological agents<br>
	as the wastewater passes through the serpentine conduit 64. After the wastewater<br>
10	 passes through the chlorinator system 60, the wastewater may be dumped or further<br>
	treated if required,<br>
		Typically, the liquid level in the upper chamber 46 will not rise above the top<br>
	of the lower filters 38, As such, the aerobic biological agent on the lower filter 38<br>
	will usually be exposed to air. However, during times of high use, the treatment tank<br>
15	 assembly 30 may Fill so quickly that the liquid level in the upper chamber 46 rises<br>
	above the top of the lower Filters 38. When this happens, the surface of the liquid in<br>
	the upper chamber will be in contact with the upper filter assemblies 34. The aerobic<br>
	biological agent is also disposed on the substrate of the upper filters 94 and will begin<br>
	10 process the solid waste particles floating at the top of the wastewater.<br>
20		 It will be appreciated that the present invention provides a filter structured to<br>
	replace the bark filter that traps solid particle in wastewater. This filter is made from<br>
	a material thai supports the growth of biological agents capable of consuming solid<br>
	waste particles. The filter also will not absorb a cleaning agent and, as sucH, may be<br>
	used for an expended period of time unlike the prior bark filters which could be<br>
25	 ruined if exposed to a cleaning agent While the filter is preferably used in a<br>
	vehicular wastewater treatment tank, the filter May be used with stationary treatment<br>
	tanks or other types of treatment tanks.<br>
		While specific embodiments of the invention have been described in detail, it<br>
	will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
30	 alternatives to those details could be developed in light of the overall teachings of the<br>
	disclosure. Accordingly, the particular arrangements disclosed are meant to be<br><br>

	tank;<br>
		d)	 utilizing said toilet assembly and flushing wastewater into said<br>
	treatment tank;<br>
		e)	 filtering, said wastewater through said filters so that solid waste<br>
	particles remain in said upper chamber while liquid waste moves into said lower<br>
	chamber; and<br>
		f)	 allowing a biological agent to process said solid waste particles into<br>
	gases and liquids.<br>
		22.	 The method of Claim 21 wherein said step of providing a filter<br>
	includes the step of providing a filter made from a material selected from the group<br>
	consisting of: thermoplastic rubber or thermoplastic elastomers.<br>

		25.	 The method of Claim 23 wherein:<br>
		said step of providing a treatment tank assembly with a membrane having<br>
	filter openings indudes providing fitter openings that are about 1.5 inches in diameter<br>
or less;<br>
		said step of pioviding a filter includes the step of providing a filter having a<br>
	diameter that is larger than said filter openings; and<br>
		said step of installing a said filter in each said filter opening further includes<br>
	the step of compressing said filter into said filter opening so that the width of said<br>
	slots is reduced.<br><br><br><br>
A filter for a vehicular Scwage<br>
sysitem that includes an elongated body (70)<br>
having a plurality of longtiudinal vares (74) and<br>
slots (72). The body is made from material<br>
able to support the growth of biological agents.<br>
The slots (72) sized to resist the passage of<br>
particles larger than about 0.04 inches. The<br>
filter are struetured for use with a vehicular<br>
sewage system having a treatment tank divided<br>
into an upper chamber and a lower Chamber by<br>
a membrane. The membrane has a plurality of<br>
filter openings in which the filters are disposed.<br>
The filters allow fluid waste and solid particles<br>
smaller than about 0.04 inch flow into the lower<br>
chamber Larger particles of solid waste are<br>
exposed to air in the upper chamber thereby<br>
allowing aerobic biological agents to process<br>
the solid waste. In use, the filter allows the<br>
liquid portion of wastewater to pass from an<br>
upper chamber of the treatment tank into a lower<br>
chamber.The solid waste particles are then consumed by an aerobic bacteria in the upper chamber.<br></td>
