Interference pigments on the basis of silicon oxides<br>
The present invention relate: to (interference) pigments having a core of SiOy with 0.70 
plastics, cosmetics, giazes fo" ceramics and glass.<br>
Interference pigments having a core of Si02 are known (Gerhard Pfaff and Peter Reynders, Chem. Rev. 99 (1999) 1963-1981):<br>
The Si02 flakes are produced, for example, by a process described in WO93/08237, wherein a sodium water glass solution is applied as a thin film on an endless band, solidified and dried. WO93/08237 also describes the coating of the Si02 flakes with a metal oxide having a high index of refraction or a tnin semi-transparent metal layer.<br>
W098/53011 discloses multi-coated interference pigments consisting of a transparent carrier material which is coated with alternating metal oxide layers with a high and low refractive index, wherein the difference between the respective refractive indexes is 0.1. The metal oxide layers are obtained in a wet process by hydrolysis of the corresponding water-soluble metal compounds, by separating, drying and optionally calcinating the pigment thus obtained.<br>
WO01/57257 Describes a orocess comprising the production of a substrate material, for example, silicon oxide, by physical vapor deposition and the wet chemical coating of the obtained fiakes with, for exanoie, Ti02. According to Example 4 of WO01/57287 silicon cxiae fiakes having a thickness of 200 nm and a particle size of 1 to 100 ^m are obtained by ?VD and then coatee by a wet chemical process with Ti02.<br>
EF-A-8Q35-S discloses coloured pigments containing (a) a core consisting of an essentially transparent o: metallic reflecting material, and (b) at least a coating consisting essentially of one or more silicone oxides, the moiar ratio of oxygen to a silicon being 0.25 to 0.95;<br>
it is the object of the present invention to provide interference pigments, having higher color strength and color purity as compared with interference pigments known from the state of the<br><br>
Said object has been soivecd by pigments, the particles of which generally have a length of from 2 μm to 5 mm, a width of from 2 |μm to 2 mm, and a thickness of from 20 nm to 2 μm, and a ratio of length to thickness of at least 2:1, wherein the particles contain a core of SiOy with 0.70 
Tne term "SiC. with C.7C ≤  \ ≤  1.95" means that the molar ratio of oxygen to silicon at the average value of the silicon oxide layer is from 0.70 to 1.95. The composition of the silicon oxide layer can be determined by ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis).<br>
According t: the presen; indention the term "aluminum" comprises aluminum and alloys of aluminum. Alloys of aiuminum are, for example described in G. Wassermann in Ullmanns Enzykiopadie der tocustrieiier Cnemie, 4. Auflage, Verlag Chernie, Weinheim, Band 7, S. 2£1 to 292. Especially suitaoie are the corrosion stable aluminum alloys described on page 1C to "12 of WO00/12SS4. wnich comprise besides" o'f aluminum silicon, magnesium, manganese, copper, zinc, nick©;, vanadium, lead, antimony, tin, cadmium, bismuth, titanium, Chromium and/or iron in amounts of less than 20 % by weight, preferably less than 10 % by weight.<br>
Suitable metals for the sem:-t:ansparent metal layer are, for example. Cr: Ti, Mc, W, A!, Cu, Ac. Au, or J\;. The $emi-:ra~;sparen: metal layer has typically a thickness of between 5 and 25 nm. especiai'y between 5 and 1c nm. The SiOy substrates can have a metal layer only on one paraiie' surface, but prefsraoiv the metal layer is present on both parallel faces of the<br>
suostrate.<br>
The metal/SiOy/metal flakes are prepared by a PVD process comprising the steps:<br>
a)	vapour-deposition of a separating agent onto a (movable) carrier to produce a separating agent layer,<br>
b)	vapour-deposition of a metal layer onto the separating agent layer,<br><br>
c)	vapour-deposition of an SiCy layer onto the metal layer, wherein 0.70 £ y £ 1.80,<br>
d)	vapour-deposition of a metal layer onto the SiOy layer,<br>
e)	dissolution of the separating agent layer in a solvent, and 0 separation of the metal'SiGyme-ia!-flakes from the solvent.<br>
Alternatively the metal layer can be obtained by wet chemical coating or by chemical vapor deposition, to: example, gas pnase deposition of metal carbonyls. The substrate is suspended in an aqueous and'or organic solvent containing medium in the presence of a metal compound and is deposited onto the substrate by addition of a reducing agent. The metal compound is, for examplel, silver nitrate or nickel acetyl acetonate (WO03/37993).<br>
According to US-5-3,536,520 nickel chloride can be used as metal compound and hypophosphite can be used as reducing agent. According to EP-A-353544 the following compounds can be used as reducing agents for the wet chemical coating: aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde: oenzalaldehyde), ketones (acetone), carbonic acids and salts thereof (tar:aric acid, ascorbinic acid), reductones (isoascorbinic acid, triosereductone, reductine acid}, and reducing sugars (glucose).<br>
If semi-transparent metal layers are desired, the thickness of the metal layer is generally between 5 anc 25 nm, especially between 5 and 15 nm.<br>
If pigments witr metallic appearance are desired, the thickness of the metal layer is &gt; 25 nm tc IOC nm, preferably 30 tc 50 nm. If pigments with colored metal effects are desired, aoditionai layers of colored or colorless metal oxides, metal nitrides, metai suldfides and/or metais ca~ oe deposited, ~~hese layers are transparent or semi-transparent, it is preferred tr.a: iaye-s :" nigr index o* refraction and layers of low index of refraction alternate or that :ne layer := present, whereir- within the layer the index of refraction is gradually changing. It is possible 'or the weatherinc resistance to be increased by means of an additional coating, which at the same time causes an optima! adaption to the binder system (EP-A-268918 and<br>

Levers of oxides of the metais zirconium, titanium, iron and zinc, oxide hydrates of those metals, iron titanates, titanium suboxides or mixtures thereof are preferably applied by precipitation by a wet chemical method, it Deing possible, where appropriate, for the metal oxides to be reduced. In the case of the wet chemical coating, the wet chemical coating methods developed for the -production o\ peariescent pigments may be used; these are described, for example, in DE-A-14 67 458, DE-A-19 5S 988, DE-A-20 09 566, DE-A-22 14 545, DE-A-22 15 191, DE-A-22 44 298: DE-A-2S rf2 331, DE-A-25 22 572, DE-A-31 37 808, DE-A-31 37 809, DE-A-31 51 343, DE-A-31 51 354, DE-A-31 51 355, DE-A-32 11602 and DE-A-32 35 017, DE 195 99 88. WO 93/08237, WO 98/53001 and WO03/6558.<br>
The metal oxide of high refractive index is preferably Ti02 and/or iron oxide, and the metal oxide of low refractive index is preferably Si02. Layers of T1O2 can be in the rutile or anastase modification, wherein the rutile modification is preferred. Ti02 layers can also be reduced by known means, for example ammonia, hydrogen, hydrocarbon vapor or mixtures thereof, or metal powders, as described in EP-A-735,114, DE-A-3433657, DE-A-4125134, EP-A-332071, EP-A-707,050 or W093'19131.<br>
"or the purpose of coating, tne substrate particles are suspended in water and one or more hydrolysabie metal salts are aooec at a pH suitable for the hydrolysis, which is so selected that tne metal oxides or "metal cxiae nydrates are precipitated directly onto the particles without subsidiary precipitation, occurring. Tne pH is usually kept constant by simultaneously metering in a base. The pigments are tner separated off, washed, dried and, where appropriate, calcinated, it being possible tc optimise tne calcinating temperature with respect to the coating in question. If desired, after individual coatings nave been applied, the pigments can be separated off, dried and, wnere appropnate, calcinate! and then again re-suspended for the purpose of precipitating turner levers.<br>
Tne metai cxibe layers are a:sc obtainable, for example, in analogy to a methoc described in DE-A-195 C 307, by producing the metal oxide layer by controlled hydrolysis of one or more metai acic esters, where appropriate in the presence of an organic solvent and a basic catalyst, b\. means 0' a so-ge process. Suitable basic catalysts are, for example, amines, such as thethyiamine, e:~yienediamine, tributylamine, dimethylethanolamine and methcxy-prooylamine Tne prganic so'ven* T a water-miscible organic solvent such as a C^aicoho!. especially isopropanol.<br><br>
Suitable metal acid esters are selected from alkyl and aryl alcoholates, carboxylates, and carboxyl-radicai- or alkyl-radicai- or aryl-radical-substituted alkyl alcoholates or carboxylates of vanadium, titanium, zirconium, silicon, aluminium and boron. The use of triisopropyi aluminate, teuaisopropy! titanate, tetraisopropyl zirconate, tetraethyl orthosilicate and triethy1 borate is preferred. In addition, acetylacetonates and acetoacetylacetonates of the aforementioned metals may be used. Preferred examples of that type of metal acid ester are zirconium acetylacetonate, aluminium acetylacetonate, titanium acetylacetonate and diisobutyloleyl acetoacetylaiuminate or diisopropyloleyl acetoacetylacetonate and mixtures of metal acid esters, for example Dynasi® (Huls), a mixed aluminium/silicon metal acid ester.<br>
As a metal oxide having a high refractive index, titanium dioxide is preferably used, the method described in US-B-3 552 001 being used, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, for application of the titanium dioxide layers.<br>
An aqueous titanium salt solution is slowly added to a suspension of the material being coated, whic~ suspension has-been heated to about 50-100°C, especially 70-80°C, and a substantially constant pH vaiue of about from 0.5 to 5, especially about from 1.2 to 2.5, is maintained Dy simultaneously metering in a base such as, for example, aqueous ammonia solution or aoueous alkali metal hydroxide solution. As soon as the desired layer thickness of precipitated "HO: nas been achieved, the addition of titanium salt solution and base is stopped.<br>
This metnoc a: so referred tc as the "titration method", is distinguished by the fact that an excess of titanium salt is avoided. That is achieved by feeding in for hydrolysis, per unit time, only that amount whic~ is necessary for even coating with the hydrated Ti02 and which can be taken UP per unit time :: tie avaiiaoie surface of the particles being coated. In principle, the anatase form: of TiQ2 forms o- tne surface of tne starting pigment. By adding small amounts of Sn02, however, it is possible tc force the rutiie structure to be formed. For example, as described in WO 93/0823". tin dioxide can be deposited before titanium dioxide precipitation and the product coated with minium dioxioe can be calcined at from 800 to 900CC.<br>
The TiO: car optionally oe reoucec by usual procedures: US-B-4,948,631 (NH3, 750-850 °C -, W083.   r" 3   (rv, &gt; 9X °2, or DE-A-19843014 (solid reduction agent, such as, for example, silicon, &gt; 600 °C).<br><br>
Where appropriate, an Si02 (protective) layer can be applied on top of the titanium dioxide layer, for which the following method may be used: A soda waterglass solution is metered in to a suspension of the materia! being coated, which suspension has been heated to about 50-100°C, especially 70-80cC. The.pH is maintained at from 4 to 10, preferably from 6.5 to £.5 by simultaneously adding 10 % hydrochloric acid. After addition of the waterglass solution, stirring is carried out for 30 minutes.<br>
It is possioie tc obtain pigments that are more intense in colour and more transparent by applying, or top of the Ti02 layer a metal oxide of "low" refractive index, that is to say a refractive index smalier than about 1.65, such as Si02, Ai203, AIOOH, B2O3 or a mixture thereof, preferably Si02, and applying a further Fe2C3 and/or Ti02 layer on top of the latter layer. Such multi-coated interference pigments comprising a silicon oxide substrate and alternating metal oxide layers of with high and low refractive index can be prepared in analogy to the processes described in WO9&amp;'530-J and WO99/20695.<br>
It is, in addrJon. possible to modify the powder colour of the pigment by applying further layers such as, for example, coloured metal oxides or Berlin Blue, compounds of transition metals, e.g.<br>
Fe, Cu. Ni. Zz, Cn or organic compounds such as dyes or colour lakes.<br>

Layers, which are essentially free of absorption, can be obtained, if the growing SiOy layer is irradiated with UV light during evaporation (DE-A-1621214). It is possible to obtain SiO-,.5 layers, which do not aosorb in the visible region and have a refractive index of 1.55 at 550 nm, by so-called "reactive evaporation" of SiO in a pure oxygen atmosphere (E.

On its further course, the beit-form carrier, which is closed to form a loop, runs through dynamic vacuum lock chambers of known mode of construction (cf. US-B-6,270,840) into a region of from 1 tc 5 x 1Q4 Pa pressure, preferably from 600 to 104 Pa pressure, and . especially from 10~ tc 5 x 1Cfc" Fa pressure, where it is immersed in a dissolution bath. The temperature of the solvent snouic be so selected that its vapour pressure is in the indicated pressure range. With mechanical assistance, the separating agent layer rapidly dissolves and the product layer breaks up into flakes, which are then present in the solvent in the form of a suspension. On its further course, the belt is dried and freed from any contaminants still adhering to it. It runs through a second group of dynamic vacuum lock chambers back into the vaporisation chamber, where the process of coating with separating agent and product iayer of SiO is repeated.<br>
The suspension ther. present in both cases, comprising product structures and solvent, and the separating agent dissolved therein, is then separated in a further operation in accordance with a known technique. For that purpose, the product structures are first concentrated in the liquid and rinsec severa! times with fresh solvent in order to wash out the dissolved separating agent. The product, in the form of a solid that is still wet, is then separated off by filtration, sedimentation, cemrifugation, decanting or evaporation.<br>
T.ne product ca^ the~ be brought to the desired particle size by means of ultrasound or by mechanical means using nigh-speed stirrers in a liquid medium, or after drying the fragments in an air-jet mil; having a rotary classifier, or means of grinding or air-sieving and delivered for further use.<br>

The SiOy flakes have a high Diane-para!ie::srr. anc a aefinec thickness in the range of ± 10 %, especially r 5 % o: the average thickness. The SiCv fiakes nave a thickness of from 20 to 2000 nm, especially from 2: ic 500 nm. most preferec 50 tc 350 nm. It is presently preferred that the diameter of the f.akes be in a oreferred range of about 1-50 nm with a mor^referred range of aboul 5-40 am. Thus, tne aspect ratio o*' the fiakes of tne present invention is in a preferred range of about 2 to 3000 with a more preferee' range of about 14 to 800. If a TiOr layer is depositee as a materia o; nigh refractive index, the Ti02 layer has a thickness of 20 to 200 nm:. especially 20 to : 00 nm, anc mora especially 20 to 50 nm. Due to the smaller thickness distribution of the SiOy flakes as compared to commercially available Si02 flakes effect pigments having a higher color purity result.<br><br>

color strength and color purity can be obtained.	-   ,<br>
in another preferred embodiment of the present invention the SiOy flakes have a thickness of from 20 tc 200 nm, especially from 40 to 150 nm, most preferred 60 to 120 nm. The SiCy fiakes have a high piane-paraiieiism and a defined thickness in the range of ± 30 %, especially = 10 % of the average thickness. It is presently preferred that the diameter of the flakes be in a preferred range of about 1 to 60 \xm, especially 2 to 50 nm, with a more preferred range of about 5-40 urn. Thus, the aspect ratio of the flakes of the present invention is in a preferred range of about 4 to 1250 with a more preferred range of about 42 tc 670. If a TiO: layer is deposited as a material of high refractive index, the Ti02 layer has a thickness of 20 to 200 nm, especially 50 to 200 nm. The total thickness of the Ti02-coated SiOy flakes is especially 150 to 450 nm. Starting, for example, from SiOy flakes (y = 1.4 to 1.8) having a thickness of 90 nm r 30 % it is possible to obtain red (ca. 73 nm), green (ca. 150 nrr.V or biue [ca. 130 nm) interference pigments by selecting the thickness of the Ti02 ieyer. Due i: the small thickness distribution of the SiOyflakes effect pigments result having a high coio- ounty.

Metallic or nor-metallic. inorganic piateiet-shaped particles or pigments are effect pigments, ■especially me;a' effect pigments or interference pigments), that is to say, pigments that, oesiaes imparling colou- tc a" app'ication medium, impart additional properties, for example angle dependency of the colour (flop), lustre (not surface gloss) or texture. On metal effect pigments, substantially oriented reflection occurs at directionally oriented pigment particles.<br><br>
in the case o* interference pigments, the colour-imparting effect is due to the phenomenon of interference o*' light in thin, highly refractive layers.<br>
The .-freer; pigments according tc the invention can be used for ail customary purposes, for example for colouring polymers in the mass, coatings (including effect finishes, including those for the automotive sectc; and printing inks (including offset printing, intaglio printing, bronzing anc flexocraphic phnting;, and also, for example, for applications in cosmetics, in ink-jet printing, for dyeing textiles, glazes for ceramics and glass as well as laser marking of papers and plastics. Such applications are known from reference works, for example ' industrielie Organische Pigmente" (W. Herbst and K. Hunger, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheirrv'New York, 2nd, completely revised edition, 1995). When the pigments according to the invention are interference pigments (effect pigments), tney are gonioenromatic and result in brilliant, highly saturated (lustrous) colours. They are accordingly ver&gt; especially suitable for combination with conventional, transparent pigments, for example organic pigments sucn as, for example, diketopyrrolopyrroles, quinacridones, dicxazines, pe-yteries jsoindoiinones etc., it being possible for the transparent pigment tc have a simiie.- colour tc the effect pigment. Especially interesting combination effects are ootained, noweven in analogy tc, ?or example, EP-A-388 932 or EP-A-402 943, when the coiour of the vansparen; pigment and that of the effect pigment are complementary. "~ne pigments according tc the invention can be used with excellent results for pigmenting high moiecu.a' weight organic material<br>
"ne hig- mo-ecu.ar weight organic material for the pigmenting of which the pigments or pigment compositions according tc the invention may be used may be of natural or synthetic origin. High moiecjia* weight organic materials usually have molecular weights of about from 1C:' TC \0S z ~-o D" eve- mce. ""hey may be, for example, natural resins, drying oiis; rupee-or casei^.. z- -.a:j-a; sucstanoes ceriveti therefrom, such as chlorinated rubber, oi'-modifiec ateyc resins. , iscose. ceiiuiose etners or esters, such as ethylceliuicse, celiulose acetate, ceiijicse prop'onate, celuiose acetooutyrate or nitrocellulose, but especially totally synthetic organic polymers : thermosetting plastics and thermoplastics), as are obtained by poiymerisatb- pciyconcensaticn or polyaddition. From the class of the polymerisation resins there may ce mentioned, especially, polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene or posy:sopjryie~e anc ais: suostitutec potyolefins. such as polymerisation products of viny; cnionoe, v;~: ^cetai- sye^e. atryionirriie, acryiic acid esters, methacrylic acid esters or butadiene, anc aiso copoiymerisation products of the said monomers, such as especially ABS or EVA.<br><br>
From the series of the polyaddition resins and poiycondensation resins there may be mentioned, for example, condensation products of formaldehyde with phenols, so-called phenopiasts, and condensation products of formaldehyde with urea, thiourea or meiamine, so-called aminopiastsr.anc tne polyesters used as surface-coating resins, either saturated, such as aikyc resins, or unsaturates such as maieate resins; also linear polyesters and polyamides, DO;vurethanes or silicones.<br>
"""-&gt;£ said hig.u molecular weicm compounds may be present singly or in mixtures, in the form Q:* clastic masses or melts. They may also be present in the form of their monomers or in the poiymerised state in dissolved form as film-formers or binders for coatings or printing inks, sucn as, for example, boiied linseed oil, nitrocellulose, alkyd resins, melamine resins and urea-formaldehvde resins or acrviic resins.<br>
Depending on the intended purpose, it has proved advantageous to use the effect pigments or effect pigment compositions according to the invention as toners or in the form of preparations. Depending on tne conditioning method or intended application, it may be advantageous to add certain amounts of texture-improving agents to the effect pigment before or after the conditioning process, provided that this has no adverse effect on use of the effect pigments for colouring high molecular weight organic materials, especially povethyiene. Suitaoie agents are, especially, fatty acids containing at least 18 carbon atoms, tcr exampie stearic or behenic acid, or amides or metal salts thereof, especially magnesium salts, and ais: piasticisers waxes, resin acids, such as abietic acid, rosin soap, alkylphenois c aliphatic aicohois, such as stearyl alcohol, or aliphatic 1,2-dihydroxy compounds containing from £ to 22 carbon atoms, such as 1,2-dodecanedio!, and also . modified edrophonium maieate resins o: fumaric acid colophonium resins. The texture-improving agents are acdec in amounts of preferably from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, especially from 2 to * 5 % by 'weight, based on tne end product.<br>

A pigmented supstance composition comprising t high molecular weight organic materia! and from 0.01 tc SC % by weight, preferably from: 0.1 tc 30 % by weight, based on the high molecular weight organic materia., of an pigment according to the invention is advantageous. Concentrations o\ from : to 20% by weight, especially of about 10% by weight, can often be used in practice.<br>
-\\Z' cor.cen::-a:;cns. :o- examoie tncse above 30% by weight, are usually in tne form c* concentrates ;*masterbatches"} whicn can be used as colorants for producing pigmented materials having a relatively low pigment content, the pigments according to the invention<br><br>
having an extraordinarily low viscosity in customary formulations so that they can stilt be processed well.<br>
For the purpose of pigmenting organic materials, the effect pigments according to the invention may be used singly, it is, however, also possible, in order to achieve different hues or colour effects, to adc any desired amounts of other colour-imparting constituents, such as white, coloured, black or effect pigments, to the high molecular weight organic substances in addition to the effect pigments according to the invention. When coloured pigments are usee in admixture with the effect pigments according to the invention, the total amount is preferably from 0.1 to 10 % by weight, based on the high molecular weight organic material. Especially high goniochromicity is provided by the preferred combination of an effect pigment according to the invention with a coloured pigment of another colour, especially of a complementary colour, with colorations made using the effect pigment and colorations made using the coloured pigment having, at a measurement angle of 10°, a difference in hue (AH*) of from 20 to 340, especially from 150 to 210.<br>
Preferably, tne effect pigments according to the invention are combined with transparent coloured pigments, it being possible for the transparent coloured pigments to be present either in the same medium as the effect pigments according to the invention or in a neighbouring medium. An exampie of an arrangement in which the effect pigment and the coloured pigment are advantageously present in neighbouring media is a multi-layer effect coating.<br>
The pigmenting of high moiecuia" weight organic substances with the pigments according to the invention is carried out. for example, by admixing such a pigment, where appropriate in the form o* a masteroatch. with the substrates using roll mills or mixing or grinding apparatuses. The pigmented material is then brought into the desired finai form using methods known per $e, sucr. as calendering, compression moulding, extrusion, coating, Douring or n ection moulding. Any additives customary in the plastics industry, such as piasttcisers. fibers or stabilisers, oar, be added to the polymer, in customary amounts, before or afte* hco'ooration of the pigment. In particular, in order to produce non-rigid shaped articles c TC -educe their brittieness. if is desirable to add plasticisers, for example esters of phosphoric ac;d; phthalic acta or seoacic acid, to the high molecular weight compounds prior to shaping.<br>
For pigmem.ng coatings anc ormtinc inks, the high molecular weight organic materials and tne effect pigments accorofnc t: tne invention, where appropriate together with customary additives sucn as, for example, fillers, other pigments, siccatives or plasticisers, are finely dispersed or dissolved in the same organic solvent or solvent mixture, it being possible for the individual components to be dissolved or dispersed separately or for a number of<br><br>
components tc De dissolved o* dispersed together, and only thereafter for all the components to be brought together.<br>
Dispersing an effect pigment according to the invention in the high molecular weight organic material being pigmented, anc processing a pigment composition according to the invention, are preferably carriec out suojec; to conditions under which only relatively weak shear forces occur so that the effect pigment is not broken up into smaller portions. Plastics comprising the pigment of the invention in amounts of 0.1 to 50 % by weight, in particular C.5 tc 7 % by weight, in the coating sector, the pigments of the invention are employed in amounts of C.l tc 10 % by weight. In the pigmentation of binder systems, for example for paints and printing inks for intaglio, offset or screen printing, the pigment is incorporated into the printing ink in amounts of 0.1 to 50 % by weight, preferably 5 to 30 % by weight and in particular 8 tc 15 % by weight.<br>
The colorations obtained, for example in plastics, coatings or printing inks, especially in coatings or printing inks, more especially in coatings, are distinguished by excellent properties, especially by extremely high saturation, outstanding fastness properties, high<br>
color purity and hign goniochromicity.<br>
Wnen the high molecular weight material being pigmented is a coating, it is especially a<br>
speciality coathc, very especially an automotive finish.<br>
The-effect pigments according to the invention are also suitable for making-up the lips or the<br>
skin and for coiourinc the hair or tne naiis.<br>

Examples<br><br>
example<br>
in a vacuum system which n its fundamental points is constructed analogously to the system described ir. 115-5-6,270,5^0, the following are vaporised, from vaporisers, in succession: sodium chloride (Nad) as separating agent at about 900°C, and silicon monoxide (SiO) as reaction product ol 5. ana Si02 at trom 1350 to 1550°C. The layer thickness of NaCi is typically 30-50 nm., that of SiOy being, depending on the intended purpose of the end product, from 100 tc 2000 nm. in *ne present case 200 nm. Vaporisation is carried out at about 0.02 Pa, amounting to about 11 g of Nad and 72 c of SiO per minute. For subsequently detaching the layers by dissolution of the separating agent the carrier on which vapour-deposition has taken place is sprayed at about 3000 Pa with deionised water and treated with mechanical assistance using scrapers and with ultrasound. Tne NaCi dissolves and the SiOy layer, which is insoluble, breaks up into flakes, Tne suspension is continuously removed from the dissolution chamber and, at atmospheric pressure, is concentrated by filtration and rinsed several times with deionised water<br>
in order to remove Na~ and 3" ions that are present. That is followed by the steps of drying and heating the plane-parallel SiCX structures in the form of loose material at 500 to 600°C for two hours in an oven through which air heated to 500 to 600°C is passed. After cooling, comminution<br>
and grading by ar-sieving are camiec out.<br>
