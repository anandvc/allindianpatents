Cross Reference to Related Application<br>
This application claims priority to, and incorporates by reference in full, the following<br>
co-pending applications of Applicant: U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/726,012,<br>
filed October 12,2005, entitled "Compounds, Rosins, and Sizing Compositions", and U.S.<br>
Patent Application No. 11/386,898 filed March 22, 2006 entitled "Compounds, Rosins, and<br>
Sizing Compositions".<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to terpenoid compounds and rosins comprising terpenoid<br>
compounds. Some embodiments of terpenoid compounds and rosins comprising terpenoid<br>
compounds of the present invention can find application in sizing compositions operable to at<br>
least partially coat fibers such as glass fibers.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Diterpenoids are a class of compounds found in wood extractives of many tree species<br>
and can be generally grouped into two subclasses comprising abietanes and pimeranes.<br>
Abietane-type acids have an isopropyl chain at the C-13 position while primerane-type acids<br>
have methyl and vinyl substituents at this position. Wood extractives comprising abietane<br>
and primerane acids can comprise natural rosins.<br>
Several different types of natural rosins exist, including wood rosins, gum rosins, and<br>
tall oil rosins. Wood, gum, and tall oil rosins, however, are produced by various processes.<br>
Wood rosins, for example, are produced via a multistage purification and refining process<br>
involving solvent extraction of pine wood chips followed by solvent-solvent refining of the<br>
crude rosin extract. Gum rosins, nevertheless, are generally produced by a single stage flash<br>
distillation process wherein the terpene (terpentine) fraction is volatilized leaving the rosin as<br>
a bottoms product. Tall oil rosins are the by-products of the fractionation of tall oil.<br>
Although produced by varying processes, these natural rosins have similar<br>
components. Wood rosins and gum rosins, for example, comprise similar abietane and<br>
pimarane contents. Gas chromatographic analysis reveals that wood and gum rosins<br>
comprise various percentages of diterpenoid acids, such as pimaric acid, isopimaric acid,<br>
palustric acid, abietic acid, dehydroabietic acid, and neoabietic acid, in addition to other<br>
contents.<br>
Natural rosins comprising wood rosins, gum rosins, and tall oil rosins are useful in a<br>
variety of applications. Natural rosins, for example, are used in binders for inks, tackifying<br>
resins, and pressure sensitive adhesives.<br>
In some circumstances, natural rosins can be modified to demonstrate various<br>
physical and chemical properties. Modification of natural rosins can be accomplished<br>
through chemical modification of rosin components. Diterpenoid acid components of wood<br>
and gum rosins as delineated above, for example, can be chemically modified to produce<br>
chemically modified rosins. As used herein, a chemically modified rosin is defined as a rosin<br>
in which one or more components of the rosin has been chemically reacted. Chemically<br>
modified rosins are useful in a number of applications including paper production processes<br>
and sizings for natural and synthetic fibers. One area in which chemically modified rosins<br>
and natural rosins find application is in the treatment of glass fibers.<br>
Various chemical treatments exist for glass-type surfaces such as glass fibers to<br>
facilitate their processability as well as their interaction with other substances or media. In<br>
glass fiber applications, a coating composition or sizing composition is applied to at least a<br>
portion of individual glass filaments to protect the filaments from abrasion and to assist in<br>
processing of the filaments. As used herein, the terms "sizing composition," "sizing,"<br>
"binder composition," "binder," or "size" refer to a coating composition applied to glass<br>
filaments or glass fibers. Sizing compositions may provide protection through subsequent<br>
processing steps, such as those where the fibers pass by contact points in the winding of the<br>
fibers and strands onto a forming package, drying the aqueous-based or solvent based sizing<br>
composition to remove the water or solvent, twisting from one package to a bobbin, chopping<br>
in a wet or dry condition, roving into larger bundles or groups of strands, unwinding for use<br>
as a reinforcement, and other downstream processes.<br>
In addition, sizing compositions can play a dual role when placed on fibers that<br>
reinforce polymeric matrices in the production of fiber-reinforced plastics. In such<br>
applications, the sizing composition provides protection and also can provide compatibility<br>
between the fiber and the matrix polymer or resin. Glass fibers, for example, in the forms of<br>
woven and nonwoven fabrics and mats and rovings have been used with various matrices,<br>
such as thermosetting and thermoplastic resins, as reinforcing components. In such<br>
applications, it can be desirable to produce favorable interfacial interactions between the<br>
glass fiber and the polymer matrix while also facilitating processing and manufacturing<br>
considerations.<br>
2<br>
Sizing compositions can contain a variety of chemical species wherein each of the<br>
individual chemical species performs one or more functions. A sizing composition, for<br>
example, may comprise film forming agents that facilitate spreading of the sizing<br>
composition across the glass surface to ensure homogenous coating. Sizing compositions can<br>
also comprise coupling agents which promote favorable interaction of a glass surface with<br>
various matrices. In addition to film forming and coupling agents, sizing compositions can<br>
comprise various ionic or non-ionic lubricants, biocides, antistatic agents, antifoaming agents,<br>
and/or wetting agents.<br>
Diterpenoid compounds and natural and chemically modified rosins comprising such<br>
compounds can provide a number of desirable characteristics when coated on a glass fiber.<br>
Disadvantages under some circumstances currently exist, however, with some diterpenoid<br>
compounds and related rosins comprising these compounds. Diterpenoid derivatives and<br>
related rosins, for example, can be expensive and difficult to manufacture.<br>
It would be desirable to provide other terpenoid compounds and derivatives and rosins<br>
comprising such compounds and derivatives. It would additionally be desirable to provide<br>
sizing compositions comprising such terpenoid compounds and derivatives.<br>

These and other embodiments of the present invention are described in greater detail<br>
in the detailed description of the invention which follows.<br>

wherein n is an integer selected from the ranges provided in Table I below.<br>
Table I - Ranges for n in Compounds of Formula I<br>
9<br>
General considerations for selecting a value for n can include achieving acceptable water-<br>
dispersability properties of compounds of Formula (I) as well as providing desirable film<br>
forming properties. In some embodiments, larger values of n, for example, can increase the<br>
hydrophilic character of some compounds of Formula (I) thereby increasing their water-<br>
dispersability.<br>
The following is an example of a reaction mechanism for synthesis of some<br>
embodiments of compounds of Formula (I):<br>
10<br>
Abietic acid of formula (II) undergoes a 1,2 hydrogen shift to provide a compound of<br>
formula (III). The compound of formula (III) can be subsequently reacted with maleic<br>
anhydride or a suitable dienophilic derivative thereof, in a [4 +2] cycloaddtion reaction<br>
(Diels-Alder reaction) to produce compound (IV).<br>
In some embodiments, the anhydride moiety of compound (IV) can be esterified with<br>
a polyethylene glycol or an alkoxylated polyethylene glycol, including monoalkoxylated<br>
polyethylene glycols such as (MPEG), of suitable molecular weight. Molecular weights for<br>
polyethylene glycols and alkoxylated polyethylene glycols that can be used in some<br>
embodiments of the present invention are provided in Table II below. As with the n values<br>
discussed above in connection with Table I, similar considerations can be important in<br>
selecting a molecular weight of polyethylene glycols or alkoxylated polyethylene glycols that<br>
can be used to synthesize some embodiments of compounds of the present invention. Table<br>
II is a list of exemplary ranges.<br>
12<br>
Table II - Molecular Weight Ranges for Polyethylene Glycols and<br>
Alkoxylated Polyethylene Glycols for the Synthesis Compounds<br>
of Formula I<br>
In some embodiments, polypropylene glycols and poly(l,4 butanediols) having molecular<br>
weights similar to those listed in Table II are suitable for esterifying the anhydride moiety of<br>
compound (TV). In some embodiments, carbitol [2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)-ethanol] and carbitol<br>
derivatives, such as butyl carbitol (diethylene glycol monobutyl ether), are suitable for<br>
esterifying the anhydride moiety of compound (IV). Some embodiments of the present<br>
invention additionally contemplate various other diols and polyols suitable for esterifying the<br>
anhydride moiety of compound (IV).<br>
The esterification of the anhydride moiety yields compound (V). Compound (V) can<br>
be reacted with two equivalents of a glycidyl ester (VI), (VII) in ring opening reactions to<br>
produce a compound of Formula (I). In some embodiments of the present invention, glycidyl<br>
esters (VI), (VII) in the synthetic scheme above can be the same or different. In some<br>
embodiments, glycidyl esters can comprise alkyl glycidyl esters such as glycidyl stearate,<br>
glycidyl butyrate, and glycidyl neodecanoate as well as alkenyl glycidyl esters such as<br>
glycidyl methacrylate, and derivatives thereof. In some embodiments, glycidyl esters<br>
comprising phenyl or aryl moieties, such as glycidyl cinnamate, glycidyl benzoate, glycidyl-<br>
4-tert-butyl benzoate, and derivatives thereof, might be used. Conversely, in other<br>
embodiments, glycidyl esters used in esterification might not include glycidyl esters<br>
comprising phenyl or aryl moieties.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, the starting compound (II) in the<br>
synthetic scheme above can comprise palustric acid, 7-oxopalustric acid, and/or 7-oxo-11,12-<br>
dihydroxy-8,13-abietadien acid. Moreover, in some embodiments, the dienophile in the [4 +<br>
2] cycloaddition reaction can comprise maleic acid, itaconic acid, or fumaric acid.<br>
13<br>
In embodiments of the present invention, the reaction sequence provided above can<br>
yield reaction products in addition to those of Formula (I). In some embodiments, for<br>
example, the anhydride moiety can be di-esterifiedwith a polyethylene glycol producing a<br>
compound having two polyethylene glycol chains. The resulting compound may further react<br>
with one equivalent of glycidyl ester at the remaining free carboxylic acid functionality. In<br>
some embodiments, the anhydride moiety can be di-esterified with any combination of<br>
suitable esterification chemical species provided above.<br>
Embodiments of compounds of Formula (I) can exhibit a wide range of physical and<br>
chemical properties facilitating their use in many applications, including, without limitation,<br>
sizing compositions. In some embodiments of the present invention; physical and chemical<br>
properties of compounds of Formula (I) can be varied and/or tailored according to the<br>
chemical identities of R1 - R11. In some applications, for example, compounds with<br>
hydrophobic properties may be desirable. In some embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
hydrophobicity of a compound of Formula (I) may be increased by selecting the identity of<br>
any and/or all of the substituents R1 - R11 to comprise hydrophobic chemical species such as<br>
alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl groups. In some embodiments, alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups<br>
comprising extensive chain branching or increased numbers of carbon atoms may be chosen<br>
to increase the hydrophobic character of compounds of Formula (I). The hydrophobicity of<br>
compounds of Formula (I) may additionally be increased by selecting smaller values for n<br>
resulting in shorter polyethylene glycol chains.<br>
Similarly, in some applications, compounds with hydrophilic properties may be<br>
desirable. In some embodiments of the present invention, the hydrophilicity of compounds of<br>
Formula (I) may be increased by selecting the identity of any and/or all of the substituents R1<br>
- R11 to comprise more hydrophilic chemical species such as alkoxy groups, alkyl-amines,<br>
alkenyl-amines, amides, hydroxyl, alkyl-OH, alkenyl-OH, carboxyl, alkyl-COOH, and/or<br>
alkenyl-COOH. The hydrophilicity of compounds of Formula (I) may additionally be<br>
increased by selecting larger values for n resulting in longer polyethylene glycol chains.<br>
In some applications, compounds with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties<br>
may be desirable. In some embodiments, compounds of Formula (I) may be produced having<br>
hydrophobic regions and hydrophilic regions. In one embodiment, for example, substituents<br>
R1- R3 can be selected from hydrophobic chemical species while substituents R8 - R10 can<br>
be selected from more hydrophilic chemical species or vice versa. In some embodiments,<br>
substituents R1 - R3 and R8 - R10 can be selected from hydrophobic chemical species, such as<br>

of Formula (I). Rosins comprising compounds of Formula (I) can further comprise<br>
compounds found in natural rosins and compounds found in other chemically modified<br>
rosins. For example, rosins comprising compounds of Formula (I) can be mixed with natural<br>
rosins and/or other chemically modified rosins in some embodiments. In some embodiments,<br>
compounds of Formula (I) can be added to natural rosins. In some embodiments, abietane<br>
components of natural rosins can be chemically modified to produce chemically modified<br>
rosins comprising compounds of Formula (I). In some embodiments, compounds of Formula<br>
(I) can be added to other chemically modified rosins, wherein the addition of the compounds<br>
of Formula (I) does not accord the rosin its chemically modified classification.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) can have a number of uses. One example of a use of<br>

Some embodiments of the present invention can be particularly useful in the production,<br>
assembly, and application of glass fibers prepared from E-glass compositions.<br>
Various embodiments of fiber glass strands of the present invention can have one or<br>
more desirable properties. For example, non-limiting embodiments of fiber glass strands can<br>
be at least partially coated with a sizing composition comprising a compound of Formula (I)<br>
that can result in the at least partially coated fiber glass strand being compatible with a<br>
number of resins while exhibiting desirable levels of broken filaments, desirable abrasion<br>
resistance, desirable strand integrity, desirable strand friction, or other properties, as well as<br>
various combinations thereof. The desired level of a particular property may depend on the<br>
application or end use. For example, relatively low strand friction may be desirable for some<br>
applications with a large number of contact points.<br>
In some embodiments, fiber glass strands comprise at least one glass fiber at least<br>
partially coated with a sizing composition of the present invention. The formation of fiber<br>
glass strands and the application of sizing compositions to glass fibers are generally known to<br>
those of skill in the art. Additional information regarding the formation of fiber glass strands<br>
and the application of sizing compositions to glass fibers can be found in paragraphs [0074]-<br>

Some embodiments of fiber glass strands at least partially coated with sizing<br>
compositions of the present invention can advantageously be compatible with a variety of<br>
resins based in part on the sizing composition. Embodiments of sizing compositions of the<br>

including, for example, screens, tapes, flooring products, aviation composite materials.<br>
aerospace composite materials, fabrics for marine applications, window shades, braided<br>
products, scrim fabrics, filters, and others. Such products can be formed from fiber glass<br>
strands of the present invention using techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Some embodiments of the present invention will now be illustrated in the following<br>
specific, non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Synthesis of a Species of Formula (I)<br>
A species of Formula (I) was prepared by chemically modifying abietane components<br>
of a natural rosin. 50 grams of maleic anhydride were added to a solution of 200 grams of<br>
Planebras Gum Rosin, available from BFB Enterprises, Inc., Panama City Beach Florida.<br>
The gum rosin and maleic anhydride were reacted at 180°C for three hours under nitrogen.<br>
The temperature of the reaction mixture was subsequently cooled to 150°C where 375 grams<br>
of a methoxypolyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of about 750 g/mol, such as<br>
CARBOWAX™ MPEG 750 available from Dow Chemical of Midland, Michigan, and 1<br>
gram of KOH were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was then raised to<br>
200°C. The resulting reaction mixture was maintained under nitrogen. The reaction mixture<br>
was cooled to 140°C and 150 grams of a glycidyl neodecanoate, such as Cardura E-10P from<br>
Resolution Performance Products, was added to the reaction mixture. After addition of the<br>
glycidyl ester, the temperature of the reaction mixture increased to 190°C. The reaction<br>
temperature was brought to 200°C and kept at 200°C for one hour. The result of this<br>
19<br>
synthesis is a chemically modified rosin. One of the reaction products in the chemically<br>
modified rosin is the following compound of Formula (VIII):<br>
It is to be understood that the amounts of reactants and solvents in the synthesis<br>
described above can be varied within the skill of one in the art. Moreover, the synthesis of<br>
compounds of Formula (I) is not limited to that described above as the foregoing procedure is<br>
an example of one synthetic route according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>

A sizing composition comprising the ingredients in Table III may be prepared by first<br>
adding water (at approximately 60°F - 80°F) for the rosin to a premix bucket and beginning<br>
agitation. The rosin was then added to the water and agitated for ten minutes to disperse the<br>
rosin. The rosin was then transferred to a main mix tank.<br>
Hot water for the lubricant was then added to a premix bucket with agitation. The<br>
lubricant was added to the hot water and agitated for ten minutes to disperse the lubricant.<br>
The lubricant dispersion was then added to the main mix tank.<br>

begun. The acetic acid was then added to the cold water with agitation. The A-174 silane<br>
was then added to the acidified cold water and agitated for five minutes or until the solution<br>
was clear-blue in color. The first silane solution was then transferred to the main mix tank.<br>
For the second silane, cold water was first added to a premix bucket and agitation was<br>
begun. The acetic acid was then added to the cold water with agitation. The A-187 silane<br>
was then added to the acidified cold water and agitated for five minutes or until the solution<br>
was clear. The second silane solution was then transferred to the main mix tank.<br>
For the third silane, cold water was added to a premix bucket and agitation was<br>
begun. The acetic acid was then added to the cold water with agitation. The A-l 100 silane<br>
was then added to the acidified cold water and agitated for five minutes or until the solution<br>
was clear. The third silane solution was then transferred to the main mix tank.<br>
The wax, defoamer, and the biocide were then sequentially added to the main mix<br>
tank. Cold water was added to the main mix tank to dilute the sizing composition to a final<br>
volume of thirty (30) gallons. The main mix tank was agitated for ten minutes. The sizing<br>
composition had a total percent solids of 8.0% and a pH of 4.5.<br>
