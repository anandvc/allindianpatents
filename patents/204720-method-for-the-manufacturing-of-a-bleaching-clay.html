"METHOD FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF A BLEACHING CLAY"<br>
OIL-DRI CORPORATION OF AMERICA, of 410 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60611,United States of America.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
i<br><br>
METHOD OF MAKING BLEACmNG CLAY<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a method of making a bleaching clay effective for the removal of color impurities found in mineral, vegetable, and animal oils. Background of the Invention<br>
Acid treated clays are routinely used for adsorptive purification of petroleum products and oils (both edible and nonedible) derived from vegetable or animal sources. With the traditional focus having been on the decolorizing effect, clay and clay-like materials used for oil purification are commonly called bleaching clays. Targeted color impurities typically present in oils include, for example, carotenoids, xanthophylls, xanthophyll esters, chlorophyll, tocopherols, as well as oxidized fatty acids and fatty acid polymers.<br>
A historical method of removing colored impurities from oils involved intimately contacting the oil with "Fuller's earth," an imprecise label applied to mixtures of clay minerals having oil-bleaching properties, but thought to contain mostly palygorskite, sepiolite, and smectite. See A.D. Rich, "Bleaching Clay," Industrial Minerals &amp; Rocks, 3rd Ed., AIMMPE, N.Y., pp. 93-101 (1960). In the early 1900s, it was discovered that the ability of Fuller's earth and related 2f)      clay minerals to adsorb or otherwise eliminate color impurities from oil is<br>
improved by acid activation. Accordingly, acid-activated clays are more widely used for bleaching purposes.<br>
In effect, conventional acid treatment of clay replaces exchangeable cations, such as K+, Na+, and Ca2+, by H+ in the intralamellar space of the clay's crystalline lattice and also leaches out some of the Al3+, Fe3+, and Mg2+ metal cations. Acid treatment thus renders the clay physically more porous and electrochemically more active.<br>
The general process of acid-activation of clays, as used today in industry, includes grinding clay for uniform activation and dispersion in water,<br><br><br>
slurrying the ground clay in water and then adding acid to the clay slurry. Usually about 6 to 8 hours of acid digestion is necessary to properly acid-activate the clay. The digested slurry then is washed substantially tree of dissolved salts, such as iron and aluminum sulfates or chlorides, depending upon the particular mineral 5      acid used. The acid-activated clay then is dewatered, such as by filtration, and the resulting filter cake is dried and subsequently ground to product specifications.<br>
The following patents describe various processes for treatment of clay to enhance the filtering characteristics of the clay in the removal of colorizing compounds: U.S. Patent No. 1,402,112 to Tellier; U.S. Patent No. 1,408,656 to<br>
10      Stratford; 1,408,655 to Stratford; U.S. Patent No. 1,524,843 to Ruprecht; U.S. Patent No. 1,544,210 to Bierce; U.S. Patent No. 1,731,702 to Black; U.S. Patent No. 1,739,734 to Raine et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 3,029,783 to Sawyer et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 3,617,215 to Sugahara; U.S. Patent No. 4,717,699 ; U.S. Patent No. 4,847,266; and U.S. Patent No. 4,919,818 to Alexander.<br>
15	U.S. Pat. No. 3,617,215 to Massaire et al., for example, describes a<br>
process for the production of acid-activated bleaching clay that entails mixing an aqueous clay slurry with a high dose of concentrated acid at elevated temperatures (100°C to 121 °C), followed by washing and drying of the acidulated product. This prior art method results in high levels of residual acid effluent and salts<br>
20      thereof whose removal and disposal costs are expensive, however. Other<br>
commercial manufacturing process for the production of bleaching clay avoids the use of large amounts of concentrated acid but requires a high-temperature (about 1000°F), and therefore high-cost, calcining step to calcine the raw clay (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 3,029,783 to Sawyer et al.).<br>
25	The raw clay starting materials used to produce bleaching clays<br>
contain varying types of sand, which may include quartz, feldspar, mica and other relatively hard minerals. Because they foul oil processing equipment and offer at most negligible bleaching action, these sand constituents are, in effect, inert bleaching clay contarninants.<br><br><br>
-3-<br>
The present invention concerns an improved method of producing activated bleaching clay having a reduced amount of inert constituents. Summary of the Invention<br>
A bleaching clay manufacturing method according to the present J      invention provides improved acid activation of the clay mineral without substantial deterioration of the clay mineral structure. The bleaching clay product is prepared by slurrying particulate palygorskite clay starting material with water to form an aqueous slurry, removing sand from the aqueous slurry to form a beneficiated slurry, conditioning the beneficiated slurry by combining therewith a conditioning<br>
10      agent such as a pH modifier, a Lewis acid salt, and mixtures thereof, separating the conditioned slurry into an acidic filtrate and a conditioned clay concentrate, and drying the conditioned clay to a free flowing particulate mass, usually having a free moisture content of about 5 to 25 percent by weight, preferably 10 to 20 percent by weight.<br>
15	A preferred palygorskite clay starting material is a particulate<br>
naturally occurring palygorskite - smectite clay mineral having a pH value in the range of about 5 to about 9, preferably about 7 to about 9. The slurrying step is conducted such that the aqueous slurry has a clay solids content in the range of about 5 to about 30 weight percent, based on the total weight of the slurry. At a<br>
20      solids content above about 20 percent by weight a dispersant can be added, if desired, to enhance flow properties. In the slurry conditioning step, the beneficiated slurry is combined with a Lewis acid salt in an amount in the range of about 0.25 to about 3 weight percent (based on the weight of the solids) and/or a sufficient amount of a pH modifier to adjust the pH of the slurry to a value in the<br>
25      range of about 0.5 to about 6. The solid/liquid separation step is conducted such that the conditioned clay concentrate has a'solids content of 15 up to 50 weight percent, preferably 40 to 50 weight percent, based on the total weight of the concentrate.<br><br><br>
The resulting bleaching clay may be utilized for bleaching purposes<br>
in numerous applications for a wide variety of edible oils and the like.<br>

FIGURE 3 is yet another simplified flow diagram of a process for making bleaching clay according to the present invention. Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
While this invention is susceptible to embodiment in many different 15      forms, this specification and the accompanying drawings disclose only preferred forms as examples of the invention. The invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments so described, however. The scope of the invention is identified in the appended claims.<br>
Preferred starting materials for the present method are the natural 20      palygorskite clay minerals and the synthetic layered silicates that already exhibit some bleaching activity. The term "palygorskite clay" refers to a naturally occurring material composed primarily of fine-grained attapulgite minerals, which material can contain also smectite and is generally plastic at appropriate water contents and will harden when dried or fired. Although such clay usually contains 15      phyllosilicates, it also may contain other materials that impart plasticity and harden when dried or fired. Associated phases in clay may include materials that do not impart plasticity and organic matter. The term "clay mineral" refers to phyllosilicate minerals and to minerals which impart plasticity and which harden upon drying or firing. See generally. Guggenheim, S. &amp; Martin, R.T., "Definition<br>
■5<br><br>
of Clay and Clay Mineral: Joint Report of the AIPEA Nomenclature and CMS Nomenclature Committees," Clavs and Clav Minerals 43: 255-256 (1995).<br>
Clay minerals are characterized by a mineral structure formed by the arrangement of octahedral units and tetrahedral units or by stacked layers formed by an octahedral sheet and one or more tetrahedral sheets of the atoms that constitute the clay mineral structure. Illustrative are the two groups of naturally occurring clay.minerals.<br>
First is the hormite group, defined here as including palygorskite and sepiolite, which have channels formed by octahedral units and tetrahedral units of the clay mineral structure.<br>
Palygorskite (attapulgite), a mineral found in some clay deposits, is a hydrous silicate mineral represented by the ideal formula:<br>
(OH2)4(OH)2Mg5Si8O20*4H20. See, e.g., Grim, R.E., Clav Mineralogy, 2nd ed., McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York, N.Y. (1968), p. 115. Other members of the hormite group of minerals, such as sepiolite, can be associated with palygorskite.<br>
Second is the smectite group including montmorillonites and saponite, which are constituted by stacked layers formed by an octahedral sheet and more than one tetrahedral sheet, and mixtures of the foregoing. Smectite is a generic term that refers to a variety of related minerals also found in some clay deposits. The smectite minerals typically occur only as extremely small particles. Smectite is composed of units made of two silica tetrahedral sheets with a central alumina octahedral sheet. Each of the tetrahedra has a tip that points to the center of the smectite unit. The tetrahedral and octahedral sheets are combined so that the tips of the tetrahedra of each silica sheet and one of the hydroxyl layers of the octahedral sheet form a common layer. See Id, pp. 77-78. Some types of smectite minerals, e.g., Na-montmorillonite, exhibit intracrystalline swelling.<br><br><br>
In particular, the smectite family of clay minerals includes the various mineral species montmorillonite, beidellite, nontronite, hectorite and saponite, all of which can be present in the clay mineral in varying amounts.<br>
As noted above, other minerals, neither of the smectite genus nor of<br>
5      the hormite variety, are typically present in varying amounts in mined clay. These<br>
include opal, apatite, calcite, quartz, the feldspars, mica, amorphous silica<br>
(diatoms), kaolinite, pyrite and gypsum, among others. Of the enumerated minor<br>
constituents, the broad "sand" label is conventionally applied to the quartz,<br>
feldspars, mica, and other relatively hard minerals.<br>
10	A palygorskite-smectite variety of clay having a slurry pH value of<br>
about 5 to about 9 is the generally preferred for the present method of preparing<br>
bleaching clay. The pH value of the clay is. determined from a 5-weight percent<br>
slurry of the clay in distilled water. The slurry is agitated for fifteen minutes prior<br>
to measurement of the pH value by a conventional pH meter.<br>
15	FIGURE 1 illustrates a bleaching clay manufacturing process<br>
according to the present invention in block diagram format. FIGURE 2 is a like-formatted diagram that indicates another suitable process scheme.<br>
With general reference to FIGURES 1 and 2, raw clay starting<br>
material is slurried with water (recycled and make-up) such that the resulting<br>
20      aqueous slurry has a clay solids content in the range of about 5 to about 30 weight<br>
percent, based on the total weight of the slurry and the dry weight of clay. In the<br>
slurrying, water and clay are mixed with aggressive agitation (i.e. high shear<br>
blunging, dispersation, or disaggregation). Blunging may be carried out in a<br>
suitable mixer or series of mixers.<br>
25	Raw mined clay usually has a free moisture content in the range of<br>
about 40 to about 55 percent. The raw mined clay may crushed to a preferred particulate size prior to slurrying, usually less than one-half inch (about 13 mm) in effective diameter. A multi-stage size reduction is preferred because a complete<br>
"7<br><br>
WO 01/85336	PCT/USOI7I4625<br>
-7-<br>
crushing of raw clay also comminutes sand-like components, rendering these contaminants more difficult to remove from the clay.<br>
To enhance the Theological properties of the aqueous clay slurry, the slurrying step optionally can include the use of a dispersant such as sodium 5      metasilicate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, or disodium pyrophosphate, or sodium hexametaphosphate in an amount up to about 1 percent by weight, based on dry clay. Alternative dispersants suitable for present purposes are potassium oxalate or Na-polyacrylate (if clay is calcined at 200-400°C.<br>
Sand and sand-like particles are next removed from the aqueous<br>
10      slurry. A variety of processing methods and corresponding equipment are<br>
available for the sand removal step including centrifuges, wet-screens, flotation cells and cone classifiers. For a discussion of wet classification methods and equipment, see Perry's Chemical Engineering Handbook, 7th Ed., McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York, N.Y. (1997), pp. 19-23 to 19-30. A wet cyclone classifier is<br>
15      presently favored.<br>
Wet cyclone classifiers, also called hydrocyclones, have a top cylindrical section and a lower conical section terminating in an adjustable apex opening. According to the present invention, the aqueous clay slurry is pumped into the cylindrical portion of the hydrocyclone tangentially, thus producing<br>
20      centrifuging action and vortexing. The hydrocyclone cover has a downward-extending pipe called a vortex finder, which cuts the vortex and removes the overflowing clay slurry. The sand and sand-like particles travel down the sides of the steeply sided cone section and are removed at the apex in a partially dewatered form.<br>
25	For higher yields or enhanced sand removal, the sand removal step<br>
may be multistage fractionation. For example, the mostly sand underflow from a first stage hydrocyclone may be reslurried and directed to a second suitable sized<br>
	hydrocyclone downstream. The clay slurry overflows from the first and second<br>
stages are then combined for further processing.<br>

The beneficiated clay slurry resulting from the sand removal step next undergoes a conditioning step, in which the slurry is admixed with a Lewis acid salt and a pH modifier. The total solids content of the clay slurry during conditioning is an important aspect of the present invention. The total solids 5      content of the clay slurry during conditioning is maintained in the range of about 5 to about 30 weight percent, and preferably in the range of about 5 to about 15 percent, based on the total weight of the slurry. Conditioning is carried out at a temperature in the range of about ambient to about 80°C, preferably ambient to about 60°C.<br>
10	Because the total solids content of the beneficiated aqueous clay<br>
slurry resulting from the sand removal step necessarily varies according to the choice of separation methods and the solids content of the feed slurry, adjustments through make-up water or de-watering may be required to move the total solids content of the beneficiated slurry into the desired range. When, for example, a<br>
15      single hydrocyclone is employed for sand removal, the total solids content of the feed slurry is preferably in the range of about 15 to about 17 weight percent. Within this range of total solids for the input slurry, the hydrocyclone typically yields a beneficiated slurry overflow having a solids content in the range of about 10 to about 15 weight percent.    -<br>
20	The conditioning agent can be a pH modifier, a Lewis acid salt, or<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
The Lewis acid salt is added to the beneficiated slurry in an amount in the range of about 0.5 to about 3 weight percent (based on the dry zero moisture weight of the clay in slurry). While aluminum sulfate (Al2SO4)3 is the presently<br>
25      favored Lewis acid salt for this treatment, various other Lewis acids, including ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate and titanium sulfate, are also acceptable. The bleaching activity ability of clay is enhanced by introducing cations of high charge and relatively small radius, such as Al3+-, Fe2+, Fe3+, Zn2+ or Ti4+ that react with water to make a proton available for further reaction.<br><br>

The charge and the radius of the cation relates to the ionic potential of an ion. Mason, B., Principles of Geochemistry 2d, p. 155, Wiley and Sons, New York (1958). Ionic potential is the charge of the ion (Z) divided by the radius of the ion (r), and is, in effect, a measure of electronegativity. Id„ 155-56. Ionic 5      potentials of several ions are given in Table 1. Cations having ionic potentials in the range of about 2.5 to about 10 are preferred and are provided by the preferred Lewis acid salts of the present invention, i.e., aluminum salts such as aluminum chloride, aluminum sulfate, and the like, iron salts such as ferric sulfate, ferrous sulfate, and the like, zinc sulfate, and the like, as well as titanium salts such as 10      titanium sulfate and the like.<br><br>

The pH modifier is preferably an inorganic acid (or mixture thereof) such as, for example phosphoric acid, H2SO4 and HCl, but may also include<br><br><br>
WO 01/85336	PCT/US01/14625<br>
-10-<br>
■<br>
organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, and citric acid. A sufficient amount of pH modifier is added to adjust the pH value of the beneficiated slurry in the range of about 0.5 to about 6, and preferably in the range of about 1 to about 3. The amount of pH modifier required to effect the desired pH ■ 5      adjustment varies according to the pH value of the preconditioned clay, the pH modifier selected, the total solids concentration of the beneficiated slurry to be conditioned, the solids content of conditioned concentrate, and desired product pH target. Optimal acidification is a function of the degree of solid/liquid separation of the conditioned slurry. When a preferred clay starting material is utilized,<br>
10      which has a pH value in the range of about 5 to about 9, within the preferred total solids concentration for me beneficiated slurry, sufficient pH modifier is added in the conditioning step to create a slurry having an acid equivalent concentration in the range of about 0.01 to about 1 Normal (N), based on the total volume of the slurry. If the clay starting material is selected to have a pH value in the range of<br>
15      about 7 to about 9, sufficient acid is admixed to the beneficiated slurry to achieve an acid concentration in the preferred range of about 0.1 to about 0.4 Normal (N). If the clay starting material has a generally lower pH (about 5 to about 7), sufficient acid is admixed with the beneficiated slurry to achieve an acid concentration in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.3 Normal (N).<br>
20	The clay conditioning step may include a relatively limited<br>
temperature elevation as well as agitation. Any temperature elevation by heating is limited such that the slurry does not reach a clay-damaging boiling point. Accordingly, the slurry temperature during the conditioning step is preferably maintained in the range of about ambient to about 60 °C. For a batch mode<br>
25      operation, agitation can be readily achieved by the use of a static mixer, a commercially available blender, or the like expedient.<br>
The contact time for clay with conditioning agents may vary, but for efficient operation should not be less than 15 ininutes. The average agitation time<br><br><br>
WO 01/85336	PCT/US01/14625<br>
-11-<br>
is preferably in the range of about 15 minutes to about 1 hour during the conditioning step.<br>
Following the conditioning step, the conditioned slurry is separated into an acidic filtrate and a conditioned clay concentrate utilizing either 5      centrifugation, vacuum or pressure filtration or membrane filtration. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the separation is achieved in a high-pressure filter press. Suitable high-pressure filter presses are commercially available capable of generating up to 250 psi of pressure. For example, conditioned slurry is pumped to a chamber-type filter press having open drainage "<br>
10      to extract the acidic filtrate (or mother liquor) while filing the filter press chambers with the conditioned clay. The flow rate of the acidic filtrate, which decreases when the chambers of the filter press are filled, may serve as a signal to stop the flow of conditioned slurry into the filter press. Subsequently, a high-pressure "squeeze" is applied to the chambers to further increase the clay concentrate to 40-<br>
15      50 weight percent solids content.<br>
The clay cake in the filter press chambers may be washed with water introduced at elevated pressure (e.g. 20 to 150 psi). Washing the conditioned clay removes excess acid, dissolved iron, aluminum, magnesium, and calcium ions and other clay contaminates. The end of the optional washing step<br>
20      may be determined by monitoring the pH of the filtrate exiting the filter press.<br>
The resulting conditioned clay concentrate or mass may have a thick gel, paste-like, or a brittle cake-like consistency as desired, provided the solids content of the resulting clay mass is at least about 15 percent by weight, and can be up to about 50 percent by weight. The conditioned clay is dried via conventional<br>
25      process equipment suitable for particulate material such as a rotary, flash, fluid-bed or spray drier to a moisture content of no more than about 25 percent, based on the weight of the clay.

be optionally applied to the dried conditioned clay to yield clay having a desired particle size distribution.<br>
The acidic filtrate can be optionally neutralized to a pH value of about 3 to about 5 with a neutralizing agent such as calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in 5      a tank with agitator or other liquid mixing system. A portion of the neutralized filtrate can be recycled for use in the clay slurrying step, if desired. An unrecycled, filtrate purge containing precipitated salts like gypsum is routed to waste processing. However, acidic filtrate may be fully recycled so long as solid salts are purged prior to the clay slurrying step.<br>

Example 1:    Measured Bleaching Effect On Eosin Red Dye Solution<br>
A 0.1 weight percent red dye solution was prepared by dissolving 20      sufficient Eosin Red biological stain (source: Fisher Scientific) in de-ionized water. Twenty-gram samples of the dye solution were treated with beneficiated palygorskite-smectite bleaching clay conditioned with 0.25 N sulfuric acid at two different clay loadings: 0.4 grams of bleaching clay/20 milliliters of dye solution and 1 gram of bleaching clay/20 milliliters of dye solution. The beneficial 25      bleaching clay was added to the dye solution and swirled on a mechanical shaker for 15 minutes. Following mechanical shalang, the beneficiated bleaching clay was allowed to settle for one hour and then the settled mixture was centrifuged. - ■ One milliliter of the resulting liquid phase was extracted and diluted with 24 milliliters of distilled water to make a 1:25 dilution. The diluted sample was tested<br><br><br>
for light absorbance at a wavelength of 516 to 518 nanometers using a Beckman DU40 Spectrometer. Similar tests were performed with two commercially available bleaching clays. The results are presented in Table 2, below.<br>
