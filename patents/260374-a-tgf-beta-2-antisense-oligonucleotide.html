				<td>Pharmaceutical Composition<br>
This invention is related to effective medicaments in cancer therapy. The formation of cancer on the one hand is combined with the unwanted growth of tissue and on the other hand is combined with the formation of metastases. The research in this field has disclosed a lot of mechanisms but still there is no therapy without severe side effects inhibiting metastases or inhibiting tumor progression in solid tumors respectively such as prostate cancer, bladder carcinoma, colon cancer, endometrial cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, leukemia, lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or ovarian cancer. Further cancers in this field are mesothelioma, myeloma multiple, osteosarcoma ,renal cancer, esophageal cancer or soft tissue cancer. Tumor derived transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is discussed to play a pivotal role for the malignant progression by inducing metastasis, angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, it seems to play a central role in the escape mechanism from the immune System in tumor cells.<br>
But the role of TGF beta in the literature is diversely discussed. On the one hand there are experiments indicating that TGF-beta inhibits tumor growth, on the other hand there are experiments that point out that TGF-beta induces cell proliferation, which makes its role in the tumor therapy ambivalent.<br>
An additional point is that TGF-beta has a lot of different subclasses, TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta 3 whose specific roles in tumor progression are differently discussed, often summarized as TGF-beta and thus sometimes mixed up. The specific role of each TGF-beta subclass, namely TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta 3 are not so far sufficiently investigated.<br>
EP 1008 649 and EP 0695354 teaches that both, TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 antisense oligonucleotides can be used for manufacturing of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of breast tumor esophageal, gastric carcinomas and skin carcinogenesis. Whereas clinical studies seem to show, that in glioma the TGF-beta seems to play a key role and therefore the TGF-beta 2 antisense oligonucleotides are preferred targets for the treatment of e.g. glioma and breast cancer the Situation is completely different in other tumors.<br><br>
In prostate cancer for example (Wikstrom, P., Scand J Urol Nephrol 34 S. 85-94), as weH as in some other cancers, there are hints, that TGF-beta levels are increased, but it is not clear if this system can be manipulated for therapeutical purposes.<br>
It is known from interleukin 10 (IL-10) that it plays a central role in the regulation of the immune response. Since it was shown, that some interleuknvn 10 antisense oligonucleotides can enhance cell-mediated immune response it was important to find potent inhibitors of IL-10 in human to modulate the immune response in a way, that escape mechanisms of tumor cells are compensated, tumor growth is inhibited and the formation of metastases is reduced.<br>
Therefore St was a task of this invention to find appropriate   therapeutics for the treatnraent of tumors that inhibit the unwanted cell proliferation in tumor growth anchor in inhibit the formation of metastases.<br>
One task of this invention is to find therapeutics that inhibit the formation of metastases.<br>
Tumors such as bladder carcinoma, colon cancer, endometrial cancer, hepatocelltiilar carcinoma, leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, non-small cell lung canoar(NSCLC), ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer have poor prognosis and so far no successful therapy is found. This is also the case for tumors such as mesothelioma, myeloma multiple, osteosarcomna, renal cancer, esophageaB cancer or soft tissue cancer. Therefore it was the task of this invention to find new therapeutics, that have the property specifically inhibiting these tumors and the use of these therapeutics for the treatment of the respective cancer Another task of this invention is to find new inhibitors of interleukin 10 (IL-10) for modulating the immune system and appropriate methods of their synthesis as well as their use of those inhibitors for the preperation of pharmaceutical compositions preferred in cancer therapy and immunomodulation. The medtranism of antisense oligonucleotides seems to work by immunomodulating effects as well as by direct effects, which could be proofed in experimental studies. This is superior to state of the art inhibition of TGF-beta<br><br>
by e.g. antibodies, since we could show, that cell migration is more effectively inhibited by TGFbeta antisense oligonucleotides than it was possible with TGF-beta antibodies.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention have less side effects, show more efficacy, ferave more bioavailability, show more safety and/or improved chemical stability.<br>
We surprisingly discovered, that antisense oligonucleotides that inhibit the formation of TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2, TGF-beta 3, cell-cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), integrins, selectines, metalloproteases (MMPs), their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) and/or interleukin 10 specific antisense oligonucleotides inhibit the formation of mdtastases in tumor cell lines and in tumors.<br>
We further found that antisense oligonucleotides of TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 3 interleukin 10 Sntiibit the tumor proliferation of solid tumors such as bladder carcinoma, eaten cancer, endometrial cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer as well as of malignant myeloproliferative diseases such as leukaemia and lymphoma. Further indications for TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta3 and interleukin 10 antisense oligonucleotides are renal cancer, osteosarcoma, mesothelioma, myeloma multiple, esophageal cancer and/or soft tissue cancer.<br>
The antisense criigonucleotide of TGF-beta2 inhibits the tumor proliferation as described above for antisense oligonucleotides of TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta3 and/or interleukin.<br>
Another aspect of this invention are new superior antisense oligonucleotides inhibiting the formation of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and by this modulate the immune response.<br>
Yet another aspect of this invention is the production of IL-10 antisense oligonucleotides..<br>
A further aspect of this invention is the use of interleukin 10 antisense oligonucleotides for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition. Antisense oligonucleotides of interleukin 10 are also used for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of metastases and/or tumor growth and are used in the treatment of these illnesses.<br><br>

One oligpmucleotide of this invention is used for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting the formation of metastases in cancer treatment, oligonucleotides of this invention are also used for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of bladder carcinoma, colon cancer, endometrial cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, leukaemia, lymphoma, melanoma, non-small oil lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer or soft tissue cancer ad new oligonucleotides inhibiting the synthesis of IL-10 are part of this invention as well.<br>
The terai» oligonucleotide or nucleic acid refer to multiple nucleotides (i.e. molecules comprising a sugar (e&amp; ribose or deoxyribose) linked to a phosphate group and to an variable organic base, which is either a substituted pynmidine (e.g. cytosine (C), thymine (T) or uracil (U)) or a substituted purine (e.g. adbnine (A) or guanine (G)) or a modification thereof. As used herein, the terms refer to oligoribsnucleotides as well as oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The terms shall also include oligonudfeosides (i.e. a oligonucleotide without the phosphate) and any other organic base containing polymer.<br>
Whereas the oligonucleotides of this invention are single stranded, in some embodiments at least parts of the angle-stranded nucleic acid is double-stranded. Double-stranded molecules may be more stable in vivo, while single-stranded molecules may have increased activity.<br>
In one embodiment the antisense oligonucleotide is complementary to the whole m-RNA of the gene or any smaller part of the protein which shall be inhibited can be selected, e.g. TGF-beta 1 TGF-beta 2, TGF-fteta 3, cell-cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), integrins, selectines, metalloproteases (MMPs), their tiaue inhibitors (TIMPs) and/or interleukin 10. In more preferred embodiments the antisense oligonncSeotides of this invention have length between about 6 and about 300 nucleotides in yet another embodiment the nucleotides have length of about 7 to about 100 nucleotides respectively from about 8 to about 30 nucleotides, even more preferred from 12 to 24 nucleotides.<br>
Sequences of the respective genes are known to someone skilled in the art, additionally some of them are presented in Example 14.<br>
In stilt other embodiments, the nucleic acids are not antisense nucleic acids, meaning that they do not function by binding to complementary genomic DNA or RNA species within a cell and thereby inhibiting the function of said genomic DNA or RNA species.As used herein with respect to linked units of a nucleic acid, "linked" or "linkage" means two entities are bound to one another by any physicochemical means. Any linkage known to those of ordinary skill in the art, covalent or non-covalent, is embraced. Natural linkages, which are those ordinarily found in nature connecting the individual units of a nucleic acid, are most common. The individual units of a nucleic acid may be linked, however, by synthetic or modified linkages.<br>
In one embodiment of this invention at least one phosphate linker of the oligonucleotede is substituted by a peptide. These derivatives of the oligonucleottde is also called a peptide nucleic acid.<br>
In one embodiment the respective ends of this linear polymeric structure can be further joined to form a circular structure. However, open linear structures are generally preferred. Within the oligonucleotides structure, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the internucleoside backbone of the oligonuclectide. The normal linkage or backbone of RNA and DNA is a 3'to 5' phophodfester linkage.<br>
Oligonucleotides or nucleic acids includes oligonucleotides having non-naturally-occurring portions with similar function. Such modified or substituted oligonucleoliides are often preferred over native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for nucleic acid target (e.g. protein), altered intracellular localization and increased stability in the presence of nucleases. Modifications of the oligonucleotides as used herein comprises any chemical modifications of the sugar, the base moiety and/or the internucleoside linkage.<br>
In one embodiment nucleic acids or oligonucleotides with a covalently modified base and/or sugar include for example nucleic acids having backbone sugars which are onvalently attached to low molecular weight organic groups other than a hydroxyl group at the 3' and/or 2' position and other than a phosphate group at the 5' position. Thus modified nucleic acids may include a 2'-O-alkylated ribose group. In yet another embodiment modified nucleic acids include sugars<br><br>
such as arabwiose instead of ribose. Thus the nucleic acids may be heterogeneous in backbone composition thereby containing any possible combination of polymer units linked together such as peptide-nucleic acids (which have acnino acid backbone with nucleic acid bases). In some embodiments the nucleic acids are homogeneous in backbone composition.<br>
The substituted purines and pyrimidines of the nucleic acids include standard purines and pyrimnidines such as cytosine as well as base analogs such as C-S propyne substituted bases (Wagner et al., Nature Biotechnology 14:840-844, 1996). Purines and pyrimidines include but are not limited to adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, 5-methylcytosine, 2-aminopurine, 2-amino-6-chloropurine, 2,6-diaminopuriine, hypoxanthine, and other naturally and non-naturally occurring nucleobases, substituted and unsubstituted aromatic moieties.<br>
The single nudeotides in each oligonucleotide or polynucleotide polymer may contain the same modifications, may contain combinations of these modifications, or may combine these modifications with phosphodiester linkages. Methods of rendering oligonucleotide or polynucleotide polymers nuclease resistant include, but are not limited to, covalently modifying the purine or pyrimidine bases. For example, bases may be methylated, hydroxymethylated, or otherwise substituted (e.g., glycosylated) such that the oligonucleotides or polynucleotides are rendered substantially acid and nuclease resistant.<br>
It is understood to someone skilled in the art, that antisense oligonucleotides in which some nudeotides of the sequence are substituted by another nucleotide or even other spacers, the derivatives of the antisense oligonucleotides of this invention still inhibit the synthesis of proteins such as TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2, TGF-beta 3, cell-cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), integrins, selectines, metalloproteases (MMPs), their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) and/or interleukin 10 etc. In a preferred embodiment about 0,1% to about 50% of the nudeotides are substituted or from about 0,1% to about 10% or from about 0,1% to about 5%.<br>
A spacer as mentioned above can be any chemic substance connecting the at least two parts of the antisense oligonucleotide substituting the space of at least one nudeic acid.<br>
In yet another embodiment at least one T (Thymidine) is substituted by an U (Uracil).<br>
In a preferred embodfenent the spacer is another nucleotide or is a sugar such as glucose, ribose etc., an amino acid or one or several units of a polymer such as polypropylene.<br>
In a preferred embedment, at teast one end-block on the oligonucleotide is a biotin, biotin analog, avidin, or avidin analog. These molecules have the ability to both block the degradation of the protected oligonucleotide or potynucleotide and provide means for high affinity attachment of the modified nucleic acids to the solid support. Avidin and biotin derivatives which can be used to prepare the reagents of this invention include streptavidin, succinylated avidin, monomeric avidin, biocytin (biotin-.epsilon.-N-lysine), biocytin hydrazide, amine or sulfhydryl derivatives of 2-tminobiotin and biotinyl-epsilon-aminocaproic acid hydrazide. Additional biotin derivatives, such as biotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, biotinyl-epsHon-aminocaproic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, sulfosuccinimidyl 6-{tootin amido)hexanoate, N-hydroxysucctnimideiminobiotin, biotinbromoacetylhydrazide, p-diazobenzoyl biocytin and 3-{N-maleimidopropionyl)beocytin, can also be used as end-blocking groups on the polynucleotides of the present invention.<br>
In another embodiment the ring structure of the ribose group of the nucleotides in the modified oligonucleotide or polynucleotide has an oxygen in the ring structure substituted with N-H, N-R (with R being an alkyl or aryl substituent), S and/or rnetbylene.<br>
In a preferred embodiment at least one sugar moiety of the oligonucleotide is a morpholino derivative and the active derivative then is a morpholino oligonucleotide.<br>
In another embodiment two carbones of at least one sugar moiety are linked. The linkage may be with a methoxy group or thereelse. This linker fixes the the sugar moiety in a way that it remains in one specific conformation, which enables e.g. higher selectivity and higher stability of this locked nucleic acids. Locked nucleic acids are described eg. In J. Wengel, Ace. Chem. Res., 120, 5458-5463 (1999) or J. Wengel et al., nucleosides &amp; nucleotides, 18(6&amp;7), S. 1365-1370, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In yet another embodiment the base units are maintained for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic acid target compound. One such oligomeric compound, an oligonucleotide mimetic that has been shown to have excellent hybridization properties, is referred to as a peptide nucleic acid (PNA). In PNA compounds, the sugar-backbone of an oligonucleotide is replaced with an amide containing backbone, in particular an aminoethylglycine backbone. The nucleobases are bound directly or indirectly to aza nitrogen atoms of the amide portion of the backbone. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of PNA compounds include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos.: 5,539,082; 5,714,331; and 5,719,262, each of which is herein incorporated by reference. Further teaching of PNA compounds can be found in Nielsen et al., Science, 1991, 254, 1497-1500.<br>
Further modified oligonucleotide backbones include, for example,<br>
phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates,<br>
phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alky<br>
phosphonates including 3'-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates,<br>
phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3'-aminophosphoamidate and<br>
aminoalkylphosphoramidates,	thionophosphoramidates,<br>
thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, and boranophosphates having norm 3'-5'linkages, 2'-5'linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein the adjacent pairs of nucleoside units are linked 3'-5'to 5'-3'or 2'-5'to 5'-2'. Various salts, mixed salts, and free acid forms are also included.<br>
The nucleic acids having backbone modifications useful according to the<br>
invention in some embodiments are S- or R-chiral antineoplastic nucleic acids. An<br>
"S chiral nucleic acid" as used herein is an nucleic acid wherein at least two<br>
nucleotides have a backbone modification forming a chiral center and wherein a<br>
plurality of the chiral centers have S chirality. An "R chiral nucleic acid" as used<br>
herein is an nucleic acid wherein at least two nucleotides have a backbone<br>
modification forming a chiral center and wherein a plurality of the chiral centers<br>
have R chirality. The backbone modification may be any type of modification that<br>
forms a chiral center. The modifications include but are not limited to<br>
phosphorothioate,	methylphosphonate,	methylphosphorothioate,<br>
phosphorodithioate, p-ethoxy, 2'-0-Me and combinations thereof.<br>
Another type of modified backbone, useful according to the invention, is a peptide nucleic acid. The backbone is composed of aminoethyiglycine and supports bases which provide the nucleic acid character. The backbone does not include any phosphate and thus may optionally have no net charge. The lack of charge allows for stronger BNA-DNA binding because the charge repulsion between the two strands does not exist. Additionally, because the backbone has an extra methylene group, the oligonucleotides are enzyme/protease resistant. Peptide nucleic acids can be purchased from various commercial sources, e.g., Perkin Elmer, or synthesized de novo.<br>
In a further embodiment at teest one nucleotide of an oligonucleotide is modified as described in one of the modifications above.<br>
In yet another embodiment both of these modifications of the oligonucleotide are combined.<br>
In preferred embodiments the 1 to about 12 or 1 to about 8 or 1 to about 4 or 1 to about 2 oligonucleotides aired/or nucleotide linkages at the 3' and/or 5'end of the oligonucleotide are modified as described above.<br>
In yet another embodiment the oligonucleotides of this invention hybridizing with the same target (e.g. TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2, TGF-beta 3, cell-cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), integrins, selectines, metalloproteases (MMPs), their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) and/or interleukin 10 ) comprising one of the oligonucleotides of the sequence listing but additionally have sequences with about 1 to about 20 nucleotides more preferred froml to 15, 1 to 10, 1 to 5, 1 to 3 or 1 to 2 nucleotides on at least one of the 2', 3' and/or 5'end are still within the scope of this invention.<br>
In other words, any sequence of this invention can be choosen. E.g. a sequence is taken from the sequence listing or from the examples. These sequences are part of the antisense complementary to the m-RNA of the target molecule e.g. TGF-betal, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3 or IL-10 as given in example 16. Nucleotides can be added at either end of these sequences following the sequence of the antisense complementary to the m-RNA of the target molecule to create new antisense oligonucleotides hybridising with the m-RNA. At any end of the oligonucleotide nucleotides with a length from about 1 to about 20 nucleotides,<br>
more preferred from about one to about 25, further preferred from about 1 to about 10, from about 1 to about 5, from about 1 to about 3 nucleotides are adifed. As mentioned above it is understood to someone skilled in the art, that if some of the nucleotides are substituted or spacers are included instead of a nudeotide, this oligonucleotide derivative will still hybridize with the m-RNA of the target molecule.<br>
Targets of oligonucleotides mentioned in this invention are known to persons skied in the art. In a preferred embodiment the targets are selected from the group of m-RNA of TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2 and/or TGF-beta 3, cell-cell adhesion motecules (CAMs), integrins, selectines, metalloproteases (MMPs), their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) and/or interieukin 10. The sequence of the m-RNA of TGF-beta-1, and TGF beta-2 is given in example 6. The sequences of antisense complementary to the m-RNA of TGF-betal, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3 and IL-10 and! a splice variation of the antisense complementary to the TGF-beta are given in example 16.<br>
Yet another task of this invention was to find a process of manufacturing the IL-10 antisense oligonucleotides of this invention or its active derivatives.<br>
For the use in the instant invention, the nucleic acids can be synthesized de novo using any of a number of procedures well known in the art. Such compounds are referred to as 'synthetic nudeic acids.' For example, the b-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite method (Beaucage, S. L., and Caruthers, M. H., Tet. Let. 22::1859/ 1981); nucleoside H-phosphonate method (Garegg et al., Tet. Let. 27:4051-4054, 1986; Froehler et al., Nucl. Acid. Res. 14:5399-5407, 1986, Garegg et a!, Tet. Let. 27:4055-4058, 1986, Gaffney et al., Tet. Let. 29:2619-2622, 1988). These chemistries can be performed by a variety of automated oligonucleotide synthesizers available in the market.<br>
In a preferred process the IL-10 antisense oligonucleotides of this invention are synthesized by using phosphite triester chemistry growing the nucleotide chain in 3'-5 'direction wherein the tespective nucleotide is coupled to the first nucleotide that is covalently attached to the solid phase comprising the steps of first cleaving 5'DMT protecting group of the previous nucleotide, then adding the respective nucleotide for chain prolongation, then modifying phosphite groups subsequently cap unrescted 5'-hydroxyl groups and cleaving the<br>
oligonudteotides from the solid support and finally working up the synthesis product<br>
In yet another embodiment nucleic acids are produced on a large scale in plasmkfc, (see, e.g., Sambrook, et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 1989) and separated into smaller pieces or administered as a whole.<br>
In yet another embodiment nucleic acids are prepared from existing nucleic acid sequences (e.g., genomic or cDNA) using techniques known to someone skilled in the art, such as employing restriction enzymes, exonucleases or endonudeases. Nucleic acids prepared in this manner are isolated nucleic acids. The term nucleic acid encompasses both synthetic and isolated antineoplastic nucleic acids.<br>
In anottier embodiment nucleic acids with modified backbone, such as those having phosphorothioates bonds are synthesized using automated techniques employing, for example, phosphoramidate or H-phosphonate chemistries. Aryl-and aftyl-phosphonates can be made, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,469,863. Alkylphosphotriesters, in which the charged oxygen moiety is alkylated as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,243 and European Patent No. 092,574, can be prepared by automated solid phase synthesis using commercially available reagents.<br>
Methods for making other nucleic acid backbone modifications and substitutions have been described (Uhlmann, E. and Peyman, A., Chem. Rev. 90:544, 1990; GoodchWd, J., Bioconjugate Chem. 1:165, 1990).<br>
Descriptions for the synthesis of locked nucleic acids are known to someone skilled in the art, for further details see e.g. Wengel, J., Chem. Res., 120, S. 5458-5463 (1999) or Koch, T., J. Physics Condese Matter 15, S. 1861-1871 (2003).<br>
In one embodiment phosphorothioates are synthesized using automated techniques employing either phosphoramidate or H-phosphonate chemistries. Aryl- and alkyl-phosphonates can be made, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,469,863; and alkylphosphotriesters (in which the charged oxygen moiety is alkylated as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,243 and European Patent No.<br>
092,574) can be prepared by automated solid phase synthesis using commercially available reagents. Methods for making other DNA backbone modifications and substitutions have been described (Uhlmann, E. and Peyman, A., Chem. Rew. 90:544, 1990; Goodchild, L, Bioconjugate Chem. 1:165, 1990).<br>
Other sources of nucleic acids useful according to the invention include standard viral and bacterial vectors, many of which are commercially available. In its broadest sense, a "vector" is any nucleic acid material which is ordinarily used to deliver and facilitate the transfer of nucleic acids to cells. The vector as used herein may be an empty vector or a vector carrying a gene which can be expressed. 1st the case when the vector is carrying a gene the vector generally transports the gene to the target cells with reduced degradation relative to the extent of degradation that would result in the absence of the vector. In this case the vector optionally includes gene expression sequences to enhance expression of the gene m target cells such as immune cells, but it is not required that the gene be expressed in the cell.<br>

In one embodiment the oligonucleotides of this invention are administered neat or in the form tf a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The salts have to be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric, hytlrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, p-toluene sulphonic, tartaric, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, malonic, succinic, naphthalene-2-sufphonic, and benzene sulphonic.

Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. In yet another embodiment coated condoms, gloves and the tike are useful.<br>
In yet another embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions also include penetration enhancers in order to enhance the alimentary delivery. Penetration enhancers may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories, i.e., fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, surfactants and non-surfactants (Lee et at., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, 8, 91-192; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33). One or more penetration enhancers from one or more of these broad categories may be included.<br>
Various fatty acids and their derivatives which act as penetration enhancers include, for example, deic acid, lauric acid, capric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoteic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, recinleate, monoolein (a.k.a. l-rnonooleoyl-rac-glycerol), dilaurin, caprylic acid, arichidonic acid, glyceryl 1-monocaprate, l-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, acylcarnitines, acylcholines, mono- and di-glycerides and physiologically acceptable salts thereof (i.e., oleate, laurate, caprate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, linoleate, etc.) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, 8:2, 91-192; Muranishi, Critical Revfews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7:1, 1-33; El-Hariri et al., 3. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1992, 44, 651-654). Examples of some presently preferred fatty acids are sodium caprate and sodium laurate, used singly or in combination? at concentrations of 0.5 to 5%.<br>
The physiological roles of bile include the facilitation of dispersion and absorption of Hpids and fat-soluble vitamins (Brunton, Chapter 38 In: Goodman &amp; Oilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Ed., Hardman et al., eds., McGraw-Hill, New Yorti, N.Y., 1996, pages 934-935). Various natural bile salts, and their synthetic derivatives, act as penetration enhancers. Thus, the term "bile salt" includes any of the naturally occurring components of bile as well as any of their synthetic derivatives. A presently preferred bile salt is chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.), generally used at concentrations of 0.5 to 2%.<br>
Complex formulations comprising one or more penetration enhancers may be used. For example, bie salts may be used in combination with fatty acids to make complex formulations. Preferred combinations include CDCA combined with sodium caprate or sodium laurate (generally 0.5 to 5%).<br>
In one embodiment additionally chelating agents are used they include, but are not limited to, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), citric acid, salicylates (e.g., sodium salicylate, 5-methoxysalicylate and homovanilate), N-acyl derivatives of collagen, laureth-9 and N-amino acyl derivatives of beta-diketones (enaminesKLee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, 8:2, 92-192; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7:1, 1-33; Buur et al., 3. Control Rel., 1990, 14, 43-51). Chelating agents have the added advantage of also serving as DNase inhibitors.<br>
In yet another embodiment additionally surfactants are used. Surfactants include, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether and polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl cBher (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, 8:2, 92-191); and perfluorochemical emulsions, such as FC-43 (Takahashi et al., 3. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1988, 40, 252-257).<br>
Non-surfactants include, far example, unsaturated cyclic ureas, 1-alkyl- and 1-alkenylazacyclo-alkanone derivatives (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, 8:2, 92-191); and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as diclofenac sodium, indomethacin and phenylbutazone (Yamashita et al., J. Pharm. PharmacdL, 1987, 39, 621-626).<br>
In one embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention additionally contain other adjunct components conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions, at their art-established usage levels. Thus, for example, the compositions may contain additional compatible pharmaceutically-active materials such as, e^g., antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory agents, or mttay contain additional materials useful in physically formulating various dosage forms of the composition of present invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opacifiers, thickening agents and stabilizers. However, such materials, when added, should not unduly interfere with the biological activities of the components of the compositions of the invention.<br>
In the embodiments of ofigonucleotides for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting the formation of metastases in cancer treatment or for the treatment of cancers such as colon colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, leukaemia, lymphoma, melanoma, non small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, pancreas carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, soft tissue cancer at least one antisense ofigonucleotide is applied in effective amounts. In other embodiments the active derivatives are applied in effective amounts. In yet other embodiments oligonucleottdes or their active derivatives for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting the formation of metastases in cancer treatment or for the treatment of cancers such as renal cancer, endometrial cancer, osteosarcoma, mesothelioma, myeloma multiple, esophageal cancer or any other cancer mentioned in this invention are applied in effective amounts.<br>
Antagonist, oligonucleotides and there active derivatives are not only used for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions, but are also used for the treatment of the respective cancers in effective amounts. In general, the term "effective amount" of an antisense oligonucleotides, active derivative or antagonist refers to the amount necessary or sufficient to realize a desired biologic effect. Specifically, the effective amount is that amount that reduces the rate or inhibits altogether the formation of cancers or carcinomas respectively inhibits the formation of metastases. For instance, when the subject bears an unwanted cancer, an effective amount is that amount which decreases or eliminates the unwanted cancer. Additionally, an effective amount may be that amount which prevents an increase or causes a decrease in new unwanted cancer and/or reduces the formation of metastases.<br>
The effective amount varies depending upon whether the pharmaceutical composition is used in single or multiple dosages and whether only one or several antisense oligonucleotides are within one pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Dosages given in this writing are for adults. It is quite clear to someone skilled in the art, that these dosages have to be adapted if the human being is a child, a person stressed by a further illness or other circumstances. In the same way the effective amount must be adapted if an animal is treated which is also within the scope of this invention.<br>
The effective dosage is dependent also on the method and means of delivery, which can be localized or systemic. For example, in some applications, as in the treatment of melanoma or ophthalmic cancer the combination preferably is delivered in a topical or ophthalmic carrier.<br>
In one embodiment subject doses of the oligonucleotides described herein typically range from about 0.1 pg to about 10 mg per administration, which depending on the application could be given hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly and any other amount of time therebetween. In yet another embodiment the doses range from about 10 ug to about 5 mg per administration or from about 100 ug to about 1 mg, with 1-10 administrations being spaced hours, days or weeks apart. In some embodiments, however, doses may be used in a range even 2 to 100 fold higher or lower than the typical doses described above.<br>
In ante embodiment of this invention the at least one oligonucleotide of a pharmaceutical composition accenting to this invention is an antisense oligramjcleotide inhibiting the production of TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 3 TGF-beta 1, cell-cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), integrins, selectines, metalloproteases (MMPs), their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) and/or interteukin 10 is administered in a dose range from about 1 ug/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day or from about 10 ug/tos/day to about 10 mg/kg/day or from about 100 ug/kg/day to about 1 mg/kg/day.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
If not referred to in another way, the sequences used in the assays were used as phosphorothioates. TGF-B1, respectively TGF-B2 in the context of this invention is sysnonymous with TGF-beta1 respectively TGF-beta2. AP12009 and AP11014 are synonyms for antisense oligonudeotides, AP12009 is an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to m-RNA of TGF-beta2 and AP11014 is an antisense oligonucleotide complementary |p m-RNA of TGF-beta1.<br>

Example 2<br>
Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity Assay:<br>
For generation of tumor cell supematants cells were cultured in culture medium supplemented with 1% PCS and 3% Panexin (Pan Biosystems) to reduce the TGF-B amount in the medium. Cells were treated with Lipofectin respectively the test substance with Lipofectin on two consecutive days or left untreated. Culture supematants were taken 3 days after the last Lipofectin treatment. TGF-beta produced by the tumor cells was activated by 1 N HCI (1:20 dilution) for 10 min at RT. For neutralisation NaOH was added. Human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) isolated from healthy donors were incubated with the tumor eel supematants in the presence of IL-2 (10 ng/ml) for the generation of lymphokine activated hiiler cells. To block activated TGF-beta 1 a TGF-beta 1 specific antibody (1 ug/ml, R&amp;D Systems) was added. After 3 days, cytotoxic activity of LAK cells was determined in a 4h CARE-LASS assay against the respective cancer cell line as target.<br>
For TGF-beta2 the same protocol was applied. Instead of the TGF-beta1 specific antibody a TGF-beta 2 specific antibody was added. In experiments for measuring TGF-beta1 or TGF-beta2 beneath the measurement of LAK cells the cytotoxic activity of PBMC was determined in 4h CARE-LASS assay<br>
Example 3<br>
Proliferation Assay with Lipofectin*<br>
About 75.000 cells per millilitre of the respective tumor cell line were cultured in 12 well flat-bottom microtiter plates in MEM-Dulbecco medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco), as recommended by ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). After 24 hours and after 48 hours the cells were treated with indicated concentration of respective TGF-beta 1 specific antisense oligonucleotides for 6 h. For enhancing the cellular uptake additionally Lipofectin* (Invitrogen, USA) with indicated concentrations was added during this 2x6<br>
hours. Some experiments were performed without adding Lipofectin®. Between these two periods of 6 h and during the final 3 days cells were treated with 5 uM of above mentioned TGF-beta 1 specific antisense oligonucleotide in the absence of Lipofectin*. Control cells were cultured in pure medium for the same period. Furthermore reference cells were treated with indicated concentration of Lipofectin*.<br>
Instead of MEM-Dulbecco-medium other culture mediums may be used according to the recommendations of the providers of the cell lines.<br>
Finally cell numbers in all samples were quantified by staining the cells with Trypan blue and counting them in a "Neubauer" hemacytometer.<br>
Alternatively the quantification of living cells was done with the EZ4U-assay according to the manufacturer's protocol, or by electronic cell counting with the Coulter Counter Z2 (Beckmann) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Additionally, TGF-beta 1 concentrations in supematants were measured by TGF-beta 1 Enzym-Linked hnmunosorbent Assay (TGF-beta 1 ELISA, R&amp;D Systems, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Values from serum-supplemented medium without cells were subtracted to account for background from serum-derived TGF-beta 1.<br>
This proiferation assay was also performed for measuring TGF-beta2 levels. In that case instead of TGF-beta1 specific antisense oltgonudeotides, TGF-beta2 specific antisense oligonucteotides were used and instead of measuring TGF-beta1 concentrations, TGF-beta2 concentrations were measured in the supematants by a TGF-beta2 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (TGF-beta 2 ELISA).<br>
Example 4<br>
Proliferation assay without addition of Lipofectin*<br>
About 25.000-200.000 cells per millilitre, dependent on cell diameter and speed of cell proliferation weie cultured in 12 well flat-bottom microtiter plates in MEM-Dulbecco medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PCS, Gibco), as recommended by ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). Additionally, TGF-beta 1 specific antisense oligonucleotideswere added during three days, whereas the control cells remained untreated during the three days<br>
After three days cell numbers in all samples were quantified by staining them by trypan blue method and counting them in a "Neubauer" hemacytometer.<br><br>
Additionally TGF-beta t concentrations were measured in the supernatants on day 3 with TGF-beta1 Enzym-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (TGF-beta 1 ELISA, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer instructions. Values from serum-supplemented medium without cells were subtracted to account for background from serum-derived TGF-beta 1.<br>
In other proliferation assays TGF-beta 2 specific anttsense oligonucleotides were added. In these experiments the TGF-beta 2 levels were measured in the supernatants on day 3. In experiments enduring 6 days, used for melanoma cell lines, the levels of either TGF-beta 1 or TGF-beta2 were measured on day 3 and day 6. TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 levels were measured with TGF-betal or TGF-beta2 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay which were provided by R&amp;D Systems)<br>
In the proliferation assays enduring 6 days the medium was exchanged after the first three days and cells were treated for further three days with the respective antisense oligonucleotides at the indicated concentrations. The cell numbers then were quantified after three and six days. The quantification of the living cells was performed with the EZ4U-assay according to the manufacturer's protocol, or by electronic cell counting with the Coulter Counter Z2 (Beckmarm) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Instead of MEM-Dulbecco medium other culture mediums supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco) were used, as recommended by the providers of the different cell lines.<br>
Example 5 Scratch Assay<br>
Tumor cells (about 900,000/well) were seeded in 6-well plates. The next day cells were treated once with the test substance and Lipofectin respectively with Lipofectin for 6h in Optimem (Invitrogen) CM- left untreated. Then, the confluent monolayer of cells was scratched (start) in a standardized manner with a sterile plastic pipette tip to create a cell-free zone in each well, approximately 1,000um in width. Afterwards the cells were washed once and incubated at 37°C in standard medium. In vitro migration was documented by photography, and the migration distance was quantified by computer-assisted image analysis using NIH Image 1.6. Each experiment was performed in quadruplicate.<br>
Since migration plays a key role in the formation of metastases this "in vitro" experiment correlates with "in vwo" formation of metastases. Inhibition of "in vitro" migration indicates<br>
inhibition of formation of metastases "in vivo".<br>

A spheroid model of migration was established as described elsewhere (Nygaard et al., 1998). Tumor cells were cultured in tissue culture flasks coated with 2% agar. After 3 days multicellular spheroids were transferred into 96-well plates and left untreated, treated with test substance or with recombinant TGF-B2 at 10 ng/ml (R&amp;D Systems). The migration behaviour of the respective cell-line was analyzed by phase contrast microscopy (x10).<br>
Since migration plays a key role in the formation of metastases this "in vitro" experiment correlates with "in vivo" formation of metastases. Inhibition of "in vitro" migration indicates inhibition of formation of metastases "in vivo".<br>
Example 7 TGF-B1/B2-ELISA<br>
The amount of TGF-B1 respectively TGF-B2 secreted by tumor cells was determined by ELISA. Briefly, tumor cells (15,000 - 200,000, depending on cell size and cell growth) were seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates and treated with the oligonucleotides under test in the presence of cationic lipid (Lipofectin reagent, Gibco BRL) for 6h in serum-free Optimem medium (Invitrogen) on two consecutive days (final concentrations: AP 11014: 200 nmol/l; Lipofectin: 3 ug/ml) or left untreated. Then, cells were cultured in the presence of 5 umol/l AP 11014 or left untreated. 72h after the second treatment with Lipofectin and the oligonucleotide under test the cell culture supernatants were collected. The amount of TGF-B1/B2 in the supernatants was measured employing a standard TGF-B1-ELISA-Kit respectively TGF-B2 (Quanfikine, R&amp;D Systems, USA).<br>
The final concentrations of TGF-beta1 or TGF-beta2 antisense oligonucleotides in this assay were 200nMol/l with Lipofectin concentrations of 3ug/ml, respectively 400 nMol/l with 6ug/ml.<br>

Example 17 -Synthesis of oligonucleotides<br>
On method for synthesizing oligondesoxy-nucleotides is performed by stepwise 5 addition of<br>
protected nucleosidtes using phosphite triester chemistry. The first nudeotide is introduced<br>
as	5'-dimeiioxytrityl-deoxyadenosine(N4benzoyl)-N	N'diisopropyl-2-cyanoethyl<br>
phosphoramidite (01 M); C is introduced by a 5'dimethoxytrityl-deoxycytidine (N4benzoyl)-N, N'-diisopropyl-2-q(Bnoethyl phosphoramidite; G is introduced as 5'-dimethoxytrityl-deoxyguanosine(Nftsobutyryl)-N, N'diisopropyl-2-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite and the I was introduced as 5'-dimethoxytritykJeoxythymidine-N, N'-di-isopropyl-2-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite. The nucleosides were preferably applied in 0.1 M concentration dissolved in acetonitril.<br>
Synthesis is performed on controlled pore glass particles of about 150 Fm diameter (pore diameter about 500 A) to which the most 3 nucleoside is covalently attached via a long chain alkylamin linker (average loading about 30 Fmol/g solid support).<br>
The solid support is loaded into a cylindrical synthesis column capped on both ends with filters which permit adequate flow of reagents but hold back the solid synthesis support. Reagents are delivered and withdrawn from the synthesis column using positive pressure of inert gas The nudeotides were added to the growing oligonucleotide chain in 3' -&gt; 5' direction. Each nudeotide was coupled using one round of the following synthesis cycle.<br>
Cleaving 5'DMT (dimethoxytrityl) protecting group of the previous nudeotide with 3-chloroacetic acid in dichloromethane followed by washing the column with anhydrous acetonitrile. Then simultaneously one of the bases in form of their protected derivative depending on the sequence is added plus tetrazole in acetonitrile. After reaction the reaction mixture has been withdrawn and the phosphite is oxidized with a mixture of sulfur (S8) in carbon disulfid/pyridine/triethylamine. After the oxidation reaction the mixture is withdrawn and the column was washed with acetonitrile. The unreacted 5'-hydroxyl groups are capped with simultaneous addition of 1 -methyltmidazole and acetic anhydryide/lutidine/tetrahydro-furan. Thereafter the synthesis column is washed with acetonitrile and the next cycle was started.<br>
The work up procedure and purification of the synthesis products occurs as follows:<br>
After the addition of the test nucleotide the deoxynucleotides were cleaved from the solid support by incubation in ammonia solution. Exoxyclic base protecting groups are removed by further incubation in ammonia. Then the ammonia is evaporated under vacuum. Full-length synthesis products still bearing the 5'DMT protecting group are separated from shorter failure contaminants using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on silica C18 stationary phase. Eluents from the product peak are collected dried under vacuum and the 5'-DMT protecting group cleaved by incubation in acetic acid which is evaporated thereafter under vacuum. The synthesis products are solubilized in the deionized water and extracted three times with diethylether. Then the products are dried in vacuo. Another HPLC-AX chromatography is performed and the eluents from the product peak are dialysed against excess of Tris-buffer and then dialysed against deionized water. The final products are lyophilized and stored dry.<br>
