"EPOTHILONE COMPOUND OF GENERAL FORMULA I AND A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPPOSITION THEREOF"<br>
SCHERING  AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,   of Mullerstrasse   178,   D-13353 Berlin, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
VERIFICATION OF TRANSLATION<br>
I, Melissa Stanford, a translator with Chillson Translating Service, 3530 Chas Drive, Hampstead, Maryland, 21074, hereby declare as follows:<br>
That I am familiar with the German and English languages;<br>
That I am capable of translating from German to English;<br>
That the translation attached hereto is a true and accurate translation of German Application PCT/EP00/01333 titled, "16-Halogen-Epothilone Derivatives, Process for their Production, and their Pharmaceutical Use,-<br>
That all statements made herein of my own knowledge are true and that all statements made on information and belief are believed to be true;<br>
And further that these statements were made with the<br>
knowledge that willful false statements and the like so made are<br>
punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both, under Section 1001<br>
of Title 18 of the United States Code and that such willful false<br>
statements may jeopardize the validity of the application or any<br>
registration resulting therefrom.	<br><br><br>
By<br><br><br>
Executed this<br><br><br>
Witness<br><br>
Hofle et al. describe the cytotoxic action of the natural substances epothilone A (R = hydrogen) and epothilone B (R = methyl)<br><br>
Epothilone A (R = H) , Epothilone B (R = CH3) in, e.g., Angew. Chem. [Applied Chem], 1996, 108, 1671-1673. Because of their in-vitro selectivity for breast cell lines and intestinal cell lines and their significantly higher activity against P-glycoprotein-forming, multiresistant tumor lines in comparison to taxol as well as their physical properties that are superior to those of taxol, e.g., a water solubility that is higher by a factor of 30, this novel structural class is especially advantageous for the development of a pharmaceutical agent for treating malignant tumors.<br>
The natural substances are not sufficiently stable either chemically or metabolically for the development of pharmaceutical<br><br>
agents.  To eliminate these drawbacks, modifications to the natural substance are necessary.  Such modifications are possible only with a total-synthesis approach and require synthesis strategies that make possible a broad modification of the natural substance.  The purpose of the structural changes is also to increase the therapeutic range.  This can be done by improving the selectivity of the action and/or increasing the active strength and/or reducing undesirable toxic side-effects, as they are described in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1998, 95, 9642-9647.<br>
•The total synthesis of epothilone A is described by Schinzer et al. in Chem. Eur. J. 1996, 2, No. 11, 1477-1482 and in Angew. Chem. 1997, 109, No. 5, pp. 543-544).  Epothilone derivatives were already described by Hofle et al. in WO 97/19086.  These derivatives were produced starting from natural epothilone A or B.  Also, epothilone C and D (double bond between carbon atoms 12 and 13:  epothilone C = deoxyepothilone A; epothilone D = deoxyepothilone B) are described as possible starting products for this purpose.   . ;<br>
Another synthesis of epothilone and epothilone derivatives was described by Nicolaou et al. in Angew. Chem. 1997, 109, No. 1/2, pp. 170-172.  The synthesis of epothilone A and B and several epothilone analogs was described in Nature, Vol. 3 87, 1997, pp. 268-272; and the synthesis of epothilone A and its derivatives was described in J. Am. Chem. Soc, Vol. 119, No. 34, 1997, pp. 7960-7973 as well as the synthesis of epothilone A and B and several epothilone analogs in J. Am. Chem. Soc, Vol. 119, No. 34, 1997, pp. 7974-7991 also by Nicolaou et al.<br><br>
Nicolaou et al. also describe in Angew. Chem. 1997, 109, No. 19, pp. 2181-2187 the production of epothilone A analogs using combinatory solid-phase synthesis.  Several epothilone B analogs are also described there.<br>
Epothilone derivatives, in some cases also epothilone C and D, are further described in Patent Applications WO 99/07692, WO 99/02514, WO 99/01124, WO 99/67252, WO 98/25929, WO 97/19086, WO 98/38192, WO 99/22461 and WO 99/58534.<br>
In the epothilone derivatives that became known previously, no halogen atom can stand at carbon atom 16 of the epothilone skeleton.<br>
The content of the priority documents DE 199 08 765.2 and DE 199 54 230.9 in this patent applicant as well as in WO 99/07692 of the applicant is incorporated by reference in these documents as part of the disclosure in this patent application.<br>

Representation of Partial Fragments A and B:<br>
The partial fragments (synthesis components) of general formulas A and B can be produced as described in DE 19751200.3 or the corresponding WO 99/07692.<br>
Representation of Partial Fragments C:<br>
The representation of the partial fragments of formula C according to the invention, in which R8" means a fluorine atom, can be performed as is indicated in the following formula schemes within the production of the compounds of Examples 1 to 4 according to the invention.<br>
By variation of the (hetero)aryl radical in the starting product in reaction step a) (in this case, this is the 2-methyl-4-thiazolyl radical),, the correspondingly substituted components of formula C and ultimately compounds of formula I result.<br>
The production of fragments of formula C, in which R8" means a chlorine atom, is described within Example 5.<br>

Biological Actions and Applications of the New Derivatives:<br>
The new compounds of formula I are valuable pharmaceutical agents.  They interact with tubulin by stabilizing microtubuli that are formed and are thus able to influence the cell-splitting in a phase-specific manner.  This relates mainly to quick-growing, neoplastic cells, whose growth is largely unaffected by intercellular regulating mechanisms.  Active ingredients of this type are in principle suitable for treating malignant tumors.  As applications, there can be mentioned, for example, the therapy of ovarian, stomach, colon, adeno-, breast, lung, head and neck carcinomas, malignant melanoma, acute lymphocytic and myelocytic leukemia.  The compounds according to the invention are suitable owing to their properties basically for anti-angiogenesis therapy as well as for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as, for example, psoriasis or arthritis.  To avoid uncontrolled proliferation of cells and for better compatibility of medical implants, they can basically be applied or introduced into the polymer materials that are used for this purpose.  The compounds according to the invention can be used alone or to achieve additive or synergistic actions in combination with other principles and classes of substances that can be used in tumor therapy.<br>

o   DNA topoisomerase inhibitors, such as, e.g.,<br>
camptothecin, etoposide, topotecan, teniposide,<br>
o   folate- or pyrimidine-antimetabolites, such as, e.g, lometrexol, gemcitubin,<br>

o   inhibitors of growth factors (e.g., of PDGF, EGF, TGFb, EGF), such as, e.g., somatostatin, suramin, bombesin antagonists, --<br>
o   inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases or protein<br>
kinases A or C, such as, e.g., erbstatin, genistein, staurosporine, ilmofosine, 8-Cl-cAMP,<br>
0   antihormones from the class of antigestagens, such as, e.g., mifepristone, onapristone or from the class of antiestrogens, such as, e.g., tamoxifen or from the class of antiandrogens, such as, e.g., cyproterone acetate,<br><br>
o   metastases-inhibiting compounds, e.g., from the class<br>
of eicosanoids, such as, e.g., PG12, PGE,,, 6-oxo-PGE1 as well as their more stable derivatives (e.g., iloprost, cicaprost, misoprostol),<br>
