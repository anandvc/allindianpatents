				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of MFP (Multi Functional Peripheral) and other peripheral devices. Further, this invention relates to additional facilitating features in scan and print related peripherals. More particularly, this invention explains a method to preview and select scanned document for supported settings.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
US Patent Number 6,567,190 titled "Multi-functional scanner and method of assembling same" describes a mechanism to display scanned documents.<br>
The said prior art invention provides a combination scanning, editing and display apparatus contained in a single housing. The scanner is configured as a flatbed scanner with a display screen mounted in a cover belonging to the scanner. The display screen is touch sensitive for editing images and electronically inputting text. The scanner has electronic input connections such as CD disk, CDR disk, DVD disk, floppy, electronic memory cards, and smart cards to display images directly from these devices or store images directly in memory. The scanner is capable of interrogating an output device (e.g., printer) that may be connected to the scanner for determining type of output device and format of output.<br>
The said patent does not provide for the manner in which the maximum benefits that can be achieved (by pre-viewing) coupled with the functionalities (for example applying special copy features on the scanned data and viewing the various features before printing) provided by the MFP after getting the display of the scanned details.<br>
A scanner is a device used to capture the image of a document. The scanner captures the image of the document by using rows of light receptors that can detect variations in light intensity and frequency.<br><br>
A conventional scanner works in the following manner:<br>
1)	The Scan Object command initiates the scan and the scanner scans the document.<br>
2)	The image of scanned document is displayed in the Display unit.<br>
3)	The user can edit the document and then store, print or transmit the same.<br>
As mentioned above, the present technology does not provide for the following:<br>
1)	During Capability Exchange in fax transmission the sending user cannot ascertain the exact manner in which the fax would be received on the receiving machine.<br>
2)	During faxing multiple documents the user cannot change the order of the faxed documents.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is therefore to provide a method to preview and select scanned documents for applying supported settings in peripheral devices. This invention relates to the field of MFP and other peripheral devices in which, any standard display unit attached to the peripheral device displays the scanned document so that the user can compare the available settings for scanning. By means of the same the user can pre-view the image enhancement by the interpolation supported.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method to preview and select scanned document for supported settings wherein the said method comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	getting the scanned image of the source document and storing the said scanned image as a default image in the memory;<br>
(b)	getting    the    user   input   for   previewing   the   said    document   and<br><br>
displaying/previewing the said scanned image in plurality of display units;<br>
(c)	making the settings in the scanned image displayed in the display unit by the user where the set image is displayed in the display unit according to the user settings; and<br>
(d)	selecting to preview for more settings by the user by displaying the image in the plurality of said display units,<br>
wherein, the inputs from the user to select the image on the display unit or the default image is obtained when user does not select to preview for more settings.<br>
In this method normal operations of printing and transmitting as supported by the peripheral device is done if preview is not selected. Here the final image having the settings as selected by user will be considered for processing as supported by the peripheral device. The scanned document when received at the receiver end is previewed before forward of the document to specific processing as supported by the peripheral device. The user selectively chooses pages from a received document to specific processing as supported by MFP. The said method is adapted to perform re arrangement of the pages in preview by the user before performing a specific processing as supported by MFP. The said method is also adapted to perform merging and arranging plurality of received faxes in preview.<br>
Also the method provides for deletion of pages before performing a specific processing as supported by MFP if required. The fax data is sent without degrading to the capabilities of receiving MFP where the receiving MFP can preview the original document sent. In this method, user can also select a single display unit. The said method is adapted to perform a fax transmission of the user-selected area in preview. According to the stored capability of the receiving device, image enhancements or image degradation are done. The image enhancement is done at the transmission side when stored capability of the receiving machine is high. The image degradation is done at the transmission side when stored capability of the receiving machine is low. If the stored capability of the receiver is high or low the MFP intimate the user through user interface about this. The invention performs an enhancement or degradation of the stored<br><br>
scanned data to the capability of the receiving machine and display the data in the display unit. Also the invention helps in finding the dust particles in the scanner bed being scanned by previewing.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1a shows the flow diagram of the present invention. Figure 1b shows the flow diagram of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1a shows the work flow diagram of the present invention. The scanned image of the source document is obtained first. This image is stored in the memory of the peripheral device as the default image. The inputs from the user is obtained for the preview. Here if user does not select to preview then he can<br><br>
proceed with normal operations (print / transmit) as supported by the peripheral device. If user selects to preview then, scanned image is obtained in Display unit 1 and Display unit 2.<br>
Figure 1b is the continuation flow diagram of the present invention. The user is allowed to make settings of the scanned image in Display unit 1 and Display unit 2. The Image gets displayed in Display unit 1 and Display unit 2 according to user made settings. Then the inputs are got from user to preview more settings and if user selects to preview for more settings, then this gets displayed in display units. If user does not select to preview for more settings, then get input from the user to select the image as shown in Display unit 1 or Display unit 2 or as Default image stored in memory. The image having the settings as selected by user will be considered for further processing as supported by MFP.<br>
As per the method proposed herein, any standard display unit attached to a MFP displays the user scanned document so that the user can compare the available settings for scanning. By means of the same, the user can pre-view the image enhancement by the interpolation supported. Further by means of the above, the user is allowed to get a look and feel of the scanned document with settings before he could actually transmit or print it.<br>
The following paragraph explains the steps for Preview and select:<br>
The scanned image of source document is obtained first. This image is stored in the memory of the MFP as the default image. The inputs from the user is obtained for the preview. If user does not select to preview then he can proceed with normal operations (print / transmit) as supported by MFP. If user selects to preview then, scanned image is obtained in Display unit 1 and Display unit 2. The user is allowed to make settings of the scanned image in Display unit 1 and Display unit 2. The Image gets displayed in Display unit 1 and Display unit 2 according to user made settings. Then the inputs are got from user to preview more settings and if user selects to preview for more settings, then this gets<br><br>
displayed in display units. If user does not select to preview for more settings, then get input from the user to select the image on Display unit 1 or Display unit 2 or Default. The image having the settings as selected by user will be considered for further processing as supported by MFP.<br>
The user can choose to store received document (fax-ed document) and preview it before printing. The user can choose to forward the document to specific printer which supports the features of the received document, e.g. Color Fax. If the receiving MFP does not support color fax the user may choose to forward it to specific printer. In the method herein proposed, the user can choose to selectively print pages from a received document and also able to rearrange the pages in preview before printing or forwarding. Also the user can merge and arrange two or more received faxes in preview so that he can forward them as a single fax without printing. The user can also choose to delete pages before forwarding. The fax data can be sent without degrading to the capabilities of receiving MFP. By means of this, the user at the receiving MFP can preview the original document sent and select the settings available with the MFP before forwarding or printing. The user is given the chance of choosing a single display unit.<br>
The following are the advantages of this method:<br>
1)	The user gets to have a look and feel of the scanned document.<br>
2)	The user need not know the technical settings to be done for scanning. He can select the same from preview.<br>
3)	The user can compare the look and feel of scanned document for various supported settings so that he could decide and select for a particular setting.<br>
4)	The user is facilitated that he does not have to scan and preview for each available setting.<br><br>
5)	One time scan and preview for various settings.<br>
6)	The user can also select to rescan a particular document if it is not scanned properly.<br>
7)	The user can also choose to re-arrange the order of pages if the user has misplaced some documents.<br>
8)	Sometimes flat bed may have some dust particles which also get scanned. By previewing he can make sure whether the scan-bed is clear and proceed.<br>
9)	Real time pre-viewing, if the document gets corrupted during transmission the user can select to re-transmit the page.<br>
10)While copying the user might not know the exact meaning of a special copy, so he can pre-view and select what he wants. The user does not have to know the meaning of special copy features available.<br>
11)Cost effective as the user previews the scanned image for different available settings without printing for various settings.<br>
12)The user can preview the document on sending MFP based on the capability of the receiving MFP. The receiving MFP capability information is obtained by capability exchange.<br>
The invention explains a method in which previewing the image (printing a copy) on the sending MFP based on the capabilities of the receiving MFP is possible. The previewed image or printed copy would be similar to that of the receiving machine. The user sending the document may not know how exactly it would be printed on the received MFP as the printout on the receiving MFP is governed by<br><br>
the Capability exchange that takes place before the transmission. With this invention the sender can get to know the quality of the printout by the capability exchange and Print a copy on the sending machine (preview the image) before actually sending the document. The method reduces transmitted (faxed) scanned data by transmitting user selected area in pre-view, this reducing the cost of transaction. The method introduces rearranging / inserting / deleting the in memory scanned documents using the Preview mechanism in MFP. The method of scanning once and previewing for the various available setting provided by the MFP is also possible. The method helps in finding out the dust particles in the scanner bed being scanned, by previewing.<br>
Illustration 1: Receiving Machine's Capability is having Higher features<br>
The function EE (Exchange and Improve) stores the scanned data which is scanned at the set resolution. First the number to which the data is to be faxed is captured through user interface and stored in memory. The function EE initiates the fax functionality to the captured number and gets the details of the receiving machine's capability through capability exchange. Then the function EE terminates the initiated call. The function EE compares the capability with the Scanned capability. If the stored capability is higher then the function will automatically intimate the user through user interface say LCD display. The function EE calls standard Image Enhancements Modules which will enhance the stored scanned data to the capability of the receiving machine. The function EE then displays the data to the user through the LCD display. Then the function EE waits for user input as whether to send the enhanced data or the original scanned data. Then the function EE initiates the fax functionality and sends the in memory data which is selected according to the user input at the above step.<br>
Illustration 2: Receiving Machine's Capability is having Lesser features<br>
The function EE (Exchange and Improve) stores the scanned data which is scanned at the set resolution. The number to which the data is to be faxed is<br><br>
captured through user interface and stored in memory. The function EE initiates the fax functionality to the captured number and gets the details of the receiving machine's capability through capability exchange. Then the function EE terminates the initiated call. Then the function EE compares the capability with the Scanned capability. If the stored capability is lesser then the function will automatically intimate the user through user interface say LCD display. The function EE calls standard Image Degradation Modules which will degrade the stored scanned data to the capability of the receiving machine. The function EE then displays the data to the user through the LCD display. Then the function EE waits for user input as whether to send the degraded data. Then the function EE initiates the fax functionality and sends the in memory data otherwise simply discards the scanned data as per the user input in above step.<br>
Illustration 3: Changing the order of pages<br>
The function EE scans page by page and stores it in memory. The function also maintains a page pointer for the stored page. The function EE prompts the user to verify the order of pages through the user interface say an LCD display. The function EE captures the user inputs for swapping pages., i.e. the page numbers to be swapped are entered by the user as comma separated values. The function EE updates the page pointers accordingly. After the user input indicating end of changes is capture then the function EE passes the data as an input for user initiated function supported by MFP.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, mobile communication device, mobile server or a multi function device.<br><br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br>
