				<td>PROCEDURE FOR SOLDERING THE CONSTITUENT LAYERS OF<br>
A MULTILAYER PRINTED CIRCUIT AND MACHINE THEREFOR<br>
Technical Sector of the Invention<br>
The object of the invention is a procedure for soldering the constituent layers of<br>
multilayer printed circuits made up of various layers that have the circuit image<br>
superimposed on them and are separated from each other by isolating layers, as well<br>
as a machine therefor.<br>
Background<br>
Multilayer printed circuits composed of multiple layers fitted out with respective circuit<br>
images and separated from each other by isolating layers are well known. Broadly<br>
speaking, once the layers with the circuit image have been obtained, the<br>
manufacturing of a multilayer printed circuit requires alternating and superimposing<br>
these layers with isolating with a high degree of precision so as to enable the electrical<br>
interconnection between circuits of various layers and proceed immediately to the<br>
union of all the layers by hot pressing. Various methods for bonding the layers of<br>
multilayer printed circuits before pressing are known. One method essentially consists<br>
in providing perimetral strips on each layer with circuit image containing multiple<br>
reserve areas without the circuit image, such that the reserve areas, which occupy the<br>
same relative position in each layer containing a circuit image, are superimposed and,<br>
therefore, groups of superimposed reserve areas are defined; the layers are then<br>
immediately joined through a clinching operation performed on said reserve area<br>
groups. A second method essentially differs from the previous one in that the layers<br>
are bonded by simultaneously soldering of the layers of the multilayer printed circuit<br>
performed on said reserve area groups.<br>
With the clinching method for joining layers, a high number of layers in the<br>
multilayer printed circuit leads to a loss in the mechanical precision necessary to<br>
proceed to the interconnection of the different layers containing circuit images, while<br>
with the method of joining layers by welding, a high number of layers leads to very long<br>
welding times and/or the impossibility to welder. The main drawback of both the<br><br>
clinching and welding methods for joining the layers of multilayer printed circuits is that<br>
the number of layers that may be joined is reduced, thereby limiting the production of<br>
circuits composed of high numbers of layers containing the circuit image, for example,<br>
of circuits with more than eight layers with the circuit image superimposed on them.<br>
Explanation of the Invention<br>
The procedure for soldering the constituent layers of a multilayer printed circuit,<br>
is applicable to multilayer printed circuits made up of a mix of layers containing the<br>
circuit image and isolating layers, where the layers that have the circuit image also<br>
have perimetral strips on which a variety of reserve areas are located, in equal number<br>
and position for each layer.<br>
The procedure designed in the invention is made up of the following steps:<br>
i) place a heater circuit composed of a flat winding with at least one turn in short-<br>
circuit, in each reserve area of each layer containing a circuit image;<br>
ii) arrange the layers containing circuit images so that they are superimposed and<br>
separated from each other by an isolating layer, , in order to form the book of layers of<br>
the multilayer printed circuit such that there are distinct top and bottom layers that<br>
each contain the circuit image;<br>
iii) secure the position of the layers of the multilayer printed circuit, relative to each<br>
other, in such a way that the corresponding reserve areas of the layers with circuit<br>
image occupy the same relative position, forming groups of superimposed reserve<br>
areas and, consequently, groups of superimposed heater circuits;<br>
iv) in each group of reserve areas with the heater circuits, place one induction<br>
electrode over the reserve area of the top layer containing the circuit image and a<br>
second induction electrode over the opposite side of the reserve area of the bottom<br>
layer containing the circuit image; and<br>
v) solder each group of reserve areas through the two induction electrodes, by<br>
application of a magnetic field of variable induction, which generates through induction<br>
into each turn in short-circuit of each heater circuit of each reserve area of each layer<br>
with a circuit image of a current intensity whose circulation through the turns in short-<br>
circuit produces heat for the soldering the layers of the multilayer circuit.<br><br>
The machine to perform the procedure that is the object of the invention is<br>
composed of the elements listed below:<br>
a structure which includes a minimum of one inductor device with a magnetic<br>
circuit of a general U form that contains an inductor coil, each outer point of each arm<br>
of the magnetic circuit having its own induction electrode, both of which are positioned<br>
coaxially to each other, and both with capacity of displacement in both directions;<br>
a circuit board holder;<br>
a device for attaching the book of layers of the multilayer printed circuit to the<br>
circuit board holder;<br>
a movement control device for the circuit board holder, adapted to situate the<br>
groups of reserve areas between the pair of induction electrodes of the inductor device<br>
and perpendicularly to them; and<br>
a control device for each pair of induction electrodes, adapted to situate the<br>
electrodes in contact with the group of reserve areas, such that they exercise pressure<br>
on them.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
The pages of drawings in this report include illustrations, to serve as non-limiting<br>
examples, of the procedure for soldering the constituent layers of a multilayer printed<br>
circuit and the machine for performing it, which together are the object of the invention.<br>
In said drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 is a view in perspective of the constituent layers that contain the circuit<br>
image and the isolating layers of a multilayer printed circuit, superimposed and prior to<br>
being secured for the soldering procedure;<br>
Fig. 2 is a view in perspective of the multilayer printed circuit prepared to be soldered;<br>
and<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic view in perspective of the machine for the invented procedure.<br>
Detailed Description of Drawings<br>
In Figures 1 and 2, the respective views in perspective show the layers that<br>
make up the book of a multilayer printed circuit 1 composed of four layers containing<br><br>
the circuit image indicated with references 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively and three<br>
isolating layers indicated with references 6, 7, and 8, respectively, all layers having a<br>
rectangular form of equal dimensions. In this example of performing the procedure<br>
according to the invented process, there is a total of seven constituent -layers in the<br>
internal book of the multilayer printed circuit, four containing the circuit image and<br>
three isolating ones, this number of layers being understood to serve solely as an<br>
example and in no way to limit the number of layers that could make up a multilayer<br>
printed circuit.<br>
The figures in the pages of drawings show that the layers containing the<br>
circuit image 2 through 5 and the isolating layers 6 to 8 are superimposed in<br>
alternating order, such that the facing circuit images of the layers that contain circuit<br>
images are always separated by an isolating layer, and furthermore that they are all<br>
adapted so that the top and bottom layers of the resulting book of layers are layers<br>
containing the circuit image, a top circuit-image layer 2 and a bottom circuit-image<br>
layer 5.<br>
Fig. 2 shows that the top circuit-image layer 2, on which, for reasons of<br>
simplicity, the illustration of any circuit has been omitted, is composed of a<br>
peripheral strip 9 that does not have the circuit image and includes three regularly<br>
distributed reserve areas 11 on each of its longitudinal margins 10. As previously<br>
indicated, the remaining layers containing circuit image 3, 4 and 5 are equipped with<br>
reserve areas of equal number and position to those described for the layer<br>
containing the circuit image 2, as seen in Fig. 1.<br>
In the first phase of the procedure, according to the invention, there is a<br>
heater circuit 13, enlarged in detail A of Fig. 2, in each one of the reserve areas 11<br>
of each layer containing a circuit image 2, 3, 4 y 5. The heater circuit 13 in this<br>
example of performing the process is composed of two turns in short-circuit 14,<br>
which bear symmetrical relation to the main theoretical longitudinal axis of the<br>
heater circuit 13; this particular layout of the turns in short-circuit 14 is given solely<br>
as a non-limiting example, since in reality the number of the turns in short-circuit that<br>
make up the heater circuit and their relative position can be configured in a variety of<br>
ways adapted to the specific needs of each case of application, particularly taking<br><br>
the following into consideration: material and thickness of the circuit layers; number<br>
of layers; soldering times, etc.<br>
In the second phase of the invented procedure, the layers containing the<br>
circuit image 2, 3, 4 and 5 and the isolating layers 6, 7 and 8 are superimposed in<br>
alternating order, thereby producing, as previously indicated, a top layer containing<br>
the circuit image 2 and a bottom layer containing one as well 5, as seen in Fig. 2.<br>
The third phase of the invented procedure, not shown here, proceeds to the<br>
securing of the positions of layers 2 through 8 of the multilayer printed circuit 1,<br>
thereby superimposing the groups 12 of reserve areas and, consequently, the<br>
heater circuits 13 that each contains.<br>
The fourth and fifth phases of the invented procedure proceed to the<br>
soldering of the groups of reserve areas through the application of a magnetic field<br>
of variable induction to the heater circuits 13, using the machine described below.<br>
Fig. 3 shows, schematically, the machine to be employed for the invented<br>
process. For reasons of simplicity, the illustration of the circuit board holder has<br>
been omitted, since it is well known, as have been those of the attachment device<br>
for the book of layers of the multilayer printed circuit, and the movement control<br>
device for the circuit board holder.<br>
In this example of the machine to be used in the invented procedure, Fig. 3<br>
shows a single inductor device 15, it being understood that the number of<br>
constituent induction devices 15 in the machine and their arrangement with regard<br>
to the circuit board holder would depend on the production needs of each specific<br>
case of application; for instance, there could be two induction devices 15 facing<br>
each other, one on each side of multilayer printed circuit 1, operationally coordinated<br>
through the circuit board holder"s movement control device.<br>
Inductor device 15 is composed of a magnetic circuit 16 of a general U form,<br>
fitted out with an inductor coil 17 and two electrodes placed at the outer points of the<br>
arms of the magnetic circuit 16. The top electrode 18 and the bottom electrode 19<br><br>
are arranged coaxially to each other and are perpendicular to the multilayer printed<br>
circuit 1. The inductor coil 17 is fed by a feeding source of alternating current, while<br>
the electrodes 18 and 19 have a displacement capacity in both directions.<br>
The operation of the machine for the invented procedure is described below.<br>
Through the control device of the circuit board holder, the multilayer printed circuit 1<br>
is positioned relative to the inductor device 15 in such a way that the electrodes 18<br>
and 19 are situated perpendicularly to the group of reserve areas 12. In these<br>
conditions, an electrodes movement control device, not shown, proceeds to situate<br>
the top electrode 18 over the reserve area 11 of the layer containing the circuit<br>
image 2 and the bottom electrode 19 over the bottom layer containing the circuit<br>
image 5, facing the reserve area, such that the electrodes exercise a certain degree<br>
of pressure. Later, the inductor coil 17 is fed by alternating current, so that the<br>
electrodes 18 and 19 apply a magnetic field of variable induction that generates,<br>
through induction into the turns in short-circuit 14 of each heater circuit 13 of each<br>
reserve area 11 of each layer containing the circuit image 2, 3, 4 and 5, a current<br>
intensity whose circulation through the turns in short-circuit 14 produces the<br>
soldering heat of the layers of the multilayer printed circuit 1.<br><br>
