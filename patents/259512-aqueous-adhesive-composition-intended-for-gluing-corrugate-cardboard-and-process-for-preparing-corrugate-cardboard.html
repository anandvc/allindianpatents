				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates an aqueous adhesive composition<br>
intended for gluing corrugate cardboard and process for preparing<br>
corrugate cardboard.<br>
More particularly, it relates to an aqueous adhesive<br>
composition having a primary part essentially constituted of<br>
gelatinized and/or swollen starch(es), and a secondary part<br>
essentially constituted of non-gelatinized and/or swollen<br>
starch (es).<br>
More specifically, it relates to an aqueous adhesive<br>
composition intended for assembly of corrugated cardboard, whose<br>
secondary part is made from a mixture comprising at least one<br>
legume starch and at least one cereal and/or tuber,; starch.<br>
In that case, .the primary part may also be made from one<br>
single starch, in particular pea starch, but it may also be<br>
made from a mixture comprising at least one legume starch and<br>
at least one cereal and/or tuber starch, particularly from the<br>
same mixture used in the secondary part'.<br>
It also relates to a process for preparing corrugated<br>
cardboard using a composition according to the invention<br>
comprising a mixture, as defined in its secondary part and,<br>
optionally, in its primary part.<br>
It also relates to the corrugated cardboard produced by the<br>
means according to the invention.<br>
The invention relates to a mixture of at least onelegume<br>
starch and at least one cereal and/or tuber starch, and its use to<br>
produce the secondary part and, optionally,<br><br>
to produce the primary part of a composition according to<br>
the invention.<br>
The term "legume," as used in this invention, is more<br>
particularly understood to mean the Papilionaceae family,<br>
predominantly represented by beans, peas, lentils, broad<br>
beans, alfalfa, clover, and lupin.<br>
The term "legume starch," as used in this invention,<br>
is understood to mean starches extracted from legume plants<br>
and, in particular, peas, which have a high starch content,<br>
greater than 90% (dry/dry) , and a very low colloidal and<br>
fibrous residue content, of advantageously less than 1%<br>
(dry/dry).<br>
The starch content is preferably greater than 95%<br>
and, even more preferably, greater than 98% (dry/dry).<br>
At the same time, the protein content is of less than<br>
1%, preferably less than 0.5%, and even more preferably,<br>
between 0.1 and 0.35%(dry/dry).<br>
The term "aqueous adhesive composition," as used in<br>
this invention, is understood to mean any aqueous adhesive<br>
composition intended for producing corrugated cardboard,<br>
comprising a part of solubilized and/or swollen starch(es),<br>
which is called the base or primary part, presenting<br>
sufficient suspending properties, in particular with<br>
respect to granular starch, and a part of non-solubilized<br>
and/or only hydrated starch(es), i.e., in the state of<br>
insoluble granules and/or granules that are at least<br>
partially swollen, also called the secondary part.<br>
Such compositions that make use, in the secondary<br>
- part, of a starch in the state of insoluble granules are<br>
often produced according to principles known to a person<br>
skilled in the art as the "Stein-Hall process."<br>
Per the rules inherent to this process and other<br>
similar processes, such as the so-called "Minocar" process<br><br>
(European patent EP 0 038 627) , in a first step, at least<br>
one starch, water, and an alkaline agent are combined.<br>
This mixture is heated, moderately in an open tank,<br>
or strongly with steam or using a continuous steamer, to<br>
achieve simple thickening or to obtain an alkaline<br>
colloidal solution having suitable characteristics, in<br>
particular rheologic characteristics, and a suitable<br>
ability to maintain in suspension particles that are<br>
insoluble and/or only hydrated.<br>
This procedure constitutes a method for preparing the<br>
so-called "primary" or "base" part.<br>
According to other rules for these processes, a<br>
dispersion combining at least water and one or more<br>
starches in a granular state is prepared at the water<br>
supply temperature. Most often, a boron derivative,<br>
commonly borax, is added to them. The resulting slurry<br>
forms the "secondary" part.<br>
The primary and secondary parts are carefully mixed<br>
using various continuous or discontinuous methods.<br>
According to a variant, it is possible to<br>
successively add water, granular starch(es), and, most<br>
often, borax to the primary part.<br>
According to still another variant, it is possible to<br>
produce a ready-to-use product in the form of a dry<br>
commercial composition, i.e., one that contains no water<br>
other than the water contained in its components, for which<br>
a simple dispersion in water is sufficient to obtain a<br>
composition according to the invention.<br>
Said pre-formulated composition comprises a<br>
pregelatinized starchy material derived from a legume<br>
starch, a tuber starch, a cereal starch, or a mixture<br>
thereof.<br>
It also comprises a starchy material in the form of<br>
insoluble and/or swollen granules, capable of forming the<br><br>
secondary part, and which is produced from a mixture<br>
comprising at least one legume starch and at least one<br>
cereal and/or tub.^r starch.<br>
It also comprises a mineral part which may generate<br>
the desired alkalinity in water. This may be for example a<br>
mixture of sodium carbonate and calcium hydroxide.<br>
Finally, most of the time, it comprises a boron-<br>
containing agent, such as borax.<br>
It is also understood that the pre-formulated<br>
composition may, for example, contain only the<br>
pregelatinized part and the granular and/or pre-swollen<br>
part. In that case, an alkaline agent and borax are added<br>
to the water or to the dispersion of the composition in<br>
water.<br>
These processes result in aqueous adhesive<br>
compositions whose final solids content - an essential<br>
parameter - commonly varies between 20 and more than 30%.<br>
An other process having a primary part comprising at<br>
least one solubilized starch, and a secondary part<br>
constituted of at least one starch in the form of granules,<br>
is known under the name "Pristim®" (European patent EP 0<br>
229 741, in the name of the Applicant).<br>
Within the framework of this process, the primary<br>
part is prepared by markedly increasing the temperature,<br>
without adding any alkaline agent.<br>
However, in some cases, a very small amount of said<br>
alkaline agent is still added, in order to reduce and<br>
adjust the temperature required for gelatinization.<br>
Regardless of the methods chosen to obtain the<br>
primary and secondary parts, technological advances in<br>
materials have often allowed persons skilled in the art to<br>
move towards aqueous adhesive compositions with high solids<br>
contents, most often produced from cereal and/or tuber<br>
.starches.<br><br>
Such an approach affords the advantage of decreasing<br>
the amount of water to be evaporated and to achieve a more<br>
favorable heat balance, but still seems insufficient.<br>
Another solution consists of using modified or<br>
unmodified potato starch. However, at the solids content<br>
.levels in question, solubilized or only swollen potato<br>
starch, whether modified or unmodified, does not have<br>
sufficient ability to maintain the starch granules of the<br>
secondary part in suspension, regardless of their nature,<br>
particularly when these consist of potato starch.<br>
Based on this alone, it is imperative to provide, in<br>
the primary or base part, for the presence of a starchy<br>
material other than those derived from potato starch, such<br>
as for example a pea starch. The direct consequence of this<br>
aspect is the need, for such compositions, to supply at<br>
least two different starchy materials, which may constitute<br>
a major drawback to their use in current receiving and<br>
continuous preparation facilities.<br>
Another possibility is afforded by compositions<br>
produced from legume starch. This is because, among the<br>
various sources of starchy materials, those constituted of<br>
legume starches, in particular pea starch, may be<br>
considered easily accessible under good conditions, in<br>
particular, good economic conditions.<br>
The corresponding proposal, described in<br>
international patent application WO 2004/044082, filed in<br>
the name of the Applicant, as interesting as it may be,<br>
still does not provide entirely satisfactory answers to all<br>
of the high requirements presented by modern materials,<br>
particularly from the perspective of the energy required<br>
for gluing.<br>
The addition of a legume starch and pea starch in<br>
particular is therein considered fundamental and essential<br>
for implementing compositions that may satisfy all<br><br>
requirements of modern materials, particularly in terms of<br>
ease of supply and use, as well as in terms of rheology and<br>
performance.<br>
However, the invention, as described, possesses<br>
insufficiencies of varying degrees of severity, which in<br>
certain cases may even be unacceptable.<br>
For example, while the stated advantages are<br>
undeniable, from a rheologic perspective in particular,<br>
when prepared using the "Stein-Hall" process, compositions<br>
produced with legume starch alone or with mixtures with a<br>
very high content in that starch cannot be suitable when<br>
prepared using the "Minocar" process.<br>
In fact, the preparation method according to that<br>
process results in compositions with unacceptable,<br>
particularly short textures, which are totally impossible<br>
to use in a machine. The problem of unsuitable texture may<br>
be solved by markedly decreasing the concentration of the<br>
boron derivative, usually borax, which is very harmful to<br>
.. gluing properties.<br>
Likewise, compositions produced using legume starch<br>
alone or mixtures with a very high content in that starch<br>
do not have all of the required guarantees, particularly in<br>
terms of stability, viscosity, and maintenance of texture<br>
when prepared according to the "Pristim" process.<br>
However, it should be pointed out that a person<br>
skilled in the art tends to have even more demanding<br>
specifications and requirements, which said application<br>
does not satisfy.<br>
In fact, above all, a person skilled in the art<br>
•endeavors to find technically satisfactory solutions,<br>
regardless of the profile of his machine. His requirements<br>
are expressed in terms of machine speed, but also, above<br>
and beyond this, in terms of lower energy costs, from the<br>
point of view of both supplying it with cellulose material<br><br>
and of possibly preheating it for gluing micro-flutes and<br>
nano-flutes (e.g., G, N, 0, or others), or heavy-duty<br>
cardboard.<br>
From those standpoints, an increase in the solids of<br>
the composition or a decrease in the gelatinization point,<br>
if compatible with proper machine operation, related to<br>
absence of undesirable thickening of the glue, are only<br>
partial and insufficient solutions, especially when said<br>
composition essentially comprises pea starch in the primary<br>
and/or secondary part.<br>
Its amylose content, in particular, may generate<br>
energy expenditures, for the supply of liners or their<br>
gluing, that a person skilled in the art finds<br>
unacceptable.<br>
Furthermore, it has been reported in recent years,<br>
from a purely technical point of view, that the<br>
temperatures used for the machine's heating plates, which<br>
allow the gelatinization of the starch in the secondary<br>
part of the adhesive composition, are of paramount<br>
importance.<br>
If too high, they cause problems with respect to<br>
gluing, which is exaggeratedly limited at the surface of<br>
the liner, and the cardboard then becomes brittle.<br>
These findings led to considering a reduction in the<br>
heating capacity of such heating plates, which also<br>
satisfies the person skilled in the art's concern for<br>
reducing energy expenditures.<br>
These considerations take on even greater importance<br>
since the heating profiles of certain machines art somewhat<br>
low, or even extremely low, and require new approaches to<br>
formulating the compositions that are used.<br>
In fact, steam may be used, in some cases under low<br>
pressure, limited to no more than 2 bar, for example, or<br>
even very low pressure, with so-called cold plates.<br><br>
Under such conditions, a person skilled in the art is<br>
even more demanding with respect to these heat aspects. At<br>
the same time, he naturally wishes to maintain the machine<br>
at optimal speed, thus meeting productivity and<br>
profitability criteria.<br>
From that point of view, the teachings of<br>
international patient WO 2004/044082 do not answer all of<br>
these questions. They answer them even less when the<br>
composition used in the machine is at a lower temperature.<br>
In particular, the relatively high amylose content of<br>
pea starch is, in many cases, likely to constitute a<br>
handicap in many cases, inasmuch as it may result in<br>
exaggerated and even unacceptable energy requirements.<br>
This aspect is likely to be all the more marked if<br>
the cardboard is heavy and comprises a large number of<br>
gluing areas remotely located from the machine plates due<br>
to the geometry of the cardboard produced.<br>
All of the aforesaid constraints lead to an<br>
understanding that new improvements are necessary and that<br>
there is a real need to continue to pursue and to further<br>
control the conditions of using legume starches.<br>
Thus there is merit in the fact that the Applicant<br>
has observed, after numerous studies on the bases for using<br>
legume starches, and pea starch in particular, that there<br>
were particular solutions presenting great advantages for<br>
producing glue joints in the best-performing and most<br>
elaborate materials, particularly in a context of<br>
economical production of heavy-duty cardboard and gluing of<br>
micro-flutes.<br>
In fact, the Applicant has found that binary mixtures<br>
of legume starch, particularly pea starches, and tuber<br>
starch, including potato or tapioca starch, are entirely<br>
advantageous, particularly strictly from the perspective of<br>
energy requirements and/or the temperature required at the<br><br>
beginning of gelatinization of said mixture, but also, of<br>
course, in the context of meeting all other criteria<br>
required by a person skilled in the art for simplicity with<br>
respect to the number of materials used, cost, supply, and<br>
performance.<br>
Likewise, certain other binary mixtures of legume<br>
starches, in particular pea starch, and cereal starches,<br>
including corn or wheat starch, also have an undeniable<br>
advantage in terms of energy expenditure, fully compatible<br>
with all of the other requirements.<br>
The result of these findings is that mixtures,<br>
qualified as "ternary," comprising both legume starch(es),<br>
a tuber starch(es), and cereal starch(es), have similar<br>
advantages.<br>
These aspects are surprising and unexpected inasmuch<br>
as, taken separately, legume, tuber, and cereal starches do<br>
not have such advantages.<br>
In other words, the present invention relates to an<br>
aqueous adhesive composition intended for gluing corrugated<br>
cardboard, comprising so-called primary and secondary<br>
parts, characterized in that the secondary part,<br>
constituted of non-gelatinized starches and/or swollen<br>
starches, essentially comprises a mixture of legume<br>
starch(es) and cereal and/or tuber starch(es), such that<br>
the ratio of legume starch to cereal and/or tuber starch is<br>
between 30:70 and 90:10, preferably between 40:60 and<br>
80:20, and still preferably between 45:55 and 75:25.<br>
According to one particular variant, the present<br>
invention relates to an aqueous adhesive composition<br>
additionally characterized in that the primary part,<br>
constituted of gelatinized and/or swollen starches, also<br>
essentially comprises a mixture of legume starch(es) and<br>
cereal and/or tuber starch(es), such that the ratio of<br>
legume starch to cereal and/or tuber starch is between<br><br>
30:70 and 90:10, preferably between 40:60 and 80:20, and<br>
still preferably between 45:55 and 75:25.<br>
The present invention also relates in particular to<br>
any process for producing a composition with a primary<br>
part, as explained above, of the "Stein-Hall," "Minocar,"<br>
or "Pristim" type, or any product in the form of a dry<br>
commercial composition.<br>
The Applicant also stresses the fact that the very<br>
concept of mixtures makes it possible to use any<br>
appropriate means, including continuous or discontinuous<br>
powder mixers, dry-phase thermal reactors ("Vomm" mixers)<br>
or slurry phase thermal reactors (e.g., so-called<br>
"annealing" technique), or thermomechanical reactors (e.g.,<br>
"single-screw" or "double-screw" extruders).<br>
The mixing possibilities, which also constitute so<br>
many minimal cost transformation possibilities , since they<br>
are performed in a single step, may be used both for the<br>
starchy material of the primary part and for the secondary<br>
part.<br>
They may lead to the use of starches having a<br>
majority of swollen granules, sensitive to alkaline action,<br>
in the primary part as well as in the secondary part.<br>
Thus, the invention does not preclude the borderline<br>
case where the starch in the primary part and the starch in<br>
the secondary part are in similar physical states, in<br>
" particular in similar states of swelling and steric size,<br>
especially in an alkaline medium.<br>
Compositions formulated according to the indicated<br>
ratios, based on the diversity of machines and of design<br>
and operation of the machines, will make it possible to<br>
preserve the advantages provided by the pea starch, without<br>
the drawback of the high amylose content.<br><br>
The use of identical mixtures in the primary part and<br>
secondary part also have a fundamental advantage in that a<br>
single raw material need be supplied.<br>
It should also be pointed out that, in view of the<br>
advantages of potato starch in terms of energy, and as<br>
described above, relative to solubilized or swollen potato<br>
starch's lack of capacity for suspending, especially starch<br>
granules, it may be helpful, when designing the primary<br>
part, to consider a mixture of potato starch and pea<br>
starch, whose proportions would be based on the sole<br>
criterion of capacity for suspending, leading to the<br>
possible incorporation of a smaller quantity of legume<br>
starch, i.e., pea starch, than recommended in the above<br>
mixtures.<br>
Other considerations confirm the advantage of the<br>
presence of potato starch in the secondary part. For the<br>
supply of liners and in cases where they are preheated,<br>
this provides low water retention, improving the<br>
wettability of the liners, and a low gelatinization point,<br>
allowing good gluing with less preheating.<br>
Thus, ratios of potato starch to pea starch between<br>
45:55 and 70:30 may be advantageous from these points of<br>
view, whether in the primary and/or secondary part.<br>
Even above and beyond this, such choices of higher<br>
proportions of potato starch in the primary part are<br>
justified by better stability of the preparations.<br>
In any event, more specifically, said aqueous<br>
adhesive compositions are characterized in that the legume<br>
starch, and pea starch in particular, have:<br>
a starch content greater than 90% (dry/dry), preferably<br>
greater than 95%, and, even more preferably, greater<br>
than 98%<br>
a colloidal and fibrous residue content of less than 1%<br>
(dry/dry)<br><br>
a protein content of less than 1%, preferably less than<br>
0.5%, and even more preferably, between 0.1 and<br>
0.35% (dry/dry)<br>
The invention more specifically relates to a<br>
composition characterized in that the legume starch, and<br>
pea starch in particular, has an amylose content of between<br>
15 and 60%, preferably between 2 0 and 55%, and, even more<br>
preferably, between 3 0 and 52%.<br>
The composition according to the invention is<br>
advantageously characterized in that it comprises between<br>
10 and 4 0%, by weight, of the mixture relative to the<br>
totality of said composition.<br>
The advantage of these characteristics increases with<br>
the difficulty of the production.<br>
In fact, in general, the manufacture of so-called<br>
"single face" (SF) or "double face" (DF) cardboard is much<br>
less difficult than "double double" (DD) or "triple-<br>
fluted," even quadruple-fluted corrugated cardboard, or<br>
cardboard with more fluting, micro-fluting, nano-fluting,<br>
and/or heavy-duty cardboard.<br>
It is also to the credit of the Applicant to propose a<br>
process for preparing corrugated cardboard suitable for such<br>
compositions, characterized in that it comprises, at least<br>
once, the steps consisting of distributing the adhesive<br>
composition according to the invention on the tips of the<br>
flutes of a preformed strip of paper, applying a liner or<br>
flat cardboard to the tips of such coated flutes, and then<br>
drying them.<br>
Thus, using compositions according to the invention and<br>
appropriate means, it is possible and easy to manufacture<br>
corrugated cardboard that satisfies the technical<br>
requirements, including for preparation of heavy-duty<br>
cardboard, with multiple flutes and/or micro-flutes.<br><br>
Mixtures according to the invention constitute, as<br>
desired, a simple means, particularly by using the<br>
possibility of using an identical material for the primary<br>
and secondary parts, since it is inexpensive, easily<br>
supplied, particularly compared to tuber starches, not<br>
highly regulated, and is performant in suitable<br>
formulations when said mixtures are prepared according to<br>
the recommended ratios.<br>
Thus, a starch mixture according to the invention,<br>
essentially for the secondary part and possibly for the<br>
primary part of the adhesive composition, has a very<br>
positive effect on all of the criteria specified above,<br>
i.e., improving all operating parameters as well as all<br>
characteristics useful for corrugated cardboard and, in<br>
particular, improving "tack," so-called "green" gluing,<br>
glue setup speed, and gluing quality, while greatly<br>
reducing the energy expenditures necessary to achieve the<br>
desired results.<br>
From the latter standpoint, it is important to point<br>
out that compositions according to the invention are suited<br>
to and compatible with the advent of lower heating profiles<br>
- in certain machines, including those that use steam under<br>
reduced pressure, for example of no more than 2 bar, or<br>
even so-called cold plates.<br>
Somewhat differently, it was found that, with more<br>
conventional machines, it was possible and even desirable<br>
to markedly reduce the number and/or the temperature of<br>
heating plates.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that the advantages<br>
hold true and are even more advantageous when the<br>
composition is brought to a relatively low temperature.<br>
Furthermore, the Applicant considers that, in<br>
"preparing adhesive compositions according to the invention,<br>
it may be entirely sufficient to use mixtures of legume,<br><br>
tuber, and/or cereal starches that are not chemically or<br>
otherwise modified.<br>
However, it is clear that simultaneously or<br>
separately modified starches, including etherified or<br>
esterified starches, are even better suited and fall within<br>
the scope of the invention.<br>
Use of these materials, which normally have a higher<br>
cost, may still be justified due to the rheplogic<br>
properties and the stability of the glues, for "green"<br>
gluing, glue setup and gluing quality, as well as strength<br>
compared to the characteristics obtained with unmodified<br>
starches.<br>
In particular, it is possible to use mixtures of<br>
starches that are modified or unmodified, partially<br>
oxidized or hydrolyzed by at least one acid or enzyme, to<br>
prepare compositions with high solids contents, in order to<br>
adjust their viscosity.<br>
Another advantageous solution for preparing the<br>
primary part consists of preparing the base using a so-<br>
called "direct steam" cooking device, in particular in a<br>
• continuous way.<br>
Other modifications are possible, especially physical<br>
modifications, for example, thermomechanical operations<br>
such as pre-gelatinization on drying drums or extrusion, or<br>
thermal operations such as those known to persons skilled<br>
in the art as hot moisture treatment (HMT) or annealing.<br>
Polymers, generally with high viscosities, known for<br>
such uses, such as cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl<br>
alcohols, polyvinyl acetates, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, may<br>
also be added, in particular to the primary part.<br>
Furthermore, when industrial constraints require that<br>
"the glue joints obtained using compositions according to<br>
the invention be moisture- or water-resistant, cross-<br>
linking agents or preformed resins may be used.<br><br>
In particular, compositions according to the<br>
invention more easily meet moisture- or water-resistance<br>
requirements without harming the environment, health, or<br>
safety conditions, when they contain a formaldehyde or non-<br>
formaldehyde resin and/or a judiciously chosen non-<br>
synthetic, non-formaldehyde water-resistance agent.<br>
In particular, it has been found that, all . other<br>
conditions being equal, the selected proportion of legume<br>
starch, and pea starch in particular, makes it possible to<br>
preserve the advantages provided by the legume starch from<br>
a moisture- or water-resistance perspective, when the<br>
amylose content of that starch is between 15 and 60%,<br>
preferably between 20 and 55%, and, even more preferably,<br>
between 30 and 52%.<br>
It was also found that it is possible, under suitable<br>
conditions, to reduce the quantities of formaldehyde or<br>
non-formaldehyde resin and/or of non-synthetic, non-<br>
formaldehyde water-resistance agent.<br>
More specifically, it was found that, with minimal impact on price, there were easily implementable means,<br>
consisting of using additional small quantities of water-<br>
resistance improving agents such as those selected, for<br>
example, from salts such as sulfates, for example zinc,<br>
copper, or alumina sulfate, diammonium phosphate, or a<br>
compound containing zirconium.<br>
In particular, in an adhesive composition according<br>
to the invention, it is possible to combine resins that are<br>
commonly added to obtain suitable water resistance, such as<br>
various non-formaldehyde or formaldehyde resins, especially<br>
of the urea-formaldehyde type, ketone-formaldehyde type,<br>
resorcin-formaldehyde type, or phenol-formaldehyde type,<br>
generally with a bridging ability and/or an intrinsic<br>
hydrophobic character, and sulfates such as zinc or<br>
alumina.<br><br>
According to one variant, an adhesive composition<br>
according to the invention that is satisfactory from this<br>
point of view is characterized in that it is free of<br>
formaldehyde resin or even synthetic resin and in that it<br>
comprises an effective amount of a chemical agent selected<br>
from sulfates such as zinc, alumina or copper sulfates, or<br>
compounds containing zirconium or diammonium phosphate.<br>
The term "effective amount" is understood to mean a<br>
amount of resin or chemical agent at least equal to the<br>
amount enabling said adhesive composition to impart to the<br>
final corrugated cardboard water resistance characteristics<br>
that meet FEFCO test No. 9 criteria.<br>
The various aspects of this invention relative to the<br>
formulation and preparation of usual adhesive compositions<br>
will be described in greater detail using the following<br>
non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Two "Stein-Hall" adhesive compositions are prepared,<br>
one using only pea starch PS that is native, i.e., not<br>
modified, according to the teachings of document WO<br>
2004/044082, and the other one differing from the first in<br>
that it comprises, in the secondary part, a mixture of<br>
native pea starch (PS) and native potato starch (POS) in a<br>
ratio of 80: 20.<br>
The pea starch has a starch content greater than 95%,<br>
a protein content of 0.3 0%, and a colloidal substance<br>
content of less than 1%.<br>
The amylose content of said starch is 35.7%.<br>
The two resultant compositions, useful for gluing so-<br>
called "Triple Flute" corrugated cardboard, are compared to<br>
a conventional formula using native corn starch CS in the<br>
primary part and native potato starch POS in the secondary<br>
part.<br><br><br>
We also note that, in compositions prepared and<br>
maintained at low temperatures, 32 °C in this case, the<br><br>
teachings of the prior art presented in international<br>
patent application WO 2004/044082 do not show an advantage,<br>
in the laboratory, of using pea starch in general, nor even<br>
of using a mixture of 80% pea starch / 20% potato starch in<br>
the secondary part.<br>
Conversely, the possible machine-specific findings,<br>
especially in terms of machine speed and gluing quality,<br>
clearly indicate the advantage of pea starch and of<br>
mixtures of pea starch / potato starch, in the ratios<br>
recommended in the invention, for producing so-called<br>
"double double," "triple fluted," and "quadruple fluted"<br>
cardboard.<br>
Above and beyond this, the limits of compositions of<br>
the prior art, whether prepared from corn starch and potato<br>
starch or pea starch alone, are all the more evident when<br>
there are reductions or variations in energy input, such as<br>
for example those elicited, by a decrease in the steam<br>
pressure powering the machine.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Now, in order to understand this phenomenon, we will<br>
proceed with a direct comparison on a machine, for the<br>
manufacture of so-called "triple fluted" cardboard, using<br>
two "Stein-Hall" compositions, both with native pea starch<br>
in the primary part and comprising respectively, in their<br>
secondary part, either native pea starch or a mixture<br>
according to the invention, comprising 70% native pea<br>
starch and 30% native potato starch.<br>
We will proceed with a second, similar comparison,<br>
with a formula for gluing "double face" cardboard.<br><br><br><br>
In the case of use of "B" compositions comprising a<br>
mixture of pea starch and potato starch in a ratio of 70:30<br>
in the secondary part, we find on the machine a very marked<br>
increase in machine speed compared to the "A" composition.<br>
It is increased by approximately 50%, at identical heating<br>
plate settings.<br>
This gain in production represents a markedly lower<br>
need for thermal energy to achieve quality gluing of<br>
markedly lesser equality when B formulas according to the<br>
invention are used compared to A formulas.<br>
Thus, the energy balance appears very favorable to<br>
the mixture of pea starch and potato starch.<br>
We further note that A and B formulations have<br>
similar rheologic characteristics and that it is<br>
consequently possible to maintain the same glue deposit and<br>
film thickness.<br><br>
Example 3 :<br>
We prepare two Stein-Hall adhesive compositions for<br>
gluing double double (DD) cardboard, both comprising native<br>
corn starch alone in the primary part.<br>
The C formula comprises a mixture of native corn<br>
starch and native potato starch in the secondary part.<br>
Comparatively, the D formula comprises a mixture of<br>
native corn starch and native pea starch in the secondary<br>
part.<br><br>
On the machine, at identical speeds and comparable<br>
gluing quality, we see that the use of formula D,<br>
comprising a mixture of native corn starch and native pea<br><br>
starch makes it possible to decrease the glue deposit and<br>
produce drier cardboard.<br>
Here again, the energy balance is very favorable to<br>
the mixture according to the invention, comprising pea<br>
starch and, this time, corn starch.<br>
Example 4:<br>
We prepare two compositions, composition E according<br>
to the invention and composition F according to the prior<br>
art, comprising respectively, in the secondary part a<br>
mixture of native corn starch / native pea starch and a<br>
mixture of native corn starch / native potato starch.<br>
Formula E also has a primary part composed of a<br>
mixture of native corn starch / native pea starch, with the<br>
latter constituting the majority, while formula F contains<br>
only native corn starch in the primary part.<br>
Such compositions are useful for so-called single<br>
face (SF) gluing.<br><br><br><br>
Here too, the energy balance is favorable. We are<br>
expressing it differently, pointing out that, at the same<br>
production speed, the gluing quality is markedly better<br>
with composition E according to the invention, compared to<br>
formula F.<br>
Example 5:<br>
The two compositions E and F from example 4, are now<br>
' used for gluing type G micro-fluting. To achieve<br>
satisfactory gluing with formulation F requires the use of<br>
all of the machine's heating tables, i.e., 20 tables<br>
supplied with steam at 14 bar. In comparison, formulation E<br>
makes it possible to very markedly modify the heating<br>
profile. In fact, it was possible to reduce to 5 bar the<br>
steam pressure for the first four and last six tables.<br>
Example 6;<br>
An industrial test was attempted in order to<br>
establish the comparative performances of pea starch alone,<br>
used in the primary and secondary parts versus a mixture of<br>
50% pea starch and 50% potato starch, also used in both the<br>
primary part and the secondary part.<br>
We chose to implement these two types of compositions<br>
using a test that is considered particularly probative,<br>
i.e., on two different, heavy types of so-called "double<br>
double" cardboard.<br>
Using preparations with 33% solids content and a<br>
gelatinization point close to 48°C7 we easily establish the<br>
superiority of the composition containing the mixture.<br>
In fact, the increase in speed reaches 40 meters per<br>
minute. This benefit is attributed to the increased<br>
efficacy, of preheating the liners, if applicable, as well<br><br>
as to the faster gelatinization of the secondary part, when<br>
the mixture contains potato starch.<br>
The three first examples illustrate the advantage, in<br>
a "Stein-Hall" preparation, of mixtures of pea starch, when<br>
used in the secondary part of the composition, regardless<br>
of whether they otherwise are of the "legume starch - tuber<br>
starch" type or "legume starch - cereal starch" type.<br>
The next three examples involve compositions wherein<br>
the mixtures are present in both the primary part and the<br>
secondary part.<br>
The compositions containing mixtures according to the<br>
invention have improved rheologic behaviors, gluing<br>
performances, and/or financial advantages compared to the<br>
prior art. The conclusion remains valid when we compare<br>
them to compositions containing pea starch alone in the<br>
primary and/or secondary part.<br>
Example 7:<br>
We prepare a "Minocar" adhesive composition using<br>
native pea starch PS alone, according to the teachings of<br>
document WO 2004/044082.<br>
The pea starch is the one from example 1, with a<br>
starch content of greater than 95%, a protein content of<br>
0.3 0%, and a colloidal substance content of less than 1%.<br>
The amylose content is 35.7%.<br>
According to the principle of this method, in the<br>
laboratory, contrary to the "Stein-Hall" process wherein<br>
the primary starch is carefully gelatinized, we proceed<br>
with an only partial and controlled swelling, in water, of<br>
a relatively large quantity of starch, which will<br>
constitute the primary part or base.<br>
The elements for preparation of the primary part of<br>
* the composition are as follows:<br><br><br>
The product is stirred at 1750 rpm. The reaction is<br>
stopped after 9 minutes by adding water intended for the<br>
secondary part.<br>
5 <br>
The preparation, now complete, is stirred for 15<br>
minutes at 1750 rpm.<br>
We then take conventional viscosity measurements,<br>
i.e., Lory cup and Brookfield viscosities. The results are 19.5 seconds and 2425 mPa.s,<br>
respectively, representing a composition with a very short<br>
texture. From this finding alone, we can deduce that it is<br>
entirely unsuited for the application.<br>
This noncompliance may be expressed by a B/L<br>
(Brookfield/Lory cup viscosity) ratio of 124, which is very<br>
remote from the standards used by the Applicant, which are<br>
approximately in the 40-50 range.<br>
Example 8:<br>
We then compare compositions that contain, in the<br>
primary part and the secondary part, respectively:<br>
-	pea starch alone (formula Ml)<br>
-	a mixture of 75% pea starch - 25% potato starch<br>
(formula M2)<br>
-	a mixture of 50% pea starch - 50% potato starch<br>
(formula M3)<br><br>
These three formulations result in compositions with<br>
the following characteristics:<br><br>
To stop the reaction, we add the secondary part water<br>
while stirring vigorously (1750 rpm) .<br><br>
We continue stirring for 15 minutes. The viscosities<br>
and B/L ratio are as follows:<br><br>
While this confirms that the texture of the "Minocar"<br>
composition, with pea starch alone, is unsuitable, 25%<br>
potato starch is sufficient to reestablish a suitable B/L<br>
ratio.<br><br>
With P2 and the addition of potato starch to the<br>
mixture, the gelatinization temperature is even lower, by<br>
2°C or more.<br>
On an industrial scale, these preparation conditions<br>
allow storage at a sufficiently low temperature (about<br>
35°C) that it is not necessary to provide a mechanism for<br>
maintaining the temperature, such as for example insulating<br>
the tank.<br>
The viscosity characteristics, by flow (Lory cup) and<br>
shearing (Brookfield), and the B/L ratio are:<br><br>
These data show that the behavior of the freshly<br>
prepared compositions will be satisfactory.<br>
However, above and beyond this, compositions P1 and<br>
P2 underwent an aging test while stored for 24 hours at<br>
room temperature, and were then subjected to shear at 2000<br>
rpm, in order to simulate machine conditions and observe<br>
their reactivity when reused after shutdown and/or a<br>
storage period.<br><br><br>
Above and beyond this - and this is particularly true<br>
for the 50:50 mixture - compositions according to the<br>
invention enable better liner wetting, particularly when<br>
the supply to the machine is preheated. The glue setup<br>
speed is then improved.<br>
Still more particularly, like the Stein-Hall<br>
compositions, such formulations markedly reduce energy<br>
expenditure, while allowing increased machine speed.<br>
Example 9:<br>
We prepare two "Pristim" compositions, P1 and P2,<br>
wherein the primary part is produced by thermal action,<br>
with no alkaline agent.<br>
P1 is obtained from only the native pea starch from<br>
example 1, and P2 contains, in the primary and secondary<br>
parts, a mixture of 50% pea starch and 50% potato starch.<br><br>
At this stage of the sole preparation, we note that<br>
the temperatures required for gelatinization are already,<br>
with P1, relatively low, compared to those that must be<br>
achieved with the other starchy materials, particularly<br>
with cereal, corn, or wheat starches.<br><br><br>
These aging and reuse tests on the preparations show<br>
that the composition according to the invention is better<br>
suited than the composition containing pea starch alone.<br><br>
