  LAUNDRY CIMPOSITIONS COMPRISING <br>
 ALKOXYLATED POLYALKYLENEIMINE DISPERSANS    <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to laundry detergent compositions which comprise alkoxylated polyalkyleneimine hydrophobic soil dispersants which are compatible with bleach. The alkoxylated polyalkyleneimines are also suitable for use as soil dispersant in bleach-containing laundry pre-soaks and bleaching agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Absent a suitable dispersant, hydrophobic (e.g., grime, oil, soot) and hydrophilic (e.g. clay) soil which is removed during the washing step of the laundry process can re-deposit onto the cleaned fabric. Soil dispersents act by sequestering dirt once it is dissolved or dispersed in the laundry liquor and keeps the suspended soil in the laundry liquor where it can be carried away during the normal rinsing process.<br>
Typically, if bleaching agents are present, especially peroxygen bleaches which are formulated into both liquid and granular laundry detergent compositions, the formulator must consider the instability of a particular soil dispersant toward bleach. Many successful dispersents have polyalkyleneamine or polyalkyleneimine backbones which are susceptible to oxidation at the amine functionalities and potentially to breakdown or fragmentation by bleaching agents which may be present. From another view, the interaction of bleaching agents with these polyalkyleneimine-based dispersents depletes the amount of bleach present therefore affecting the bleaching performance.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for bleach compatible, highly effective hydrophobic soil dispersents. Surprisingly, it has been found that certain higher molecular weight polyalkyleneimines which comprise a mixture of alkyleneoxy units which are appended to a polyalkyleneimine backbone in a particular order provide hydrophobic dispersants having enhanced bleach compatibility as well as enhanced dispersancy.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention meets the aforementioned needs in that it has been surprisingly discovered that polyalkyleneimines having a backbone molecular weight of from about 600 daltons to about 25,000 daltons wherein the backbone nitrogens have been substituted by an average degree of mixed alkyleneoxylation per N-H unit of from about 12 to about 50 alkyleneoxy units provides an enhanced hydrophobic soil dispersant which is compatible with<br>
bleach. The polyamine backbone is first modified by placement of from 1 to 10 propyleneoxy units, butyleneoxy units, and mixtures thereof, followed by ethyleneoxy units such that the total degree of alkyleneoxylation does not exceed about 50 units. The alkoxylated polyalkyleneimines of the present invention are suitable for use in high and low density granular, heavy duty and light duty liquids, as well as laundry bar detergent compositions.<br>

A further aspect of the present invention relates to laundry detergent compositions which comprise a bleaching system and the herein described dispersants. A further aspect of the present invention relates to laundry pre-soaks which comprise the soil dispersants of the present invention. These and other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a reading of the following detailed description and the appended claims.<br>
All percentages, ratios and proportions herein are by weight, unless otherwise specified. All temperatures are in degrees Celsius (° C) unless otherwise specified. All documents cited are in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to laundry detergent compositions which comprise one or more polyalkyleneimine dispersants which are polyalkyleneoxy substituted wherein propyleneoxy units, butyleneoxy units, and mixtures thereof are attached to the backbone nitrogens prior to subsequent attachment of polyethyleneoxy units.<br>
The polyamine backbones of the present invention have the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
said backbones prior to subsequent modification, comprise primary, secondary and tertiary amine nitrogens connected by R "linking" units. The backbones are comprised of essentially three types of units, which may be randomly distributed along the chain.<br>
The units which make up the polyalkyleneimine backbones are primary amine units having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
which terminate the main backbone and any branching chains, secondary amine units having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and which, after modification, have their hydrogen atom substituted by from 1 to 10 propyleneoxy units, butyleneoxy units, and mixtures thereof, followed by from 10 to 40 ethyleneoxy units, and tertiary amine units having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
which are the branching points of the main and secondary backbone chains, B representing a continuation of the chain structure by branching. The tertiary units have no replaceable hydrogen atom and are therefore not modified by substitution with an alkyleneoxy unit. During the formation of the polyamine backbones cyclization may occur, therefore, an amount of cyclic polyamine can be present in the parent polyalkyleneimine backbone mixture. Each primary and secondary amine unit of the cyclic alkyleneimines undergoes modification by the addition of alkyleneoxy units in the same manner as linear and branched polyalkyleneimines.<br>
R is C2-C6 linear alkylene, C3-C6 branched alkylene, and mixtures thereof, preferred branched alkylene is 1,2-propylene; preferred R is ethylene. The preferred polyalkyleneimines of the present invention have backbones which comprise the same R unit, for example, all units are ethylene. Most preferred backbone comprises R groups which are all ethylene units.<br>
The polyalkyleneimines of the present invention are modified by substitution of each N-H unit hydrogen with an alkyleneoxy unit having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is 1,2-propylene, 1,2-butylene, and mixtures thereof, preferably 1,2-propylene. R^ is ethylene. R3 is hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl, and mixtures thereof, preferably hydrogen or methyl, more preferably hydrogen. For the purposes of the present invention, at least one propyleneoxy unit or butyleneoxy unit must be attached to the backbone nitrogen units prior to substitution with any other alkyleneoxy unit. The value of the index m is from about 1, preferably from about 2 to about 10, preferably to about 6, more preferably to about 5. The value of the index n is from about 10, preferably from about 15, more preferably from about 20 to about 40, preferably to about 35, more preferably to about 30. The value of m + n is preferably at least 12, more preferably from about 15, most preferably from about 20 to about 40, more preferably to about 35. An example of a preferred polyalkyleneoxy substituent comprises three 1,2-propyleneoxy units prior to subsequent ethoxylation, especially when the average value of m + n is about 30.<br>
The preferred molecular weight for the polyamine backbones is from about 600 daltons, preferably from about 1200 daitons, more preferably from about 1800 daltons, most preferably from about 2,000 daltons to about 25,000 daltons, preferably to about 20,000 daltons, more preferably to about 15,000 daltons, most preferably 5,000 daltons. An example of a preferred<br>
molecular weight for a polyethyleneimine backbone is 3,000 daltons. The indices x and y needed to achieve the preferred molecular weights will vary depending upon the R moiety which comprises the backbone. For example, when R is ethylene a backbone unit averages about 43 gm and when R is hexylene a backbone unit averages about 99 gm.<br>
The polyamines of the present invention can be prepared, for example, by polymerizing ethyleneimine in the presence of a catalyst such as carbon dioxide, sodium bisulfite, sulfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, etc. Specific methods for preparing these polyamine backbones are disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,182,306, Ulrich et al., issued December 5, 1939; U.S. Patent 3,033,746, Mayle et al., issued May 8,. 1962; U.S. Patent 2,208,095, Esselmann et al., issued July 16, 1940; U.S. Patent 2,806,839, Crowther, issued September 17, 1957; and U.S. Patent 2,553,696, Wilson, issued May 21, 1951; all herein incorporated by reference.<br>

Preferred QSBA structures are further described in U.S. 5,686,015 Willey et al., issued November 11, 1997; U.S. 5,654,421 Taylor et al., issued August 5, 1997; U.S. 5,460,747 Gosselink et al., issued October 24, 1995; U.S. 5,584,888 Miracle et al., issued December 17, 1996; and U.S. 5,578,136 Taylor et al., issued November 26, 1996; all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Highly preferred bleach activators useful herein are amide-substituted as described in U.S. 5,698,504, U.S. 5,695,679, and U.S. 5,686,014 each of which are cited herein above. Preferred examples of such bleach activators include: (6-octanamidocaproyl) oxybenzenesulfonate, (6-nonanamidocaproyl)oxybenzenesulfonate, (6-decanamidocaproyl)oxybenzenesulfonate and mixtures thereof.<br>
Other useful activators, disclosed in U.S. 5,698,504, U.S. 5,695,679, U.S. 5,686,014 each of which is cited herein above and U.S. 4,966,723 Hodge et al., issued October 30, 1990, include benzoxazin-type activators, such as a C6H4 ring to which is fused in the 1,2-positions a moiety --C(O)OC(R1)=N-.<br>
Depending on the activator and precise application, good bleaching results can be obtained from bleaching systems having with in-use pH of from about 6 to about 13, preferably from about 9.0 to about 10.5. Typically, for example, activators with electron-withdrawing moieties are used for near-neutral or sub-neutral pH ranges. Alkalis and buffering agents can be used to secure such pH.<br>
Acyl lactam activators, as described in U.S. 5,698,504, U.S. 5,695,679 and U.S. 5,686,014, each of which is cited herein above, are very useful herein, especially the acyl caprolactams (see for example WO 94-28102 A) and acyl valerolactams (see U.S. 5,503,639 Willey et al., issued April 2, 1996 incorporated herein by reference).<br>

Kirk Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 17, John Wiley and Sons, 1982 at<br>
pages 27-90 and especially at pages 63-72, all incorporated herein by reference. If a diacyl<br>
peroxide is used, it will preferably be one which exerts minimal adverse impact on<br>
spotting/filming.<br>
(c)	Metal-containing Bleach Catalysts - The present invention compositions and<br>
methods utilize metal-containing bleach catalysts that are effective for use in cleaning<br>
compositions. Preferred are manganese and cobalt-containing bleach catalysts.<br>
One type of metal-containing bleach catalyst is a catalyst system comprising a transition metal cation of defined bleach catalytic activity, such as copper, iron, titanium, ruthenium tungsten, molybdenum, or manganese cations, an auxiliary metal cation having little or no bleach catalytic activity, such as zinc or aluminum cations, and a sequestrate having defined stability constants for the catalytic and auxiliary metal cations, particularly ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, ethylenediamtnetetra (methylenephosphonic acid) and water-soluble salts thereof. Such catalysts are disclosed in U.S. 4,430,243 Bragg, issued February 2, 1982.<br>
Manganese Metal Complexes<br>
If desired, the compositions herein can be catalyzed by means of a manganese compound. Such compounds and levels of use are well known in the art and include, for example, the manganese-based catalysts disclosed in U.S. 5,576,282 Miracle et al., issued November 19, 1996; U.S. 5,246,621 Favre et al., issued September 21, 1993; U.S. 5,244,594 Favre et al., issued September 14, 1993; U.S. 5,194,416 Jurelleret al., issued March 16, 1993; U.S. 5,114,606 van Vlietet al., issued May 19, 1992; and European Pat. App. Pub. Nos. 549,271 Al, 549,272 Al, 544,440 A2, and 544,490 Al; Preferred examples of these catalysts include MnIV2(u-O)3( 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane)2(PF6)2, MnIII2(u-O)1 (u-OAc)2( 1,4,7-trimethyl-l,4,7-triazacyclononane)2(ClO4)2, MnIV4(u-O)6(l,4,7-triazacyclononane)4(ClO4)4, MnIIIMnIV4(u-O)] (u-OAc)2.( 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane)2(ClO4)3, MnIV ( 1,4,7-<br>
trimethyl-l,4,7-triazacyclononane)- (OCH3)3(PF6), and mixtures thereof. Other metal-based bleach catalysts include those disclosed in U.S. 4,430,243 included by reference herein above and U.S. 5,114,611 van Kralingen, issued May 19, 1992. The use of manganese with various complex ligands to enhance bleaching is also reported in the following: U.S. 4,728,455 Rerek, issued March I, 1988; U.S. 5,284,944 Madison, issued Februaary 8, 1994; U.S. 5,246,612 van Dijk et al., issued September 21, 1993; U.S. 5,256,779 Kerschner et al., issued October 26, 2993; U.S. 5,280,117 Kerschner et al., issued January 18, 1994; U.S. 5,274,147 Kerschner et a I., issued December 28, 1993; U.S. 5,153,161 Kerschner et al., issued October 6, 1992; and U.S. 5,227,084 Martens et al., issued July 13, 1993. Cobalt Metal Complexes<br>
Cobalt bleach catalysts useful herein are known, and are described, for example, in U.S. 5,597,936 Perkins et al., issued January 28, 1997; U.S. 5,595,967 Miracle et al., January 21, 1997; U.S. 5,703,030 Perkins et al., issued December 30, 1997; and M. L. Tobe, "Base Hydrolysis of Transition-Metal Complexes", Adv. Inorg. Bioinorg. Mech.. (1983), 2, pages 1-94. The most preferred cobalt catalyst useful herein are cobalt pentaamine acetate salts having the formula [Co(NH3)5OAc] Ty, wherein "OAc" represents an acetate moiety and "Ty" is an anion, and especially cobalt pentaamine acetate chloride, [Co(NH3)5OAc]Cl2; as well as [CoCNH3)5OAc](OAc)2; [Co(NH3)5OAc](PF6)2; [Co(NH3)5OAc](SO4); [Co. (NH3)5OAc](BF4)2; and [Co(NH3)5OAc](NO3)2 (herein "PAC").<br>
These cobalt catalysts are readily prepared by known procedures, such as taught for example in U.S. 5,597,936, U.S. 5,595,967, U.S. 5,703,030, cited herein above, the Tobe article and the references cited therein, and in U.S. Patent 4,810,410, to Diakun et al, issued March 7,1989, J. Chem. Ed. (1989). 66 (12), 1043-45; The Synthesis and Characterization of Inorganic Compounds, W.L. Jolly (Prentice-Hall; 1970), pp. 461-3; Inorg. Chem.. 18. 1497-1502 (1979); Inorg. Chem.. 21, 2881-2885 (1982); Inorg. Chem.. 18, 2023-2025 (1979); Inorg. Synthesis, 173-176(1960); and Journal of Physical Chemistry. 56, 22-25 (1952). Transition Metal Complexes of Macropolycyclic Rigid Ligands Compositions herein may also suitably include as bleach catalyst a transition metal complex of a macropolycyclic rigid ligand. The phrase "macropolycyclic rigid ligand" is sometimes abbreviated as "MRL" in discussion below. The amount used is a catalytically effective amount, suitably about 1 ppb or more, for example up to about 99.9%, more typically about 0.001 ppm or more, preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 500 ppm (wherein "ppb" denotes parts per billion by weight and "ppm" denotes parts per million by weight).<br>
Suitable transition metals e.g., Mn are illustrated hereinafter. "Macropolycyclic" means a MRL is both a macrocycle and is polycyclic. "Polycyclic" means at least bicyclic. The term "rigid" as used herein herein includes "having a superstructure" and "cross-bridged". "Rigid"<br>
has been defined as the constrained converse of flexibility: see D.H. Busch., Chemical Reviews., (1993), 93, 847-860, incorporated by reference. More particularly, "rigid" as used herein means that the MRL must be determinably more rigid than a macrocycle ("parent macrocycle") which is otherwise identical (having the same ring size and type and number of atoms in the main ring) but lacking a superstructure (especially linking moieties or, preferably cross-bridging moieties) found in the MRL's. In determining the comparative rigidity of macrocycles with and without superstructures, the practitioner will use the free form (not the metal-bound form) of the macrocycles. Rigidity is well-known to be useful in comparing macrocycles; suitable tools for determining, measuring or comparing rigidity include computational methods (see, for example, Zimmer, Chemical Reviews. (1995). 95(38), 2629-2648 or Hancock et al.. tnoreanica Chimica Acta. (1989). 164,73-84.<br>
Preferred MRL's herein are a special type of ultra-rigid ligand which is cross-bridged. A<br>
"cross-bridge" is nonlimitingly illustrated in 1.11 hereinbelow. In 1.11, the cross-bridge is a-<br>
CH2CH2- moiety. It bridges N   and N   in the illustrative structure. By comparison, a "same-side" bridge, for example if one were to be introduced across N   and N      in 1.11, would not be sufficient to constitute a "cross-bridge" and accordingly would not be preferred.<br>
Suitable metals in the rigid ligand complexes include Mn(II), Mn(III), Mn(IV), Mn(V), Fe(II), Fe(III), Fe(IV), Co(I), Co(II), Co(III), Ni(I), Ni(II), Ni(III), Cu(I), Cu(II), Cu(III), Cr(II), Cr(III), Cr(IV), Cr(V), Cr(VI), V(III), V(IV), V(V), Mo(IV), Mo(V), Mo(VI), W(IV), W(V), W(VI), Pd(II), Ru(II), Ru(lII), and Ru(IV). Preferred transition-metals in the instant transition-metal bleach catalyst include manganese, iron and chromium.<br>
More generally, the MRL's (and the corresponding transition-metal catalysts) herein suitably comprise:<br>
(a)	at least one macrocycle main ring comprising four or more heteroatoms; and<br>
(b)	a covalently connected non-metal superstructure capable of increasing the rigidity of the<br>
macrocycle, preferably selected from<br>
(i) a bridging superstructure, such as a linking moiety;<br>
(ii) a cross-bridging superstructure, such as a cross-bridging linking moiety; and<br>
(iii) combinations thereof.<br>
The term "superstructure" is used herein as defined in the literature by Busch et al., see, for example, articles by Busch in "Chemical Reviews".<br>
Preferred superstructures herein not only enhance the rigidity of the parent macrocycle, but also favor folding of the macrocycle so that it co-ordinates to a metal in a cleft. Suitable superstructures can be remarkably simple, for example a linking moiety such as any of those illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 below, can be used.<br>
Fig. 1 wherein n is an integer, for example from 2 to 8, preferably less than 6, typically 2 to 4, or<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Fig. 2<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein m and n are integers from about 1 to 8, more preferably from 1 to 3; Z is N or CH; and T is a compatible substituent, for example H, alkyl, trialkylammonium, halogen, nitro, sulfonate, or the like. The aromatic ring in 1.10 can be replaced by a saturated ring, in which the atom in Z connecting into the ring can contain N, O, S or C.<br>
Suitable MRL's are further nonlimitingly illustrated by the following compound: <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Fig. 3<br>
This is a MRL in accordance with the invention which is a highly preferred, cross-bridged, methyl-substituted (all nitrogen atoms tertiary) derivative of cyclam. Formally, this ligand is named 5,12-dimethyl-l,5,8,12-tetraazabicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane using the extended von Baeyer system. See "A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds: Recommendations 1993", R. Panico, W.H. Powell and J-C Richer (Eds.), Blackwell Scientific Publications, Boston, 1993; see especially section R-2.4.2.1.<br>
Transition-metal bleach catalysts of Macrocyclic Rigid Ligands which are suitable for use in the invention compositions can in general include known compounds where they conform with the definition herein, as well as, more preferably, any of a large number of novel compounds expressly designed for the present laundry or cleaning uses, and non-Iimitingly illustrated by any of the following: Dichloro-5,12-dimethyl-1,5,8,12-tetraazabicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane Manganese(II)<br>
Diaquo-5,12-dimethyl-l,5,8,12-tetraazabicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane Manganese(II)<br>

Hexafluorophosphate<br>
Dichloro-5,12-di-n-butyl-l,5,8,12-tetraaza bicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane Manganese(II) Dichloro-5,12-dibenzyl-l,5,8,12-tetraazabicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane Manganese(II) Dichloro-5-n-butyl-12-methyl-1,5,8,12-tetraaza- bicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane Manganese(II) DichIoro-5-n-octyl-12-methyl-l,5,8,12-tetraaza- bicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane Manganese(II) Dichloro-5-n-butyl-12-methyl-1,5,8,12-tetraaza- bicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane Manganese(II). As a practical matter, and not by way of limitation, the compositions and cleaning processes herein can be adjusted to provide on the order of at least one part per hundred million of the active bleach catalyst species in the aqueous washing medium, and will preferably provide from about 0.01 ppm to about 25 ppm, more preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 10 ppm, and most preferably from about 0.1 ppm to about 5 ppm, of the bleach catalyst species in the wash liquor. In order to obtain such levels in the wash liquor of an automatic washing process, typical compositions herein will comprise from about 0.0005% to about 0.2%, more preferably from about 0.004% to about 0.08%, of bleach catalyst, especially manganese or cobalt catalysts, by weight of the cleaning compositions.<br>
ADJUNCT INGREDIENTS<br>
The following are non-limiting examples of adjunct ingredients useful in the laundry compositions of the present invention, said adjunct ingredients include builders, optical brighteners, soil release polymers, dye transfer agents, dispersents, enzymes, suds suppressors, dyes, perfumes, colorants, filler salts, hydrotropes, photoactivators, fluorescers, fabric conditioners, hydrolyzable surfactants, preservatives, anti-oxidants, chelants, stabilizers, anti-shrinkage agents, anti-wrinkle agents, germicides, fungicides, anti corrosion agents, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Builders - The laundry detergent compositions of the present invention preferably comprise one or more detergent builders or builder systems. When present, the compositions will typically comprise at least about 1% builder, preferably from about 5%, more preferably from about 10% to about 80%, preferably to about 50%, more preferably to about 30% by weight, of detergent builder.<br>
The level of builder can vary widely depending upon the end use of the composition and its desired physical form. When present, the compositions will typically comprise at least about<br>
1% builder. Formulations typically comprise from about 5% to about 50%, more typically about 5% to about 30%, by weight, of detergent builder. Granular formulations typically comprise from about 10% to about 80%, more typically from about 15% to about 50% by weight, of the detergent builder. Lower or higher levels of builder, however, are not meant to be excluded.<br>
Inorganic or P-containing detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates (exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta-phosphates), phosphonates, phytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesquicarbonates), sulphates, and aluminosilicates. However, non-phosphate builders are required in some locales. Importantly, the compositions herein function surprisingly well even in the presence of the so-called "weak" builders (as compared with phosphates) such as citrate, or in the so-called "underbuilt" situation that may occur with zeolite or layered silicate builders.<br>
Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metal silicates, particularly those having a SiO2:Na2O ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1 and layered silicates, such as the layered sodium silicates described in U.S. 4,664,839 Rieck, issued May 12, 1987. NaSKS-6 is the trademark for a crystalline layered silicate marketed by Hoechst (commonly abbreviated herein as "SKS-6"). Unlike zeolite builders, the Na SKS-6 silicate builder does not contain aluminum. NaSKS-6 has the delta-Na2SiO5 morphology form of layered silicate. It can be prepared by methods such as those described in German DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043. SKS-6 is a highly preferred layered silicate for use herein, but other such layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSixO2x+1.yH2O wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1.9 to 4, preferably 2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0 can be used herein. Various other layered silicates from Hoechst include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the alpha, beta and gamma forms. As noted above, the delta-Na2SiO5 (NaSKS-6 form) is most preferred for use herein. Other silicates may also be useful such as for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crispening agent in granular formulations, as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
Examples of carbonate builders are the alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on November 15, 1973.<br>
Aluminosilicate builders are useful in the present invention. Aluminosilicate builders are of great importance in most currently marketed heavy duty granular detergent compositions, and can also be a significant builder ingredient in liquid detergent formulations. Aluminosilicate builders include those having the empirical formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5, and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264.<br>
Useful aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are commercially available. These aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally-occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived. A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is disclosed in U.S. 3,985,669, Krummel et al, issued October 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite MAP and Zeolite X. In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula:<br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, especially about 27. This material is known as Zeolite A. Dehydrated zeolites (x = 0 - 10) may also be used herein. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of about 0.1-10 microns in diameter.<br>
Organic detergent builders suitable for the purposes of the present invention include, but are not restricted to, a wide variety of polycarboxylate compounds. As used herein, "poly-carboxylate" refers to compounds having a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Polycarboxylate builder can generally be added to the composition in acid form, but can also be added in the form of a neutralized salt. When utilized in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred.<br>
Included among the polycarboxylate builders are a variety of categories of useful materials. One important category of polycarboxylate builders encompasses the ether polycarboxy-lates, including oxydisuccinate, as disclosed in U.S. 3,128,287 Berg, issued April 7, 1964, and U.S. 3,635,830 Lamberti et al., issued January 1 8, 1972. See also "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. 4,663,071 Bush et al., issued May 5, 1987. Suitable ether polycarboxylates also include cyclic compounds, particularly alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S. 3,923,679 Rapko, issued December 2, 1975; U.S. 4,158,635 Crutchfield et al., issued June 19, 1979; U.S. 4,120,874 Crutchfield et al., issued October 17, 1978; and U.S. 4,102,903 Crutchfield et al., issued July 25, 1978.<br>
Other useful detergency builders include the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copoly-mers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether, 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy benzene-2, 4, 6-trisulphonic acid, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, as well as polycarboxylates such as mellitic acid, succinic acid, oxy-disuccinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxyIic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations. Also suitable in the detergent compositions of the present invention are the 3,3-dicar-boxy-4-oxa-l,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. 4,566,984, Bush, issued January 28, 1986. Useful succinic acid builders include the C5-C20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof. A particularly preferred compound of this type is do-decenylsuccinic acid. Specific examples of succinate builders include: laurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsucci-nate, and the like. Laurylsuccinates are the preferred builders of this group, and are described in European Patent Application 86200690.5/0,200,263, published November 5, 1986.<br>
Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. 4,144,226, Crutchfield et al., issued March 13, 1979 and in U.S. 3,308,067, Diehl, issued March 7, 1967. See also Diehl U.S. Patent 3,723,322.<br>
Fatty acids, e.g., C12-C18 monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into the compositions alone, or in combination with the aforesaid builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Such use of fatty acids will generally<br>
result in a diminution of sudsing, which should be taken into account by the formulator.<br>
In situations where phosphorus-based builders can be used, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, the various alkali metal phosphates such as the well-known sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium ortho-phosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethane-]-hydroxy-l,l-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates (see, for example, U.S. Patents 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137) can also be used.<br>
Dispersants<br>
A description of other suitable polyalkyleneimine dispersants which may be optionally combined with the bleach stable dispersants of the present invention can be found in U.S. 4,597,898 Vander Meer, issued July 1, 1986; European Patent Application 111,965 Oh and Gosselink, published June 27, 1984; European Patent Application 111,984 Gosselink, published June 27, 1984; European Patent Application 112,592 Gosselink, published July 4, 1984; U.S. 4,548,744 Connor, issued October 22, 1985; and U.S. 5,565,145 Watson et al., issued October 15, 1996; all of which are included herein by reference. However, any suitable clay/soil<br>
dispersant or anti-redepostion agent can be used in the laundry compositions of the present invention.<br>
In addition, polymeric dispersing agents which include polymeric polycarboxylates and polyethylene glycols, are suitable for use in the present invention. Polymeric polycarboxylate materials can be prepared by polymerizing or copolymerizing suitable unsaturated monomers, preferably in their acid form. Unsaturated monomeric acids that can be polymerized to form suitable polymeric polycarboxylates include acrylic acid, maleic acid (or maleic anhydride), fumaric acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid. The presence in the polymeric polycarboxylates herein or monomeric segments, containing no carboxylate radicals such as vinylmethyl ether, styrene, ethylene, etc. is suitable provided that such segments do not constitute more than about 40% by weight.<br>
Particularly suitable polymeric polycarboxylates can be derived from acrylic acid. Such acrylic acid-based polymers which are useful herein are the water-soluble salts of polymerized acrylic acid. The average molecular weight of such polymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000 to 10,000, more preferably from about 4,000 to 7,000 and most preferably from about 4,000 to 5,000. Water-soluble salts of such acrylic acid polymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Soluble polymers of this type are known materials. Use of polyacrylates of this type in detergent compositions has<br>
been disclosed, for example, in Diehl, U.S. Patent 3,308,067, issued march 7, 1967.<br>
Acrylic/maleic-based copolymers may also be used as a preferred component of the<br>
dispersing/anti-redeposition agent. Such materials include the water-soluble salts of copolymers of acrylic acid and maleic acid. The average molecular weight of such copolymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000, preferably from about 5,000, more preferably from about 7,000 to 100,000, more preferably to 75,000, most preferably to 65,000. The ratio of acrylate to maleate segments in such copolymers will generally range from about 30:1 to about 1:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to 2:1. Water-soluble salts of such acrylic acid/maleic acid copolymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Soluble acrylate/maleate copolymers of this type are known materials which are described in European Patent Application No. 66915, published December 15, 1982, as well as in EP 193,360, published September 3, 1986, which also describes such polymers comprising hydroxypropylacrylate. Still other useful dispersing agents include the maleic/acrylic/vinyl alcohol terpolymers. Such materials are also disclosed in EP 193,360, including, for example, the 45/45/10 terpolymer of acrylic/maleic/vinyl alcohol.<br>
Another polymeric material which can be included is polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG can exhibit dispersing agent performance as well as act as a clay soil removal-antiredeposition agent. Typical molecular weight ranges for these purposes range from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 50,000, more preferably from about 1,500 to about 10,000.<br>
Polyaspartate and polyglutamate dispersing agents may also be used, especially in conjunction with zeolite builders. Dispersing agents such as polyaspartate preferably have a molecular weight (avg.) of about 10,000. Soil Release Agents<br>
The compositions according to the present invention may optionally comprise one or more soil release agents. If utilized, soil release agents will generally comprise from about 0.01%, preferably from about 0.1%, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 10%, preferably to about 5%, more preferably to about 3% by weight, of the composition. Polymeric soil release agents are characterized by having both hydrophilic segments, to hydrophilize the surface of hydrophobic fibers, such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments, to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of the laundry cycle and, thus, serve as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments. This can enable stains occuring subsequent to treatment with the soil release agent to be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures.<br>

METHOD OF USE<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for using the laundry detergent or pre-soak compositions to suitably clean fabric.<br>
The methods of the present invention include a method for cleaning fabric comprising the step of contacting fabric in need of cleaning with an aqueous solution containing a least 50 ppm, preferably at least about 100 ppm, more preferably at least about 200 ppm, of a laundry detergent composition which comprises:<br>
a)	from about 0.01% by weight, of a detersive surfactant selected from the group<br>
consisting of anionic, cationic, nonionic, zwitterionic, ampholytic surfactants,<br>
and mixtures thereof;<br>
b)	from about 0.01% by weight, of a soil dispersant as described herein above; and<br>
c)	the balance carriers and adjunct ingredients.<br>
The detergent compositions according to the present invention can be in liquid, paste, laundry bar, or granular form. Such compositions can be prepared by combining the essential and optional components in the requisite concentrations in any suitable order and by any conventional means.<br>
The polyalkyleneimines of the present invention can be incorporated into granular detergent compositions in a variety of ways inter alia they can be suitably added as a slurry followed by spray drying of the slurry, the dispersants can be added as a separate particle, sprayed on to a nearly finished product, added with the balance of adjunct ingredients.<br>
As a non-limiting example, granular compositions are generally made by combining base granule ingredients, e.g., surfactants, builders, water, etc., as a slurry, and spray drying the resulting slurry to a low level of residual moisture (5-12%). The remaining dry ingredients, e.g., granules of the polyalkyleneimine dispersant, can be admixed in granular powder form with the<br>
spray dried granules in a rotary mixing drum. The liquid ingredients, e.g., solutions of the polyalkyleneimine dispersant, enzymes, binders and perfumes, can be sprayed onto the resulting granules to form the finished detergent composition. Granular compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", i.e. they may have a relatively higher density than conventional granular detergents, i.e. from 550 to 950 g/1. In such case, the granular detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of "inorganic filler salt", compared to conventional granular detergents; typical filler salts are alkaline earth metal salts of sulphates and chlorides, typically sodium sulphate; "compact" detergents typically comprise not more than 10% filler salt.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations. Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", in such case, the liquid detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of water, compared to conventional liquid detergents. Addition of the polyalkyleneimine dispersant to liquid detergent or other aqueous compositions of this invention may be accomplished by simply mixing into the liquid solutions the polyalkyleneimine dispersant.<br>
