				<td>DRUG DELIVERY DEVICE<br>
The invention relates to a drug delivery device, more<br>
particularly to a drug delivery device for delivering<br>
a drug into a vagina or anus.<br>
Suppositories are usually used for treating vaginal<br>
infections or diseases in the anus. Typically, the<br>
suppository, in the form of a tablet, is inserted into<br>
the vagina or anus. Referring to Figure 1, a conventional<br>
process by which a drug 1 is delivered into a body cavity<br>
is by aiming one end 11 of the drug 1 at the opening<br>
of the vagina or anus, after which a finger is used to<br>
push the drug 1 deep into the vagina or anus. However,<br>
this conventional way of delivering the drug 1 into the<br>
body cavity has the following disadvantages:<br>
1.	It is necessary to wash the hands thoroughly or<br>
to use sterilized hand gloves during the drug delivery<br>
process.<br>
2.	The inner wall of the vagina or anus is easily<br>
scratched and injured by the fingernail of the inserted<br>
finger. This may be painful and lead to other<br>
complications .<br>
3.	The drug delivery process may induce emotional<br>
trauma.<br>
4 . Because it may not be possible to deliver the drug<br>
1 to a proper depth and position due to the limited length<br>
of the finger, the effect of the drug 1 is reduced, thereby<br>
prolonging the course of treatment,<br><br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is<br>
to provide a drug delivery device that dispenses with<br>
the need to insert a finger into a foodv cavitv during<br>
the delivery process.<br>
According to one aspect of this invention, a drug<br>
delivery device comprises an outer tube and an elongate<br>
plunger. The outer tube has a tubular wall provided with<br>
a drug entrance end and a drug release end. The drug<br>
release end has an opening, and a plurality of flexible<br>
ribs that project curvedly into the opening from the<br>
tubular wall to grate the drug release end. The ribs<br>
include first and second ribs that alternate with each<br>
other and that project from two opposite first sides<br>
of the tubular wall in two opposite directions and along<br>
substantially parallel lines, and third and fourth ribs<br>
that project from two opposite second sides of the<br>
tubular wall along lines that can intersect the parallel<br>
lines. Each of the second sides of the tubular wall<br>
interposes the first sides of the tubular wall. The third<br>
and fourth ribs are arranged such that the third and<br>
fourth ribs do not intersect each other and do not<br>
intersect the first and second ribs. The elongate plunger<br>
has an insert part that is inserted into the tubular<br>
wall and that has a forward push end to move to the drug<br>
release end, and a rear push end opposite to the forward<br>
push end and extending outwardly of the drug entrance<br>
end.<br><br>
According to another aspect of this invention, a drug<br>
delivery device comprises an outer tube and an elongate<br>
plunger. The outer tube has a tubular wall provided with<br>
a drug entrance end and a drug release end. The drug<br>
release end has an opening, and a plurality of flexible<br>
ribs that project curvedly into the opening from the<br>
tubular wall to grate the drug release end. The elongate<br>
plunger has an insert part that is inserted into the<br>
tubular wall and that has a forward push end to move<br>
to the drug release end, and a rear push end opposite<br>
to the forward push end and extending outwardly of the<br>
drug entrance end. The insert part includes a plurality<br>
of axially extending wing plates that extend radially<br>
to meet each other. The wing plates have axially<br>
extending free ends confronting and spaced apart from<br>
an inner wall face of the tubular wall. Two of the wing<br>
plates are opposite to each other in a diametric<br>
direction. Each of the two wing plates has a cutout<br>
portion formed in the free end of a corresponding one<br>
of the wing plates, and a flexible finger formed in the<br>
cutout portion and projecting outwardly to contact<br>
frictionally the inner wall face of the tubular wall.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become apparent in the following detailed<br>

Referring to Figures 2 to 5, the preferred embodiment<br>
of a drug delivery device according to the present<br>
invention is shown to comprise an outer tube 2 and an<br>
elongate plunger 3.<br><br>
The outer tube 2 has a tubular wall 22 defining a<br>
passage 21 that extends in an axial direction (X) for<br>
receiving a drug 4 in solid form. The cross section of<br>
the tubular wall 22 may be circular or oval in shape,<br>
or any other shape that has a non-pointed peripheral<br>
surface. The tubular wall 22 has a drug entrance end<br>
221, a drug release end 222, two lug portions 223, and<br>
a plurality of spaced-apart protrusions 224. The drug<br>
entrance end 221 is adapted for admitting the drug 4<br>
into the passage 21. The drug release end 222 is opposite<br>
to the drug entrance end 221 in the axial direction (X) ,<br>
and is adapted to be inserted into a body cavity.<br>
The drug release end 222 has an opening 20, and a<br>
plurality of flexible ribs 23 that project curvedly into<br>
the opening 20 from the tubular wall 22 so as to grate<br>
the drug release end 222, thereby preventing unforced<br>
removal of the drug 4 from the passage 21 via the drug<br>
release end 222, as best shown in Figure 4. The ribs<br>
23 include first and second ribs 231 that alternate with<br>
each other and that proj ect from two opposite first sides<br>
220 of the tubular wall 22 in two opposite directions<br>
and along substantially parallel lines, and third and<br>
fourth ribs 231' that project from two opposite second<br>
sides 220' of the tubular wall 22 along lines that can<br>
intersect the parallel lines. Each of the second sides<br>
220' of the tubular wall 22 interposes the first sides<br>
22 0. The third and fourth ribs 231' are arranged such<br><br>
that they do not intersect each other and do not intersect<br>
the first and second ribs 231. The first to fourth ribs<br>
231, 231' are made of a soft flexible material.<br>
The lug portions 223 are formed on the drug entrance<br>
end 221, and project radially, outwardly, and oppositely<br>
from an outer periphery thereof.<br>
The protrusions 224 are formed on an inner wall face<br>
of the tubular wall 22.<br>
The elongate plunger 3 has an insert part 30 that<br>
is inserted slidably into the tubular wall 22 . The insert<br>
part 30 has a forward push end 31. A rear push end 32<br>
is opposite to the forward push end 31, and extends<br>
outwardly of the drug entrance end 221. The forward push<br>
end 31 has a convex pushing surface. Each of the first<br>
to fourth ribs 231, 231' has a curvature substantially<br>
similar to that of the forward push end 31. The plunger<br>
3 has a length sufficient to enable the forward push<br>
end 31 to push apart the first to fourth ribs 231, 231'<br>
and to extend out of the drug release end 222 . The first<br>
to fourth ribs 231, 231' are capable of restricting<br>
inward movement of the forward push end 31 after the<br>
forward push end 31 is moved out of the drug release<br>
end 222.<br>
The insert part 30 includes four axially extending<br>
wing plates 33, 34 that extend radially to meet each<br>
other. Each of the wing plates 33, 34 has an axially<br>
extending free end 330 , 340 confronting and spaced apart<br><br>
from the inner wall face of the tubular wall 22, and<br>
a dent 331, 341 formed in the free end 330, 340 of the<br>
corresponding wing plate 33, 34 and proximate to the<br>
rear push end 32. The two wing plates 33 are opposite<br>
to each other in a diametric direction. Each of the two<br>
wing plates 33 has a cutout portion 332 formed in the<br>
free end of the corresponding wing plate 33, and a<br>
flexible finger 333 formed in the cutout portion 332<br>
and projecting outwardly to contact frictionally the<br>
inner wall face of the tubular wall 22.<br>
The rear push end 32 of the plunger 3 is physically<br>
larger than the passage 21 of the tubular wall 22.<br>
With reference to Figures 4 and 5, in use, the drug<br>
4 is first inserted into the passage 21 of the outer<br>
tube 2 via the drug entrance end 221 so as to drop into<br>
the drug release end 222. The drug 4 is hindered from<br>
undergoing further downward movement by the first to<br>
fourth ribs 231, 231' at this time. The plunger 3 is<br>
then inserted into the passage 21 until the flexible<br>
fingers 333 of the two wing plates 33 are in frictional<br>
contact with the inner wall face of the tubular wall<br>
22. When no external force is applied on the rear push<br>
end 32 of the plunger 3 , the plunger 3 is stably posit ioned<br>
within the passage 21 so that when the user shakes, moves,<br>
or alters the operating direction of the drug delivery<br>
device of the present invention, the drug 4 and the<br>
plunger 3 will not fall out of the outer tube 2.<br><br>
When the user pushes the rear push end 32 of the plunger<br>
3	until the flexible fingers 333 abut against the<br>
corresponding protrusions 224, the user knows that the<br>
plunger 3 has reached a suitable position and the drug<br>
4	is ready to be delivered because the flexible fingers<br>
333 will produce a large frictional contact with the<br>
corresponding protrusions 224 at this time.<br>
Referring to Figures 6 to 8, during operation of the<br>
drug delivery device of the present invention, the user's<br>
fingers are positioned on the outer tube 2 with two of<br>
the fingers abutting against the lug portions 223 and<br>
one of the fingers in contact with the rear push end<br>
32 of the plunger 3, after which the outer tube 2 is<br>
inserted into a proper depth of the vagina or anus. The<br>
rear push end 32 of the plunger 3 is then pushed inwardly<br>
so that the forward push end 31 of the plunger 3 moves<br>
along the axial direction (X) toward the drug release<br>
end 222 of the outer tube 2. Air is released through<br>
gaps between the tubular wall 22 and the wing plates<br>
33, 34. The rear push end 32 of the plunger 3 is pushed<br>
continuously until the forward push end 31 reaches the<br>
drug release end 222 of the outer tube 2, and the drug<br>
4 is pushed out of the drug release end 222 via the opening<br>
20 (see Figure 3) and through the ribs 231, 231'. The<br>
drug 4, therefore, is released into a proper depth and<br>
position of the body cavity.<br>
Referring to Figures 9 and 10, after the drug 4 is<br><br>
delivered into the body cavity, and the drug delivery<br>
device of the present invention is pulled out from the<br>
body cavity, the plunger 3 is pushed continuously until<br>
the rear push end 32 of the plunger 3 abuts against the<br>
drug entrance end 221 of the outer tube 2. At this time,<br>
the forward push end 31 of the plunger 3 extends out<br>
of the drug release end 222 of the outer tube 2 pushing<br>
apart the first to fourth ribs 231, 231' . Further, the<br>
dents 331, 341 of the wing plates 33, 34 engage the<br>
corresponding protrusions 224 of the tubular wall 22,<br>
and the first to fourth ribs 231, 231' extend curvedly<br>
toward and among the wing plates 33 , 34 so as to restrict<br>
movement of the forward push end 31 of the plunger 3.<br>
As such, the forward push end 31 of the plunger 3 cannot<br>
move along the axial direction (X) back toward the drug<br>
entrance end 221 of the outer tube 2.<br>
When an attempt is made to reuse the drug delivery<br>
device of the present invention by forcibly pulling the<br>
plunger 3 so as to move the forward push end 31 toward<br>
the drug entrance end 221, the forward push end 31 will<br>
destroy the structure of the first to fourth ribs 231,<br>
231', and thereby destroy the structure of the outer<br>
tube 2. Hence, the drug delivery device of the present<br>
invention cannot be used more than once.<br>
From the aforementioned description, the advantages<br>
of the drug delivery device of the present invention<br>
can be summarized as follows:<br><br>
1.	Since the drug 4 is pre-disposed in the outer tube<br>
2 and is delivered into the body cavity by operation<br>
of the plunger 3, the hands of the user need not come<br>
into contact with the drug 4 during the actual delivery<br>
process so that sanitation can be maintained and<br>
enhanced.<br>
2.	Because the first to fourth ribs 231, 231' are<br>
formed at the drug release end 222 of the outer tube<br>
2, and by virtue of their configurations and<br>
flexibilities, the first to fourth ribs 231, 231' not<br>
only can prevent unintentional removal of the drug 4<br>
from the outer tube 2, but can also permit easy release<br>
of the drug 4 from the outer tube 2 during the delivery<br>
process. Hence, the operation of the present invention<br>
is simple and easy.<br>
3.	Since the outer tube 2 can be circular or oval<br>
in shape, and since the first to fourth ribs 231, 231'<br>
are flexible , injury to the body cavity can be minimized,<br>
and comfort during use is enhanced.<br>
4.	The length of the outer tube 2 can be varied so<br>
as to suit different kinds of drug shapes and different<br>
delivery depths so that the drug 4 can be delivered into<br>
the proper depth of the body cavity, and effective<br>
treatment of the drug 4 can be achieved.<br>
5.	When an attempt is made to pull the forward push<br>
end 31 of the plunger 3 back into the outer tube 2, the<br>
structure of the ribs 231, 231' will be destroyed by<br><br>
the forward push end 31, thereby damaging the entire<br>
structure of the outer tube 2. Hence, the drug delivery<br>
device of the present invention cannot be reused, thereby<br>
enhancing the safety and sanitation of the drug delivery<br>
device.<br><br>
