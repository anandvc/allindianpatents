				<td>CONCRETE-BASED FLOORS AND WALL COVERINGS WITH AN<br>
ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to<br>
construction materials having anti-microbial<br>
effect. More particularly, the present invention is<br>
related to floors and wall coverings made of<br>
cement, aggregates and additives, having effective<br>
and lasting anti-microbial effect.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Microbes control is a major concern on a<br>
wide variety of fields encompassing home living and<br>
several industries. For example, contamination or<br>
lack of hygiene on floors, walls and ceilings at<br>
homes is a microbial infection source under<br>
considerable moisture conditions within an enclosed<br>
room.<br>
In the food industry, contamination with<br>
microorganisms in several stages such as: products<br>
manufacturing, processing and packing, is a serious<br>
problem from the point of view of food sanitation<br>
and preservation. In such case, the main microbial<br>
infection source is an environment contaminated by-<br>
microorganisms that adhere and grow upon the room<br>
walls, ceilings and floors, where food<br>
manufacturing, processing and packing is carried<br>
out; this contaminating microorganisms may have the<br>
chance to spread out and contaminate the food.<br>
Within the field of medical services, there<br>
exist strong demands for a biologically sanitized<br>
room as a measure against infections, due to an<br>
adverse environmental contamination of the surgery<br>
room, treatment room, examination room, patients<br>
room, waiting room, clinic, kitchen, etc. In this<br>
case, protecting walls, ceiling and floors against<br>
microbes attack and growth, represents a serious<br>
problem.<br>
It is very important that medicines and<br>
drugs are produced within a microorganisms-free<br>
neat environment.<br>
Within the field of the electronics<br>
industry, it is also acknowledged that<br>
manufacturing electronic components within a<br>
microbiologically neat environment is beneficial to<br>
improve electronic parts or components functioning,<br>
accuracy, reliability and production. Further, it<br>
is also important to prevent that bacteria and<br>
fungi adhere and grow on walls, ceilings and<br>
floors.<br>
Conventional measures against contamination<br>
by microorganisms include: i) surface cleaning such<br>
as: room, area or ward floors, walls and/or<br>
ceilings, with cleaning agents such as detergent,<br>
bleach, etc., which shall be regularly carried out<br>
at relatively short periods; ii) applying a<br>
microbicide agent to the surface, which represents<br>
the disadvantage of having a sustained action and<br>
short period of the agent applied; and iii)<br>
applying a coating material incorporating a<br>
microbicide agent that is applied on the floor,<br>
wall and/or ceiling surface, coating material may<br>
be applied in the form of a layer, film or sheet.<br>
Nowadays, a plurality of microbicide agents<br>
that can be used alone or combined to avoid microbe<br>
adhesion and spreading at homes and several<br>
industries surfaces has been developed. These<br>
microbicide agents can be mixed for example with<br>
cleaning products, compositions and disinfectants,<br>
or being applied as wall coverings on fabrics,<br>
paper, adhesive strips, plastic materials sheets,<br>
etc .<br>
A particular example of the efforts made on<br>
the art is disclosed by the United States<br>
application No. 4,008,351 entitled "Sheet or film<br>
material having antibacterial and anti-fungal<br>
activity", issued on February 15, 1977 to Mayumi et<br>
al, which discloses a sheet or film material having<br>
antibacterial and anti-fungal activity utilized to<br>
cover walls, ceiling and floors. Said material is<br>
obtained by mixing a benzimidazole and phtalimide.<br>
Such sheet or film material disclosed by said<br>
application is a thermoplastic material based<br>
product, and even that can provide a protection<br>
against microbial growth, it has the disadvantages<br>
of being an additional component which is submitted<br>
to wearing due to use and can be coated or replaced<br>
at the short run with the additional expenses<br>
entailed. This application does not suggest that<br>
microbicide agents can be an integral part of<br>
cement and aggregates based composition. Equally,<br>
making a long lasting product, such as floor or<br>
coating having a lasting anti-microbial effect, is<br>
not suggested.<br>
United States application No. 6,162,845<br>
entitled "Reinforced Concrete having Improved Anti-<br>
microbial Fibers", issued on December 19, 2000, to<br>
W. Wayne Freed, discloses a material product<br>
similar to concrete reinforced with fibers having<br>
an effective amount of a microbicide agent<br>
incorporated therein, to prolong concrete duration,<br>
where the microbicide agent is provided<br>
incorporated in or coating a plurality of fibers,<br>
which, in turn, are spread within a concrete<br>
matrix. Fibers inclusion with a microbicide agent<br>
is aimed to reinforce concrete and reduce concrete<br>
sensitivity to a biological attack. However, this<br>
document is referred to the fiber reinforced<br>
concrete specific application, whose fiber includes<br>
a microbicide agent (Microban Â® B) that protects<br>
concrete itself from deterioration due to<br>
microorganisms growth, this concrete is used for<br>
the construction of entire buildings and specially<br>
those in which an additional protection due to the<br>
use of this kind of agents is required. However,<br>
reference is not made to concrete-based floors and<br>
wall coverings in different forms and designs, that<br>
do not include a fiber as a reinforcement element<br>
and as a carrier for incorporating a microbicide<br>
agent, for the anti-microbial protection when being<br>
utilized as a floor and coating for walls and<br>
ceilings without the need of the entire building<br>
construction with such products. Also, there is no<br>
reference made of a finished product for specific<br>
use, having proved long lasting anti-microbial<br>
action using microbicide agents without including a<br>
fiber as a carrier.<br>
United States application No. 6,350,350<br>
entitled "Construction Material", issued on<br>
February 26, 2002 to Eisaku Tozaka, discloses a<br>
construction material containing microcapsules of a<br>
specific bactericide agent, mixed with a basic<br>
construction material such as cement, aggregates<br>
and water mixture. Said basic material with the<br>
bactericide agent microcapsules is used for floors,<br>
walls and ceilings construction. The liquid<br>
bactericide agent contained in the microcapsules is<br>
gradually perspired or infiltrated into the<br>
construction material each time microcapsules break<br>
due to a change over time. The construction<br>
material with an antibacterial action of the<br>
present invention presents the disadvantage of<br>
requiring further devices and processes for first<br>
forming the microcapsules containing the specific<br>
microbicide agent, and after having obtained this<br>
microcapsules, are incorporated with the mixture to<br>
finally form the construction material. Another<br>
disadvantage of this construction material is the<br>
cost factor entailed when being used to build walls<br>
and construction in general, to provide the<br>
protection mentioned above. However, there is no<br>
suggestion on said application, that the<br>
microbicide agent be directly integrated as another<br>
component of the construction material, and<br>
including an immediate and long lasting anti-<br>
microbial action, this is, without using a carrier<br>
such as microcapsules.<br>
There are other publications and<br>
applications that incorporate several additives<br>
being mixed with concrete or a construction<br>
material, or being disposed as a coating on said<br>
concrete or construction material. For example,<br>
Russian application No. 2149147, entitled<br>
"Agglomerating Agent" to Sycheva et al . , published<br>
on May 20, 2000 discloses the preparation of<br>
solutions and concretes under low temperatures<br>
showing an antibacterial activity by the<br>
incorporation of KmnO4 to a ratio of 0.1 to 0.3% by<br>
weight. The use of KmnO4 as a microbicide compound<br>
shows the disadvantage of providing a particular<br>
coloration to the concrete, preventing the<br>
production of several products with different<br>
colors. Besides, due to said coloration provided by<br>
KmnO4, its application on floors and ceilings and<br>
walls wall coverings is very limited.<br>
Japanese application No. 11236734 entitled<br>
"Antibacterial Construction Material" to Miyasaki<br>
Norihiko published on August 31, 1999, discloses an<br>
ultra-violet curing type antibacterial coating<br>
composition for interiors finishing, such as a<br>
floor, wall or ceiling; where the antibacterial<br>
coating composition is a painting-type composition<br>
comprising a base resin and amino acid salt of an<br>
antibacterial metal. This kind of wall coverings<br>
show the disadvantage of metal-based products used<br>
for providing the antibacterial effect, such metal-<br>
based products present problems, as its handling<br>
and application to form small layers or protective<br>
films is concerned. For the particular case that is<br>
used as a coating for a floor, said coating is worn<br>
or removed due to simple use, being necessary to<br>
prepare again the floor to apply the antibacterial<br>
coating composition once again.<br>
Chinese application No. 1223795 entitled<br>
"Bactericide Additive for Construction, its<br>
Preparation Method and Use" to Tian Shulin,<br>
published on July 28, 1999, discloses a bactericide<br>
additive for construction materials which is<br>
prepared from a carrier and antibacterial metal<br>
salt. This document shows the disadvantage that<br>
additional stages and materials for manufacturing<br>
and adequate bactericide additive that can be used<br>
for the construction industry are required.<br>
However, it is not mentioned that said active<br>
component could be directly used for preparing<br>
concrete-based elements (for example, floors,<br>
walls, and ceilings coating) keeping its<br>
microbicide properties and sustaining a long<br>
lasting effect.<br>
Japanese application No. 4331752 entitled<br>
"Antibacterial and Anti-fungal Basic Material for<br>
Construction" to Nawata Nozomi et al . , published on<br>
November 19, 1992 is referred to the addition of<br>
0.01 to 30 parts by weight of an antibacterial and<br>
anti-fungal compound, such as 2,2,3 -thioyodineallyl<br>
alcohol added to the base material (cement or<br>
plaster). The antibacterial and anti-fungal<br>
compound can be mixed with a base material, where<br>
the base material is in powder, not molded or not<br>
cured yet; this antibacterial and anti-fungal<br>
compound is applied to the base material surface<br>
through the recoating or spraying method. This<br>
Japanese application describes a product with an<br>
antibacterial and anti-fungal action which is used<br>
to coat with small layers the elements desired to<br>
be protected; however, it does not suggest the use<br>
of a microbicide agent in an integral form of the<br>
concrete-based element used on floors, walls, and<br>
ceilings wall coverings, etc., which has a long<br>
lasting anti-microbial effect and which does not<br>
require any further protecting layers for<br>
protecting the surface.<br>
Japanese application No. 8109108 entitled<br>
"Construction material having an antibacterial<br>
activity consisting of a combined material obtained<br>
by using mordenite and its production" to Ogura<br>
Ywsuke et al . , published on April 30, 1996,<br>
discloses a material that comprises a carrier made<br>
from mordenite (main component) that is immersed in<br>
a diluted solution of silver nitrate, where an<br>
alkaline ion is displaced with a silver ion. The<br>
carrier is in combination with a construction<br>
material, such as cement, wood, chips, paper or<br>
fibers to obtain a combined material. This combined<br>
material is formed and processed desirably as a<br>
construction material. This material is useful<br>
indoors as well as outdoors. This Japanese<br>
application is related to a material for general<br>
construction, which includes a further step of<br>
soaking one of its components with the<br>
antibacterial agent solution to displace one<br>
alkaline ion with a silver ion, however, it is not<br>
mentioned that the agent can be directly added<br>
without the use of a carrier to dose the<br>
microbicide agent, avoiding the use of heavy metal<br>
based compounds and the need of additional steps,<br>
providing an efficient and long lasting anti-<br>
microbial effect.<br>
According to the above mentioned, there is<br>
no document registered that describes or suggests a<br>
concrete-based floor or coating not requiring<br>
additional materials or carriers and procedures to<br>
directly incorporate the microbicide agent as a<br>
component of the concrete-based floors and wall<br>
coverings composition. Consequently, there is a<br>
need for useful concrete-based floors and wall<br>
coverings for applications where a more hygienic<br>
environment is required, that comprises at least an<br>
organic microbicide agent being readily mixed<br>
directly, and with fast and long lasting release of<br>
the active agent on its surface, to inhibit<br>
microbial growth.<br>
Therefore, it is an objective of the<br>
present invention to provide common manufactured<br>
concrete-based floors and wall coverings, and at<br>
the same time exhibit an efficient and long lasting<br>
anti-microbial effect.<br>
Another objective of the present invention<br>
is to provide at least one microbicide agent as a<br>
cement component, aggregates and additives mixture,<br>
for manufacturing finished floors and wall<br>
coverings ready to be installed.<br>
Still another objective of the present<br>
invention is to provide concrete-based floors and<br>
wall coverings with efficient inhibition of<br>
microorganisms growth and contact, to be used in<br>
areas such as homes, several industries, food<br>
processing plants, pharmaceutical labs, hospitals,<br>
etc., which require extraordinary cleanliness.<br>
Still a further objective of the present<br>
invention is to provide a low cost finished product<br>
of the type of a concrete-based floor and/or<br>
coating with anti-microbial effect that will not<br>
require the use of carriers to be incorporated into<br>
a base material without special mechanisms for its<br>
release.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides for a concrete-based floor or wall covering with<br>
anti-microbial effect, made on a concrete basis, comprising a base material and an effective amount<br>
of 0.01% to 5% by weight of at least one microbicide organic agent, such as herein described,<br>
homogeneously distributed in the base material to provide an efficient and long lasting effect to<br>
inhibit biological attack and spreading out of organisms on the floor or wall covering surface.<br>
The invention also provides for a method for manufacturing a floor or wall covering with<br>
anti-microbial effect, said method comprising the steps of: (a) taking cement, fine aggregates, solid<br>
aggregates, additives and water, in a ratio depending on the resistance design required based on the<br>
use of the floor or covering to form base material components ; (b) mixing the base material<br>
components to form an homogeneous paste ; (c) pouring the homogeneous paste in molds of shape<br>
and size of the floor or wall covering ; (d) pressing the homogeneous paste contained in the moulds<br>
to eliminate excess water and to obtain a dewatered paste with the required density and porosity ; (e)<br>
removing the hardened floor or wall covering formed by the dewatered homogeneous paste from the<br>
mould ; (f) curing the floor or wall covering at normal temperature for 48 hours or by means of water<br>
vapour for 24 hours to obtain a concrete-based, cured floor or wall covering ;, (g) calibrating the<br>
cured floor or wall covering to the desired shape and dimensions ; and (h) polishing and brightening<br>
the concrete-based floor or wall covering ; wherein said method also comprises a step of adding an<br>
effective amount of 0.01% to 5% of at least one microbicide agent, such as herein described, before<br>
the step (b).<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the concrete-based floor and/or coating with anti-<br>
microbial effect comprises a base material and an effective amount at least of a microbicide organic<br>
agent mixed directly with the base material. The base material is a mixture comprising cement, fine<br>
aggregates, solid aggregates, additives and water.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the floor and / or coating base material comprises from<br>
about 5 to approximately 50% by weight of cement, upto approximately 50% by weight of fine<br>
aggregates, from about 20 to approximately 30% by weight of solid aggregates, from about 0.01 to<br>
approximately 5% by weight of additives, and where a 0.01% to 5% by weight of a base material of<br>
at least one microbicide agent or a mixture of microbicide agents is added.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As mentioned before, the present invention<br>
is related to a concrete-based floor and/or coating<br>
which includes an effective amount at least of a<br>
microbicide agent or a mixture of microbicide<br>
agents to inhibit biological attack and spreading<br>
out of organisms.<br>
The present invention is a concrete-based<br>
construction material for finishes such as a floor<br>
and/or coating having an immediate anti-microbial<br>
effect. The concrete-based construction material<br>
for finishes comprises a base material and an<br>
effective amount at least of a microbicide organic<br>
agent or a mixture of various microbicide organic<br>
agents being directly mixed with the base material.<br>
The base material is a mixture comprising cement,<br>
fine aggregates, solid aggregates, additives and<br>
water. In a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the base material comprises from about<br>
5% to approximately 50% by weight of cement, up to<br>
approximately 50% by weight of fine aggregates,<br>
from about 20 to approximately 30% by weight of<br>
solid aggregates, from about 0.01 to approximately<br>
5% by weight of additives.<br>
Useful microbicide agents in the present<br>
invention are organic, non-toxic, and<br>
environmentally save during their use. As it is<br>
known, most of microbicide agents control the<br>
organisms growth by penetrating the organism thin<br>
cellular walls, thereby interrupting the organism<br>
metabolic function, and finally killing said<br>
organism. In this way, it shall be understood in<br>
the present invention that the term "microbicide<br>
agent" refers to including any organic compound<br>
that effectively inhibits a microbial attack and<br>
its spreading out on a concrete-based finished<br>
floor or coating. The term "at least one<br>
microbicide agent" as used in the present<br>
invention, should be understood as been feasible to<br>
use a microbicide agent or a mixture of different<br>
microbicide agents .<br>
Proper microbicide agents to be used by the<br>
present invention are derivatives from phenol,<br>
especially 2,4,4'-trichlorine-2'-hydroxyphenol (for<br>
example, Triclosan, irgasan, microban), organotins,<br>
especially butyl-tin maleate (for example, Ultra<br>
Fresh), sodium o-phenylphenate tetrahydrate<br>
(Dowcide-A), and alkyldimethyl benzylammonium<br>
chloride.<br>
Dose ratio for adding microbicide agents to<br>
the base material used by the present invention<br>
varies significantly depending on the use and<br>
environmental conditions of the place on which the<br>
concrete-based floor or coating will be applied.<br>
Therefore, an effective amount of a microbicide<br>
agent to prevent bacteria and microorganisms<br>
adhesion, growth and spreading out at homes and<br>
several industries surfaces is required. In most of<br>
the cases, the effective ratio of the microbicide<br>
agent or the mixture of microbicide agents will<br>
range from 0.01% to 5% by weight of the base<br>
material.<br>
A preferred method to add at least a<br>
microbicide agent is simply mixing the microbicide<br>
agent along with the base material components, this<br>
is, cement, fine aggregates, solid aggregates,<br>
additives and water, through conventional means<br>
well known in the state of the art. There for, a<br>
concrete mixture with anti-microbial effect is<br>
obtained, which is subsequently submitted to a<br>
manufacturing procedure to form a floor and/or<br>
coating.<br>
An illustrative manufacturing method to<br>
form a floor and coating comprises the following<br>
steps :<br>
1) Dose ratio.- Base material ingredients<br>
or components at an adequate ratio, being according<br>
to the required resistance design by the<br>
application that shall be given to the element, are<br>
dosed along with an effective amount of at least<br>
one microbicide organic agent, depending on the<br>
anti-microbial effect desired. Main base material<br>
compounds are cement, fine aggregates, solid<br>
aggregates, (marble and granite pieces, etc.), dyes<br>
and water.<br>
2) Mixing or kneading.- Once the base<br>
material and the microbicide agent being dosed,<br>
these are mixed or kneaded, through any appropriate<br>
method or device known in the art, to obtain a<br>
homogeneous paste with anti-microbial effect and<br>
properly integrate the base material ingredients<br>
and the microbicide agent.<br>
3) Moulds refilling.- An adequate amount of<br>
previously homogenized paste with anti-microbial<br>
effect is dosed and refilled to the moulds, which<br>
can have several forms and sizes according to the<br>
floors and wall coverings design (rectangular,<br>
curved, etc . ) .<br>
4) Pressing.- The paste previously poured<br>
into the moulds is submitted under pressure<br>
application, through a press, for the paste to<br>
eliminate water excess and to obtain a product with<br>
the adequate density and porosity to be handled by<br>
the machinery for subsequent stages.<br>
5) Curing.- Once the product is hardened<br>
through the pressing stage, floors and wall<br>
covering frames are disassembled, and taken to the<br>
curing room; the latter can be made under normal<br>
temperature, which will last 48 hours or by using<br>
vapor, through which time is reduced to 24 hours.<br>
6) Calibration.- Once floor tiles have been<br>
set and acquired a resistance through the curing<br>
stage, their dimensions are calibrated by using<br>
surfacing and shaping machines perfectly aligned.<br>
7) Polishing and brightening.- After<br>
calibration, floors and wall coverings pass through<br>
polishing and brightening line, which comprises<br>
multiple grindstones which boast, abrade, polish<br>
and brighten the above.<br>
8) Packing.- final product is packed in<br>
multiple presentations.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
In order to show the practice of the<br>
invention and evaluate the efficacy thereof, a base<br>
material is prepared by mixing 25% by weight of<br>
cement, 50% by weight of fine aggregates, 24.5% by<br>
weight of solid aggregates (marble pieces), and<br>
water in a sufficient amount to form a mixture.<br>
During base material mixture forming, a microbicide<br>
agent of 0.05% by weight (Triclosan) is added and<br>
homogeneously mixed with the entire mixture of base<br>
material, forming thereby a base material with<br>
anti-microbial effect. Then, the mixture with anti-<br>
microbial effect is poured in a mould with adequate<br>
shape and dimensions in order to form a concrete<br>
floor tile.<br>
After the floor tile with anti-microbial<br>
effect has been cured, a sample of approximately 25<br>
mm of diameter (treated element) is taken to prove<br>
the anti-microbial inhibition along with the floor<br>
tile made with a non-treated conventional material<br>
(element of control). Test results are shown in<br>
As it can be seen from table 1, the inhibition<br>
zone around test tubes treated with the microbicide<br>
agent (Triclosan in this case) shows the effect the<br>
elements have when treated to inhibit<br>
microorganisms growth and reproduction, in other<br>
tests, the growth inhibitor effect that this kind<br>
of treatment has on fungi, has also been shown.<br>
This shows the protecting capacity these concrete-<br>
based floors and wall coverings have to contribute<br>
for the protection of microorganisms spreading out<br>
on places where they have been used.<br>
Even though certain embodiment of the<br>
invention has been illustrated and described, it<br>
should be noted that several changes and<br>
modifications could be made there on. There for,<br>
the present invention shall not be considered as<br>
limited excepting by what the prior art demands and<br>
by the spirit of claims attached herein.<br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. Concrete-based floor or wall covering with anti-microbial effect, made on a concrete basis,<br>
comprising a base material and an effective amount of 0.01% to 5% by weight of at least one<br>
microbicide organic agent, such as herein described, homogeneously distributed in the base material<br>
to provide an efficient and long lasting effect to inhibit biological attack and spreading out of<br>
organisms on the floor or wall covering surface.<br>
2. Concrete-based floor or wall covering with anti-microbial effect, as claimed in claim 1,<br>
wherein said base material comprises 5 to 50% by weight of cement, up to 50% by weight of fine<br>
aggregates, 20 to 30% by weight of solid aggregates, and 0.01 to 5% by weight of additives, and<br>
wherein the microbicide agent is present in an amount of 0.01% to 5% by weight of the base<br>
material.<br>
3. Concrete-based floor or wall covering with anti-microbial effect, as claimed in claim 1,<br>
wherein said microbicide organic agent is selected from a group consisting of derivatives of phenol,<br>
organotins, sodium o-phenylphenate tetrahydrate or alkyldimethyl benzylammonium chloride or a<br>
mixture thereof.<br>
4. Concrete-based floor or wall covering with anti-microbial effect, as claimed in claim 3,<br>
wherein said phenol derivatives are preferably derived from 2, 4, 4'-trichlorine-2'-hydroxyphenol, and<br>
said organotin is preferably butyl-tin maleate.<br>
5. A method for manufacturing a floor or wall covering with anti-microbial effect as claimed in<br>
any one of claims 1 to 4, said method comprising the steps of : (a) taking cement, fine aggregates,<br>
solid aggregates, additives and water, in a ratio depending on the resistance design required based on<br>
the use of the floor or covering to form base material components ; (b) mixing the base material<br>
components to form an homogeneous paste ; (c) pouring the homogeneous paste in molds of shape<br>
and size of the floor or wall covering ; (d) pressing the homogeneous paste contained in the moulds<br>
to eliminate excess water and to obtain a dewatered paste with the required density and porosity ; (e)<br>
removing the hardened floor or wall covering formed by the dewatered homogeneous paste from the<br>
mould ; (f) curing the floor or wall covering at normal temperature for 48 hours or by means of water<br>
vapour for 24 hours to obtain a concrete-based, cured floor or wall covering ; (g) calibrating the<br>
cured floor or wall covering to the desired shape and dimensions ; and (h) polishing and brightening<br>
the concrete-based floor or wall covering ; wherein said method also comprises a step of adding an<br>
effective amount of 0.01% to 5% of at least one microbicide agent, such as herein described, before<br>
the step (b).<br>
6. Concrete-based floor or wall covering with anti-microbial effect, substantially as herein<br>
described, particularly with reference to the foregoing examples.<br>
A concrete-based floor or coating with<br>
anti-microbial effect, comprising a base material<br>
and an effective amount of at least one microbicide<br>
organic agent, mixed directly with the base<br>
material is described; the base material is a<br>
mixture containing cement, fine aggregates, solid<br>
aggregates, additives and water; where the<br>
microbicide agent mixed with the base material<br>
provides an efficient and long lasting anti-<br>
microbial effect.</td>
