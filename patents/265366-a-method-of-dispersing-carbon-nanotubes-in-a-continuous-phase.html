				<td>Dispersion method<br>
The present invention relates to a method of dispersing<br>
carbon  nanotubes   (CNTs)   in  a  continuous  phase,<br>
especially in at least one dispersion medium, and also<br>
to the dispersions themselves that are obtainable in<br>
this way, and to their use.<br>
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs for carbon nanotubes) are<br>
microscopically small tubular structures (i.e.,<br>
molecular nanotubes) of carbon. Their walls - like<br>
those of the fullerenes or like the planes of<br>
graphite - are composed essentially exclusively of<br>
carbon, the carbon atoms occupying a honeycomblike<br>
structure with hexagons and with three bond partners in<br>
each case, this structure being dictated by the sp2<br>
hybridization of the carbon atoms.<br>
Carbon nanotubes derive accordingly from the carbon<br>
planes of graphite which have, so to speak, been rolled<br>
up to form a tube: The carbon atoms form a<br>
honeycomblike hexagonal structure and three bond<br>
partners in each case. Tubes with an ideally hexagonal<br>
structure have a uniform thickness and are linear; also<br>
possible, however, are bent or narrowing tubes which<br>
contain pentagonal carbon rings. Depending on the way<br>
in which the honeycomb network of the graphite is<br>
rolled to form a tube ("straight" or "oblique"), there<br>
are helical (i.e., wound in the manner of a screw) and<br>
also nonmirror-symmetric structures, i.e., chiral<br>
structures.<br>
A distinction is made between _single-wall carbon<br>
nanotubes (SWCNTs or SWNTs) and multiwall carbon<br>
nanot_ubes (MWCNTs or MWNTs) , between open or closed<br>
carbon nanotubes (i.e., with a "cap", which for example<br>
is a section of a fullerene structure), and also<br>
between empty and filled (with, for example, silver,<br>
liquid lead, noble gases, etc.) carbon nanotubes.<br><br>
The diameter of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is in the<br>
region of a few nanometers (e.g., 1 to 50 nm), although<br>
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with tube diameters of only<br>
0.4 nm have already been prepared. Lengths ranging from<br>
several micrometers up to millimeters for individual<br>
tubes and up to a few centimeters for tube bundles have<br>
already been attained.<br>
Depending on the detail of the structure, the<br>
electrical conductivity within the carbon nanotubes is<br>
metallic or semiconducting. There are also carbon<br>
nanotubes known which at low temperatures are<br>
superconducting.<br>
Transistors and simple circuits with semiconducting<br>
carbon nanotubes have already been produced.<br>
Additionally, attempts have already been made to carry<br>
out specific production of complex circuits from<br>
different carbon nanotubes.<br>
The mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are<br>
outstanding: CNTs have - for a density of, for example,<br>
1.3 to 1.4 g/cm3 - an enormous tensile strength of<br>
several megapascals; in comparison to this, steel, for<br>
a density of at least 7.8 g/cm3, has a maximum tensile<br>
strength of only about 2 MPa, thus giving a ratio of<br>
tensile strength to density, arithmetically, which for<br>
some CNTs is at least 135 times better than for steel.<br>
Of particular interest for the field of electronics are<br>
the current rating and the electrical and thermal<br>
conductivities: The current rating is by estimation<br>
1000 times higher than in the case of copper wires,<br>
whereas the thermal conductivity at room temperature is<br>
almost twice as high as that of diamond. Since CNTs may<br>
also be semiconductors, they can be used to manufacture<br>
outstanding transistors which withstand higher voltages<br>
and temperatures - and hence higher clock frequencies -<br>
than silicon transistors; functioning transistors have<br><br>
already been produced from CNTs. Furthermore,	CNTs can<br>
be used to realize nonvolatile memories. CNTs	can also<br>
be used in the field of metrology (e.g.,	scanning<br>
tunneling microscopes) .<br>
On the basis of their mechanical and electrical<br>
properties, carbon nanotubes can also find application<br>
in plastics: As a result, for example, the mechanical<br>
properties of the plastics are greatly improved.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible in this way to produce<br>
electrically conducting plastics.<br>
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are commercially available and<br>
are supplied by numerous manufacturers (e.g., by Bayer<br>
MaterialScience AG, Germany; CNT Co. Ltd., China; Cheap<br>
Tubes Inc., USA; and Nanocyl S.A., Belgium).<br>
Corresponding manufacturing processes are familiar to<br>
the skilled worker. Thus, for example, carbon nanotubes<br>
(CNTs) can be prepared by arc discharge between carbon<br>
electrodes,  for example; by means of laser ablation<br>
("vaporization") starting from graphite; or by<br>
catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons {chemical vapor<br>
deposition, CVD for short).<br>
The properties described above for the carbon nanotubes<br>
(CNTs) and the possible applications which arise from<br>
these properties have awoken great interest. In<br>
particular, for a range of applications, there is a<br>
need for the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to be provided in<br>
a readily manageable form, preferably in the form of<br>
dispersions.<br>
The dispersing of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) poses a great<br>
challenge, since the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are very<br>
difficult to convert into stable dispersions,<br>
especially because the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess<br>
a very high aspect ratio and are present in highly<br>
agglomerated and/or coiled forms.<br><br>
In the prior art, therefore, there has been no lack of<br>
attempts to stably disperse carbon nanotubes (CNTs).<br>
The methods known from the prior art, however, are not<br>
very suitable for generating stable, concentrated<br>
dispersions of carbon nanotubes (CNTs): in the majority<br>
of cases the methods of the prior art do not lead to<br>
storage-stable dispersions, and, moreover, the<br>
concentration of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the prior-<br>
art dispersions is usually extremely small.<br>
Thus, certain prior-art methods are aimed first at<br>
modifying the surface of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to<br>
be dispersed, by means of a costly and inconvenient<br>
prior pretreatment, particularly for the purpose of<br>
making the surface polar in order to facilitate<br>
subsequent dispersing. Methods suitable for modifying<br>
the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are, for example, oxidative<br>
processes, especially chemical pretreatment,<br>
halogenation, or other polarization processes for<br>
modifying the surfaces of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs).<br>
One method of this kind, which provides, for example,<br>
for prior fluorination of the surfaces of the carbon<br>
nanotubes (CNTs) prior to their dispersing, is<br>
described for example in US 6 827 918 B2.<br>
A disadvantage of these methods is the costly and<br>
inconvenient pretreatment, which particularly when<br>
implemented on an industrial scale results in more<br>
difficult implementation of the method, with<br>
significantly higher costs.<br>
Also described in the prior art have been methods which<br>
convert the carbon nanotubes into aqueous dispersions<br>
in the presence of a water-soluble polymer material<br>
(cf., e.g., US 2004/0131859 Al and WO 02/076888 Al) .<br>
These methods, however, have the disadvantage that, on<br>
the one hand, they are not universally employable, but<br>
instead are restricted to aqueous dispersion media,<br>
and,  on  the  other  hand,  that  they  lead  only  to<br><br>
dispersions having relatively low carbon nanotube (CNT)<br>
contents. The prevailing object of the two<br>
aforementioned publications, instead, is the conversion<br>
of the dispersions described therein into a<br>
redispersible powder of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).<br>
The above-described methods of the prior art usually<br>
result in inhomogeneous dispersions, often lacking<br>
long-term stability, of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with<br>
low concentrations or contents of CNTs. Furthermore,<br>
the prior-art dispersions - in comparison to the pure<br>
dispersion medium - exhibit a high to extreme increase<br>
in viscosity, coupled with low particle contents of<br>
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) , of only up to about 1% by<br>
weight.<br>
In relation to industrial implementation, these prior-<br>
art dispersions are associated with a great<br>
disadvantage, and consequently there is an increased<br>
demand for improved dispersions of carbon nanotubes<br>
(CNTs) in various media.<br>
It is an object of the present invention, therefore, to<br>
provide a method of preparing dispersions of carbon<br>
nanotubes (CNTs), the intention being that the<br>
disadvantages outlined above and associated with the<br>
prior art should be at least substantially avoided or<br>
else at least attenuated.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide<br>
dispersions of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) having<br>
properties which are improved in comparison to the<br>
corresponding prior-art dispersions, more particularly<br>
having increased storage stabilities and/or having<br>
higher carbon nanotube (CNT) contents, preferably in<br>
tandem with good manageability, such as effective<br>
fluidity, etc.<br><br>
The applicant has now surprisingly found that the<br>
problem outlined above can be efficiently solved if the<br>
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are dispersed in a continuous<br>
phase, especially in at least one dispersion medium, in<br>
the presence of at least one dispersant (dispersing<br>
agent), with introduction of an energy input which is<br>
sufficient for dispersing.<br>
In an entirely surprising way it has now in fact been<br>
found that, through the combination of a suitable<br>
dispersant (dispersing agent) in interaction with high<br>
energy inputs, especially high shear forces, it is<br>
possible to provide a gentle and inexpensive method of<br>
stably dispersing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in<br>
significantly higher concentrations and in a<br>
multiplicity of dispersion media.<br>
To solve the problem outlined above, therefore, the<br>
present invention proposes a dispersion method as per<br>
claim 1. Further, advantageous properties of the method<br>
of the invention are subject matter of the relevant<br>
dependent method claims.<br>
Further subject matter of the present invention are the<br>
dispersions of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that are<br>
obtainable by the method of the invention, and as are<br>
defined or described in the corresponding claims<br>
directed to the dispersions themselves.<br>
Finally, a further subject of the present invention is<br>
the use of the dispersions of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)<br>
which are obtainable by the method of the invention,<br>
such use being as defined or described in the<br>
corresponding use claims.<br>
The present invention - according to a first aspect of<br>
the present invention - accordingly provides a method<br>
of dispersing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a continuous<br>
phase, especially in at least one dispersion medium,<br><br>
i.e., therefore, a method of preparing dispersions of<br>
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a continuous phase,<br>
especially in at least one dispersion medium, the<br>
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) being dispersed, especially<br>
without prior pretreatment of the carbon nanotubes<br>
(CNTs), in a continuous phase, especially in at least<br>
one dispersion medium, in the presence of at least one<br>
dispersant (dispersing agent), with introduction of an<br>
energy input sufficient for dispersing.<br>
With regard to the concept of the dispersion, as it is<br>
used in the context of the present invention, reference<br>
may be made in particular to DIN 53900 of July 1972,<br>
according to which the concept of the dispersion is a<br>
designation for a system (i.e., disperse system) of two<br>
or more phases, of which one phase is continuous<br>
(namely the dispersion medium) and at least one further<br>
phase is finely divided (namely the dispersed phase or<br>
the dispersoid; in this case the carbon nanotubes). In<br>
the context of the present invention the concept of the<br>
dispersion is designated exclusively in relation to the<br>
designation of suspensions, i.e., dispersions of<br>
insoluble particulate solids in liquids.<br>
The concept of the dispersant - also designated,<br>
synonymously, as dispersing agent, dispersing additive,<br>
wetting agent, etc - as used in the context of the<br>
present invention designates, generally, substances<br>
which facilitate the dispersing of particles in a<br>
dispersion medium, especially by lowering the<br>
interfacial tension between the two components<br>
particles to be dispersed, on the one hand, and<br>
dispersant, on the other hand - and so by inducing<br>
wetting. Consequently there are a multiplicity of<br>
synonymous designations for dispersants (dispersing<br>
agents) in use, examples being dispersing additive,<br>
antisettling agent, wetting agent, detergent,<br>
suspending or dispersing assistant, emulsifier, etc.<br>
The concept of the dispersant should not be confused<br><br>
with the concept of the dispersion medium, the latter<br>
designating the continuous phase of the dispersion<br>
(i.e., the liquid, continuous dispersion medium). In<br>
the context of the present invention the dispersant,<br>
additionally, serves the purpose of stabilizing the<br>
dispersed particles as well (i.e., the carbon<br>
nanotubes) , i.e., of holding them stably in dispersion,<br>
and of avoiding or at least minimizing their<br>
reagglomeration in an efficient way; this in turn leads<br>
to the desired viscosities of the resulting<br>
dispersions, since, in this way, readily manageable,<br>
fluid systems result in practice - even in the case of<br>
high concentrations of the dispersed carbon nanotubes.<br>
Without the use of the dispersant, in contrast, there<br>
would be such an increase in the viscosity of the<br>
resulting dispersions, as a result of unwanted<br>
reagglomeration of the dispersed CNTs, that - at least<br>
at relatively high CNT concentrations - there would in<br>
practice no longer be manageable systems resulting,<br>
since those systems would have too high a viscosity or<br>
too low a fluidity.<br>
For further details relating to the terms "dispersoid",<br>
"dispersing", "dispersant", "disperse systems", and<br>
"dispersion", reference may be made, for example, to<br>
Rompp Chemielexikon, 10th edition, Georg Thieme Verlag,<br>
Stuttgart/New York, Volume 2, 1997, pages 1014/1015,<br>
and also to the literature referred to therein, the<br>
entire disclosure content of which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
A particular feature of the method of the invention is<br>
to be seen in the fact that, in accordance with the<br>
invention, the dispersing operation takes place with<br>
sufficient input of energy (e.g., input of shearing<br>
energy) ; on the one hand the energy introduced must be<br>
sufficient to provide the energy needed for dispersing,<br>
especially to disrupt the agglomerates, conglomerates,<br>
coils, etc formed by the carbon nanotubes (CNTs), but<br><br>
on the other hand it must not exceed a certain level<br>
above which destruction of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs)<br>
begins - and this must be the case in the presence of a<br>
suitable dispersant (dispersing agent) which is capable<br>
of stabilizing the individual carbon nanotubes (CNTs)<br>
and of preventing reagglomeration occurring again, and<br>
also of facilitating the subseguent dispersing and in<br>
that way stabilizing the resultant dispersions.<br>
With the method of the invention it is possible in a<br>
surprising way to obtain relatively high concentrations<br>
of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the resultant<br>
dispersions. In particular the method of the invention<br>
can be used to prepare dispersions having solids<br>
contents, in terms of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), of 5% by<br>
weight or more, based on the resultant dispersions. In<br>
general the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are dispersed in<br>
amounts of 1 x 10-5% to 30%, in particular 1 x 10-4% to<br>
20%, preferably 1 x 10-3% to 10%, more preferably<br>
1 x 10-2% to 7.5%, very preferably 1 x lO-1 to 5%, by<br>
weight, based on the resultant dispersions, in the<br>
continuous phase.<br>
In order to allow economically rational application,<br>
the method of the invention ought to be implemented or<br>
concluded within a certain, or relatively short, period<br>
of time, which in turn requires a particular energy<br>
input per unit time. Generally speaking, the method of<br>
the invention, or the dispersing operation, is carried<br>
out within a period of 0.01 to 30 minutes, especially<br>
0.1 to 20 minutes, preferably 0.2 to 15 minutes, more<br>
preferably 0.5 to 10 minutes, very preferably 0.5 to 5<br>
minutes. Nevertheless, owing to a particular case, or<br>
relative to the application, it may be necessary to<br>
deviate from the times specified above, without<br>
departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
As outlined above, it is necessary, in order to carry<br>
out  the  dispersing  operation,  for  there  to  be  a<br><br>
sufficient input of energy into the dispersion medium,<br>
which on the one hand must be sufficient to ensure<br>
reliable dispersing of a carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and<br>
on the other hand must not be so high that there is<br>
destruction of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or of their<br>
structures.<br>
The provision of the required energy input is<br>
accomplished preferably by means of ultrasound<br>
treatment. Nevertheless, other possibilities can also<br>
be realized in the context of the present invention, an<br>
example being the application of high-pressure nozzles,<br>
although the treatment by means of ultrasound is<br>
preferred in accordance with the invention.<br>
In general, the amount of energy introduced can vary<br>
within wide ranges. In particular the amount of energy<br>
introduced, calculated as energy introduced per unit<br>
quantity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to be dispersed, is<br>
5000 to 500 000 kJ/kg, especially 10 000 to<br>
250 000 kJ/kg, preferably 15 000 to 100 000 kJ/kg, more<br>
preferably 25 000 to 50 000 kJ/kg. Nevertheless,<br>
relative to the application or as a result of a<br>
specific case, it may be necessary to deviate from the<br>
aforementioned figures, without departing the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Typically the dispersing operation proper is preceded<br>
by a method step in which the carbon nanotubes (CNTs)<br>
for subsequent dispersion are contacted with the<br>
continuous phase, especially with the dispersion<br>
medium, and with the dispersant (dispersing agent), and<br>
also, where appropriate, with further constituents or<br>
ingredients of the dispersion, and these components are<br>
homogenized with one another, especially with<br>
corresponding input of energy, preferably with<br>
stirring. The energy input required for this purpose,<br>
however, is smaller than for the dispersing operation<br>
as  such,  and  so  a  customary  stirring  or  mixing<br><br>
operation is sufficient for this purpose.<br>
In general, the method of the invention is carried out<br>
at temperatures below the boiling temperature of the<br>
continuous phase, especially of the dispersion medium.<br>
Preferably the method of the invention is carried out<br>
at temperatures in the range from 10 to 100°C,<br>
preferably 15 to 70°C. In this case it may where<br>
appropriate be necessary to carry out the dispersing<br>
operation with cooling, since the energy input results<br>
in an increase in the temperature of the resultant<br>
dispersion.<br>
As outlined above, an advantage of the present<br>
invention is to be seen in the fact that the dispersing<br>
operation is carried out without prior pretreatment of<br>
the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to be dispersed, especially<br>
without prior oxidation, chemical treatment (e.g., with<br>
oxidizing agents, such as nitric acid, ozone, etc) ,<br>
thermal treatment, polarization, halogenation or the<br>
like.<br>
In the context of the method of the invention it is<br>
possible to use virtually any desired carbon nanotubes<br>
(CNTs), of the kind preparable by processes known from<br>
the prior art or else available as commercial products<br>
(e.g., from Bayer MaterialScience AG, Leverkusen).<br>
The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) used in accordance with the<br>
invention may be, for example, single-wall carbon<br>
nanotubes (SWCNTs or SWNTs) or multiwall carbon<br>
nanotubes (MWCNTs or MWNTs), especially 2- to 30-wall,<br>
preferably 3- to 15-wall, carbon nanotubes.<br>
The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) used in accordance with the<br>
invention may have average internal diameters of 0.4 to<br>
50 nm, especially 1 to 10 nm, preferably 2 to 6 nm,<br>
and/or average external diameters of 1 to 60 nm,<br>
especially 5 to 30 nm, preferably 10 to 20 nm. The<br><br>
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) used in accordance with the<br>
invention may have average lengths of 0.01 to 1000 μm,<br>
especially 0.1 to 500 [μm, preferably 0.5 to 200 μm,<br>
more preferably 1 to 100 [m.<br>
Furthermore, the carbon  nanotubes (CNTs) used in<br>
accordance with the invention may have a tensile<br>
strength per carbon nanotube of at least 1 GPa,<br>
especially at least 5 GPa, preferably at least 10 GPa,<br>
and/or an elasticity modulus per carbon nanotube of at<br>
least 0.1 TPa, especially at least 0.5 TPa, preferably<br>
at least 1 TPa, and/or a thermal conductivity of at<br>
least 500 W/mK, especially at least 1000 W/mK,<br>
preferably at least 2000 W/mK, and/or an electrical<br>
conductivity of at least 103 S/cm, especially at least<br>
0.5 x 104 S/cm, preferably at least 104 S/cm.<br>
Typically employed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have a bulk<br>
density in the range from 0.01 to 0.3 g/cm3, especially<br>
0.02 to 0.2 g/cm3, preferably 0.1 to 0.2 g/cm3, and are<br>
present in the form of agglomerates or conglomerates of<br>
a multiplicity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), especially<br>
in highly coiled form.<br>
Inventively suitable carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are<br>
available commercially, as for example from Bayer<br>
MaterialScience AG, Leverkusen, an example being the<br>
product series Baytubes® (e.g., Baytubes® C 150 P).<br>
As far as the continuous phase or dispersion medium is<br>
concerned, it is possible in the context of the present<br>
invention, in principle, to employ aqueous-based,<br>
organic-based or aqueous-organic-based dispersion<br>
media, preference being given to using organic<br>
dispersion media. Typically the continuous phase used<br>
is a dispersion medium which is present in the liquid<br>
aggregate state under dispersing conditions, especially<br>
under atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa) and in a<br>
temperature range from 10 to 100°C, preferably 15 to<br><br>
70°C.<br>
In an inventively preferred way the dispersion medium<br>
used as the continuous phase is a dispersion medium<br>
which is  selected from the group of  (i)  alcohols,<br>
especially   straight-chain,   branched   or   cyclic,<br>
monohydric or polyhydric alcohols,  such as methanol,<br>
ethanol,  butanol,  ethylhexanol,  decanol,  isotridecyl<br>
alcohol,  benzyl  alcohol,  propargyl  alcohol,  oleyl<br>
alcohol,   linoleyl   alcohol,   oxo-process   alcohols,<br>
neopentyl alcohol,  cyclohexanol,  fatty alcohols,  and<br>
diols  and  polyols,  such  as  glycols;   (ii)  ether<br>
alcohols,   such   as   2-methoxyethanol,   monophenyl<br>
diglycol, phenylethanol, ethylene glycol, and propylene<br>
glycol;  (iii)  hydrocarbons,  such as toluene, xylene,<br>
and aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic benzine fractions,<br>
chlorinated  hydrocarbons,   such  as  chloroform  and<br>
trichloroethane;  (iv)  ethers,  especially cyclic  and<br>
acyclic ethers, such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, and<br>
polyalkylene  glycol  dialkyl  ethers;  (v)  carboxylic<br>
esters, especially monocarboxylic esters, such as ethyl<br>
acetate  and  butyl  acetate;  and  dicarboxylic  or<br>
polycarboxylic esters, such as dialkyl esters of C2 to<br>
C4 dicarboxylic acids  ("Dibasic Esters");  (vi)  ether<br>
esters,   especially  alkylglycol   esters,   such   as<br>
ethylglycol acetate and methoxypropyl acetate;  (vii)<br>
lactones,  such as butyrolactone;  (viii) plasticizers,<br>
especially phthalates; (ix) aldehydes and ketones, such<br>
as methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, and acetone;<br>
(x) acid    amides,    such    as    dimethylformamide;<br>
(xi) N-methylpyrrolidone;  and  also  mixtures  of  the<br>
aforementioned dispersion media.<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible in principle to employ<br>
ionic liquids or what are known as supercritical fluids<br>
as a dispersion medium. Water as well is a suitable<br>
dispersion medium in the context of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
As far as the inventively used dispersant is concerned,<br>
it  is  more  particularly  a  polymeric  dispersant,<br>
especially a polymeric dispersant based on a functional<br>
polymer, preferably having a number-average molecular<br>
mass  of  at  least  500 g/mol,  preferably  at  least<br>
1000 g/mol, more preferably at least 2000 g/mol.  In<br>
particular  the  inventively  used  dispersant  may  be<br>
selected from the group of polymers and copolymers<br>
having functional groups and/or groups with pigment<br>
affinity,   alkylammonium   salts   of   polymers   and<br>
copolymers,  polymers  and  copolymers  having  acidic<br>
groups, comb copolymers and block copolymers, such as<br>
block copolymers having groups with pigment affinity,<br>
especially  basic   groups   with  pigment   affinity,<br>
optionally   modified   acrylate   block   copolymers,<br>
optionally modified polyurethanes, optionally modified<br>
and/or   salified   polyamines,   phosphoric   esters,<br>
ethoxylates, polymers and copolymers having fatty acid<br>
radicals,  optionally modified polyacrylates,  such as<br>
transesterified  polyacrylates,   optionally  modified<br>
polyesters,   such   as   acid-functional   polyesters,<br>
polyphosphates, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Furthermore it is possible in principle, as dispersants<br>
suitable in accordance with the invention, to use all<br>
of the dispersants, surfactants, wetting agents, etc,<br>
that are known for that purpose.<br>
In an inventively preferred way the compounds selected<br>
as dispersants are especially those compounds of the<br>

As far as the method of the invention is concerned, it<br>
can in principle be carried out in continuous operation<br>
or in discontinuous operation, and this can be done in<br>
a relatively small amount of time. On account of its<br>
low level of complexity, the method of the invention<br>
can be readily employed industrially, can be carried<br>
out flexibly and economically, and can be configured<br>
adaptably up to production on the tonne scale.<br>
In principle the method of the invention can be<br>
employed for any of a very wide variety of dispersion<br>
media, of dispersants or dispersing agents, and of<br>
carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and can be readily combined<br>
with further processes or process steps.<br>
As outlined at the outset, the dispersing of CNTs poses<br>
a great challenge, because the CNTs possess a very<br>
large aspect ratio and are present in a highly coiled<br>
form: for instance, the diameters range, for example,<br>
from 3 to 25 nm, but the lengths range, for example, up<br>
to about 10 mm. On account of the high degree of<br>
coiling, very high energy inputs or shearing forces are<br>
necessary in order to separate the CNTs. Where<br>
uncoiling is accomplished only by means of high energy<br>
input, without simultaneous use of suitable<br>
dispersants, the CNTs are only size-reduced, and not<br>
sufficiently stabilized, and so the resulting<br>
dispersions are inhomogeneous and lack long-term<br>
stability. The use of dispersants is aimed on the one<br>
hand at wetting the CNTs, in order to ensure easier and<br>
more  gentle  uncoiling,  and  on  the  other  hand  at<br><br>
stabilizing the resulting separated CNTs by coating<br>
with the dispersant, with the consequence that, with<br>
the method of the invention, stable homogeneous<br>
dispersions are obtained. Ideally the dispersions<br>
exhibit only a slight increase in viscosity, and high<br>
activity of the CNTs.<br>
In contrast, the methods described in the prior art<br>
usually result in inhomogeneous dispersions which lack<br>
long-term stability. Furthermore, the prior-art<br>
dispersions exhibit a high increase in viscosity in<br>
tandem with low particle contents of only about 1% at<br>
most.<br>
Surprisingly it has now been found that, in the context<br>
of the method of the invention, by combining suitable<br>
dispersants with high energy inputs or shearing forces,<br>
a gentle and cost-effective method is provided for<br>
stably dispersing CNTs in any of a very wide variety of<br>
media and at significantly higher concentrations.<br>
The method of the invention leads to dispersions having<br>
high carbon nanotube (CNT) contents or with high<br>
degrees of filling (above 5% by weight, for example,<br>
based on the resultant dispersions), and it<br>
accomplishes this at the same time as low viscosities<br>
and hence ready manageability.<br>
Furthermore, the dispersions obtainable by the method<br>
of the invention exhibit high storage stabilities.<br>
Accordingly the present invention - according to a<br>
second aspect of the present invention - provides<br>
dispersions of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a continuous<br>
phase, especially in at least one dispersion medium,<br>
which are obtainable by the method of the invention as<br>
outlined above.<br><br>
For further relevant details concerning the dispersions<br>
of the invention, reference may be made to the<br>
corresponding claims directed to the dispersions<br>
themselves.<br>
The dispersions according to the present invention that<br>
are obtainable by the method of the invention have an<br>
extraordinary stability, especially storage stability;<br>
in particular the dispersions of the invention are<br>
storage-stable over at least a week, preferably at<br>
least a month, more preferably at least three months,<br>
very preferably at least six months. As outlined above,<br>
the dispersions of the invention are, furthermore,<br>
fluid at room temperature and in this way are readily<br>
manageable. The dispersions prepared in accordance with<br>
the invention exhibit a newtonian or at most<br>
thixotropic and/or structurally viscous behavior,<br>
preferably a newtonian behavior.<br>
The dispersions obtainable in accordance with the<br>
invention are suitable for a multiplicity of<br>
applications. Further provided by the present invention<br>
- in accordance with a third aspect of the present<br>
invention - is, accordingly, the inventive use of the<br>
dispersions obtainable by the method of the invention,<br>
as is defined in the corresponding use claims.<br>
Thus, for example, the dispersions of the invention are<br>
suitable for application in the field of electronics,<br>
as for example in the field of computer engineering and<br>
the computer industry, semiconductor engineering and<br>
the semiconductor industry, and metrology and the<br>
metrological industry, for the purpose, for example, of<br>
producing conducting or semiconducting structures,<br>
nanoelectric structures and devices, transistors,<br>
nonvolatile memories, displays and screens and their<br>
components, and also metrological and computer parts<br>
and components, such as circuits, diodes, and the like,<br>
etc.<br><br>
Additionally the dispersions of the invention are<br>
suitable for application or incorporation in plastics<br>
and polymeric compositions, coatings, paints, inks,<br>
composite materials, and the like.<br>
By way of example the dispersions of the invention can<br>
be used in order to increase the electrical<br>
conductivity and/or to improve the mechanical<br>
properties, especially the strength, preferably in<br>
relation to the aforementioned materials (i.e.,<br>
plastics and polymeric compositions, coatings, paints,<br>
inks, composite materials, etc) . Thus, for example, the<br>
dispersions of the invention are suitable as<br>
reinforcing materials in the aforementioned materials.<br>
Furthermore, the dispersions prepared in accordance<br>
with the invention are suitable for producing bundles,<br>
fibers, mats, and other coherent structures of carbon<br>
nanotubes (CNTs) (e.g., after removal of the dispersion<br>
medium).<br>
Moreover, the dispersions of the invention are suitable<br>
for application in the field of aerospace technology.<br>
A further field for application of the dispersions of<br>
the invention is the field of cooling technology,<br>
especially in relation to the production of heat sinks<br>
for any of a very wide variety of applications (e.g.,<br>
for GSM base stations, as CPU coolers, etc) .<br>
Finally the dispersions of the invention can also be<br>
used for shielding from electrical and/or<br>
electromagnetic radiation, especially in the<br>
aforementioned materials (i.e., plastics and polymeric<br>
compositions, coatings, paints, inks, composite<br>
materials, etc).<br><br>
Further embodiments, modifications, and variations of<br>
the present invention are readily evident and<br>
realizable for the skilled worker on reading the<br>
description, without departing the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention is illustrated by reference to<br>
the examples which follow, but which are not intended<br>
to restrict the present invention.<br>
Examples:<br>
Examples A:<br>
The particular advantages of the invention are<br>
described below, using as an example the dispersing of<br>
CNTs in PMA (propylene glycol monomethyl ether or<br>
methoxypropyl acetate) as dispersion medium, using<br>
different dispersants and an ultrasound dispersing<br>
unit.<br>
First of all various comparative experiments with and<br>
without dispersants, with only a Dispermat, were<br>
carried out, but in all cases the result was<br>
disappointing: The dispersions were very inhomogeneous<br>
and underwent complete sedimentation after a time of<br>
just a few hours to a day.<br>
Similar comparative experiments with the ultrasonic<br>
transducer, in contrast, showed better outcomes: Thus a<br>
0.1% dispersion of CNTs without dispersant undergoes<br>
only slight sedimentation, but is still very<br>
inhomogeneous. In this case the agglomerates are in<br>
fact disrupted, but the CNTs are damaged to a high<br>
degree and are not sufficiently stabilized. A<br>
dispersion prepared in this way is not suitable for<br>
industrial use. The addition of a dispersant, though,<br>
increases the result considerably.<br><br>
Thus, if only ultrasound or only dispersant is used,<br>
the experiments result in unstable and inhomogeneous<br>
dispersions or suspensions with significant<br>
sedimentation behavior.<br>
In inventive experiments, different dispersants were<br>
employed in different quantities, in combination with<br>
the input of ultrasound, leading to the desired<br>
outcomes.<br><br>
As a first experimental series, 1% dispersions of<br>
MWCNTs in methoxypropyl acetate (PMA) were prepared<br>
with use of ultrasound (table 2) . The results were<br>
evaluated on the basis of the visual impression<br>
directly after the dispersing operation; the<br>
sedimentation behavior; and the viscosity. The<br>
dispersions are prepared in the same way as described<br>
in example B below.<br><br><br>
In order to allow better assessment of the<br>
sedimentation behavior in particular, a second step saw<br>
more highly dilute dispersions being prepared with<br>
these dispersants (table 3) . At a concentration of<br>
0.1%, the dispersion stabilized with DISP-I showed the<br>
best result.<br><br><br>
In the course of the experiments it became apparent,<br>
surprisingly, that the combination of DISP-I and<br>
ultrasound produced very good results. The results were<br>
so good that the system could also be increased to a 5%<br>
CNT content, and the dispersions exhibited outstanding<br>
properties and excellent storage stabilities. A further<br>
increase to 10% or more CNT content was realized as<br>
well.<br>
Additionally it was observed that the method of the<br>
invention - irrespective of the mode of preparation of<br>
the CNTs - can be realized successfully, in other words<br>
that the method of the invention is suitable for use<br>
universally for CNTs and does not require prior surface<br>
modification of the CNTs (in situ or post-synthesis),<br>
thereby allowing massive cost savings.<br>
This results in immense opportunities for the<br>
industrial use of CNTs in numerous applications, since<br>
the dispersions have the following advantages:<br><br>
high degrees of filling, or more than 5% by weight<br>
CNTs<br>
homogeneous dispersions with long-term stability<br>
gentle dispersion method  (gentle uncoiling of the<br>
CNTs)<br>
can  be  used  universally  for  all  commercially<br>
available CNTs<br>
cost-effective dispersing method, equally upscalable<br>
and suitable for both batch and continuous operation<br>
can be combined with further process steps<br>
low viscosities realizable if needed<br>
addition   of   further   functionalized   additives<br>
possible<br>
functionalization of the dispersant possible.<br>
In further experiments it was shown that the method of<br>
the invention can also be transposed to other solvents.<br>
When water or extremely nonpolar media are employed, of<br>
course, the requirements concerning the functional<br>
groups of the dispersant are different.<br>
Furthermore, the dispersions prepared in accordance<br>
with the invention can be processed further, for<br>
orientation of the CNTs in the dispersion medium<br>
matrix, for example. Hence it is possible to carry out<br>
parallel alignment of CNTs in an electrical field. For<br>
this purpose, however, the CNTs must be present in<br>
individualized and homogenously dispersed form, ideally<br>
at a high concentration. This is now ensured for the<br>
first time through the method of the invention. A<br>
subsequent parallel orientation is therefore possible,<br>
and for many applications is essential.<br>
A corresponding experimental system is designed as<br>
follows: In a tank, a suspension of the agglomerated<br>
CNTs in the desired dispersion medium is introduced,<br>
together with the dispersant, and is then pumped in a<br>
circuit through a flow cell, in which the dispersing<br>
operation  takes  place  by means  of  ultrasound.  The<br><br>
resulting dispersion can then either be recycled to the<br>
tank and dispersed in the circuit until the desired<br>
degree of dispersion has been achieved (batch<br>
operation) , or can be pumped into a further flow cell<br>
with ultrasound dispersing unit (continuous operation).<br>
This may then be followed by mixing, as for example<br>
with a resin (or a paint, a coating liquid, etc) , and<br>
subsequent passage through an electrical field provides<br>
for parallel alignment of the CNTs. The parallel<br>
alignment may alternatively take place at a later point<br>
in time. The prerequisite is merely a stable dispersion<br>
of individualized CNTs, something which is ensured by<br>
the method of the invention.<br>
Examples B:<br>
Preparation of a 1.0% dispersion of CNTs (Baytubes®,<br>
e.g., Baytubes® C 150 P) in methoxypropyl acetate (PMA)<br>
with 100% of DISP-I<br>
A 350 ml PE beaker is charged with 196 g of PMA and 2 g<br>
of DISP-I, and this initial charge is homogenized using<br>
a Dispermat at 1000 rpm with a toothed disc (d = 40<br>
mm) . 2 g of CNTs are added to the mixture, and the PE<br>
vessel is placed into a stainless steel double-wall<br>
vessel, cooled to 5°C, with water as the cooling<br>
medium. Dispersing takes place using an ultrasonotrode<br>
(d = 38 mm) , which is immersed to about 2 to 3 cm in<br>
the medium. With a power of approximately (500 ± 20) W,<br>
the suspension is dispersed for 1.5 to 2 min, in such a<br>
way that the temperature remains below 70°C. The result<br>
is a homogeneous, storage-stable, black dispersion of<br>
low viscosity.<br>
Viscosities<br>
Viscosity as a function of the degree of CNT filling<br>
To illustrate the increase in viscosity with increasing<br>
degree of CNT filling,  the viscosities of different<br>
dispersions in PMA, with CNT contents in the range from<br><br>
0.1% to 5%, were measured (fig. 1 and fig. 2). As can<br>
be seen, the viscosity rises exponentially with the<br>
concentration, but even at concentrations above 3% is<br>
still within a manageable range. Fig. 1 shows the<br>
viscosities of PMA dispersions with different CNT<br>
contents (0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0%, and 5.0%;<br>
curves considered from bottom to top), with a constant<br>
quantity of dispersant, of 200% by weight in relation<br>
to CNTs, and fig. 2 is a corresponding logarithmic plot<br>
of the viscosities of PMA dispersions having different<br>
CNT contents against the concentration of the CNTs.<br>
Viscosity as a function of the fraction of dispersant<br>
In view of the large surface area of the CNTs and their<br>
urge to form coils, a high dispersant fraction must be<br>
used. Consequently dispersant concentrations of 50% to<br>
200% by weight (based on CNTs) were used. The measure<br>
used for the dispersing is again the viscosity. From<br>
fig. 3 it is evident that, from a dispersant<br>
concentration of 150%, the viscosity remains still at a<br>
low level. Significantly lower concentrations lead to<br>
higher viscosities. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the<br>
viscosities of 1% dispersions of CNTs in PMA with<br>
different amounts of DISP-I (50%, 100%, 150%, and 200%,<br>
by weight, based on CNTs; curves considered from top to<br>
bottom).<br>
Comparison of different CNTs<br>
As is evident from fig. 4, the method of the invention<br>
for dispersing CNTs can be applied almost universally<br>
to a very wide variety of different kinds of CNTs.<br>
Fig. 4 shows by way of example the viscosities of 0.1%<br>
(bottom curves) and 1% (top curves) dispersions of CNTs<br>
in PMA, on the one hand for Baytubes® C 150 P from<br>
Bayer MaterialScience AG and on the other hand for CNTs<br>
from CNT Co., Ltd.) . It is clearly apparent that the<br>
viscosities are virtually identical, irrespective of<br>
the manufacturer from which the CNTs originate.<br><br>
Summary of the results<br>
The present results were determined under measuring<br>
conditions which "circumvent" the "wall gliding" of the<br>
samples and allow a comparison of the low-concentration<br>
and high-concentration CNT suspensions. The resulting<br>
measurements can admittedly not be considered to be<br>
absolute values, but do serve as a basis for an<br>
empirical comparison of the samples.<br>
The 0.1% and 1.0% unstabilized suspensions, without<br>
dispersant, of Baytubes® in PMA cannot be measured,<br>
owing to the sedimentation behavior.<br>
Through the method of the invention it is possible to<br>
prepare fluid pastes having a CNT content of more than<br>
5% by weight.<br>
Of the wetting agents tested, DISP-I showed itself to<br>
be the most effective in terms of the viscosity level.<br>
The viscosity rises exponentially with the increase in<br>
the solids content of the CNTs and with the same<br>
application of dispersant (200% by weight of DISP-I).<br>
Measuring conditions<br>
ThermoHaake  RS300  with  UTCE/C  electrical  thermal<br>
conditioning unit<br>
Measurement system: 35 mm 1° cone/plate system<br>
Experimental mode: rotation in CSR mode {Controlled<br>
Shear Rate)<br>
All of the samples exhibit a strongly pronounced yield<br>
point. The visually sensorial testing, moreover,<br>
reflected thixotropic or structurally viscous behavior<br>
on the part of the samples.<br><br>
Optical microscopy images<br>
In order to obtain an impression of the degree of<br>
agglomeration and the quality of the dispersion,<br>
micrographs were produced of the different dispersions.<br>
Pictured below is a selection of samples with<br>
particularly good and particularly poor dispersion.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a ten-times magnification of a 0.1%<br>
dispersion of CNTs in PMA after ultrasound treatment<br>
without dispersant (very poor dispersion, large<br>
agglomerates).<br>
Fig. 6 shows a ten-times magnification of a 0.1%<br>
dispersion of CNTs in PMA after ultrasound treatment in<br>
the presence of 50% dispersant (DISP-II) (good and<br>
stable dispersion, few agglomerates, significantly<br>
homogeneous) .<br>
Fig. 7 shows a ten-times magnification of a 0.1%<br>
dispersion of CNTs in PMA after ultrasound treatment in<br>
the presence of 100% dispersant (DISP-I) (very good and<br>
very homogeneous dispersion, no large agglomerates any<br>
more, stable).<br>
Stabilities<br>
The dispersions prepared in accordance with the<br>
invention have now been stable at room temperature for<br>
about 4 months, and are not exhibiting any<br>
sedimentation of the CNTs. Even dispersions with CNT<br>
contents of 3% or more are indeed thixotropic but show<br>
no sedimentation of the CNTs over a relatively long<br>
time period. Dispersions prepared in other ways, in<br>
contrast, frequently exhibit complete phase separation<br>
after just hours.<br><br>
