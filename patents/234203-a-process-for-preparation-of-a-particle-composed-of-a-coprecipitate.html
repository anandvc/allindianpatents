				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> The invention relates to a process for preparation of a particle composed of a coprecipitate and to the pharmaceutical forms comprising these particles.<br>
The preparation of oral medicaments is restricted with increasingly complex synthetic molecules often exhibiting physicochemical characteristics unfavorable to the absorption of the molecule in the gastrointestinal tract and in particular a very low solubility in aqueous media.<br>
This is often reflected by a very low bioavailability of these molecules and the need to administer high doses of active substance to the patients in order to achieve the effective concentration.<br>
This is all the more detrimental when the effective concentration to be achieved is high, when the number of tablets or gelatin capsules to be taken at one time is high or when the number of times per day they have to be taken is more frequent.<br>
The preparation of solid dispersions is one of the methods which make it possible to substantially improve the solubility of the active principles and consequently their bioavailability.<br>
The solid dispersions are generally obtained according to two methods, on the one hand by evaporating a solution comprising the active substance and the inert carrier and, on the other hand, by melting the two above compounds and then solidifying.<br><br>
In the first case, the product is a coprecipitate; in the second, case, it is a comelt.<br>
A first difficulty is that of obtaining particles having the fastest possible rate of dissolution and the highest possible dissolved fraction, in order to ensure satisfactory bioavailability of the molecule.<br>
A second difficulty is that of obtaining particles having a narrow particle size distribution and exhibiting a size compatible with putting into a form intended for oral administration, while retaining a high content of active substance.<br>
A third difficulty is that of obtaining a formulation which is stable over time under unfavorable temperature and humidity conditions, such as those used in stability studies, for example 30°C/60% RH (relative humidity) or 40°C/75% RH.<br>
The solid dispersions are generally composed of an active substance dispersed in the molecular state in a hydrophilic agent, for example a polymer.<br>
International application WO 97/04749 has as subject matter  a  process  for  the  preparation  of  solid dispersions in which the active substance(s) is (are) dissolved in an organic solvent additionally comprising a very hydrophilic cyclic amide and advantageously a surface-active  agent,  the  organic  solution  thus obtained  subsequently being  evaporated  to  dryness, followed by milling and sieving. The cyclic amide is a polyvinylpyrrolidone having a molecular weight varying from 10 000 to 50 000.<br>
Application EP 1 103 252 discloses pharmaceutical compositions comprising particles having a core covered with a single layer including an antifungal active<br><br>
principle, such as itraconazole, said layer being obtained by spraying a solution comprising the active principle, a hydrophilic polymer and a nonionic surfactant. These compositions, obtained by conventional techniques, improve the solubility of the active principle.<br>
In extreme cases, the preparation of a solid dispersion is not in itself sufficient to significantly improve the bioavailability.<br>
The Applicant Company has shown that it is entirely possible to substantially improve the bioavailability of active substances which are virtually insoluble in water and to increase the rate of dissolution thereof and the fraction thereof dissolved in vitro or in vivo by preparing a particle composed of a coprecipitate applied as a layer around a neutral hydrophilic carrier and comprising at least one active substance, one surface-active agent and one hydrophilic polymer.<br>
The layer formed around the carrier is a solid dispersion in the form of a coprecipitate which is readily soluble in water or physiological media, for example- the gastric fluid.<br>
Furthermore, the Applicant Company has shown that it is entirely possible to substantially improve the problems of agglomeration of particles encountered in the cases of spraying large amounts of coating solutions by milling the particles not only at the end of the spraying stage but during this stage.<br>
The reduction in size resulting from the milling then makes it possible to continue the spraying over smaller particles less liable to agglomerate with one another than particles exhibiting uniform growth during a single spraying stage.<br><br>
The coprecipitate is obtained by spraying an organic solution over a neutral hydrophilic carrier, said solution comprising at least one active substance, one surface-active agent and one hydrophilic polymer, said spraying being characterized in that the spraying of the whole of the solution is carried out in at least two separate stages, each of these stages being followed systematically by a stage of milling the product obtained on conclusion of the preceding stage.<br>
The process for the preparation of the particles advantageously comprises the following stages:<br>
a)	preparing  an  organic  solution  comprising  the<br>
active substance, the hydrophilic polymer and the<br>
surface-active agent,<br>
b)	spraying a portion of the solution obtained in a)<br>
over the neutral hydrophilic carriers,<br>
c)	milling the particles obtained in stage b),<br>
d)	spraying  the  remaining  amount  of  the  organic<br>
solution over the particles milled in stage c) ,<br>
and<br>
e)	final milling of the particles obtained in stage<br>
 The spraying/milling sequence (stages b to d) can be repeated one or more times according to the volume of solution to be sprayed and the kinetics of growth of the particles during the spraying stage.<br>
The whole of the organic solution can be prepared all at once; however, in order to avoid excessively great evaporation of the organic solvents, it is preferable to prepare each fraction of the solution immediately before the spraying stage.<br><br>
The spraying of the organic solution can be carried out in a coating pan, in a perforated pan coater or in a fluidized bed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process in accordance with the invention, all the spraying stages are carried out in a fluidized bed equipped with an explosion-suppressing device.<br>
The fluidized bed is equipped with a spray nozzle, the position and the orientation of which for spraying can be chosen.<br>
This choice makes it possible to control the kinetics of growth of the particles and to prevent sticking phenomena related to the nature of the active substance, to the qualitative and quantitative composition of the coating solution sprayed and to the various processing parameters (for example, the temperature, the air pressure and the spraying throughput).<br>
The particles are usually dried after the spraying of the organic solution.<br>
The drying can be carried out on trays or directly in the equipment used for the spraying stage.<br>
The drying can be carried out either immediately after the spraying of the organic solution and before the milling or immediately after the milling of the particles.<br>
The milling can be carried out on any type of device intended for this purpose, which can be a mill of oscillating type or a mill equipped with pins.<br><br>
The rotary mill of Fitzmill type or the oscillating mill of Frewitt type is equipped with a rotor which forces the particles through a screen with graded openings.<br>
The mill of Forplex type is equipped with pins against which the particles are hurled at high speed.<br>
The mill used between each spraying stage can be different from that used for the final milling.<br>
The process of the invention is particularly suitable for active substances having very little solubility in water, that is to say active substances which are partially soluble in 1000 parts of water or more than 1000 parts of water, preferably for active substances which are virtually insoluble in water, that is to say those which are partially soluble in 10 000 parts of water or more than 10 000 parts of water.<br>
The active substance or substances can be chosen from any   family   of   compounds,   for   example   from gastrointestinal sedatives, antacids, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, coronary vasodilators, peripheral and cerebral  vasodilators,  anti-infectives,  antibiotics, antivirals,  antiparasitics,  anticancers,  anxiolytics, neuroleptics, stimulants of the central nervous system, antidepressants,    antihistaminics,    antidiarrheals, laxatives, nutritional supplements, immunodepressants, hypocholesterolemics,   •    hormones,        enzymes, antispasmodics,    antianginals,    medicaments   which influence the heart rate,  medicaments used in the treatment  of  arterial  hypertension,  antimigraines, medicaments    which    influence    blood    clotting, antiepileptics, muscle relaxants, medicaments used in the treatment of diabetes,  medicaments used in the treatment   of   thyroid   dysfunctions,   diuretics, anorectics, antiasthmatics, expectorants, antitussives,<br><br>

The active substances can be provided in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or any polymorphic form (racemic, enantiomeric, and the like). The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" is understood to mean the derivatives of the compounds described in which the pharmaceutically active base compound is converted to its salt with a base or acid, examples of pharmaceutically active salts comprising in particular organic or inorganic acid salts of basic residues, such as amines, or alkali metal derivatives or organic salts of acidic residues, such as carboxylic acids, and the like.<br>
The active substance is present in the particle in a proportion which can vary between 1 and 60% by weight.<br>
The inert hydrophilic carrier can be composed of any chemically and pharmaceutically inert • excipient existing in the crystalline or amorphous particulate form, for example derivatives of sugars, such as lactose, preferably extra fine lactose (EFK), sucrose or hydrolyzed starch (maltodextrins); celluloses or mixtures, such as sucrose and starch, or cellulose-based mixtures can also be used for the preparation of inert spherical carriers.<br>
The inert hydrophilic carrier is present in a proportion which can range up to 95% by weight.<br>
The unit particle size of the inert hydrophilic carrier can be between 50 and 500 urn, preferably between 90 and 200 <br>

The polyethylene glycol can be chosen from polymers with a molecular weight of between 1000 and 20 000.<br>

The surface-active agent can be chosen from cationic, anionic, nonionic or amphoteric agents, alone or as a mixture.<br>
The surface-active agent can be chosen, for example, from compounds  such as  sodium  lauryl  sulfate,  the<br>

It results from the process of the invention that, if the carrier over which the solution comprising at least one active substance, one surface-active agent and one hydrophilic polymer is sprayed is, in the first stage, entirely devoid of any active substance, the carrier resulting from the first milling over which the same solution is sprayed is composed both of the neutral hydrophilic carrier and of the coprecipitate comprising at least one active substance, one surface-active agent and one hydrophilic polymer.<br>
The content of active principle of the carrier used for applying the solution comprising at least one active substance, one surface-active agent and one hydrophilic polymer thus increases after each spraying/milling cycle.<br>

magnesium stearate, or of a liquid, for example liquid paraffin.<br>
The amounts of lubricant used in the internal and/or external phase are adjusted with care so as to prevent an excess from detrimentally affecting the cohesion of the powder bed during the tableting.<br>
The antistatic agent can be chosen from the group consisting of micronized talc, unmicronized talc, colloidal silica (Aerosil® 200), treated silica (Aerosil® R972), precipitated silica (Syloid® FP244) and their mixtures.<br>

dry mixing the particles, obtained according to the process described above, with excipients, tableting the mixture or placing the mixture in gelatin capsules in order to obtain a unit form.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, all the lubricant is sprayed over the punches and/or over the internal face of the tableting dies; the second stage of the mixing is then, of course, dispensed with.<br>
In another advantageous method of preparation of the pharmaceutical form, the preparation of the mixture comprises two stages, the first stage, which consists in mixing the active substance with all the tableting excipients, except the internal lubricant, and then a second stage, in which the lubricant is added to the first mixture in its entirety or in part, the remaining part then being sprayed over the punches and/or over the internal face of the tableting dies.<br>
The tableting of the mixture can be carried out on an alternating or rotary tablet press.<br>
The hardness of the tablet is adjusted in order to make it possible to obtain a friability, measured according to the method of the European Pharmacopoeia, of less than 2%, preferably 1%.<br>
The tablets can be round, oval or oblong in shape, can exhibit a flat, concave or convex surface and can optionally exhibit engravings or be beveled.<br>

Example 1<br>
1.   Preparation  of   the  particles   comprising  a surfactant<br>
Manufacturing is carried out on the GPCG1 fluidized bed in bottom spray mode.<br>
The spraying solution is prepared by dissolving itraconazole (supplied by Wickoff) in a mixture of solvents, 96° alcohol/methylene chloride in a 41.6/58.4 ratio by weight, with HPMC 2910 5 cPs (supplied by Dow Chemical) and polysorbate 20 (Montanox® 20, supplied by Seppic).<br>
The EFK lactose (supplied by HMS) is introduced into the fluidized bed and the solution is sprayed in bottom spray mode; 4 stages of spraying the solution are carried out successively; the granules are dried in the fluidized bed and milled using a Forplex mill with a 630 urn screen for the present use after each spraying stage.<br>
After the fourth stage, the granules obtained are dried in the fluidized bed.<br>
The coating parameters are presented in table 1:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The total weight of solution sprayed is 11 kg and the total granulating time is 4 h 47 min.<br>
The particles obtained are dried in a GPCG1 fluidized bed, the drying parameters being as follows:<br>
inlet air temperature: 48°C,<br>
drying time: 30 min,<br>
cooling until the temperature reaches 29°C.<br>
The particles are subsequently milled using a mill of Forplex type equipped with a screen with an opening of 630 The  amount  of  dry  granules  obtained  is  1.406 kg, corresponding to a yield of 93%.<br>
The manufacturing formulation tested is shown in table <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
2.   Results<br>
2.1  Particle size distribution<br><br>
The  particle  size<br>
It  is  presented  in  figure  1. distribution gives the following results:<br>
DIQ%:   62   Jim<br>
D50%:   231   jam<br>
D90%:   419  (am.<br>
2.2  Kinetics of dissolution<br>
They are  studied with regard to three particulate bodies.<br>
- 18 -<br>
The measurements are carried out continuously under UV radiation, . at a measuring wavelength of 254 nm, on 50 mg of itraconazole in 900 ml of D type 1.2 medium (paddle speed 100 rpm).<br>
The results are illustrated in figure 2.<br>
The coating produced according to the process of the invention considerably improves the dissolution of the itraconazole. The milling accelerates the dissolution: 50% of the product is dissolved after testing for 10 minutes for the unmilled fraction and after 4 min for the milled fraction.<br>
Example 2<br>
1.   Preparation of particles not comprising surfactant<br>
The particles are prepared according to the procedure described in example 1. The manufacturing formulation is shown in table 3.<br><br>

DIO%:   88   (im<br>
D50%:   239  jam<br>
D90%:   435   urn.<br>
2.2  Kinetics of dissolution<br>
They are studied under the same conditions as in example 1.<br>
In addition to the milling, the presence of a surfactant accelerates the dissolution. The results are illustrated in figure 4.<br>
After dissolving for 10 minutes, 26% of itraconazole is dissolved for the batch without surfactant, whereas 90% of itraconazole is dissolved for the batch with surfactant, for which virtually all the coprecipitated itraconazole is dissolved.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
