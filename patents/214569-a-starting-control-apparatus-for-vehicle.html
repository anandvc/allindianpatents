				<td>The present invention relates to a starting control<br>
apparatus for a vehicle.	,<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
It sometimes occurs that it is forgotten, upon parking, to stop an internal combustion engine and idling continues for a long period of time.  This dissipates fuel, reduces the life of a battery and is not good for environments.<br>
Thus, an example wherein, when idling continues for more than a predetermined period of time under predetermined conditions, operation of an internal combustion engine is stopped automatically (the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Application No. Showa 59-39946) has been proposed already.<br><br>
[Subject to Be Solved by the Invention] In order to eliminate wasteful consumption of fuel, it is desirable to stop idling of an internal combustion engine also when a vehicle is temporarily stopped.<br>
However, if the internal combustion engine is stopped when the vehicle is temporarily stopped at a traffic light or in a like case, then a starting operation of the internal combustion engine is performed each time the vehicle is to be started.  Consequently, a starting operation is performed frequently, which is cumbersome. Further, since the internal combustion engine does not remain in an idling condition, time is required for starting of the internal combustion engine, or upon starting, plunging gear sound of the starter motor is produced.  Consequently, the internal combustion engine is reduced in commercial value.<br>
The present invention has been made in view of such a situation as described above, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a starting control apparatus for a vehicle of a high commercial value which stops, when a vehicle stops, an internal combustion engine to eliminate dissipation of fuel and can perform starting of the vehicle<br>
simply and smoothly.<br>
[Means to solve the Subject and Operation and Effects]<br>
In order to attain the object described above, the present invention provides a starting control apparatus for a vehicle, characterized in that it comprises<br>
a starter motor provided coaxially with a crank shaft of an internal combustion engine,<br>
power supply stopping means for stopping power supply from a battery to said starter motor when the speed of rotation of said crank shaft becomes higher than a predetermined speed,<br>
power supply means for supplying power to said starter motor when a throttle opening is not in a fully closed condition, and<br>
ignition stopping means for stopping ignition of said internal combustion engine when the speed of said vehicle is zero and the throttle opening is in a fully closed condition.<br>
If the vehicle stops, then since the speed of the vehicle is zero and the throttle opening is in a fully closed condition and consequently the ignition stopping means stops ignition of the internal combustion engine, the internal combustion engine stops its operation, and wasteful consumption of fuel can be eliminated.<br><br>
Then, upon starting of the vehicle, if the accelerator is operated, then the throttle opening is increased and the power supply means supplies power to the starter motor.  Consequently, the starter motor provided coaxially with the crank shaft is driven to immediately establish a starting condition.  Besides, since the ignition stopping means cancels stopping of ignition and enables ignition, the internal combustion engine can be started quickly and without much starting noise and the vehicle can be started smoothly by a simple operation.<br><br>
It is to be noted that, after the internal combustion engine is started, when the speed of rotation of the crank shaft becomes higher than the predetermined speed, the power supply stopping means can stop supply of power to the starter motor.•Where the starting control apparatus for a vehicle<br>
is constructed such that the ignition stopping means stops ignition of the internal combustion engine when the speed of the vehicle is zero and the throttle opening is in a fully closed condition and besides warming up of the internal combustion engine is completed, even if the<br>
vehicle remains in a stopping condition, ignition is continued during warming up so that idling operation of the internal combustion engine may not be disturbed.<br><br>
The completion of warming up of the internal combustion engine can be detected from a rise of the water temperature of the engine, stopping of operation of a by-starter of a carburetor, cancellation of a choking operation of the carburetor and so forth.<br>
Where the starting control apparatus for a vehicle is constructed such that a centrifugal clutch is interposed in a power transmission system from the internal combus¬tion engine to a rear wheel, upon starting of the vehicle, even if the crank shaft is rotated immediately in response to an operation of the accelerator, the vehicle does not start until after the centrifugal clutch is connected. Consequently, starting of the vehicle becomes further smooth.<br>

An embodiment according to the present invention is shown in FIGS. 1 to 3 and is described in the following. A starting control apparatus according to the<br>
present embodiment relates to a 2 -stroke internal combustion engine carried on a scooter type motorcycle, and FIG. 1 is a general side elevational view of the scooter type motorcycle 1 .<br>
A vehicle body front part 2 and a vehicle body rear part 3 are connected to each other by a floor part 4, and a body frame which forms a skeleton of the vehicle body is generally composed of a down tube 6 and a main pipe 7 .<br>
A fuel tank, a container box and so forth are supported by the main pipe 7, and a seat 8 is disposed above them.<br>
Meanwhile, a pair of handle bars 11 are provided at an upper portion of the vehicle body front part 2 and supported for pivotal motion on a steering head 5, and a front fork 12 extends at a lower portion of the vehicle body front part 2 and a front wheel 13 is supported for rotation at a lower end of the front fork 12.<br>
An accel grip 61 is provided on the right handle bars 11.<br>
A bracket 15 is provided projectingly at a lower end of a rising portion of the main pipe 7, and a swing<br>
unit 17 is connected and supported for rocking motion to and on the bracket 15 with a link member 16 interposed therebetween .<br>
A 2-stroke internal combustion engine 200 having a single cylinder is carried at a front portion of the swing unit 17, and a belt type non- stage transmission 35 extends rearwardly from the internal combustion engine 200 and a rear wheel 21 is supported for rotation on a reduction gear 38 which is provided at a rear portion of the belt type non-stage transmission 35 with a centrifugal clutch interposed therebetween.<br>
A rear cushion 22 is interposed between an upper end of the reduction gear 38 and an upper bent portion of the main pipe 7.<br>
Disposed at an upper portion of the swing unit 17 are a carburetor 24 connected to an intake pipe 23 extending from an upper portion of a cylinder head of the internal combustion engine 200 and an air cleaner 25 connected to the carburetor 24.<br>
On the other hand, a main stand 26 is mounted for pivotal motion on a hanger bracket 18 provided projectingly<br>
at a lower portion of a swing unit case 31, and a base end of a kick arm 28 is securely mounted on a kick shaft 27 which projects from a transmission case cover 36 of the belt type non-stage transmission 35.  A kick pedal 29 is provided at an end of the kick arm 28.<br>
FIG. 2 is a sectional view of the internal combustion engine 200 taken along line II-II of FIG. 1.<br>
The internal combustion engine 200 includes a cylinder block 203 and a cylinder head 204 successively assembled to a crankcase 202 formed from left and right cases for supporting a crank shaft 201, directed in leftward and rightward horizontal directions, for rotation, and in the cylinder block 203, not only an exhaust path not shown is formed, but also a scavenging path 205 is formed from a scavenging port opened to a cylinder bore and is communicated with a crank chamber of the crankcase 202.<br>
An ignition plug 206 is fitted in the cylinder head 204 and directed to a combustion chamber, and the cylinder head 204 and the cylinder block 203 are covered with a fan shroud 207 except an exposure location of the ignition plug 206.<br>
A left crankcase 202L serves also as a belt type non-stage transmission chamber case, and a belt driving pulley 210 is provided for rotation on the crank shaft 201 which extends through the left crankcase 202L.<br>
The belt driving pulley 210 is composed of a fixed side pulley half 210L and a movable side pulley half 21 OR. The fixed side pulley half 210L is securely mounted at a left end portion of the crank shaft 201 by a boss 211, and the movable side pulley half 210R is spline fitted on the crank shaft 201 on the right side of the belt driving pulley 210 and can be moved toward and away from the fixed side pulley half 210L.  A V belt 212 is held between and wrapped around the two pulley halves 210L and 21 OR.<br>
A cam plate 215 is securely mounted on the crank shaft 201 on the right side of the movable side pulley half 21OR. A slide piece 215a provided on an outer peripheral end of the cam plate 215 is engaged for sliding movement with a cam plate sliding boss portion 210Ra formed in an axial direction at an outer peripheral end of the movable side pulley half 210R.<br>
A side face of the movable side pulley half 21OR<br>
adjacent the cam plate 215 is tapered toward the cam plate 215 side, and a dry weight roller 216 is held and accommodated between an inner side of the tapered face of the movable side pulley half 210R and the cam plate 215.<br>
Accordingly, as the speed of rotation of the crank shaft 201 increases, the dry weight roller 216 which is positioned between and rotated together with the movable side pulley half 210R and the cam plate 215 is moved in a centrifugal direction by a centrifugal force, whereupon the movable side pulley half 21 OR is pushed by the dry weight roller 216 so that it moves leftwardly and approaches the fixed side pulley half 210L thereby to move the V belt 212 held between the two pulley halves 210L and 21 OR in a centrifugal direction to increase the wrapping diameter.<br>
In response to such belt driving pulley 210, the V belt 212 is wrapped around a belt driven pulley not shown at a rear location, and power is transmitted to a rear speed reduction mechanism or the like via a centrifugal clutch while being automatically adjusted to drive the rear wheel.<br>
A transmission case cover 220 which covers over<br>
such belt type non-stage transmission chamber from the left side extends rearwardly from the belt driving pulley 210 to cover over the belt type non-stage transmission chamber, and the kick shaft 27 extends through and is supported at a rather forward location for rotation on the transmission case cover 220. A driving helical gear 222 is fitted at an inner side end portion of the kick shaft 27 and is urged by a return spring 223.<br>
Further, on an inner face of a front portion of the transmission case cover 220, a sliding shaft 224 is supported for rotation and for axial sliding movement coaxially with the crank shaft 201. A driven helical gear<br>
225	is formed on the sliding shaft 224 and held in meshing<br>
engagement with the driving helical gear 222. A ratchet<br>
wheel 226 is securely mounted at a right end of the sliding<br>
shaft 224, and the sliding shaft 224 is generally urged<br>
leftwardly by a friction spring 227.<br>
Meanwhile, a ratchet is formed on the boss 211 on the crank shaft 201 side in an opposing relationship to the ratchet wheel 226, and the ratchet and the ratchet wheel<br>
226	can be engaged with and disengaged from each other by<br>
sliding movement of the sliding shaft 224.<br><br>
Accordingly, if the kick pedal 29 is treadled down and the kick shaft 27 is rotated against the return spring 223, then the driving helical gear 222 is rotated integrally with the kick shaft 27, and while the driven helical gear 225 held in meshing with the driving helical gear 222 is rotated integrally with the sliding shaft 224, it is slidably moved rightwardly against the friction spring 227 until the ratchet wheel 226 is brought into meshing engagement with the ratchet of the boss 211 to compulsorily rotate the crank shaft 201.  Consequently, the internal combustion engine 200 can be started.<br>
Meanwhile, a right crankcase 202R extends in a substantially cylindrical shape on the right side of a main bearing 209 on which the crank shaft 201 is supported for rotation, and the crank shaft 201 extends along a center axis of the right crankcase 202R.<br>
A starting and generating apparatus 250 which is a combination of a starter motor and a generator is disposed in the cylinder of the right crankcase 202R.<br>
An inner rotor 251 has a rotor boss 252 fitted on the crank shaft 201 extending rightwardly and fastened by a nut 253.  The rotor boss 252 has a substantially<br>
ylindrical shape and has, on the inner side thereof, a small diameter cylindrical portion 252a of a somewhat reduced diameter while magnets 254 are fitted at six locations on an outer periphery of a large diameter cylindrical portion of the rotor boss 252.<br>
A governor outer member 255 tapered toward an outer periphery of the small diameter cylindrical portion 252a of the rotor boss 252 and open leftwardly is secured at an inner side opening edge thereof to the rotor boss 252 by a rivet 256.<br>
The governor outer member 255 has six grooves formed on an tapered inner circumferential face thereof and directed in an axial direction, and outer side opening edges corresponding to the individual grooves are bent parallelly and project a little.<br>
Meanwhile, a governor inner member 258 is fitted for sliding movement in leftward and rightward axial directions on the peripheral face of the small diameter cylindrical portion 252a of the rotor boss 252.  The governor inner member 258 has six pockets 259 formed in a swelling condition on an outer periphery of a cylindrical portion of the rotor boss 252 such that they are open to<br>
the outer side.  Bottom walls of the pockets 259 are tapered obliquely.<br>
Metal balls 260 are accommodated in the pockets 259, and the tapered wall of the governor outer member 255 is positioned such that it closes up the openings of the pockets 259.<br>
J<br>
It is to be noted that part of the cylindrical portion of the governor inner member 258 extends in the rightward direction to form a plurality of connecting portions 258a, and the connecting portions 258a extend through the large diameter cylindrical portion of the rotor boss 252 and securely mounted at end portions thereof to a brush holder 262, which is supported for sliding movement in leftward and rightward axial directions on the right side of the rotor boss 252, so that the governor inner member 258 and the brush holder 262 can be slidably moved integrally with each other.<br>
Accordingly, the governor inner member 258 which is urged rightwardly by a spring and is in a condition indicated by solid lines in FIG. 2 is slidably moved, as the speed of rotation of the inner rotor 251 increases, in the leftward direction together with the brush holder 262<br>
as indicated by alternate long and two short dashes lines in FIG. 2 as the balls 260 tend to move along centrifugal directions along the tapered wall of the governor outer member 255 and presses against the bottom walls of the pockets of the governor inner member 258.<br>
The brush holder 262 has brushes 263 provided projectingly at predetermined positions on a side face thereof, and the + side brushes are communicated with each other by a + side terminal plate while the - side brushes are communicated with each other by a - side terminal plate.<br>
A rectifier holder 265 disposed corresponding to the brush holder 262 has a large diameter conductor line 266, a rectifier piece 267 and a small diameter conductor line 268 disposed on concentric circles on a face thereof opposing to the brush holder 262.<br>
The brush holder 262 is supported on an outer stator 270 disposed on an outer periphery of the inner rotor 251.<br>
The outer stator 270 has a structure wherein a generating coil 272 and a starting coil 273 are wound on a<br>
yoke of a stator core 271 and is disposed with the stator core 271 securely mounted on the right crankcase 202R in the cylinder of the right crankcase 202R.<br>
[t)Q40']<br>
It is to be noted that the crank shaft 201 extends rightwardly through and farther than the brush holder 262, and a forced air cooling fan 280 is mounted at an end of the crank shaft 201. A fan cover 281 is provided rightwardly of the forced air cooling fan 280 and connected to the fan shroud 207.<br>
The starting and generating apparatus 250 provided for the internal combustion engine 200 has such a structure as described above.  The inner rotor 251 rotates integrally with the crank shaft 201, and when the speed of rotation of the inner rotor 251 is lower than a predetermined speed lower than an idling speed, the governor inner member 258 and the brush holder 262 are positioned rightwardly as indicated by solid lines in FIG. 2 and the brushes 263 remain in contact with the large diameter conductor line 266, rectifier piece 267 and small diameter conductor line 268 of the rectifier holder 265.  However, if the predetermined speed is exceeded, then the brush holder 262 is slidably moved leftwardly as indicated by alternate long<br>
and two short dashes lines in FIG. 2 by a governor mechanism so that the brushes 263 are spaced away from the large diameter conductor line 266, rectifier piece 267 and small diameter conductor line 268.<br>
Accordingly, upon starting of the internal combustion engine 200, power of a battery is supplied to the starting coil 273 through the contact of the brushes 263 with the large diameter conductor line 266, rectifier piece 267 and small diameter conductor line 268 of the rectifier holder 265, and turning torque is produced on the inner rotor 251 by current flowing through the starting coil 273 to directly rotate the crank shaft 201 to start the internal combustion engine.<br>
Then, after the speed of rotation of the crank shaft 201 exceeds the predetermined speed, the power supply is stopped by the governor mechanism.<br>
pO 0 4 3-]<br>
A starting control system for the internal combustion engine 200 which includes the starting and generating apparatus 250 which directly rotates the crank shaft 201 described above is described below with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
A positive terminal of a battery 50 is connected to<br>
a GDI (capacitive discharge ignition) unit 52 and one fixed contact 62a of a throttle switch 62 of power supply means 60 through a combination switch 51, and connected also to one contact 63a of a starter magnet switch 63 of the power supply means 60.<br>
The throttle switch 62 is provided on the accel grip 61 and includes the one fixed contact 62a and an arcuate contact 62b which turns together with the accel grip 61.  The two contacts 62a and 62b exhibit an off state in a fully closed throttle condition, but exhibit an on state in any other condition.<br>
The arcuate contact 62b is connected to an electromagnetic coil 63c of the starter magnet switch 63, and the other end of the electromagnetic coil 63c is grounded through a brake switch 64 .<br>
The other contact 63b of the starter magnet switch 63 is connected to the small diameter conductor line 268 of the starting and generating apparatus 250 and connected also to one input terminal of a NOR circuit 71 of ignition stopping means 70.<br>
In particular, in the power supply means 60, if,<br>
while the combination switch 51 is on and the brake switch 64 is on as a result of a braking operation, the accel grip 61 is manually turned to cancel the fully closed throttle condition, then current flows through the electromagnetic coil 63c and the starter magnet switch 63 is rendered conducting to enable power to be supplied to the starting and generating apparatus 250 so that the starting and generating apparatus 250 is driven to start as a starter motor while a H (high) level signal is outputted to the one input terminal of the NOR circuit 71 of the ignition stopping means 70.<br>
Accordingly, such an element as a starter button is not provided, and if the accel grip 61 is turned while a braking operation is performed, then the internal combustion engine can be started immediately, and no starting is performed in any other condition.<br>
Meanwhile, a signal representative of presence or absence of rotation of the front wheel 13 detected by a vehicle speed sensor 53, that is, a signal representative of whether or not the vehicle speed is zero, is inputted to the other input terminal of the NOR circuit 71 of the ignition stopping means 70.  If the vehicle speed is zero,<br>
then a L (low) level signal is inputted, but if the vehicle speed is any other than zero, then a H level signal is inputted .<br>
An output of the NOR circuit 71 is inputted to one input terminal of a NAND circuit 72 in the next stage, and an on/off signal of a by-starter 55 mounted on the carburetor 24, that is, a signal representative of whether or not warming up is completed, is inputted to the other input terminal of the NAND circuit 72.  If warming up is not completed, then a L level signal is inputted, but if warming up is completed, then a H level signal is inputted.<br>
An output terminal of the NAND circuit 72 is connected to the base terminal of a transistor 73.<br>
[ftfrM]<br>
The collector terminal of the transistor 73 of the ignition stopping means 70 is connected to an output of the GDI unit 52, and the emitter terminal of the transistor 73 is connected to an ignition coil 54 which operates the ignition plug 206.<br>
The ignition stopping means 70 is constructed in such a manner as described above. When the throttle opening is in a fully closed condition and the vehicle<br>
speed is zero, L level signals are inputted to the two input terminals of the NOR circuit 71, and consequently, a H level signal is outputted to the NAND circuit 72. Further, when warming up is completed, a signal of a H level is inputted to the other input terminal of the NAND circuit 72, and accordingly, a L level signal is outputted from the NAND circuit 72 and the base terminal of the transistor 73 is set to a L level.  Consequently, the transistor 73 is rendered non-conducting, and ignition current from the GDI unit 52 does not flow through the ignition coil 54 and ignition is stopped.<br>
^-i<br>
If only one of the conditions that the throttle opening is not a fully closed condition, that the vehicle speed is zero and that warming up is completed is satisfied, then the output of the NAND circuit 72 exhibits a H level, and the transistor 73 is rendered conducting to establish an ignition enabled condition.<br>
Since the present starting control system is constructed in such a manner as described above, when it is tried to stop the present motorcycle after it runs, if the accel grip 61 is manually operated to put the throttle opening into a fully closed condition and a braking<br>
operation is performed to stop the vehicle, then the vehicle speed is reduced to zero, and since warming up has been completed already, ignition is stopped by the ignition stopping means 70 and operation of the internal combustion engine is stopped.<br>
Also when the vehicle temporarily stops at a traffic light or the like, operation of the internal combustion engine is stopped, and wasteful consumption of fuel can be eliminated.<br>
Then, if the accel grip 61 is manually operated to gradually increase the throttle opening while the braking condition remains effective (the brake switch 64 remains in an on state), then the starter magnet switch 63 is rendered conducting to enable power to be supplied to the starting coil 273 of the starting and generating apparatus 250 so that the starting and generating apparatus 250 is driven as a starter motor to start the internal combustion engine, and a H level signal is outputted to the one input terminal of the NOR circuit 71 of the ignition stopping means 70 to render the transistor 73 conducting to cause the ignition plug 206 to effect ignition thereby to start the internal combustion engine 200.<br>
Since the present starting and generating apparatus 250 directly rotates the crank shaft 201 to effect starting, the crank shaft 201 can be rotated in a moment without noise to effect starting of the internal combustion engine 200 smoothly.<br>
After the internal combustion engine 200 starts and the speed of rotation of the crank shaft 201 exceeds the predetermined speed, then power supply to the starting and generating apparatus 250 is stopped by the governor mechanism, and the engine speed increases at a moment to the throttle opening in response to an accelerator operation .<br>
Since the internal combustion engine 200 starts and the engine speed increases only by manually operating the accel grip 61 after the internal combustion engine 200 temporarily stops as described above, also the centrifugal clutch on the rear wheel 21 side is connected, and if the braking operation is cancelled, then the vehicle can start running immediately.<br>
In other words, even if operation of the internal combustion engine 200 is stopped each time the vehicle stops temporarily to eliminate dissipation of fuel,<br>
starting can be performed immediately and smoothly by simple operations.<br>
It is to be noted that, although the ignition stopping means 70 stops ignition if the throttle opening is a fully closed condition and the vehicle speed is zero and besides warming up is completed like a case wherein the vehicle temporarily stops, when warming up is required upon starting of the engine, ignition is continued and operation of the internal combustion engine is not stopped until warming up is completed.<br>
Further, in the present starting control system, the brake switch 64 is interposed in series to the electromagnetic coil 63c of the starter magnet switch 63 to allow starting while a braking operation is performed so that the vehicle may not begin to run immediately by starting of the internal combustion engine.  However, even if the brake switch 64 is not connected to the electromagnetic coil 63c of the starter magnet switch 63 such that the starter magnet switch 63 is grounded directly, this little matters with the present scooter type motorcycle 1 .In particular, since the swing unit 17 of the present scooter type motorcycle 1 is constructed such that rotation of the crank shaft 201 is transmitted to the rear wheel 21 via the belt type non-stage transmission 35 and the centrifugal clutch, even if the starting and generating apparatus 250 acts as a starter motor and directly rotates the crank shaft 201, the rear wheel 21 is not rotated to cause the vehicle to begin to run until after a speed at which the centrifugal clutch is connected is reached, and therefore, there is no trouble even if the brake switch 64 is not interposed.<br>
Further, while, in the present embodiment, completion of warming up of the internal combustion engine is detected from presence or absence of operation of the by-starter 55 provided for the carburetor 24, completion of warming up can be detected otherwise even by supervision of a rise of the water temperature of the engine, cancellation of a choking operation of the carburetor or the like.<br>
