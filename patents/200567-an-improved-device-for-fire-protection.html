				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved automatic fire protective hydrant safety device, which works with the aid of electric facilities and also even in complete failure of electricity or electric facilities it works, even though there will be a reduction in pressure occurs, in case of electric failure, and it extinguish fire at the base and prevent the spreading of fire at the base and surroundings itself. The significance of this mode of protection is that it includes simultaneous multi protections  For that, protectors, surrounding protectors, additional support cum surrounding protectors and additional surrounding linking protectors are arranged in the protective portions and upper, middle and lower containers are arranged in the container portion and multi foldings are for regular water flowings and double locking folding when open, opening from main pipe and opening from the reserved water tank will formed. Here the additional surrounding linking protectors, which is connected to the neighbouring unit, will act only if the fire spread to other areas. The fire detector is connected to the air tube. By the pressure of compressed air inside the air tube the whole system stand upward in normal condition. When fire occurs, when the detector detects fire, then it works and air inside the air tube will released out and then it works automatically. Instead of air, tube can be filled by water also, then it becomes water tube and naturally water comes out first and other workings are same. By pulling the string it can be operated manually. When on pulling the string the detector, works and then other workings will be automatic. Inside the container which is made by fire resistant metal, the fixer cum water passagers (legs like arrangements) are arranged, for to close the hole on normal condition, and for to open the holes for flowing water from the upper case to the lower when on work and switch portions are used to transmit messages.<br>
As it is a very peculiar field, field of fire, especially when it is relating to safety of life and properties, the efficiency of the protective system should be maximum. This invention can ensure perfect protection from the fire, by extinguish fire and by prevent spreading of fire at the base surroundings itself when compared to the known arts. It can protect as usual and further the object and advantages over the known art is that even in complete electric failure it can work up to an extent and more than that simultaneous automatic multi protections which includes protection with surrounding protection and additional support cum surrounding protection and additional surrounding linking protection and automatic working facilities for to work, including operation of switches to the control panel for working fire alarm, generators or additional facilities arranged, will work.<br><br>
In the kown art, the hydrant systems, sprinklers, or different types of extinguishers are used for to put off fire. The disadvantages and defects of the present hydrant systems are failure in work in case of electric failure.and even it works as normally, it is not sufQcient to ensure safety, with the present available facilities.<br>
Another method which now used for to put off fire is the extinguishers. It also have lot of defects. It is very common that when fire takes place, people will become very panic and they are not ready even to think of extinguishers or for to read its instructions to use, at such an occasion. Because panic people will give first preference for to escape or for to ran away firom the fire.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the extinguishers, may not be available at near and even if it is available, everybody may not be aware about the proper use of it. Unless properly used it will not work and even it work,too dangerous (example: cold bum). A common method of operation is not possible for different types of extmguishers, when on work some of the extinguishers are to use in normal position but some others are to use in inverted position. Another defect of extinguishers is that it will be effective only when the fire is at the initial stage. Normally within seconds the fire will spread out and for the extinguishers it will be out of control then.<br>
A major defect of extinguishers and other known arts is that for old peoples, children, and for handicapped or disabled persons or while in sleep all present arts becomes helpless or becomes an entirely useless things.<br>
The object of this invention is to eliminate the above said major defects and to ensure total protection in a most effective manner.<br>
Advantage of this invention is that fire and its very surroundings is the concentrating centre. Its object is to extinguish the fire and avoid spreadmg totally at the base itself, even in case of electric failure. Another advantage is that only affected areas and its surroundings are treated so that utilization of water in a best manner is possible.<br>
Another advantage is that both permanent and temporary installations are possible. So that it can be used for seasonal occasions such as festivals etc.<br>
-3-<br><br>
A fire protective hydrant safety device in which detectors arranged are for to detect the fire. When the fire starts the detector detects the fire and as a result it burst out and through the opening thus made water or air filled inside the tube released out and the piston comes down and as a result the whole main portions of the container comes down. The detector is attached at the bottom region.<br>
The switches are arranged in a manner that it have no friction at all, when the containers body portion coming to down and for that 'Push on' switch is ideal.<br>
The protectors are the immediate surrounding holes at the bottom portion of the container. This portion open only when at working, or when at the container's outer portion coming to downwards, otherwise it kept in the closed condition to avoid leakage and to protect from the dust and insects.<br>
A fire protective hydrant safety device which works to protect from the fire even in complete electric failure or without electricity to extinguish the fire and prevent the spreading of the fire at the base and surroundings itself which comprises a container connected with the surrounding pipes with its upper and bottom portions are movable whereas its middle portion is fixed arid is connected by fixer cum water passegers and the tube which is filled by air or water and detector for detecting fire characterized by the portion inside the tube and double blocked multi-folding tube and normal folding tubes to ensure proper flow of the water.<br>
-h'<br><br>
In the known arts many type of fire hydrants are available, but none of them work in case of electric failure, and are not simultaneously multi protective and are not capable enough to prevent spreading of fire at the very base surroundings itself<br>
When the fire starts, the detector detects the fire then that unit becomes the main centre, the water or air filled inside the tube released out and piston comes down along with that, upper and lower cases also comes down and as a result holes and pores arranged will open, foldings becomes imfolded, through the opening thus created water fi-om the main pipe and from the storage tank comes and switches works and send messages to control unit, generator and other facilities arranged will operate and protectors, surrounding protectors and additional supporting cum surrounding protectors will work and m case if fire spread to other areas, then additional surrounding linking protectors will work. This arrangement is for to avoid unnecessary disturbance to other areas. The string arranged for manual operation and double lock opening are arranged for to work even in case of electric failure to ensure safely.<br>
