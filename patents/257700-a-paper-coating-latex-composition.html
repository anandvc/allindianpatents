				<td>Technical Field<br>
[ 1 ]	The present invention relates to a paper coating latex and a paper coating<br>
composition containing the same, and more precisely, an odorless paper coating latex which is free from the foul odor of latex petrochemicals during the paper coating process and a paper coating composition containing the same. <br>
Background Art<br>
[2]     In general, a paper coating latex is produced by emulsion polymerization. The polymerization conversion ratio of the paper coating latex does pot reach 100%,. which means that non-reacted monomers or volatile organic compounds remain in the latex, causing a foul odor during paper coating and drawing limitations in practical application.<br>
[3]	To eliminate the petrochemical odor generated by non-reacted monomers and<br>
volatile organic compounds remaining in the paper coating latex, secondary polymerization is employed, in which a polymerization initiator is added to the latex which has already been through the reaction to polymerize non-reacted    ~ monomers. In another deodorization process, inactive gas or vapor is added under vacuum conditions to evaporate non-reacted monomers or volatile organic compounds.<br>
[4]	The secondary polymerization has a problem in that volatile organic<br>
compounds still remain without being polymerized. The other deodorization process above also has the problems of enormous energy consumption, requiring additional facilities, and generation of bubbles and congelations. If these methods are running continuously, the odor will be reduced but polymerization productivity will be also reduced and the latex petrochemicals cannot be eliminated completely.<br>
Disclosure of Invention Technical Problem<br>
[5]	To overcome the above problems of the conventional art,, it is an object of the<br>
present invention to provide an odorless paper coating latex, and more precisely, a paper coating latex free from the foul odor of latex petrochemicals caused by non-reacted monomers and volatile organic compounds remaining in the latex, without reducing polymerization productivity or the stability of the latex, and a paper coating composition containing the same.<br>
[6]	It is also an object of the present invention to provide a paper coated with the<br>
coating composition above. Technical Solution<br>
[7]	To achieve the above objects, the present invention provides a paper coating<br>
latex comprising 0.001 -10 weight part of cyclo-oligosaccharide compound to 100 weight part of styrene-butadiene latex.<br>
[8]	The present invention also provides a paper coating composition containing<br>
the paper coating latex above and an inorganic pigment.<br>
[9]	The present invention further provides a paper coated with the above paper<br>
coating composition.<br>
[10]	Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail.<br>
[11]	In the course of studying a method to eliminate the petrochemical odor<br>
generated from non-reacted monomers and volatile organic compounds remaining in a paper coating latex, the present inventors found out that the addition of cyclo-oligosaccharide compound to the paper coating latex which has already been reacted can eliminate the petrochemical odor, during which perfume can be additionally included, and further completed this invention by confirming that the physical properties of a paper coated with the odorless paper coating latex prepared by the method of the present invention are as good as or better than those of the conventional paper.<br>
[12]	(a) Paper coating latex<br>
[13]	The paper coating latex of the present invention is odorless, and is prepared by<br>
adding cyclo-oligosaccharide compound to styrene-butadiene paper coating latex which has already been reacted.<br>

that is well-known to those in the art, with a conversion rate of 96 - 99% and a solid component content of 40 - 55%.<br>
[ 15]	The cyclo-oligosaccharide compound is a high molecular organic compound<br>
harboring a hydrophobic cavity, which is selected from a group consisting of cy-clodextrine derivatives such as -cyclodextrine, (-cyclodextrine, -cyclodextrine and hydroxylpropyl-p-cyclodextrine, cycloinulohexose, cycloinuloheptose, cy-cloinuloctose, calyxarene, and a mixture of at least two of the above.<br>
[16]	The cyclo-oligosaccharide compound is preferably included at 0.001 -10<br>
weight part for 100 weight part of styrene-butadiene latex, which is the optimum content to eliminate the petrochemical odor and at the same time give excellent printing properties to paper.<br>
[17]	The paper coating latex containing cyclo-oligosaccharide compound can<br>
additionally include perfume.<br>
[ 18]	The perfume is selected from a group consisting of natural perfume, synthetic<br>
perfume, combined perfume and a mixture of at least two of the perfumes.<br>
[19]	The natural perfume includes all the plant perfumes obtained from flowers,<br>
leaves, pericarp, resin, bark, fruits, seeds or roots, and all the animal perfumes obtained from the sexual glands or epidermal glands of musk deer, sperm whales, beavers or musk cats.<br>
[20]	All the synthetic perfumes are possibly used herein. When natural perfume<br>
components are difficult to extract or are generated in very little amounts, a synthetic perfume is produced by analyzing and separating the perfume thereof and synthesizing the components.<br>
[21 ]	The combined perfumes are prepared by the combination of a natural perfume<br>
and a synthetic perfume.<br>
[22]	The preferable content of such a perfume is 0.0001 - 20 weight part for 100<br>
weight part of styrene-butadiene latex, which is the optimum content to eliminatea petrochemical odor and to give stability to the latex and enhance the printing<br>
properties of the paper.<br>
[23]	To the styrene-butadiene latex were added cyclo-oligosaccharide compound<br>
and perfume at 20 - 40°C, followed by stirring for 10 minutes and dispersing to<br>
give a paper coating latex.<br>
[24]	(b) Paper coating composition<br>
[25]	The paper coating composition of the present invention includes the paper<br>
coating latex of (a) and an inorganic pigment.<br>
[26]	The paper coating latex of (a) can be used as a binder.<br>
[27]	The inorganic pigment can be one or more compounds selected from a group<br>
consisting of inorganic compounds such as calcium carbonate, clay, silicon,<br>
aluminum, zinc, zirconium and titania and slurry type products.<br>
[28]	The preferable content of the inorganic pigment is 50 - 99 weight part for 100<br>
weight part of the paper coating composition.<br>
[29]	The paper coating composition can additionally include thickening agents,<br>
lubricants, insolubilizers or fluorescent agents.<br>

[70]	[Experimental Example]<br>
[71]	The physical properties of the odorless paper coating latex, the paper coating<br>
compositions and the paper produced in the above Examples and Comparative Examples were investigated and the results are shown in Table 1.<br>
[72]	*Odor test - Sensory evaluation by the sense of smell was carried out and the<br>
lower the point, the more excellent the property was (point 1 - very comfortable, point 10 - very uncomfortable). To confirm whether an odor eliminating effect continued, the odor test was first performed right after the production of the latex and again 3 days after standing at room temperature.<br>
[73]	*Low-shear viscosity - The low-shear viscosity was measured with a BF<br>
viscometer. The viscosity of the coating solution was measured by using a #3 rotor at 60 rpm for 1 minute and the value was presented by cPs.<br>
[74]	* High-shear viscosity - The high-shear viscosity was measured with a<br>
Hercules Viscometer (KRK type, model KC- 801C) at 6600 rpm (unit: cPs).<br>
[75]	*Stability - The prepared coating solution was stirred at 60°C for 10 minutes.<br>
The produced congelation was filtered with a #325 mesh and the stability was measured with a Maron Tester. The unit was ppm. The higher the value, the lower the stability went.<br>
[76]	* Adhesive strength - After printing several times with an RI printer, the<br>
degree of picking was observed by the naked eye and evaluated by a 5-point method. The higher the point, the more excellent the adhesive strength was. Inks with tack values of 12, 14 and 16 were used. The obtained points were averaged.<br>
[77]	* Water resistance - Water was added into the RI printer by using a molten<br>
roll, followed by printing. The degree of picking was measured in the same manner as used to measure the adhesive strength. Ink with a tack value of 14 was used and the water resistance was measured after printing once.<br>
[78]	*Ink drying speed - After printing with the RI printer, smearing was observed<br>
and evaluated by a 5-point method. The higher the point, the faster the ink dried.<br>
[79]	* Ink repellence - Water was added into the RI printer, followed by printing.<br>
Then, ink transfer was measured. Ink with a low tack value was used to prevent<br>
picking. The higher the point, the higher the Ink repellence was.<br>
[80]	*Paper gloss - An Optical Gloss Meter (HUNTER type, 75°~ 75°) was used to<br>
measure the paper gloss in various parts of the coated paper and the obtained<br>
points were averaged.<br>
[81]	* Print gloss - 24 hours after printing with the RI printer, the print gloss was<br>
measured in the same manner as was used to measure the paper gloss.<br>
[82]	Table 1<br>
(Table removed)<br>
[83]As shown in Table 1, the paper coating latexes of Examples 1 - 7, prepared by adding 0.001 -10 weight part of cyclo-oligosaccharide compound to 100 weight part of styrene-butadiene latex, and those of Examples 8-10, prepared by adding<br>
perfume in addition to cyclo-oligosaccharide compound to styrene-butadiene latex were confirmed to be odorless and the physical properties of the paper coating composition containing the above latex and the paper coated with the same were also confirmed to be very excellent.<br>
[84]	In the meantime, the physical properties of the paper coating compositions of<br>
Comparative Examples 1 and 2 which do not include, or include only a small amount, of cyclo-oligosaccharide compound were confirmed to be at a similar level but a de- odorization effect was not observed. The paper coating latex of Comparative Example 3 containing an overdose of cyclo-oligosaccharide compound exhibited excellent de- odorization effect but poor printing properties such as adhesive strength and water resistance. Industrial Applicability<br>
[85]	The present invention provides a paper coating latex with the elimination of<br>
odor generated by non-reacted monomers and volatile organic compounds remaining in latex during paper coating processes without reducing polymerization productivity and latex stability. The present invention further provides a paper having excellent printing properties which is coated with the paper coating composition containing the paper coating latex of the present invention.<br>
