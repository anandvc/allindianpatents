PROVISIONAL<br>
The following specification describes the invention,.<br><br>
COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
23-5-2008<br><br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention:<br>
The present invention relates to "An improved vessel with heat collector plate for waste heat recovery."<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a vessel to be used with LPG, Kerosene, wood stoves, etc. for heating or cooking food items having a waste heat collector or recovery plate attached to the bottom of the vessel from outside using plurality of heat conducting legs.<br>
When the flame and hot gases pass through the gap between the bottom of the vessel and the plate, the plate collects that portion of heat which otherwise would have gone waste. The heat thus collected is fed to the vessel through heat conducting legs to improve the heating efficiency and in turn to reduce heatingv or cooking time.<br>
Prior art:<br>
In the prior art, it is known that in tireless cooker, a heat absorbing element made in a single piece of metal with radial elevations extending at intervals from the center to the periphery and provided with orifices, extending there through at points between said elevations whereby a maximum heat absorbing and radiating surface is presented and having means at its center whereby it may be lifted.<br>
It is further known that, a cooking apparatus comprises of a base plate of suitable material non-conductive of heat, a culinary vessel, a heat- retaining body consisting of number of disks, detachably interposed between the vessel and the base plate and adopted to be heated with the vessel and a cover inclosing said vessel and heat retaining body.<br><br><br>
base plate and adopted to be heated with the vessel and a cover inclosing said vessel and heat retaining body.<br>
It is further known that vessels formed of laminations of steel and aluminum or copper to spread the heat uniformly throughout the bottom of the vessel. The said vessel consisting of cooking vessel of multiplayer type has a metallic bond between the layers to ensure a good heat transfer.<br>
The deficiencies or drawbacks in the existing art:<br>
1.	None of the prior art Cooking Vessels has the capability of waste heat recovery. This results in higher heat losses and larger heating or cooking duration thereby wasting user time.<br>
2.	In the prior art Cooking Vessels the boiling takes place only in the center of the vessel. As we move towards periphery the intensity of boiling reduces. Therefore frequent stirring is required to get uniform heating or cooking of food item.<br>
Description of the invention:<br>
The foregoing objects of the invention are accomplished and the problems and shortcomings associated with prior art techniques and approaches are overcome by the present invention described in the preferred embodiment.<br><br><br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1: Shows the isometric view of the cooking vessel. Figure 2: Shows the sectional view of the cooking vessel. Figure 3: Shows Flat ring shaped plate.<br>
Figure 4: shows the flow of flame and hot gases during the heating and, Figure 5: Shows the transmission of heat through the heat conducting legs. Figure 6: Shows t he circular bottom with the heat collecting plates and also<br>
shows the sectional view of round bottomed vessel with waste heat<br>
recovery. Figure 7: Shows Graph of Temperature and efficiency for open heating. Figure 8: shows Graph of Temperature and efficiency when vessel was covered.<br>
Now, referring to figure 1 and 2, wherein the isometric view of the cooking vessel with waste heat recovery is shown. A vessel for heating or cooking comprising of following essential parts:<br>
1.	Flat ring shaped heat collector or recovery plate.<br>
2.	Flat bottom vessel.<br>
3.	Inner heat conducting legs.<br>
4.	Outer heat conducting legs.<br>
In the figure 1, the vessel is shown upside down to indicate as to where actually the heat collector or recovery plate is fitted.<br>
Now in the figures 1 and 2, the said heat collector or recovery plate (1) is fitted at the bottom of the vessel (2). This heat collector or recovery plate is attached to the bottom of the said vessel using inner heat conducting legs (3) and outer heat conducting legs (4) having good thermal conductivity.  The outer heat<br><br>
conducting legs (4) are evenly placed around the outer periphery of the said heat collector or recovery plate (1). The inner heat conducting legs (3) are evenly placed around the inner periphery of the said plate (1).<br>
The said heat collector or recovery plate (1) is positioned at a gap of Gl, which is gradually increased to G2 as depicted in Figure 2. The said gap is varied to maintain the pressure of the hot gases constant through out the gap.<br>
Now referring to figure 3, wherein the heat collector or recovery plate is a ring shaped plate is shown. The said plate is made up of material having good thermal conductivity. It has diameter Dl that is equal to the diameter of the vessel at the bottom.<br>
Now referring to figure 4, when the cooking vessel is kept of the heat source such as LPG gas stove etc. along with food item for cooking or heating, the flame i.e. heat source (6) and the hot gases flow through the gap (G) between the collector plate and the bottom of the vessel (2). The flow of hot gases between the said gaps is depicted by (5) in figure 4.<br>
The inner diameter of the plate is so chosen that the flame does not touch the plate. While vessel is being heated by the flame that is heat source (6) and the hot gases, the collector plate (1) collects the waste heat which otherwise would have gone waste. As the plate absorbs heat its temperature increases. If there is sufficient water contents in the vessel then the temperature of vessel does not goes beyond 100 degree Celsius-<br>
As the temperature of the said plate goes beyond 100 degree Celsius, heat starts flowing from the plate (1) through the said heat conducting legs (3 and 4)<br><br><br>
to the said vessel (2). The said flow of heat from plate to vessel through said legs is depicted by (7) in figure 5.<br>
An alternate form of the embodiment is shown in Figure 6 for a round bottomed vessel.<br>
The pluralities of places, where the heat conducting legs are attached to the base of the vessel are at a higher temperature. And therefore, liquid or food item in the vessel starts boiling or heating respectively, earlier at these places and the boiling or heating at said places is quite strong. Thus, the waste heat is utilized to heat the food items in the vessel uniformly and the overall heating efficiency increases.<br>
A better and more complete understanding of the invention may be garnered from the detailed description of the preferred embodiment of the best mode of the invention as contemplated by the inventor.<br>
Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided herein; however, it is to be understood that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or matter.<br>
The embodiments of the invention as described above and the methods disclosed herein will suggest further modification and alternations to those skilled in the art. Such further modification and alterations may be made without departing from the sprit and scope of the invention, which is defined by the scope of the following claims.<br><br><br>
Now, referring to figure 6, at least two heat collecting plates (8) having inner (3) and outer (4) heat conducting legs as depicted in Figure 1 and 2, attached to the curvature of the round bottom vessel (9).<br>
Therefore, according to present invention, an Improved heating or cooking Vessel having Waste Heat Recovery capacity comprises a flat bottom vessel having circular base, a flat ring shaped heat collector or recovery plate attached to the bottom of the said vessel by means of plurality of inner and outer heat conducting legs, the said vessel having a base and side walls extending upwards from the circumference of the base, the said recovery plate collects the portion of heat that is normally wasted and in turn transmits the heat to the said vessel through the said inner and outer legs thereby avoiding wastage of heat and thus improving the heating efficiency.<br>
The diameter of the said ring shaped heat collector or recovery plate is same as that of the said vessel. Said circular flat ring shaped heat collector or recovery plate has an opening in the center and the size of said opening being of the order of the heat source.<br>
The said plate is positioned at a specific distance with an inclination below the said vessel; the said inclination gradually increases from the center towards the periphery of the said vessel. The said legs are placed evenly around the inner &amp; outer periphery of the said plate. The said inner legs are smaller as compared to outer legs to maintain the pressure of hot gases constant throughout the distance between the said recovery plate and the said vessel and the length of said inner and outer legs depends upon the inclination of the said recovery plate. Said plate is joined through legs using rivets, spot welding from outer side of bottom of the<br><br><br>
said vessel to keep the thermal resistance to the minimum value to reduce drop in the junction temperature of the said joints.<br>
The surface of the said plate facing the bottom of the said vessel can be made black in color to maximize the heat absorption. The outer side of the bottom of said vessel facing the collector plate can be blackened.<br>
The invention can be illustrated with the help of the following example, which is only indicative of the invention but not exhaustive:<br>
Test Setup:<br>
Water Quantity: 1485 ml<br>
Burner: Small Burner having 1554 kcal/hr heat capacity<br>
Ordinary Vessel: Flat bottom Aluminum vessel (275 gm, 210 mm diameter &amp; 70<br>
mm height)<br>
Efficient Vessel: Identical to above vessel with collector plate attached (Total<br>
weight 380 gm)<br>
Efficiency = Heat absorbed by the water / Heat supplied by burner.<br>
Observations:<br>
Open Heating of Water: Two experiments were carried out, one with the proposed efficient vessel and other with ordinary vessel. The temperature of water was noted at every one-minute time interval. The graph of rise in temperature and the efficiency is shown in Fig. 1. From the graphs it is observed<br><br><br>
that efficient vessel took only 6 minutes as compared with the ordinary vessel, which took 8 minutes to reach the final temperature. The fuel saved is about 25%. The efficiency of the proposed vessel was around 70% as compared with the ordinary vessel, which had efficiency around 55 %.<br>
Covered Heating of Water: Similar experiments were conducted with vessels covered using a metallic cover having a hole for inserting the thermometer. The graphs for this experiment are shown in Fig. 2. It is observed that ordinary vessel took about 7 minutes where as the efficient vessel took less than 6 minutes for reaching the final temperature. The fuel saved is about 18%. The efficiency was also higher in case of efficient vessel by about 10%.<br>
Advantages of the invention:<br>
1.	Utilizes waste heat and improves the heating efficiency thereby reducing fuel consumption and fuel costs.<br>
2.	The heating or cooking time is reduced and hence precious user time is saved.<br>
3.	The heat conducting legs are at a higher temperature as compared with the portion of vessel adjacent to it. Hence at each of these conducting legs boiling starts earlier and the boiling is very intense at these spots. Hence due to boiling of liquid at multiple points the cooking takes place faster and is uniform.<br><br><br><br>
