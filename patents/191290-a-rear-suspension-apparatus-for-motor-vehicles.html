				<td>This invention relates to a rear suspension apparatus for motor vehicles.<br>
In  motor  vehicles  the  presence  of  vibration,   whether  considerable or  not,   very  negatively  influences  the  behaviour  of  their constituent  devices  and  is  also  the  cause  of  consequent  noise.     It is  therefore  important  to  achieve  maximum  reduction  of  the unsuspended  masses  in  order  to  eliminate  vibration  and  the  noise largely  deriving  from  it.     At  the  same  time,   reducing  the unsuspended  masses  maximizes   the  vehicle  ground  force  and  hence improves  its  road  holding.<br>
These problems have so far given rise to various solutions the purpose of which is to minimize unsuspended masses in order to reduce the acceleration transmitted to the vehicle by the road contour.<br>
Some  solutions,   especially  in  the  scooter  field,   have  been developed  in  the  sense  of  maintaining  the  entire  engine oscillating  but  altering  the  cylinder  arrangement  and  the  degree of  engine  balance,  whereas  others,  more  of  motorcycle  origin, derive  from  various  methods  for  fixing  the  engine  to  the  frame. In  one  example  of  this  second  type  of  solution,   an  arrangement  is<br>
proposed  in  which  the  unit  comprising  the  engine,  is  fixed  rigidly to  the  frame,  whereas  the  unit  comprising  the  transmission  and rear  wheel   is  connected  to  the  frame  via  an  interposed  arm  or connecting  rod.     This  arm  is  hinged  at  one  end  to  a  central   region of  the  frame  and  at  the  other  end  to  the  side  of  the  engine crankcase   in  its  lower  region.     A  spring  damper  unit  is  also provided  between  the  end  part  of  the  transmission  casing  and  the frame,   to  cooperate  in  limiting  vibration.     In  further  known solutions,   rubber  elements  or  corresponding  elastic  elements  have also  been   located  at  pivotal  and  support  points.     This  further provision  has  not  totally  solved  the  problem  in  that  drawbacks   in terms  of  the  life  of  the  elastic  elements  have  arisen,   these latter  having  then  been  avoided  by  instead  using  materials  which are  not  totally  suitable  for  this  purpose,   hence  in  practice obtaining  only  poor  insulation  against  vibration. In  any  event,   such  a  solution  means  that  the  unit  comprising  the transmission  and  rear  wheel  can  oscillate  freely  about  the  arm. An  object  of  the  present  invention  is  to  provide  a  parts arrangement  in  the  rear  region  of  the  motor  vehicle  by  which acceleration  transmitted  by  the  engine  is  suppressed. A  further  object  is  to  minimize  ground  forces  over  the  entire frequency  range  normally  encountered  in  road  contours. These  objects  are  attained  according  to  the  present  invention  by  a rear  suspension  arrangement  for  motor  vehicles   in  which  in  a  rear part  of  a  motor  vehicle  frame  there  are  provided  at  least  one engine  with  relative  carburettor,   a  drive  shaft  with  relative transmission  unit,   in  the  form  of  an  arm,   for  transmitting<br>
rotation to a rear wheel, and at least one spring damper unit located between the casing of said arm of the transmission unit and an overlying part of said frame, characterized in that said engine, besides being connected by a pivot to a central portion of said frame, is also connected by a second pivot to an overlying part of said frame, said arm containing the transmission being supported on and rockable about said drive shaft.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a rear suspension apparatus for motor vehicles in which in a rear part of a motor vehicle frame there are provided at least one engine with relative carburettor, a drive shaft with relative transmission unit, in the form of an arm, for transmitting rotation to a rear wheel, and at least one spring damper unit located between the casing of said arm of the transmission unit and an overlying part of said frame, characterised in that said engine, besides being connected by a pivot to a central portion of said frame, is also connected by a second pivot to an overlying part of said frame, said arm containing the transmission being supported on and rockable about said drive shaft.<br>
The  characteristics  and  advantages  of  a  rear  suspension<br>
arrangement  for  motor  vehicles  according  to  the  present   invention<br>
will  be  more  apparent  from  the  detailed  description  given'<br>
hereinafter  by  way  of  non-limiting  example  with  reference  to  the<br>
accompanying  schematic  drawings,   on  which:<br>
Figure  1   is  a  schematic  elevation  of  a  rear  suspension  arrangement<br>
for  a  motor  vehicle  according  to  the  present   invention;<br>
Figure  2  is  a  plan  view  from  above  of  the  arrangement  of  Figure  1;<br>
and<br>
Figure  3   is  a  plan  view  from  above  of  a  second  arrangement<br>
according  to  the  present   invention.<br>
The  drawings   show  by  way  of  example   two  rear   suspension<br>
arrangements   for  a  motor  vehicle,   in  accordance  with  the  present<br>
invention.<br>
It  should  be  noted  that  the  term  "motor  vehicles"  as  used  herein<br>
means  motorscooters  and  motorcycles  provided  either  with  automatic<br>
transmission  or  with  mechanical  transmission  plus  change-speed<br>
gear.<br>
In  the  figures  the  reference  numeral   11   indicates  schematically  a<br>
substantial  rear  part  of  the  frame  of  a  motor  vehicle  of  the<br>
aforestated  meaning,   to  which  frame  part  11   there  are  connected respectively  an  engine  12  with  relative  carburettor  13  and  a transmission  unit  14,   in  the  form  of  an  arm,   for  transmitting rotation  to  a  rear  wheel  15.<br>
There  are  also  provided  a  single  spring  damper  unit  16,   located between  the  end  part  of  the  casing  17  of  the  transmission  unit   14 and  an  overlying  part   18  of  the  frame   11,  which  collaborates   in limiting  vibration.<br>
According  to  the  present   invention,   a  new  arrangement  is  provided in  that  the  engine  12,   besides  being  pivoted  at   19  to  a  central portion  20  of  the  frame  11,   is  also  pivoted  at  21   to  a  bracket   22 fixed  to  and  suspended  from  the  overlying  part   18  of  said  frame 11.     In  this  manner,   stable  positioning  of  the  engine  12  and  of its   associated  parts,   for  example  the  relative  carburettor   13,   is achieved.<br>
In  addition,   according  to  the  present   invention  the  arm  14, containing  the  transmission,   is  supported  on  and  rockable  by  way of  bearings   (not  shown)   about  a  drive  shaft,   indicated schematically  by  23.     These  bearings  are  contained  on  one  side   in the  casing  17  of  the  rockable  arm  14  and  on  the  other  side   in  one end  of  an  extension  24  thereof.     In  this  respect,   the  extension  24 of  the  arm  14  is  joined  to  or  formed  in  one  piece  with  the  actual arm  and  embraces   the  engine   12,   to  form  the  support  for  one  end  of the  drive  shaft  23.<br>
The axis of the drive shaft 23 hence coincides with the axis of rotation of the transmission arm 14, this latter being the only part  which  can  rock  about   it,   to  drag  the  rear  wheel  15.<br>
between  the  overlying  part  18  of  the  frame  11   and  the  second<br>
extension  24a  of  the  arm  14  carrying  the  transmission.<br>
In  this  manner  a  rear  suspension  arrangement  for  motorcycles   is<br>
achieved  having  a  double  damper  in  contrast  to  that  shown  in  the<br>
5	first  embodiment  of  Figures  1   and  2,   in  which  a  single  damper  is<br>
present.<br>
In  both  cases  the  axis  of  the  rockable  arm  14  coincides  with  the<br>
axis  of  the  drive  shaft  23,   on  which  the  vehicle  transmission<br>
drive  pulley  is  also  provided.<br>
10	It  can  again  be  seen  that  there  is  a  considerable  reduction  in<br>
unsuspended  masses  in  the  rear  part  of  the  motor  vehicle.<br>
The     spring  damper  unit  16,  which  in  the  example  is  provided  on only  one  side  of  the  wheel,   is  placed  therebetween. For  example  the  transmission  contained  within  the  arm  14  can  be  of automatic  type  comprising  pulleys,   indicated  schematically  by  25, expandable  towards  a  further  reduction  gear,   indicated schematically  by  26,   which  rotates  the  rear  wheel  15. In  this  manner  a  rear  suspension  arrangement  is  achieved  with  a rockable  arm  containing  only  the  stepless  speed  variation  unit  25, or  corresponding  mechanical  transmission,   and  the  final   reduction gear  26.     This  arrangement  is  absolutely  independent  of  the further  masses   in  play,   such  as   the  engine,   the  alternator,   the drive  pulley  for  the  speed  variation  unit  or  the  like,   etc.,   which are  fixed  to  the  frame  by  the  pivotal  points  or  hinges   19  and  21. For  example,   with  such  an  arrangement  according  to  the  invention, the  carburettor  13   is  also  minimally  influenced  by  the acceleration  due  to  the  oscillation  of  the  various  reduced unsuspended  elements,   so  preventing  any  possible  related carburation  difficulty.<br>
The  alternative  arrangement  shown  in  the  second  embodiment  of Figure  3   behaves   in  an  entirely  similar  manner,   in  accordance  with the  principles  governing  the  present  invention. In  this  embodiment,   in  which  equal  elements  are   indicated  by identical   reference  numerals,   in  addition  to  the  aforegoing  there is  also  provided  a  second  spring  damper  unit  16a.     In  particular, the  unit   16a  is  positioned  on  the  other  side  of  the  rear  wheel   15, on  a   second  extension  24a  of  the  arm  14,   joined  to  the  described first  extension  24.     Said  spring  damper  unit   16a  is  hence  located<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
