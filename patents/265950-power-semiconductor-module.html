GERMAN Company<br>
SIGMUNDSTRASSE 200,<br>

GERMANY<br><br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
The invention describes a power semiconductor module with a housing, at least one substrate carrier, preferably arranged in a recess of the housing and laterally enclosed by the housing, with a power-electronics circuit arrangement constructed thereon and electrical terminal elements coming from this.<br>
By way of example, a power semiconductor module of the said type is disclosed in DE 101 00 460 Al as has long been known in its basic embodiment. Such power semiconductor modules according to the prior art have a substrate carrier which forms the lower termination to the power semiconductor module. The housing of insulating material slightly protrudes above this substrate carrier on its longitudinal sides in order to enclose it. Such substrate carriers are frequently constructed as a flat moulded metal body, preferably of copper. This results in low thermal resistance with effective spreading of the heat for the heat transport from the power-electronics circuit arrangement to a cooling component.<br>
According to the prior art, it is also known that the substrate carrier is bonded to the housing in order to prevent, when the housing is filled with an insulating material which is liquid at this time, for example a silicone rubber, this silicone rubber from flowing out. Furthermore, the housing is connected to the substrate carrier by means of metallic rivet connections. These rivet connections are constructed as hollow bodies with a continuous recess in order to also enable the power semiconductor module to be attached to a cooling component by means of a screw connection. According to the prior art, these rivet connections are constructed as brass rivets since these, due to the lead component of the brass, provide for a certain deformation and thus provide for a rivet connection at all.<br>
On the substrate carrier itself, the circuit arrangement of the power semiconductor module is arranged insulated from he former. In this context, various circuit arrangements with power transistors, power diodes and/or power thyristors are known. The circuit arrangement is insulated from the substrate carrier by means of insulating substrates, for example DCB (direct copper bonding) substrates.<br>
2<br><br>
Variously designed terminal elements for load and auxiliary terminals must also be allocated to the prior art. In this context various technologies for connecting these terminal elements to the substrate or the power semiconductor components of the circuit arrangement are known. In this context solder connections/ pressure contact connections and/or sintered pressure connections are particularly preferred. For the external connection, the load terminal elements preferably have a connecting device for a screw connection. These are frequently constructed as screw nuts loosely embedded in the housing with internal thread and sections of the terminal elements arranged over these with a continuous recess flush with the internal thread.<br>
The invention is thus based on the object of presenting a power semiconductor module with connecting devices to a cooling component and/or external power lines, which are constructed to be lead free and are also susceptible to a cost-effective and automatable production method.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by a subject matter having the features of Claim 1.  preferred embodiments are described in the subclaims.<br>
The starting point of the invention is formed by a power semiconductor module comprising a housing, at least one substrate carrier preferably arranged in a recess of the housing and enclosed laterally by the housing, preferably on all sides. On this substrate carrier, a power-electronics circuit arrangement is constructed from which electrical terminal elements for load and auxiliary terminals come. The substrate carrier thus forms an outside facing the cooling component or the part of an outside of the power semiconductor module.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the housing has first and/or second connecting devices in this arrangement. These first and/or the second connecting devices are in each case constructed as essentially hollow cylindrical moulded metallic die-cast parts, preferably of aluminium or zinc die-casting.<br>
3<br><br>
The first connecting devices are used for arranging the power semiconductor module on and connecting it to an external cooling component. For this purpose, the housing of the power semiconductor module has recesses in which in each case a screw connection to the cooling component can be arranged. This represents a mechanical connection. Since the housing according to the prior art consists of a plastic, it is advantageous to reinforce this recess by means of a moulded metal body. The first connecting devices form this reinforcing moulded metal body. In this context, it is preferred if the moulded die-cast part of the first connecting device has a smooth inner surface for passing through a screw. The moulded die-cast part is here arranged in the housing in such a manner that the screw rests on a first plane surface of the first moulded die-cast part and the second surface rests on the cooling component or is slightly spaced apart from it.<br>
The second connecting devices are used for the electrical connection of the module-internal terminal elements with external power lines. From the circuit arrangement on the substrate carrier, the electrical terminal elements, which are preferably constructed as flat, tape-like moulded metal bodies produced in punched bending technology extend to the second connecting devices.<br>
The moulded die-cast part of the second connecting device is preferably arranged in the lid of the power semiconductor module and has an internal thread. By this means , it is possible to replace the screw nuts which are arranged in recesses of the housing, provided for this purpose, of power semiconductor modules according to the prior art, with the same function. The load terminal element allocated in each case to a second connecting device is arranged in the power semiconductor module in such a manner that a section of this load terminal element, which has a continuous, preferably elongated hole-like recess, is flush with the internal thread of the moulded die-cast part of the second connecting device. It is thus possible to establish the screw connection from the load terminal element to an external power line in a simple manner when using the power semiconductor module.<br>
4<br><br>
The first and/or second moulded die-cast parts according to the invention are connected to the housing by injection technology. For this purpose, it is advantageous if the respective moulded die-cast part has projections at its outer cylinder. This improves the connection with the plastic of the housing. For the first moulded die-cast part, it is also preferred if these projections are constructed rotationally symmetrically around the vertical axis of the moulded die-cast part. For the second moulded die-cast part, it is advantageous if these projections are constructed to be nose-like in order to prevent twisting in the housing.. It can also be particularly preferred if the substrate carrier is replaced by the substrate itself in its functionality. In this context, the substrate forms the boundary to the power semiconductor module and, in turn, exhibits the necessary recesses for the rivet connection.<br>
Particularly preferred developments of this semiconductor component are mentioned in the respective description of the illustrative embodiment. The inventive solution is also explained further by means of the illustrative embodiments and Fig. 1 and 2.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a power semiconductor module according to the invention in a three-dimensional view.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a section of a power semiconductor module according to Fig. 1 in a longitudinal section.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a power semiconductor module (1) according to the invention in a three-dimensional view. In this arrangement, the power semiconductor module (1) consists of a two-part plastic housing (10), of a plastic which is temperature-stable up to about 150°C, with a basic body (110) and a lid (102), wherein these are advantageously arranged and connected to one another by means of a snap/lock connection. The basic body (10) has two recesses (16) for the screw connection with<br>
5<br><br>
a cooling component, not shown. These recesses (16) have first connecting devices constructed as moulded die-cast parts (70) which are connected to the basic body (100) of the housing (10) by injection technology. These moulded die-cast parts (70) consist of aluminium or Zinc die-casting and have no lead component in the metal.<br>
Also shown are the load (60) and auxiliary terminal elements (62) of the power semiconductor module (1). In this context, the auxiliary terminal elements (62) are constructed with plug-in connections whilst the load terminal elements (60) are constructed with screw connections. The load terminal elements (60) connect the power-electronics circuit arrangement in the interior of the power semiconductor module (1) to the second connecting devices (72). For this purpose, the load terminal element (60) is constructed as a flat moulded metal body wherein these have in a section (600) at the associated connecting device (72) an elongated-hole-like continuous recess (602) for passing through a screw, and thus for the screw connection of an external power line to the load terminal element (60) by means of the second connecting device (72). In this arrangement, the latter is constructed as moulded die-cast part with an internal thread on its inner cylinder (720) and is connected to the lid (102) of the housing (10) of the power semiconductor module (1) by injection technology.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a section of a power semiconductor module (1) according to Fig. 1 in a longitudinal section. It shows the housing (10) of the power semiconductor module (1) and a substrate carrier (40) enclosed by the former and connected by means of rivet connections (20, 42). The substrate carrier has on its first inner main surface (44), and arranged in an electrically insulated manner, the power-electronics circuit arrangement (50). From the latter, auxiliary and load terminal elements (60) emanate (not shown) and extend to the parallel surface of the power semiconductor module (1). The outer main surface (46) of the substrate carrier (40) forms the contact surface to a cooling component.<br>
6<br><br>
The first connecting device (70), essentially constructed to be hollow cylindrical/ is injection moulded into the basic body (100) of the housing (10). For a durable connection with this basic body (100), the moulded die-cast part (70) has on its outer cylinder (702) projections (704) which are constructed rotationally symmetrically around the vertical axis of the moulded die-cast part (70). On its inner cylinder (700), the moulded die-cast part (70) of the first connecting device exhibits a smooth surface.<br>
The second connecting device (72), also essentially constructed to be hollow cylindrical, is injection moulded into the lid (100) of the housing (10). For a durable connection with this lid (102) , the moulded die-cast part (72) has on its outer cylinder (722) projections (724) which are constructed as noses, preferably arranged around the vertical aXIS of the moulded die-cast part (70). On its inner cylinder (720), the moulded die-cast part (72) of the second connecting device has an internal thread.<br>
It also shows a load terminal element (60) which has in a section (600) adjacently to the second connecting device (72) a continuous, preferably elongated-hole-like recess (602) which is arranged flush with the inner cylinder (720) of the associated moulded die-cast part (72) of the second connecting device in such a manner that a screw connection of an external power line to the connecting device and the intermediately arranged contact element of the power line is achieved.<br>
