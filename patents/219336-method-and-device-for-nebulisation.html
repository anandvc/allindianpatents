				<td>This invention concerns a method and device for nebulization comprising a nebulization venturi,<br>
which can be the one that is the subject of the filing of a patent application for a "nebulization<br>
venturi and device comprising same" done this day by the applicant.<br>
The invention applies in particular to devices for the diffusion of liquids, such as the diffusion of<br>
perfumes, liquid fuels, etc.<br>
The first goal of this invention is to achieve fine particles of liquid scattered into the air.<br>
The nebulization devices currently known of feature a nebulization zone open in the direction of<br>
the outlet of the nebulized liquid particles of said device. The result is that either large particles<br>
escape from the.device, or a means of recovery of these large size particles has to be provided for<br>
in the device. This invention intends to remedy these disadvantages.<br>
Under a second aspect, this invention concerns a nebulization device comprising a liquid<br>
container, a delivery conduit of the liquid into a nebulization zone and an escape opening of the<br>
nebulization zone through which the nebulized liquid particle stream escapes from the<br>
nebulization zone, characterized in that said escape opening ends in the liquid container above<br>
the liquid level and in that the liquid container comprises a nebulized liquid particle escape<br>
opening through which part of the nebulized liquid particles from the escape opening exits the<br>
container.<br>
Because of these arrangements, the larger nebulized liquid particles settle by the effect of gravity<br>
or because of their inertia in the container where they join the liquid to be nebulized.<br>
According to special characteristics, the nebulization device comprises a nebulization venturi<br>
comprising a pressurized air intake conduit, the air intake conduit and liquid delivery conduit,<br>
each provided with at least one nozzle ending toward a nebulization zone in which the air under<br>
pressure coming from the air intake conduit nebulizes the liquid coming from the liquid delivery<br>
conduit and an adjusting means of the position of the liquid delivery conduit nozzle The device<br>
thus offers the advantages outlined with the first aspect of this invention.<br>
According to special characteristics, the device comprises an air intake conduit provided with a<br>
nozzle in the nebulization zone and an open air opening in the liquid container. Because of these<br>
arrangements, part of the stream of nebulized liquid particles returns to the nebulization zone<br>
through the free air intake conduit and the particle concentration of the stream is thus increased.<br>
According to special characteristics, the device comprises: - an air suction conduit provided with<br>
a nozzle in the nebulization zone, and at another opening of the air suction conduit, a negative<br>
pressure sensor and - a processing means of a signal coming from said sensor and representative<br>
of the negative pressure inside the suction conduit.<br>
According to special characteristics, the suction conduit comprises also an open air opening in<br>
the liquid container.<br>
1<br><br>
Since other advantages of each of these characteristics have been mentioned above, they are not<br>
repeated here.<br>
This invention also concerns a nebulization method comprising: - a suction step for the liquid to<br>
be nebulized into a container, - an injection step for the liquid to be nebulized into a nebulization<br>
zone, characterized in that it also comprises: - a projection step for the nebulized liquid particles<br>
from the nebulization zone into said container above the level of the liquid in the container - a<br>
step for the exit from the container of said nebulized liquid particles.<br>
According to special characteristics, the method comprises also: - a step for air suction into the<br>
container and - a step for injection of the sucked air into the container in the nebulization zone.<br>
According to special characteristics, the method comprises also: - a step for measurement of the<br>
pressure in the nebulization and a step for processing said measurement.<br>
According to special characteristics, during the processing step, the operation of an air<br>
compressor is stopped or an alarm signal is generated when the pressure measurement meets<br>
predetermined variation criteria.<br>
According to special characteristics, the measurement step is carried out by a negative pressure<br>
sensor located in a suction conduit provided with an open air opening and a nozzle in the<br>
nebulization zone.<br>
Since the advantages and goals of the method correspond to those of the nebulization device<br>
briefly described above, they are not restated here.<br>
Other advantages, goals and characteristics of this invention will become apparent from the<br>

Figures 6 through 9;<br>

nozzle that can be used in each embodiment of this invention;<br>
-	Figures 13 and 14 are perspective views of an open (Fig. 13) and closed (Fig. 14) case<br>
intended to receive the device under the invention.<br>
In each of Figures 1 through 4, a venturi 61 through 64 respectively can be seen, each<br>
comprising a venturi body, an air intake conduit 10, a delivery conduit for the liquid to be<br>
nebulized 20, a nebulization zone 30 in which are located a nozzle 15 of the air intake conduit 10<br>
and a nozzle 25 of the liquid delivery conduit 20, a free air conduit 40 provided with a nozzle 45<br>
in the nebulization zone 30, the nebulization zone being formed in the venturi body and various<br>
conduits entering said body, more specifically said conduits fitting into borings made in the<br>
venturi body, proper sealing being achieved between the outside cylindrical faces of the conduits<br>
and the cylindrical faces of the corresponding borings. One can see that the conduit 20 enters<br>
into the nebulization zone 30 that is formed by a cylindrical chamber. One can see that the<br>
conduit 20 can be made of a containing part and of a contained part mounted in the containing<br>
part with a tight fit or slightly tight fit, the nozzle 25 being provided for at the end of the<br>
contained part. The type of fit can allow for the sliding of the contained part inside the<br>
containing part or prevent it.<br>
One can also see that the nozzle 45 is in a geometric plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis<br>
of the conduit 40 and that the nozzle 15 is arranged according to a geometric plane perpendicular<br>
to the longitudinal axis of conduit 10. One can also see that the longitudinal axes of the conduits<br>
10, 20 and 40 are secant, that the longitudinal axis of the conduit 10 is perpendicular to the<br>
longitudinal axes of the conduits 40 and 20. One can also see that the conduits 40 and 20 are<br>
axially aligned.<br>
The air intake conduit 10 is connected to a compressor (Figure 9) that supplies air under<br>
pressure, e.g., equal to between one and ten times the atmospheric pressure. The liquid delivery<br>
conduit 20 is connected at one end to a container of liquid to be nebulized (Figures 6, 7 and 9).<br>
In the nebulization zone 30, the nozzle 15 of the air intake conduit 10 and the nozzle 25 of the<br>
liquid delivery conduit 20 are respectively positioned so that through Venturi effect, the liquid<br>
either is sucked into the nebulization zone 30 where the air flow coming out of the nozzle causes<br>
the generation of a flow of nebulized liquid particles, directed toward an outlet 50 of the<br>
nebulization zone 30, in a well-known manner.<br>
It can be noted that the venturi 61 through 64 has an adjusting means 70 of the position of the<br>
nozzle 25 on the liquid delivery conduit 20. Adjustment can be achieved through longitudinal<br>
sliding and/or rotation of the liquid delivery conduit 20 in the venturi 61 through 64. To that<br>
effect, the liquid delivery conduit can be provided with a threaded section and the boring in the<br>
venturi body designed to receive said conduit shall be tapped, the conduit thread matching the<br>
boring tap. With such solution, the axial displacement of the conduit cannot be dissociated from<br>
its rotation. According to an alternative embodiment, the liquid suction conduit 20 and the<br>
corresponding boring are smooth, which allows for longitudinal adjustment of the conduit<br>
independently from its rotational adjustment.<br>
3<br><br>
Adjustment of the position of the nozzle 25, using the adjusting means 70, permits to vary the<br>
operating parameters of the venturi 61 through 64, to compensate at least partially for the<br>
fabrication variations and to adapt the stream of nebulized liquid particles to each use. By<br>
moving longitudinally the nozzle 25, at least the average diffusion angle of the nebulized liquid<br>
particles is adjusted in relation to the air intake conduit axis 10.<br>
In Figure 1, the nozzles 15 and 25 touch, except for the thickness of conduit 25. In Figure 2, on<br>
the other hand, the nozzle 25 is apart from the nozzle 15 by a distance of the same order of<br>
magnitude as the diameter of the nozzle 25, i.e., between half and three times this diameter.<br>
In Figure 3, the same elements as in Figure 2 can be noted, plus a taper 75 extending axially the<br>
nebulization zone 30. In Figure 4, the same elements as in Figure 3 can be noted, plus an<br>
extension of the taper 75 in the form of a cylindrical chamber 80 acting as diaphragm, i.e.,<br>
laterally retaining the stream of nebulized liquid particles. Thus, the larger particles that are<br>
generally located in the lateral parts of this stream settle on the cylindrical lateral surface of the<br>
chamber 80 and flow under the effect of gravity to be recovered either in the nebulization zone,<br>
or in the container of the liquid to be nebulized (see Figures 6 through 8).<br>
In Figure 1 through 3 it can be noted that the nozzles 25 and 45 are arranged according to<br>
parallel geometrical planes, and that the nozzle 25 is in a geometrical plane perpendicular to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the conduit 20, while in Figure 4, it can be noted that the liquid delivery<br>
nozzle 25 is not provided with revolution symmetry in relation to the liquid delivery conduit<br>
axis: the plane of the nozzle 25 shows, in relation to the longitudinal axis of the conduit 25, an<br>
angle different from 90 degrees. In alternative solutions, the absence of revolution symmetry is<br>
reflected by a non-circular shape of the conduit 20. The adjusting means 70 is designed to adjust<br>
at least the angular position of the liquid delivery nozzle 25, in relation to the liquid delivery<br>
conduit 20. The rotation of this conduit 20 permits to vary the operation of the venturi 64.<br>
Although not shown in the Figures, alternatively, the adjusting means 70 of the position of the<br>
nozzle 25 also permits to adjust the distance between said nozzle 25 and the nozzle 15 along the<br>
axis of nozzle 15, to adjust the distance between said nozzle 25 and the axis of the nozzle 15<br>
and/or to adjust the angle between the axes of nozzles 15 and 25, according to mechanical means<br>
known as such.<br>
In each of Figures 1 through 4, one can note the free air intake conduit 40 that ends in the<br>
nebulization zone 30, through the nozzle 45 and for which another opening is in the open air,<br>
e.g., in the container of the liquid to be nebulized (see Figures 6 through 8). The shape and/or<br>
position of nozzle 45 of the free air intake conduit in the nebulization zone 30 cause the suction<br>
of free air into this area, e.g., through the venturi effect, or through the effect of the negative<br>
pressure generated on the lateral parts of the nebulization zone 30 through the air flow injected<br>
by nozzle 15. The inventor noted that the presence of the free air intake conduit 40 made it<br>
possible to increase the efficiency of each venturi 61 through 64, compared to a similar venturi<br>
not provided with this free air intake conduit 40.<br>
In Figure 5, a venture 65 can be noted that comprises an air intake conduit 10, a cylindrical<br>
conduit 85 for delivery of the liquid to be nebulized on one hand, and intake of free air on the<br>
4<br><br>
other hand, a nebulization zone 30 comprising a nozzle 15 of the air intake conduit 10 and two<br>
openings 86 and 87 of conduit 85. The conduit 85 is designed to slide in a cylindrical boring<br>
made in the body of venturi 65. In this manner, the adjusting means 70, consisting of this boring,<br>
makes it possible to slide conduit 85 both in rotation in relation to its axis and in translation<br>
along its axis, which makes it possible to vary the position of openings 86 and 87 in relation to<br>
nozzle 15 and thus constitutes two adjusting parameters of the operation of venturi 65. In<br>
addition to the openings 86 and 87, conduits 85 has at one end an open air opening and at the<br>
other end an opening in a container of the liquid to be nebulized<br>
The openings 86 and 87 are circular and have diameters practically equal to the diameter of<br>
nozzle 15. They are placed symmetrically in relation to the longitudinal axis of conduit 85. They<br>
are thus diametrically opposite.<br>
Figures 6 through 8 show a container of the liquid to be nebulized 100, a delivery conduit of the<br>
liquid to be nebulized 120 consisting of a hollow rod 121 plunging into the liquid contained in<br>
the container 100 and of a secondary conduit 122 inserted into a venturi 160, said secondary<br>
conduit being in a communication relation with the conduit 120. The venturi 160 rests on the<br>
rim of the container through a centering flange 161, either independent or rooted in the venturi<br>
body. A pilferproof ring 162 is positioned around the upper part of the container and through a<br>
locking collar 163 in its upper part rests against the centering flange 161. This pilferproof ring<br>
162 is attached in a non-removable fashion on the container, hi addition, the venturi 160 is<br>
covered with a cap 164 in which an air intake conduit 110a and a nebulisate discharge conduit<br>
195 are formed.<br>
The air intake conduit 110a is appropriately extended by a fitting end 110b that is proof against a<br>
source of pressurized air, e.g., the compressed air output of a compressor. This fitting end 110b<br>
can be vertical as shown and extend either upward or downward, but said fitting end can also<br>
have a horizontal position.<br>
The cap 164 is attached to the centering flange 161 with screws and covers the locking collar 163<br>
on the pilferproof ring 162. Each screw is inserted into a boring through the flange 161 and into<br>
a blind tap made in the cap 164. Because of this arrangement, the screw heads are in the inside<br>
volume of the container or opposite it and are therefore inaccessible.<br>
Thus, after the pilferproof ring 162 is secured on the container, it is no longer possible to remove<br>
the venturi, without destroying the ring and to access the content of the container.<br>
This device can then be single-use and disposable after depletion of the liquid contained in the<br>
container.<br>
To reinforce safety by precluding the introduction into the device, and especially into the<br>
container, of any foreign matter or liquid before or after complete depletion of the liquid initially<br>
contained in the container, the various conduits accessible from outside the device can be<br>
equipped with securement means such as check valves and alike.<br>
5<br><br>
The venturi 160 comprises an air intake conduit 110 in communication relation with the conduit<br>
110a provided in the cap, the secondary conduit 122, a nebulization zone 130 in which there is a<br>
nozzle 115 of the air intake conduit 110 and a nozzle 125 of the liquid delivery conduit 120, an<br>
outlet 150 of the nebulization zone 130, an adjusting means 170 of the position of the secondary<br>
conduit 122, a taper 175 extending outlet 150 of the nebulization zone and a cylindrical chamber<br>
180 extending the taper. The adjusting means 170 consists of a micrometric pitch screw. The<br>
venturi 160 can also have a free air conduit 140 with a nozzle 145 in the nebulization zone 130.<br>
This free air conduit will be in communication relation with a through-conduit 140a provided in<br>
the cap.<br>
In a preferred design, the conduit for the liquid to be nebulized 121 comprises at its lower end a<br>
filter 121a. This filter plunges into the liquid present in the container.<br>
The free air conduit or suction conduit 140 also features:<br>
an opening 142 designed to receive a negative pressure sensor (see Figure 9),<br>
In the nebulization zone 130, the nozzle 115 of the air intake conduit 110 and the nozzle 125 of<br>
the liquid delivery conduit 120 are respectively positioned so that through Venturi effect, the<br>
liquid is sucked into the nebulization zone 130 where the air flow coming out of the nozzle 115<br>
causes the generation of a flow of nebulized liquid particles, directed toward the outlet 150 of the<br>
nebulization zone 130, in a well-known manner.<br>
The inventor noted that the presence of the free air intake conduit 140 made it possible to<br>
increase the output of the venturi 160 compared to an identical venturi not equipped with this<br>
free air intake conduit 140. In addition, since the suction conduit sucks air in the chamber 180,<br>
part of the stream from the venturi is injected into the nebulization zone, which makes it possible<br>
to increase the concentration of nebulized liquid particles in the stream leaving the chamber 180.<br>
In a manner characteristic of one aspect of this invention, the escape opening 190 through which<br>
the stream coming out of the chamber 180 exits the venturi 160 ends into the liquid container<br>
100 and the liquid container 100 comprises a nebulized liquid particle release opening 195<br>
through which part of the nebulized liquid particles coming from the escape opening 190 exits<br>
the container 100 and the nebulization liquid to be diffiised in the atmosphere surrounding this<br>
nebulization device.<br>
Thus, the larger nebulized liquid particles settle by the effect of gravity or because of their inertia<br>
in the container 100 where they join the liquid to be nebulized.<br>
In a preferred design, the escape opening 190 is directed toward the surface of the liquid<br>
contained in the container.<br>
Figure 9 shows a nebulization device 200 comprising the container 100 and venturi 160, a<br>
compressor 210, a power supply 220 for the compressor 210, a pressure sensor 230, a processing<br>
means 240, an alarm signal generator 250, a sound transmitter 260, an indicating light 270 and a<br>
computer network 280.<br>
6<br><br>
The pressure sensor 230 is positioned on the opening 142 of the conduit 140 and generates a<br>
signal representative of the pressure (or negative pressure) in the lateral parts of the nebulization<br>
zone 130. The processing means 240, for example an electronic board (possibly of the<br>
microprocessor type), a computer or a threshold circuit, receives the signal transmitted by the<br>
pressure sensor 230 and, based on predetermined variation criteria of this signal, causes the<br>
generation of alarm signals by the alarm signal generator 250 sent to the sound transmitter 260,<br>
indicating light 270 and/or computer network 280.<br>
The predetermined criteria are for example: drop of pressure measured below a threshold level or<br>
drop of pressure by at least 10% measured in less than 5 minutes.<br>
The inventor indeed discovered that when there is no more liquid in the nozzle 125, the value of<br>
the negative pressure sensed by the pressure sensor 230 is different from the value of the<br>
negative pressure when said nozzle contains liquid to be nebulized. In the embodiment<br>
illustrated in Figures 6 through 9, the value of the pressure measured is, when there is no more<br>
liquid in the nozzle 125, lower than when there is still liquid to be nebulized in the nozzle 125.<br>
The alarm signal generator 250 is designed to command: - the transmittal of sound signals by the<br>
sound transmitter 260, consisting for example of a speaker, - the transmittal of visual signals by<br>
the indicating light 270, consisting for example of a LED and/or - the transmission of alarm<br>
signals by the computer network 280, consisting for example of a wire or non-wire connection<br>
connected to a capture board itself connected to a computer system.<br>
The processing means is also designed to cut off the power supply of the compressor 210 when it<br>
detects that there is no more liquid to be nebulized.<br>
Figure 10 shows an initialization step 300 during which a venturi is connected to a container of<br>
liquid to be nebulized so that the projection by the venturi of nebulized liquid particles is done<br>
inside the container.<br>
Then, during step 310, an air compressor is started to cause suction of the liquid to be nebulized<br>
into a container.<br>
For each part of the liquid sucked during step 310, an injection step 320 into a nebulization zone<br>
then takes place and a projection step 330 of the nebulized liquid particles into said container.<br>
Part of the nebulized liquid particles then exits the container through a release opening during<br>
step 340.<br>
In parallel to the steps 320 through 340, part of the air in the container is sucked into a free air<br>
conduit, step 350, and injected into the nebulization zone, step 360.<br>
hi parallel to the steps 320 through 360, a measurement step 370 is carried out for the pressure in<br>
the nebulization zone and a processing step 380 of said measurement.<br>
7<br><br>
According to a preferred design, during measurement step 370, the pressure is measured in a<br>
suction conduit provided with a nozzle in the nebulization zone, and possibly with an open air<br>
opening, for example, in the container.<br>
During the processing step 380, the compressor operation is stopped or an alarm signal is<br>
generated whenever the pressure meets predetermined variation criteria, as explained based on<br>
Figure 9.<br>
Figure 11 shows a circular component or diaphragm 196 with three lateral openings 197 that can<br>
be inserted into the escape opening 190 preferably in a shoulder provided at the end of this<br>
opening, i.e., opposite to the nebulization chamber (see Figure 6). The function of this circular<br>
component is to retain the largest particles of the nebulized liquid so that they form large size<br>
drops that fall under the gravity effect into the container 100, which prevents the formation of an<br>
emulsion liable to cause oxidation of the liquid to be nebulized.<br>
Figure 12 shows an alternative form 26 of the nozzle 25 (see Figures 1 through 4).<br>
In this alternative, the opening of nozzle 25 has a non-plane shape formed by the intersection of<br>
the liquid delivery conduit 70 cylinder and of a cylinder surrounding the nozzle of the<br>
pressurized air intake 10, with the pressurized intake air conduit as axis.<br>
The inventor noted that this particular shape 26 allows for good efficiency of the nebulization<br>
venturi 61 through 64. Any other shape, for example, triangular can be provided for.<br>
The device as described will be appropriately arranged in a compartmented protective case as<br>
shown in Figures 13 and 14. As one can see, this case has a closing flap with a lock. One of the<br>
compartments of the case shall be designed to receive the device under the invention and another<br>
one of the compartments shall be designed to receive the compressed air compressor. The<br>
compressor compressed air outlet shall be connected through a flexible or rigid line to a socket<br>
secured in the first compartment and designed to receive the cap socket end of the nebulization<br>
device. Another compartment shall be provided to receive the device electronics.<br>
In a preferred design, to secure the device inside the case without altering the removability of the<br>
device, the latter is equipped with a locking lever designed to work together through pivoting<br>
with two anchoring studs mounted in the first compartment.<br>
It is understood that this invention can accommodate any fixtures and alternatives from the field<br>
of equivalent techniques without thereby going outside the scope of this invention.<br>
