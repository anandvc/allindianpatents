				<td>Method for Connecting Switch Parts Made of austenitic Manganese<br>
Steel Casting, or austenitic Manganese Steel Rails, with a Rail<br>
of Carbon Steel<br>
The invention relates to a method for connecting switch or<br>
crossing parts made of austenitic manganese steel casting, or<br>
austenitic manganese steel rails, with rails of carbon steel.<br>
To connect cross frogs made of austenitic manganese steel with<br>
standard rails, it has already been proposed in AT 350881 B as<br>
well as in DE 2834282 A to realize a flash butt weld, by which<br>
an intermediate piece is connected with a standard rail.<br>
According to that prior proposal, the intermediate piece was,<br>
therefore, cut to a maximum length of 20 to 25 mm, whereupon the<br>
connection of the intermediate piece with the austenitic<br>
manganese steel casting cross frog was effected by a further<br>
flash butt weld. That second welding procedure called for more<br>
rapid cooling than after the first welding procedure, whereby<br>
slower cooling served to avoid an increase in the hardening of<br>
the rail steel. The use of an intermediate piece was above all<br>
necessary because alloying elements diffused into the carbon<br>
steel of the standard rail during those welding procedures,<br>
which resulted in unprecisely defined textures entailing<br>
increased risks of fracture. Intermediate pieces, on the other<br>
hand, are to be taken as substantially softer than austenitic<br>
manganese steel casting and, consequently, subject to elevated<br>
wear. Austenitic steels as proposed for such intermediate pieces<br>
are, therefore, less resistant to wear than the material of the<br>
cross frog such that dents have been observed on the upper<br>
surface of the intermediate piece with intermediate pieces of<br>
too great a length. If, on the other hand, the intermediate<br>
piece is chosen too short, this will again entail the risk of<br>
the alloying elements diffusing from the austenitic manganese<br>
steel into the carbon steel.  The intermediate pieces,  thus,<br><br>
2<br>
serve to separate the two welds in thermal respect in order to<br>
be able to keep to the respectively required cooling conditions<br>
on the respective welds and avoid embrittlements. Such<br>
embrittlements of austenitic manganese steel casting in the<br>
first place are due to diffustion effects, whereas carbon steel<br>
can be accordingly soft-cooled by the temperature of flash butt<br>
welding.<br>
A method for producing a connection between a rail of manganese<br>
steel casting and a rail of plain carbon steel is to be taken<br>
from EP 0070774 A, wherein a special alloy is to be used for the<br>
manganese steel casting rail part. For such connections between<br>
an austenitic manganese steel and a steel workpiece, also<br>
aluminothermal melts and the casting of a thus obtained metal<br>
between two rail parts placed in a mold in a spaced-apart<br>
relationship have already been proposed in EP 181251 A. In AT<br>
395122 B, an intermediate piece of an austenitic, low-carbon<br>
steel stabilized with niobium and/or titanium was proposed, with<br>
a chromium-nickel steel having been used in particular, whereby<br>
also there a thermal treatment was required following the first<br>
welding operation between the intermediate piece and the<br>
standard rail, to which end a homogenization at temperatures of<br>
between 350° and 1000°C was proposed in particular.<br>
The invention aims to provide a method of the initially defined<br>
kind, which will do with substantially shorter intermediate<br>
pieces, wherein, in a preferred manner, the use of intermediate<br>
pieces may be renounced at all. To solve this object, the method<br>
according to the invention essentially consists in that the<br>
parts to be connected, optionally upon interposition of an<br>
intermediate piece, are connected by friction welding, wherein<br>
the weld with the austenitic manganese steel is cooled at static<br>
air without heat treatment. It has now been found in a<br>
surprising manner that by the application of a friction welding<br><br>
3<br>
process the thermal load on the welds, as compared with other<br>
known welding processes, can be reduced to such an extent that<br>
diffusion procedures will be minimized and undesired thermal<br>
shifts will be eliminated almost completely. By employing<br>
friction welding as a method for producing said connection, the<br>
interposition of an intermediate piece can be totally renounced<br>
without requiring a separate heat treatment following the<br>
welding operation. The only heat treatment optionally required,<br>
which is actually not to be addressed as a heat treatment, would<br>
consist in preheating the standard rail in order to be able to<br>
readily attain the temperatures required to make the weld. It is<br>
in any event feasible to allow the welding joint to cool at<br>
static air, even without the interposition of an intermediate<br>
piece, and without heat treatment, the method thus being<br>
substantially simplified over known methods.<br>
In a preferred manner, when using an intermediate piece, it is<br>
proceeded according to the invention in that an optionally<br>
effected heat treatment, or delayed cooling, is limited to the<br>
weld made between the carbon steel and the intermediate piece.<br>
However, such a heat treatment after having made the first weld,<br>
i.e., that between the rail and the intermediate piece, may, as<br>
a rule, be likewise omitted if a friction welding process is<br>
employed.<br>
A thermal aftertreatment after the realization of the weld with<br>
the austenitic manganese steel is not necessary for sure. Merely<br>
may the preheating of the standard rails for the friction<br>
welding process turn out to be advantageous.<br>
In the main, expensive heat treatments may, thus, be renounced<br>
in a particularly simple manner by using known friction welding<br>
processes as may be taken, for instance, from EP 1459833 Al or<br>
WO 2004/028733 Al, whereby the negative side effects of known<br><br>
4<br>
welding processes will surprisingly be eliminated even without<br>
the use of intermediate pieces, and the formation of soft-<br>
annealed zones which may lead to dents will be avoided.<br><br>
