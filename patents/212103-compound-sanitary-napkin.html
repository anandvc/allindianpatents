Disposable sanitary napkins generally come in one of three basic configurations based upon their intended use. A first product configuration is intended for the absorption of medium to high menstrual flows and is constructed with a relatively thick central absorbent element having a relatively high absorptive capacity. While having a relatively high absorptive capacity, the bulkiness of the absorbent member may cause a certain degree of wearing discomfort. A second configuration of sanitary napkins is intended for light or low menstrual flows. These sanitary napkins have a thin flexible structure and are commonly referred to as panty-liners or panty-shields. A third type of sanitary napkin is intended for absorption of medium to high menstrual flows and has a thin, flexible structure and has a relatively high absorptive capacity. The relatively high absorptive capacity is achieved by providing the thin absorbent element with superabsorbent particles. These sanitary napkins are commonly referred to as ultra-thin sanitary napkins.<br>
Another class of sanitary napkins has recently been developed that combines one or more of these concepts into a single compound sanitary napkin. A compound sanitary napkin has a primary menstrual pad and a undergarment protector and are joined to one another at their corresponding ends in such a manner that the two constituents are free to move relative to one another along essentially their entire common length. Compound sanitary napkins of this design have been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,425,130 to DesMarais and Statutory Invention Registration H1614 to Mayer et al. In accordance with these references, the primary menstrual pad is intended to absorb the bulk of the bodily liquids discharged by the user, while the undergarment protector is intended to protect the user's garments from soiling. In use, the relative freedom of movement between the primary menstrual pad and the undergarment protector serves to maintain the primary menstrual pad adjacent the user's crotch region while the undergarment protector remains associated with the user's undergarment.<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
The primary menstrual pad is disclosed as being narrow enough to at least reside partially within the external genitalia. Optionally, the primary menstrual pad may be wider than the width of the labia majora, but exhibits a lateral compression or conformability at relatively low forces, such as the forces exerted by the soft tissue of the female external genitalia, such that a portion of the primary menstrual pad is able to at least reside partially within the external female genitalia. By being conformable at relatively low forces, the primary absorbent member remains comfortable during use. In addition, the primary menstrual pad preferably exhibits a resilient recovery to enable the pad to conform to the body as the pad and body interface is subjected to shape changes. Since the primary menstrual pad has a relatively narrow width that is adapted to fit the body of the wearer, the secondary absorbent pad acts as an undergarment protector and preferably remains sufficiently wide enough to provide a stable attachment to the wearer's undergarment and to sufficiently cover the undergarment to protect it from soiling.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a compound sanitary napkin that is adapted to provide enhanced body fit, to absorb body liquids and to protect a user's garments from being soiled. The term "sanitary napkin", as used herein, refers to a disposable article which is worn by females in a crotch portion of an undergarment adjacent to the pudendal region and which is intended to absorb and retain the various liquid exudates which are discharged from the body (e.g., blood, menses, and urine). The term "compound sanitary napkin", as used herein, refers to a sanitary napkin comprised of separate constituents joined to one another to form a unitary structure. Inter-labial devices which reside partially within and partially external of the wearer's vestibule are also within the scope of this invention. As used herein, the term "pudendal" refers to the externally visible female genitalia and includes the labia majora, the labia minora, the clitoris, and the vestibule.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 1-3, there is shown one embodiment of a compound sanitary napkin 20 of the present invention. As can be seen in FIGS. 1-3, the compound sanitary napkin 20 comprises a primary absorbent member 30 and a secondary absorbent member 50 joined together by union means 70. The compound<br><br>
-   8   -<br>
sanitary napkin has two surfaces, an upper body contacting or body facing surface, and a lower, garment facing or garment contacting surface. The primary and secondary absorbent members each have corresponding body facing and garment facing surfaces. The compound sanitary napkin 20 has two centeriines, a longitudinal centerline and a transverse centerline. The term "longitudinal", as used herein, refers to a line, axis or direction in the plane of the compound sanitary napkin that is generally parallel to a vertical plane which bisects a standing wearer into left an fight body halves when the compound sanitary napkin is worn. The term "lateral", as used herein refers to a line, axis, or direction which lies within the plane of the compound sanitary napkin that is generally perpendicular to the longitudinal direction.<br>
The primary absorbent member 30 has opposite longitudinally extending sides 24 defining therebetween a width and opposite laterally extending transverse ends 25 defining therebetween a length. The sides 24 and the transverse ends 25 together define the periphery 23 of the primary absorbent member. The secondary absorbent member 50 has opposite longitudinally extending sides 21 defining therebetween a width and opposite laterally extending transverse ends 22 defining therebetween a length and which together define the periphery 23 of the secondary absorbent member. The transverse ends 25 of the primary absorbent member may have a common length with transverse ends 22 of the secondary absorbent member whereas sides 24 of the primary absorbent member are substantially narrower in width than the sides 21. Optionally, transverse ends 25 of the primary absorbent member may define a length that is less than the length defined between transverse ends 22 of the secondary absorbent member. In either embodiment since the sides 24 and transverse ends 25 of the primary absorbent member are always less than or equal to the sides 21 and transverse ends 22 of the secondary absorbent member, the<br><br>
-   9   -<br>
periphery 23 of the secondary absorbent member will define the periphery of the compound sanitary napkin 20.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the primary absorbent member has a width that is adapted to span the groin width of the user and the secondary absorbent member has a width in a central region thereof that is adapted to span the width of the user's undergarment in a central crotch region of the undergarment. The average crotch width of an undergarment generally ranges from about 4 cm to about 9 cm and the average groin width generally ranges from about 1 cm to about 4 cm. In accordance with this embodiment, the width of the primary absorbent member will range from about 10 mm to about 40 mm and the width of the secondary absorbent member in a center region will range from about 40 to 95 mm. Alternatively, the primary absorbent member may be sized and configured to span the user's labia majora and to fit within the user's groin region with minimal bunching due to the laterally compressive forces of the user's thighs. It is preferred that the width of the primary absorbent member 30 be from about 10 mm to 65 mm. Optionally, a portion of the primary absorbent member may reside within the user's labial groove. The width of the secondary absorbent member of the secondary absorbent member m a center region will range from about 40 mm to 90 mm but may be its wider transverse end region(s), generally from about 45 mm to 95 mm.<br>
The primary absorbent member 30 is sized and configured to contact the body of the user and is intended to absorb the bulk of bodily liquids discharged by the user. The primary absorbent member 30 comprises an absorbent means 33, such as absorbent core 34, a liquid permeable topsheet 32 superimposed on the absorbent core 34 and further comprises a backsheet 35 under the absorbent core 34. The primary absorbent member 30 has opposite longitudinally extending sides defining therebetween a width and opposite transverse ends defining therebetween a length.<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
As used herein, the terminology "width" refers to a measurement taken in a lateral direction, substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal centerline, between the opposite longitudinally extending sides of the respective absorbent member. As used herein, center region or central region of either the primary or secondary absorbent member refers to a region of that absorbent member that is adapted to be worn in a crotch portion of a user's undergarment. Thus, the central region of the primary or secondary absorbent member may be located nearer to one transverse end of the compound sanitary napkin as opposed to being in the exact mid-section of the napkin where the longitudinal centerline would intersect with a transverse centerhne that bisects the napkin member into two equal halves. Thus, while some embodiments of the present invention include a compound sanitary napkin that is substantially symmetrical wherein the center region is located substantially in the exact mid-section of the both the primary and secondary absorbent members, other embodiments of the present invention include compound sanitary napkins that are asymmetrical wherein the center region does not coincide with the intersection of the longitudinal centerline axis and the lateral centerline axis. One example of an asymmetrical absorbent member is an overnight type of sanitary napkin having a primary absorbent member having a length that that is adapted to be conform to the user's perineal region and a secondary absorbent member having a relatively longer transverse end region that has an extended length that is sufficiently long to cover at least a portion of a users gluteal crease when the primary absorbent member is centered over the crotch region of the user's undergarment.<br>
The primary absorbent member of the present invention is preferably relatively conformable. It is preferred to keep the primary absorbent member relatively conformable so that when worn by a user, at least a portion of the primary absorbent member may conform to the contours of the pudendal region. By forming the primary absorbent member from conformable materials, it is possible that a<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
portion of the primary absorbent member may comfortably fit or reside within at least a portion of the labial groove. While primary absorbent members have been described above as having widths or diameter dimensions greater than the width of the labial groove, they too may fit within the labial groove if they are sufficiently conformable.<br>
The width of the primary absorbent member 30, can vary widely depending on the thickness of the compound sanitary napkin. More particularly, if the combination of the primary absorbent member 30 and the secondary absorbent member 50 results in a thick, bulky sanitary napkin, i.e. having a caliper greater than 5mm, then the width of the primary absorbent member should be relatively narrow, generally from about 10 mm to 30 mm. Conversely, if the combination of the primary absorbent member 30 and the secondary absorbent member 50 result in a thin or ultra-thin sanitary napkin, then the width of the primary absorbent member may be relatively wider and still provide a comfortable, non-irritating sanitary napkin. In a preferred embodiment, the combination of the primary absorbent member 30 and the secondary absorbent member 50 have a thickness of less than 5 mm, and the width of the primary absorbent member is from about 10 mm to about 40 mm.<br>
The length 40 of the primary absorbent member 30 can generally be of any convenient dimension that can be comfortably and discreetly worn by a wearer. The primary absorbent member 30, is preferably from about 2 to 35 cm long, more preferably from about 10 to 35 cm long, and most preferably from about 20 to 35 cm long. A particularly preferred primary absorbent member 30 has a length of about 24 cm.<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
The topsheet 32 is preferably compliant, soft feeling, and non-irritating to the wearer's skin. Further, the topsheet 32 is liquid pervious, permitting liquid to readily penetrate through its thickness. A suitable topsheet 32 may be manufactured from a wide range of materials such as woven fabrics, nonwoven fabrics, polymeric materials such as apertured formed thermoplastic films, apertured plastic films, and hydroformed thermoplastic films; porous foams; reticulated foams; reticulated thermoplastic films; and thermoplastic scrims. Suitable woven and nonwoven fabrics can be comprised of natural fibers (e.g., wood or cotton fibers), synthetic fibers (e.g., polymeric fibers such as polyester, polypropylene, or polyethylene fibers); or from a combination of natural and synthetic fibers. A preferred topsheet is a non-woven fabric formed from a blend of three denier and five denier polypropylene fibers. These non-woven fabrics are commercially available from Stearns Technical Textiles Co. having an address at 100 William Street, Cincinnati, OH 45215, or PGI Nonwovens, Chicopee Inc., having an address at 2351 US Route 130 Dayton, NJ 08810-1004.<br>
Alternatively, the topsheet may comprise an apertured formed film. Preferably the apertured formed film is a three dimensional apertured formed film that is pervious to body exudates, non-absorbent and having a reduced tendency to allow liquids to pass back through and rewet the wearer's skin. Thus, the surface of the formed film which is in contact with the body remains dry, thereby reducing body soiling and creating a more comfortable feel for the wearer. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the body-facing or exposed surface of the formed film topsheet is hydrophilic so as to help liquid transfer through the topsheet faster than if the body-facing surface was not hydrophilic so as to diminish the likelihood that menstrual liquid will flow off the topsheet rather than flowing into and being absorbed by the absorbent core. In a preferred embodiment, surfactant is incorporated into the polymeric materials of the formed film topsheet. Alternatively,<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
the body surface of the topsheet can be made hydrophilic by treating it with a surfactant.<br>
To insure proper liquid transfer between the topsheet 32 and the subjacent absorbent structure 33 it is preferred that the topsheet be substantially continuously secured to the underlying absorbent structure 33 throughout their common association or interface. In its simplest construction, the absorbent structure 33 comprises an absorbent core 34. In accordance with this construction, by substantially continuously securing the topsheet 32 to the underlying absorbent core 34, the topsheet 32 will have a reduced tendency to separate from the absorbent core 34 during use. Separation of the absorbent core from the topsheet 32 may inhibit liquid transfer from the top sheet 32 into the underlying absorbent core 34. The topsheet 32 may be secured to the absorbent core 34 in any suitable manner including, but not limited to spray gluing or applying lines or spots of adhesives between the topsheet 32 and the absorbent core 34. Alternatively, or additionally, the topsheet 32 may be secured to the absorbent core 34 by entangling the fibers of the absorbent core 34 with the topsheet 32, by fusing the topsheet 32 to the absorbent core 34 with a plurality of discrete individual fusion bonds. In the embodiments having an optional fluid acquisition layer 46, the topsheet 32 is preferably secured to this layer in the same manner described above with respect to the absorbent core 34.<br>
The topsheet 32 of the primary absorbent member 30 may be formed of one material while the topsheet 52 of the secondary absorbent member 50 may be of another material. In a preferred embodiment, topsheet 32 of the primary absorbent member 30 may be formed from an apertured film and topsheet 52 of secondary absorbent member 50 is formed from a nonwoven fabric.<br><br>
-   14   -<br>
The absorbent core 34 may be formed from any absorbent materials which are generally soft, compliant, comfortable and non-irritating to the wearer's skin and capable of absorbing and containing body exudates. Preferably, the absorbent core is compressible such that the primary absorbent member will deform under relatively small forces that are experienced during normal use. In addition to being compressible, the materials comprising the absorbent core are preferably conformable such that the primary absorbent member is able to provide improved fit into and/or around the labia and perineum. While being generally compressible and conformable under relatively small forces, those forces exerted by the external female genitalia during use, it is also important that the primary absorbent member be sufficiently resilient such that when subjected to normal wearing forces it does not permanently collapse. Preferably, the primary absorbent member will be sufficiently resilient that it will conform to the contours of the body to provide intimate contact with the exposed genitalia of the female user. Intimate contact with the exposed female genitalia helps provide better liquid transfer from the user into the primary absorbent member without allowing liquid to bypass and/or run-off the primary absorbent member. While the resilient characteristics of the absorbent core 34 allow for improved fit, they must be balanced against the need for the product to be both soft and comfortable for the wearer. The absorbent core 34 may be manufactured from a wide variety of liquid absorbent materials commonly used in disposable sanitary napkins, and other disposable absorbent articles. Examples of suitable absorbent materials include, but are not limited to comminuted wood pulp (which is generally referred to as pulp fluff), creped cellulose wadding, modified cross-linked cellulose fibers, capillary channel fibers (that is, fibers having intra-fiber capillary channels which are well known in the art), absorbent foams, thermally bonded airlaid materials, absorbent sponges, synthetic staple fibers, polymeric fibers, hydrogel-forming polymer gelling agents, peat moss, or any equivalent materials or combinations thereof.<br><br>
-   15   -<br>
The total absorbent capacity of the absorbent core 34 should be compatible with the intended exudate loading for the compound sanitary napkin 20. Further, the absorbent capacity of the absorbent core 34 may be varied to accommodate wearers ranging in the expected amount of exudate liquid volume. For instance, a different absorbent capacity may be utilized for compound sanitary napkins intended for daytime use as compared with those intended for nighttime use, or for compound sanitary napkins intended for use by teenage females as compared with those intended by more mature women.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3A and 3B, the absorbent core 34 is comprised of defiberized pulp fluff. The pulp fluff absorbent core may be manufactured in a substantially rectangular as shown in FIG 3A or cylindrical shape, as shown in FIG 3B. In either of these embodiments, the absorbent core has substantially parallel straight longitudinal side edges. In a preferred embodiment, the caliper of the absorbent core generally tapers in the transverse end regions to provide the primary absorbent member 30 with a generally thicker central region and a generally thinner end region(s). As illustrated in Figure 3C, the absorbent core may optionally be formed from absorbent foam or a combination of pulp fluff and foam. In this embodiment, the foam is folded or rolled such that it exhibits a generally circular cross-section. While the central region of the core 34 as shown in FIGS. 3B has a generally circular or slightly oval cross-section, the transverse end region of the core as shown in Figure 3C has a generally oval or oblong cross-section. The absorbent core may be manufactured in a wide variety of shapes such as rectangular, triangular, oval, square, pentagonal, U-shaped, Z-folded, etc.<br>
Optionally, the absorbent foam is preferably resilient and as illustrated in FIG. 3C forms a resilient member 45 in the primary absorbent member 30. The<br><br>
-   16   -<br>
resilient member 45 may comprise a single member or a plurality of individual members. Alternative materials which may be used to form the resilient member 45 include, but are not limited to, nylon, polypropylene, polyurethane, polyethylene, polyester, synthetic rubber, and other synthetic materials such as formed films, or natural materials such as rubber, sponges, and the like or any suitable material which is capable of resisting collapse and permanent deformation under normal wearing conditions of sanitary napkins during use. The resilient member 45 may be manufactured in a wide variety of shapes such as rectangular, triangular, oval, square, pentagonal, U-shaped, Z-folded, etc. While the primary absorbent member can be generally of any cross-sectional shape in its unstressed condition it is preferably circular or oval in cross-section.<br>
The resilient member 45 may extend throughout the entire length of the primary absorbent member 30. The resilient member 45 may only extend through a portion of the length of the primary absorbent member 30. The resilient member 45 may be positioned within the first end region 27, the central region 28, the second end region 29 or any combination of the above. For example, the resilient member 45 may be positioned in either the first end region 27 or the second end region 29 of the primary absorbent member, in both the first end region 27 and the second end region 29 of the primary absorbent member, in the central region 28 of the primary absorbent member, or in the central region 28 and the end regions 27, 29 of the primary absorbent member. In a preferred embodiment, the resilient member 45 is located in the central region 28.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 3C, the resilient member 45 and the primary absorbent member 30 is shown as having a generally circular or oval cross-sectional configuration. Preferably, the primary absorbent member exhibits a "stationary resistance" sufficient enough to provide enhanced performance. As used herein, the<br><br>
17   -<br>
term "stationary resistance" refers to the resistance exhibited by the primary absorbent member to forces applied to the primary absorbent member within the central region such that the side edges of the primary absorbent member do not extend beyond the side edges of the secondary absorbent member. In other words, the stationary resistance describes the relative movement of the primary absorbent member compared to the secondary absorbent member. It is preferred, that the longitudinally extending side edges of the primary absorbent member in its central region do not extend beyond the longitudinally extending side edges of the secondary absorbent member in its central region even under relatively high forces. By keeping the side edges of the primary absorbent member of the central region within the side edges of the central region of the secondary absorbent member, under relatively high forces, the opportunity for liquid to bypass or be expelled from the primary absorbent member and onto a surface other than the secondary absorbent member, for example, the user's skin or undergarments, is substantially reduced.<br>
One suitable apparatus for the determination of the stationary resistance includes a scale and a resistance member. A suitable scale is a Sartorius Universal Balance. The resistance member is a cylindrical rod having a diameter of 1 inch (2.54 cm). The resistance member preferably has a length of about 6 inches (15.24 cm). The resistance member may be made of any suitable material capable of withstanding the forces during the stationary resistance procedure. Suitable materials include but are not limited to steel, aluminum, plastic, and wood, etc.<br>
The procedure for the stationary resistance test described more fully in Statutory Invention Registration H1614 to Mayer et al.s which is incorporated herein in its entirety. As disclosed more fully therein, a resistance member is placed on a<br><br>
-   18   -<br>
scale. The scale is then tared to zero the scale. A compound sanitary napkin having a primary absorbent member and a secondary absorbent member is placed on the testing apparatus such that the primary absorbent member resides on resistance member. The barrier sheet portion of the secondary absorbent member should be aligned substantially parallel to the axis of the resistance member. A force is applied to each end of the secondary absorbent member. Force should be applied until the side edge of the primary absorbent member is equal with the side edge of the secondary absorbent member as viewed substantially perpendicular to the topsheet portion of the secondary absorbent member. Once the side edges of the respective primary absorbent member and secondary absorbent member are aligned, a force reading the nearest gram is recorded. This reading indicates the stationary resistance of the primary absorbent member.<br>
The primary absorbent member may exhibit a stationary resistance greater than about 600 grams. Preferably, the primary absorbent member exhibits a stationary resistance greater than or equal to 50 grams, more preferably greater than or equal to 100 grams, and most preferably greater than or equal to 150 grams.<br>
As illustrated in Figures 3 to 3C, the primary absorbent member 30 comprises a backsheet 35. The use of a separate backsheet 35 to form the primary absorbent member rather than a conventional construction which utilizes only a topsheet wrapped around the absorbent core 34 provides numerous benefits. For example, a separate topsheet 32 and backsheet 35, joined together in a flange seal construction permits greater flexibility in choosing material and material properties. Thus the topsheet may be selected from materials having superior fluid acquisition rates while the backsheet may be chosen from materials having liquid impermeability.Further in this regard, it has been found that consumers prefer that the fluid absorbed into the primary absorbent member remain in the primary<br><br>
-   19   -<br>
absorbent member and not transfer to the secondary absorbent member. Thus, a backsheet material that is selected to be liquid impermeable is preferred.   In addition, this type of flange seal construction using separate layers of material for the topsheet and backsheet increases the design options for having profiled absorbent cores, such as for example, absorbent cores having a thicker center region and tapered end regions. The backsheet 35 may optionally be liquid impervious to provide a liquid barrier that tends to contain absorbed liquids within the absorbent core 34. In accordance with this embodiment, the backsheet 35 may be constructed from materials having the same properties as the liquid impervious barrier sheet on the secondary absorbent member 50 described hereinafter. Alternatively, the backsheet 35 may be formed from liquid pervious material to permit absorbed liquids to flow through the backsheet 35 and thus be absorbed and retained by the subjacent secondary absorbent member. In accordance with this embodiment of the invention, the backsheet 35 may be constructed from materials having the same properties as the topsheet 35, as previously described.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 3A-3C, it can be seen that topsheet 32 and backsheet 35 are joined together at a peripheral edge to form a flange seal 36 to completely encase or enclose the absorbent core 34 of the primary absorbent member 30. The flange seal is preferably formed by adhesively securing the topsheet 32 to the backsheet 35 around their respective edge margins. The flange seal may alternatively be formed by other convention methods such as thermobonding, ultrasonic bonding and the like or combinations thereof. The use of a flange seal to form the outer periphery of the primary absorbent member has been found to advantageously provide a greater area of coverage for the user's body without adding significant volume to the compound sanitary napkin, The flange seal is preferably liquid impervious to prevent the lateral escape of absorbed liquids from the longitudinal side edges of the primary absorbent member.    In a preferred embodiment, the topsheet 32 is draped<br><br>
-   20   -<br>
over the absorbent core 34 such that it covers at least a portion of the longitudinal side edges of the absorbent core 34 and is then sealed to the backsheet 35 along flange seal 36. When viewed in cross section, the flange seal 36 is located between the plane defined by the topsheet 32 and the plane defined by the backsheet 35 of the primary absorbent member 30. Alternatively, the topsheet 32 drapes around the absorbent core 34 and is sealed to the backsheet 35 substantially within the same plane as the plane defined by the backsheet 35, creating what is commonly termed a positive profile.<br>
To form the compound sanitary napkin of the present invention, the primary absorbent member and the secondary absorbent member are joined by union means generally indicated as 70 in FIGS. 2 and 3A-3C. While the precise nature of the union means is not, per se, critical to the invention, it is of course important that the union means selected serves to join the primary absorbent member and the secondary absorbent member into the unitary compound sanitary napkin of the present invention with sufficient tenacity that the primary absorbent member and the secondary absorbent member do not become disconnected during use. Union means such as adhesive attachment with well known hot melt and pressure sensitive adhesives have been found to be satisfactory. If the nature of the components selected to construct the constituents of the compound sanitary napkin so permit, heat welding, ultrasonic welding, or a combination of both heat and ultrasonic welding can be used.<br>
Referring again to Figures 2 and 3A-3C, the backsheet 35 of the primary absorbent member 30 is affixed to the topsheet 52 of the secondary absorbent member 50 at union means 70. The compound sanitary napkin has a union means width 41, which is the distance across the union means 70. The union means width 41 may be the same or less than the width of the primary absorbent member. In a<br><br>
-   21   -<br>
preferred embodiment, the union means 70 has a width 41 that is less than the width of the primary absorbent member and a width that is substantially the same as the width of the primary absorbent member in the transverse end regions. In accordance with this embodiment of the invention, it has been found that having union means width 41 that is substantially the same as the width of the primary absorbent member in the transverse end regions of the compound napkin, that the stability and resistance to deformation of the compound napkin of the present invention while in use by a wearer is significantly enhanced. Preferably, the union means width 41 is preferably less than 75% of the width of the central region of the primary absorbent member 30, more preferably the union means width 41 is less than 50% of the width of the central region of the primary absorbent member 30 and most preferably the union means width 41 is less than 25% of the width of the central region of the primary absorbent member 30. The stability of the compound napkin may be further enhanced by extending the union means longitudinally from the transverse end regions along the longitudinally extending side edges of the primary absorbent member. That is, the primary absorbent member of the compound napkin exhibits less rolling or bunching in its transverse end region due to an extended union means adjacent the longitudinal side edges of the primary absorbent member. Preferably the union means extends along the longitudinal side edges of the primary absorbent member from its transverse end to a point about 0.5 mm to about 5 mm. It is preferred that the union means substantially follow the shape of the longitudinally extending side edges of the primary absorbent member. The union means need not be continuous throughout the transverse end region, i.e. from one edge to an opposite edge, and the union means may optionally be provided solely along the longitudinally extending side edges while the central region of the primary absorbent member is substantially free of any union means in the transverse end regions.<br><br>
-   22   -<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the union means 41 is in the form of a continuous line of affixation extending substantially along the entire common length of the primary and secondary member. In accordance with an alternative embodiment, the union means 41 may be in the form of discrete points of affixation in a spaced apart orientation. In accordance with this embodiment, the primary absorbent member may be affixed to the secondary absorbent member by union means in such a manner that the longest unattached distance between adjacent points of attachment is less than 75% of the common length. Optionally, the primary absorbent member is affixed to the secondary absorbent member by union means in such a manner that the longest unattached distance between adjacent points of attachment is less than 50% of the common length. Optionally, the primary absorbent member is affixed to the secondary absorbent member by union means in such a manner that the longest unattached distance between adjacent points of attachment is less than 25% of the common length. Optionally, the primary absorbent member is affixed to the secondary absorbent member by union means extending along substantially their entire common length. In a preferred embodiment, the union means 70 is in the form of a longitudinally extending adhesive line or stripe along the longitudinal centerline of the primary absorbent member and the secondary absorbent member wherein the width of the stripe is less than the width of the primary absorbent member. Additionally, it is preferred that the union means extend substantially across the entire width of the transverse end regions of the primary absorbent member. In a preferred embodiment, the union means extends along substantially the entire length of the primary absorbent member.<br>
Referring again to FIG 3C, the primary absorbent member 30 may optionally comprise a liquid acquisition layer 46 positioned between the topsheet 32 and the absorbent core 34. The liquid acquisition layer 46 may serve several functions<br><br>
-   23   -<br>
including improving wicking of exudates over and into the absorbent core 34. By improving the wicking of exudates, the acquisition layer provides a more even distribution of the exudates throughout the absorbent core. The acquisition layer 46 may be comprised of several different materials including nonwoven or woven webs of synthetic fibers including polyester, polypropylene, or polyethylene; natural fibers including cotton or cellulose; blends of such fibers; or any equivalent materials or combinations of materials. In a preferred embodiment, the acquisition layer 46 may be joined with the topsheet by any of the conventional means for joining webs together such as for example using adhesive, thermo-bonding techniques, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the liquid acquisition sheet has a contoured shape    . wherein the transverse end regions have a width that is greater than the width in a center region.<br>
Referring again to FIGS. 1-3C, the compound sanitary napkin of the present invention also possess a secondary absorbent member 50. The secondary absorbent member 50 preferably comprises a liquid permeable topsheet 52, a liquid impervious barrier sheet 54 joined with the topsheet 52, and an optional absorbent element 56 positioned between the topsheet 52 and the barrier sheet 54.<br>
The topsheet 52 of the secondary absorbent member 50 can be any liquid pervious material commonly used in sanitary napkins, disposable diapers, and the like and includes any of the materials described above as being useful in the topsheet 32 of the primary absorbent member 30. A preferred topsheet 52 comprises an apertured formed film. Apertured formed films are preferred for the topsheet because they are pervious to body exudates and yet non-absorbent and have a reduced tendency to allow liquids to pass back through and re-wet the wearer's skin. Thus, the surface of the formed film which is in contact with the body remains dry, thereby reducing body soiling and creating a more comfortable feel for the wearer.<br><br>
-   24   -<br>
The absorbent element 56 can be any absorbent material commonly used in sanitary napkins, disposable diapers, and the like and can be any of the materials described above as being useful in the absorbent core 34 of the primary absorbent member 30. However, since the absorbent core 34 of the primary absorbent member is adapted to absorb and contain most of the bodily liquids, a major function of the secondary absorbent member 50 is to protect the user's garments from soiling by absorbed liquids which may be expelled from the primary absorbent member or which may inadvertently bypass the primary absorbent member. Because the absorbent core 34 is preferably intended to absorb most or substantially all of the bodily liquids during use, its absorptive capacity is preferably somewhat if not significantly greater than that of the absorbent element 56 and the absorbent element 56 can be, and most preferably is, somewhat thinner, less bulky, and/or formed of materials having less absorptive capacity than the absorbent core 34. Thus, in accordance with an optional embodiment of the present invention, the overall absorptive capacity of the absorbent element 56 is somewhat less than that of the absorbent core 34. For example, single or multiple plies of paper tissue as commonly used in paper toweling or toilet tissue can be used to form the absorbent element 56. Preferably, the absorbent element 56 is formed of from about 1 to about 5 plies of paper tissue. Paper tissue comprising one or more plies having a basis weight of from about 24 to about 48 grams per square meter and an apparent density of from about 0.10 to about 0.12 grams per cubic centimeter has been found to be quite satisfactory for use as the absorbent element 56. Wet strength resins and latex binders can be, and preferably are, used to provide additional strength to the paper tissue used in the absorbent element.<br>
The secondary absorbent member may be manufactured with or without an absorbent element. Since most if not all of the bodily liquids are preferably absorbed<br><br>
-   25   -<br>
by and are contained within the absorbent core of the primary absorbent member, the secondary absorbent member 50 need only to protect the user's garments from soiling by relatively small amounts of liquids which may be expelled from the primary absorbent member or which may inadvertently bypass the primary absorbent member. Accordingly, since the expected amounts of liquids which may come into contact with the secondary absorbent are relatively small, an absorbent element may not be necessary to contain the liquids within the secondary absorbent member and prevent them from soiling the user's garments.<br>
The barrier sheet 54 is constructed of flexible materials that are impervious to liquids (e.g., menses and/or urine) to prevent exudates which may be expelled from or which inadvertently bypass the primary absorbent member and exudates absorbed and contained in the absorbent element 56 from contacting and soiling the user's undergarments. In use, the barrier sheet 54 is interposed between the absorbent element 56 and the user's undergarments. As used herein, the term "flexible" refers to materials which are soft, compliant and will readily conform to the general shape and contours of the human body. The barrier sheet 54 may thus comprise a woven or nonwoven fabric material that has been treated to make it liquid impervious, a thin polymeric film such as thermoplastic films of polyethylene, polypropylene or composite materials-such as a film-coated nonwoven material. Preferably, the barrier sheet is a polyethylene film having a thickness of from about 0.012 mm (0.5 mil) to about 0.015 mm (2.0 mil). Exemplary polyethylene films are manufactured by Clopay Plastic Products Co. having an address at 312 Walnut St Cincinnati, OH 45202, Huntsman Packaging having an address at 230 Enterprise Drive, Newport News, VA 23603, Tredegar Industries having an address at 1100 Boulders Parkway, Richmond, VA 23225, Exxon Chemical Co. having an address at 750 West Lake Cook Road, Buffalo Grove, Illinois 60089. The barrier sheet is preferably embossed and/or matte finished to provide a more cloth-like appearance.<br><br>
-   26   -<br>
Further, the barrier sheet may permit vapors to escape from the absorbent element 56 (i.e., breathable) while still preventing exudates from passing through the bamer<br>
sheet.<br>
Preferably, the secondary absorbent member 50 is provided with an attachment means, such as adhesive attachment means 58 for securing the compound sanitary napkin 20 in the crotch portion of the user's undergarment. Thus, a portion or all of the outer or garment surface 55 of the barrier sheet 54 is coated with adhesive. In a preferred embodiment, at least a portion of the adhesive 58 is positioned on the garment surface 55 of the barrier sheet 54 adjacent the longitudinal side edges 21 of the secondary absorbent member. Any adhesive or glue used in the art for such purposes can be used for the adhesive herein, with pressure-sensitive adhesives being preferred. Suitable adhesives include hot melt adhesives such as HL 1417xzp adhesive and HL 1491xzp adhesive which are commercially available from HB Fuller Corporation St. Paul, MN 55110 or H2262 adhesive and H2543 adhesive which are commercially available from ATO Findley Inc. Wauwatosa, WI53226. The pressure-sensitive adhesive is typically covered with a removable release liner 59 in order to keep the adhesive from drying out or adhering to a surface other than the crotch portion of the undergarment prior to use. Any commercially available release liners commonly used for such purposes can be utilized herein. A suitable release liner is commercially available from Tekkote Corporation, Leonia, NJ 07605. The compound sanitary napkin 20 of the present invention is used by removing the release liner 50 and thereafter placing the sanitary napkin in an undergarment so that the adhesive 58 contacts the undergarment. The adhesive 58 maintains the sanitary napkin in its position within the undergarment during use.<br>
The secondary absorbent member of the present invention is preferably relatively thin and flexible. Preferably, the secondary absorbent member will have a<br><br>
-   27   -<br>
caliper of less than about 3.0 millimeters, more preferably less than about 2.6 millimeters, more preferably less than about 2.2 millimeters, and most preferably less than about 2.0 millimeters. The caliper of the compound sanitary napkin, the primary absorbent member or the secondary absorbent member, mcluding various regions thereof, may conveniently be determined by the following test. A comparator gauge, and specifically the Ames, Model 130 with dial indicator Model 482, available from the B.C. Ames Company of Waltham, Mass, is needed. The comparator gauge should have a circular comparator foot made of aluminum and having a weight of 10.0 grams and a contact surface of 5.16 square centimeters. The comparator gauge is zeroed. An 80.0 grams stainless steel weight is placed on the spindle extending above the comparator dial. The comparator foot is raised and the absorbent member (with any undergarment adhesive release paper being removed and adhesive sprinkled with corn starch) is placed garment surface down on the base plate. The absorbent member is positioned on the base plate so that when the foot is lowered it is in the region of the absorbent member for which the measurement is desired. The surface of the absorbent member being evaluated should be smooth and any wrinkles in the absorbent member should be avoided. The foot should be gently lowered onto the secondary absorbent member and the caliper determined by readmg the comparator dial 30 seconds after the foot comes in contact with the absorbent member.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, the secondary absorbent member 50 has a length 60 and a width 61. The secondary absorbent member preferably has a length of from about 20 cm to 40 cm, more preferably from about 25 cm to 35 cm, and most preferably is about 30 cm long. While it can be of generally any cross-section in its unstressed condition, the secondary absorbent member preferably has a width of from about 5 to 15 cm, more preferably from about 5 to 10 cm, and most preferably from about 5 to 8 cm. In this embodiment of the invention, the primary absorbent<br><br>
-   28   -<br>
member 30 and the secondary absorbent member 50 have a common length 65 and a common width in the end regions 27 and 29.<br>
The thickness of the secondary absorbent member 50, as shown in cross-section in FIGS. 2 and 3A-3C, is substantially less than its width. Because the primary absorbent member performs different functions than that of the secondary absorbent member, the dimensions, properties and characteristics of the materials forming the primary absorbent member and a secondary absorbent member may be distinct from one another. One major function of the primary absorbent member is to absorb and contain bodily liquids. In addition, the primary member is preferably sized and shaped such that it comfortably fits within the user's groin region. Accordingly, the width and/or diameter of the primary absorbent member in a center region should be sized such that it will reside comfortably within the user's groin region. Optionally, a portion of the primary absorbent member may fit within the labia during use. In a preferred embodiment, the primary absorbent member has a volume that is sufficient to maintain contact with at least a portion of the user's groin region in use and to gently compress the user's labia majora. Since the exposed female genitalia, including the labia, are generally referred to as soft body tissue, it is important that the materials comprising and the primary absorbent member be comfortable and relatively soft such that they are non-irritating and/or uncomfortable for the user. In contrast, one major function of the secondary absorbent member is to protect the user's garments from soiling by absorbed liquids which may be expelled from the primary absorbent member or which may inadvertently bypass the primary absorbent member.<br>
In accordance with one preferred embodiment of the invention, the primary absorbent member and the secondary absorbent member have a substantially rectangular shape and the width of the secondary absorbent member is at least 1.5<br><br>
-   29   -<br>
times the width of the primary absorbent member, preferably twice the width and most preferably from 3 to 8 times the width of the primary absorbent member. In accordance with an alternative preferred embodiment, the secondary absorbent member has a contoured shape and the width of the secondary absorbent member in the central region is about 1.5 times the width of the primary absorbent member in the central region while the width of the secondary absorbent member in the transverse end regions is about 2 times the width of the primary absorbent member. More preferably, the width of the secondary absorbent member in the central region is at least 2 times the width of the primary absorbent member in the central region. Most preferably, the width of the secondary absorbent member in the central region is in the range from about 3 to about 8 times the width of the primary absorbent member in the central region. Preferably, the secondary absorbent member is about the same length as the primary absorbent member while the compound sanitary napkin is in an unstressed condition. However, it is quite possible for the secondary absorbent member to be somewhat longer than the primary absorbent member is and still function effectively.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, in accordance with a first embodiment, the compound sanitary napkin 30 has a first end region 27, a central region 28, and a second end region 29. As shown, both the primary absorbent member and the secondary absorbent member have a generally rectangular shape. While the secondary absorbent member is shown has a generally rectangular shape, other suitable shapes for the secondary absorbent member include but are not limited to oval, hourglass, dog-bone, asymmetric, etc.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, another preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated wherein the compound napkin is provided with two side flaps 19. In accordance with this embodiment, the two side flaps 19 are adjacent to and extend<br><br>
-   30   -<br>
laterally from the side edges of the absorbent element 56 of the secondary absorbent member 50. The flaps 19 are flexible and configured to be folded over the edges of the wearer's panties in the crotch region so that the flaps are disposed between the edges of the wearer's panties and the wearer's thighs. The flaps serve at least two purposes; first to prevent soiling of the wearer's body and panties by menstrual liquid, preferably by forming a double wall barrier along the edges of the undergarment, and second, the flaps are provided with attachment means on their' garment facing surface so that the flaps can be folded back under the undergarment and attached to the garment facing side of the undergarment to keep the sanitary napkin properly positioned in the undergarment.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the flaps are comprised of a laminate of integral and contiguous extensions of the topsheet and barrier sheet of the secondary absorbent member. In accordance with this embodiment, the topsheet and barrier sheet simply extend laterally outward from the edge of the absorbent element 56 to form the flaps. However, the flaps need not be unitary, continuous extensions of the component layers (i.e. topsheet or barrier sheet) of the secondary absorbent member, and may comprise separate elements which are affixed to the secondary absorbent member. Further, the flaps can be comprised of a single substrate or other laminae configurations. It is preferred, however, that the flaps have a liquid impervious barrier sheet to prevent exudates which reach the flaps from soiling the edges of the wearer's panties.<br>
Further, the flaps may optionally be provided with a thin layer of absorbent material, preferably extending laterally outward from the longitudinal side edges in an amount sufficient that when placed in a crotch region of an undergarment, the thin layer of absorbent material extends beyond the edges of the wearer's panties. Theoretically, only a relatively small amount of menses should reach the flaps,<br><br>
-   31   -<br>
therefore, only a relatively small amount of absorbent material is desirable in the flaps in an amount sufficient to prevent any exudates that reach the flaps from being able to flow further to unprotected areas. The absorbent material may be a tissue, or a relatively thinner extension of the absorbent element 56. However, the absorbent material in the flaps should be relatively highly flexible.<br>
A number of sanitary napkins having flaps suitable or adaptable for use with the secondary absorbent member 50 of the compound sanitary napkin 20 of the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,687,478 issued to Van Tilburg on Aug. 18, 1987; U.S. Pat. No. 4,589,876 issued to Van Tilburg on May 20,1986; and U.S. Pat No. 4,608,047 issued to Mattingly on Aug. 26,1986. Each of these patents are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The flaps are preferably folded over the topsheet of the secondary absorbent member or both the secondary absorbent member and the primary absorbent member. More particularly, each flap has a proximal end that is coincident with the longitudinal side edges of the secondary absorbent member and a freely extending distal end opposite the proximal end. The flaps preferably have an attachment means such as adhesive on a garment facing side thereof that is adapted to releasably affix the flaps to an underside of the undergarment in use. The distal ends of the flaps are folded over the topsheet of the secondary absorbent member and preferably releasably secured in this orientation prior to use by a wearer of the compound sanitary napkin. One method for releasably securing the flaps in the folded orientation is by a single strip of release paper that extends from one flap across the topsheet of the compound napkin to the opposite flap and is releasably affixed to the adhesive on the garment facing side of the flaps.<br><br>
-   32   -<br>
Alternatively, as shown in FIG 5, the flaps may be folded over the topsheet of the secondary absorbent member such that the distal ends of the flaps are inserted between the primary absorbent member 30 and the secondary absorbent member 50 in the region intermediate the union means 70 and the longitudinal side edge of the primary absorbent member. Thus, in accordance with this embodiment, the union means in a central region of the primary absorbent member has a width that is less than the width of the primary absorbent member. Since the union means is located inward from the longitudinal side edges of the primary absorbent member, there exists an unaffixed region in the form of a pocket between the primary absorbent member and the secondary absorbent member.   The distal ends of the flaps may be inserted into this region or pocket between the primary absorbent member and the secondary absorbent member and maintained in this orientation prior to use by a wearer of the compound sanitary napkin. Depending of course on the length of the flaps (as measured between the proximal end and the distal end) it may be advantageous to form a second fold within the body of the flap and to insert this second folded region between the primary absorbent member and the secondary member.<br>
The individual components of the primary absorbent member 30 and/or the secondary absorbent member 50 may be comprised of components that are extensible (preferably, capable of stretching) particularly in the longitudinal direction when the compound sanitary napkin is worn. Preferably, the compound sanitary napkin is capable of elongating in the longitudinal direction between about 15% and about 40% of its unstretched length. This extensibility provide better in-use fit, comfort, and decreased staining when the compound sanitary napkin is affixed to the wearer's undergarments.<br><br>
-   33   -<br>
Preferably, the secondary absorbent member is comprised of components that are also extensible in the lateral direction when the compound sanitary napkin is worn. Preferably, the compound sanitary napkin is capable of elongating in the lateral direction between about 15% and about 40% of its unstretched length. The topsheet for both the primary absorbent member and the secondary absorbent member may comprise an elastic, three-dimensional, liquid pervious, polymeric web.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 6 and 7, there is shown another preferred embodiment of a compound sanitary napkin 20 of the present invention wherein the primary absorbent member 30 and the secondary absorbent member 50 have different lengths and widths. The primary absorbent member 30 has a length 40 that is somewhat less than the length 60 of the secondary absorbent member 50.<br>
Several specific non-limiting embodiments of the compound sanitary napkins of the present invention are shown in FIGS. 8-16. An example of a primary absorbent member having a Z-folded resilient member 45 is shown in FIG. 8. In accordance with this embodiment, the absorbent core 34 is positioned between the topsheet 100 and the resilient member 45 of the primary absorbent member 30. The resilient member 45 has a substantially U-shaped cross-section and causes the primary absorbent member 30 to have a generally U-shaped cross-section. The resiliency of the resilient member 45 is preferably not affected by the presence of body exudates absorbed by and contained within the absorbent core. The sustained resiliency of the resilient member 45 permits the primary absorbent member 30 to maintain intimate contact with the body of the wearer during use. Positioning the absorbent core 34 between the topsheet 32 and the resilient member 45 helps to provide intimate contact between the absorbent core 34 and the topsheet 32. Intimate contact between the topsheet and the absorbent core through bonding or pressure<br><br>
-   34   -<br>
applied by the resilient member is described to promote liquid transfer from the topsheet into the underlying absorbent core.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 9 there is shown a cross-sectional view taken along the longitudinal axis of another embodiment of a compound sanitary napkin 20 of the present invention. The primary absorbent member 30 includes an absorbent core 34 comprised of a relatively low density layer 72, a relatively high density layer 73, a plurality of resilient fibers 74, and absorbent gelling material 75 dispersed on and within the high density layer 73. The absorbent gelling material 75 is dispersed primarily within the first and second end regions 27, 29 of the primary absorbent member 30. The relatively low density layer 72 is preferably comprised of a thermally bonded airlaid material. The relatively high density layer 73 is preferably comprised of a thermally bonded airlaid material. The resilient fibers are preferably polyester capillary channel fibers.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, there is shown another embodiment of a compound sanitary napkin 120. The compound sanitary napkin 120 comprises a primary absorbent member 130 and a secondary absorbent member 150. The primary absorbent member 130 includes an apertured formed film topsheet 132, an acquisition element 140, a distribution element 145, absorbent core layer 150, a first resilient member 155, second resilient member 157 and barrier layer 135.

As can be seen in FIG. 13, the resilient member 216 has a substantially inverted U-shaped cross-section. Accordingly, the primary absorbent member 210 likewise has a substantially inverted U-shaped cross-section. Preferably, the resilient member 216 extends throughout substantially the entire length of the primary absorbent member 210. The<br><br>
-   36   -<br>
topsheet 212 and barrier layer 235 are sealed together along their respective outer peripheral edge margins to form flange seal 236 to fully enclose absorbent core 214 and resilient member 216.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13 there is shown another preferred embodiment of a compound sanitary napkin 240 of the present invention. Compound sanitary napkin 240 preferably comprises a primary absorbent member 245 having a topsheet 32, barrier sheet 35 which are sealed about their peripheral edge margins to form flange seal 36 and a secondary absorbent member 250. As can be seen in FIG. 13 the compound sanitary napkin 240 preferably has a substantially horizontal segment 255 and an upwardly curved segment 257. The horizontal segment 255 resides within first end region 27 and central region 28. Upwardly curved segment 257 resides within second end region 29. Preferably, the upwardly curved segment 257 includes a tensioning means which provides ample tension to create the curvature in the second segment 257. Suitable tensioning means include but are not limited to a tensioned topsheet, an elastic material, thread, film, or any suitable means to provide the desired tension. Optionally, the segment residing within the first end region 27 may also be upwardly curved.<br>
As seen in FIG. 13 the primary absorbent member 245 and the secondary absorbent member 250 are joined together throughout their entire common length. That is, they are joined together throughout segments 255 and 257. Optionally, they may be joined together in the first segment 255 and may separate from one another in the rear segment 257 as shown in FIG. 14. In this embodiment, the secondary absorbent member 250 remains substantially in the same plane throughout segments 255 and 257 while in an unstressed condition. The primary absorbent member 245 positioned within the second segment 257 curves upward away from and separates itself from the secondary absorbent member 250. The segment 257 generally<br><br>
-   37   -<br>
corresponds with the second end region 29. The primary absorbent member may also curve upwardly within the first end region 27.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 15 and 16, there is shown another embodiment of the compound sanitary napkin 320 of the present invention. The compound sanitary napkin 320 comprises a segmented primary absorbent member 330 and a secondary absorbent member 340. The primary absorbent member comprises individual absorbent components 331, 332 and 333, which together define primary absorbent member 330. As shown in FIGS. 15 and 16, segment 331 lies wholly within first end region 27, segment 332 resides wholly within central region 28, and segment 333 resides wholly within second end region 39. Optionally, the primary absorbent member may comprise two components which extend from the end regions 27 and 29 into the central region 28. Optionally, the primary absorbent member may be comprised of 4 or more individual components. While the primary absorbent member having multiple components is shown in FIGS. 15 and 16 as extending throughout the length of the compound sanitary napkin, it may be desirable to have some segments or some regions of the compound sanitary napkin having no primary absorbent member. For example, the first end region 27 and central region 28 may comprise an primary absorbent constituent where second end region 29 comprises only a secondary absorbent member. Moreover the primary absorbent members within the various regions may be designed to perform specific functions and therefore may be made of materials to perform the desired functions. For example, the primary absorbent segment 332 within central region 28 may contain a greater capacity of absorbent material than that of segments 331 or segments 333 since segment 332 will likely be positioned such that it will receive the bodily liquids directly, whereas the elements or segment 331 or 333 will likely receive and therefore have less capacity than that of the segment 332 within central region 28.<br><br>
-   38   -<br>
It may be desirable to provide a compound sanitary napkin having a primary absorbent member with varying degrees of caliper throughout its length. For example, the primary absorbent member may be relatively thicker in the central region as opposed to the end regions. Alternatively, the primary absorbent member may be relatively thinner in the central region as opposed to the end regions.<br>
While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of this invention.<br><br><br>
