				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>A subject of the present invention is new compounds of 2- (iminomethyl)amino-phenyl which have an inhibitor activity on NO-synthase enzymes producing nitrogen monoxide NO and/or an activity which traps the reactive oxygen species (ROS). The invention relates to the compounds corresponding to general formula 00 defined below, their preparation methods, the pharmaceutical preparations containing them and their use for therapeutic purposes, in particular their use as NO-synthase inhibitors and selective or non selective traps for reactive oxygen species.<br>
Given the potential role of NO and the ROS's in physiopathology, the new compounds described corresponding to general formula (I) may produce beneficial or favourable effects in the treatment of pathologies where these chemical species are involved. In particular:<br>
• cardio-vascular and eerebro-vascular disorders including for example artherosclerosis, migraine, arterial hypertension, septic shock, ischemic or hemorragic cardiac or cerebral infarctions, ischemias and thromboses.<br>
• disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system such as for example neurodegenerative diseases where there can in particular be mentioned cerebral infarctions, sub-arachnoid haemorrhaging, ageing, senile dementias including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease, Creutzfeld Jacob disease and prion diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis but also pain, cerebral and bone marrow traumas, addiction to opiates, alcohol and addictive substances, erective and reproductive disorders, cognitive disorders, encephalopathies, encephalopathies of viral or toxic origin.<br>
disorders of the skeletal muscle and neuromuscular joints (myopathy, myosis) as well as cutaneous diseases.<br>
proliferative and inflammatory diseases such as for example artherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, respiratory distress, glomerulonephritis, portal hypertension, psoriasis, arthrosis and rheumatoid arthritis, fibroses, amyloidoses, inflammations of the gastro-intestinal system (colitis, Crohn's disease) or of the pulmonary system and airways (asthma, sinusitis, rhinitis).<br><br>
•	organ transplants.<br>
•	auto-immune and viral diseases such as for example lupus, AIDS, parasitic and<br>
viral infections, diabetes, multiple sclerosis.<br>
•	cancer.<br>
•	neurological diseases associated with intoxications (Cadmium poisoning, inhalation<br>
of n-hexane, pesticides, herbicides), associated with treatments (radiotherapy) or<br>
disorders of genetic origin (Wilson's disease).<br>
•	all the pathologies characterized by an excessive production or dysfunction of NO<br>
and/or ROS's.<br>
In all these pathologies, there is experimental evidence demonstrating the involvement of NO or ROS's (/. Med. Chem. (1995) 38, 4343-4362; Free Radio. Biol. Med. (1996) 20, 675-705; The Neuroscientist (1997) 3, 327-333).<br>
Furthermore, NO Synthase inhibitors, their use and more recently the combination of these inhibitors with products having antioxidant or antiradicular properties have already been described in previous Patents (respectively US Patent 5,081.148: US Patent 5,360,925 and an unpublished Patent Application).<br>

According to the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) cari be prepared by the process described below.<br>
Preparation of compounds of general formula ••(!):<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared from intermediates of general<br>
formula (II) according to diagram 1.<br>
The reduction of the nitro function of the intermediates of general formula (II) is<br>
generally carried out by catalytic ;hydrogenation in ethanol, in the presence of Pd/C, except when X = -CH=CH-GO- or Y = -0-CH2-, the nitro group is selectively reduced .using,.for example, SnCl2 (/. Heterocyclic Chem. (1987), 24, 927-930; Tetrahedron Letters (1984), 25, (8), 839-842), The reaction is then carried out by heating the mixture to approx. 70°C, for at least three .hours,.in ethyl acetate, sornetimes with added ethanol.<br>
The aniline' compounds of general formula (III) thus obtained can be condensed on compounds of general formula (IV), for example compounds of 0-alkyl thioimidate or S-alkyl thioimidate type, in order to produce final compounds of general formula (I) (cf. diagram 1). For example, for B = miophene, the compounds of general'formula (III) can be condensed on S-methylthiophene thiocarboxamide hydriodide, prepared according to a method in the literature (Ann.   Chim.  (1962),. 7,   303-337). Condensation can be carried out by-heating in an alcohol (for example in methanol or isopropanol), optionally in the presence of DMF at a temperature comprised between 50 and 100°C for a duration generally comprised between a few hours and overnight.<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Preparation of intermediates of general formula (II);<br>
The intermediates of general formula (II) can be prepared by different processes depending on the chemical functions which are set up: amines, carboxamides, ureas, thioureas, sulphonamides, aminosulphonylureas, sulphamides, carbamates, ethers, esters, thioethers, acylureas, etc.:<br>
When:	X =     linear or branched alkylene radical having from 1 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms<br>
and Y = piperazine, homopiperazine, 2-methylpiperazine, 2,5-dimethyl-piperazine, 4-aminopiperidine, -NR3-Z2-Q-, -NR3-NH-CO-Z2-, -NH-NH-Z2-, -NR3-O-Z2-<br>
The amines of general formula (II), diagram 2, in which A, X, Y and Rg are as defined above, can be obtained by nucleophile substitution of the halogenated compounds; of general formula (VI) by an amine of general formula (VII). The reaction is carried out, for example, in DMF in the presence of K^COa at 20° C. The halogenated compounds of general formula (VI) can be accessed, for example, by brornation of the primary alcohols of general formula (V) using PBr3, at 0°C, in anhydrous THF. The alcohols of general formula (V) which are not commercially<br><br>
available can be prepared according to methods described in the literature (Tetrahedron Lett. (1983), 24, (24), 2495-2496).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The amines of general formula (VII) in which Y represents homopiperazine, 2,5-dimethylpiperazine, 4-aminopiperidine or more generally -NR3-Z2-NR3- are synthesized in three stages from the corresponding commercial diamines. The diamines are selectively mono-protected in the form of the carbamate (Synthesis (1984), (12), 1032-1033; Synth. Commun. (1990), 20, (16), 2559-2564) before reaction by nucleophile substitution on a fluoronitrobenzene, in particular 4-fluoronitrobenzene. The amines, previously protected, are released at the last stage, according to methods described in the literature (T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition (Wiley-Interscience, 1991)), in order to produce intermediates of general formula (VII).<br>
When:	X = -Z^CO-, -CH=CH-CO-<br>
and Y = piperazine, homopiperazine, 2-methylpiperazine, 2,5-dimethylpiperazine, 4-aminopiperidine, -NR3-Z2-Q-, -NR3-NH-CO-Z2-, -NH-NH-Z2-, -NR3-O-Z2-<br>
The carboxamides of general formula (II), diagram 3, in which A, X, Y and Rg are as defined above, are prepared by condensation of the commercial carboxylic acids of general formula (VIII) for X = -Zi-CO- and of general formula (IX) for X = -CH=CH-CO- with amines of general formula (VII). The non commercial acids can be synthesized according to methods similar to those described in the literature (J. Org. Chem. (1974), 39 (2), 219-222; /. Amer. Chem. Soc. (1957), 79, 5019-5023, and CHIMIA (1991), 45 (4), 121-123 when A represents a 6-alkoxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane radical). The amines of general formula (VII) in which Y represents homopiperazine, 2,5-dimethylpiperazine, 4-aminopiperidine, or more generally -NR3-Z2-NR3- are prepared according to methods similar to those described<br>
in the previous paragraph. The carboxamide bonds are formed under standard conditions for peptide synthesis (M. Bodanszky and A. Bodanszky, The Practice of Peptide Synthesis, 145 (Springer-Verlag, 1984)) in THF, dichloromethane or DMF in the presence of a coupling reagent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), l.l'-carbonyldiimidazole (GDI) (J. Med. Chem. (1992), 35 (23), 4464-4472) or 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC or WSCI) (John Jones, The chemical synthesis of peptides, 54 (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1991)).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The carboxamides of general formula (II) in which A, X, Y and Re are as defined above can also be prepared, as in diagram 4, by peptide condensation of an amine of general formula (X) with a commercial acid of general formula (XI). When X = -NR3-CO- and RS = H, the compounds of general formula (X) are anilines which are obtained by hydrogenation, in the presence of a catalytic quantity of Pd/C, the corresponding nitrobenzene derivatives, themselves synthesized according to a method described in the literature (/. Org. Chem. (1968), 33 (1), 223-226). When X * -NRs-CO- and RS is a linear or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, the monoalkylamines can be obtained according to a process described in the literature (U.S. Patents 3,208,859 and 2,962,531). The non-commercial carboxylic acids of general formula (XI) can be accessed using methods described in the literature (Acta Chem. Scand. (1983), 37, 911-916; Synth. Commun. (1986), 16 (4), 479-483; Phophoms, Sulphur Silicon Relat. Elem. (1991), 62, 269-273).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The ureas of general formula (II), diagram 5, in which A, X, Y and Rf, are as defined above, are prepared by the addition of an amine of general formula (X) on an isocyanate of general formula (XII), (XIII) or (XIV) in a solvent such as chloroform at 20°C. Synthesis of non-commercial isocyanates of general formula (XII) is described in the literature (J. Med. Chem. (1992), 35 (21), 3745-3754). The halogenated intermediate ureas (XV) and (XVII) are then substituted by a derivative of general formula (XVI), in which Q represents O-Z3-, R3-N-Z3- or S-Z3-, in the presence of a base such as, for example, K2CO3 or NaH in an aprotic solvent such as THF or DMF in order to finally obtain ureas of general formula (II).<br><br>

When:	X = -ZrNH-CO-<br>
and Y = piperazine, homopiperazine, 2-methylpiperazine, 2,5-dimethylpiperazine, 4-aminopiperidine, -NRs-Z2-Q-, -NR3-NH-CO-Z2-, -NH-NH-Z2-, -NR3-O-Z2-<br>
The ureas of general formula (II), diagram 6, in which A, X, Y and R6 are as defined above, are prepared by the addition of an amine of general formula (VII), described previously, onto an isocyanate of general formula (XVIII) in the presence of a base such as diisopropylethylamine.<br>
The isocyanates of general formula (XVIII) are synthesized from primary amines of general formula (X), described previously, triphosgene and a tertiary amine (7. Org. Chem. (1994), 59 (7), 1937-1938).<br>

Med. Chem.. (1996), 39 (6), 1243-1252). The intermediate chlorosulphonylurea (XIX) is then condensed on the amines of general formula (VII), described previously, in order to produce the aminosulphonylureas of general formula (II) which can optionally be alkylated by a halogenated compound in the presence of a base such as, for example, NaH in order to produce compounds of general formula (II).<br>

The halogenoalkylsulphonamides of general formula (XXI), obtained<br>
intermediately, are then condensed on an alcohol, an amine or a thiol of general formula (XVI) in the presence of a base such as, for example, K2CO3 or NaH, in a polar solvent such as, for example, acetonitrile or DMF.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
When:	X = -Zi-NR3-SO2-<br>
and Y = -NR3-Z2-Q-<br>
The sulphamides of general formula (II), diagram 9, in which A, X, Y and Re are as defined above are prepared in three stages from amines of general formula (X) and chlorosulphonylisocyanate. The reaction of an alcohol, such as tBuOH, on the isocyanate function of chlorosulphonylisocyanate (Tetrahedron Lett. (1991), 32 (45), 6545-6546) leads to an intermediate of chlorosulphonylcarbamate type, which reacts in the presence of an amine of general formula (X) to produce a compound of carboxylsulphamide type of general formula (XXII). The treatment of this intermediate in a strong acid medium produces the sulphamide compound of general formula (XXIII). Alkylation of the compounds of general formula (XXIII) by the halogenated derivatives of general formula (XXIV) in the presence of a base such as, for example, NaH in a polar aprotic solvent allows sulphamide compoundsof general formula (II) to be obtained. <br>

The etheroxides or thioetheroxides of general formula (II), diagram 13, in which A, X, Y and Rg are as defined above are prepared from dihydroquinones of general formula (XXVII) (J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. I, (1981), 303-306) or thiophenols of general formula (XXVIII) (Bio. Med. Chem. Letters, (1993), 3 (12), 2827-2830) and an electrophile (E+) such as, for example, bromoacetonitrile or 4-nitrophenyloxazolinone, in the presence of K2CO3 (J. Heterocyclic Chem., (1994), 31, 1439-1443). The nitriles must be reduced (lithium hydride or catalytic hydrogenation) in order to produce intermediates of general formula (XXIX) or (XXX). The opening of the nitrophenyloxazolinones, accessible by reaction of the corresponding nitroanilines with chloroethylchloroformate as described in the literature (J. Am. Chem. Soc.,( 1953), 75, 4596), by phenols or thiophenols leads directly to compounds of general formula (XXIX) or (XXX) which are then condensed on fluoronitrobenzene in order to produce intermediates of general formula (II).<br>

Pharmacological study of the products of the invention<br>
Study of the effects on neuronal constitutive NO synthase of a rat's cerebellum<br>
The inhibitory activity of the products of the invention is determined by measuring their effects on the conversion by the NO synthase of the [3H]L-arginine in [3H]L-citrulline according to the modified method of Bredt and Snyder (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, (1990) 87: 682-685). The cerebellums of Sprague-Dawley rats (300g - Charles River) are rapidly removed, dissected at 4°C and homogenized in a volume of extraction buffer (HEPES 50 mM, EDTA 1 mM, pH 7.4, pepstatin A 10 mg/ml, leupeptin 10 mg/ml). The homogenates are then centrifuged at 21000 g for 15 min at 4°C. Dosage is carried out in glass test tubes in which 100 [il of incubation buffer containing 100 mM of HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mM of EDTA, 2.5 mM of CaCl2, 2 mM of dithiotreitol, 2 mM of reduced NADPH and 10 u.g/ml of calmodulin are distributed. 25 |j,l of a solution containing 100 nM of [3H]L-arginine (Specific activity: 56.4 Ci/mmole, Amersham) and 40 \iM of non-radioactive L-arginine is added. The reaction is initiated by adding 50 |il of homogenate, the final volume being 200 pi (the missing 25 (0,1 are either water or the tested product). After 15 min, the reaction is stopped with 2 ml of stopping buffer (20 mM of HEPES, pH 5.5, 2 mM of EDTA). After placing the samples on a 1 ml column of DOWEX resin, the radioactivity is quantified by a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The compounds of examples 6, 7, 13 and 14 described above show an ICso lower than 3.5<br>
Study of the effects on lipidic peroxidation of the cerebral cortex of a rat<br>
The inhibitory activity of the products of the invention is determined by measuring their effects on the degree of lipidic peroxidation, determined by the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). The MDA produced by peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids is a good indication of lipidic peroxidation (H Esterbauer and KH Cheeseman, Meth. Enzymol. (1990) 186: 407-421). Male Sprague Dawley rats of 200 to 250 g (Charles River) were sacrificed by decapitation. The cerebral cortex is removed, then homogenized using a Thomas potter in a 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH = 7.4. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 50000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The pellet is maintained at -80°C. On the day of the experiment, the pellet is replaced in suspension at a concentration of 1 g/ 15 ml and centrifuged at 515 g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The supernatant is used immediately to determine the lipidic peroxidation. The homogenate of rat's cerebral cortex (500 (J.1) is incubated at 37° C for 15 minutes in the presence of the compounds to be tested or of solvent (10 ul). The lipidic peroxidation<br><br>
reaction is initiated by adding 50 (J.1 of FeCl2 at 1 mM, EDTA at 1 mM and ascorbic acid at 4 mM. After 30 minutes of incubation at 37°C, the reaction is stopped by adding 50 JJ.1 of a solution of hydroxylated di tertio butyl toluene (BHT, 0.2 %). The MDA is quantified using a colorimetric test, by reacting a chromogenic reagent (R), N-methyl-2-phenylindol (650 ul) with 200 ul of the homogenate for 1 hour at 45° C. The condensation of an MDA molecule with two molecules of reagent R produce a stable chromophore the maximum absorbence wavelength of which is equal to 586 nm. (Caldwell et al. European J. Pharmacol. (1995) 285, 203-206). The compounds of Examples 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26 and 27 described above all show an ICso lower than 30 uM.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
