				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention generally relates to wireless communications, and particularly<br>
relates to initializing transmit powers for secondary reverse link carriers.<br>
in some types of wireless communication networks, mobile stations are permitted to<br>
transmit reverse (ink data on two or more reverse link carriers, which may be referred to as one<br>
primary reverse fink carrier and one or more secondary reverse link carriers. By way of non-<br>
limiting example, the 1x-EVDO standards currently in development include multi-carrier<br>
provisions that allow for primary and secondary reverse link carriers.<br>
ControiSing transmit power represents a fundamental challenge in CDMA-based<br>
networks and other interference-limited communication systems, and such control<br>
considerations extend to transmit power initialization. That is, while channel feedback may be<br>
used between transmitters and receivers for ongoing transmit power control, such feedback<br>
generally is unavailable at the outset of transmission.<br>
The starting or initial transmit power of a primary reverse link carrier may be set by a<br>
mobile station based on access probing procedures. However, access probing is not performed<br>
once the primary reverse link carrier is established and therefore is not available for initializing<br>
the transmit powers) of any secondary reverse link carriers) used by the mobile station.<br>
One approach to initializing the transmit power of a secondary reverse link carrier is to<br>
set its Initial transmit power to the current level of the primary reverse link carrier. However, to<br>
the extent that conditions for the secondary reverse link carrier differ from those for the primary<br>
reverse link carrier, this approach may result in initializing the secondary reverse link carrier<br>
transmit power either too high, or too low. Initializing the transmit power too tow reduces<br>
connection success, while initializing the transmit power too high needlessly increases<br>
interference and wastes power at the mobile station.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In one embodiment, a base station controller transmits initialization power offset<br>
information for use by mobile stations in setting the initial transmit power used by them for<br>
secondary reverse link carriers. Correspondingly, in one or more embodiments, a mobile station<br>
is configured to initialize secondary reverse link carrier transmit power based on the initialization<br>
power offset information.<br>
With the above in mind, a method of initializing reverse link transmit power for secondary<br>
reverse link carriers in a wireless communication network comprises determining initialization<br>
power offset information for one or more secondary reverse link carriers as a function of reverse<br>
2<br><br>
link loading, and transmitting the initialization power offset information to a mobile station for use<br>
in initializing secondary reverse link carrier transmit power.<br>
Determining the initialization power offset information comprises, in one or more<br>
embodiments, determining reverse link loading differences relating at least one secondary<br>
reverse link carrier to a primary reverse link carrier associated with the mobile station. For<br>
example, determining the initialization power offset information may comprise determining at<br>
least one of reverse link loading differences relating one or more secondary reverse link carriers<br>
to a primary reverse link carrier, determining active set differences relating one or more<br>
secondary reverse link carriers to a primary reverse link carrier, and sector switching activity<br>
involving the mobile station.<br>
In the above and other embodiments, the initialization power offset information may<br>
comprise explicit power offset information identifying at least one power offset to be used for<br>
initializing secondary reverse link transmit power relative to a current transmit power of a<br>
primary reverse link carrier associated with the mobile station. Alternatively, the initialization<br>
power offset information may comprise Implicit power offset information indicating relative<br>
reverse link loading information for one or more secondary reverse link carriers and a primary<br>
reverse link carrier associated with the mobile station, such that the mobile station computes an<br>
initial power offset to be used for a secondary reverse link carrier as a function of the reverse<br>
link loading information.<br>
Whether implicit or explicit information is transmitted, the initialization power offset<br>
information may be sent in a traffic channel assignment message. However, it should be<br>
understood that other mechanisms for providing initialization power information to mobile<br>
stations are contemplated herein. For example, in one embodiment, a base station controller, or<br>
a corresponding radio base station, is configured to transmit reverse link loading information,<br>
such as by transmitting reverse link activity indicators. Correspondingly, a mobile station is<br>
configured to use the reverse link loading information to determine initial transmit power offsets<br>
for one or more reverse link secondary carriers relative to a primary reverse link carrier.<br>
Of course, the present invention is not limited to the above features and advantages.<br>
Indeed, those skilled in the art will recognize additional features and advantages upon reading<br>
the following detailed description, and upon viewing the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a wireless communication network 10 that is configured to support one<br>
or more embodiments of secondary reverse link carrier transmit power initialization as taught<br>
herein. By way of non-limiting example, the network 10 may be configured for CDMA-based<br>
packet date communications according to the IxEVDO standards.<br>
In operation, the network 10 communicatively couples mobile stations 12—one such<br>
terminal Is illustrated for clarity—to one or more external data networks 14. Such networks may<br>
include the Internet or other public or private packet data networks. Supporting these<br>
communications, the illustrated network 10 comprises one or more radio base stations 16, and<br>
on© or more base station controllers 18 to support the radio base stations 16. in turn, the<br>
network 10 further includes a core network (CN) 20, which may include Packet Data Serving<br>
Nodes, Authentication Servers, etc.<br>
It should be understood that a single radio base station 16 and a single corresponding<br>
base station controller 18 are illustrated for clarity; additional ones of these elements may be<br>
present in an actual network, and other elements not illustrated herein may be present as well.<br>
It should be further understood that other base station system architectures may be used to<br>
support the secondary reverse link carrier transmit power initialization operations described<br>
herein. For example, an alternative architecture consolidates base station controller and radio<br>
transceiver resources into an integrated base station entity.<br>
As for the illustrated base station architecture, Fig. 2 functionally illustrates one<br>
embodiment of the base station controller 18 comprising one or more processing circuits 30,<br>
including a power initialization controller 32. These circuits may be implemented in hardware,<br>
software, or any combination thereof. For example, the base station controller 18 may include<br>
one or more general- or special-purpose microprocessor circuits and associated program and<br>
data memory, for carrying out communication processing. More particularly, a method and<br>
apparatus for implementing secondary reverse link carrier transmit power initialization may be<br>
implemented in the base station controller 18 by way of computer program instructions stored in<br>
a computer-readable medium, and one or more corresponding microprocessors, or other logic<br>
processing circuits, configured for execution of the computer program.<br>
4<br><br>
Regardless of the implementation details, Fig. 3 illustrates one embodiment of<br>
processing logic for initializing the transmit power of a secondary reverse link carrier.<br>
Processing begins with determining initialization power offset information (Step 100), and<br>
continues with transmitting the initialization power offset information to a mobile station 12—<br>
e.g., transmitting the information through a radio base station 16 having the mobile station's<br>
current forward Ink serving sector.<br>
The base station controller 18 may consider one or more data items in determining the<br>
initialization power offset information. For example, the base station controller 18 can aggregate<br>
reverse link load information for active sets of all of the involved reverse link carriers, i.e., a<br>
primary reverse link carrier and one or more secondary reverse link carriers that are candidates<br>
for use by the mobile station 12. The base station controller 18 then computes appropriate initial<br>
transmit power offsets for the secondary carriers relative to the primary carrier. (According to a<br>
non-limiting definition used herein, the term "carrier" represents a logically or physically distinct<br>
communication channel. There may be one carrier per sector of a sectorized radio base<br>
station 16—i.e., a carrier in each of sectors S1, S2, and S3—or there may be multiple carriers in<br>
one sector, such as different carriers of different frequencies. Further, multiple carriers may be<br>
defined using different spreading codes.)<br>
With the above in mind, the action of determining the initialization power offset<br>
information (Step 100) comprises, in one or more embodiments, determining reverse link<br>
loading differences relating at least one secondary reverse link carrier to a primary reverse link<br>
carrier associated with the mobile station. As such, the initial transmit power of a secondary<br>
reverse link carrier at the mobile station 12 can be set in consideration of reverse link loading. In<br>
at least one embodiment, such consideration is based on loading differences. More particularly,<br>
determining the initialization power offset information comprises determining at least one of<br>
reverse link loading differences relating one or more secondary reverse link carriers to a primary<br>
reverse link carrier.<br>
With this method, the mobile station 12 can be controlled, or otherwise configured, to<br>
initialize transmit power for a secondary carrier at a level above a current transmit power of the<br>
mobile station's primary reverse link carrier, if the reverse link loading associated with the<br>
secondary reverse link carrier is higher than that associated with the primary reverse link carrier.<br>
Conversely, the mobile station 12 can be controlled, or otherwise configured, to initialize<br>
transmit power for a secondary carrier at a level below the current transmit power of the mobile<br>
station's primary reverse link carrier, if the reverse link loading associated with the secondary<br>
carrier is lower than that associated with the primary reverse link carrier.<br>
By way of non-limiting example, the base station controller 18 may be configured to<br>
receive sector-specific and/or carrier-specific reverse link loading estimates from the radio base<br>
stations 16 operating under its control. As a non-limiting example, loading information may be<br>
conveyed in the form of reverse activity bits (RABs), In turn, the radio base stations 16 may be<br>
5<br><br>
configured to generate loading estimates for delivery to the base station controller 18 on a<br>
periodic basfs or on an as-needed basis, in one embodiment; reverse link loading estimates are<br>
determined as a function of Rise-over-Thermal (RoT) measurements. In such embodiments, the<br>
network 10 may be configured to use "silence periods" wherein transmission activity is<br>
suspended periodically to provide quiet moments for more accurately measuring RoT at the<br>
radio receivers of the radio base stations 16. (Of course, it should be understood that other<br>
methods of measuring reverse link loading may be used, such as by tracking aggregate data<br>
throughputs, or by tracking the number of type of users being supported by the network 10.<br>
Further, load tracking may be done on a per-sector and/or per-earrier basis.)<br>
However it is determined, the initialization power offset information may be transmitted to<br>
a particular mobile station 12, or to groups of mobile stations 12, such as commonly to all<br>
mobile stations 12 operating in a given radio base station sector. In one embodiment, the<br>
initialization power offset information is transmitted as explicit offset information, i.e., computed<br>
offset values that can be used by the mobile stations 12 in setting the relative power levels<br>
initially used for their secondary reverse link carriers, In another embodiment, the initialization<br>
power offset information is transmitted in the form of sector loading information, such that the<br>
mobile stations 12 can compute offset values from the received information, tn other words, the<br>
initialization power offset information can comprise pre-computed offset values, or can comprise<br>
information relevant to the mobile stations' computations of offset values.<br>
With the above examples in mind, it will be broadly understood that one or more<br>
embodiments of a base station controller 18 as taught herein include one or more processing<br>
circuits configured to determine initialization power offset information for one or more secondary<br>
reverse link carriers as a function of reverse link loading, and transmit the initialization power<br>
offset information to a mobile station for use in initializing secondary reverse link carrier transmit<br>
power. The Information may be determined by determining reverse link loading differences<br>
relating at least one secondary reverse link carrier to a primary reverse link carrier associated<br>
with the mobile station.<br>
As noted, the (initialization power offset) Information may comprise explicit power offset<br>
information identifying at least one power offset to be used for initializing secondary reverse link<br>
transmit power relative to a current transmit power of a primary reverse link carrier associated<br>
with the mobile station 12. Alternatively, the information may comprise implicit power offset<br>
information indicating relative reverse link loading information for one or more secondary<br>
reverse link carriers and a primary reverse link carrier associated with the mobile station, such<br>
that the mobile station 12 computes an initial power offset to be used for a secondary reverse<br>
link carrier as a function of the reverse link loading information. In either case, the base station<br>
controller 18 may be configured to transmit the initialization power offset information by<br>
transmitting the power offset Information in a traffic channel assignment message. Generally, it<br>
should be understood that the power offset information can be sent in essentially any type of<br>
6<br><br>
broadcast and/or unicast message type, and that the particular type(s) of messages used to<br>
send such information may change according to network type, or for other reasons as needed<br>
or desired.<br>
in at least one embodiment, the base station controller 18 is configured to further<br>
determine the initialization power offset information as a function of differences in active set<br>
sizes associated with one or more secondary reverse link carriers and a primary reverse link<br>
carrier associated with the mobile station 12, Wore generally, the base station controller can be<br>
configured to determine the initialization power offset information by determining at least one of<br>
reverse link loading differences relating one or more secondary reverse link carriers to a primary<br>
reverse link carrier, determining active set differences relating one or more secondary reverse<br>
link carriers to a primary reverse link carrier, and sector switching activity involving the mobile<br>
station.<br>
For example, if the active set of radio base station sectors associated with the primary<br>
reverse link carrier is smaller than the active set associated with a given secondary reverse link<br>
carrier that is a candidate for use by the mobile station 12, the initial transmit power offset set by<br>
the mobile station 12 may be made smaller than it would be if active set size differences were<br>
not considered. The reduction corresponds to the presumed diversity gain advantages<br>
associated with the larger active set size of the secondary reverse link carrier.<br>
With the above possibilities for different information types that may be considered when<br>
setting the initial transmit power of a secondary reverse link carrier relative to a primary reverse<br>
link carrier, Fig. 4 illustrates one embodiment of mobile station processing logic that<br>
complements the transmission of the initialization power offset information. Processing "begins"<br>
with the mobile station 12 receiving the initialization offset power information (Step 104). As<br>
noted earlier, the received information may comprise computed offsets or the underlying<br>
information to be used by the mobile station 12 in computing the appropriate offsets. Mobile<br>
station processing continues with setting the initial transmit power of a secondary reverse link<br>
carrier based on the received information (Step 106).<br>
Notably, in the context of Fig. 4 and in other embodiments, the base stations 16 and/or<br>
the base station controllers 18 may be configured to send per-sector transmit power offset<br>
information for the secondary carriers, rather than per-mobiie offset information. Thus, the<br>
mobile station 12 may be configured such that it chooses the offset(s) defined for the sector<br>
which is the current serving sector. If the mobile station 12 performs a sector switch before the<br>
initial reverse link acquisition is complete on the secondary carrier—that is, inner loop power<br>
control by the network has not yet started—the processing circuits) in the mobile station 12<br>
update the initial offset to be used for secondary carrier transmit power based on the offset<br>
corresponding to the new serving sector.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates an embodiment of the mobile station 12 that is configured to carry out<br>
the processing logic of Fig. 4, or variations of that logic. The illustrated mobile station 12<br>
7<br><br>
comprises a transmit/receive antenna 40, a switch/dupfexer 42, a transceiver circuit 44, such as<br>
a CDMA-based radiofrequency transceiver circuit, a baseband processor circuit 46, a system<br>
controller 48, input/output (I/O) circuits 50, and a user interface 52. it will be understood that<br>
some elements may be added, deleted, or altered with respect to the diagram, depending upon<br>
the intended use of the mobile station 12. On that point, the term "mobile station" as used herein<br>
should be given broad construction. Non-limiting examples of mobile stations include cellular<br>
handsets or other types of access terminal, pagers, Portable Digital Assistants (PDAs), palmtop<br>
or laptop computers, or communication modules therein.<br>
Of particular interest regarding the mobile station's functional illustration, one sees that<br>
the baseband processor circuit 46, which actually may comprise multiple microprocessor and/or<br>
other digital logic circuits, includes a power control circuit 60. The power control circuit 60 can<br>
be configured to set the initial transmit power offset used for transmitting on a secondary<br>
reverse Jink carrier from the mobile station 12 as a function of initialization power offset<br>
information received by the mobile station 12. As noted, the information may comprise one or<br>
more pre-computed offset values that relate one or more candidate secondary reverse link<br>
carriers to a primary reverse link carrier currently in use at the mobile station 12. Alternatively,<br>
the information may comprise reverse link loading information and/or active set size and sector<br>
switching information that can be used by the power control circuit 60 to compute the<br>
appropriate offsets.<br>
fn either case, the mobile station 12 broadly comprises the transceiver circuit 44, which<br>
is configured to receive initialization power offset information from a supporting wireless<br>
communication network, and one or more processing circuits—e.g., the power control circuit<br>
60—configured to set an initial transmit power of a secondary reverse link carrier relative to a<br>
primary reverse link carrier as a function of the initialization power offset information. As noted,<br>
the initialization power offset information may comprise reverse Sink loading information<br>
associated with the primary and secondary reverse link carriers, such that the mobile station 12<br>
considers reverse link loading differences relating a secondary reverse link carrier to a primary<br>
reverse link carrier, when determining the Initial transmit power offset to be used for the<br>
secondary reverse link carrier relative to a current transmit power of the primary reverse link<br>
carrier. That is, the mobile station 12 can be broadly configured to compute an initial power<br>
offset for a secondary reverse link carrier relative to a current transmit power of the primary<br>
reverse link carrier as a function of the reverse link loading information.<br>
Fig, 6 illustrates one embodiment of processing logic for Initializing the transmit power of<br>
a secondary reverse link carrier as a function of reverse link loading. More particularly, the<br>
illustrated processing logic determines the power offset to be used for initializing the secondary<br>
reverse link carrier transmit power relative to the transmit power of a primary reverse link carrier.<br>
Such processing can be performed in the base station controller 18 and/or in the mobile<br>
station 12.<br>
8<br><br>
Processing begins with determining whether reverse link (RL) loading is higher for a<br>
candidate secondary reverse link Garner than for the mobile station's primary reverse link carrier<br>
(Step 100). If so, the transmit power offset is set, directly or indirectly, such that the initial<br>
transmit power used for transmissions on the secondary reverse link carrier will be higher than<br>
the primary reverse link carrier (Step 112).<br>
Conversely, if the relative reverse link loading is lower {Step 114), processing continues<br>
with setting the transmit power offset, directly or indirectly, such that the initial transmit power<br>
used for transmissions on the secondary reverse link carrier wiif be lower than the primary<br>
reverse link carrier (Step 116). If the relative reverse link loading is the same, or approximately<br>
the same, processing continues with setting the transmit power offset, directly or indirectly, such<br>
that the initial transmit power used for transmissions on the secondary reverse link carrier will be<br>
the same, or approximately the same, as that used for the primary reverse link carrier.<br>
In the above processing context, it will be understood that "higher" and "lower"<br>
comparisons may be based on comparing specific values, or may be based on range or<br>
threshold comparisons. For example, if the reverse link loading estimates associated with a<br>
secondary reverse link carrier of interest and a primary reverse link carrier are within 5% of each<br>
other, for example, they may be considered the same and the initial power offset can be set<br>
accordingly, e.g., to a zero offset. If the reverse link loading is higher for the secondary reverse<br>
link carrier by more than 5%, the initial power offset can be set to a positive non-zero offset<br>
relative to the primary reverse link carrier transmit power. Conversely, if the reverse link loading<br>
is lower for the secondary reverse link carrier by more than 5%, the initial power offset can be<br>
set to a negative non-zero offset relative to the primary reverse link carrier transmit power.<br>
Further, in the above context, directly setting the initial power offset may comprise<br>
performing the reverse link loading and/or other comparisons relating the primary and<br>
secondary reverse link carriers within the base station controller 18, and transmitting explicit<br>
power offset information to the mobile station 12. Conversely, indirectly setting the initial power<br>
offset may comprise sending comparison results, or the underlying values for comparison, to the<br>
mobile station 12, such that the mobile station 12 computes the initial power offset. In either<br>
case, the information may be transmitted to the mobile station 12 via traffic channel assignment<br>
messaging.<br>
In another embodiment of implicitly providing initial power offset information to the<br>
mobile station 12, RABs or other reverse link load indicators are transmitted by the network 10<br>
in one or more radio sectors. The toad indicators may be configured to indicate sector loading<br>
without regard to a particular carrier, or may be configured to indicate loading for the available<br>
carriers In each sector.<br>
In any case, the mobile station 12 can be configured to use the transmitted load<br>
indicators according to, for example, the processing logic of Fig. 7. The illustrated processing<br>
includes the mobile station 12 receiving RABs or other reverse link load indicators from the<br>
9<br><br>
network 10 (Step 120). Processing continues with the mobile station 12 using the received<br>
indicators, which may be periodically or continually updated by the network 10 to reflect<br>
changing conditions, to determine relative reverse link loading for a primary reverse Hnk carrier<br>
and one or more secondary reverse link carriers of interest (Step 122). Processing continues<br>
with the mobile station 12 setting the initial transmit power tor a selected secondary reverse link<br>
carrier based on the reverse link loading information (Step 124). For example, the mobile<br>
