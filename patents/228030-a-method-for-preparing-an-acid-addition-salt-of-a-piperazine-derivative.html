				<td>The present invention relates to a method for preparing an acid addition salt of a piperazine derivative.<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a method for preparing an acid addition salt of a polyacidic basic compound or a water adduct of the acid addition salt, which makes it possible to readily add a desired number of moles of an acid to the polyacidic basic compound.<br>
Background Art<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions are well known to have significant differences in solubility, oral absorption, drug activity, stability and the like depending on the<br>
kind and crystallized type of their salts, even when they are made of the same ingredient in free form. For the development of a pharmaceutical composition, it is therefore extremely important to select an ingredient enabling itself to fulfill the most preferred conditions, based on the results obtained by making comprehensive analysis on the material's characteristics, such as chemical stability, bioavailabilty and physical stability (the degree of crystallinity and the degree of hydration),<br><br>
effects on pharmaceutical properties (hardness,<br>
disintegration property and elution property) and effects<br>
on pharmaceutical capabilities (formability, anticaking<br>
property and capacity).<br>
Piperazine derivatives, which are categorized into<br>
polyacidic basic compounds and represented typically by<br>
2-[4-[2-(benzimidazol-2-ylthio)ethyl]piperazin-l-yl]-N-<br>
[2,4-bis(methylthio)-6-methyl-3-pyridyl]acetamide, are<br>
useful as inhibitors against the enzyme (acyl coenzyme A<br>
cholesterol acyltransferase, ACAT) that catalyzes the<br>
synthesis of cholesterol into a cholesterol ester (WO<br>
98/54153 Pamphlet).<br>
Inhibition of ACAT is thought to prevent<br>
cholesterol absorption through the intestinal tract, and<br>
also to suppress the secretion of very-low-density<br>
lipoprotein into blood at the liver, leading to a<br>
reduction in blood cholesterol. Further, inhibition of<br>
ACAT suppresses the foaming of macrophages in artery<br>
walls, so atherosclerosis lesions are expected to shrink<br>
per se. ACAT inhibitors are, therefore, expected to be<br>
applicable for the treatment and prevention of various<br>
diseases such as hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis,<br>
cervical and cerebral arteriosclerosis, cerebrovascular<br>
accidents, ischemic heart diseases, coronary sclerosis,<br>
nephrosclerosis, arteriosclerotic nephrosclerosis,<br>
arteriolosclerotic nephrosclerosis, malignant<br>
nephrosclerosis, ischemic bowel diseases, acute<br>
mesenteric vaso-occlusion, chronic intestinal angina,<br>
ischemic colitis, aortic cancer, and arteriosclerosis<br>
obliterans (ASO) , and numerous researches and<br>
developments are now under way.<br>
Among the above-described piperazine derivatives<br>
useful as ACAT inhibitors, 2-[4-[2-(benzimidazol-2-<br>
ylthio)ethyl]piperazin-l-yl]-N-[2,4-bis(methylthio)-6-<br>
methyl-3-pyridyl]acetamide, for example, has a problem<br>
such that it crystallizes in the form of the free base,<br>
but its oral absorption is little well because its<br>
crystals are not uniform and its physical stability and<br>
water solubility are too low.<br>
Solutions to the aforementioned problems have been<br>
attempted mainly by adding an acid to such polyacidic<br>
basic compounds to improve their oral absorption or the<br>
like and using them as acid addition salts. For example,<br>
2-[4-[2-(benzimidazol-2-ylthio)ethyl]piperazin-l-yl]-N-<br>
[2,4-bis(methylthio)-6-methyl-3-pyridyl]acetamide can be<br>
substantially improved in water solubility and oral<br>
absorption by converting it into the tetrahydrochloride<br>
2-water adduct with an excess amount of hydrochloric acid,<br>
Nonetheless, it has been pointed out that the<br>
number of moles of the added acid affects the physical<br>
properties of the resulting acid addition salt of the<br>
polyacidic basic compound, and that the<br>
tetrahydrochloride 2-water adduct cannot avoid a low<br>
degree of crystallinity in its powder X-ray diffraction<br>
analysis; it is susceptible to dehydration and<br>
dehydrochlorination in a differential scanning thermal<br>
analysis; and it is also recognized as having high<br>
hygroscopicity in a hygroscopicity test. A further<br>
problem is also presumed in that tableting machines and<br>
aluminum sheets may undergo metal corrosion due to the<br>
residual of the acid used in excess and the strong<br>
acidity of the tetrahydrochloride. This raises concern<br>
about effects of the metal corrosion on the formulation<br>
of a pharmaceutical preparation and also on the stability<br>
of the pharmaceutical preparation. It is necessary to<br>
fully control factors such as drying temperature, vacuum<br>
(reduced pressured) level and drying degree upon<br>
preparation. Yet it is difficult to efficiently and<br>
stably supply such acid addition salts as active<br>
ingredients for pharmaceutical compositions while always<br>
providing them with uniform physical properties.<br>
For the resolution of the above-described problems,<br>
it may be contemplated to prepare an acid addition salt<br>
with the number of moles of the acid to be added being<br>
controlled. However, there is still a problem in that<br>
when hydrochloric acid or the like is used as an acid, it<br>
is difficult to accurately measure the amount of the acid<br>
in a mole number desired to be added to 1 mole of a<br>
polyacidic basic compound, thereby becoming too hard to<br>
easily prepare the acid addition salt of the polyacidic<br>
basic compound, said salt containing the added acid in a<br>
desired number of moles, or a water adduct of the acid<br>
addition salt.<br>
Accordingly, there has since been strong demand for<br>
a preparation method making it possible to easily adjust<br>
the number of moles of an acid in an acid addition salt<br>
of a polyacidic basic compound to a number suited for the<br>
polyacidic basic compound as needed.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
preparation method which makes it possible to easily<br>
adjust the number of moles of an acid in an acid addition<br>
salt of a polyacidic basic compound, to a desired number.<br>
With the foregoing circumstances in mind, the<br>
present inventors conducted an extensive investigation.<br>
As a result, it has been found that by reaction of a<br>
polyacidic basic compound with an acid salt of pyridine,<br>
said acid salt being formed from pyridine and an acid, it<br>
is readily possible to prepare an acid addition salt of<br>
the polyacidic basic compound with a desired number of<br>
moles of the acid being added to basic site(s) stronger<br>
than pyridine. It has also been found that acid addition<br>
salts of various piperazine derivatives, said acid<br>
addition salts being available from the practice of the<br>
above method, for example, 2-[4-[2-(benzimidazol-2-<br>
ylthio)ethyl]piperazin-l-yl]-N-[2,4-bis(methylthio)-6-<br>
methyl-3-pyridyl]acetamide monohydrochloride 0.9-water<br>
adduct has a high degree of crystallinity, has no<br>
hygroscopicity, is excellent in thermal stability without<br>
being accompanied with any substantial weight change by<br>
dehydration, dehydrochlorination and/or the like, does<br>
not develop the problem of polymorphism, and is free from<br>
the influence of any residual of hydrochloric acid, so<br>
that said compound is a preferred acid addition salt and<br>
is useful as a pharmaceutical ingredient. Based on these<br>
findings, the present invention has been completed.<br>
Thus the present invention provides a method for<br>
the preparation of an acid addition salt of a polyacidic<br>
basic compound having basic site(s) stronger than<br>
pyridine or a water adduct of the acid addition salt,<br>
which comprises reacting the polyacidic basic compound<br>
with an acid salt of pyridine.<br>
The present invention also provides 2-[4-[2-<br>
(benzimidazol-2-ylthio)ethyl]piperazin-l-yl]-N-[2, 4-<br>
bis(methylthio)-6-methyl-3-pyridyl]acetamide<br>
monohydrochloride or a water adduct thereof, 2-[4-[2-<br>
(5,6-difluorobenzimidazol-2-ylthio)ethyl]piperazin-l-yl] -<br>

pyridyl]acetamide monohydrochloride or a water adduct<br>
thereof, 2-[4-[2-(benzimidazol-2-ylthio)ethyl]piperazin-<br>
1-yl]-N-[2,4-bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-6-methyl-3-<br>
pyridyl]acetamide<br>
dihydrochloride or a water adduct thereof, 2-[4-[2-<br>
(benzoxazol-2-ylthio)ethyl]piperazin-l-yl]-N-[2,4-<br>
bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-6-methyl-3-pyridyl]acetamide<br>
monohydrochloride or a water adduct thereof, 2-[4-[2-<br>
(benzothiazol-2-ylthio)ethyl]piperazin-l-yl]-N-[2,6-<br>
dimethyl-4-trifluoromethyl-3-pyridyl]acetamide<br>
dihydrochloride or a water adduct thereof, 2-[4-[2-(5-<br>
trifluoromethylbenzoxazol-2-ylthio)ethyl]piperazin-l-yl] -<br>
N-[2,4-bis(methylthio)-6-methyl-3-pyridyl]acetamide<br>
monohydrochloride or a water adduct thereof, or 2-[4-[2-<br>
(benzoxazol-2-ylthio)ethyl]piperazin-1-yl]-N-[2-(2-<br>
methoxyethoxy)-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-6-methyl-3-<br>
pyridyl]acetamide monohydrochloride or a water adduct<br>
thereof.<br>
The method of the present invention can easily<br>
prepare a salt of a polyacidic basic compound with a<br>
desired number of moles of an acid added thereto.<br>
8<br>
According to this preparation method, it is possible not<br>
only to control the number of moles of an added acid, but<br>
also to firmly prepare an acid addition salt of a<br>
polyacidic basic compound which is unstable to the acid.<br>
The use of the acid salt of pyridine relatively<br>
weakens the acidity of the acid, and substantially<br>
lessens the problems of the conventional method such as<br>
the decomposition, the formation of impurities and the<br>
like by a localized pH reduction in a system due to the<br>
addition or the like of a strong acid.<br>

WO 98/54153.<br>
The acid salt of pyridine, which is for use in the<br>
present invention, is the salt of pyridine with an<br>
inorganic acid or organic acid, and no particular<br>
limitation is imposed on the acid which forms a salt with<br>
pyridine. Examples thereof include inorganic acids such<br>
as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, sulfurous acid, nitrous acid,<br>
hydrobromic acid and hydroiodic acid; fatty acids such as<br>
acetic acid, butyric acid and stearic acid; polybasic<br>
acids such as oxalic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid and<br>
fumaric acid; hydroxycarboxylic acids such as citric acid,<br>
lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid,<br>
salicylic acid, pamoic acid, pantothenic acid and<br>
gluconic acid; sulfonic acids such as ethanedisulfonic<br>
acid, benzenesulfonic acid, paratoluenesulfonic acid and<br>
methanesulfonic acid; acidic amino acids such as glutamic<br>
acid and aspartic acid; and trifluoroacetic acid, and<br>
tannic acid.<br>
Preferred examples of the acid include hydrochloric<br>
acid, sulfuric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric<br>
acid, malic acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid and<br>
the like, with hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and<br>
maleic acid being more preferred, with hydrochloric acid<br>
being particularly preferred.<br>
The acid salt of pyridine may be used no matter<br>
whether its form is in crystalline or non-crystalline.<br>
In the preparation of said crystalline acid salt of<br>
pyridine, it is theoretically possible to obtain an acid<br>
salt of pyridine by reacting pyridine and an acid in<br>
equal equivalent amounts. Even so it is preferred that<br>
the reaction be performed by using pyridine in an excess<br>
amount relative to the acid in an anhydrous or watercontaining<br>
organic solvent, for example, by using<br>
pyridine 1.0 to 1.5 times, more preferably 1.0 to 1.2<br>
times as much as the acid in terms of equivalents. The<br>
acid salt of pyridine so formed can be purified by a<br>
conventional crystallization method making use of a<br>
solvent or the like.<br>
When a crystalline acid salt of pyridine is reacted<br>
with the polyacidic basic compound in the present<br>
invention, the acid salt of pyridine is used generally in<br>
an amount sufficient to supply the acid in the same<br>
number of moles as the acid to be added to 1 mole of the<br>
polyacidic basic compound. Specifically, the amount of<br>
the acid salt of pyridine is subject to the kind and<br>
amount of a solvent to be used, and it is preferred that<br>
the acid salt of pyridine be used in an enough amount<br>
able to supply the acid 1.0 to 3.0 times, preferably 1.0<br>
to 2.5 times as much as the number of moles of the acid<br>
to be added.<br>
When the acid addition salt of the polyacidic basic<br>
compound is prepared by using a non-crystalline acid salt<br>
of pyridine, it is preferred that the reaction be<br>
performed in an anhydrous or water-containing organic<br>
solvent by adding to the polyacidic basic compound the<br>
acid 1.0 to 2.5 times, preferably 1.0 to 1.2 times as<br>
much as the amount corresponding to the number of moles<br>
of the acid to be added to 1 mole of the polyacidic basic<br>
compound and also pyridine 1.0 to 1.5 times in<br>
equivalents, preferably 1.0 to 1.2 times in equivalents<br>
as much as the amount of the acid to be used.<br>
In a process for the preparation of the acid<br>
addition salt of the polyacidic basic compound, a salt<br>
interchange is observed to occur between the polyacidic<br>
basic compound and the acid salt of pyridine to form the<br>
acid addition salt of the polyacidic basic compound, when<br>
the polyacidic basic compound and the acid salt of<br>
pyridine in an amount necessary for the acid to be added<br>
are heated and dissolved in an organic solvent at 0 to<br>
120°C, more preferably at room temperature to 100°C,<br>
especially preferably at the reflux temperature of the<br>
organic solvent used.<br>
Examples of the organic solvent used in the above<br>
process include lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol<br>
tetrahydrofuran; and acetone and acetonitrile. Mixed<br>
solvents obtained by adding water to organic solvents are<br>
also usable.<br>
No particular limitations are imposed on the kind<br>
and amount of the solvent to be used in the above process<br>
It is nevertheless desirable to suitably choose the kind<br>
and amount of the solvent so that the yield of the acid<br>
addition salt of the polyacidic basic compound can be<br>
maximized.<br>
The resulting acid addition salt of the polyacidic<br>
basic compound or the resulting water adduct of the acid<br>
addition salt can be obtained by collecting precipitated<br>
crystals optionally after allowing the reaction mixture<br>
to stand for 0.5 to 24 hours under stirring and the<br>
reaction product to crystallize out.<br>
The acid salt of pyridine of the present invention<br>
has an activity to weaken the acidity of the acid<br>
employed, so when the free form of the polyacidic basic<br>
compound becomes unstable to the acid, it can<br>
significantly alleviate problems such as the<br>
decomposition of the active ingredient and the formation<br>
of impurities due to a localized pH reduction in the<br>
system by the addition or the like of the strong acid in<br>
the conventional methods.<br>
The preparation method of the present invention is<br>
extremely advantageous for the preparation of acid<br>
addition salts of the above-described piperazine<br>
derivatives, especially 2-[4-[2-(benzimidazol-2-<br>
ylthio)ethyl]piperazin-l-yl]-N-[2,4-bis(methylthio)-6-<br>
methyl-3-pyridyl]acetamide monohydrochloride or a water<br>

[2,4-bis(methylthio)-6-methyl-3-pyridyl]acetamide<br>
tetrahydrochloride 2-water adduct, given the use of<br>
hydrochloric acid in an excess amount. However, even if<br>
there is a need that an amount of hydrochloric be<br>
precisely weighed as in the case of the preparation of a<br>
monohydrochloride or a water adduct thereof, it would be<br>
extremely difficult not only to conduct its operation,<br>
but also to obtain the desired uniform hydrochloride or<br>
its water adduct.<br>
When preparing 2-[4-[2-(benzimidazol-2-<br>

In particular, 2-[4-[2-(benzimidazol-2-<br>

methyl-3-pyridyl]acetamide monohydrochloride 0.9-water<br>

crystallinity, does not have hygroscopicity, is excellent<br>
in thermal stability without any a weight change due to<br>
dehydration, dehydrochlorination or the like, has no<br>
problem of polymorphism, and is free from influence by a<br>
residual of hydrochloric acid, so this is a preferred<br>
acid addition salt.<br>
