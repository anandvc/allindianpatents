THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
Section 10<br>
"TAMPER PROOF CLOSURE FOR BOTTLES"<br>
Nishikant Shirodkar, Indian, residing at 5th floor, Cliff Tower, Mount Mary Road, Bandra (W), Mumbai - 400 050<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is performed.<br><br>
1251/MUM/2005<br><br>
27 JAN 2005<br><br>
Tamper Proof Closure for Bottles<br>
This invention relates to an improved Tamper Proof closure for bottles and the like. More particularly this invention relates to an improved Tamper Proof closure for bottles and the like container used for liquid packing and fitted with a liquid pouring out body at the neck or opening which is simple in construction and provides a hydro lock chamber for preventing refilling of bottles/containers.<br>
The tamper proof closure for the bottles and the like, being of the type which comprises a pouring body for pouring out liquid, having a free edge, an outside threadway and an angular outer flange, a tubular body having an annular ledge on its interior. Elevations and depressions defining a grooved counter and an annular folding tab and a screw cap having an inside threadway matting with the said outside threadway on the pouring body, said screw cap being attached to the tubular body through a line of weakness, are well known and existing in the market for packing liquid in the bottles.<br>
Closures of the above type while performing satisfactorily from several aspects, are associated with certain problems which develop on first unsealing as well as on the occasion of subsequent open/close cycles when the various parts associated together along the axial direction to make up the closure happen to have axial dimensions which lie close to extreme values of their respective tolerance ranges, in particular the screw cap may not screw off the pouring body in a proper fashion because the latter fails to be held to the bottle with adequate firmness.<br>
In order to overcome the above problem Indian Patent No. 184359 proves a tamper proof closure for bottles and the like which comprises a pouring body having a free edge, an outside threadway and an annular ledge on its interior, elevations and depressions defining a grooved contour and an annular folding tab, a screw cap having an inside threadway mating with the outside threadway on the pouring body, the said screw cap being attached to the tubular body through a line of weakness and a coupling means between the tubular body and the pouring body wherein the coupling means comprises teeth projecting from the ledge and the teeth projecting from the flange. The pouring body is provided with a washer and encloses a one way shutter known as valve which is used to prevent unauthorized topping of the bottle that is refilling the liquid inside the bottle.<br>
In these closures it has been noticed that the one way shutter/valve provided in the pouring body being movable, it is possible that it may not perform its function properly due to skewing and tilting. Besides the use of the valve also makes the closure cumbersome.<br>
The main object of this invention is to obviate the above mentioned drawbacks and to provide an improved tamper proof closure for bottles and the like in which one way shutter/valve is not required and a hydrolock chamber formed in the closure prevent<br>
2<br><br>
refilling of liquid inside the bottle thereby increasing the reliability of the improved closure of this invention.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an improved tamper proof closure for bottles and the like which is simple in construction and easy in use.<br>
Accordingly, this invention provides an improved tamper proof closure for bottles and the like comprising of a tubular body with means for fitting the said body on a bottle neck or the like container mouth having free edge and grooved contour on its exterior, the said body being provided with grooved contour on its lower end, interior matching with the grooved contour of the bottle, the upper end of the said body being provided with easily breakable connector and tubular inner ledge, a cap resting over the said ledge and provided with easily breakable connector such as threads, a pouring body provided inside the tubular body at its upper end, the said pouring body consisting of an inner cartridge, an outer cartridge and a flexible member connected by means of ribs, the said flexible member having a base with passages and upward projections over its outer and inner contours forming circular space/cavity open from top, the said inner cartridge provided with upper end cover and its lower end installed in the said cavity between said base and the said projections and located below the upper end of the said projections, covering the inner projection and dividing the said cavity into two parts namely an inner cavity and an outer cavity forming a hydro lock chamber, the said cap being provided with a cover and a safety ring/guarantee cap, a plurality of projections provided over the said flexible member for proper fixing into the bottle mouth opening.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows in part sectional elevation the improved tamper proof closure for bottles and the like, according to an embodiment of this invention.<br>
Fig. 2 shows in part sectional elevation the improved tamper proof closure of this invention fitted on a bottle/container.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, the improved tamper proof closure for bottles and the like containers comprises a tubular body (1) with means (2) for fitting the tubular body on the neck of a bottle (3) and the like containers. The bottle (3) includes a mouth opening having a free edge and being formed with a groove on its exterior which defines an axial shoulder with a plurality of elevations and depressions, jointly defining a growed contour. The upper end of the tubular body (1) is provided with easily breakable connector (4) and a tubular inner ledge for resting a cap (5) the tubular body interior is formed at its lower end with a plurality of elevations and depressions which jointly defines a grooved contour matching with the grooved contour of the bottle mouth. The cap (5) is provided with easily breakable connector for example threads (6) a pouring body (7) provided at upper end of the body (1). The pouring body (7) for pouring out liquid consists of an outer cartridge (8) and an inner cartridge (9) forming channels (1) for passing the liquid and an elastic flexible member (11) connected by means of ribs.<br>
3<br><br>
The flexible member (11) has base with passages (12) and projections (13 and 14) over outer and inner contour of the base forming circular space/cavity (15) open from top. Inner cartridge (9) is provided with upper end cover (16) the lower end of which is installed in the cavity (15) between base and projections of the flexible member (11). The lower end of the inner cartridge (9) is located below the upper end of the inner cartridge (9) is located below the upper end of the projection (13) and projection (14) it covers inner projection (13) and divides the cavity (15) into two parts in its lower portion, into an outer cavity and an inner cavity forming hydro-lock chamber. A cover (17) is press fitted over the cap (5), the lower end of which is provided with a guarantee cap or safety ring (18). A plurality of projections (19) are provided over the flexible member (11) for proper and hermatically fixing it, to the bottle mouth opening.<br>
While using cap (5) is unscrewed and closure breaks out from cap (5) along the weak breakable connector (4) which its cover (17) and simultaneously breaking of the guarantee cap or safety ring (18) then on tilting the bottle a desired volume of liquid passes into the cavity (15) through the passage (12) of the base of flexible member (11) which is poured out through the channel (1) in between the inner and outer cartridges (8 &amp; 9). When bottle is brought back to vertical position liquid located in the channel (10) goes into the cavity (15) of the flexible member (11) initially in the outer part and then in the inner part forming surplus pressure in the cavity and acting as hydraulic lock. If any attempt is made to add liquid into the bottle, liquid will fill open space of the cavity of flexible member and due to the fact that the cavity is partitioned by lower end face of inner cartridge (9) with stopped end face, liquid in outer part of cavity will press on the liquid in inner part of cavity and space of bottle being closed by cartridge with stopped end face, pressure is built in the bottle preventing passage of liquid into bottle. Therefore, the closure of this invention without having any valve form hydraulic lock and is simple and more reliable.<br>
The side surface of the tubular body of the closure is smooth and is provided with logo or any other print The closure is made from ecologically clean materials such as polyethylene and polystirol. Preferably the pouring body is made from polymethyl metacrylate, flexible member is made from synthetic material such as caprolone.<br>
The above description with reference to drawings is given to understand the invention rather than to limit its scope.<br>
