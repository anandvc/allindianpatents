Method for operating an industrial scale installation and<br>
guidance system for an industrial scale installation<br>
The invention relates to a method for operating an industrial<br>
scale installation, in particular a power plant installation,<br>
in which a number of installation operating parameters<br>
characterizing the respective operating state of the technical<br>
installation and for a number of selected components of the<br>
technical installation respectively a number of component<br>
operating parameters of relevance for the respective component<br>
are monitored and stored in a storage facility, with a<br>
characteristic fatigue value characterizing the current<br>
fatigue state of the respective component being determined for<br>
the or each selected component as required on the basis of the<br>
stored installation operating parameters and/or the stored<br>
assigned component operating parameters. It also relates to a<br>
guidance system for an industrial scale installation, in<br>
particular a power plant installation, which is designed in an<br>
appropriate manner in respect of its components, for example<br>
storage facilities, evaluation units and the like, for the<br>
determination of fatigue values for the installation<br>
components and is thus suitable for implementing the cited<br>
method.<br>
Technical or industrial scale installations are found in the<br>
most diverse areas of industry, being used for example to<br>
manufacture a specific product, to further process or refine;<br>
raw materials, to carry out previously manual activities in an<br>
automated manner or to produce in particular electrical<br>
energy. Finished industrial scale installations, such as power<br>
plant installations in particular, generally consist of a<br><br>
plurality of installation components, which realize the<br>
individual functions of the respective industrial scale<br>
installation. Many such installation components are subject to<br>
mechanical or operationally induced wear during their<br>
operating life. During the service life of the technical<br>
installation wear of the installation components represents an<br>
important aspect even as early as the design stage of the<br>
installation, as if a wear limit is exceeded, the function of<br>
the technical installation or at least of the affected<br>
components can no longer be insured.<br>
In power plant installations in particular parts or<br>
installation components such as boilers, steam generators,<br>
collectors, conduits and the like are subjected to changing<br>
mechanical stresses due to changes in the parameters of their<br>
environments such as pressure and temperature for example.<br>
These different loadings, or load changes of the power plant<br>
installation, which are generally associated with a change of<br>
state of the power plant installation, for example an increase<br>
in or reduction of output, normally result in possibly<br>
considerable material strain in the affected component and to<br>
so-called part fatigue, which above a certain limit can also<br>
result in part failure. In particular such fatigue Limits the<br>
operational life or maximum permissible operating life of the<br>
respective power plant component or installation component.<br>
For these reasons part fatigue of selected installation<br>
components is taken into account during the planning of an<br>
industrial scale installation and also during the planning of<br>
repair and maintenance cycles, in order to be able to insure<br>
replacement of the respective components as required in good<br>
time before part failure.<br><br>
To take appropriate account of such fatigue phenomena durinq<br>
installation planning, during the construction or design of<br>
power plant parts, to insure a minimum service life, the<br>
respective components or parts are generally subjected to a<br>
predefined load spectrum consisting of a limited number of<br>
types of load change, for example comprising a predetermined<br>
number of hot starts, warm starts and cold starts each with<br>
predefined modes of operation of the power plant installation.<br>
For these standardized types of load change the respective<br>
fatigue contributions in the affected components are then<br>
determined for each type of load change, with relatively<br>
complex computation methods, such as finite element<br>
calculations, generally being deployed. The respective<br>
installation components are then generally designed taking<br>
into account the results thus obtained such that the overall<br>
fatigue of the respective part or component determined for<br>
each type from the individual fatigue contributions and the<br>
number of load changes applied does not exceed a predetermined<br>
limit value for fatigue deemed still to be permissible.<br>
However taking the material fatigue in the individual parts or<br>
components into account in this manner does not allow the<br>
actual component response to be predicted adequately. In<br>
particular the actual mode of operation of an industrial scale<br>
installation or in particular of a power plant installation is<br>
generally more flexible and variable than is assumed at the<br>
design stage, as the mode of operation of the power plant<br>
installation has to be adapted for example to current load<br>
requirements or the like. In order therefore to be able to<br>
take account of the fatigue actually occurring during<br>
maintenance and audit planning for power plant installations<br>
in an appropriate manner, the respective part fatigue of<br><br>
selected installation components is generally monitored in<br>
power plant installations or other industrial scale<br>
installations. Since the part fatigue cannot generally be<br>
measured directly in this process, corresponding<br>
characteristic pressure and temperature values for<br>
characterizing the respective ambient conditions of the<br>
respective component are generally measured and monitored,<br>
from which the changing stresses caused by pressure and<br>
temperature changes in the respective component are then<br>
calculated. The resulting actual values for the stresses in<br>
the components are then combined in load change cycles, with<br>
the level and number of the respective load changes being<br>
compared with known limit values. A characteristic value<br>
characterizing the fatigue of the respective part or<br>
component, a so-called characteristic fatigue value, is then<br>
determined as a result, which is able for example to specify a<br>
percentage of the service life of the part. It is possible<br>
with such concepts to determine the fatigue occurring hitherto<br>
for the selected power plant or installation components over<br>
their entire operational deployment and to take it into<br>
account during maintenance and audit planning. Corresponding<br>
concepts are noted for example in DIN EN 12952-4: 2001-10<br>
"Water-tube boilers and auxiliary installations, Part 4: In-<br>
service boiler life expectancy calculations, German version EN<br>
12952-4:2000".<br>
However during the operation of such industrial scale<br>
installations, such as power plant installations, it must on<br>
the one hand be ensured mandatorily for safety reasons that<br>
maintenance and optionally replacement of wearing components<br>
or parts or those affected by fatigue is/are in any case<br>
undertaken in good time before the breakdown or failure of the<br>
respective component. On the other hand however there is a<br><br>
need to undertake such maintenance or repair interventions in<br>
the industrial scale installation in particular in a demand<br>
actuated manner, to avoid unnecessary installation stoppage<br>
times and to insure a particularly economical mode of<br>
operation, so that parts are only actually replaced, when they<br>
only have a relatively short remaining service life. Also for<br>
particularly efficient and economical operation of the<br>
installation the mode of operation of the respective<br>
installation should be selected to protect resources so that<br>
wear and fatigue in components and parts is kept as low as<br>
possible.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to develop a method<br>
for operating an industrial scale installation of the above-<br>
mentioned type, in which characteristic fatigue values<br>
characterizing selected installation components are<br>
determined, in such a manner that a particularly long<br>
operational service life of individual parts or components is<br>
particularly favored whilst still complying with predetermined<br>
safety standards and a particularly demand-actuated audit and<br>
maintenance plan is enabled. A guidance system for an<br>
industrial scale installation that is particularly suitable<br>
for implementing the method is also to be specified.<br>
According to the invention this object is achieved in respect<br>
of the method in that based on the characteristic fatigue<br>
value characterizing the current fatigue state an assigned<br>
predicted fatigue value is determined respectively for the or<br>
each selected component on the basis of guidance parameters<br>
characterizing a planned change of state.<br>
The invention is based on the consideration that for a mode of<br>
operation of the industrial scale installation or power plant<br><br>
installation that in particular protects resources and<br>
therefore favors the service life of the components or parts<br>
used, the determined characteristic fatigue values should be<br>
extended actively beyond a simple part diagnosis to the mode<br>
of operation of the installation. To this end based on the<br>
determined actual value for the current fatigue of the<br>
respective component or part a predicted value for part<br>
fatigue should be produced in the manner of an extrapolation<br>
taking into account the planned mode of operation of the<br>
installation, this predicted value being able to be used for<br>
example as an auxiliary variable for determining the need for<br>
repair or maintenance interventions. Such state change here is<br>
in particular a load change of a power plant and can in<br>
particular be a shutdown or startup procedure for the power<br>
plant installation.<br>
The operating parameters to be taken into account for<br>
determining the respective characteristic fatigue values that<br>
are provided here are preferably on the one hand component-<br>
specific operating parameters or component operating<br>
parameters, which advantageously comprise characteristic<br>
values for ambient pressure, ambient temperature and/or<br>
ambient humidity of the respective component or part.<br>
Alternatively or additionally relevant or characteristic<br>
operating parameters or installation parameters are<br>
advantageously captured and evaluated for the state of the<br>
industrial scale installation or power plant installation as a<br>
whole, these advantageously comprising characteristic values<br>
for an installation switching state and/or a target output. It<br>
is then possible from all these parameters to determine the<br>
pressure and temperature values acting locally on the<br>
respective component or part, which ultimately induce the<br><br>
mechanical stresses and therefore the resulting fatigue in the<br>
part.<br>
In order in this process to be able to determine particularly<br>
reliable characteristic values for part fatigue, in a further-<br>
advantageous embodiment component parameters characterizing<br>
the respective component are taken into account when<br>
determining the respective characteristic fatigue value and/or<br>
the respective predicted fatigue value. The component<br>
parameters provided for here are particularly advantageously<br>
material data, geometric dimensions and/or pressure and<br>
temperature measuring points of significance for fatigue<br>
calculation in the respective component.<br>
The complexity of the underlying processes resulting in<br>
fatigue means that a closed calculation of precise<br>
characteristic values or parameters using available resources<br>
is generally not possible or not practical. In order however<br>
to be able to provide particularly reliable characteristic<br>
values or parameters using only limited computer capacities,<br>
trend curves for temperature and/or pressure values within the<br>
respective component are advantageously taken into account to<br>
determine the respective predicted fatigue value. The trend<br>
curves here are advantageously determined from a thermodynamic<br>
simulation of the installation, with stored empirical<br>
knowledge or retained empirical values possibly being used if<br>
required.<br>
To keep determination and processing outlay particularly low<br>
and therefore to facilitate installation diagnosis and<br>
guidance in a particularly efficient manner, in an additional<br>
or alternative advantageous embodiment specific account is<br>
taken of the knowledge that the breakdown of components or<br><br>
parts due to wear or fatigue will generally occur primarily<br>
and exclusively in the component most affected by wear or<br>
fatigue. Taking into account the wear or fatigue state of the<br>
respective component in maintenance and repair planning can<br>
thus be particularly effective in that the corresponding<br>
evaluations can be concentrated on the component expected to<br>
be most affected by fatigue and wear. To enable this, this<br>
component or part having the highest determined predicted<br>
fatigue value of all the evaluated components is<br>
advantageously identified as the so-called "guide component"<br>
for primary consideration during the installation prediction.<br>
This predicted fatigue value of the guide component is<br>
advantageously used as a criterion for initiating repair or<br>
maintenance measures.<br>
In one particularly advantageous embodiment the specific<br>
evaluation of the fatigue states of the parts or components is-<br>
not used just for demand-actuated repair or maintenance<br>
planning but also for optimizing the mode of operation of the<br>
industrial scale installation to achieve an operating mode<br>
that in particular protects resources and extends service<br>
life. To this end various state or load change scenarios, with<br>
which it would be possible to continue to operate the<br>
installation in the near future, are advantageously analyzed<br>
in the manner of scenario planning based on the current<br>
installation state. For example based on the current actual<br>
state of a power plant installation it is possible to compare<br>
a relatively fast, short-term increase in output with a<br>
relatively slowly applied, continuous increase in output.<br>
Predicted fatigue values are then advantageously determined<br>
for such alternative state change proposals and compared with<br>
one another, this comparison being used to select the one of<br>
the possible state change or load change processes resulting<br><br>
in the smallest installation loading characterized by the<br>
lowest predicted fatigue value. The comparison of different<br>
possible state or load changes can take place here based on<br>
the predicted fatigue value of the respective guide component<br>
or even based on a set of predicted fatigue values for a<br>
number of affected components.<br>
With regard to the guidance system for an industrial scale<br>
installation, in particular a power plant installation, with a<br>
storage facility in which a number of installation operating<br>
parameters characterizing the respective operating state of<br>
the technical installation and a number of component operating<br>
parameters of relevance for a number of selected components in<br>
the technical installation are stored, and which is connected<br>
on the data side to an evaluation unit, which is designed for<br>
the respective determination as required of a characteristic<br>
fatigue value characterizing the current fatigue state of the<br>
or each selected component based on the stored installation<br>
operating parameters and/or the stored assigned component<br>
operating parameters, the cited object is achieved in that the<br>
evaluation unit is designed to determine an assigned predicted<br>
fatigue value for the or each selected component based on the<br>
characteristic fatigue value characterizing the current<br>
fatigue state on the basis of guidance parameters<br>
characterizing a planned change of state.<br>
For a particularly reliable and precise evaluation a<br>
thermodynamic model of the industrial scale installation or<br>
power plant installation is stored here in a storage unit and<br>
can be used to estimate temperature and pressure loadings in<br>
individual components or parts in a particularly reliable<br>
manner.<br><br>
The advantages achieved with the invention consist in<br>
particular in that using the fatigue analysis to provide<br>
corresponding predicted values enables or particularly favors<br>
particularly demand-actuated maintenance and audit planning<br>
for the industrial scale installation. Also by specifically<br>
evaluating fatigue contributions or expected fatigue<br>
contributions in individual components or parts of the<br>
industrial scale installation it is possible to select the<br>
load changes or state changes, which allow a generally<br>
speaking particularly resource-protecting mode of operation of<br>
the installation in respect of externally predetermined basic<br>
conditions.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is described in more<br>
detail with reference to a drawing, in which the figure shows<br>
a schematic diagram of a guidance system for an industrial<br>
scale installation, in particular a power plant installation.<br>
The schematically illustrated guidance system 1 here comprises<br>
a plurality of modules or components (not shown in detail<br>
here), as are in common and standard use in industrial scale<br>
installations and in particular in power plant installations.<br>
In particular the power plant installation is provided with a<br>
plurality of measuring points or sensors, by way of which the<br>
parameters of components and parts during operation are<br>
monitored and optionally archived. These sensors and measuring<br>
points include a plurality of sensors and measuring points by<br>
way of which the fatigue of individual components or parts of<br>
the power plant installation is monitored during operation.<br>
To this end in addition to other components the guidance<br>
system 1 comprises a storage facility 2, which is designed<br>
specifically to archive and hold the measurement values and<br><br>
parameters determined in the context of fatigue monitoring.<br>
Stored in particular in the storage facility 2 are the<br>
component parameters for the components and parts selected as<br>
being particularly relevant for fatigue monitoring, with a<br>
specific set of parameters being assigned in particular to<br>
each relevant part or component, this set of parameters<br>
containing material data, geometric dimensions and the<br>
pressure and temperature points of significance for fatigue<br>
calculation in the respective component or positioning data<br>
for this purpose. The monitored measurement values are also<br>
stored in the storage facility 2 as required, with one the one<br>
hand a number of installation operating parameters<br>
characterizing the operating state of the power plant<br>
installation being stored, for example characteristic values<br>
for load state, target loads and the like. Further relevant<br>
component operating parameters for the selected components of<br>
the power plant installation are also stored, with continuous<br>
ambient conditions such as air pressure, air temperature, air<br>
humidity of the parts to be monitored and their temperatures<br>
and pressures also being stored in the manner of measurement<br>
value capturing. The measurement values M characterizing these<br>
are determined in a measurement value capturing unit 4, which<br>
for its part is connected on the data input side to the<br>
corresponding sensors, and stored on the storage facility 2 as<br>
required.<br>
The measurement value capturing unit 4 however also transfers<br>
the determined data to an evaluation unit 6, in which<br>
characteristic fatigue values are determined as required for<br>
the respective parts or components. The evaluation unit 6 here<br>
is not only designed to determine a current actual state for<br>
the respective part fatigue but the evaluation unit 6 also<br>
determines an assigned predicted fatigue value for the or each<br><br>
selected component, which uses a planned state change, for<br>
example a load change process or the like, based on the<br>
current fatigue state of the respective component, to describe<br>
its expected fatigue state after the respective state change<br>
has been implemented.<br>
In order to be able to make such a prediction for expected<br>
fatigue of the or each part, the guidance system 1 comprises<br>
an input unit 8, by way of which target parameters E<br>
characterizing the state change to be analyzed in each<br>
instance can be input. In particular when analyzing a load<br>
change the power plant output to be set and the time period<br>
available for achieving the planned output level are input.<br>
The measurement value capturing unit 4 and the input unit 8<br>
are connected on the data output side to a first simulation<br>
module 10 of the evaluation unit 6. In the first simulation<br>
module 10 the operating program for the power plant<br>
installation required to achieve the respective target<br>
parameters and a trend curve of the relevant process<br>
parameters, such as pressures, temperatures and throughputs<br>
for example, are first calculated beforehand from the measured<br>
ambient conditions and installation operating parameters as<br>
well as the target parameters input in the input unit; 8 for<br>
the state or load change to be evaluated. During this process<br>
a thermodynamic simulation and/or a thermodynamic model of the<br>
power plant is taken into account, with the thermodynamic<br>
model being stored in the first simulation module 10. The<br>
result of the thermodynamic simulation in the first simulation<br>
module 10 here, in addition to other parameters, is in<br>
particular the trend curves for pressures and media<br>
temperatures in the parts or components to be monitored.<br><br>
The results are transferred to a second simulation module 12,<br>
in which the trend curves for pressures and temperatures in<br>
the respective component or part are used to determine the<br>
trend curves for the internal wall and central wall<br>
temperatures for the parts to be monitored. This is done using<br>
construction and material parameters, which are held in the<br>
storage facility 2.<br>
In a subsequent third simulation module 14 the temperatures<br>
and pressures determined in the parts or components are used<br>
to determine the stress curves in the walls of the parts, with<br>
component-specific parameters or data records stored in the<br>
storage facility 2 also being used as required.<br>
In a subsequent fourth simulation module 16 the determined<br>
stress curves for each part or component to be monitored are<br>
used to determine an expected fatigue contribution for the<br>
state or load change to be analyzed. In a subsequent fifth<br>
simulation module 18 the part or component is finally<br>
determined, for which the sum of the current characteristic<br>
fatigue contribution, which is held in the storage facility 2,<br>
and the additional fatigue contribution determined in the<br>
preceding fourth simulation module 16 and due to the state or<br>
load change to be evaluated is greatest. This part or<br>
component is identified as the "guide component" and is used<br>
as the relevant part in subsequent evaluations. The predicted<br>
fatigue value of the guide component is considered to be an<br>
expected fatigue contribution for the installation as a whole<br>
and is output for example in an output unit 20 for further<br>
evaluation or to inform operating personnel.<br>
If different types of predicted fatigue values are determined<br>
appropriately, it is thus possible to plan a maintenance or<br><br>
repair intervention in a particularly demand-actuated manner,<br>
in that the expected fatigue of the guide component is<br>
compared in an appropriate manner with the limit values that<br>
are permitted or deemed permissible. Additionally or<br>
alternatively a number of different types of state or load<br>
changes can be simulated in the manner of scenario planning,<br>
with the determined predicted fatigue values being used to<br>
select the load scenario resulting in the smallest additional<br>
loading of the parts so that it can be used for the further<br>
operation of the installation.<br><br>

storage facility (2), in which a number of installation<br>
operating parameters characterizing the respective operating<br>
state of the technical installation and a number of component<br>
operating parameters of relevance for a number of selected<br>
components in the technical installation are stored, and which<br>
is connected on the data side to an evaluation unit (6), which<br>
is designed for the respective determination as required of a<br>
characteristic fatigue value characterizing the current<br>
fatigue state of the or each selected component based on the<br>
stored installation operating parameters and/or the stored<br>
assigned component operating parameters,<br>
characterized in that the evaluation unit (6) is designed<br>
a)	to determine an assigned predicted fatigue value for the or<br>
each selected component based on the characteristic fatigue<br>
value characterizing the current fatigue state on the basis of<br>
guidance parameters characterizing a planned change of state,<br>
b)	to identify the highest predicted fatigue value as the<br>
guide component, and<br>
c)	to determine a predicted fatigue value of the guide<br>
component respectively for a number of planned state changes.<br><br>
The invention relates to a method for operating an industrial<br>
scale installation, especially a power plant<br>
installation, according to which a number of installation<br>
operating parameters characterising the operating state of the<br>
technical installation, and a number of component operating<br>
parameters respectively relevant to a number of selected<br>
components of the technical installation, are monitored and<br>
stored in a memory device (2). A fatigue characteristic<br>
value characterising the current fatigue state of each<br>
component is determined for the or each selected<br>
component as required, on the basis of the stored installation<br>
operating parameters. The air of the inventio is to especially<br>
develop an operation of the installation which especially<br>
protects resources. To this end, an associated fatigue prognosis<br>
value is determined from the fatigue characteristic value character<br>
sing the current fatigue state for the or each selected component,<br>
on the basis of guiding parameters characterising a planned<br>
change of state.</td>
