This invention relates to the uses of the pregnane glycoside(s), and tlie saponins and bitters of caraUuma species of plants, is the trcatmcol and management of symptoms/disorders such as obesity, overweight, high BMI(Body Mass Index), low BMR(Basal Metabolic Rate), hypertension, hyperglycaemia, hypercholesterolemia, osteo-arthritis, migraine, clinical depression, loss of hearing, sexual dysfunction, low stamina, endurance and energy levels, reduced cognitive and memory functions, capillary degeneration, joint inflammation/degeneration, drcuiation disorder, aging s&gt;Tidrome, menopausal syndrome and otliers; in the alteration/ improvement/regulation of conditions/parameters/functions such as appetite level, weight, BMI, BMR, waist, arm and hip circumferences, fat levels, lean body mass, blood sugar, blood pressure(bp), total blood cholesterol, blood HDL/LDL ratio, stamina, energy and endurance levels, cognitive and memory function, hearing, aging, joint mobility, mood, sexual stamina and power, capillar^' health and others and in skin nooiishment and as an anti-oxidant, anti-inflammation and anti-depressant agent.    This invention fiirther relates to n^thods of said treatment/management and of said alteration/improvement/ regulation and to jHegnane glycoside compositions therefor, said compositions optionally further comprising additional tterapeutical, nutraceutical or nutrition components.   This invention also provides for processes for admixture for ma^dng said compositions.<br>
Obesit&gt;' is a major public health problem the world over in view of the direct and indirect economic and social costs of obesity.  One of the major causes of obesit&gt;' is the stressfiil and sedentary- lifestyles of modem life and the widespread adoption of diets that cc ^tain large amounts of high calorie processed foods.   The problem is particularly acute and widespread in some industriahsed counxries.<br>
Obesity is a direct causal contributor to the pathophysiology of a number Df diseases and causes exacerbation in several others.   Some of said disoiders/syn^)toms are: diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, stroke and others.<br>
Obesity is being increasingly combated medically by providing treatments for weight-reduction and for coping with, and managfiraent of associated symptoms/disorders spch as high blood sugar, b.p., jomt pains and otiiers.<br><br>
Weight reduction and related treatments such as regulation of BMI(Bod&gt;' Mass IndexX iacreasing lean mass, increasing BMR(Basal Metabolic Rate), ?se also being inoeasin^^ adqxed by people who are not strictly clinically obese but do so for personal or social reasons sodi as the desire to feel and look good. ITie uses/metliods/compositions of this invention are also relevant to said people.<br>
These inventors have worited extensively on said problems/disorders and ha\'e developed novel uses of said pregnane ^ycoside(s) in the treatment and management of 6besit&gt;" and obesitj^^^lated dfisoiders/'sjinptoms and other disorders/symptoms.      According to the invention, the pregnane glycosides for said uses, may be caratuberside or bouceroside or others or mixtures thereof or may be <xie of the extiacts caralluma plants containing said pregnane giycosi and msy include therein saponin glyccsde bitters caralluma. glycosides their various isomers. siinilarh this invention provides for methods treatment management obesity obe related alteration by administration effective doses pregbme or mixtures extracts. further pregnai ghxosidc compositions uses methods. still fiuther processes making sadd admixture constituents thereof coiqx>sitiQiis and processes of this invention relate also to disordeis/symptoms and conditions/parameters^functions odier than those lelated to obesity.<br>
It is the observation of these inventors that the pregnane glycosides and oilier constitueBte of caralluma are highly effective for treatment and management of obesity and obesity-rdated discrders%ymptoms and other said disorders.   Said glycosides have been tested to be non-toxic and generally fiee of side effects. In cases where side effects were observed during the tests tl^ were onfy gastro-inte^HBsal(Gn in nature and were minimal and transient.   Said side effects were generally found to cease within about a week of the commencement of treatment.<br>
The principles of caralluma relevant to said uses and methods of this invention are said pregnane glycosides thereof.   Preferably, said glycosides are caratuberside and/or bouceroside or mivtines thereof<br><br>
and includes the isomers thereof   More preferably, said compositions m^ mixtiires of caratuberside and bouceroside which are found to exhibit strong synergj' effects particularly with respect to their apphcations for treatment and management of obesity and obesity-related disorders/symptoms.  Preferably, the ratio of caratuberside and bouceroside in compositions for said uses and said methods of the invention is from 9:1 to 19:1 by wt.   Some compositions of this invention ftirth^ comprise the saponin glycoside(s) and the bitters of carailuma and/or other additional therapeutical, nutraceutical or nutritional components.<br>
The pregnane glycosides for said uses and methods may be isolated from materials of plant origin sudi as for example, the carailuma species of plants or they may have been produced by as yet apparently unknown chemical synthesis methods.  Or they may be one of the extracts of the carailuma q)ecies of plants.    As the caratuberside-bouceroside ratio(CBR) found in nature in tiie carailuma ^}ecies of plants is almost equal to the value at which said synergy is a maximum it is advantageous to directfy employ a carailuma plant extract in said uses/methods of the inventioa   These inventors have developed said caralliuna plant extracts and processes of making the same by 'die extraction of carailuma plant matter.  This forms the subject-matter of their application for Indian patent No. 451/MAS/2003 dated 4'*' June 2003.<br>
Thus, this invention provides for said treatment and management and said alteration/improvement/ regulation by the use of, that is, administration of said pregnane glycosides, prefer^ly caratuberside and bouceroside.   This invention, therefore^ focuses on said caratuberside-bouceroside mixtures that offer considerable synergj^ and in particular, mixtures having caratuberside content from about 90% to about 95% w/w. for said uses, methods and compositions of the invention.<br>
Carailuma plants also contain some saponin glycoside compounds which are present in small quantities and which are precursors of a number of useful products.   However, their role in said uses and mefliods of the invention is insignificant except for one application discussed hereinbelow and could therefore be left substantially unextracted when preparing said carailuma pregnane glycoside extracts for the uses/ metliods/compositions of the invention.  The term 'glycoside(s)' in the further specification hereinbelow. therefore, generally refers to said pregnane glycosides unless otherwise required by the context.<br><br>
Caralluma plant matter also contains bitters which are also of significance medically and healthwise and some novel applications thereof are provided hereinbelow wherein said pregnane giycoside(s) includes some amounts of said saponin glycoside(s) and/or said bitters.<br>
It would be possible to isolate any of the caralluma glycosides in pure form and then use tliem either singly or as mixtures in the said uses/methods/compositions of the inventioa   Altemativeiy, said glycosides could be obtained by synthesis methods.   A still further altCTuative is to obtain a mixture of caratuberside and bouceroside by extraction of caralluma plant matter(or any other plant matter containing pregnane glycosides).   References to glycosides also mean reference to their isomers.  Two isomers of caratuberside and ten of bouceroside are known to be present in caralluma.   Within the scope of the invention, said glycosides in the uses/methods/compositions of the invention ^nay be in their unconverted forms or in tlie form of any of the pharmaceutically accepted salts thereof.   Any of the pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be used with the glycosides which may be in their converted or unconverted forms.<br>
As mentioned, this invention preferably provide^ for the use of the caralluma extracts wherein, by carefully conducting the extraction process substantially the entire caratuberside and bouceroside content in the plant material is extracted and the said CBR value in the plant material substantially preserved in tl\e extraa. Tlie said earlier application for paten. &gt;y these inventors proAides both a liquid form extract of glycosides in aq. ethanoi solution and solid form extract wherein the extracted ^ycosides are adsorbed on a suitable excipient. These extracts are easily convertible into any of the pharmaceutically acceptable forms for administration to subjects, such as for example, tablets, capsules, suspensions and injections. Conversion of the glycosides in tiie extracts into the form of any of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be easily carried out if required and said salts are wifliin the scope of the invention.     Said conversions may be carried out by an) of the known processes.<br>
Known pharmaceutical options for treatment of obesitv'. that is, for weight reduction are: thermogenesis, lipase inliibitors and compounds that suppress app^te and/or stimulate the central nervous system(CNS).<br><br>
The thermogenesis method involves the raising of the body core temperature shghtly.   This increases the metabolism of deposited lipids in the body.  Ttermogenesis drugs act on the brain and the tiiyroid gland resulting in said increase of body core temperature.<br>
Lipase inhibitors work by reducing absorption of fat in the intestine system.   Thus, when a lipase inhibitor is administered to a subject, the fet portion of the food consumed by the subject passes through his intestinal system imabsoifoed and is ehminated in the stools.<br>
Appetite suppressants/CNS stimulators act by modifying the levels of neurotransmitters such as catecholamine and serotonin in the blood leading to decreased feeling of hmiger.<br>
All three abovementioned approaches to obesity treatmoit and management have been found to have strong to unacceptable side effects.<br>
Thermogenesis, by its nature, carries risk of sde effects such as o\'er5timulation of vital functions such as cardiac rhytlmi, blood pressure, neurotransmitter levels and the endocrine system.   Subjects experience nervousness, anxiety, hypersensitivity to stimulii, insomnia and irregular heartbeats.<br>
The side effects associated with known lipase inhibitors are GI in nature.  Patients report oily and fatty stools and increased bowel movement.  They also complain of urgency of bowel movement and sometimes inability- to control the same.   Oily spotting may also occur between bowel movements.  A yet another side effect is the loss of fat soluble vitamins jH^sent in the food.   They are carried away by the unabsorbed fat into the stools.  For tliese reasons, patient comphance is found to be a problem in lipase inhibitor treatments.<br><br>
When appetite suppressants and CNS stimulators are used, side eflfects arise from the altered neurotransmitter function.   Tliese include increased heart rate, hypertension, anxiety, mood alterations, diaphoresis, dizziness, swelling of extremities, dryness of mouth, constipation and insomnia.<br>
Said known obesity treatments are, furthermore, contraindicated in many clinical situations sucli as hypertensive obese patients or patients sufFering from coronary artery disease, cardiomegaly and some chronic GI disorders such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome.<br>
In conBast, as observed by th^se inventors, pregnane ^ycosides act without interfering with the digestion process or thermogenesis or neurotransmitter levels.   A carailuma extract(containing the pregnane glycosides thereoO acts on the Kreb's cycle(citric acid cycle) at critical points thereof such as to inhibit fet sjntheas in the hver and other cells of the subject and oihance fat buming(fet metabolism).<br>
These inventors believe that pregnane glycosides also act on the hunger centres in the teain and reduce the feeling of appetite.   Remarkably, this action occurs in the case of pregnane glycosides without any side effects arising, as was first observed by these im^entors. Pregnane glycosides seem to siq)pTess appetite withoctt causing any significant distuibance in the neurotransmittea fimctioning unlike as in the case of the known 25&gt;petite-suppressants.   These inventors have fiirther found that pregnane glycosides also apparently increase thennogenesis without manifestation of any side effects observed with the known thermosjenesis enhancers.<br>
Carallmna is indeed a food item that has been consumed in the past, and still a)nsumed as a food by some population groups in India    its non-toxicity, and that of the pregnane glycosides thereof, is therefore well establiseied and further verified by clinic 1 tests conducted by these inventors.    This invention, therefore, provides for carallmna pregnane gIycosides(and said extracts) not only as a medicinal product but also as a health-f3\Tng and health-ensuring food supplement  Thus, this invention offers carailuma pregnane glycosides and other carailuma constituents also as nutraceutical products for consumption either by<br><br>
themselves or in conjunction (x mivture witfea variet)-' of other food supplements, energy enhancers and otlier health products.<br>
Caralluma is a group of succulent species fysnd v,ild in India, Afghanistan, Arabia, Southern Europe, Sri Lanka and others.   Caralluma fdants are SEBSH, erect and fleshy although some species have recumbent stems.   The stems are 4-grooN^ed and are firam 10-40 mm thick( 1/2" to 1-1/2").  The spines of the stems are actually the leaves of the plant  Caralhsma plants bear star-shaped, fleshy flowers in a range of dark colours from purple and blade to red and drfc brown.   Well over two hundred caralluma q)ecies are known.   Some of the caralluma ^)ecies investigated by these inventors are; C. indica, C. fimbriata, C. attenuata, C. tubercolata, C,. edulis, C. adscsaidens, C. slalagmifera, C. nmbellata, C lasiantha and C. penicillata.  Although some limited and noo-conclusive tests and animal trials appear to have been done in the past on some medicinal pn^itics of csalluma, no tests, animal trials or human clinical trials appear to have been conducted on the «;^[&gt;etite-suppcession property or on weight reduction and other obesity symptoms related properties <f pregnane gijcosides. this also applies to the of said glycosides related other disorders>Ti^)toms mc^oned hereinabove.<br>
This invention therefore, is sq^paieady first BO establish the appetile-sui^xession, weight reduction and related properties of caiallunia extracts relevant to treatment and management of obesit)' and obesity-related disorders/symptoms and other said disorders/symptoms and also the properties relevant to said aUeration/regulation/inq&gt;rovanent of said conditions/parameters/functions.    The properties have been established by carefully designed and conc&amp;icted animal trials and subsequently clinical trials on human subjects.    This invention is also first in cosrelating said properties to the pregnane glycosides contained in the caralluma species of plants and to oth^ members of the pregna lie gfycosides group.<br>
fhus, this invention provides for novel uses of caralluma glycosides and/or said caralluma extracts in tlie treatment and management of obesity and Gft&gt;esit\' related disorders/symptoms and other disorders/symptoms wherein said ^ycosides and/or extracts are administered to achieve weight reduction, reduction of BMI, reduction of faL reductBom in waist hip and arm circumferences, reduction of blood<br><br>
glucose, reduction of blood pressure, increase of lean body mass, increase of BMR, reduction in blood cholesterol, enhancement of the blood HDL/LDL ratio, appetite siq}i»ession, enhanced stamina, energy and endurance levels, improved hearing, imjHOVvd capillary health, improved cognitive sad memory function and/or for traitment and management of clinical dq}ression, migraine, osteo-anhritis. aging syndrome, menopausal syndrome, mood elevation and joint inflammation and to inqx^^ve/regula^ these parameters/conditions/functions.<br>

According to the invention, there is further provided methods for the treatment and management for said disorders/symptoms and for the alteration/improvement/regulation of said paran^'^ters/fimctions/conditions mentioned hereinabove.<br>
Still further, according to the invention, there is provided pharmaceutical compositions containing pregnane glycoside(s) in the form of extracts of the caralluma species of plants or otherwise, for the treatment and management of said disorders/symptoms and for the alteration/improvemcnt/regulati(Hi of said parameters/functions/conditions, comprising said pregnane glycoside(s) and q&gt;tionally including therein the saponin glycoside(s) and/or the bitters of the caralluma species of plants and furthermore, optionally comprising one or more additional therapeutical, nutraceutical or nutritional components. Still further, according to the invention, there is provided processes of admixture for making said pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
This invention also provides for novel food supplement com4)ositions containing said glycosides and/or said extracts for use in regulation of weight and other said obesity-related parameters and other paramelers/functions/conditions.   In addition to said glycosides and/or extracts, said siqjplements may comprise first, second and further addition^ components that enhance the p^orraance of said glycosides and/or extracts, synergistically or otherwise, or that complement said extracts/glycosides in terms of the action thereof on one or mere of said symptoms/disorders or parameters/functions/conditions or in providing additional nutrition.  This invention provides for novel uses of said food supplement compositions and for methods of use thereof   Within the scope of the invention said supplements may contain one or more said additional components, tliat is, in addition to said pregnane glycoside(s).<br>
The said uses and metliods of this invention may be adopted for control/regulation of one or more said pai anieters/conditions/fiinctions to particular, or desired values and also to correct those that have deviated and require to be brought in hne with tl&gt;e said particular/desired values.<br>
This invention has found that per day dosage of between 10 mg. to 1500 mg. of caratuberside or caraiuberside-bouceroside miMiues do not exhibit any toxicity or side effects except for said transient<br><br>
effects experienced by some subjects.    In ilie clinical trials that are described further hereinbelow the dosage followed was 300 mg. per day of said caratuberside-bouceroside mixture, the ratio of the two said components(CB Ratio) therein being from about 9:1 to about 19:1.      Subsequently higher doses of about 450 mg. per day per subject were adopted.  Increased doses resulted correspondingly in increased change in the parameter(s), all other things being equal indicating that the two were generally proportional.   These inventors observe that this proportionaUty of doses and effects extends upto at least 1500 mg. per day doses. Thus, this invention provides for designing the said doses to obtain desired speeds of transformation of said parameters/functions/conditions-<br>
Said doses may contain said glycosides in the unconverted forms or otherwise.   Said glycosides, converted or unconverted may be associated with any of the known pharmaceutically accepted carriers and excipients and furthermore be in the form of any of the pharmaceutically accq&gt;ted salts.  Tlie compositions may include an)^ pharmaceutically acceptable and/or edible colouring agents, flavouring agents and other additives.<br>
The linkage between the pregnane glycosides and the effects thereof in said treatments and management and said alteration/improvement/rsgulation is established by the said animal tests and clinical trials conducted by these inventors first in India and then in the USA.   TTiese provide statistical evidence confirming said therapeui ^ and health effects thereof<br>
Said tests/trials were conducted at established and recognised medical institutions.   In India, the trials were done at the St John's Medical College &amp; Hospital at Bangalore, India under the direction of Prof Dr. Anura V. Kurpad, M.D., FLD., Dean, Institute of Population Health &amp; Ginical Research, Bangalore, India. The US trials were under Dr. Ronald W. Lawrence and Dr. Suneeta Qiaudbaiy of the Western Geriatric Research Institute, Los Angeles, California, USA.    At the completion of the test at Bangalore, India the subjects expressed desire to continue with the carallimia extract doses.    Said tests and the extended Bangalore tests and other tests have established the effecti% eness of caraltunia glycosides in reducing/eliminating arthritic pains/aches, reducing blood sugar, reducing BP and efFecting changes in other parameters/fimctions/condition mentioned hereinabove.     They have established the efticac\' of<br><br>
pregnane glycosides in die treatment/management of said obesity-related symptoms/disorders and otlier said disorders/symptoms and in .the said alteration/improvement/regulation of various parameters/ functions/ conditions.<br>
A mutagenicity study(Reverse Mutation Test on Caralluma extract) by Salmonella typhimuhum was conducted by M/s. Intox Private lAl, of Dist. Pune, Maharashtra, India under Dr. P.Y.Naik, Director and Dr. N.S. Deshmukh, Study Director.     The study was in accordance with the OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practices(OECD, 1998) and OECD Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals, Section 4, No. 471 adopted 2 i July 1997. The stuity concluded that Caralluma extract is Non-Mutagenic in Salmonella typhimuhum strains TA 1535, TA 97A, TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102.<br>
A report on the risks and efficacy of caralluma extracts based on the abovementioned animal and human<br>
studies and other evidence on car^luma was commissioned from Dr. Kany T. Preuss, M.D., M. A.C.N.,<br>
C.N.S., Prof Of Physiology, Medkine and Pathology, Georgetown University Medical Centre, Washington<br>
DC 20057, USA.    Said rqwrt notes:<br>
i.	the absence of any adverse event reports on caralluma from the Indian subcontuiental area where<br>
caralluma has been a past of the food chain for several population groups over hundreds of years,<br>
the average daily intake by said population groups ranging from about 100 gms. to about 400<br>
gms. of caralluma planl matter,<br>
ii.	that apparently no alteration of the chemical na ue of the caralluma principles occurs during the<br>
process of extraction of the plant matter by aq. ethanol,<br>
iii.	the heav}^ metal cont^t of caralluma extracts was found lo be quite low and well within limits<br>
based on several separate investigations,<br>
iv.	tliat various tests indicate extremely low amounts(well within safe limits) of hexane, methanol,<br>
2-propano)ol, chloroform, 1,4-dioxane, methylene chloride and trichloroethylene in caralluma<br>
extracts,<br>
v.	tliat the said 2 month long test programme at Bangalore, India referred to hereinabove is<br>
suggestive of weight loss althougli the differences were not significant in magnitude. However,<br><br>
that there was a significant drop in waist circumferences suggesting that a part of the tat loss<br>
must iiave been masked by muscle build-up,<br>
vi.	that tests on various categories of diabetic mice clearly shew significant lowering of blood<br>
glucose levels through an 'insulin-Uke' action, that is, by increased release of insulin and/or<br>
sensitisation of the animal to lesser amounts of insulin, vii.        that caralluma extracts have anti-nociceptive and anti inflammatory action in addition to anti-<br>
hyperglycaemic property.<br>
Tlie mechanism of action of caralluma glycosides in producing said effects is not at present fiilly understood and requires more work to ascertain and establish the aene.   However, the general outline of the mechanism are prcq)0sed herein by these inventors and in this context these inventors make the undermentioned observations.  It may be noted that this is without commitment by this in\'ention to any specific mechanism or nuxie of action.  It may be relevant to mention again at this point that the link between said caralluma glycosides and said effects is conclusively established by the statistical evidence provided by said tests/trials.<br>
The biochemical processes of carbohydrate, protein and fet mdabo&amp;m and of the breakdown and biosyntliesis of fats relevant to the subject of this invoiticm are summarised below.<br>
i.   Carbohydrates, proteins and fats are broken down in cells to generate energy in the form of energy carrying molecules such as ATP(Adenosine triphosphate).   Said breakdown also produces p\Tu\ic acid that dififuocs into the mitochondria where a series of reactions produces, inter alia, acetyl coenzyme A and oxaloacetate.   Com x)unds NAD and FAD are also produced.   They carry activated hydrogen atoms that subsequently take part in fat svnthesis reactions.   A further reaction finks acetyl coenzyme A and oxaloacetate to give a molecule that is c^5able of diffusion across the mitochondrial wall into the cell MT cytoplasm.   The NAD and FAD also diffuse out into the cytoplasm where tcgethCi with acetyl coenzyme A the)' undergo various reactions ending with synthesis of fat molecules.<br><br>
ii.   In the cytoplasm an enzyme called citrate lyase catalyses the breakdown of said combined molecale into its constituent parts, oxaloacetate and acetyl coenzyme A.   The action of citrate lyase is critical in that blocking the action thereof would prevent formation of acetyl coenzyme A in the cytoplasm and tliereby disrupt the fat synthesis process in the cells.<br>
iii.   The precursor(buil<fing block of fat synthesis in the cells is malonyl coenzjone a which produced from acetyl coenzyme a. key to fet s>iithesis in cells and if the production thereof is eitter prevented or restricted, the fat synthesis is similaTiy afiFected.<br>
iv.   Both &amp;t breakdowxi(£at n^tabolism) and fat synthesis occur simultaneously in cell cytoplasm particularly in hver cells.   The &amp;t breakdown is promoted(catalysed) by an enzyme called carnitine acyltransferase.  Relative levels of carnitine acyltransferase and malonyl coenzyme A determine the balance between the twin reactions of fet synthesis aiKl breakdown, more of one promoting one while more of the other promoting the other.<br>
V.	Acetyl coenzyme A is also consumed in the mitochondria to g^ierate/release energy.  Only when<br>
tlie energ&gt;' requirements of a cell are met that excess acetyl coenzyme A gets formed that migrates to the c}tpplasm where it partakes in fat synthesis as mentioned above.<br>
vi.     An important faaor is the feeling of satiety/hungw that arises in the hypothalamus.   The hypothalamus receives signals from the stomach conveying the position, that is, the fulhiess or otherwise of the stomach.   This is translated into the appropriate feeling of himger or satiety in the brain.   Via another channel the brain also receives signals indicating the posit '(m about glucose and glycogen levels in the liver.   If these lev els are high, they generate a feeling of satiety in the brain and vice versa.<br>
Tnis invention observes that pregnane glycosides block the action of said enzyme citrate lyase and'cr direct its aaion av^ ay from splitting the combined acetyl coenzyme A-oxaloacetate structure.  The resultant drop<br><br>
of acetyl coenzyme A levels in the cytoplasm decreases 6t synthesis.   These inventors further believe that pregnane glycosides inhibit the action of malonyl coenz&gt;tne A in fiu synthesis.    Thus, caralluma glycosides provide two-fold action in decreasing &amp;* s&gt;iithesis: ooe by decreasing the formation of malonyl coenzyme A and the other by inhibiting the action of malonyl coeoz^ine A generated.<br>
Decrease of malonyl coenzyme A levels shifts the malonyl coen^Toe A-camitine acyltransferase balance in favour increased fat breakdown as opposed to fat s&gt;Tithesis.  Thos, under the effect of pregnane glycosides a body not only decreases fet SNiithesis but spsods i^ fid breakdown(fat metabolism).   The effect is greater release of energy, that is an enhancement of BMR.   The latter effect is more sigiiificant because the scope for decrease in fat s^Tithesis is quite small in view of the fact that the amoimts of M synthesised by a body in a day is, in any case, a small quantity.   The increased fat metabolism and the increase of BMR makes a subject feel more eneri^tk; ui£ke as la die case of the known ai^tite suppressants and, as will be observed from die fiiidier <fcscripiiaa itereinbelow these together with other properties of the pregnane glycosides has a cascade effect on so mmsy body functions parameters and processes causing improvements thoeof pr are thus energy stamina enhancers provide increased okiurance. ttes medsnism action been first observed by inventors.></fcscripiiaa>
These inventors also found that pregnane glycosides also act on tie h&gt;pothalamus to generate a feeling of satiety and well-being and reduce the feeling of hunge-.   This oocors without any side effects such as those associated with known a{q)etite-sup|xessant&amp;.    Pregnane ^hpcosides also act in the liver to direct the lipids towards glycogen productioa    Increased ^ycogsn level also contributes towards the reduction in the feeling of hunger felt by a subjecl.<br>
Tlds mechanism of the action of pregnane glycosides in relatiao ID obesity and obesity-related symptoms/'disorders and parameters/'conditi<wis has apiaaently not been known before in the prior art. description given hereinabove establishes ac said effects of pregnane glycosides relation to various syinptoms associated with obesity.></wis><br>
The basis of said effects in relation to obesit&gt;' and obesity-related symptoms/disorders is the appetite-reducing, tlie fat syntliesis disruption, the fat metabolism increase and other properties of the pregnane glycosides.   Specifically, the obesity and obesity related fimctions/parameters/conditions/disorcfcrs/ symptoms that are affected by pregnane glycosides are: weight, obesit&gt;', BMR, BMT, blood sugar. BP. blood lipids, appetite, lean body mass, waist, arm and hip circumferences, joints and others.  Otho' properties of pregnane glycosides that come into action are: inqHX&gt;ving capillary health, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and others.<br>
The further description given hereinbelow establishes the said effects of the pregnane ghcosides as regards several other non-obesity disorders/symptoms/fimctions/conditions/p^ameters.    With regard to o^eo-arthritis and joint degeneration/inflammatiou, these inventors observe that the action of pregnane glycosides is very significant as it provides not only reduction/elimination of said inflammatioa but also improvement in the health of the joints by reducing/reversing the degen^ation of the bone and synovial tissue.  Pregnane glycosides have both anti-arthritic and anti-inflammation prq&gt;erties.   Caralhima extracts, furthermore, cause increased secretion of the synovial fluid whidi increases joint efficieDcy and mobility.   With pregnane glycosides, morning stiffness is eitiier reduced or eliminated and the jfoints feel stronger and are able to take up greater loads.<br>
With regard to clinical depression and mood elevation, these inventors observe that pregnane ^ycosides acE through intei-vention in the neurotransmitter levels.  This has not been c*served/reported in pvkrr an Ttie cormection between pregnane glycosides and clinical dq&gt;ression mi in mood ele\:ation w^s first observ^ed by these inventors during said clinical trials on the ^^&gt;etite-suiTOession and weight reducing properties of caralluma extracts.     It was observed that sidyects taking the extracts experienced an increased feeling of well-being, enhanced energy levels, mood elevation and increased tolerance to pain and stress.   Clinical depression is characterised by pathological changes in nemotransmrtter fuoctioii. especially catecholamine levels.    Significantly, low levels of serotoiun(5 hydrox\tr&gt;-ptamine. 5HT) ba\'e been demonstrated in neurochemical disorders like clinical depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, social phobia and hypochondria.   Serotoran is also apparentiy involved in the sensation of hunger.  These inventors belie\ e that through its effect on the neurotransmitter serotonin and others in the supjpression of<br><br>
appetite, pregnane gl&gt;^coside(s) is able to simultaneously provide mood elevation, increased ability to cope with stress and greater social interests.    Unlike the known anti-depresssants of the SSRI class(Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inliibitors), pregnane glycosides do not have cardiovascular side effects or others such as dysrhythmia and hvpertension.   Adoption of SSRI*s often results in serotonin intoxication unlike in the case of pregnane glycosides. Serotonin intoxication can cause aggressive/violent or erratic behaviour, insomnia and hyperactive state in subjects.<br>
One of the most common form of sexual dysfunction is primary impotence,, that is, erectile dysfunction(ED).  ED is caused by various psycho-physiological factors including depression the eflFect of which is to restrict or decrease blood flow to the erectile tissue in the penis which is known as the corpus cavemosum.  While nitric oxide in blood relaxes the muscles in the penis to let more blood flow in, a phosphodiesterase enzyme called PDE5 inhibits the action of the nitric oxide.   Known treatments of ED are based on administering PDE5 inhibitors.  However, the action of PDE5 inhibitors is quite slow and furth^more has adverse cardiological efifects.  It is contra-indicated in cardiovascular patients and for people suffering from low or high BP particularly those on nitrate-based vasodilators.  PDE5 inhibitors are also known to induce depression, which itself is a known causai factor in ED.   The tests conducted by these inventors have demonstrated that pregnane glycosides increase energy levels in subjects; cause mood elevation and a feeling of well-being.   The anti-depressant propertiss of the pregnane glycosides are also relevant in this context These inventors observe that while ptegnane glycosides are not known to cause directly increased  lood flow to the penile tissue, they may be causing the same to happen by virtue of the mood-elevation, energy-enhancing, capillar}^ health restoring and anli-dq)Fessant properties thereof as the said tests confirm improvement in sexual function in subjects suffering from ED.   Increased fluid secretion in the male and female reproductive organs was also observed by the inventors. In female subjects, particulariy those suffering from age and/or menopausal syndrome, these inventors found that pregnane glycosides generated resurgence of sexual interest and increased hbido.<br>
Memoiy impairment and reduced retention are related to d^ Deurotrasmitta* levels in the brain, in particular serotonin levels. Pregnane glycosides, as observed by these inventors, cause enhancement of energy levels, libido and gastro-intcstinal motiUty.    Thev also cause mood elevation.     The resultant<br><br>
increase in serotonin levels g^ierates a feeling of well-being, increased perception of pain and stress, increased memoTV recaU and retention, increased speed of retrie\'al and augmented cognitive function<br>
This invention has observed ttat pregnane glycosides cause a reduction of total cholesterol in subjects and<br>
also an increase in4he HDL/LDL ratio.   The mechanism for this action is not understood but the effect<br>
mentioned has been demonstrated by the clinical tests described hereinabove.<br>
In the case of migraine attadcs, these inventors have found that pregnane gjiycosides decrease inflammation<br>
and pain and increases tolei^ice to stress and pain.   This invention has found that pregnai^ glycosides<br>
increase capillary elasticity and in general ensure capiillary health.  The anti-depressant and mood<br>
elevation property of pregnane glycosides gives a psychological boost to the subject and the higher<br>
serotonin levels generated by the glycosides increase the confidence level of the subject in facing u|^o the<br>
migraine attack.<br>
These inventors Fqx)ri that pn^nane glycosides enhance eneigy levels, oiduiance levels and increase<br>
stamina as outlined in the description hereinabove.   Hus action of pregnane glycosides together with<br>
reduced fat synthesis and increased fat burning helps buiW iq) musde tissue.    Thus, this invention<br>
provides for administraticm of pregnane glycosides for building \xp the lean body mass Pregnane<br>
glycosides and their formuiations are therefore, good diet adjuncts/supplements in sports and athletics<br>
training schedules.<br>
As regards diabetes, these inventors observe that preg. ane glycosides exhibit dual action: reduction of<br>
weight and effect on ttie hi»d metabolism and reducing/regulating blood sugar as established by the said<br>
tests/trials.   The clinical trials have also established the anti-hypertensive and anti-cholesteiolemic<br>
properties of caraiiuma extrads.<br>
These inventors observe that in view of the energy, stamina and endurance enhancing properties of<br>
caraiiuma and its property of restoring elasticity to capillaries and its anti-oxidation action is relevant for its<br>
use in the treatment of the aging syndrome.<br>
The role of pregnane glyco^d^^iitc^^sr^ regisneration and protection has been mentjooed (hereinabove.<br>
This forms the basis for tfier^mgy'rf^qsc^reof in tre^t^ raiiiMifcj- lAyuiSfation and maintaining capillary<br>
health as provided by this inventi^<br><br>
The role of pregnane ^ycosides in regenerating capillary walls is also the basis for the novel use of pregnane glycosides in treating loss of hearing as provMed ty this invention.    Pregnane glycosides restores capillaiy health in the ear region which leads to improveircnt in the hearing function. Said regeneration of capillaiy walls helps increase/r^l
The connection between pregnane glycosides and capiliaiy health is also the basis of the novel use thereof m skin nourishment as provided by this invention.    Thus, pregnane ^^'cosides can restore and maintain skin health such as of the face, arms and other parts of flie body.<br>
1 lie intake of carallunia glycosides by p<pilation groiq that au caralluma as a food may be anywhere upto mg. per day. furtho an intensive ld safety phannacological study conducted at tlie st. john medical college and hospital bangalore india acomiing to the oecd guidelines for testing of cheinicals oral toxicity-fixed dose method showed ik> mortality in rats upon administratian of a very high dose of 5 gms. per kg. body weight of caralluma fimbria extract containing about 50% wAv of pregnane glycosides. No fetahties or adverse effects were noted. These data indicate that the toxicity limit if any of pregnane glycosides is quite high and may be well above 5000 mg. per day for hi Tians.   This also establishes that accidental overdoses of pregnane glycosides(or caralluma extracts) do not pose an&gt;' risk.<br>
The clinical trials programme done at the St. John*s Medical College and Hospital, Bangalore, India was double' blind, controlled and randomised and followed the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research, New D ;lhi, India with regard to methodology and ethical considerations and other factors. Sixiy-two obese subjects wee selected at random for the test, fifty of who completed the test, the rest having dropped out during the test.  Half of the subjects who coiqdeted were on active medicine and the rest were on placebo.<br><br>
Each subject was examined at the commencement of the trials and then at the end of tlie first and second months.   The examinaticm included anthropometric parameters of body weight, waist circumference, MAC, hip circumference, Fat%. BIA Fat% and lean% and a series of biochemical measurements including blood sugar, lipid profile aid others.   The subjects were questioned about hunger level, vagQ to eat, fiiUness and thoughts on food and their responses recorded.<br>
Both parametric(paired 'f liest) and non-parametric tests such as Wilcoxon Signed Rank test(paired analysis) and Mann-Whitaey tesl(for unpaired analysis) were used to look for significant changes between time points and between tbe groups.   Both parametric ar i non-parametric tests gave similar results.<br>
In groupwise analysis, the Wilcoxon-Signed Rank Test was used to check differences between time points separately in each group.    Ilie significant values were based on p 
In the inter-groap analysis, difierences in change in each parameter were compared between the groups using Ndann-Wbitnev' test for independent compari^ns.   Significant differences were taken where p
The overall conclusions from the trials are that statistically significant differences between time points were seen in the acti\'e group tar the parameters of body weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, fat loss, blood pressure ajid himger levels while blood sugar and lipid profile did not show any significant<br>
results.<br>
Tlie doses adnnnisteied to the subjects consisted of an extract of caralluma fimbriala.   The aerial parts of the plant \^'ere extracted 'with 30% vA- aq. ethanol.  Resin removal was done with n-hexane solvent.  This &gt;ielded the caralluma glycosides in aq. ethanol solution.   This was concentrated and adsorbed on a suitable excipient    Tlie material was then dried and fiUed in hard gelatine c^sules.   The dried, adsorbed<br><br>
material contained either about 25% or 50° o wAv glycosides.  Each c^)sule contained 500 mg. of the said excipient adsorbed extract containing either 25% or 50% w/w pregnane glycosides giving capsules of two strengtlis, single and double.  The subjects lock two capsules a day, one before each meal.  The capsules given to tlie placebo group did not contain the e.\tracL  For some te^ involving low value doses, capsules containing 250 mg. of said extract containing 25% and 50% wAv pr^iane glycosides were used.<br>
The adverse effects observed were GI(gaslro-imestinaI) in nature and -were reported in both the groups, active and placebo.   TTie effects were moderate acidin', miW constipation and mild to moderate flatulence and subsided within a week of commencement of trials.    No adverse effects were noted in other syttemic functions.   No changes in ECG were obsen'ed.   No s&gt;Tiq&gt;adK)miiQedc effects were found.<br>
The American study by Dr. Ronald LawTence and Dr. Suneeta Chaodbaiy at the Western Geriatric Research Institute, Los Angeles, California, USA was done im 26 xaadomly selected overweight patients of whom 19 were placed in the active group while 7 were on |rfacdx&gt;.  The trials were done over a 4-week period.<br>
The subjects were taken from two active practices in the Los Angeles area and randomly assigned to tlie two groups.   The age profile varied from 31 to 73.   Two subjects decpped out during the tiials leaving 24 to complete the test<br>
The following parameters were measiu*ed before and at the end of tticte^: weight, height, hip and waist circimiference and b.p. All the subjects were adxised to pursue tKnaal pattern of activity, exercise and food intake and not to alter their diets during the test.<br>
The active group were given gelatine capsules containing an extract of Caralluma fimbriata.   The capsules for the placebo did not contain the extract. The sid&gt;jects wexe asked lo take two capsules a day one prior to each meal.   The active capsules contained 500 mg. of ihe extract eadi, said extract containing about 50% w/w of pregnane glycosides.<br><br>
Tlie extract incorporated in the capsules administered in the US study was prej^red as follows.   Aerial parts of Caralluma fimbriata were extracted with aq. ethanol and thai the extract was subjeaed to resin removal.  The extract was th^ concentrated, adsorbed on a suitable excipient and the material dried and then incorporated in gelatine capsules.<br>
The American study concludes that administration of Caralluma fimbriata extracts used in the weight reduction programme coupled with no change in daily activity pattern and diet of the subjects resulted in a statistically significant weight loss over a period of only four weeks.  Tlie study noted the lack of toxicity and the absence of any side effects.   The study recommends further trials and ^ates that there are few, if any over-the-counter natural substances which can produce such a weight reduction effect At the conclusion of the Indian study, the subjects expressed a voluntary desire to continue with the caralluma glycosides doses. The study wsis therefore extended and has alreacfy run over 12 nnxiths azid is continuing.  This has proved advantageous as the period of the earlier study was only two months. In the continuation study, the dosage has been increased to three capsules a day in a two-pius-one ^^em.  Tbe increased dosage and the longer period have given some important insists that were not apparent easlier. Thus, while the earher tesl did not show statistically significant effects as regards the blood sugar of die subjects, the link was clearly evident from the results of the ext^ided study.  The ext^ded tests hav« established that administration of pregnane ^ycosides does lead to reduction of biood sugar levels, reduction of BP, redaction of serum cholesterol and reduction of LDL together with enhancement of HDL cholesterol in blood.<br>
This invention has considered several said additional components that may be added to or taken in conjunction with the pregnane ^ycosides.   These are described hereinbelow.<br>
Garcinia(Garciiiia cambogia) extract is a known weight reducing agent.  It has been used as a food supplement in India and China over hundreds of years and its non-toxic nature is well established.  The active principle of Garcinia cambogia is (-)-hydroxycitrate, or HCA.<br><br>
HCA suppresses appetite a ad inhibits absorption and biosynthesis of fats, cholesterols and triglycerides. A dose of 3 mg. of HCA per kg, body weight is known to cause about 43% reduction in appetite at 6.5 hours and about 29% at 24 hours and is prefer^ly taken 30 to 60 minutes before meals.   The appetite reduction effect is dose dep^ident and no rebound eating is observed upon sto]q&gt;ing of tte dose.<br>
The effect of HCA on the brain and the neurotransmitter system in reduction of appetite does not appear to have any side effects. HCA also acts in the upper digestive tract in reducing fat absorption and during the Kreb's cycle to reduce fat biosynthesis.   HCA also acts in the liver and diverts carbohydrates from lipid biosynthesis to hepatic glycogen SNuthesis that also contributes to the feeling of reduced appetite.<br>
It will be observed that there are considerable simMarities in the action of the pregnane glycosides and HCA in appetite suppression and weight reduction Tliis invention therefore, provides for mixtures of pregnane glycosides(or caralluma extracts) and Gardnia extract(or HCA).   Said mixtures have been observed by these inventors to exhibit synergy in the treatment and management of obesity and obesity related symptoms and disorders and in said alteration/improvcment/regulaiion of the (Aesity related parameters/ccnditions/fimctions such as weight, BMI, BMR, waist, hip and arm circumferences, lean body mass, appetite suppression and others.   Said mixtures increase lean body mass by stimulating thennogenesis without any side effects.   Said mixtures also mildly reduce systolic and diastolic iM'essures and reduce cholestert,' by inhibiting its production in the liver.<br>
Glucosamine is known to be used for treatment and reUef in arthritis.  It gives strength to the cartilage and rigidity to the joints.     The^ inventors found that mixtures of glucosamine with pregnane glycosides(or caralluma extracts) is s&gt;Tiergistic in the treatment and maintenance of joint health.   Said mixtures enhance the synthesis of new cartilage and inhibit the action of the cartilage destroying enzymes.   The combination is far more effective in reducing joint pain and inflammadon and in enhancing joint mobility' than the sum of the actions obtainable individually by the r\vo components.   Glucosamine may be in the form of the sulphate or any of the other pharmaceutically accepted salts in the compositions disclosed herein<br><br>
Rutin is a bioflavonoid that has been i^ed in the treatment of arthritic pain.   Rutin is a capiliary protectant in that it restores elasticity to capillary walls.   Ajplication of Rutin restores blood flow to joints and thereby enliances secretion of the synovial fluid.    One of the other bioflavonoids may also be used: Hcsperidin, Diosinin or others.  This invention found synergy in mixtures of pregnane glycosides and Glucosamine and Rutin, mixtures of PG and glucosamine and in mixtures of pregnane glycoside and rutin and provides such mixtures for the ti^tment and management of osteo-arthritis and in the reduction/elimination of joint inflammation and pains. Said mixtures may also include Chondroitia Both Glucosamine sulphate and Chondroitin sulphate are acidic and therefore mixtures thereof with pregnane glycosides are j»c3blematic for subjects who suffer from gastric acidity.  For such subjects, this invention provides for mixtures of pregnane glycosides and Rutin or one of the other bioflavonoids.<br>
Green Tea extract has been known for use as an anti-oxidant, anti-aging, aiiti-microbial, anti-viral, anti-fimgal and an anti-cancer agent.  It has been also used in plasma diolesterol control and for control of blood glucose and insulin levels.   Green tea extract also inhibits the accumulaucm of &amp;t in the body and the liver in particular.  Its pre-emincm use is as an anti-aging aguit.   Pregnane glycosides are also anti-oxidation agents in their own right Pregnane glycosides provide energy boost, prevent/minimise joint pains and ensure capillary health.  Green (ea contains polyphenols that are also referred to as catechins. The major catechins in green tea extracts are: Epicatechin, Epigallocatechin, ^igallocatechin gallate(EGCG) and Epicatechin gallate.  EGCG is the stronge t anti-oxidant of the foiu* and is kno\vn to cure free radical damage, prevent bacterial infection and reduce cholesterol. These inventors have found that mixtures of pregnane glycoside together with the saponin glycosides found in caralluma and green tea extract are synergistic with regard to treating and figjiting the aging syndrome, inamtaining youthful elasticity in tissues, in slowing down or preventing cataract formation and for increase of stamina, energy and endurance and BMR.   Said mixtures are excellent anti-oxidant and anti-aging agents.<br>
Ashwagandha(Witiiania somnifera) is known as an aphrodisiac and sexual potency- enhancer.  Tliese inventors observe that pregnane glycc^des are steroidal in nature with close resemblance to sex hormones and believe that pregnarie glycosides may be the precursor or a link in the svntliesis of \ital sex hormones<br><br>
in the body.   This invention has discovered that combinations of pregnane glycosides and the Avilhanolides of Ashwagandha are syner^stic in respect of their application as s^rfirodisiacs and enhancers of sexual power and potency.   Said application as aphrodisiacs and for increasing sexual p(rtency and power relates to both sexes.   This invention, th^efore, provides for said combinations for enhancing sexual power and potency, as aphrodisiacs, for improvements in the functioning of rqwoductive organs in both sexes and for treatment of ED.   Tliese inventors observe that compositions of pregnane glycosides and Ashwagandha are anti-depressants and are provided by this invention for treatment jmd managranent of clinical depression.<br>
Shilajith, also known as Asjdialtum or Mineral pitch, is a strong afdirodisiac and sex drive enhancer.  This invention reports that mixtures of Shilajith and pregnane glycosides also exhibit synergy.   This is in respect of application of the combination as an aphrodisiac; for curii^ pnmaiy impotency and for increasing sex drive and libido.   Mixtures of Shilajith and pregnane glycosides are pro\ided by this invention for said application.<br>
Fenugreek extract is known to be effective in reducing blood sugar and is used in anti-diabetic formulas. The component therein which is active in this respect is 4-hydroxy-iso-leucine.   This invention explored mixtures of fenugreek extract and pregnane glycosides together witii tiie bitters of caralluina for application in reducing blood sugar, in partiailar FBS(Fasting blood sugar) and found that such mixtua exhibit sjnergy and are highly effective in reducing and controlling blood sugai*.   Said mixtures are very relevant for Type 2 diabetic subjects and for those desiring reduction and/or r^ulation of blood sugar. Both the components are consumed as food products and are therrfme, totally non-toxic and safe even at ver\ higl\ doses.   T'lese inventors have found that as the dosages are increased the FBS reaches a floor ]e\d of about 70-80 mg./dL ai?d does not fall below the said level.  A combination of about 250 mg. of caralluma extract containing about 125 mg. of PG together with 250 mg. of Fenugreek extract containing 40% 4-hydroxy'iso-lcucine taken over a period of about 6 months brought the FBS down from about 160 nig./dL to about 80 mg./dL. Tliis invention therefore, provides a mixture of pregnane glycosides, fenugreek extract containing 4-hydroxy-iso-leucine, Coccinia extra
 <br>
gourd extract containing about 8% biiiei^ and Cinnamon extract containing about 15% polyphenols for reduction of blood sugar.<br>
Fenugreek also contains Protodioscin ilxat is a precursor to many sex hormones including Androgen that stimulates sex urge in men. The role of pregnane glycosides in treating sexual ^sfimction and for increasing sex drive, power and stamina and enhancement of libido has been discussed hereinabove.   This invention finds that combinations of pregnane glycosides and protodioscin are ^iiergistic in treating the aspects of sexual dysfunction n^ntioned hereinabove.     Thus, this invention jMxnides for mixtures of pregnane glycosides and fenugreek extract containing about 50% protodioscin for said treatment for sexual dysfunction symptoms and/or for enhaadng sex drive, power, stamina and tibido. This invention provides for an anti-cancsr composition that neutralises certain carcinogens and comprises pregnane glycosides with Snc monomedrionine, Citrus bioflavonoids ^vith selenium as selenium chelate. Said mixture exhibits synergy.<br>
Another novel composition comprisingttie same components, namely, pregnane glycosides together with Zinc monomethionine and Qtrus biofknronoids and Selenium as selenium chelate is provided by this invention for the treatment and managesnent of the menopausal ^ndromc.  Said composition, which is also synergistic, provides rehef from he* flushes and menopausal distress.<br>
A yet another novel composition comprising pregnane glycosides along with Zinc monomethionine, Citrus bioflavonoids and Selenium as seleniusa chelate is provided by this invention for skin nourishment.    Said composition exhibits synerg&gt;' and t)roiects cell membranes and tissues and ensures capillaiy health It is helpful in maintaining youthful elasticiry in tissues by preventing the hardening thereof     It is an excellent anti-aging and anti-oxidant oamposition.   It also slo\^s/prevents formation of cataract. The selenium in the aboN'emeniioned nuxtnrss mav also be as sodiimi selenace or selenomethionine.<br>
A few other said additional coroponems incorporated in cOfi^ftoiSitonS provided by this invention are:<br><br>
Coccinia extract containing about 10% t^pcnes. Bitter gourd extraa contansimg about 8% bitters. Hibiscus Subdarifa extract containing about 25% polyphenols. Cinnamon exiiact cooEaming about 25% polyphenols, and Commiphora Mukul extract containmg about 3% gugulsterones<br>
A few plant extracts contain components that suR)lement or enhance estrogesi levels in women and are therefore suitable for treatment of menopausal s\Tidrome wherein wxxnen sa^x hot flushes, depression, night sweat, irritabiUty emotional changes and other symptoms.   Combinatkaais of diese plant extracts and pregnane glycosides were found by the present inventors to offer S|siiergy in ©eatment of menopausal problems and in lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis m post-menopausal women. Said plant extracts are: Liquorice extract containing about 5% TriplMoestrogai, Red clover extract containing about 8% isoflavones. Hop's flower cxtt^a containing about 5%ls^h\'toestrogen and Pomegranate extract containing about 10% EUagic acid-Bamboo silica is known to help in osteo-arthjitis.   Tins invention has also iaaiwestigated mixtures of pregnane glycosides with Rutin and bamboo silica and finds them syn^rgic^ mod boieficial in the treatment and management of joint degeneration and inflammation.  A mixture of said pregnane glycosides together with glucosanfiine and Rutin and furthermore containing bamboo silica is alsc^ |m)\ided by this in\'ention for the treatment atd management of joint problems and for maintaimng joisss beahh and flexibility.<br>
With regard to the various treatments referred to hereiEi. the following clarifications are made.<br>
i.	The pregnane glycosides content of the doses mentioned herein has fceen ^cified in terms of the<br>
weights of the molecularly equivalent amounts of the pregnane glycaside, caratuberside.<br>
ii.	The Glucosamine content of the various doses mentioned herein has been ^^)ecified in terms of the<br>
weight of the sulphate salt thereof<br>
iii.	All the compositions defined and claimed herein have been found bv ^e inventors to exhibit'<br>
synergy.<br>
iv.	Where plant extracts having a certaiii concentration of fte active priiaaples thereof have been<br>
specified as components of said doses, it ma&gt;- be noted fliat odier sakS conc^trations are within the scope of the invention as the same can be adapted for the dose by simple adjustment of the quantities going into the doses.   For example. "
 <br>
concentration may be used and the amoimt of the component in the dose adjusted to take into accomit tlie concentration difiference,<br>
V.	This also apphes also to non-plant components, if ai^^.<br>
vi.	Unless otherwise specified, the maintenance doses, where the dosage period is indefinite, may be<br>
taken daily on a continuing basis(continuous mode) or alternatively, on periodical(sequential) mode wherein the doses are taken for a certain length of time and then stopped for a time.   In such an on-ofif arrangement the said on-periods may be fix)m about 2 to 7 months and the off-periods may also be of a similar extent.<br>
vii.        The term 'main dose' has been used herein at some places to refer to treatment doses as opposed to the maintenance doses.  The terms 'main dose' and 'treatment dose' are. therefore, used interchangeably in this qjecificatioa<br>
viii.       Tlie doses may be taken in the form of tablets, capsules, syrups, suspensicms and 
ix.	Some doses comprise the saponin glycosides of caraUuma ^)ecies of plants.  Similart&gt;; some<br>
doses include the bitiers of caralluma.  These components have been stated to be included in 1^ pregnane glycosides.   If the pregnane glycosides in the doses are derived fi*om caialluma it K convenient to extract out said saponin glycosides and the bitto-s as wiell along with it  Howewar, said saponin glycosides and bitters may be separate components within the scope of the mventna and added to the pregnane glycosides to form the conqx)sition.<br>
X.	Where the component of a dose composition is a plant chemical, the component may be<br>
incorporated in said composition in the form of an extract of the plant or otherwise.<br>
The said uses, methods and compositions and formulations provided by this invention are described<br>
