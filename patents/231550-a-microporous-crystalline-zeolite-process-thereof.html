				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Zeolites are crystalline alurnlnosilicate composiiions which are rnlcroporous and which are formed from corner sharing /Ai02 and SiO2 tetrahedra. Numerous zeolites, both naturally occurring and synthetically prepared are used in various industrial processes. Zeolites are characterized by having pore openings of uniform dimensions, having a significant ion exchange capacity, and being capabie of reversibly desorbing an adsorbed phase which is dispersed throughout the internal voids of the crysta! without significantly displacing any atoms which make up the permanent zeolite crystal structure,<br>
One particular zeolite, designated zeolite Q, was first disclosed in US-A-2,991,151. The general formula for zeolite Q is represented in terms of mole ratio of the oxides by the following:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where M designates at least one exchangeable cation, n represents the valence of M and x has a value from 0 to 5. The examples in the patent are prepared with M being potassium. Synthesis of zeolite Q was conducted at 25°C to 50°C. After activation at 130°C, zeolite Q was found to adsorb small polar molecules.<br>
in    a    paper   by   John    D.    Sherman    entitled,    "Identification    and Characterization of Zeolites Synthesized in the KaO-AlgOs-SiCVHaO System," Molecular Sieves - 31(102) 30, 1974, he reports that the zeolite Q of the '151 patent is the same zeolite as zeolite K-I reported by other researchers. Zeolite K-I  was  first   reported   by  S.P,  Zhdanov  and   M.E.   Ovsepyon  in   Doklady Chemistry. Proc: Acad. Sci. USSR, 156, 756 (1964). M, E. Ovsepyan and S.P. Zhdanov further reported on K-I zeolite in Bull. Acad. Sci. USSR, Chem, Sci. 1, 8 (1965). P.. M. Barrer et al. in J, Chem, Soc, (A) 2475 (1968) showed that K-I decomposed at 168°C. It is also reported by Sherman and other researchers that zeolite Q is unstable above 130°C and is totally disintegrated at 200°C. Owing to this thermal instability, zeolite Q has received little industrial interest. K, J, Andries at aL in Zeolites, 11, 124 (1991) proposed the BPH topology for<br>
zeolite Q. Synthesis of a pure form of zeolite Q was reported by K.J. Andries ef a.L in Zeolites, 11, 118(1991). Finailv, US-A-5.382.420 disoloses a composition designated EC.R-33, which is a partially rare earth (La) exchanged zeolite Q. in all of the above reports, the Si/Ai ratio is 1,<br>
Applicants have now synthesized a  zeoiite  designated UZM-4,  which appears to have a similar topology to that of zeolite Q, i.e., BPH, but has considerably different characteristics. The biggest difference is that UZM-4 has been synthesized with higher Si/AI ratios than 'Zeolite Q, starting from a low of 1.5 and going higher. The most important characteristic of UZM-4 is the greater thermal stability associated with the higher Si/AI ratios. UZM-4 in its various forms is stable to at least 400°C and often up to greater than 600°C. The x-ray diffraction pattern of UZM-4 is noticeably different from that of zeolite-Q; and UZM-4 has smaller eel! dimensions than that of zeolite Q, consistent with its higher Si/AI ratio.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Applicants have prepared an aluminosiiicate zeolite and substituted versions of the same whose topological structure is related to BPH as described in Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types, W. H. Meier, D.H. Olson, and C.H. Baerlocher, editors, Elsevier, (1996), 68-69, which has been designated UZM-4. As will be shown in detail, UZM-4 is different from zeolite Q in a number of its characteristics. The instant microporous crystalline zeolite (UZM-4) has an empirical composition in the as-synthesized form and on an anhydrous basis expressed by the empirical formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where M is at least one exchangeable cation and is selected from the group consisting of alkali and alkaline earth metals. Specific examples of the M cations include but are not limited to lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, calcium, strontium, barium and mixtures thereof, R is an organic cation and is selected from the group consisting of protonated amines, protonated diamines, quaternary ammonium ions, diquaternary ammonium ions, protonated alkanolarnines and quaternized alkanolammonium ions. The value of "n" which<br>
is the weighted average valence of M varies from 1 to 2, The value of "p" which is the weighted averaqe valence of R varies from 1 'to 2. The ration of silicon to 4- E) is represented by !iy" which varies from 1,5 to 4,0, E is an element which is ieirahedrally coordinated, is present in the framework and is selected from the group consisting of gallium, iron, chromium, indium and boron, The mole fraction of £ is represented by "x" and has a value from 0 to 0,5, while "z" is the mole-ratio of O to (A! + E) and is given by the equation<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Where M is only one metal, then the weighted average valence is the valence of that one metal, i.e. +1 or +2, However, when more than one M metal is present, the total amount of<br>
and the weighted average valence "n" is given by the equation:<br>
(Equation  Removed)<br>
Similarly when only one R organic cation is present, the weighted average valence is the valence of the single R cation, i.e., +1 or +2. When more than one R cation is present, the total amount of R is given by the equation.<br>
and the weighted average valence "p" is given by the equation<br>
(Equation  Removed)<br>
The microporous crystalline zeolite, UZM-4, is prepared by a hydrothermal crystallization of a reaction mixture prepared by combining reactive sources of M, R, aluminum, silicon and optionally E. The sources of aluminum include but are not limited to aluminum alkoxides, precipitated aluminas, aluminum metal, aluminum salts and alumina sols. Specific examples of<br>
aluminum aikoxides include, but are not limited to aluminum orltio sec-butoxide and aluminum orfho isopropoxide- Sources of silica indurta hut are  not limited to tetraethyiorthosilieate, colloidal  silica,  precipitated  silica  and  alkali  silicates, Sources of the E elements include but are not limited to a!kaii borates, boric acid, precipitated gallium oxyhydroxide,  gallium suifate, ferric suifats,  ferric chloride, chromium nitrate and indium chloride, Sources of the M metals include the halide salts, nitrate salts, acetate salts, and hydroxides of the respective alkali or alkaline earth metals, When R is a quaternary ammonium cation or a quaternized   alkanolammonium  cation,   the   sources   include   the   hydroxide, chloride, bromide, iodide and fluoride compounds. Specific examples include without    limitation    tetramethylammonium    hydroxide,    tetraethylammonium hydroxide,    hexamethonium   bromide,    diethyldimethylammonium   hydroxide, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, tetramethylammonium chloride and choline chloride. R may also be introduced as an amine, diamine, or alkanolamine. Specific examples are N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl -1,6-hexanediamine, triethylamine, and triethanolamine.<br>
The reaction mixture containing reactive sources of the desired components can be described in terms of molar ratios of the oxides by the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where "a" varies from 0.05 to 1.5, "b" varies from 1.0 to 15, "c" varies from 0 to 0.5, "d" varies from 2.5 to 15, and "e" varies from 25 to 2500. If aikoxides are used, it is preferred to include a distillation or evaporative step to remove the alcohol hydrolysis products. The reaction mixture is now reacted at a temperature of 85°C to 225°C and preferably from 125°C to 150°C for a period of 1 day Jo 2 weeks and preferably for a time of 2 days to 4 days in a sealed reaction vessel under autogenous pressure. After crystallization is complete, the solid product is isolated from the heterogeneous mixture by means such as filtration or centrifugation, and then washed with deionized water and dried in air at ambient temperature up to 100°C<br>
The UZM-4 aiurninosllicate zeolite, which is obtained from the above-<br>
described process  is characterized by the very diffrention   nation the<br>
spacings and relative intensities set forth in Table A below,<br>
Table A<br><br>
(Table  Removed)<br>
As will be shown in detail in the examples, the UZM-4 material is thermally stable up to a temperature of at least 400°C and preferably up to 600°C. The UZM-4 material has also been found to have a smaller unit cell size than zeolite Q, indicative of a higher Si/AI ratio. That is, a representative UZM-4 has a unit cell of a=13.269 Å, c= 13.209 Å, versus a unit cell for zeolite Q of a=13.501 Å and c=13.403Å..<br>
As synthesized, the UZM-4 material will contain some of the exchangeable or charge balancing cations in its pores. These exchangeable cations can be exchanged for other cations, or in the case of organic cations, they can be removed by heating under controlled conditions. Because UZM-4 is a large pore zeolite, it is also possible to remove some organic cations directly by ion exchange.<br>
The crystalline UZM-4 zeolite of this invention can be used for separating mixtures of molecular species, removing contaminants through ion exchange and catalyzing various hydrocarbon conversion processes. Separation of<br>
molecular species can be based either on the molecular size (kinetic diameter)or on the degree of nolarity of the molecular speciesThe UZM-4 zeolite of this invention can also be used as a catalyst or<br>
catalyst support in various hydrocarbon conversion processes, Hydrocarbon<br>
conversion   processes   are   weii   known   in   the   art   and   include   cracking,<br>
hydrocracking,   alkylation  of both   aromatics  and   isoparaffin,   isomerization,<br>
polymerization,   reforming,   hydrogenation,   dehydrogenation,   transalkylation,<br>
dealkylation,    hydration,    dehydration,    hydrotreating,    hydrodenitrogenation,<br>
hydrodesuifurization, methanation and syngas shift process. Specific reaction<br>
conditions and the types of feeds which can be used in these processes are set<br>
forth in US-A-4,310,440 and US-A-4,440,871. Preferred hydrocarbon conversion<br>
processes are those in which hydrogen is a component such as hydrotreating or<br>
hydrofining,         hydrogenation,         hydrocracking,         hydrodenitrogenation,<br>
hydrodesuifurization, etc.	<br>
Hydrocracking conditions typically include a temperature in the range of<br>
204-649°C (400° to 1200°F), preferably between 316-510°C (600° and 950°F).<br>
Reaction pressures are in the range of atmospheric to 24,132 kPa g (3,500<br>
psig), preferably between 1379 - 20,685 kPa g (200 and 3000 psig), Contact<br>
times usually correspond to liquid hourly space velocities (LHSV) in the range of<br>
0.1 hr"1 to 15 hr"1, preferably between 0.2 and 3 hr"1. Hydrogen circulation rates<br>
are in the range of 178-8,888 std. m3/m3 (1,000 to 50,000 standard cubic feet<br>
(scf) per barrel of charge), preferably between 355-5,333 std. m3/m3 (2,000 and<br>
30,000 scf per barrel of charge). Suitable hydrotreating conditions are generally<br>
within the broad ranges of hydrocracking conditions set out above.<br>
The reaction zone effluent is normally removed from the catalyst bed, subjected to partial condensation and vapor-liquid separation and then fractionated to recover the various components thereof. The hydrogen, and if desired some or all of the unconverted heavier materials, are recycled to the reactor. Alternatively, a two-stage flow may be employed with the unconverted material being passed into a second reactor. Catalysts of the subject invention may be used in just one stage of such a process or may be used in both reactor stages.<br>
Catalytic cracking processes are preferably carried out with the UZIV1~4comoosition using feesdstock such as are  <br>
crude' oil residua, etc, with gasoline being the principal desired product, Temperature conditions of 454° B93°C (850° to 1100°F), LHSV values of 0,5 to 10 hr"' and pressure conditions of from 1 to 34 kPa gauge (0 to 50 psig) are suitable,<br>
Alkylation of aromatics usually involves reacting an aromatic (C2 to C-|2), especially benzene, with a monoolefin to produce a linear alkyl substituted aromatic. The process is carried out at an aromatic: olefin (e.g., benzene:olefin) ratio of between 5:1 and 30:1, a LHSV of 0.3 to 6 hr"1, a temperature of 100° to 250°C and pressures of 1379 to 6895 kPa gauge (200 to 1000 psig). Further details on apparatus may be found in US-A-4,870,222.<br>
Alkylation of isoparaffins with olefins to produce alkylates suitable as motor fuel components is carried out at temperatures of -30° to 40°C, pressures from atmospheric to 6,894 kPa gauge (1,000 psig) and a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.1 to 120 hr"1. Details on paraffin alkylation may be found in US-A-5,157,196 and US-A-5,157,197.<br>
The isomerization of an alkylaromatic feed mixture, preferably a non-equilibrium  mixture of C8 aromatics,  involves contacting the feed with the isomerization catalyst at suitable alkylaromatic-isomerization conditions. The isomerization catalyst will comprise the instant zeolite along with a platinum group   metal   and   optionally   other  components.      Isomerization  conditions comprise a temperature ranging from 0° to 600°C or more, and preferably in the range from 100° to 500°C.   The pressure generally is from 101 to 10,132 kPa absolute (1 to 100 atmospheres absolute), preferably less than 5066 kPa (50 atmospheres).      Sufficient catalyst is contained in the isomerization zone to provide a liquid hourly space velocity with respect to the hydrocarbon feed mixture of from 0.1 to 30 hr"1 and preferably 0.5 to 10 hr"1.   The hydrocarbon feed    mixture    optimally    is    reacted    in    admixture   with    hydrogen    at   a hydrogen/hydrocarbon mole ratio of 0.5:1 to 25:1 or more.   Other inert diluents such as nitrogen, argon and light hydrocarbons may be present.<br>
"I he following examples are presented in illustration of this invention and<br>
are not intended as undue limitations on the genrelly broed  of the  <br>
invention as set out in the appended claims,<br>
The structure of the UZM-4 zeolite of this invention was determined by x-ray analysis, Tne x-ray patterns presented in me following examples were obtained using standard x-ray powder diffraction techniques. The radiation source was a high-intensity, x-ray tube operated at 45 kV and 35 ma, The diffraction pattern from the copper K-alpha radiation was obtained by appropriate computer based techniques, Fiat compressed powder samples were continuously scanned at 2° to 70° (29). Interplanar spacings (d) in Angstrom units were obtained from the position of the diffraction peaks expressed as 0<br>
where 0 is the Bragg angle as observed from digitized data. Intensities were determined from the integrated area of diffraction peaks after subtracting background, "I0" being the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and "I" being the intensity of each of the other peaks.<br>
As will be understood by those skilled in the art the determination of the parameter 20  is  subject to  both   human   and  mechanical  error,   which   in combination can impose an uncertainty of ±0.4° on each reported value of 20. This uncertainty is, of course, also manifested in the reported values of the d-spacings, which are calculated from the 20 values. This imprecision is general throughout the art and is not sufficient to preclude the differentiation of the present crystalline materials from each other and from the compositions of the prior art. In some of the x-ray patterns reported, the relative intensities of the d-spacings are indicated by the notations vs, s, m, and w which represent very strong, strong, medium, and weak, respectively. In terms of 100 x I/I0, the above designations are defined as<br>
w = 0-15; m = 15-60: s = 60-80 and vs = 80-100In certain instances the purity of a synthesized product may be assessed with reference to its x-ray powder diffraction pattern. Thus, for example, if a sample is stated to be pure, it is intended only that the x-ray pattern of the<br>
sarnpie is free of lines attributable to crystalline impurities, not that there  are no amorohous materials oresent.<br>

The  reaction  mixture  was homogenized for another hour before it was divided among 6 autoclaves, and the  mixtures  were  digested  under  a variety  of conditions   at autogenous pressures. The products were isolated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water, and dried at room temperature.<br>
The reactions in which the mixtures were digested at 150°C and 175°C for both 2 and 7 days all yielded products with the BPH topology as determined by x-ray powder diffraction, The product isolated from the 2 day - 150°C digestion had Si/AI = 1.92, Li/AI = 0.43, N/AI = 0.46, and (N -f Li)/AI = 0.89. This sample was studied via variable temperature powder x-ray diffraction. The study was conducted with a flow of dry air over the sample. The BPH topology was observed to be stable to 600°C, the maximum temperature at which the study was conducted. A shift in some intensities of some of the lines was observed above the temperature where the  organoammonium  species decomposed. Table 4 gives the lines observed for the UZM-4 sample at room temperature and at 600°C. The  results clearly establish the  thermal stability of the UZM-4 composition.<br><br>

US-A-2,991,151 discloses that zeolite Q is synthesized using potassium as the charge balancing ion, As a comparison, the process used in the previous examples was carried out using potassium as the charge-balancing ion.   An aluminosilicate reaction  mixture was prepared  by combining  1   TEOS: 0.5 AI(Osec-Bu)3: 1.6 TEAOH: 41.5 H2O, employing vigorous stirring. The resulting mixture was placed in a teflon bottle and aged for 3 days in a 100°C oven. The reaction mixture, which contained 2.93% Si, was then allowed to cool to room temperature, A portion of this reaction mixture, 130.0 g, was placed in a teflon beaker and agitated with a high speed stirrer. A potassium chloride solution, prepared   by  dissolving   10,15  g  KCI   in  30.0   g  H2O,   was  added to the aiuminosilicate   reaction  mixture slowly with vigorous  stirring.

Example 15<br>
The UZM-4 material prepared in example 5 was tested for ion exchange using the following procedure. About 10-12 g of the zeolite was treated with a chloride or nitrate solution of the exchanging cation. The pH of the cation exchange solution was adjusted to the range of 7 — 8 by using KOH or LiOH. The resulting slurry was heated to 75°C with stirring for 1-2 hr before the product<br>
was isolated by filtration and washed, This procedure was carried out 5-6 times, Data is presentee! for die compositions of the parent zeolite, the exchanged .zeolite the ealoined exchangeds zeolite and of the  structure at the exchanged material after calcination, Table 15 shows the compositions as determined by elemental  analyses,  where  cation  deficiencies with  respect  to the charge balance on the .zeolite are assumed to be accounted for by H+, which is included in the formulations below even though it was not directly determined by the analyses. It should be pointed out in the examples below the ease with which the   organic  cations  are   exchanged  from  these   UZM-4   materials.   This   is consistent with the large 12-ring pore system known for the BPH topology.<br>

UZiVi-4 was analyzed by 20Si and 27AI NMR and is compared to the NiVIR spectrum of zeolite Q in the literature.   Zeolite Q has been studied by Andries, Bosnians, and Grobert, 'n Zsollies, vol  11, 0,116-131 (1991). The zeolite Q sample with Si/AJ = 1 showed in the 29SI nmr spectrum, three lines with chemical shifts that were consistent with 4 A! in the Si environment The narrow linewidths observed for these lines indicated that there was Si and A! ordering in the framework, In contrast, 29Si nrnr spectra of a typical higher Si/A! BPH topology UZM-4 sample showed five broad lines (each line is actually multiple lines), corresponding to Si in a variety of environments, differing by the number of aluminums (0 - 4) in the immediate coordination sphere of Si. This broader distribution of coordination environments  is expected for materials with an excess of Si over Al, see G.Engelhardt, D, Michel, High Resolution Solid State NMR of Silicates and Zeolites, 1987, John Wiley and Sons, p. 134 - 157. 27AI nmr showed that all the Al is tetrahedral in the UZM-4 material. This is also the case for zeolite Q reported by Andries. The 29Si and 27AI chemical shifts are given for zeolite Q and the higher silica UZM-4 samples in Table 15 below, along with possible interpretations, see G.Engelhardt, D. Michel, High Resolution Solid State NMR of Silicates and Zeolites, 1987, John Wiley and Sons, p. 134 - 157. The differences between the UZM-4 and zeolite Q are quite apparent.<br>
