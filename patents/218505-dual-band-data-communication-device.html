				<td>DUAL DAND DATA COMMUNICATION DEVICE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention" relates to a dual-band data communication device which can transmit and receive either one of two frequency bands while switching the two, and particularly relates to a dual-band data communication device which can be used with any high/low relationship between a transmission/reception frequency and a local oscillation frequency.<br>
Basically, a data communication device performs transmission and reception by using only one frequency band. With only one frequency band, however, a data communication device might fail in communication when another device uses the same frequency band or when the frequency band cannot be used because of noise or the like. Therefore, dual-band data communication devices which can use two frequency bands selectively by switching these two bands have been used.<br>
Fig. 10 is a block diagram of a conventional dual-band data communication device. In Fig. 10, the dual-band data communication device is constituted by: an antenna 101 for transmitting/receiving a transmission/reception wave efficiently; a duplexer 102 for separating the transmission/reception wave into a transmission wave and a reception wave; a receiver 103 for converting the reception wave into two orthogonal base-band reception signals RX-I and<br><br>
RX-Q, the former one of which is an in-phase component and the latter one of which is a quadrature component; a transmitter<br>
104	for converting two orthogonal base-band transmission<br>
signals TX-I and TX-Q, the former one of which is an in-phase<br>
component and the latter one of which is a quadrature<br>
component, into a transmission wave; a first local oscillator<br>
105	for a first band used for frequency-conversion in the<br>
transmitter and the receiver; -a first local oscillator 106 for<br>
a second band used for the same purpose as the first local<br>
oscillator 105; a reception second local oscillator 107 used<br>
for orthogonal detection in the receiver; a transmission second<br>
local oscillator 108 used for orthogonal modulation in the<br>
transmitter; A/D converters 109 for converting the orthogonal<br>
base-band reception signals RX-I and RX-Q into digital<br>
orthogonal base-band reception signals respectively; a digital<br>
demodulation processing means 201 for demodulating the digital<br>
orthogonal base-band reception signals into reception data; D/A<br>
converters 111 for converting digital orthogonal base-band<br>
transmission signals into orthogonal base-band transmission<br>
signals TX-I and TX-Q respectively; a digital modulation<br>
processing means 601 for modulating transmission data into<br>
digital orthogonal base-band transmission signals; and a band<br>
selection control means 113 for controlling the mode as to<br>
which one of the first and second bands is used. The band<br>
selection control means 113 performs control for selection<br>
between the first local oscillator 105 for the first band and<br><br>
the first local oscillator 106 for the second band by using a band selection control signal 114 to thereby make it possible to perform control of selection as to which one of the first and second bands is to be used."<br>
However, in such a conventional dual-band data communication device, it is necessary to fix the direction of phase rotation of the orthogonal base-band reception signals supplied into the digital demodulation processing means. This is because, if the direction of phase rotation changes so that the high/low relationship of frequency is inverted in frequency conversion, the data are inverted.<br>
Let in-phase and quadrature components of digital orthogonal base-band signals be i(t) and q(t), respectively. The reception signals orthogonally modulated by cos(wt) and sin(wt) are frequency-converted with a local oscillation signal cos(u0t) as follows.<br>
2cos(G)0t) »{i(t) •cos(&amp;)t) - q(t) •sin(ut) }<br>
=  i(t) •{cos(u0+u)t  + cos(o)0-(i))t} -  q(t) •{sin(u0+w)t  -  sin(w0-w)t}<br>
=   {i(t) •cos(u0+w)t  -  q(t) •sin((i)0+o))t} +  {i(t) •cos((i)0-u)t  + q(t) •sin(o)0-(l))t}<br>
In the case of frequency conversion, the phase is not changed if the local oscillation frequency is made lower than the reception frequency, but the phase of the quadrature component is inverted if the local oscillation frequency is made higher than the reception frequency.   If the local<br><br>
oscillation frequency is set to have a high/low relationship which is difference between the first and second bands, the phase of the quadrature component is inverted between the two bands, and the direction of rotation of the phase is reversed. Accordingly, in differential phase modulation, logic 1 and logic 0 are replaced by each other.<br>
Therefore, there arose such a constraint condition that it was necessary to set the high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the local oscillation frequency in common between the first and second bands. Accordingly, there was a problem that the degree of freedom in designing the first-band local oscillator and the second-band local oscillator was reduced.<br>
In the same manner, the phase is not changed if the local oscillation frequency is made lower than the reception frequency and signals the frequency of which is increased by addition are made transmission signals. However, the phase of the quadrature component is inverted if the local oscillation frequency is made higher than the reception frequency and signals the frequency of which is decreased by substraction are made transmission signals. If the local oscillation frequency is set to have a high/low relationship which is different between the first and second bands, the phase of the quadrature component is inverted between the two bands, and the direction of rotation of the phase is reversed.   Accordingly,  in<br><br>
differential phase modulation, logic 1 and logic 0 are replaced by each other.<br>
Therefore, since the direction of rotation of the phase of the digital orthogonal base-band transmission signals outputted from the digital modulation processing means was fixed, there arose such a constraint condition that it was necessary to set the high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the local oscillation frequency in common between the first and second bands. Accordingly, there was a problem that the degree of freedom in designing the first-band local oscillator and the second-band local oscillator was reduced.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to Figs. 1 to 9. (First Embodiment)<br>
A first embodiment according to the present invention is a dual-band data communication device having a logical means for performing EXCLUSIVE-ORing between a band selection control signal and reception data.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a dual-band data communication device in this embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 1, the dual-band data communication device is constituted by: an antenna 101 for transmitting/receiving a transmission/reception wave efficiently; a duplexer 102 for separating the transmission/reception wave into a transmission wave and a reception wave; a receiver 103 for converting the reception wave into two orthogonal base-band reception signals RX-I and RX-Q, the former one of which is an in-phase component and the latter one of which is a quadrature component respectively; a transmitter 104 for converting two orthogonal base-band reception signals TX-I and TX-Q, the former one of<br><br>
which is an in-phase component and the latter one of which is a quadrature component, into a transmission wave; a first local oscillator 105 for a first band used for frequency-conversion in the transmitter and the receiver; a first local oscillator 106 for a second band used for the same purpose as the first local oscillator 105; a reception second local oscillator 107 used for orthogonal detection in the receiver; a transmission second local oscillator 108 used for orthogonal modulation in the transmitter; A/D converters 109 for converting the orthogonal base-band reception signals RX-I and RX-Q into digital orthogonal base-band reception signals respectively; a dual-band digital demodulation processing means 110 for demodulating the digital orthogonal base-band reception signals into reception data; D/A converters 111 for converting digital orthogonal base-band transmission signals into orthogonal base¬band transmission signals TX-I and TX-Q respectively, a dual-band digital modulation processing means 112 for modulating transmission data into digital orthogonal base-band transmission signals; and a band selection control means 113 for controlling the mode as to which one of the first and second bands is used.<br>
The band selection control means 113 performs control for section between the first local oscillator 105 for the first band and the first local oscillator 106 for the second band by using a band selection control signal 114, and, at the same  time,  controls  the  dual-band  digital  demodulation<br><br>
processing means 110 and the dual-band digital modulation processing means 112.<br>
Fig. 2 is a detailed block diagram illustrating the dual-band digital demodulation processing means 110 in the thus configured dual-band data communication device. In Fig. 2, the dual-band digital demodulation processing means 110 is constituted by a digital demodulation processing means 201 and an EXCLUSIVE-OR circuit 202. -<br>
Assume now that the digital demodulation processing means 201 is set to perform demodulation properly when the first band is used, and that in the high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency, there is a difference between the first and second bands. In this case, the direction of rotation of the phase of the digital orthogonal base-band reception signals is reversed when the second band is used. In differential phase modulation, for example, logic 0 is set when the direction of rotation of the phase is positive, while logic 1 is set when the direction of rotation of the phase is negative. Accordingly, when the direction of rotation of the phase is reversed, the output of the digital demodulation processing means 201 is inverted so that the logic 1 and the logic 0 are replaced by each other. Therefore, the band selection control signal 114 from the band selection control means 113 is set to take the logic 0 when the first band is used and to take the logic 1 when the second band is used. Then, EXCLUSIVE-ORing is<br><br>
carried out between the output of the digital demodulation processing means 201 and the band selection control signal 114 by means of the EXCLUSIVE-OR circuit 202. Consequently, the logic 1 and the logic 0 are replaced by each other again when the second band is used. As a result, it is possible to output reception data properly.<br>
In the case where the digital demodulation processing means 201 performs demodulation properly when the second band is used, it will go well if the band selection control signal 114 is set to take the logic 1 when the first band is used, and to take the logic 0 when the second band is used. In the case where there is no difference between the first band and the second band in the high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency, it will go well if the EXCLUSIVE-OR circuit 202 is bypassed, or made to be an inversion circuit. It is therefore possible to deal with any high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency.<br>
As has been described above, according to this embodiment, the digital demodulation processing means 201 and the EXCLUSIVE-OR circuit 202 are provided in the dual-band digital demodulation processing means 110. Accordingly, it is possible to output reception data properly even if there is a difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency.   As a result, the degree of<br><br>
freedom in designing the first local oscillation frequency is<br>
increased.<br>
(Second Embodiment)<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention is a dual-band data communication device having means for replacing two digital orthogonal base-band reception signals, one of which is an in-phase component and the other of which is a quadrature component, by each other in accordance with a band selection control signal when a second band is used.<br>
Fig. 3 is a detailed block diagram illustrating a dual-band digital demodulation processing means 110 in the dual-band data communication device shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 3, the dual-band digital demodulation processing means 110 is constituted by two selectors 301 and a digital demodulation processing means 201.<br>
Assume now that the digital demodulation processing means 201 is set to perform demodulation properly when the first band is used, and that in the high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency, there is a difference between the first and second bands. In this case, the direction of rotation of the phase of the digital orthogonal base-band reception signals is reversed when the second band is used. Therefore, the two selectors 301 are controlled by the band selection control signal 114 supplied from the band selection control means 113 so as to<br><br>
return the direction of rotation of the phase to its original direction.<br>
When the second band is used, a digital orthogonal base-band reception signal obtained by converting the orthogonal base-band reception signal RX-I which is an in-phase component by means of the A/D converter 109, and a digital orthogonal base-band reception signal obtained by converting the orthogonal base-band reception signal RX-Q which is a quadrature component by means of the other A/D converter 109 are replaced by each other. When the two digital orthogonal base-band reception signals one of which is an in-phase component and the other of which is a quadrature component are replaced by each other, the direction of rotation of the phase is reversed. Accordingly, the direction of rotation of the phase is reversed again so as to return to its original direction. It is therefore possible to output reception data properly.<br>
In the case where the digital demodulation processing means 201 performs demodulation properly when the second band is used, it will go well if the two selectors 301 are controlled by the band selection control signal 114 so that the two digital orthogonal base-band reception signals, one of which is an in-phase component and the other of which is a quadrature component, are replaced by each other when the first band is used. In the case where there is no difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship between<br><br>
the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency, it will go well if the two selectors 301 are fixed in one state. It is therefore possible to deal with any high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency.<br>
As has been described above, according to this embodiment, the two selectors 301 and the digital demodulation processing means 201 are provided in the dual-band digital demodulation processing means 110. Accordingly, it is possible to output reception data properly even if there is a difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency. As a result, the degree of freedom in designing the first local oscillation frequency is increased. (Third Embodiment)<br>
A third embodiment of the present invention is a dual-band data communication device having means for replacing two digital orthogonal base-band reception signals, which are an in-phase component and its inverted signal, by each other in accordance with a band selection control signal when a second band is used.<br>
Fig. 4 is a detailed block diagram illustrating a dual-band digital demodulation processing means 110 in the dual-band data communication device shown in Fig. 1, wherein orthogonal base-band reception signals are balanced to improve the antinoise properties.  In Fig. 4, an inverted signal of an<br><br>
orthogonal base-band reception signal RX-I which is an in-phase component is referenced by RX-nl, and an inverted signal of an orthogonal base-band reception signal RX-Q which is a quadrature component is referenced by RX-nQ. The dual-band digital demodulation processing means 110 is constituted by two selectors 301, two subtracters 401 and a digital demodulation processing means 201.<br>
Assume now that the digital demodulation processing means 201 is set to perform demodulation properly when the first band is used, and that in the high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency, there is a difference between the first and second bands. In this case, the direction of rotation of the phase of the digital orthogonal base-band reception signals is reversed when the second band is used. Therefore, the two selectors 301 are controlled by the band selection control signal 114 given from the band selection control means 113 so as to return the direction of rotation of the phase to its original direction.<br>
When the second band is used, a digital orthogonal base-band reception signal obtained by converting the orthogonal base-band reception signal RX-I which is an in-phase component by means of the A/D converter 109, and a digital orthogonal base-band reception signal obtained by converting the inverted signal RX-nl of the orthogonal base-band reception signal RX-I which is an in-phase component by means of the A/D converter 109 are replaced by each other.  As a result, the<br><br>
orthogonal base-band reception signal RX-I is inverted equivalently. Since both the components are inverted equivalently, the direction of rotation of the phase is reversed to return to its original direction. Accordingly, it is possible to output reception data properly.<br>
In the case where the digital demodulation processing means 201 performs demodulation properly when the second band is used, it will go well if the two selectors 301 are controlled by the band selection control signal 114 so that the two digital orthogonal base-band reception signals which are an in-phase component and its inverted signal are replaced with each other. In the case where there is no difference between the first band and the second band in the high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency, it will go well if the two selectors 301 are fixed to the state of one of them. It is therefore possible to deal with any high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency.<br>
As has been described above, according to this embodiment, the two selectors 301, the two subtracters 401 and the digital demodulation processing means 201 are provided in the dual-band digital demodulation processing means 110 in which orthogonal base-band reception signals are balanced to improve the antinoise properties. Accordingly, it is possible to output reception data properly even if there is a difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship<br><br>
between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency. As a result, the degree of freedom in designing the first local oscillation frequency is increased. (Fourth Embodiment)<br>
A fourth embodiment of the present invention is a dual-band data communication device having means for replacing two digital orthogonal base-band reception signals, which are a quadrature component and its inverted signal, by each other in accordance with a band selection control signal when a second band is used.<br>
Fig. 5 is a detailed block diagram illustrating a dual-band digital demodulation processing means 110 in the dual-band data communication device shown in Fig. 1, wherein orthogonal base-band reception signals are balanced to improve the antinoise properties. In Fig. 5, an inverted signal of an orthogonal base-band reception signal RX-I which is an in-phase component is referenced by RX-nl, and an inverted signal of an orthogonal base-band reception signal RX-Q which is a quadrature component is referenced by RX-nQ. The dual-band digital demodulation processing means 110 is constituted by two selectors 301, two subtracters 401 and a digital demodulation processing means 201.<br>
Assume now that the digital demodulation processing means 201 is set to perform demodulation properly when the first band is used, and that in the high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation<br><br>
frequency, there is a difference between the first and second bands. In this case, the direction of rotation of the phase of the digital orthogonal base-band reception signals is reversed when the second band is used. Therefore, the two selectors 301 are controlled by the band selection control signal 114 given from the band selection control means 113 so as to return the direction of rotation of the phase to its original direction.<br>
When the second band - is used, a digital orthogonal base-band reception signal obtained by converting the orthogonal base-band reception signal RX-Q which is a quadrature component by means of the A/D converter 109, and a digital orthogonal base-band reception signal obtained by converting the inverted signal RX-nQ of the orthogonal base¬band reception signal RX-Q which is a quadrature component by means of the A/D converter 109 are replaced by each other. As a result, the inverted phase of the quadrature component is returned to its original phase. The direction of rotation of the phase is reversed to return to its original direction. Accordingly, it is possible to output reception data properly.<br>
In the case where the digital demodulation processing means 201 performs demodulation properly when the second band is used, it will go well if the two selectors 301 are controlled by the band selection control signal 114 so that the two digital orthogonal base-band reception signals which are a quadrature component and its inverted signal are replaced with each other.  In the case where there is no difference between<br><br>
the first band and the second band in the high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency, it will go well if the two selectors 301 are fixed to the state of one of them. It is therefore possible to deal with any high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency.<br>
As has been described above, according to this embodiment, the two selectors 301, the two subtracters 401 and the digital demodulation processing means 201 are provided in the dual-band digital demodulation processing means 110 in which orthogonal base-band reception signals are balanced to improve the antinoise properties. Accordingly, it is possible to output reception data properly even if there is a difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the first local oscillation frequency. As a result, the degree of freedom in designing the first local oscillation frequency is increased. (Fifth Embodiment)<br>
A fifth embodiment of the present invention is a dual-band data communication device having a logical means for performing EXCLUSIVE-ORing between a band selection control signal and transmission data.<br>
Fig. 6 is a detailed block diagram of a dual-band digital modulation processing means 112 in the dual-band data communication device shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 6, the dual-band digital modulation processing means 112 is constituted by an<br><br>
EXCLUSIVE-OR circuit 202 and a digital modulation processing means 601.<br>
Assume now that the digital modulation processing means 601 is set to perforin modulation properly when the first band is used, and that in the high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the first local oscillation frequency, there is a difference between the first and second bands. In this case, the direction of rotation of the phase of a transmission wave outputted from the transmitter is reversed when the second band is used. The band selection control signal 114 given from the band selection control means 113 is set to take logic 0 when the first band is used and to take logic 1 when the second band is used. Then, EXCLUSIVE-ORing is performed, by means of the EXCLUSIVE-OR circuit 2 02, between the transmission data and the band selection control signal 114 given from the band selection control means 113.<br>
When the second band is used, digital modulation is performed upon the transmission data after the logic 1 and the logic 0 are replaced by each other in advance. In such a manner, the direction of rotation of the phase of signals in which the direction of rotation of the phase of digital orthogonal base-band transmission signals and orthogonal base¬band transmission signals has been reversed is reversed again in the transmitter. Accordingly, it is possible to output a transmission wave properly.<br><br>
In the case where the digital modulation processing means 601 performs modulation properly when the second band is used, it will go well if the band selection control signal 114 is set in advance to take the logic 1 when the first band is used, and to take the logic 0 when the second band is used. In the case where there is no difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and -the first local oscillation frequency, it will go well if the EXCLUSIVE-OR circuit 202 is bypassed, or made to be an inversion circuit. It is therefore possible to deal with any high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the first local oscillation frequency.<br>
As has been described above, according to this embodiment, the EXCLUSIVE-OR circuit 202 and the digital modulation processing means 601 are provided in the dual-band digital modulation processing means 112. Accordingly, it is possible to output a transmission wave properly even if there is a difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the first local oscillation frequency. Accordingly, the degree of freedom in designing the first local oscillation frequency is increased. (Sixth Embodiment)<br>
A sixth embodiment of the present invention is a dual-band data communication device having means for replacing two<br><br>
digital orthogonal base-band transmission signals, one of which is an in-phase component and the other of which is a quadrature component, by each other in accordance with a band selection control signal when a second band is used.<br>
Fig. 7 is a detailed block diagram illustrating a dual-band digital modulation processing means 112 in the dual-band data communication device shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 7, the dual-band digital modulation processing means 112 is constituted by a digital modulation processing means 601 and two selectors 301.<br>
Assume now that the digital modulation processing means 601 is set to perform modulation properly when the first band is used, and that in the high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the first local oscillation frequency, there is a difference between the first and second bands. In this case, the direction of rotation of the phase of a transmission wave outputted from the transmitter is reversed when the second band is used. Therefore, the two selectors 301 are controlled by the band selection control signal 114 given from the band selection control means 113 so as to prevent the direction of rotation of the phase of the transmission wave from being reversed.<br>
When the second band is used, a digital orthogonal base-band transmission signal to be converted by the D/A converter 111 into an orthogonal base-band transmission signal TX-I which is an in-phase component, and a digital orthogonal<br><br>
base-band transmission signal to be converted by the other D/A converter 111 into an orthogonal base-band transmission signal TX-Q which is a quadrature component are replaced by each other. As a result, the direction of rotation of the phase of the orthogonal base-band transmission signals is reversed. Since the direction of rotation of the phase is reversed again in the transmitter, it is possible to output a transmission wave properly.<br>
In the case where the digital modulation processing means 601 performs modulation properly when the second band is used, it will go well if the two selectors 301 are controlled by the band selection control signal 114 so that the two digital orthogonal base-band transmission signals, one of which is an in-phase component and the other of which is a quadrature component, are replaced by each other when the first band is used. When there is no difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the first local oscillation frequency, it will go well if the two selectors 301 are fixed to the state of one of them. It is therefore possible to deal with any high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the first local oscillation frequency.<br>
As has been described above, according to this embodiment, the digital modulation processing means 601 and the two selectors 301 are provided in the dual-band digital modulation processing means 112.  Accordingly, it is possible<br><br>
to output a transmission wave properly even if there is a<br>
difference between the first and second bands in the high/low<br>
relationship between the transmission frequency and the first<br>
local oscillation frequency.   As a result, the degree of<br>
freedom in designing the first local oscillation frequency is<br>
increased.<br>
(Seventh Embodiment)<br>
A seventh embodiment -of the present invention is a dual-band data communication device having means for replacing two digital orthogonal base-band transmission signals, which are an in-phase component and its inverted signal, by each other in accordance with a band selection control signal when a second band is used.<br>
Fig. 8 is a detailed block diagram illustrating a dual-band digital modulation processing means 112 in the dual-band data communication device shown in Fig. 1, wherein orthogonal base-band transmission signals are balanced to improve the antinoise properties. In Fig. 8, an inverted signal of an orthogonal base-band transmission signal TX-I which is an in-phase component is referenced by TX-nl, and an inverted signal of an orthogonal base-band transmission signal TX-Q which is a quadrature component is referenced by TX-nQ. The dual-band digital modulation processing means 112 is constituted by a digital modulation processing means 601, two inverters 801 and two selectors 301.<br><br>
Assume now that the digital modulation processing means 601 is set to perform modulation properly when the first band is used, and that in the high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the first local oscillation frequency, there is a difference between the first and second bands. In this case, the direction of rotation of the phase of a transmission wave outputted from the transmitter is reversed when the second band is used. Therefore, the two selectors 301 are controlled by the band selection control signal 114 given from the band selection control means 113 so as to prevent the direction of rotation of the phase of the transmission wave from being reversed.<br>
When a second band is used, a digital orthogonal base¬band transmission signal to be converted by the D/A converter 111 into the orthogonal base-band transmission signal TX-I which is an in-phase component, and a digital orthogonal base¬band transmission signal to be converted by the D/A converter 111 into the inverted signal TX-nl of the orthogonal base-band transmission signal TX-I which is an in-phase component are replaced by each other. As a result, the direction of rotation of the phase of the orthogonal base-band transmission signals is reversed. Since the direction of rotation of the phase is reversed again in the transmitter, it is possible to output a transmission wave properly.<br>
In the case where the digital modulation processing means 601 performs modulation properly when the second band is<br><br>
used, it will go well if the two selectors 301 are controlled by the band selection control signal 114 so that the two digital orthogonal base-band transmission signals, one of which is an in-phase component and the other of which is its inverted signal, are replaced by each other when the first band is used. When there is no difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the first local oscillation frequency, it will go well if the two selectors 301 are fixed to the state of one of them. It is therefore possible to deal with any high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the first local oscillation frequency.<br>
As has been described above, according to this embodiment, the digital modulation processing means 601, the two inverters 801 and the two selectors 301 are provided in the dual-band digital modulation processing means 112 in the case where orthogonal base-band transmission signals are balanced to improve the antinoise properties. Accordingly, it is possible to output a transmission wave properly even if there is a difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the first local oscillation frequency. As a result, the degree of freedom in designing the first local oscillation frequency is increased. (Eighth Embodiment)<br><br>
An eighth embodiment of the present invention is a dual-band data communication device having means for replacing two digital orthogonal base-band transmission signals, which are a qviadrature component and" its inverted signal, by each other in accordance with a band selection control signal when a second band is used.<br>
Fig. 9 is a detailed block diagram illustrating a dual-band digital modulation processing means 112 in the dual-band data communication device shown in Fig. 1, wherein orthogonal base-band transmission signals are balanced to improve the antinoise properties. In Fig. 9, an inverted signal of an orthogonal base-band transmission signal TX-I which is an in-phase component is referenced by TX-nl, and an inverted signal of an orthogonal base-band transmission signal TX-Q which is a quadrature component is referenced by TX-nQ. The dual-band digital modulation processing means 112 is constituted by a digital modulation processing means 201, two inverters 801 and two selectors 301.<br>
Assume now that the digital modulation processing means 601 is set to perform modulation properly when the first band is used, and that in the high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the first local oscillation frequency, there is a difference between the first and second bands. In this case, the direction of rotation of the phase of a transmission wave outputted from the transmitter is reversed when the second band is used. Therefore, the two selectors 301<br><br>
are controlled in accordance with the band selection control signal 114 given from the band selection control means 113 so as to prevent the direction of rotation of the phase of the transmission wave from being reversed.<br>
When the second band is used, a digital orthogonal base-band transmission signal to be converted by the D/A converter 111 into the orthogonal base-band transmission signal TX-Q which is a quadrature component, and a digital orthogonal base-band transmission signal to be converted by the other D/A converter 111 into the inverted signal TX-nQ of the orthogonal base-band transmission signal TX-Q which is a quadrature component are replaced by each other. As a result, the direction of rotation of the phase of the orthogonal base-band transmission signals is reversed. Since the direction of rotation of the phase is reversed again in the transmitter, it is possible to output a transmission wave properly.<br>
In the case where the digital modulation processing means 601 performs modulation properly when the second band is used, it will go well if the two selectors 301 are controlled by the band selection control signal 114 so that the two digital orthogonal base-band transmission signals, one of which is a quadrature component and the other of which is its inverted signal, are replaced by each other when the first band is used. When there is no difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship between the transmission  frequency  and  the  first  local  oscillation<br><br>
frequency, it will go well if the two selectors 301 are fixed to the state of one of them. It is therefore possible to deal with any high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the first local oscillation frequency.<br>
As has been described above, according to this embodiment, the digital modulation processing means 601, the two inverters 801 and the two selectors 301 are provided in the dual-band digital modulation processing means 112 in the case where orthogonal base-band transmission signals are balanced to improve the antinoise properties. Accordingly, it is possible to output a transmission wave properly even if there is a difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the first local oscillation frequency. As a result, the degree of freedom in designing the first local oscillation frequency is increased.<br>
Although description has been made, in each of the above-mentioned embodiments, about the case where the first local oscillators are used in common between a reception system and a transmission system, the present invention is not limited to this but applicable to the configuration in which separate first local oscillators are used individually in the reception system and the transmission system. In addition, although description has been made, in the above embodiments, about the case where separate first local oscillators are used individually for a first band and a second band, the present<br><br>
invention is not limited to this but applicable to the configuration in which the first local oscillator is used in common for the first band and the second band. In addition, although description has been made, in the above embodiments, about the case where the first local oscillators are independent of the second local oscillators, the present invention is not limited to this but applicable to the configuration in which a local- oscillator is used in common as the first local oscillator and the second local oscillator.<br>
As has been described above, according to the present invention, there are provided a dual-band digital demodulation processing means for performing demodulation properly and a dual-band digital modulation processing means for performing modulation properly in either case where the first band or the second band is used, in accordance with controlled selection between the first-band local oscillator and the second-band local oscillator by the band selection control means. Accordingly, reception data can be outputted properly even if there is a difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship between the reception frequency and the local oscillation frequency. In addition, a transmission wave can be outputted properly even if there is a difference between the first and second bands in the high/low relationship between the transmission frequency and the local oscillation frequency. As a result, it is possible to obtain an effect that the degree<br><br>
of freedom in designing the first-band local oscillator and the second-band local oscillator can be increased.<br><br><br>
