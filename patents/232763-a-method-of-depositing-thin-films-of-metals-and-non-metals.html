				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
Thin invention relates to a device for depositino thin films of metals and non metals. such as diamond like carbon. Thouah reference is made hereinafter to diamond like carbon. it. is to be understood that a particular and advantaaeous. application is with respect to diamond like carbon film, thouoh the invention it? not intended to be restricted thereto. In Darticular. t.bis invention relates to a dense plasma focus device for denositino thin films of diamond like carban,.<br>
BACKGROUND QF INVENTION<br>
It  is known that diamond like  carbon  films are met agitable  amporphous materials, which mav  include s&gt;. micro crvstalline phase?.  Such a material has  several distinct.   advant.ar.iHS  in  that  it  possesses   extreme hardness  .in  the  rariae  of  10(30—3000  kg/mn2  with  a oenerallv low friction coefficient, between 0.01 to W.28. Further,  diamond  like carbon films have  high  optical trancparency and hihh electrical restivitv.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
It is known to deoosit thin films of  diamond like   carbon   by  the  method  of   chemical    vapour<br>
cleposition.  In one such known method emplovino	hot wire<br>
chemical vapour deposition, the disadvantage is.	that  of<br>
hiah  substrate  temperatures  siuch  as  lO6K.	and  low<br>
deposition   rates.    Such  a   process   has	limited<br>
applications.<br>
Vest another method known in the art consists in an electron asaiwteri chemical. vapour deposition. Such a method is also attended with the dieadvantaoe of a hiah substrate temperature of lO6K.during deposition, and further it is difficult to control the cirowth rate. Yet: another disadvantage is the low quality of films, and consequentially it had limited applications.<br>
A plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition method is also known in the art. and which could either he microwave or remote plasim.3 assisted chemical vapour deposition. In the microwave chemical vapour deposition. the substrate is normalIv Si and which requires to be scratched bv SiC. A disadvantaae is that of hiah siuhstrate temper at'tires in the vicinity of 900°C and low deposition rates. yet another disadvarttaqi? its that its rough surface tapoaraphy limits its optical<br>
and electronic application .In the remote plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition, the substrates  are normally  S1. and Ni. The disadvantaoes are of high substrate  temperature. low deposition rate and rough surface topooraphy „<br>
A physical  vapour   deposition   method   is     known in     the     art   and   employing   ign  beam     sputtering     with     a.<br><br>
current density of source of IMA/Cm2 at 1000 &amp; V, A disadvantage of such a method is that of low deposition rates and also requires extremely low pressures. which adds to the costs.<br>
It is also known in the art to employ a dual ion aputtering beam and wherein the substrate can be Si and variety of metals. A disadvantage of such a method is that the deposition rate depends on pressure.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An cbiect of this present invention is to propose a novel device for depoaitina thin films of metals and nan metals such as diamond like carbon films.<br>
Another ob iect o-f this invention is to propose a device for depositing thin films of metals and<br>
non  metal a  such  as diamond like  carbon  films  which obviate the disadvantage  of the prior art,<br>
ret another object of this invention is to propose a devicefor depositing thin filmsof metals and non metals such aw diamond like carbon films which has high deposition rates.<br>
Still another obiect of this invention is to propose a device for depositiog thin films of metal a and non metele such as diamond like carbon films which has smooth  surface topoaraohy.<br>
A further abject of this invention is to propose a device for depositino thin films of metals; and non metals such as diamond like carbon films which has the required optical transparency.<br>
A still further obiect of this invention is to propose a device for depositina thin films of metals and non metal is such as diamond like carbon films which have required structural, ontical incluclina 1R and Uv range, mechanical and electronic properties.<br>
Yet a further object of this invention it to propose a device for depositing thin films of metals and non metals such as diamond like carbon films which has a high electrical restivity.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a device for depositing thin films of metals and non metals such as diamond like carbon films on different substrates.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a device for depositing thin films of metals and non metals and diamond like carbon on a substrate comprising: i)         a plasma chamber with an anode made of copper and filled with<br>
graphite and a plurality of cathodes; ii)        said anode having a support at the upper end for supporting said<br>
graphite;<br>
iii)       a high voltage source for charging a capacitor assembly; iv)       a   spark   gap   for   allowing   the   discharge   from   said   capacitor<br>
assembly to the electrode assembly; v)        a substrate holder disposed above and in a spaced relationship to<br>
said anode and adapted to be moved away or towards said anode,<br>
the substrate held to the lower end of said holder; vii)      a   shutter  disposed  between   said   anode   and   substrate   in   an<br>
inoperative position.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows the device of the present invention:<br>
Referring to fig. 1. the device 1 of the present invention comprises a focus chamber 2 made of mild steel or stainless steel and has an insulator sleeve 3 which assists in the formation of the plasma. A high voltage charger 4 is connected to a capacitor C1. Which charges capacitor 4 is connected to a capacitor C1. A spark gas SG allows a discharge from capacitor C1 to an electrode assembly consisting of a centrally disposed anode made up of<br>
copper and field  with graghite 5 and a set of symmetrically  disposed cathodes 7. Thus, when capacitor C1 discharges a blasma sheet is formed between anode S and backwall plate 8 and connected to cathodes 7, The hesiaht of insulator sleeve 3 determines the shape of plasma sheet.<br>
Due to the magnetic field there is a force which moves the plasma  sheet away from anode 5 and when it. reaches cathodes 7, the radial component of current density and azimuthal maanetic. field aives an axial force so that the plasma sheet moves at a high speed upwards. and when i.t. reaches the top of anode 5,, there is an axial component of current density and &amp;zi muthal magnetic field. but as current is in the opposite direction, it. results in e collapsing of plasma radielly inward. With such a compression, a hi ah temperature and density plasme acts on the graphite 12 supported at the top of anode 5 and allows the release  of ions in a con i eel ehower towards the? substrate 10. and with the shutter in a withdrawn position. In accordance with this invention. a heater is provided at the holding end of a brass holder 11 for holding substrate .1.0,<br>
The  device  has  a vacuum  pump  13  with  a<br><br>
pressure aanae 14,,  Further, a aass inlet 15 is  provided with device  1 for introduction of a a eta. such as wraon.<br>
In operation,, device 1 is first evacuated hv vac.uu.ii) pump 13. Araon aas is then introduced throuoh gas inlet 15.<br>
Holder  11.  can be moved along  the  vertical axis  so as to allow the distance of substrate 10 to  be varied  from  anode 5.  Dependina on  the   qualitv  and thicknesB  of  film.  substrate  10  is  disposed  at  a distance  of 1 to 10 cm from anode 5.<br><br><br><br>
