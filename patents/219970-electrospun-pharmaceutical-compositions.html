COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"ELECTROSPUN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS"<br>
SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORPORATION, a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, one of the United States of America, of One Franklin Plaza, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to nanofibers of drug particles, method of preparation thereof     and pharmaceutical compositions containing these nanofibers. This invention     further relates to the use of such nanofibers in designing various dosage forms to <br>
achieve maximum bioavailability of a drug moiety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is known that the rate of dissolution of a particulate drug can increase with increasing surface area, i.e., decreasing particle size. Consequently, methods of making finely divided drugs have been studied and efforts have been made to control the size and size range of drug particles in pharmaceutical compositions. For example, dry milling techniques have been used to reduce particle size and hence influence drug absorption. However, in conventional dry milling, as discussed by Lachman, et al, The Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy, Chapter 2, "Milling", p. 45, (1986), the limit of fineness is reached in the region of 100 microns (100,000 nm) when material cakes on the milling chamber. Lachman, et al. note that wet grinding is beneficial in further reducing particle size, but that flocculatipn restricts the lower particle size limit to approximately 10 microns (10,000 nm). However, there tends to be a bias in the pharmaceutical art against wet milling due to concerns associated with contamination. Commercial airjet milling techniques have provided particles ranging in average particle size from as low as about 1 to 50 micrometers (1,000-50,000 nm).<br>
Other techniques for preparing pharmaceutical compositions include loading drugs into liposomes or polymers, e.g., during emulsion polymerization. However, such techniques have problems and limitations. For example, a lipid soluble drag is often '   required in preparing suitable liposomes. Further, unacceptably large amounts of the liposome or polymer are often required to prepare unit drug doses. Further still, techniques for preparing such pharmaceutical compositions tend to be complex. A principal technical difficulty encountered with emulsion polymerization is the<br>

PCT/US01/02399<br><br>
removal of contaminants, such as unreacted monomer or initiator, which can be toxic, at the end of the manufacturing process.<br>
U.S. Pat No. 4,540,602 (Motoyama et al.) discloses a solid drug pulverized in an aqueous solution of a water-soluble high molecular substance using a wet grinding machine. However, Motoyama et al. teach that as a result of such wet grinding, the drug is formed into finely divided particles ranging from 0.5 .mu.m (500 nm) or less to 5 .mu.m (5,000 nm) in diameter.<br>
US Patent No. 5,145,684 (Liversidge et al) discloses dispersible crystalline drug substances having particle sizes lower than 400nm, for increased bioavailability, produced by wet milling.<br>
EPO 275,796 describes the production of colloidal dispersible systems comprising a substance in the form of spherical particles smaller than 500 nm. However, the method involves a precipitation effected by mixing a solution of the substance and a miscible non-solvent for the substance and results in the formation of non-crystalline nanoparticle. Furthermore, precipitation techniques for preparing particles tend to provide particles contaminated with solvents. Such solvents are often toxic and can be very difficult, if not impossible, to adequately remove to pharmaceutically acceptable levels to be practical.<br>
U.S. Pat No. 4,107,288 describes particles in the size range from 10 to 1,000 nm containing a biologically or pharmacodynamically active material. However, the<br>
particles comprise a crosslinked matrix of macromolecules having the active	<br>
material supported on or incorporated into the matrix.<br>
Solid dispersions of drugs in polymers are being investigated to address the diminished bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs. For a recent review see Serajuddin, Journal of Pharmaceutical sciences, 1999,88(10), 1058.<br>
An area of great interest is the rapid dissolve dosage forms, which is targeted towards the specific needs of pediatric, geriatrics and patients with dysphagia.<br>
U.S. Pat No. 4,855,326 describes a melt spinnable carrier agent such as sugar is combined with a medicament then converted into fiber form by melt spinning with "cotton candy" fabricating equipment The as-spun product is converted to<br>

For certain medicaments a binding agent is added to the carrier agent Examples are presented for oral administration, topical application, systemic and non-systemic, intravenous and intra-muscular infusion via multicameral containers. All applications utilize the extraordinarily rapid entry into 5     solution upon  contact with a solvent<br>

U.S. Pat No. 5,948,430 discloses a polymeric film, composition providing instant wetability followed by rapid dissolution/disintegration upon administration in the oral cavity This may be applicable only to soluble drugs. 15<br>
Pulmonary delivery, both as immediate and modified release, dosage forms are being actively investigated.<br>
U.S. Pat No. 5,747,001 discloses the advantages of aerosolized nanoparticles in 20     pulmonary delivery.<br>
WO 99/48476 describes the use of drug/carrier particles having elongation ratio greater than 1.6 for improved delivery by inhalation. Such particles are either produced by SCF technique or by a complex precipitation process. Electrospinning 25    provides a direct scalable process for the production of nanoparticles having greater elongation ratios.<br>

It would be desirable to design a simple pharmaceutical composition which provides for all the positive attributes of the above dosage forms by combining the enhanced bioavailability of nanoparticles and physico-chemical characteristics of a nanofiber in a polymeric carrier matrix, in which the drug nanoparticles are homogeneously<br>
35     embedded, such that a convenient dosage form such as a rapid dissolve, immediate, delayed, modified release could be produced by simply selecting the appropriate polymer, without having to change the process.<br>

DERAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a novel composition of an electrospun fiber 30     which fiber is the result of a high molecular weight polymeric carrier that acts as viscosity enhancer and fiber forming agent and which carrier is spun with a pharmaceutical^ acceptable agent or drag.<br>
As used herein the term "integrated" means that the drug is integrated with, admixed 35     with, comingled with, or mtennixed with the carrier. It is not coated on the surface of an electrospun fiber (woven or non-woven). Specifically the fiber contains both the agent and the carrier together, preferably in a homogeneous manner. While it is<br>
5<br><br>
WO 01/54667<br><br>
PCT/US01/02399<br><br>
recognized that incomplete stirring of the solutions or the neat/melted compositions may result in some heterogenicity of the resultant fiber, the premise is that the drug and the carrier are spun together, rather than being applied in a later step to a fiber.<br>
The electrospun fibers of the present invention are expected to have diameters in the nanometer range, and hence provide a very large surface area. The process generates fibers where a high surface to volume ratio is important This extremely high surface area has profound influence on the bioavailability of a poorly water soluble drug, since it is known that increased surface can lead to increased dissolution rate.<br>
A suitable dosage form, such as oral or parenteral form, including pulmonary administration, may be designed by judicious consideration of polymeric carriers, in terms of their physico-chemical properties as well as their regulatory status. Other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be included to ameliorate the stabilization or de-agglomeration of the drug nanoparticles. The pharmaceutical excipients might also have other attributes, such as absorption enhancers.<br>
Electrospun pharmaceutical dosage form may be designed to provide rapid dissolution, immediate, delayed, or modified dissolution, such as sustained and /or pulsatile release characteristics.<br>
Taste masking of the active agent can also be achieved by using polymers having functional groups capable of promoting specific interactions with the drug moiety. The electrospun dosage forms may be presented as compressed tablets, sachets or films. Conventional dosage forms such as immediate, delayed and modified release systems can be designed by appropriate choice of the polymeric carrier, drug combination, as described in the art.<br>
It is one object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutically acceptable drug nanoparticles embedded homogeneously in polymeric nanofibers, such that the drug readily bioavailable  independent of the route of adrninistration.<br>
Electrospinning, commonly referred to as electrostatic spinning, is a process of producing fibers, with diameters in the range of 100nm. The process consists of applying a high voltage to a polymer solution or melt to produce a polymer jet. As the jet travels in air, the jet is elongated under repulsive electrostatic force to produce nanofibers. The process has been described in the literature since the 1930. A<br>

variety of polymers both natural and synthetic having optimal characteristics have been elctrospun under appropriate conditions to produce nanofibers, (see Reneker et al, Nanotechnology, 1996,7,216). Different applications have been suggested for these electrospun nanofibers, such as air filters, molecular composites, vascular 5     grafts, and wound dressings.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,043,331, is intended for use as a wound dressing whereas U.S. Patent No. 4,044,404, and US Parent No. 4,878,908 are tailored towards creating a blood compatible lining for a prosthetic device. All of the disclosed water insoluble<br>
10     polymers are not pharmaceutically acceptable for use herein, however the water<br>
soluble polymers disclosed are believed to be pharmaceutically acceptable. None of the preparations in these patents disclose a working example of an electrospun fiber with an active agent The patents claim the use of enzymes, drugs and/or active carbon on the surface of the nanofibers, prepared by immobilizing the active<br>
15     moieties so that they act at the site of application and "do not percolate throughout the body".<br>
EP 542514, US 5,311,884 and US 5,522,879 pertain to use of spun fibers for a piezoelectric biomedical device. The piezoelectric properties of fluorinated 20     polymers, such as those derived from a copolymer of vinyidene fluoride and<br>
tetrafluoroethylene are not considered pharmaceutically acceptable polymers for use herein.<br>
US Patent 5,024,671 uses the electrospun porous fibers as a vascular graft material 25     which is filled with a drug in order to achieve a direct delivery of the drug to the<br>
suture site. The porous graft material is impregnated (not electrospun)with the drug and a biodegradable polymer is added to modulate the drug release. The vascular grafts are also made from non-pharmaceutically acceptable polymers, such as the polytetrafluorethylene or blends thereof. 30<br>
US Patent No. 5,376,116, US Patent No. 5,575,818, US Patent No. 5,632,772, US Patent No. 5,639,278 and US Patent No. 5,724,004 describe one form or another of a prosthetic device having a coating or lining of an electrospun non-pharmaceutically acceptable polymer. The electrospun outer layer is post-treated with a drug such as 35     disclosed in the 116 patent (for breast prosthesis). The other patents describe the same technology and polymers but apply the technique to other applications, such as endoluminal grafts or endovascular stents.<br>

PCT/USOl/02399<br><br>
Consequently, the present in vention is the first to produce a pharmaceutical composition of an active agent(s) and a phaimaceutically acceptable polymer as an electrospun fiber. The homogenous nature of this process produces a quantity of 5     fibers which allow for nanoparticles of drags to be dispersed throughout The size of particle, and quality of dispersion provide for a high surface area of drug. One use of the increased surface area of drug is improved bioavailability in the case of a poorly water soluble drug. Other uses would be for decreased drug-drug or enzymatic interactions.<br>
10<br>
The present invention is therefore directed to use in any form of a nanofibrous drug either alone, or in combination with a pharmaceuticaly acceptable polymer (or combination thereof) for enhancing the bioavailability of a drug, preferably a poorly water soluble drug.<br>
15<br>
The present invention is also directed to a rapidly dissolving dosage form comprising an electrospun water soluble polymer in combination with an active agent, such that the rapid dissolving dosage form disintegrates in a rapid manner, over a short time period, in the mouth or other suitable body cavity. In the oral context this would<br>
20     produce small particulate matter, which could be ingested without needing water.<br>
A rapid dissolve dosage form may include a drug which is either water soluble or water insoluble. A rapid onset of action is a not prerequisite for a rapid dissolve dosage form. For a bitter tasting drug it may be advantageous to have it in an<br>
25     insoluble form, either by its own solubility characteristics or by polymer coating. Therefore, the main attribute of a rapid dissolve dosage form is the excipients rapidly disintegrate in the mouth, exposing the drug particles to be easily swallowed. This being the case, electrospun polymer (water-soluble) nanofibers may suitably be premised with drug during spinning or post mixed during fabrication of the rapid<br>
30     dissolve dosage form.<br>
While the application of this process may be of use for incorporation of a pharmaceutically acceptable drug for topical delivery, it is primarily oriented towards oral, intravenous, intramuscular, or inhalation usage. 35<br>
Phaimaceutically acceptable agents, actives or drugs as used herein, is meant to include active agents having a pharmacological activity for use in a mammal,<br><br><br>
c    WO 01/54667<br><br>
PCT/US01/02399<br><br>
preferably a human. The pharmacological activity may be prophylactic or for treatment of a disease state. The usage is not meant to include agricultural or insecticide usage for application to plants or soil. Use of the electrospun fiber as a woven or non-woven fabric for direct application as a topical treatment in wound 5     dressing or in clothing is also not an aspect of the present invention. However, use of the fibers in a pharmaceutical formulation for topical administration are considered within the scope of the present invention.<br>
As used herein the term's "active agent", "drug moiety" or "drug" are used 10     interchangeably.<br>
Water solubility of the active agent is defined by the United States Pharmacoepia. Therefore, active agents which meet the criteria of very soluble, freely soluble, soluble and sparingly soluble as defined therein are encompassed this invention. It is 15     believed that the electrospun polymeric composition which most benefit those drugs which are insoluble or sparingly soluble.<br>
Suitable drug substances can be selected from a variety of known classes of drugs including, for example, analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, anmelmintics, anti-20     anhylhmic agents, antibiotics (including penicillin's), anticoagulants,<br><br><br>
WO 01/54667<br><br>
PCT/US01/02399<br><br>
which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The drug substances are commercially available and/or can be prepared by techniques known in the art<br>
As noted, the electrospun composition may also be able to taste mask the many bitter<br>
5     or unpleasant tasting drugs, regardless of their solubility. Suitable active ingredients<br>
for incorporation into fibers of the present invention include the many bitter or unpleasant tasting drugs including but not limited to the histamine H2-antagonists,<br>
such as, cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine, etinidine; lupitidine, nifenidine, niperotidine, roxatidine, sulfotidine, tuvatidine and zaltidine; antibiotics, 10     such as penicillin, ampicillin, amoxycillin, and erythromycin; acetaminophen; aspirin; caffeine, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, bromopheniramine, chloropheniramine, theophylline, spironolactone, NSAIDS's such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naprosyn, and nabumetone; 5HT3 inhibitors, such as granisetron<br>
(Kytril®), or ondansetron (Zofran®); seratonin re-uptake inhibitors, such as 15     paroxetine, fluoxetine; fluvoxamine, and sertraline; vitamins such as ascorbic acid, vitamin A, and vitamin D; dietary minerals and nutrients, such as calcium carbonate, calcium lactate, etc., or combinations thereof.<br>
Suitably, the above noted active agents, in particular the anti-inflammatory agents, 20    may also be combined with other active therapeutic agents, such as various steroids, decongestants, antihistamines, etc., as may be appropriate.<br>

PCT/US01/02399<br><br>
Suitable polymeric carriers can be preferably selected from known pharmaceutical excipients. The physico-chemical characteristics of these polymers dictate the design of the dosage form, such as rapid dissolve, immediate release, delayed 5     release, modified release such as sustained release, or controlled release, pulsatile release etc.<br>
DNA fibers have been used to form fibers by electrospinning, Fang et al., J.<br>
Macromol. Sci.-Phys., B36(2), 169-173 (1997). Incorporation of a pharmaceutically 10     acceptable active agent, such as a biological agent, a vaccine, or a peptide, with<br>
DNA, RNA or derivatives thereof as a spun fiber is also within the scope of this<br>
          invention.	......<br>
The fiber forming characteristics of the polymer are exploited in the fabrication of<br>
   15    nanofibers. Hence, molecular weight of the polymer is the  single most important parameter for choice of polymer. As previously noted, a large number of  polymers have already been electrospun, such as cellulose acetate, PVA, PEO, PVP, polyacrylamide, polyurethane, polycarbonate, PTFE, PE, PP, polyacrylate, Kevlar, PHB, polyaniline, DNA, poly (phenylene terphthalamide) and silk.<br>

By derivatives it is meant, polymers of varying molecular weight, modification of functional groups of the polymers, or co-polymers of these agents, or mixtures thereof. 5<br>
Further, two or more polymers can be used in combination to form the fibers as noted herein. Such combination may enhance fiber formation or achieve a desired drug release profile.<br>
10     The choice of polymers taken with the active agent may provide suitable taste masking functions for the active agents. For instance, use of an ionic polymer of contrasting charge, such as a cationic polymer complexed with an anionic active agent, or an anionic polymer complexed with a cationic active agent may produce the desired results. Addition of a second taste masking agent, such as a suitable<br>
15     cyclodextrin, or its derivatives may also be used herein.<br>
The polymeric composition may be electrospun from a solvent base or neat (as a melt). Solvent choice is preferably based upon the solubility of the active agent. Suitably, water is the best solvent for a water soluble active agent, and a water 20     soluble polymer like POLYOX. Alternatively, water and a water-miscible organic solvent may used. However, it is necessary to use an organic solvent to prepare a homogenous solution of the drug with polymer when the drug is non-water soluble, or sparingly soluble.<br>
