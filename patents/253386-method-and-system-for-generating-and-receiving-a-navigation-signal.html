				<td>METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR GENERATING A NAVIGATION SIGNAL<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to modulation signals, systems and methods such as, for example,<br>
navigation and positioning signals, systems and methods.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Satellite Positioning Systems (SPS) rely on the passive measurement of ranging signals<br>
broadcast by a number of satellites, or ground-based or airborne equivalents, in a<br>
specific constellation or group of constellations. An on-board clock is used to generate<br>
a regular and usually continual series of events, often known as 'epochs', whose time of<br>
occurrence is coded into a random or pseudo-random code (known as a spreading code).<br>
As a consequence of the pseudo-random or random features of the time epoch encoding<br>
sequence, the spectrum of the output signal is spread over a frequency range determined<br>
by a number of factors including the rate of change of the spreading code elements and<br>
the waveform used for the spreading signal. Typically, the spreading waveform is<br>
rectangular and has a sine function power spectrum.<br>
The ranging signals are modulated onto a carrier signal for transmission to passive<br>
receivers. Applications are known that cover land, airborne, marine and space use.<br>
Typically, binary phase shift keying is employed to modulate the carrier signal, which,<br>
itself, has a constant magnitude. Usually, at least two such signals are modulated onto<br>
the same carrier in phase quadrature. The resulting carrier signal retains its constant<br>
envelope but has four phase states depending upon the two independent input signals.<br>
However, it will be appreciated that two modulating signals do not need to have the<br>
same carrier magnitude. It is possible for a constant carrier magnitude of the combined<br>
signal to be maintained by appropriate selection of corresponding phases other than π/2<br>
radians.<br>
An example of such a satellite positioning system is the Global Positioning System<br>
(GPS). Generally, the GPS operates using a number of frequencies such as, for<br>
example, L1, L2 and L5, which are centred at 1575.42 MHz, 1227.6 MHz and 1176.45<br>
MHz respectively. Each of these signals is modulated by respective spreading signals.<br><br>
As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a Coarse Acquisition (CA) code signal<br>
emitted by the GPS Satellite Navigation System is broadcast on the L1 frequency of<br>
1575.42MHz with a spreading code rate (chip rate) of 1.023MHz. The CA has a<br>
rectangular spreading waveform and is categorised as BPSK-R1. The GPS signal<br>
structure is such that the signal broadcast by the satellites on the L1 frequency has a<br>
second component in phase quadrature, which is known as the precision code (P(Y)<br>
code) and is made available to authorised users only. The P(Y) signal is BPSK<br>
modulated with a spreading code at 10.23MHz with a magnitude which is 3dB lower in<br>
signal power than the CA code transmission. Consequently, the Q component has a<br>
magnitude which is 0.7071 (-3dB) of the magnitude of the I component. It will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that the phase angles of these states of these<br>
signals are ±35.265° in relation to the ±1 axis (phase of the CA code signal as specified<br>
in ICD GPS 200C). One skilled in the art also appreciates mat the P code is a function<br>
of or is encrypted by the Y code. The Y code is used to encrypt the P code. One skilled<br>
in the art appreciates that the L1 signal, containing both I &amp; Q components, and the L2<br>
signal can be represented, for a given satellite, i, as<br><br>
Pi(t) represents the P(Y) ranging code and is a pseudo-random sequence with a chip rate<br>
of 10.23 Mcbps. The P code has a period of exactly 1 week, taking values of +1 and -1;<br>
Ci(t) represents the CA ranging code and is a 1023 chip Gold code, taking values of +1<br>
and-1;<br>
di(t) represents the data message, taking values of+1 and -1.<br><br>
A satellite constellation typically comprises 24 or more satellites often in similar or<br>
similarly shaped orbits but in a number of orbital planes. The transmissions from each<br>
satellite are on the same nominal carrier frequency in the case of code division access<br>
satellites (such as GPS) or on nearby related frequencies such as GLONASS. The<br>
satellites transmit different signals to enable each one to be separately selected even<br>
though several satellites are simultaneously visible.<br>
The signals from each satellite, in a CDMA system like GPS, are distinguished from<br>
each one another by means of the different spreading codes and/or differences in the<br>
spreading code rates, that is, the pi(t) and Ci(t) sequences. Nevertheless, as will be<br>
appreciated from the power spectrum 100 shown in figure 1 there remains significant<br>
scope for interference between the signals transmitted by the satellites. Figure 1 shows<br>
power spectra 100 for the CA and P(Y) codes. The power spectrum 102 for the CA<br>
code has maximum power at the carrier frequency L1 and zeros at multiples of the<br>
fundamental frequency, 1.023MHz, of the CA code. For example, it can be appreciated<br>
that zeros occur either side of the carrier frequency at ±1.023MHz, ±2.046MHz etc.<br>
Similarly, the power spectrum 104 for the P(Y) code has a maximum amplitude centred<br>
on the LI and L2 frequencies, with zeros occurring at multiples of ±10.23MHz as is<br>
expected with a sine function waveform.<br>
It is known to further modulate the ranging codes using a sub-carrier, that is, a further<br>
signal is convolved with the P codes and/or CA codes to create Binary Offset Carrier<br>
(BOC) modulation as is known within the art see, for example, J. W. Betz, "Binary<br>
Offset Carrier Modulation for Radionavigation", Navigation, Vol. 48, pp227-246,<br>
Winter 2001-2002. Standard BOC modulation 200 is illustrated in figure 2. Figure 2<br>
illustrates the combination of a portion of a CA code 202 with a subcarrier signal to<br>
produce the BOC signal 204 used to modulate a carrier such as, for example, LI. It can<br>
be appreciated that the BOC signal is a rectangular square wave and can be represented<br>
as, for example, Cj(t)*sign(sin(27πfst)), where fs is the frequency of the subcarrier. One<br>
skilled in the art understands that BOC(/i/c) denotes Binary Offset Carrier modulation<br>
with a subcarrier frequency of fs and a code rate (or chipping rate) of fc. Using binary<br>
offset carriers results in the following signal descriptions of the signals emitted from the<br>
satellite:<br><br><br>
Figure 2 also illustrates power spectra for a BPSK-R1 code and pair of BOC signals,<br>
that is, BOC(2,1) and BOC(10,5). The first spectrum 202 corresponds to BPSK-R1<br>
code. The second power spectrum 204 corresponds to the BOC(2,1) code and the third<br>
power spectrum 206 corresponds to the BOC(10,5) code. It can be appreciated that the<br>
side lobes 208 of the BOC(2,1) signal have a relatively large magnitudes. Similarly, the<br>
illustrated side lobe 210 of the BOC(10,5) signal has a relatively large magnitude. One<br>
skilled in the art appreciates that the energy in the side lobes are a source of<br>
interference.<br>
It is an object of embodiments of the present invention to at least mitigate the problems<br>
of the prior art.<br>

Figure 16 illustrates a receiver system according to an embodiment of the invention:<br><br><br>
It will be appreciated that there are preferably restrictions on the combinations of<br>
signals, at least one of which is that a constant modulus signal should be maintained.<br>
The constraints are (1) that "+1" or "-1" on the in-phase component can only occur in<br>
conjunction with "0" on the quadrature phase<br>
component and visa versa and (2) "±l/\/2" can only occur on both phases<br>
simultaneously. The magnitudes of the in-phase and quadrature phase components of<br>
the spreading signals, sc(g(t) or scim(t), can be plotted on an Argand diagram 400 such as<br>
is shown in figure 4. The waveforms for the I and Q components are thus built from the<br>
following signal element sequences:<br><br>
Any combination of I or Q signal sequences can be chosen from the above set within<br>
the constraint of a constant magnitude carrier signal, computed as (I2+Q2)1/2. It will be<br>
clear to those skilled in the art, that there are many other equivalent sets of sequences<br>
which may be chosen from the set of 5-levels satisfying the criterion of a constant<br>
carrier envelope. It can be appreciated that the magnitudes of the subcarriers on the I<br>
and Q channels can be thought of as being analogous to the states of an 8-PSK signal.<br>
Therefore, such a pair of 5-level subcarrier carrier signals can be thought of as 8 phase<br>
subcarrier signals.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the effect of using a stepped or m-level, m&gt;2, subcarrier waveform.<br>
Referring to figure 5 there is shown a pair 500 of power spectra. The first power<br>
spectrum 502, illustrated using the dotted line, represents the spectrum of a BOC(2,2)<br>
subcarrier. It can be appreciated that the energy of the subcarrier is contained within<br>
progressively reducing side lobes 504, 506, 508 and 510. The second power spectrum<br>
512 represents the power spectrum of a BOC(2,2) signal that used 8 phase subcarrier<br>
signals, that is, 8 phase amplitudes, represented by BOC8(2,2). More generally,<br>
BOCm(fsfc) represents an m-phase subcarrier signal of having a frequency of fs and a<br><br>
chipping rate of fc. It can be appreciated that the spectrum 512 of the BOC8(2,2) signal<br>
has a number of side lobes 514, 516, 518, 520, 522 and 524. Of those side lobes, it can<br>
be seen that the 1st to 4th side lobes are significantly reduced, that is, they comprise<br>
significant less energy, as compared to the side lobes of the BOC(2,2) signal spanning<br>
the same frequencies. The significant reduction in the 1st to 4* side lobes can be<br>
beneficial in situations in which one skilled in the art wishes to use the frequency<br>
spectrum spanned by the side lobes for other transmissions.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the BOC8(2,2) has significandy<br>
improved interference properties as determined using Spectral Separation Coefficients<br>
(SSC) and self-SSCs as is well understood by those skilled in the art, that is, the spectral<br>
coupling between a reference signal and BOC(2,2) is greater than the spectral coupling<br>
between a reference signal and BOC8(2,2). For example, a BOC8(2,2) signal exhibits a<br>
10-12 dB improvement in spectral isolation as compared to a conventional BOC(2,2)<br>
signal. Further information on the relationship between SSC and signals according to<br>
embodiments of the present invention can be found in, for example, Pratt &amp; Owen;<br>
BOC Modulation Waveforms, IoN Proceedings, GPS 2003 Conference, Portland,<br>
September 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes and filed<br>
herewith as in the appendix.<br>
Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention utilise the magnitude and duration<br>
of the subcarrier to influence, that is, control the energy in harmonics of the resulting<br>
modulating waveform. For example, referring still to figure 5, it can be appreciated that<br>
additional spectral nulls appear in the BOC8(2,2) spectrum at substantially 6MHz and<br>
10MHz offset from the carrier whereas there are no such nulls in the conventional<br>
BOC(2,2) signal. The location of the nulls is influenced by at least one of the<br>
magnitude and duration of the steps in the multilevel subcarrier. More specifically, the<br>
nulls can be steered to desired locations by changing either of these two elements, that<br>
is, the position of the nulls is influenced by these two elements. Appendix A contains<br>
an indication of the relationship between the spectra of signals according to<br>
embodiments of the present invention and the magnitude and duration of the steps.<br>
Referring to figure 6, there is shown subcarrier states or amplitudes for I and Q signals<br>
for a further BOC8 signal, that is, a binary offset carrier having eight states. It can be<br><br><br>
It will be appreciated that the states 1 to 8 shown in figure 6 are not equidistantly<br>
disposed circumferentially. The transitions between states 2&amp;3, 4&amp;5, 6&amp;7, 8&amp;1 are<br>
larger in angular step than the transitions between states 1&amp;2, 3&amp;4, 5&amp;6, 7&amp;8. It will<br>
be appreciated that when these states are translated into subcarrier amplitudes, the<br>
duration of a given amplitude will depend on the duration or dwell time of a<br>
corresponding state, that is, the durations for which the subcarrier remains in any<br>
given state may no longer be equal unlike the states of figure 4 above. The dwell times<br>
are a matter of design choice such as, for example, to minimise the mean square<br>
difference between a stepped waveform and a sinusoid. Figure 7a illustrates the<br>
subcarriers 700 and 702 corresponding to the states shown in figure 6. It can be<br>
appreciated that the durations of or within each state of the subcarriers 700 and 702 are<br>
equal. The Q channel subcarrier magnitudes will follow substantially the same pattern<br>
as described above but phase shifted by 7t/2 radians. The subcarrier 702 for the Q<br>
channel is shown in dotted form in figure 7. It will be appreciated that such subcarriers<br>
provide a constant envelope magnitude since (I2+Q2)1/2=l for all amplitude<br>
combinations. However, referring to figure 7b, there is shown a pair of subcarriers 704<br><br><br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that the above can be extended to n half cycles of a<br>
subcarrier per ranging code chip.<br>
It will be appreciated that other phases can be used to describe the subcarriers. For<br>
example, phase and amplitude components of 16-PSK can be used to create BOC16<br>
subcarriers having 9 levels, assuming that the first state is at (+1,0). Using m-PSK<br><br>
phase states can be used to produce (m+2)/2 level subcarrier signals. Therefore, setting<br>
m=2 gives the conventional BPSK and a two-level subcarrier. Setting m=4 provides a 3<br>
level subcarrier, that is, BOC4 modulation, setting m=8 produces a 5 level subcarrier,<br>
that is, BOC8 modulation, setting m=16 produces a 9 level subcarrier, which<br>
corresponds to BOC16 modulation.<br>
It will be appreciated that several further variations in the assignment of code and data<br>
states to the phase locations can be realised. For example, rotation of the states shown<br>
in figure 4 by 22.5° leads to a reassignment of angles associated with the states from the<br>
angles (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°) to the angles (22.5°, 67.5°, 112.5°,<br>
157.5°, 202.5°, 247.5°, 292.5°, 337.5°). Again, it will be appreciated mat this does not<br>
cause a change in the modulus of the spectrum and, again, the required number of<br>
amplitude levels reduces from 5 to 4, that is, m-PSK can be used to realise [(m+2)/2-l]<br>
amplitudes according to appropriate rotation and alignment of the phase states. The<br>
resulting waveforms for the I and Q components are built, in this case, from the<br>
following signal element sequences:<br><br>
It should be noted that the I and Q signal element sequences for the cases described<br>
above are orthogonal over the duration of one spreading pulse (chip). Clearly, other<br>
rotations are possible and will yield orthogonal signal element sets.<br>
An alternative way of representing the above is via a state table. Assume that an<br>
embodiment of a BOC8 modulation has been realised with equidistant states and the<br>
first state has a phase angle of rc/8 radians (22.5°) as shown in figure 8, which<br><br>
corresponds to the above values. The sequence of phase states required for each I and Q<br>
ranging code signal component, assuming that the ranging codes transition substantially<br>
simultaneously and a desire to maintain a substantially constant output envelope, that is,<br>
the states for the subcarriers would be given by<br><br>
Table 1 - Sequence of States for BOC8(x,x) I &amp; Q signal elements<br>
It will be appreciated that the subcarrier corresponding to the phase states in Table 1<br>
comprises a half cycle per ranging code chip. Furthermore, the sense of the phasor is<br>
clockwise when I and Q are equal and anticlockwise otherwise. It will be apparent that<br>
the signal element sequences or state sequences are sections (specifically half cycle<br>
sections in the aspect of the invention disclosed above) of a sampled or quantised<br>
sinusoid. The concept can, therefore, be extended to include a multiplicity of such<br>
samples. Those variants, which appear to be useful, include the cases with samples<br>
from a finite number of half cycles, that is, rather than, for example, an I channel value<br>
of +1 being represented by the states of 2, 1,8 and 7, it can be represented using some<br>
otiier number of states such as, for example, 2, 1, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 8, 7 ie by three<br>
half cycles of the sample or quantised sinusoid. Table 2 illustrates the phase states for<br>
such an embodiment and is based on the phase state diagram of figure 4 for samples but<br>
using three half cycles (or an arbitrary number of half cycles) of the sinusoid waveform.<br>
The sinusoid or portion or multiple of half cycles thereof is known as the 'basis<br>
waveform'. One skilled in the art realises that other basis waveforms can be used such<br>
as, for example, a triangular waveform or a set of mutually orthogonal waveforms.<br><br><br><br><br>
One skilled in the art will appreciated mat it is assumed in Tables 1 to 3, that the I and Q<br>
chip transitions happen substantially simultaneously and, furthermore, that the I and Q<br>
subcarriers take the form of sine and cosine waveforms respectively. However,<br>
embodiments can be realised in which me ranging code chip transitions do not occur<br>
substantially simultaneously. Furthermore, in circumstances in which the ranging code<br>
chip transitions do not occur substantially simultaneously, the subcarriers corresponding<br>
to the I and Q ranging code chips can be arranged to take the form of a pair of quantised<br>
sine waves.<br>
It will seen that there are 4 time samples for each V2 cycle of the waveform. The<br>
stepped sinusoidal waveform may be viewed as sub-carrier modulation of the basic<br>
spreading waveform. The number of time samples and independent information<br>
bearing channels is related to the number of phase states, which me carrier signal has in<br>
its representation. Although the examples above have used phase states that are<br>
'powers of 2', embodiments can be realised in which some other number is used. For<br>
example, a 6-PSK carrier signal can be used to carry 2 independent information bearing<br>
binary channels. In mis case only 3 signal element samples are required per transmitted<br>
code chip.<br><br>
One skilled in the art appreciates that the replacement of the stepped sinusoid with a<br>
rectangular wave with the duration of each element being equal to a Vi cycle of the<br>
sinusoid is well known within the art. As indicated above, it is known as 'Binary Offset<br>
Carrier' modulation. There are usually 2 further attributes associated with the BOC<br>
description, which relate to the frequency of the code chipping rate and to the frequency<br>
of the offset sub-carrier. BOC(2,2) consequently is interpreted as a waveform with a<br>
2.046MHz chipping rate and a 2.046MHz offset sub-carrier. This arrangement has<br>
exactly two Vi cycles of the sub-carrier signal for each code element (chip).<br>
A further aspect of embodiments of the present invention relates to using a set of<br>
subcarriers to modulate ranging codes, with at least one or more, or all, of the<br>
subcarriers being multilevel waveforms. One skilled in the art may think of such<br>
embodiments as modulation of the subcarrier signal by a further subcarrier signal. The<br>
resulting signal transmitted by an ith satellite or system having a carrier frequency of COi,<br>
for an additional subcarrier, would have the form:<br><br>
scim(t) and scjm(t) represent first and second subcarrier signals respectively first ranging<br>
codes such as, for example, M-codes; and<br>
scig(t) and scjg(t) represent first and second subcarrier signal second ranging codes such<br>
as, for example, Gold codes.<br>
It should be noted that embodiments can be realised in which scim(t) and sc;g(t) are the<br>
same or different. Similarly, embodiments can be realised in which scjm(t) and scig(t)<br>
are the same or different.<br><br><br><br>
Although it is possible to use more than one subcarrier, practical embodiments will<br>
typically use 2 subcarriers. Modulation using a pair of subcarriers is known as Double<br>
Binary Offset Carrier (DBOC) modulation. Modulation using three subcarriers is<br>
known as Triple Binary Offset Carrier (TBOC) modulation and so on such that<br>
modulation using a n-tuple of subcarriers is known as N-tuple Binary Offset Carrier<br>
(NBOC). As mentioned above, one or more than one of the subcarriers may be stepped,<br>
that is, having magnitudes related to respective phase states.<br>
As examples of this aspect of the invention, figure 9 illustrates a pair of waveforms 900.<br>
In figure 9, as an illustration of the NBOC invention, the subcarrier basis waveforms are<br>
assumed to be binary and only a single subcarrier waveform 902 is shown. The time<br>
duration in figure 9 is 512 samples and exactly matches the duration of one code<br>
element duration (chip). The first subcarrier 902 contains 4 half cycles of a subcarrier<br>
per ranging code chip, as illustrated by the dashed waveform. If this was the only sub-<br>
carrier component, the modulation would be a BOC(2x,x) type, where x is the<br>
frequency of the code rate (chipping rate). However, it can be appreciated that a second<br>
sub-carrier (not shown) having 16 half cycles per 512 samples has been used to produce<br>
the modulated waveform 904 to be combined with the carrier of the satellite signal. The<br>
modulated waveform is shown by the solid curve. As a result of modulation<br>
(multiplication) of the two subcarriers, the resulting waveform 904 has phase reversals<br>
for the second subcarrier 904 whenever there is a sign reversal in the first subcarrier<br>
902. This is clearly evident in figure 9 at points 906, 908 and 910, where the transitions<br>
of the second subcarrier (not shown) would have been opposite. The resulting<br>
modulation is denoted Double BOC, or DBOC. In the case of figure 9, the modulation<br>
is DBOC(8x,(2x,x)), that is, there are 8 half cycles of the second subcarrier per chip of<br>
the ranging code (not shown). The main energy is concentrated around frequencies ±8x<br>
from the carrier signal, with a BOC-like double humped spectrum.<br>
Referring to figure 10, there is shown a pair of power spectra 1000. A first power<br>
spectrum 1002 relates to a DBOC8(16,(2,2)) signal. It will be appreciated that at least<br><br>
one of the first and second subcarriers used to create the DBOC8(16,(2,2)) signal<br>
comprised amplitudes derived from 8 corresponding phase states. In the specific<br>
embodiment shown, the first subcarrier was the multi-level signal. It will be<br>
appreciated mat the nomenclature for representing DBOC modulation or subcarriers is<br>
DBOCa(b,c(d,e)), where a and c represent the number of phase states, that is,<br>
amplitudes, of the subcarriers having frequencies b and d respectively. The second<br>
spectrum 1004 relates to a BOC8(2,2) signal. The spectra shown have been made using<br>
a previous aspect of the invention, that is the use of multilevel subcarriers or subcarriers<br>
having more than two phase states, in combination with the Double BOC concept. The<br>
waveforms for I &amp; Q modulations for the spectrum of figure 10 are shown in figure 11.<br>
Referring to figure 11 there is shown a pair 1100 of waveforms. The first pair of<br>
waveforms 1102, representing the I channel of the spreading waveform, comprises a<br>
stepped or multi-level BOC(2,2) signal 1104, represented by the solid line, and a 16Mhz<br>
subcarrier modulated BOC(2,2) signal 1106, represented by the dashed line. It will be<br>
appreciated that the 16 MHz subcarrier modulated BOC(2,2) signal has been produced<br>
by multiplying the BOC8(2,2), that is, stepped BOC(2,2) signal, by a 16 MHz<br>
rectangular waveform (not shown) having amplitudes of +1. The second waveform<br>
1108, representing the Q channel, comprises a quadrature BOC(2,2) signal 1110<br>
together with a 16MHz subcarrier modulated BOC(2,2) signal 1112. It can be<br>
appreciated that the first subcarrier 1104 or 1110 is a subcarrier according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention described above whereas the second sub-carrier<br>
(not shown) in both cases are conventional binary rectangular waveforms, that is,<br>
conventional subcarriers. It can be appreciated that there are regions 1114 of overlap<br>
between the two BOC(2,2) subcarriers 1104 and 1110 and their resulting products, that<br>
is, 16 MHz subcarrier modulated BOC(2,2) signals 1106 and 1112. In the regions of<br>
overlap 1114, the waveforms have the same amplitude profile.<br>
An advantage of the embodiments of the signals shown in figure 11 is that the I channel<br>
or component has been produced or represents DBOC8 modulation or signal whereas<br>
the Q channel has been produced using or represents BOC8 modulation. However, this<br>
arrangement still preserves or provides a substantially constant envelope carrier signal<br>
to be emitted from the satellite.<br><br>
Embodiments of the present invention have been described with reference to the<br>
subcarrier signals being periodic. However, embodiments can be realised in which the<br>
subcarrier signal comprises a pseudorandom noise signal. Furthermore, embodiments<br>
can be realised in which the shape of the subcarrier takes a form other than a stepped,<br>
that is, a multilevel wave or quantised approximation of a sinusoidal waveform. For<br>
example, multilevel-pulsed waveforms, multilevel-periodic waveforms or multilevel-<br>
aperiodic waveforms, could be used such as the signal shown in figure 12 according to<br>
the influence one skilled in the art wishes the resulting modulation to have on the power<br>
spectrum of the transmitted signal and/or any appropriate measure of interference such<br>
as, for example, SSC or self-SSCs.<br>
Referring to figure 13, there is shown a subcarrier waveform 1300 according to a further<br>
embodiment of the present invention together with one chip 1302 of a code or otiier<br>
waveform such as, for example, another subcarrier. It can be appreciated mat the<br>
subcarrier comprises a first portion of a BOC(5,l) waveform, in the 100 ns sections,<br>
combined widi portions of a BOC(l,l) waveform, in the 400 ns portions, to produce an<br>
overall subcarrier. It will be appreciated tiiat the spectra of the BOC(5,l) waveform<br>
will have a peak at 5*1.023MHz and the BOC(l,l) waveform will have a peak at<br>
1*1.023MHz. Therefore, one skilled in the art appreciates diat selectively combining<br>
the BOC subcarriers allows one skilled in the art to position or relocate the peaks of the<br>
overall subcarrier. Again, it can be appreciated diat the subcarrier used, for example, to<br>
modulate the ranging codes is derived from more dian one subcarrier. Although the<br>
signal described in relation to figure 13 has been derived from BOC(5,l) and BOC(l,l)<br>
subcarriers, embodiments can be realised in which otiier combinations of BOC<br>
subcarriers are used. In effect, the BOC(5,l) and BOC(l.l) signals have been<br>
multiplexed or selectively combined to produce an overall subcarrier signal. It will be<br>
appreciated diat other sequences for the subcarriers can be realised according to a<br>
desired effect upon the power spectrum of a transmitted signal. For example, a<br>
subcarrier can be realised using a pseudorandom sequence as a sub-carrier instead of the<br>
stepped modulations. The use of additional sequences to diat of the main spreading<br>
code has hitherto been limited to use as a tiered code, which changes state after every<br>
complete code repetition interval. The GPS L5 codes are constructed in tiiis manner<br>
using Neumann Hoffman sequences of lengtii 10 or 20 to extend a 1ms code (of 10230<br>
chips or elements) to 10ms or 20ms. The use of a subcode chip interval has not<br><br>
previously been considered. A complete sequence (a sub-sequence) has a duration of<br>
one code chip, or at most a plurality, of code chips. It fulfills a similar role to the sub-<br>
carrier modulation as previously described in that it controls the spectrum of the<br>
emissions. One feature of such a sub-sequence is that such sequences may be chosen to<br>
be common amongst a satellite constellation or a sub-set of the constellation. One such<br>
subset might be a group of ground transmitters providing a local element or<br>
augmentation to the space segment of the system. For example, subcarrier amplitudes<br>
can be realised that have the sequence -++++—+ in 10 subchip intervals or other<br>
sequence of +l's and -l's per ranging code chip or other subcarrier chip according to<br>
the desired effect on spectrum of the resulting signal. Examples such as me 7 subchip<br>
interval sequences would include ++	, +++—, +-+-+--, and can be chosen to<br>
provide similar control over the emitted spectrum.<br>
Referring to figure 14, there is shown, schematically, a transmitter 1400 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The transmitter 1400 comprises means 1402, that<br>
is, a generator, for generating or selecting the ranging codes for transmission. It will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that such ranging codes may be generated by, for<br>
example, shift register implementations. It can be appreciated that the ranging code<br>
selection and/or generation means 1402 is illustrated as producing gift) and nij(t). These<br>
codes are fed to respective mixers 1404 and 1406. The mixers 1404 and 1406 are<br>
arranged to combine the ranging codes with subcarriers according to embodiments of<br>
the present invention. Respective subcarrier generators 1408 and 1410 generate the<br>
subcarriers. Optionally, a data signal, d((t), is also preferably mixed with the ranging<br>
codes and subcarriers. The duration of one bit of the data signal is normally an integer<br>
multiple of the code repetition interval. For example, in GPS CA code, it is 20 times the<br>
1 ms code repetition interval, that is, the data rate is 50 bps. The mixed signals 1412<br>
and 1414 are fed to a further pair of mixers 1416 and 1418, where they are mixed with<br>
in-phase and quadrature phase signals produced via an oscillator and phase shifter<br>
assembly 1420. The further mixed signals 1422 and 1424 are combined, via a combiner<br>
1426, and output for subsequent up conversion by an appropriate up converter 1428.<br>
The output from the up converter 1428 is fed to a high-power amplifier 1430 and then<br>
filtered by an appropriate filter 1433 for subsequent transmission by, for example, a<br>
satellite or other device arranged to emit or transmit the ranging codes.<br><br>
Referring to figure 15, there is shown a schematic representation of a modulation<br>
system 1500 according to an embodiment. The system 1500 comprises a ranging code<br>
generator 1502 for producing a ranging code. The ranging code is fed to a first lookup<br>
table 1504 comprising phase states and a second lookup table 1506 comprising<br>
amplitude states. The output of the phase state lookup table 1504 is used to drive a<br>
phase modulator 1508, which, in turn, produces a voltage signal to control the phase of<br>
a voltage controlled oscillator 1510. The output of the oscillator 1510 is combined, via,<br>
a combiner 1512 such as, for example, a gain controlled amplifier or multiplier, with a<br>
signal output from the amplitude state table 1506 to produce a subcarrier having me<br>
appropriate characteristics.<br>
Aldiough the above embodiments have been described with reference to maintaining a<br>
substantially constant signal envelope, embodiments are not limited thereto.<br>
Embodiments can be realised in which variable modulus signal envelopes are used. It<br>
will be appreciated that the constraints described above, which are aimed at preserving<br>
unitary magnitude of (I2+Q2)1/2, need not necessary apply.<br>
The above embodiments have been described with reference to the I and Q channels<br>
having the same chipping rates. However, embodiments are not limited to such<br>
arrangements. Embodiments can be realised in which different chipping rates are used.<br>
Although embodiments of the present invention have been described with reference to<br>
the LI and L2 frequencies, embodiments are not limited to such arrangements.<br>
Embodiments can be realised in which other frequencies or frequency bands can be<br>
used according to the requirements of the system using the invention. For example, the<br>
lower L band (ie E5a and E5b), the middle (ie E6) and upper L-band (ie E2-L1-E1) can<br>
also benefit from embodiments of the present invention. It will be appreciated mat such<br>
embodiments may use signals having at least three components rather than the two<br>
components described above.<br>
Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention have been described witii reference<br>
to standard BOC. However, one skilled in the art appreciated mat embodiments can<br>
also be realised using Alternative BOC.<br><br>
Furthermore, it will be appreciated that embodiments can be realised in which the<br>
number of half cycles of a subcarrier per chip of a code can be at least one of odd, even,<br>
an integer multiple or a non-integer multiple of the chip, that is, there is a rational<br>
number relationship between the number of subcarrier half cycles and the chip duration.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention described above have focused on the<br>
transmission side of the invention, that is, upon the generation, modulation and<br>
transmission of ranging codes combined with a subcarrier or subcarriers. However, one<br>
skilled in the art appreciated that a converse system and method are required to receive<br>
and process the signals. Once one skilled in the art has designed a system for<br>
transmitting such signals, designing an appropriate receiver is merely the converse of<br>
the transmit operations. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention also relate to<br>
a receiver for processing signals such as those described above.<br>
Referring to figure 16, there is shown a receiver 1600 comprising means 1640 to receive<br>
and down convert a navigation signal according to embodiments of the present<br>
invention. In the embodiment shown the means 1640 to receive and down convert the<br>
navigation signal comprises an input filter 1633, an amplifier 1630 and a down<br>
converter 1628. The means 1640 to receive and down convert the navigation signal<br>
output down converted modulated ranging codes. Also shown is a demodulator 1642<br>
for demodulating the modulated ranging codes using at least one, and preferably two in<br>
the illustrated embodiment, m-level subcarrier demodulation signals from respective<br>
signal generators 1608 and 1610 to recover at one and preferably two ranging codes<br>
ft (0 and w,(0-<br>
In embodiments that use I and Q channels there is also provided means 1644 for<br>
separating the received signal into I and Q channels. It can be appreciated that the<br>
means 1644 for separating the received signal into I and Q channels comprises a pair of<br>
signal paths 1622 and 1624 for coupling the output of the down converter 1628 to a pair<br>
of mixers or demodulators 1616 and 1618. The mixers or demodulators cooperate with<br>
a phase shifter 139 and a local oscillator 1620 to produce an I channel signal 1612 and a<br>
Q channel signal 1614.<br>
The I channel signal 1612 and the Q channel signal 1614 are fed to a pair of mixers or<br>
demodulators 1604 and 1606 that, in conjunction with respective despreading<br>
waveforms sc,g(g) and sc&gt;m(t) from respective waveform generators 1608 and 1610,<br>
allow recovery of the ranging codes gi(t) and nii(t) 1602.<br><br>

abstract and drawings), and/or all of the steps of any method or process so disclosed,<br>
may be combined in any combination, except combinations where at least some of such<br>

Each feature disclosed in this specification (including any accompanying claims,<br>
