				<td>This invention relates to a process for making acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile by the catalytic reaction and more particularly to an improved catalyst for the ammoxidation of propane and isobutane to α,ß unsaturated mononitriles (acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile). The preferred application of the invention is in the recycle process in which unreacted propane and isobutane, along with propylene and isobutene produced by the reaction, are recycled back to the reactor for the conversion to acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile.<br>
Nitriles, such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, have been industrially produced as important intermediates in the preparation of fibers, synthetic resins, synthetic rubbers and the like. The commercially dominant method for their production requires the ammoxidation of propylene or isobutylene in the presence of ammonia and oxygen at a high temperature in a gas phase in the presence of an ammoxidation catalyst.<br>
However, in view of the price differential between propane and propylene, or the price difference between isobutane and isobutene, recent attention has been drawn to the development of a method and catalyst for the production of acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile by an ammoxidation reaction wherein the lower alkane such as propane or isobutane is used as a starting material and such lower alkane is catalytically reacted with ammonia and an oxygen-containing gas in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
Earlier attempts to develop an efficient process for the ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile produce either insufficient yields or processes that necessitated adding halogen promoters to the feed. The latter procedure would require not only reactors made of special corrosion resistant materials, but also a quantitative recovery of the promoter. This added cost eliminated the advantages of the propane/propylene price differential.<br>
Recent patent publications such as EPO O767164-A1 and patents such as U.S. Patent 5,008,427 have been directed to ammoxidation catalyst systems which are directed to solving the problems of previous attempts at propane ammoxidation using specific catalyst. In particular, U.S. Patent 5,008,427 assigned to the assignees of the present invention is specifically directed to a vanadium-antimony promoted catalyst for propane ammoxidation wherein the catalyst is calcined at temperatures of 780°C or higher. The catalyst in the present invention and the ammoxidation procedure disclosed herein is directed to an improvement in the '427 patent.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for the ammoxidation of paraffins to unsaturated mononitriles and the corresponding monoolefins.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an improved catalytic ammoxidation process for making unsaturated mononitriles from lower paraffins without the necessity of using halogen promoters.<br>
It is a still further object in the present invention to provide a process for making a vanadium-antimony promoted oxide catalyst which during calcination, at temperatures of 780°C or higher, activates the catalyst and minimizes or eliminates clumping together of the catalyst to make larger catalyst particles.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved catalyst for use in the ammoxidation of lower paraffins to the corresponding mononitriles and the corresponding monoolefins.<br>
Other objects as well as aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the study of the accompanying disclosure and the claims.<br>

CLAIM:-<br>
1. A process for making acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile by the catalytic reaction in the vapor phase of a paraffin selected from propane and isobutane with molecular oxygen and ammonia by catalytic contact of the reactants in a reaction zone with a catalyst, the feed composition having a mole ratio of the paraffin to ammonia in the range of from about 2.5 to 16 and a mole ratio of paraffin to oxygen in the range of from about 1.0 to 10, wherein said catalyst has the elements in the proportions indicated by the empirical formula:<br>
VSbmAaMObDdOx<br>
where<br>
A         is one or more of Ti, Sn, Fe, Cr and Ga;<br>
D        is one or more of Li, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Ni, Zn, Ge, Nb,<br>
Zr, W, Cu, Te, Ta, Se, Bi, Ce, In, As, B and Mn; m<br>
equals 0.8 to 4; a        equals 0.01 to 2;<br>
0 
d        is 0 to 2;<br>
x is determined by the oxidation state of the cations modification present, and the catalyst has been heated at a temperature of at least 780°C to prepare acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile.<br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein m ranges from about <br>
1.2 to 2.0.<br>
3.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a ranges from about<br>
0.05 to 0.5.<br>
4.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a ranges from about <br>
0.05 to 0.4.<br>
5.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein A includes one or more<br>
of tin, titanium and iron.<br>
6.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the reaction takes place<br>
in a fluid bed reactor.<br><br>
7.	The process as claimed in claim 6, wherein any unreacted propane<br>
or isobutane is recycled into the fluid bed reactor.<br>
8.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein b ranges from greater<br>
than zero to about 0.0045.<br>
9.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein b ranges from greater<br>
than zero to about 0.0035.<br><br>
10.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein b ranges from greater<br>
than zero to abjcrtit 0.0030.<br>
11.	A process  for  making acrylonitrile  or methacrylonitrile  by the<br>
catalytic reaction substantially as hereinbefore described with reference<br>
to the foregoing examples.<br></td>
