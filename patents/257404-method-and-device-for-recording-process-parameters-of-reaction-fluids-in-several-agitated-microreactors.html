The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for<br>
recording of process parameters of reaction liquids in a<br>
plurality of microreactors, which are shaken continuously at<br>
least until the end of the reaction in all of the<br>
microreactors, with the process parameters being recorded in<br>
the microreactors during the reaction with the aid of at<br>
least one sensor optics device which introduces<br>
electromagnetic radiation from a radiation source into the<br>
reaction liquid in a microreactor, and with electromagnetic<br>
radiation which originates from the reaction liquid in the<br>
microreactor being recorded by a sensor which is associated<br>
with the radiation source.<br>
The invention is particularly suitable for automated<br>
recording of process parameters of microbial, biochemical,<br>
enzymatic and chemical reactions in reaction liquids which<br>
are shaken without interruption until completion of the<br>
reaction in all of the microreactors.<br>
By way of example, the biomass, substrate, product and<br>
byproduct concentrations, the self-fluorescence of cells,<br>
the fluorescence of fluorescent proteins and amino acids,<br><br>
pH, T, pO2 and pCO2 values, the oxygen transfer rate (OTR)<br>
and the carbon-dioxide transfer rate (CTR) can be recorded<br>
as parameters of the reaction liquids.<br>
In particular, the above-mentioned parameters are intended<br>
to be determined in microreactors with a size of 10 µl-5ml,<br>
in order to reduce the expense for chemical, biochemical,<br>
enzymatic and microbial optimization methods, also referred<br>
to as screening. Screening is considered, for example, for<br>
the core-area selection, media optimization and optimization<br>
of process control. The small volumes in the microreactors<br>
allow the required high throughputs in many areas of<br>
research and development, in particular such as<br>
combinational chemistry and molecular biotechnology.<br>
So-called microtiterplate readers are known from the prior<br>
art, for recording the absorption and fluorescence in<br>
microbial reaction liquids. The shaking movement of the<br>
microtiterplates must be interrupted for each recording of<br>
process parameters during the reaction. The greater the<br>
number of process parameters that are intended to be<br>
obtained while the reactions are taking place, the more<br>
frequently the shaking movement must be interrupted, thus<br>
disturbing mixing processes and substance transport<br>
processes. This can result in anaerobic conditions in the<br><br>
case of cultures which cause greater or lesser damage to the<br>
various microorganisms. An absorption microtiterplate reader<br>
such as this for 200-well microtiterplates for monitoring of<br>
microbial growth is available, for example, from the Thermo<br>
Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA. The light absorption<br>
by the cells located in the wells is recorded. For this<br>
purpose, electromagnetic radiation from a radiation source<br>
is introduced into the reaction liquid in the wells, and the<br>
electromagnetic radiation emitted from the reaction liquid<br>
in the microreactor is recorded by means of a sensor. The<br>
sensor signals depend on the layer thickness passed through<br>
and on the cell concentration.<br>
Furthermore, US 6,673,532 D2 has already disclosed a<br>
microtiterplate reader for recording of the absorption in<br>
microbial culture liquids, in which the shaking movement of<br>
the microtiterplates need not be interrupted in order to<br>
record the absorption during the reaction. By way of<br>
example, the known apparatus comprises a microtiterplate<br>
with 96 wells, which is held by a microreactor platform. The<br>
individual wells have a volume of between 100 ul and 250 ul.<br>
At least one sensor optics device is located in a sub-<br>
platform arranged under the microreactor platform and has an<br>
excitation source, for example a light-emitting diode, as<br>
well as a detector, which records the absorption of the<br><br>
electromagnetic radiation from the excitation source in the<br>
reaction liquid in the microreactor (wells). The change in<br>
the measured absorption indicates a change in the<br>
concentration of the analyte in the microreactor. One<br>
refinement of the reader provides for the LEDs and the<br>
detectors to be moved from one microreactor to another by<br>
means of a robot. Another refinement provides for each<br>
microreactor to have at least one associated LED and one<br>
associated detector within the sub-platform. The sub-<br>
platform with the sensor optics device or devices is once<br>
again located on a shaking apparatus, which is mounted on a<br>
positioning table. The shaking apparatus is a specially<br>
manufactured device, in order to allow integration between<br>
the positioning table and the sub-platform. The positioning<br>
table can be moved in the XY axis direction and is used for<br>
the purpose of moving individual microreactors under a<br>
dispenser. By way of example, this known apparatus can be<br>
used to assess growth conditions for the microorganisms in<br>
culture liquids in a valid form, since it avoids the<br>
problems which occur as a result of interruption of the<br>
shaking movement.<br>
However, the apparatus has the disadvantage of its complex<br>
design, particularly that of the shaker, which is<br>
specifically matched to the apparatus. A further<br><br>
disadvantage is that the sensor optics device or devices are<br>
also shaken in the sub-platform. Owing to the high shaking<br>
frequencies and the centrifugal forces associated with them<br>
it is possible for problems, and thus errors, to occur in<br>
the recording of the process parameters which, in some<br>
circumstances, make it necessary to repeat the reaction.<br>
This can result in undesirable delays, particularly in the<br>
case of series of investigations relating to microbial<br>
culture liquids, enzymatic and chemical reactions.<br>
Furthermore, WO 92/10754 A has already disclosed liquids in<br>
microtiterplates being analyzed during the shaking process.<br>
This analysis is carried out using video cameras,<br>
photodiodes and a scanning device.<br>
Finally, US-A 5,595 708 discloses a sensor optics device for<br>
series testing of a large number of reactors which are<br>
arranged in a plurality of tilting frames. The sensor optics<br>
device is arranged on an XY positioning unit, which moves to<br>
the individual reactors successively. The signals from the<br>
sensor optics device are processed further in a digital<br>
evaluation unit. The tilting movement of the reactors is<br>
interrupted during the measurements.<br><br>
Against the background of this prior art, the invention is<br>
based on the object of specifying a method for recording of<br>
process parameters of reaction liquids in a plurality of<br>
microreactors which are shaken continuously during the<br>
reaction, and which method operates reliably. A further aim<br>
is to specify an apparatus for carrying out the method,<br>
which can be provided largely by the use of standard<br>
components and apparatuses from biotechnology.<br>
This object is achieved by means of a method having the<br>
features of the independent claims 1, 2, 4 as well as an<br>
apparatus having the features of the independent claim 12.<br>
The advantages and effects of the various solutions will<br>
become evident from the following description.<br>
All of the solutions include the features that<br>
each sensor optics device is not moved, at least during<br>
the recording of the process parameters, so that the<br>
shaken microreactors move relative to each sensor<br>
optics device, and<br>
the electromagnetic radiation which originates from<br>
each sensor optics device is introduced, durirg the<br>
recording of the process parameters in one of the<br>
microreactors, exclusively into this microreactor, and<br>
the radiation emerging from the reaction liquid strikes<br><br>
only the sensor of the sensor optics device.<br>
These features are based on the discovery that continuous<br>
recording of the process parameters is possible ever when<br>
each sensor optics device which is arranged in a positioning<br>
unit has not been moved during the recording of the values<br>
of a process parameter, for example during the recording of<br>
an instantaneous value of natural fluorescence during the<br>
ongoing reaction. The relative movement which occurs during<br>
this process between the shaken microreactors and each<br>
sensor optics device is without any problems provided that<br>
the electromagnetic radiation of each sensor optics device<br>
is introduced, during the recording of the process<br>
parameters in one of the microreactors, exclusively into<br>
this microreactor, and that the radiation which originates<br>
from the reaction liquid strikes only the sensor of the<br>
associated sensor optics device.<br>
The biomass concentration in one of the microreactors may,<br>
for example, be recorded with the aid of scattered light<br>
striking the sensor of the sensor optics system, or the<br>
radiation which originates from the natural fluorescence of<br>
the cells.<br><br>
The substrate concentration, product concentration and<br>
byproduct concentration can be trapped with the aid of IR or<br>
Raman spectroscopy. Biotechnological substrates such as<br>
glucose or glycerin are IR active and Raman active, and form<br>
a specific spectrum, which can be detected even in very<br>
complex media. Metabolism byproducts such as acetic acid and<br>
ethanol likewise have a characteristic spectrum. Organic<br>
substrates can be detected in the microreactors by<br>
transmission of the spectrum via optical waveguides to an IR<br>
spectrometer or Raman spectrometer. More detailed statements<br>
can be found in Sivakesava S., Irudayaraj J., Ali D. (2001):<br>
Simultaneous determination of multiple components in lactic<br>
acid fermentation using FT-MIR, NIR, and FT-Raman<br>
spectroscopic techniques, Process Biochemistry 37, 371-378.<br>
In one advantageous refinement of the invention, the<br>
reaction liquids in the microreactors have at least one<br>
chemical sensor material, in particular such as a<br>
fluorescent dye which, in particular, can be immobilized on<br>
at least one inner wall of the microreactor. Fluorescent<br>
dyes react specifically to their environmental conditions.<br>
For example, platinum porphyrins or ruthenium complexes<br>
react to the presence of oxygen by cancellation of their<br>
fluorescence characteristics. Fluorescence indicator<br>
solutions likewise have a sensitive reaction to changes in<br><br>
the dissolved CO2 concentration (pCO2) and of the pH value by<br>
changing their fluorescence characteristics. If these<br>
substances are immobilized in a porous polymer matrix or are<br>
dissolved or suspended in the reaction liquid, then they act<br>
as optical sensors (also referred to as optodes) for ;pH, T,<br>
pO2, pCo2 values (Liebsch (2000): Time Resolved Luminescence<br>
Lifetime Imaging with Optical Chemical Sensors, Dissertation<br>
at Regensburg University). However, it is also possible to<br>
use normally dissolved pH indicators.<br>

A microtiterplate (1) with an array of microreactors is<br>
inserted into a holder in a tray (4) of a rotation shaker<br>
(5, 6). The rotation shaker (5, 6) reaches a maximum shaking<br>
frequency of, for example 500-2000 urn. The shaking diameter<br>
of the rotation shaker is matched to the recording process.<br>
Electromagnetic radiation at a wavelength of 200 nm-25 µm is<br>
introduced via a sensor optics device (17) through the<br>
cutout (11) in the tray (4) into those wells of the<br>
microtiterplate (1) which are permeable to the radiation,<br>
and the radiation emerging from the wells is recorded by the<br>
sensor optics device (17).<br>
Figure 1A shows one embodiment with a stationary rotation<br>
shaker (5) , in which the subarea of the tray (4) on which<br>
the microtiterplate (1) is fitted projects beyond the drive.<br><br>
This ensures free access between the sensor optics device<br>
(17), which is arranged on an X/Y positioning unit (7) , and<br>
the microtiterplate (1) from its lower face.<br>
Figure 1B shows an embodiment with a tray (4) which is<br>
driven by a suspended rotation shaker (6) . That part of the<br>
tray (4) to which the microtiterplate (1) is fitted need<br>
project beyond the rotation shaker (6) in this embodiment<br>
only when the wells are also intended to be accessible from<br>
above.<br>
Figure 1C shows an embodiment in which the microtiterplate<br>
(1) is held by a shaking frame (16) with a cutout (11). The<br>
shaking frame (16) is separated from the microtiterplate (1)<br>
in the vertical direction by the planar tray (4) . Bscause<br>
the shaking frame (16) is designed to be open at the side,<br>
the sensor optics device (17) can be moved under each well<br>
in the microtiterplate by means of the X/Y positioning unit<br>
(7) without being impeded from the side.<br>
Figures 2A, 2B show apparatuses in which the electromagnetic<br>
radiation from the radiation source and the radiation<br>
originating from the reaction liquids are passed via optical<br>
waveguides (2, 25) .<br><br>
The variant in figure 2A shows the radiation being carried<br>
separately via two optical waveguides (2) . The radiation is<br>
introduced via one optical waveguide (2) which leads towards<br>
the reactor, and the radiation originating from the<br>
microreactor is carried via an optical waveguide (2) which<br>
leads away from the microreactor. A radiation source that<br>
feeds the sensor optics device, and a sensor, are located in<br>
a reader (3) .<br>
The variant shown in figure 2B differs from the variant<br>
shown in figure 2A only in that the two optical waveguides<br>
(2) are combined in one Y-optical waveguide (25) . The<br>
optical waveguides are composed of individual optical fibers<br>
or else of optical fiber bundles. The sensor and the<br>
radiation source which feeds the sensor optics device are<br>
located in the reader (3).<br>
Figure 2C shows a sensor optics device (17) without any<br>
optical waveguides. The radiation source (12) and the sensor<br>
(15) are located directly in the sensor optics device (17),<br>
which may additionally have filters 13, 14 in the beam path.<br>
The excitation light from the radiation source (13) is<br>
aligned directly with each individual microreactor, while<br>
the reaction-dependent radiation which originates from the<br><br>
reaction liquid in the microreactor strikes the sensor (15).<br>
The sensor optics device (17) is connected to an electronic<br>
circuit (9) via a cable or cables (26) in order to supply<br>
the radiation source (12) and in order to transmit the<br>
sensor signals. The circuit (9) controls the radiation<br>
source (12) and is used for reading the sensor signals. In<br>
all variants, the data is acquired and evaluated by means of<br>
a data processing unit, for example a computer (8) . In the<br>
variants shown in Figures 2A, B, the functionality of the<br>
electronic circuit (9) is integrated in the reader (3) . The<br>
sensor optics device (17) is attached to the arm of an X-Y<br>
positioning unit (7), in all of the variants. The X-Y<br>
positioning unit (7) is likewise driven by the computer (8),<br>
by means of a control software.<br>
Depending on the requirement for the measurement task, it is<br>
possible to inject electromagnetic radiation in a closely<br>
constrained wavelength range, for example produced via<br>
optical filters 13, diffraction gratings, prisms or directly<br>
by a radiation source with a defined spectrum, such as a<br>
laser or an LED, and to supply the sensor only with specific<br>
wavelengths from the emitted light. The emitted light can<br>
likewise be filtered by means of optical filters 14,<br>
diffraction gratings or prisms for this purpose.<br><br>
If a flashlamp is used to excite the analytes in the<br>
reaction liquid of a microreactor, it is advantageous for<br>
the shaking rotation speed of the rotation shaker (5, 6) and<br>
the pulse repetition frequency of the flashlamp to be<br>
matched such that no beat states occur. Beat states occur<br>
when the light flashes strike a small number of positions on<br>
the bottom of the reactor and the positions move on the<br>
bottom of the reactor as a result of lack of synchronization<br>
between the shaker frequency and the flash frequency. The<br>
microreactor which is illustrated in figure 4 and is bounded<br>
by a circular-cylindrical bottom (10) and a cylindrical<br>
casing (19) , rotates with a fixed shaking diameter over a<br>
fixed-position light beam (18) of the sensor optics device<br>
(17). The rotation of the microreactor results in the light<br>
beam (18) describing a circular line (11) on the bottom (10)<br>
of the microreactor (see figures 3A and 3B).<br>
Figure 3A illustrates a state in which only 3 flashes are<br>
distributed over the circumference of the circular line<br>
(31) , as a result of the choice of the shaking rotation<br>
speed (n) and of the flash frequency (fa) of the flashlamp.<br>
In this case, fa = 3*n, so that only 3 flashes are initiated<br>
per revolution. Beat states occur particularly if the flash<br>
frequency (fa) is a natural multiple of the shaking rotation<br>
speed (n) . In this case, the light flashes initially start<br><br>
at the same positions (32) on the circular line (31) . Ef the<br>
coverage of the circular line (31) with flashes is low<br>
(
not synchronized with the liquid movement in the reactor,<br>
the positions (32) move in the clockwise sense or<br>
counterclockwise sense on the circular line (31) . Because of<br>
the angle (22) of the sensor optics device (17) , this leads<br>
to different intensities of the electromagnetic radiation<br>
emitted from the microreactor, and disadvantageous<br>
oscillations of the measurement signal can thus occur.<br>
A greater number of light flashes is therefore desirable in<br>
order to avoid beat states, with these being distributed<br>
uniformly over the circular line 31. This can be achieved by<br>
satisfying the condition fa = N*n (where N = natural number) .<br>
Figure 3B illustrates one example relating to this. Thirteen<br>
light flashes are shown over the circumference of the<br>
circular line (31) . The light flashes can be emitted during<br>
one revolution, or else during a plurality of revolutions,<br>
of the rotation shaker. The relationship n=fa*P/U (where P =<br>
number of flashes on the circular line and U = number of<br>
revolutions before P is reached) results in the operational<br>
conditions being set such that as high a number of flashes<br>
(P &gt; 10) as possible are distributed over the circumference<br>
of the circular line. This makes it possible to obtain a<br><br>
stable and homogeneous sensor signal in order to record the<br>
process parameters in the microreactor.<br>
A further possible way to stabilize the sensor signal is to<br>
synchronize the flashes from the radiation source with the<br>
shaking drive, and thus with the liquid movement in the<br>
microreactors. The position of the tray (4) with respect to<br>
the sensor optics device (17) can be determined at any time<br>
by means of a position sensor (for example a light barrier,<br>
an acceleration sensor or a Hall sensor). The light flashes<br>
from the flashlamp are triggered taking into account the<br>
position information. The flash is preferably triggered when<br>
the reaction liquid which is sloshing in the centrifugal<br>
acceleration direction is located above the sensor optics<br>
device (17). This prevents the light beam (18) from striking<br>
zones of the microreactor in which no reaction liquid, or<br>
only a very small amount of reaction liquid, is located<br>
temporarily because of the centrifugal acceleration.<br>
The method according to the invention for recording of the<br>
process parameters of reaction liquids will be explained in<br>
more detail in the following text, on the basis of two<br>
different variants, by means of an apparatus as shown in<br>
figure 2.<br><br>
Figure 4 illustrates one method for successive recording of<br>
the values of process parameters in in each case only one<br>
microreactor, with the sensor optics device (17)<br>
subsequently being moved by means of the positioning unit<br>
(7) .<br>
The sensor optics device (17) is aligned under one<br>
microreactor in such a manner that the electromagnetic<br>
radiation, at a wavelength between 200 nm - 25 µm, is<br>
introduced exclusively into this microreactor in the form of<br>
the light beam (18) for recording of individual measured<br>
values during the reaction. If a cylindrical microreactor is<br>
used having a circular-cylindrical bottom (10), the shaking<br>
diameter (27) of the rotation shaker (5, 6) about the<br>
eccentric axis (21) (see Figure 4) is chosen such that the<br>
light beam (18) from the sensor optics device (17) strikes<br>
only the bottom (10) of one of the microreactors. For this<br>
purpose, the shaking diameter (27) must be chosen to be less<br>
than or equal to the diameter (28) of the bottom (10).<br>
In the case of reactions which take place quickly, it is<br>
possible in order to speed up the recording process to<br>
combine groups of microreactors in a microreactor array,<br><br>
with the process parameters of the individual groups being<br>
recorded successively, but with the process parameters in<br>
the microreactors in one group being recorded at the same<br>
time by one sensor optics device (17) for each microreactor<br>
in the group. The sensor optics devices for simultaneous<br>
recording within one group are arranged on the positioning<br>
unit (7). After simultaneous recording of the process<br>
parameters in the microreactors in one group, the sensor<br>
optics devices are moved to the next group. The sensor<br>
optics devices for one group are aligned under the<br>
microreactors in that group in such a manner that the<br>
electromagnetic radiation of each sensor optics device for<br>
the recording of individual measured values is introduced<br>
exclusively into that microreactor under which the sensor<br>
optics device is currently located.<br>
In order to avoid signal flooding of the sensor, for example<br>
of a photodetector, by light reflections of the excitation<br>
light on the bottom (10), each sensor optics device is<br>
aligned with respect to each microreactor in such a way that<br>
none of the electromagnetic radiation which is reflected<br>
from the walls, in particular the bottom (10) of the<br>
microreactor, strikes the sensor. For this purpose, the<br>
optical waveguide end which is used as the sensor optics<br>
device (17) is positioned at an acute angle (22) with<br><br>
respect to a perpendicular to the bottom (10) of the<br>
microreactor. Different optimal positioning angles (22) are<br>
used, depending on the numerical aperture of the optical<br>
waveguide, preferably between 25° and 40°.<br>
Instead of successive recording of the process parameters it<br>
is, however, also possible to record the process parameters<br>
in all of the microreactors at the same time by one sensor<br>
optics device for each microreactor. The sensor optics<br>
devices are aligned under the microreactors in such a manner<br>
that the electromagnetic radiation (200 nm - 25 µm) is<br>
introduced exclusively into that microreactor which is<br>
associated with that sensor optics device, in the form of<br>
the light beam (18) for recording of the measured values<br>
during the reaction.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates one method for successive recording of<br>
the process parameters in four microreactors which are<br>
arranged adjacent to one another. The process parameters of<br>
the microreactors are recorded by the stationary sensor<br>
optics device (17) successively, on the basis of the<br>
relative circular movement with respect to this sensor<br>
optics device (17). The electromagnetic radiation of the<br>
sensor optics device (17) is introduced, during the<br>
recording of the process parameters in one of the four<br><br>
microreactors, exclusively into this microreactor, The<br>
radiation which emerges from the reaction liquid strikes<br>
exclusively that sensor of the sensor optics device (17) .<br>
Simultaneous injection into two adjacent microreactors is<br>
avoided because of the arrangement of the sensor optics<br>
device (17) with respect to the bottom (10) of the<br>
microreactors.<br>
The sensor optics device (17) is aligned with one of the<br>
four microreactors. If the shaking diameter is chosen to be<br>
equal to the diagonal distance between the center points of<br>
the microreactors, with the microreactors being distributed<br>
as illustrated on the tray (4) , then the 4 microreactors<br>
circle successively over the light beam (18) of the sensor<br>
optics device (17) during one revolution. The microreactors<br>
are moved over the sensor optics device (17) in the sequence<br>
I-IV, with the light beam (10), which is in a fixed position<br>
during the recording process, describing a circular line<br>
(23) . The sensor signals which are caused by the individual<br>
microreactors are recorded by means of the computer (8) ,<br>
which is not illustrated here. In the course of the<br>
evaluation of the sensor signals, those sensor signals and<br>
microreactors from which the electromagnetic radiation which<br>
is responsible for the sensor signals originates are<br>
associated with one another. The microreactor position<br><br>
information that	is required for the association process can<br>
be recorded, for	example, by means of a position sensor (for<br>
example a light	barrier, an acceleration sensor or a Hall<br>
sensor) which is	arranged on the rotation shaker (5, 6) .<br>
If the microtiterplate (1) has more than four microreactors<br>
as illustrated in figure 5, the sensor optics device (17) is<br>
moved to a next adjacent group of microreactors (which are<br>
arranged such that they match one another) with four<br>
microreactors, after recording of the process parameters for<br>
the first group of four microreactors by the positioning<br>
unit (7). A positioning angle of the sensor optics device<br>
(17) at an angle (22) of between 25° and 40° with respect to<br>
bottom (10) of the microreactors has also been found to be<br>
advantageous for this method.<br>
However, the method which has been explained in principle<br>
with reference to figure 5 can also be used to record the<br>
process parameters of a greater number (&gt;4) of microreactors<br>
per group. The shaking diameter (27) must then be chosen<br>
such that the microreactors describe a circle around the<br>
fixed-position sensor optics device, in which more than four<br>
microreactors are recorded successively during one<br>
revolution.<br><br>
In order to speed up the recording process, it is possible<br>
in a method as shown in figure 5 or figure 6C for the<br>
process parameters of a plurality of groups of microreactors<br>
arranged adjacent to one another to each be recorded in<br>
parallel by one sensor optics device for each group.<br>
According to the invention, the reaction liquids in the<br>
microreactors may have at least one chemical sensor<br>
material, which is preferably applied to at least one inner<br>
wall of the microreactor, for example to the bottom (10) .<br>
Chemical sensors such as these are, for example, fluorescent<br>
dyes which act as indicators of process parameters such as<br>
pH, T, pO2 and pCO2. In dissolved form, the fluorescent dyes<br>
can be used to determine the process parameters using the<br>
apparatuses and method as described with reference to<br>
figures 1-5. If the fluorescent dyes are immobilized on the<br>
inner walls as sensitive layers (38, 39), a specific<br>
alignment of the sensor optics device (17) is required, as<br>
is illustrated by way of example in figure 6A-B for the<br>
measurement method shown in figure 4.<br>
In this case, a plurality of sensitive layers (38, 39) can<br>
be arranged on the bottom (10) of the microreactor in such a<br>
way that different process parameters can be recorded. A<br>
cutout in the transparent bottom (10) is left free in order<br><br>
that the light beam (18) can also enter the liquid volume<br>
without any impediment. As shown in figure 6A, the alignment<br>
of the sensor optics device (17) and the shaking diameter<br>
(27) is to be matched such that the light beam (18) always<br>
strikes the sensitive layer (38, 39) or the cutout between<br>
them during one revolution of the tray (4) (shaking diameter<br>
(27) 
(N)+1) - length of a sensitive layer (41)]). As is<br>
illustrated in 41, the length of a sensitive layer in this<br>
case means the longest geometric dimension of a sensitive<br>
layer (38, 39). With regard to the recording of the measured<br>
values, it follows from this that the sensor optics device<br>
(17) is moved to different positions 35, 36 and 37<br>
underneath the bottom (10) of the microreactor with the aid<br>
of the XY positioning unit (7) , in order to record different<br>
process parameters. Position 35 is used to record the<br>
natural fluorescence or the stray light of the reaction<br><br>
liquid, while positions 36, 37 are used to record the<br>
emission from the various sensitive layers 38, 39.<br>
In the variant shown in figure 6B, the various process<br>
parameters are recorded in a microreactor without changing<br>
the position of the sensor optics device between two<br>
recording processes. In this case, the light beam (18)<br>
successively strikes the sensitive layers (38, 39), which<br><br><br>
are immobilized on the bottom, on a circular path. A part of<br>
the bottom surface is free in order to allow direct<br>
injection into the reaction liquid, as is required for<br>
example for recording of specific process parameters, such<br>
as the stray light intensity or natural fluorescence of the<br>
reaction liquid. The various sensor signals are associated<br>
throughout the rotation of the microreactor by means of a<br>
position sensor, which is not illustrated.<br>
In the variant shown in figure 6C, the sensitive layers (38,<br>
39) are fitted in the microreactors such that a plurality of<br>
microreactors are recorded successively by the light beam<br>
(18) during one revolution of the tray. The surface (40)<br>
which is covered by the sensor optics device (17) records<br>
four microreactors and different process parameters, which<br>
must be associated with the individual microreactors after<br>
the recording of the signals. In this case, this is once<br>
again done by means of a position sensor. If the<br>
microreactor array comprises more than the four illustrated<br>
microreactors, the sensor optics device is moved by the<br>
positioning unit (7) to further groups of microreactors,<br>
which are each arranged adjacent to one another and each<br>
have four microreactors, after recording the process<br>
parameters for the first group of four microreactors.<br><br>
When microreactors are used to cultivate microorganisms,<br>
they preferably have an upper opening which can be covered<br>
with a gas-permeable cover during operation, for example in<br>
the form a self-adhesive membrane. This membrane allows<br>
monoseptic operation of the microreactors. The reaction<br>
which takes place in the reaction liquid is supplied with<br>
the necessary gaseous reaction component, but is not impeded<br>
by gaseous reaction products.<br>
An one example of the recording of process parameters which<br>
have been determined using the method according to the<br>
invention, figure 7 shows measurement curves for a Hansenula<br>
polymorphs wt in 2xYP-medium (Yeast-Peptone) culture with<br>
10g/L glycerin at a temperature of 27°C. The process<br>
parameters that were observed were the relative stray light<br>
intensity (at 620 nm) and the relative NADH fluorescence<br>
(excited at 340 nm, emission at 460 nm) of the culture<br>
throughout the duration of the reaction. The individual<br>
process parameters were recorded using a Y optical waveguide<br>
with a positioning angle of 30° and at a distance of 1 mm<br>
from the microtiterplate bottom. The shaking frequency in<br>
this case corresponded to 995 rpm, and the shaking diameter<br>
(27) was 3 mm. The reaction was carried out using a<br>
conventional 48-well microtiterplate (Greiner Bio-one,<br>
Frickenhausen, Part No.: 677 102) and a filling volume of<br><br>
600 µl. A gas-permeable adhesive film was used as a cover<br>
(Abgene, Hamburg, Part No.: AB-0718), in order to cover the<br>
48-well microtiterplate.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
