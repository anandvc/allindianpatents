				<td>The present invention relates to supported catalysts and in particular to supported catalysts for use in the gas phase (co-) polymerisation of olefins in a fluidised bed reactor.<br>
Processes for the co-polymerisation of olefins in the gas phase are well known in the art. Such processes can be conducted for example by introducing the gaseous monomer and comonomer into a stirred and/or gas fluidised bed comprising polyolefin and a catalyst for the polymerisation.<br>
In the gas fluidised bed polymerisation of olefins, the polymerisation is conducted in a fluidised bed reactor wherein a bed of polymer particles is maintained in a fluidised state by means of an ascending gas stream comprising the gaseous reaction monomer. The start-up of such a polymerisation generally employs a bed of polymer particles similar to the polymer which it is desired to manufacture. During the course of polymerisation, fresh polymer is generated by the catalytic polymerisation of the monomer, and polymer product is withdrawn to maintain the bed at more or less constant volume. An industrially favoured process employs a fluidisation grid to distribute the fluidising gas to the bed, and to act as a support for the bed when the supply of gas is cut off. The polymer produced is generally withdrawn from the reactor via a discharge conduit arranged in the lower portion of the reactor, near the fluidisation grid. The fluidised bed consists in a bed of growing polymer particles. This bed is maintained in a fluidised condition by the continuous upward flow from the base of the reactor of a fluidising gas.<br>
The polymerisation of olefins is an exothermic reaction and it is therefore necessary to provide means to cool the bed to remove the heat of polymerisation. In the<br><br>
absence of such cooling the bed would increase in temperature and, for example, the catalyst becomes inactive or the bed commences to fuse. In the fluidised bed polymerisation of olefms, the preferred method for removing the heat of polymerisation is by supplying to the polymerisation reactor a gas, the fluidising gas, which is at a temperature lower than the desired polymerisation temperature, passing the gas through the fluidised bed to conduct away the heat of polymerisation, removing the gas from the reactor and cooling it by passage through an external heat exchanger, and recycling it to the bed. The temperature of the recycle gas can be adjusted in the heat exchanger to maintain the fluidised bed at the desired polymerisation temperature. In this method of polymerising alpha olefms, the recycle gas generally comprises the monomer and cornonomer olefins, optionally together with, for example, an inert diluent gas such as nitrogen or a gaseous chain transfer agent such as hydrogen. Thus, the recycle gas serves to supply the monomer to the bed, to fluidised-the bed, and to maintain the bed at the desired temperature. Monomers consumed by the polymerisation reaction are normally replaced by adding make up gas or liquid to the polymerisation zone or reaction loop.<br>
It is also well known that fouling in gas phase polymerisation process can be a major problem, and can be caused by non-uniform fluidisation as well as poor heat transfer in the polymerisation process. Catalyst and polymer particles may adhere together or to the walls of the reactor and continue to polymerised, and often fuse together and form chunks, which can be detrimental to a continuous process, particularly a fluidised bed process<br>
The incorporation of antistatic agents in polymerisation catalysts is well known. For example US 5414064 describes the use of Stadis with chromium based catalysts while US 5498581 describes again the use of Stadis with silica supported metallocene â€¢ catalyst systems.<br>
US 6469111 describes the gas phase polymerisation of olefins using a catalyst system containing an antistatic agent based on magnesium oxide or zinc oxide. The oxides are used in a mixture with a supported polymerisation catalyst component. The catalyst systems described therein include supported chromium oxide catalysts and also supported metallocene complexes in particular bis(cyclopentadienyl) metallocene complexes.<br>
More recently WO 02/066524 describes supported catalysts for olefin<br>
polymerisation comprising a combination of a sulfated metal oxide support and an aluminoxane.. The sulphated metal oxide support may be easily prepared by contacting a precursor metal oxide with a material having a SO4 group such as sulphuric acid or ammonium sulphate. Typically the resultant aluminoxane deposited on the sulphated metal oxide is used with an organometallic complex of a Group 4 metal, in particular with metallocene complexes comprising both a cyclopentadienyl ligand and a phosphinimine ligand.<br>
US 6107230 describes catalyst compositions comprising inorganic metal oxides impregnated with metal salts eg. cupric sulfate, metallocenes and organoaluminium compounds. The compositions may be combined together or preferably added separately into the reactor. An important aspect of this disclosure is that traditional activators such as aluminoxanes, borates or magnesium chloride are not required.<br>
We have now found that the incorporation of a transition metal atom into the support material of a supported polymerisation catalyst system may have beneficial effects for activity as well as resulting in decreased static levels on the resultant polymers.<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a supported catalyst system suitable for the polymerisation of olefins comprising<br>
(a)	a transition metal compound,<br>
(b)	an activator comprising<br>
(i)        an aluminoxane or<br>
(ii)       a Group IIIA (CAS Version) metal or metalloid compound, and<br>

halide or polymeric material or mixtures thereof<br>
characterised in that the support material has been pretreated with a source of a transition metal atom.<br>

The support material is preferably treated with a water solution of the required transition metal salt.<br>
The support material may then be further subjected to a heat treatment and/or chemical treatment to reduce the water content or the hydroxyl content of the support material. Typically chemical dehydration agents are reactive metal hydrides, aluminium alkyls and halides. Prior to its use the support material may be subjected to treatment at 100Â°C to 1000Â°C and preferably at 200 to 850Â°C in an inert atmosphere under reduced pressure.<br>
The support material may be further combined with an organometallic compound preferably an organoaluminium compound and most preferably a trialkylaluminium compound in a dilute solvent.<br>

Thus according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the polymerisation of olefin monomers selected from (a) ethylene, (b) propylene (c) mixtures of ethylene and propylene and (d) mixtures of (a), (b) or (c) with one or more other alpha-olefins, said process performed in the presence of a supported catalyst system as hereinbefore described.<br>
The supported systems of the present invention are however most suitable for use in slurry or gas phase processes.<br>
A slurry process typically uses an inert hydrocarbon diluent and temperatures from about 0Â°C up to a temperature just below the temperature at which the resulting polymer becomes substantially soluble in the inert polymerisation medium. Suitable diluents include toluene or alkanes such as hexane, propane or isobutane. Preferred temperatures are from about 30Â°C up to about 200Â°C but preferably from about 60Â°C to 1QOÂ°C. Loop reactors are widely used in slurry polymerisation processes.<br>
Gas phase processes for the polymerisation of olefins, especially for the homopolymerisation and the copolymerisation of ethylene and ct-olefins for example 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene are well known in the art.<br>
Typical operating conditions for the gas phase are from 20Â°C to 100 C and most preferably from 40Â°C to 85Â°C with pressures from subatmospheric to 100 bar.<br>
Particularly preferred gas phase processes are those operating in a fiuidised bed. Examples of such processes are described in EP 89691 and EP 699213 the latter being a particularly preferred process for use with the supported catalysts of the present invention.<br>
Particularly preferred polymerisation processes are those comprising the polymerisation of ethylene or the copolymerisation of ethylene and a-olefms having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
Thus according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the polymerisation of ethylene or the copolymerisation of ethylene and a-olefins having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms, said process performed under polymerisation conditions in the present of a supported catalyst system as hereinbefore described. The preferred a-olefins are 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene and 1-octene.<br>
The supported catalyst systems of the present invention may also be suitable for the preparation of other polymers for example polypropylene, polystyrene, etc.<br>
When used for the polymerisation of olefins in a gas phase process the supported catalyst systems of the present invention may reduce static levels on the resultant polymers thereby preventing the formation of deposits on the reactor walls and reducing fouling in the reactor. This is particularly the case for processes performed in a fluidised bed reactor and in particular for the copolymerisation of ethylene and alpha-olefins.<br>
Thus according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for reducing the static charge on polymers prepared by a gas phase polymerisation of olefins in a fluidised bed reactor wherein said polymerisation is carried out in the presence of a supported catalyst system as hereinbefore described.<br>

Polymerisation data<br>
Gas Phase Polymerizations<br>
The following gas phase examples for the copolymerisation of ethylene and 1-hexene were carried using the above supported catalyst compositions. The gas phase procedure was as follows:<br>
A 2.5 1 double jacketed thermostatic stainless steel autoclave was purged with nitrogen at 70Â°C for at least one hour. 150g of PE pellets previously dried under vacuum at 80Â°C for 12 hours were introduced and the reactor was then purged three times with nitrogen (7 bar to atmospheric pressure). -0.13 g of TEA treated silica (1.5 mmol TEA/g) was added under pressure and allowed to scavenge impurities for at least 15 minutes under agitation. The gas phase was then composed (addition of ethylene, 1-hexene and hydrogen) and a mixture of supported catalyst (~0.1 g) and silica/TEA (-0.1 g) was injected. A constant pressure of ethylene and a constant pressure ratio of ethylene/co-monomer were maintained during the run. The run was terminated by venting the reactor and then purging the reactor 3 times with nitrogen. The PE powder produced during the run was then separated from the PE seed bed by simple sieving. Typical conditions are as follows: Temperature: 70Â°C Ethylene pressure: 6.5 b<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
NB. In all gas phase examples the agitation speed was 100 rev/min. The activities and the product characteristics are shown below<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Electrostatic charges was measured under same conditions using a Vafitec Electrostatic sensor on the polyethylene powder when downloaded from the reactor.<br>
It is clear from the above examples that all the catalysts prepared based on the treated silica supports show improved activities and lower PE statics than the comparative examples.<br>
Example 11<br>
30g of ES70 silica was impregnated in a round bottomed flask with an aqueous solution of iron (ii) D-gluconate dihydrate (2.6g in 15ml water). The resultant mixture was agitated for 30 minutes then introduced into a nitrogen fluidised silica calciner. Under a constant nitrogen flow the mixture was heated to 700Â°C, where upon the temperature was maintained for 5 hours prior to cooling to ambient temperature. A free flowing solid was recovered and used without further modification.<br>
20g of the silica was added to a glass reactor containing about 120 mis hexane and equipped with a stirrer. The slurry was stirred at 250 rpm and heated to 50 C. Dibutyl magnesium (DBM) was then added at an amount of 1 mmol per g. silica and the mixture stirred for 1 hour. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) at an amount 0.44 mmol per g. silica was then added and the mixture stirred for 2 hours. Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) was then added at an amount of 1 mmol per g. silica and the mixture stirred for 1 hour. The catalyst was transferred to round bottomed flask and the volatile components removed under reduced pressure.<br>
Example 12 - Polymerisation<br>
A stirred gas phase autoclave (2.5 L) was used for polymerisation using the<br>
catalyst prepared in example 1 lin the presence of triethylaluminium as cocatalyst. A seed bed was added to the reactor prior to composition of the gas phase and heating to the reaction temperature. Following injection of the catalyst the ethylene pressure was maintained for 60 minutes prior to emptying the reactor. 0.2008 g catalyst was used for the polymerisation, Polymerisation Conditions<br>
