The shank support 32 may be attached to the insole 12 by adhesive, riveting or other suitable means.<br><br>
The insole 12 has first and second faces 34 and 36, respectively. The first face 34<br>
is the under-face, or under-surface, of the insole 12. The second face 36 is the<br>
upper face, or the upper surface, of the insole 12.<br><br>
The first and second pads 18 and 26, the cover 30 and the shank support 32 are provided on the first face 34 of the insole 12<br>
The insole 12 is a single piece of material.<br>
The insole 12 may be made of non-woven textile materials of fibreboard<br>
Figures 6-9 show an embodiment of an item of footwear 100, in the form of a<br>
shoe, incorporating a cushioning device 10. The item of footwear 100 comprises a<br>
footwear upper 102, a cushioning device 10, and an outsole 106 attached to the<br><br>
footwear upper 102. An innersock 103 is provided inside the item of footwear 100 and overlies the insole 12. The use of such an innersock 103 is known in the art.<br><br>
The footwear upper 102 is provided with a lasting margin 104. The lasting margin 104 substantially surrounds the periphery of the cushioning device 10 and is attached to the cushioning device 10.<br><br>
The first and second pads 18 and 26 of the cushioning device 10 and the shank support 32 are provided on the first face 34 of the insole 12 such that the outsole 106 covers the first and second pads 18 and 26, the shank support 32 and the first face 34 of the insole 12.<br><br>
Thus, the first and second pads 18 and 26, the cover 30 and the shank support 32 are provided on the underside of the insole 12 when the cushioning device 10 is incorporated into an item of footwear 100. Accordingly, when incorporated in an item of footwear 100 it is the second face 36 of the insole 12 of the cushioning device 10 which faces a wearer's foot.<br><br>
The first and second pads 18 and 26, the cover 30 and the shank support 32 are embedded in the outsole 106 as shown in Figure 6.<br><br>
A method of making a cushioning device for footwear in accordance with the present invention will now be described.<br>
Insoles 12 may be cut from insole material. The insoles 12 are cut to the required shoe size for a left and right shoe as required.<br>
Markings may then be placed on the insole 12 to indicate the portion to be cut out from the heel region 22 of the insole 12, the location of the region 14 at the<br>
forepart 16 of the insole 12 and the location of the shank support 32 at the mid region 33 of the insole 12.<br><br>
The region 14 at the forepart 16 of the insole 12 is perforated in the required pattern to substantially coincide with the first to fifth metatarsal heads and big toe of a person's foot.<br><br>
The region 14 at the forepart 16 of the insole 12 is then underplayed with the first pad 18 on the first face 34 of the insole 12. The first pad 18 may be adhered to the insole 12, for example, with a pressure sensitive adhesive.<br><br>
The cover 30 is then attached to the forepart 16 to encapsulate the first pad 18 the cover 30 is may be attached using a suitable adhesive, e.g. a hot-melt adhesive.<br><br>
An opening 20 is cut out from the insole 12 at the heel region 22. The insert 24 is then positioned in the opening 22.<br><br>
The second pad 26 is positioned to underlie the insert 24 on the first face 34 of the insole 12. The second pad 26 is attached to the insert 24 and the surrounding portion of the insole 12 by a suitable adhesive, e.g. a hot-melt adhesive.<br><br>
A shank support 32 may be attached to the insole 12. The shank support 12 is attached on the first face 34 or the insole 12. Again, a suitable adhesive or other means of attachment may be used.<br><br>
Having completed manufacture of the cushioning device 10 as hereinabove described, the cushioning device 10 may then be used in the manufacture of an item of footwear 100.<br><br>
An item of footwear 100 may be made providing a footwear upper 102. The footwear upper 102 is positioned over the cushioning device 10.<br><br>
The second face 36 of the insole 12 is provided to face the interior of the item of footwear 100.<br>
The footwear upper 102 has lasting margin 104 which surrounds the periphery of the cushioning device 10.<br><br>
An outsole 106 is then attached to the footwear upper 102, the cushioning device 10 and the lasting margin 104 such that the outsole 106 covers the first and second pads 18 and 26, the cover 30, shank support 32 and the first face 34 of the insole 12.<br><br>
A material, e.g. polyurethane, may be injected and bonded to the lasting margin<br>
104 of the footwear upper 102 and the cushioning device 10 to form the outsole<br>
106 as can be seen in Figures 6 - 9. The surface of the second pad 26 may be<br>
scoured to enhance the bonding of the outsole material thereto.<br><br>
The first and second pads 18 and 26, the cover 30 and the shank support 32 are embedded in the outsole 106 of the footwear 100.<br>
The innersock 103 may be loose and simply inserted into the item of footwear 100<br><br>
to overlie the second face 36 of the insole 12. Alternatively, the innersock 103<br>
may be adhered to the second face 36 of the insole 12 prior to positioning the<br>
footwear upper 102 over the cushioning device 10.<br><br>
The outsole 106 may be attached to the footwear upper 102, the cushioning device 10 and the lasting margin 104 in a manner similar to the attachment of an outsole to the insole and lasting margin in known footwear.<br><br>
The cushioning device 10 of the present invention when incorporated in footwear 100 provides energy absorption to the wearer which reduces the risk of injury caused by high and peak pressures acting on the foot due to impact shock and stress forces. The cushioning device 10 provides energy absorption to the areas of the foot which are most susceptible to high and peak pressures due to impact shock and stress forces. These areas of the foot are at the heel region and forepart of the foot.<br><br>
Shock and energy absorption refer to the ability to absorb compression loads and impact forces.<br><br>
The provision of an insert 24 in the cutout opening 20 and the underlying second pad 26 enables transfer of impact energy from the foot to the energy absorbing material of the insert 24 and the second pad 26.<br>
The region 14 at the forepart 16 of the insole 12 allows the insole 12 to contour to the shape of the first to fifth metatarsal heads and the large toe and also enables transfer of impact energy, or impact force, from the foot to the first pad 18. In particular, providing the region 14 by way of perforations 28 gives flexibility to the region 14 of the insole 12 and is responsive in transferring impact energy, or impact force, from the area of contact, of the outsole 106 with the ground, to the first pad 18. In addition, the perforations 28 reduce the rigidity of the region 14 of the insole 12 and enable the region 14 to conform to the compression which is imparted by the wearer's foot to the insole 12. The perforations 28 provide flexibility at the region 14 but enable the region 14 of the insole 12 to still provide support under the first to fifth metatarsal heads and the big toe of a wearer's foot which is important for enabling the foot to maintain balance.<br><br>
Footwear 100 incorporating a cushioning device 10 also provides improved flexibility and comfort to the wearer.<br><br>
Footwear 100 incorporating the cushioning device 10 of the present invention, having an insert 24 in the heel region 22 and first and second pads 18 and 26 on the under-face of the insole 12, embedded in the outsole 106, provides shock absorption from impact from both directions. That is, firstly, it provides shock absorption from impact caused by the wearer's foot - this is impact in the downward direction. Secondly, it provides shock absorption from impacts with the outsole 106, e.g. when the outsole 106 contacts irregularities in the surface upon which the wearer is walking, - these impacts are in the upward direction.<br>
Modifications and variations such as would be apparent to a skilled addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
Throughout the specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word 'comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
