				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to a device adapted to deliver particles into a target cell or tissue, more particularly to instruments for delivering material into cells using particle-mediated delivery techniques.<br>
Particle-mediated delivery of materials, particularly nucleic acid molecules, into living cells and tissue has emerged as an important tool of plant and animal biotechnology. Transient and long-term expression of genetic material delivered via particle-mediated techniques into target cells has been demonstrated in a wide variety of microorganisms, plants and animals. Successful integration of DNA into germ cells has also been demonstrated using these techniques, and particle-mediated gene delivery instruments have been used to deliver other materials into cells, including pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals such as proteins, peptides and hormones.<br>
As the fundamentals of the technology of particle-mediated delivery have developed, attention has increasingly shifted toward the development of devices that offer the operator the ability to perform the particle-mediated gene delivery in a swift and convenient fashion. It is also desirable for the operation of the delivery device to be efficient and highly replicable.<br>
One particular device, which uses compressed gas to accelerate carrier particles carrying biological materials into target tissue, is described in commonly owned International publication No. WO 95/19799, the disclosure of which is incorpcrated herein by reference.<br>
The distribution or spread of carrier particles delivered from a particle-mediated delivery device, such as the device of WO 95/19799, can be critical in some applications, particularly when biological material is being delivered, for example genetic material.   In applications where germline transformation events are desired, the need to control the delivery pattern of carrier particles is substantially more acute<br><br>
In yet a further embodiment, a particle delivery device is provided which comprises a body with an elongate acceleration passage formed therein. The device includes a source of particles that is arranged adjacent to an inlet for the acceleration passage. A turbulent flow element is arranged upstream from both the acceleration passage and the source of particles, whereby such an element is used to create turbulence in a flow of gas passing therethrough prior to its contact with the source of particles. In one particular aspect of the invention, the turbulent flow element comprises a gas conduit arranged above the source of particles, wherein the gas conduit has stepped portion of increased diameter.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a particle delivery device is provided which comprises a flow constriction element that restricts flow of compressed gas into the device.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device adapted to deliver particles into a target cell or tissue, said device comprising: a body having an elongate acceleration chamber formed therein, said chamber having an inlet and an outlet; a source of compressed gas coupled to the body for delivery of a gas flow into the inlet of the acceleration chamber; and means to isolate a charge of compressed gas in the instrument for each particle delivery operation, such that additional volume of compressed gas from said source of compressed gas is prevented from flowing through the instrument during particle delivery.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following specification, read in light of the accompanying drawings,<br>
Figure 1 is an illustration depicting the general operation of a gas-driven particle delivery device.<br>
Figures 2A-2C are schematic illustrations of the effect of variations in the geometry of the exit nozzle in the device of Figure 1.<br><br><br><br>
