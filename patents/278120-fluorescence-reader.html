				<td>Fluorescence Reader<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved<br>
fluorescence/phosphorescence reader for a sample substrate in an<br>
optical assay arrangement. The invention also relates to the use<br>
of said fluorescence/phosphorescense reader, and to a sample<br>
substrate adapted for said fluorescence reader.<br>
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Analytical and diagnostic determinations can be performed on<br>
liquid samples by means of optical assays based on the detection<br>
of analytes in a sample, such as e.g. nucleic acids, peptides,<br>
proteins, antibodies, hormones, or drugs. One important'<br>
application of optical assays is the field of immunology, in<br>
which the analyte is detected with the aid of a specific<br>
antibody, which is capable of binding to the analyte to form<br>
optically detectable complexes, e.g. by labeling the analyte<br>
with a fluorophore, or by providing a fluorophore-labeled<br>
antibody before the optical detection. The detection of the<br>
fluorophores may be performed by mean's of a fluorescence reader,<br>
which is capable of illuminating the assay support substrate<br>
with an exerting light source and of detecting the fluorescent<br>
light emitted from the fluorophores.<br>
An optical assay involving detection of fluorescent light<br>
emitted from fluorophores is performed by an optical assay<br>
arrangement comprising a sample supporting substrate and a<br>
fluorescence reader. The fluorescence reader comprises a source<br>
and detector for electromagnetic radiation within the optical<br>
wavelength region (i.e. between approximately 4 0 nm and 1 mm),<br>
and suitable optical filters and wave-guiding means. The sample<br>
support comprises a substrate of e.g. a polymeric material<br>
having a high optical transmittance in the wavelength ranges of<br>
me exciting light and of the emitted lighr, and may also have a<br>
high absorbance of other wavelengths. The substrate is provided<br>
 <br>
with one or more reaction site areas, comprising spots and/or<br>
lines of crobe molecules, e.g. of an antibody, providing binding<br>
sites for molecules of the analyte, i.e. the target molecules,<br>
that may be present in a sample. The substrate may further be<br>
provided with a pattern of protruding microstructures forming<br>
e.g. micro pillars or micro posts, which may be arranged to form<br>
a capillary flow path for the sample.<br>
When the sample is brought in contact with the capture molecules<br>
on the support surface, and the fluorescent or phosphorescent<br>
antibody detection conjugate, optically detectable spots or<br>
lines will be formed. Fluorescent or phosphorescent light will.<br>
be emitted when the substrate is illuminated with the exciting<br>
light source of the fluorescence reader, thereby indicating that<br>
a reaction has occurred between the target molecules of the<br>
sample and the probe molecules of "the reaction sites.<br>
Fluorescence and phosphorescence may be defined as the emission<br>
of electromagnetic radiation resulting from absorbed exciting<br>
electromagnetic radiation, the fluorescent light lasting less<br>
than 1 x 10-8 s after the excitation, and phosphorescent light<br>
lasting longer, i.e. is decaying more slowly after the exposure<br>
to the exciting light.<br>
In fluorescence (and phosphorescence), the exciting radiation<br>
normally has a shorter wavelength (i.e. higher energy) than the<br>
emitted radiation, although the reverse may be true for multi-<br>
photon fluorescence. The fluorescent behaviour may be studied in<br>
a sready state or time-resolved, and fluorescence spectroscopv<br>
involves e.g. single- and multi-photon fluorescence, FRET<br>
(fluorescence resonance energy transfer), and fluorescence up-<br>
conversion. In fluorescence assays, the wavelength of the<br>
exciting and the emitted radiation depends on the type of<br>
fluorophore, which may be of an organic or inorganic origin,<br>
e.g. cyanine dyes, fluorescir. dyes or nanocrystals. As an<br>
example, the cormon fluorophore Cy-5TW- (CE Healthcare) is<br>
 <br>
typically excited with 649 nm, and the emitted light is measured<br>
at 670 nm. The difference in wavelength between the excitation<br>
maxima and the emittance maxima is commonly referred to as the<br>
Stokes shift,<br>
In optical assays, the concentration of an analyte in the sample<br>
may be determined by measuring the intensity of emitted<br>
fluorescent or phosphorescent light, by means of the detector<br>
device of a fluorescence reader, thereby enabling quantitative<br>
 measurements. Consequently, the efficiency of the illumination<br>
of a reaction site area with exciting light, as well as the<br>
efficiency of the collection of the emitted fluorescent light,<br>
will have an effect on the performance of the optical assay,<br>
Further, the reaction sites on a substrate surface may be<br>
provided with an array of spots or lines of different probe<br>
molecules, binding different target molecules. Therefore, a<br>
fluorescence reader may be designed to be.capable of determining<br>
the presence of several analytes in a sample, by means of<br>
different fluorophores, or by using space separation of the<br>
probe molecules.<br>
A fluorescence reader can be arranged to perform the detection<br>
of fluorescent emitted light by scanning the reaction site area<br>
or to detect an image of the entire reaction-site area as a two-<br>
dimensional array of pixels. A scanning fluorescence reader<br>
scans the surface of the sample substrate by a relative movement<br>
between the optical means and ths sample substrate, and the<br>
optical means preferably comprises a narrowband exciting light<br>
source, such as a laser, a LED or a white light source provided<br>
with spectral filters, from which the light is focused on each<br>
individual detection site. The emitted fluorescent light from<br>
each detection site is focused on an optical detector, such as<br>
e.g. a photodiode or a PMT (photomultiplisr tube). An imaging<br>
fluorescence reader is capable of detecting a two-dimensional<br>
array of pixels and the optical means comprises an exciting<br>
 <br>
light source for illuminating a large part of the surface area<br>
(or the entire surface area) of the sample substrate, and a<br>
detector capable of detecting emitted light from the entire.<br>
detection site-area simultaneously, e.g. a CCD (Charged-Coupled<br>
Device)-imager, which utilizes MOS (Metal-0n-3emiconductor) -<br>
technology.<br>
A prior art optical reader is described in WO 01/5755 0.1, which<br>
discloses optical imaging of 'an analyte containing sample on a<br>
transparent substrate. The optical reader comprises an exciting<br>
energy source to stimulate emission of detectable light from the<br>
sample, and.the substrate is provided with a reflective surface<br>
located below the sample to reflect the emitted light into the<br>
detection means.<br>
A light detecting optical device is disclosed in WO 99/4 6596,<br>
comprising a light conducting body coupled to a slide, thereby<br>
improving the light collecting efficacy.<br>
WO 03/103835 describes prior art sample substrates provided with<br>
protruding micro posts arranged to form a capillary flow path<br>
for the sample.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide an improved<br>
fluorescence/phosphorescence reader capable of an efficient<br>
illumination of the reaction site area of the substrate and an<br>
efficient collection and detection of the emitted light, thereby<br>
achieving a high performance optical assay arrangement.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The term "fluorescence reader" is defined as a reader capable of<br>
exciting and detecting both fluorescent and phosphorescent<br>
light, and the term "fluorescent light" is defined to<br>
hereinafter refer to both fluorescent and phosphorescent light.<br>
Other terms and expressions used in the description and in the<br>
claims are meant to have the meaning normally used by a person<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
An improved performance is achieved in an optical assay<br>
arrangement comprising a polymeric sample substrate having a<br>
reaction site surface provided with a fluorophoric layer, the<br>
fluorophores forming e.g. lines or spots on the surface, and an<br>
opposing substrate surface, by means of a fluorescence reader<br>
according to the invention. The fluorescence reader comprises an<br>
exciting light source, e.g. a LED positioned to illuminate the<br>
substrate surface, and a detector, e.g. a photodiode, arranged<br>
to detect the fluorescent light emitted from the fluorophoric<br>
layer. The detector is positioned to collect and detect the<br>
emitted fluorescent light transmitted through the substrate<br>
surface, and the light source is arranged to inject exciting<br>
light into the substrate surface.<br>
A light ray impinging on a surface will be specularly reflected<br>
from said surface when the angle of incidence of the light ray<br>
relative the normal to the surface exceeds the critical anale<br>
for total internal reflection, which depends on the relationship<br>
between the refractive index of the material on both sides of<br>
the surface. The refraction of the light ray passing from a<br>
first medium, having the refractive index n1, into a second<br>
medium, with refractive index n2, is defined by the well-known<br>
relationship of Snell's Law:<br>
 <br>
n1 * sin αin. =n2 * sin αrer (1)<br>
αin is the angle to the surface normal of the light ray in the<br>
first medium impinging on the surface between the first and the<br>
second medium, and αref is the angle to the surface normal of the<br>
refracted light ray propagating in the second medium. When<br>
aref = 90 degrees, total internal reflection occurs on the<br>
surface, and sin αraf = 1. From the relationship (1) above, it<br>
follows that:<br>
sin αin = n2/nl * sin αref =&gt; sin αin(TIR) = n2/nl =&gt;<br>
αin(TIR) = sin-1(n2/nl) , where αin(TIR) indicates the critical angle<br>
for total internal reflection.<br>
Thus, total-internal-reflection occurs when nl is larger than n.2<br>
and αin exceeds the critical angle for total internal reflection,<br>
i.. e. αin &gt; αin(TRA)<br>
In a conventional fluorescence reader suitable for a dielectric<br>
substrate provided with a fluorophoric layer, most of the light<br>
emitted from the fluorophoric layer will be directed into the<br>
substrate, and a large portion of this emitted fluorescent light<br>
will impinge on the substrate surface with an angle exceeding<br>
said critical angle for total internal reflection. When a<br>
conventional polymeric substrate is used, with a typical<br>
refractive index between 1.5 and 1.6, total internal reflection<br>
will occur, and a large fraction of the emitted light will be<br>
trapped within the substrate, i.e. undergo multiple total<br>
internal reflections, thereby not reaching the detector.<br>
According to this invention, total-internai-reflection<br>
suppressing means is provided on the substrate surface to<br>
release the trapped fluorescent light from the substrate,<br>
thereby allowing a larger fraction of the emitted fluorescent<br>
light to reach the detector. The total-internal-reflection<br>
suppressing means is configured to diffract or refract the light<br>
ravs, or to remove the difference in redactive index. Thereby,<br>
 <br>
emitted fluorescent light rays having an angle relative the<br>
normal to the substrate surface that exceeds the critical angle<br>
for total internal reflection, will be allowed to escape through<br>
the surface, and reach the detector.<br>
The exciting light rays from a light source propagating in air<br>
and impinging on the surface of the polymeric substrate will be<br>
refracted into the substrate with a direction given by the<br>
relationship (1), from which it-follows that:<br>
sin αref = n1/n2 x sin αin , where αref is the angle between the<br>
refracted light ray within the 'substrate and the surface normal,<br>
and αin, is the angle between the impinging light ray in air and<br>
said surface normal. Consequently, the angle of the refracted<br>
light is limited by the fact that nl/n2 will be approximately<br>
1/1.55 = 0.65, and that αin will be less than 90 degrees,<br>
resulting in that αref 
Figure 1 illustrates schematically a sample substrate 1 for an<br>
optical assay arrangement, the sample substrate having a<br>
reaction site surface 2 and a substrate.surface 3, located-<br>
opposite each other. The reaction site surface of the substrate<br>
may further be provided with a pattern of protruding<br>
microstructures, e.g. micro posts (not illustrated), which may<br>
be arranged to form a capillary flow path for the sample. The<br>
size of the substrate is preferably adapted to form a suitable<br>
carrier for one or more reaction site areas for an ootical<br>
assay, and a prior art microarray slide is rectangular, with a<br>
size of 25 mm x 75 mm. The thickness of the substrate may be<br>
e.g. approximately 1 mm and the width and length e.g. between<br>
approximately 1 mm and 100 mm, forming an approximately<br>
rectangular or quadratic surface ares. The material of the<br>
substrate may be a thermoplastic polymer, e.g. a<br>
cycloolefinpolymer or a cycloolefincopolynter, having suitable<br>
optical properties, e.g. regarding the transparency of the<br>
optical radiation, with an index of refraction typically between<br>
 <br>
1.5 and 1.6. Apolymeric substrate may be manufactured by a<br>
polymer replication of a master structure, e.g. by injection<br>
molding. However, other substrate material may be used, e.g..<br>
glass or silicon, having suitable optical properties.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates schematically the excited electromagnetic<br>
rays emitted from a fluorophore -4 located on the reaction site<br>
surface 2 of a dielectric sample substrate 1. The emission is<br>
asymmetric due to the different optical properties of air and<br>
3 the substrate material, and the intensity of the emitted light<br>
is larger within the substrate than in the air. Since the<br>
substrate has a high transmittance of the wavelengths of the<br>
emitted rays, it is advantageous to detect the excited<br>
fluorescence light from the substrate side.<br>
Figure 3 is a graph schematically illustrating the intensity of<br>
the different emission angles from a thin layer of the<br>
fluorophore Cy-5™, the emission angle defined as the angle to<br>
the surface normal. (However, for a given emission angle, light<br>
will be emitted over 360°.) The graph indicates that the<br>
fluorescence emission is highly anisotropic, with a peak at an<br>
angle of approximately 50 degrees. This is an angle that is<br>
larger than the critical angle for total internal reflection for<br>
the substrate/air interfacing surface, since the critical angle<br>
of total internal reflection for a light ray propagating in a<br>
substrate material with a refractive index of 1.55 and impinging<br>
on the substrate/air interfacing surface is 40 degrees,<br>
according to the relationship (1) above. Therefore, most of the<br>
fluorescence light emitted within the substrate will impinge on<br>
the inner side of the subsrrate surface with an angle exceeding<br>
the critical angle for total internal reflection, and will be<br>
trapped inside the substrate. This light will, consequently, not<br>
reach a detector located outside the substrate surface in a<br>
controlled way. Some of the light trapped inside the substrate<br>
will eventually be refracted out of the substrate at the<br>
 <br>
substrate edges, but this light will normally not reach the<br>
detector. If the reaction site surface is provided with<br>
protruding microstructures these may also affect the optical<br>
conditions for total internal reflection.<br>
However, in a fluorescence reader according to this invention,<br>
the substrate surface is provided with total-internal-reflection<br>
suppressing means in order to release the captured totai-<br>
internal-reflected rays by diffracting or refracting the rays,<br>
or by changing the refractive index-difference between the<br>
substrate material and air. Thereby, the detector device will be<br>
able to collect and detect a larger portion of the emitted<br>
fluorescence light, achieving a more reliable detection and a<br>
higher performance.<br>
Figure 4 is a graph schematically illustrating the excitation<br>
efficiency dependency on the excitation incidence angle, showing<br>
the intensity of the emitted fluorescent light at two different<br>
angles of incidence of the illumination, i.e. 50 degrees and 180<br>
degrees from the surface normal, respectively. The graph<br>
indicates' the intensity at different emission angles in the<br>
interval between 30 and 60 degrees, with the light approaching<br>
the fluorophores from the substrate surface with an incidence<br>
angle of 50 degrees relative the surface normal, and the<br>
intensity at different emission angles with an incidence angle<br>
of 180 degrees, i.e. light approaching the fluorophores in a<br>
direction in parallel with said surface normal. Apparently, the<br>
excitation efficiency is larger at an incidence angle of 50<br>
degrees, i.e. an angle of incidence that substantially coincides<br>
with the emission peak, which is illustrated in figure 3.<br>
According to one embodiment of this invention, en increased<br>
emission efficiency is achieved by selecting the angle of<br>
incidence of the exciting radiation to coincide with the maximum<br>
fluorescence emission angle. This is accomplished by arranging a<br>
light source to direct exciting light rays into a suystrate 1 to<br>
 <br>
illuminate the fluorophoric layer 4 with an angle of incidence<br>
coinciding with the maximum emission angle. However, light rays<br>
impinging on the substrate surface 3 can not refract into the<br>
surface with an angle that is higher than the one given by the<br>
relationship (1) : sin αref = n1/n2 * sin αin. Since αin is less<br>
than 90 degrees, sin αin is less than 1. The air/substrate<br>
surface will typically have a value of nl/n2 being 1/1.55 =<br>
0.65. Therefore, sin αref 
degrees. Since the incidence angle relative the fluorophoric<br>
) layer corresponds to the angle of refraction, the incidence<br>
angle will also be less than 4 0 degrees, which is smaller than<br>
the desired incidence angle of 50 degrees. In order to enlarge<br>
the angle of incidence of the exciting light rays, the<br>
fluorescence reader, according to this embodiment of the<br>
invention, will illuminate the substrate surface 3 through<br>
incidence-angle-controlling means provided on the substrate<br>
surface in the optical path of the impinging exciting light<br>
rays, thereby further increasing the performance by achieving an<br>
enlarged incidence angle relative the surface normal. The<br>
incidence angle controlling means will enlarge the angle of<br>
refraction/ and, accordingly, also the angle of incidence, by<br>
diffracting or refracting the injected light rays, or by<br>
changing the refractive index difference between the substrate<br>
material and air.<br>
Figure 5 schematically illustrates an optical assay arrangement,<br>
comprising a sample substrate provided with a fiuorophoric layer<br>
4 of e.g. Cy-5™ or TransFluoSpheres™ (Invitrogen Corporation).<br>
The fluorescence reader comprises a light source 5 illuminating<br>
the substrate surface 3 and a defector device 6 detecting light<br>
transmitted throucrh said surface 3, the surface normal indicated<br>
by the dashed lir.e, The intensity cf the fluorescent light<br>
emitted from the fluorophoric layer 4 has a peak at the maximum<br>
emission angle 6, which is approximately 50 degrees, relative<br>
the indicated surface normal. Since tnis angl- is larger tnan<br>
 <br>
the critical angle of total internal reflection, which is<br>
approximately 40 degrees, at the inner side of the substrate<br>
surface 3, a large portion of the emitted fluorescent light will<br>
be trapped inside the substrate, therefore not reaching the<br>
detector 6. Thus, the. detected intensity can be increased by<br>
applying total-internal-reflection suppressing means on the<br>
substrate surface, in the path of the emitted light rays,<br>
thereby releasing the trapped light rays from the substrate.<br>
in ordsr to achieve an enhanced emission, the light source 5<br>
should inject exciting light rays into the substrate with an<br>
incidence angle 7, relative the indicated surface" normal,<br>
substantially corresponding to said maximum emission angle 8 of<br>
50 degrees. However, this angle cannot be obtained due to the<br>
refractive index relationship between air and the substrate<br>
material, In order to enlarge the incidence angle and increase<br>
the emission/ incidence-angle-controlling means can be provided<br>
on the substrate surface, in the optical path of the injected<br>
light rays.<br>
In a fluorescence reader according to this invention, total-<br>
internsl-reflection suppressing means are provided on the<br>
substrate surface in the optical path of the emitted fluorescent<br>
light, in order to reduce the total-internal-reflection and<br>
release the trapped emitted light, preferably in the path of the<br>
maximum emission lobe of the emitted light. Additionally, in<br>
order to further increase the fluorescence emission, incidence-<br>
light -controlling means may be provided on the substrate surface<br>
in the path of the exciting light rays, thereby enlarging the<br>
incidente angle of the exciting light inside substrate to<br>
achieve an incidence anqle substantially coinciding with the<br>
maximum emission angle of the fluorescence light.<br>
Figures 5-Ba schematically illustrates embodiments according to<br>
5 first aspect c-f the invention, in which the total internal<br>
reflection suppressing means and the incidence angle controlling<br>
 <br>
means are configured to diffract or refract the light rays in a<br>
desired direction. The total internal reflection suppressing<br>
means and the incidence angle controlling means comprise a<br>
relief structure 9 applied on the substrate surface 3 of the<br>
sample substrate, in the optical path of the emitted fluorescent<br>
light rays and of the exciting light rays. The surface relief<br>
structure is designed to be diftractive or refractive, and may<br>
comprise e.g. a grating or a facet-structure, providing a<br>
surface on which the light rays will diffract or refract into<br>
the desired directions.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a first exemplary embodiment, in which the<br>
total-internal-reflection suppressing means and the incidence-<br>
angle-controlling means comprises a surface relief structure 9,<br>
divided in three sections, of which the first section 11<br>
constitutes the incidence-angle-controlling means comprising an<br>
entry-section forming an inner channel designed to admit<br>
exciting light rays into the substrate with a suitable incidence<br>
angle, and the outer sections 12 constitutes total-internal-<br>
reflection suppressing means forming exit-sections allowing<br>
fluorescence light rays with an angle exceeding the critical<br>
angle for total internal reflection to be transmitted through<br>
the substrate surface. The exit-sections 12 are designed to<br>
release emitted fluorescent light rays having ar. emission angle<br>
both below and above the critical angle for total internal<br>
reflection from the substrate, and the entry-section 11 is<br>
designed to enlarge the incidence angle of the exciting rays<br>
inside the substrate, to exceed the refractive angle given by<br>
the relationship between the refractive indices of air and of<br>
the substrate.<br>
The position of the entry-section and the exit-sections,<br>
respectively, is preferably adapted to the location of the<br>
fluorophores on the reaction sits surface, e.g. by locating the<br>
entry section 11 directly under the fiucroohores. since the<br>
fluorescent light is emitted with a low intersity at small<br>
 <br>
angles of emission 8, and by locating the exit sections 12 to<br>
surround the entry section, especially in the path of the<br>
maximum emission lobe of the fluorescent light.<br>
A further advantage with this invention is that a specific area<br>
of the reaction site area can be analysed by only detecting<br>
emitted fluorescent light from a specific, limited area of the<br>
surface relief structure, or by applying the total-internal<br>
reflection suppressing means to only cover a specific, limited<br>
area of the substrate surface.<br>
The surface reliefs may be produced e.g. by e-beam lithography,,<br>
grating ruling engines, holographic interference methods,<br>
diamond point turning, silicon micromachining etc, and the<br>
relief structure may e.g. be sinusoidal, triangular, or<br>
trapezoidal. The surface relief may be transferred onto a<br>
polymer substrate by replication methods from a master<br>
structure, like injection moulding. The surface reliefs can e.g.<br>
be formed as one- or two-dimensional pattern of facets, which<br>
may be designed to transmit the light rays undeviatsd or to<br>
focus the emitted light onto the detector device.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a facet structure, having the facet angle<br>
a, depth D, and pitch, P, of which the depth and pitch are in<br>
the sub µm-range, up to several hundreds of µm. If a coherent<br>
light source, e.g. a laser, is used, the surface relief will be<br>
of diffractive nature. If a non-coherent light source, e.g. a<br>
LSD, is used, the surface relief will be of refractive nature.<br>
The light rays emitted from the fluorophores will impinge on the<br>
substrate surface with an incidence angle that varies over the<br>
suistrate surface depending on the emission angel and or. the<br>
position relative the fluorophores, e.g. of a line of<br>
fluorophores located directly above an inner channel 11,<br>
illustrated in figure 6. Therefore, according to a further<br>
 <br>
embodiment of the relief structure, the design of the<br>
diffractive or refractive structure is arranged to vary over the<br>
surface of the exit section, in correspondence with the<br>
incidence angle of the impinging emitted light rays, on order to<br>
further improve the total-internal-reflection suppressing<br>
function.<br>
According to a further embodiment of a fluorescence reader, in<br>
which the position of the light source is fixed relative the<br>
substrate, the design of the diffractive or refractive structure<br>
is arranged to vary over the surface of the entry section in<br>
correspondence with the intensity distribution of the exciting<br>
light beam, or in order to achieve focusing of the exciting<br>
light.<br>
Figure 8a is a cross-sectional view of a sample substrate, with<br>
a fluorophoric layer 4 and a substrate surface 3 provided with a<br>
surface relief structure 9, of which one section is functioning<br>
as total internal reflection suppressing means, and another<br>
section is functioning as incidence angle controlling means,<br>
through which exciting light rays and fluorescent emitted light<br>
rays are transmitted, respectively.<br>
Figure 8b illustrates a further embodiment of a fluorescence<br>
reader according to the first aspect, showing the sample<br>
substrate according to figure 8a, further provided with a light<br>
collecting lens 13 positioned to receive the fluorescent light<br>
transmitted through the surface relief 9, in order to increase<br>
the intensity of the emitted light reaching the detector device<br>
(not illustrated) and thereby further improving the performance.<br>
Figure 9 schematically illustrates a fluorescence reader 10,<br>
suitable for an optical assay arrangement comprising a sample<br>
substrate 1 provided with a fiuorophoric layer 4, according to a<br>
second espect of the irvention, in which the total-internal-<br>
reflection suppressing means comprises a light collecting body<br>
 <br>
15 of a suitable material, e.g. a polymeric material or glass.<br>
According to a first embodiment, the light-collecting body 15<br>
has a refractive index that corresponds to, or is larger than,<br>
the refractive index of the substrate material. The light-<br>
collecting body is positioned in physical contact .with the<br>
surface, preferably in optically wetting contact, in order to<br>
""open up" the substrate surface and to allow the fluorescent<br>
light rsys having an emission angle that exceeds the critical<br>
angle for. total internal reflection to escape the substrate and<br>
enter into the body 12. Additionally, the shape of the light-<br>
collecting body will collect and focus the fluorescent light<br>
rays, e.g. by means of total-internal-reflection, on the inner<br>
surface of the body, to reach the detector device 6, mounted on<br>
the light-collecting body. Thus, the illustrated light-<br>
collecting body acts both as a total-internal-reflection<br>
suppressor and as a light collector. Thereby, the intensity of<br>
emitted fluorescent light reaching the detector device 6 will<br>
increase, and the performance of the optical assay arrangement<br>
will be improved.<br>
According to a second embodiment, the light collecting body is<br>
provided with an input port 14 functioning as a light-directing<br>
device, which is arranged to control the direction of the light<br>
rays from the light source to guide the exciting light into the<br>
substrate 1, e.g. to achieve an incidence angle substantially<br>
coinciding with the maximum emission angle of the fluorescent<br>
light. The optical properties of the light-collecting body 15<br>
allows exciting light rays to enter the substrate with an<br>
appropriate incidence angle relative the fiuorophoric layer<br>
provided on the reaction site surface. Tnereby, the fiuorophoric<br>
layer is more favorable excited, and more fluorescent light will<br>
be emitted, thereby further improving the performance of the<br>
optical as say arrangement.<br>
According to further embodiments, the light collecting body 15<br>
is provided with one or more output ports (not illustrated in<br>
 <br>
the figure), arranged to e.g. function as a beam dump for<br>
specularly reflected exciting light rays.<br>
Figure 10 schematically illustrates a fluorescence reader<br>
suitable for an optical assay.arrangement comprising a sample<br>
substrate 1 provided with a fluorophoric layer 4, according to a<br>
third aspect of this invention, in which the total-internal-<br>
reflection suppressing means 16 is configured to change the<br>
refractive index-difference at the surface, by comprising an<br>
optically wetting layer of a suitable material. Since sin αin(TIR)<br>
= n2/n1, as follows from the relationship (1) above, more<br>
fluorescence light can be transmitted through the surface if the<br>
refractive index difference is reduced, such that n2/nl is<br>
increased.<br>
According to a first embodiment, the fluorescence reader<br>
comprises a light source 5, a detector 6 and a lens device 17,<br>
which is positioned to focus emitted, fluorescent light onto the<br>
detector 6. The lens device 17 is provided with total-internal-<br>
reflection suppressing means 16 comprising a layer of a suitable<br>
material, having a suitable refractive, positioned in physical<br>
contact with the substrate surface 3. The material of the layer<br>
is preferably a soft polymer, e.g. silicon, epoxy, polyeruthane<br>
or acrylate, which is applied as an optically wetting layer on<br>
the surface of the lens device 17, with no air between the layer<br>
and the surface. Thereby, the light rays propagating to the lens<br>
will not pass any air layer, which would cause reflection losses<br>
to occur at high angles. An additional advantage with selecting<br>
a soft polymeric material is that it is capable of forming an<br>
optically wetting layer on a surface that is not completely even<br>
or clane. Further, the material of the layer is selected to have<br>
suitable light transmitting properties, e.g. low fluorescence<br>
and low scattering of the transmitted emitted or exciting light<br>
rays, and the thickness of the layer 16 can be between a few µm<br>
and a few mm. A suitable value of the refractive index of the<br>
 <br>
layer is between the values of the refractive index of the<br>
polymeric substrate material and of the lens device,<br>
respectively, the refractive index of the lens device being the<br>
largest. The total-internal-reflecting suppressing optically<br>
wetting layer 16 docked in physical contact with the substrate<br>
surface 3 releases the fluorescence rays from being trapped into<br>
the substrate, and enables a larger portion of the emitted rays<br>
to be collected by the detector 6.<br>
The light source 5 is arranged to illuminate the substrate<br>
surface 3 of the sample substrate 1, and the detector device 6<br>
is arranged to detect fluorescent light emitted from the<br>
fluorophoric layer 4 on the reaction site surface of the sample<br>
substrate and transmitted through the substrate surface 3. The<br>
light source 5 injects exciting light rays into substrate, and<br>
the maximum emission angle of the fluorescent light normally<br>
exceeds the angle for total internal reflection. However, the<br>
optically wetting layer 16 is applied as a total-internal-<br>
reflection suppressing means on the lens device 17 in order to<br>
increase the intensity of the light escaping through the surface<br>
by increasing the angle for total internal reflection.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment, not illustrated in the<br>
figure, the optically wetting layer 16 is applied directly on a<br>
detector device 6, in case the detector device is adapted to<br>
collect the emitted light without any focusing means.<br>
Preferably, the detector device is positioned such that the<br>
Optically wetting layer is docked in physical contact with the<br>
substrate surface 3.<br>
Further, the optically wetting layer 15 mey cover substantially<br>
the entire lens 17 or detector device 6, or, alternatively, a<br>
suitable part of -he surface of the detector 5 or lens 17,<br>
depending on the configuration of the optical assay arrangement.<br>
 <br>
According to an alternative embodiment, not illustrated in the<br>
figure, incidence angle controlling means is applied on the<br>
substrate surface 3, in order to enlarge the incidence angle of<br>
the exciting light rays relative the surface normal by changing<br>
the diffractive-index difference at the surface. Since the<br>
incidence angle corresponds to the angle of refraction, which is<br>
given by the relationship sin αref = n1/n.2 * sin αin, a change in<br>
the refractive index difference will affect the incidence angle.<br>
The incidence angle controlling means, according to this<br>
embodiment, comprises an optically wetting layer of a material,<br>
having a suitable refractive index, applied, on the substrate<br>
surface in the optical path of the injected-exciting light rays.<br>
If the refractive index of the optically "wetting layer is larger<br>
than the refractive index of air, n1/n2 will increase, which<br>
will result in an enlarged αref and an enlarged incidence angle.<br>
The resulting incidence angle may preferably coincide with the<br>
maximum emission angle of the fluorescent, such that more<br>
fluorescent light will be emitted. The optically wetting layer<br>
may, alternatively, be applied on the surface of a light-<br>
directing device (not illustrated in the figure) arranged to<br>
control the direction of the exciting light rays.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention, the total-<br>
internal-reflection suppressing means comprises both a surface<br>
relief structure 9, according to the first aspect of the<br>
invention, as described with reference to figures 6-8, and a<br>
light collecting body 15 according to the second aspect, as<br>
described with reference to figure 9. The light collecting body<br>
is preferably located in close proximity to the substrate<br>
surface, e.g. at a distance less than approximately 1 mm from<br>
the surface. 3y combining a surface relief structure 9 and a<br>
light collecting body 25, an improved suppression of the total-<br>
internai-reflection is achieved, while an improved collection of<br>
the emitted light is provided by means of the light collecting<br>
body.<br>
 <br>
In order to further increase the performance of the optical<br>
assay .arrangement, a fluorescence reader implemented according<br>
to any of the aspects of the invention, as described above, is<br>
provided with suitable filter, e.g. spectral filter and<br>
polarization filters, in order to prevent any exciting light<br>
from reaching the detector. Since a part of the exciting light<br>
rays will be reflected, transmitted through the substrate and<br>
released from the substrate surface to be detected by the<br>
detector device, the detector device is preferably provided by<br>
spectral filters removing the wavelengths of the exciting light<br>
rays. However, the spectrum of the exciting light rays, which<br>
may be light from e.g. a laser diode or a light emitting diode<br>
(LED) , normally has a tail that extends into the wavelength<br>
region of the emitted fluorescent light, which depends on the<br>
type of fluorophores in the fluorophoric layer. Since the<br>
wavelengths of the fluorescent light cannot be removed by<br>
detector 'filters, the exciting light source is preferably<br>
provided with spectral filters removing the tail. Thus,<br>
according to further exemplary embodiments of the fluorescence<br>
reader,.the detector is provided with spectral.filters removing<br>
the wavelengths of the exciting light rays and of any other<br>
unwanted light sources, and the light source is provided with<br>
spectral filters removing the wavelengths coinciding with the<br>
fluorescent light. Therefore, the cut-off frequency of the<br>
detector filtering means has to be adapted to the cut-off<br>
frequency of the light source filtering means, avoiding any<br>
overlap between the wavelength ranges of the exciting light and<br>
the detected light, thereby further improving the efficiency of<br>
the fluorescence reader.<br>
IN ordr to Drevent any exciting light from reaching the<br>
detector, another exemolary embodiment of the fluorescence<br>
geometrical planes for rhe excising light and for the<br>
measurement of the emitted, fluorescent light, e.g. a geometric<br>
 <br>
yz-plans for the excitation and a geometric xz-plane for the<br>
measurement of the emission.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the fluorescence reader,<br>
the exciting light rays can be prevented from reaching the<br>
detector by providing the light source, if needed, and the<br>
detector with polarizing filters. If the sample substrate has a<br>
low birefringence, one exemplary setup would be to align the two<br>
polarizers perpendicularly to each other.. Thereby, only<br>
fluorescent light polarized in parallel with the polarizing<br>
filter of the detector will be detected. Alternatively, if the<br>
birefringence is varying and not negligible, one of the<br>
polarizers has to be rotatable to a suitable angle to remove the<br>
exciting light, thereby achieving a further improved performance<br>
of the fluorescence reader.<br>
Thus, by providing a scanning or an imaging fluorescence reader<br>
with suitable total-internal-reflection suppressing means,<br>
incidence-light controlling means, lenses and light-directing<br>
devices, as well of spectral and/or polarizing filtering, as<br>
described above, a high performance optical assay arrangement<br>
can be achieved.<br>
However, the invention is not restricted to the described<br>
embodiments in the figures, but may be varied freely within the<br>
scope of the appended claims.<br>
