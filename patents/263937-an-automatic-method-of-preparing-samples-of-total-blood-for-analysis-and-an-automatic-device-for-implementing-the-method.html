AN AUTOMATIC METHOD OF PREPARING SAMPLES OF TOTAL BLOOD<br>
FOR ANALYSIS, AND AN AUTOMATIC DEVICE FOR IMPLEMENTING<br>
THE METHOD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of<br>
preparing samples of total blood in order to perform<br>
hematological analyses with the help of one or more<br>
automatic total blood analyzers, and the invention also<br>
relates to an automatic preparation device for<br>
implementing the method.<br>
Amongst other things, the invention seeks to define<br>
a protocol for automatically preparing samples of total<br>
blood for the purpose of improving the reliability of<br>
analyses performed using automatic analyzers, and also to<br>
improve the flexibility with which such analyses can be<br>
implemented with the help of such automatic analyzers.<br>
Blood analyses performed on total blood<br>
(hematological analyses) are performed on tubes of blood<br>
that contain all of the components of blood, unlike<br>
analyses that are performed on blood serum or plasma, as<br>
obtained after coagulating or centrifuging samples of<br>
blood taken from patients.<br>
In order to be carried out properly, such analyses<br>
on total blood require sustained agitation of the tubes<br>
of blood for analysis in order to thoroughly mix all of<br>
the components of the blood such as the platelets and the<br>
red and white corpuscles that are to be counted during<br>
analysis. This agitation stage is essential for ensuring<br>
the quality of the analyses and it must be carried out<br>
very shortly before analysis and in compliance with<br>
criteria that are standardized.<br>
Tubes of blood for analysis are identified by bar<br>
codes giving access to information relating to the<br>
patients and also to the analyses that are to be<br>
performed on the samples of blood contained in the tubes.<br>
These tubes are sorted by category and they are<br>
placed on supports, commonly referred to as racks, that<br><br>
2<br>
are suitable for receiving a plurality of tubes. After<br>
prior agitation they can then be introduced manually and<br>
individually into an automatic analyzer. The tubes can<br>
also be placed in cassettes or racks that are specific to<br>
each analyzer and that have about ten housings in<br>
alignment, in which the tubes are placed and generally<br>
secured manually by an operator, who then places said<br>
cassettes or racks in a loading compartment of the<br>
analyzer.<br>
Said cassettes are then taken in charge<br>
automatically by the analyzer, which then performs the<br>
operations of conveying, agitating the tubes, analyzing<br>
the samples of blood contained in each of the tubes, and<br>
finally storing said cassettes once all of the tubes of<br>
blood placed thereon have been analyzed.<br>
Such automatic analyzers suitable for taking charge<br>
of cassettes or racks carrying a plurality of tubes of<br>
blood for analysis are described in particular in the<br>
following documents : US-A-4 609 017, EP-A-0 726 453, and<br>
EP-A-0 645 006.<br>
The use of such automatic analyzers is nevertheless<br>
not entirely satisfactory. Regardless of the mode of<br>
analysis used, the operator needs to transfer each of the<br>
tubes manually from a rack into the analyzer or a<br>
cassette, and then after analysis the operator needs to<br>
extract the tubes from the analyzer or from said cassette<br>
in order to replace them on racks, so that they can be<br>
conserved for a short period in refrigerators in order to<br>
make it possible to analyze them again, should that be<br>
necessary in order to verify that the results of<br>
particular analyses are exact.<br>
For each tube for analysis, the operator thus needs<br>
to take care to engage the tube of blood properly in the<br>
cassette, to turn it so as to make its bar code label<br>
visible to the reader so that it can be identified, and<br>
to avoid becoming contaminated with the blood.<br><br>
3<br>
Furthermore, when it is appropriate to verify a<br>
first result, it is difficult for the operator to<br>
identify amongst the set of tubes, which tube needs to be<br>
analyzed again. The operator needs to verify each of the<br>
bar code labels on the tubes in order to identify<br>
visually the tube containing the sample that needs to be<br>
verified, and then needs to reintroduce said tube<br>
individually into the analyzer (or else the entire<br>
cassette on which said tube is located), which can be<br>
particularly time consuming and lengthy to perform.<br>
Implementing hematological analyses with the help of<br>
present analyzers thus lacks flexibility.<br>
Automatic systems are also known for feeding tubes<br>
for analysis from a storage zone to an analysis point<br>
where they are taken into charge by one or more<br>
analyzers, as described in document US 5 232 081. That<br>
comprises a system for conveying cassettes filled with<br>
tubes and placed on a rail that transports the cassettes<br>
from one analyzer to another, starting from a storage<br>
compartment, with the cassettes being put into place on<br>
the conveyor rail automatically as a function of the rate<br>
of throughput of the analyzers. Automatic systems of that<br>
type for feeding analyzers with tubes of blood do not<br>
solve the above-defined problems of flexibility in<br>
implementing analyses, even though they do enable them to<br>
be carried out at a faster rate.<br>
In addition, conveying entire cassettes requires a<br>
conveyor system of large dimensions to be built so as to<br>
enable the direction of cassettes to be changed on the<br>
system, on curves of small radius, which makes the use of<br>
such cassette conveyor systems particularly inconvenient<br>
and difficult in laboratories.<br>
Document EP-A-0 344 819 describes a device serving<br>
essentially to store and mix tubes of blood for analysis.<br>
The device makes provision only for agitating the tubes<br>
and not for any other step in preparing samples. Each<br>
tube is placed on an individual support in a storage zone<br><br>
4<br>
and then the tubes are moved in succession one by one by<br>
a mechanism that is very complex and bulky to the<br>
agitator device and to a zone giving access to an<br>
analyzer.<br>
Although automatic, that device suffers from the<br>
same drawbacks as analysis devices using cassettes. It is<br>
necessary for the operators to introduce the tubes one by<br>
one into their supports in the storage compartment. In<br>
addition, its operation does not provide any flexibility<br>
in the order in which tubes are prepared and analyzed.<br>
Better flexibility is obtained by a device of the<br>
kind described in document US 4 927 545. That document<br>
describes a device for automatically treating blood<br>
serum, the device comprising a computerized control unit<br>
driving a 5-axis robot arm that handles tubes of blood<br>
serum between various apparatuses. Nevertheless, that<br>
device is very bulky which makes it unsuitable for use in<br>
laboratories where a very large number of analyses need<br>
to be performed every day and where a large number of<br>
operators work and move about. In addition, the device of<br>
US 4 927 545 is unsuitable for treating samples of total<br>
blood, insofar as it does not enable tubes to be prepared<br>
individually in automatic manner.<br>
Another drawback of existing automatic analyzers and<br>
automated feeder systems lies in the fact that they are<br>
not suitable for coping with emergency situations of the<br>
kind commonly encountered in analysis laboratories. In<br>
such emergency situations, it is essential for an<br>
operator to be able to carry out an analysis on a tube of<br>
blood that is not in the analyzer or on the feed system<br>
of the analyzer, so as to be able to obtain results<br>
immediately. To do this, the operator is obliged to stop<br>
the analyses that are in progress, in order to introduce<br>
the tube for emergency analysis into a cassette ready for<br>
entering the analyzer and taking the place of one of the<br>
tubes to be found therein. Thereafter, once the emergency<br>
analysis has been carried out, the normal analysis<br><br>
5<br>
process that was stopped needs to be restarted. That<br>
likewise represents operations that are constraining and<br>
lengthy for the operator and also leads to untimely<br>
stoppages in the process of routine analyses, thus<br>
interfering with the reliability of the analyses<br>
performed and thus in the accuracy of the results<br>
provided.<br>
The device described in EP-A-0 344 819 is<br>
unsuitable, in particular, for coping with such emergency<br>
situations.<br>
Finally, before beginning to analyze tubes of blood,<br>
operators need every day to perform quality control<br>
operations on analyzers, by analyzing tubes containing<br>
control samples of blood for which the various parameters<br>
have known values with known tolerances relative to said<br>
values, in order to verify that the measurements<br>
performed by the analyzer are exact, and where<br>
appropriate in order to adjust the analyzer in suitable<br>
manner so that it will subsequently perform correct<br>
analyses on unknown samples. With certain national<br>
legislations, it is necessary to perform such quality<br>
control operations several times a day in order to be<br>
certain that the analyzers do not drift out of adjustment<br>
during the day and that the quality of the analyses<br>
remains constant at all times.<br>
Tubes containing control samples of blood need to be<br>
stored in refrigerators while they are not in use, so<br>
that for each quality control operation, operators must<br>
stop the analyzer, then take an appropriate control<br>
sample tube from a refrigerator, verify that the tube is<br>
indeed appropriate for the operation that is to be<br>
performed, and in particular that the blood in the<br>
control sample has not reached its use-by date and has<br>
not already been subjected to too great a number of<br>
analyses. Thereafter, it is necessary to allow the<br>
control sample tube to return to room temperature and<br>
then to perform quality control operations by analyzing<br><br>
6<br>
the control sample in compliance with the standards in<br>
force, and finally, once quality control is finished, the<br>
tubes must be put back into the refrigerator, after which<br>
normal analyses can be restarted.<br>
There also, the operations of performing quality<br>
control on analyzers are particularly lengthy and<br>
laborious for operators to implement, and it can happen<br>
they do not give sufficient care to complying with the<br>
conditions under which tubes of control sample blood need<br>
to be conserved and used.<br>
An object of the present invention is thus to<br>
provide a method of preparing samples of total blood for<br>
analysis that enables an automatic analyzer to be fed<br>
with said samples, while avoiding the drawbacks<br>
associated with using present automatic analyzers.<br>
In particular, the present invention seeks to<br>
provide a method of preparation that enables implementing<br>
hematological analyses to be more flexible, in particular<br>
by making it easier to manage emergency analyses.<br>
An object of the invention is also to propose a<br>
method of preparing analyses, in particular of samples of<br>
total blood, that can solve problems associated with the<br>
operations of performing quality control on analyzers.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a<br>
method that enables the reliability of the analyses that<br>
are performed to be improved, in particular by ensuring<br>
that the tubes containing samples for analysis are<br>
properly conditioned, while also managing in autonomous<br>
manner the stages of performing quality control on the<br>
analyzer and adjusting it accordingly.<br>
The invention also seeks to provide a device that is<br>
dedicated to preparing samples of total blood for<br>
analysis in accordance with the method of the invention.<br>
Thus, in a first aspect, the invention achieves<br>
these objects by a method of preparing samples of total<br>
blood for analysis, said samples being conserved in tubes<br>
including sample-identification means and that are<br><br>
7<br>
preferably hermetically closed by respective plugs, the<br>
method being characterized by the following steps in<br>
succession :<br>
a)	placing a said tube in a storage zone and<br>
identifying it by reading its said identification means<br>
with the help of suitable read means and recording the<br>
information as read in an automatic controller in order<br>
to know the identity of the patient and the type of<br>
analysis to be performed on the blood sample contained in<br>
said tube; and<br>
b)	individually taking and moving each of said tubes<br>
with the help of robotic gripper and displacement means<br>
under the control of said controller, from said storage<br>
zone to at least one zone for preparing the tube and the<br>
sample of blood ; and<br>
c)	preparing said tube and said sample in said<br>
preparation zone in application of a preparation sequence<br>
'that is determined as a function of information read from<br>
on said sample identification means and/or on the basis<br>
of information input into said automatic controller by an<br>
operator, said sequence including at least agitating the<br>
tube so as to mix together the components of the blood<br>
contained therein ; and<br>
d)	immediately after its preparation, individually<br>
moving said tube with the help of said robotic gripper<br>
and displacement means to at least one access zone giving<br>
access to an automatic analyzer of total blood in order<br>
to analyze the blood sample contained in said tube; and<br>
e)	extracting said tube from said analyzer via a<br>
said access zone after analysis and replacing it in said<br>
storage zone with the help of said robotic gripper and<br>
displacement means; and preferably<br>
f)	reiterating operations a) to e) on other samples.<br>
In accordance with a preferred characteristic of the<br>
method of the invention, in step a) said tubes are placed<br>
and held vertically in supports, each comprising a<br>
plurality of individual housings of format suitable for<br><br>
receiving a tube and organized in a plurality of rows of<br>
adjacent housings, said supports being positioned in a<br>
said storage zone suitable for receiving a plurality of<br>
said supports and accessible by said robotic gripper and<br>
displacement means.<br>
In order to ensure that the blood samples are<br>
analyzed under good conditions, it is also appropriate to<br>
ensure that no element disturbs the operations whereby<br>
the automatic analyzer takes blood from the tube. That is<br>
why in step c) is preferable to perform at least one of<br>
the following additional preparation operations :<br>
. causing aeration of the tube ; and<br>
. verifying the level of said sample of blood in<br>
said tube; and<br>
. determining whether any clots exist in the sample<br>
contained in said tube; and<br>
. verifying the depth to which the plug closing<br>
said tube has been engaged.<br>
In addition, in some circumstances it is also<br>
possible in step c) also to bring said sample to<br>
temperature, preferably by heating it.<br>
According to another preferred characteristic of the<br>
method of the invention, in step e), the tubes are sorted<br>
and stored in different ones of said supports with the<br>
help of said robotic gripper and displacement means and<br>
as a function of the results of analyses performed on the<br>
samples contained in said tubes, or as a function of<br>
optimizing space in the racks, or indeed as a function of<br>
additional analyses that are to be performed on said<br>
samples.<br>
In accordance with the national legislation in force<br>
in most countries, it is required to verify the accuracy<br>
of automatic analyzers every day before proceeding with<br>
analyses of unknown blood samples. That is why in<br>
accordance with the invention, prior to preparing and<br>
analyzing said samples of total blood, control samples of<br>
blood are used for performing quality control on the<br><br>
9<br>
analyzer, said control samples being conserved in a<br>
refrigerated zone that is accessible to said robotic<br>
gripper and displacement means, said control samples of<br>
blood being heated and prepared like samples of unknown<br>
total blood, and then introduced into said analyzer, and<br>
they are then automatically recovered and finally<br>
replaced in their starting locations in said refrigerated<br>
zone by said robotic gripper and displacement means.<br>
Where appropriate, in order to satisfy the analysis<br>
standards in force in certain States and/or as applied in<br>
certain laboratories, the analysis of at least one<br>
control sample of blood is prepared periodically after a<br>
determined number of samples of total blood have been<br>
prepared and analyzed in a said analyzer, said control<br>
sample of blood being taken, prepared, delivered to the<br>
analyzer, and then recovered and stored by said robotic<br>
gripper and displacement means.<br>
Thus, advantageously, during a day, spot checks are<br>
performed automatically to verify that the automatic<br>
analyzer used for analyzing blood has not drifted from<br>
its settings and still has sufficient accuracy and<br>
reliability to guarantee that the results of its analyses<br>
are valid.<br>
In accordance with another advantageous<br>
characteristic, the method of the invention includes a<br>
protocol for automatically verifying the validity of the<br>
results of analyses performed by the automatic analyzers.<br>
For this purpose, and according to the invention, the<br>
following steps are performed :<br>
•	taking an average of each of the parameters<br>
analyzed on a series of a determined number of samples of<br>
unknown total blood ; and<br>
•	comparing these mean values of the analyzed<br>
samples with ranges of nominal values for the same<br>
parameters, which nominal values correspond to healthy<br>
patients and are recorded in said automatic controller ;<br>
and<br><br>
10<br>
. if one of said mean values lies outside the range<br>
of nominal values for the corresponding parameter, a<br>
control sample is prepared and the same parameter is<br>
analyzed on the control sample ; and<br>
. if the measured value for the analyzed parameter<br>
on the control sample lies in the range of nominal values<br>
for said parameter, analysis is continued on a new series<br>
of samples of unknown total blood samples; and<br>
. if the value of the parameter analyzed on the<br>
control sample lies outside the range of nominal values<br>
for said parameter, then said analyzer is calibrated<br>
before analyzing a new series of samples of unknown total<br>
blood.<br>
It is thus possible to detect any possible drift in<br>
the settings of the analyzer while performing analyses<br>
and to perform automatic verification (quality control)<br>
without any need for an operator to intervene, or to<br>
detect the presence of samples of pathological blood in a<br>
given series of samples when one or more mean values for<br>
the measured parameters lie outside the corresponding<br>
range(s) of nominal values.<br>
In contrast, when the value of the parameter<br>
measured on the control sample lies outside the range of<br>
nominal values, then it is necessary to calibrate the<br>
analyzer, i.e. to correct the settings thereof, which<br>
calibration can be performed by an operator with the help<br>
of tubes of special calibration blood.<br>
In a second aspect, the invention also provides an<br>
automatic device that is useful in preparing analyses of<br>
total blood samples using the method of the invention.<br>
The device is characterized in that it comprises :<br>
• at least one compartment constituting a said<br>
storage zone for storing said tubes before and after<br>
analysis; and<br>
 at least one said read means for reading said<br>
identification means of said tubes; and<br><br>
11<br>
•	at least one preparation zone for preparing said<br>
blood samples prior to analysis and including means for<br>
verifying and/or treating said tubes containing said<br>
samples, in particular at least one means for agitating<br>
said tubes; and<br>
•	at least one access zone giving access to at least<br>
one automatic analyzer of total blood, said access zone<br>
enabling a said tube to be placed in said analyzer; and<br>
•	robotic gripper and displacement means controlled<br>
by an automatic controller and suitable for taking hold<br>
of and replacing said tubes individually in said storage<br>
zone and for conveying them in at least three orthogonal<br>
XYZ directions between said storage zone, said<br>
preparation zone, and said zone giving access to said<br>
analyzer, said analyzer preferably being connected to<br>
and/or controlled by said automatic controller.<br>
Advantageously, said device includes said supports<br>
having individual housings in which said tubes are placed<br>
by an operator, said supports being positioned in said<br>
storage zone and being manually removable therefrom, said<br>
storage zone being suitable for receiving a plurality of<br>
said supports and being accessible by said robotic<br>
gripper and displacement means to take tubes containing<br>
samples of total blood for analysis therefrom and for<br>
replacing the tubes therein.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the device of the<br>
invention includes an emergency treatment compartment<br>
that is manually accessible to an operator from outside<br>
the device, said emergency treatment compartment also<br>
being accessible to said robotic gripper and displacement<br>
means and including at least one tube support element<br>
having at least one housing suitable for receiving a tube<br>
of blood.<br>
The emergency treatment compartment enables a tube<br>
of blood to be inserted or withdrawn at any moment into<br>
or from the analysis system without it being necessary to<br>
stop the preparation device or the ongoing analyses,<br><br>
12<br>
thereby facilitating preparation and analysis of tubes of<br>
blood for analyzing on a priority basis when said tubes<br>
are not already in the device.<br>
According to a preferred characteristic, said<br>
verification and/or treatment means comprise one or more<br>
of the following :<br>
. at least one device for aerating said tubes;<br>
and/or<br>
. at least one means for detecting the level of<br>
blood in a said tube and the presence of any clots in<br>
said blood; and/or<br>
. at least one means for verifying the level to<br>
which the plugs are engaged in said tubes of blood;<br>
and/or<br>
. at least one means for heating said tubes,<br>
preferably constituted by thermoelectrical cells.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the preparation<br>
device of the invention includes a compartment for<br>
storing and conserving tubes containing control samples<br>
of blood that enable said analyzers to be verified, said<br>
compartment including means for cooling said tubes.<br>
According to another preferred characteristic, said<br>
tubes of control samples are positioned and held in said<br>
conservation compartment in individual housings of a said<br>
support, said cooling means being constituted by<br>
thermoelectric cells (Peltier effect cells) preferably<br>
placed in said housings or on the peripheries thereof.<br>
Integrating a compartment for storing control<br>
samples in the preparation device of the invention makes<br>
it possible advantageously to adapt the process of<br>
preparing tubes and of analyzing blood to the national<br>
regulations and/or internal procedures specific to<br>
analysis laboratories. With this disposition, all quality<br>
control operations, and in particular analyzer<br>
verification operations, can be performed automatically<br>
and rigorously without the operator needing to take<br><br>
13<br>
charge of them in order to guarantee the security of<br>
results.<br>
In accordance with another advantageous<br>
characteristic of the device of the invention, said<br>
robotic gripper and displacement means comprise an<br>
articulated clamp adapted to take hold of said tubes,<br>
preferably under the base of the plug, said clamp being<br>
movable vertically and horizontally in translation along<br>
three orthogonal XYZ axes by means of a transporter<br>
device having at least three guide rails directed along<br>
said XYZ axes and secured together in pairs, comprising a<br>
first rail that is horizontal and stationary, supporting<br>
a second rail that is horizontal and perpendicular to<br>
said first rail and that is movable in translation<br>
thereon, and a third rail that is vertical and secured to<br>
said second rail to be movable in translation thereon and<br>
perpendicularly thereto, said clamp being secured to said<br>
third rail.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the robotic gripper<br>
and displacement means, they include an articulated arm<br>
provided at one of its ends with a gripper clamp for<br>
gripping said tubes of blood, e.g. of the multi-axis<br>
robot type.<br>
To preserve the environment in which tubes of blood<br>
for analysis are handled and prepared together with the<br>
tubes of control samples of blood stored in the<br>
preparation device of the invention, and in order to<br>
protect all of the elements thereof together with the<br>
tubes of blood, in particular from impacts, vibration,<br>
and other external aggression, said preparation device is<br>
confined within a protective enclosure having at least a<br>
first opening giving access to at least one said analyzer<br>
and a second opening giving access to said emergency<br>
treatment compartment. In addition, such a protective<br>
enclosure also improves the safety of operators against<br>
any risk of splashing and/or malfunctioning of the<br>
device.<br><br>
14<br>
To make it easier to make the tubes of blood for<br>
analysis available to the analyzer from said preparation<br>
device, said analyzer access zone(s) advantageously<br>
comprise(s) a respective moving carriage suitable for<br>
moving between said device and a said analyzer, said<br>
carriage being controlled by said automatic controller<br>
and including at least one housing suitable for receiving<br>
a said tube of blood by said gripper and displacement<br>
means.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, said<br>
read means for reading said tube identifier means are<br>
secured to said robotic gripper and displacement means,<br>
and are preferably secured to said clamp.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention,<br>
although controlled and directed directly by an automatic<br>
controller on the basis of an electronic map of the<br>
device as programmed and recorded in said automatic<br>
controller, said robotic gripper and displacement means<br>
also include means for detecting and/or viewing said<br>
tubes containing blood samples and said tubes containing<br>
said control samples of blood in said storage zones, said<br>
preparation zone, said analyzer access zone(s), said<br>
emergency treatment compartment, and said compartment for<br>
storing and conserving tubes containing control samples<br>
of blood.<br>
These detection and/or viewing means advantageously<br>
make it possible to verify the presence of a tube in a<br>
determined location on the tube supports in the storage<br>
zone, in the emergency treatment compartment, or in the<br>
control sample tube conservation compartment, and also<br>
inform the control program when a location is empty so<br>
that it can be taken into account subsequently, or merely<br>
serve to adjust the alignment of the gripper clamp with<br>
the tube in order to ensure that the tube is taken hold<br>
of properly and is displaced properly within the device.<br>
Where appropriate, in order to make it easier to<br>
store samples that have already been analyzed for the<br><br>
15<br>
purpose of subsequent verification analysis, said<br>
supports placed in said storage zone and/or in said<br>
compartment for storing and conserving tubes containing<br>
control samples of blood also include identification<br>
means suitable for being read by appropriate read means.<br>
The preparation device of the invention may also<br>
advantageously be coupled to an automatic analyzer so as<br>
to constitute a complete automatic analyzer system<br>
integrating all of the functions of preparing tubes for<br>
analysis, and of controlling the quality of the analyzer,<br>
said analyzer including means, in particular a needle,<br>
for taking blood from a sample for analysis contained in<br>
a tube that is hermetically closed by a plug and that is<br>
presented thereto from the preparation device via a said<br>
zone giving access thereto.<br>
Other characteristics of the invention appear on<br>
reading the following detailed description made by way of<br>
non-limiting example and with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which :<br>
. Figure 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of the<br>
device of the invention for preparing analyses of samples<br>
of total blood ;<br>
•	Figure 2 shows the Figure 1 device seen from above ;<br>
•	Figure 3 is a fragmentary view of robotic gripper<br>
and displacement means of the device of the invention<br>
associated with means for reading bar codes identifying<br>
samples; and<br>
•	Figure 4 is a diagram of an automatic analysis<br>
device incorporating a device of the invention for<br>
preparing analyses co-operating with two automatic<br>
analyzers of samples of total blood.<br>
With reference initially to Figures 1 and 2, in the<br>
embodiment shown, the device 1 of the invention for<br>
preparing analyses of samples of total blood comprises a<br>
work surface 2 having a plurality of zones defined and<br>
distributed thereon for treating samples of blood<br>
contained in tubes 3, each having identification means 8<br><br>
16<br>
for identifying the sample contained therein, and each<br>
being hermetically closed by a plug 3a. The work surface<br>
2 is covered by a protective and isolating enclosure 4<br>
including openings 4a, 4b, and 4c giving access to<br>
certain zones of the device, and also including an<br>
automatic controller 5 for the device. Said automatic<br>
controller is connected to an input keyboard 5a and to a<br>
touch-sensitive screen 5b enabling an operator to<br>
communicate with the device via a man-machine interface.<br>
In a variant embodiment, a computer that is<br>
auxiliary to the device and that is connected thereto<br>
could constitute said automatic controller in a manner<br>
well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The tubes of blood 3 are to be analyzed by an<br>
automatic analyzer after being prepared for analysis in<br>
the device 1. In known manner, such an automatic analyzer<br>
includes means for taking blood that are suitable for<br>
piercing the plugs 3a of the tubes 3 in order to take<br>
therefrom a quantity of blood that is necessary and<br>
sufficient for the analyses that are to be performed or<br>
for making a smear of blood if the analyzer includes a<br>
slide spreader machine.<br>
The device 1 for preparing analyses combines in a<br>
single common unit all of the means suitable for<br>
preparing tubes 3 of blood before they are introduced<br>
into the analyzer, in order to eliminate all of the time-<br>
consuming manual operations previously performed by<br>
operators for the purpose of preparing and implementing<br>
analyses on total blood, thus leaving them with more time<br>
for performing biological validation of the results.<br>
For this purpose, the preparation device of the<br>
invention comprises on the work surface 2 a compartment<br>
that defines a storage zone 6 for storing tubes of blood<br>
to be analyzed, in which said tubes are placed on<br>
multiple-capacity supports 7 having a plurality of<br>
housings, in practice of the order of 25 to 100 housings<br>
depending on the dimensions of said supports. Said<br><br>
17<br>
housings are of a format and a depth that are adapted to<br>
receiving and holding tubes 3 of blood in a vertical<br>
position. Such supports 7 are traditionally used in<br>
analysis laboratories for having tubes of blood placed<br>
therein and they are known as support racks.<br>
The storage compartment 6 presents capacity that is<br>
variable as a function of the volume of analyses that are<br>
to be performed daily. In the example shown in the<br>
figures, it receives three racks 7, each having a<br>
capacity of about fifty tubes, however for laboratories<br>
of small to medium size, it might receive only one or two<br>
racks 7, or for laboratories of greater size and<br>
activity, or for hospitals, it might receive five or even<br>
more racks.<br>
In order to provide even more modularity and<br>
adaptability, said storage compartment may advantageously<br>
be constituted in a particular embodiment by one or more<br>
drawers (not shown) that are pulled out for loading and<br>
unloading racks in the preparation device 1. The racks 7<br>
also preferably include bonding means or fasteners (not<br>
shown) for engaging the bottom of the storage<br>
compartment, enabling them to be held in place during<br>
operations of manipulating the tubes 3, as described<br>
below.<br>
Depending on circumstances, it is possible to<br>
introduce into the storage compartment 6 racks that are<br>
completely filled with tubes 3 for analysis, racks that<br>
are empty, or indeed racks that are filled in part only.<br>
Thus, when all of the racks 7 are full, each tube 3 is<br>
prepared by the device 1, and then inserted into an<br>
automatic analyzer for analysis, and then put back into<br>
place after the analysis in the storage compartment 7 in<br>
the housing of the rack 7 in which it was stored<br>
initially.<br>
In contrast, if there are both full racks and empty<br>
racks in the storage compartment 6, then it is possible<br>
for the operator to set the device 1 via its said<br><br>
18<br>
automatic controller 5 so that it takes tubes 3 from the<br>
full racks 7 and, after analysis, replaces them in the<br>
empty racks 7, either in random manner or after sorting<br>
them and grouping them together as a function of the<br>
results of the analyses on different racks that can<br>
subsequently be identified by an operator.<br>
Finally, if racks 7 that are partially filled with<br>
tubes are reintroduced into the storage compartment, then<br>
at the request of the operator, the device enables the<br>
storage of the tubes in the racks to be optimized by<br>
grouping together tubes 3 at the end of analysis on a<br>
minimum number of racks, so as to economize on the number<br>
of racks used for storing tubes of blood, and<br>
consequently economize on the room occupied in the<br>
refrigerators where the tubes are stored for a day or two<br>
after being analyzed.<br>
Advantageously, said racks are fitted with<br>
identification means 8a such as a radiofrequency<br>
identification marker, a magnetic label or strip, or a<br>
bar code, enabling information relating to the tubes 3<br>
placed in the racks 7 to be read and/or written. The<br>
tubes 3 and the racks 7 identified in this way can be<br>
more easily recovered in the event of a request for a new<br>
analysis. The information can advantageously be read and<br>
recorded by a suitable reader 9a, such as a<br>
radiofrequency transponder or a bar code reader, that is<br>
movable within the storage compartment 6 in register with<br>
said identification means and that is connected to the<br>
automatic controller 5.<br>
Similarly, each of the tubes 3 of blood likewise has<br>
identification means 8 for identifying the blood sample<br>
it contains. Said identification means may be constituted<br>
by a bar code or by a radiofrequency marker RFID), for<br>
example, and it is read by means of a suitable reader 9<br>
as soon as tubes have been placed in the storage<br>
compartment. This makes it possible to determine the<br>
position of each of the tubes in the storage compartment<br><br>
19<br>
6, and also makes it possible automatically to make a<br>
list of the tubes present in the device and of the<br>
analyses to which they are going to be subjected, thereby<br>
determining how each of the tubes should be prepared.<br>
Although bar codes are traditionally used in the<br>
field of analyzing blood as in many other domains,<br>
radiofrequency identification (RFID) is a technique that<br>
is particularly suitable for storing and recovering data<br>
relating to blood samples. The markers used may in<br>
particular be adhesive labels 8, 8a that can be stuck on<br>
or incorporated in the tubes, and that can be read and<br>
updated automatically by the reader 9, 9a each time the<br>
tubes are taken into charge.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the reader 9 for<br>
reading the identification means 8 of the tubes, and the<br>
reader 9a for reading the identification means 8a. of the<br>
racks 7 may be contiguous with each other on a common<br>
read device as shown in Figure 3, thus enabling the<br>
identification means 8 of a tube gripped by the clamp 27<br>
and the identification means 8a of the rack 7 from which<br>
the tube 3 was taken to be read simultaneously.<br>
In order to prepare blood samples contained in the<br>
tubes 3, the device 1 also includes a preparation zone or<br>
pre-analysis module 10. Additionally, it also includes a<br>
compartment 11 for conserving tubes 19 having control<br>
samples of blood, an emergency treatment compartment 12<br>
communicating with the outside of the device through an<br>
opening 4c in the enclosure 4 of the device, and at least<br>
one access compartment or zone 13a, 13b giving access to<br>
an automatic analyzer, whereby the tubes of blood for<br>
analysis or the tubes of control samples are made<br>
available to the analyzer via two openings 4a, 4b in the<br>
enclosure 4 after being prepared for having blood taken<br>
therefrom and analyzed.<br>
The disposition of the various zones, modules, or<br>
compartments of the device on the work surface 2 can be<br>
varied. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to take care to<br><br>
20<br>
retain a certain degree of proximity between the storage<br>
compartment 6, the pre-analysis module 10, and the<br>
analyzer access zones 13, 13b giving access to the<br>
analyzer, so that the time required for transferring<br>
tubes 3 of blood between these elements is minimized,<br>
thereby guaranteeing the reliability and the<br>
effectiveness with which samples are prepared for<br>
analysis and of the analyses performed subsequently<br>
thereon.<br>
The pre-analysis module 10 has a plurality of<br>
preparation and/or treatment means for acting on the<br>
samples of blood for analysis under the control of said<br>
automatic controller 5 and used for carrying out<br>
automatically a sample preparation sequence that is<br>
determined as a function of the information read on said<br>
identification means 8 of the tubes 3 and/or of<br>
information input into said automatic controller by the<br>
operator in charge of analyzing said samples.<br>
During this preparation sequence, operations are<br>
performed of verifying and conditioning samples and/or<br>
tubes 3 containing them, and in particular agitation of<br>
the tubes prior to analysis. It is essential to agitate<br>
samples of total blood before any analysis in order to<br>
ensure that all of the blood cells are in suspension<br>
before being taken by the analyzer.<br>
To this end, the pre-analysis module includes an<br>
agitator 14, preferably a rotary agitator, comprising<br>
three agitation wheels, each having a housing into which<br>
a tube for agitating can be inserted and all mounted on a<br>
common rotary shaft, thus enabling three tubes of blood<br>
to be agitated simultaneously in the example of Figures 1<br>
and 2.<br>
The wheels of the agitator may or not be coupled in<br>
rotation, thus making it possible to dissociate rotation<br>
of each wheel in the agitator and thereby increase the<br>
throughput of the device by enabling tubes of blood to be<br><br>
21<br>
put into place and taken from a wheel without<br>
interrupting agitation of the other wheels.<br>
Nevertheless, it is also possible to perform<br>
agitation by partially overturning the tubes or by<br>
performing Vortex type agitation with the help of means<br>
suitable for turning the tube about its own axis, these<br>
modes and means for performing agitation being well known<br>
to the person skilled in the art in the field of<br>
analyzing blood. Similarly, the number of agitation<br>
housings may be selected, like the capacity of the<br>
storage compartment, as a function of the rate at which<br>
analyses are to be performed.<br>
The pre-analysis module also includes a device 15<br>
for aerating said tubes, comprising a needle for piercing<br>
the plug of the tube so as to eliminate any residual<br>
pressure or suction in the tube so as to enable the<br>
analyzer to take blood properly from the tube.<br>
In addition, it is also advantageous to associate<br>
the agitator 14 and the tube aerator device 15 with a<br>
device 16 for detecting the level of blood in the tubes<br>
and the presence of any clots in the blood, such as an<br>
optical detector provided with means for transmitting and<br>
receiving light rays, for example. Preferably, the pre-<br>
analysis module also includes a device 17 for monitoring<br>
the depth to which plugs have been engaged into the<br>
tubes, and where appropriate a device 18 for heating said<br>
tubes 3 in order to raise certain samples to an analysis<br>
temperature that is appropriate for certain blood<br>
pathologies, or when said blood samples have been<br>
extracted from the refrigerator. Advantageously, the<br>
heater means are preferably constituted by thermoelectric<br>
cells, e.g. Peltier effect cells, that can thus serve to<br>
heat or to cool said samples, depending on the electrical<br>
polarity with which they are powered.<br>
The preparation device 1 in accordance with another<br>
advantageous characteristic thereof also includes a<br>
compartment 11 for storing and conserving tubes 19<br><br>
22<br>
containing control samples of blood, i.e. tubes of blood<br>
that are used daily for verifying automatic analyzers of<br>
total blood, said compartment including means for cooling<br>
said tubes. In this compartment 11, which is preferably<br>
isolated unlike that which is shown in the figures for<br>
reasons of clarity, said tubes 19 containing control<br>
samples of blood are positioned and maintained in<br>
individual housings of a metal support 20 fitted with<br>
thermoelectric cells (Peltier effect cells) in said<br>
housings or at the peripheries thereof in order to keep<br>
the tubes 19 of control samples of blood cold, thereby<br>
ensuring that they are properly conserved over time.<br>
Finally, the preparation device includes a zone or<br>
compartment 12 for emergency treatment that can be<br>
accessed by an operator from outside the device through<br>
an opening 4c in the enclosure of the device 1 without it<br>
being necessary to stop the preparation and analysis of<br>
the samples of total blood contained in the storage<br>
compartment 6.<br>
This emergency treatment compartment 12 is for<br>
managing all situations involving emergency analyses or<br>
unconventional analyses that normally disturb proper<br>
operation of analyzers. This applies, for example, to<br>
tubes fitted with plugs that cannot be pierced by the<br>
needle of the analyzer, which need to be opened before<br>
being made available to the analyzer, or indeed to tubes<br>
of a smaller format, as are commonly used for taking<br>
blood samples from children, and that require an adapter<br>
so as to enable them subsequently to be inserted into the<br>
automatic analyzer.<br>
A small-capacity rack 21, having a maximum of about<br>
ten housings 22, is placed in said emergency treatment<br>
compartment 12 to receive one or more tubes 23 placed<br>
directly by hand by the operator in said housings 22 of<br>
the rack 21 so that the preparation device takes charge<br>
of them individually and on a priority basis over the<br>
tubes 3 of blood stored in the storage compartment 6.<br><br>
23<br>
The housings 22 can also serve to make available to<br>
the operator a tube 3 of blood that was previously placed<br>
in the storage compartment 6 and without interrupting the<br>
automatic analysis system. The operator can thus very<br>
easily and without danger recover a specific tube, e.g.<br>
for the purpose of performing additional analyses<br>
thereon.<br>
In order to handle the tubes of blood placed on the<br>
support 7 in the storage compartment 6 or in the rack 21<br>
of the emergency treatment compartment 12, and in order<br>
subsequently to move them individually inside the device<br>
towards the preparation and verification means of the<br>
pre-analysis module and then to an analyzer via an<br>
analyzer access zone, said device advantageously includes<br>
robotic gripper and displacement means 24, 25, 26, and 27<br>
controlled by said automatic controller 5.<br>
These means comprise in particular a hinged clamp 27<br>
adapted to grip said tubes 3, 19, 23, preferably under .<br>
the base of the plug, said clamp 27 being movable<br>
vertically and horizontally in translation by a<br>
transporter device comprising at least three motor-driven<br>
guide rails 24, 25, 26 running along three orthogonal<br>
axes X, Y, and Z, and connected together in pairs: a<br>
stationary horizontal first rail 24 extending all along<br>
the long dimension of the work surface 2 and supporting a<br>
second rail 25 that is likewise horizontal and that is<br>
perpendicular to said first rail 24. The second rail 25<br>
is movable in translation on said first rail in the<br>
directions of double-headed arrow Fl, and a vertical<br>
third rail 26 is secured to said second rail 25 and is<br>
movable in horizontal translation in directions of<br>
double-headed arrow F2 thereon and also in vertical<br>
translation in the directions of double-headed arrow F3<br>
perpendicularly thereto, said clamp 27 being secured to<br>
said third rail 26.<br>
In a preferred variant embodiment shown in detail in<br>
Figure 3, said clamp 27 is mounted to rotate on said<br><br>
24<br>
third rail 26 so as to be capable of pivoting about a<br>
vertical axis parallel to the Z axis. In this<br>
configuration, the clamp 27 can grip a tube 3 and enable<br>
it to turn about its own axis, which is particularly<br>
advantageous in order to read the individual<br>
identification means 8 (a bar code in the figures) of<br>
each tube placed in the racks 7, 21 of the storage<br>
compartment 6 or of the emergency treatment compartment<br>
12 by using a reader 9 that is associated with said<br>
rotary clamp 27, as shown in Figure 3. Rotating the tube<br>
makes it possible guickly to find a zone of the<br>
identification means that is not masked by the jaws of<br>
the clamp 27 so as to read the data and record it in the<br>
automatic controller without it being necessary to move<br>
the tube along the transporter rails to a stationary<br>
reader in a determined position within the device. This<br>
achieves a significant saving in time during the stage of<br>
initiating preparation of blood samples for analysis.<br>
The operation of the preparation device 1 of the<br>
invention is described below, the device being associated<br>
for this example with an automatic analyzer 28 identified<br>
by a side wall in Figure 1, said analyzer 28 being<br>
connected to the automatic controller 5 of the<br>
preparation device 1 and being suitable for communicating<br>
therewith a network module (not shown).<br>
After a stage of switching on the analyzer 28 and<br>
the preparation device 1, which takes place in the<br>
morning before beginning analyses, and during which<br>
mechanical and electronic checks are performed on the<br>
instrument, together with rinsing and priming liquids and<br>
analysis reagents, the automatic controller 5 is used to<br>
launch a verification stage, also referred to as a<br>
"quality control" stage that is mandatory and that is<br>
carried out completely automatically and independently by<br>
the preparation device.<br>
As mentioned above, the tubes 19 containing control<br>
samples of blood are conserved in the conservation<br><br>
25<br>
compartment 11 of the preparation device 1. This presents<br>
the advantage that the selection of tubes containing<br>
control samples of blood and the rules for monitoring and<br>
validating that can be set by the user in order to comply<br>
the legislation in force in each country or as a function<br>
of the laboratory, with this being handled by the<br>
preparation device. Automating these tasks makes it<br>
possible to comply strictly with the conditions of use<br>
that apply to control samples of blood. These conditions<br>
relate mainly to the use-by date, storage conditions, the<br>
maximum number of times blood can be taken from a tube<br>
that has already been used, and conditions relating to<br>
raising temperature and to agitation.<br>
During this quality control stage, the robotic clamp<br>
27	selects the tube 19 containing a control sample of<br>
blood for analysis from the conservation compartment 11<br>
of the preparation device, and places it in the heater<br>
device 18 in order to accelerate its temperature rise,<br>
and then in the agitator 14 in order to homogenize the<br>
blood contained in the tube. Where appropriate, it is<br>
possible to use heating agitators in order to take<br>
advantage of the agitation stage for accelerating the<br>
heating of the tubes containing control samples of blood.<br>
The tube 19 containing a control sample is<br>
subsequently placed by the robotic clamp 27 in a carriage<br>
29b in the access zone 13b for its introduction into the<br>
analyzer 28 where it is analyzed.<br>
Once the tube 19 containing the control sample has<br>
been analyzed it is subsequently taken from the analyzer<br>
28	to the preparation device 1 by the carriage 29b, and<br>
is then returned to its starting location in the<br>
conservation compartment 11 by the robotic clamp 27.<br>
To ensure that the verification is performed on an<br>
appropriate control sample tube 19, for which the use-by<br>
date and the number of prior analyses have not been<br>
exceeded, the identification means 8 of the control<br>
sample tube 19 are read while the tube is being held by<br><br>
26<br>
the robotic clamp 27 in order to detect any accidental<br>
interchange of control sample tubes 19 in the<br>
conservation compartment 11.<br>
The results are subsequently displayed on the<br>
monitor screen 5b of the automatic controller 5 and<br>
recorded and archived therein. This makes it possible to<br>
verify automatically the results of analyzing control<br>
samples, and if these results lie outside tolerance<br>
limits, then it is possible to proceed with a new<br>
analysis on the same control sample tube or on a new tube<br>
available in the refrigeration conservation compartment,<br>
and to continue to do so until correct results are<br>
obtained.<br>
After quality control validation, it is possible to<br>
proceed with processing the tubes 3 of total blood for<br>
analysis. These tubes are placed in racks 7 that have<br>
been installed by the operator directly in the storage<br>
compartment 6 of the preparation device.<br>
Once the racks 7 have been loaded into the device 1,<br>
the operator launches the process of analyzing the<br>
samples from the automatic controller 5. Initially, the<br>
clamp 27 takes hold of a tube 3 of blood for analysis in<br>
a rack 7 in the storage compartment 6, extracts it from<br>
its housing, reads the bar code or radiofrequency marker<br>
constituting its identification means 8, and transmits<br>
the position of the tube in the rack 7 to the automatic<br>
controller 5.<br>
Thereafter, the clamp 27 moves the tube 3 from the<br>
storage compartment 6 to the pre-analysis module 10 where<br>
preparation of the sample begins. The robotic clamp 27<br>
begins by taking the tube 3 to the tube aerator device<br>
15, and then the robotic clamp takes the tube to the<br>
optical detector 16 to verify the level of blood in the<br>
tube and the possible presence of clots. If the<br>
verification is good, then the tube 3 is subsequently<br>
taken by the robotic clamp 27 to the station 17 for<br>
verifying the depth to which the plug is engaged into the<br><br>
27<br>
tube. If that is correct, the clamp then places the tube<br>
in the agitator 14 so as to enable it to be subjected to<br>
a sustained stage of agitation performed in compliance<br>
with the recommendations of the National Committee on<br>
Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS).<br>
Once the agitation has been completed, and if there<br>
is no need to heat the blood prior to analysis, the clamp<br>
27 then extracts the tube of blood for analysis from the<br>
agitator 14 and takes it to an analyzer access zone 13a,<br>
13b where it places the tube 3 in a transporter carriage<br>
29a, 29b fitted with a support suitable for holding the<br>
tube in a position suitable for its entry into the<br>
analyzer and for enabling a sufficient quantity of blood<br>
to be taken therefrom for analysis. Once the tube has<br>
been placed in the carriage, it penetrates into the<br>
analyzer through the opening formed for this purpose in<br>
the walls separating the enclosure of the preparation<br>
device from the analyzer so as to be taken to the station<br>
in the analyzer where blood is taken to analyze the<br>
sample contained in the tube.<br>
Once blood has been taken from the tube by the<br>
analyzer, the carriage then returns to its starting<br>
position in the access compartment of the preparation<br>
device in which the robot clamp 27 again takes hold of<br>
the tube and transports it to its starting location in a<br>
rack 7 in the storage compartment.<br>
Depending on selections made by the operator, it is<br>
also possible to program the robot clamp 27 so that the<br>
tubes of total blood are not replaced in their starting<br>
positions after being analyzes, but are taken to another<br>
rack 7 that is initially empty in the storage compartment<br>
6 of the preparation device, or indeed the tubes can be<br>
sorted as a function of the result of the analysis<br>
performed so as to occupy a variety of previously empty<br>
racks provided for this purpose in the storage<br>
compartment. The tube sorting function is advantageous in<br>
particular in that it enables all of the tubes that<br><br>
28<br>
require additional analyses to be grouped together on a<br>
single common rack 7 so as to avoid any need for the<br>
operator to perform a manual sorting operation.<br>
For reasons to do with the rate at which analyzes<br>
are to be performed in the laboratory, the operations of<br>
preparing samples, in particular the agitation thereof,<br>
are preferably performed simultaneously on a plurality of<br>
tubes as shown in Figure 1. The automatic controller 5<br>
manages the various movements of the tubes by the robotic<br>
clamp 27 so as to optimize the duration of agitation and<br>
the waiting time which must be minimum between the end of<br>
agitation and analysis.<br>
Still for the purpose of improving the rate of<br>
analysis throughput, it is advantageous for the carriages<br>
that transport tubes for analysis to have a plurality of<br>
housings so as to receive a plurality of tubes for<br>
analysis prior to penetrating into the analyzer, so as to<br>
anticipate loading of the tubes for analysis a little and<br>
allow the robot time to recover the tube returned by the<br>
analyzer.<br>
In particular, there is no urgency in recovering an<br>
analyzed tube for the purpose of putting it back into<br>
place. The rack can thus contain the tube for analysis<br>
together with one or more tubes that have already been<br>
analyzed. This disposition helps optimize the movements<br>
of the clamp and to maintain a high rate of throughput.<br>
The preparation device of the invention also makes<br>
it possible to handle circumstances in which an operator<br>
needs to perform emergency analyses on tubes 3 of blood<br>
that are presented in the storage compartment 6 of the<br>
device 1 or on tubes 23 coming from outside and that<br>
which were not expected for analysis. This situation is<br>
very common, but difficult to manage in a laboratory that<br>
is highly automated in which it is necessary to interrupt<br>
ongoing analyses in order to pass through the tube(s)<br>
that are considered to be urgent.<br><br>
29<br>
Using the robotic clamp 27 fitted with an<br>
identification reader 9 as shown in Figure 3, it is<br>
particularly easy and quick to find a tube 3 placed in<br>
the storage compartment 6 and to process it as a priority<br>
and in complete safety without slowing down the rate of<br>
throughput of the device and without requiring manual<br>
intervention by the operator.<br>
Similarly, if the tube 23 for emergency analysis is<br>
not in the storage compartment of the device, the<br>
operator can place it in the rack 21 in the emergency<br>
treatment compartment 12, and can use the keypad 5a or<br>
the touch-sensitive screen 5b of the automatic controller<br>
5 to program the robotic clamp 27 to take charge of this<br>
tube on a priority basis over the tubes situated in the<br>
storage compartment 6 so as to perform the analysis<br>
urgently on said tubes without breaking the automatic<br>
nature of the analysis system.<br>
Thus, the emergency treatment compartment 12 gives<br>
privileged access for an operator to perform any<br>
exceptional or non-automatible operations, and also to<br>
recover a tube 3 that is present inside the device, which<br>
the robotic clamp can easily find and place in the rack<br>
21 in the emergency treatment compartment 12.<br>
The preparation device 1 of the invention also<br>
enables the installation in analysis laboratories to be<br>
made highly modular in combination with different<br>
categories of automatic analyzers conventionally used in<br>
such laboratories.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, it is thus possible to couple<br>
the device 1 of the invention with two analyzers 28 and<br>
30. In an application dedicated to hematology, the<br>
analyzer 28 is preferably a cell counter, while the<br>
analyzer 30 is preferably an automatic machine for making<br>
blood smears and specifically for dying the cells of the<br>
smear so as to facilitate subsequent observation using a<br>
microscope.<br><br>
30<br>
In this configuration, the device 1 interposed<br>
between the analyzers 28 and 30 serves to position the<br>
tube 3 for analysis in the carriage 29b of the access<br>
zone 13b of the analyzer 28 and the tube 3 for providing<br>
a blood smear in the carriage 29a of the access zone 13a<br>
of the machine 30.<br>
Since a request for a blood smear is usually<br>
associated with the result from the analyzer, it can be<br>
seen that this configuration makes it possible to wait<br>
for the result from the analyzer before deciding to<br>
return the tube 3 to its position in a rack 7 or to place<br>
it in the carriage 29a for making a smear. Depending on<br>
the duration of the analysis and on the availability of<br>
the preparation device 1, it might be necessary to mix<br>
the blood by positioning the tube 3 on one of the wheels<br>
of the agitator 14 prior to placing it on the carriage<br>
29a of the machine 30.<br>
Other combinations are possible, and in particular<br>
it is possible to couple an analyzer with a different<br>
automatic machine that performs analyses on total blood<br>
useful in diagnosing a pathology, such as C-reactive<br>
protein (CRP) assay, or measuring sedimentation rate.<br><br>
