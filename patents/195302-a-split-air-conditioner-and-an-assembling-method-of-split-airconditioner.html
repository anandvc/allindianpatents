				<td>SEPARATE TYPE AIR CONDITIONER AND ASSEMBLING METHOD OF INDOOR UNIT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a split ai conditioner consisting of an indoor unit and an outdoor unit separate from each other.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
An example of a conventional air conditioner is shown in Japanese Laid-open Patent No. 5-164355. A conventional separate type air conditioner is described below while referring to the drawings. A perspective view showing the constitution of an indoor unit of the conventional separate type air conditioner is shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, an indoor unit main body 21 includes a wind circuit unit 22 and an air stream control unit 23. The wind circuit unit 22 has a refrigeration cycle unit such as heat exchanger, a blowing fan and others. An electrical unit 24 is installed separately from the indoor unit main body 21. The electrical unit 24 is connected electrically to the indoor unit main body 21 through a connection unit 25 exposed ontside. In such conventional separate type air conditioner, the indoor unit main body 21 and electrical<br>
1A<br><br>
unit 24 are mutually connected electrically through the connection unit 25 exposed outside. Accordingly, such conventional air conditioner is poor in outlook and appearance as the merchandise on the whole. Moreover, since the indoor unit main body 21 and electrical unit 24 are formed separately as independent parts through the connection unit 25, it takes time and labor to install the merchandise. Further, since additional members are necessary for mounting the indoor unit main body 21 and electrical unit 24, the number of steps for mounting and number of parts are increased.<br>
It is hence an object of the invention to present an indoor unit of an air conditioner having such effects as excellent appearance, small number of parts, enhanced ease of disassembling, excellent working efficiency in mounting, and excellent working efficiency in repair service.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A separate type air conditioner of the invention comprises (a) an outdoor unit, and (b) an indoor unit including a wind circuit unit having an air suction port, an air stream control unit having an air diffuser, and an electrical unit having an electric control device, in which at least one unit of the wind circuit unit, the air stream control unit, and the electrical unit is formed separably.<br>
2<br><br>
and the one unit and the remaining units of the plurality of units are mutually assembled integrally to form the indoor unit.<br>
An assembling method of split  air conditioner of the invention comprises (a) a step of assembling an outdoor unit, and (b) a step of assembling an indoor unit consisting of the plurality of units, that is. a wind circuit unit having an air suction port, an air stream unit having an air diffuser, and an electrical unit having an electric control device, in which the indoor unit assembling step includes (1) a step of independently forming one of the wind circuit unit, the air stream control unit, and the electrical unit, (2) a step of forming other unit of the plurality of units, and (3) a step of assembling the indoor unit by mutually assembling integrally the one unit and the other unit.<br>
In this constitution, it is possible to obtain an indoor unit of an air conditioner having such effects as excellent appearance, small number of parts, enhanced ease of disassembling, excellent working efficiency in mounting, and excellent working efficiency  in repair service. Moreover, without sacrificing the outlook of the merchandise on the whole, these excellent effects are obtained. In model changeover, by modifying the individual units of the wind circuit unit, air stream control unit and<br>
3<br><br>
electrical unit according to the purpose, restyling is easier. Hence, expenses for making dies for producing the units are saved, so that the manufacturing cost is reduced.<br>

the remaining units of the plurality of units are mutually<br>
assembled integrally to form the outdoor unit. The indoor<br>
unit composed of the wind circuit unit, air stream control<br>
unit, and electrical unit possesses a front surface having<br>
a continuous pattern. In this constitution, it is possible<br>
to obtain an indoor unit of an air conditioner having such<br>
effects as excellent appearance,  small number of parts,<br>
enhanced  ease  of  disassembling,    excellent  working<br>
efficiency in mounting, and excellent working efficiency in<br>
repair  service.  Moreover,    In  model  changeover,  by<br>
modifying the individual units of the wind circuit unit,<br>
air stream control unit and electrical unit according to<br>
the purpose,  restyling is easier.  Hence,  expenses for<br>
making dies for producing the units are saved, so that the<br>
manufacturing cost is reduced.<br></td>
