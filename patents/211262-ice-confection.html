HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166 Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br>
WO 00/53026	PCT/EP00/01757<br>
ICE CONFECTION<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to novel ice confections. In particular the invention relates to novel ice confections containing an antifreeze protein.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
It is highly desirable to be able to manufacture ice confections having novel shapes, properties and/or textures. Until now, however the ability to provide such a high degree of novelty and interest to the products has been limited. In particular products have to be manufactured with the ability<br>
to survive packaging/ storage and distribution.<br><br>
We have now shown that inclusion of specific antifreeze proteins into selected ice confections results in the formation of a strong, close-packed continuous network of ice crystals within the ice confection. As a result the ice confection is provided with specific defined mechanical properties. Such ice confections have novel textures and/or properties. The novel features can be retained during packaging, storage and distribution.<br>
WO 98/04146 {Unilever) discloses that AFPs can be incorporated into frozen food products such as ice confections to provide desirable product properties providing that the product and processing conditions are varied such that the ice crystals provided in the product have an  aspect ratio of more, than 1.9, preferably from 1.9 to 3.0. The specific examples given are all aerated ice<br>
2<br><br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
cream compositions. As shown by comparative Examples A to C below, the addition of antifreeze proteins to aerated ice cream does not significantly change the mechanical properties of the ice cream. WO 98/04146 does not teach that 5  it is possible to provide specific ice confection products having novel mechanical properties.<br>
WO 96/39878 (The Pillsbury Company) discloses a method for making a frozen composition for storage, the method not 10  requiring a hardening step prior to storage. The frozen composition contains an antifreeze protein, in particular Type I AFP. Examples show the preparation of an aerated ice cream and an aerated frozen yogurt. As shown by comparative Examples A to C below, the addition of antifreeze proteins   15  to aerated ice cream does not significantly change the<br>
mechanical properties of the ice cream. WO 96/39878 does not teach that it is possible to provide specific ice confection products having novel mechanical properties.<br>
20  OS 5 118 792 (Warren et al) discloses the addition of fusion proteins, and in particular the fusion protein protein A-Saf5 into foods which are to be consumed frozen, for example, ice cream, frozen yogurt, ice milk, sherbet, popsicles and frozen whipped cream. No examples are given<br>
25  where a final ice confection product is provided containing such fusion proteins. It is shown in Example 3B that when a popsicle formulation is used within the "splat assay", growth of the ice crystals is restricted.<br>
1 30  Surprisingly we have now found that the addition of specific antifreeze proteins to defined ice confections, for example<br>
3<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
to water ices, ice milks, and unaerated ice cream, results in the formation of a strong, close-packed continuous network of ice crystals within the ice confection providing significant, advantageous changes to the mechanical 5  properties of the ice confection.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly the invention provides an ice confection<br>
comprising an antifreeze protein, wherein • 10  A modulus/original modulus &gt; 0.4,  and/or<br>
A strength/original strength &gt; 0.4, providing that when<br>
A modulus/original modulus  50MPa, and/or<br>
when A strength/original strength 
A strength &gt; 0.2MPa. 15<br>
Preferably A modulus/original modulus &gt; 0.4; providing that<br>
when A modulus /original modulus  90MPa.<br>
Most preferably A modulus/original modulus &gt; 1.0; providing<br>
that when A modulus/original modulus  20  lOOMPa.<br>
Preferably A strength/original strength &gt;  0.7.  Most preferably A strength/original strength &gt; 1.5.<br>
25  By modulus is meant the apparent elastic modulus (E) as<br>
determined using a four point bend test. Example 1 gives the standard procedure for performing a four point bend test.<br>
4<br><br>
WO00/53026	PCT/EP00/01757<br>
Therefore A modulus (AE) means the change in modulus between two ice confections whose formulation and process of manufacture are identical in all respects except that the first ice confection includes in its composition an 5  antifreeze protein, and the second ice confection has no antifreeze protein included in its composition (the control composition) . Original modulus (Eorig) is the modulus measured in the control composition.<br>
10  By strength is meant the flexure strength (Ou ) which can be defined as the maximum stress that a material can withstand, under the particular conditions. The flexure strength is given by the stress at a point of maximum force on the force versus displacement curve recorded during a four point bend<br>
15  test.<br>
Therefore strength   means the change in strength between two ice confections whose formulation and process of manufacture are identical in all respects except that the<br>
20  first ice confection includes in its composition an<br>
antifreeze protein, and the second ice confection has no antifreeze protein included in its composition (the control composition) . Original strength (Ou orig) is the modulus measured in the control composition.<br>
25<br>
In addition to changes in the apparent elastic modulus and flexure strength, an increase in product hardness is provided by the ice confections according to the invention. For ice confections frozen with agitation, for example in an<br>
30  ice cream freezer (such as a scraped surface heat<br>
5<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
exchanger), the increase in hardness can be measured using the Vickers hardness test- Details of the Vickers hardness test are given in Example 3.<br>
5  The degree to which the Vickers Hardness (HV)   of the ice confection is increased by the addition of the antifreeze protein depends in part on the ice content of the ice confection.<br>
10  However, generally  0.3, providing that when<br><br>
Preferably  providing that when<br><br>
15<br>
Most preferably either <br><br>
Where AHV is the change in Vickers Hardness between two ice 20  confections whose formulation and process of manufacture are identical in ail respects except that the first ice confection includes in its composition an antifreeze protein, and the second ice confection has no antifreeze protein included in its composition (the control 25  composition) . Hv orig   is the original Vickers Hardness measured in the control composition.<br>
By close-pack.ed contiimo-us network of ice crystals is meant that any given ice crystal is connected to at least one 30  other ice crystal.<br>
6<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
In unaerated ice confections which have been frozen with<br>
agitation, the degree of network formation can be measured<br>
	as contiguity. Contiguity is defined as the ratio of the<br>
- 5  particle to particle interface area divided by the total interface area. It is thus a measure of the degree of network formation of the particle phase. Example 4 shows a method for the measurement of contiguity.<br>
10  Unaerated ice confections according to the invention have a    contiguity of at least 0.2, as measured, by the test given in     Example 4, for an ice content of from 50-90%, preferably 54-85% by weight, when measured at -18°C.<br>
15  In unaerated ice confections which have been frozen by any means, the degree of network formation can be measured as<br>
    the Euler-Poincare characteristic of the ice phase. The<br>
Euler-Poincare characteristic is a measure of the degree of network formation of a particular phase. The lower and more<br>
20  negative the value of the Euler-Poincare characteristic, the greater the continuity of the phase in question. Example 5 shows a method for the measurement of the Euler-Poincare characteristic.<br>
25  Unaerated ice confections according to the invention have an ice phase Euler-Poincare characteristic of less than -150mm-2 as measured by the test given in Example 5 for an ice content of from 50-90%, preferably 54-85% by weight when measured at -18°C-<br>

WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
By antifreeze protein (AFP) is meant a protein which has significant ice recrystallisation inhibition properties as measured in accordance with Example 2.  The AFP provides an ice particle size upon recrystallisation of less than 20um, 5  more preferred from 5 to 15um.<br>
Preferably the ice confection comprises at least 0.0005% by weight antifreeze protein, more preferably 0.0025% by weight antifreeze protein. Typically the ice confection will 10  comprise from 0.0005% by weight to 0.005% by weight antifreeze protein.<br>
For some applications it may be advantageous to include a mixture of two or more different AFPs into the food product.<br>
15<br>
The AFP for use in products of the invention can be any AFP suitable for use in food products. Examples of suitable sources of AFP are for example given in the article "Antifreeze proteins and their potential use in frozen food<br>
20  products", Marylin Griffith and K. Vanya Ewart,<br>
Biotechnology Advances, vol 13, pp375-402, 1995  and in patent applications WO 98/04699, WO 9.8/04146, WO 98/04147, WO 98/04148 and WO 98/22591.<br>
25  The AFPs can be obtained from their sources by any suitable process, for example the isolation processes as described in the above mentioned documents.<br>
One possible source of AFP materials is fish. Examples of 30  fish AFP materials are antifreeze glycoproteins {AFGP) (for example obtainable from Atlantic cod, Greenland cod and<br>
8<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/017J<br><br>
Tomcod), Type I AFP (for example obtainable" from Winter flounder, Yellowtail flounder, Shorthorn sculpin and Grubby sculpin), Type II AFP (for example obtainable from Sea raven, Smelt and Atlantic herring) and Type III AFP (for example obtainable from Ocean Pout, Atlantic wolffish. Radiated shanny, Rock gunnel and Laval"s. eelpout). A preferred example of the latter type is described in WO 97/02343.<br>
Another possible source of AFP material are invertebrates. Also AFPs may be obtained from Bacteria.<br>
A third possible source of AFP material are plants. Examples of plants containing AFPs are garlic-mustard, blue wood aster, spring oat, winter cress, winter canola, Brussels sprout, carrot, Dutchman"s breeches, spurge, daylily, winter barley, Virginia waterleaf, narrow-leaved plantain, plantain, speargrass, Kentucky bluegrass, Eastern cottonwood, white oak, winter rye, bittersweet nightshade, potato, chickweed, dandelion, spring and winter wheat, triticale, periwinkle, violet and grass.<br>
Both natural occurring species may be used or species which have been obtained through genetic modification. For example micro-organisms or plants may be genetically modified to express AFPs and the AFPs may then be used in accordance to the present invention.<br>
Genetic manipulation  techniques may be used to produce AFPs. Genetic manipulation techniques may be used to produce AFPs having at least 80%, more preferred more than 95%, most<br>
9<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
preferred 100% homology to the AFPs directly obtained from the natural sources. For the purpose of the invention these AFPs possessing this high level of homology are also embraced within the term "AFPs". 5<br>
The genetic manipulation techniques may be used as follows: An appropriate host cell or organism would be transformed by a gene construct that contains the desired polypeptide. The nucleotide sequence coding for the polypeptide can be<br>
10  inserted into a suitable expression vector encoding the<br>
necessary elements for transcription and translation and in such a manner that they will be expressed under appropriate conditions (for example in proper orientation and correct reading frame and with appropriate targeting and expression<br>
15  sequences). The methods required to construct these<br>
expression vectors are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
A number of expression systems may be utilised to express 20  the polypeptide coding sequence. These include, but are not limited to, bacteria, yeast insect cell systems, plant cell culture systems and plants all transformed with the appropriate expression vectors.<br>
25  A wide variety of plants and plant cell systems can be<br>
transformed with the nucleic acid constructs of the desired polypeptides. Preferred embodiments would include, but are not limited to, maize, tomato, tobacco, carrots, strawberries, rape seed and sugar beet.<br>
30<br>
10<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCI7EP00/01757<br><br>
For some natural sources the AFPs  may consist of a mixture of two or more different AFPs.<br>
Preferably the antifreeze protein is chosen such that it 5  gives an aspect ratio of more than 1.9 to the ice crystal, preferably from 1.9 to 3.0, more preferably from 2.0 to 2.9, even more preferred from 2.1 and 2.8 (see WO 98/04146). In particular antifreeze proteins which provide an aspect ratio of more than 1.9 to the ice crystal are the preferred AFP 10  for addition to aerated ice confections. Aspect ratio is<br>
defined as the maximum diameter of a particle divided by its minimum diameter. The aspect ratio can be determined by any suitable method. A preferred method is illustrated in the Examples (Example 6).<br>
For the purpose of the invention the preferred AFPs are derived from fish. Especially preferred is the use of fish proteins of the type III, most preferred HPLC 12 as described in our case WO 97/02343. In particular AFP type 20  III HPLC 12 is the preferred AFP for addition to aerated ice confections.<br>
Ice confections which show the required change in mechanical properties on the addition of the antifreeze protein include<br>
25 unaerated milk containing frozen confections such as ice-cream, frozen yoghurt, and frozen custard, aerated and unaerated sherbet and milk ice, as well as aerated and unaerated frozen confections which do not typically contain milk such as water ices, sorbet, granitas and frozen fruit<br>
30  purees.<br>
11<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
Preferably the ice confection is selected from an unaerated ice cream, an unaerated or aerated water ice and an unaerated or aerated milk ice.<br>
5 Most preferably the ice confection is selected from an unaerated water ice, an aerated water ice or unaerated milk ice.<br>
By water ice is meant a frozen solution made essentially 10  from sugar, water,  fruit acid or other acidifying agent, colour, fruit or fruit flavouring.<br>
By unaerated is meant an ice confection having an overrun of less than 25% (equivalent to 0.2 volume fraction of air),<br>
15 preferably less than 10%(equivalent to 0.09 volume fraction of air). During the processing of the ice confection no deliberate steps such as whipping are undertaken to increase the gas content of the product. However, it should be realised that during normal methods for the preparation of<br>
20 non-aerated ice confections, low levels of gas or air may be incorporated into the product, for example due to the mixing conditions used.<br>
Ice confections having an antifreeze protein included in<br>
25  their composition, such that the mechanical properties of<br>
the ice confection are changed as defined, can provide many<br>
new interesting products having different shapes, textures<br>
and properties.<br>
12<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
The ice confection containing the antifreeze protein may constitute the entire product or may be a component of a composite product.<br>
5 An example of a product which may be manufactured using ice confections having an antifreeze protein included in their composition, such that the mechanical properties of the ice confection are changed as defined, are shaped products which have a high degree of definition.<br>
10<br>
There is an increasing demand, particularly in children"s ice confections, to be able to provide products having complex shapes such as cartoon characters and the like, however to date such products cannot be produced having a<br>
15  high degree of definition. Further small protruding features such as hands or beaks are liable to break off during manufacture, packaging, storage or transportation.<br>
An example of what is meant by "high degree of definition" would be a product having protrusions which are typically greater than 3mm in length and may be as long as 5 cm or more, whilst having a thickness of only 1 to 5 mm. Such protrusions would not normally be able to withstand standard manufacture packaging, storage and transportation processes.<br>
We are now able to provide such shaped products by the use of an ice confection having the mechanical properties as defined above.<br>
30 The ice confection will typically have an ice content of at least 30% by volume when measured at -18°C, more preferably<br>
13<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
at  least  40%  by  volume  when  measured  at  -18°C,  most preferably at least 50% by volume when  measured at -18°C.<br>
The ice content may be determined following the techniques 5  described in the article by B de Cindio and S Correra in the Journal of Food Engineering, Volume 24, pages 405-415, 1995. The enthalpy data required for this technique is obtained using adiabatic calorimetry (Holometrix Adiabatic Calorimeter) .  The ice contents as expressed herein are<br>
10  measured on an 80g sample poured into the sample holder of the calorimeter and cooled to -75°C by placing the assembly in dry ice prior to placing in the calorimeter (precooled to between -70°C and -80°C) .  The enthalpy data obtained was analysed to give ice content as a function of the<br>
15  temperature following the method of Cindio and Carrera.<br>
In general the ice confection has a total soluble solids<br>
content of less than 40% by weight, preferably less than 25%<br>
by weight, most preferably less than 15% by weight.  For low<br>
20  calorie products the total soluble solids content may be as<br>
 	low as, for example, approximately 5% by weight.<br>
The total soluble solids content is measured at 4 °C and is the % by weight of the total composition that is dissolved 25  at that temperature.<br>
It has further been observed that products according to the invention retain their structural integrity for longer when held at ambient temperatures.<br>

Examples<br>
10<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by means of the following examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
15<br>
Four point bend test<br>
The standard four point bend test can be used to determine a number of mechanical properties of ice  confection materials. 20  The mechanical properties being measured are Young"s modulus (apparent) and flexure strength.<br>
In a bend test, a test piece is deformed whilst measuring the applied force and test piece deflection. A schematic 25  data set for an ice confection is shown in Figure 1. The" apparent elastic modulus is determined by the gradient of the initial linear part of this curve.<br>
The 4-point bend test requires production of a parallel 30  sided rectangular bar of ice confection material. This may be obtained by any suitable means.<br>
17<br><br>
VO 00/53026<br><br>
PCI7EP00/01757<br><br>
In  this  particular  application  the  parallel  sided rectangular bar of ice confection was made using aluminium moulds producing bars having the dimensions 25 x 25 x 200 5  mm.<br>
a)   Quiescent frozen ice confections<br>
The liquid ice confection pre-mix was poured into a mould<br>
10  which had been pre-cooled in a blast freezer at -35°C for at<br>
least 30 minutes, the mould was. then placed in a blast<br>
freezer at -35°C for at least 2 hours. The samples were then<br>
de-moulded and stored at -25°C until testing  (conducted<br>
after 5-6 days). 18 to 24 hours prior to testing the samples<br>
15  were equilibrated by storing at -18 °C, the temperature at<br>
which all tests were performed. A minimum of 10 bars was<br>
tested for each sample set and the mean value of each sample<br>
set was recorded as the value of the mechanical property<br>
being measured.<br>

The general test applied to all types of solids is described in "Biomechanics Materials.  A practical Approach" Ed. J.F.V. Vincent, Pub. IRL Press, Oxford University Press, Walton Street, Oxford, 1992 and "Handbook of Plastics Test 5  materials" Ed. R.P. Brown, Pub. George Godwin Limited, The Builder  Group, 1-3 Pemberton Row,  Fleet Street,, London, 1981.  Testing involves placing, each bar onto 2 supports and bending it until fracture by applying pressure from two upper supports, that are separated by 85mm, centrally on the 10  bar"s top surface.  The force applied in bending and the displacement of the moving contact is recorded throughout the test. The speed of descent of the moving support was 50mm per minute.<br>
The apparent elastic modulus of the material is given by the 15  equation;<br>
E = (0.21) .gradient.S3<br>
BD3 where the gradient is that shown in Figure 1, S is the span 20  (distance) between the supporting contacts beneath the test bar, B  is the width of the bar and D  is the depth of the bar.<br>
For these tests the span (5) was 170mm. 25<br>
With reference to Figure 1, the strength of a material under three point bend conditions, is -given as;<br>

Method of determining whether an AFP possesses ice recrystallisation inhibition properties.<br>
Recrystallisation inhibition properties can measured using a<br>
10  modified "splat assay" (Knight et al, 1988). 2.5 pl of the solution under investigation in 30% (w/w) sucrose is transferred onto a clean, appropriately labelled,. 16 mm circular coverslip. A second coverslip is placed on top of the drop of solution and the sandwich pressed together<br>
15  between finger and thumb. The sandwich is dropped into a bath of hexane held at -80°C in a box of dry ice. When all sandwiches have been prepared, sandwiches are transferred from the -80°C hexane bath to the viewing -chamber containing hexane held at -6°C using forceps pre-cooled in the dry ice.<br>
20  Upon transfer to -6°C, sandwiches can be seen to change from a transparent to an opaque appearance. Images are recorded by video camera and grabbed into an image analysis system (LUCIA, Nikon) using a 20x objective. Images of each splat are recorded at time = 0 and again after 60 minutes. The<br>
25  size of the ice-crystals in both assays is compared by<br>
placing the slides within a temperature controlled cryostat cabinet (Bright Instrument Co Ltd, Huntington, UK). Images of the samples are transferred to a Quantimet 520 MC image analysis system (Leica, Cambridge UK) by means of a Sony<br>
30  monochrome CCD videocamera. Ice crystal sizing was performed by hand-drawing around ice-crystal. At least 400 crystals<br>
20<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
were sized for each sample. The ice crystal size was taken as being the longest dimension of the 2D projection of each crystal. The average crystal size was determined as the number average of the individual crystal sizes. If the size 5  at 30-60 minutes is similar or only moderately (less than 10%) increased compared to the size at t=o, and/or the crystal size is less than 20 micrometer, preferably from 5 to 15 micrometer this is an indication of good ice recrystallisation inhibition properties 10<br>
Example 3<br>
Standard Vickers Hardness test.<br>
The Vickers Hardness test is an indentation test that involves pushing a pyramid shaped indentor into the surface of material and recording the force applied as a function of tip displacement. Force and displacement are measured during the indentation loading cycle and the unloading cycle.<br>
The  test  is	described  in  "Handbook  of  Plastics  Test<br>
materials" Ed.	R.P. Brown, Pub. George Godwin Limited, The<br>
Builder Group, 1-3 Pemberton Row, Fleet Street, London, 1981.<br>
The Vickers pyramid geometry is an engineering industry standard (BSi 427, 1990) . It has an apex an-gle at the tip of 136°. Hardness is determined as;<br>
30 <br>
21<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
where Hv is the Vickers Hardness, Fmax is the maximum applied force (see figure 2) and A is the projected area of the indentation left in the material"s surface. The area A is 5 determined by assuming the indentation has the same geometry as the indentor that formed it, i.e. a Vickers pyramid, and therefore the projected area can be determined from the indent depth given by d±  in figure 2.<br>
10 A = 24.5d2<br>
The Vickers Hardness of a material is a measure of the material"s resistance to plastic deformation.<br>
The test samples were 500ml blocks, manufactured by extruding the ice confection (typically at a temperature of from -1°C to -5°C) from a scraped surface heat exchanger into standard 500ml packets and then placing the packets into a blast freezer at -35°C for two hours prior to storage at -25°C. Prior to testing the . samples were equilibrated overnight at the required test temperature of -18°C.<br>
Measurements were conducted on a universal testing machine made by Instron (code 4500), within a temperature controlled 25 cabinet at -18°C. The crosshead speed was 2.0mm/min. The maximum load was 95N. The pyramid tip pushed into the surface of the material to a depth of 1.5mm for a water ice and 2.5mra for an ice cream.<br>

Measurement of Contiguity<br>
Contiguity is measured using microstructural images of the ice confection using cryogenic Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Structures are imaged using the technique described in "A low temperature scanning electron microscopy study of ice cream. I. Techniques an general microstructure" Food Structure Vol. 11 (1992), pp 1-9.<br>
In a particulate composite, the Contiguity of the particulate phase is defined as the ratio of the particle to particle interface area divided by the total internal interface area. It is a measure of the degree of network formation of the particulate phase. In ice confections the particles are ice crystals within the matrix and thus contiguity of the ice is defined as;<br><br>
where Cii is the contiguity, Aii is the total interfacial surface area of ice-ice interfaces and Aim is the interfacial surface area of ice-matrix interfaces. Contiguity can be measured from microstructural images of random planar surfaces cut through the material. Cryo-SEM images of flat fracture surfaces of unaerated ice confection are sufficient for this.<br>
23<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
By placing an array of lines on the image of the microstructure, the number of intercepts of these lines with ice-ice and ice-matrix interfaces are counted and combined in the following equation, to give the contiguity; 5<br><br>
where Nii = number per unit length of ice-ice intercepts and Nim  = number per unit length of ice-matrix intercepts. 10<br>
Ideally, approximately 800 interfaces were counted from a total of 5 images that are representative of each sample"s structure.<br>
15  To determine contiguity, two sets of measurements were taken from each image. After placing a regular set of lines onto the image, the number of intercepts of the ice-matrix and ice-ice interfaces with these lines were counted, only including all obvious ice-ice interfaces. The count was then<br>
20  repeated, but this time with all possible ice-ice interfaces included. As such, a maximum ice contiguity measurement and a minimum ice contiguity measurement was made for each image. The mean of these figures is then taken as the contiguity value.<br>

Measurement of Euler-Poincare characteristic<br>
5  The Euler-Poincare characteristic is measured using<br>
microstructural images of the ice confection using cryogenic Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).  Structures are imaged using the technique described in "A low temperature scanning electron microscopy study of ice cream. I. Techniques on 10  general microstructure" Food Structure Vol. II (1992), pp 1-9.<br>
In a two-phase composite structure, the degree of continuity of one phase can be measured using the Euler-Poincare<br>
15  characteristic.  The lower value of the Euler-Poincare<br>
characteristic for a phase, the more continuous or connected that phase is within the microstructure.  The Euler-Poincare characteristic can be a positive or negative number.  The definition of the Euler-Poincare characteristic is given in<br>
20  "Unbiased estimation of the Euler-Poincare characteristic" . by B.P. Pinnamaneni, C. Lantuejoul, J.P. Hernot and J.L. Chermant, Acta Sterelogica, 1989, 8/2, pl€l-106.<br>
To measure the Euler-Poincare characteristic for ice in ice 25  confections, identification of the ice and,matrix phases on the microstructural images was performed and using an image analysis system, the ice phase Euler-Poincare characteristic was determined using a specifically written analysis program.  Whenever contrast in the images was insufficient 30  for the image analysis system to automatically distinguish<br>
ice and matrix separately, the interface between the two was<br>
25<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
identified manually, thus enabling accurate determination of the Euler-Poincare characteristic.<br>
The Euler-Poincare characteristic can be measured for ice in 5  an ice confection produced by any processing route.<br>

Aspect Ratio Measurement<br>
10<br>
Samples were equilibrated at -18°C in a Prolan environmental cabinet for approximately 12 hours. Microscopic slides were prepared by smearing a thin layer of ice confection from the centre of thin glass plates.<br>
15<br>
Each slide was transferred to a temperature controlled microscopic stage (at -18°C) where images of ice crystals (about 400 individual ice crystals) were collected and relayed through a video camera to an image storage and<br>
20  analysis system.<br>
The stored ice crystal images were highlighted manually by drawing around its perimeter which then highlights the whole crystal. Images of the highlighted crystals were then 25  measured using the image analysis software which counts the number of pixels required to complete the longest diameter (length), shortest diameter (breadth), the aspect ratio (length/breadth) .<br>
30  The average aspect ratio for the crystals was calculated.<br>

The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br>
WO 00/53026	PCT/EP00/01757<br>
ICE CONFECTION<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to novel ice confections. In particular the invention relates to novel ice confections containing an antifreeze protein.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
It is highly desirable to be able to manufacture ice confections having novel shapes, properties and/or textures. Until now, however the ability to provide such a high degree of novelty and interest to the products has been limited. In particular products have to be manufactured with the ability<br>
to survive packaging/ storage and distribution.<br><br>
We have now shown that inclusion of specific antifreeze proteins into selected ice confections results in the formation of a strong, close-packed continuous network of ice crystals within the ice confection. As a result the ice confection is provided with specific defined mechanical properties. Such ice confections have novel textures and/or properties. The novel features can be retained during packaging, storage and distribution.<br>
WO 98/04146 {Unilever) discloses that AFPs can be incorporated into frozen food products such as ice confections to provide desirable product properties providing that the product and processing conditions are varied such that the ice crystals provided in the product have an  aspect ratio of more, than 1.9, preferably from 1.9 to 3.0. The specific examples given are all aerated ice<br>
2<br><br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>

cream compositions. As shown by comparative Examples A to C below, the addition of antifreeze proteins to aerated ice cream does not significantly change the mechanical properties of the ice cream. WO 98/04146 does not teach that 5  it is possible to provide specific ice confection products having novel mechanical properties.<br>
WO 96/39878 (The Pillsbury Company) discloses a method for making a frozen composition for storage, the method not 10  requiring a hardening step prior to storage. The frozen composition contains an antifreeze protein, in particular Type I AFP. Examples show the preparation of an aerated ice cream and an aerated frozen yogurt. As shown by comparative Examples A to C below, the addition of antifreeze proteins   15  to aerated ice cream does not significantly change the<br>
mechanical properties of the ice cream. WO 96/39878 does not teach that it is possible to provide specific ice confection products having novel mechanical properties.<br>
20  OS 5 118 792 (Warren et al) discloses the addition of fusion proteins, and in particular the fusion protein protein A-Saf5 into foods which are to be consumed frozen, for example, ice cream, frozen yogurt, ice milk, sherbet, popsicles and frozen whipped cream. No examples are given<br>
25  where a final ice confection product is provided containing such fusion proteins. It is shown in Example 3B that when a popsicle formulation is used within the "splat assay", growth of the ice crystals is restricted.<br>
1 30  Surprisingly we have now found that the addition of specific antifreeze proteins to defined ice confections, for example<br>
3<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
to water ices, ice milks, and unaerated ice cream, results in the formation of a strong, close-packed continuous network of ice crystals within the ice confection providing significant, advantageous changes to the mechanical 5  properties of the ice confection.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly the invention provides an ice confection<br>
comprising an antifreeze protein, wherein • 10  A modulus/original modulus &gt; 0.4,  and/or<br>
A strength/original strength &gt; 0.4, providing that when<br>
A modulus/original modulus  50MPa, and/or<br>
when A strength/original strength 
A strength &gt; 0.2MPa. 15<br>
Preferably A modulus/original modulus &gt; 0.4; providing that<br>
when A modulus /original modulus  90MPa.<br>
Most preferably A modulus/original modulus &gt; 1.0; providing<br>
that when A modulus/original modulus  20  lOOMPa.<br>
Preferably A strength/original strength &gt;  0.7.  Most preferably A strength/original strength &gt; 1.5.<br>
25  By modulus is meant the apparent elastic modulus (E) as<br>
determined using a four point bend test. Example 1 gives the standard procedure for performing a four point bend test.<br>
4<br><br>
WO00/53026	PCT/EP00/01757<br>
Therefore A modulus (AE) means the change in modulus between two ice confections whose formulation and process of manufacture are identical in all respects except that the first ice confection includes in its composition an 5  antifreeze protein, and the second ice confection has no antifreeze protein included in its composition (the control composition) . Original modulus (Eorig) is the modulus measured in the control composition.<br>
10  By strength is meant the flexure strength (Ou ) which can be defined as the maximum stress that a material can withstand, under the particular conditions. The flexure strength is given by the stress at a point of maximum force on the force versus displacement curve recorded during a four point bend<br>
15  test.<br>
Therefore strength   means the change in strength between two ice confections whose formulation and process of manufacture are identical in all respects except that the<br>
20  first ice confection includes in its composition an<br>
antifreeze protein, and the second ice confection has no antifreeze protein included in its composition (the control composition) . Original strength (Ou orig) is the modulus measured in the control composition.<br>
25<br>
In addition to changes in the apparent elastic modulus and flexure strength, an increase in product hardness is provided by the ice confections according to the invention. For ice confections frozen with agitation, for example in an<br>
30  ice cream freezer (such as a scraped surface heat<br>
5<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
exchanger), the increase in hardness can be measured using the Vickers hardness test- Details of the Vickers hardness test are given in Example 3.<br>
5  The degree to which the Vickers Hardness (HV)   of the ice confection is increased by the addition of the antifreeze protein depends in part on the ice content of the ice confection.<br>
10  However, generally  0.3, providing that when<br><br>
Preferably  providing that when<br><br>
15<br>
Most preferably either <br><br>
Where AHV is the change in Vickers Hardness between two ice 20  confections whose formulation and process of manufacture are identical in ail respects except that the first ice confection includes in its composition an antifreeze protein, and the second ice confection has no antifreeze protein included in its composition (the control 25  composition) . Hv orig   is the original Vickers Hardness measured in the control composition.<br>
By close-pack.ed contiimo-us network of ice crystals is meant that any given ice crystal is connected to at least one 30  other ice crystal.<br>
6<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
In unaerated ice confections which have been frozen with<br>
agitation, the degree of network formation can be measured<br>
	as contiguity. Contiguity is defined as the ratio of the<br>
- 5  particle to particle interface area divided by the total interface area. It is thus a measure of the degree of network formation of the particle phase. Example 4 shows a method for the measurement of contiguity.<br>
10  Unaerated ice confections according to the invention have a    contiguity of at least 0.2, as measured, by the test given in     Example 4, for an ice content of from 50-90%, preferably 54-85% by weight, when measured at -18°C.<br>
15  In unaerated ice confections which have been frozen by any means, the degree of network formation can be measured as<br>
    the Euler-Poincare characteristic of the ice phase. The<br>
Euler-Poincare characteristic is a measure of the degree of network formation of a particular phase. The lower and more<br>
20  negative the value of the Euler-Poincare characteristic, the greater the continuity of the phase in question. Example 5 shows a method for the measurement of the Euler-Poincare characteristic.<br>
25  Unaerated ice confections according to the invention have an ice phase Euler-Poincare characteristic of less than -150mm-2 as measured by the test given in Example 5 for an ice content of from 50-90%, preferably 54-85% by weight when measured at -18°C-<br>

WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
By antifreeze protein (AFP) is meant a protein which has significant ice recrystallisation inhibition properties as measured in accordance with Example 2.  The AFP provides an ice particle size upon recrystallisation of less than 20um, 5  more preferred from 5 to 15um.<br>
Preferably the ice confection comprises at least 0.0005% by weight antifreeze protein, more preferably 0.0025% by weight antifreeze protein. Typically the ice confection will 10  comprise from 0.0005% by weight to 0.005% by weight antifreeze protein.<br>
For some applications it may be advantageous to include a mixture of two or more different AFPs into the food product.<br>

The AFP for use in products of the invention can be any AFP suitable for use in food products. Examples of suitable sources of AFP are for example given in the article "Antifreeze proteins and their potential use in frozen food<br>
20  products", Marylin Griffith and K. Vanya Ewart,<br>
Biotechnology Advances, vol 13, pp375-402, 1995  and in patent applications WO 98/04699, WO 9.8/04146, WO 98/04147, WO 98/04148 and WO 98/22591.<br>
25  The AFPs can be obtained from their sources by any suitable process, for example the isolation processes as described in the above mentioned documents.<br>
One possible source of AFP materials is fish. Examples of 30  fish AFP materials are antifreeze glycoproteins {AFGP) (for example obtainable from Atlantic cod, Greenland cod and<br>
8<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/017J<br><br>
Tomcod), Type I AFP (for example obtainable" from Winter flounder, Yellowtail flounder, Shorthorn sculpin and Grubby sculpin), Type II AFP (for example obtainable from Sea raven, Smelt and Atlantic herring) and Type III AFP (for example obtainable from Ocean Pout, Atlantic wolffish. Radiated shanny, Rock gunnel and Laval"s. eelpout). A preferred example of the latter type is described in WO 97/02343.<br>
Another possible source of AFP material are invertebrates. Also AFPs may be obtained from Bacteria.<br>
A third possible source of AFP material are plants. Examples of plants containing AFPs are garlic-mustard, blue wood aster, spring oat, winter cress, winter canola, Brussels sprout, carrot, Dutchman"s breeches, spurge, daylily, winter barley, Virginia waterleaf, narrow-leaved plantain, plantain, speargrass, Kentucky bluegrass, Eastern cottonwood, white oak, winter rye, bittersweet nightshade, potato, chickweed, dandelion, spring and winter wheat, triticale, periwinkle, violet and grass.<br>
Both natural occurring species may be used or species which have been obtained through genetic modification. For example micro-organisms or plants may be genetically modified to express AFPs and the AFPs may then be used in accordance to the present invention.<br>
Genetic manipulation  techniques may be used to produce AFPs. Genetic manipulation techniques may be used to produce AFPs having at least 80%, more preferred more than 95%, most<br>
9<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
preferred 100% homology to the AFPs directly obtained from the natural sources. For the purpose of the invention these AFPs possessing this high level of homology are also embraced within the term "AFPs". 5<br>
The genetic manipulation techniques may be used as follows: An appropriate host cell or organism would be transformed by a gene construct that contains the desired polypeptide. The nucleotide sequence coding for the polypeptide can be<br>
10  inserted into a suitable expression vector encoding the<br>
necessary elements for transcription and translation and in such a manner that they will be expressed under appropriate conditions (for example in proper orientation and correct reading frame and with appropriate targeting and expression<br>
15  sequences). The methods required to construct these<br>
expression vectors are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
A number of expression systems may be utilised to express 20  the polypeptide coding sequence. These include, but are not limited to, bacteria, yeast insect cell systems, plant cell culture systems and plants all transformed with the appropriate expression vectors.<br>
25  A wide variety of plants and plant cell systems can be<br>
transformed with the nucleic acid constructs of the desired polypeptides. Preferred embodiments would include, but are not limited to, maize, tomato, tobacco, carrots, strawberries, rape seed and sugar beet.<br>

WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCI7EP00/01757<br><br>
For some natural sources the AFPs  may consist of a mixture of two or more different AFPs.<br>
Preferably the antifreeze protein is chosen such that it 5  gives an aspect ratio of more than 1.9 to the ice crystal, preferably from 1.9 to 3.0, more preferably from 2.0 to 2.9, even more preferred from 2.1 and 2.8 (see WO 98/04146). In particular antifreeze proteins which provide an aspect ratio of more than 1.9 to the ice crystal are the preferred AFP 10  for addition to aerated ice confections. Aspect ratio is<br>
defined as the maximum diameter of a particle divided by its minimum diameter. The aspect ratio can be determined by any suitable method. A preferred method is illustrated in the Examples (Example 6).<br>
For the purpose of the invention the preferred AFPs are derived from fish. Especially preferred is the use of fish proteins of the type III, most preferred HPLC 12 as described in our case WO 97/02343. In particular AFP type 20  III HPLC 12 is the preferred AFP for addition to aerated ice confections.<br>
Ice confections which show the required change in mechanical properties on the addition of the antifreeze protein include<br>
25 unaerated milk containing frozen confections such as ice-cream, frozen yoghurt, and frozen custard, aerated and unaerated sherbet and milk ice, as well as aerated and unaerated frozen confections which do not typically contain milk such as water ices, sorbet, granitas and frozen fruit<br>
30  purees.<br>
11<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
Preferably the ice confection is selected from an unaerated ice cream, an unaerated or aerated water ice and an unaerated or aerated milk ice.<br>
5 Most preferably the ice confection is selected from an unaerated water ice, an aerated water ice or unaerated milk ice.<br>
By water ice is meant a frozen solution made essentially 10  from sugar, water,  fruit acid or other acidifying agent, colour, fruit or fruit flavouring.<br>
By unaerated is meant an ice confection having an overrun of less than 25% (equivalent to 0.2 volume fraction of air),<br>
15 preferably less than 10%(equivalent to 0.09 volume fraction of air). During the processing of the ice confection no deliberate steps such as whipping are undertaken to increase the gas content of the product. However, it should be realised that during normal methods for the preparation of<br>
20 non-aerated ice confections, low levels of gas or air may be incorporated into the product, for example due to the mixing conditions used.<br>
Ice confections having an antifreeze protein included in<br>
25  their composition, such that the mechanical properties of<br>
the ice confection are changed as defined, can provide many<br>
new interesting products having different shapes, textures<br>
and properties.<br>
12<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
The ice confection containing the antifreeze protein may constitute the entire product or may be a component of a composite product.<br>
5 An example of a product which may be manufactured using ice confections having an antifreeze protein included in their composition, such that the mechanical properties of the ice confection are changed as defined, are shaped products which have a high degree of definition.<br>
10<br>
There is an increasing demand, particularly in children"s ice confections, to be able to provide products having complex shapes such as cartoon characters and the like, however to date such products cannot be produced having a<br>
15  high degree of definition. Further small protruding features such as hands or beaks are liable to break off during manufacture, packaging, storage or transportation.<br>
An example of what is meant by "high degree of definition" would be a product having protrusions which are typically greater than 3mm in length and may be as long as 5 cm or more, whilst having a thickness of only 1 to 5 mm. Such protrusions would not normally be able to withstand standard manufacture packaging, storage and transportation processes.<br>
We are now able to provide such shaped products by the use of an ice confection having the mechanical properties as defined above.<br>
30 The ice confection will typically have an ice content of at least 30% by volume when measured at -18°C, more preferably<br>
13<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
at  least  40%  by  volume  when  measured  at  -18°C,  most preferably at least 50% by volume when  measured at -18°C.<br>
The ice content may be determined following the techniques 5  described in the article by B de Cindio and S Correra in the Journal of Food Engineering, Volume 24, pages 405-415, 1995. The enthalpy data required for this technique is obtained using adiabatic calorimetry (Holometrix Adiabatic Calorimeter) .  The ice contents as expressed herein are<br>
10  measured on an 80g sample poured into the sample holder of the calorimeter and cooled to -75°C by placing the assembly in dry ice prior to placing in the calorimeter (precooled to between -70°C and -80°C) .  The enthalpy data obtained was analysed to give ice content as a function of the<br>
15  temperature following the method of Cindio and Carrera.<br>
In general the ice confection has a total soluble solids<br>
content of less than 40% by weight, preferably less than 25%<br>
by weight, most preferably less than 15% by weight.  For low<br>
20  calorie products the total soluble solids content may be as<br>
 	low as, for example, approximately 5% by weight.<br>
The total soluble solids content is measured at 4 °C and is the % by weight of the total composition that is dissolved 25  at that temperature.<br>
It has further been observed that products according to the invention retain their structural integrity for longer when held at ambient temperatures.<br>

Examples<br>
10<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by means of the following examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
15<br>
Four point bend test<br>
The standard four point bend test can be used to determine a number of mechanical properties of ice  confection materials. 20  The mechanical properties being measured are Young"s modulus (apparent) and flexure strength.<br>
In a bend test, a test piece is deformed whilst measuring the applied force and test piece deflection. A schematic 25  data set for an ice confection is shown in Figure 1. The" apparent elastic modulus is determined by the gradient of the initial linear part of this curve.<br>
The 4-point bend test requires production of a parallel 30  sided rectangular bar of ice confection material. This may be obtained by any suitable means.<br>
17<br><br>
VO 00/53026<br><br>
PCI7EP00/01757<br><br>
In  this  particular  application  the  parallel  sided rectangular bar of ice confection was made using aluminium moulds producing bars having the dimensions 25 x 25 x 200 5  mm.<br>
a)   Quiescent frozen ice confections<br>
The liquid ice confection pre-mix was poured into a mould<br>
10  which had been pre-cooled in a blast freezer at -35°C for at<br>
least 30 minutes, the mould was. then placed in a blast<br>
freezer at -35°C for at least 2 hours. The samples were then<br>
de-moulded and stored at -25°C until testing  (conducted<br>
after 5-6 days). 18 to 24 hours prior to testing the samples<br>
15  were equilibrated by storing at -18 °C, the temperature at<br>
which all tests were performed. A minimum of 10 bars was<br>
tested for each sample set and the mean value of each sample<br>
set was recorded as the value of the mechanical property<br>
being measured.<br>
20<br>
b)   Ice confections frozen with agitation<br>
The ice confection was extruded from the ice cream freezer (scraped surface heat exchanger) at a temperature of from<br>
25 -1°C to -5°C, depending on the ice confection, into a mould which had been pre-cooled in a blast freezer at -35 °C for at least 30 minutes, the mould was lined with silicon paper to prevent ice-metal adhesion. The sample was then prepared as above for quiescent frozen samples.<br>

The general test applied to all types of solids is described in "Biomechanics Materials.  A practical Approach" Ed. J.F.V. Vincent, Pub. IRL Press, Oxford University Press, Walton Street, Oxford, 1992 and "Handbook of Plastics Test 5  materials" Ed. R.P. Brown, Pub. George Godwin Limited, The Builder  Group, 1-3 Pemberton Row,  Fleet Street,, London, 1981.  Testing involves placing, each bar onto 2 supports and bending it until fracture by applying pressure from two upper supports, that are separated by 85mm, centrally on the 10  bar"s top surface.  The force applied in bending and the displacement of the moving contact is recorded throughout the test. The speed of descent of the moving support was 50mm per minute.<br>
The apparent elastic modulus of the material is given by the 15  equation;<br>
E = (0.21) .gradient.S3<br>
BD3 where the gradient is that shown in Figure 1, S is the span 20  (distance) between the supporting contacts beneath the test bar, B  is the width of the bar and D  is the depth of the bar.<br>
For these tests the span (5) was 170mm. 25<br>
With reference to Figure 1, the strength of a material under three point bend conditions, is -given as;<br>

Example 2 5<br>
Method of determining whether an AFP possesses ice recrystallisation inhibition properties.<br>
Recrystallisation inhibition properties can measured using a<br>
10  modified "splat assay" (Knight et al, 1988). 2.5 pl of the solution under investigation in 30% (w/w) sucrose is transferred onto a clean, appropriately labelled,. 16 mm circular coverslip. A second coverslip is placed on top of the drop of solution and the sandwich pressed together<br>
15  between finger and thumb. The sandwich is dropped into a bath of hexane held at -80°C in a box of dry ice. When all sandwiches have been prepared, sandwiches are transferred from the -80°C hexane bath to the viewing -chamber containing hexane held at -6°C using forceps pre-cooled in the dry ice.<br>
20  Upon transfer to -6°C, sandwiches can be seen to change from a transparent to an opaque appearance. Images are recorded by video camera and grabbed into an image analysis system (LUCIA, Nikon) using a 20x objective. Images of each splat are recorded at time = 0 and again after 60 minutes. The<br>
25  size of the ice-crystals in both assays is compared by<br>
placing the slides within a temperature controlled cryostat cabinet (Bright Instrument Co Ltd, Huntington, UK). Images of the samples are transferred to a Quantimet 520 MC image analysis system (Leica, Cambridge UK) by means of a Sony<br>
30  monochrome CCD videocamera. Ice crystal sizing was performed by hand-drawing around ice-crystal. At least 400 crystals<br>
20<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
were sized for each sample. The ice crystal size was taken as being the longest dimension of the 2D projection of each crystal. The average crystal size was determined as the number average of the individual crystal sizes. If the size 5  at 30-60 minutes is similar or only moderately (less than 10%) increased compared to the size at t=o, and/or the crystal size is less than 20 micrometer, preferably from 5 to 15 micrometer this is an indication of good ice recrystallisation inhibition properties 10<br>
Example 3<br>
Standard Vickers Hardness test.<br>
The Vickers Hardness test is an indentation test that involves pushing a pyramid shaped indentor into the surface of material and recording the force applied as a function of tip displacement. Force and displacement are measured during the indentation loading cycle and the unloading cycle.<br>
The  test  is	described  in  "Handbook  of  Plastics  Test<br>
materials" Ed.	R.P. Brown, Pub. George Godwin Limited, The<br>
Builder Group, 1-3 Pemberton Row, Fleet Street, London, 1981.<br>
The Vickers pyramid geometry is an engineering industry standard (BSi 427, 1990) . It has an apex an-gle at the tip of 136°. Hardness is determined as;<br>
30 <br>
21<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
where Hv is the Vickers Hardness, Fmax is the maximum applied force (see figure 2) and A is the projected area of the indentation left in the material"s surface. The area A is 5 determined by assuming the indentation has the same geometry as the indentor that formed it, i.e. a Vickers pyramid, and therefore the projected area can be determined from the indent depth given by d±  in figure 2.<br>
10 A = 24.5d2<br>
The Vickers Hardness of a material is a measure of the material"s resistance to plastic deformation.<br>
The test samples were 500ml blocks, manufactured by extruding the ice confection (typically at a temperature of from -1°C to -5°C) from a scraped surface heat exchanger into standard 500ml packets and then placing the packets into a blast freezer at -35°C for two hours prior to storage at -25°C. Prior to testing the . samples were equilibrated overnight at the required test temperature of -18°C.<br>
Measurements were conducted on a universal testing machine made by Instron (code 4500), within a temperature controlled 25 cabinet at -18°C. The crosshead speed was 2.0mm/min. The maximum load was 95N. The pyramid tip pushed into the surface of the material to a depth of 1.5mm for a water ice and 2.5mra for an ice cream.<br>

PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
Example 4<br>
Measurement of Contiguity<br>
Contiguity is measured using microstructural images of the ice confection using cryogenic Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Structures are imaged using the technique described in "A low temperature scanning electron microscopy study of ice cream. I. Techniques an general microstructure" Food Structure Vol. 11 (1992), pp 1-9.<br>
In a particulate composite, the Contiguity of the particulate phase is defined as the ratio of the particle to particle interface area divided by the total internal interface area. It is a measure of the degree of network formation of the particulate phase. In ice confections the particles are ice crystals within the matrix and thus contiguity of the ice is defined as;<br><br>
where Cii is the contiguity, Aii is the total interfacial surface area of ice-ice interfaces and Aim is the interfacial surface area of ice-matrix interfaces. Contiguity can be measured from microstructural images of random planar surfaces cut through the material. Cryo-SEM images of flat fracture surfaces of unaerated ice confection are sufficient for this.<br>
23<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
By placing an array of lines on the image of the microstructure, the number of intercepts of these lines with ice-ice and ice-matrix interfaces are counted and combined in the following equation, to give the contiguity; 5<br><br>
where Nii = number per unit length of ice-ice intercepts and Nim  = number per unit length of ice-matrix intercepts. 10<br>
Ideally, approximately 800 interfaces were counted from a total of 5 images that are representative of each sample"s structure.<br>
15  To determine contiguity, two sets of measurements were taken from each image. After placing a regular set of lines onto the image, the number of intercepts of the ice-matrix and ice-ice interfaces with these lines were counted, only including all obvious ice-ice interfaces. The count was then<br>
20  repeated, but this time with all possible ice-ice interfaces included. As such, a maximum ice contiguity measurement and a minimum ice contiguity measurement was made for each image. The mean of these figures is then taken as the contiguity value.<br>

Measurement of Euler-Poincare characteristic<br>
5  The Euler-Poincare characteristic is measured using<br>
microstructural images of the ice confection using cryogenic Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).  Structures are imaged using the technique described in "A low temperature scanning electron microscopy study of ice cream. I. Techniques on 10  general microstructure" Food Structure Vol. II (1992), pp 1-9.<br>
In a two-phase composite structure, the degree of continuity of one phase can be measured using the Euler-Poincare<br>
15  characteristic.  The lower value of the Euler-Poincare<br>
characteristic for a phase, the more continuous or connected that phase is within the microstructure.  The Euler-Poincare characteristic can be a positive or negative number.  The definition of the Euler-Poincare characteristic is given in<br>
20  "Unbiased estimation of the Euler-Poincare characteristic" . by B.P. Pinnamaneni, C. Lantuejoul, J.P. Hernot and J.L. Chermant, Acta Sterelogica, 1989, 8/2, pl€l-106.<br>
To measure the Euler-Poincare characteristic for ice in ice 25  confections, identification of the ice and,matrix phases on the microstructural images was performed and using an image analysis system, the ice phase Euler-Poincare characteristic was determined using a specifically written analysis program.  Whenever contrast in the images was insufficient 30  for the image analysis system to automatically distinguish<br>
ice and matrix separately, the interface between the two was<br>
25<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
identified manually, thus enabling accurate determination of the Euler-Poincare characteristic.<br>
The Euler-Poincare characteristic can be measured for ice in 5  an ice confection produced by any processing route.<br>
Example 6<br>
Aspect Ratio Measurement<br>
10<br>
Samples were equilibrated at -18°C in a Prolan environmental cabinet for approximately 12 hours. Microscopic slides were prepared by smearing a thin layer of ice confection from the centre of thin glass plates.<br>
15<br>
Each slide was transferred to a temperature controlled microscopic stage (at -18°C) where images of ice crystals (about 400 individual ice crystals) were collected and relayed through a video camera to an image storage and<br>
20  analysis system.<br>
The stored ice crystal images were highlighted manually by drawing around its perimeter which then highlights the whole crystal. Images of the highlighted crystals were then 25  measured using the image analysis software which counts the number of pixels required to complete the longest diameter (length), shortest diameter (breadth), the aspect ratio (length/breadth) .<br>
30  The average aspect ratio for the crystals was calculated.<br>

On attempting to demould the water ice crocodile which did not contain AFP, the small protrusions (including the legs and the tail) were too fragile, and broke off as the product 5 was removed from the mould. In contrast, the crocodile containing AFP could be removed from the mould in one piece, with all small protrusions remaining intact.<br>

The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br>

ICE CONFECTION<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to novel ice confections. In particular the invention relates to novel ice confections containing an antifreeze protein.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
It is highly desirable to be able to manufacture ice confections having novel shapes, properties and/or textures. Until now, however the ability to provide such a high degree of novelty and interest to the products has been limited. In particular products have to be manufactured with the ability<br>
to survive packaging/ storage and distribution.<br><br>
We have now shown that inclusion of specific antifreeze proteins into selected ice confections results in the formation of a strong, close-packed continuous network of ice crystals within the ice confection. As a result the ice confection is provided with specific defined mechanical properties. Such ice confections have novel textures and/or properties. The novel features can be retained during packaging, storage and distribution.<br>
WO 98/04146 {Unilever) discloses that AFPs can be incorporated into frozen food products such as ice confections to provide desirable product properties providing that the product and processing conditions are varied such that the ice crystals provided in the product have an  aspect ratio of more, than 1.9, preferably from 1.9 to 3.0. The specific examples given are all aerated ice<br>

cream compositions. As shown by comparative Examples A to C below, the addition of antifreeze proteins to aerated ice cream does not significantly change the mechanical properties of the ice cream. WO 98/04146 does not teach that 5  it is possible to provide specific ice confection products having novel mechanical properties.<br>
WO 96/39878 (The Pillsbury Company) discloses a method for making a frozen composition for storage, the method not 10  requiring a hardening step prior to storage. The frozen composition contains an antifreeze protein, in particular Type I AFP. Examples show the preparation of an aerated ice cream and an aerated frozen yogurt. As shown by comparative Examples A to C below, the addition of antifreeze proteins   15  to aerated ice cream does not significantly change the<br>
mechanical properties of the ice cream. WO 96/39878 does not teach that it is possible to provide specific ice confection products having novel mechanical properties.<br>
20  OS 5 118 792 (Warren et al) discloses the addition of fusion proteins, and in particular the fusion protein protein A-Saf5 into foods which are to be consumed frozen, for example, ice cream, frozen yogurt, ice milk, sherbet, popsicles and frozen whipped cream. No examples are given<br>
25  where a final ice confection product is provided containing such fusion proteins. It is shown in Example 3B that when a popsicle formulation is used within the "splat assay", growth of the ice crystals is restricted.<br>
1 30  Surprisingly we have now found that the addition of specific antifreeze proteins to defined ice confections, for example<br>
3<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
to water ices, ice milks, and unaerated ice cream, results in the formation of a strong, close-packed continuous network of ice crystals within the ice confection providing significant, advantageous changes to the mechanical 5  properties of the ice confection.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly the invention provides an ice confection<br>
comprising an antifreeze protein, wherein • 10  A modulus/original modulus &gt; 0.4,  and/or<br>
A strength/original strength &gt; 0.4, providing that when<br>
A modulus/original modulus  50MPa, and/or<br>
when A strength/original strength 
A strength &gt; 0.2MPa. 15<br>
Preferably A modulus/original modulus &gt; 0.4; providing that<br>
when A modulus /original modulus  90MPa.<br>
Most preferably A modulus/original modulus &gt; 1.0; providing<br>
that when A modulus/original modulus  20  lOOMPa.<br>
Preferably A strength/original strength &gt;  0.7.  Most preferably A strength/original strength &gt; 1.5.<br>
25  By modulus is meant the apparent elastic modulus (E) as<br>
determined using a four point bend test. Example 1 gives the standard procedure for performing a four point bend test.<br>
4<br><br>
WO00/53026	PCT/EP00/01757<br>
Therefore A modulus (AE) means the change in modulus between two ice confections whose formulation and process of manufacture are identical in all respects except that the first ice confection includes in its composition an 5  antifreeze protein, and the second ice confection has no antifreeze protein included in its composition (the control composition) . Original modulus (Eorig) is the modulus measured in the control composition.<br>
10  By strength is meant the flexure strength (Ou ) which can be defined as the maximum stress that a material can withstand, under the particular conditions. The flexure strength is given by the stress at a point of maximum force on the force versus displacement curve recorded during a four point bend<br>
15  test.<br>
Therefore strength   means the change in strength between two ice confections whose formulation and process of manufacture are identical in all respects except that the<br>
20  first ice confection includes in its composition an<br>
antifreeze protein, and the second ice confection has no antifreeze protein included in its composition (the control composition) . Original strength (Ou orig) is the modulus measured in the control composition.<br>
25<br>
In addition to changes in the apparent elastic modulus and flexure strength, an increase in product hardness is provided by the ice confections according to the invention. For ice confections frozen with agitation, for example in an<br>
30  ice cream freezer (such as a scraped surface heat<br>
5<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
exchanger), the increase in hardness can be measured using the Vickers hardness test- Details of the Vickers hardness test are given in Example 3.<br>
5  The degree to which the Vickers Hardness (HV)   of the ice confection is increased by the addition of the antifreeze protein depends in part on the ice content of the ice confection.<br>
10  However, generally  0.3, providing that when<br><br>
Preferably  providing that when<br><br>
15<br>
Most preferably either <br><br>
Where AHV is the change in Vickers Hardness between two ice 20  confections whose formulation and process of manufacture are identical in ail respects except that the first ice confection includes in its composition an antifreeze protein, and the second ice confection has no antifreeze protein included in its composition (the control 25  composition) . Hv orig   is the original Vickers Hardness measured in the control composition.<br>
By close-pack.ed contiimo-us network of ice crystals is meant that any given ice crystal is connected to at least one 30  other ice crystal.<br>
6<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
In unaerated ice confections which have been frozen with<br>
agitation, the degree of network formation can be measured<br>
	as contiguity. Contiguity is defined as the ratio of the<br>
- 5  particle to particle interface area divided by the total interface area. It is thus a measure of the degree of network formation of the particle phase. Example 4 shows a method for the measurement of contiguity.<br>
10  Unaerated ice confections according to the invention have a    contiguity of at least 0.2, as measured, by the test given in     Example 4, for an ice content of from 50-90%, preferably 54-85% by weight, when measured at -18°C.<br>
15  In unaerated ice confections which have been frozen by any means, the degree of network formation can be measured as<br>
    the Euler-Poincare characteristic of the ice phase. The<br>
Euler-Poincare characteristic is a measure of the degree of network formation of a particular phase. The lower and more<br>
20  negative the value of the Euler-Poincare characteristic, the greater the continuity of the phase in question. Example 5 shows a method for the measurement of the Euler-Poincare characteristic.<br>
25  Unaerated ice confections according to the invention have an ice phase Euler-Poincare characteristic of less than -150mm-2 as measured by the test given in Example 5 for an ice content of from 50-90%, preferably 54-85% by weight when measured at -18°C-<br>

WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
By antifreeze protein (AFP) is meant a protein which has significant ice recrystallisation inhibition properties as measured in accordance with Example 2.  The AFP provides an ice particle size upon recrystallisation of less than 20um, 5  more preferred from 5 to 15um.<br>
Preferably the ice confection comprises at least 0.0005% by weight antifreeze protein, more preferably 0.0025% by weight antifreeze protein. Typically the ice confection will 10  comprise from 0.0005% by weight to 0.005% by weight antifreeze protein.<br>
For some applications it may be advantageous to include a mixture of two or more different AFPs into the food product.<br>
15<br>
The AFP for use in products of the invention can be any AFP suitable for use in food products. Examples of suitable sources of AFP are for example given in the article "Antifreeze proteins and their potential use in frozen food<br>
20  products", Marylin Griffith and K. Vanya Ewart,<br>
Biotechnology Advances, vol 13, pp375-402, 1995  and in patent applications WO 98/04699, WO 9.8/04146, WO 98/04147, WO 98/04148 and WO 98/22591.<br>
25  The AFPs can be obtained from their sources by any suitable process, for example the isolation processes as described in the above mentioned documents.<br>
One possible source of AFP materials is fish. Examples of 30  fish AFP materials are antifreeze glycoproteins {AFGP) (for example obtainable from Atlantic cod, Greenland cod and<br>
8<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/017J<br><br>
Tomcod), Type I AFP (for example obtainable" from Winter flounder, Yellowtail flounder, Shorthorn sculpin and Grubby sculpin), Type II AFP (for example obtainable from Sea raven, Smelt and Atlantic herring) and Type III AFP (for example obtainable from Ocean Pout, Atlantic wolffish. Radiated shanny, Rock gunnel and Laval"s. eelpout). A preferred example of the latter type is described in WO 97/02343.<br>
Another possible source of AFP material are invertebrates. Also AFPs may be obtained from Bacteria.<br>
A third possible source of AFP material are plants. Examples of plants containing AFPs are garlic-mustard, blue wood aster, spring oat, winter cress, winter canola, Brussels sprout, carrot, Dutchman"s breeches, spurge, daylily, winter barley, Virginia waterleaf, narrow-leaved plantain, plantain, speargrass, Kentucky bluegrass, Eastern cottonwood, white oak, winter rye, bittersweet nightshade, potato, chickweed, dandelion, spring and winter wheat, triticale, periwinkle, violet and grass.<br>
Both natural occurring species may be used or species which have been obtained through genetic modification. For example micro-organisms or plants may be genetically modified to express AFPs and the AFPs may then be used in accordance to the present invention.<br>
Genetic manipulation  techniques may be used to produce AFPs. Genetic manipulation techniques may be used to produce AFPs having at least 80%, more preferred more than 95%, most<br>
9<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
preferred 100% homology to the AFPs directly obtained from the natural sources. For the purpose of the invention these AFPs possessing this high level of homology are also embraced within the term "AFPs". 5<br>
The genetic manipulation techniques may be used as follows: An appropriate host cell or organism would be transformed by a gene construct that contains the desired polypeptide. The nucleotide sequence coding for the polypeptide can be<br>
10  inserted into a suitable expression vector encoding the<br>
necessary elements for transcription and translation and in such a manner that they will be expressed under appropriate conditions (for example in proper orientation and correct reading frame and with appropriate targeting and expression<br>
15  sequences). The methods required to construct these<br>
expression vectors are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
A number of expression systems may be utilised to express 20  the polypeptide coding sequence. These include, but are not limited to, bacteria, yeast insect cell systems, plant cell culture systems and plants all transformed with the appropriate expression vectors.<br>
25  A wide variety of plants and plant cell systems can be<br>
transformed with the nucleic acid constructs of the desired polypeptides. Preferred embodiments would include, but are not limited to, maize, tomato, tobacco, carrots, strawberries, rape seed and sugar beet.<br>

WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCI7EP00/01757<br><br>
For some natural sources the AFPs  may consist of a mixture of two or more different AFPs.<br>
Preferably the antifreeze protein is chosen such that it 5  gives an aspect ratio of more than 1.9 to the ice crystal, preferably from 1.9 to 3.0, more preferably from 2.0 to 2.9, even more preferred from 2.1 and 2.8 (see WO 98/04146). In particular antifreeze proteins which provide an aspect ratio of more than 1.9 to the ice crystal are the preferred AFP 10  for addition to aerated ice confections. Aspect ratio is<br>
defined as the maximum diameter of a particle divided by its minimum diameter. The aspect ratio can be determined by any suitable method. A preferred method is illustrated in the Examples (Example 6).<br>
For the purpose of the invention the preferred AFPs are derived from fish. Especially preferred is the use of fish proteins of the type III, most preferred HPLC 12 as described in our case WO 97/02343. In particular AFP type 20  III HPLC 12 is the preferred AFP for addition to aerated ice confections.<br>
Ice confections which show the required change in mechanical properties on the addition of the antifreeze protein include<br>
25 unaerated milk containing frozen confections such as ice-cream, frozen yoghurt, and frozen custard, aerated and unaerated sherbet and milk ice, as well as aerated and unaerated frozen confections which do not typically contain milk such as water ices, sorbet, granitas and frozen fruit<br>
30  purees.<br>
11<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
Preferably the ice confection is selected from an unaerated ice cream, an unaerated or aerated water ice and an unaerated or aerated milk ice.<br>
5 Most preferably the ice confection is selected from an unaerated water ice, an aerated water ice or unaerated milk ice.<br>
By water ice is meant a frozen solution made essentially 10  from sugar, water,  fruit acid or other acidifying agent, colour, fruit or fruit flavouring.<br>
By unaerated is meant an ice confection having an overrun of less than 25% (equivalent to 0.2 volume fraction of air),<br>
15 preferably less than 10%(equivalent to 0.09 volume fraction of air). During the processing of the ice confection no deliberate steps such as whipping are undertaken to increase the gas content of the product. However, it should be realised that during normal methods for the preparation of<br>
20 non-aerated ice confections, low levels of gas or air may be incorporated into the product, for example due to the mixing conditions used.<br>
Ice confections having an antifreeze protein included in<br>
25  their composition, such that the mechanical properties of<br>
the ice confection are changed as defined, can provide many<br>
new interesting products having different shapes, textures<br>
and properties.<br>
12<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
The ice confection containing the antifreeze protein may constitute the entire product or may be a component of a composite product.<br>
5 An example of a product which may be manufactured using ice confections having an antifreeze protein included in their composition, such that the mechanical properties of the ice confection are changed as defined, are shaped products which have a high degree of definition.<br>
10<br>
There is an increasing demand, particularly in children"s ice confections, to be able to provide products having complex shapes such as cartoon characters and the like, however to date such products cannot be produced having a<br>
15  high degree of definition. Further small protruding features such as hands or beaks are liable to break off during manufacture, packaging, storage or transportation.<br>
An example of what is meant by "high degree of definition" would be a product having protrusions which are typically greater than 3mm in length and may be as long as 5 cm or more, whilst having a thickness of only 1 to 5 mm. Such protrusions would not normally be able to withstand standard manufacture packaging, storage and transportation processes.<br>
We are now able to provide such shaped products by the use of an ice confection having the mechanical properties as defined above.<br>
30 The ice confection will typically have an ice content of at least 30% by volume when measured at -18°C, more preferably<br>
13<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
at  least  40%  by  volume  when  measured  at  -18°C,  most preferably at least 50% by volume when  measured at -18°C.<br>
The ice content may be determined following the techniques 5  described in the article by B de Cindio and S Correra in the Journal of Food Engineering, Volume 24, pages 405-415, 1995. The enthalpy data required for this technique is obtained using adiabatic calorimetry (Holometrix Adiabatic Calorimeter) .  The ice contents as expressed herein are<br>
10  measured on an 80g sample poured into the sample holder of the calorimeter and cooled to -75°C by placing the assembly in dry ice prior to placing in the calorimeter (precooled to between -70°C and -80°C) .  The enthalpy data obtained was analysed to give ice content as a function of the<br>
15  temperature following the method of Cindio and Carrera.<br>
In general the ice confection has a total soluble solids<br>
content of less than 40% by weight, preferably less than 25%<br>
by weight, most preferably less than 15% by weight.  For low<br>
20  calorie products the total soluble solids content may be as<br>
 	low as, for example, approximately 5% by weight.<br>
The total soluble solids content is measured at 4 °C and is the % by weight of the total composition that is dissolved 25  at that temperature.<br>
It has further been observed that products according to the invention retain their structural integrity for longer when held at ambient temperatures.<br>

Examples<br>

The invention will now be illustrated by means of the following examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
15<br>
Four point bend test<br>
The standard four point bend test can be used to determine a number of mechanical properties of ice  confection materials. 20  The mechanical properties being measured are Young"s modulus (apparent) and flexure strength.<br>
In a bend test, a test piece is deformed whilst measuring the applied force and test piece deflection. A schematic 25  data set for an ice confection is shown in Figure 1. The" apparent elastic modulus is determined by the gradient of the initial linear part of this curve.<br>
The 4-point bend test requires production of a parallel 30  sided rectangular bar of ice confection material. This may be obtained by any suitable means.<br>
17<br><br>
VO 00/53026<br><br>
PCI7EP00/01757<br><br>
In  this  particular  application  the  parallel  sided rectangular bar of ice confection was made using aluminium moulds producing bars having the dimensions 25 x 25 x 200 5  mm.<br>
a)   Quiescent frozen ice confections<br>
The liquid ice confection pre-mix was poured into a mould<br>
10  which had been pre-cooled in a blast freezer at -35°C for at<br>
least 30 minutes, the mould was. then placed in a blast<br>
freezer at -35°C for at least 2 hours. The samples were then<br>
de-moulded and stored at -25°C until testing  (conducted<br>
after 5-6 days). 18 to 24 hours prior to testing the samples<br>
15  were equilibrated by storing at -18 °C, the temperature at<br>
which all tests were performed. A minimum of 10 bars was<br>
tested for each sample set and the mean value of each sample<br>
set was recorded as the value of the mechanical property<br>
being measured.<br>
20<br>
b)   Ice confections frozen with agitation<br>
The ice confection was extruded from the ice cream freezer (scraped surface heat exchanger) at a temperature of from<br>
25 -1°C to -5°C, depending on the ice confection, into a mould which had been pre-cooled in a blast freezer at -35 °C for at least 30 minutes, the mould was lined with silicon paper to prevent ice-metal adhesion. The sample was then prepared as above for quiescent frozen samples.<br>

The general test applied to all types of solids is described in "Biomechanics Materials.  A practical Approach" Ed. J.F.V. Vincent, Pub. IRL Press, Oxford University Press, Walton Street, Oxford, 1992 and "Handbook of Plastics Test 5  materials" Ed. R.P. Brown, Pub. George Godwin Limited, The Builder  Group, 1-3 Pemberton Row,  Fleet Street,, London, 1981.  Testing involves placing, each bar onto 2 supports and bending it until fracture by applying pressure from two upper supports, that are separated by 85mm, centrally on the 10  bar"s top surface.  The force applied in bending and the displacement of the moving contact is recorded throughout the test. The speed of descent of the moving support was 50mm per minute.<br>
The apparent elastic modulus of the material is given by the 15  equation;<br>
E = (0.21) .gradient.S3<br>
BD3 where the gradient is that shown in Figure 1, S is the span 20  (distance) between the supporting contacts beneath the test bar, B  is the width of the bar and D  is the depth of the bar.<br>

Method of determining whether an AFP possesses ice recrystallisation inhibition properties.<br>
Recrystallisation inhibition properties can measured using a<br>
10  modified "splat assay" (Knight et al, 1988). 2.5 pl of the solution under investigation in 30% (w/w) sucrose is transferred onto a clean, appropriately labelled,. 16 mm circular coverslip. A second coverslip is placed on top of the drop of solution and the sandwich pressed together<br>
15  between finger and thumb. The sandwich is dropped into a bath of hexane held at -80°C in a box of dry ice. When all sandwiches have been prepared, sandwiches are transferred from the -80°C hexane bath to the viewing -chamber containing hexane held at -6°C using forceps pre-cooled in the dry ice.<br>
20  Upon transfer to -6°C, sandwiches can be seen to change from a transparent to an opaque appearance. Images are recorded by video camera and grabbed into an image analysis system (LUCIA, Nikon) using a 20x objective. Images of each splat are recorded at time = 0 and again after 60 minutes. The<br>
25  size of the ice-crystals in both assays is compared by<br>
placing the slides within a temperature controlled cryostat cabinet (Bright Instrument Co Ltd, Huntington, UK). Images of the samples are transferred to a Quantimet 520 MC image analysis system (Leica, Cambridge UK) by means of a Sony<br>
30  monochrome CCD videocamera. Ice crystal sizing was performed by hand-drawing around ice-crystal. At least 400 crystals<br>

were sized for each sample. The ice crystal size was taken as being the longest dimension of the 2D projection of each crystal. The average crystal size was determined as the number average of the individual crystal sizes. If the size 5  at 30-60 minutes is similar or only moderately (less than 10%) increased compared to the size at t=o, and/or the crystal size is less than 20 micrometer, preferably from 5 to 15 micrometer this is an indication of good ice recrystallisation inhibition properties 10<br>

Standard Vickers Hardness test.<br>
The Vickers Hardness test is an indentation test that involves pushing a pyramid shaped indentor into the surface of material and recording the force applied as a function of tip displacement. Force and displacement are measured during the indentation loading cycle and the unloading cycle.<br>
The  test  is	described  in  "Handbook  of  Plastics  Test<br>
materials" Ed.	R.P. Brown, Pub. George Godwin Limited, The<br>
Builder Group, 1-3 Pemberton Row, Fleet Street, London, 1981.<br>
The Vickers pyramid geometry is an engineering industry standard (BSi 427, 1990) . It has an apex an-gle at the tip of 136°. Hardness is determined as;<br>

PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
where Hv is the Vickers Hardness, Fmax is the maximum applied force (see figure 2) and A is the projected area of the indentation left in the material"s surface. The area A is 5 determined by assuming the indentation has the same geometry as the indentor that formed it, i.e. a Vickers pyramid, and therefore the projected area can be determined from the indent depth given by d±  in figure 2.<br>
10 A = 24.5d2<br>
The Vickers Hardness of a material is a measure of the material"s resistance to plastic deformation.<br>
The test samples were 500ml blocks, manufactured by extruding the ice confection (typically at a temperature of from -1°C to -5°C) from a scraped surface heat exchanger into standard 500ml packets and then placing the packets into a blast freezer at -35°C for two hours prior to storage at -25°C. Prior to testing the . samples were equilibrated overnight at the required test temperature of -18°C.<br>
Measurements were conducted on a universal testing machine made by Instron (code 4500), within a temperature controlled 25 cabinet at -18°C. The crosshead speed was 2.0mm/min. The maximum load was 95N. The pyramid tip pushed into the surface of the material to a depth of 1.5mm for a water ice and 2.5mra for an ice cream.<br>

Measurement of Contiguity<br>
Contiguity is measured using microstructural images of the ice confection using cryogenic Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Structures are imaged using the technique described in "A low temperature scanning electron microscopy study of ice cream. I. Techniques an general microstructure" Food Structure Vol. 11 (1992), pp 1-9.<br>
In a particulate composite, the Contiguity of the particulate phase is defined as the ratio of the particle to particle interface area divided by the total internal interface area. It is a measure of the degree of network formation of the particulate phase. In ice confections the particles are ice crystals within the matrix and thus contiguity of the ice is defined as;<br><br>
where Cii is the contiguity, Aii is the total interfacial surface area of ice-ice interfaces and Aim is the interfacial surface area of ice-matrix interfaces. Contiguity can be measured from microstructural images of random planar surfaces cut through the material. Cryo-SEM images of flat fracture surfaces of unaerated ice confection are sufficient for this.<br>
23<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
By placing an array of lines on the image of the microstructure, the number of intercepts of these lines with ice-ice and ice-matrix interfaces are counted and combined in the following equation, to give the contiguity; 5<br><br>
where Nii = number per unit length of ice-ice intercepts and Nim  = number per unit length of ice-matrix intercepts. 10<br>
Ideally, approximately 800 interfaces were counted from a total of 5 images that are representative of each sample"s structure.<br>
15  To determine contiguity, two sets of measurements were taken from each image. After placing a regular set of lines onto the image, the number of intercepts of the ice-matrix and ice-ice interfaces with these lines were counted, only including all obvious ice-ice interfaces. The count was then<br>
20  repeated, but this time with all possible ice-ice interfaces included. As such, a maximum ice contiguity measurement and a minimum ice contiguity measurement was made for each image. The mean of these figures is then taken as the contiguity value.<br>

Measurement of Euler-Poincare characteristic<br>
5  The Euler-Poincare characteristic is measured using<br>
microstructural images of the ice confection using cryogenic Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).  Structures are imaged using the technique described in "A low temperature scanning electron microscopy study of ice cream. I. Techniques on 10  general microstructure" Food Structure Vol. II (1992), pp 1-9.<br>
In a two-phase composite structure, the degree of continuity of one phase can be measured using the Euler-Poincare<br>
15  characteristic.  The lower value of the Euler-Poincare<br>
characteristic for a phase, the more continuous or connected that phase is within the microstructure.  The Euler-Poincare characteristic can be a positive or negative number.  The definition of the Euler-Poincare characteristic is given in<br>
20  "Unbiased estimation of the Euler-Poincare characteristic" . by B.P. Pinnamaneni, C. Lantuejoul, J.P. Hernot and J.L. Chermant, Acta Sterelogica, 1989, 8/2, pl€l-106.<br>
To measure the Euler-Poincare characteristic for ice in ice 25  confections, identification of the ice and,matrix phases on the microstructural images was performed and using an image analysis system, the ice phase Euler-Poincare characteristic was determined using a specifically written analysis program.  Whenever contrast in the images was insufficient 30  for the image analysis system to automatically distinguish<br>
ice and matrix separately, the interface between the two was<br>
25<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
identified manually, thus enabling accurate determination of the Euler-Poincare characteristic.<br>
The Euler-Poincare characteristic can be measured for ice in 5  an ice confection produced by any processing route.<br>

Aspect Ratio Measurement<br>
10<br>
Samples were equilibrated at -18°C in a Prolan environmental cabinet for approximately 12 hours. Microscopic slides were prepared by smearing a thin layer of ice confection from the centre of thin glass plates.<br>
15<br>
Each slide was transferred to a temperature controlled microscopic stage (at -18°C) where images of ice crystals (about 400 individual ice crystals) were collected and relayed through a video camera to an image storage and<br>
20  analysis system.<br>
The stored ice crystal images were highlighted manually by drawing around its perimeter which then highlights the whole crystal. Images of the highlighted crystals were then 25  measured using the image analysis software which counts the number of pixels required to complete the longest diameter (length), shortest diameter (breadth), the aspect ratio (length/breadth) .<br>
30  The average aspect ratio for the crystals was calculated.<br>

GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br>
WO 00/53026	PCT/EP00/01757<br>
ICE CONFECTION<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to novel ice confections. In particular the invention relates to novel ice confections containing an antifreeze protein.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
It is highly desirable to be able to manufacture ice confections having novel shapes, properties and/or textures. Until now, however the ability to provide such a high degree of novelty and interest to the products has been limited. In particular products have to be manufactured with the ability<br>
to survive packaging/ storage and distribution.<br><br>
We have now shown that inclusion of specific antifreeze proteins into selected ice confections results in the formation of a strong, close-packed continuous network of ice crystals within the ice confection. As a result the ice confection is provided with specific defined mechanical properties. Such ice confections have novel textures and/or properties. The novel features can be retained during packaging, storage and distribution.<br>
WO 98/04146 {Unilever) discloses that AFPs can be incorporated into frozen food products such as ice confections to provide desirable product properties providing that the product and processing conditions are varied such that the ice crystals provided in the product have an  aspect ratio of more, than 1.9, preferably from 1.9 to 3.0. The specific examples given are all aerated ice<br>
2<br><br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
cream compositions. As shown by comparative Examples A to C below, the addition of antifreeze proteins to aerated ice cream does not significantly change the mechanical properties of the ice cream. WO 98/04146 does not teach that 5  it is possible to provide specific ice confection products having novel mechanical properties.<br>
WO 96/39878 (The Pillsbury Company) discloses a method for making a frozen composition for storage, the method not 10  requiring a hardening step prior to storage. The frozen composition contains an antifreeze protein, in particular Type I AFP. Examples show the preparation of an aerated ice cream and an aerated frozen yogurt. As shown by comparative Examples A to C below, the addition of antifreeze proteins   15  to aerated ice cream does not significantly change the<br>
mechanical properties of the ice cream. WO 96/39878 does not teach that it is possible to provide specific ice confection products having novel mechanical properties.<br>
20  OS 5 118 792 (Warren et al) discloses the addition of fusion proteins, and in particular the fusion protein protein A-Saf5 into foods which are to be consumed frozen, for example, ice cream, frozen yogurt, ice milk, sherbet, popsicles and frozen whipped cream. No examples are given<br>
25  where a final ice confection product is provided containing such fusion proteins. It is shown in Example 3B that when a popsicle formulation is used within the "splat assay", growth of the ice crystals is restricted.<br>
1 30  Surprisingly we have now found that the addition of specific antifreeze proteins to defined ice confections, for example<br>
3<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
to water ices, ice milks, and unaerated ice cream, results in the formation of a strong, close-packed continuous network of ice crystals within the ice confection providing significant, advantageous changes to the mechanical 5  properties of the ice confection.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly the invention provides an ice confection<br>
comprising an antifreeze protein, wherein • 10  A modulus/original modulus &gt; 0.4,  and/or<br>
A strength/original strength &gt; 0.4, providing that when<br>
A modulus/original modulus  50MPa, and/or<br>
when A strength/original strength 
A strength &gt; 0.2MPa. 15<br>
Preferably A modulus/original modulus &gt; 0.4; providing that<br>
when A modulus /original modulus  90MPa.<br>
Most preferably A modulus/original modulus &gt; 1.0; providing<br>
that when A modulus/original modulus  20  lOOMPa.<br>
Preferably A strength/original strength &gt;  0.7.  Most preferably A strength/original strength &gt; 1.5.<br>
25  By modulus is meant the apparent elastic modulus (E) as<br>
determined using a four point bend test. Example 1 gives the standard procedure for performing a four point bend test.<br>
4<br><br>
WO00/53026	PCT/EP00/01757<br>
Therefore A modulus (AE) means the change in modulus between two ice confections whose formulation and process of manufacture are identical in all respects except that the first ice confection includes in its composition an 5  antifreeze protein, and the second ice confection has no antifreeze protein included in its composition (the control composition) . Original modulus (Eorig) is the modulus measured in the control composition.<br>
10  By strength is meant the flexure strength (Ou ) which can be defined as the maximum stress that a material can withstand, under the particular conditions. The flexure strength is given by the stress at a point of maximum force on the force versus displacement curve recorded during a four point bend<br>
15  test.<br>
Therefore strength   means the change in strength between two ice confections whose formulation and process of manufacture are identical in all respects except that the<br>
20  first ice confection includes in its composition an<br>
antifreeze protein, and the second ice confection has no antifreeze protein included in its composition (the control composition) . Original strength (Ou orig) is the modulus measured in the control composition.<br>
25<br>
In addition to changes in the apparent elastic modulus and flexure strength, an increase in product hardness is provided by the ice confections according to the invention. For ice confections frozen with agitation, for example in an<br>
30  ice cream freezer (such as a scraped surface heat<br>
5<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
exchanger), the increase in hardness can be measured using the Vickers hardness test- Details of the Vickers hardness test are given in Example 3.<br>
5  The degree to which the Vickers Hardness (HV)   of the ice confection is increased by the addition of the antifreeze protein depends in part on the ice content of the ice confection.<br>
10  However, generally  0.3, providing that when<br><br>
Preferably  providing that when<br><br>
15<br>
Most preferably either <br><br>
Where AHV is the change in Vickers Hardness between two ice 20  confections whose formulation and process of manufacture are identical in ail respects except that the first ice confection includes in its composition an antifreeze protein, and the second ice confection has no antifreeze protein included in its composition (the control 25  composition) . Hv orig   is the original Vickers Hardness measured in the control composition.<br>
By close-pack.ed contiimo-us network of ice crystals is meant that any given ice crystal is connected to at least one 30  other ice crystal.<br>
6<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
In unaerated ice confections which have been frozen with<br>
agitation, the degree of network formation can be measured<br>
	as contiguity. Contiguity is defined as the ratio of the<br>
- 5  particle to particle interface area divided by the total interface area. It is thus a measure of the degree of network formation of the particle phase. Example 4 shows a method for the measurement of contiguity.<br>
10  Unaerated ice confections according to the invention have a    contiguity of at least 0.2, as measured, by the test given in     Example 4, for an ice content of from 50-90%, preferably 54-85% by weight, when measured at -18°C.<br>
15  In unaerated ice confections which have been frozen by any means, the degree of network formation can be measured as<br>
    the Euler-Poincare characteristic of the ice phase. The<br>
Euler-Poincare characteristic is a measure of the degree of network formation of a particular phase. The lower and more<br>
20  negative the value of the Euler-Poincare characteristic, the greater the continuity of the phase in question. Example 5 shows a method for the measurement of the Euler-Poincare characteristic.<br>
25  Unaerated ice confections according to the invention have an ice phase Euler-Poincare characteristic of less than -150mm-2 as measured by the test given in Example 5 for an ice content of from 50-90%, preferably 54-85% by weight when measured at -18°C-<br>

WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
By antifreeze protein (AFP) is meant a protein which has significant ice recrystallisation inhibition properties as measured in accordance with Example 2.  The AFP provides an ice particle size upon recrystallisation of less than 20um, 5  more preferred from 5 to 15um.<br>
Preferably the ice confection comprises at least 0.0005% by weight antifreeze protein, more preferably 0.0025% by weight antifreeze protein. Typically the ice confection will 10  comprise from 0.0005% by weight to 0.005% by weight antifreeze protein.<br>
For some applications it may be advantageous to include a mixture of two or more different AFPs into the food product.<br>
15<br>
The AFP for use in products of the invention can be any AFP suitable for use in food products. Examples of suitable sources of AFP are for example given in the article "Antifreeze proteins and their potential use in frozen food<br>
20  products", Marylin Griffith and K. Vanya Ewart,<br>
Biotechnology Advances, vol 13, pp375-402, 1995  and in patent applications WO 98/04699, WO 9.8/04146, WO 98/04147, WO 98/04148 and WO 98/22591.<br>
25  The AFPs can be obtained from their sources by any suitable process, for example the isolation processes as described in the above mentioned documents.<br>
One possible source of AFP materials is fish. Examples of 30  fish AFP materials are antifreeze glycoproteins {AFGP) (for example obtainable from Atlantic cod, Greenland cod and<br>
8<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/017J<br><br>
Tomcod), Type I AFP (for example obtainable" from Winter flounder, Yellowtail flounder, Shorthorn sculpin and Grubby sculpin), Type II AFP (for example obtainable from Sea raven, Smelt and Atlantic herring) and Type III AFP (for example obtainable from Ocean Pout, Atlantic wolffish. Radiated shanny, Rock gunnel and Laval"s. eelpout). A preferred example of the latter type is described in WO 97/02343.<br>
Another possible source of AFP material are invertebrates. Also AFPs may be obtained from Bacteria.<br>
A third possible source of AFP material are plants. Examples of plants containing AFPs are garlic-mustard, blue wood aster, spring oat, winter cress, winter canola, Brussels sprout, carrot, Dutchman"s breeches, spurge, daylily, winter barley, Virginia waterleaf, narrow-leaved plantain, plantain, speargrass, Kentucky bluegrass, Eastern cottonwood, white oak, winter rye, bittersweet nightshade, potato, chickweed, dandelion, spring and winter wheat, triticale, periwinkle, violet and grass.<br>
Both natural occurring species may be used or species which have been obtained through genetic modification. For example micro-organisms or plants may be genetically modified to express AFPs and the AFPs may then be used in accordance to the present invention.<br>
Genetic manipulation  techniques may be used to produce AFPs. Genetic manipulation techniques may be used to produce AFPs having at least 80%, more preferred more than 95%, most<br>
9<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
preferred 100% homology to the AFPs directly obtained from the natural sources. For the purpose of the invention these AFPs possessing this high level of homology are also embraced within the term "AFPs". 5<br>
The genetic manipulation techniques may be used as follows: An appropriate host cell or organism would be transformed by a gene construct that contains the desired polypeptide. The nucleotide sequence coding for the polypeptide can be<br>
10  inserted into a suitable expression vector encoding the<br>
necessary elements for transcription and translation and in such a manner that they will be expressed under appropriate conditions (for example in proper orientation and correct reading frame and with appropriate targeting and expression<br>
15  sequences). The methods required to construct these<br>
expression vectors are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
A number of expression systems may be utilised to express 20  the polypeptide coding sequence. These include, but are not limited to, bacteria, yeast insect cell systems, plant cell culture systems and plants all transformed with the appropriate expression vectors.<br>
25  A wide variety of plants and plant cell systems can be<br>
transformed with the nucleic acid constructs of the desired polypeptides. Preferred embodiments would include, but are not limited to, maize, tomato, tobacco, carrots, strawberries, rape seed and sugar beet.<br>

Preferably the antifreeze protein is chosen such that it 5  gives an aspect ratio of more than 1.9 to the ice crystal, preferably from 1.9 to 3.0, more preferably from 2.0 to 2.9, even more preferred from 2.1 and 2.8 (see WO 98/04146). In particular antifreeze proteins which provide an aspect ratio of more than 1.9 to the ice crystal are the preferred AFP 10  for addition to aerated ice confections. Aspect ratio is<br>
defined as the maximum diameter of a particle divided by its minimum diameter. The aspect ratio can be determined by any suitable method. A preferred method is illustrated in the Examples (Example 6).<br>
For the purpose of the invention the preferred AFPs are derived from fish. Especially preferred is the use of fish proteins of the type III, most preferred HPLC 12 as described in our case WO 97/02343. In particular AFP type 20  III HPLC 12 is the preferred AFP for addition to aerated ice confections.<br>
Ice confections which show the required change in mechanical properties on the addition of the antifreeze protein include<br>
25 unaerated milk containing frozen confections such as ice-cream, frozen yoghurt, and frozen custard, aerated and unaerated sherbet and milk ice, as well as aerated and unaerated frozen confections which do not typically contain milk such as water ices, sorbet, granitas and frozen fruit<br>
30  purees.<br>

WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
Preferably the ice confection is selected from an unaerated ice cream, an unaerated or aerated water ice and an unaerated or aerated milk ice.<br>
5 Most preferably the ice confection is selected from an unaerated water ice, an aerated water ice or unaerated milk ice.<br>
By water ice is meant a frozen solution made essentially 10  from sugar, water,  fruit acid or other acidifying agent, colour, fruit or fruit flavouring.<br>
By unaerated is meant an ice confection having an overrun of less than 25% (equivalent to 0.2 volume fraction of air),<br>
15 preferably less than 10%(equivalent to 0.09 volume fraction of air). During the processing of the ice confection no deliberate steps such as whipping are undertaken to increase the gas content of the product. However, it should be realised that during normal methods for the preparation of<br>
20 non-aerated ice confections, low levels of gas or air may be incorporated into the product, for example due to the mixing conditions used.<br>
Ice confections having an antifreeze protein included in<br>
25  their composition, such that the mechanical properties of<br>
the ice confection are changed as defined, can provide many<br>
new interesting products having different shapes, textures<br>
and properties.<br>

WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
The ice confection containing the antifreeze protein may constitute the entire product or may be a component of a composite product.<br>
5 An example of a product which may be manufactured using ice confections having an antifreeze protein included in their composition, such that the mechanical properties of the ice confection are changed as defined, are shaped products which have a high degree of definition.<br>
10<br>
There is an increasing demand, particularly in children"s ice confections, to be able to provide products having complex shapes such as cartoon characters and the like, however to date such products cannot be produced having a<br>
15  high degree of definition. Further small protruding features such as hands or beaks are liable to break off during manufacture, packaging, storage or transportation.<br>
An example of what is meant by "high degree of definition" would be a product having protrusions which are typically greater than 3mm in length and may be as long as 5 cm or more, whilst having a thickness of only 1 to 5 mm. Such protrusions would not normally be able to withstand standard manufacture packaging, storage and transportation processes.<br>
We are now able to provide such shaped products by the use of an ice confection having the mechanical properties as defined above.<br>
30 The ice confection will typically have an ice content of at least 30% by volume when measured at -18°C, more preferably<br>
13<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
at  least  40%  by  volume  when  measured  at  -18°C,  most preferably at least 50% by volume when  measured at -18°C.<br>
The ice content may be determined following the techniques 5  described in the article by B de Cindio and S Correra in the Journal of Food Engineering, Volume 24, pages 405-415, 1995. The enthalpy data required for this technique is obtained using adiabatic calorimetry (Holometrix Adiabatic Calorimeter) .  The ice contents as expressed herein are<br>
10  measured on an 80g sample poured into the sample holder of the calorimeter and cooled to -75°C by placing the assembly in dry ice prior to placing in the calorimeter (precooled to between -70°C and -80°C) .  The enthalpy data obtained was analysed to give ice content as a function of the<br>
15  temperature following the method of Cindio and Carrera.<br>
In general the ice confection has a total soluble solids<br>
content of less than 40% by weight, preferably less than 25%<br>
by weight, most preferably less than 15% by weight.  For low<br>
20  calorie products the total soluble solids content may be as<br>
 	low as, for example, approximately 5% by weight.<br>
The total soluble solids content is measured at 4 °C and is the % by weight of the total composition that is dissolved 25  at that temperature.<br>
It has further been observed that products according to the invention retain their structural integrity for longer when held at ambient temperatures.<br>

Examples<br>
10<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by means of the following examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
15<br>
Four point bend test<br>
The standard four point bend test can be used to determine a number of mechanical properties of ice  confection materials. 20  The mechanical properties being measured are Young"s modulus (apparent) and flexure strength.<br>
In a bend test, a test piece is deformed whilst measuring the applied force and test piece deflection. A schematic 25  data set for an ice confection is shown in Figure 1. The" apparent elastic modulus is determined by the gradient of the initial linear part of this curve.<br>
The 4-point bend test requires production of a parallel 30  sided rectangular bar of ice confection material. This may be obtained by any suitable means.<br>
17<br><br>
VO 00/53026<br><br>
PCI7EP00/01757<br><br>
In  this  particular  application  the  parallel  sided rectangular bar of ice confection was made using aluminium moulds producing bars having the dimensions 25 x 25 x 200 5  mm.<br>
a)   Quiescent frozen ice confections<br>
The liquid ice confection pre-mix was poured into a mould<br>
10  which had been pre-cooled in a blast freezer at -35°C for at<br>
least 30 minutes, the mould was. then placed in a blast<br>
freezer at -35°C for at least 2 hours. The samples were then<br>
de-moulded and stored at -25°C until testing  (conducted<br>
after 5-6 days). 18 to 24 hours prior to testing the samples<br>
15  were equilibrated by storing at -18 °C, the temperature at<br>
which all tests were performed. A minimum of 10 bars was<br>
tested for each sample set and the mean value of each sample<br>
set was recorded as the value of the mechanical property<br>
being measured.<br>
20<br>
b)   Ice confections frozen with agitation<br>
The ice confection was extruded from the ice cream freezer (scraped surface heat exchanger) at a temperature of from<br>
25 -1°C to -5°C, depending on the ice confection, into a mould which had been pre-cooled in a blast freezer at -35 °C for at least 30 minutes, the mould was lined with silicon paper to prevent ice-metal adhesion. The sample was then prepared as above for quiescent frozen samples.<br>

The general test applied to all types of solids is described in "Biomechanics Materials.  A practical Approach" Ed. J.F.V. Vincent, Pub. IRL Press, Oxford University Press, Walton Street, Oxford, 1992 and "Handbook of Plastics Test 5  materials" Ed. R.P. Brown, Pub. George Godwin Limited, The Builder  Group, 1-3 Pemberton Row,  Fleet Street,, London, 1981.  Testing involves placing, each bar onto 2 supports and bending it until fracture by applying pressure from two upper supports, that are separated by 85mm, centrally on the 10  bar"s top surface.  The force applied in bending and the displacement of the moving contact is recorded throughout the test. The speed of descent of the moving support was 50mm per minute.<br>
The apparent elastic modulus of the material is given by the 15  equation;<br>
E = (0.21) .gradient.S3<br>
BD3 where the gradient is that shown in Figure 1, S is the span 20  (distance) between the supporting contacts beneath the test bar, B  is the width of the bar and D  is the depth of the bar.<br>
For these tests the span (5) was 170mm. 25<br>
With reference to Figure 1, the strength of a material under three point bend conditions, is -given as;<br>

Example 2 5<br>
Method of determining whether an AFP possesses ice recrystallisation inhibition properties.<br>
Recrystallisation inhibition properties can measured using a<br>
10  modified "splat assay" (Knight et al, 1988). 2.5 pl of the solution under investigation in 30% (w/w) sucrose is transferred onto a clean, appropriately labelled,. 16 mm circular coverslip. A second coverslip is placed on top of the drop of solution and the sandwich pressed together<br>
15  between finger and thumb. The sandwich is dropped into a bath of hexane held at -80°C in a box of dry ice. When all sandwiches have been prepared, sandwiches are transferred from the -80°C hexane bath to the viewing -chamber containing hexane held at -6°C using forceps pre-cooled in the dry ice.<br>
20  Upon transfer to -6°C, sandwiches can be seen to change from a transparent to an opaque appearance. Images are recorded by video camera and grabbed into an image analysis system (LUCIA, Nikon) using a 20x objective. Images of each splat are recorded at time = 0 and again after 60 minutes. The<br>
25  size of the ice-crystals in both assays is compared by<br>
placing the slides within a temperature controlled cryostat cabinet (Bright Instrument Co Ltd, Huntington, UK). Images of the samples are transferred to a Quantimet 520 MC image analysis system (Leica, Cambridge UK) by means of a Sony<br>
30  monochrome CCD videocamera. Ice crystal sizing was performed by hand-drawing around ice-crystal. At least 400 crystals<br>
20<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
were sized for each sample. The ice crystal size was taken as being the longest dimension of the 2D projection of each crystal. The average crystal size was determined as the number average of the individual crystal sizes. If the size 5  at 30-60 minutes is similar or only moderately (less than 10%) increased compared to the size at t=o, and/or the crystal size is less than 20 micrometer, preferably from 5 to 15 micrometer this is an indication of good ice recrystallisation inhibition properties 10<br>
Example 3<br>
Standard Vickers Hardness test.<br>
The Vickers Hardness test is an indentation test that involves pushing a pyramid shaped indentor into the surface of material and recording the force applied as a function of tip displacement. Force and displacement are measured during the indentation loading cycle and the unloading cycle.<br>
The  test  is	described  in  "Handbook  of  Plastics  Test<br>
materials" Ed.	R.P. Brown, Pub. George Godwin Limited, The<br>
Builder Group, 1-3 Pemberton Row, Fleet Street, London, 1981.<br>
The Vickers pyramid geometry is an engineering industry standard (BSi 427, 1990) . It has an apex an-gle at the tip of 136°. Hardness is determined as;<br>
30 <br>
21<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
where Hv is the Vickers Hardness, Fmax is the maximum applied force (see figure 2) and A is the projected area of the indentation left in the material"s surface. The area A is 5 determined by assuming the indentation has the same geometry as the indentor that formed it, i.e. a Vickers pyramid, and therefore the projected area can be determined from the indent depth given by d±  in figure 2.<br>
10 A = 24.5d2<br>
The Vickers Hardness of a material is a measure of the material"s resistance to plastic deformation.<br>
The test samples were 500ml blocks, manufactured by extruding the ice confection (typically at a temperature of from -1°C to -5°C) from a scraped surface heat exchanger into standard 500ml packets and then placing the packets into a blast freezer at -35°C for two hours prior to storage at -25°C. Prior to testing the . samples were equilibrated overnight at the required test temperature of -18°C.<br>
Measurements were conducted on a universal testing machine made by Instron (code 4500), within a temperature controlled 25 cabinet at -18°C. The crosshead speed was 2.0mm/min. The maximum load was 95N. The pyramid tip pushed into the surface of the material to a depth of 1.5mm for a water ice and 2.5mra for an ice cream.<br>

PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
Example 4<br>
Measurement of Contiguity<br>
Contiguity is measured using microstructural images of the ice confection using cryogenic Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Structures are imaged using the technique described in "A low temperature scanning electron microscopy study of ice cream. I. Techniques an general microstructure" Food Structure Vol. 11 (1992), pp 1-9.<br>
In a particulate composite, the Contiguity of the particulate phase is defined as the ratio of the particle to particle interface area divided by the total internal interface area. It is a measure of the degree of network formation of the particulate phase. In ice confections the particles are ice crystals within the matrix and thus contiguity of the ice is defined as;<br><br>
where Cii is the contiguity, Aii is the total interfacial surface area of ice-ice interfaces and Aim is the interfacial surface area of ice-matrix interfaces. Contiguity can be measured from microstructural images of random planar surfaces cut through the material. Cryo-SEM images of flat fracture surfaces of unaerated ice confection are sufficient for this.<br>
23<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
By placing an array of lines on the image of the microstructure, the number of intercepts of these lines with ice-ice and ice-matrix interfaces are counted and combined in the following equation, to give the contiguity; 5<br><br>
where Nii = number per unit length of ice-ice intercepts and Nim  = number per unit length of ice-matrix intercepts. 10<br>
Ideally, approximately 800 interfaces were counted from a total of 5 images that are representative of each sample"s structure.<br>
15  To determine contiguity, two sets of measurements were taken from each image. After placing a regular set of lines onto the image, the number of intercepts of the ice-matrix and ice-ice interfaces with these lines were counted, only including all obvious ice-ice interfaces. The count was then<br>
20  repeated, but this time with all possible ice-ice interfaces included. As such, a maximum ice contiguity measurement and a minimum ice contiguity measurement was made for each image. The mean of these figures is then taken as the contiguity value.<br>

Measurement of Euler-Poincare characteristic<br>
5  The Euler-Poincare characteristic is measured using<br>
microstructural images of the ice confection using cryogenic Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).  Structures are imaged using the technique described in "A low temperature scanning electron microscopy study of ice cream. I. Techniques on 10  general microstructure" Food Structure Vol. II (1992), pp 1-9.<br>
In a two-phase composite structure, the degree of continuity of one phase can be measured using the Euler-Poincare<br>
15  characteristic.  The lower value of the Euler-Poincare<br>
characteristic for a phase, the more continuous or connected that phase is within the microstructure.  The Euler-Poincare characteristic can be a positive or negative number.  The definition of the Euler-Poincare characteristic is given in<br>
20  "Unbiased estimation of the Euler-Poincare characteristic" . by B.P. Pinnamaneni, C. Lantuejoul, J.P. Hernot and J.L. Chermant, Acta Sterelogica, 1989, 8/2, pl€l-106.<br>
To measure the Euler-Poincare characteristic for ice in ice 25  confections, identification of the ice and,matrix phases on the microstructural images was performed and using an image analysis system, the ice phase Euler-Poincare characteristic was determined using a specifically written analysis program.  Whenever contrast in the images was insufficient 30  for the image analysis system to automatically distinguish<br>
ice and matrix separately, the interface between the two was<br>
25<br><br>
WO 00/53026<br><br>
PCT/EP00/01757<br><br>
identified manually, thus enabling accurate determination of the Euler-Poincare characteristic.<br>
The Euler-Poincare characteristic can be measured for ice in 5  an ice confection produced by any processing route.<br>
Example 6<br>
Aspect Ratio Measurement<br>
10<br>
Samples were equilibrated at -18°C in a Prolan environmental cabinet for approximately 12 hours. Microscopic slides were prepared by smearing a thin layer of ice confection from the centre of thin glass plates.<br>
15<br>
Each slide was transferred to a temperature controlled microscopic stage (at -18°C) where images of ice crystals (about 400 individual ice crystals) were collected and relayed through a video camera to an image storage and<br>
20  analysis system.<br>
The stored ice crystal images were highlighted manually by drawing around its perimeter which then highlights the whole crystal. Images of the highlighted crystals were then 25  measured using the image analysis software which counts the number of pixels required to complete the longest diameter (length), shortest diameter (breadth), the aspect ratio (length/breadth) .<br>
30  The average aspect ratio for the crystals was calculated.<br>
