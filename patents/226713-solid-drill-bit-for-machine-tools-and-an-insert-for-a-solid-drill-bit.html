				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a solid drill bit for machine<br>
tools, having a drill bit body and at least two inserts which are<br>
arranged at a radial distance from from one another in a<br>
respective insert seat of the drill bit body in the region of a<br>
chip flute, project with their front-end main cutting edges<br>
axially beyond the drill bit body and radially overlap one<br>
another in their active regions, the radially outermost insert,<br>
with its outer insert corner, which forms a diamter, and its<br>
outer insert corner, which forms a diameter, and its adjoining<br>
secondary cutting edge, projecting radially beyond the drill bit<br>
body* and the secondary cutting edge, starting from the insert<br>
corner* being inclined at a defined setting angle in its<br>
longitudinal extent in the direction of the drill bit body.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Drilling tools of this type having two essentially<br>
quadratic indexable inserts are known (W001/85375). The two<br>
quadratic inserts are arranged at different radial distances<br>
from one another. With their front-end main cutting edges, they<br><br>
project with « positive rake angle axially beyond the drill bit<br>
body. The inner invert has a pre-cutting action in the axial<br>
direction, the distance corresponding approximately to the radius<br>
of curvature in the region of the insert corners. The inclination<br>
of the secondary cutting edge of the outermost insert, at less<br>
than 3.2° * is selected in such a way that the secondary cutting<br>
edge forms a guide edge which, during the drilling operation,<br>
under the effect of a drifing force pointing radially outward*<br>
bears in a sliding manner, at least over part of its length,<br>
against the wall of the hole produced beforehand. When drilling<br>
through workpieces of ductile material using such solid drill<br>
bite, it has been found that a projecting burr is formed from the<br>
hole in the radius region, this burr often having to be removed<br>
subsequently. Burrs also occur during the spot drilling with such<br>
a solid drill bit. Tests have shown that, even by using inserts<br>
having rounded-off insert corners, to burr formation cannot be<br>
avoided.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Based therein, the object of the invention is to improve the<br>
known solid drill bit and its inverts to the effect that bun—<br>
free through-drilling is possible even in workpieces of ductile<br>
material.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The solution according to the invention is bused on the idea<br>
of designing the main cutting edge in such a way that a burr<br>
forming in the diameter region of the hole can be cut in the<br>
manner of a peeling or reaming operation. In order to achieve<br>
this, it is proposed according to the invention that the front-<br>
end main cutting edge of the outer insert be subdivided in its<br>
longitudinal extent into a radially inner working section and a<br>
rectilinear peeling section adjoining said working section on<br>
the outside and extending up to the outer insert corner, said<br>
sections enclosing an angle of 95° to 120° with one another.<br>
The working section leads during the drilling operation, while<br>
the peeling section follows up in the diameter region with a<br>
steep peeling angle. As a result, the workpiece in the vicinity<br>
of the diameter region, depending on the steepness of the setting<br>
angle, is divided into more or less fine marginal chips, so that<br>
a burr formation is avoided.<br>
A preferred configurationn of the invention provides for the<br>
working section of the main cutting edge, toward the peeling<br>
section, to be set at a positive setting angle of 2 to 10°<br>
relative to the imaginary end face, perpendicular to the drill bit<br><br>
axis, of the drill bit body, whereas the peeling section of the<br>
main cutting edge, toward the outer insert corner, is set at a<br>
positive setting angle of 72° to 87° relative to the and face<br>
of the drill bit body. The transition point between working<br>
section and peeling section of the main cutting edge may be<br>
rounded off conexly. In contrast to that, the outer insert corner<br>
should be of relatively sharp-edged design. In the region of the<br>
outer insert corner, the peeling section of the main cutting<br>
edge and the adjacent secondary cutting edge enclose an angle of<br>
160 to 175° with one another, the secondary cutting edge, in<br>
accordance with W001/85375, being expediently inclined with a<br>
setting angle of less than 3.2° in the direction of the drill<br>
bit body.<br>
A further advantageous configuration of the invention<br>
provides for a central section extending up to the inner insert<br>
corner to adjoin the preferably rectilinear working section of<br>
the front-end main cutting edge radially on the inside, this<br>
central section enclosing a sweepback angle of 160° to 175° with<br>
the working section and being set at a negative setting angle of<br>
3° to 18° relative to the end face of the drill bit body. The<br>
active region of the central section of the front-end main<br><br>
cutting edge of the outer insert is expediently overlapped by the<br>
front-end main cutting edge of the inner insert. This is<br>
therefore important because the inserts are preferably designed<br>
as indexable inserts having four identical main cutting edges,<br>
the central section of a first main cutting edge, during an<br>
indexing operation, being turned into the peeling section of an<br>
adjacent main cutting edge. It is therefore important that the<br>
central section of the outer insert remains free of wear during<br>
the drilling operation.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with<br>
reference to an exemplary embodiment shown schematically in the<br>
accompanying drawings in which *<br>
Fig. 1 shows a solid drill bit for machine tools with<br>
essentially quadratic indexable inserts in a dia-<br>
grammatic illustration;<br>
Figs 2a to c show a plan view and two cut-away side<br>
views of the solid drill bit according to Fig. If<br>
Fig. 3 shows a plan view of an indexable insert in an<br>
enlarged illustration;<br><br>
Figs. 4a and b shows two sectional illustrations along<br>
section lines A-A amd B-B in Fig. 3.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The tool shown in the drawing is intended as a solid drill<br>
bit for machine tools. It has an essentially cylindrical drill<br>
bit body 10 which is provided with two chip flutes 12, 14. A<br>
respective insert seat 16, 18 for accomodating an essentially<br>
quadratic indexable insert 20, 22 is provided at the front end of<br>
the chip flutes. The indexable inserts 20, 22 are each fastened<br>
to the drill bit body 10 by a countersunk head screw 26 which<br>
engages in a tapped hole 24 of the drill bit body 10.<br>
As can be seen from Figs. 2a to c, the inner indexable<br>
insert 20, with the inner insert corner 28 at its front-end main<br>
cutting edge 30, overlaps the drill axis 32* whereas the cuter<br>
indexable insert 22, with its main cutting edge 34 in the region<br>
of the outer insert corner 36 and with its outer secondary<br>
cutting edge 38, projects beyond the circumference of the drill<br>
bit body 10. In addition, the indexable inserts, with their main<br>
and secondary cutting edges, are arranged so as to be tilted<br><br>
relative to the drill bit body 10 in such a way that the main<br>
cutting edge, enclose a positive setting angle Of; αi 4º and αa= 2º,<br>
respectively, relative to a plane perpendicular to the drill<br>
axis, the indices 1 and a identifying the inner and outer<br>
inserts, respectively. Since the secondary cutting edge 38 is<br>
oriented perpendicularly to the adjacent maim cutting edge 34*<br>
the secondary cutting edge 38* in the exemplary embodintent<br>
shown, is inclined, starting from the insert corner 36, in its<br>
longitudinal extent in the direction of the drill bit body at a<br>
setting angle which corresponds to the angle αa . It can also be<br>
seen from Fig. 2a that the main cutting edge 34 of the outer<br>
indexable insert 22, in the direction of rotation, indicated by<br>
the arrow 40, about the drill axis 32, encloses with the main<br>
cutting edge 30 of the inner indexable insert 20 an angle which<br>
is smaller than 180° by the angle β . In the exemplary<br>
embodiment shown, the angle β is about 5° . Finally, it can be<br>
seen from Fig. 2b that the main cutting edge SO of the inner<br>
indexable insert 20 is at a pre—cutting distance d in front of<br>
the main cutting edge 34 of the outer indexable insert 22, this<br>
distance d being 0.23 mm in the exemplary embodiment shown. The<br>
angles αi , αa and β and the precutting distance d are<br><br>
selected in such a way that the drill, with a defined, radial<br>
drifting force, in the region of its outer secondary cutting edge<br>
38, bears in a sliding manner against the wall 42 of the produced<br>
hole.<br>
As can be seen in particular from Fig. 3 in conjunction with<br>
Fig. 2b) the main cutting edges 34 of the indexable inserts 22<br>
are subdivided in their longitudinal extent into a rectilinear<br>
working section 90 and an adjoining* rectilinear peeling section<br>
32 extending up to the first insert corner 36, said sections 50<br>
and 52, in the exemplary embodiment shown enclosing an angle of<br>
105 with another in the region of their rounded-off transition<br>
point 54. The peeling section 52 of the main cutting edge 34 and<br>
the adjacent secondary cutting edge 38 enclose an angle of 165°<br>
with one another. Adjoining the rectilinear working section 50 of<br>
each main cutting edge 34 is a central section 58 which extends<br>
up to the second insert corner 56 and encloses with the working<br>
section a sweepback angle 60 of 165° . The central section 58 of<br>
a first main cutting edge 34 has the function of a peeling<br>
section 52 upon indexing to the next main cutting edge 34.<br>
At the outer insert 22, subdivision of the main cutting edge<br>
34 into the working section 50 and the peeling section 52 has an<br>
important function, which in addition is essential to the<br><br>
invention. This is because it has been found that, during<br>
conventional us, of a main cutting edge 34 having an insert<br>
corner rounded off toward the secondary cutting edge 38 without<br>
peeling section 52, an undesirable burr formation occurs, in<br>
particular when drilling through ductile workpieces. The burrs<br>
must be removed, for example filed off, in an additions<br>
operation. The steeply running, rectilinear peeling section 92<br>
according to the invention, adjoining the working section 90 on<br>
the outside, ensures that stock is removed from the workpiece in<br>
a peeling manner in the diameter region while forming small<br>
chips. As a result, a burr formation is effectively avoided. The<br>
central section 58, set back at the sweepback angle, of the outer<br>
insert 22 is overlapped by the main cutting edge 30 of the<br>
leading inner insert 20 during the drilling operation and is<br>
thereby rendered ineffective. This is necessary so that the<br>
central section 58, which becomes the peeling section 92 when the<br>
insert 22 is indexed to the next main cutting edge 34, is not<br>
subjected to any wear during the drilling operation.<br>
It is possible in principle to also use the same inserts as<br>
inner inserts 20. In this case, dividing of chips, which is<br>
advantageous for the drilling operation, occurs in the region of<br>
the sweepback angle between working section 50 and central 58.<br><br>
In summery the following can be emphasized; the invention<br>
relates to a solid drill bit for machine tools. The solid drill<br>
bit has a drill bit body 10 and two indexable inserts 20, 22<br>
arranged at a radial distance from one another in a respective<br>
insert seat 16, 18 of the drill bit body 10 in the region of chip<br>
flute 12, 14. The indexable inserts 20, 22 have an essentially<br>
quadratic contour. They project with their front-end main cutting<br>
edges 30, 34 axially beyond the drill bit body 10 and overlap one<br>
another radially in their active region. The radially outer<br>
indexable insert 22, with its outer insert corner 36 and with its<br>
adjoining secondalry cutting edges 38 perpendicular to the<br>
relevant main cutting edge 34, projects radially beyond the<br>
circumference of the drill bit body. In order to permit burr—free<br>
through-drilling, the front-end main cutting edge 34 of the outer<br>
insert 22 is subdivided in its longitudinal extent into a<br>
radially inner working section 50 and a rectilinear peeling<br>
section 52 adjoining said working section 50 on the outside and<br>
extending up to the outer insert corner 36, said sections 50 and<br>
52 enclosing a setting angle of 95° to 120° with one another.<br>
In the fitted state, the peeling section 52, toward the outer<br>
insert corner 36, is accordingly set at positive setting angle of<br>
72° to 87° relative to the end face of the drill bit body.<br><br>
