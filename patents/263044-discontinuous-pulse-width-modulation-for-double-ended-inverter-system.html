DOUBLE-ENDED INVERTER SYSTEM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of United States provisional<br>
patent application serial number 60/952,776, filed July 30, 2007. The entire<br>
content of this provisional application is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate<br>
generally to vehicle drive systems, and more particularly, embodiments of the<br>
subject matter relate to hybrid vehicles having a double-ended inverter drive<br>
system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the power usage and complexity of the various<br>
electrical systems within automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles,<br>
such as hybrid, electric, and fuel cell vehicles.<br>
[0004] Many of the electrical components, including the electric motors<br>
used in such vehicles, receive electrical power from alternating current (AC)<br>
power supplies. However, the power sources (e.g., batteries) used in such<br>
applications provide only direct current (DC) power. Thus, devices known as<br>
"power inverters" are used to convert the DC power to AC power, which often<br>
utilize several of switches, or transistors, operated at various intervals to<br>
convert the DC power to AC power.<br><br>
[0005] Additionally, such vehicles, particularly fuel cell vehicles, often<br>
use two separate voltage sources (e.g., a battery and a fuel cell) to power the<br>
electric motors that drive the wheels. "Power converters," such as direct<br>
current-to-direct current (DC/DC) converters, are typically used to manage<br>
and transfer the power from the two voltage sources. Modern DC/DC<br>
converters often include transistors electrically interconnected by an inductor.<br>
By controlling the states of the various transistors, a desired average current<br>
can be impressed through the inductor and thus control the power flow<br>
between the two voltage sources.<br>
[0006] The utilization of both a power inverter and a power converter<br>
greatly increases the complexity of the electrical system of the automobile.<br>
The additional components required for both types of devices also increase the<br>
overall cost and weight of the vehicle. Accordingly, systems and methods<br>
have been developed for operating a motor coupled to multiple power sources<br>
without a DC/DC converter while maximizing the performance of the motor<br>
by utilizing dual inverter electrical systems.<br>
[0007] A significant source of power loss in a power inverter is the loss<br>
associated with modulating the switches or transistors (i.e., switching loss).<br>
Discontinuous pulse width modulation (DPWM) techniques have been<br>
developed in efforts to reduce switching loss in traditional single-inverter<br>
systems.<br>
[0008] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide methods and systems for<br>
using discontinuous pulse width modulation (DPWM) in a double-ended<br>
inverter system to reduce switching loss without compromising the benefits of<br>
a double-ended inverter system. Other desirable features and characteristics of<br>
the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed<br>
description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br><br>
[0009] A method is provided for controlling a double-ended inverter<br>
system having a first inverter and a second inverter, the second inverter having<br>
a first leg associated with a first phase current, a second leg associated with a<br>
second phase current, and a third leg associated with a third phase current.<br>
When the first phase current is greater than the second phase current and the<br>
third phase current and if the first phase current is greater than a desired<br>
second inverter current, the method comprises modulating the first leg at a<br>
first duty cycle and clamping the second leg and the third leg to a negative<br>
voltage rail of the second inverter. If the first phase current is less than the<br>
desired second inverter current, the method comprises clamping the first leg to<br>
a positive voltage rail of the second inverter and if the second phase current is<br>
greater than zero, clamping the third leg to the negative voltage rail and<br>
modulating the second leg at a second duty cycle.<br>

comprises modulating the first leg at a first duty cycle and clamping the<br>
second leg and the third leg to a negative voltage rail of the second inverter. If<br>
ia2 ≥ ib2 and ia2 ≥ ib2 and ia2 ≥idc2, the method further comprises modulating<br>
the second leg at a second duty cycle and clamping the first leg and the third<br>
leg to the negative voltage rail. If ia2 ≥ ib2 and ia2 ≥ ib2 and ia2 ≥idc2, the<br>
method further comprises modulating the third leg at a third duty cycle and<br>
clamping the first leg and the second leg to the negative voltage rail.<br>

inverter current. The method further comprises determining a second inverter<br><br>
switching function, wherein only a selected leg in the second inverter is<br>
modulated at a duty cycle, determining a first inverter switching function<br>
based on the second inverter switching function, and modulating the first<br>
inverter and the second inverter using the first inverter switching function and<br>
the second inverter switching function.<br>

[0023] FIG. 1 illustrates a vehicle, or automobile 10, according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The automobile 10 includes a chassis<br>
12, a body 14, four wheels 16, and an electronic control system 18. The body<br>
14 is arranged on the chassis 12 and substantially encloses the other<br>
components of the automobile 10. The body 14 and the chassis 12 may jointly<br>
form a frame. The wheels 16 are each rotationally coupled to the chassis 12<br>
near a respective corner of the body 14.<br><br>
[(№24] The automobile 10 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br>
utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel<br>
drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD), or all-wheel drive<br>
(AWD). The automobile 10 may also incorporate any one of, or combination<br>
of, a number of different types of engines, such as, for example, a gasoline or<br>
diesel fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFV) engine (i.e.,<br>
using a mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound (e.g., hydrogen<br>
and natural gas) fueled engine, a combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, and<br>
an electric motor.<br>
[0025] In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the automobile<br>
10 further includes a motor 20 (i.e., an electric motor/generator, traction<br>
motor, etc.), a first energy source 22, a second energy source 24, a power<br>
inverter assembly 26, and a radiator 28. The radiator 28 is connected to the<br>
frame at an outer portion thereof and although not illustrated in detail, includes<br>
multiple cooling channels that contain a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant), such as<br>
water and/or ethylene glycol (i.e., "antifreeze), and is coupled to the power<br>
inverter assembly 26 and the motor 20. In one embodiment, the power<br>
inverter assembly 26 receives and shares coolant with the motor 20. As shown<br>
in FIG. 1, the motor 20 may also include a transmission integrated therein<br>
such that the motor 20 and the transmission are mechanically coupled to at<br>
least some of the wheels 16 through one or more drive shafts 30.<br>
[0026] As shown, the first energy source 22 and the second energy source<br>
24 are in operable communication and/or electrically coupled to the electronic<br>
control system 18 and the power inverter assembly 26. Although not<br>
illustrated, the first energy source 22 and the second energy source 24 may<br>
vary depending on the embodiment and may be of the same or different type.<br>
In one or more embodiments, the first energy source 22 and second energy<br>
source 24 may each comprise a battery, a fuel cell, an ultracapacitor, or<br>
another suitable voltage source. A battery may be any type of battery suitable<br>
for use in a desired application, such as a lead acid battery, a lithium-ion<br><br>
battery, a nickel-metal battery, or another rechargeable battery. An<br>
ultracapacitor may comprise a supercapacitor, an electrochemical double layer<br>
capacitor, or any other electrochemical capacitor with high energy density<br>
suitable for a desired application.<br>
[0027] Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, a double-ended inverter system 32<br>
may be adapted to drive the motor 20 in accordance with one embodiment.<br>
The double-ended inverter system 32 includes the motor 20, the first energy<br>
source 22, the second energy source 24, the power inverter assembly 26, and a<br>
controller 34.<br>
[0028] The motor 20 is a multi-phase alternating current (AC) motor and<br>
includes a set of windings 36 (or coils), wherein each winding corresponds to<br>
one phase of the motor 20. In an exemplary embodiment, the motor 20 is a<br>
three-phase motor. However, some of the principles discussed herein may<br>
apply to a motor 20 with any number of phases, and may be modified<br>
accordingly as will be appreciated in the art. Although not illustrated, the<br>
motor 20 includes a stator assembly (including the coils), a rotor assembly<br>
(including a ferromagnetic core), and a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant), as will be<br>
appreciated by one skilled in the art. The motor 20 may be an induction<br>
motor, a permanent magnet motor, or any type suitable for the desired<br>
application.<br>
[0029] Referring again to FIG. 2, the power inverter assembly 26 includes<br>
a first inverter 38 and a second inverter 40, each including six switches (e.g.,<br>
semiconductor devices, such as transistors and/or switches) with antiparallel<br>
diodes (i.e., antiparallel to each switch). As shown, the switches in the<br>
inverters 38, 40 are arranged into three legs (or pairs), with legs 42, 44, and 46<br>
being in the first inverter 38 and legs 48, 50, and 52 being in the second<br>
inverter 40.<br>
[0030] A first of the windings 36 (i.e., phase a) of the motor 20 is<br>
electrically connected, at opposing ends thereof, between the switches of leg<br>
42 in the first inverter 38 and leg 52 in the second inverter 40. A second of the<br>
windings 36 (i.e., phase b) is connected between the switches of leg 44 in the<br><br>
first inverter 38 and leg 50 of the second inverter 40. A third of the windings<br>
36 (i.e., phase c) is connected between the switches of legs 46 and 48 as<br>
shown. In this configuration, the phase currents throughout the double-ended<br>
inverter system 32 are the same (i.e., for phase a current ia = ia! = ia2, etc.).<br>
[0031] Still referring to FIG. 2, the double-ended inverter system 32 may<br>
also include first and second capacitors 54 and 56 respectively connected in<br>
parallel with the first and second energy sources 22, 24 to smooth current<br>
ripple during operation. A positive voltage rail 58 of the second inverter 40 is<br>
associated with a positive voltage reference of the second energy source 24,<br>
and a negative voltage rail 59 of the second inverter 40 is associated with a<br>
negative voltage reference of the second energy source 24. The controller 34<br>
is in operable communication and/or electrically coupled to the first and<br>
second inverters 38, 40. The controller 34 is responsive to commands<br>
received from the driver of the automobile 10 (i.e., via an accelerator pedal)<br>
and provides commands to the first inverter 38 and the second inverter 40, as<br>
will be described, to control the output of the inverters 38, 40.<br>
[0032] Referring again to FIG. 1, the electronic control system 18 is in<br>
operable communication with the motor 20, the first energy source 22, the<br>
second energy source 24, and the power inverter assembly 26. Although not<br>
shown in detail, the electronic control system 18 may include various sensors<br>
and automotive control modules, or electronic control units (ECUs), such as<br>
an inverter control module (i.e., the controller 34 shown in FIG. 2) and a<br>
vehicle controller, and at least one processor and/or a memory which includes<br>
instructions stored thereon (or in another computer-readable medium) for<br>
carrying out the processes and methods as described below.<br>
[0033] During operation, the automobile 10 is operated by providing<br>
power to the wheels 16 with the motor 20 which receives power from the first<br>
energy source 22 and the second energy source 24 in an alternating manner<br>
and/or with the first energy source 22 and the second energy source 24<br>
simultaneously. In order to power the motor 20, DC power is provided from<br>
the first energy source 22 and the second energy source 24 to the first and<br><br>
second inverters 38, 40 respectively, which convert the DC power into AC<br>
power, as is commonly understood in the art. The first and second inverters<br>
38, 40 produce AC voltages across the windings 36 (or phases). As is<br>
commonly understood, the required voltages across the windings 36 of the<br>
motor 20 are dependent on the speed, commanded torque (i.e., commanded<br>
synchronous frame currents), and other motor parameters.<br>
[0034] FIG. 3 illustrates a control system 60 for operating a motor 20 in a<br>
double-ended inverter system 32 utilizing the principles described herein in<br>
accordance with one embodiment. High frequency pulse width modulation<br>
(PWM) may be employed by the controller 34 to modulate and control the<br>
inverters 38, 40 and manage the voltage produced by the inverters 38, 40. The<br>
control system 60 includes first and second PWM blocks 68 and 70, and the<br>
double-ended inverter system 32.<br>
[0035] The controller 34 provides a control algorithm that achieves<br>
desired power flow between the first and second energy sources 22, 24 while<br>
producing the commanded torque inside the motor 20. Although not shown,<br>
the control system 60 receives a torque command for the motor 20 from which<br>
the controller 34 may determine power commands for the first energy source<br>
22 (and/or the first inverter 38) and the second energy source 24 (and/or the<br>
second inverter 40), as well as synchronous frame currents for the windings 36<br>
within the motor 20 (i.e., a required or desired motor current).<br>
[0036] Many combinations of voltage across the windings 36 may produce<br>
the commanded torque in the motor 20 and achieve desired power flow to (or<br>
from) the energy sources 22, 24 and the motor 20. If the motor 20 does not<br>
require the maximum power output of one energy source 22 or 24, the extra<br>
power from the energy source 22 or 24 may be used to charge the other energy<br>
source 22 or 24. For illustrative purposes and the sake of brevity, it may be<br>
discussed as though the first energy source 22 produces excess power to<br>
charge the second energy source 24, however, it will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art that numerous alternative desired power flows are possible<br>
and this distinction is not limiting but made merely for reference purposes. An<br><br>
optimal operating point determines the modulating voltage across the<br>
terminals of the inverters 38, 40. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the<br>
art that conditions for determining an optimal operating point are left to the<br>
designer and will vary depending upon the application for which the motor 20<br>
is being used, along with the types of energy sources 22, 24 selected.<br>
[0037] The controller 34 provides the first and second PWM blocks 68<br>
and 70 with modulating voltage signals v* and v^ to generate PWM signals to<br>
operate the switches within the first and second inverters 38, 40 to cause the<br>
desired output voltages to be applied across the windings 36 within the motor<br>
20 to operate the motor 20 with the required torque. It will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art that the control system 60 can be further modified to<br>
incorporate appropriate feedback signals and other methods known in the art<br>
to control the inverters 38, 40, which are beyond the scope of this disclosure.<br>
[0038] FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an embodiment of a discontinuous pulse<br>
width modulation process. The various tasks performed in connection with<br>
this process may be performed by software, hardware, firmware, or any<br>
combination thereof. For illustrative purposes, the following description of<br>
this process may refer to elements mentioned above in connection with FIGS.<br>
1-3. In practice, portions of the process may be performed by different<br>
elements of the described system. It should be appreciated that the process<br>
may include any number of additional or alternative tasks, the tasks shown in<br>
FIG. 4 need not be performed in the illustrated order, and the process may be<br>
incorporated into a more comprehensive procedure or process having<br>
additional functionality not described in detail herein.<br>
[0039] Referring to FIG. 4, the controller may determine the desired (or<br>
required) output phase currents in order to produce a commanded torque in a<br>
motor (task 400). The controller may also determine a desired second inverter<br>
current in the second inverter bus in order to produce the desired power flow<br>
to/from the second energy source (task 402). In accordance with one<br>
embodiment, the controller may determine a switching function for the second<br>
inverter in order to produce the desired second inverter current in the second<br><br>
inverter bus (task 404). In an exemplary embodiment, the switching function<br>
is determined so only one leg in the second inverter is selected for modulating<br>
at a duty cycle, while the other two legs of the second inverter are clamped to<br>
either the positive voltage rail or the negative voltage rail (i.e., the other two<br>
legs are not modulated/switched). Clamping a leg to the positive voltage rail<br>
may be understood as turning on or switching on (i.e., by applying 'ON' state<br>
gate voltage to the electronic switch) the top switch of a switch pair such that<br>
current flows through the top switch and to/from the positive voltage rail while<br>
the other switch in the pair remains off. For example, referring to FIG. 2, the<br>
top switch in leg 52 may be switched on, such that current flows through the<br>
switch and the voltage level at point a2 is roughly equivalent to the voltage<br>
level of the positive voltage rail 58, the difference being the voltage drop<br>
across the switch (transistor - IGBT or diode based on the current flow<br>
direction). This may be represented by dn=\ or a duty cycle or switching<br>
function of 1. Conversely, clamping a leg to the negative voltage rail may be<br>
understood as switching on the bottom switch so current flows through the<br>
bottom switch and to/from the negative voltage rail. This may be represented<br>
by dn—0 or a duty cycle or switching function of 0.<br>
[0040] A clamped phase leg will not produce switching loss while<br>
clamped to a rail, thereby reducing the overall switching loss in the second<br>
inverter. In an exemplary embodiment, two of the three legs are clamped at<br>
any one time, meaning only one leg produces switching loss. Based on the<br>
second inverter switching function and the desired motor current, a first<br>
inverter switching function may be determined (task 406). In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the first inverter switching function essentially adjusts harmonic<br>
voltage components so the voltage across the motor remains sinusoidal and/or<br>
balanced as will be appreciated in the art. The controller may determine the<br>
first inverter switching function and may provide signals to modulate the first<br>
inverter accordingly (task 408).<br>
[0041] In an exemplary embodiment, during operation, the controller 34<br>
may be provided with a torque command (i.e., by the electronic control system<br><br>
18) and determine the peak phase current (Ip) required to produce the<br>
commanded torque (i.e., required output current). The controller may also<br>
determine a desired power flow to/from the second energy source, and from<br>
this, determine a desired second inverter current (jdc2) to charge/discharge the<br>
second energy source 24. The maximum second inverter current (idc2) that can<br>
be realized by linear modulation is as will be appreciated in the art.<br>
[0042] In an exemplary embodiment, when the magnitude of the second<br>
inverter 40 current (idc2) is less than one half of the peak AC phase current Ip<br>
  only one leg 48, 50, 52 in the second inverter 40 is<br>
switching while the other two legs are clamped to the negative voltage rail 59.<br>
A single phase current is capable of providing the second inverter current (idc2)<br>
when it is less than half the peak AC current. When two phase currents are<br>
equal, the respective leg 48, 50, 52 may be selected as desired, and the manner<br>
of resolving this situation is a matter of design preference as will be<br>
understood in the art. In accordance with one embodiment, the algorithm used<br>
to determine the switching function of the second inverter 40 when<br><br><br>
[0049] As shown in FIG. 5, in an exemplary embodiment, the desired<br>
motor phase a current (za) is greater than the other phase currents (h, ic) for<br>
one-third of a cycle (i.e., 120° or 2x/3 radians due to a balanced three-phase<br>
system). FIG. 6 shows the switching function of the second inverter 40 in this<br>
exemplary case using the process described above. For example, the leg 52 in<br>
the second inverter 40 corresponding to phase a may be switched at a duty<br>
cycle determined by dividing the desired second inverter current (idc2) by the<br>
inverter phase current and the other two legs 48 and 50 are<br>
clamped to the negative voltage rail 59 (db2 = 0,dc2 = 0). FIGS. 5-6 illustrate<br>
operation throughout an entire cycle (i.e., 360° or 2 radians). The desired<br>
second inverter current (law) flowing to the second energy source 24 is shown<br>
in FIG. 7.<br>
[0050] FIGS. 8-10 illustrate the voltage levels in the double-ended inverter<br>
system 32. In an exemplary embodiment, after the controller 34 determines<br>
the peak phase current Ip and the duty cycle/switching function for the second<br>
inverter 40, the controller 34 may determine a switching function for the first<br>
inverter 38. As shown in FIG. 9, the switching function and voltages of the<br>
first inverter 38 are not sinusoidal in an exemplary embodiment. DPWM<br>
techniques may be used to modulate the first inverter 38 to produce the desired<br>
voltage levels and reduce switching loss in the first inverter 38. As shown in<br>
FIG. 10, the resulting line voltages at the motor 20 are sinusoidal and free<br>
from any harmonics or distortion.<br>
[0051] In an exemplary embodiment, when the magnitude of the desired<br>
second inverter current (idc2) is greater than one half of the peak phase current<br>
  a selected phase current cannot supply the desired second<br>
inverter current (idc2) throughout an entire duration of a cycle. When a phase<br>
current (i.e., ia2) cannot supply the desired second inverter current (idc2),<br>
another leg 48, 50, 52 of the second inverter 40 associated with another phase<br>
current must be switched to achieve the desired DC current to/from the second<br><br>
energy source 24. In accordance with one embodiment, the selected leg 48,<br>
50, 52 is clamped to the positive voltage rail 58 during this interval. One of<br>
the other legs 48, 50, 52 is modulated at a duty cycle that compensates for the<br>
additional current required to maintain a constant second inverter current (idc2)<br>
level.<br>
[0052] In accordance with one embodiment, the algorithm used to<br>
determine the switching function of the second inverter 40 when <br>
may be characterized by:<br><br><br><br>
[0074] As shown in FIGS. 11-13, in an exemplary embodiment, the phase<br>
a current (ie) cannot supply the desired second inverter current (idc2)<br>
throughout the entire duration of the interval where the phase a current is<br>
greater than the other two phases (i.e., 120° or 2x/3 radians as shown). In FIG.<br>
11, the phase a current (ia) exceeds the desired second inverter current (idc2)<br>
for a portion of the interval (from 30° to 90°). During this interval, the phase<br>
a current (ia) can supply the desired second inverter 40 current (idc2).<br>
Therefore, for example, the leg 52 in the second inverter 40 associated with<br>
phase a is switched at a duty cycle determined by dividing the desired second<br>
inverter current by the phase a current while the other two legs 48<br>
and 50 are clamped to the negative voltage rail 59 ( db2 = 0, dc2 = 0 ).<br>
[0075] When the phase a current (ia) cannot supply the desired second<br>
inverter current (idc2), another leg 48, 50 of the second inverter 40 must be<br>
switched in order to maintain the desired DC current level to/from the second<br>
energy source 24. In an exemplary embodiment, the phase a leg 52 is clamped<br>
to the positive voltage rail 58 during this interval. The other legs 48, 50 are<br>
modulated at a duty cycle that compensates for the additional current required<br>
to maintain a constant level. In the exemplary embodiment, if the phase c<br>
current (ic) is greater than zero (from 0° to 30° as shown), the leg 50<br><br>
associated with phase b is clamped to the negative voltage rail 59 while the leg<br>
48 associated with phase c is modulated at a duty cycle (dc2) determined by<br>
  When the phase b current (ib) is greater than zero (from 90° to<br>
120° as shown), the leg 48 associated with phase c is clamped to the negative<br>
voltage rail 59 while the leg 50 associated with phase b is modulated at a duty<br>
cycle (db2) determined by   FIG. 12 illustrates the resulting<br>
second inverter switching function and FIG. 13 illustrates the second inverter<br>
current (idc2).<br>
[0076] FIGS. 14-16 show the voltage levels in the double-ended inverter<br>
system 32 in an exemplary embodiment. As discussed above, the controller<br>
34 may determine the peak phase current Ip and the duty cycle/switching<br>
function for the second inverter 40, based upon which the controller 34 may<br>
determine a switching function for the first inverter 38. Again, as shown in<br>
FIG. 15, the switching function and voltages of the first inverter 38 are not<br>
sinusoidal in an exemplary embodiment. DPWM techniques may be used to<br>
modulate the first inverter 38 to produce the desired motor current and reduce<br>
switching loss in the first inverter 38. As shown in FIG. 16, the resulting line<br>
voltages at the motor 20 are sinusoidal and free from any harmonics or<br>
distortion.<br>
[0077] FIGS. 17 illustrates operating characteristics of a conventional<br>
DPWM technique and FIG. 18 illustrates the switching power loss associated<br>
with the switching function of FIG. 17 for an exemplary case. FIG. 19<br>
illustrates operating characteristics of the DPWM technique discussed herein<br>
and FIG. 20 illustrates the switching power loss associated with the switching<br>
function of FIG. 19 for an exemplary case. For the exemplary case shown, the<br>
average power loss is reduced from 1800W to 1680W when the methods<br>
discussed herein are applied.<br>
[0078] The system and/or method described above provides an electrical<br>
system to power the motor 20 with two separate energy sources 22, 24 while<br><br>
reducing the switching loss when compared to conventional DPWM<br>
techniques. Other features of a double-ended inverter system 32, such as<br>
various power flows or power transfer, may also be achieved. As described<br>
above, the performance of the motor 20 is not impaired and the commanded<br>
torque may still be generated within the motor 20, while allowing excess<br>
power to flow between the energy sources 22, 24.<br>
[0079] Other embodiments may utilize the system and method described<br>
above in different types of automobiles, different vehicles (e.g., watercraft and<br>
aircraft), or in different electrical systems altogether, as it may be<br>
implemented in any situation where the voltages of the two sources<br>
dynamically change over a wide range. The motor 20 and the inverters 38, 40<br>
may have different numbers of phases, and the systems described herein<br>
should not be construed as limited to a three-phase design. The basic<br>
principles discussed herein may be extended to higher-order phase systems as<br>
will be understood in the art. Other forms of energy sources 22, 24 may be<br>
used, such as current sources and loads including diode rectifiers, thyristor<br>
converters, fuel cells, inductors, capacitors, and/or any combination thereof.<br>
[0080] For the sake of brevity, conventional techniques related to signal<br>
processing, data transmission, signaling, network control, and other functional<br>
aspects of the systems (and the individual operating components of the<br>
systems) may not be described in detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting<br>
lines shown in the various figures contained herein are intended to represent<br>
exemplary functional relationships and/or physical couplings between the<br>
various elements. It should be noted that many alternative or additional<br>
functional relationships or physical connections may be present in an<br>
embodiment of the subject matter.<br>
[0081] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br>
of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the<br>
scope, applicability, or configuration of the claimed subject matter in any way.<br><br>
Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art<br>
with a convenient road map for implementing the described embodiment or<br>
embodiments. It should be understood that various changes can be made in<br>
the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the scope<br>
defined by the claims, which includes known equivalents and foreseeable<br>
equivalents at the time of filing this patent application.<br><br>
