				<td>ANTENNA ARRANGEMENT<br>
The invention relates to an antenna arrangement<br>
according to the precharacterizing clause of Claim 1.<br>
The mobile radio antennas which are provided for a base<br>
station normally in particular have an antenna<br>
arrangement with a reflector in front of which a large<br>
number of antenna elements are provided, which are<br>
offset with respect to one another in the vertical<br>
direction, and thus form an array. These antenna<br>
elements may, for example, transmit and receive in one<br>
or two mutually perpendicular polarizations. The<br>
otenna elements may in this case be designed to<br>
Lve in only one frequency band. However, the<br>
ma arrangement may also be designed as a multiband<br>
antenna, for example for transmitting and receiving two<br>
frequency bands which are offset with respect to one<br>
another. What are referred to as triband antennas are<br>
also in principle known.<br>
As is known, mobile radio networks are in the form of<br>
cells, with each cell having an associated<br>
corresponding base station with at least one mobile<br>
radio antenna for transmitting and receiving. The<br>
antennas are in this case constructed such that they<br>
generally transmit and receive with a main lobe which<br>
oints downwards at a specific angle with respect to<br>
the horizontal, thus defining a specific cell size.<br>
This depression angle is also, referred to, as is known,<br>
as the down-tilt angle.<br>
A phase shift arrangement for this purpose has already<br>
been proposed in WO 01/13459 Al, in which the down-tilt<br>
angle of a single-column antenna array having two or<br>
more antenna elements which are arranged one above the<br>
other can be adjusted continuously and differently.<br>
According to this prior publication, difference phase<br><br>
shifters are used for this purpose, which, when set<br>
differently, result in the delay time length and hence<br>
the phase shift at the two outputs of each phase<br>
shifter being adjusted in different directions, thus<br>
allowing the down-tilt angle to be set.<br>
In this case, the setting and adjustment of the phase<br>
shifter angle can be carried out manually or by means<br>
of a retrofitted unit which can be remotely controlled<br>
as is known, for example, from DE 101 04 564 Cl.<br>
Although, in principle, the setting of different down-<br>
tilt angles by varying the phase angle which is<br>
supplied to the individual antenna elements has been<br>
roven, the object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a solution which is different to this and is at<br>
the same time simplified for setting different<br>
transmission angles, in particular down-tilt angles,<br>
and/or to provide new capabilities for adjusting the<br>
transmission angle.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved on<br>
the basis of the features specified in Claim 1.<br>
Advantageous refinements of the invention are specified<br>
in the dependent claims.<br>
According to the present invention, the phase can be<br>
adjusted continuously between two limit values without<br>
any problems. Within the scope of the invention, this<br>
can be done solely by appropriate power splitting. If,<br>
however, the signals which are supplied to the<br>
individual antenna elements are also shifted in time in<br>
addition to power splitting, then it is even possible<br>
to scan beyond the range of the system lobes.<br>
The invention is in this case based on an antenna which<br>
has at least two antenna element systems, also referred<br>
to below as antenna element arrays, with each antenna<br><br>
element array being composed of at least one individual<br>
antenna element, but generally of two or more<br>
individual antenna elements, with the at least two<br>
antenna element arrays being arranged offset with<br>
respect to one another and in this case transmitting<br>
and receiving in at least one polarization plane. If,<br>
for example, one antenna element in one antenna element<br>
array is set to a down-tilt angle of 0° and a second<br>
antenna element in the second antenna element array is<br>
set pointed downwards at a down-tilt angle of 10° with<br>
respect to the horizontal, then the antenna arrangement<br>
according to the invention allows any desired angle to<br>
be set in a continuously variable manner, that is to<br>
may any desired down-tilt angle in between. If the time<br>
it between the signals which are supplied to the<br>
antenna elements is also taken into account, it is<br>
possible to scan beyond the range of the two system<br>
lobes.<br>
In detail, this is achieved according to the invention,<br>
in that one input signal is split between various<br>
Antenna elements, that is to say between the at least<br>
two antenna elements which are provided with an offset<br>
with respect to one another, with the individual<br>
components of the (correlated) signals being supplied<br>
to the antenna elements with different amplitudes. If<br>
the total energy is supplied, for example, only to the<br>
upper antenna element, which transmits at 0° with<br>
respect to the horizontal, then all of the transmitted<br>
energy is contained in the main lobe in the horizontal<br>
direction. If the total intensity is supplied to the<br>
lower antenna element device which, by way of example,<br>
has been preset to a down-tilt angle of 10°, then all<br>
the transmission energy is contained in the main lobe<br>
at this down-tilt angle of 10°. If the energy is now<br>
continuously diverted to an increased extent from one<br>
antenna element to the other, so that the two antenna<br>
element arrays or at least the two antenna elements are<br><br>
supplied with different proportions, then the intensity-<br>
split of the energy which is supplied to the at least<br>
two antenna elements results in the alignment of the<br>
main lobe being varied continuously and, in the<br>
explained example, it can thus be varied between 0° and<br>
a maximum of 10° with different transmission angles<br>
with respect to the horizontal plane. If, however, the<br>
signals are also shifted laterally in addition to<br>
splitting the power between the two individual signals,<br>
then, - as has already been mentioned - it is also<br>
possible to scan beyond the range of the two system<br>
lot es.<br>
In comparison to conventional antennas, the antenna<br>
array loads the antenna elements in a considerably<br>
narrower manner, preferably by a factor of 2. The<br>
vertically arranged antenna elements are preferably<br>
associated alternately with the two antenna element<br>
arrays, that is to say, by way of example, the<br>
lowermost antenna element is associated by means of the<br>
with the first antenna element array, the antenna<br>
ant located above it is associated with the second<br>
antenna element array, the third antenna element from<br>
the bottom is once again associated with the first<br>
antenna element array, etc. The two antenna element<br>
arrays are also referred to as sub-arrays.<br>
If the corresponding antenna elements or their<br>
polarization directions are aligned vertically, then<br>
this makes it possible to set different down-tilt<br>
angles. If the antenna elements are aligned such that<br>
they are offset in the horizontal direction alongside<br>
one another or their antenna element or polarization<br>
plane is aligned in the horizontal direction, then the<br>
continuous different intensity supply of the signal<br>
allows a different angle setting to be produced in the<br>
azimuth direction and not in the elevation direction.<br>
In this case as well, scanning beyond the range of the<br><br>
two system lobes is once again possible by taking into<br>
account an additional time shift in addition to the<br>
pure power splitting.<br>
If, however, an antenna array having at least two<br>
columns and having at least two antenna elements in<br>
each column is used, by way of example, then<br>
perimposed adjustment can be carried out both in the<br>
partical direction and in the horizontal direction, in<br>
order to appropriately align the main lobe in space,<br>
with this all being done just by supplying different<br>
intensities, that is to say by feeding the signal with<br>
a different intensity for the individual antenna<br>
elements. Different phase angles are also feasible.<br>
The solution according to the invention is, of course,<br>
in principle also possible for use for antenna elements<br>
which transmit and receive using two mutually<br>
perpendicular polarizations and in the process are<br>
referably aligned at angles of +45° and -45° with<br>
spect to the horizontal (or vertical) . The principle<br>
-an likewise be used not only for a single band antenna<br>
but also for a multiband antenna which has appropriate<br>
antenna elements for 2, 3 etc., frequency bands.<br>
In this case, furthermore, it is also possible to<br>
change the limit value which is defined by the basic<br>
setting of the antenna elements, for example by<br>
mechanical adjustment and possibly also by different<br>
angular settings, mechanically by remote control.<br>
Furthermore, by additionally using different phase<br>
settings, it is possible to set an upper or lower limit<br>
value for the antenna arrangement differently such that<br>
the different intensity supply once again makes it<br>
possible to produce any desired intermediate value for<br>
the main lobe alignment between the limit values<br>
predetermined in this way.<br><br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, an<br>
appropriate antenna arrangement is fed by means of a<br>
network which splits the power between the antenna<br>
elements that are provided. This may be done, for<br>
example, in conjunction with a phase shifter which, in<br>
the simplest case, is once again in the form of a<br>
difference phase shifter which, for example, interacts<br>
with a 3 dB 90° hybrid. The signals are applied to the<br>
input of the hybrid with the same amplitude but with<br>
different phases. This results in the signals at the<br>
output of the network being in phase, but with<br>
different amplitudes. This therefore makes it possible<br>
provide a feed with the same phase but with<br>
different amplitudes by the different chase control, by<br>
means of different settings of the se shifter that<br>
is upstream of the network.<br>
However, not only is it possible to arrange the<br>
individual antenna elements vertically and join them<br>
together to form antenna element arrays, for example<br>
with an alternating split, but the antenna elements or<br>
antenna element array can also be arranged alongside<br>
one another, rather than one above the other. In<br>
principle, other arrangements are also feasible which<br>
differ from an arrangement which is offset only<br>
vertically or only horizontally. In consequence, the<br>
usefulness of the invention is not just restricted to a<br>
variable or fixed change to the vertical alignment of<br>
the polar diagram, but in principle an arrangement for<br>
control of the horizontal alignment of the antenna lobe<br>
can also be provided. For example, in this way, it is<br>
possible to produce antennas and antenna systems which<br>
produce two horizontal polar diagrams, depending on the<br>
circuitry of a network. In a similar way to the<br>
splitting of the power for the vertical case, it is<br>
possible to use a suitable additional network to set<br>
the overall alignment between the directions of the two<br>
individual lobes in a continuously variable manner when<br><br>
the antenna elements are arranged horizontally, as<br>
well. If phase shifting is also used in addition to<br>
pure power splitting, that is to say a time shift is<br>
produced between the signals, then scanning can be<br>
carried out beyond the two system lobes both in the<br>
horizontal direction and in the vertical direction. An<br>
appropriate combination of vertical and horizontal<br>
control in this case also makes it possible to produce<br>
a continuously variable alignment in space.<br>
Further advantages, details and features of the<br>
invention will become evident in the following text<br>
from the exemplary embodiment which is illustrated in<br>
the accompanying drawings, in which, in detail:<br>

different setting for a lobe which is<br>

set differently in the azimuth and elevation<br>
directions;<br>
Figure 7 shows a schematic view of a further<br>
exemplary embodiment; and<br>
Figure 8 shows a further schematic exemplary<br>
embodiment of an antenna system with antenna<br>
elements which are arranged alternately one<br>
above the other, with the two antenna<br>
element arrays each being provided with<br>
individual antenna elements or antenna<br>
element groups which follow one another<br>
alternately, and the associated reflectors<br>
in at least one antenna element group being<br>
aligned at a different angle to the<br>
reflectors in the other antenna element<br>
group.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic front view of an antenna<br>
arrangement with a vertically aligned reflector 1, in<br>
front of which two antenna element devices 3 are<br>
arranged vertically one above the other. In the<br>
illustrated exemplary embodiment, each of the two<br>
antenna element devices 3 is formed from an antenna<br>
element array 3.1 or 3.2, which, in the exemplary<br>
embodiment shown, each comprise a dipole antenna<br>
element 3.1 or 3.2, respectively, aligned vertically.<br>
The antenna arrangement thus transmits and receives in<br>
a vertical polarization plane, in one frequency band.<br>
Figure 2 likewise shows, illustrated purely<br>
schematically, a side view of the antenna arrangement<br>
shown in Figure 1, in order to illustrate the principle<br>
according to the invention. The two antenna element<br><br>
devices 3 are in this case in the exemplary embodiment<br>
explained, preset (for example by mechanical alignment)<br>
in the factory for example (fixed) such that the upper<br>
antenna element device 3.1 transmits and receives<br>
exactly in the horizontal direction, and the lower<br>
antenna element device 3.2 transmits and receives<br>
inclined downwards with a down-tilt angle a of 10° with<br>
respect to the horizontal plane, for example. This<br>
presetting can likewise be permanently set by<br>
appropriate mechanical prior adjustment. The main lobes<br>
7.1	and 7.2 of the two antenna element devices 3.1 and<br>
3.2	are shown in Figure 2, as is the respectively<br>
associated horizontal plane 11.<br>
the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the antenna<br>
arrangement formed in this way is fed by a network 13<br>
which, in the illustrated exemplary embodiment,<br>
comprises a hybrid circuit 15, for example a 3dB 90°<br>
hybrid, which is preceded by a phase st fter 17, in the<br>
illustrated exemplary embodiment a difference phase<br>
shifter 17.<br>
The control process in the illustrated exemplary<br>
embodiment will be explained in the following text,<br>
assuming a basic setting in which the phase shifter 17<br>
is in its neutral mid-position, with the signals coming<br>
from the phase shifter being applied with the same<br>
amplitude to the respective inputs 15a and 15b of the<br>
hybrid circuit 15. When the phase shift 17 is in its<br>
central initial or neutral position, then the signals<br>
at the two inputs 15a and 15b of the hybrid circuit 15<br>
also have the same phase angle.<br>
If, however, the phase shifter is now shifted from the<br>
central neutral position to the left or right, for<br>
example as illustrated by the arrow 19, then the phase<br>
angle at the input 15a is not the same as that at the<br>
input 15b, solely because the signal coming from the<br><br>
phase shifter in the input branch 19a arrives earlier<br>
if the electrical line is shortened, and that in the<br>
second branch 19b it arrives later, since the path<br>
length is longer and the delay time resulting from this<br>
is greater. This means that the corresponding signals<br>
are now once again produced with the same phase angle<br>
but with different amplitudes at the output of the<br>
network, that is to say at the output 15'a and 15'b. If<br>
hese signals, which are now in phase, are passed with<br>
the corresponding different amplitudes to the two<br>
antenna element arrays, that is to say to the antenna<br>
element device or antenna elements 3.1 and 3.2, then,<br>
depending on the position of the phase shifter, the<br>
upper antenna element array 3.1 or the lower antenna<br>
element array 3.2, that is to say, in the present case,<br>
the upper antenna element device or the upper antenna<br>
element 3.1 or the lower antenna element device, or the<br>
lower antenna element 3.2, in each case receives a<br>
different, larger or smaller proportion of the<br>
intensity of the signal that is fed in.<br>
If the entire intensity of the signal were to be fed<br>
exclusively just to the upper antenna element device<br>
3.1,	then the explained antenna arrangement would<br>
transmit and receive exactly in the horizontal<br>
direction (since the lower antenna element device 3.2<br>
is not supplied with any energy at all). If the entire<br>
feed signal were supplied exclusively to the lower<br>
antenna element device 3.2, then the entire antenna<br>
array would transmit exactly at the down-tilt angle a<br>
of, for example, 10° in the illustrated exemplary<br>
embodiment. If, however, the signal is now supplied<br>
with different intensities to both the upper antenna<br>
element array 3.1 and the lower antenna element array<br>
3.2,	then, depending on the position of the phase<br>
shifter and hence as a function of the different split<br>
in the intensities, the polar diagram can now be<br>
depressed, with the main beam lobe hence being<br><br>
depressed, as required within the limiting interval<br>
from 0° to =10°. This is illustrated schematically by<br>
the respective main lobes 18.1 and 18.2 in Figure 3<br>
which represent the two transmission angles, which are<br>
set in a fixed manner in the factory for the upper<br>
antenna element 3.1 and for the lower antenna element<br>
3.2. The corresponding split in the intensity between<br>
the upper and lower antenna element system 3.1, 3.2 now<br>
makes it possible to set a main lobe 18.3 to different<br>
intermediate transmission angles, considering only the<br>
far field, by superimposition of the intensities of the<br>
main lobes 18.1 and 18.2, which can be set differently.<br>
Tf, for example, a controller is used in the base<br>
on and/or a controllable accessory for example in<br>
form of a stepping motor, then this can be used to<br>
drive the phase shifter 17 appropriately and in a very<br>
simple manner to set the antenna such that the<br>
resultant transmission lobe is depressed to the desired<br>
extent.<br>
The exemplary embodiment as explained and as<br>
illustrated in Figures 1 to 3 thus allows the main lobe<br>
(which is produced by superimposition) of the antenna<br>
arrangement to be set differently in the elevation<br>
direction.<br>
In the same way, however, it is also possible to<br>
produce a different transmission angle setting in the<br>
horizontal direction, that is to say in the azimuth<br>
direction. In this context, reference is made to the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 4, in which a<br>
corresponding antenna arrangement having two antenna<br>
element devices 3.1 and 3.2 is described, although<br>
these are now offset with respect to one another in the<br>
horizontal direction. The fact that the polarization<br>
plane need not in this case be arranged in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the reflector, but can also<br><br>
run in any other direction, for example transversely<br>
with respect to the longitudinal extent direction of<br>
the reflector, is likewise illustrated in Figure 4, by<br>
the fact that, there, the two antenna element devices<br>
3.1 and 3.2 which are arranged with a lateral offset in<br>
the horizontal direction can likewise once again be<br>
aligned vertically, that is to say they can transmit<br>
and receive in a vertical polarization plane.<br>
As is shown in Figure 5, the feed is likewise once<br>
again provided via a network 13 as explained with<br>
reference to Figure 2. In this case as well, a signal<br>
with the same intensity but with a different phase<br>
angle can be supplied to the two inputs 15a and 15b of<br>
he hybrid circuit 15 by appropriate adjustment of the<br>
phase shifter from its central neutral position, and,<br>
at the outputs 15'a and 15'b of the hybrid circuit 15,<br>
this means that the signal which is produced there is<br>
now supplied with the same phase angle but with<br>
different intensity to the two antenna element devices<br>
3.1 and 3.2. If, by way of example, provision is made<br>
in this exemplary embodiment (Figure 5 is in this case<br>
intended to show a schematic illustration of the<br>
antenna arrangement with two antenna element arrays 3.1<br>
and 3.2 which are arranged alongside one another in a<br>
horizontal plane) for the two antenna element arrays<br>
3.1 and 3.2 to transmit and receive at respective<br>
angles of -a and +a, for example at -15° and +15°,<br>
with respect to a central vertical plane, the beam<br>
direction of the main lobe can now be set differently<br>
between these two extreme values at -15° and +15°, by<br>
appropriate intensity splitting.<br>
An antenna array having two columns 23a and 23b will<br>
now be described with reference to Figure 6, in which<br>
in each case two antenna element devices or antenna<br>
elements, respectively, 3.11 and 3.21 which are<br>
arranged one above the other are provided in one column<br><br>
or 3.12 and 3.22 in the second column. In principle,<br>
four antenna element arrays 3.11 - 3.22 are ultimately<br>
involved here.<br>
An input signal is now supplied to the input 17a of the<br>
first phase shifter 17 which, corresponding to its<br>
adjustment direction via the downstream hybrid circuit<br>
15, produces at the output of the hybrid circuit 15 a<br>
signal with the same phase angle but with a different<br>
intensity. This is once again used, for example, to<br>
adjust the down-tilt angle of the antenna array as<br>
shown in Figure 6. The two corresponding signals are,<br>
however, now influenced by a corresponding circuit with<br>
a phase shifter 117a or 117b, respectively, and by a<br>
res actively downstream hybrid circuit 115a or 115b,<br>
once again the phase shifters 117a, 117b, such<br>
that, depend on the position of the phase shifter, a<br>
greater or tower signal intensity at the output is<br>
supplied either to the upper dipole antenna element<br>
3.11 or 3.12, and greater or lesser intensity is<br>
likewise supplied either to the lower dipole antenna<br>
element 3.21 or 3.22. In this exemplary embodiment as<br>
shown in Figure 6, the two phase shifters 117a and 117b<br>
in the second stage are preferably coupled to one<br>
another in this case, so that the intensity<br>
distribution for the antenna elements in the left-hand<br>
column 23a and in the right-hand column 23b is split in<br>
the same ratio to one another.<br>
By appropriate setting or adjustment of the phase<br>
shifter 17 in the first stage of the network and in<br>
conjunction with the downstream hybrid 15 in the first<br>
stage, this arrangement allows the down-tilt angle to<br>
be adjusted, and by appropriate operation or setting of<br>
the phase shifters 117a and 117b with the respectively<br>
associated hybrid circuits 115a, 115b in the second<br>
stage, this arrangement allows corresponding angular<br>
adjustment to be carried out in the azimuth direction,<br><br>
in order to set the main lobe as required between the<br>
transmission angles as governed by the system, as limit<br>
values. The corner or limit values for the different<br>
adjustable down-tilt angles are in principle determined<br>
by the two system lobes. These limit values may,<br>
however, be exceeded if separate phase shifting is also<br>
carried out for one or more antenna elements, and the<br>
signal is supplied with a corresponding phase shift.<br>
Figure 7 shows an antenna arrangement having two or<br>
more individual antenna elements or antenna element<br>
devices 3, to be precise by way of example for two<br>
antenna element arrays. A signal is in each case<br>
supplied via a sum and branching circuit 27.1 to a<br>
of antenna elements associate with the first<br>
element array 3.1, the corret onding signal is<br>
supplied via a second sum or branching circuit 27.2 to<br>
a group of antenna elements which is associated with<br>
the second antenna element array 3.2 and which are in<br>
each case arranged alternately vertically one above the<br>
other. These may, for example, be dipole antenna<br>
elements or else other antenna element devices, such as<br>
patch antenna elements. An appropriate hybrid circuit<br>
and a phase shifter arrangement comparable to that<br>
shown in Figure 2 in this case allow angular<br>
adjustments to be made, in which case the first antenna<br>
elenent group can be set in the factory to have a<br>
redetermined down-tilt angle of, for example, =0°,<br>
2°, 4° etc., and with the second antenna element group<br>
with the second antenna element device 3.2 having, for<br>
example, a fixed down-tilt angle of 10°, 12°, 16°. A<br>
down-tilt angle between the limit value predetermined<br>
in this way can then be set just by intensity<br>
splitting. An identical arrangement can, of course,<br>
also be used once again in a manner corresponding to<br>
the exemplary embodiment shown in Figures 4 and 5 to<br>
align the main node differently in the azimuth<br>
direction.<br><br>
The essential feature of the arrangement shown in<br>
Figure 7 is that, in comparison to conventional<br>
antennas, this results in considerably narrower use of<br>
the antenna element, with the interval separation<br>
preferably being less by a factor of 2 than with known<br>
antenna arrangements. The major difference from the<br>
existing antenna arrangement is thus now that the<br>
iistance between the individual antenna elements should<br>
referably be in the region of half the wavelength of<br>
the operating frequency instead of in the region of one<br>
entire wavelength, as is known from conventional<br>
antenna arrangements. This reduction in the antenna<br>
interval separation "by a factor of about 2", can be<br>
to produce particularly useful individual polar<br>
iagrams with sidelobes which are as small as possible.<br>
The distance between the individual antenna elements<br>
should in this case preferably be less than 9 0% of the<br>
overall wavelength, in particular less than 80%, less<br>
than 70% or less than 60% of one complete wavelength of<br>
the operating wavelength at an operating frequency (a<br>
frequency band, that is to say a value within the<br>
frequency band). Ultimately, this results overall in an<br>
arrangement for the antenna in which the phase centres<br>
of the at least two antenna arrays are located<br>
comparatively close to one another.<br>
The antenna design, which is described with reference<br>
to Figure 7 and Figure 8, which will be explained in<br>
the following text, results primarily in the major<br>
advantage that the phase centres of the antenna element<br>
arrays, in the illustrated exemplary embodiment the<br>
phase centres of the two antenna element arrays, are<br>
ideally located at one point. In this case, there is no<br>
direct relationship with the wavelength. However, the<br>
antenna design that has been explained means that the<br>
phase centres of, for example, the two antenna element<br>
arrays that have been mentioned are located at a<br><br>
distance from one another which is less than half the<br>
wavelength of the frequency band to be transmitted,<br>
normally with respect to the mid-frequency of this<br>
frequency band. In the case of an antenna designed in<br>
this way (corresponding to Figure 7 and corresponding<br>
to Figure 8, which will be explained in the following<br>
text), the phase centres of the (two) antenna element<br>
arrays are primarily located at a distance of<br>
considerably less than half the wavelength, in<br>
particular at a distance of less than 80%, in<br>
particular of less than 60%, less than 40%, less than<br>
20% or even less than 10%, with respect to half the<br>
wavelength, which is predetermined by the mid-frequency<br>
of the frequency band being used.<br>
he following text also refers to a further exemplary<br>
embodiment, as shown in Figure 8.<br>
As is shown in Figure 8, improved polar diagrams with<br>
reduced sidelobes are achieved if the individual<br>
antenna elements in the antenna element array with a<br>
depressed main lobe intrinsically have individual polar<br>
diagrams with a down-tilt angle in the region of the<br>
desired down-tilt of the overall antenna element array.<br>
A down-tilt such as this can be achieved for the<br>
individual antenna element by, for example, the<br>
corresponding reflector area having the desired<br>
inclination, as is shown in the exemplary embodiment of<br>
Figure 8. Thus, in the exemplary embodiment shown in<br>
Figure 8, there is no common reflector plane, and<br>
reflectors are provided which are associated separately<br>
with the individual antenna elements. In this case the<br>
arrangement is once again constructed in an alternating<br>
fashion such that, for example, the first, third,<br>
fifth, seventh etc., antenna elements 3.1', 3.3', 3.5'<br>
and 3.7' are fed via a line system 51 with an<br>
appropriate power splitter 53, and such that the<br><br>
antenna element arrays 2, 4, 6, 8 etc., (that is to say<br>
the antenna element arrays 3.2', 3.4', 3.6' and 3.8')<br>
which are arranged one above the other are fed via a<br>
line system 55 with a downstream power splitter 57. The<br>
odd-numbered antenna element arrays 3.1', 3.3', 3.5'<br>
etc., have, by way of example, associated reflectors 1,<br>
which are aligned in the vertical direction (but which<br>
may also have a different angle to this and may be<br>
preset). The respective even-numbered antenna element<br>
arrays 3.2', 3.4', 3.6' etc., have reflector systems 1'<br>
which are set at a different angle,, for example at an<br>
angle which can be preset or can be varied<br>
mechanically, with respect to the first antenna element<br>
arrays 3.1', 3.3', 3.5' etc. The mechanical adjustment<br>
an in this case likewise once again be carried out by<br>
remote control via an adjustment module which can be<br>
remotely controlled and which can set the reflectors<br>
1', as shown in Figure 8, in the second antenna element<br>
arrays at a different angular direction, as required.<br>
This exemplary embodiment shows that additional<br>
adjustment of individual antenna elements can be<br>
carried out either electrically by different, setting of<br>
a phase offset, or else mechanically, as explained.<br>
Further possible ways to depress the individual polar<br>
diagrams are feasible, for example by the addition of<br>
parasitic antenna elements in the vicinity of the<br>
respective dipoles.<br>
The arrangement is preferably in each case designed<br>
such that adjacent antenna elements are not influenced<br>
or are influenced only to an insignificant extent by<br>
inclined reflector walls or parasitic antenna elements.<br>
This can be achieved in the case of dipole antenna<br>
elements, for example, by the individual dipoles being<br>
isolated from one another by separating walls.<br><br>
With reference to the exemplary embodiments as shown in<br>
Figures 7 and 8 and as explained above, but in<br>
particular also with respect to the exemplary-<br>
embodiment as shown in Figure 6 which was explained<br>
above, it is thus possible to produce an arrangement<br>
having a plurality of antenna element arrays which are<br>
arranged in this case interleaved with one another and<br>
preferably alternately as antenna elements which are<br>
arranged in a plane, in two fitting directions that are<br>
at an angle to one another, preferably in two fitting<br>
directions that are at right angles to one another. In<br>
this case, it is then possible to provide a network 13<br>
via which the main lobe can be aligned in space by<br>
means of a combination of preferably vertical and<br>
horizontal control.<br><br>
