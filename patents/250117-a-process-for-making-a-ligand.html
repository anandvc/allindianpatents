				<td>The present invention relates to a process for making a ligand. [0001] This invention was made with United States Government support under ATP Award <br>
No. 70NANB4H3014 awarded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The United States Government has certain rights in the invention. [0002] This Application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/713,172, filed on August 31, 2005. [0003] The present invention relates to a method of synthesizing ligand structures that may be complexed with a late transition metal to form catalyst complexes useful in facilitating various polymerization reactions and/or Heck coupling reactions. [0004] The identification of new ligands for late transition metals and of commercially viable methods for making such ligands are important. For example, the identification of new ligands that complex with late transition metals to form catalyst complexes that are active for catalyzing polymerization reactions is of particular importance. That is, there remains an industry wide need for new molecular catalyst complexes that are capable of polymerizing <br>
polar monomers in a controlled fashion and for copolymerizing polar monomers with olefins (e.g., ethylene, propylene) under mild reaction conditions. Of the many approaches to modifying the properties of a polymer, the incorporation of functional groups into an otherwise non-polar material would be ideal in many situations. The incorporation of polar groups into a non-polar material can result in modification to various physical properties of the resultant copolymer, for example, toughness, adhesion, barrier properties and surface properties. Changes in these physical properties can result in improved solvent resistance, miscibility with other polymers and rheological properties, and product performance such as paintability, dyeability, printability, gloss, hardness and mar resistance. [0005] The identification of new ligands that complex with late transition metals to form catalyst complexes that are active for Heck coupling reactions is also or particular commercial importance. [0006] One approach to the preparation of ligands is disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,760,286 to Brandvold. Brandvold disclose a method for the preparation of ligands according to the according to formula IV  <br>

where A is selected from hydrogen, alkali earth metal, alkaline earth metal, quaternary ammonium, and a phosphonium group; RI is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alkyl group having from 1 up to about 20 carbon atoms, an aromatic group or an aralkyl group; R2 is selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group of from 1 up to about 20 carbon atoms, an aromatic group or fused aromatic group, an aralkyl group, and a cycloalkyl group having from 5 up to about 10 ring carbon atoms; and, R3 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alkyl group of from 1 up to about 20 carbon atoms, an aromatic group or an aralkyl group, and a cycloalkyl group having from 5 up to about 10 ring carbon atoms, comprising: a first reaction of compounds of formula II,<br>
with compounds of formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
to afford products of formula III<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where said first reaction proceeds by addition of a heterogeneous mixture of one molar proportion of the compound of formula I dispersed in an organic phase to a solution of the compound of formula II in an organic phase to afford a reaction mixture, said addition carried out at a rate such that the reaction mixture is at all times homogeneous, and; subsequent alkylation of the compound of formula III by an organometallic compound of formula R3M to yield the ligand of formula IV where R3M is a Grignard reagent or an organolithium.<br>
[0007] Nevertheless, there remains a need for new ligands and new ligand synthesis methods<br>
that provide such ligands in good yield and in relatively high purity.<br>
[0008] In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for making a ligand<br>
having the formula (Formula Removed)<br><br>

prevents undesired reactions with the reactive group. The use of protecting groups is well<br>

Examples 1-16: (Ligand Synthesis)<br>
[0032] Following the general procedure presented below using Component A and Component B identified in Table 1 in the amounts listed in Table 1, the Product Solids listed in Table 1 were prepared with the reported yield for examples 1-15, respectively. [0033] Component A was added to a 100 mL flask ("Flask A") then placed under vacuum and refilled with nitrogen and charged with 60 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF).   Flask A was then placed in an ice bath and allowed to cool to 0°C. 10.1 mL of 2.5 molar n-BuLi was then injected.   Flask A was then placed in a dry ice/acetone bath and allowed to cool to about -78°C.<br>

[0035] A separate 100 mL flask ("Flask C") was purged and filled with nitrogen. Flask C was then charged with -60 mL of THF and Component B. Flask C was then placed in a dry ice/acetone bath and allowed to cool with agitation to about -78°C. 10.1 mL of 2.5 molar<br>
n-BuLi was added to Flask C and allowed to react for about 15 minutes. The contents of Flask C were then transferred to Flask B, maintained at -78°C, using a cannula with continued vigorous agitation. Following the complete addition of the contents of Flask C into Flask B, Flask B was allowed to warm to room temperature for about 30 minutes. The contents of Flask B were then poured into a 500 mL recovery flask (Flask D) and the THF was removed, leaving a solid. The solid in Flask D was then mixed with distilled water and then transferred to a separation flask (Flask E).  100 mL of CH2C12 was added to the contents of Flask E. Flask E was shaken to mix the two layers. About 5 mL of concentrated HC1 was then added to Flask E. Flask E was shaken again. The mixture in Flask E was then allowed to settle, forming two layers-an organic phase on the bottom and a aqueous phase on the top. The organic layer was collected. The aqueous phase was washed with 50 mL of CH2Cl2. The organic wash material was collected and added to the previously collected organic layer material. The combined organic material was then contacted with MgSO4 and rotovaped to dryness, leaving a solid. The solid was then washed first with diethyl ether and then with THF to remove impurities. The washed Product Solid was collected by filtration with the yield reported in Table 1.<br>

Example 16: Synthesis of a potassium salt of the ligand of Structure VI [0036] A 0.45 g (0.81 mmol) sample of Product Solid (i.e., ligand Structure VI) prepared according to Example 6 was added to 50 mL of THF in a reaction flask with vigorous agitation to form a ligand solution. In a separate container, 0.10 g (0.88 mmol) of potassium tert-butoxide was dissolved in 20 mL of THF. The resulting potassium tert-butoxide solution was then added dropwise to the contents of the reaction flask with agitation. Following the addition of the potassium tert-butoxide solution, the contents of the reaction flask were reduced by vacuum extraction of some of the THF solvent leaving approximately 25 mL of product solution in the reaction flask. A potassium salt of the ligand was then precipitated from the remaining product solution through the addition of 20 mL of pentane. The precipitated potassium salt of the ligand was recovered by filtration through a fine porosity frit and washed with pentane 3 x 20 mL. The potassium salt of the ligand was then subjected to vacuum to remove the remaining volatiles, leaving a dark orange Product Powder 0.40 g (0.67 mmol, 83 %).<br>

In a separate container, 0.23 g (1.36 mmol) of silver nitrate was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. The resulting silver nitrate solution was then added dropwise to the contents of the reaction flask with vigorous agitation. Agitation of the contents of the reaction flask was continued for 20 minutes following addition of the silver nitrate solution. The contents of the reaction flask were then reduced by vacuum extraction of some of the solvent leaving approximately 50 mL and resulting in the formation of a gray precipitate.

The bottom of the flask was then heated using a heat gun. The flask contents melted to form a brown liquid, which started bubbling. The heating was continued until the liquid started to reflux and the pressure dropped to approximately 10 mTorr. The flask was filled with nitrogen, cooled and THF (anhydrous, Acros, ~50mL) was added to the flask forming a clear colorless solution. At 0°C, n-BuLi (2.5 M hexane solution, 11.4 mmol, 8.6 ml,, Aldrich) was added to yield a beige suspension, which was stirred for 0.5 hr before being cooled at -78°C.<br>
