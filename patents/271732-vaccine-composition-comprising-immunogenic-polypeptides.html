				<td>Novel Method and Compositions<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to novel vaccine compositions and their use in the stimulation of<br>
immune responses in mammals, especially humans, and in particular for the prevention and<br>
treatment of infection by pathogens. In particular it relates to compositions capable of inducing<br>
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses as well as antibody responses in subjects without recourse to<br>
complex prime-boost schedules.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Inactivated whole organisms have been used in successful vaccination since the late<br>
nineteenth century. In more recent times, vaccines involving the administration of extracts,<br>
subunits, toxoids and capsular polysaccharides have been employed. Since genetic<br>
engineering techniques have been available, the use of recombinant proteins has been a<br>
favoured strategy, obviating many of the risks associated with use of purified proteins from<br>
natural sources.<br>
Early vaccine approaches were based on the administration of proteins which stimulated<br>
some aspect of the immune response in vivo. Subsequently it was appreciated that immune<br>
responses could also be raised by administration of DNA which could be transcribed and<br>
translated by the host into an immunogenic protein.<br>
The mammalian immune response has two key components: the humoral response and<br>
the cell-mediated response. The humoral response involves the generation of circulating<br>
antibodies which will bind to the antigen to which they are specific, thereby neutralising the<br>
antigen and favouring its subsequent clearance by a process involving other cells that are either<br>
cytotoxic or phagocytic. B-cells are responsible for generating antibodies (plasma B cells), as<br>
well as holding immunological humoral memory (memory B-cells), i.e. the ability to recognise an<br>
antigen some years after first exposure to it eg through vaccination. The cell mediated<br>
response involves the interplay of numerous different types of cells, among which are the T<br>
cells. T-cells are divided into a number of different subsets, mainly the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.<br>
Antigen-presenting cells (APC) such as macrophages and dendritic cells act as sentinels<br>
of the immune system, screening the body for foreign antigens. When extracellular foreign<br>
antigens are detected by APC, these antigens are phagocytosed (engulfed) inside the APC<br>
where they will be processed into smaller peptides. These peptides are subsequently presented<br>
on major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules at the surface of the APC where<br>
they can be recognised by antigen-specific T lymphocytes expressing the CD4 surface<br>
molecules (CD4+ T cells). When CD4+ T cells recognise the antigen to which they are specific<br>
on MHCII molecules in the presence of additional adequate co-stimulatory signals, they become<br>
activated and secrete an array of cytokines that subsequently activate the other arms of the<br>
immune system. In general, CD4+T cells are classified into T helper 1 (Th1) or T helper 2 (Th2)<br>
subsets depending on the type of response they generate following antigen recognition. Upon<br>
recognition of a peptide-MHC II complex, Th1 CD4+ T cells secrete interleukins and cytokines<br>
such as interferon gamma thereby activating macrophages to release toxic chemicals such as<br>
nitric oxide and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. IL-2 and TNF-alpha are also commonly<br>
categorized as Th1 cytokines. In contrast, Th2 CD4+ T cells generally secrete interleukins such<br>
aslL-4, IL-5 orlL-13.<br>
Other functions of the T helper CD4+ T cells include providing help to activate B cells to<br>
produce and release antibodies. They can also participate to the activation of antigen-specific<br>
CD8+ T cells, the other major T cell subset beside CD4+ T cells.<br>
CD8+ T cells recognize the peptide to which they are specific when it is presented on<br>
the surface of a host cell by major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) molecules in the presence<br>
of appropriate costimulatory signals. In order to be presented on MHC I molecules, a foreign<br>
antigen need to directly access the inside of the cell (the cytosol or nucleus) such as it is the<br>
case when a virus or intracellular bacteria directly penetrate a host cell or after DNA vaccination.<br>
Inside the cell, the antigen is processed into small peptides that will be loaded onto MHC I<br>
molecules that are redirected to the surface of the cell. Upon activation CD8+T cells secrete an<br>
array of cytokines such as interferon gamma that activates macrophages and other cells. In<br>
particular, a subset of these CD8+ T cells secretes lytic and cytotoxic molecules (e.g. granzyme,<br>
perforin) upon activation. Such CD8+ T cells are referred to as cytotoxic T cells.<br>
More recently, an alternative pathway of antigen presentation involving the loading of<br>
extracellular antigens or fragments thereof onto MHCI complexes has been described and<br>
called "cross-presentation".<br>
The nature of the T-cell response is also influenced by the composition of the adjuvant<br>
used in a vaccine. For instance, adjuvants containing MPL &amp; QS21 have been shown to<br>
activate Th1 CD4+ T cells to secrete IFN-gamma (Stewart et al. Vaccine. 2006, 24 (42-<br>
43):6483-92).<br>
Whereas adjuvants are well known to have value in enhancing immune responses to<br>
protein antigens, they have not generally been used in conjunction with DNA or DNA-based<br>
vector vaccination. There are several hypotheses as to why adjuvants have not been used in<br>
conjunction with DNA-vector based vaccines. Indeed, interferences between the adjuvant and<br>
the vector may have an impact on their stability. In addition, one might expect that adding an<br>
adjuvant to an attenuated vector could increase the reactogenicity induced by such product.<br>
Finally, increasing the immunogenicity of a DNA-vector based vaccine may lead to an enhanced<br>
neutralizing immune response against the vector itself, thereby precluding any boosting effect of<br>
subsequent injections of the same vector-based vaccine. In fact, in a vaccination protocol<br>
directed towards protection against P. falciparum infection, Jones et al (2001, J Infect Diseases<br>
183, 303-312) have reported an adverse outcome after combining DNA, recombinant protein<br>
and adjuvant as a boosting composition following a prime by DNA. Indeed, the levels of<br>
parasitemia were significantly lower in a group in which the boosting composition contained<br>
protein and adjuvant only. It was concluded that use of the combination of DNA, recombinant<br>
protein and adjuvant in this protocol adversely affected the outcome on parasitemia as well as<br>
antibody responses.<br>
On the other hand, there has been a report of enhancement of the efficacy of an<br>
adjuvanted DNA-based vector vaccine (Ganne et al. Vaccine (1994) 12(13) 1190-1196). In<br>
particular, the enhanced efficacy of a replication-defective adenovirus-vectored vaccine by the<br>
addition of oil adjuvants was correlated with higher antibody levels but the impact on CD4 and<br>
CD8 T cell responses was not reported.<br>
The use of an apathogenic virus as an adjuvant has been disclosed in WO2007/016715.<br>
It was not mentioned that said virus could contain any heterologous polynucleotide.<br>
It is generally thought that stimulation of both CD4+ and CD8+ cells are needed for<br>
optimal protective immunity, especially in certain diseases such as HIV infection/AIDS. In order<br>
to induce an optimal immune response either prophylactically or therapeutically, stimulation of<br>
both CD4+ and CD8+ cells is desirable. This is one of the main goal of "prime-boost"<br>
vaccination strategies in which the alternate administration of protein-based vaccines (inducing<br>
mostly CD4+T cells) with DNA-vector based vaccines, i.e. naked DNA, viral vectors or<br>
intracellular bacterial vectors such as listeria, (inducing mostly CD8+T cells) or vice versa most<br>
likely activates both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses.<br>
However, although prime-boost vaccine strategies may generally give rise to a greater or<br>
more balanced response, the requirement to vaccinate on more than one occasion and certainly<br>
on more than two occasions can be burdensome or even unviable, especially in mass<br>
immunization programs for the developing world.<br>
Furthermore, as already mentioned above, it is often not possible to boost the viral<br>
vector component because of immunity that may have been raised against the vector itself.<br>
Thus the objects of the invention include one or more of the following: (a) to provide a<br>
complete vaccination protocol and a vaccine composition which stimulates the production of<br>
CD4+ and/or CD8+ cells and/or antibodies and in particular which obviates or mitigates the<br>
need for repeated immunizations; (b) to provide a vaccination protocol and a vaccine<br>
composition which better stimulates production of CD4+ cells and/or CD8+cells and/or<br>
antibodies relative to vaccine compositions containing an immunogenic polypeptide alone or a<br>
polynucleotide alone or relative to a conventional prime-boost protocol involving separate<br>
administration of immunogenic polypeptide and polynucleotide; (c) to provide a vaccine<br>
composition which stimulates or better stimulates Th1 responses; (d) to provide a vaccine<br>
composition and vaccination protocol in which required doses of components, especially viral<br>
vectors, are minimised; and (e) more generally to provide a useful vaccine composition and<br>
vaccination protocol for treatment or prevention of diseases caused by pathogens. By "better<br>
stimulates" is meant that the intensity and/or persistence of the response is enhanced.<br>

polypeptides, the one or more adenoviral vectors and the adjuvant are administered<br>
concomitantly.<br>
According to a specific aspect of the invention there is provided a vaccine composition<br>

specific CD4+ T-cells and/or CD8+ T-cells and/or antibodies.<br>
By "pathogen-specific CD4+ T-cells and/or CD8+ T-cells and/or antibodies" is meant<br>
CD4+ T-cells and/or CD8+ T-cells and/or antibodies which specifically recognise the whole<br>
pathogen or a part (eg an immunogenic subunit) thereof. By "specifically recognise" is meant<br>
that the CD4+ T-cells and/or CD8+ T-cells and/or antibodies recognise in an immunospecific<br>
rather than a non-specific manner said pathogen (or part thereof).<br>
There is also provided a method of stimulating an immune response in a mammal which<br>
comprises administering to a subject an immunologically effective amount of such a<br>
composition.<br>
There is also provided use of such a composition in the manufacture of a medicament<br>

CD4+ T-cells and/or CD8+ T-cells and/or antibodies in mammals which comprises administering<br>
to said mammal (i) one or more first immunogenic polypeptides derived from a pathogen; (ii)<br>
one or more adenoviral vectors comprising one or more heterologous polynucleotides encoding<br>
one or more second immunogenic polypeptides derived from said pathogen; and (iii) an<br>
adjuvant; wherein the one or more first immunogenic polypeptides, the one or more adenoviral<br>
vectors and the adjuvant are administered concomitantly, for example by administering an<br>
immunologically effective amount of an aforeseaid composition.<br>
There is also provided use of aforesaid compositions in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for stimulating the production of pathogen specific CD4+ and/or CD8+ cells and/or<br>
antibodies in mammals.<br>
For example, production of CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells or antibodies is stimulated.<br>

CD4+ and antibodies is stimulated.<br>
Alternatively suitably production of antibodies is stimulated.<br>
The methods of the invention are suitably intended to provide the steps adequate for a<br>
complete method for raising an immune response (although the method may, if desired, be<br>
repeated). Therefore suitably the methods do not involve use of a priming dose of any<br>
immunogenic polypeptide or polynucleotide (e.g. in the form of a vector such as an adenoviral<br>
vector) encoding any immunogenic polypeptide.<br>
For example there is provided a method of raising an immune response against a<br>

the one or more adenoviral vector and the adjuvant are administered concomitantly; and (b)<br>
optionally repeating the steps of (a).<br>
The steps of the method may be repeated (e.g. repeated once) if a repeat gives rise to<br>
an improved immune response. An adequate response, at least as far as a T-cell response is<br>
concerned, may be obtained without any need for repetition.<br>
There is also provided a method of raising an immune response against a pathogen<br>
which comprises (a) administering (i) one or more first immunogenic polypeptides derived from<br>
said pathogen; (ii) one or more adenoviral vectors comprising one or more heterologous<br>
polynucleotides encoding one or more second immunogenic polypeptides derived from said<br>
pathogen; and (iii) an adjuvant; wherein the one or more first immunogenic polypeptides, the<br>
one or more adenoviral vectors and the adjuvant are administered concomitantly; and wherein<br>

Detailed description of the invention.<br>
As used herein the term "concomitantly" means wherein the one or more immunogenic<br>
polypeptides, the one or more adenoviral vectors and the adjuvant are administered within a<br>
period of no more than 12 hours eg within a period of no more than 1 hour, typically on one<br>
occasion e.g. in the course of the same visit to the health professional, for example the one or<br>
more immunogenic polypeptides, the one or more adenoviral vectors and the adjuvant are<br>
administered sequentially or simultaneously.<br>
As used herein, the term "epitope" refers to an immunogenic amino acid sequence. An<br>
epitope may refer to an a minimum amino acid sequence of typically 6-8 amino acids which<br>
minimum sequence is immunogenic when removed from its natural context, for example when<br>
transplanted into a heterologous polypeptide. An epitope may also refer to that portion of a<br>
protein which is immunogenic, where the polypeptide containing the epitope is referred to as the<br>
antigen (or sometimes "polypeptide antigen"). A polypeptide or antigen may contain one or<br>
more (eg 2 or 3 or more) distinct epitopes. The term "epitope" embraces B-cell and T-cell<br>
epitopes. The term "T-cell epitope" embraces CD4+ T-cell epitopes and CD8+ T-cell epitopes<br>
(sometimes also referred to as CTL epitopes).<br>
The term "immunogenic polypeptide" refers to a polypeptide which is immunogenic, that<br>
is to say it is capable of eliciting an immune response in a mammal, and therefore contains one<br>
or more epitopes (eg T-cell and/or B-cell epitopes). Immunogenic polypeptides may contain<br>
one or more polypeptide antigens eg in an unnatural arrangement such as in a fusion protein.<br>
Immunogenic polypeptides will typically be recombinant proteins produced eg by<br>
expression in a heterologous host such as a bacterial host, in yeast or in cultured mammalian<br>
cells.<br>
The term "polypeptide derived from a pathogen" means a polypeptide which partially or<br>
wholly contains sequences (i.e. antigens) which occur naturally in pathogens or bear a high<br>
degree of sequence identity thereto (eg more than 95% identity over a stretch of at least 10 eg<br>
at least 20 amino acids).<br>
Immunogenic polypeptides may contain one or more (eg 1, 2, 3 or 4) polypeptide<br>
antigens.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, an "immune response" may be a cellular and/or a humoral<br>
response.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention one or more of said one or more first immunogenic<br>
polypeptides is substantially the same as one or more of said one or more second mmunogenic<br>
polypeptides. For example one of the at least one first immunogenic polypeptides and one of<br>
the at least one second immunogenic polypeptides may have an overall sequence identity of<br>
90% or more eg 95% or more eg 98% or 99% or more over the length of one or other<br>
immunogenic polypeptides.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention one or more of said one or more first<br>
immunogenic polypeptides contains at least one antigen which is substantially the same as an<br>
antigen contained in one or more of said one or more second immunogenic polypeptides. For<br>
example one of the at least one first immunogenic polypeptides and one of the at least one<br>
second immunogenic polypeptides may have an overall sequence identity of 90% or more eg<br>
95% or more eg 98% or 99% or more over a stretch of 20 amino acids or more eg 40 amino<br>
acids or more eg 60 amino acids or more.<br>
Suitably one or more first immunogenic polypeptides comprise at least one T cell<br>
epitope.<br>
Suitably one or more second immunogenic polypeptides comprise at least one T cell<br>
epitope.<br>
Suitably the one or more first immunogenic polypeptides comprise at least one B cell<br>
epitope.<br>
Suitably the one or more second immunogenic polypeptides comprise at least one B cell<br>
epitope<br>
In another embodiment of the invention one or more of said one or more first<br>
immunogenic polypeptides and one or more of said one or more second immunogenic<br>
polypeptides share one or more identical B-cell and/or T-cell epitopes. Suitably they share one<br>
or more identical amino acid sequences of length 10 amino acids or more eg 15 amino acids or<br>
more eg 25 amino acids or more.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, none of the one or more of said one or more<br>
first immunogenic polypeptides is substantially the same as or contains any antigen in common<br>
with one or more of said one or more second immunogenic polypeptides, for example they may<br>
have an overall sequence identity of less than 90% over a stretch of 20 amino acids or more eg<br>
40 amino acids or more eg 60 amino acids or more.<br>
Thus, they may not share any B-cell or T-cell epitopes. For example, they may note<br>
share any identical amino acid sequences of length 10 amino acids or more eg at 15 amino<br>
acids or more eg 25 amino acids or more.<br>
In one specific embodiment of the invention a first immunogenic polypeptide and a<br>
second immunogenic polypeptide contain the same antigens in the same arrangement or in a<br>
different arrangement (eg in a different arrangement). By "different arrangement" is meant that<br>
they may be arranged in a different order and/or they may be divided. In another specific<br>
embodiment of the invention a first immunogenic polypeptide and a second immunogenic<br>
polypeptide are the same.<br>
The composition according to the invention may contain one first immunogenic<br>
polypeptide as the only immunogenic polypeptide in the composition. Alternatively the<br>
composition according to the invention may contain more than one first immunogenic<br>
polypeptides eg 2 or 3 or 4 or more immunogenic polypeptides.<br>
The composition according to the invention may comprise one adenoviral vector.<br>
Alternatively it may comprise more than one adenoviral vector eg 2 adenoviral vectors.<br>
In compositions according to the invention a adenoviral vector may comprise a<br>
heterologous polynucleotide which encodes for one second immunogenic polypeptide or it may<br>
comprise more than one heterologous polynucleotide which together encode for more than one<br>
second immunogenic polypeptide under the control of more than one promoter.<br>
As well as for prophylactic vaccination, the compositions of the invention may also be<br>
used in individuals that are already infected with pathogen, and result in improved<br>
immunological control of the established infection. This is of particular interest when the<br>
pathogen is HIV. In the case of HIV, this control is believed to be achieved by CD8-positive T<br>
cells that specifically recognize HIV-infected cells. Such CD8-positive T cell response is<br>
maintained by the presence of HIV-specific CD4-positive helper T cells. Therefore, the induction<br>
of both types of immune response is particularly useful, and can be achieved by combining<br>
different vaccine compositions. A combination of an adjuvanted protein and a recombinant<br>
adenovirus is of particular interest. The HIV-infected patients that will benefit from the above-<br>
described vaccination are either in the primary infection, latency or terminal phase of HIV<br>
infection at the time of vaccination. The patients may or may not undergo other therapeutic<br>
treatment interventions against pathogen (in the case of HIV - for example highly active<br>
antiretroviral therapy) at the time of vaccination.<br>

other than serine, eg to Ala, and derivatives thereof incorporating an N-terminal His tag of an<br>
appropriate length (eg SEQ ID No 2 or 4 of WO2006/117240). See also SEQ ID No 10 which<br>
is a sequence containing an optional starting M and an optional N-terminal His-His tag<br>
(positions 2 and 3) and in which the Ala mutated relative to the wild-type Ser is at position 706.<br>
Chlamydia antigens<br>
The pathogen may, for example, be a Chlamydia sp. eg C trachomatis.<br>
Exemplary antigens derived from Chlamydia sp eg C trachomatis are selected from<br>
CT858, CT 089, CT875, MOMP, CT622, PmpD, PmpG and fragments thereof, SWIB and<br>
immunogenic fragments of any one thereof (such as PmpDpd and PmpGpd) and combinations<br>
thereof. Preferred combinations of antigens include CT858, CT089 and CT875. Specific<br>
sequences and combinations that may be employed are described in WO2006/104890.<br>
Plasmodium antigens<br>
The pathogen may, for example be a parasite that causes malaria such as a<br>
Plasmodium sp. eg P falciparum or P vivax.<br>
For example, antigens derived from P falciparum include circumsporozoite protein (CS<br>
protein),PfEMP-1, Pfs 16 antigen, MSP-1, MSP-3, LSA-1, LSA-3, AMA-1 and TRAP. A<br>
particular hybrid antigen that may be mentioned is RTS. RTS is a hybrid protein comprising<br>
substantially all the C-terminal portion of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of P.falciparum<br>
linked via four amino acids of the preS2 portion of Hepatitis B surface antigen to the surface (S)<br>
antigen of hepatitis B virus. When expressed in yeast RTS is produced as a lipoprotein particle,<br>
and when it is co-expressed with the S antigen from HBV it produces a mixed particle known as<br>
RTS,S The structure or RTS and RTS.S is disclosed in WO 93/10152. TRAP antigens are<br>
described in WO 90/01496. Other Plasmodium antigens include P. falciparum EBA, GLURP,<br>
RAP1, RAP2, Sequestrin, Pf332, STARP, SALSA, PfEXPI, Pfs25, Pfs28, PFS27/25, Pfs48/45,<br>
Pfs230 and their analogues in other Plasmodium spp. One embodiment of the present<br>
invention is a composition comprising RTS.S or CS protein or a fragment thereof such as the<br>
CS portion of RTS, S in combination with one or more further malarial antigens which may be<br>
selected for example from the group consisting of MSP-1, MSP-3, AMA-1, Pfs 16, LSA-1 or<br>
LSA-3. Possible antigens from P vivax include circumsporozoite protein (CS protein) and Duffy<br>
antigen binding protein and immunogenic fragments thereof, such as PvRII (see eg<br>
WO02/12292).<br>
Thus in one suitable embodiment of the invention, the first and second immunogenic<br>
polypeptides are selected from antigens derived from Plasmodium falciparum and/or<br>
Plasmodium vivax.<br>
For example, the first and/or second immunogenic polypeptides are selected from antigens<br>
derived from Plasmodium falciparum and/or Plasmodium vivax are selected from RTS (eg as<br>
RTS.S), circumsporozoite (CS) protein, MSP-1, MSP-3, AMA-1, LSA-1, LSA-3 and<br>
immunogenic derivatives thereof or immunogenic fragments thereof.<br>
One specific derivative that may be mentioned is the hybrid protein known as RTS,<br>
especially when presented in the form of a mixed particle known as RTS.S.<br>
An exemplary RTS sequence is shown in SEQ ID No 14.<br>
An exemplary P. falciparum CS protein-derived antigen is shown in SEQ ID No 12. This<br>
particular sequence corresponds to the CSP sequence of P.falciparum (3D7 strain), which also<br>
contains a 19 aa insertion coming from 7G8 strain ( 81-100).<br>
In one specific embodiment of the invention, a first immunogenic polypeptide is RTS.S<br>
and a second immunogenic polypeptide is the CS protein from Plasmodium falciparum or an<br>
immunogenic fragment thereof.<br>
HPV antigens<br>
The pathogen may, for example, be a Human Papilloma Virus.<br>
Thus antigens of use in the present invention may, for example, be derived from the<br>
Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) considered to be responsible for genital warts (HPV 6 or HPV 11<br>
and others;, and/or the HPV viruses responsible for cervical cancer (HPV16, HPV18, HPV33,<br>
HPV51, HPV56, HPV31, HPV45, HPV58, HPV52 and others;. In one embodiment the forms of<br>
genital wart prophylactic, or therapeutic, compositions comprise L1 particles or capsomers, and<br>
fusion proteins comprising one or more antigens selected from the HPV proteins E1, E2, E5 E6,<br>
E7, L1, and L2. In one embodiment the forms of fusion protein are: L2E7 as disclosed in<br>
W096/26277, and proteinD (1/3)-E7 disclosed in PCT/EP98/05285.<br>
A preferred HPV cervical infection or cancer, prophylaxis or therapeutic composition may<br>
comprise HPV 16 or 18 antigens. For example, L1 or L2 antigen monomers, or L1 or L2<br>
antigens presented together as a virus like particle (VLP) or the L1 alone protein presented<br>
alone in a VLP or capsomer structure. Such antigens, virus like particles and capsomer are per<br>
se known. See for example WO94/00152, WO94/20137, WO94/05792, and WO93/02184.<br>
Additional early proteins may be included alone or as fusion proteins such as E7, E2 or<br>
preferably E5 for example; particularly preferred embodiments of this includes a VLP comprising<br>
L1E7 fusion proteins (WO 96/11272). In one embodiment the HPV 16 antigens comprise the<br>
early proteins E6 or E7 in fusion with a protein D carrier to form Protein D - E6 or E7 fusions<br>
from HPV 16, or combinations thereof; or combinations of E6 or E7 with L2 (WO 96/26277).<br>
Alternatively the HPV 16 or 18 early proteins E6 and E7, may be presented in a single<br>
molecule, preferably a Protein D- E6/E7 fusion. Such a composition may optionally provide<br>
either or both E6 and E7 proteins from HPV 18, preferably in the form of a Protein D - E6 or<br>
Protein D - E7 fusion protein or Protein D E6/E7 fusion protein. Additionally antigens from other<br>
HPV strains, preferably from strains HPV 31 or 33 may be employed.<br>
HIV antigens<br>
The pathogen may, for example, be HIV eg HIV-1.<br>
Thus, antigens may be selected from HIV derived antigens, particularly HIV-1 derived<br>
antigens.<br>
HIV Tat and Nef proteins are early proteins, that is, they are expressed early in infection<br>
and in the absence of structural protein.<br>
The Nef gene encodes an early accessory HIV protein which has been shown to<br>
possess several activities. For example, the Nef protein is known to cause the removal of CD4,<br>
the HIV receptor, from the cell surface, although the biological importance of this function is<br>
debated. Additionally Nef interacts with the signal pathway of T cells and induces an active<br>
state, which in turn may promote more efficient gene expression. Some HIV isolates have<br>
mutations or deletions in this region, which cause them not to encode functional protein and are<br>
severely compromised in their replication and pathogenesis in vivo.<br>
The Gag gene is translated from the full-length RNA to yield a precursor polyprotein<br>
which is subsequently cleaved into 3-5 capsid proteins; the matrix protein p17, capsid protein<br>
p24 and nucleic acid binding protein (Fundamental Virology, Fields BN, Knipe DM and Howley<br>
M 1996 2. Fields Virology vol 2 1996).<br>
The Gag gene gives rise to the 55-kilodalton (Kd) Gag precursor protein, also called<br>
p55, which is expressed from the unspliced viral mRNA. During translation, the N terminus of<br>
p55 is myristoylated, triggering its association with the cytoplasmic aspect of cell membranes.<br>
The membrane-associated Gag polyprotein recruits two copies of the viral genomic RNA along<br>
with other viral and cellular proteins that triggers the budding of the viral particle from the<br>
surface of an infected cell. After budding, p55 is cleaved by the viral y encoded protease (a<br>
product of the Pol gene) during the process of viral maturation into four smaller proteins<br>
designated MA (matrix [p17]), CA (capsid [p24]), NC (nucleocapsid [p9]), and p6.(4).<br>
In addition to the 3 major Gag proteins (p17, p24 and p9), all Gag precursors contain<br>
several other regions, which are cleaved out and remain in the virion as peptides of various<br>
sizes. These proteins have different roles e.g. the p2 protein has a proposed role in regulating<br>
activity of the protease and contributes to the correct timing of proteolytic processing.<br>
The MA polypeptide is derived from the N-terminal, myristoylated end of p55. Most MA<br>
molecules remain attached to the inner surface of the virion lipid bilayer, stabilizing the particle.<br>
A subset of MA is recruited inside the deeper layers of the virion where it becomes part of the<br>
complex which escorts the viral DNA to the nucleus. These MA molecules facilitate the nuclear<br>
transport of the viral genome because a karyophilic signal on MA is recognized by the cellular<br>
nuclear import machinery. This phenomenon allows HIV to infect non-dividing cells, an unusual<br>
property for a retrovirus.<br>
The p24 (CA) protein forms the conical core of viral particles. Cyclophilin A has been<br>
demonstrated to interact with the p24 region of p55 leading to its incorporation into HIV<br>
particles. The interaction between Gag and cyclophilin A is essential because the disruption of<br>
this interaction by cyclosporine inhibits viral replication.<br>
The NC region of Gag is responsible for specifically recognizing the so-called packaging<br>
signal of HIV. The packaging signal consists of four stem loop structures located near the 5"<br>
end of the viral RNA, and is sufficient to mediate the incorporation of a heterologous RNA into<br>
HIV-1 virions. NC binds to the packaging signal through interactions mediated by two zinc-<br>
finger motifs. NC also facilitates reverse transcription.<br>
The p6 polypeptide region mediates interactions between p55 Gag and the accessory<br>
protein Vpr, leading to the incorporation of Vpr into assembling virions. The p6 region also<br>
contains a so-called late domain which is required for the efficient release of budding virions<br>
from an infected cell.<br>
The Pol gene encodes three proteins having the activities needed by the virus in early<br>
infection, reverse transcriptase RT, protease, and the integrase protein needed for integration of<br>
viral DNA into cellular DNA. The primary product of Pol is cleaved by the virion protease to<br>
yield the amino terminal RT peptide which contains activities necessary for DNA synthesis (RNA<br>
and DNA directed DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H) and carboxy terminal integrase protein.<br>
HIV RT is a heterodimer of full-length RT (p66) and a cleavage product (p51) lacking the<br>
carboxy terminal RNase H domain.<br>
RT is one of the most highly conserved proteins encoded by the retroviral genome. Two<br>
major activities of RT are the DNA Pol and ribonuclease H. The DNA Pol activity of RT uses<br>
RNA and DNA as templates interchangeably and like all DNA polymerases known is unable to<br>
initiate DNA synthesis de novo, but requires a pre existing molecule to serve as a primer (RNA).<br>
The RNase H activity inherent in all RT proteins plays the essential role early in<br>
replication of removing the RNA genome as DNA synthesis proceeds. It selectively degrades<br>
the RNA from all RNA - DNA hybrid molecules. Structurally the polymerase and ribo H occupy<br>
separate, non-overlapping domains within the Pol covering the amino two thirds of the Pol.<br>
The p66 catalytic subunit is folded into 5 distinct subdomains. The amino terminal 23 of<br>
these have the portion with RT activity. Carboxy terminal to these is the RNase H domain.<br>
After infection of the host cell, the retroviral RNA genome is copied into linear double<br>
stranded DNA by the reverse transcriptase that is present in the infecting particle. The<br>
integrase (reviewed in Skalka AM '99 Adv in Virus Res 52 271-273) recognises the ends of the<br>
viral DNA, trims them and accompanies the viral DNA to a host chromosomal site to catalyse<br>
integration. Many sites in the host DNA can be targets for integration. Although the integrase is<br>
sufficient to catalyse integration in vitro, it is not the only protein associated with the viral DNA in<br>
vivo - the large protein - viral DNA complex isolated from the infected cells has been denoted<br>
the pre integration complex. This facilitates the acquisition of the host cell genes by progeny<br>
viral genomes.<br>
The integrase is made up of 3 distinct domains, the N terminal domain, the catalytic core<br>
and the C terminal domain. The catalytic core domain contains all of the requirements for the<br>
chemistry of polynucleotidyl transfer.<br>
HiV-1 derived antigens for us in the invention may thus for example be selected from<br>
Gag (for example full length Gag), p17 (a portion of Gag), p24 (another portion of Gag), p41,<br>
p40, Pol (for example full length Pol), RT (a portion of Pol), p51 (a portion of RT), integrase (a<br>
portion of Pol), protease (a portion of Pol), Env, gp120, gp140 or gp160, gp41, Nef, Vif, Vpr,<br>
Vpu, Rev, Tat and immunogenic derivatives thereof and immunogenic fragments thereof,<br>
particularly Env, Gag, Nef and Pol and immunogenic derivatives thereof and immunogenic<br>
fragments thereof including p17, p24, RT and integrase. HIV vaccines may comprise<br>
polypeptides and/or polynucleotides encoding polypeptides corresponding to multiple different<br>
HIV antigens for example 2 or 3 or 4 or more HIV antigens which may be selected from the<br>
above list. Several different antigens may, for example, be comprised in a single fusion protein.<br>
More than one first immunogenic polypeptide and/or more than one second immunogenic<br>
polypeptide each of which is an HIV antigen or a fusion of more than one antigen may be<br>
employed.<br>
For example an antigen may comprise Gag or an immunogenic derivative or<br>
immunogenic fragment thereof, fused to RT or an immunogenic derivative or immunogenic<br>
fragment thereof, fused to Nef or an immunogenic derivative or immunogenic fragment thereof<br>
wherein the Gag portion of the fusion protein is present at the 5' terminus end of the<br>
polypeptide.<br>
A Gag sequence of use according to the invention may exclude the Gag p6 polypeptide<br>
encoding sequence. A particular example of a Gag sequence for use in the invention<br>
comprises p17 and/or p24 encoding sequences.<br>
A RT sequence may contain a mutation to substantially inactivate any reverse<br>
transcriptase activity (see WO03/025003).<br>
The RT gene is a component of the bigger pol gene in the HIV genome. It will be<br>
understood that the RT sequence employed according to the invention may be present in the<br>
context of Pol, or a fragment of Pol corresponding at least to RT. Such fragments of Pol retain<br>
major CTL epitopes of Pol. In one specific example, RT is included as just the p51 or just the<br>
p66 fragment of RT.<br>
The RT component of the fusion protein or composition according to the invention<br>
optionally comprises a mutation to remove a site which serves as an internal initiation site in<br>
prokaryotic expression systems.<br>
Optionally the Nef sequence for use in the invention is truncated to remove the<br>
sequence encoding the N terminal region i.e. removal of from 30 to 85 amino acids, for example<br>
from 60 to 85 amino acids, particularly the N terminal 65 amino acids (the latter truncation is<br>
referred to herein as trNef). Alternatively or additionally the Nef may be modified to remove the<br>
myristylation site. For example the Gly 2 myristylation site may be removed by deletion or<br>
substitution. Alternatively or additionally the Nef may be modified to alter the dileucine motif of<br>
Leu 174 and Leu 175 by deletion or substitution of one or both leucines. The importance of the<br>
dileucine motif in CD4 downregulation is described e.g. in Bresnahan P.A. et al (1998) Current<br>
Biology, 8(22): 1235-8.<br>
The Env antigen may be present in its full length as gp160 or truncated as gp140 or<br>
shorter (optionally with a suitable mutation to destroy the cleavage site motif between gp120<br>
and gp41). The Env antigen may also be present in its naturally occurring processed form as<br>
gp120 and gp41. These two derivatives of gp160 may be used individually or together as a<br>
combination. The aforementioned Env antigens may further exhibit deletions (in particular of<br>
variable loops) and truncations. Fragments of Env may be used as well.<br>
An exemplary gp120 sequence is shown in SEQ ID No 8. An exemplary gp140<br>
sequence is shown in SEQ ID No 6.<br>
Immunogenic polypeptides according to the invention may comprise Gag, Pol, Env and<br>
Nef wherein at least 75%, or at least 90% or at least 95%, for example, 96% of the CTL<br>
epitopes of these native antigens are present.<br>
In immunogenic polypeptides according to the invention which comprise p17/p24 Gag,<br>
p66 RT, and truncated Nef as defined above, 96% of the CTL epitopes of the native Gag, Pol<br>
and Nef antigens are suitably present.<br>
One embodiment of the invention provides an immunogenic polypeptide containing p17,<br>
p24 Gag, p66 RT , truncated Nef (devoid of nucleotides encoding terminal amino-acids 1-85 -<br>
"trNef") in the order Gag, RT, Nef. In polynucleotides encoding immunogenic polypeptides of<br>
the invention, suitably the P24 Gag and P66 RT are codon optimized.<br>
Specific polynucleotide constructs and corresponding polypeptide antigens according to<br>
the invention include:<br>
1. p17, p24 (codon optimised) Gag - p66 RT (codon optimised) - truncated Nef;<br>

An exemplary fusion is a fusion of Gag, RT and Nef particularly in the order Gag-RT-Nef<br>
(see eg SEQ ID No 2). Another exemplary fusion is a fusion of p17, p24, RT and Nef<br>
particularly in the order p24-RT-Nef-p17 (see eg SEQ ID No 16, referred to elsewhere herein as<br>
"F4").<br>
In another embodiment an immunogenic polypeptide contains Gag, RT, integrase and<br>
Nef, especially in the order Gag-RT-integrase-Nef (see eg SEQ ID No 4).<br>
In other embodiments the HIV antigen may be a fusion polypeptide which comprises Nef<br>
or an immunogenic derivative thereof or an immunogenic fragment thereof, and p17 Gag and/or<br>
p24 Gag or immunogenic derivatives thereof or immunogenic fragments thereof, wherein when<br>
both p17 and p24 Gag are present there is at least one HIV antigen or immunogenic fragment<br>
between them.<br>
For example, Nef is suitably full length Nef.<br>
For example p17 Gag and p24 Gag are suitably full length p17 and p24 respectively.<br>
In one embodiment an immunogenic polypeptide comprises both p17 and p24 Gag or<br>
immunogenic fragments thereof. In such a construct the p24 Gag component and p17 Gag<br>
component are separated by at least one further HIV antigen or immunogenic fragment, such as<br>
Nef and/or RT or immunogenic derivatives thereof or immunogenic fragments thereof. See<br>
WO2006/013106 for further details.<br>
In fusion proteins which comprise p24 and RT, it may be preferable that the p24<br>
precedes the RT in the construct because when the antigens are expressed alone in E coli<br>
better expression of p24 than of RT is observed.<br>
Some constructs according to the invention include the following:<br><br>
* represents RT methionine592 mutation to lysine<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a fusion protein of HIV antigens<br>
comprising at least four HIV antigens or immunogenic fragments, wherein the four antigens or<br>
fragments are or are derived from Nef, Pol and Gag. Preferably Gag is present as two separate<br>
components which are separated by at least one other antigen in the fusion. Preferably the Nef<br>
is full length Nef. Preferably the Pol is p66 or p51RT. Preferably the Gag is p17 and p24 Gag.<br>
Other preferred features and properties of the antigen components of the fusion in this aspect of<br>
the invention are as described herein.<br>
Preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention are the four component fusions as<br>
already listed above:<br><br>
The immunogenic polypeptides of the present invention may have linker sequences<br>
present in between the sequences corresponding to particular antigens such as Gag, RT and<br>
Nef. Such linker sequences may be, for example, up to 20 amino acids in length. In a particular<br>
example they may be from 1 to 10 amino acids, or from 1 to 6 amino acids, for example 4-6<br>
amino acids.<br>
Further description of such suitable HIV antigens can be found in WO03/025003.<br>
HIV antigens of the present invention may be derived from any HIV clade, for example<br>
clade A, clade B or clade C. For example the HIV antigens may be derived from clade A or B,<br>
especially B.<br>
In one specific embodiment of the invention, a first immunogenic polypeptide is a<br>
polypeptide comprising Gag and/or Pol and/or Nef or a fragment or derivative of any of them (eg<br>
p24-RT-Nef-p17). In one specific embodiment of the invention a second immunogenic<br>
polypeptide is a polypeptide comprising Gap and/or Pol and/or Nef or a fragment or derivative of<br>
any of them (eg Gag-RT-Nef or Gag-RT-integrase-Nef).<br>
Thus in one specific embodiment, a polypeptide comprising Gap and/or Pol and/or Nef<br>
or a fragment or derivative of any of them (eg p24-RT-Nef-p17) is a first immunogenic<br>
polypeptide and a polypeptide comprising Gap and/or Pol and/or Nef or a fragment or derivative<br>
of any of them (eg Gag-RT-Nef or Gag-RT-integrase-Nef) is a second immunogenic<br>
polypeptide.<br>
In another specific embodiment of the invention, a first immunogenic polypeptide is Env<br>
or a fragment or derivative thereof eg gp120, gp140 or gp160 (especially gp120). In one<br>
specific embodiment of the invention a second immunogenic polypeptide is a polypeptide<br>
comprising Gag and/or Pol and/or Nef or a fragment or derivative of any of them (eg p24-RT-<br>
Nef-p17).<br>
Thus in one specific embodiment, Env or a fragment or derivative thereof eg gpl20,<br>
gp140 or gp160 (especially gp120) is a first immunogenic polypeptide and a polypeptide<br>
comprising Gag and/or Pol and/or Nef or a fragment or derivative of any of them (eg p24-RT-<br>
Nef-p17) is a second immunogenic polypeptide.<br>
In another specific embodiment of the invention, a first immunogenic polypeptide is a<br>
polypeptide comprising Gag and/or Pol and/or Nef or a fragment or derivative of any of them (eg<br>
p24-RT-Nef-p17). In one specific embodiment of the invention a second immunogenic<br>
polypeptide is Env or a fragment or derivative thereof eg gp120, gp140 or gp160 (especially<br>
gp120).<br>
Thus in one specific embodiment, a polypeptide comprising Gag and/or Pol and/or Nef<br>
or a fragment or derivative of any of them (eg p24-RT-Nef-p17) is a first immunogenic<br>
polypeptide and Env or a fragment or derivative thereof eg gp120, gp140 or gp160 (especially<br>
gp120) is a second immunogenic polypeptide.<br>
Immunogenic derivatives and immunogenic fragments of antigens<br>
The aforementioned antigens may be employed in the form of immunogenic derivatives<br>
or immunogenic fragments thereof rather than the whole antigen.<br>
As used herein the term "immunogenic derivative" in relation to an antigen of native<br>
origin refers to an antigen that have been modified in a limited way relative to its native<br>
counterparts. For example it may include a point mutation which may change the properties of<br>
the protein eg by improving expression in prokaryotic systems or by removing undesirable<br>
activity, eg enzymatic activity. Immunogenic derivatives will however be sufficiently similar to the<br>
native antigens such that they retain their antigenic properties and remain capable of raising an<br>
immune response against the native antigen. Whether or not a given derivative raises such an<br>
immune response may be measured by a suitably immunological assay such as an ELISA (for<br>
antibody responses) or flow cytometry using suitable staining for cellular markers (for cellular<br>
responses).<br>
Immunogenic fragments are fragments which encode at least one epitope, for example a<br>
CTL epitope, typically a peptide of at least 8 amino acids. Fragments of at least 8, for example<br>
8-10 amino acids or up to 20, 50, 60, 70, 100, 150 or 200 amino acids in length are considered<br>
to fall within the scope of the invention as long as the polypeptide demonstrates antigenicity,<br>
that is to say that the major epitopes (eg CTL epitopes)are retained by the polypeptide.<br>
Adenovirus<br>
Adenoviral vectors of the present invention comprise one or more heterologous<br>
polynucleotides (DNA) which encode one or more immunogenic polypeptides.<br>
Adenoviral vectors of use in the present invention may be derived from a range of<br>
mammalian hosts.<br>
Adenoviruses (herein referred to as "Ad" or "Adv") have a characteristic morphology with<br>
an icosohedral capsid consisting of three major proteins, hexon (II), penton base (III) and a<br>
knobbed fibre (IV), along with a number of other minor proteins, VI, VIII, IX, Ilia and IVa2<br>
(Russell W.C. 2000, Gen Viriol, 81:2573-2604). The virus genome is a linear, double-stranded<br>
DNA with a terminal protein attached covalently to the 5" termini, which have inverted terminal<br>
repeats (ITRs). The virus DNA is intimately associated with the highly basic protein VII and a<br>
small peptide termed mu. Another protein, V, is packaged with this DNA-protein complex and<br>
provides a structural link to the capsid via protein VI. The virus also contains a virus-encoded<br>
protease, which is necessary for processing of some of the structural proteins to produce<br>
mature infectious virus.<br>
Over 100 distinct serotypes of adenovirus have been isolated which infect various<br>
mammalian species, 51 of which are of human origin. Thus one or more of the adenoviral<br>
vectors may be derived from a human adenovirus. Examples of such human-derived<br>
adenoviruses are Ad1, Ad2, Ad4, Ad5, Ad6, Ad11, Ad 24, Ad34, Ad35, particularly Ad5, Ad11<br>
and Ad35. The human serotypes have been categorised into six subgenera (A-F) based on a<br>
number of biological, chemical, immunological and structural criteria.<br>
Although Ad5-based vectors have been used extensively in a number of gene therapy<br>
trials, there may be limitations on the use of Ad5 and other group C adenoviral vectors due to<br>
preexisting immunity in the general population due to natural infection. Ad5 and other group C<br>
members tend to be among the most seroprevalent serotypes. Immunity to existing vectors may<br>
develop as a result of exposure to the vector during treatment. These types of preexisting or<br>
developed immunity to seroprevalent vectors may limit the effectiveness of gene therapy or<br>
vaccination efforts. Alternative adenovirus serotypes, thus constitute very important targets in<br>
the pursuit of gene delivery systems capable of evading the host immune response.<br>
One such area of alternative serotypes are those derived from non human primates,<br>
especially chimpanzee adenoviruses. See US Patent 6,083,716 which describes the genome of<br>
two chimpanzee adenoviruses.<br>
It has been shown that chimpanzee ("Pan" or "C") adenoviral vectors induce strong<br>
immune responses to transgene products as efficiently as human adenoviral vectors (Fitzgerald<br>
etal. J. Immunol. 170:1416).<br>
Non human primate adenoviruses can be isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes of<br>
chimpanzees. Chimpanzee adenoviruses are sufficiently similar to human adenovirus subtype<br>
C to allow replication of E1 deleted virus in HEK 293 cells. Yet chimpanzee adenoviruses are<br>
phylogenetically distinct from the more common human serotypes (Ad2 and Ad5). Pan 6 is less<br>
closely related to and is serologically distinct from Pans 5, 7 and 9.<br>
Thus one or more of the adenoviral vectors may be derived from a non-human primate<br>
adenovirus eg a chimpanzee adenovirus such as one selected from serotypes Pan5, Pan6,<br>
Pan7 and Pan9.<br>
Adenoviral vectors may also be derived from more than one adenovirus serotype, and<br>
each serotype may be from the same or different source. For example they may be derived<br>
from more than one human serotype and/or more than one non-human primate serotype.<br>
Methods for constructing chimeric adenoviral vectors are disclosed in WO2005/001103.<br>
There are certain size restrictions associated with inserting heterologous DNA into<br>
adenoviruses. Human adenoviruses have the ability to package up to 105% of the wild type<br>
genome length (Bett et al 1993, J Virol 67 (10), 5911-21). The lower packaging limit for human<br>
adenoviruses has been shown to be 75% of the wild type genome length (Parks et al 1995, J<br>
Virol 71(4), 3293-8).<br>
One example of adenoviruses of use in the present invention are adenoviruses which<br>
are distinct from prevalent naturally occurring serotypes in the human population such as Ad2<br>
and Ad5. This avoids the induction of potent immune responses against the vector which limits<br>
the efficacy of subsequent administrations of the same serotype by blocking vector uptake<br>
through neutralizing antibody and influencing toxicity.<br>
Thus, the adenovirus may be an adenovirus which is not a prevalent naturally occurring<br>
human virus serotype. Adenoviruses isolated from animals have immunologically distinct<br>
capsid, hexon, penton and fibre components but are phylogenetically closely related.<br>
Specifically, the virus may be a non-human adenovirus, such as a simian adenovirus and in<br>
particular a chimpanzee adenovirus such as Pan 5, 6, 7 or 9. Examples of such strains are<br>
described in WO03/000283 and are available from the American Type Culture Collection, 10801<br>
University Boulevard, Manassas, Virginia 20110-2209, and other sources. Desirable<br>
chimpanzee adenovirus strains are Pan 5 [ATCC VR-591], Pan 6 [ATCC VR-592], and Pan 7<br>
[ATCC VR-593].<br>
Use of chimpanzee adenoviruses is thought to be advantageous over use of human<br>
adenovirus serotypes because of the lack of pre-existing immunity, in particular the lack of<br>
cross-neutralising antibodies, to adenoviruses in the target population. Cross-reaction of the<br>
chimpanzee adenoviruses with pre-existing neutralizing antibody responses is only present in<br>
2% of the target population compared with 35% in the case of certain candidate human<br>
adenovirus vectors. The chimpanzee adenoviruses are distinct from the more common human<br>
subtypes Ad2 and Ad5, but are more closely related to human Ad4 of subgroup E, which is not<br>
a prevalent subtype. Pan 6 is less closely related to Pan 5, 7 and 9.<br>
The adenovirus of the invention may be replication defective. This means that it has a<br>
reduced ability to replicate in non-complementing cells, compared to the wild type virus. This<br>
may be brought about by mutating the virus e.g. by deleting a gene involved in replication, for<br>
example deletion of the E1a, E1b, E3 or E4 gene.<br>
The adenoviral vectors in accordance with the present invention may be derived from<br>
replication defective adenovirus comprising a functional E1 deletion. Thus the adenoviral<br>
vectors according to the invention may be replication defective due to the absence of the ability<br>
to express adenoviral E1a and E1b, i.e., are functionally deleted in E1a and E1b. The<br>
recombinant adenoviruses may also bear functional deletions in other genes [see WO<br>
03/000283] for example, deletions in E3 or E4 genes. The adenovirus delayed early gene E3<br>
may be eliminated from the adenovirus sequence which forms part of the recombinant virus.<br>
The function of E3 is not necessary to the production of the recombinant adenovirus particle.<br>
Thus, it is unnecessary to replace the function of this gene product in order to package a<br>
recombinant adenovirus useful in the invention. In one particular embodiment the recombinant<br>
adenoviruses have functionally deleted E1 and E3 genes. The construction of such vectors is<br>
described in Roy et al., Human Gene Therapy 15:519-530, 2004.<br>
Recombinant adenoviruses may also be constructed having a functional deletion of the<br>
E4 gene, although it may be desirable to retain the E4 ORF6 function. Adenovirus vectors<br>
according to the invention may also contain a deletion in the delayed early gene E2a. Deletions<br>
may also be made in any of the late genes L1 through to L5 of the adenovirus genome.<br>
Similarly deletions in the intermediate genes IX and IVa may be useful.<br>
Other deletions may be made in the other structural or non-structural adenovirus genes.<br>
The above deletions may be used individually, i.e. an adenovirus sequence for use in the<br>
present invention may contain deletions of E1 only. Alternatively, deletions of entire genes or<br>
portions thereof effective to destroy their biological activity may be used in any combination. For<br>
example in one exemplary vector, the adenovirus sequences may have deletions of the E1<br>
genes and the E4 gene, or of the E1, E2a and E3 genes, or of the E1 and E3 genes (such as<br>
functional deletions in E1a and E1b, and a deletion of at least part of E3), or of the E1, E2a and<br>
E4 genes, with or without deletion of E3 and so on. Such deletions may be partial or full<br>
deletions of these genes and may be used in combination with other mutations, such as<br>
temperature sensitive mutations to achieve a desired result.<br>
The adenoviral vectors can be produced on any suitable cell line in which the virus is<br>
capable of replication. In particular, complementing cell lines which provide the factors missing<br>
from the viral vector that result in its impaired replication characteristics (such as E1 and/or E4)<br>
can be used. Without limitation, such a cell line may be HeLa [ATCC Accession No. CCL 2],<br>
A549 [ATCC Accession No. CCL 185], HEK 293, KB [CCL 17], Detroit [e.g., Detroit 510, CCL<br>
72] and WI-38 [CCL 75] cells, among others. These cell lines are all available from the<br>
American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Virginia 20110-<br>
2209. Other suitable parent cell lines may be obtained from other sources, such as PER.C6©<br>
cells, as represented by the cells deposited under ECACC no. 96022940 at the European<br>
Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (ECACC) at the Centre for Applied Microbiology and<br>
Research (CAMR, UK) or Her 96 cells (Crucell).<br>
The polynucleotide sequences which encode immunogenic polypeptides may be<br>
codon optimised for mammalian cells. Such codon-optimisation is described in detail in<br>
WO05/025614. Codon optimization for certain HIV sequences is further described in WO<br>
03/025003.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the polynucleotide constructs comprise an<br>
N-terminal leader sequence. The signal sequence, transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic<br>
domain are individually all optionally present or deleted. In one embodiment of the present<br>
invention all these regions are present but modified.<br>
A promoter for use in the adenoviral vector according to the invention may be the<br>
promoter from HCMV IE gene, for example wherein the 5' untranslated region of the HCMV IE<br>
gene comprising exon 1 is included and intron A is completely or partially excluded as described<br>
in WO 02/36792.<br>
When several antigens are fused into a fusion protein, such protein would be encoded<br>
by a polynucleotide under the control of a single promoter.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, several antigens may be expressed<br>
separately through individual promoters, each of said promoters may be the same or different.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention some of the antigens may form a fusion, linked to a<br>
first promoter and other antigen(s) may be linked to a second promoter, which may be the same<br>
or different from the first promoter.<br>
Thus, the adenoviral vector may comprise one or more expression cassettes each of<br>
which encode one antigen under the control of one promoter. Alternatively or additionally it may<br>
comprise one or more expression cassettes each of which encode more than one antigen under<br>
the control of one promoter, which antigens are thereby expressed as a fusion. Each<br>
expression cassette may be present in more than one locus in the adenoviral vector.<br>
The polynucleotide or polynucleotides encoding immunogenic polypeptides to be<br>
expressed may be inserted into any of the adenovirus deleted regions, for example into the E1<br>
deleted region.<br>
Although two or more polynucleotides encoding immunogenic polypeptides may be<br>
linked as a fusion, the resulting protein may be expressed as a fusion protein, or it may be<br>
expressed as separate protein products, or it may be expressed as a fusion protein and then<br>
subsequently broken down into smaller subunits.<br>
Adjuvant<br>
Adjuvants are described in general in Vaccine Design - the Subunit and Adjuvant<br>
Approach eg Powell and Newman, Plenum Press, New York, 1995.<br>
Suitable adjuvants include an aluminium salt such as aluminium hydroxide or aluminium<br>
phosphate, but may also be a salt of calcium, iron or zinc, or may be an insoluble suspension of<br>
acylated tyrosine, or acylated sugars, cationically or anionically derivatised polysaccharides, or<br>
polyphosphazenes.<br>
In the formulation of the invention it is preferred that the adjuvant composition preferentially<br>
induces a Th1 response. However it will be understood that other responses, including other<br>
humoral responses, are not excluded.<br>
It is known that certain vaccine adjuvants are particularly suited to the stimulation of either<br>
Th1 orTh2 - type cytokine responses. Traditionally the best indicators of the Th1:Th2 balance of<br>
the immune response after a vaccination or infection includes direct measurement of the<br>
production of Th1 or Th2 cytokines by T lymphocytes in vitro after restimulation with antigen,<br>
and/or the measurement of the lgG1 :lgG2a ratio of antigen specific antibody responses.<br>
Thus, a Th1-type adjuvant is one which stimulates isolated T-cell populations to produce<br>
high levels of Th1-type cytokines in vivo (as measured in the serum) or ex vivo (cytokines that<br>
are measured when the cells are re-stimulated with antigen in vitro), and induces antigen<br>
specific immunoglobulin responses associated with Th1-type isotype.<br>
Preferred Th1-type immunostimulants which may be formulated to produce adjuvants<br>
suitable for use in the present invention include and are not restricted to the following:<br>
The Toll like receptor (TLR) 4 ligands, especially an agonist such as a lipid A derivative<br>
particularly monophosphoryl lipid A or more particularly 3 Deacylated monophoshoryl lipid A (3<br>
D - MPL).<br>
3 D -MPL is sold under the trademark MPL® by GlaxoSmithKline and primarily<br>
promotes CD4+ T cell responses characterized by the production of IFN-g (Th1 cells i.e. CD4 T<br>
helper cells with a type-1 phenotype). It can be produced according to the methods disclosed in<br>
GB 2 220 211 A. Chemically it is a mixture of 3-deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A with 3,4, 5<br>
or 6 acylated chains. Preferably in the compositions of the present invention small particle 3 D-<br>
MPL is used. Small particle 3 D -MPL has a particle size such that it may be sterile-filtered<br>
through a 0.22(xm filter. Such preparations are described in International Patent Application No.<br>
W094/21292. Synthetic derivatives of lipid A are known and thought to be TLR 4 agonists<br>
including, but not limited to:<br>
OM174(2-deoxy-6-o-[2-deoxy-2-[(R)-3-dodecanoyloxytetra-decanoylamino]-4-o-<br>
phosphono-p-D-glucopyranosyl]-2-[(R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoylamino]-a-D-<br>
glucopyranosyldihydrogenphosphate), (WO 95/14026)<br>
OM 294 DP (3S, 9 R) -3--[(R)-dodecanoyloxytetradecanoylamino]-4-oxo-5-aza-9(R)-<br>
[(R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoylamino]decan-1,10-diol,1,10-bis(dihydrogenophosphate)(WO99<br>
/64301 and WO 00/0462 )<br>
OM 197 MP-Ac DP (3S-, 9R) -3-[(R) -dodecanoyloxytetradecanoylamino]-4-oxo-5-aza-9-<br>
[(R&gt;3-hydroxytetradecanoylamino]decan-1,10-diol,1 -dihydrogenophosphate 10-(6-<br>
aminohexanoate) (WO 01/46127)<br>
Other TLR4 ligands which may be used are alkyl Glucosaminide phosphates (AGPs)<br>
such as those disclosed in WO9850399 or US6303347 (processes for preparation of AGPs are<br>
also disclosed), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of AGPs as disclosed in US6764840.<br>
Some AGPs are TLR4 agonists, and some are TLR4 antagonists. Both are thought to be useful<br>
as adjuvants.<br>
Saponins are also preferred Th1 immunostimulants in accordance with the invention.<br>
Saponins are well known adjuvants and are taught in: Lacaille-Dubois, M and Wagner H. (1996.<br>
A review of the biological and pharmacological activities of saponins. Phytomedicine vol 2 pp<br>
363-386). For example, Quil A (derived from the bark of the South American tree Quillaja<br>
Saponaria Molina), and fractions thereof, are described in US 5,057,540 and "Saponins as<br>
vaccine adjuvants", Kensil, C. R., Crit Rev Ther Drug Carrier Syst, 1996,12 (1-2):1-55; and EP<br>
0 362 279 B1. The haemolytic saponins QS21 and QS 17 (HPLC purified fractions of Quil A)<br>
have been described as potent systemic adjuvants, and the method of their production is<br>
disclosed in US Patent No. 5,057,540 and EP 0 362 279 B1. Also described in these references<br>
is the use of QS7 (a non-haemolytic fraction of Quil-A) which acts as a potent adjuvant for<br>
systemic vaccines. Use of QS21 is further described in Kensil etal. (1991. J. Immunology vol<br>
146, 431-437). Combinations of QS21 and polysorbate or cyclodextrin are also known (WO<br>
99/10008). Particulate adjuvant systems comprising fractions of QuilA, such as QS21 and QS7<br>
are described in WO 96/33739 and WO 96/11711. One such system is known as an Iscom and<br>
may contain one or more saponins.<br>
The adjuvant of the present invention may in particular comprises a Toll like receptor<br>
(TLR) 4 ligand, especially 3D-MPL, in combination with a saponin.<br>
Other suitable adjuvants include TLR 9 ligands (agonists). Thus another preferred<br>
immunostimulant is an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide containing unmethylated CpG<br>
dinucleotides ("CpG"). CpG is an abbreviation for cytosine-guanosine dinucleotide motifs<br>
present in DNA. CpG is known in the art as being an adjuvant when administered by both<br>
systemic and mucosal routes (WO 96/02555, EP 468520, Davis ef a/., J.lmmunol, 1998,<br>
160(2):870-876; McCluskie and Davis, J.lmmunol., 1998, 161(9):4463-6). Historically, it was<br>
observed that the DNA fraction of BCG could exert an anti-tumour effect. In further studies,<br>
synthetic oligonucleotides derived from BCG gene sequences were shown to be capable of<br>
inducing immunostimulatory effects (both in vitro and in vivo). The authors of these studies<br>
concluded that certain palindromic sequences, including a central CG motif, carried this activity.<br>
The central role of the CG motif in immunostimulation was later elucidated in a publication by<br>
Krieg, Nature 374, p546 1995. Detailed analysis has shown that the CG motif has to be in a<br>
certain sequence context, and that such sequences are common in bacterial DNA but are rare<br>
in vertebrate DNA. The immunostimulatory sequence is often: Purine, Purine, C, G, pyrimidine,<br>
pyrimidine; wherein the CG motif is not methylated, but other unmethylated CpG sequences are<br>
known to be immunostimulatory and may be used in the present invention.<br>
In certain combinations of the six nucleotides a palindromic sequence is present.<br>
Several of these motifs, either as repeats of one motif or a combination of different motifs, can<br>
be present in the same oligonucleotide. The presence of one or more of these<br>
immunostimulatory sequences containing oligonucleotides can activate various immune<br>
subsets, including natural killer cells (which produce interferon 7 and have cytolytic activity) and<br>
macrophages (Wooldrige et ai Vol 89 (no. 8), 1977). Other unmethylated CpG containing<br>
sequences not having this consensus sequence have also now been shown to be<br>
immunomodulatory.<br>
CpG when formulated into vaccines, is generally administered in free solution together<br>
with free antigen (WO 96/02555; McCluskie and Davis, supra) or covalently conjugated to an<br>
antigen (WO 98/16247), or formulated with a carrier such as aluminium hydroxide ((Hepatitis<br>
surface antigen) Davis et al. supra ; Brazolot-Millan etal., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci., USA, 1998,<br>
95(26), 15553-8).<br>
Other TLR9 agonists of potential interest include immunostimulatory CpR motif<br>
containing oligonucleotides and YpG motif containing oligonucleotides (Idera).<br>
Such immunostimulants as described above may be formulated together with carriers,<br>
such as for example liposomes, oil in water emulsions, and or metallic salts, including<br>
aluminium salts (such as aluminium hydroxide). For example, 3D-MPL may be formulated with<br>
aluminium hydroxide (EP 0 689 454) or oil in water emulsions (WO 95/17210); QS21 may be<br>
advantageously formulated with cholesterol containing liposomes (WO 96/33739), oil in water<br>
emulsions (WO 95/17210) or alum (WO 98/15287); CpG may be formulated with alum (Davis et<br>
al. supra ; Brazolot-Millan supra) or with other cationic carriers.<br>
Combinations of immunostimulants are also preferred, in particular a combination of a<br>
monophosphoryl lipid A and a saponin derivative (WO 94/00153; WO 95/17210; WO 96/33739;<br>
WO 98/56414; WO 99/12565; WO 99/11241), more particularly the combination of QS21 and<br>
3D-MPL as disclosed in WO 94/00153. Alternatively, a combination of CpG plus a saponin<br>
such as QS21 also forms a potent adjuvant for use in the present invention. Alternatively the<br>
saponin may be formulated in a liposome or in an Iscorn and combined with an<br>
immunostimulatory oligonucleotide.<br>
Thus, suitable adjuvant systems include, for example, a combination of monophosphoryl<br>
lipid A, preferably 3D-MPL, together with an aluminium salt (eg as described in WO00/23105).<br>
An enhanced system involves the combination of a monophosphoryl lipid A and a<br>
saponin derivative particularly the combination of QS21 and 3D-MPL as disclosed in WO<br>
94/00153, or a less reactogenic composition where the QS21 is quenched in cholesterol<br>
containing liposomes (DQ) as disclosed in WO 96/33739. This combination may additionally<br>
comprise an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide.<br>
Thus an example adjuvant comprises QS21 and/or MPL and/or CpG.<br>
A particularly potent adjuvant formulation involving QS21, 3D-MPL &amp; tocopherol in an oil<br>
in water emulsion is described in WO 95/17210 and is another preferred formulation for use in<br>
the invention.<br>
Another preferred formulation comprises a CpG oligonucleotide alone or together with<br>
an aluminium salt.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of manufacture<br>
of a vaccine formulation as herein described, wherein the method comprises admixing one or<br>
more first immunogenic polypeptides according to the invention with a suitable adjuvant.<br>
Particularly preferred adjuvants for use in the formulations according to the invention<br>
are as follows:<br>
i) 3D-MPL + QS21 in a liposome (see eg Adjuvant B below)<br>
Preferably, the adjuvant is presented in the form of a liposome, ISCOM or an oil-in-water<br>
emulsion. In one example embodiment of the invention the adjuvant comprises an oil-in-water<br>
emulsion. In another example embodiment of the invention the adjuvant comprises liposomes.<br>
Suitably the adjuvant component does not contain any virus. Thus suitably, compositions<br>
for use according to the invention do not contain any virus other than the one or more more<br>
adenoviral vectors comprising one or more heterologous polynucleotides encoding one or more<br>
second immunogenic polypeptides derived from a pathogen.<br>
Compositions, dosage and administration<br>
In methods of the invention, the immunogenic polypeptide(s), the adenoviral vector(s)<br>
and the adjuvant are administered concomitantly.<br>
Typically the adjuvant will be co-formulated with an immunogenic polypeptide. Suitably<br>
the adjuvant will also be co-formulated with any other immunogenic polypeptide to be<br>
administered.<br>
Thus in one embodiment of the invention there is provided a method of raising an<br>
immune response which comprises administering (i) one or more first immunogenic<br>
polypeptides co-formulated with an adjuvant; and (ii) one or more adenoviral vectors comprising<br>
one or more heterologous polynucleotides encoding one or more second immunogenic<br>
polypeptides; wherein one or more first immunogenic polypeptides and adjuvant, and one or<br>
more adenoviral vectors are administered concomitantly.<br>
By "co-formulated" is meant that the first immunogenic polypeptide and the adjuvant are<br>
contained within the same composition eg a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Typically the adenoviral vector is contained in a composition eg a pharmaceutical<br>
composition.<br>
Alternatively, the one or more first immunogenic polypeptides, the one or more<br>
adenoviral vectors and an adjuvant are co-formulated.<br>
Thus, there are provided compositions according to the invention which comprise one or<br>
more immunogenic polypeptides, one or more adenoviral vectors, and an adjuvant.<br>
Compositions and methods according to the invention may involve use of more than one<br>
immunogenic polypeptide and/or more than one adenoviral vector. Use of multiple antigens is<br>
especially advantageous in raising protective immune responses to certain pathogens, such as<br>
HIV, M. tuberculosis and Plasmodium sp. Compositions according to the invention may<br>
comprise more than one adjuvant.<br>
Compositions and methods employed according to the invention may typically comprise<br>
a carrier eg an aqueous buffered carrier. Protective components such as sugars may be<br>
included.<br>
Compositions should be administered in sufficient amounts to transduce the target cells<br>
and to provide sufficient levels of gene transfer and expression and to permit pathogen-specific<br>
immune responses to develop thereby to provide a prophylactic or therapeutic benefit without<br>
undue adverse or with medically acceptable physiological effects, which can be determined by<br>
those skilled in the medical arts. Conventional and pharmaceutically acceptable routes of<br>
administration include, but are not limited to, direct delivery to the retina and other intraocular<br>
delivery methods, direct delivery to the liver, inhalation, intranasal, intravenous, intramuscular,<br>
intratracheal, subcutaneous, intradermal, epidermal, rectal, oral and other parenteral routes of<br>
administration. Routes of administration may be combined, if desired, or adjusted depending<br>
upon the gene product or the condition. The route of administration primarily will depend on the<br>
nature of the condition being treated. Most suitably the route is intramuscular, intradermal or<br>
epidermal.<br>
Preferred tissues to target are muscle, skin and mucous membranes. Skin and mucous<br>
membranes are the physiological sites where most infectious antigens are normally<br>
encountered.<br>
When the first immunogenic polypeptide, adjuvant and adenoviral vector are not co-<br>
formulated, the different formulations (eg polypeptide/adjuvant and adenoviral vector<br>
formulations) may be administered by the same route of administration or by different routes of<br>
administration.<br>
Dosages of compositions in the methods will depend primarily on factors such as the<br>
condition being treated, the age, weight and health of the subject, and may thus vary among<br>
subjects. For example, a therapeutically effective adult human or veterinary dosage is generally<br>
in the range of from about 100 p.L to about 100 rnL of a carrier containing concentrations of from<br>
about 1 x 106 to about 1 x 1015 particles, about 1 x 1011 to 1 x 1013 particles, or about 1 x 109 to<br>
1x 1012 particles of virus together with around 1-1000ug, or about 2-1 OOug eg around 4-40ug<br>
immunogenic polypeptide. Dosages will range depending upon the size of the animal and the<br>
route of administration. For example, a suitable human or veterinary dosage (for about an 80<br>
kg animal) for intramuscular injection is in the range of about 1 x 109 to about 5 x 1012 virus<br>
particles and 4-40 ug protein per ml_, for a single site. One of skill in the art may adjust these<br>
doses, depending on the route of administration, and the therapeutic or vaccinal application for<br>
which the composition is employed.<br>
The amount of adjuvant will depend on the nature of the adjuvant and the immunogenic<br>
polypeptide, the condition being treated and the age, weight and health of the subject. Typically<br>
for human administration an amount of adjuvant of 1-100ug eg 10-50 ug per dose may be<br>
suitable.<br>
Suitably an adequate immune response is achieved by a single concomitant<br>
administration of the composition or compositions of the invention in methods of the invention.<br>
However if the immune response is further enhanced by administration of a further dose of first<br>
immunogenic polypeptide, adjuvant and adenoviral vector on a second or subsequent occasion<br>
(for example after a month or two months) then such a protocol is embraced by the invention.<br>
We have found that good pathogen-specific CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cell responses may<br>
typically be raised after a single concomitant administration of the composition or compositions<br>
of the invention in methods of the invention. However we have found that good pathogen-<br>
specific antibody responses may require a second or further concomitant administration of the<br>
composition or compositions of the invention.<br>
The components of the invention may be combined or formulated with any suitable<br>
pharmaceutical excipient such as water, buffers and the like.<br>
Examples<br>
Adjuvant preparations<br>
1) The preparation of oil in water emulsion followed the protocol as set forth In WO<br>
95/17210.<br>
The emulsion contains: 42.72 mg/ml squalene, 47.44 mg/ml tocopherol, 19.4 mg/ml Tween 80.<br>
The resulting oil droplets have a size of approximately 180 nm<br>
Tween 80 was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to give a 2% solution in the PBS.<br>
To provide 100 ml two fold concentrate, emulsion 5g of DL alpha tocopherol and 5ml of<br>
squalene were vortexed until mixed thoroughly. 90ml of PBS/Tween solution was added and<br>
mixed thoroughly. The resulting emulsion was then passed through a syringe and finally<br>
microfluidised by using an M110S microfluidics machine. The resulting oil droplets have a size<br>
of approximately 180 nm<br>
2) Preparation of oil in water emulsion with QS21 and MPL<br>
Sterile bulk emulsion was added to PBS to reach a final concentration of 500 ul of emulsion per<br>
ml (v/v). 3 D-MPL was then added. QS21 was then added Between each addition of<br>
component, the intermediate product was stirred for 5 minutes. Fifteen minutes later, the pH<br>
was checked and adjusted if necessary to 6.8 +/- 0.1 with NaOH or HCI. The final concentration<br>
of 3D-MPL and QS21 was 100 ug per ml for each.<br>
3) Preparation of liposomal MPL<br>
A mixture of lipid (such as phosphatidylcholine either from egg-yolk or synthetic) and cholesterol<br>
and 3 D-MPL in organic solvent, was dried down under vacuum (or alternatively under a stream<br>
of inert gas). An aqueous solution (such as phosphate buffered saline) was then added, and<br>
the vessel agitated until all the lipid was in suspension. This suspension was then microfluidised<br>
until the liposome size was reduced to about 100 nm, and then sterile filtered through a 0.2 urn<br>
filter. Extrusion or sonication could replace this step.<br>
Typically the cholesterol: phosphatidylcholine ratio was 1:4 (w/w), and the aqueous solution was<br>
added to give a final cholesterol concentration of 10 mg/ml.<br>
The final concentration of MPL is 2 mg/ml.<br>
The liposomes have a size of approximately 100 nm and are referred to as SUV (for small<br>
unilamelar vesicles). The liposomes by themselves are stable over time and have no fusogenic<br>
capacity.<br>
4) Preparation of Adjuvant B ("adj B")<br>
Sterile bulk of SUV was added to PBS. PBS composition was Na2HPO4: 9 mM; KH2PO4: 48<br>
mM; NaCI: 100 mM pH 6.1. QS21 in aqueous solution was added to the SUV. The final<br>
concentration of 3D-MPL and QS21 was 100 ug per ml for each. This mixture is referred as<br>
Adjuvant B. Between each addition of component, the intermediate product was stirred for 5<br>
minutes. The pH was checked and adjusted if necessary to 6.1 +/- 0.1 with NaOH or HCI.<br>
Preparation of p24-RT-Nef-P17 protein ("F4")<br>
F4 was prepared as described in WO2006/013106 Example 1, codon-optimised method.<br>
Preparation of Chimp adenovirus Pan7 containing Gaq-RT-Nef transqene ("Pan7GRN'")<br>
Construction of Gag, RT, Nef plasmid.<br>
Plasmid p73i-Tgrn<br>
The full sequence of the Tgm plasmid insert is given in SEQ ID No 1 and the plasmid<br>
construction shown graphically in Fig 1. This contains p17 p24 (codon optimised) Gag, p66 RT<br>
(codon optimised and inactivated) and truncated Nef.<br>
The plasmid P73i-Tgrn was prepared as described in WO03/025003 Examples 1-13.<br>
Construction of the E1/E3 deleted Pan 7 Adenovirus<br>
The E1/E3 deleted Pan 7 Adenovirus was prepared as described in WO2006/120034 Example<br>
1.<br>
Other serotypes of vectors can be constructed in a similar way. A full description of the<br>
construction of E1, E3 and E4 deletions in this and other Pan Adenovirus serotypes is given in<br>
WO03/0046124. Further information is also available in Human Gene Therapy 15:519-530.<br>
Insertion of Gag, RT, Nef sequence into Adenovirus<br>
Using plasmid P73i-Tgrn, the GRN expression cassette was inserted into E1/E3 deleted Pan 7<br>
adenovirus to produce C7-GRNc as described in WO2006/120034 Example 3. C7-GRNc is the<br>
Pan7GRN adenovirus component used in the examples set out herein.<br>
Example 1<br>
Immunogenicitv study in mice immunised with adenovirus component (Pan7GRN) and protein<br>
component (F4/adiuvant B) separately or with both adenovirus and protein components co-<br>
formulated together<br>
The mouse strain used was CB6F1 and 3 mice were used per timepoint. For immunisation with<br>
F4/adjuvant B (P), 1/10 of the human dose was injected i.e. 9 ug of F4 protein in 50uL of<br>
adjuvant B. For immunisation with Pan7GRN (A), 10 x 108 virus particles in 50uL of saline (0.9%<br>
NaCI water for injection solution) was used. The Pan7GRN chimp adenovirus carries the genes<br>
coding for Gag (G), RT (R) and Nef (N).<br><br>
Thus it can be seen that in groups 1 and 2, the mice were immunized with 2 injections of protein<br>
(PP) or adenovirus (AA), respectively. Mice from groups 3 and 4, received a conventional prime-<br>
boost schedule: protein then adenovirus (PPAA) or the other way round (AAPP) whereas in<br>
groups 5 and 6, the mice received one or two injections of a combination (combo) of protein and<br>
adenovirus together according to the invention. Mice from group 7 only received adjuvant<br>
control whereas mice from group 6 were naive.<br>
The following read-outs were performed:<br>
Antibody responses (ELISA performed on the sera from each individual animals from each<br>
group):<br>
-antibody response against F4 (Figure 4)<br>
-antibody response against F4 components p24, RT, Nef and p17 (Figure 5-8)<br>
Cellular responses (Figures 2-3):<br>
-measured by flow cytometry following surface and intracellular cytokine staining after overnight<br>
restimulation of spleen cells with pools of peptides of p24, RT, Nef or p17. The spleen cells of 3<br>
mice per timepoint and per group were pooled for the analysis.<br>
For groups 1 and 2, samples were taken for measurement 21 days after the corresponding final<br>
immunisation. For the remaining groups, measurements were taken 21 days, 56 days and 112<br>
days after the corresponding final immunisation.<br>
Results:<br>
The results are shown in Figures 2-8.<br>
The X axis labels correspond as follows:<br>
PP - Group 1 animals following second immunisation<br>
AA - Group 2 animals following second immunisation<br>
PPAA - Group 3 animals following fourth immunisation<br>
AAPP - Group 4 animals following fourth immunisation<br>
Combo - Group 5 animals following immunisation<br>
Combo x 2 - Group 6 animals following second immunisation<br>
The measurement timepoints (21, 56 or 112 days post last immunisation) are indicated in<br>
parentheses.<br>
Cellular responses (Figure 2-3):<br>
At the timepoints analysed, the data show that CD4+ T-cell responses were observed mainly<br>
against p24, RT and Nef.<br>
As shown in Figures 2a and 2b (left panels), 21 days post last immunisation, the highest CD4+<br>
T-cell responses are observed with two immunisations of adenovirus followed by two<br>
immunisations of protein/adjuvant (Group 4 animals). One injection of the combination of<br>
adenovirus/protein/adjuvant induces higher CD4+ T-cell levels than two injections of<br>
protein/adjuvant following restimulation with p24, RT or Nef peptides.<br>
For restimulation by RT and Nef, two immunisations with the combination of<br>
adenovirus/protein/adjuvant induces a CD4+ T-cell response slightly higher than with one<br>
immunisation with the combination, whereas the responses with one or two immunisations were<br>
identical for p24.<br>
At the timepoints analysed, the CD8+ T-cell responses are mainly observed against the p24 and<br>
RT peptides, and no significant numbers of CD8+ T-cells specific for Nef or p17 were detected.<br>
As shown in Figures 2a and 2b (right panels), 21 days post last immunisation CD8+ T-cell<br>
responses were similar after one or two immunisations with the combination of<br>
adenovirus/protein/adjuvant. The CD8 response against p24 observed in groups immunised<br>
either (i) twice with adenovirus or (ii) twice with adenovirus followed by twice with protein or (iii)<br>
once or twice with the combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant were comparable to each<br>
other and slightly lower than the one from the group immunised twice with protein followed by<br>
twice with adenovirus. The CD8 response against RT observed in groups immunised once or<br>
twice with the combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant were comparable and slightly lower to<br>
the one from the groups immunised either (i) twice with adenovirus or (ii) twice with adenovirus<br>
followed by twice with protein or (iii) twice with protein followed by twice with adenovirus.<br>
The CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were also analysed at later timepoints (56 and 112 days<br>
post last immunisation), when persistence of the responses can be determined (Figures 3a and<br>
3b). The CD4 responses (Fig 3a and 3b, left panels) are mainly observed against p24, RT and<br>
Nef. At these timepoints, the highest CD4 responses are observed in the animals immunised<br>
twice with adenovirus followed by twice with protein. The CD4 response in mice immunised<br>
once or twice with the combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant were comparable to each<br>
other and generally higher than the response observed in groups immunised twice with protein<br>
followed by twice with adenovirus.<br>
At the later timepoints, the CD8 response against p24 is the highest in the group immunised<br>
once with the combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant (Fig 3b, right panel). It is comparable<br>
to the one from animals immunised twice with protein followed by twice with adenovirus and<br>
slightly higher than the one from the animals immunised either (i) twice with the combination of<br>
adenovirus/protein/adjuvant or (ii) twice with adenovirus followed by twice with protein. The<br>
latter two are comparable between each other. The CD8 response against RT is the highest<br>
and similar in groups immunised (i) twice with the combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant or<br>
(ii) twice with adenovirus followed by twice with protein. The CD8 response against RT from<br>
groups immunised (i) twice with the combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant or (ii) twice with<br>
protein followed by twice with adenovirus was slightly lower but comparable between each other<br>
(Figure 3). As shown in figure 3a (right panel), no significant numbers of CD8+ T-cells specific<br>
for Nef or p17 were detected.<br>
Antibody responses:<br>
As shown in Figures 4 to 8, the antibody responses detected are mainly directed against p24<br>
(Fig 5), RT (Fig 6) and Nef (Fig 8). The anti-F4 (Fig 4) response generally mimics the response<br>
observed against each of the p24, RT or Nef components and can be characterized as follows:<br>
- Low to no antibody response is detected in groups immunised (i) twice with adenovirus<br>
or (ii) once with the combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant;<br>
- The highest antibody responses usually detected in group immunised twice with the<br>
protein at 21days post immunisation. However, it is also in this group that the highest<br>
variability between individuals is observed. In addition, for the anti-Nef serology, the<br>
group immunised twice with adenovirus followed by twice with protein appears to display<br>
the highest response, when compared to the other groups;<br>
- The response observed in groups immunised (i)) twice with the combination of<br>
adenovirus/protein/adjuvant or (ii) twice with protein followed by twice with adenovirus or<br>
(iii) twice with adenovirus followed by twice with protein are comparable, peak at 21 days<br>
post last immunisation and then slightly decrease over time.<br>
Antibody responses against p17 (Fig 7) were very low to undetectable in all groups.<br>
Conclusion:<br>
Globally, the highest antigen-specific cell-mediated immune response is observed in the AAPP<br>
treatment group after 4 immunisations. However, when comparing groups after 2 immunisations<br>
(i.e. AA, PP and 2xcombo groups), the induction of both antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell<br>
responses is only observed in the group immunised twice with the protein/adenovirus/adjuvant<br>
combination. In addition, similar levels of CD4 and CD8 T cell responses can be reached after a<br>
single injection of the protein/adenovirus/adjuvant combination. Moreover, in terms of<br>
persistence, the antigen-specific T cell responses observed 112 days after the 2nd immunisation<br>
with the protein/adenovirus/adjuvant combination are comparable to the ones observed 112<br>
days after the 4th immunisations in the AAPP treatment group. Finally, it appears that 2<br>
immunisations with the protein/adenovirus/adjuvant combination are needed to obtain an<br>
antibody response comparable to the one obtained in the group immunised twice with the<br>
adjuvanted protein, group that provided the highest antibody responses in general.<br>
Example 2<br>
Immunoqenicitv study in mice immunised with Pan7GRN adenovirus and F4 protein/adiuvant B<br>
co-formulated together<br>
The mouse strain used was CB6F1 with 9 mice per group. Mice were immunized once with a<br>
co-formulation of the F4 protein (1/10 of the human dose was injected i.e. 9 ug) together with 10<br>
x 108 virus particles of Pan7GRN, in 50uL of adjuvant B or a dilution of the latter (1/2, 1/4 or<br>
1/10). The CD4 and CD8 cellular responses against a pool of either Nef, p17, p24 or RT<br>
peptides were determined 21 days post immunization (3 pools of 3 spleens for each group).<br>
The following read-out was performed:<br>
Cellular responses (Figure 9):<br>
-measured by flow cytometry following surface and intracellular cytokine staining after overnight<br>
restimulation of spleen cells with pools of peptides of p24, RT, Nef or p17. The spleen cells<br>
were pooled (3 pools of 3 spleens per group) for the analysis.<br>
Results:<br>
The results shown in Figure 9 represent the cellular responses observed after restimulation with<br>
a pool of p24 or RT peptides.<br>
The X axis labels correspond as follows:<br>
Adj B - Mice immunised with 9ugF4/ 108vpPan7GRN/ non-diluted adjuvant B<br>
1/2 Adj B- Mice immunised with 9ugF4/ 108vpPan7GRN/ adjuvant B diluted 1/2<br>
1/4 Adj B- Mice immunised with 9u.gF4/ 108vpPan7GRN/ adjuvant B diluted 1/4<br>
1/10 Adj B - Mice immunised with 9ugF4/ 108vpPan7GRN/ adjuvant B diluted 1/10<br>
Naive - Naive mice (no immunisation)<br>
The results indicate that CD4 (Figure 9, left panel) and CD8 (Figure 9, right panel) responses<br>
are mainly observed against p24 and RT, with the CD8 T cell response specific to RT being<br>
lower than the one specific to p24. In addition, the results indicate that the CD4 responses<br>
against p24 and RT at 21 days post-immunisations in the groups immunised with the non-<br>
diluted adjuvant B or a 1/2 dilution of it are similar. These CD4 responses tend to decrease<br>
when the adjuvant is diluted 1/4. When the adjuvant B is diluted at 1/10, the CD4 responses<br>
observed are similar to the ones from groups immunised with the 1/4 dilution of the adjuvant B.<br>
The anti-CD8 responses against p24 are comparable whether the adjuvant is diluted 1/2 or not.<br>
However, the response decreases when the adjuvant B is diluted 1/4 and even more so if it is<br>
diluted 1/10. In contrast, such trends are not seen for the anti-RT CD8 responses where there is<br>
not a real dose range effect of the dose of adjuvant used.<br>
Conclusion:<br>
CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells against F4 components were induced by a single administration of a<br>
composition containing an immunogenic polypeptide, an adenoviral vector containing a<br>
heterologous polynucleotide encoding an immunogenic polypeptide and an adjuvant, even<br>
when the latter was diluted. The impact of adjuvant dilution differed depending on the antigen-<br>
specific CD4 or CD8 responses of interest. In particular the highest responses observed were<br>
against p24 and the anti-p24 CD4 and CD8 T cell responses show a dose range effect<br>
correlating with the dose of adjuvant used in the combination vaccine. While the same effect<br>
can be observed for the anti-RT CD4 T cell response, the dose range effect of the dose of<br>
adjuvant used in the combo is less clear for the anti-RT CD8 T cell response. Finally, if we<br>
consider the global antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses and sum the responses<br>
against the 4 antigens, a dose range can be observed.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Immunooenicitv study in New Zealand white rabbits immunised with Pan7GRN or F4/adjuvant<br>
B sequentially or with both adenovirus and protein components co-formulated together<br>
For immunisation with F4/adjuvant B, the human dose was injected i.e. 90 ug of F4 protein in<br>
500uL of adjuvant B. For immunisation with Pan7GRN, 10 x 1010 or 10 x 1012 virus particles in<br>
500uL of saline were used. For the immunization with both adenovirus and protein components<br>
co-formulated together, 90ug of F4 protein, 10 x 1011 virus particles of Pan7 GRN in 500uL of<br>
adjuvant B were used.<br>
The vaccination schedule was as follows:<br><br>
There were 3 rabbits per group except for group 1 which included only 2 rabbits.<br>
The following read-outs were performed:<br>
Antibody responses (ELISA performed on the sera from each individual animals from each<br>
group):<br>
-antibody response against F4<br>
-antibody response against F4 components p24, RT, Nef and p17<br>
Lymphoproliferative responses:<br>
The lymphoproliferation was determined by the uptake of tritiated thymidine by peripheral blood<br>
mononuclear cells (isolated from whole blood after a density gradient) restimulated in vitro with<br>
pools of Nef, p17, p24 and/or RT peptides for 88 hours in the presence of tritiated thymidine for<br>
the last 16 hours of the incubation.<br>
Results:<br>
Lymphoproliferative response:<br>
As shown in Figure 10, the highest lymphoproliferative responses are observed in the group<br>
immunised twice with protein. The lymphoproliferative response from animals immunised twice<br>
with the combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant was observed in all rabbits from the group.<br>
It actually peaked after one injection and could be further recalled (at similar levels than after<br>
the 1st injection) following a third injection of the combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant,<br>
suggesting that the first two injections did not induce a neutralizing response that would inhibit<br>
any response to a further similar injection. In its intensity, the proliferative response observed in<br>
rabbits immunised with the combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant was comparable to the<br>
one observed in animals immunised once or twice with 1012 viral particles of adenovirus and<br>
appeared higher than the one from animals immunised once or twice with 1010 viral particles of<br>
adenovirus. Altogether, this suggests that using the combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant<br>
could decrease the dose of adenovirus to be used. Finally, after a third injection of the<br>
combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant, the response observed in group 4 was similar to<br>
the one from animals immunised 3 times with the protein (group 1).<br>
Serology:<br>
As shown in Figure 11, the kinetic of the anti-F4 antibody response observed in the animals<br>
immunised twice with the combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant is similar to the one from<br>
animals immunised twice with the protein: it is already detected at 7 days post-2nd injection and<br>
then decrease over time. However, in terms of intensity, the anti-F4 response of animals<br>
immunised twice with the combination of adenovirus/protein/adjuvant remains higher at later<br>
timepoints (21 and 63 days post-2nd immunisation) when compared to the anti-F4 response<br>
from animals immunised twice with the protein. No anti-F4 antibody response is observed in<br>
rabbits immunised once with 1010 viral particles of adenovirus. In rabbits immunised once with<br>
1012 viral particles of adenovirus, an anti-F4 response is only detected at 21 and 63 days post-<br>
immunisation. In that group, the high variability of the response observed at the 63 day post-<br>
immunisation timepoint (d77) results from a single animal (out of the 3) displaying higher titers<br>
against the different F4 components, especially p24 and RT as shown in Figures 12a and 12b<br>
respectively. The anti-F4 antibody response is mainly composed of antibodies targeting p24 and<br>
RT and to a much lesser extent Nef and p17.<br>
Conclusion:<br>
Lymphoproliferative and antibody responses could be induced in rabbits after two injections of a<br>
composition containing an immunogenic polypeptide, an adenoviral vector containing a<br>
heterologous polynucleotide encoding an immunogenic polypeptide and an adjuvant. In<br>
addition, we have evidence that a lymphoproliferative response can be recalled after a third<br>
injection of such composition. Finally, the best antibody response (in intensity and persistence)<br>
is observed with the adenovirus/protein/adjuvant combination.<br>

Immunogenicity of F4 (codon optimized)/adjuvant B and C7-GRN when administrated as<br>
a combination in CB6F1 mice.<br>
Experimental design<br>
CB6F1 mice were immunized twice (days 0 and 21) with different combinations listed below.<br>
F4co/ adjuvant B was used at 9µg F4co/animal in 50ul AdjuvantB (1/10 human dose) and the<br>
C7-GRN virus at 10a viral particles/animal. F4co in Example 4 is F4 prepared as described in<br>
WO2006/013106 Example 1, codon-optimised method.<br><br>
Schedule of immunizations and immune response analysis<br>
Immunisations were carried out at day 0 and day 21. Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) was<br>
carried out at 21 days, 28 days (7 days post immunisation 2), 42 days (21 days post<br>
immunisation 2), and 77 days (56 days post immunisation 2).<br>
Results<br>
HlV-specific CD4 T cell responses<br>
The results are shown in the following figures:<br>
Figure 13. Quantification of HIV-1-specific CD4 T cells. The % of CD3 CD4 T cells secreting<br>
IFN-y and/or IL-2 is represented for each protocol of immunization at four time-points. Peripheral<br>
blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were stimulated ex vivo (2 hours before addition of the Brefeldin then<br>
overnight) with a pool of peptides covering F4 sequence and the cytokine production was<br>
measured by ICS. Each value is the geometric mean of 5 pools of 3 mice.<br>
Figure 14. Distribution of the frequency of F4-specific CD4 T cells 7 days after two<br>
immunizations. The frequency of F4-specific circulating CD4 T cells at 7 days after two<br>
immunizations is represented for each protocol. Each dot represents the value obtained for one<br>
pool of 3 mice.<br>
Figure 15. Cytokine production of F4-specific CD4 T cells 7 days after two immunizations. The<br>
% of F4-specific CD4 T cells secreting IL-2 and/or IFN-y is represented for 5 pools of 3 mice.<br>
Results for the immunization with F4co/ adjuvant B (A), F4co/ adjuvant B /C7 empty (B) and<br>
F4co/ adjuvant B /C7-GRN (C) are presented.<br>
The frequency of F4-specific circulating CD4 T cells reaches 2.82% 21 days after two<br>
immunizations with the F4co/ adjuvant B combination and declines to 0.91% 56 days post-<br>
immunization (Figure 13). Two doses of the C7-GRN virus alone result in 0.52% of F4-specific<br>
circulating CD4 T cells 21 days post last immunization and the presence of the adjuvant<br>
adjuvant B does not alter this response.<br>
The presence of the empty vector C7 or the recombinant C7-GRN virus in addition of the F4co/<br>
adjuvant B mix does not increase nor interfere with the frequency of F4-specific CD4 T cell<br>
response (3.58% and 2.82% respectively, 21 days post-last immunization). Even if no statistical<br>
analysis has been performed, the population distribution suggests that the intensity of the F4-<br>
specific CD4 T cell responses is not different between the three protocols F4co/ adjuvant B,<br>
F4co/ adjuvant B /C7 empty and F4co/ adjuvant B /C7-GRN (Figure 14).<br>
As expected, administration of the F4co without adjuvant B does not induce significant F4-<br>
specific CD4 T cells.<br>
The profile of cytokine production shows that after immunization with F4co/ adjuvant B, the F4-<br>
specific CD4 T cells secrete both IFN-y and IL-2. Addition of C7empty or C7-GRN in the<br>
immunization protocol does not alter this profile.<br>
As a result, these data suggest that the greatest F4-specific CD4 T cell response is obtained<br>
after immunization with the F4co/ adjuvant B combination and that the presence of the C7-GRN<br>
virus does not improve nor alter this response.<br>
Antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses<br>
The results are shown in the following figures<br>
Figure 16. Quantification of HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells. The % of CD3 CD8 T cells secreting<br>
IFN-y and/or IL-2 is represented for each protocol of immunization at four time-points. Peripheral<br>
blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were stimulated ex vivo (2 hours before addition of Brefeldin then<br>
overnight) with a pool of peptides covering F4 and the cytokine production was measured by<br>
ICS. Each value is the geometric mean of 5 pools of 3 mice.<br>
Figure 17. Cytokine production of F4-specific CD8 T cells 7 days after two immunizations. The<br>
% of F4-specific CD8 T cells secreting IL-2 and/or IFN-y is represented for 5 pools of 3 mice.<br>
Results for the immunization with C7-GRN (A), C7-GRN/ adjuvant B (B) and C7-GRN+F4co/<br>
adjuvant B (C) are presented.<br>
After one injection, the recombinant vector C7-GRN induces a high frequency of F4-specific<br>
circulating CD8 T cells (9,70% of total CD8 T cells, 21 days post-immunization) (Figure 4). A<br>
second injection does not boost the F4-specific CD8 T cell response. The F4co/ adjuvant B<br>
combination induces low to undetectable F4-specific CD8 T cells and adding this combination to<br>
the C7-GRN does not improve or impair the F4-specific CD8 T cell response.<br>
The F4-specific CD8 T cell response is delayed when the adjuvant B is added to the C7-GRN,<br>
but reaches the same level as with the C7-GRN alone or the C7-GRN/F4co/ adjuvant B<br>
combination at 21 days post-second immunization.<br>
The F4-specific CD8 T cells mainly secrete IFN-y whether the C7-GRN vector is injected alone<br>
or in combination with F4co/ adjuvant B (Figure 17).<br>
Interestingly, the F4-specific CD8 T cell response persists up to 56 days post-last immunization<br>
without declining, suggesting that the C7 vector elicits high and persistent CD8 T cells.<br>
Conclusions<br>
The F4co/adjuvant B vaccine induces a high frequency of poly-functional HIV-specific CD4 T<br>
cells but no HIV-specific CD8 T cells in CB6F1 mice. In the same animal model, the<br>
recombinant adenovirus C7 expressing Gag, RT and Nef (Ad C7-GRN) induces a high antigen-<br>
specific CD8 T cell response and low to undetectable antigen-specific CD4 T cells. A<br>
combination of F4/ adjuvant B and Ad C7-GRN elicits both antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T<br>
cells at the same time. A combination of three components, F4co, adjuvantB and C7-GRN<br>
elicts the highest levels of both antigen specific CD4 and CD8 T cells at the same time.<br>
Combining F4/ adjuvant B and Ad C7-GRN has an additive effect concerning the intensity of<br>
both arms of the cellular immune response. The effect of the antigen-specific CD4 T cell<br>
response on the functionality of antigen-specific CD8 T cell response remains to be determined<br>
in this model.<br>
Example 5<br>
Immunogenicity of the chimpadenovirus C7 expressing CS2 construct of CSP protein<br>
from Plasmodium falciparum (C7-CS2) when administered alone<br>
Experimental design:<br>
CB6F1 mice were immunized once intramuscularly with a dose range (1010, 109 &amp; 108 viral<br>
particles) of the C7 chimpadenovirus expressing the CSP malaria antigen and the CSP-specific<br>
(C-term and N-term) CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were determined 21, 28 and 35 days post-<br>
injection by ICS (Intra-cellular Cytokine Staining).<br>
CSP-specific CD4 T cell responses<br>
The results are shown in the following figures:<br>
Figure 18. Quantification of CSP-specific CD4 T cells. The % of CD4 T cells secreting IFN-y<br>
and/or IL-2 is represented for each protocol of immunization at three time-points. Peripheral<br>
blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were stimulated ex vivo (2 hours before addition of the Brefeldin then<br>
overnight) with a pool of peptides covering CSP N-term or CSP C-term sequences and the<br>
cytokine production was measured by ICS. The responses to the C-term and N-term peptide<br>
pools were added up and each value is the average of 5 pools of 4 mice.<br>
Figure 19. Quantification of CSP-specific CD8 T cells. The % of CD8 T cells secreting IFN-y<br>
and/or IL-2 is represented for each protocol of immunization at three time-points. Peripheral<br>
blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were stimulated ex vivo (2 hours before addition of the Brefeldin then<br>
overnight) with a pool of peptides covering CSP N-term or CSP C-term sequences and the<br>
cytokine production was measured by ICS. The responses to the C-term and N-term peptide<br>
pools were added up and each value is the average of 5 pools of 4 mice.<br>
These results indicate that both 1010 and 109 doses of C7-CS2 elicit similar levels of CSP-<br>
specific CD4 T cell responses (peak 0.5%) and similar levels of CSP-specific CD8 T cell<br>
responses (peak 8%). The dose of 1010 of C7-CS2 was chosen in subsequent experiments<br>
where the immunogenicity of C7-CS2 in combination with RTS.S was tested (see below).<br>
Example 6<br>
Immunogenicity of C7-CS2 and RTS.S when administered as a combination in CB6F1<br>
mice<br>
Experimental design:<br>
CB6F1 mice were immunized three times intramuscularly (day 0, 14 &amp; 28) with either a<br>
combination of the malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S (5ug) in 50ul of Adjuvant B (referred as P-<br>
P-P in the figures below) or a combination of RTS.S (5ug) and C7-CS2(101C viral particles) in<br>
50ul of Adjuvant B (referred as C-C-C in the figures below). The CSP-specific (C-term and N-<br>
term) CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were determined at the following time-points:<br>
- 7 days post 2 immunizations<br>
-7,21, 35 and 49 days post 3 immunizations<br>
CSP-specific T cell responses were determined by ICS (Intra-cellular Cytokine Staining).<br>
The CSP-specific antibody responses in the sera from immunized animals were also<br>
determined by ELISA at 14 and 42 days post- 3rd immunization.<br>
CSP-specific CD4 T cell responses<br>
The results are shown in the following figures:<br>
Figure 20. Quantification of CSP(N-term)-specific CD4 T cells. The % of CD4 T cells secreting<br>
IFN-y and/or IL-2 is represented for each protocol of immunization at five time-points. Peripheral<br>
blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were stimulated ex vivo (2 hours before addition of the Brefeldin then<br>
overnight) with a pool of peptides covering the CSP N-term sequence and the cytokine<br>
production (IFNg and/or IL-2) was measured by ICS. Each value is the average of 4 pools of 7<br>
mice.<br>
Figure 21. Quantification of CSP(C-term)-specific CD4 T cells. The % of CD4 T cells secreting<br>
IFN-y and/or IL-2 is represented for each protocol of immunization at five time-points. Peripheral<br>
blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were stimulated ex vivo (2 hours before addition of the Brefeldin then<br>
overnight) with a pool of peptides covering the CSP C-term sequence and the cytokine<br>
production (IFNg and/or IL-2) was measured by ICS. Each value is the average of 4 pools of 7<br>
mice.<br>
These results indicate that mice immunized with 3 injections of the combination [RTS.S + C7-<br>
CS2 1010 +Adjuvant B] display higher antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses (both against the<br>
C-term and N-term part of CSP) than the mice immunized with 3 injections of RTS.S+Adjuvant<br>
B.<br>
CSP-specific CD8 T cell responses<br>
The results are shown in the following figures:<br>
Figure 22. Quantification of CSP(N-term)-specific CD8 T cells. The % of CD8 T cells secreting<br>
IFN-y and/or IL-2 is represented for each protocol of immunization at five time-points. Peripheral<br>
blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were stimulated ex vivo (2 hours before addition of the Brefeldin then<br>
overnight) with a pool of peptides covering the CSP N-term sequence and the cytokine<br>
production (IFNg and/or IL-2) was measured by ICS. Each value is the average of 4 pools of 7<br>
mice.<br>
Figure 23. Quantification of CSP(C-term)-specific CD8 T cells. The % of CD8 T cells secreting<br>
IFN-y and/or IL-2 is represented for each protocol of immunization at five time-points. Peripheral<br>
blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were stimulated ex vivo (2 hours before addition of the Brefeldin then<br>
overnight) with a pool of peptides covering the CSP C-term sequence and the cytokine<br>
production (IFNg and/or IL-2) was measured by ICS. Each value is the average of 4 pools of 7<br>
mice.<br>
These results indicate that mice immunized with 3 injections of the combination [RTS,S + C7-<br>
CS2 1010 + Adjuvant B ] display higher antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses (both against the<br>
C-term and N-term part of CSP) than the mice immunized with 3 injections of RTS,S+Adjuvant<br>
B.<br>
CSP-specific antibody responses<br>
The results are shown in the following figure:<br>
Figure 24. Quantification of CSP-specific antibody titers.The sera from the mice were collected<br>
at 14 and 42 days post 3rd immunization. The anti-CSP antibody titers were measured in each<br>
of these individual sera by ELISA. The data shown is the geometric mean antibody titers + 95%<br>
confidence interval.<br>
These results indicate that mice immunized with 3 injections of the combination [RTS.S + C7-<br>
CS2 1010 + Adjuvant B ] display similar CSP-specific antibody titers than the mice immunized<br>
with 3 injections of RTS.S+Adjuvant B.<br>
Conclusions<br>
The RTS.S/adjuvant B vaccine induces a high frequency of CSP C-term-specific CD4 T cells<br>
but no CSP N-term specific CD4 T cells. In addition, the RTS.S/adjuvant B vaccine induces low<br>
to undetectable CSP C&amp; N-term specific CD8 T cells. In the same animal model, the<br>
recombinant adenovirus C7 expressing CSP induces high CSP(C-term and N-term)-specific<br>
CD8 T cell responses and lower CSP(C-term and N-term)-specific CD4 T cell responses. A<br>
combination of RTS,S/ adjuvant B and Ad C7-CS2 elicits high levels of both CSP(C-term and N-<br>
term)-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells at the same time. Combining RTS.S/ adjuvant B and Ad C7-<br>
CS2 has an additive effect concerning the intensity of both arms of the T cell response. Finally,<br>
the combination of RTS,S/ adjuvant B and Ad C7-CS2 elicits high levels of CSP-specific<br>
antibody responses that are comparable to the ones induced by RTS.S/adjuvant B.<br>
