RO/KR 02.04.2007 TUYERE OF MELTER-GASIFIER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an injection tuyere of a melter-gasifier. 5 More specifically, the present invention relates- to an injection tuyere of a melter-gasifier into which various fuels or resources, including fine coals, along with oxygen in a gas or liquid state are injected during an iron making process for manufacturing molten irons from iron ores. Background Art<br>
10	Generally, a plurality of tuyeres are installed in an outer surface of a lower side of a melter-gasifier for manufacturing molten irons from iron ores along a circumferential direction, as part of the iron making process of an iron making plant. Oxygen and steam are injected into the melter-gasifier into which the iron ores were charged through the tuyeres.<br>
15	A back end of the tuyere is connected to an oxygen lance for supplying oxygen and the tuyere is also connected to a steam injection tube provided with an open/close valve to supply steam as well as pure oxygen to the melter-gasifier.<br>
Accordingly, the pure oxygen and the steam injected into the melter-gasifier through the oxygen lance and the steam injection tube generate a chemical reaction 20      with a coal bed packed in the melter-gasifier, and thereby heat and a reducing gas are generated.<br>
In this case, lumped fuels or resources are generally supplied to the melter-gasifier. However, considering the economic value of the operation, it is necessary to inject the fuels and resources in a particle or liquid state, such as fine coals, into 25      the melter-gasifier.<br>
Meanwhile, when molten irons are manufactured by using a blast furnace, fine coals are injected into the blast furnace through a fine coal injection tube installed in a center portion of a passage though which hot air (air with a high temperature of about 1000 Â°C) is passed to promote mixing of the fine coals and the 30      hot air and to improve combustion efficiency in the blast furnace.<br>
However, in the case that the above method is applied to a melter-gasifier into which pure oxygen is injected, a phenomenon where the tuyere is damaged can occur since the fine coals are extremely combusted in front of the tuyere. Therefore, it is difficult to inject fine coals with pure oxygen into the melter-gasifier.<br>
35	To solve the above problems, Korean Patent Publication No. 2002-0032674 discloses a structure for injecting fine coals and oxygen by using another passage to<br>
1<br><br>
PCT/KR2007/000931<br>
RO/KR 02.04.2007<br>
inject the fine coals into the melter-gasifier through the tuyere.<br>
In the above disclosed structure, when the fine coals are injected into the melter-gasifier through the fine coal injection tube, the fine coals are transferred through the fine coal injection tube with a quick speed (from 30m/s to 50m/s) by a 5      transferring gas such as a nitrogen gas.<br>
Meanwhile, in the above process, transferred particles of the fine coals collide with the wall of the fine coal injection tube and so the wall is continuously worn.<br>
That is to say, the high kinetic energy of the transferred particles of the fine 10 coals is converted into impact energy, and thereby fatigue of the injection tube is accumulated, leading eventually to the fine coal injection tube breaking.<br>
As described above, the fine coals are directly collided with the tuyere body if the fine coal injection tube is broken. Accordingly, since the tuyere body is generally made of a material that is weak against abrasion and impact, it can be 15      easily broken by the fine coals.<br>
In addition, as described above, when the tuyere body is broken, cooling water circulating in the tuyere body enters into the melter-gasifier through the broken portion, and thereby an explosion in the melter-gasifier can be caused.<br>
20	DISCLOSURE<br>
Technical Problem<br>
The present invention was contrived to solve the above problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide an injection tuyere of a melter-gasifier to prevent an explosion in the melter-gasifier that can be caused by an inflow of 25      cooling water as described above.    In addition, another object of the present invention is to prevent the tuyere body from being broken and so lengthen longevity of the injection tuyere. Technical Solution<br>
To accomplish the above object, an injection tuyere of a melter-gasifier 30 according to the present invention includes a tuyere body, an opening for injecting oxygen that is formed to penetrate a center portion of the tuyere body, a cooling tube that is formed in the tuyere body, a fine coal injection tube that is formed to penetrate the tuyere body away from the opening for injecting oxygen, and a protection tube that is formed to surround the fine coal injection tube.<br>
35	In this case, the protection tube may be extended outside of a back end of the tuyere body, a socket may be provided in an end of the protection tube, and a<br>
2<br><br>
PCT/KR2007/000931<br>
RO/KR 02.04.2007<br>
guiding tube into which the fine coal injection tube is inserted may be combined with the socket.<br>
In addition, the protection tube may be made of high carbon steel with wear resistance.<br>
5	In addition, the cooling tube may further include a cooling water body chamber for cooling the tuyere body, a nose cooling water supplying tube for cooling a front end of the tuyere, and a sidewall that is inserted between the cooling water body chamber and the nose cooling water supplying tube.<br>
In this case, the sidewall may be made of copper. 10      Advantageous Effects<br>
In an injection tuyere of the melter-gasifier according to the present invention, when a fine coal injection tube is broken, it can be easily removed from the protection tube and so only the fine coal injection tube need be exchanged. Therefore, the injection tuyere, which has a high cost, can be used for a long time. 15	In addition, the cooling water is prevented from entering into the melter-gasifier, and thereby the melter-gasifier can stably operate for a long time.<br>
