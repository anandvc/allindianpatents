				<td>The present invention relates to a terminal fitting and connector.<br>
The present invention relates to a terminal fitting and to a connector provided therewith.<br>
A general construction of a terminal fitting provided with a terminal erroneous-insertion preventing function is known e.g. from Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H10-144379. This terminal fitting is provided with a stabilizer formed by embossing an inner wall of a main portion of a terminal fitting to project out for the prevention of an erroneous insertion and a recess formed in an inner wall of a cavity corresponding to this stabilizer, so that the insertion is hindered to prevent an erroneous insertion of the terminal fitting if an attempt is made to insert the terminal fitting upside down into the cavity. On the other hand, a general construction of a terminal fitting provided with a function of preventing a tongue piece from being excessively deflected to be deformed is known from Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2005-183160. This terminal fitting is provided with preventing pieces bulging out at the opposite widthwise edges of a tongue piece and openings formed in side surfaces of a main portion facing these preventing pieces, so that the preventing pieces can be engaged with the edges of the openings. If these terminal fittings are simply combined, a terminal fitting 103 in which excessive deformation preventing portions (preventing pieces 114B and preventing portions 116A) are provided substantially in a front half and a <br>
terminal erroneous-insertion preventing portion (stabilizer 117) is provided substantially in a rear half as shown in FIG. 14 can be obtained.<br>
However, the above terminal fitting 103 is disadvantageous in terms of miniaturization since the excessive deformation preventing portions and the terminal erroneous-insertion preventing portion are independently arranged and respectively require spaces. As a result, locations for other functional parts are limited, thereby causing a problem of a reduced degree of freedom in design.<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above problem and an object thereof is to extend functional parts while improving a degree of freedom in design.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a terminal fitting, comprising:<br>
a substantially tubular main portion that can be at least partly accommodated into a cavity penetrating a connector housing substantially in forward and backward directions,<br>
a tongue piece resiliency deformable along height direction on or at least partly inside the main portion,<br>
at least one projection bulging out from at least one widthwise lateral edge of the tongue piece,<br>
at least one preventing portion engageable with the projection and formed at or on a side surface portion of the main portion substantially facing the projection,<br><br>
the projection coming into engagement with the preventing portion to prevent an excessive deformation of the tongue piece when the tongue piece is resiliency deformed within the resiliency limit thereof, and<br>
at least one protrusion formed at or on the side surface portion to project substantially outward and adapted to prevent an erroneous insertion of the terminal fitting, the preventing portion being formed at or near a boundary edge between the projection and the side surface portion around the protrusion.<br>
Accordingly, since the preventing portion is formed at the boundary edge between the protrusion and the side surface portion around or near the protrusion, a terminal erroneous-insertion preventing portion and a tongue-piece excessive deformation preventing portion are arranged at the substantially same location, which contributes to the miniaturization of the terminal fitting and ensures a location for an other functional part to increase a degree of freedom in design.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the at least one protrusion is formed by embossing a part of the inner wall of the side surface portion to project substantially outward and adapted to prevent an erroneous insertion of the terminal fitting, the preventing portion being formed at or near a boundary edge between the embossed part of the inner wall of the projection and the inner wall of the side surface portion around the protrusion.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a terminal fitting, comprising:<br>
a tubular main portion that can be accommodated into a cavity penetrating a connector housing in forward and backward directions,<br><br>
a tongue piece resiliency deformable along height direction inside the main portion,<br>
a projection bulging out from a widthwise lateral edge of the tongue piece,<br>
a preventing portion engageable with the projection and formed at a side surface portion of the main portion facing the projection,<br>
the projection coming into engagement with the preventing portion to prevent an excessive deformation of the tongue piece when the tongue piece is resiliency deformed within the resiliency limit thereof, and<br>
a protrusion formed by embossing a part of the inner wall of the side surface portion to project outward and adapted to prevent an erroneous insertion of the terminal fitting, the preventing portion being formed at a boundary edge between the embossed part of the inner wall of the projection and the inner wall of the side surface portion around the protrusion.<br>
Accordingly, since the preventing portion is formed at the boundary edge between the embossed part of the inner wall of the protrusion and the inner wall of the side surface portion around the protrusion, a terminal erroneous-insertion preventing portion and a tongue-piece excessive deformation preventing portion are arranged at the same location, which contributes to the miniaturization of the terminal fitting and ensures a location for an other functional part to increase a degree of freedom in design.<br>
Preferably, the protrusion is formed by embossing a part of the side surface portion between two or more slits extending substantially in longitudinal direction while being spaced apart in height direction.<br><br>
Accordingly, since edge portions of a part where the slits are made serve as the preventing portion, these edge portions can be made flat to stably prevent the excessive deformation. Further, since the protrusion can bulge outward to a large extent, an erroneous insertion preventing function can be improved.<br>
Further preferably, the substantially entire surface of the protrusion is continuous with the side surface portion substantially without any interruption.<br>
Accordingly, since the substantially entire surface of the protrusion is continuous with the side surface portion substantially without any interruption, the protrusion can have a closed structure, wherefore a likelihood of external matters entering the main portion from the outside can be avoided.<br>
Further preferably, one or more supporting surfaces are formed to project from the side surface portion(s), wherein the supporting surfaces can supporting the a portion of the tongue piece when the tongue piece is deformed.<br>
Still further preferably, the tongue piece is supported at two portions separated in longitudinal direction, at least when the tongue piece is deformed.<br>
Most preferably, the tongue piece is supported by having an extending end portion held in contact with a supporting surface raised from the side surface portion at least when the tongue piece is deformed.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a connector comprising a connector housing, comprising:<br>
at least one terminal fitting according to the invention or a preferred embodiment thereof having a substantially tubular main portion that is at least<br><br>
partly accommodated into a cavity penetrating the connector housing substantially in forward and backward directions.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the connector further comprises at least one locking portion arranged in or at the cavity for locking the terminal fitting at least partly accommodated the cavity, wherein the locking portion comprises a base portion and a locking projection projecting in a direction intersecting the forward and backward directions from the inner surface of the base portion.<br>
Preferably, the locking projection is at least partly, preferably substantially fully located in a locking hole of the terminal fitting when the locking portion locks the terminal fitting, so that a reference surface between the base portion and the locking projection is substantially flush with a plane of opening of the locking hole when the locking portion is engaged with the terminal fitting.<br>

A first preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 12. A connector in this embodiment includes a connector housing 1, through which a cavity 2 penetrates substantially in forward and backward directions FBD. A side where the connector is to be connected with a mating connector is referred to as front or front side. A front portion (preferably a substantially front half) of the cavity 2 is a terminal accommodating hole 2A preferably having a substantially rectangular cross section, whereas a rear portion (preferably a substantially rear half) thereof is a resilient-plug or rubber-plug mounting hole 2B preferably having a substantially round or rounded cross section. A terminal fitting 3 can be at least partly<br><br>
accommodated into the cavity 2 from an insertion side, preferably substantially from behind as shown in FIG. 1. The terminal fitting 3 is stopped at or near its frontmost position by a front wall 4 in or at the cavity 2, and is prevented from coming out in withdrawal direction (preferably substantially backward) by a locking portion 5 provided in the cavity 2. Further, the front wall 4 is formed with the male-tab insertion hole 4A through which a male tab (not shown) provided in a mating connector housing is or can be at least partly inserted.<br>
The terminal fitting 3 has a shape substantially elongated in forward and backward directions FBD as a whole, and is preferably formed by punching, cutting and/or press-forming a conductive (preferably metal) sheet out and bending, bending, embossing and/or folding a punched-out conductive (metal) sheet. As shown in FIG. 7, the terminal fitting 3 is comprised of a main portion 6 (preferably substantially in the form of a rectangular tube), a wire connection portion (preferably comprising a wire barrel portion 7) to be connected (preferably crimped or bent or folded into connection) with a core or conductor of a wire W, and a wire holding portion (preferably comprising an insulation barrel portion 9) to be connected (preferably crimped or bent or folded into connection) with an insulation coating of the wire W and/or a resilient or rubber plug 8. When the terminal fitting 3 is at least partly inserted into the cavity 2, the main portion 6 is at least partly accommodated into the terminal accommodating hole 2A and the resilient (preferably rubber) plug 8 is at least partly accommodated in the resilient-plug (rubber-plug) mount hole 2B.<br>
The resilient plug 8 is made of a resilient material, for example, silicon, preferably has a substantially cylindrical shape as a whole and is formed with a wire insertion hole penetrating substantially in forward and backward directions<br><br>
FED (longitudinal direction) substantially in the center. An end of the wire W is at least partly inserted into this wire insertion hole, so that the resilient plug 8 can be mounted on the insulation coating at this end. The outer circumferential surface of the front end of the resilient (rubber) plug 8 serves as a fastening portion 10 to be wound by the insulation barrel portion 9, and the insulation barrel portion 9 is crimped or bent or folded into connection with this fastening portion 10 to hold the rubber plug 8 in the terminal fitting 3. One or more, preferably a plurality of (three in a shown example) lips 11 arranged preferably substantially side by side while being spaced at specified (predetermined or predeterminable) intervals in forward and backward directions FED are at least partly circumferentially formed on the outer circumferential surface of the resilient (rubber) plug 8 preferably substantially behind the fastening portion 10. The respective lips 11 project radially outward, and come or can come into close contact with the inner circumferential surface of the resilient-plug mount hole 2B to prevent the entrance of fluids such as water to the inside through the resilient-plug mount hole 2B when the resilient plug 8 is at least partly inserted into the cavity 2.<br>
The locking portion 5 preferably is in the form of a cantilever projecting substantially forward at the lateral (preferably bottom) surface of the terminal accommodating hole 2A. This locking portion 5 is resiliency deformable and a deformation space S is defined outside of (e.g. substantially below) the locking portion 5. The locking portion 5 is comprised of a base portion 5A extending substantially forward from the back wall of the deformation space S and a locking projection 5B projecting in a direction intersecting the forward and backward directions FBD (preferably substantially inwardly or upward) from the<br><br>
inner (upper) surface of the front end of the base portion 5A. This locking projection 5B preferably is formed to be narrowed toward the top. FIG. 12(A) is an enlarged view of the locking portion 5 in FIG. 1, and FIG. 12(B) is a section along XII-XII (boundary line between the base portion 5A and the locking projection 5B) of FIG. 12(A), wherein this boundary serves as a horizontal reference surface B. A portion behind the locking portion 5 is substantially continuous with the locking portion 5 while preferably having the same height or radial position as the reference surface B and/or has the same width as the base portion 5A, and/or preferably is in the form of a rib projecting from the lateral (bottom) surface of the terminal accommodating hole 2A. In other words, the reference surface B corresponds to the intermediate or contact surface between the locking projection 5B and the base portion 5A, wherein the normal vector of the reference surface B is arranged at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to the forward and backward directions FBD and/or wherein the reference surface B is tangential to at least part of the sliding-contact surface 5E (described below) and/or is preferably substantially horizontal. The inner or upper surface of this portion serves as a substantially horizontal sliding-contact surface 5E, on which a lateral (bottom) surface portion 6A of the main portion 6 substantially slides while being supported from outside or below when the terminal fitting 3 is being inserted. As a result, the terminal fitting 3 is at least partly inserted into the terminal accommodating hole 2A while resiliency deforming the locking portion 5 at least partly into the deformation space S, and the locking projection 5B is at least partly, preferably substantially fully located in a locking hole 12 preferably in its substantially entire area (entire height and width range) when the locking portion 5 is at least partly restored. In<br><br>
other words, the reference surface B preferably is substantially flush with a plane of opening of the locking hole 12 when the locking portion 5 is engaged with the terminal fitting 3 and, hence, means a shear surface against a shear force exerted when the terminal fitting 3 is pulled in withdrawal direction or backward.<br>
The deformation space S preferably makes an opening in the front surface of the connector housing 1, and this opening forms at least part of a jig insertion hole 13 by communicating with the male tab insertion hole 4A. An unlocking jig (not shown) is or can be at least partly inserted through this jig insertion hole 13 to resiliency deform the locking portion 5, whereby the locked state of the terminal fitting 3 can be canceled. As shown in FIG. 8, the jig insertion hole 13 substantially communicates with the inside of the terminal accommodating hole 2A, wherefore the locking portion 5 can be seen from front as shown in FIG. 10. Further, one or more, preferably a pair of supporting surfaces 4B are formed to bulge out from the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise side(s) of the terminal accommodating hole 2A between the jig insertion hole 13 and the terminal accommodating hole 2A, thereby preventing the terminal fitting 3 from falling outwardly or down.<br>
The main portion 6 of the terminal fitting 3 is comprised of the lateral (bottom) surface portion 6A, opposite side surface portions 6B, 6B projecting or standing up from the lateral portion(s), preferably the substantially opposite widthwise edges of the bottom surface portion 6A, and an ceiling upper surface portion 6C formed by bending one or both of distal or upper parts of the opposite side surface portions 6B substantially inward and preferably at least partly placing the bent parts one substantially over the other preferably to<br><br>
substantially face the bottom surface portion 6A. The inner (lower) part of the preferably double-layered upper surface portion 6C is embossed to project inwardly (down) substantially in longitudinal direction, thereby forming a contact projection 6D as shown in FIG. 1. On the other hand, a resiliency deformable tongue piece 14 is folded substantially back at or near the front edge of the lateral (bottom) surface portion 6A. Cuts are made in the substantially opposite side surface portions 6B of the main body 6 at positions substantially corresponding to the opposite widthwise edges of a front edge 14D) of the tongue piece 14 (front edge of the bottom surface portion 6A), thereby exposing the front edge 14D to the outside.<br>
The tongue piece 14 preferably has an angle or embossed section and has a dome-shaped contact point 14A substantially projecting upward (or inward or toward the contact projection 6D) at its top or apex as shown in FIG. 1. A distance between the contact projection 6D and the contact point 14A is set such that the male tab is resiliency sandwiched between the contact projection 6 and the contact point 14A upon being at least partly inserted into the main portion 6 through the male tab insertion hole 4A. Further, one or more, preferably a pair of preventing pieces (corresponding to a preferred projection) 14B bulge out at the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise side(s) of the contact point 14A of the tongue piece 14. An extending end portion 14C of the tongue piece 14 extending substantially backward from the contact portion 14A is bent up or inwardly at or near its end although only slightly.<br>
The locking hole 12 preferably is formed over the substantially entire width in the lateral (bottom) surface portion 6A of the main portion 6. The locking projection 5B of the locking portion 5 is at least partly insertable into this<br><br>
locking hole 12. The locking projection 5B has an overhanging or undercut front end surface inclined forward and a slanted surface 5D having a moderate downward or outward inclination toward the back from the inner (upper) edge of the front end surface 5C. With the locking portion 5 located in the main portion 6 through the locking hole 12, the front end surface 5C of the locking projection 5B is or can be engaged with the front edge 12A of the locking hole 12 to prevent the terminal fitting 3 from coming out in the withdrawal direction or substantially backward.<br>
One or more, preferably a pair of supporting surfaces 15 are formed to project from the (preferably substantially opposite) side surface portion(s) 6B by raising the rear end of the locking hole 12 from the bottom surface portion 6A of the main portion 6. The respective supporting surfaces 15 are for supporting the extending end portion 14C of the tongue piece 14 when the male tab is at least partly inserted, and engagement margins with the extending end portion 14C preferably are given or formed by bending sections from the bottom surface portion 6A to the side surface portions 6B substantially inward as shown in FIG. 4. The extending end portion 14C is at least partly in contact with the inner (upper) surfaces of the supporting surfaces 15 of this embodiment even before the male tab is inserted. The length of the supporting surfaces 15 substantially in forward and backward directions FBD is set such that the extending end portion 14C is supported on the inner (upper) surfaces of the supporting surfaces 15 until the male tab is inserted to a substantially proper position. In other words, the tongue piece 14 preferably is supported at two points, i.e. at the front edge 14D and at the extending end portion 14C, wherefore a contact pressure with the male tab can be strengthened to improve<br><br>
contact reliability as compared to a case where the tongue piece  14 is supported only at the front edge 14D.<br>
The locking projection 5B receives a shear force substantially in forward and backward directions FBD from the front edge 12A when the terminal fitting 3 is pulled in withdrawal direction or substantially backward with the locking projection 5B engaged with the front edge 12A of the locking hole 12. Accordingly, in order to ensure a holding force against the backward withdrawal of the terminal fitting 3, it is advantageous to possibly maximally extend a dimension of the locking projection 5B in forward and backward directions FBD at a height or radial position where the shear force is received, hence, to possibly enlarge a sectional area against the shear force. Thus, the locking projection 5B is formed such that the rear end of the slanted surface 5D reaches such a position substantially aligned with the rear end of the opening edge of the locking hole 12. As a result, the front end surface 5C of the locking projection 5B can be located before the extending end portion 14C of the tongue piece 14 and the rear end of the slant surface 5D of the locking projection 5B can be located behind the extending end portion 14C of the tongue piece 14 by locating the extending end portion 14C of the tongue piece 14 more inwardly than the locking projection 5B. Further, an inward or upward inclination toward the front of the slanted surface 5D preferably is set such that the interference of the tongue piece 14 and the locking projection 5B can be securely avoided by providing the supporting surfaces 15 and/or a spacing between the slanted surface 5D of the locking projection 5B and the lower surfaces of the supporting surfaces 15 is minimized. It should be noted that a rear side of the slanted surface 5D preferably is inclined to such an extent that<br><br>
the locking portion 5 can be resiliency deformed into the deformation space S substantially without deforming the front edge 14D of the tongue piece 14 when the terminal fitting 3 is at least partly inserted into the cavity 2 from th insertion direction, preferably substantially from behind.<br>
One or more, preferably a pair of openings are formed at one or more positions of the side surface portions 6B of the main portion 6 substantially facing the preventing pieces 14B of the tongue piece 14, and the edges of these openings preferably serve as preventing portions 16. The preventing portions 16 are for preventing an excessive deformation of the tongue piece 14 by the engagement of the preventing pieces 14B and the preventing portions 16 when the tongue piece 14 is resiliency deformed substantially outward or in vertical direction VD within its resiliency limit. FIG. 3 is a vertical section showing the preventing portions 16 from front, wherein the second preventing portion 16B at the lateral (left) side is formed by boring the corresponding lateral (left) side surface portion 6B in FIG. 3 and the second preventing portion 16A at the other lateral (right) side is formed by causing a part of the corresponding lateral (right) side surface portion 6B in FIG. 3 to project outward. Specifically, the first preventing portion 16A is formed by making a pair of slits long in forward and backward directions FED and vertically spaced apart and by embossing an area at least partly enclosed or defined by these slits from the inner side of the main portion 6 to project outward. At this time, a stabilizer (corresponding to a preferred protrusion) 17 particularly having a later-described function of preventing an erroneous insertion of the terminal fitting 3 and/or of stabilizing its insertion is formed at the outer side of the first preventing portion 16A preferably by embossing. In other words, the first<br><br>
preventing portion 16A is the edge of the opening made in the inner wall of the side surface portion 6B (preferably by embossing or pressing) upon forming the stabilizer 17, and the preventing piece 14B is engageable with this opening edge. Thus, the erroneous insertion of the terminal fitting 3 and the excessive deformation of the tongue piece 14 can be prevented to be substantially at the same position, thereby increasing locations where other functional parts are formed and increasing a degree of freedom in design.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, a front end surface 17A of the stabilizer 17 is projecting from (preferably substantially normal to) the side surface portion 6B. As shown in FIG. 11, the inner wall of the cavity 2 is recessed to form a guiding recess 18 at a position substantially facing the stabilizer 17 when the terminal fitting 3 is at least partly inserted into the cavity 2 from the insertion side, preferably substantially from behind. This guiding recess 18 is formed to extend substantially in forward and backward directions FBD from the rear end of the terminal accommodating hole 2A to a position near or at the front end thereof in the cavity 2 as shown in FIG. 8. On the other hand, a detecting recess 19 is formed at a position substantially symmetrical to the guiding recess 18 with respect to the widthwise center in the cavity 2 by partly cutting a portion near the rear end of the terminal accommodating hole 2A. Thus, when the terminal fitting 3 is inserted in a substantially proper posture into the cavity 2, the guiding recess 18 permits the entrance of the stabilizer 17 to permit the insertion of the terminal fitting 3. However, if the terminal fitting 3 is inserted in an improper orientation (such as upside down) into the cavity 2, the front end surface 17A of the stabilizer 17 comes into contact with the front end surface of the detecting recess 19, thereby preventing the entrance of the stabilizer 17 at a position<br><br>
near the rear end of the terminal accommodating hole 2A. Thus, an erroneous insertion of the terminal fitting 3 can be detected.<br>
Next, functions of this embodiment constructed as above are described below.<br>
First, the terminal fitting 3 is at least partly inserted into the cavity 2 from the insertion side, preferably substantially from behind. At this time, when the terminal fitting 3 is inserted in the substantially proper position into the cavity 2, the guiding recess 18 permits the entrance of the stabilizer 17 to permit the insertion of the terminal fitting 3. However, if the terminal fitting 3 is inserted in the improper orientation (such as upside down) into the cavity 2, the front end surface 17A of the stabilizer 17 comes substantially into contact with the front end surface of the detecting recess 19 to prevent the erroneous insertion of the terminal fitting 3 and/or to detect the improper orientation thereof. When the front edge 14D of the tongue piece 14 moves onto the locking projection 5B while the bottom surface portion 6A of the main portion 6 of the terminal fitting 3 slides substantially on or passes the sliding-contact surface 5E of the locking portion 5, the locking portion 5 is resiliency deformed at least partly into the deformation space S. When the terminal fitting 3 is further pushed, the main portion 6 moves forward in the terminal accommodating hole 2A while the front edge 14D slides substantially on or passes the slanted surface 5D. Then, the front end surface of the main portion 6 is stopped at or near its front end position by the contact with the front wall 4, and the locking portion 5 is resiliency at least partly restored to at least partly enter the main portion 6 through the locking hole 12, whereby the front end surface 5C is engaged with<br><br>
the front edge 12A of the locking hole 12 to prevent the terminal fitting 3 from coming out in the withdrawal direction or backward.<br>
There are cases where the front end surface 5C of the locking projection 5B receives a shear force from the front edge 12A of the locking hole 12, for example, when the wire W is strongly pulled in the withdrawal direction or backward with the terminal fitting 3 accommodated in the cavity 2. In such a case, the aforementioned reference surface B serves as a surface against shearing since the locking projection 5B is entirely located in the locking hole 12. Since the reference surface B is extended by lifting up or displacing inwardly the extending end portion 14C as compared to the prior art, the force for holding the terminal fitting 3 so as not to come out backward can be strengthened. In this respect, the extending end of the tongue piece 14 is supported at a position distanced inwardly (upward) from the lateral (bottom) surface portion 6A of the main portion 6 by the supporting surfaces 15 and the rear end of the locking projection 5B is located behind the extending end portion 14C of the tongue piece 14 in this embodiment. Thus, the holding force to prevent the terminal fitting 3 from coming out backward can be enhanced while the terminal fitting 3 is miniaturized. Since the interference of the tongue piece 14 and the locking projection 5B can be securely avoided by providing the one or more supporting surfaces 15, the inclination of the slanted surface 5D can be so set as to minimize the spacing between the slanted surface 5D of the locking projection 5B and the lower surfaces of the supporting surfaces 15. Further, since the tongue piece 14 can be supported preferably at two points, at the front edge 14D and at the extending end portion 14C, connection reliability can be improved by strengthening the contact pressure with the male tab as<br><br>
compared to a case where the tongue piece 14 is supported only at the front edge 14D.<br>
Next, the connector housing 1 is connected with the mating connector housing to connect the male tab and the terminal fitting 3. The male tab is at least partly inserted into the main portion 6 through the male-tab insertion hole 4A from the mating side or front. When the leading end of the male tab is about to touch the contact point 14A of the tongue piece 14, the male tab is inserted into the main portion 6 while resiliency deforming the tongue piece 14 in a deformation direction (substantially outward or downward) and being resiliency sandwiched between the contact point 14A and the contact projection 6D to be kept in a contact state.<br>
As described above, the front end surface 5C of the locking projection 5B can be located before the extending end portion 14C of the tongue piece 14 and the rear end of the slant surface 5D of the locking projection 5B can be located behind the extending end portion 14C of the tongue piece 14 by locating the extending end portion 14C of the tongue piece 14 more inwardly than the locking projection 5B. Thus, the dimension in forward and backward directions of a portion of the locking projection 5B receiving the shear force from the front edge 12A of the locking hole 12 can be extended, with the result that the sectional area against the shear force can be enlarged. Therefore, the holding force to prevent the terminal fitting 3 from coming out in withdrawal direction (substantially backward) can be enhanced while the terminal fitting 3 is miniaturized. Here, the interference of the locking projection 5B and the tongue piece 14 can be securely avoided since the extending end portion 14C of the tongue piece 14 is substantially in contact with the supporting surfaces 15<br><br>
raised from the bottom surface portion 6A at least during the connection with the male tab, and the connection reliability can be improved by strengthening the contact pressure with the male tab as compared to a case where the tongue piece 14 is supported at one point since the tongue piece 14 is supported at two or more points, i.e. at the front edge 14D and at the extending end portion 14C. Further, the supporting surface 15 can be easily and inexpensively provided since being formed by cutting and bending at least one of the opposite side surface portions 6B standing from the preferably substantially opposite lateral edges of the bottom surface portion 6A. Since a pair of supporting surfaces 15 are provided while being spaced apart in width direction WD, the tongue piece 14 can be supported in a stable posture without being twisted.<br>
In addition, the first preventing portion 16A is formed to at least partly share the structural portion of the stabilizer 17, which contributes to the miniaturization of the terminal fitting 3 and ensures a location for an other functional part to increase a degree of freedom in design. Further, since the edges of the slits preferably serve as the preventing portion 16, these edges can be flat, which enables the excessive deformation of the tongue piece 14 to be more stably prevented. Furthermore, since the stabilizer 17 can bulge outward to a larger extent, the erroneous insertion preventing function can be improved.<br>
Accordingly, to extend functional parts while improving a degree of freedom in design, a stabilizer 17 is formed by embossing a part of the inner wall of a side surface portion 6B of a main portion 6 of a terminal fitting 3 to project substantially outward (or in a direction at an angle different from 0° or<br><br>
180°, preferably substantially normal to the forward and backward directions FBD), whereas a guiding recess 18 extending substantially in forward and backward directions FBD is formed in an inner wall of a cavity 2 to substantially face the stabilizer 17. Further, inside the main portion 6, a resiliency deformable tongue piece 14 is arranged by being folded back at the front edge of a bottom surface portion 6A and one or more preventing pieces 14B bulge out sideways from or at the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise edge(s) of the tongue piece 14. One of the preventing pieces 14B is engageable with an opening edge (first preventing portion 16A) made in the inner wall of the side surface portion 6B formed (preferably embossed) upon forming the stabilizer 17. Accordingly, it is not necessary to separately provide the stabilizer 17 and the first preventing portion 16A, which contributes to the miniaturization of the terminal fitting and increases locations where other functional parts can be formed, thereby increasing a degree of freedom in design. <second embodiment></second>
A second preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIG. 13. A connector of this embodiment is obtained by partly changing the construction of the stabilizer 17 of the terminal fitting 3 of the first embodiment, and the other repeating (similar or same) constructions are not described. In other words, unlike the first embodiment in which the upper and lower slits are formed and the portion therebetween is embossed to project outward, a stabilizer 20 of this embodiment is formed by being embossed to project outward without forming any slit. A first preventing portion 16A can prevent the tongue piece 14 from being excessively deformed by being engaged with the preventing piece 14B when the tongue piece 14 is resiliency<br><br>
deformed in vertical direction VD within its resiliency limit. In this way, no openings by forming the slits are made in the side surface portion 6B of the terminal fitting 3, and the stabilizer 20 can be formed while leaving the side surface portion 6b to have a closed construction, wherefore the entrance of external matters can be avoided. <other embodiments></other>
The present invention is not limited to the above described and illustrated embodiments. For example, the following embodiments are also embraced by the technical scope of the present invention as defined by the claims. Beside the following embodiments, various changes can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined by the claims.<br>
(1)	Although the extending end portion 14C is substantially constantly<br>
in contact with the supporting surfaces 15 in the foregoing embodiments, it may<br>
not be in contact therewith in a natural state where no force acts and may be<br>
supported thereon as the male tab is inserted.<br>
(2)	Although the tongue piece 14 is extended backward to such an<br>
extent that the extending end portion 14C is supported on the supporting<br>
surfaces 15, it may be further extended backward.<br>
(3)	Although the extending end portion 14C is supported on the one<br>
or more supporting surfaces 15 after the connection with the male tab in the<br>
foregoing embodiments, at least part of the supporting surfaces 15 may be<br>
omitted.<br>
(4)	Although the main portion 6 is in the form of a rectangular tube in<br>
the foregoing embodiments, it may have another shape, e.g. a hollow cylindrical<br><br>
shape or elliptical tubular shape or any polygonal shape in cross section provided that it has a substantially tubular shape.<br>
(5)	According to the present invention, the second preventing portion<br>
16B  may  be  differently formed  provided  that  it  is  engageable with  the<br>
preventing piece 14B. For example, a part of the side surface portion 6B may<br>
be embossed to project inward from the inner wall of the side surface portion<br>
6B, thereby forming the second preventing portion 16B to be engageable with<br>
the preventing piece 14B. This can realize the locking construction without<br>
boring.<br>
(6)	Although the preferably pair of preventing portions 16 and the pair<br>
of preventing pieces 14B are provided while being spaced apart in width<br>
direction WD in the foregoing embodiments, it is not always necessary to<br>
provide the one or more preventing portions 16 and/or the one or more<br>
preventing pieces 14B in pairs provided that they can display the function of<br>
preventing the excessive deformation of the tongue piece 14 according to the<br>
present invention.<br><br>

The present invention relates to a terminal fitting and to a connector provided therewith.<br>
A general construction of a terminal fitting provided with a terminal erroneous-insertion preventing function is known e.g. from Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H10-144379. This terminal fitting is provided with a stabilizer formed by embossing an inner wall of a main portion of a terminal fitting to project out for the prevention of an erroneous insertion and a recess formed in an inner wall of a cavity corresponding to this stabilizer, so that the insertion is hindered to prevent an erroneous insertion of the terminal fitting if an attempt is made to insert the terminal fitting upside down into the cavity. On the other hand, a general construction of a terminal fitting provided with a function of preventing a tongue piece from being excessively deflected to be deformed is known from Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2005-183160. This terminal fitting is provided with preventing pieces bulging out at the opposite widthwise edges of a tongue piece and openings formed in side surfaces of a main portion facing these preventing pieces, so that the preventing pieces can be engaged with the edges of the openings. If these terminal fittings are simply combined, a terminal fitting 103 in which excessive deformation preventing portions (preventing pieces 114B and preventing portions 116A) are provided substantially in a front half and a<br></td>
