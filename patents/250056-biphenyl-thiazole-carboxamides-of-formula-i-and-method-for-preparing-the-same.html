				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to novel biphenyl thiazole carboxamides, several methods for their manufacture and their use for combating undesired microorganisms.<br>
It is already known that numerous carboxamides possess fungicidal properties (see e.g. WO 03/070705, WO 97/08148 and JP-A 2001-302605). Therefore, a multitude of biphenyl carboxamides have already been identified that can be substituted in the biphenyl portion, such as e.g. N-(3',4'-dichloro-3-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl-2-yl)-l-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide from WO 03/070705, N-(5-fluoro-4'-methylbiphenyl-2-yl)-2-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxamide from WO 97/08148 and N-(4'-methoxy-6-methylbiphenyl-2-yl)-2-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-l,3-thiazole-5-carb-oxamide from JP 2001-302605. The efficacy of these substances is good, however in most cases, e.g. with low application rates, it leaves something to be desired.<br>

The invention-related substances exhibit a strong fortifying effect in plants. Therefore, they are<br>
suitable for mobilising the plants' own defences against contamination by undesired microorganisms.<br>
In the present context, plant-fortifying (resistance-inducing) substances are to be understood as those<br>
substances that are capable of stimulating the defence system in plants in such a way that the treated<br>
plants develop considerable resistance to these microorganisms following subsequent inoculation.<br>
In the present context, undesired microorganisms are to be understood to be phytopathogenic fungi,<br>
bacteria, and viruses. The invention-related substances can also be used to protect plants against<br>
contamination by the named pathogens for a certain time period following treatment. The time<br>
period, for which this protection is provided, generally ranges from 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7<br>
days following treatment of the plants with the active compounds.<br>
The good plant tolerance of the active compounds according to the invention at the concentrations<br>
required for controlling plant diseases allows treatment of above-ground parts of plants, of<br>
propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be employed particularly successfully for<br>
controlling cereal diseases, such as, for example, against Puccinia species, diseases in viticulture and<br>
fruit and vegetable production such as, for example, against Botrytis, Venturia or Alternaria species.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the harvest yield.<br>
Moreover, they exhibit low toxicity and are well tolerated by plants.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can also be used in certain concentrations and at<br>
certain application rates as herbicides, for influencing plant growth rates, and for combating animal<br>
pests, if applicable. They can also be used as intermediate products and preliminary products for the<br>
synthesis of additional active compounds, if applicable.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated with the substances according to the invention. Plants in this<br>
context are taken to mean all plants and plant populations, such as desired and undesired wild plants<br>
or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be<br>
obtained by conventional breeding and optimisation methods, or by biotechnological and genetic<br>
engineering methods, or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and<br>
including the plant varieties which are capable, or incapable, of being protected by Plant Breeders'<br>
Rights. Plant parts are to be taken to mean all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of the<br>
plants, such as the shoot, leaf, flower and root; examples mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks,<br>
stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits and seeds, and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also<br>
include harvested material and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings,<br>
tubers, rhizomes, offshoots and seeds.<br>
The invention-related treatment of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds occurs<br>
directly or by affecting the environment, habitat or storage area according to customary treatment<br>
methods, e.g. by dipping, spraying, vaporising, atomising, scattering, brushing on, and in the case of<br>
propagation material, particularly in the case of seeds, by further encasing it with one or more layers.<br>
In the area of material protection, the compounds according to the invention can be employed for<br>
protecting industrial materials against infection with, and destruction by, undesirable<br>
microorganisms.<br>
Industrial materials in the present context are understood to mean non-living materials, which have<br>
been prepared for use in industry. For example, industrial materials which are intended to be<br>
protected by active compounds according to the invention from microbial change or destruction can<br>
be glues, pastes, paper and cardboard, textiles, leather, wood, paints and synthetic articles, cooling<br>
lubricants and other materials which can be infected with, or destroyed by, microorganisms. Parts of<br>
production plants, for example cooling-water circuits, which may be impaired by the multiplication of<br>
microorganisms may also be mentioned within the scope of the materials to be protected. Industrial<br>
materials, which may be mentioned within the scope of the present invention, are preferably glues,<br>
pastes, paper and cardboard, leather, wood, paints, cooling lubricants and heat-transfer liquids,<br>
particularly preferably wood.<br>
The following are mentioned as examples of microorganisms that can cause a decomposition or<br>
change in industrial materials: bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae and slime organisms. The active<br>
compounds according to the invention preferably have an effect on fungi, particularly moulds, wooddiscolouring<br>
and wood-destroying fungi (Basidiomycetes) as well as on slime organisms and algae.<br>
Microorganisms of the following genera may be mentioned by way of example:<br>
Alternaria, such as Alternaria tenuis,<br>
Aspergillus, such as Aspergillus niger,<br>
Chaetomium, such as Chaetomium globosum,<br>

Sclerophoma, such as Sclerophoma pityophila,<br>
Trichoderma, such as Trichoderma viride,<br>
Escherichia, such as Escherichia coli,<br>
Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa,<br>
Staphylococcus, such as Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
Depending on their respective physical and/or chemical characteristics, the active compounds can be<br>
converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders,<br>
foams, pastes, granules, aerosols, fine encapsulations in polymer substances and in coatings for seeds,<br>
as well as ULV cold and warm fog formulations.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, e.g. by mixing the active compounds with<br>
extenders, or liquid solvents, liquefied gases under pressure and/or solid carrier substances, while<br>
using surface active agents if applicable, or emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam-producing<br>
agents. If water is used as an extender, organic solvents can also be used as auxiliary solvents, for<br>
example. The following fundamentally come into consideration as liquid solvents: aromates, such <br>
xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalines, chlorated aromates or chlorated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as<br>
chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylenechloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane<br>
or paraffins, e.g. petroleum fractions, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol as well as their ethers and<br>
esters, ketones, such as acetone, methylethylketone, methylisobutylketone or cyclohexanone, strongly<br>
polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethylsulphoxide, as well as water. With liquefied<br>
gaseous extenders or carrier substances, those liquids are meant, which are gaseous at normal<br>
temperatures and normal pressure, e.g. aerosol propellants, such as halogen hydrocarbons as well as<br>
butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Suitable solid carriers are: for example, ground natural<br>
minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous<br>
earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as highly dispersed silicic acid, aluminium oxide and<br>
silicates. Suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks<br>
such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and<br>
organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and<br>
tobacco stalks. Suitable emulsifiers and/or foam-producing agents are: for example, non-ionic and<br>
anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers,<br>
for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else<br>
protein hydrolysates. Suitable dispersants are: for example, lignin sulphite waste liquors and<br>
methylcellulose.<br>
Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose, and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of<br>
powders, granules or latex, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else<br>
natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the<br>
formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and<br>
Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal<br>
phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt,<br>
molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 percent by weight of active compound,<br>
preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention, as such or in their formulations, can also be used in<br>
a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides or insecticides, for example to<br>
widen the spectrum of action or to prevent the development of resistance. In many cases, synergistic<br>
effects are obtained, that is the activity of the mixture is greater than the activity of the individual<br>
components.<br>

and the corresponding 3-endo-isomers (CAS-Reg.-Nr. 185984-60-5) (see WO 96/37494, WO<br>
98/25923), as well as preparations, which contain insecticidal plant extracts, nematodes, fungi or<br>
viruses.<br>
A mixture with other known active compounds such as herbicides, or with fertilisers and growth<br>
regulators, safeners or semiochemicals is also possible.<br>
In addition, the compounds of Formula (I) according to the invention also have very good antimycotic<br>
activity. They have a very broad antimycotic activity spectrum in particular against dermatophytes<br>
and yeasts, moulds and diphasic fungi (for example against Candida species, such as Candida<br>
albicans, Candida glabrata), and Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species, such as Aspergillus<br>
niger and Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton species, such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes,<br>
Microsporon species such as Microsporon canis and audouinii. The list of these fungi by no means<br>
limits the mycotic spectrum covered, but is only for illustration.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the usage forms<br>
prepared from them, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, soluble powders, pastes, soluble<br>
powders, dusts and granules. Application is carried out in a customary manner, for example by<br>
watering, spraying, atomising, scattering, dusting, foaming, spreading, etc. It is furthermore possible<br>
to apply the active compounds by the ultra-low-volume method, or to inject the active compound<br>
preparation or the active compound itself into the soil. It is also possible to treat the seeds of the<br>
plants.<br>
When using the active compounds according to the invention as fungicides, the application rates can<br>
be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind of application. For the treatment of<br>
parts of plants, the active compound application rates are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha,<br>
preferably between 10 and 1,000 g/ha. For seed dressing, the active compound application rates are<br>
generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per<br>
kilogram of seed. For treatment of the soil, the active compound application rates are generally<br>
between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5,000 g/ha.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional<br>
biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further<br>
preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if<br>
appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts<br>
thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars, which are in each case commercially available or<br>
in use, are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are understood to mean plants with novel<br>
characteristics ("traits"), which are grown by conventional cultivation, by mutagenesis or by<br>
recombinant DNA techniques. These may be pure species, cultivars, biotypes or genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate,<br>
vegetation period, nutrition), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive<br>
("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity<br>
spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to<br>
the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased<br>
tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier<br>
harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional<br>
value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products<br>
are possible, which exceed the effects that were actually expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering), which are<br>
preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic<br>
modification, received genetic material, which imparted particularly advantageous useful properties<br>
("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to<br>
high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased<br>
flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality<br>
and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or<br>
processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such<br>
properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against<br>
insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the<br>
plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be<br>
mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, Soya beans, potatoes,<br>
cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and<br>
grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, Soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and oilseed<br>
rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects,<br>
arachnids, nematodes and snails by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the<br>
plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a),<br>
CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also<br>
combinations thereof) (hereinafter referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits, which are also particularly<br>
emphasised, are the increased resistance of plants to fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired<br>
resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and the correspondingly<br>
expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased<br>
tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones,<br>
sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes, which<br>
impart the desired traits in question, can also be present in combination with one another in the<br>
transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton<br>
varieties, Soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD<br>
GARD® (for example maize, cotton, Soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for<br>
example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of<br>
herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and Soya bean<br>
varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for<br>
example maize, cotton, Soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed<br>
rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example<br>
maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance),<br>
which may be mentioned, include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize).<br>
Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivate having these genetic traits or genetic traits<br>
still to be developed, which will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with<br>
the compounds of Formula (I) or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The<br>
preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of<br>
these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures<br>
specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
The preparation and the use of the active compounds according to the invention are illustrated by the<br>
following examples.<br>
Preparation Examples<br>
Example 1 (Compound 2.18)<br>
0.10 ml (1.1 mmol) oxalylchloride and 0.1 ml dimethylformamide are added to a solution consisting<br>
of 211.2mg (1.0 mmol) 2-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid in 9ml<br>
dichloromethane. After stirring for 2 hours at room temperature, this solution is added to a solution<br>
consisting of 240.0 mg (1.0 mmol) 4'-chloro-5,3'-difluoro-biphenyl-2-yl-amine and 0.18ml<br>
(1.3 mmol) triethylamine in 9ml dichloromethane. The reaction mixture is stirred for 16 hours at<br>
room temperature and subsequently mixed with 7 ml 2 N hydrochloric acid. The organic phase is<br>
dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated in vacuum.<br>
The reaction yields 316.5 mg (73 % of the theoretical yield) of N-(4'-chloro-3',5-difluorobiphenyl-2-<br>
yl)-2-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-l,3-thiazole-5-carboxamide [log P (pH 2.3) = 3.67].<br>
Preparation of Initial Substances of Formula (III)<br>
Example (01-1)<br>
,F<br>
30.0 g (0.172 mol) 4-chloro-3-fluoro-phenylboronic acid and 29.7 g (0.156 mol) 2-bromo-4-<br>
fluoroaniline, in an oxygen-free atmosphere, are suspended in a mixture of 170 ml toluene, 17 ml<br>
ethanol and 160 ml of saturated sodium carbonate solution in an argon atmosphere. 3.6g<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (0) is added to the reaction mixture, and it is stirred for 12<br>
hours at 80°C. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with acetic acid<br>
ethyl ester. The combined organic phases are concentrated, and the residue is chromatographed with<br>
cyclohexane / acetic acid ethyl ester (3:1) on silica gel.<br>
The reaction yields 26.1 g (69.7% of the theoretical yield) of 4'-chloro-3',5-difluorobiphenyl-2-amine<br>
[log P(pH 2.3) = 3.18].<br>
