				<td>SOLENOID AND CONNECTOR ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to electrical connectors and<br>
electrical devices and more particularly to an assembly of an electrical device<br>
such as a motor or solenoid and an electrical connector having improved<br>
reliability.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0003] Compact electrical devices such as motors and solenoids are<br>
often housed in cylindrical housings which correspond generally to the active<br>
components of the device: a rotor surrounded by a cylindrical stator in the case<br>
of a motor or a plunger surrounded by a cylindrical coil in the case of a solenoid.<br>
Such cylindrical housings are efficient packages for such devices as they<br>
generally require a minimum of material and result in a package having minimum<br>
dimensions.<br>
[0004] Since one end of a typical motor or solenoid will include an<br>
output feature, either a shaft or a plunger, it is frequently convenient to arrange<br>
the electrical input or terminals on the opposite end. Input connections or<br>
terminals so located also maintain the cylindrical symmetry of the housing.<br><br>
[0005] A problem may develop with such an arrangement, however,<br>
especially in smaller devices in which the spacing between the motor shaft,<br>
solenoid plunger or other electrically components associated with them and the<br>
electrical terminals is limited. In such situations, conductive foreign matter may<br>
bridge the gap between an electrical terminal and the shaft or plunger and<br>
intermittently or permanently short circuit the device.<br>
[0006] This problem can be especially acute in motors and solenoids<br>
for automotive applications because of the constant demand for weight saving<br>
which generally encourages lighter and therefore smaller devices and the fact<br>
that they are often exposed to deleterious atmospheric conditions such as dirt,<br>
metallic debris and other contaminants and particulates. Furthermore, a failure<br>
of the motor or solenoid due to a short circuit to ground may cause consequential<br>
failure of related components or controllers. The present invention addresses<br>
this difficulty with motors, solenoids and other similar electrical devices.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] The present invention provides a solenoid and electrical<br>
connector assembly which includes a solenoid body having a pair of electrical<br>
terminals disposed on opposite sides of a plunger component and a connector<br>
having two corresponding electrical terminals and a non-conductive blade or<br>
tongue disposed therebetween. When assembled, the tongue of the connector<br>
seats between the terminals on the solenoid body and inhibits ingress of foreign<br><br>
matter in the region between the terminals of the solenoid. The service life and<br>
reliability of the solenoid are thus greatly improved.<br>
[0008] The invention is also suitable for and may be utilized with a<br>
motor having a bearing at one end and a pair of electrical terminals disposed on<br>
opposite sides of the bearing. The electrical connector includes a pair of<br>
electrical terminals correspondingly arranged and a blade or tongue which seats<br>
between the terminals of the motor and protects the bearing from foreign matter<br>
thereby reducing the likelihood of a short circuit.<br>
[0009] Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
solenoid and connector assembly having a tongue disposed between a pair of<br>
terminals.<br>
[0010] It is a further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
solenoid having a pair of terminals on opposite sides of a plunger component and<br>
a connector having a corresponding pair of terminals and a tongue between the<br>
terminals which protects the plunger component when the solenoid and<br>
connector are assembled.<br>
[0011] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
solenoid having a pair of terminals on opposite sides of a plunger and a<br>
connector having a corresponding pair of terminals and a tongue between the<br>
terminals which covers the plunger when the solenoid and connector are<br>
assembled to inhibit ingress of foreign matter.<br>
[0012] It: is a still further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
motor having a pair of terminals on opposite sides of a bearing and a connector<br><br>
having a corresponding pair of terminals and a tongue between the terminals<br>
which protects the bearing when the motor and connector are assembled,<br>
[0013] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
motor having a pair of terminals on opposite sides of a bearing and a connector<br>
having a corresponding pair of terminals and a tongue between the terminals<br>
which covers the bearing when the motor and connector are assembled to inhibit<br>
ingress of foreign matter.<br>
[0014] Further objects, advantages and areas of applicability will<br>
become apparent from the description provided herein. It should be understood<br>
that the description and specific examples are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0023] With reference now to Figures 1 and 2, a first embodiment of a<br>
solenoid and electrical connector assembly is illustrated and generally<br>
designated by the reference number 10. The first embodiment solenoid and<br>
electrical connector assembly 10 includes a solenoid 12 having a generally<br>
cylindrical body or housing 14 which is preferably fabricated of metal, for<br>
example, steel, aluminum or an alloy of these or other metals. The cylindrical<br>
housing 14 locates, supports and protects an electrical coil 16. The electrical coil<br>
16 generally surrounds a bi-directionally translatable armature or plunger 18.<br>
The plunger 18 cooperates with a first axial guide or bearing 22 and a second<br><br>
axial guide, pole piece or stop 24 which together define the axis of motion or<br>
translation of the plunger 18. A portion of the plunger 18 extends through the<br>
first axial guide or bearing 22 and activates or controls an associated device (not<br>
illustrated). If desired, a compression spring 26 and an adjusting screw 28 may<br>
be disposed between the plunger 18 and the second axial guide, pole piece or<br>
stop 24 for adjusting the travel of the plunger 18<br>
[0024] At the end of the cylindrical housing 14 adjacent the second<br>
axial guide, pole piece or stop 24 is disposed a terminal assembly 30. The<br>
terminal assembly 30 is fabricated of a plastic, insulating material, for example,<br>
ABS or nylon, and is shaped to generally conform to the housing 14 of the<br>
solenoid 12 and includes a flat, chordal surface 32 flanked by two smaller<br>
perpendicular surfaces 34a and 34b. The terminal assembly 30 defines a pair of<br>
rectangular slots 36a and 36b parallel to and adjacent the surfaces 34a and 34b.<br>
The terminal assembly 30 is secured to the housing 14 by a positioning or<br>
register pin 38 which is received within a suitably sized and appropriately located<br>
opening 42 and a resilient or flexible latch 44 which is releasably received within<br>
a second opening 46 having a flat or chordal edge which is engageable by the<br>
flexible latch 44.<br>
[0025] The terminal assembly 30 includes a centrally disposed<br>
aperture 48 which receives a portion of the second guide, pole piece or stop 24.<br>
The terminal assembly 30 also includes a pair of spaced apart electrical<br>
terminals 50a and 50b disposed adjacent and on opposite sides of the center<br><br>
aperture 48. Each of the terminals 50a and 50b is connected by one of a pair of<br>
electrical leads or wires 52 to the electrical coil 16,<br>
[0026] Referring now to Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4, an electrical connector<br>
60, also fabricated of an insulating material, for example, ABS or nylon, includes<br>
a complexly configured connector body 62 which receives, supports and<br>
positions a pair of electrical terminals 64a and 64b and a cover 66 which is<br>
removably retained on the body 62 by a latch assembly 68, The connector body<br>
62 includes a pair of parallel, spaced-apart outer ears or flanges 72a and 72b<br>
which are each reinforced by pairs of gussets 74 and a center flange or tongue<br>
76 perpendicular to and offset from the outer flanges 72a and 72b which is also<br>
strengthened by a pair of gussets 78. As indicated by the arrows in Figure 1,<br>
when the electrical connector 60 is assembled to the terminal assembly 30, each<br>
of the pair of ears or flanges 72a and 72b is received within a respective one of<br>
the pair of rectangular slots 36a and 36b. Also, as illustrated in Figure 2, when<br>
the electrical connector 60 is assembled to the terminal assembly 30, the center<br>
flange or tongue 76 is in intimate contact with the surface of the terminal<br>
assembly 30 around the aperture 48 and closes and seals it off.<br>
[0027] The pair of electrical terminals 64a and 64b in the electrical<br>
connector 60 are flat, resilient, blade-like components which may be crimped to<br>
respective electrical leads 84 and which may be molded in-situ in the electrical<br>
connector 60 or secured there by other conventional, for example, mechanical,<br>
means. Generally aligned with the center flange 76 is a resilient latch member<br>
86 which releasably engages a cross member 88 of the terminal assembly 30, as<br><br>
illustrated in Figure 2, to retain the electrical connector 60 on the terminal<br>
assembly 30. A U-shaped bridge 94, aligned with the center flange 76 and the<br>
resilient latch member 86 reinforces the electrical connector 60, protects and acts<br>
as a locating reference for the latch member 86 and facilitates installation of the<br>
electrical connector 60 on the terminal assembly 30.<br>
[0028] Referring now to Figures 5 and 6, a second embodiment of the<br>
invention having an electric motor and an electrical connector assembly<br>
according to the present invention is illustrated and generally designated by the<br>
reference number 100. The second embodiment motor and electrical connector<br>
assembly 100 is similar to the first embodiment assembly 10 except that the<br>
solenoid 12 is replaced by an electric motor 102 and an electrical connector 150<br>
includes electrical leads 172 which extend from the connector 150 in an opposite<br>
direction. It should be appreciated that these various components may be<br>
interchanged and that the solenoid 12 of the first embodiment assembly 10 may<br>
be utilized with the electrical connector 150 of the second embodiment assembly<br>
100 and that the electric motor 102 of the second embodiment assembly 100<br>
may be utilized with the electrical connector 60 of the first embodiment assembly<br>
10.<br>
[0029] The second embodiment motor and electrical connector<br>
assembly 100 includes the electric motor 102 which may be either uni- or bi-<br>
directional and which has a generally cylindrical housing 104 which is preferably<br>
fabricated of metal, for example, steel, aluminum or an alloy of these or other<br>
metals. The cylindrical housing 104 locates, supports and protects a stator and<br><br><br>
electrical coil 106. The stator and electrical coil 106 generally surrounds a<br>
rotatable armature 108 having a shaft 110 which defines an axis of rotation. The<br>
armature 108 cooperates with and is supported by a first guide or bearing 112<br>
and a second guide or bearing 114 which together define the axis of motion or<br>
rotation of the armature 108.<br>
[0030] At the end of the cylindrical housing 104 opposite the first guide<br>
or bearing 112 is disposed a terminal assembly 120. The terminal assembly 120<br>
is fabricated of a plastic, insulating material, for example, ABS or nylon, and is<br>
shaped to generally conform to the housing 104 of the electric motor 102 and<br>
includes a flat, chordal surface 122 flanked by two smaller perpendicular<br>
surfaces 124a and 124b. The terminal assembly 120 defines a pair of<br>
rectangular slots 126a and 126b parallel to and adjacent the surfaces 124a and<br>
124b, respectively. The terminal assembly 120 is secured to the cylindrical<br>
housing 104 by a positioning or register pin 128 which is received within a<br>
suitably sized and appropriately located opening 132 and a resilient latch 134<br>
which is releasably received within a second opening 136 having a flat or chordal<br>
edge which is engageable by the latch 134.<br>
[0031] The terminal assembly 120 includes a centrally disposed<br>
aperture 140 which receives a portion of the second guide or bearing 114. The<br>
terminal assembly 120 also includes a pair of spaced apart electrical terminals<br>
142a and 142b disposed adjacent and on opposite sides of the center aperture<br>
140. Each of the terminals 142a and 142b is connected to a respective one of<br>
the electrical leads or wires 144 of the electric coil 106 of the electric motor 102.<br><br>
[0032] An electrical connector 150, also fabricated of an insulating<br>
material, for example, ABS or nylon, includes a complexly configured body 152<br>
which receives, supports and positions a pair of electrical terminals 154a and<br>
154b and a cover 156 which is removably retained on the body 152 by a latch<br>
assembly 68 (illustrated in Figure 3). The connector body 152 includes a pair of<br>
parallel, spaced-apart outer ears or flanges 162a and 162b which are reinforced<br>
by pairs of gussets 74 (illustrated in Figure 4) and a center flange or tongue 166<br>
perpendicular to and offset from the outer ears or flanges 162a and 162b. The<br>
center flange or tongue 166 is strengthened by a pair of gussets 78 (illustrated in<br>
Figure 4). As indicated by the arrows in Figure 5, when the electrical connector<br>
150 is assembled to the terminal assembly 120, each of the pair of ears or<br>
flanges 162a and 162b is received within a respective one of the pair of<br>
rectangular slots 126a and 126b. Also, as illustrated in Figure 6, when the<br>
electrical connector 150 is assembled to the terminal assembly 120, the center<br>
flange or tongue 166 is in intimate contact with the terminal assembly 120 around<br>
the aperture 140 and closes and seals it off.<br>
[0033] The pair of electrical terminals 154a and 154b in the electrical<br>
connector 150 are flat, resilient, blade-like components which may be crimped to<br>
respective electrical leads 172 and which may be molded in-situ in the electrical<br>
connector 150 or secured there by other conventional, for example, mechanical,<br>
means. Generally aligned with the center flange 166 is a resilient latch member<br>
176 which engages, as illustrated in Figure 6, a cross member 178 of the<br><br><br>
terminal assembly 120 to retain the electrical connector 150 on the terminal<br>
assembly 120.<br>
[0034] It will be appreciated that in the first embodiment solenoid and<br>
electrical connector assembly 10, the center flange or tongue 76 effectively<br>
covers and protects the center aperture 48 inhibiting the ingress of foreign<br>
material which could cause a short circuit between one of the electrical terminals<br>
50a and 50b and the chassis ground through the second guide, pole piece or<br>
stop 24 when the electrical connector 60 is assembled to the terminal assembly<br>
30. Likewise, in the second embodiment motor and electrical connector<br>
assembly 100, the center flange or tongue 166 effectively covers and protects<br>
the center aperture 140 inhibiting the ingress of foreign material which could<br>
cause a short circuit between one of the electrical terminals 142a and 142b and<br>
the chassis ground through the second guide or bearing 114 when the electrical<br>
connector 150 is assembled to the terminal assembly 120.<br>
[0035] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
