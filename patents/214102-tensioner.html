				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TENSIONER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a tensioner that imparts a<br>
predetermined tensile force to a force transmitting member such<br>
as a chain or a timing belt that drives a camshaft of an engine<br>
mounted in a vehicle such as a four wheel automobile or a two wheel<br>
vehicle.<br>
Background Art<br>
A tensioner is used in order to maintain a substantially fixed<br>
tensile force on a chain or a timing belt, even if slackness develops<br>
in the chain or the timing belt due to stretching or wear during<br>
use. As shown in Fig. 6 , a conventional general tensioner is provided<br>
with a case 101, a rotary, member 102 having a male screw portion<br>
102a, a pressing member 103 having a female screw portion 103a that<br>
is brought into threaded engagement with the male screw portion<br>
102a of the rotary member 102, a spring 104 that urges the rotary<br>
member 102 in a first rotary direction, a bearing 109 in order to<br>
restrain rotation of the pressing member 103, and the like. When<br>
the rotary member 102 is rotated in the first direction by the spring<br>
104, the pressing member 103 moves in an axis line direction. The<br>
rotary member 102 is stored in the case 101, and an end surface<br>
102b of the rotary member 102 is rotatably supported by a receiving<br>
surface 101b of the case 101.<br>
The tensioner urges the rotary member 102 in the first rotary<br>
direction by means of a repulsive force that accumulates when the<br>
spring 104 twists in a direction that is opposite to the first rotary<br>
direction. A rotary torque of the rotary member 102 moves the<br>
pressing member 103 in an axis line direction projecting from the<br>
case 101. A distal end of the pressing member 103 directly or<br>
indirectly pushes the force transmitting member such as the chain<br>
or the timing belt. Further, when the tensile force of the chain<br>
or the timing belt increases, a force pushing back the pressing<br>
member 103 increases . In this case, the pressing member 103 is pushed<br>
back in the axis line direction toward an inner portion of the case<br>
101, resisting a sum total of torques mainly including an urging<br>
force of the spring 104, a frictional resistance between the male<br>
screw portion 102a and the female screw portion 103a, and a frictional<br>
resistance between the end surface 102b of the rotary member 102<br>
and the receiving surface 101b of the case 101. The tensioner can<br>
impart a fixed tensile force to the chain or the timing belt based<br>
on those torques and the like.<br>
Large changes in a braking force of the tensioner occur with<br>
this type of conventional tensioner due to wear over time with use<br>
and changes in a lubrication state. A device in which abrasion<br>
resistant surface processing, such as Kanigen plating, is performed<br>
on a rotary member 2 and on a male screw portion 9 and a female<br>
screw portion 13 of a pressing member 3, respectively, in order<br>
to resolve these types of problems is proposed in Japanese Utility<br>
Model Registration No. 2120655.<br>
However, with the conventional Kanigen plating abrasion<br>
resistant surface process, in a state where a fluctuating load acting<br>
on the tensioner is relatively large and there are violent vibrations<br>
present, durability problems remain such as a process layer wearing<br>
due to the passage of time to cause changes in the braking force.<br>
JP 11-63125 A discloses a structure of the "tensioner comprising a case;<br>
a rotary member rotatably received in the case in a state where a motion of the<br>
rotary member in an axial direction is restrained, a pressing member that is<br>
brought into threaded engagement with the rotary member and movable in the<br>
axial direction, whose rotation with respect to the case is restrained and on which<br>
a load from a force transmitting member acts in the axial direction, and a spring<br>
which is received in an inner portion of the case and transmits a rotational force<br>
to the rotary member, the rotary member having its axial portion rotatably<br>
supported by a support portion of the case to support a load that acts on the<br>
pressing member, the pressing member being restrained from rotating by a<br>
bearing". However, JP 11-63125 A does not disclose a structure of the type in<br>
which "among the rotary member, the shaft portion of the rotary member, the<br>
support portion of the case, the pressing member, and the bearing, a covering<br>
film of a three element alloy of nickel, phosphorous, and tungsten, or a covering<br>
film of a three element alloy of nickel, phosphorous, and boron is formed at least<br>
on a surface of the shaft portion of the rotary member".<br>
JP 2001-32896 A discloses that a covering film of a solid lubricant is<br>
formed on a sliding portion of a tensioner. Disclosed, as a solid lubricant, is one<br>
of a molybdenum-based lubricant, a fluororesin-based lubricant, a graphite-<br>
based lubricant, and a phosphate-based solid lubricant or a mixture of those.<br>
However, the covering film of the solid lubricant has a minimum returning torque<br>
value in an early stage of an apparatus operation. After that, the returning torque<br>
value increases, and the covering film is then changed to a stable state. The<br>
covering film is completely different from the covering film of the present<br>
invention for preventing the wear being caused with the passage of the operating<br>
time, the changes in the braking force (frictional- force) due to the changes in the<br>
lubrication state, and the changes in the characteristics. According to JP 2001-<br>
32896 A "in the early stage of an operation, the solid lubricants come into<br>
contact with each other, and the returning torque value exhibits the minimum<br>
value. Next, attrition of the solid lubricant proceeds. After that, when driving is<br>
continued, a base metal of each of components appears, and the state moves to<br>
a state where steel (metal) materials come into contact with each other on a<br>
sliding surface. After that, a stable returning torque value is indicated". This<br>
document does not describe the object, the structure, and the effect of the<br>
present invention.<br>
JP 2001-64005 A discloses a coated sliding member in which, on a high-<br>
hardness hard carbon film having a Knoop hardness equal to or more than 2000<br>
and equal to or less than 8000, an upper layer coating film including a carbon<br>
film, a metal film, or a compound film having a Knoop hardness less than 2000 is<br>
stacked. There is described that as a material for used for the upper layer, one<br>
or more kinds of carbon, aluminum, silicon, titanium, chrome, iron, nickel, zinc,<br>
molybdenum, silver, tungsten, gold, sulfide such as molybdenum disulfide,<br>
boride such as titanium boride, phosphate such as manganese phosphate is<br>
used. However, JP 2001-64005 A describes the hard carbon film of the covered<br>
sliding member, and is different from the present invention. It is an object of JP<br>
2001-64005 A to realize sliding characteristics with a small coefficient of friction<br>
and a small aggressiveness to a mating member in a case where a surface<br>
covered with the hard carbon film is rough, whereas it is the object of the present<br>
invention to provide a tensioner in which wear of a portion that exerts a largest<br>
influence on a braking force and characteristics with a passage of an operating<br>
time and the changes in the lubrication state thereof may be prevented so that<br>
the changes in the braking force and the changes in the characteristics are<br>
small, and a stable performance for a long period of time may be obtained.<br>
JP 2000-126489 A discloses a sewing machine part having a surface<br>
formed with a composite plating film obtained by substantially uniformly<br>
codepositing nickel or a nickel-based alloy with fluorine-containing composition<br>
fine particles, the sewing machine component being imparted with low wear<br>
performance and low friction performance to be in contact with thread or cloth.<br>
JP 2000-126489 A describes that the component having the surface formed with<br>
the composite plating film obtained by substantially uniformly codepositing a<br>
three element alloy of nickel, phosphorus, and tungsten or a three element alloy<br>
of nickel, boron, and tungsten, has high hardness characteristics owing to<br>
tungsten and maintains a high surface hardness even when a codeposition<br>
amount of the fluorine-containing composition fine particles is increased. Since<br>
this document is about an invention of the sewing machine component to be in<br>
contact with thread or cloth, and describes the low wear performance and the<br>
low friction performance of the sewing machine component with respect to<br>
thread or cloth, its object is completely different from that of the present<br>
invention.<br>
JP 2001-146919 A discloses that a thin covering layer is provided to an<br>
inner surface of a dynamic pressure bearing sleeve. There is described that a<br>
thin film layer is a plating of an alloy matrix of nickel, phosphorus, and boron and<br>
codeposited graphite. However, JP 2001-146919 A relates to a dynamic<br>
pressure bearing sleeve including brass or phosphor bronze as a material<br>
thereof. There is no description of the object, the structure, and the effect related<br>
to the tensioner of the present invention.<br>
The present invention has been proposed in order to solve the<br>
above problems. An object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a tensioner that displays stable performance over a long period<br>
of time with little changes in the braking force and in the<br>
characteristics of the tensioner, by preventing occurrence of wear<br>
that accompanies usage over time, and changes in the lubrication<br>
state, in portions that impart the greatest influence to the braking<br>
force and characteristics of the tensioner.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a<br>
tensioner characterized by including: a case; a rotary member<br>
rotatably stored in the case in a state where a motion of the rotary<br>
member in an axial direction is restrained; a pressing member that<br>
is brought into threaded engagement with the rotary member and movable<br>
in the axial direction, whose rotation with respect to the case<br>
is restrained, and on which a load from a force transmitting member<br>
acts in the axial direction; and a spring that is stored in an inner<br>
portion of the case and transmits a rotational force to the rotary<br>
member, the rotary member having its axial portion rotatably<br>
supported by a support portion of the case to support a load that<br>
acts on the pressing member, the pressing member being restrained<br>
from rotating by a bearing, the tensioner being characterized in<br>
that: among the rotary member, the shaft portion of the rotary member,<br>
the support portion of the case, the pressing member, and the bearing,<br>
a covering film of a three element alloy of nickel, phosphorous,<br>
and tungsten, or a covering film of a three element alloy of nickel,<br>
phosphorous, and boron is formed at least on a surface of the shaft<br>
portion of the rotary member.<br>
A rotary member for propelling a pressing member is a very<br>
important motion element. The shaft portion of the rotary member<br>
is supported in the support portion of the case. An excessive load<br>
acts on the shaft portion of the rotary member due to the rotating<br>
member rotating in the support portion of the case, or due to a<br>
return force acting on the rotating member through the pressing<br>
member. Consequently, abrasion and a frictional force develop. In<br>
the present invention, a covering film of a three element alloy<br>
of nickel, phosphorous, and tungsten is formed on at least the shaft<br>
portion of the rotary member. Therefore, there is little development<br>
of changes in wear and frictional resistance, and the performance<br>
becomes stable.<br>
According to the tensioner of the present invention, stable<br>
characteristics, in which there is little change in the braking<br>
force (frictional force) and in the characteristics of the tensioner<br>
due to wear that accompanies usage over time and due to changes<br>
in the lubrication state, can be maintained over a long period of<br>
time.<br>

Best Mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
In order to describe the present invention in more detail.<br>
a detailed description of the present invention is made according<br>
to the appended drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of a tensioner showing an<br>
embodiment mode of the present invention, and Fig. 2 is a cross<br>
sectional view of a portion of an engine showing a usage example<br>
of the tensioner.<br>
The tensioner is employed in a power transmission mechanism<br>
201 of an automobile engine 200 shown in Fig. 2, for example. The<br>
power transmission mechanism 201 transmits rotary motion of the<br>
engine 200 to a cam shaft 203 through an endless force transmitting<br>
member 202 such as a timing belt or a chain. The tensioner is therefore<br>
mounted in a predetermined location of the engine 200, and pushes<br>
the force transmitting member 202 in a direction shown by an arrow<br>
V by means of an impulsive force that is described later, thus<br>
maintaining a constant tensile force.<br>
A tensioner shown in Fig. 1 is provided with a case 1 in which<br>
a cavity portion la is formed in an axial direction, a rotary member<br>
2 and a pressing member 3 that are inserted into the cavity portion<br>
la of the case 1 in a state where they are in threaded engagement<br>
with each other, a torsion spring 4 that imparts a rotational force<br>
to the rotary member 2, a bearing 5 which is attached to a distal<br>
end portion of the case 1 to restrain rotation of the pressing member<br>
3, and a. bellows 6 capable of expanding and contracting which covers<br>
a space between the case 1 and the pressing member 3. A rear end<br>
portion of the pressing member 3 is inserted into an inner portion<br>
of the case 1, and a front end portion of the pressing member projects<br>
out to a portion outside of the case 1. A sealing bolt 8 is screwed<br>
onto an opening of a proximal end portion of the case 1 through<br>
a packing 7 , maintaining the airtight characteristics on the proximal<br>
end side.<br>
A male screw portion 9 is formed in a front side portion of<br>
the rotary member 2, and a female screw portion 13 is formed in<br>
an inner circumference of the hollow pressing member 3 . By bringing<br>
the female screw portion 13 into threaded engagement with the male<br>
screw portion 9, it becomes possible to attach the rotary member<br>
2 and the pressing member 3 together so that the rotary member 2<br>
and the pressing member 3 can rotate relative to each other, and<br>
can advance in the axis line X direction while rotating.<br>
The rotary member 2 and the pressing member 3 in the attached<br>
state described above are then inserted into the torsion spring<br>
4. The spring 4 extends in a direction along the axis line X of<br>
the rotary member 2 and the pressing member 3, and one end portion<br>
4a of the spring 4 is inserted into a slit 12 of the rotary member<br>
2. The slit 12 is directed along the axis line X direction of the<br>
rotary member 2. Another end portion 4b of the spring 4 is latched<br>
to the case 1, or is latched to a bearing 5 that is attached to<br>
the case 1. Both end portions 4a and 4b of the spring 4 are thus<br>
latched to the rotary member 2 and the case 1, respectively. When<br>
a tip of a jig used for rotation (a screwdriver, for example) is<br>
inserted into the slit 12 from outside the case 1 while the sealing<br>
bolt 8 is detached, and the rotary member 2 is made to rotate about<br>
the axis line X, energy (torque) of the rotary member 2 , which rotates<br>
the rotary member 2 in an opposite direction, accumulates owing<br>
to the spring 4 twisting.<br>
The bearing 5 is provided in the front end portion of the case<br>
1. A fixing member such as a ring spring 15 fixes the bearing 5<br>
to the case 1. A non-circular sliding hole 5a is formed in the bearing<br>
5, and the pressing member 3 passes through the sliding hole 5a.<br>
An outer circumferential surface of the pressing member 3 is formed<br>
in a non-circular shape in correspondence with the sliding hole<br>
5a of the bearing 5. Mating the pressing member 3 with the sliding<br>
hole 5a of the bearing 5 restricts rotation of the pressing member<br>
3 relative to the case 1. A cap 14 is attached to the front end<br>
of the pressing member 3. The cap 14 contacts the timing belt or<br>
the chain used as the force transmitting member 202 directly, or<br>
indirectly through a relay member.<br>
When the rotary member 2 is made to rotate in a second direction<br>
and the. spring 4 is twisted, elastic energy in the spring 4 causes<br>
the rotary member 2 to rotate in the first direction. This rotation<br>
is transmitted to the pressing member 3 through the screw portions<br>
9 and 13, and the bearing 5 restricts the rotation of the pressing<br>
member 3 . A rotational force of the rotary member 2 is thus converted<br>
into an impulsive force in the axis line X direction of the pressing<br>
member 3. The pressing member 3 thus advances in a direction<br>
projecting from the case 1.<br>
On the other hand, a load Z applied from the force transmitting<br>
member 2 such as a timing belt or a chain acts on the pressing member<br>
3, and pushes the pressing member 3 in the axis line X direction.<br>
This pushing force is transmitted to the rotary member 2 through<br>
the screw portions 9 and 13, and the rotary member 2 thus withstands<br>
an urging force of the spring 4 and rotates in the second direction.<br>
By the rotary member 2 rotating in this direction, the pressing<br>
member 3 is pushed back within the case 1. The tensile force of<br>
the force transmitting member can be kept nearly constant by this<br>
motion.,<br>
The male screw portion 9 on the distal end portion side of<br>
the rotary member 2, and a shaft portion 10 on the proximal end<br>
portion side of the rotary member 2, are provided in a connected<br>
row arrangement. The shaft portion 10 is supported within a support<br>
portion 11 of the case 1, so as to perform rotational support. The<br>
shaft portion 10 of the rotary member 2 is formed as a large diameter<br>
portion having a larger diameter than that of the screw portion<br>
9. A receiving surface 17 for the support portion 11 in the case<br>
1 faces an end surface 16 of the large diameter shaft portion 10.<br>
The end surface 16 of the shaft portion 10 of the rotary member<br>
2 contacts the receiving surface 17 of the support portion 11 of<br>
the case 1. The load Z that is input to the pressing member 3 is<br>
supported by the receiving surface 17 of the support portion 11.<br>
A covering film of a three element alloy of nickel, phosphorous ,<br>
and tungsten is formed on the shaft portion 10 of the rotary member<br>
2. The three element alloy covering film is formed by a plating<br>
made from the three element alloy of nickel, phosphorous, and tungsten.<br>
Fig. 3 is an enlarged partial cross sectional view showing a state<br>
where a three element alloy covering film 22 is formed on the shaft<br>
portion 10 of the rotary member 2. The three element alloy may also<br>
be a three element alloy of elements other than nickel, phosphorous,<br>
and tungsten. For example, a three element alloy of nickel,<br>
phosphorous, and boron can also be used.<br>
In this type of tensioner, fluctuations in frictional torque<br>
and large changes in performance develop due to wear accompanying<br>
usage over time, and due to changes in a lubrication state. It is<br>
thought that this is largely due to the following reasons.<br>
(1) Changes in wear and frictional resistance that are caused<br>
by an urging force of the spring 4, and by a frictional resistance<br>
between the male screw portion 9 and the female screw portion 13.<br>
(2) Changes in wear and frictional resistance due to the rotary<br>
member 2 rotating in the support portion 11 of the case 1 which<br>
supports the shaft portion 10 of the rotary member 2, or due to<br>
an excessive load acting on the support portion 11 which is caused<br>
by a return force acting on the rotary member 2 through the pressing<br>
member 3.<br>
(3) Wear of a contact portion between the bearing 5 and the<br>
case 1 due to a pressing contact force acting on the contact portion<br>
as a rotational force of the spring 4 is transmitted to the bearing<br>
9 that restrains rotation of the pressing member 3.<br>
Rotation of the rotary member 2 for propelling the pressing<br>
member 3 is a very important motion element, and the shaft portion<br>
10 of the rotary member 2 is supported by the support portion 11<br>
of the case 1, and therefore the reason (2) above is considered<br>
to be important regarding changes in the characteristics of the<br>
tensioner. In this embodiment mode, the covering film of the three<br>
element alloy of nickel, phosphorous, and tungsten is formed on<br>
the shaft portion 10 of the rotary member 2, and therefore there<br>
is little wear, and the frictional resistance does not change. The<br>
characteristics therefore become stable over a long period of time,<br>
without large fluctuations developing in the frictional torque and<br>
in the frictional resistance, and without large changes in the<br>
characteristics. The same is also true for the covering film of<br>
the three element alloy of nickel, phosphorous, and boron.<br>
From these points, it is preferable that the three element<br>
alloy covering film be formed not only on the shaft portion 10 of<br>
the rotary member 2, but also on the support portion 11 of the case<br>
1. It is most preferable to form the three element alloy covering<br>
film on all of the surfaces of the support portion 11 of the case<br>
1, the rotary member 2, the shaft portion 10 of the rotary member<br>
2, the pressing member 3, the bearing 5, and the like, which are<br>
members in which the phenomena described in the reasons (1) to (3)<br>
above develop. However, when considering points such as cost and<br>
effect, the three element alloy covering film may be performed at<br>
least on the shaft portion 10 of the rotary body 2.<br>
The three element alloy covering film of nickel, phosphorous,<br>
and tungsten, or of nickel, phosphorous and boron is used in the<br>
present invention for the following reasons.<br>
(1) It is a three element alloy, and there is no dispersion<br>
due to the dispersal state.<br>
(2) It can be manufactured under stable heat treatment<br>
conditions, and the plating hardness is stable.<br>
(3) It is stabilized by heat treatment at a relatively low<br>
temperature, and therefore there is little influence on oxidation<br>
and materials.<br>
(4) The adhesion property is high, and the film thickness is<br>
uniform.<br>
(5) The plating hardness is high, there is superior abrasion<br>
resistance, and there is little influence on the braking force<br>
(frictional resistance) due to the lubrication state over a long<br>
period of time.<br>
Fig. 4 is a graph showing experimental results for a<br>
relationship between aging temperature and hardness. According to<br>
Fig. 4, it can be understood that the hardness stabilizes in the<br>
vicinity of 350°C for the three element alloy of nickel, phosphorous ,<br>
and tungsten, and that the hardness is higher than that of an alloy<br>
of nickel and phosphorous . The hardness stabilizes in the vicinity<br>
of 400°C for the alloy of nickel and phosphorous.<br>
Fig. 5 is a graph showing experimental results for a<br>
relationship between aging time and braking torque. According to<br>
Fig. 5, it can be understood that a product embodying the present<br>
invention, in which the nickel, phosphorous, and tungsten covering<br>
film is implemented, has a lower braking torque and fewer changes<br>
in the braking torque over the passage of time, than a conventional<br>
product in which a covering film of a nickel and phosphorous alloy<br>
is implemented.<br>
It should be noted that the above-mentioned embodiment of the<br>
invention is not intended to limit the present invention. Various<br>
changes may be made to the present invention without departing from<br>
the gist of the invention.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, the tensioner according to the present<br>
invention is used in order to maintain a nearly constant tensile<br>
force, even if slackness develops in the chain or the timing belt<br>
owing to stretching or wear during use. The tensioner is therefore<br>
effective when used with a chain, a timing belt, or the like that<br>
drives a camshaft of an engine mounted in a vehicle such as a four<br>
wheel automobile or a two wheel vehicle.<br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. A tensioner comprising:<br>
a case (1);<br>
a rotary member (2) rotatably stored in the case (1) in a state where a<br>
motion of the rotary member in an axial direction is restrained;<br>
a pressing member (3) that is brought into threaded engagement with the<br>
rotary member (2) and movable in the axial direction, whose rotation with respect<br>
to the case (1) is restrained and on which a load from a force transmitting<br>
member acts in the axial direction; and<br>
a spring (4) which is stored in an inner portion of the case (1) and<br>
transmits a rotational force to the rotary member (2),<br>
the rotary member (2) having its axial portion (10) rotatably<br>
supported by a support portion (11) of the case (1) to support a load that acts on<br>
the pressing member (3),<br>
the pressing member (3) being restrained from rotating by a<br>
bearing (5),<br>
the tensioner being characterized in that:<br>
among the rotary member (2), the shaft portion (10) of the rotary<br>
member (2), the support portion (11) of the case (1), the pressing member (3),<br>
and the bearing (5), a covering film of a three element alloy of nickel,<br>
phosphorous, and tungsten, or a covering film of a three element alloy of nickel,<br>
phosphorous, and boron is formed at least on a surface of the shaft portion (10)<br>
of the rotary member (2).<br>
In a tensioner, in which a shaft portion (10) of a rotary member (2) is<br>
rotatably supported by a support portion (11) of a case (1) to support a load that<br>
acts on a pressing member (3), the pressing member (3) being restrained from<br>
rotating by a bearing (5), among the rotary member (2), the shaft portion (10) of<br>
the rotary member (2), the support portion (11) of the case (1), the pressing<br>
member (3), and the bearing (5), a covering film of a three element alloy of<br>
nickel, phosphorous, and tungsten, or a covering film of a three element alloy of<br>
nickel, phosphorous, and boron is formed at least on a surface of the shaft<br>
portion (10) of the rotary member (2).</td>
