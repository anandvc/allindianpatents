				<td>QUINAZOLINE DERIVATIVES FOR INHIBITING CANCER CELL GROWTH AND METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
Field of,the Invention.<br>
The present invention relates to a novel guinazoline derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for inhibiting the growth of cancer cells, a method for the preparation thereof and a pharmaceutical composition comprising same as an active ingredient.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Most of the traditional drugs used for treating cancers, e.g., taxanes such as paclitaxel and doxetaxel; vinca alkaloid such as vincristine, vinblastine and vinorelbin; anthracyclines such as daunomycin and doxorubicin; camptothecins such as topotecan, irinotecan; actinomycin; and etopocid are based on selective cytotoxicily, but such selectivity against cancer cells has been unsatisfactory to cause many side effects.<br>
To overcome such a problem, recent studies have focused on specific molecular level targets in the cell to maximize the therapeutic effect of an anticancer agent without causing adverse side effects.<br>
In cells, there are many signal transduction systems, which are fuctionally linked to each other to control the proliferation, growth, metastasis and apoptosis of cells. A breakdown of the intracellular controlling system by genetic and environmental influences may cause abnormal amplification or destruction of the signal transduction system so that the possibility for tumor cell generation occurs.<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases play important roles in such cellular regulation, and their abnormal expression or mutation has been observed in cancer cells. Protein tyrosine kinase is an enzyme which catalyzes the transportation of phosphate groups from ATP to tyrosines located on the protein substrate. Many growth factor receptor proteins function as tyrosine kinases to transport<br>
cellular signals. The interaction between growth factors and their receptors normally controls the cellular growth, but abnormal signal transduction caused by the mutation or overexpression of any of the receptors may induce tumor cells or cancers.<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases have been classified into many families in terms of growth factors, and epithelial cell growth factors (EGFs)-related EOF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase have been intensely studied. An EGFR tyrosine kinase is composed of a receptor and tyrosine kinase, and delivers extracellular signals to the cell nuclear through the cellular membrane. The EGFR tyrosine kinases are classified by their structural differences into EGFR (Erb-Bl), Erb-B2, Erb-B3, Erb-B4, and all of the above members can form a homodimer- or heterodimer- signal delivery complex. Also, overexpression of more than one member of the above mentioned homodimers is often observed in malignant cells.<br>
Therefore, the inhibition of mutated or overexpressed EGFR tyrosine kinases has been considered to be useful for treating tumors, and many drugs have been developed therefor, e.g., Gefitinib, Erlotinib, Camertinib, Lapatinib.<br>
International Patent Publications WO 96/033981, WO 96/033979, WO 97/038994 and WO 96/033980 each discloses a quinazoline derivative substituted with an alkoxyalkylamino or alkylaminoalkoxy group, International Patent Publications WO 97/030034 and WO 96/016960 each discloses quinazoline substituted with aryl or heteroaryl, and International Patent Publications WO 2003/040109 and WO 2003/040108 disclose compounds having aminoalkoxy substituents at position 5 of quinazoline (Normaclature of quinazoline is according to a reference [JA. Joule, Chapman &amp; Hall, Heterocydic chemistry, 3rd Ed., 189]).<br>
International Patent Publication WO 95/019970 and United States Patents 5,654,307 and 5,679,683 each discloses various tricyclic heteroarylcompounds, International Patent Publications WO 99/006396, WO 99/006378, WO 97/038983, WO 2000/031048, WO 98/050038, WO 99/024037 and WO 2000/006555, and European Patent 787722 each discloses quinazoline compounds that inhibit the tyrosine kinase irreversably, United States Patent 6,225,318, European Patents 0387063 and 01292591, and International Patent<br>
Publications WO 2001/098277, WO 2003/045939 and WO 2003/049740 each discloses compounds having various alkenyl or alkynyl substiruents at position 6 of quinazoline.<br>
Also, International Patent Publications WO 98/043960, WO 2000/018761, WO 2001/047892, WO 2001/072711, WO 2003/050090; WO 99/09016, WO 2000/018740 and WO 2000/66583 disclose 3-cyanoquinoline compounds, International Patent Publications WO 98/002434, WO 98/002437, WO 99/035132, WO 99/035146, WO 2001/004111 and WO 2002/002552 each discloses various quinazoline compounds substituted with furan having various sulfoneaUeylamino substituents, and International Patent Publications WO 2003/053466 and WO 2001/094353 disclose specific thienopyrimidine compounds.<br>
Further, International Patent Publications WO 2001/012227, WO 2004/014386, WO 2004/035057 and WO 2001/076586 disclose various methods for treating tumors that employ specific drugs that interact with EGFR tyrosine kinase in combination with radiation therapy.<br>
However, the above mentioned conventional quinazoline derivatives have to be taken in large dose for intended treatments, which causes such side efffcts such as diarrhea and skin eruption. Accordingly, there has continued to exist a need to develop an effective drug that gives no adverse side effect.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention-to provide a novel quinazoline derivative which selectively inhibits the cancer cell growth caused by epitherial growth factor without any side effects, and a method for the preparation thereof.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a phamarceutical composition for inhibiting cancer cell growth comprising the quinazoline derivative as an active ingredient.<br>

The medium was removed from each well of the 96-well microplate, 100 µl of a diluted test compound solution was added to each well holding<br>
cultured cells, and the microplate was incubated at 37 °C under 5% C02 for 72 hours. After removing the medium from the plate, 50 µl of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to each well, and the plate was kept at 37 °C for 1 hour to fix the cells to the bottom of the plate. 10% trichloroacetic acid was removed from each well, the plate was dried, 100 µl of an SRB (Sulforhodamine-B) dye solution was added thereto, and reacted for 10 mins, The SRB dye solution was prepared by dissolving SRB in 1% acetic acid to a concentration of 0.4%. After removing the dye solution, the plate was washed with water, and dried. When the dye solution was not removed by water, 1% acetic acid was used. 150 µl of 10 mM trisma base was added to each well, and the absorbance at 570 nm was determined with a microplate reader. IC5o, the concentration at which 50% inhibition occurs, was evaluated by regarding the difference between the final concentration of cells and the initial concentration of the cells incubated hi a well untreated with the test compound as 100%. The calculation of IC50 was carried out by using Microsoft Excel, and the results are shown in Table 5.<br>
