Albutec GmbH<br>
Albumin solution<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing an aqueous albumin solution from a<br>
starting albumin solution, which contains stabilizer molecules, which are capable of occupying<br>
binding sites of the albumin, wherein in a method for increasing the albumin binding capacity<br>
(ABiC) for other molecules, for example those with physiological effects, at least a portion of the<br>
stabilizer molecules is removed from the albumin of the starting albumin solution and separated<br>
from the starting albumin solution.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In many severe diseases with resultant organ failure, the mismatch between the capacity<br>
of the blood vessels and the volume contained therein plays a central role. If the capacity is too<br>
high or the volume is too low, blood pressure drops result and the organs are not sufficiently<br>
flushed with blood. If the capacity is too small or the volume too large, blood pressure rises with<br>
consequent heart insufficiency and/or lung oedema.<br>
Both sudden and slow volume loss in the blood vessels may be responsible for blood<br>
pressure drops with minimum perfusion. Sudden loss in volume may occur when bleeding<br>
occurs. Slow volume losses result, for example, from fluid loss by transudation from the<br>
vascular bed into the intercellular space due to reducing concentrations of albumin as an oncotic<br>
protein (for example when synthesis is affected in liver disease). However, both sudden and<br>
slow increases in the capacity of the vessels may also be responsible for blood pressure drops.<br>
Sudden vessel expansion results, for example, from an acute cascade of vasodilatory textile<br>
hormones, such as histamine, bradykinin, kallikrein, leukotrienes or prostaglandins, which occur<br>
during anaphylactic shock. Slow expansions result from a chronic pressure rise in the portal<br>
artery linked to an increased presence of vasodilatories in the arterioles of the splanchnic<br>
network and result in hepatorenal syndrome with ascites formation via an enlargement of<br>
capacity.<br>
In each case there is a mismatch between the capacity and volume, which can be<br>
influenced by two treatment strategies.<br>
Firstly, an attempt can be made to increase the intravasal volume by administering<br>
crystalloid or colloidal volume replacement solutions. If the mean arterial pressure is not thereby<br>
brought into the range which allows sufficient blood flow to all organs, then in the second step<br>
"pressors" (vasocontrictors, for example catecholamine) are used which narrow the vessels.<br>
Such a vasoconstriction is used particularly when vessel tonus is lost, as occurs in liver disease<br>
and sepsis, to try and further reduce the capacity of the vessel system.<br><br>
2<br>
In diseases which cause acute or chronic vasodilation through a higher level of<br>
vasodilators, maintaining a sufficient blood pressure by infusion for long term volume increase is<br>
not possible without vasoconstrictors. Examples of such intensive care medical problems are<br>
liver failure with a pressure drop and hepatorenal problems (secondary kidney failure in liver<br>
failure due to blood flow problems) or sepsis. Both cases are linked to a high mortality and are<br>
expensive medically.<br>
Existing solutions recommend the administration of volume replacement fluids in<br>
combination with vasoconstrictors. The time which existing volume replacement fluids spend in<br>
the vessels is limited, however. Crystalloid (salt-containing) infusion solutions diffuse quickly<br>
into the intercellular space. Volume replacement solutions with polymers, for example starch<br>
solutions (hydroxyethyl starch, HAES) or gelatin solutions (Gelafundin) are effective in the<br>
vessels for longer, as they have water-binding properties which keep the plasma liquid in the<br>
vessel and thus can increase the intravasal volume for a longer period. However, problems arise<br>
with artificial polymers due to incompatibility.<br>
A particularly suitable volume replacement means is a solution of the natural colloid<br>
serum albumin. Serum albumin has been used in the medical field for decades as a plasma<br>
expander and is considered to be the best tolerated biologically and thus the most preferred<br>
volume expansion medium, albeit the most expensive.<br>
Solutions of human serum albumin for infusion are commercially available. However,<br>
those solutions must be supplemented with stabilizers to allow pasteurization and storage, to<br>
avoid the spontaneous polymerization of the albumin. Usually, N-acetyl tryptophan and<br>
octanoic acid or their sodium salts are used, alone or in combination. These stabilizers have a<br>
very high binding affinity for the albumin molecule and occupy and block important binding<br>
sites for the biological function of the albumin.<br>
Meta-analysis has shown that the use of serum albumin solutions in intensive care when<br>
compared to other plasma volume replacement solutions was linked to increased mortality<br>
(Cochrane meta-analysis in BMJ 1998; 317, p 235-240). With the exception of a few particular<br>
indications, then, existing albumin infusion solutions appear to have no clinical advantage. How<br>
the production method (fractionation with subsequent pasteurization and stabilization) of<br>
existing serum albumin solutions adversely affects the theoretical ideal properties of the serum<br>
albumin as a plasma expander, is not currently known. The literature makes inconsistent<br>
mention that the stabilizers N-acetyl tryptophan and octanoic acid could under certain<br>
circumstances have damaging side effects. Thus, it would be desirable if these stabilizers could<br>
be removed before administering the albumin solution to a patient, as these occupy and block<br>
binding sites which are required for important functions of the albumin with a high affinity.<br><br>
3<br>
However, stabilizer-free albumin solutions suffer from the problem mentioned above of<br>
spontaneous polymerization of the albumin and thus the poor storage properties of such<br>
solutions.<br>
The biologically important ability of human serum albumin to bind ligands is treated in<br>
many publications. A comprehensive overview can be found, inter alia, in<br>
J. Peters jr., All about Albumin, Academic Press, San Diego, New York, Boston, London,<br>
Sydney, Tokyo Toronto, 1996, and in Pacifici GM, Viani A, Methods of Determining Plasma<br>
and Textile Binding of Drugs, Clin Pharmacokinet, 1992, 23 (6): 449-468. Because of the<br>
enormous variety of methods for determining the albumin binding capacity, the results are<br>
difficult to compare and an interpretation as regards its medical relevance is practically<br>
impossible.<br>
A novel method for documenting the binding behaviour of albumin is constituted by a<br>
measurement of the albumin binding capacity (ABiC) for dansylsarcosin (Klammt S, Brinkmann<br>
B, Mitzner S, Munzert E, Loock J, Stange J, Emmrich J, Liebe S, Albumin Binding Capacity<br>
(ABiC) is reduced in commercially available Human Serum Albumin preparations with<br>
stabilizers, Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie, Supplement 2001, 39: 24-27.). These methods are<br>
based on measuring the ultrafiltered part of the test marker dansylsarcosin under predetermined<br>
experimental conditions and the relationship of this binding capacity to a reference albumin.<br>
In a comparison between healthy blood donors and patients with serious liver diseases, a<br>
significant reduction in the binding capacity of serum albumin was observed which was<br>
explained by the greater occupation of the serum albumin binding sites by endogenous ligands as<br>
a result of liver detoxification malfunctions in the patients under investigation. It is known that<br>
the binding behaviour of commercially available preparations of human serum albumin towards<br>
particular model markers (for example Ibuprofen) is also dramatically limited.<br>
It is also known that in a ligand-free albumin, the binding capacity for dansylsarcosin can<br>
be reduced from 100% to about 60% if N-acetyl tryptophan is added stepwise in amounts of up<br>
to a molar ratio of 1:1 (measured using the ABiC in accordance with Klammt et al, 2001).<br>
The technical and medical literature contains many publications regarding the<br>
purification of albumin from donor plasma or from biotechnologically produced (recombinant)<br>
albumin. These publications are, however, are primarily concerned with the purest possible<br>
preparation of the albumin fraction and the removal of other protein components or potentially<br>
toxic components from the blood plasma or, in the case of recombinant production, from the<br>
vector system.<br>
The removal of low molecular weight ligands such as stabilizers in commercial serum<br>
albumin solutions was carried out up to 1967 using Goodman's methods (Goodman D S,<br><br>
4<br>
Science, 125, 1996, 1957) based on extraction with a mixture of iso-octane and acetic acid, or<br>
William's methods (Williams E J and Foster J F, J Am Chem Soc, 81, 965, 1959), based on<br>
spontaneous lipid layer formation in highly acidic media. Both methods are extremely time-<br>
consuming and not suitable for the production of therapeutic preparations because of potential<br>
toxicity. Albumin solutions produced using those methods have very poor stability on storage.<br>
Since 1967, free fatty acids have been added to albumin solutions as stabilizers, such as<br>
octanoic acid, and removed from the albumin solution by rendering it highly acidic and then<br>
treatment with activated charcoal. The method was initially published by Chen et al, Journal of<br>
Biological Chemistry, volume 212, no 2, 25, January, p 173-181, 1967. In that method, the<br>
albumin solution is acidified in distilled water using an acid (HC1) to a pH of 3 or less to unfold<br>
the albumin molecule by breaking hydrogen bonds and also to protonate the corresponding fatty<br>
acids. This loosens the bond between albumin and the fatty acid to such an extent that the fatty<br>
acid can diffuse to the activated charcoal as a small molecule. Next, the albumin solution is<br>
mixed with activated charcoal and stirred for 1 hour in an ice bath using a magnetic stirrer.<br>
Next, the activated charcoal is separated by centrifuging the mixture at 20200g. In this method,<br>
various fatty acids can be removed. This standard procedure (until now) for the removal of fatty<br>
acids is based on detailed investigations of the various conditions such as the pH and the mass<br>
ratios of activated charcoal to albumin, wherein the standard procedure described above is by far<br>
the most successful. The removal of stabilizers from albumin molecules was thus only achieved<br>
by breaking the structure of the albumin molecule and an associated reduction in the binding<br>
affinity in a highly acidic medium. Substantial reduction of free fatty acids from human serum<br>
albumin at higher pHs of more than 3 was not successful.<br>
An important disadvantage of the method is the structural alteration of the albumin<br>
molecule by the considerable acidification in aqueous medium. Herein, not only the loop-<br>
forming bonds between amino acids which are separated from each other are cut, but also the<br>
hydrophobic binding pockets are opened up, which leads to increased adsorption of the albumin<br>
on the activated charcoal which is used. Chen et al note albumin losses of 20% in the charcoal<br>
pellet in their method. The method is unsuitable for the primary production of commercial<br>
therapeutic albumin solutions as the structural alteration in the albumin molecule triggers a<br>
spontaneous polymerization of the human serum albumin on storage.<br>
Thus, the invention aims to provide a method wherein a stabilized commercial starting<br>
albumin solution can be prepared in a simple, fast and inexpensive manner which is gentle on the<br>
albumin, for example at the bedside immediately before administration to a patient, removing a<br>
major portion of the stabilizers and raising the albumin binding capacity, without damaging the<br>
structure of the albumin.<br><br>
5<br>
In particular, the method should provide an increase in the albumin binding capacity at<br>
the Sudlow II binding site which is of significance for the effectivity in immobilizing<br>
endogenous albumin-seeking toxins for all applications of albumin in intravenous volume<br>
replacement therapy, but also for extracorporal detoxification procedures, such as plasma<br>
exchange against albumin or extracorporal albumindialysis.<br>
This aim is achieved by dint of a method for producing an aqueous albumin solution from<br>
a starting albumin solution which contains stabilizer molecules which are capable of occupying<br>
binding sites of the albumin, wherein in a method for increasing the albumin binding capacity<br>
(ABiC) for other molecules, at least a portion of the stabilizer molecules is removed from the<br>
albumin of the starting albumin solution and separated from the starting albumin solution,<br>
wherein:<br>
a)	the starting albumin solution is brought into contact with a solid adsorption<br>
material the affinity of which for at least a portion, preferably all of the<br>
stabilizer molecules used, is higher than the affinity of the albumin for the<br>
corresponding stabilizer molecules; wherein the method is carried out at a pH<br>
of&gt; 3; and<br>
b)	the albumin is separated from the adsorption material.<br>
Particularly preferably, the method is carried out at a pH in the range 5 to 9, more<br>
preferably in the range 6 to 8. Particularly preferably, the pH range is 6.9 to 7.5.<br>
In a quarter of current medical applications for human serum albumin (HS A) as a volume<br>
replacement medium (in total about 200 tonnes per year), in addition to colloid-osmotic<br>
properties, intact binding properties for toxins (for example benzodiazepine) play a major role,<br>
namely for indications associated with liver disease. This property is, however, limited in<br>
commercial preparations by stabilizers (N-acetyl tryptophan and octanoic acid) which occupy<br>
binding sites, which is reflected in a reduced albumin binding capacity (ABiC). The method of<br>
the invention allows a commercial, stabilized albumin solution to be prepared close to the<br>
administration location without active pH manipulation. The prepared solution contains albumin<br>
which has a raised ABiC.<br>
Thus, the properties of human serum albumin as a plasma expander are clinically<br>
improved so that the binding power of the albumin is comparable to the physiological<br>
transportability of human serum albumin (HSA). Circulatory, kidney and brain functions of<br>
patients are positively affected and the cost/benefit ratio is significantly improved.<br>
The invention stems from the surprising observation that using a corresponding<br>
procedure and using suitable adsorption material, the stabilizers contained in commercial<br>
albumin solutions to stabilize and prevent spontaneous polymerization, in particular medium<br><br>
6<br>
chain fatty acids (for example octanoate), can be removed without a drastic reduction in pH<br>
simply, quickly, without any large expenditure and in sufficient amount, and delivers a<br>
measurable rise in albumin binding capacity (ABiC). The method of the invention is particularly<br>
suitable for the extemporaneous or bedside preparation of commercial stabilized albumin<br>
solutions, which can be administered to a patient immediately following preparation. The<br>
method has the further advantage that the albumin in the solution is not subjected to extreme<br>
conditions such as the drastic drop in the pH used in the prior art to remove the stabilizers from<br>
the binding sites of the albumin molecule by breaking bonds between amino acids separated<br>
from each other in the albumin chain, which determine loop formation and binding site<br>
properties. In the method of the invention, the deleterious structural alteration of the albumin<br>
molecule which was known in the prior art does not occur.<br>
Definitions<br>
Albumin binding capacity (ABiC)<br>
The albumin binding capacity (ABiC) in the context of this invention is determined using<br>
Klammt et al's method. Firstly, the albumin concentration in an albumin solution is determined<br>
by scattering measurements (nephelometry) and the solution is then adjusted to an albumin<br>
concentration of 150 umol/l or 300 umol/1 by dilution. Next, one volume of the albumin<br>
solution with a predetermined concentration of a fluorescence marker (dansylsarcosin, Sigma<br>
Chemical) which is specific for binding site II (diazepam binding site) of the albumin is added in<br>
an equilmolar ratio and incubated for 20 min at 25°C. After incubation, unbound fluorescence<br>
marker is separated out by ultrafiltration (Centrisart I, Sartorius Gottingen; exclusion size: 20000<br>
dalton) and the amount of unbound fluorescence marker in the separated solution is determined<br>
by fluorescence spectrometry (Fluoroscan, Labsystems, Finland; excitation: 355 nm; emission:<br>
460 nm). To reinforce the fluorescence, the solution of unbound fluorescence marker is<br>
supplemented with ligand-free albumin (fatty acid free; from Sigma Aldrich in powder form) in<br>
a concentration of 150 umol/1 or 300 μmol/1. Alongside the sample amino acid solution, the<br>
same measurement is carried out on a corresponding solution of a reference albumin. The<br>
reference is purified and deligandised human serum albumin (BiSeKo, Biotest Pharma GmbH,<br>
Dreieich, Germany). Alternatively, the albumin can also be removed from a serum pool of more<br>
than 50 healthy blood donors (using Deutsches Rotes Kreuz [German red Cross] criteria). The<br>
albumin binding capacity (ABiC) is calculated using the following formula:<br>
ABiC [%] = cone, unbound fluorescence marker (reference albumin) x 100<br>
cone, unbound fluorescence marker (sample albumin)<br>
NB: the albumin binding capacity (ABiC) measured in accordance with Klammt et al and<br>
using the above formula does not give the absolute binding capacity of albumin for all of its<br><br>
7<br>
binding sites, but the relative binding capacity, compared with the reference albumin, for ligands<br>
which bind to Sudlow II binding sites (diazepam binding sites). It can thus have a value of more<br>
than 100%. The special measurement method is, however, particularly suitable for measuring<br>
even the smallest changes in the albumin binding capacity as the marker is particularly easily<br>
expelled from the bond.<br>
Normal commercial albumin solutions, which are stabilized with N-acetyl tryptophan<br>
and/or octanoic acid or their Na salts, usually have an albumin binding capacity as measured<br>
using the determination method described here, of less than 60%. The present invention is based<br>
on the use of an adsorption method with an adsorber which at a pH of &gt; 3, preferably a pH in the<br>
range 5 to 9, has a higher affinity for the stabilizers used (for example octanoic acid and/or N-<br>
acetyl tryptophan) than albumin itself. Using the method of the invention, the albumin binding<br>
capacity in commercial stabilized albumin solutions can be raised without acidification to more<br>
than 100% (with respect to the reference albumin) in less than 30 minutes.<br>
An essential advantage of the method of the invention is that the albumin is not<br>
substantially changed structurally under extreme conditions such as severe acidification or the<br>
use of denaturing means, but essentially retains its native conformation. Thus, following<br>
infusion into a patient, and due to the improved binding capacity following stabilizer removal, a<br>
considerably higher activity is obtained than in commercial albumin preparations. A further<br>
advantage of the method of the invention is that the stabilized albumin solution can be quickly<br>
depleted in stabilizers using cheap and simple apparatus to prepare the stabilizer-depleted<br>
albumin solution. Thus, renaturing the albumin after removing the stabilizers, for example by<br>
spontaneous regeneration of the inner loop of the albumin, which is linked to the uncertainty of<br>
spontaneous formation of depleted or polymerized albumin molecules, is not necessary.<br>
Normally, after depletion, the albumin solution of the invention is fed only through a particle<br>
filter with a pore size of more than 65000 daltons, to remove any coarse particles which may be<br>
present. This allows the method to be carried out close to the point of administration (for<br>
example at the bedside).<br>
Since as a rule albumin is administered to humans, for example as a plasma expander,<br>
then in accordance with the invention human serum albumin (HSA) is advantageously used.<br>
Although the method of the invention can be used to remove many stabilizers or other ligands, it<br>
is particularly suited to removing the stabilizer molecules N-acetyl tryptophan and/or octanoic<br>
acid or their anions. Advantageously, the method can be used for ligands with a Ka value<br>
(association constant) of more than 104.<br>
In a preferred implementation of the method of the invention, the starting albumin<br>
solution and the adsorption material are brought into contact in said step a) by feeding the<br><br>
8<br>
starting albumin solution through a column containing the adsorption material (chromatographic<br>
column).<br>
In an alternative implementation of the method of the invention, the starting albumin<br>
solution and the adsorption material are brought into contact in said step a) by feeding the<br>
starting albumin solution through a bed formed by the adsorption material. A particularly apt<br>
example is a gently moving fluidized bed which is moved using a slowly moving stirrer or<br>
vibrator or a counter-current. This prevents the channels or paths in a closely packed bed of<br>
adsorption material from being occupied by very small particles which inhibit or block the<br>
throughput of albumin solution.<br>
As already mentioned, separation of the albumin solution from the adsorption material in<br>
said step b) is advantageously carried out by filtering the albumin solution through a particle<br>
filter, wherein the particle filter is selected so that the albumin molecules can pass through and<br>
the solid adsorption material is retained.<br>
In a further preferred implementation of the method of the invention, the adsorption<br>
material particles are bound to or in a matrix. Suitable matrix materials are support textiles (for<br>
example polymer fiber textiles) or open-pored polymer foam structures (for example open-celled<br>
polyurethane foams). In a further alternative implementation, the particles of adsorption material<br>
are also simply formed into a solid bed reactor by mixing in highly porous particles as "spacers",<br>
which provides sufficient spacing of the adsorption material particles and suitable channel sizes.<br>
When fixing in highly porous open-celled polymer foams, it is also possible simultaneously or<br>
subsequently to produce channels, for example by boring. An advantageous packing with this<br>
implementation is a "loose" packing using the textile or support polymer, which provides a low<br>
perfusion back-pressure to the relatively highly viscous albumin solutions. Further, the<br>
specifications for the filter for retaining the micro-particles are much lower than in the<br>
implementations described above.<br>
In a further preferred implementation of the method of the invention, steps a) and b) are<br>
repeated several times, preferably 2 to 6 times, wherein in each case the treated albumin solution<br>
obtained in step b) is fed back to step a). To improve the depletion rate, in step a) regenerated<br>
and/or fresh adsorption material is advantageously used for the removal of stabilizer molecules.<br>
This can be carried out by exchanging the adsorption material in the apparatus provided, but<br>
particularly preferably, several adsorption devices with adsorption material are arranged in<br>
series, through which the albumin solution is fed in succession.<br>
In a further preferred implementation of the method of the invention, the amount of<br>
adsorption material compared with the albumin concentration in the starting albumin solution<br>
and/or the contact time between the starting albumin solution and the adsorption material in step<br><br>
9<br>
a) is selected so that the albumin binding capacity (ABiC) of the albumin solution produced,<br>
measured in accordance with Klammt et al, is at least 60%, preferably at least 70%, particularly<br>
preferably at least 80% and more particularly preferably at least 90%. The amount of adsorption<br>
material required here and the contact time will depend on the starting albumin used and the<br>
apparatus used and can be determined by the skilled person using his general knowledge and<br>
skill.<br>
In a further preferred implementation of the method of the invention, the amount of<br>
adsorption material used compared with the albumin concentration in the starting albumin<br>
solution and/or the contact time between the starting albumin solution and the adsorption<br>
material in step a) is selected so that the concentrations of bound and unbound stabilizer<br>
molecules, in particular N-acetyl tryptophan and/or octanoic acid or their anions, in the starting<br>
albumin solution is reduced to less than 70%, preferably less than 50%, particularly preferably<br>
less than 30% and more particularly preferably less than 10% of its starting concentration. The<br>
amount of adsorption material and the contact time will depend on the starting albumin used and<br>
the apparatus selected and can be determined by the skilled person using his general knowledge<br>
and skill.<br>
In a further preferred implementation of the method of the invention, the amount of<br>
adsorption material used compared with the albumin concentration in the starting albumin<br>
solution and/or the contact time between the starting albumin solution and the adsorption<br>
material in step a) is selected so that the concentrations of bound and unbound stabilizer<br>
molecules, in particular N-acetyl tryptophan and/or octanoic acid or their anions, in the starting<br>
albumin solution is reduced to less than 3.5 mol/mol albumin, preferably less than 2.5 mol/mol<br>
albumin, particularly preferably less than 1.5 mol/mol albumin and more particularly preferably<br>
less than 0.5 mol/mol albumin of its starting concentration.<br>
Particularly preferably, the adsorption material for carrying out the method of the<br>
invention is a particulate material which is packed in a column or a bed or a support matrix so<br>
that fluid-carrying channels are formed between the particles of adsorption material, wherein the<br>
mean diameter of the channels, taken over the total length of the channels formed between the<br>
particles of all of the adsorption material employed, is more than 100 nm and less than 1000 μm,<br>
preferably less than 500 μm, more preferably less than 300 μm and particularly preferably less<br>
than 200 μm, still more preferably less than 100 μm.<br>
The smaller the channel diameter, the greater the possibility of or frequency at which the<br>
albumin molecules will come into contact with the walls of the channels formed by the<br>
adsorption material and the higher the depletion rate in the method of the invention. However,<br>
the dimensions of the channels must not be too small as the flow rate of the albumin would be<br><br>
10<br>
slowed down too much. Thus, it has proved to be particularly advantageous if the mean<br>
diameter of the channels, taken over the total length of the channels formed by the particles of all<br>
of the adsorption material used, is more than 100 run and less than 60 μm, particularly preferably<br>
less than 10 μm.<br>
In a particularly preferred implementation of the method of the invention, the minimum<br>
contact time between the starting albumin solution and the adsorption material in step a) is<br>
selected so that:<br>
dm [urn] /10 [μm/min] ≤ contact time [min] ≤ dm [μm] /0.1 [μm/min],<br>
wherein "dm" means the mean channel diameter, taken over the total length of the channels<br>
formed between the particles of all of the adsorption material used.<br>
More efficient depletion occurs if the minimum contact time between the starting<br>
albumin solution and the adsorption material in step a) is selected so that:<br>
dm [μm] / 4 [μm/min] ≤ contact time [min] ≤ dm [μm] / 0.3 [μm/min],<br>
wherein "dm" means the mean channel diameter, taken over the total length of the channels<br>
formed between the particles of all of the adsorption material.<br>
In a particularly preferred implementation of the method of the invention, the adsorption<br>
material is activated charcoal. The activated charcoal is advantageously used as a material which<br>
can form a suspension or as a powder, for example packed in a column or as a bed of adsorption<br>
material. It is important that the activated charcoal particles in the powder can form channels<br>
between the particles which on the one hand are sufficiently large to allow the albumin solution<br>
to flow through the adsorption material with a sufficient flow rate, and on the other hand are<br>
sufficiently narrow that the albumin molecules in the albumin solution can come into direct<br>
surface contact with the activated charcoal particles at a high frequency during flow through.<br>
Particularly preferably, the activated charcoal powder is such that the channels formed between<br>
the particles have the cited advantageous channel diameters. The mean diameter of the channels<br>
between the activated charcoal particles should thus, taken over the total length of the channels<br>
formed between the activated charcoal particles, be more than 100 run and less than 1000 μm,<br>
preferably less than 500 μm, particularly preferably less than 300 μm, more preferably less than<br>
200 μm and still more preferably less than 100 μm.<br><br>
11<br>
Alternatively, the activated charcoal can also be embedded as the adsorption material in a<br>
solid porous matrix, for example a polymer matrix formed from cellulose, resin or other polymer<br>
fibres or open-pored foams. When embedding the activated charcoal in a matrix, care should be<br>
taken that the matrix allows the albumin solution to flow in and that the matrix carries the<br>
activated charcoal particles in such a manner that they can come into contact with the albumin<br>
solution. Further, the porosity of the matrix material should be such that the pores can form<br>
channels with the channel diameters cited above to allow the albumin solution to flow through.<br>
Advantageously, a support matrix with hydrophilic properties is used, which allows the<br>
adsorption material to be wetted. Such a support matrix can, for example, include cellulose or<br>
other natural or synthetically produced hydrophilic polymers.<br>
Activated charcoal itself is a porous material which within its particle has macropores (&gt;<br>
25 nm), mesopores (1-25 run) and micropores (
large internal surface area. The size of these pores is normally given for activated charcoal by<br>
the molasses number (macropores), the methylene blue adsorption (mesopores) and the iodine<br>
number (micropores). The internal surface area is determined using BET and given in m2/g<br>
activated charcoal. Activated charcoal is generally known as an adsorption medium which takes<br>
molecules into its pores and retains them therein or immobilizes substances by surface bonds.<br>
Because of the high porosity and internal surface area, activated charcoal has a very high<br>
adsorption capacity compared with its weight or external volume. This is dependent on the<br>
molecules being able to diffuse into these pores.<br>
The state of the art regarding the preparation of commercial albumin solutions shows that<br>
only the use of activated charcoal alone is not sufficient to remove stabilizers which are very<br>
strongly bound to the albumin molecule in a stabilized albumin solution from the albumin<br>
molecule, in particular not at an acceptable rate. This is also confirmed by methods used until<br>
now for removing stabilizers from albumin solutions in which activated charcoal as an<br>
adsorption medium is added to a slurry, however without success at pHs of more than 3. Only<br>
following strong acidification and the accompanying structural alteration or denaturing of the<br>
albumin have known methods been successful in removing the stabilizer molecules from the<br>
albumin and successfully binding them to the activated charcoal.<br>
The inventors have now discovered that a particular arrangement of particles of the<br>
adsorption material, in particular activated charcoal, namely advantageous dimensions of the<br>
channels between the particles leads to easier and faster release of stabilizer molecules which are<br>
strongly bound to the albumin molecules than before, under milder conditions such as a pH of &gt;<br>
3. The channels have a mean diameter of more than 100 nm so that the albumin molecules can<br>
gain proper ingress.    Thus, they must be substantially larger than the meso or micropores<br><br>
12<br>
normally occurs in activated charcoal adsorption. The mean diameter of the channels should be<br>
no larger than 1000 μm. It has been shown that the rate of stabilizer removal from the albumin<br>
molecules is higher when the mean channel diameter is smaller, as long as it is more than 100<br>
nm. Advantageously, the particles of adsorption material are arranged so that the channels have<br>
at least one inlet and one outlet so that albumin molecules which enter are not trapped therein but<br>
can then leave the channels.<br>
Moreover, it was discovered that the rate of stabilizer removal when using activated<br>
charcoal as an adsorption material can be further improved if the activated charcoal, which can<br>
be obtained and produced in a variety of porosities and internal surface areas for use as an<br>
adsorption material, is selected so that it has a molasses number (IUPAC) of 100 to 400,<br>
preferably 200 to 300. More advantageously, it has a methylene blue adsorption (IUPAC) of 1<br>
to 100 g/100 g of activated charcoal, preferably 10 to 30 g/100 g of activated charcoal, an iodine<br>
number (IUPAC) of 500 to 3000, preferably 800 to 1500, and/or a total internal surface area<br>
(BET) (IUPAC) of 100 to 5000 m2/g of activated charcoal, preferably 800 to 1400 m2/g activated<br>
charcoal.<br>
The invention also concerns adsorption materials with the features defined above and its<br>
use in carrying out the method of the invention. Further, the invention also concerns the use of<br>
an aqueous albumin solution, produced using the method of the invention, for the production of a<br>
means for treating hypoalbuminaemia, a volume replacement medium or plasma expander and/or<br>
a means for improving the circulation, kidney and/or brain function of a patient. The medium is<br>
directed towards the stronger immobilization of physiological substances with an affinity to<br>
albumin.<br>
The invention also concerns the use of an aqueous albumin solution produced using the<br>
method of the invention for the production of a means for purifying blood, as a plasma<br>
replacement means or as a dialysate for albumin dialysis. In particular for the latter application,<br>
an albumin solution produced in accordance with the invention is substantially cheaper than<br>
comparable solutions of ligand-free albumin, such as recombinant human serum albumin.<br>
The method of the invention or an albumin solution produced in accordance with the<br>
method which is depleted in stabilizers is of great application in medicine. Patients with severe<br>
liver disease, hypotonus and hyperdynamic circulation problems have a limited albumin binding<br>
capacity (ABiC), which cannot be improved by currently available standard albumin<br>
preparations. Although in this connection it has not yet been borne out experimentally, in theory<br>
this limited binding capacity is a consequence of the endogenous accumulation of albumin-<br>
seeking toxins which can no longer be physiologically sufficiently broken down by the damaged<br>
liver. Attempts to build up this limited albumin binding capacity using commercial preparations<br><br>
13<br>
of human serum albumin failed by overloading the preparations with stabilizers, as necessitated<br>
by the production method. However, these stabilizers are vital for the pasteurization of albumin<br>
solutions as regards virus protection and safe storage to prevent spontaneous polymerization.<br>
Removing these stabilizers has until now required extreme acidification and/or was associated<br>
with a large loss of albumin. The invention provides a method for production near to the point of<br>
use of an albumin solution with improved albumin binding capacity without active prior<br>
acidification.<br>
The albumin solution produced in accordance with the invention can, inter alia, be used<br>
as a volume replacement means with a stabilizer-free albumin with a high binding capacity for<br>
vasoactive substances and toxins with an affinity for the diazepam binding sites of the albumins<br>
(Sudlow binding site ii). The method of the invention is cheap and economic as regards<br>
apparatus, so that it can readily be carried out, for example at the bedside shortly before infusion<br>
of the solution into a patient.<br>
Because of the improved binding capacity of the albumin made in accordance with the<br>
invention, the albumin solution not only acts as a volume replacement, as previously assumed by<br>
a raised colloid osmotic i.e. water binding effect in the vessels, but also by actively immobilizing<br>
vasodilatory and other toxic substances. This results in a reduction in vasodilation and thus a<br>
synergistic effect of the volume replacement on the degree of filling of the vascular bed. Lastly,<br>
the considerable influence on mean arterial pressure and thus perfusion of the vessel system is<br>
shown by the diastolic blood pressure.<br>
Further, the albumin solution produced in accordance with the invention can<br>
advantageously be used to improve the binding of ligands in albumin dialysis.<br>
The method of the invention has the advantage that stabilizer depletion in an albumin<br>
solution can be carried out at a high rate, i.e. in a relatively short period. Thus, a commercial<br>
albumin solution can be treated within 10 to 30 minutes and the albumin binding capacity can be<br>
substantially raised. The method is thus suitable, inter alia, for bedside preparation of<br>
commercially stabilized albumin solutions although the invention is not limited thereto.<br>
Depletion in the pharmacies of clinics or other establishments or enterprises is also possible.<br>
In accordance with the method of the invention, commercial albumin solutions stabilized<br>
with octanoic acid (octatoate) and/or N-acetyl tryptophan (N-acetyl tryptophanate) can be<br>
reduced to respective concentrations of these stabilizers of less than 5 mol/mol albumin,<br>
preferably less than 1 mol/mol albumin, particularly preferably less than 0.2 mol/mol albumin.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail using some examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Adsorption material powder in packed column<br><br>
14<br>
In an experiment to compare the efficiency as regards the depletion of stabilizer<br>
molecules from stabilized albumin solutions, various adsorption material preparations were<br>
produced and tested.<br>
For two preparations of adsorption material of the invention, a defined activated charcoal<br>
Norit GAC 830 (Norit) was processed by grinding in an industrial grinder to various particle<br>
sizes. The particle sizes of the ground products was then measured microscopically and using a<br>
commercial particle analyzer. For the first batch of the invention (Al), Norit GAC 830 was<br>
ground to a particle size of 1 mm (D50) and for the second batch (A2), Norit GAC 830 was<br>
ground to a particle size of 0.1 mm (D50). D50 corresponds to the 50th percentile (see below).<br>
For comparison (V), a Norit ROX extruded charcoal (Norit) was used.<br>
100 g of the activated charcoal materials were placed in a column with a diameter of 6<br>
cm and a height of 10 cm provided with a sieve base and watered. 20 g of commercial albumin<br>
in 330 ml of salt solution (ZLB Behring, pH 7.2) recirculated at a rate of 170 ml/min was passed<br>
through the adsorption material in each column. At time zero and after 20, 30, 60 and 120 min,<br>
the concentrations of octanoic acid, N-acetyl tryptophan and albumin as well as the albumin<br>
binding capacity (Klammt et al, 2001) were determined. For the control, the values were also<br>
determined at times 240, 1440 and 2880 minutes. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
The Norit ROX extruded charcoal material formed very broad spaces or channels<br>
between the particles because of the extruded shape of the material when filled into a column,<br>
with a diameter which was sometimes over 1 mm, which is advantageous for the perfusion<br>
pressure, in particular at high rates of 100 to 250 ml/min. A comparison with batches Al and A2<br>
of the invention with ground activated charcoal showed, however, that this adsorption material<br>
with rather large channels is practically unsuitable for increasing the albumin binding capacity in<br>
a short period.<br>
For powdered ground activated charcoal materials of batches Al and A2 in the columns,<br>
the channel diameter was given by the following formula (I) to a good approximation:<br>
RK = [RP2+(RP *0.57735)2]0.5 - Rp	(I)<br>
where RK is the mean channel radius between the particles and Rp is the mean radius of the<br>
particle iteself.<br>
For the ground particles of batch Al with a mean diameter of 1 mm, i.e. a radius Rp of<br>
500 μm, the mean channel radius RK was 77 μm, i.e. a mean channel width (also mean diameter)<br>
of about 150 μm. For the ground particles of batch A2, with a mean diameter of 0.1 mm, i.e. a<br><br>
15<br>
radius Rp of 50 μm, the mean channel radius RK was 7.7 urn, i.e. a mean channel width (also<br>
mean diameter) of about 15 μm.<br>
The results of this calculation of the channel widths based on the above formula was also<br>
confirmed by fixing samples of the column materials in resin and microscopic examination.<br>

The results with Norit ROX confirm the above description, that under physiological<br>
conditions, in particular at a neutral pH, a substantial depletion in stabilizers under the<br>
experimental conditions used until now, i.e. the use of activated charcoal powders or suspensions<br>
with large channel widths, is not possible in 60 minutes, at least not in an amount which<br>
substantially raises the albumin binding capacity.<br>
Surprisingly, extending the contact time according to the data given in this application<br>
can produce a depletion in octanoic acid even with this activated charcoal, which results in an<br>
increase in the albumin binding capacity.<br>
According to the guidelines for estimating the minimum required contact time as a<br>
function of the channel width, for a mean width (dm) of 1000 μm, the contact time should be<br>
extended to over 250 min. The experiments show that at 240 min the ABiC is only just over<br>
80%, an acceptable value of over 90% only being measured after one day (1440 min).<br>
On investigating the surface structure of the test activated charcoal, it was shown that<br>
only a disappearingly small fraction of the albumin molecule could actually come into direct<br><br>
16<br>
contact with the activated charcoal surface as on the one hand only the macropores could allow<br>
the albumin molecule a certain ingress, while the vast majority of the mesopores are too small to<br>
allow albumin to pass. The macropores, however, constitute a disappearingly small fraction of<br>
the pores and branch very quickly immediately beneath the external surface into mesopores<br>
which can no longer be transited by the albumin molecule. Where macropores allow the ingress<br>
of the albumin molecule, for the most part the albumin molecules are trapped in the pores, which<br>
particularly with macroporous activated charcoals can result in a high loss of albumin.<br>
The test batches Al and A2 show that this problem can be solved by creating narrower<br>
mean channel widths, for example by using particles with a smaller mean diameter in a powder.<br>
The results further confirm that the arrangement of the adsorption material plays an essential role<br>
in the effectiveness of removal of stabilizers, which cannot automatically be achieved by the<br>
choice of adsorber alone.<br>
In the method of the invention, on the other hand, an adsorption material is used which<br>
has channels which are dimensioned to match the albumin molecule. The whole length of these<br>
channels can be transited by the albumin molecule and are dimensioned so that the albumin<br>
molecules come into very frequent and close contact with the surface of the adsorption material.<br>
The channels are characterized by their mean internal width or their mean diameter.<br>
Example 2: Suspensions of activated charcoal particles in fluidized bed reactors:<br>
In order to demonstrate that it is not enlarging the external surface of the activated<br>
charcoal by the grinding method but the adjusting the channels between the particles by the<br>
material to optimized mean channel diameters which is responsible for the success of the<br>
invention, in a further experiment adsorption materials with the same external surface area were<br>
examined with only the channel width being varied. The appropriate experimental vehicle in this<br>
case was the fluidized bed, in which fine particulate adsorption material is held in suspension by<br>
stirring, vibrating or convective or turbulent streaming.<br>
In the fluidized bed, the spaces formed between the evenly distributed particles in the<br>
suspension form channels for the flow of the albumin. The channel diameter in the fluidized bed<br>
can be given to a good approximation using the following formula (II):<br>
Dk    _[VWB 0.33   -(n0.33 * DP )]/N0. 33	(II)<br><br>
wherein DK is the mean channel diameter between the particles, Dp the mean diameter of the<br>
particle itself, n is the number of particles and VWB is the volume of the fluidized bed.<br>
The volume of the fluidized bed for a desired mean channel diameter is given by solving<br>
formula (II) for volume by using the following formula (IIa):<br><br>
17<br>
VWB = [(n033 * Dp) + (n033 * DK)]3	(IIa)<br>
To determine the channel diameter, then, only the volume of the fluidized bed, the<br>
particle number and the particle size have to be batch so that the desired channel diameter can be<br>
obtained. The mean particle diameter Dp and also the bulk density required to estimate the<br>
number of particles in the mass are either given by the manufacturer or can be determined using<br>
simple standard procedures.<br>
The number of particles n in a dry powder can for practical purposes be determined by<br>
the bulk density (packed) and the particle size using the following formula (III):<br>
n=[VTS033/(0.86*DP)]3	(III)<br>
wherein n is the number of particles in a dry powder volume, VTS is the volume of the packed<br>
dry powder and Dp is the mean particle diameter. If the dry powder density is given for a<br>
particular adsorption material, the volume VTS can also be calculated by dividing the weight by<br>
the dry powder density.<br>
Since in practice the particles are not always ideally spherical and also frequently not<br>
always the same size, for particles with a broad size distribution it must in practice be assumed<br>
that the distribution of spaces in a suspension in the adsorber fluidized bed is dependent on the<br>
size distribution of the adsorber particles. As a rule, particularly with powdered adsorbers (for<br>
example with Norit C Extra USP), the characterizing numbers of the particle distribution are<br>
given, i.e. the percentiles in the size distribution e.g. D10 and D90. Using the D10 and D90<br>
values, a size distribution range can be described which encompasses about 80% of the particles.<br>
Thus, the volume in which a defined weight or dry powder volume can be distributed in a<br>
fluidized bed can be estimated in a practical manner, to produce the desired channel diameter to<br>
a good approximation.<br>
In this case, the calculations of the fluidized bed volume can be carried out using the D10<br>
value instead of Dp and then the D90 value instead of Dp, in order to determine the upper and<br>
lower limits of the fluidized bed volume in which the separation in accordance with the invention<br>
between the adsorber particles (channel width) is optimized in accordance with the invention.<br>
The calculation on the basis of the D90 value will result in a maximum variation for which it is<br>
possible to de-ligand with effective raising of the albumin binding capacity (ABiC) with<br>
certainty.<br><br>
18<br>
The influence of channel width was determined as follows. Different volumes of an<br>
activated charcoal-albumin mixture of 1 g of activated charcoal/1 g of albumin (activated<br>
charcoal: Norit C Extra USP from Norit Nederland BV, Netherlands; commercial albumin,<br>
stabilized with 5.2 mmole of octanoate and 5.2 mmol of N-acetyl tryptophanate per mmol<br>
albumin) were added to a fluidized bed in a NaCl solution and stirred for 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature. After the treatment period, the activated charcoal particles were separated from the<br>
albumin solution by centrifuging. Next, the albumin, octanoate and N-acetyl tryptophanate<br>
concentrations and the ABiC were measured and observed in relation to the channel widths<br>
obtained. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>

•	n50, nlO, n90 = particle size, calculated using formula (III) using the d50, D10 or D90<br>

•	NAC/Alb = molar ratio of N-acetyl tryptophan to albumin.<br>
The results clearly show that an increase in the mean channel diameter (DK50) in the<br>
fluidized bed, which stands in a direct relationship with the increase in the fluidized bed volume<br>
in the above formula (II) for a constant particle type and number, independently of the exterior<br>
surface area of the adsorption material leads to a decrease in the effectivity of the depletion of<br>
octanoate and N-acetyl tryptophan and the resulting albumin binding capacity.<br>
Similarly, the table shows that using the rule for a preferred implementation of the<br>
invention:<br>
dm [μm] 14 [μm/min] 
 <br>
19<br>
an optimal depletion is then attained within 30 minutes when the channel width is selected so<br>
that the upper limit for the minimum required contact time is less than 30 minutes (test 1). In<br>
this case the upper limit for the minimum necessary contact time, relative to the mean channel<br>
diameter of 5.2 μm, is 17.3 min, whereas a maximum depletion of NAC and octanoic acid occurs<br>
and the ABiC reaches a value of 110%. In tests 2 to 6, this upper value for the minimum contact<br>
time was not exceeded. Thus, very good depletions and improved ABiCs were observed, but the<br>
optimum value of test 1 was not achieved.<br>
Examples 1 and 2 show that the contact time required between the albumin solution and<br>
the adsorption material for effective stabilizer depletion is strongly dependent on the mean<br>
diameter of the channels in the adsorption material. By matching the mean diameter of the<br>
channels in the adsorption material, the required contact times can be influenced and also, for<br>
example, the throughput rate of the albumin solution in a column packed with adsorption<br>
material can be influenced.<br>
Example 3: Fixing adsorbers in textiles, open-celled foams or mixed powders<br>
In the embodiment described below, the inventive distances between the adsorber<br>
particles, i.e. the channel widths, were "fixed" in a network which could be perused.<br>
The particles of adsorption materials, for example activated charcoal, can thus be made<br>
into the form of a solid bed reactor using support textiles (for example polymer fibers), open-<br>
pored polymer foam structures (for example open-celled polyurethane foam) or simply by<br>
mixing highly porous particles as the "spacers", which provides a sufficient spacing for the<br>
adsorption material particles from each other and thus provides the channel width batch by the<br>
invention. On fixing in highly porous, open-celled polymer foams, it is also possible at the same<br>
time or subsequently, to make channels, for example by drilling procedures. These channel<br>
widths also satisfy the rule which defines the relationship between the channel width and the<br>
minimum necessary contact time, in accordance with the invention.<br>
Advantageously, in this embodiment a "loose" packing is obtained using textile or<br>
support polymer which causes relatively little perfusion back pressure on the highly viscous<br>
albumin solutions. In addition, the filtration requirements to retain micro particles does not to be<br>
as great as in the embodiments described above.<br>
Again, when fixing adsorbers in textiles, open-celled foams or mixed powders, the mean<br>
channel diameter is given by formula (IV) to a close approximation:<br>
DK = [V0.33-(n0.33*Dp)]/n0.33	(IV)<br><br>
20<br>
wherein Do is the mean channel diameter between the particles, Dp is the mean diameter of the<br>
particle itself, n is the number of particles and V is the volume of the textile, mixed powder or<br>
foam in the final state. A desired channel diameter can be determined, for a known particle<br>
number and known particle diameter, by calculating the appropriate volume using formula IV:<br>
V = [(n033 *Dp) + (n033*DK)]3	(IVa)<br>
The bases of calculation for the advantageous combination of adsorber weight and end<br>
volume correspond to the bases of calculation of Example 2.<br>
In an experiment, 2 g of activated charcoal (Norit C Extra USP from NORIT Nederland<br>
BV, Netherlands) with a mean particle size of 23 μm (D50) (D10 = 5 μm, D90 = 82 μm) was<br>
mixed in an aqueous suspension/solution formed from a fibrous polymer (in this case cellulose)<br>
and a polymer with a tendency to cross-link (for example resins, polyurethane,<br>
polyacrylmethacrylates, etc), wherein the channel width was set to 3.6 urn, to achieve<br>
appropriate deligandisation in less than 12 minutes of contact time. According to the formula of<br>
the invention:<br>
dm [μm] / 4 [μm/min] 
the upper limit of the minimum contact time is 12 minutes. Using formula (IVa), for a weight of<br>
2 g a volume of 12.5 ml, was given which corresponded to the final total volume of the mixture.<br>
The mixture was added to a close mesh net with a surface area of about 25 cm2 with pores which<br>
were small enough not to allow adsorber particles and cross-linked support polymers to pass (for<br>
example 5 μm mesh). The mixture was distributed on the net so that after draining though a<br>
pressure gradient (1 atm) a dry thickness of 5 mm was achieved. The adsorption material<br>
produced had an end volume of 12.5 ml in total. The mean channel diameter Dk, calculated<br>
using formula (IV) above and using a particle size d50 of 23 μm, was 3.6 μm.<br>
10 ml of a 20% commercial stabilized albumin solution was fed through the adsorption<br>
material at a rate of 1 ml/min perpendicular to the surface of the net in a commercial filtration<br>
apparatus in the same flow direction as that of the pressure gradient on drying. The albumin<br>
binding capacity of the treated albumin solution had increased from 45% to over 100% by<br>
removal of stabilizers within 10 minutes using this process. The ratio of octanoate and N-acetyl<br>
tryptophanoate to albumin was less than 0.2 mmol/mmol.<br>
Example 4: Clinical application<br><br>
21<br>
In clinical trials, the effects of the albumin solutions of the invention with an increased<br>
albumin binding capacity were investigated. A prospective randomized population of 30 patients<br>
with liver failure from chronic ethyltoxic cirrhosis and superimposed hepatitis C2 with a<br>
bilirubin level of over 20 mg/dl and limited protein synthesis (raised INR) with hypotonic and<br>
hyperdynamic circulation were divided into 2 groups. One group was treated with the albumin<br>
solution with an increased albumin binding capacity of the invention and the control group was<br>
not. Circulation parameters and final organ functions of the kidney and brain were regularly<br>
monitored during the duration of the test and the observation time of 2 weeks.<br>
The results are shown in the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1	shows the albumin concentration in the blood of the two test groups before<br>
therapy and after two weeks;<br>
Figure 2	shows the albumin binding capacity of the albumin in blood from both test<br>
groups before therapy and after two weeks;<br>
Figure 3	shows the change in the mean arterial pressure of both test groups before<br>
therapy and after two weeks;<br>
Figures 4, 5, 6 show the systolic blood pressure, the diastolic blood pressure and the heart<br>
rates of both test groups before therapy and after two weeks;<br>
Figure 7	shows the effect on kidney function, measured for creatinin, of both test<br>
groups before therapy and after two weeks;<br>
Figure 8	shows the effect on hepatic encephalopathy, which is a result of toxins<br>
which limit blood to the brain and seek albumin and of changes in blood flow, of both test<br>
groups before therapy and after two weeks.<br>
The results of the clinical tests show that an improvement in the albumin binding<br>
capacity (ABiC) is associated with an improvement in mean arterial pressure, which clearly is<br>
brought about by an increase in the diastolic blood pressure than by an increase in heart rate.<br>
This medically indicates a reduced vasodilation which in liver disease is often the effect of<br>
vasodilatory substances with an affinity for albumin. Immobilizing them with improved albumin<br>
binding thus improves the circulation, kidney and brain function. Finally, improved binding of<br>
directly neurotoxic substances, which substances also bind to albumin with an improved ABiC<br>
can also occur in addition to the improved blood pressure situation.<br><br>
