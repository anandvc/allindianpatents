				<td>A METHOD AND A. DEVICE FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC MEASUREMENT OF THICKNESS AND ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates primarily to non-contact measurement of dimensions and properties such as,  for example,  resistivity of an object. The invention relates specifically to non-contact measurement that utilizes electromagnetic induction and measures on electrically conductive but substantially non-magnetic objects such as, for example, metal products.<br>
One particular field of application is thickness measurement in the manufacture of metal sheets, metal strip, etc., and, for example, where it is necessary to continuously measure the thickness of the sheet to be able to increase the final quality of the sheet or strip.<br>
The invention may also be used for measuring non-metallic, but electrically conductive, objects.<br>
The invention is especially suited for non-contact and simultaneous measurement of thickness and electrical proper­ties of a thin metallic and non-magnetic material.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Measurement of dimensions and properties of metal products is of vital importance in the metal industry of today. To be able to control the end products to the desired quality in the manufacturing processes, it is of great importance for the continuous measurement of certain quantities to be correct, arid reliable. This particularly applies to the manu­facture of sheet or strip where, for example, the thickness is of vital significance. The technique that is used today .is normally based on light or. radiation or mechanical con­tact .<br>
One such known method for non-contact measurement of the thickness of a sheet is to irradiate it with radioactive radiation or with X-ray radiation and then measure the ra­diation absorption of the sheet. This absorption is depen­dent on, among other things, the thickness of the sheet and hence constitutes a primary measured value of the thickness of the object to be measured. The measured value is, how­ever, influenced by the material composition of the object to be measux~ed, so the accuracy of measurement is not suffi­ciently good.<br>
Known techniques are also sensitive to disturbances from the surrounding environment and are difficult to use when a high material quality is aimed at. A new fundamental measurement technology, which does not possess these deficiencies, is therefore desirable.<br>
One such technique is inductive measurement technique. This has long been proposed as a possible measurement, technique for measuring dimensions and properties of metals. The oldest, patents in the field date back as early as 1920. However, this technique has met with limited success and it was not industrially accepted until the technique was further developed.<br>
The measurement of, for example, thickness proved to be too dependent on material. With the technique disclosed, for example, in US 5,059,902 and SE 517293, industrially successful measuring equipment could suddenly be designed, manufactured and used. These various types of measuring equipment have proved to work well and to be without the deficiencies from which the prior art measurement technique suffered.<br>
However, also this new technique has proved to involve cer­tain drawbacks. One disadvantage is, for example, that it lias not been possible to use it for measurement on really r.hin sheets with thicknesses down to about 0.1 mm for copper and aluminium, that is, metal foil, and for somewhat larger<br>
thicknesses for metals with higher electrical resistivity. This is a significant drawback since an industrial measure­ment technique of this kind should be generally applicable and capable of being used for measuring on objects/sheets of all available thicknesses so as to avoid the need of in­stalling and using several different types of measuring equipment.<br>
With further developed technique,  it has been found to be possible, using electromagnetic technique, to measure also really thin sheets. One problem when measuring .on very thin sheets, such as metal foils, is that the time of penetration of the magnetic fields, that is, the time it takes for a field change to penetrate through an object to be measured and be detected on the other side,  is very short and hence in practice difficult to measure reliably using current technology. The reason for this is that the time of penetra­tion is so short that it may be easily disturbed by other delays in the measuring system. For example, a certain delay in the electronic components of the measuring device itself always occurs.<br>
OBJECTS AMD MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INVENTION<br>
One problem with the prior art is that the delay that arises when measurement is carried out in an electric/electronic system is not only dependent on the actual time of penetra­tion but is also influenced by delays in the various elec­tronic circuits and components of the measuring equipment. When the time of penetration is long, as for thicker sheets, this "electronic time delay" constitutes no decisive prob­lem, since it is considerably shorter than the time of pene­tration. When the time of penetration is very short, for example for thin materials, a problem arises in that the electronic time delay becomes as long as, or longer than, the time of" penetration of the field change in the object to be measured, che sheet. To be able to measure with suffi­cient accuracy, the electronic delay time must be known and a technique for handling this must be created. This is of<br>
decisive importance for permitting measurement on thin sheets.<br>
Also when using the measurement technique according to US 5,059,902 and SE 517293, a problem exists, when the highest accuracy is desired,  in connection with delays in electronic circuits,<br>
It is an object of the present invention to solve the above-mentioned problems and to suggest a measuring device which, with high accuracy,  is capable of determining the thickness of a metallic object to be measured.<br>
Another object of the invention is to solve, in all essen­tials, the measurement problem of being able to measure also thin sheet with the same type of equipment as is used in, for example,  SE 517293. In case of very thin sheets, the problem of correctly calculating the time of penetration arises,  in that delays in the electronics necessary for measurement are of the same order of magnitude as this time of penetration and that these two times cannot be separated.<br>
This problem is solved, according to the invention, by the following method steps:<br>
placing a control coil 5 near the transmitter coil 3,<br>
generating a change in the magnetic field of the trans­<br>
mitter coil 3,<br>
detecting the field change in the control coil 5,<br>
detecting the field change in the receiver coil 4,<br>
determining the difference in time for detecting the<br>
field change in the control coil 5 and in the receiver<br>
coil 4, respectively,<br>
determining the time of penetration T2 through the<br>
object 2 to be measured, and<br>
determining therefrom the thickness or electrical con­<br>
ductivity of the object 2 to be measured.<br>
The invention also relates to a device for non-contact de­termination of one or more sought properties of an object 2<br>
to be measured, such as its geometrical dimension or elec­trical conductivity, comprising at least one transmitter coil 3 and at least one receiver coil 4 located in spaced relationship to each other, as well as means for generating a changeable magnetic field in the transmitter coil 3 and means for detecting a voltage S4 induced in the receiver coil 4.<br>
The measuring device comprises arranging a control coil 5 to detect a change of the magnetic field generated in the transmitter coil 3,<br>
arranging means to detect the difference in time<br>
between the signals S5 and S4 from the control coil 5<br>
and the receiver coil 4 which are generated by the<br>
change of magnetic field in the transmitter coil 3,<br>
arranging means IS, 19 to detect the maximum voltage<br>
S4max induced in the receiver coil 4, and<br>
arranging means to calculate, from thee values, the<br>
thickness or electrical conductivity of the object to<br>
be measured 2.<br>
The new technique thus implies that receiver and transmitter coils are located on opposite sides of the object to be measured and that the measuring device measures, as a basic quantity, the time it takes for the sudden field change, ge­nerated by the transmitter coil,  to penetrate through the sheet and induce a voltage in the receiver coil, the so-called time of penetration.<br>
The invention is particularly suitable to use in those cases where the field change is created by a step-by-step change of the supply current to the transmitter coil, for example a sudden cut-off of the supply current. In this context, time delay in the system is easily measurable as the time that, elapses from che current cut-off until a change is detected in the measurement. This time delay is measured both in the receiver' coil and in an extra control coil placed in the vicinity of the transmitter coil and the difference in time<br>
in these two cases is a measure of the time of penetration of the field through the object to be measured.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 is a sketch showing the principle of a measuring device 1 according to the invention. An object to be measu­red, here a sheet 2, is placed between a transmitter coil 3 and a receiver coil 4. The transmitter coil 3 is fed with a time-varied current, i,  from a current-supply circuit 1. This time-varied current i is controlled from a time-control circuit 8 with a control signal Scl. The circuits 1 and 8 are arranged such that the intended time variation of the supply current i is obtained.<br>
The time-varying current gives rise to a similarly time-varied magnetic field around the transmitter coil 3. The receiver coil 4, on the other side of the sheet 2, detects the changes in the magnetic field penetrating through the<br>
sheet 2 by inducing a voltage, proportional to the change, in the receiver coil 4.<br>
The time it takes for a field change to penetrate through the sheet 2 is a primary measured value that is needed to calculate the sought properties of the sheet 2, for example thickness and the electrical conductivity.<br>
In the vicinity of the transmitter coil 3, preferably imme­diately outside the transmitter coil (3) in relation to the object (2) to be measured, and thus on the same side of the object (2) to be measured, a control coil 5 is placed, which detects any field changes in the vicinity of the transmitter coil 3. The induced voltage, the output signal S5, from this control coil 5 is filtered in a filter circuit 6 in such a way that its voltage level is essentially the same as that of the voltage out of the receiver coil 4. The control coil may advantageously be placed directly at the transmitter coil (3) .<br>
The two signals S4 and S6,  from the receiver coil 4 and from the filter circuit 6, are compared in a comparison circuit 7, a time comparison. The two signals S4 and S6 are thus compared here in order to detect any time displacement be­tween them, the so-called time delay. As a timely starting-point for this measurement, a control signal Sc2 from the time-control circuit 8 is used, which is derived from the same time-control circuit 8 as the control signal Scl for the supply current i. The timely starting-point for the timely comparison of the signals S4 and S6 will thus coin­cide with the timely starting-point for the change of supply current i to the transmitter coil 3.<br>
In the comparison circuit 7,  an unwanted delay time Tf is determined, which is dependent on delays in the electronics components. This delay time and the signal from the receiver coil are led to a calculating circuit where the thickness and/or electrical conductivity are/is calculated, taking into account unwanted delays in the circuits/the system.<br>
The time delay in a measuring device,  for example according to Figure 1, may arise for several reasons. This is exempli­fied in the diagrams according to Figures 2A-C. In this case, a current is illustrated which varies in time by suddenly going from one value to another (see Figure 2A) ,  in this case from a constant value down to zero. The diagram shows the current i, that is, the current that comes from the current- supply circuit 1 in Figure 1. At a certain time, the start time tl, the current-supply circuit 8 cuts off the current supply to the transmitter coil 3, but because of delays in the current-supply circuit 1, another shoz't period of time Tl elapses until the current is really cut off. Typically, it may be a question of 20 ns.<br>
The field change that occurs due to the current change being delayed and measured in the receiver coil 4 is shown in Figure 2B. This delay is composed and consists of: a delay in the transmitter coil 3, T3; a delay from the receiver coil 4, T4; and a delay from the object to be measured, the sheet 2, T2. A change of the magnetic field and thus an in­duced voltage is obtained at a time t4.<br>
The diagram according to Figure 2C shows the delays in the circuit that comprises the control coil 5 and the filter' circuit 6. If it is assumed that the filter circuit 6 itself does not contribute a delay, the total delay in this circuit will be the delay in the transmitter coil 3, T3, and the delay in the control coil 5, T5. An induced voltage arises here at a time t5. The receiver coil 4 and the control coil 5 are designed with the same time constant, so the sought delay time is obtained by detecting/measuring in the compa­rison circuit 7 the difference between the delays in the two signal circuits. The unwanted delay, the delay that is asso­ciated with delays in coils, and other electronics compo­nents, is equal to the delay that is measured in the signal S5, that is, Tf.<br>
The time comparison in the comparison circuit 7 and the cal­culation in the calculating circuit 9, according to B'igure<br>
1, may be carried out in one single calculating circuit according to the principles described in connection with Figure 1 and Figure 2.<br>
The elementary sketch according to Figure 1 illustrates a case where the signal S4 is led direct from the receiver coil 4 to the comparison circuit 7. In certain measurement cases, however, it is required that the signal be amplified in amplifier circuits before it can be handled by the com­parison circuit. Delays in these amplifier circuits will then be included in the delay time T4 of the receiver.  In these cases, corresponding amplifier circuits are used for handling the signal S6 and also T5 is influenced in a corre­sponding way.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,  shown in Figure 3, the transmitter coil 3 is fed from a constant current source 10 via a transistor 11. The transistor 11 is controlled by a control circuit 8 in such a way that the transistor 11 is first open and carries current for a period of time sufficiently long for the magnetic field from the transmitter coil 3 to have time to penetrate through the sheet 2. Thereafter, the current supply is cut off.<br>
The field change, which is a direct consequence of this sudden cut-off, penetrates through the sheet 2 and induces a voltage in the receiver coil 4. At the same time, the sudden field change in the transmitter coil 3 induces an induced voltage S5 in the control coil 5. This voltage S5 is filte­red in a passive filter 6, consisting of a resistor 12 and a capacitance 13. The output signal So from this passive fil­ter 6 and the output signal S4 from the receiver coil 4 are treated alternately, every other time the transistor 11 switches off the current, in that an analog switch 14 in the comparison circuit 7 alternately selects the signal S4 from the receiver coil 4 and the signal S6 from the filter 6, which is really the signal S5 from the control coil 5. The control of the switch 14 takes place via a control signal Sc21 from the control circuit 8.<br>
In the comparison circuit 7,  the signals are led alternately from the switch 14 to an integrator 15 that starts integra­ting when the transistor 11 switches off the current.  The output signal S15 from the integrator 15 is then led to two so-called Sample and Hold circuits  (S/H circuits)  16,  17, which are also controlled by the control circuit 8 via the control signals Sc22 and Sc23. These control signals are so adapted that two values of the signal S15 are retained at two different times in the two S/H circuits.<br>
By selecting holding times for the S/H circuits 16,  17 which lie relatively close to the time after the field change has penetrated through the sheet 2 - one of these holding times lying at a time t!6 relatively close to the time after the field change has penetrated through,  and the other holding time lying at a time t!7 thereafter - the unwanted delay time Tf may be calculated in a simple manner, when the sig­nal S6 of the control coil is connected, as:<br>
Tf = t!6-S16 x (t!7-t!6)/ (S17-S16)-tl<br>
Then,  when the signal from the measuring coil S4 is connec­ted,  the actual time of penetration for the change in the sheet T2 may be calculated from:<br>
P2= t!6-S16 x (t!7-t!6)/ (S17-S16)~tl-Tf<br>
The   above   calculations   are   carried  out   in   a   calculating circuit   9 .<br>
An   additional    embodiment   of   the   invention   is    shown   in   Figure 4.     In   this   case,    two   identical   sets   of   circuits   are   arranged on   respective   sides   of  the  object   2   to be measured,    in  the following   called  a-   and b-sides.    The   control   circuit    8   is, however,     common  to both  circuits   and  controls   the   entire measuring  device.<br>
Current   from  a   constant   current   source   lOa   is   supplied via    a transistor   lla  to   a  transmitter   coil   3a.    At   the   stage   de-<br>
scribed here, the transistor lla is active, that is, it carries current, arid the transistor lib is passive, that is, it is cut off and not current-carrying. After supplying con­stant current for a certain period of time,  the transistor lla is suddenly switched off by the output signal from the control circuit 8 adopting a low level. After the current-supply to the transmitter coil 3a has been cut off, the vol­tage induced in the receiver coil 4b on the other side of the object to be measured, the sheet 2, is detected. This is done by the analog switch 14b passing the signal S4b from the receiver coil 4b to the integrator 15b, where it is in­tegrated. The resultant output signal S15b from the integra­tor 15b is then passed to the inputs of the two S/H circuits 16b, 17b, and the time for the change t4ba is then calcula­ted from the values of the output signals Sloba, SIVba. In the same way, for the a-side, the time t5aa for change is at the same time calculated in the sensing coil 4a from the signals S16aa and S17aa.<br>
After the a-side or the a-circuit has generated the magnetic field, that: is, has been a current-generating side, the con­trol is switched to the b-side or the b-circuit and the pro­cess as above is repeated. The times for change are now cal­culated in a corresponding way from the signals SI Gab, S17ab, S16bb, SIVbb as t4ab and t5bb.<br>
Finally,  the actual delay time FTv for the penetration of the magnetic field through the object 2 to be measured, the delay time through the object to be measured, that is, com­pensated for delays in electronics and coils,  is obtained from the following relationship:<br>
T2 = (t4ba+t4ab-t5aa-t5bb) /2<br>
Where:<br>
t4ba=t!6-S16ba*(t!7-t!6)/(S17ba-S16ba) t4ab=tlo-S16ab*(t!7-t!6)/(S17ab-S16ab) t5aa=t!6-S16aa*(t!7-t!6)/(S17aa-S16aa) t4bb=t!6-S16bb* (t!7-t!6)/(S17bb-S16bb)<br>
12<br>
and where t!6 and t!7 are preset times for the sample and hold amplifiers. The calculation as above is carried out in a calculating circuit as the one shown in Figure 3 .<br>
The method according to the invention may,  at least partly, be carried out with the aid of program codes run in a pro­cessor or in a computer, and these program codes may be stored on a computer-readable medium such as a hard disk, a diskette, a CD-ROM, other movable memory, etc.<br>
One important aspect of this invention, which is primarily intended to be used for measuring on thin sheet,  is that the coils described in connection with Figures 1,  3 and 4 may also be used for measuring on thicker sheet by means of any of the inductive techniques which have been described as new. So, coils that are used for measuring thicker" sheet according to SE 517 293 may be given a different use, for example according to Figure 4, by changing,  depending on sheet thickness, the feeding to transmitter1 co:Lls and the connection of receiver coils. In the case of thick sheet, the transmitter coils 3a and 3b (Figure 4) are then fed simultaneously and in opposite directions, while at the same time the two receiver coils 4a and 4b are connected as re­ceiver coils with the aid of switches 14a and 14b&gt;. Then, when the arrangement is to be used for thin sheet,  connec­tion in accordance with the description referring to Figure 4 is selected.<br>
Although the invention has been described above by, means of a few embodiments, the invention is not, of course, limited to these; other embodiments and variants are feasible within the scope of protection of the claims. Thus, it is conceiv­able that the delay times may be calculated using mathema­tical formulae? that are partly different from those shown here,<br>
It is also possible to use the transmitter coil as a control coil in those cases where the transmitter coil is not acti­ve, that is, when the current through the transistor is cut<br>
13<br>
off (see, e.g., Figure 1) . When the transistor is switched off,  the transmitter coil is disengaged from the current supply and may then be used as a control coil or as a receiver coil.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
