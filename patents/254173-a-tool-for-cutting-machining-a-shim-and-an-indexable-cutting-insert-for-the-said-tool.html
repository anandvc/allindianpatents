Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a tool, a cutting insert, a shim and use of the cutting<br>
insert for chip removing machining according to the preambles of the independent claims.<br>
It is difficult to manufacture directly pressed hard metal cutting inserts with<br>
completely planar lower sides or support surfaces. This is due to shape changes during the<br>
sintering process are difficult to predict since these depend on many factors, for example<br>
the manufacturing of punches, the pressing parameters, the powder material, the powder<br>
preparation and the furnace parameters. By having a convex lower side the ends of the<br>
cutting insert lift from the support surface in the holder and vibrational problems are<br>
obtained. However, if the lower side becomes concave, great tensions are obtained at the<br>
lower side at mounting with a screw or a clamp, which the hard metal normally does not<br>
withstand.<br>
A known cutting insert has been provided with protrusions at the corner portions of<br>
the support surface. The number of protrusions is identical to the number of cutting insert<br>
corners, which means that for example the support points of a square cutting insert become<br>
statically indefinite with above-captioned drawbacks as consequences.<br>
The objects and features of the invention<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a tool, a cutting insert, a<br>
shim and use of the cutting insert, which provide exactly defined abutment between the<br>
support points.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a tool, a cutting insert, a<br>
shim and application of the cutting insert, which provide minimized leverage for the<br>
fastening means and thus low tensions in the cutting insert.<br>
The objects of the present invention are realized by means of a tool, a cutting<br>
insert, a shim and use of the cutting insert, which have obtained the features according to<br>
the appended independent claims.<br><br>

Detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
The tool 10 shown in Fig. 1A and IB comprises a holder 11 for turning or<br>
milling, a shim 12 and an indexable cutting insert 13 made from cemented carbide. The<br>
cutting insert 13 and the shim comprise through-holes to be held firmly in a conventional<br>
manner against holder by means of a screw, not shown. Alternatively, a conventional<br>
clamp may be used.<br>
The holder 11 may be a square shank and has a pocket for mounting of the<br>
shim. The pocket comprises at least two projecting shoulders against which the edge<br>
surfaces of the cutting insert can abut.<br>
The shim 12 has a substantially rhombical basic shape and comprises an<br>
imaginary major axis CL1 and an imaginary minor axis CL2. With "rhomb" is here meant<br>
an oblique equilateral parallelogram. The axes or diagonals are perpendicular to each<br>
other. The major axis coincides with the bisectors in the acute-angled corner portions in<br><br>
4<br>
the rhomb while the minor axis coincides with the bisectors in the obtuse-angled corner<br>
portions. The axes coincide with the center of the hole 14 in this embodiment. The shim 12<br>
has a lower side 15, an upper side 16 and edge surfaces 17,18,19 and 20 extending<br>
therebetween. The distance between two adjacent corner portions constitutes an edge<br>
length. The upper side and lower side are substantially parallel in this embodiment. The<br>
upper side 16 comprises a first recess 21 and a second recess 22. The first recess 21<br>
consists of a groove 23, whose main direction is parallel with the minor axis CL2 such that<br>
it breaks through the edge surfaces 18, 20. The groove 23 is bordered by a first wall 24 and<br>
a second wall 25 in the direction of the major axis CL1. The first wall is centrally<br>
intersected by the hole 14 and the second wall 25 is provided approximately halfway in<br>
direction towards a first acute-angled corner portion 26. The second recess 22 is provide in<br>
connection with a second acute-angled corner portion 27 and is limited only in one<br>
direction by a third wall 28, i.e. in direction towards the hole 14. The first recess 21 is<br>
longer than the second recess 22, preferably about twice as long, when the respective<br>
recess is measured along the major axis CL1. The upper side 16 to the side of the recesses<br>
21, 22 remains in the shape of two support surfaces 16A, 16B, which are provided in same<br>
plane. The recesses 21, 22 are intended to constitute clearances for protrusions 29 provided<br>
on the lower side of the cutting insert 13. Each recess 21, 22 breaks through at least one<br>
associated edge surface 17, 18, 19, 20. Naturally, the recesses may have another shape than<br>
shown as long as they can be provided spaced from the projections. Thus, the projections<br>
do not come in contact with the recesses during machining.<br>
Figs. 1 A, 1B and 1C show a cutting insert 13 according to the present<br>
invention. The cutting insert 13 comprises an upper side 30 and a lower side 31, which are<br>
connected by edge surfaces 32A, 32B, 32 C and 32D. Cutting edges are developed at least<br>
where the edge surfaces intersect the upper side 30. The cutting insert 13 has a<br>
substantially rhombical basic shape and comprises, in analogy with the shim 12 above, an<br>
imaginary major axis CL3 and an imaginary minor axis CIA The axes or diagonals are<br>
perpendicular to each other. The major axis coincides with the bisectors in the acute-<br>
angled corner portions 34, 35 in the rhomb while the minor axis coincides with the<br>
bisectors in the obtuse-angled corner portions 36, 37. The corner portion is here meant to<br><br>
5<br>
be seen in a top view. The axes coincide with the center of the hole 33 in this embodiment.<br>
The upper side and lower side are in this embodiment substantially parallel. The lower side<br>
31 comprises six protrusions 29, whereof one protrusion has been provided in connection<br>
with each acute-angled corner portion. The three projections depicted 29A in Fig. 1C are<br>
provided to constitute the three support surfaces of the cutting insert during use together<br>
with the shim 12. The other three projections depicted 29B in Fig. 1C are provided to<br>
constitute the three support surfaces of the cutting insert when the cutting insert has been<br>
indexed 180° relative to the shim. Consequently, the projections 29 are provided in sets of<br>
three protrusions, whereof two protrusions have been provided closer to the cutting insert<br>
hole 33 than the protrusion at the acute-angled corner portion. That is, the distance L1 (as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1E) between the protrusion at the acute-angled corner portion, where the<br>
area of engagement of the cutting insert is defined, and the center of the cutting insert is<br>
greater than the distances L2, L3 between the other two projections and the center of the<br>
cutting insert. All protrusions have abutment surfaces, which are provided in or touch a<br>
common plane. Each projection projects from the lower side of the cutting insert a distance<br>
in the magnitude of 0.01 mm - 0.5 mm, preferably 0.05 mm - 0.1 mm.<br>
In Fig. 1E the protrusions 29 A of the cutting insert 13, being active in this<br>
position, are shown as filled, black circles while, in this situation passive, protrusions 29B<br>
are shown as white circles. Other parts of the cutting insert are not shown in Fig. 1E.<br>
Neither are the holes 14 and 33 shown since those are optional. The active support surfaces<br>
16A and 16B of the shim 12 are shown by means of dashed areas while the passive<br>
recesses 21 and 22 are shown as white areas. With "active support surfaces 16A and 16B"<br>
is here meant surfaces, which are intended that to be reached by protrusions of the cutting<br>
insert. The sign "*" in i.a. Fig. 1E depicts the approximate area of engagement of the<br>
cutting insert.<br>
When the cutting insert 13 is mounted against the shim 12 the projections, for<br>
example 29A, will be placed such that the abutment surfaces abut against the support<br>
surfaces 16A, 16B of the shim, as illustrated in Fig. 1E. The projections 29B will then be<br>
received the recesses 21 and 22. Subsequently, a fastening means, not shown, clamps the<br>
cutting insert against the shim. Thereby, a stable abutment between the cutting insert and<br><br>
6<br>
the shim has been obtained at three points. The other three projections 29B are provided to<br>
constitute the three support surfaces of the cutting insert when the cutting insert has been<br>
indexed 180° relative to the shim.<br>
Figs. 2A-2H and Figs. 3A-3K show in analogy with Fig. 1E a number of<br>
alternative embodiments of a lower side of a cutting insert and a shim, all entailing a stable<br>
three point abutment.<br>

two thirds of an edge surface while one recess extends over a corner portion and over two<br>
thirds of an edge surface. The number of protrusions is 10 while the number of recesses is<br>
three.<br>
The use of the indexable cutting insert in the tool for cutting machining<br>
means that the cutting insert 13 is placed such that the projections 29A, 29B are provided<br>
spaced from the recesses 21, 22 and such that the projections do not engage with the<br>
recesses during the machining. The cutting insert then uses only three of all protrusions<br>
provided on the lower side of the cutting insert.<br>
Common for all these embodiments is among other that the cutting insert and<br>
the shim are provided to abut against each other in three points and that the recesses are<br>
provided spaced from the projections when in mounted position. Thereby, exact defined<br>
abutment between the cooperating support surfaces is obtained without resorting to any<br>
grinding. The projections are provided in the vicinity of the corner portions and/or at the<br>
middle of the edge surfaces.<br>
Furthermore, the lever is minimized for the fastening means such that only<br>
small tensions arise in the hard metal. For the pentagonal embodiment and most square<br>
embodiments apply that the distance L1 between the active protrusion at the area of<br>
engagement of the cutting insert and the center of the cutting insert is greater than the<br>
distances L2, L3 between the remaining two active projections and the center of the cutting<br>
insert. For the hexagonal and octagonal embodiments apply that the distances between the<br>
protrusion at the area of engagement of the cutting insert and the center of the cutting<br>
insert are equal to the distances between the remaining two active projections and the<br>
center of the cutting insert.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in connection with<br>
preferred embodiments, it is implicit for the person skilled in the art that combinations,<br>
additions, deletions, modifications, and substitutes not specifically described, can be made<br>
without departing from the scope of the invention, such as it is defined in the appended<br>
claims.<br><br>
