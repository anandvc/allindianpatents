Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for synthesis of 1- aryl -3-aryl / heteroaryl -3-arylthio / heteroarylthio -1-propanones having antifungal activity. This invention particularly relates to synthesis of 1- aryl-3-aryl / heteroaryl-3-arylthio / heteroarylthio-1-propanones having antifungal activity against strains of Candida albicans which are sensitive as well as resistant to the marketed antifungal drug fluconazole.<br>
Background and Prior Art:<br>
Candida albicans is part of the normal flora of the mouth, intestine and vagina. It is also an opportunistic pathogen giving rise to an inflammation under a wide variety of circumstances. Infection is usually, endogenous though cross-infection may occur, as between infants in a nursery.<br>
The site affected by Candida albicans is mucosa. Less common manifestations are the secondary infections in the lower respiratory tract and urinary tract infection. It may cause septicemia with localization in meninges, endocardium, bone marrow or kidney, which may occur in patients seriously ill with other conditions.<br>
The commonest Candida infection is vaginitis or vaginal thrush. Pregnant women are particularly susceptible. Oral thrush occurs in debilitated or bottle fed infants. Infection of the skin is common in diabetes. Intestine infections occur in infants. Bronchial and pulmonary candiasis also occur but not common. Systemic infections may occur when the organism is inoculated into the tissues as in drug addicts. Candida albicans causes candiases on the skin and mucous membranes of the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, nervous system and urogenital organs of the man. Candiases of liver, biliary tract, pancreas and bones also occur. In number of chronic candiases septic cases are characterized by lesions into kidneys lung tissues, liver and other organs. About 90 per cent of the Candida infections in humans are due to Candida albicans.<br><br><br>
A large number of organic compounds used as drugs for the treatment of candiasis. They belong to following classes:<br>
i.  Azoles- fluconazole, clotrimazole, econazole.<br>
ii.  Allylamines and other squalene epoxidease inhinitors-nafitifine, terbinafine, butenafine, tolnaftate.<br>
iii.   Morpholines- amorolphine.<br>
iv.   Nucleosides- flucytosine.<br>
V. Antifungal antibiotics- polyene antibiotics, griseofulvin. However, the effectiveness of these drugs has gone down as certain strains of Candida albicans, have developed resistance to these drugs.<br>
Clinical failure in the treatment of systemic fungal infections is due to the emergence of resistance of the pathogenic fungal species to clinically used antifungal drugs. Resistance to fluconazole is spreading rapidly and has become major problem in late-stage AIDS patients. The development of such resistance is due to multiple mechanisms. Recently, NCIM 3446 a strain of Candida albicans has been found to be resistant to the antifungal drug fluconazole. There is a need to develop a new drug for this strain. The only way to overcome this resistance problem is to synthesize new antifungal compounds to which none of the strains of Candida albicans has ever been exposed. A look at the literature showed that 3-phenyl-1-(2-furyl)-3-phenylthio-1-proanones have been reported to be active against various fungal species like Botrytis cineria, Valsa ceratosperma, Sclerotium cepivorum and Phytophthera capsici. [Sung, Nack-Do.; Kang, Hee-Deog.; Meang, Joo-Yang.; Shin, Dong-Rin. Hanguk Nonghwa Hakhoechj, 1994, 37(4), 287-294]. However, such compounds have not been tried out for activity against Candida albicans.<br>
Object:<br>
The principle object of the present invention is to synthesize new molecules amongst 1- aryl-3-aryl/heteroaryl-3-arylthio / heteroarylthio-1-propanones that will be  effective   in   mitigating   organisms  of strains  of  Candida  albicans  and<br><br><br>
particularly those strains which are sensitive to the antifungal drug fluconazole like ATCC10231, or which are resistant to fluconazole like NCIM 3446. The main part of this object of the present invention is to synthesize and screen various analogues of 1- aryl-3-aryl/heteroaryl-3-arylthio / heteroarylthio-1-propanones for their antifungal activity and evaluate in particular, their in vitro activity against strains of Candida albicans and particularly those strains, which are sensitive, like ATCC10231, or which are resistant, like NCIM 3446, to the antifungal drug fluconazole.

Synthesis of Specific compounds of formula (F-ll):<br>
1,3-diaryl-2-propen-1-ones the compounds of formula (F-ll) are known as propenones or chalcones, henceforth referred as "Chalcones". Since they are not readily available, they are synthesized by conventional aldol condensation of compounds represented by formula (F-lla) and (F-llb) in which the substituents are selected as required for the synthesis of desired compound of formula (F-l). Compounds obtained by this step are not novel.<br><br><br>

Compounds obtained by this step are not novel.<br><br><br>
Chalcones of general formula (F-ll) (for details see Table 2) are prepared in the laboratory by literature methods (further details given in examples A and B) and used directly for the synthesis of novel propanones of formula (F-l). Following two methods for the synthesis of chalcones by aldol condensation are useful.<br>
i.        Base catalyzed [Peter klinke, Heinz Gibian, Chemische berische. 1961,<br>
94, 2638; Chemical abstract no. 72-121124p (Falco da, Fonseca, Luis.<br>
Bol Fac. Farm., Univ. Coimbra, Ed. Client. 1968, 28, 49-52); Chemical<br>
abstract- 72-66551y. (Druzilla.M; Kristian,  P.    Collec.  Czech. Chem.<br>
Commun. 1969, 35 (2), 417-419)] and ii.       Acid catalyzed aldol condensation. (Lyle, R.E.; Paradis.LP. J. Am. Chem.<br>
Soc. 1955, 77, 6667-6668.) In case any desired chalcone is readily available, this step in the synthesis is not required.<br>
Synthesis propanones of formula (F-l)<br>
In the second step a novel compound of the present invention 1- aryl-3-aryl/heteroaryl,-3-arylthio / heteroarylthio,-1-propanones represented by Formula (F-l) is obtained by conventional Michael addition of substituted thiophenol of formula (Fill) to the chalcone (F-ll) both having same substituents as in formula (F-l) which are either readily available or made as said in step 1 of this process.. The addition of substituted thiophenols compounds of formula (F-lll) on to chalcones of general structural formula (F-ll) is carried out in basic medium using bases such as triethylamine, pyridine, alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, in an organic solvent, at ambient temperature. The reaction takes place in 0.5-5 hrs. (K. G. Akamanchi and U .W. Mali. Asian J. Chem. 2001, 49-59; Sharaf, Saber M; El-Sadany, Samir K; Hamed, Ezzat, A.; Elba, Mohammed E. Alexandria J. Pharm. Sci. 1991, 5 (2) 187-191). The products are isolated by extraction in suitable solvent (solvents) and purified by column chromatography over silica gel (60-120mesh) with suitable eluent<br><br><br>
system. These novel compounds are then evaluated for in vitro antifungal activity.<br>
In the process of present invention, for the Michael addition reaction, the preferred basic media were triethylamine and sodium methoxide in toluene and methanol respectively. Details of these procedures are given below. Reaction With Triethylamine As A Base:<br>
The reaction in presence of triethylamine as a base is carried out as follows: 1,3-diaryl-2-propen-1-ones of structural formula (F-ll), compounds of formula (Fill) and triethylamine were taken in the molar ratio (1) : (1.1 - 4) : (1.1 - 4) preferably, (1): (1.1): (1.1) . In three necked round bottom flask equipped with magnetic stirrer, CaCI2 guard tube and nitrogen inlet, a compound of 1,3-diaryl-2-propen-1-ones of general formula (F-ll) (0.01 mole) is taken in suitable organic solvents selected from chlorinated solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, esters such as ethyl acetate and ketones such as methyl isobutyl ketone. Toluene is solvent of choice. To this solution in the reaction flask, are added a compound of compounds of formula (F-lll) (0.011 mole) followed by triethylamine (0.011 mole) and stirred for 2-6 hours. The reaction is monitored by TLC and HPLC. (System for TLC; Ethyl acetate: Hexane:: 05-15: 95-85, by volume and HPLC system; water: Methanol:: 8-20: 92-80 by volume). On completion of the reaction, cold water (25ml) is added to the reaction mixture and product is extracted with suitable organic solvent (3 x 10 ml) selected from chlorinated solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, esters such as ethyl acetate and ketones such as methyl isobutyl ketone. Chloroform is solvent of choice. The product obtained after removing the solvent is further purified by column chromatography over silica gel (60-120mesh) with suitable eluent system such as Hexane and Ethyl acetate in varying proportion; Ethyl acetate : Hexane :: (05-15) : (95-85) by vol., preferably, (5:95) by volume.<br><br><br>
Reaction With Sodium Methoxide As A Base<br>
The reaction in presence of sodium methoxide as a base, is carried out as follows:<br>
A compound of formula (F-lll) is taken in methanol/ ethanol in the three necked round bottom flask equipped with magnetic stirrer, CaCI2 guard tube and nitrogen inlet. To the reaction mixture is added sodium methoxide (NaOCH3) in methanol and after 5 minutes chalcone of general formula (F-ll) is added slowly. Chalcones of general formula (F-ll), compounds of formula (F-lll) and NaOCH3 are taken in the molar ratio (1): (2 - 5): (2 - 5) preferably, 1: 5: 5.<br>
The reaction is stirred at ambient temperature and monitored by TLC and HPLC as in the above method. On completion of the reaction, the solvent is evaporated to dryness and ice-cold water is added to the reaction mixture and the product is extracted with suitable organic solvent selected from chlorinated solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and esters such as ethyl acetate and ketones such as like methyl isobutyl ketone. Chloroform is solvent of choice. The products are purified by column chromatography over silica gel (60-120mesh) with suitable eluent system such as Hexane and Ethyl acetate in varying proportion, Ethyl acetate : Hexane :: (05-15): (95-85) by vol. preferably 5: 95 by vol. The purity of the compounds is established by TLC, IR, NMR and HPLC. (Water: Methanol, 15:85).<br>
In vitro biological evaluation:<br>
The antifungal activity expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the said compounds according to the invention has been determined by broth dilution method (Barrry, A. L.; Leo and Febigar, Philadelphia, 1976, 92-104). Concentration of compounds added was 50-250 µg/ml. The medium used was Saborauds dextrose broth. The inoculum concentration was 5 X 10 15 Colony forming units per ml.<br><br><br>
One loop full of this inoculum was used as inoculate per inoculation point. The results were interpreted after 48 hours incubation in dark conditions at room temperature. Measurement of turbidity by means of photoelectric colorimeter was done for the interpretation of the results. The fungal species used for evaluating the activity of said compounds have been<br>

Example-C In vitro evaluation of biological activity<br>
The evaluation of the synthesized compounds for antifungal activity was carried out using broth dilution method and minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by visual comparison with the negative control tubes. Detailed test procedure<br>
1.	Stock Solutions of test compounds and standard drug-<br>
Compounds prepared in Examples I - XIII were taken as test samples along with a<br>
standard fluconazole sample.<br>
10 mg of each test compound was dissolved in 1 ml of dimethylsulphoxide. (L.R Grade, S.D. Finechem Ltd. Mumbai)<br>
For preparing stock solution of fluconazole, 10 mg of fluconazole (sample Obtained from FDC Ltd., Mumbai) was dissolved in 1 ml of dimethylsulphoxide.<br>
2.	Test organism-<br>
The organisms employed in the in vitro testing of the compounds were Candida albicans ATCC 10231 (fluconazole sensitive) - It was obtained from Haffkine Institute, Parel (Mumbai).<br>
Candida albicans NCIM 3446 (fluconazole resistant) - It was obtained from Food and Fermentation Technology division, UICT, Mumbai.<br>
All the cultures were maintained on Saborauds agar (microbiology grade, Himedia lab. Ltd., Mumbai) medium by periodic subculturing.<br>
3.	Preparation of Inocula-<br>
Procedure for the preparation of inoculum for both the strains was same. The inoculum was prepared from a 24-hours old growth of organism on Saboraud's dextrose agar slant. With the help of sterile nichrome wire loop, the growth of the organism on slant was aseptically transferred to a tube containing sterile distilled water. The contents of the tube were then shaken properly so as to get uniform cell suspension of the organism. Optical density the inoculum was adjusted to 0.4 on the photoelectric colorimeter by using sterile distilled water, before using it as a inoculum.<br><br><br>
4.	Medium-<br>
3 gm of Saboraud's dextrose broth (microbiology grade, Himedia lab. Ltd., Mumbai) was dissolved in 100 ml of sterile distilled water. 2 ml of this stock solution was transferred to each test tube.<br>
5.	Test proper-<br>
To 2 ml of sterile Saboraud's dextrose broth solution was taken in a test tube, 10-40 µl of the stock solution was added followed by a loop full of an authentic culture of Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Candida albicans NCIM 3446 (corresponding to 5 X 10 15CFU/ml.).<br>
This corresponds to concentration range of 50, 100, 150, 200 µg/ml of the test compound. The tests were carried out in duplicate. Apart from putting the controls of standard drug (Fluconazole), controls with dimethyl sulphoxide (positive control) and without dimethyl sulphoxide (negative control) were also included in the test.<br>
6.	Incubation-<br>
The test tubes were put in the dark conditions at room temperature for 48 hours. At the end of incubation period, the results were interpreted by visual comparison with negative control. The lowest concentration of test compound which showed inhibitory effect on growth on visual distinction was taken as Minimum inhibitory concentration. The results are given in Table 3.<br>
