The present invention relates to a foil material for transfer to a target<br>
5substrate, as well as methods for manufacturing such a foil material, as well<br>
as a security element manufacturable with the foil material. The present<br>
invention further relates to a method for transferring a foil material to a<br>
target substrate, a method for manufacturing a security element and a<br>
method for manufacturing a valuable article, such as a security paper or a<br>
value document.<br>
For protection, valuable articles such as branded articles and value<br>
documents are often equipped with security elements that permit the<br>
authenticity of the valuable article to be verified, and that simultaneouslv<br>
serve as protection against unauthorized reproduction.<br>
Optically variable elements that, at different viewing angles, give the viewer<br>
a different image impression, for example a different color impression, are<br>
often used as security elements. Holograms, holographic grid images and<br>
other hologram-like diffraction patterns that present the viewer a viewing-<br>
angle-dependent diffraction pattern are also often used to safeguard<br>
authenticity.<br>
Security elements having hologram-like diffraction patterns are transferred,<br>
for instance in the transfer method, to the target substrate, for example a<br>
banknote. Here, the detachment of the security element from the substrate<br>
foil occurs either through so-called separation or release layers, which for the<br>
most part are thermally activatible, or through the low adhesion of the<br>
security element to the substrate foil. Furthermore, to facilitate a bond to the<br>
paper, the security element is coated with a suitable adhesive system. Other<br>
 security features, such as glossy pigments or other optically variable effect<br><br><br>
inks, in contrast, are, for the most part, imprinted directly on a paper<br>
substrate.<br>
From publication EP 0 435 029 A2 is known a transfer element having a<br>
plastic-like layer comprising a liquid crystal polymer, which layer shows a<br>
marked play of changing colors at room temperature. The transfer element<br>
comprises, in addition to a substrate foil, an optional wax layer, a protective<br>
lacquer layer, a layer comprising a liquid crystal polymer, an ink layer and a<br>
heat adhesive layer.<br><br>
Solution-based liquid crystal lacquers require alignment-promoting<br>
conditions to be able to exhibit their effect. Special alignment layers are<br>
typically used for this purpose. In particular, alignment layers are used that<br>
comprise a linear photopolymer that is exposed to a suitable radiation for<br>
alignment. Furthermore, liquid crystal materials can also be aligned with the<br>
aid of alignment layers that are provided by a finely structured layer or a<br>
layer aligned by the application of shear forces. The alignment of the liquid<br>
crystal materials on such alignment layers is complex due to the additional<br>
work steps normally required for this.<br><br>
Based on that, the object of the present invention is to specify a foil material<br>
and a method for its manufacture that avoids the_disadvantages of the<br>
background art.<br>
This object is solved by the features of the independent claims.<br>
Developments of the present invention are the subject of the dependent<br>
claims.<br>
According to the present invention, the liquid crystal material is prepared on<br>
a plastic substrate foil. Due to its interior structure, the plastic substrate foil<br><br>
has a preferred direction that is sufficient to align the liquid crystal material<br>
in the desired form. In particular, plastic foils that exhibit a surface pattern<br>
created upon manufacture are suitable. Examples of such plastic substrate<br>
foils that are suitable for aligning liquid crystal material include PET, PE,<br>
BOPP and OPP foils, and cellulose triacetate.<br>
The liquid crystal material can thus be applied directly to, preferably<br>
imprinted on, the plastic substrate foil, without further alignment layers.<br>
According to the present invention, the liquid crystal material is applied<br>
discontiguously. Here, the liquid crystal layer is preferably applied in the<br>
form of patterns, characters or codes.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a functional layer is applied contiguously to the<br>
liquid crystal layer and, in the exposed areas, correspondingly to the<br>
substrate foil. Through the use of a functional layer, also security elements<br>
comprising liquid crystal material that are not contiguously present, for<br>
example printed as a motif, can be transferred to a target substrate. If desired<br>
or necessary, the substrate foil for the liquid crystal layer and the functional layer<br>
can be removed upon or following the application of the foil material to the target<br>
substrate. To ensure the damageless detachability of the substrate foil of a foil<br>
material formed as a transfer material, the adhesion of the functional layer to<br>
the substrate foil is advantageously less than to the liquid crystal layer.<br>
Furthermore, in a further preferred embodiment, an adhesive layer is<br>
applied for transfer to a target substrate.<br>
In an advantageous development of the present invention, further layers<br>
comprising liquid crystal material can be applied discontiguously, especially<br>
in the form of patterns, characters or codes, between the discontiguously<br>
applied liquid crystal layer and the functional layer. Here, these further<br><br><br>
layers can advantageously overlap at least in part with the first-applied<br>
liquid crystal layer.<br>
The liquid crystal layers are preferably applied, preferably imprinted, as a<br>
lacquer layer comprising nematic, cholesteric or smectic liquid crystal<br>
material. Here, especially intaglio printing, screen printing, flexo printing,<br>
knife coating or curtain coating are appropriate as printing techniques for the<br>
liquid crystal layers and/or the functional layer.<br>
As the functional layer, preferably a UV-curing lacquer layer is applied,<br>
especially imprinted. The UV-curing lacquer layer expediently includes<br>
photoinitiators. In individual cases, especially in manufacturing a transfer<br>
material, a trade-off must be sought each time between sufficiently high<br>
adhesion of the functional layer to the liquid crystal layer to be detached<br>
and sufficiently low adhesion to the substrate foil.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, a layer comprising cholesteric liquid<br>
crystal material is applied, especially imprinted, as the functional layer. Also<br>
an embossing lacquer layer can advantageously be used as the functional<br>
ayer. In this case, the embossing lacquer layer is expediently imprinted and<br>
thereafter embossed, provided with a reflective layer, especially a metal<br>
layer, and if applicable, demetallized in some areas to introduce, for<br>
example, an inverse lettering into the metallized embossing pattern. The<br>
embossing pattern advantageously forms an optically effective<br>
microstructure, especially a diffraction pattern, a matte pattern, an<br>
arrangement comprising microlenses or an arrangement comprising<br>
micromirrors.<br>
To achieve better adhesion to subsequently applied layers, for example a<br>
subsequently applied embossing lacquer layer, the functional layer can<br><br><br><br><br><br>
advantageously be subjected to a corona treatment or furnished with an<br>
adhesion promoter.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, one or more further layers can be applied<br>
to, especially imprinted on, the functional layer to produce more complex<br>
layer structures. Preferably, an embossing lacquer layer can be applied,<br>
especially imprinted, as a further layer. Following application, the embossing<br>
lacquer layer is advantageously embossed, metallized and, if applicable,<br>
demetallized in some areas.<br><br>
A machine-readable and/or decorative layer that is applied at least in some<br>
areas, especially in the form of patterns, characters or codes, can also be used<br>
as a further layer. For example, the machine-readable and/ or decorative<br>
layer can be imprinted with a printing ink on the functional layer or a further<br>
layer that has already been applied thereto.<br>
A reflective layer can likewise be applied as a further layer. In all<br>
variations having a reflective layer, this layer can also be formed by a<br>
reflective thin-film element. Such a thin-film element is preferably formed<br>
having a reflection layer, an absorber layer and a dielectric spacing layer<br>
disposed between the reflection layer and the absorber layer.<br>
In an advantageous development of the present invention, in addition to the<br>
layered composite already described, one or more further layered<br>
composites are manufactured and joined together, for example via<br>
laminating lacquer layers. In this way, it is possible to realize diverse and<br>
complex security layer structures that facilitate a layer sequence that is often<br>
not realizable in known multilayer security elements and that enhance the<br>
effects of the security element. For the individual layered composites,<br>
optimal manufacturing conditions can be chosen in each case due to separate<br><br>
manufacture. In this way, according to the present invention, it is also<br>
possible to combine layered composites that require mutually exclusive<br>
manufacturing conditions or mutually interfering substrate foils, since the<br>
substrate foils can be removed upon or following the joining of the sub-<br>
 layered composites.<br>
In particular, according to the present invention, a second security layered<br>
composite that is present on a second substrate foil can be provided that is<br>
joined, via a second adhesive layer, with the layered composite comprising a<br>
substrate foil, discontiguous liquid crystal layer and, if applicable, further<br>
layers.<br>
In a first variation of the present invention, the second security layered<br>
composite is manufactured by applying an embossing lacquer layer to the<br>
second substrate foil and embossing, metallizing and, if applicable,<br>
demetallizing the embossing lacquer layer in some areas.<br>
According to another variation of the present invention, the second security<br>
layered composite is manufactured in that a screened metal layer, especially<br>
in the form of patterns, characters or codes, or a semi-transparent metal layer<br>
is applied on the second substrate foil, and in that a machine-readable<br>
and/or decorative layer, especially in the form of patterns, characters or<br>
codes, is manufactured on the metal layer.<br>
The second security layered composite can also comprise a reflective layer. In<br>
all variations, the reflective layer can advantageously be formed by a metal<br>
layer or, in more complex structures, by a reflective thin-film element having<br>
a viewing-angle-dependent color impression. In the latter case, the thin-film<br>
element is preferably formed having a reflection layer, an absorber layer and<br>
a dielectric spacing layer disposed between the reflection layer and the<br><br>
absorber layer. The reflection layer of the thin-film element is preferably<br>
formed from an opaque or semi-transparent metal layer.<br>
The thin-film element can also be formed having at least one absorber layer<br>
and at least one dielectric spacing layer, the absorber layers and the dielectric<br>
spacing layers being alternatingly stacked. According to a further possible<br>
embodiment, the thin-film element is formed having multiple dielectric<br>
spacing layers, adjoining layers being formed having strongly different<br>
refractive indices.<br><br><br><br><br>
According to a further variation of the present invention, the second security<br>
layered composite comprises an optically effective microstructure that is<br>
preferably formed as a diffraction pattern, as a matte pattern, as an<br>
arrangement of microlenses or as an arrangement of micromirrors.<br>
In all variants, a layer that includes machine-readable feature substances,<br>
especially magnetic, electrically conductive, phosphorescent, fluorescent or<br>
other luminescent substances, can be imprinted as a machine-readable<br>
and/ or decorative layer.<br><br>
The present invention also includes a foil material for security elements that<br>
is manufacturable especially according to one of the above-described<br>
manufacturing methods and that includes a security layer sequence having a<br>
plastic substrate foil that is suitable for aligning liquid crystal material, and<br>
having a first discontiguously present layer comprising liquid crystal<br>
material that is present on the plastic substrate foil in aligned form.<br>
Furthermore, the first liquid crystal layer of the foil material is<br>
advantageously formed from a nematic liquid crystal material. The first<br>
liquid crystal layer preferably forms a phase-shifting layer.<br><br><br><br><br>
In an advantageous development of the present invention, at least one<br>
further layer comprising liquid crystal material is present between the<br>
discontiguously applied liquid crystal layer and a contiguously present<br>
functional layer. The at least one further liquid crystal layer is preferably<br>
formed from cholesteric liquid crystal material.<br>
The functional layer preferably comprises a UV-curing lacquer layer.<br>
Alternatively, the functional layer can also be formed from a cholesteric<br>
liquid crystal material.<br><br>
In all variations, the foil material can comprise an adhesive layer for<br>
transferring the security layer sequence to the target substrate.<br>
The present invention also includes a security element for securing valuable<br>
articles, having a discontiguously present layer comprising a liquid crystal<br>
material, especially nematic liquid crystal material, and a contiguously<br>
present functional layer that is disposed immediately above the<br>
discontiguously present layer comprising liquid crystal material. Here, the<br>
functional layer is formed by a UV-curing lacquer layer, a layer formed from<br>
cholesteric liquid crystal material or an embossing lacquer layer.<br>
The security element preferably comprises a plastic substrate foil that is<br>
suitable for aligning liquid crystal material. The functional layer is<br>
preferably formed by an embossing lacquer layer in which an optically<br>
effective microstructure is embossed and that is provided with a reflective<br>
layer, especially a metal layer and, if applicable, demetallized in some<br>
areas.<br><br><br>
The optically effective microstructure can advantageously be formed by a<br>
diffraction pattern, a matte pattern, an arrangement comprising microlenses<br>
or an arrangement comprising micromirrors.<br>
The present invention also comprises a method for transferring a foil<br>
material to a target substrate, in which a foil material of the kind described is<br>
laid with the adhesive layer on the target substrate and joined with the target<br>
substrate by heat and/ or pressure action. When radiation-curing adhesives<br>
are used, the foil material is correspondingly joined with the target substrate<br>
by pressure and radiation action. If the foil material is formed as a transfer<br>
material, the plastic substrate foil of the liquid crystal layer is expediently<br>
removed upon or shortly after the application to the target substrate.<br>
In a method for manufacturing a security element, especially a security<br>
thread or a security element to be applied or transferred, a foil material of the<br>
kind described is manufactured and furnished with further layers for<br>
embedment in or for application to a security paper or a valuable article,<br>
especially a value document. Here, the security element preferably includes<br>
a carrier substrate comprising paper or plastic.<br><br>
In a method for manufacturing a valuable article, such as a security paper or<br>
a value document, a foil material of the kind described is applied to an article<br>
to be secured, especially is affixed by heat and/ or pressure action and/or<br>
radiation action. Here, advantageously, the surface of the security paper or<br>
valuable article can be specially treated to improve the adhesive action of the<br>
foil material on the surface, as well as the optical efficiency of the foil<br>
 material. For this, especially an adhesion promoter can be used that is<br>
applied to the surface of the security paper.<br><br>
Valuable articles within the meaning of the present invention include<br>
especially banknotes, stocks, bonds, certificates, vouchers, checks, valuable<br>
admission tickets and other papers that are at risk of counterfeiting, such as<br>
passports and other identity documents, as well as product protection<br>
elements, such as labels, seals, packaging and the like. In the following, the<br>
term "valuable article" encompasses all such articles, documents and<br>
product protection means. The term "security paper" is understood to be the<br>
not-yet-circulatable precursor to a value document, which precursor can<br>
exhibit, in addition to the security element, further authenticating features,<br>
such as luminescent substances provided in the volume. Security paper is<br>
customarily present in quasi-endless form and is further processed at a later<br>
time.<br>

The invention will now be explained in greater detail using a banknote as an<br>
example. For this, fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a banknote 10 having<br>
two security elements 12 and 16, each of which is manufactured with the aid<br>
of a foil material according to the present invention.<br>
The first security element constitutes a security thread 12 that emerges at<br>
certain window areas 14 on the surface of the banknote 10, while it is<br>
embedded in the interior of the banknote 10 in the areas lying therebetween.<br>
The second security element is formed by a wide security strip 16 that is<br>
affixed to the banknote paper with a heat seal adhesive.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a top view of a sub-area of the security strip 16 as it appears<br>
when viewed without auxiliary means or when viewed through a linear<br>
polarizer 20. Viewed without auxiliary means, the security strip 16 displays<br>
glossy metallic, optically variable diffraction structures 22, such as holograms<br>
or kinegrams. Such diffraction patterns are known to the person skilled in<br>
the art and are thus not further explained in the following. Instead of the<br>
diffraction patterns 22, e.g. matte patterns or refractive patterns can also be<br>
provided.<br>
If the security strip 16 is viewed through a linear polarizer 20, then<br>
additional structures appear, in the exemplary embodiment a honeycomb<br><br><br><br>
pattern 24. Alternatively, the structures can also be made visible with a<br>
circular polarizer. These patterns, which are practically imperceptible with<br>
the naked eye, can be used to check the authenticity of the banknote 10.<br>
The structure and the manufacture of security elements according to the<br>
present invention will first be explained with reference to simpler and then<br>
increasingly more complex security element structures.<br>
Fig. 3 shows, in cross-sectional view, an intermediate step in the manufacture<br>
of a foil material 30 that can be used, for example, in a security thread 12 or a<br>
security strip 16 of the kind shown in fig. 1. For this, a layer 34 comprising<br>
nematic liquid crystal material is imprinted on a transparent substrate foil 32,<br>
for example a smooth plastic foil of good surface quality. The nematic layer<br>
34 is typically imprinted in the form of a motif comprising patterns,<br>
characters or a code, for example in the form of the honeycomb pattern<br>
shown in fig. 2. Due to the surface structure of the substrate foil 32 that<br>
determines a preferred direction for the alignment of the liquid crystal<br>
material, the nematic layer 34 can be imprinted directly on the substrate foil.<br>
On the nematic layer 34 can likewise be imprinted, discontiguously and<br>
overlapping with it at least in some areas, a further layer, not shown here,<br>
comprising liquid crystal material, e.g. comprising cholesteric liquid<br>
crystal material, in the form of a motif.<br>
A functional layer, e.g. a UV-crosslinkable lacquer layer 36, is imprinted<br>
contiguously on the nematic layer 34 and the substrate foil 32. Alternatively,<br>
a layer comprising cholesteric liquid crystal material or an embossing lacquer<br>
layer can also be used as the functional layer 36. To be able, in a later work<br>
step, to transfer, removing the substrate foil 32, the nematic layer 34 that is<br>
present only in some areas and, if applicable, the further layer comprising<br><br><br>
cholesteric liquid crystal material, to a target substrate, such as a security<br>
paper or a value document, the functional layer is preferably formed such<br>
that its adhesion to the substrate foil 32 is less than to the nematic layer 34.<br>
Thereafter is applied to the functional layer 36 an adhesive layer 38 with<br>
which the layered composite comprising the substrate foil 32, nematic layer<br>
34 and functional layer 36 can be laminated onto a target substrate, such as a<br>
security paper, a value document or also a further thread or strip structure<br>
35. If desired or necessary, the substrate foil 32 for the liquid crystal materials<br>
34 and 36 can, in a last step, be removed again by separation winding. The<br>
damageless detachability of the substrate foil 32 is ensured by the greater<br>
adhesion of the functional layer 36 to the nematic layer 34.<br>
However, it is also possible to leave the substrate foil 32 in the layered<br>
composite following the application to the target substrate or the thread or<br>
strip structure. The substrate foil 32 can then serve, for example, as a cover<br>
foil.<br>
In all embodiments, both the functional layer and the adhesive layer can<br>
include machine-readable feature substances, such as magnetic, electrically<br>
conductive, phosphorescent or fluorescent substances.<br>
Prior to the application of the adhesive layer 38, a further layer that is not<br>
shown here can be imprinted on the functional layer 36. The further layer can<br>
especially be provided with gaps or in the form of patterns, characters or<br>
codes. To facilitate good perceptibility of the color and polarization effects of<br>
the nematic or, if applicable, cholesteric liquid crystal layers, the layer can be<br>
provided by an absorbent imprint or a reflective metal layer. For example,<br>
the layer can be manufactured by printing on the functional layer 36 with a<br>
commercially available, especially black, printing ink. This is appropriate<br><br><br><br><br><br>
especially when the functional layer 36 comprises cholesteric liquid crystal<br>
material. If the functional layer 36 is present as a UV-crosslinkable lacquer<br>
layer, the further layer can be provided by a metal layer into which, through<br>
partial demetallization, gaps can be introduced, e.g. in the form of an inverse<br>
lettering. A further, e.g. machine-readable, layer can be imprinted under the<br>
layer. Machine-readable security features can also be located in the further<br>
layer itself. The further manufacturing process then proceeds as already<br>
described in connection with fig. 3.<br>
In the foil material having inverse lettering 60 in fig. 4, a nematic liquid<br>
crystal layer 34 is imprinted on a substrate foil 32. Over the substrate foil 32<br>
and the nematic layer 34 is contiguously imprinted a UV-curing embossing<br>
lacquer layer 62 whose adhesion to the substrate foil 32 is less than to the<br>
nematic layer 34 such that the embossing lacquer layer 62 fulfills the function<br>
of the above-described functional layer when the foil material 60 is<br>
transferred to a target substrate.<br>
Thereafter, a desired embossing pattern 64, e.g. a diffraction pattern, is<br>
embossed in the embossing lacquer layer 62 and a reflective layer 66, e.g. in<br>
the form of a metal layer, applied, especially vapor deposited, into which,<br>
through partial demetallization, gaps 68 are introduced, in the exemplary<br>
embodiment in the form of an inverse lettering. Alternatively, the embossing<br>
pattern 64 can also be provided with a high-index layer. Examples of suitable<br>
high-index materials include CaS, CrO2, ZnSi, TiO2 and SiOx. Lastly, for the<br>
transfer to the target substrate, an adhesive layer 38 is applied to the layered<br>
composite.<br>
Instead of a reflective layer 66 in the form of a metal layer or a high-index<br>
layer, the embossing pattern 64 can also be provided with a thin-film<br><br><br>
element having a color-shift effect, as is described in detail below with<br>
reference to fig. 6.<br>
Prior to application of the adhesive layer 38, further machine-readable<br>
and/ or decorative layers can be applied to the partially demetallized<br>
embossing lacquer layer 62, especially also overlapping with the metal layer<br>
66. For example, a commercially available printing ink can be imprinted that<br>
is then perceptible in the gaps or demetallized areas of the embossing lacquer<br>
layer when the foil material applied to a substrate is viewed. Furthermore,<br>
just like the adhesive layer 38, the printing ink can include machine-readable<br>
feature substances, such as magnetic, electrically conductive, phosphorescent<br>
or fluorescent substances.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates the manufacture of a foil material 70 according to a further<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Here, as shown in fig. 5(a),<br>
a first layered composite 72 is produced from a first substrate foil 32, a<br>
nematic liquid crystal layer 34 and a functional layer 36, as described in<br>
connection with fig. 3. The functional layer 36 can be formed e.g. by a UV-<br>
crosslinkable lacquer layer or a layer comprising cholesteric liquid crystal<br>
material.<br>
In addition, as shown in fig. 5(b), a second security layered composite 74 is<br>
manufactured in that an embossing lacquer layer is imprinted on a second<br>
substrate foil 80, a desired embossing pattern, in the exemplary embodiment<br>
a diffraction pattern, is embossed in the embossing lacquer, a metal layer 84<br>
is vapor deposited on the embossed layer 82 and, through partial<br>
demetallization of the metal layer 84, gaps 86 are produced, for example in<br>
the form of an inverse lettering.<br><br><br>
The second security layered composite 74 is laminated via an adhesive layer<br>
76 (fig. 5(c)) onto the first layered composite 72, as indicated by the arrow 78<br>
linking figures 5(b) and 5(a). Thereafter, the second substrate foil 80 is<br>
removed by separation winding and, for transfer, an adhesive layer 38 is<br>
applied to the layered composite produced in this way, as depicted in fig. 5<br>
(c). If the foil material is to be used as a transfer material for transfer to a<br>
target substrate, the substrate foil 32 can be removed following the<br>
application of the transfer material 70 to the target substrate such that the<br>
entire security layered composite is then present without substrate foils. In<br>
this way, the features that work with polarization effects are not impaired in<br>
their effect by foils and can be viewed with high contrast. If the foil material<br>
is to be used as a security thread for embedment in a security paper, the<br>
substrate foil 32 can likewise be removed by separation winding and further<br>
layers of the thread structure, such as an adhesion promoter and a heat seal<br>
coating, can be applied on the then exposed liquid crystal layers 34 and 36.<br>
The reduced protective function for the metallization, caused by the<br>
detachment of the second substrate foil 80, can be compensated for by<br>
protective lacquer layers. Common protective lacquer layers are optically<br>
largely isotropic and thus do not impair the perceptibility of polarizing<br>
effects.<br>
If a layer comprising cholesteric liquid crystal material is used as the<br>
functional layer 36, an additional, darkly colored layer can be applied, if<br>
applicable discontiguously, to the security layered composite 74 to ensure<br>
good perceptibility of the color effect of the cholesteric liquid crystal layer.<br>
Alternatively, the embossing lacquer layer 82 can also be darkly colored.<br>
Instead of the embossing pattern, the second security layered composite can<br>
also include only a metallic reflection layer that is preferably integrated with<br><br>
large demetallization portions in a print motif. Compared with conventional<br>
designs, the foil material according to the present invention then exhibits,<br>
with the nematic layer 34, an additional check level that can be authenticated<br>
with a polarizer.<br><br>
In all designs having a metallic reflection layer, this layer can also be<br>
substituted by a more complex reflection layer structure having particular<br>
reflection effects, such as a color-shift effect. For this, fig. 6 shows an<br>
exemplary embodiment whose manufacture proceeds analogously to the<br>
manufacturing process described for fig. 5.<br>
To manufacture the foil material 90, in fig. 6, that can be used, for example,<br>
in a security thread 12 or a security strip 16 of the kind shown in fig. 1, a<br>
first layered composite is produced from a first substrate foil 32, a nematic<br>
liquid crystal layer 34 and a functional layer 36, e.g. a UV-crosslinkable<br>
lacquer layer, and a second security layered composite from a second<br>
substrate foil to which a thin-film element 92 having a color-shift effect is<br>
applied.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the thin-film element 92 exhibits a reflection<br>
layer 94, an absorber layer 98 and a dielectric spacing layer 96 disposed<br>
between the reflection layer and the absorber layer. In such thin-film<br>
elements, the color-shift effect is based on viewing-angle-dependent<br>
interference effects due to multiple reflections in the different sub-layers of<br>
the element. The absorber layer 98 and/or the dielectric spacing layer 96 can<br>
exhibit gaps in the form of patterns, characters or codes in which no color-<br>
shift effect is perceptible. The reflection layer 94, too, can exhibit gaps in the<br>
form of patterns, characters or codes that then form transparent or semi-<br>
transparent areas in the thin-film element 92.<br><br><br><br>
The sequence of the layers of the thin-film element can also be reversed.<br>
Alternatively, the thin-film element can exhibit a layer sequence comprising<br>
absorber layer/dielectric layer/absorber layer or a sequence of multiple<br>
layers comprising alternating high-index and low-index dielectrics. A layer<br>
sequence comprising a reflection layer and an absorbent dielectric layer may<br>
also be used.<br>
The second security layered composite produced in this way is then<br>
laminated onto the first layered composite via an adhesive layer 76, and<br>
the second substrate foil removed by separation winding. For the transfer<br>
to the target substrate, an adhesive layer 38 is applied to the now exposed<br>
reverse of the thin-film element 92. Prior to the application of the adhesive<br>
layer 38, further machine-readable and/or decorative layers, e.g. having a<br>
magnetic ink, can be applied to the exposed reverse of the thin-film<br>
element 92. Following the transfer, the first substrate foil 32 can also be<br>
detached.<br>
In a variation that is not shown of the exemplary embodiment in fig. 6, a<br>
foil material is produced for a two-sided security thread having a liquid-<br>
crystal-based color-shift or polarization effect that, for the viewer, is<br>
perceptible from the one side, and a thin-film element having a color-shift<br>
effect that is perceptible from the second side.<br>
The foil material differs from that shown in fig. 6 in that the functional layer<br>
36 is formed from cholesteric liquid crystal material. To facilitate especially<br>
good perceptibility of the color effect of the cholesteric liquid crystal layer,<br>
the adhesive layer 76 forms, in addition, a dark, preferably black<br>
background. For this, the adhesive layer 76 can be colored or, if applicable,<br>
subsequently blackened by the action of a laser beam. The thin-film element<br>
92 exhibits a reverse sequence to the above described layer sequence, i.e. in<br><br>
the foil material, the reflection layer is present adjoining the adhesive layer<br>
76, and the absorber layer adjoining the adhesive layer 38.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a foil material 100 according to a further exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, in which, as in fig. 3, a nematic liquid<br>
crystal layer 34 and a UV-crosslinkable functional layer 36, e.g. comprising<br>
cholesteric liquid crystal material, are imprinted on a smooth plastic<br>
substrate foil 32 that is suitable for aligning liquid crystal material. Further,<br>
on the functional layer 36 is imprinted an embossing lacquer layer, a desired<br>
embossing pattern, in the exemplary embodiment a diffraction pattern,<br>
embossed in the embossing lacquer layer, and a metal layer 104 vapor<br>
deposited on the embossed layer 102. Into the metal layer 104 are introduced,<br>
through partial demetallization, gaps 106 in the form of an inverse lettering.<br>
Instead of the metal layer 104, a transparent high-index layer that exhibits a<br>
refractive index greater than 2 can also be used. In this way, both the<br>
diffraction pattern and the liquid crystal layers 34 and 36 are contiguously<br>
perceptible on a dark background that is formed by an appropriate<br>
additional layer, for example a black imprint, or that can also be present on<br>
the target substrate.<br><br>
To improve the adhesion of the embossing lacquer layer 102 to the functional<br>
layer 36, the latter is advantageously previously subjected to a corona<br>
treatment or it is furnished with a suitable adhesion promoter. For the<br>
application to the target substrate, another adhesive layer 38 is applied to the<br>
entire layered composite. Depending on the choice of the relaying layer and<br>
the brilliance requirements, the substrate foil 32 can be removed following<br>
the application of the foil material 100, or left on the structure.<br>
The manufacture of a foil material 110 for a security thread having a liquid-<br>
crystal-based color-shift effect, an inverse lettering and a magnetic code<br><br><br><br><br>
according to a further exemplary embodiment of the present invention will<br>
now be explained with reference to fig. 8.<br>
First, as shown in fig. 8(a), a first layered composite 112 is produced from a<br>
first substrate foil 32, a nematic liquid crystal layer 34 and a functional layer<br>
36, e.g. comprising cholesteric liquid crystal material, as described for fig. 3.<br>
A second security layered composite 114 is manufactured in that a screened<br>
aluminum layer 122 having gaps in the form of an inverse lettering is applied<br>
to a second substrate foil 120, and a magnetic layer 124 is applied, in the<br>
exemplary embodiment in the form of a code, to the aluminum layer. This<br>
second security layered composite 114 is depicted in fig. 8(b).<br>
In a further embodiment not shown here, the aluminum layer 122 can also be<br>
provided as a contiguous layer having gaps, for example in the form of an<br>
inverse lettering, to which, in turn, the magnetic layer 124 is applied.<br>
The second security layered composite 114 is then laminated onto the first<br>
layered composite 112 via an adhesive layer 116 (fig. 8(c)). Thereafter, further<br>
layers 118 that are required for the embedment of the security thread in a<br>
security paper, such as a white coating layer, can be applied to the reverse of<br>
the second substrate foil 120. Finally, for the transfer to the target substrate,<br>
an adhesive layer 38, for example a heat seal coating, is applied. The<br>
substrate foil 32 can be removed by separation winding and further layers of<br>
the thread structure, such as an adhesion promoter and a heat seal coating,<br>
can be applied to the then exposed liquid crystal layers 34 and 36.<br>
In a variation that is not shown of the exemplary embodiment in fig. 8,<br>
instead of the magnetic layer 124 applied in the form of a code, also a dark,<br>
especially black, layer having gaps and, in some areas, a magnetic layer,<br>
for example in the form of magnetic bits, can be used. In particular, not all<br><br><br>
black areas must at the same time also be magnetic. In this way, it is<br>
possible to optically conceal a magnetic code in the black layer.<br>
A further variation of the exemplary embodiment in fig. 8 that differs only in<br>
the formation of the second security layered composite is depicted in fig. 9.<br>
The second security layered composite 132 of the foil material 130 in fig. 9<br>
includes, instead of the screened aluminum layer, a contiguous, semi-<br>
transparent metal layer 136 that is applied to a substrate foil 134 and on<br>
which a magnetic layer 138 is disposed, for example in the form of a code.<br>
The further procedure in the manufacture of the security thread 130 follows<br>
the description given above in connection with fig. 8.<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates the manufacture of a foil material 140 for a hologram<br>
security thread having a magnetic code and nematic print according to a<br>
further exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, a first layered composite 150 is manufactured from a first plastic<br>
substrate foil 152, a nematic liquid crystal layer 154, a functional layer 156<br>
comprising a modified UV-curing lacquer, and a first adhesive layer 158, as<br>
shown in fig. 10(a).<br>
To manufacture a second security layered composite 160, which is depicted<br>
in fig. 10(b), an embossing lacquer layer is imprinted on a second plastic<br>
substrate foil 162, a desired diffraction pattern is embossed in the embossing<br>
1acquer, and on the embossed layer 164 is vapor deposited a metal layer 166,<br>
e.g. an aluminum layer, in which, as already described in connection with<br>
fig. 5, gaps 168 are produced, for example in the form of an inverse lettering,<br>
through partial demetallization. A magnetic layer 170 is applied in the form<br>
of a code to the reverse, which is not coated with embossing lacquer, of the<br><br>
substrate foil 162. The magnetic bits of the magnetic code are then covered<br>
with a coating layer 172.<br>
A third layered composite 180 that acts as a cover element in the finished<br>
security thread is produced by applying a contiguous metal layer 184 to a<br>
third, particularly thin plastic substrate foil 182 and providing the metal<br>
layer 184 with a further contiguous adhesive layer 186, as shown in fig. 10(c).<br>
Now, the first layered composite 150 with the nematic print is laminated<br>
with the aid of the adhesive layer 158 onto the top of the hologram layered<br>
composite 160 (arrow 142), and the cover layered composite 180 is laminated<br>
via the adhesive layer 186 to the magnetic-code-bearing underside of the<br>
hologram layered composite 160 (arrow 144). Further layers 146, such as a<br>
white coating layer, that are required for the embedment of the security<br>
thread in a security paper can then be applied to the reverse of the third<br>
substrate foil 182. Finally, for the transfer to the target substrate, an adhesive<br>
layer 38, for example a heat seal coating, is applied, as depicted in fig. 10(d).<br>
The substrate foil 152 of the first layered composite 150 can then be removed<br>
by separation winding and further layers of the thread structure, such as an<br>
adhesion promoter and a heat seal coating, can be applied to the then<br>
exposed liquid crystal layers 154 and 156.<br>
The application of the described security elements to a target substrate 200,<br>
e.g. a security paper or a plastic foil, is explained with reference to fig. 11 by<br>
way of example based on the foil material present as the transfer material 70<br>
in fig. 5. For this, the transfer material 70 is laid with the heat seal adhesive<br>
layer 38 on the target substrate 200 and pressed on. The pressing can occur,<br>
for example, with a heated transfer stamp or a transfer roller, which are not<br>
depicted. Under pressure and heat action, the adhesive layer 38 bonds with<br>
the target substrate 200 in the desired areas 202 such that a transfer element<br><br><br>
is created, if apphcable having a predetermined outline shape. The substrate<br>
foil 32 of the liquid crystal layers 34,36 can be removed in the application<br>
process or also shortly thereafter. Prior to the application of the transfer<br>
material 70 to the target substrate 200, the surface of the target substrate 200<br>
can be specially treated. In this way, it is possible to improve especially the<br>
adhesive effect of the transfer material and the optical efficiency of the<br>
security features it provides. For example, an adhesion promoter can be<br>
applied to the surface of the transfer material.<br>
Fig. 12 shows a security element 190 according to a further exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, in which, as in fig. 4, a nematic<br>
liquid crystal layer 34 and, contiguously thereover, as a functional layer, a<br>
UV-curing embossing layer 192 are imprinted on a smooth plastic substrate<br>
foil 32, e.g. a PET foil, that is suitable for aligning liquid crystal material.<br>
On the diffraction pattern embossed in the embossing lacquer layer 192 is<br>
vapor deposited a metal layer 194 into which, if applicable, gaps can be<br>
introduced through partial demetallization.<br>
Prior to the application of the adhesive layer 38, further layers, in the<br>
exemplary embodiment a machine-readable layer 196 that includes machine-<br>
readable feature substances, such as magnetic, electrically conductive,<br>
phosphorescent or fluorescent substances, as well as a white coating layer<br>
198 that is required for the embedment of the security thread in a security<br>
paper, are applied discontiguously, e.g. in the form of a motif.<br>
Thereafter, the layered composite comprising plastic substrate foil 32,<br>
nematic liquid crystal layer 34, metallized embossing lacquer layer 192,<br>
194, machine-readable layer 196 and coating layer 198 is laminated by<br>
means of the adhesive layer 38 onto a target substrate 199, such as a PET<br>
foil.<br><br><br>
If desired or necessary, the plastic substrate foil 32 can be removed again by<br>
separation winding. In this case, it is to be ensured that the adhesion of the<br>
functional layer 192 to the substrate foil 32 is less than to the nematic layer<br>
34.<br>
However, it is also possible to leave the substrate foil 32 in the layered<br>
composite. Such an embodiment is appropriate especially when the<br>
security element is present in the form of a security strip in a window,<br>
manufactured with papermaking technology or diecut, of a banknote. The<br>
substrate foil 32 then also serves, for instance, as a cover foil.<br>
Fig. 13(a) shows, in cross-sectional view, a foil material 210 according to a<br>
further exemplary embodiment of the present invention, in which, as in fig.<br>
3, a nematic liquid crystal layer 34 and a functional layer 36 comprising<br>
cholesteric liquid crystal material, are imprinted on a smooth, transparent<br>
plastic substrate foil 32. The nematic layer 34 is typically imprinted in the<br>
form of a motif comprising patterns, characters or a code, for example in the<br>
form of the letter string "PL" shown in fig. 13(b).<br><br>
To facilitate good perceptibility of the polarization effects of the nematic<br>
liquid crystal layer, as is described in connection with fig. 3, a reflective metal<br>
layer 216 is applied over the nematic layer 34 in the areas 212 prior to the<br>
application of the adhesive layer 38. Furthermore, in the metal-layer-free<br>
areas 214, an absorbent imprint is imprinted with a commercially available,<br>
especially black, printing ink. This provides a dark background layer 218 that<br>
is essential for the perceptibility of the color-shift effects of the cholesteric<br>
liquid crystal layer.<br><br><br>
Tliereafter, the adhesive layer 38 is applied with which the layered composite<br>
comprising the substrate foil 32, nematic layer 34, functional layer 36, metal<br>
layer 216 and dark background layer 218 can be laminated onto a target<br>
substrate, such as a security paper, a value document or also a further thread<br>
lor strip structure. If desired or necessary, the substrate foil 32 for the liquid<br>
crystal materials 34 and 36 can, in a last step, be removed again by separation<br>
winding. Here, the damageless detachability of the substrate foil 32 is<br>
ensured by the greater adhesion of the functional layer 36 to the nematic<br>
layer 34.<br><br>
In a variation that is not shown of the exemplary embodiment in fig. 13, the<br>
nematic layer 34 can also be present in the area 214, for example likewise in<br>
the form of a motif. When the foil material that is applied to a target<br>
substrate is viewed with the naked eye, then only the color-shift effects of the<br>
icholesteric liquid crystal layer 36 are perceptible. If, however, the foil<br>
material is viewed through a linear polarizer, the structures formed by the<br>
nematic layer 34 appear.<br><br>
