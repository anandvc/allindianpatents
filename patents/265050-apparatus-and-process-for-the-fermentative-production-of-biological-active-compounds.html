Apparatus and process for the fermentative production of biological active<br>
compounds<br>
The invention relates to a process and an apparatus for the fermentational production of biological active materials wherein the fermenter is located in an insulator which in turn is located in a working chamber or is adjacent to it, and wherein a pressure gradient in relation to ambient pressure prevails in both the insulator and in the working chamber.<br><br><br>
vial) containing the starting material (cell bank) is opened, if only shortly, it may come to aefosol formation. This is also valid for the intermediate steps of the preculture stages until the start of fermentation. Here a port of the fermenter will be opened, if only shortly, by which measures it may come to aerosol formation. Likewise it is possible that during processing of the fermentation product, i. e. the biological active substance, it will result in an aerosol formation. Thus there is the risk of exposure to germs, bacteria or toxic substances for the environment. Caused by the relative low pressure in the second chamber in relation to the first chamber, aerosols from the first chamber may infiltrate the second chamber which can lead to a thread for the persons working in the second chamber. Nevertheless, to give a guarantee for operational safety, more precautions in this case must be set, as for example vaccination of the employees, wearing of protective clothing, etc.<br>
Therefore there is a need for a process and an apparatus for production of biological active materials by fermentation, wherein the materials will be protected against contamination from the environment and at the same time the exposure of the personnel with aerosols will be reduced or completely prevented.<br>
The present invention solves this object by providing the apparatus and the process according to the accompanying claims.<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a process for the production of biological active agent via fermentation, preferably in- an ultrapure form, wherein a contamination of the biological material with particles and germs from the environment will be prevented and at the same time the potential of a hazard to the personnel working with the biological material will be reduced. Preferably the fermentational process includes at least a step of inoculation. More preferably the fermentational process includes at least one step which is manually conducted, and most preferably this step is the step of inoculation.<br>
The process and the apparatus of the present invention allow for the use of approved production techniques and purification techniques which are or which could be affiliated with aerosol formation, without any fundamental hazard to the persons which are in charge with the production processes and/or the processing processes or to the environment through aerosol formation. In other words, the apparatus of the present invention and the process of the present invention reduce the exposure of the persons<br><br>
dealing with the production and of the environment to biological active material, bacteria and/or germs and at the same time allows for the application of established techniques which make an efficient production and purification of the biological material possible, although these materials are fundamentally connected to an aerosol formation.<br>
The apparatus of the present invention includes at least an insulating chamber (insulator) being surrounded by a working chamber or being adjacent thereto. The working chamber is connected with the environment via a pressure sluice. Both in the insulator as well as also in the working chamber a low pressure prevails compared to the pressure of the environment, wherein the pressure in the insulator is lower than the pressure in the working chamber. In the pressure sluice there prevails an over pressure in relation to the ambient pressure. The insulator contains at least a fermenter, in which the biological active material will be produced by fermentation.<br>
Using the apparatus of the present invention the biological active material will be produced and/or processed in the insulator. An insulator as used herein is an airtight defined system as compared to the environment that stays in an energetic exchange with its environment, but does not allow for an uncontrolled transport of material with its environment. Controlled transport of material with its environment, for example the respective load or withdrawal of equipment, reagents, starting material, intermediate products, and end products, can be provided by one or more sluices, double trap container, i. e. so called i -ports in connection with I -containers or I -bags. Controlled transport of material is possible before, during or after the fermentation and/or the purification of the fermentation product or the biological active material.<br>
The insulator can be operated at over pressure or low pressure regulated through appropriate facilities, it is likewise possible that an atmosphere of inert gas will be generated in the insulator. The insulator typically operates on one or on more supply air duct(s) and exhaust air duct(s) which are typically equipped with filters. Thus in the insulator a number of germs of preferably less than 100, more preferably less than 10, and most preferably less than 1 germ/m^ will be achieved. Such filters are known to one of skill in the art. An example for such filter is a HEPA (high efficiency particulate filter) filter.<br><br>
The equipment, apparatuses, or objects situated in the insulator can be moved or operated via a control system from the outside or via glove inlets attached to the insulator which will be actuated from the working chamber.<br>
The insulator is preferably made completely or partially from a material which is biological inert and easy to clean and which allows for an in situ decontamination or sterilization, respectively. Therefore a material is preferred which allows for sterilization with formalin, ethylene oxide or vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP). Such materials include for example glass, stainless steel or polymers, such as PVC. Preferably the insulator is so manufactured that the interior surface thereof is completely or partially made of glass, stainless steel or other appropriate materials, such as polymers. Thus both hard and also soft polymers (hard and soft wall insulators) can be used. Gloves are typically made from neoprene, hypalone, vinyl or other suitable materials.<br>
Typically the insulator disposes of an installation for temperature control and temperature regulation.<br>
Typically the insulator is situated in or abuts to a working chamber. There is a pressure gradient between the insulator and the working chamber. Thereby a lower pressure prevails in the insulator compared to the one in the working chamber which in turn exhibits a lower pressure compared to ambient pressure. The ambient pressure accounts for 101,325 Pa, but may be varying depending on geographical position or meteorological conditions.<br>
Typically the operating pressure in the insulator is a low pressure in the range of 20 to 200 Pa, preferably in the range of 40 to 100 Pa and most preferably in the range of 55 to 75 Pa, respectively compared to ambient pressure (101,325 Pa).<br>
Usually the operating pressure in the insulator is approximately 10 to 100, preferably is 20 to 80, more preferably is approximately around 40 to 60 Pa lower compared to the working chamber.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the typical value of the pressure difference between insulator and working chamber, within metrological and equipment dependant fluctuations, lies in the range of 35 to 57 Pa and preferably is around 45 Pa, i,e. the<br><br>
pressure in the insulator respectively is approximately 35 to 57 or approximately 45 Pa lower than the one in the working chamber.<br>
The supply of air into and out of the insulator occurs preferably via filters, such that a number of germs of at most 100, preferably of at most 10 germs/m3 and most preferably of at most 1 germ/m3 prevails in the insulator.<br>
The working chamber of the present invention is an airtight sealed system which is airtight connected on the one hand with the insulator for the purpose of an exchange of matter or equipment through one or more lockable openings. On the other hand it is connected for the exchange of matter or equipment and/or acquisition through at least one lockable pressure sluice in an airtight manner. The working chamber surrounds or abuts to the insulator. The supply of air into and out of the working chamber occurs preferably via filters, such that a number of germs of at most 200, preferably a number of at most 100 germs/m3 and most preferably a number of at most 10 germ/m3 predominate in the working chamber. Such filters are for example available in trade under the name HEPA filters.<br>
The working chamber preferably exhibits a temperature of around 19 to 26°C and a relative humidity of 40 to 60%. The first and the second insulator exhibit independent from each other a temperature and a relative humidity which is common and suitable for the performance of the production and the purification of the biological active material.<br>
In the working chamber an operating pressure prevails which is higher than the one in the insulator, but there exists a pressure gradient in relation to the ambient pressure and to the pressure sluice.<br>
Typically the pressure in the working chamber is 5 to 50, preferably 10 to 30, most preferably 12 to 18 Pa lower than compared to ambient pressure.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention a typical value of the pressure difference, within metrological and equipment dependant fluctuations, is 15 Pa compared to ambient pressure, i.e. the pressure in the working chamber is approximately 15 Pa lower than the ambient pressure.<br><br>
The working chamber is connected to the surrounding via at least one lockable pressure sfuice. In the sluice there is an over pressure in relation to ambient pressure of 10 to 100 Pa, preferably 20 to 80, and most preferably 25 to 35 Pa.<br>
Generally a pressure difference exists between pressure sluice and working chamber of 10 to 200 Pa, preferably 20 to 100, and most preferably 40 to 60 Pa.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention a typical value of the pressure difference between pressure sluice and working chamber, within metrological and equipment dependant fluctuations, is 45 Pa, i.e. the pressure in the working chamber is approximately 45 Pa lower than the ambient pressure.<br>
Generally a pressure difference exists between pressure sluice and insulator of 10 to 300 Pa, preferably 50 to 200, and most preferably 80 to 100 Pa. A typical value of the pressure difference between pressure sluice and insulator, within metrological and equipment dependant fluctuations, is 90 Pa, i.e. the working pressure in the insulator is approximately 90 Pa lower than in the pressure sluice.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the apparatus of the present invention comprises at least one other insulator. This at least one other insulator can be situated in the same working chamber as compared to the first insulator or can abut to the same working chamber, it also can be airtight connected to the first insulator, for example through one or more lockable sluices, double trap container or ports. The insulators however may also not be connected with each other. The at least one other insulator preferably has the same features as the first insulator which is described above.<br>
In the insulator of the present invention a fermentation step will typically be performed, which is preferably a fermentation step, in which the biological active material will be produced. Preferably this fermentation step includes one or more inoculations. Thus the insulator of the present invention contains at least one fermenter.<br>
Typically in the insulator one or more steps of measures which are necessary for the purification of the biological material will also be executed. Therefore fermentation and purification may be executed in one and the same insulator or also in different insulators, for example the fermentation in the first insulator and the purification in the second insulator.<br><br>
The fermentation step which deals with the synthesis of the biological active material occurs in a fermenter. Thus one may selectively be concerned about an anaerobic or an aerobic working fermenter. The fermenter is constructed and equipped in accordance with the particular fermentation conditions, in accordance with the knowledge of those skilled in the art. The fermenter can be a fermenter for the batch fermentation, the semi-batch fermentation or the continuous fermentation. Preferably it is a fermenter for the batch fermentation.<br>
The fermentation step may also comprise the precultivation or the initial cultivation to inoculate the main fermenter. The different measures and the corresponding procedural equipment which are required for this purpose are known for those skilled in the art and comprise among other things one or more fermenters which allow a first and/or a second expansion of the vaccine stock of the producing strain which produces the biological active material. The measures associated therewith also comprise for example the establishment of a working cell bank, the first expansion of cell material, the second expansion of cell material and the actual fermentation step, whereas with actual fermentation step in particular the growth of cells for the synthesis of the biological active compound is meant. These steps will be executed preferably at the temperature or temperature gradient defined through the respective producing organism. Therefore the temperature will be, if applicable, continuously or discontinuously adapted to the production conditions.<br>
It is possible that one or more steps or measurements which are necessary for the purification of the biological active material will be executed in the insulator. Accordingly the insulator contains the equipment necessary for it.<br>
The purification of the biological active material may also be conducted in a second insulator of the apparatus of the present invention. As only a part of the measures for purification will be conducted in the second insulator, the remaining part of the necessary measurements will be conducted in the first insulator or in one or more further insulators.<br>
Certain measurements which are necessary or connected to the production of the biological active material may also be executed outside of an insulator, in particular then, if they are not associated with aerosol formation or if the biological active material is<br><br>
available in a form or in a container from which one assumes no hazards for the persons engaged with the production or operation or for the environment.<br>
For fermentation which generates the biological active material is preferably a matter of fermentation of bacteria, in particularly a matter of bacteria of the Clostridium botulinum family. This is also applicable for recombinant or genetically modified Clostridium botulinum strains as well as for other recombinant or genetically modified heterologous expression systems (e. g. E. coli).<br>
Using the installed equipment all biological active compounds, in particular proteins, which will be synthesized by fermentational growing of microorganisms may in principle be produced.<br>
The biological active compound which will be produced by using the fermentation process preferably is a toxin, more preferably is a botulinum toxin, and most preferably is a botulinum neurotoxin.<br>
Botulinum toxin will be produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and exists in different serotypes: botulinum toxin type A, B, C, D, E, F, G. The botulinum toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum is a complex of the botulinum neurotoxin, i. e. the protein which is responsible for the toxic effect, and complexing proteins which as such are non toxic. These proteins are hemagglutinins with different molar masses as well as at least one non hemagglutinating protein. The complexes from botulinum neurotoxin and the (bacterial) complex proteins are in general termed botulinum toxin. The complexes of the types A, B, and C are commercially available, type A for example as BOTOX®. These complexes permit to be further processed in order to yield complexes of different protein composition and purity up to the botulinum neurotoxin itself. Therefore within the scope of this invention the term botulinum neurotoxin will be used to describe the protein which is responsible for the toxic effect, i.e. the ultrapure botulinum toxin that is free of bacterial complexing proteins. The botulinum toxin type A has a molecular mass of approximately 150 kDa and is commercially marketed under the trade name Xeomin® by the applicant.<br>
Eligible within the scope of this invention are all forms of the "botulinum toxin", especially the different serotypes, the different complexes of botulinum neurotoxin and complex proteins,   the   botulinum   neurotoxin   itself  as   well   as   modified   or   corresponding<br><br>
2<br>
recombinant produced botulinum toxins or botulinum neurotoxins including the corresponding mutations, deletions etc. For appropriate mutants we refer to mutants which are described in WO 2006/027207 A1. Furthermore it will be possible within the scope of the invention to produce mixtures of different serotypes (in a complexed or ultrapure and/or recombinant form), e. g. mixtures of botulinum toxins of the types A and B or mixtures of neurotoxins of the types A and B.<br>
The production of botulinum neurotoxin of the types A and B will be described for example in the international patent application WO 00/74703. As a result of the characteristics of the (isolated) botulinum neurotoxin of a practically missing immunogenicity which is advantageous over complexes made from botulinum neurotoxin and complexing proteins, hence there is in particular a tremendous need to provide for apparatuses and processs for the safe and reliable industrial production of botulinum neurotoxin, as does the present invention.<br>
The selection and/or the number of precisely used insulators will be freely chosen from those skilled in the art depending on the biological compound to be produced. Within the precise purification which is described herein in more detail the use of at least two insulators are advantageously used. Thus the insulators vary particularly with respect to the temperature which predominates therein or in a portion therein. Thus it is preferred within the scope of the present invention that the first insulator will be operated at a higher temperature, e. g. at around 20 to SOX, and the second insulator will be operated at a lower temperature, for example in the range of about -5 to +25'C. Thus in the first insulator those steps of the production as well as of the purification are conducted, which necessitate an adequate higher temperature or which can be executed at this temperature. That includes especially the inoculation, the fermentation and/or the precipitation of the producing strain. On the contrary those steps of the production process and especially of the purification of the neurotoxin are executed in the second insulator which necessitate an adequate lower temperature and can be conducted in an especially beneficial manner at this temperature range.<br>
It will be further appreciated that those steps of the production in general and of the fermentation and purification in particular which can be conducted in both temperature ranges and therefore in each of the two insulators, will finally be conducted in the one insulator which is advantageous in view of its dimensioning and of the energy consumption as a result of the dimensioning for the maintenance of the appropriate<br><br>
reaction conditions for the performance of the reaction steps, especially the temperature, or in view of manageability or feasibility of the individual measures.<br>
The second insulator is in principle similarly built as the first insulator, but is provided with facilities and equipment or technical equipment features according to the apparatus, as they are required for the conduction of the purification steps planned in the second insulator or for the measures thereof. Thus, preferred purification steps which are conducted in the second insulator are selected from the group comprising precipitation, extraction, centrifugation, dialysis and chromatography. According to this the second insulator includes one or more precipitation facilities, extraction facilities, centrifugation facilities, dialysis facilities and/or chromatography facilities. Preferably a precipitation facility comprises a reaction container in which the solution for performing the precipitation is contained, equipped with a feeding pipe to add the compound(s) required for precipitation. In addition, the precipitation facility basically comprises measures for taking out the supernatant as well as the precipitate. Appropriate facilities are known to those skilled in the art. An extraction facility typically comprises a reaction container in which the solution for extraction is contained, a feeding pipe for adding the extraction medium as well as a device to separate the fluid which contains the extract from the extracting fluid. A centrifugation facility typically comprises a centrifuge to separate solid-solid mixtures or liquid-solid mixtures. The chromatography facility typically comprises a chromatography column which is filled with a chromatography material as well as an inlet and an outlet and containers with appropriate media both to feed the chromatography column and to elute. The used chromatography is, e.g., size exclusion chromatography, HPLC or affinity chromatography.<br>
Thus it is within the scope of the present invention if two or more insulators will be used they are connected with each other in such a way that merely the entirety of the apparatus which comprises both insulators comprises a supply air duct and an exhaust air duct and that the both insulators are connected with one or more intermediate ducts. Therefore it is also within the scope of the present invention that the first insulator as well as the second insulator and/or any further insulator comprise in each case and independent from each other a supply air duct and an exhaust air duct.<br>
The first and the second insulator preferably exhibit an internal pressure which is lower compared to the external pressure. At the same time it is within the scope of the present invention that both insulators exhibit an identical internal pressure. It is however also<br><br>
within the scope of the present invention that both insulators exhibit different internal pressures. Therefore it is especially preferred that the internal pressure of the insulator is lowered in which the likelihood of aerosol formation is higher due to the process steps which are performed in the respective insulator.<br>
If using two insulators, the availability of a connection between the insulators in form of a passage, for example in form of a sluice, between both insulators is advantageous, because it will be ensured that the transfer of both the produced and purified material to the different steps of the production and processing can occur without breaking through the barrier built by the insulator. The design of the apparatus and of each of the insulator or at least of one insulator of the apparatus of the present invention with a sterilization device serves basically the same objective. Similar sterilization devices are known to those skilled in the art and comprise for example a generator for the generation of vaporous hydrogen peroxide. Therefore the use of vaporous hydrogen peroxide is especially beneficial in view of the under pressure conditions.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention relates to a process for the fermentational production of a biological active compound wherein the process comprises a fermentation step for the production of the biological active compound and a purification step of the biological active compound, in which the fermentational production and/or the purification will be completely or partially executed in one or more insulators. Preferably the fermentation step and one or more parts of the purification occur in a first insulator and one or more parts of the purification occur in a second insulator. In a preferred embodiment the fermentation step includes at least an inoculation step. Preferably this step will be manually conducted. It is also within the scope of the present invention that further insulators will be used. The biological active material concerns preferably a botulinum toxin, especially a botulinum neurotoxin, as described herein. The features which are disclosed in connection with the present invention exhibit also features, either alone or in any combination of the process of the present invention.<br>
Measures in connection with the work-up are centrifugation, dialysis, extraction, precipitation, protamine sulfate precipitation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, solubilizing of precipitates which generally occur as pellets, dialysis, chromatography steps or chromatography processs and filtration. Concerning the chromatography processs it is a succession of several individual chromatography processs. Thus in each case it can be a matter of the same chromatography process or of different chromatography processs. In<br><br>
case the pharmaceutical active compound is botulinum neurotoxin type A, it is a matter of succession of three chromatography steps using proper column material. Therefore it is possible and preferred that the particular eluate will undergo a dialysis before application onto the next column.<br>
After the actual fermentation and separation of the fermentation medium from the cells the fermentation medium will undergo a first precipitation with the goal to remove large proteins. This precipitation preferably will be performed in the first insulator. The centrifugation of the precipitate gained in such a way preferably occurs already in the second insulator. The precipitation is preferably an acid precipitation. Reaction conditions for such an acid precipitation are known to those skilled in the art. Typically 3 N H2SO4 will be used, to acidify the supernatant to a pH of 3,5. The centnfugation usually occurs for 20 minutes at 2400 x g at 43*0. The pellet received through centrifugation will be washed with water, preferably repeatedly.<br>
The Clostridium strain which is preferably used concerns C. botulinum type A which was stored in a suitable medium at temperatures which guarantee stability. For fermentation the process described by DasGupta B. R. et al. in Toxicon, vol. 22, No.3, p. 414 to 424, 1984, will be used. Therefore 0.5% yeast extract and 0.6% autoclaved yeast paste will be added to 2% of the N-Z-amine type A medium, and a pH of 7.2 will be adjusted with the help of 4N NaOH, and the medium prepared in such a way will afterwards be autoclaved. To this medium separately autoclaved glucose (20% by weight per volume) will be added, to come to a final concentration of glucose of 0.5% in the medium. Incubation occurred at 37°C without stirring, wherein the fermentation was discontinued after 96 hours. It is within the scope of the present invention that besides the batch fermentation described before also semi-batch fermentation, repeated batch fermentation or continuous fermentation can be performed. The measurements required for this purpose and the requirements concerning the apparatus are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In a further step starting from the pellet the precipitate will again be dissolved with the objective to release the toxin from the pellet. Measures for that are known for those skilled in the art and are described among others by DasGupta B. R. et al. (aaO). For example the extraction via a 0.1M citric acid-trisodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5 can be performed for an hour. Thereafter this extraction is followed by a further centrifugation step, usually at 9800 x g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The so obtained pellet optionally can<br><br>
then again be extracted as described before. The supernatant of the extraction, and both supernatants in case of repetition of the extraction, were then subjected to protamine sulfate precipitation. The precipitation continued at 8'C overnight. Afterwards the precipitate was again centrifuged for 20 minutes at 4°C and at 12,000 x g. At the protamine sulfate precipitation step especially DNA was removed.<br>
The supernatant received after centrifugation will be subject to an ammonium sulfate precipitation either in the first insulator or in the second insulator, whereby other larger proteins will be removed. After the ammonium sulfate precipitation step another centrifugation step is conducted and subsequently the so obtained pellet will be re-dissolved and will optionally be subjected to a dialysis. The extract which is preferably dialysed, and which is obtained from the pellet will afterward be centrifuged again and will be subjected to a succession of chromatography steps with the objective to purify the botulinum neurotoxin, especially to purify to homogeneity. Each of the chromatography steps serves thereby to remove the protamine sulfate, remaining DNA. parts of smaller proteins and middle-sized proteins as well as the hemagglutinins of the botulinum neurotoxin protein complex. For this purpose a succession of several chromatography steps will be executed in a preferred embodiment. The eluate will then be filtrated. The filtration serves thereby for the reduction of germs of the eluate, the latter preferably contains then the pure botulinum neurotoxin and no complex proteins any longer. Optionally the eluate can be diluted before filtration and accordingly suitable adjuvants can be added.<br>
During further steps another sterile filtration is carried out after addition of the adjuvants. Therefore the filtration takes place in reaction containers which then will be subject to a lyophilization, preferably in a separate process step. The product lyophilized in such a way will be sealed.<br>
