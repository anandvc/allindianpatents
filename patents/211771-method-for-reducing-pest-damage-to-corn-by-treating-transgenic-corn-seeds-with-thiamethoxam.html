METHOD FOR REDUCING PEST DAMAGE TO CORN<br>
BY TREATING TRANSGENIC CORN SEEDS WITH<br>
THIAMETHOXAM PESTICIDE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a non-provisional of U.S. Patent Application<br>
Serial No. 60/238,406, filed on October 6, 2000, and claims priority<br>
thereto.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1)	Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates generally to the control of pests that cause damage to corn plants by their feeding activities, and more particularly to the control of such corn plant pests by the combination of a corn seed having a transgenic event and the treatment of such seed with a thiamethoxam pesticide prior to planting the seed.<br>
(2)	Description of the Related Art:<br>
Insects and related arthropods annually destroy an estimated 15% of agricultural crops in the United States and even more than that in developing countries. In addition, competing weeds and parasitic and saprophytic plants account for even more potential yield losses.<br>
Some of this damage occurs in the soil when plant pathogens, insects and other such soil borne pests attack the seed after planting. In the production of com, much of the rest of the damage is caused by rootworms - insect pests that feed upon or otherwise damage the plant roots; and by cutworms, European corn borers, and other pests that feed upon or damage the above ground parts of the plant. General descriptions of the type and mechanisms of attack of pests on agricultural crops are provided by, for example, Metcalf, in Destructive and Useful Insects, (1962); and Agrios, in Plant Pathology, 3rd Ed., Academic Press (1988).<br>
Corn is the most important grain crop in the Midwestern United States. Among the most serious insect pests of corn in this region are the larval forms of three species of Diabrotica beetles. These include<br><br>
the Western corn rootworm, Diabrotica vergifera vergifera LeConte, the Northern corn rootworm, Diabrotica berberi Smith and Diabrotica berberi Lawrence, and the Southern corn rootworm, Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi Barber. In fact, more insecticide is used for the control of corn rootworm than for any other pest of corn, and the total acreage treated is greater than for any other pest in the United States.<br>
Corn rootworms (CRW) ovenvinter in the egg stage in fields where corn was grown the previous season. The eggs hatch from late May through June, If a corn crop is not followed by another com crop in the subsequent year, the larvae will die. Accordingly, the impact of corn rootworm is felt most directly in areas where corn is systematically  followed by corn, as is typical in many areas of the Midwestern United States.<br>
After hatching, the larvae pass through three larval stages or instars, during which they feed on the corn root system. About three weeks is required for completion of the larval stage. Damage to the corn root system caused by the feeding of larvae is the major cause of harvest losses in corn due to corn rootworm. Corn plants that fall over and lodge in the field after weakening or destruction of a major part of the root system are the cause of a major portion of this loss, since this lodged corn cannot be harvested by conventional mechanized machinery and is left in the field.<br>
Following completion of larval development, the larvae transform into immobile pupae, and thence into the adult beetles that emerge from the soil throughout the summer, with the period of emergence depending upon the growing location. After emergence, the adult beetles feed for about two weeks before the females start laying eggs. Initially, the adults feed predominantly in the same field from which they emerged, but later will migrate to other fields. Peak adult activity normally occurs in the U.S. Corn Belt during late July or early August in fields planted to continuous corn, but activity may peak later in first<br><br>
year or late maturing cornfields. Rootworm beetles begin depositing eggs in cornfields approximately two weeks after they emerge. (For more information, see, e.g., Com Rootworms, Field Crops Pest Management Circular #16, Ohio Pest Management &amp; Survey Program, The Ohio State University, Extension Division, Columbus, OH; available online at www.ag.ohio-state.edu/-'ohioline/icm-fact/fc-16.html. September 13. 2000; and McGahen et aL, Corn Insect Control: Corn Rootworm, PENpages number 08801502, Factsheet available from Pennsylvania State University, State College. PA, 1989).<br>
In present conventional agricultural practice, in cases where corn follows corn, it is normal for an insecticide to be applied to protect the corn root system from severe feeding by rootworm larvae. Conventional practice is to treat for the adult beetles or to treat for the larvae. Examples of conventional treatment formulations for adult beetles include the application of carbaryl insecticides (e.g.. SEVIN® 803 at 1.0 - 2.0 lbs active/acre); fenvalerate or esfenvalerate {e.g., PYDRIN® 2.4EC at 0.1 to 0.2 lbs active/acre, or ASANA® 0.66EC at 0.03 to 0.05 lbs active/acre); malathion (57% E at 0.9 lbs active/acre); permethrin (e.g.. AMBUSH® 2.0EC at 0.1 to 0.2 lbs active/acre, or POUNCE® 3.2EC at 0.1 to 0.2 lbs active ingredient/acre); or PENNCAP-M® at 0.25 - 0.5 lbs active/acre.<br>
To treat for CRW larvae, conventional practice is to apply a soil insecticide either at or after planting, but preferably as close to egg hatching as possible. Conventional treatments include carbofuran insecticides (e.g., FURADAN® 15G at 8 02/ 1000 ft of row); chloropyrifos {e.g., LORSBAN® 15G at 8 oz/1000 ft of row); fonophos (e.g., DYFONATE® 20G at 4.5 to 6.0 02/IOOO ft of row); phorate (e.g.. THIMET® 20G at 6 oz/1000 ft of row); terbufos (e.g,, COUNTER® 15G at 8 oz/1000 ft of row); or tefluthrin (e.g., FORCE® 3G at 4 to 5 oz/1000 ft of row).<br>
Many of the chemical pesticides listed above are known to be harmful to humans and to animals in general. The environmental harm<br><br>
that these pesticides cause is often exacerbated due to the practice of applying the pesticides by foliar spraying or direct application to the surface of the soil. Wind-drift, leaching, and runoff can cause the migration of a large fraction of the pesticide out of the desired zone of activity and into surface waters and direct contact with birds, animals and humans.<br>
Because of concern about the impact of chemical pesticides on public health and the health of the environment significant efforts have been made to find ways to reduce the amount of chemical pesticides that are used. Recently, much of this effort has focused on the development of transgenic crops that are engineered to express insect toxicants derived from microorganisms. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,877,012 to Estruch et ai discloses the cloning and expression of proteins from such organisms as Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Clavibacter and Rhizobium into plants to obtain transgenic plants with resistance to such pests as black cutworms, armyworms, several borers and other insect pests. Publication WO/EP97/07089 by Privalle et ai teaches the transformation of monocotyledons, such as corn, with a recombinant DNA sequence encoding peroxidase for the protection of the plant from feeding by corn borers, earworms and cutworms. Jansens ef a/., in Crop ScL, 37f5;:1616 - 1624 (1997), reported the production of transgenic corn containing a gene encoding a crystalline protein from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that controlled both generations of the European corn borer  U. S. Patent Nos. 5,625,136 and 5,859.336 to Koziel ef a/, reported that the transformation of corn with a gene from B. thuringiensis that encoded for delta-endotoxins provided the transgenic corn with improved resistance to European corn borer. A comprehensive report of field trials of transgenic corn that expresses an insecticidal protein from 6. thuringiensis has been provided by Armstrong ef ai, in Crop Science, 35(2):550 - 557 (1995),<br>
It was known that wild-type Bt 6-endotoxins had low activity against coleopteran insects, and Kreig ef a/., in 1983, reported the first<br><br>
isolation of a coleopteran-toxic B. thuhngiensis strain. (See U.S. Patent No. 4,766,203).  U.S, Patent Nos. 4,797,279 and 4.910.016. also disclosed wild-type and hybrid 6. thuringiensis strains that produced proteins having some coleopteran activity. More recently, however, more precise genetic engineering methods have shown promise in developing modified S. thuhngiensis proteins that have significantly higher levels of corn rootworm activity than those produced by wild-type parents. (See, e.g., WO 99/31248 to Ecogen, Inc. and Monsanto Company).<br>
However, it is not known at present whether any transgenic event alone will be sufficiently effective to protect corn from damage by corn rootworm in heavily infested fields that are dedicated to serial corn. In fact, the total control of com rootworm damage by any one transgenic event may not be desirable in the long term, because of the potential for the development of resistant strains of the target pest.<br>
Another alternative to the conventional forms of pesticide application is the treatment of plant seeds with pesticides. The use of fungicides to protect seeds from attack after planting, and the use of low levels of insecticides for the protection of, for example, corn seed from wireworm, has been used for some time. Seed treatment with pesticides has the advantages providing for the protection of the seeds, while minimizing the amotunt of pesticide that was required and limiting the amount of contact with the pesticide and the number of different field applications that were necessary.<br>
Other examples of the control of pests by applying insecticides directly to plant seed are provided in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5.696,144, which discloses that the European corn borer caused less feeding damage to corn plants grown from seed treated with a 1-arylpyrazole compound at a rate of 500 g per quintal of seed than control plants grown from untreated seed.  In addition, U.S. Patent No. 5,876,739 to Turnblad et al. (and its parent, U. S. Patent No. 5,849,320) disclose a method for controlling soil-borne insects which<br><br>
involves treating seeds with a coating containing one or more polymeric binders and an insecticide. This reference provides a list of insecticides that it identifies as candidates for use in this coating and also names a number of potential target insects- However, while the 5,876,739 patent states that treating corn seed with a coating containing a particular insecticide protects corn roots from damage by the corn rootworm, it does not indicate or otherwise suggest that such treatment could be used with seed having a transgenic event.<br>
The treatment of seed having a transgenic event with nitroimino-or nitroguanidino-compound pesticides has been mentioned (See, e.g., WO 99/35913), however, no guidance has been found as to the potential utility or efficacy of such treatments, or the details of how such treatments might be effected - such as the amounts of active ingredient that would be necessary per unit amount of seed — and no examples that would give reason to believe that the proposed treatments would actually provide suitable protection.<br>
Therefore, although recent developments in genetic engineering of plants have improved the ability to protect plants from pests without using chemical pesticides, and while such techniques as the treatment of seeds with pesticides have reducing the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment, numerous problems remain that limit the successful application of these methods under actual field conditions. Accordingly, it would be useful to provide an improved method for the protection of plants, especially corn plants, from feeding damage by pests. It would be particularly useful if such method would reduce the required application rate of conventional chemical pesticides, and also if it would limit the number of separate field operations that were required for crop planting and cultivation.<br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly, therefore, the present invention is directed to a novel method for protecting a transgenic corn plant against feeding damage by one or more pests, the method comprising providing a seed for the transgenic corn plant which seed comprises a transgenic event having activity against at least one of the one or more pests; and treating the seed with an effective amount of thiamethoxam pesticide.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a novel seed of a transgenic corn plant that provides increased resistance to the resulting corn plant against feeding damage by one or more pests, comprising a transgenic event having activity against at least one of the one or more pests, v^hich seed has been treated with an effective amount of thiamethoxam pesticide.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a novel transgenic corn seed that has been treated by the method of the present invention.<br>
Among the several advantages found to be achieved by the present invention, therefore, may be noted the provision of an improved method for the protection of plants, especially corn plants, from feeding damage by pests; the provision of such a method that reduces the required application rate of conventional chemical pesticides; and also the provision of such a method that limits the number of separate field operations that were required for crop planting and cultivation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that corn plants can be protected against feeding damage by one or more pests by a method that includes providing a corn seed having a transgenic event that has activity against at least one of the pests and then treating the transgenic corn seed with an effective amount of thiamethoxam pesticide- For example, in preferred embodiments it has been found that the combination of a transgenic event having activity against corn rootworm and treatment of the seed with thiamethoxam<br><br>
provides unexpectedly synergistic advantages to seeds having such treatment, including unexpectedly superior efficacy for protection against damage to the resulting corn plant by corn rootworm.  In particular, it is believed that corn seeds having a transgenic event that causes the production of CryBb.11231 endotoxin in combination with the treatment of such seeds with thiamethoxam would be unexpectedly superior to either the transgenic event alone, or to treatment with ithiamethoxam alone, in protecting resulting corn plants against more severe levels of damage by com rootworm - levels of damage that are known to reduce corn yield.<br>
Corn plants and seeds that have been engineered to include exogenous genes derived from Bacillus thuringiensis that encode for the expression of Cry3 5-endotoxins having activity against Coleopteran pests are known, as are methods for the treatment of seeds (even some transgenic seeds) with pesticides. However^ it had not been realized until the present invention that certain effective amounts of thiamethoxam could be used to treat corn seeds having such Cry3 events, with the result that the combination would be unexpectedly superior in increasing the efficacy of both the pesticide and the transgenic event, and would provide the additional advantages of increasing the ability to match pesticidal activity against pest pressure, decreasing cost of treatment and/or application, increasing safety of seed handling, and decreasing environmental impact of either or both the event and the pesticide.<br>
In particular, It is believed that in preferred embodiments the treatment of transgenic com seeds that are capable of expressing certain modified CrySBb proteins with from about 100 gm to about 400 gm of thiamethoxam per 100 kg of seed can provide unexpectedly superior protection against corn rootworm.  In addition, it is believed that such combinations are also effective to protect the emergent corn plants against damage by black cutworm. The seeds of the present invention are also believed to have the property of decreasing the cost<br><br>
of pesticide use, because less of the pesticide can be used to obtain a required amount of protection than if the innovative method is not used. Moreover, because less pesticide is used and because it is applied prior to planting and without a separate field application, it is believed that the subject method is therefore safer to the operator and to the environment, and is potentially less expensive than conventional methods.<br>
When it is said that some effects are "synergistic", it is meant to include the synergistic effects of the combination on the pesticidal activity (or efficacy) of the combination of the transgenic event and the pesticide. However, it is not intended that such synergistic effects be limited to the pesticidal activity, but that they should also include such unexpected advantages as increased scope of activity, advantageous activity profile as related to type and amount of damage reduction, decreased cost of pesticide and application, decreased pesticide distribution in the environment, decreased pesticide exposure of personnel who produce, handle and plant corn seeds, and other advantages known to those skilled in the art-<br>
The present invention also provides an advantage of increasing the ability to match pesticidal activity against pest pressure. This refers to the ability to design the combination of the transgenic event and the pesticide treatment so that the seed or the resulting plant is provided with effective pesticidal activity during the period when feeding pressure from the target pest on the seed or plant reaches its maximum. By way of example, when a pesticide such as thiamethoxam is applied to a corn seed having a corn rootworm transgenic event, the pesticide can be applied in a coating designed to provide controlled release of the pesticide. The release rate can be selected so that the pesticide provides protection against such other pests as are controlled by thiamethoxam at the post emergence stage of corn, while the transgenic event provides corn rootworm protection<br><br>
at a later stage of plant development - when such protection is needed.<br>
As used herein, the terms "pesticidal effect" and "pesticidal activity", or "activity" refer to a toxic effect against a pest. The terms "activity against (one or more) pests", also have the same meaning. When it is said that a seed or plant is "protected against feeding damage by one or more pests", it is meant that such seed or plant possesses a feature having direct or indirect action on one or more pests that results in reduced feeding damage by such pest or pests on the seeds, roots, shoots and foliage of plants having such feature as compared to the feeding damage caused under the same conditions to plants not having such feature. Such direct or indirect actions include inducing death of the pest, repelling the pest from the plant seeds. roots, shoots and/or foliage, inhibiting feeding of the pest on, or the laying of its eggs on, the plant seeds, roots, shoots and/or foliage, and inhibiting or preventing reproduction of the pest.<br>
The term "insecticidal activity" has the same meaning as pesticidal activity, except it is limited to those instances where the pest is an insect. Except where specifically noted, when the term "pesticide" is used herein, that term refers to a chemical pesticide that is supplied externally to the seed, and it is not meant to include active agents that are produced by the particular seed or the plant that grows from the particular seed. However, the terms "pesticidal activity" and "insecticidal activity" can be used with reference to the activity of either, or both, an externally supplied pesticide and/or an agent that is produced by the seed or the plant.<br>
One feature of the present invention is a seed of a transgenic corn plant. As used herein, the terms "transgenic corn plant" mean a corn plant or progeny thereof derived from a transformed corn plant cell or protoplast, wherein the plant DNA contains an introduced exogenous DNA molecule not originally present in a native, non-transgenic plant of the same strain.<br><br>
The transgenic corn seed is one that contains an exogenous gene that encodes a pesticidal protein. Pesticidal proteins of this type are described by Schnepf et a/., in Microbiology &amp; Molecular Biology Reviews, 62:775 - 806 (1998), and by ffrench-Constant and Bowen. in CMSL Cell. Mol. Life Sci, 57:828 - 833 (2000). In one application of the invention, the pesticidal protein is an insecticidal protein.<br>
It is preferred that the seed contains an exogenous gene derived from a strain of Bacillus thuhngiensis, and in particular, it is preferred that the exogenous gene is one that encodes an insecticidal 5-endotoxin derived from S. thuringiensis. Such 6-endotoxins are described in WO 99/31248 and U,S. Patent No. 6,063,597, and include the Cry3 toxins. Nucleic acid segments that encode modified B, thuhr)giensis coleopteran-toxic crystal proteins that are useful in the present invention are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,060,594. and insect resistant transgenic plants that include nucleic acid sequences that encode such insecticidal proteins are discussed in U.S. Patent No, 6,023,013. It is preferred that the 6-endotoxins of the present invention include the Cry3B proteins, and even more preferred that the S-endotoxins include the coleopteran-active Cry3Bb proteins. The nomenclature of the S. thuhngiensis insecticidal crystal proteins was set forth by Hofte and Whitely, Microbiol Rev.,53:2A2-255, 1989. This nomenclature has been revised, and the revised nomenclature can be found at http://epunix.biolssusx.ac.uk/Home/Neil-Crickmore/Bt/index.html The revised nomenclature will be used herein to describe transgenic event features and the 6-endotoxin proteins encoded by the transgenic event.<br>
When the terms "transgenic event" are used herein, such terms are meant to refer to the genetically engineered DNA that is described above, but also to include the protein(s) that are encoded by the modified gene. A transgenic event in a corn seed, or corn plant, therefore, includes the ability to express a protein. When it is said that a "transgenic event has activity against a pest'\ it is to be understood<br><br>
that it is the protein that is encoded by the gene that actually has such activity when the protein is expressed and brought into contact with the pest.<br>
WO 99/31248 and U.S. Patent Nos. 6,063.597 describe methods for genetically engineering 8. thuringiensis 5-endotoxin genes so that modified S-endotoxins can be expressed. The modified 6-endotoxins differ from the wild-type proteins by having specific amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions as compared with the proteins produced by the wild-type organism. Such modified δ-endotoxins are identified herein by the use of an asterisk (*), or by reference to a specific protein by its identifying number. Thus, a genetically modified Cry3 5-endotoxin would be expressed as Cry3*, examples of which include, without limitation: Cry3Bb.11230. Cry3Bb-11231, Cry3Bb,11232, Cry3Bb.11233, Cry3Bb.11234, Cry3Bb.11235, Cry3Bb.11236, Cry3Bb.11237, Cry3Bb.11238, Cry3Bb.11239, Cry3Bb.11241, CrySBb.l 1242. and Cry3Bb.11098.<br>
Some of the modified 6-endotoxins that were described in WO 99/31248 and in U.S. Patent No. 6,063,597 were found to have enhanced activity against coleopteran insects, and in particular against Diabrotica spp., including corn rootworm. As used herein, the terms "enhanced activity" refer to the increased insecticidal activity of a modified toxin as compared with the actrvity of the same toxin without the amino acid modifications when both are tested under the same conditions.  In particular, it was found that Cry3* 5-endotoxins had enhanced activity against corn rootworm, and are therefore preferred for use in the present invention. More preferred are Cry3B* 6-endotoxins, and even more preferred are Cry3Bb* 6-endotoxins. Even more preferred transgenic events are those that comprise the ability to express the modified 6-endotoxins that are listed in the following table. Also shown in the table are strains of transgenic 6. thuringiensis that include genes for expression of the respective novel endotoxins, and the date and accession number of their deposit with the Agricultural<br><br><br>
It has also been found that a preferred use of the present invention is for reducing pest feeding damage when used in combination with seeds having transgenic events that have certain levels of effectiveness against such pest. To illustrate which levels of effectiveness are preferred, the following example will use the Iowa Root Rating Method (Hills and Peters, J. Econ. EntomoL, 64:764-765, 1971), which measures corn rootworm feeding damage to corn roots on a 1 - 6 scale.  In the rating, 1 - no damage or only a few minor feeding scars; 2 = feeding scars evident but no roots eaten off to within 1½ inch of the plant; 3 = several roots eaten off to within 172 inch of the plant, but never the equivalent of an entire node of roots is destroyed; 4 = one root node completely destroyed; 5 = two root nodes completely destroyed; and 6 = three or more root nodes destroyed. A destroyed root is defined as a root that has been pruned to within 1½ inch of the<br><br>
base. Pruned roots do not have to originate from a single node, but all pruned roots must equal the equivalent of a full node to count as a destroyed node.<br>
As used herein, a transgenic event is wiithin the preferred range of effectiveness level against a target pest if that event reduces feeding damage by that pest by a certain amount as compared with the same crop without the transgenic event, but does not prevent substantially all damage by the target pest. For example, if 10% of transgenic corn suffered com rootworm damage of 4 or higher on the lowa 1 - 6 Scale, while 80% of non-transgenic corn suffered damage of 4 or higher, then it could be said that the damage to the transgenic corn was (10/80) x 100 = 12.5% of that of the non-transgenic corn. For the purposes of the present invention, it will be understood that a transgenic event in corn is within the preferred range of effectiveness level if corn having such event suffers from about 5% to about 50% of the damage suffered by non-transgenic com due to the same pest under the same conditions, (t is more preferred that corn having such transgenic event suffers from about 10% to about 40% of the damage suffered by non-transgenic corn by the same pest under the same conditions, even more preferred is damage of from about 15% to about 30%. and yet more preferred is damage of from about 20% to about 30% of the damage suffered by non-transgenic corn by the same pest under the same conditions. As used herein, when the term "about" is used to describe the degree of damage to corn, it is to be understood that the degree of damage can be above or below the limits described by as much as 1% or 2% and still be considered to be within the ranges described. By way of example, a level of 4.5% damage would be regarded as being "about 5%".<br>
Without wishing to be bound to this or any other theory, It is believed that the pesticidal seed treatment can provide significant advantages when combined with a transgenic event that provides protection that is within the preferred effectiveness range against a<br><br>
target pest. In addition, it is believed that there are situations that are well known to those having skill in the art, where it is advantageous to have such transgenic events within the preferred range of effectiveness.<br>
The present invention also includes seeds and plants having more that one transgenic event. Such combinations are referred to as "stacked" transgenic events. These stacked transgenic events can be events that are directed at the same target pest, or they can be directed at different target pests. In one preferred method, a seed having the ability to express a Cry 3 protein also has the ability to express at least one other insecticidal protein that is different from a Cry 3 protein.<br>
In another preferred method, the seed having the ability to express a Cry 3 protein also has a transgenic event that provides herbicide tolerance.  It is more preferred that the transgenic event that provides herbicide tolerance is an event that provides resistance to glyphosate, N- (phosphonomethyl) glycine, including the isopropylamine salt form of such herbicide, even more preferred is the transgenic event that is effective to provide the herbicide resistance of ROUNDUP READY® plants and seeds available from Monsanto Co.,<br>
St. Louis. MO.<br>
In the present method, a corn seed having a transgenic event is treated with thiamethoxam (3-[(2-chloro-5-thiazolyl)mehthyl]tetrahydro-5-methyl-N-nitro-4H-1.3,5-oxadiazin-4-imine; CAS RN 153719-23-4; and described in EP 580553. as well as in The Pesticide Manual, Id., at 896).<br>
When an insecticide is described herein, it is to be understood that the description is intended to include salt forms of the insecticide as well as any isomeric and/or tautomeric form of the insecticide that exhibits the same insecticidal activity as the form of the insecticide that is described.<br><br>
The insecticides that are useful in the present method can be of any grade or purity that pass in the trade as such insecticide. Other materials that accompany the insecticides in commercial preparations as impurities can be tolerated in the subject methods and compositions, as long as such other materials do not destabilize the composition or significantly reduce or destroy the activity of any of the insecticide components or the transgenic event against the target pest(s)- One of ordinary skill in the art of the production of insecticides can readily identify those impurities that can be tolerated and those that cannot.<br>
It has been found that the present method is useful to protect seeds and plants against a wide array of agricultural pests, including insects, mites, fungi, yeasts, molds, bacteria, nematodes, weeds, and parasitic and saprophytic plants.<br>

It has been found that the present invention is particularly effective when the insect pest is a Diabrotica spp., and especially when the pest is Diabrotica virgifera, Diabrotica barberi, or Diabrotica undecimpunctata.<br><br>
Another application wherein the present invention is believed to be particularly effective is when the pesticide has activity against a weed or a parasitic or saprophytic plant and the transgenic event has activity against a member selected from the group consisting of Diabrotica virgifera, Diabrotica barben and Diabrotica undecimpunctata. This is believed to be more preferred useful when the weed or a parasitic or saprophytic plant is the African plant known as "Striga", and even more preferred when the pesticide is ROUNDUP® (available from Monsanto Company).<br>
In the method of the present invention, thiamethoxam is applied to a transgenic corn seed. Although it is believed that the present method can be applied to a transgenic corn seed in any physiological state, it is preferred that the seed be in a sufficiently durable state that it incurs no damage during the treatment process. Typically, the seed would be a seed that had been harvested from the field; removed from the plant; and separated from any cob, stalk, outer husk, and surrounding pulp or other non-seed plant material. The seed would preferably also be biologically stable to the extent that the treatment would cause no biological damage to the seed. In one embodiment, for example, the treatment can be applied to seed corn that has been harvested, cleaned and dried to a moisture content below about 15% by weight  In an alternative embodiment, the seed can be one that has been dried and then primed with water and/or another material and then re-dried before or during the treatment with the pesticide. Within the limitations just described, it is believed that the treatment can be applied to the seed at any time between harvest of the seed and sowing of the seed. As used herein, the term "unsown seed" is meant to include seed at any period between the harvest of the seed and the sowing of the seed in the ground for the purpose of germination and growth of the plant.<br>
When it is said that unsown seed is "treated" with the pesticide, such treatment is not meant to include those practices in which the<br><br>
pesticide is applied to the soil, rather than to the seed. For example,. such treatments as the application of the pesticide in bands, 'T"-bands. or in-furrow, at the same time as the seed is sowed are not considered to be included in the present invention.<br>
The pesticide, or combination of pesticides, can be applied "neat", that is. without any diluting or additional components present. However, the pesticide is typically applied to the seeds in the form of a pesticide formulation. This formulation may contain one or more other desirable components including but not limited to liquid diluents, binders to serve as a matrix for the pesticide, fillers for protecting the seeds during stress conditions, and plasticizers to improve flexibility, adhesion and/or spreadability of the coating. In addition, for oily pesticide formulations containing little or no filler, it may be desirable to add to the formulation drying agents such as calcium carbonate, kaolin or bentonite clay, perlite. diatomaceous earth or any other adsorbent material. Use of such components in seed treatments is known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5.876.739. The skilled artisan can readily select desirable components to use in the pesticide formulation depending on the seed type to be treated and the particular pesticide that is selected. In addition, readily available commercial formulations of known pesticides may be used, as demonstrated in the examples below.<br>
The seeds may also be treated with one or more of the following ingredients; other pesticides, including compounds which act only below the ground; fungicides, such as captan, thiram, metalaxyl, (methoxam = resolved isomer of metalaxyl), fludioxonil, oxadixyl, and isomers of each of those materials, and the like; herbicides, including compounds selected from carbamates, thiocarbamates, acetamides, triazines, dinitroanilines. glycerol ethers, pyridazinones, uracils, phenoxys, ureas, and benzoic acids; herbicidal safeners such as benzoxazine, benzhydryl derivatives, N,N-diallyl dichloroacetamide. various dihaloacyl, oxazolidinyl and thiazolidinyl compounds, ethanone,<br><br>
naphthalic anhydride compounds, and oxime derivatives; fertilizers; and biocontrol agents such as naturally-occurring or recombinant bacteria and fungi from the genera Rhizobium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Trichoderma, Glomus, Gliocladium and mycorrhizal fungi. These ingredients may be added as a separate layer on the seed or alternatively may be added as part of the pesticide composition.<br>
Preferably, the amount of the novel composition or other ingredients used in the seed treatment should not inhibit generation of the seed, or cause phytotoxic damage to the seed.<br>
The pesticide formulation that is used to treat the transgenic corn seed in the present invention can be in the form of a suspension; emulsion; slurry of particles in an aqueous medium (e.g., water); wettable powder; wettable granules (dry flowable); and dry granules. If formulated as a suspension or slurry, the concentration of the active ingredient in the formulation is preferably about 0.5% to about 99% by weight (w/w), preferably 5-40%.<br>
As mentioned above, other conventional inactive or inert ingredients can be incorporated into the formulation. Such inert ingredients include but are not limited to: conventional sticking agents, dispersing agents such as methylcellulose (Methocel A15LV or Methocel A15C, for example, serve as combined dispersant/sticking agents for use in seed treatments), polyvinyl alcohol {e.g., Elvanol  51-05), lecithin (e,g., Yelkinol P), polymeric dispersants (e,g., polyvinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate PVPA/A S-630), thickeners (e.g., clay thickeners such as Van Ge! B to improve viscosity and reduce settling of particle suspensions), emulsion stabilizers, surfactants, antifreeze compounds (e.g., urea), dyes, colorants, and the like. Further inert ingredients useful in the present invention can be found in McCutcheon's, vol. 1, "Emulslfiers and Detergents," MC Publishing Company, Glen Rock, New Jersey, U.S.A., 1996.   Additional inert ingredients useful in the present invention can be found in<br><br>
McCutcheon's, vol. 2, "FunctionalMaterials,"MC Publishing Company, Glen Rock. New Jersey, U.SA. 1996.<br>
The pesticides and pesticide formulations of the present invention can be applied to seeds by any standard seed treatment methodology, including but not limited to mixing in a container (e.g., a bottle or bag), mechanical application, tumbling, spraying, and immersion.   Any conventional active or inert material can be used for contacting seeds with pesticides according to the present invention, such as conventional film-coating materials including but not limited to water-based film coating materials such as Sepiret (Seppic, Inc, Fairfield, NJ) and Opacoat (Berwind Phanm. Services. Westpoint. PA).<br>
The subject pesticides can be applied to a seed as a component of a seed coating. Seed coating methods and compositions that are known in the art are useful when they are modified by the addition of one of the embodiments of the combination of pesticides of the present invention.  Such coating methods and apparatus for their application are disclosed in, for example. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,918,413. 5,891.246, 5,554.445. 5.389,399, 5.107,787, 5,080.925, 4,759.945 and 4.465.017. Seed coating composttions are disclosed, for example, in US. Patent Nos. 5.939,356. 5,882,713. 5.876,739, 5.849.320, 5,834.447, 5.791.084, 5,661,103, 5,622,003, 5.580,544. 5,328.942, 5,300.127, 4,735,015. 4.634.587. 4,383.391, 4.372,080, 4,339,456, 4.272,417 and 4,245,432, among others.<br>
Useful seed coatings contain one or more binders and at least one of the subject combinations of pesticides.<br>
Binders that are useful in the present invention preferably comprise an adhesive polymer that may be natural or synthetic and is without phytotoxic effect on the seed to be coated. The binder may be selected from polyvinyl acetates; polyvinyl acetate copolymers; ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers; polyvinyl alcohols; polyvinyl alcohol copolymers; celluloses, including ethylcelluloses, methylcelluloses. hydroxymethylcelluloses, hydroxypropylcelluloses<br><br>
and carboxymethylcellulose; polyvinylpyrolidones; polysaccharides, including starch, modified starch, dextrins, maltodextrins, alginate and chitosans; fats; oils; proteins, including gelatin and zeins; gunn arables; shellacs; vinylidene chloride and vinylidene chloride copolymers; calcium lignosulfonates; acrylic copolymers; polyvinylacrylates; polyethylene oxide; acrylamide polymers and copolymers; polyhydroxyethyl acrylate. methylacrylamide monomers; and polychloroprene.<br>
It is preferred that the binder be selected so that it can serve as a matrix for the subject pesticides. While the binders disclosed above may all be useful as a matrix, the specific binder will depend upon the properties of the combination of pesticides. The term "matrix", as used herein, means a continuous solid phase of one or more binder compounds throughout which is distributed as a discontinuous phase one or more of the subject pesticides. Optionally, a filler and/or other components can also be present in the matrix. The term matrix is to be understood to include what may be viewed as a matrix system, a reservoir system or a microencapsulated system. In general, a matrix system consists of pesticides of the present invention and filler uniformly dispersed within a polymer, while a reservoir system consists of a separate phase comprising the subject pesticides, that is physically dispersed within a surrounding, rate-limiting, polymeric phase. Microencapsulation includes the coating of small particles or droplets of liquid, but also to dispersions in a solid matrix.<br>
The amount of binder in the coating can vary, but will be in the range of about 0.01 to about 25% of the weight of the seed, more preferably from about 0.05 to about 15%, and even more preferably from about 0.1% to about 10%.<br>
As mentioned above, the matrix can optionally include a filler. The filler can be an absorbent or an inert filler, such as are known in the art, and may include woodflours, clays, activated carbon, sugars, diatomaceous earth, cereal flours, fine-grain inorganic solids, calcium<br><br>
carbonate, and the like. Clays and inorganic solids, which may be used, include calcium bentonite, kaolin, china clay, talc, perlite. mica, vermiculite, silicas, quartz powder, montmoriJIonite and mixtures thereof. Sugars, which may be useful, include dextrin and maltodextrin. Cereal flours include wheat flour, oat flour and barley flour.<br>
The filler is selected so that it will provide a proper microclimate for the seed, for example the filler is used to increase the loading rate of the active ingredients and to adjust the control-release of the active ingredients. The filler can aid in the production or process of coating the seed. The amount of filler can vary, but generally the weight of the filler components will be in the range of about 0.05 to about 75% of the seed weight, more preferably about 0.1 to about 50%, and even more preferably about 0.5% to 15%.<br>
The pesticides that are useful in the coating are those pesticides that are described herein. The amount of pesticide that is used for the treatment of the seed will vary depending upon the type of seed and the type of active ingredients, but the treatment will comprise contacting the seeds with an amount of the pesticide that is pesticidally effective. When insects are the target pest, that amount will be an amount of the insecticide that is insecticidally effective. As used herein, an insecticidally effective amount means that amount of insecticide that will kill insect pests in the larvae or pupal state of growth, or will consistently reduce or retard the amount of damage produced by insect pests.<br>
In general, the amount of thiamethoxam that is applied to the seed in the treatment will range from about 10 gm to about 2000 gm of the active ingredient of the pesticide per 100 kg of the weight of the seed. Preferably, the amount of pesticide will be within the range of about 50 gm to about 1000 gm active per 100 kg of seed, more preferably within the range of about 100 gm to about 600 gm active per 100 kg of seed, and even more preferably within the range of about<br><br>
200 gm to about 500 gm of active per 100 kg of seed weight. Alternatively, it has been found to be preferred that the amount of the pesticide be over about 60 gm of the active ingredient of the pesticide per 100 kg of the seed, and more preferably over about 80 gm per 100 kg of seed.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention the transgenic event comprises the ability to express a Cry3Bb.l 1231 protein or a Cry3Bb.11098 protein, and the pesticide is thiamethoxam.<br>
The pesticides that are used in the treatment must not inhibit germination of the seed and should be efficacious in protecting the seed and/or the plant during that time in the target insect's life cycle in which it causes injury to the seed or plant. In general, the coating will be efficacious for approximately 0 to 120 days after sowing.<br>
In the subject invention, the pesticides be applied to the seed in the form of a coating. The use of a coating is particularly effective in accommodating high pesticidal loads, as can be required to treat typically refractory pests, such as corn rootworm, while at the same time preventing unacceptable phytotoxicity due to the increased pesticidal load.<br>
Optionally, a plasticizer can be used in the coating formulation. Plasticizers are typically used to make the film that is formed by the coating layer more flexible, to improve adhesion and spreadability, and to improve the speed of processing. Improved film flexibility is important to minimize chipping, breakage or flaking during storage, handling or sowing processes. Many plasticizers may be used, however, useful plasticizers include polyethylene glycol, glycerol, butylbenzylphthalate. glycol benzoates and related compounds. The range of plasticizer in the coating layer will be in the range of from bout 0.1 to about 20% by weight.<br>
When the pesticide used in the coating is an oily type formulation and little or no filler is present, it may be useful to hasten the drying process by drying the formulation. This optional step may<br><br>
be accomplished by means will known in the art and can include the addition of calcium carbonate, kaolin or bentonite clay, periite, diatomaceous earth, or any absorbent material that is added preferably concurrently with the pesticidal coating layer to absorb the oil or excess moisture. The amount of calcium carbonate or related compounds necessary to effectively provide a dry coating will be in the range of about 0,5 to about 10% of the weight of the seed.<br>
The coatings formed with the pesticide are preferably of the type that are capable of effecting a slow rate of release of the pesticide by diffusion or movement through the matrix to the surrounding medium.<br>
In addition to the coating layer, the seed may be treated with one or more of the following ingredients: other pesticides including fungicides and herbicides; herbicidal safeners; fertilizers and/or biocontrol agents. These ingredients may be added as a separate layer or alternatively may be added in the pesticidal coating layer.<br>
The pesticide formulation may be applied to the seeds using conventional coating techniques and machines, such as fluidized bed techniques, the roller mill method, rotostatic seed treaters, and drum coaters. Other methods, such as spouted beds may also be useful. The seeds may be presized before coating. After coating, the seeds are typically dried and then transferred to a sizing machine for sizing. Such procedures are known in the art.<br>
The pesticide-treated seeds may also be enveloped with a film overcoating to protect the pesticide coating. Such overcoatings are known in the art and may be applied using conventional fluidized bed and drum film coating techniques.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a pesticide can be introduced onto or into a seed by use of solid matrix priming. For example, a quantity of the pesticide can be mixed with a solid matrix material and then the seed can be placed into contact with the solid matrix material for a period to allow the pesticide to be introduced to the seed. The seed can then optionally be separated from the solid<br><br>
matrix material and stored or used, or the mixture of solid matrix material plus seed can be stored or planted directly. Solid matrix materials which are useful in the present invention include polyacrylamide. starch, clay, silica, alumina, soil, sand, polyurea, polyacrylate, or any other material capable of absorbing or adsorbing the pesticide for a time and releasing that pesticide into or onto the seed. It is useful to make sure that the pesticide and the solid matrix material are compatible with each other. For example, the solid matrix material should be chosen so that it can release the pesticide at a reasonable rate, for example over a period of minutes, hours, or days.<br>
The present invention further embodies imbibition as another method of treating seed with the pesticide. For example, plant seed can be combined for a period of time with a solution comprising from about 1 % by weight to about 75% by weight of the pesticide in a solvent such as water. Preferably the concentration of the solution is from about 5% by weight to about 50% by weight, more preferably from about 10% by weight to about 25% by weight. During the period that the seed is combined with the solution, the seed takes up (imbibes) a portion of the pesticide. Optionally, the mixture of plant seed and solution can be agitated, for example by shaking, rolling, tumbling, or other means. After imbibition, the seed can be separated from the solution and optionally dried, for example by patting or air drying.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a powdered pesticide can be mixed directly with seed. Optionally, a sticking agent can be used to adhere the powder to the seed surface. For example, a quantity of seed can be mixed with a sticking agent and optionally agitated to encourage uniform coating of the seed with the sticking agent. The seed coated with the sticking agent can then be mixed with the powdered pesticide. The mixture can be agitated, for example by tumbling, to encourage contact of the sticking agent with the powdered pesticide, thereby causing the powdered pesticide to stick to the seed.<br><br>
The present invention also provides a transgenic corn seed that has been treated with a pesticide by the method described above.<br>
The treated seeds of the present invention can be used for the propagation of corn plants in the same manner as conventional treated corn seed. The treated seeds can be stored, handled, sowed and tilled in the same manner as any other pesticide treated seed. Appropriate safety measures should be taken to limit contact of the treated seed with humans, food or feed materials, water and birds and wild or domestic animals.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Production of corn seed having a transgenic event effective against corn rootworm and treatment of such seed with thiamethoxam (Cruiser©).<br>
Corn seeds can be prepared to express Bacillus thuringlensis endotoxin Cry3Bb.11231 or Cry3Bb.11098 by the methods described<br><br>
for these respective events in WO 99/31248, or in U.S. Patent No. 6.023.013.<br>
Corn seeds of the same hybrid species, with and without the respective transgenic events, can be treated with thiamethoxam (available as CRUISER® from Novartis) as follows:<br>
A seed treatment formulation of the desired pesticide is prepared by mixing a measured amount in water as a carrier and applying the formulation for one minute at room temperature to a measured weight of corn seed in a rotostatic seed treater. The respective weights of the pesticide preparation and the corn seed are calculated to provide the desired rate of treatment of pesticide on the seed. The pesticide is mixed into sufficient water to permit efficient distribution of the formulation to all of the seeds in the batch while minimizing loss of treatment formulation due to lack of uptake of the formulation by the seeds. Treated seeds are allowed to sit uncapped for at least four hours before planting.<br>
When the seeds are treated with thiamethoxam, a sufficient amount of CRUISER® Is thoroughly mixed into water to form a seed treatment formulation, and the formulation Is applied to a weight of corn seed to provide treatment levels of 300 grams thiamethoxam per 100 kg of seed (.75 mg thiamethoxam/kernel), or 400 grams thiamethoxam per 100 kg of seed (1.0 mg thiamethoxam/kernel).<br>

All seed treatments with pesticides are carried out as described in Example 1. In seed treatment number 1 and 2, Gaucho® (imidacloprid) can be used for wire worm protection, but at levels sufficiently low that it would be expected to have no effect on corn rootworms {i.e., at a treatment level of about 60 gm of active/100 kg seed or 0.16 mg active/kernel), otherwise, seed receiving treatment number 2 should have only transgenic event Cry3Bb.l 1231 and no pesticide treatment that would be expected to be effective against corn rootworm.<br>
For seeds having treatments numbered 3 and 4, the pesticides are applied by the methods described in Example 1, For seeds having treatment numbers 5 and 6, commercially available Force® 3G and Lorsban® 15G are applied to the soil in a 5" band at the time of sowing to provide a comparison with standard practices. The levels of application are as shown and are within the ranges recommended for standard commercial practice.<br>
Corn seeds to be tested should be planted and grown at several different locations according to the protocol described above.<br>
The determination of damage by corn rootworm can be made according to the following protocol. At stage \/4 - V6, an evaluation of early stand is made by counting the number of plants per acre. At stage VT-RI. an evaluation of corn rootworm damage can be carried out by methods that are well known in the industry, and damage by corn rootworm is reported according to the Iowa 1 - 6 rating system   In<br><br>
that system, the root systems of 10 corn plants per plot are recovered and scored using the 1 - 6 rating scale, where: 1 = no injury or only a few minor feeding scars, 2 = feeding injury evident, but no roots eaten back to 1 1/2 inches of the plant, 3 = at least one root eaten off to within 1 1/2 inches of the plant, but never an entire node of roots destroyed, 4 = one node of roots eaten back to within 1 1/2 inches of the plants 5 = two nodes (circles) of roots eaten back to within 1 1/2 inches of the plant, 6 = three nodes (circles) of roots eaten back to within 11/2 inches of the plant.<br>
It is believed that the data that is obtained from these techniques would show that transgenic seeds that were treated with thiamethoxam were more resistant to corn rootworm damage than the transgenic seeds without such pesticide treatment. Moreover, it is believed that such tests would show that combination treatments (of transgenic event plus pesticide treatment) were more efficacious that conventional surface banding with either FORCE® or LORSBAN®.<br>
