METHODS AND APPARATUSES FOR ENCODING AND<br>
DECODING OBJECT-BASED AUDIO SIGNALS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The audio signal decoding method includes extracting a downmix signal and object-<br>
based side information from an audio signal; generating a modified downmix signal<br>
based on the downmix signal and extracted information which is extracted from the<br>
object-based side information; generating channel-based side information based on the<br>
object-based side information and control data for rendering the downmix signal; and<br>
generating a multi-channel audio signal based on the modified downmix signal and the<br>
channel-based side information.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general, in multi-channel audio encoding and decoding techniques, a number of<br>
channel signals of a multi-channel signal are downmixed into fewer channel signals,<br>
side information regarding the original channel signals is transmitted, and a multichannel<br>
signal having as many channels as the original multi-channel signal is<br>
restored.<br>
Object-based audio encoding and decoding techniques are basically similar to multichannel<br>
audio encoding and decoding techniques in terms of downmixing several<br>
sound sources into fewer sound source signals and transmitting side information<br>
regarding the original sound sources. However, in object-based audio encoding and<br>
decoding techniques, object signals, which are basic elements (e.g., the sound of a<br>
musical instrument or a human voice) of a channel signal, are treated the same as<br>
channel signals in multi-channel audio encoding and decoding techniques and can thus<br>
be coded.<br>
In other words, in object-based audio encoding and decoding techniques, each object<br>
signal is deemed the entity to be coded. In this regard, object-based audio encoding and<br>
decoding techniques are different from multi-channel audio encoding and decoding<br>
techniques in which a multi-channel audio coding operation is performed simply based<br>
on inter-channel information regardless of the number of elements of a channel signal<br>
to be coded.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown.<br>
An audio encoding method and apparatus and an audio decoding method and<br>
apparatus according to the present invention may be applied to object- based audio<br>
processing operations, but the present invention is not restricted to this. In other words,<br>
the audio encoding method and apparatus and the audio decoding method and<br>
apparatus may be applied to various signal processing operations other than object-<br>
based audio processing operations.<br>
 <br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a typical object-based audio encoding/decoding system.<br>
In general, audio signals input to an object-based audio encoding apparatus do not<br>
correspond to channels of a multi-channel signal but are independent object signals. In<br>
this regard, an object-based audio encoding apparatus is differentiated from a multichannel<br>
audio encoding apparatus to which channel signals of a multi-channel signal<br>
are input.<br>
For example, channel signals such as a front left channel signal and a front right<br>
channel signal of a 5.1-channel signal may be input to a multi-channel audio signal,<br>
whereas object audio signals such as a human voice or the sound of a musical<br>
instrument (e.g., the sound of a violin or a piano) which are smaller entities than<br>
channel signals may be input to an object-based audio encoding apparatus.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the object-based audio encoding/decoding system includes an<br>
object-based audio encoding apparatus and an object-based audio decoding apparatus.<br>
The object-based audio encoding apparatus includes an object encoder 100, and the<br>
object-based audio decoding apparatus includes an object decoder 111 and a renderer<br>
113.<br>
The object encoder 100 receives N object audio signals, and generates an object-<br>
based downmix signal with one or more channels and side information including a<br>
number of pieces of information extracted from the N object audio signals such as<br>
energy difference, phase difference, and correlation value. The side information and<br>
the object-based downmix signal are incorporated into a single bitstream, and the<br>
bitstream is transmitted to the object-based decoding apparatus.<br>
The side information may include a flag indicating whether to perform channel-based<br>
audio coding or object-based audio coding, and thus, it may be determined whether to<br>
perform channel-based audio coding or object-based audio coding based on the flag of<br>
the side information. The side information may also include envelope information,<br>
grouping information, silent period information, and delay information regarding<br>
object signals. The side information may also include object level differences<br>
informaion, inter-object cross correlation information, downmix gain information,<br>
downmix channel level difference information, and absolute object energy in-<br>
foramtion.<br>
The object decoder 111 receives the object-based downmix signal and the side information<br>
from the object-based audio encoding apparatus, and restores object signals<br>
having similar properties to those of the N object audio signals based on the object-<br>
based downmix signal and the side information. The object signals generated by the<br>
object decoder 111 have not yet been allocated to any position in a multi-channel<br>
space. Thus, the renderer 113 allocates each of the object signals generated by the<br>
object decoder 111 to a predetermined position in a multi-channel space and<br>
 <br>
determines the levels of the object signals so that the object signals can be reproduced<br>
from respective corresponding positions designated by the renderer 113 with respective<br>
corresponding levels determined by the renderer 113. Control information regarding<br>
each of the object signals generated by the object decoder 111 may vary over time, and<br>
thus, the spatial positions and the levels of the object signals generated by the object<br>
decoder 111 may vary according to the control information.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an audio decoding apparatus 120 according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, the audio decoding<br>
apparatus 120 includes an object decoder 121, a renderer 123, and a parameter<br>
converter 125. The audio decoding apparatus 120 may also include a demultiplexer<br>
(not shown) which extracts a downmix signal and side information from a bitstream<br>
input thereto, and this will apply to all audio decoding apparatuses according to other<br>
embodiments of the present invention.<br>
The object decoder 121 generates a number of object signals based on a downmix<br>
signal and modified side information provided by the parameter converter 125. The<br>
renderer 123 allocates each of the object signals generated by the object decoder 121 to<br>
a predetermined position in a multi-channel space and determines the levels of the<br>
object signals generated by the object decoder 121 according to control information.<br>
The parameter converter 125 generates the modified side information by combining<br>
the side information and the control information. Then, the parameter converter 125<br>
transmits the modified side information to the object decoder 121.<br>
The object decoder 121 may be able to perform adaptive decoding by analyzing the<br>
control information in the modified side information.<br>
For example, if the control information indicates that a first object signal and a<br>
second object signal are allocated to the same position in a multi-channel space and<br>
have the same level, a typical audio decoding apparatus may decode the first and<br>
second object signals separately, and then arrange them in a multi-channel space<br>
through a mixing/rendering operation.<br>
On the other hand, the object decoder 121 of the audio decoding apparatus 120 learns<br>
from the control information in the modified side information that the first and second<br>
object signals are allocated to the same position in a multi-channel space and have the<br>
same level as if they were a single sound source. Accordingly, the object decoder 121<br>
decodes the first and second object signals by treating them as a single sound source<br>
without decoding them separately. As a result, the complexity of decoding decreases.<br>
In addition, due to a decrease in the number of sound sources that need to be<br>
processed, the complexity of mixing/rendering also decreases.<br>
The audio decoding apparatus 120 may be effectively used in the situation when the<br>
number of object signals is greater than the number of output channels because a<br>
 <br>
plurality of object signals are highly likely to be allocated to the same spatial position.<br>
Alternatively, the audio decoding apparatus 120 may be used in the situation when<br>
the first object signal and the second object signal are allocated to the same position in<br>
a multi-channel space but have different levels. In this case, the audio decoding<br>
apparatus 120 decode the first and second object signals by treating the first and<br>
second object signals as a single, instead of decoding the first and second object<br>
signals separately and transmitting the decoded first and second object signals to the<br>
Tenderer 123. More specifically, the object decoder 121 may obtain information<br>
regarding the difference between the levels of the first and second object signals from<br>
the control information in the modified side information, and decode the first and<br>
second object signals based on the obtained information. As a result, even if the first<br>
and second object signals have different levels, the first and second object signals can<br>
be decoded as if they were a single sound source.<br>
Still alternatively, the object decoder 121 may adjust the levels of the object signals<br>
generated by the object decoder 121 according to the control information. Then, the<br>
object decoder 121 may decode the object signals whose levels are adjusted. Ac-<br>
cordingly, the renderer 123 does not need to adjust the levels of the decoded object<br>
signals provided by the object decoder 121 but simply arranges the decoded object<br>
signals provided by the object decoder 121 in a multi-channel space. In short, since the<br>
object decoder 121 adjusts the levels of the object signals generated by the object<br>
decoder 121 according to the control information, the Tenderer 123 can readily arrange<br>
the object signals generated by the object decoder 121 in a multi-channel space without<br>
the need to additionally adjust the levels of the object signals generated by the object<br>
decoder 121. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the complexity of mixing/rendering.<br>
According to the embodiment of FIG. 2, the object decoder of the audio decoding<br>
apparatus 120 can adaptively perform a decoding operation through the analysis of the<br>
control information, thereby reducing the complexity of decoding and the complexity<br>
of mixing/rendering. A combination of the above-described methods performed by the<br>
audio decoding apparatus 120 may be used.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an audio decoding apparatus 130 according to a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 3, the audio decoding<br>
apparatus 130 includes an object decoder 131 and a Tenderer 133. The audio decoding<br>
apparatus 130 is characterized by providing side information not only to the object<br>
decoder 131 but also to the Tenderer 133.<br>
The audio decoding apparatus 130 may effectively perform a decoding operation<br>
even when there is an object signal corresponding to a silent period. For example,<br>
second through fourth object signals may correspond to a music play period during<br>
which a musical instrument is played, and a first object signal may correspond to a<br>
 <br>
silent period during which an accompaniment is played. In this case, information<br>
indicating which of a plurality of object signals corresponds to a silent period may be<br>
included in side information, and the side information may be provided to the renderer<br>
133 as well as to the object decoder 131.<br>
The object decoder 131 may minimize the complexity of decoding by not decoding<br>
an object signal corresponding to a silent period. The object decoder 131 sets an object<br>
signal corresponding to a value of 0 and transmits the level of the object signal to the<br>
renderer 133. In general, object signals having a value of 0 are treated the same as<br>
object signals having a value, other than 0, and are thus subjected to a mixing/<br>
rendering operation.<br>
On the other hand, the audio decoding apparatus 130 transmits side information<br>
including information indicating which of a plurality of object signals corresponds to a<br>
silent period to the renderer 133 and can thus prevent an object signal corresponding to<br>
a silent period from being subjected to a mixing/rendering operation performed by the<br>
renderer 133. Therefore, the audio decoding apparatus 130 can prevent an unnecessary<br>
increase in the complexity of mixing/rendering.<br>
The renderer 133 may use mixing parameter information which is included in control<br>
information to localize a sound image of each object signal at a stereo scene. The<br>
mixing parameter information may include amplitude information only or both<br>
amplitude information and time information. The mixing parameter information affects<br>
not only the localization of stereo sound images but also the psychoacoustic perception<br>
of a spatial sound quality by a user.<br>
For example, upon comparing two sound images which are generated using a time<br>
panning method and an amplitude panning method, respectively, and reproduced at the<br>
same location using a 2-channel stereo speaker, it is recognized that the amplitude<br>
panning method can contribute to a precise localization of sound images, and that the<br>
time panning method can provide natural sounds with a profound feeling of space.<br>
Thus, if the renderer 133 only uses the amplitude panning method to arrange object<br>
signals in a multi-channel space, the renderer 133 may be able to precisely localize<br>
each sound image, but may not be able to provide as profound a feeling of sound as<br>
when using the time panning method. Users may sometime prefer a precise lo-<br>
calization of sound images to a profound feeling of sound or vice versa according to<br>
the type of sound sources.<br>
FIGS. 4(a) and 4(b) explains the influence of intensity (amplitude difference) and a<br>
time difference on the localization of sound images as performed in the reproduction of<br>
signals with a 2-channel stereo speaker. Referring to FIGS. 4(a) and 4(b), a sound<br>
image may be localized at a predetermined angle according to an amplitude difference<br>
and a time difference which are independent from each other. For example, an<br>
 <br>
amplitude difference of about 8 dB or a time difference of about 0.5 ms, which is<br>
equivalent to the amplitude difference of 8 dB, may be used in order to localize a<br>
sound image at an angle of 20 . Therefore, even if only an amplitude difference is<br>
provided as mixing parameter information, it is possible to obtain various sounds with<br>
different properties by converting the amplitude difference into a time difference<br>
which is equivalent to the amplitude difference during the localization of sound<br>
images.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates functions regarding the correspondence between amplitude<br>
differences and time differences which are required to localize sound images at angles<br>
of 10 , 20 , and 30 . The function illustrated in FIG. 5 may be obtained based on FIGS.<br>
4(a) and 4(b). Referring to FIG. 5, various amplitude difference-time difference com-<br>
binations may be provided for localizing a sound image at a predetermined position.<br>
For example, assume that an amplitude difference of 8 dB is provided as mixing<br>
parameter information in order to localize a sound image at an angle of 20 . According<br>
to the function illustrated in FIG. 5, a sound image can also be localized at the angle of<br>
20 using the combination of an amplitude difference of 3 dB and a time difference of<br>
0.3 ms. In this case, not only amplitude difference information but also time difference<br>
information may be provided as mixing parameter information, thereby enhancing the<br>
feeling of space.<br>
Therefore, in order to generate sounds with properties desired by a user during a<br>
mixing/rendering operation, mixing parameter information may be appropriately<br>
converted so that whichever of amplitude panning and time panning suits the user can<br>
be performed. That is, if mixing parameter information only includes amplitude<br>
difference information and the user wishes for sounds with a profound feeling of space,<br>
the amplitude difference information may be converted into time difference in-<br>
formation equivalent to the amplitude difference information with reference to psy-<br>
choacoustic data. Alternatively, if the user wishes for both sounds with a profound<br>
feeling of space and a precise localization of sound images, the amplitude difference<br>
information may be converted into the combination of amplitude difference information<br>
and time difference information equivalent to the original amplitude information.<br>
Alternatively, if mixing parameter information only includes time<br>
difference information and a user prefers a precise localization of sound images, the<br>
time difference information may be converted into amplitude difference information<br>
equivalent to the time difference information, or may be converted into the<br>
combination of amplitude difference information and time difference information<br>
which can satisfy the user's preference by enhancing both the precision of localization<br>
of sound images and the feeling of space.<br>
Still alternatively, if mixing parameter information includes both amplitude<br>
 <br>
difference information and time difference information and a user prefers a precise localization<br>
of sound images, the combination of the amplitude difference information<br>
and the time difference information may be converted into amplitude difference information<br>
equivalent to the combination of the original amplitude difference information<br>
and the time difference information. On the other hand, if mixing parameter<br>
information includes both amplitude difference information and time difference information<br>
and a user prefers the enhancement of the feeling of space, the combination<br>
of the amplitude difference information and the time difference information may be<br>
converted into time difference information equivalent the combination of the amplitude<br>
difference information and the original time difference information. Referring to FIG.<br>
6, control information may include mixing/rendering information and harmonic information<br>
regarding one or more object signals. The harmonic information may<br>
include at least one of pitch i nformation, fundamental frequency information, and<br>
dominant frequency band information regarding one or more object signals, and descriptions<br>
of the energy and spectrum of each sub-band of each of the object signals.<br>
The harmonic information may be used to process an object signal during a rendering<br>
operation because the resolution of a renderer which performs its operation in units of<br>
sub-bands is insufficient.<br>
If the harmonic information includes pitch information regarding one or more object<br>
signals, the gain of each of the object signals may be adjusted by attenuating or<br>
strengthening a predetermined frequency domain using a comb filter or an inverse<br>
comb filter. For example, if one of a plurality of object signals is a vocal signal, the<br>
object signals may be used as a karaoke by attenuating only the vocal signal. Alternatively,<br>
if the harmonic information includes dominant frequency domain information<br>
regarding one or more object signals, a process of attenuating or<br>
strengthening a dominant frequency domain may be performed. Still alternatively, if<br>
the harmonic information includes spectrum information regarding one or more object<br>
signals, the gain of each of the object signals may be controlled by performing at-<br>
tenuation or enforcement without being restricted by any sub-band boundaries.<br>
FIG. 7 is a block diagram of an audio decoding apparatus 140 according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 7, the audio decoding<br>
apparatus 140 uses a multi-channel decoder 141, instead of an object decoder and a<br>
renderer, and decodes a number of object signals after the object signals are appropriately<br>
arranged in a multi-channel space.<br>
More specifically, the audio decoding apparatus 140 includes the multi-channel<br>
decoder 141 and a parameter converter 145. The multi-channel decoder 141 generates<br>
a multi-channel signal whose object signals have already been arranged in a multichannel<br>
space based on a down-mix signal and spatial parameter information, which is<br>
 <br>
channel-based side information provided by the parameter converter 145. The<br>
parameter converter 145 analyzes side information and control information transmitted<br>
by an audio encoding apparatus (not shown), and generates the spatial parameter information<br>
based on the result of the analysis. More specifically, the parameter<br>
converter 145 generates the spatial parameter information by combining the side information<br>
and the control information which includes playback setup information and<br>
mixing information. That is, the parameter conversion 145 performs the conversion of<br>
the combination of the side information and the control information to spatial data corresponding<br>
to a One-To-Two (OTT) box or a Two-To-Three (TTT) box.<br>
The audio decoding apparatus 140 may perform a multi-channel decoding operation<br>
into which an object-based decoding operation and a mixing/rendering operation are<br>
incorporated and may thus skip the decoding of each object signal. Therefore, it is<br>
possible to reduce the complexity of decoding and/or mixing/rendering.<br>
For example, when there are 10 object signals and a multi-channel signal obtained<br>
based on the 10 object signals is to be reproduced by a 5.1 channel speaker reproduction<br>
system, a typical object-based audio decoding apparatus generates decoded<br>
signals respectively corresponding the 10 object signals based on a down-mix signal<br>
and side information and then generates a 5.1 channel signal by appropriately<br>
arranging the 10 object signals in a multi-channel space so that the object signals can<br>
become suitable for a 5.1 channel speaker environment. However, it is inefficient to<br>
generate 10 object signals during the generation of a 5.1 channel signal, and this<br>
problem becomes more severe as the difference between the number of object signals<br>
and the number of channels of a multi-channel signal to be generated increases.<br>
On the other hand, according to the embodiment of FIG. 7, the audio decoding<br>
apparatus 140 generates spatial parameter information suitable for a 5.1-channel signal<br>
based on side information and control information, and provides the spatial parameter<br>
information and a downmix signal to the multi-channel decoder 141. Then, the multichannel<br>
decoder 141 generates a 5.1 channel signal based on the spatial parameter information<br>
and the downmix signal. In other words, when the number of channels to be<br>
output is 5.1 channels, the audio decoding apparatus 140 can readily generate a<br>
5.1-channel signal based on a downmix signal without the need to generate 10 object<br>
signals and is thus more efficient than a conventional audio decoding apparatus in<br>
terms of complexity.<br>
The audio decoding apparatus 140 is deemed efficient when the amount of<br>
computation required to calculates spatial parameter information corresponding to each<br>
of an OTT box and a TTT box through the analysis of side information and control information<br>
transmitted by an audio encoding apparatus is less than the amount of<br>
computation required to perform a mixing/rendering operation after the decoding of<br>
 <br>
each object signal.<br>
The audio decoding apparatus 140 may be obtained simply by adding a module for<br>
generating spatial parameter information through the analysis of side information and<br>
control information to a typical multi-channel audio decoding apparatus, and may thus<br>
maintain the compatibility with a typical multi-channel audio decoding apparatus.<br>
Also, the audio decoding apparatus 140 can improve the quality of sound using<br>
existing tools of a typical multi-channel audio decoding apparatus such as an envelope<br>
shaper, a sub-band temporal processing (STP) tool, and a decorrelator. Given all this, it<br>
is concluded that all the advantages of a typical multi-channel audio decoding method<br>
can be readily applied to an object-audio decoding method.<br>
Spatial parameter information transmitted to the multi-channel decoder 141 by the<br>
parameter converter 145 may have been compressed so as to be suitable for being<br>
transmitted. Alternatively, the spatial parameter information may have the same format<br>
as that of data transmitted by a typical multi-channel encoding apparatus. That is, the<br>
spatial parameter information may have been subjected to a Huffman decoding<br>
operation or a pilot decoding operation and may thus be transmitted to each module as<br>
uncompressed spatial cue data. The former is suitable for transmitting the spatial<br>
parameter information to a multi-channel audio decoding apparatus in a remote place,<br>
and the later is convenient because there is no need for a multi-channel audio decoding<br>
apparatus to convert compressed spatial cue data into uncompressed spatial cue data<br>
that can readily be used in a decoding operation.<br>
The configuration of spatial parameter information based on the analysis of side information<br>
and control information may cause a delay between a downmix signal and<br>
the spatial parameter information. In order to address this, an additional buffer may be<br>
provided either for a downmix signal or for spatial parameter information so that the<br>
downmix signal and the spatial parameter information can be synchronized with each<br>
other. These methods, however, are inconvenient because of the requirement to<br>
provide an additional buffer. Alternatively, side information may be transmitted ahead<br>
of a downmix signal in consideration of the possibility of occurrence of a delay<br>
between a downmix signal and spatial parameter information. In this case, spatial<br>
parameter information obtained by combining the side information and control information<br>
does not need to be adjusted but can readily be used.<br>
If a plurality of object signals of a downmix signal have different levels, an artistic<br>
downmix gains (ADG) module which can directly compensate for the downmix signal<br>
may determine the relative levels of the object signals, and each of the object signals<br>
may be allocated to a predetermined position in a multi-channel space using spatial cue<br>
data such as channel level difference information, inter-channel correlation (ICC) information,<br>
and channel prediction coefficient (CPC) information.<br>
 <br>
For example, if control information indicates that a predetermined object signal is to<br>
be allocated to a predetermined position in a multi-channel space and has a higher level<br>
than other object signals, a typical multi-channel decoder may calculate the difference<br>
between the energies of channels of a downmix signal, and divide the downmix signal<br>
into a number of output channels based on the results of the calculation. However, a<br>
typical multi-channel decoder cannot increase or reduce the volume of a certain sound<br>
in a downmix signal. In other words, a typical multi-channel decoder simply distributes<br>
a downmix signal to a number of output channels and thus cannot increase or reduce<br>
the volume of a sound in the downmix signal.<br>
It is relatively easy to allocate each of a number of object signals of a downmix<br>
signal generated by an object encoder to a predetermined position in a multi-channel<br>
space according to control information. However, special techniques are required to<br>
increase or reduce the amplitude of a predetermined object signal. In other words, if a<br>
downmix signal generated by an object encoder is used as it is, it is difficult to reduce<br>
the amplitude of each object signal of the downmix signal.<br>
Therefore, according to an embodiment of the present invention, the relative<br>
amplitudes of object signals may be varied according to control information using an<br>
ADG module 147 illustrated in FIG. 8. More specifically, the amplitude of any one of<br>
a plurality of object signals of a downmix signal transmitted by an object encoder may<br>
be increased or reduced using the ADG module 147. A downmix signal obtained by<br>
compensation performed by the ADG module 147 may be subjected to multi-channel<br>
decoding.<br>
If the relative amplitudes of object signals of a downmix signal are appropriately<br>
adjusted using the ADG module 147, it is possible to perform object decoding using a<br>
typical multi-channel decoder. If a downmix signal generated by an object encoder is a<br>
mono or stereo signal or a multi-channel signal with three or more channels, the<br>
downmix signal may be processed by the ADG module 147. If a downmix signal<br>
generated by an object encoder has two or more channels and a predetermined object<br>
signal that needs to be adjusted by the ADG module 147 only exists in one of the<br>
channels of the downmix signal, the ADG module 147 may be applied only to the<br>
channel including the predetermined object signal, instead of being applied to all the<br>
channels of the downmix signal. A downmix signal processed by the ADG module 147<br>
in the above-described manner may be readily processed using a typical multi-channel<br>
decoder without the need to modify the structure of the multi-channel decoder.<br>
Even when a final output signal is not a multi-channel signal that can be reproduced<br>
by a multi-channel speaker but is a binaural signal, the ADG module 147 may be used<br>
to adjust the relative amplitudes of object signals of the final output signal.<br>
Alternatively to the use of the ADG module 147, gain information specifying a gain<br>
 <br>
value to be applied to each object signal may be included in control information during<br>
the generation of a number of object signals. For this, the structure of a typical multichannel<br>
decoder may be modified. Even though requiring a modification to the<br>
structure of an existing multi-channel decoder, this method is convenient in terms of<br>
reducing the complexity of decoding by applying a gain value to each object signal<br>
during a decoding operation without the need to calculate ADG and to compensate for<br>
each object signal.<br>
FIG. 9 is a block diagram of an audio decoding apparatus 150 according to a fourth<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 9, the audio decoding<br>
apparatus 150 is characterized by generating a binaural signal.<br>
More specifically, the audio decoding apparatus 150 includes a multi-channel<br>
binaural decoder 151, a first parameter converter 157, and a second parameter<br>
converter 159.<br>
The second parameter converter 159 analyzes side information and control information<br>
which are provided by an audio encoding apparatus, and configures spatial<br>
parameter information based on the result of the analysis. The first parameter converter<br>
157 configures binaural parameter information, which can be used by the multichannel<br>
binaural decoder 151, by adding three-dimensional (3D) information such as<br>
head-related transfer function (HRTF) parameters to the spatial parameter information.<br>
The multi-channel binaural decoder 151 generates a virtual three-dimensianl (3D)<br>
signal by applying the virtual 3D parameter information to a downmix signal.<br>
The first parameter converter 157 and the second parameter converter 159 may be<br>
replaced by a single module, i.e., a parameter conversion module 155 which receives<br>
the side information, the control information, and the HRTF parameters and configures<br>
the binaural parameter information based on the side information, the control information,<br>
and the HRTF parameters.<br>
Conventionally, in order to generate a binaural signal for the reproduction of a<br>
downmix signal including 10 object signals with a headphone, an object signal must<br>
generate 10 decoded signals respectively corresponding to the 10 object signals based<br>
on the downmix signal and side information. Thereafter, a Tenderer allocates each of<br>
the 10 object signals to a predetermined position in a multi-channel space with<br>
reference to control information so as to suit a 5-channel speaker environment.<br>
Thereafter, the renderer generates a 5-channel signal that can be reproduced using a<br>
5-channel speaker. Thereafter, the renderer applies HRTF parameters to the 5-channel<br>
signal, thereby generating a 2-channel signal. In short, the above-mentioned conventional<br>
audio decoding method includes reproducing 10 object signals, converting<br>
the 10 object signals into a 5-channel signal, and generating a 2-channel signal based<br>
on the 5-channel signal, and is thus inefficient.<br>
 <br>
On the other hand, the audio decoding apparatus 150 can readily generate a binaural<br>
signal that can be reproduced using a headphone based on object audio signals. In<br>
addition, the audio decoding apparatus 150 configures spatial parameter information<br>
through the analysis of side information and control information, and can thus generate<br>
a binaural signal using a typical multi-channel binaural decoder. Moreover, the audio<br>
decoding apparatus 150 still can use a typical multi-channel binaural decoder even<br>
when being equipped with an incorporated parameter converter which receives side information,<br>
control information, and HRTF parameters and configures binaural<br>
parameter information based on the side information, the control information, and the<br>
HRTF parameters.<br>
FIG. 10 is a block diagram of an audio decoding apparatus 160 according to a fifth<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 10, the audio decoding<br>
apparatus 160 includes a downmix processor 161, a multi-channel decoder 163, and a<br>
parameter converter 165. The downmix processor 161 and the parameter converter 163<br>
may be replaced by a single module 167.<br>
The parameter converter 165 generates spatial parameter information, which can be<br>
used by the multi-channel decoder 163, and parameter information, which can be used<br>
by the downmix processor 161. The downmix processor 161 performs a pre-processing<br>
operation on a downmix signal, and transmits a downmix signal resulting from the preprocessing<br>
operation to the multi-channel decoder 163. The multi-channel decoder 163<br>
performs a decoding operation on the downmix signal transmitted by the downmix<br>
processor 161, thereby outputting a stereo signal, a binaural stereo signal or a multichannel<br>
signal. Examples of the pre-processing operation performed by the downmix<br>
processor 161 include the modification or conversion of a downmix signal in a time<br>
domain or a frequency domain using filtering.<br>
If a downmix signal input to the audio decoding apparatus 160 is a stereo signal, the<br>
downmix signal may have be subjected to downmix preprocessing performed by the<br>
downmix processor 161 before being input to the multi-channel decoder 163 because<br>
the multi-channel decoder 163 cannot map a component of the downmix signal corresponding<br>
to a left channel, which is one of multiple channels, to a right channel,<br>
which is another of the multiple channels. Therefore, in order to shift the position of an<br>
object signal classified into the left channel to the direction of the right channel, the<br>
downmix signal input to the audio decoding apparatus 160 may be preprocessed by the<br>
downmix processor 161, and the preprocessed downmix signal may be input to the<br>
multi-channel decoder 163.<br>
The preprocessing of a stereo downmix signal may be performed based on preprocessing<br>
information obtained from side information and from control information.<br>
FIG. 11 is a block diagram of an audio decoding apparatus 170 according to a sixth<br>
 <br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 11, the audio decoding<br>
apparatus 170 includes a multi-channel decoder 171, a channel processor 173, and a<br>
parameter converter 175.<br>
The parameter converter 175 generates spatial parameter information, which can be<br>
used by the multi-channel decoder 173, and parameter information, which can be used<br>
by the channel processor 173. The channel processor 173 performs a post-processing<br>
operation on a signal output by the multi-channel decoder 173. Examples of the signal<br>
output by the multi-channel decoder 173 include a stereo signal, a binaural stereo<br>
signal and a multi-channel signal.<br>
Examples of the post-processing operation performed by the post processor 173<br>
include the modification and conversion of each channel or all channels of an output<br>
signal. For example, if side information includes fundamental frequency information<br>
regarding a predetermined object signal, the channel processor 173 may remove<br>
harmonic components from the predetermined object signal with reference to the<br>
fundamental frequency information. A multi-channel audio decoding method may not<br>
be efficient enough to be used in a karaoke system. However, if fundamental frequency<br>
information regarding vocal object signals is included in side information and<br>
harmonic components of the vocal object signals are removed during a post-processing<br>
operation, it is possible to realize a high-performance karaoke system using the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 11. The embodiment of FIG. 11 may also be applied to object<br>
signals, other than vocal object signals. For example, it is possible to remove the sound<br>
of a predetermined musical instrument using the embodiment of FIG. 11. Also, it is<br>
possible to amplify predetermined harmonic components using fundamental frequency<br>
information regarding object signals using the embodiment of FIG. 11.<br>
The channel processor 173 may perform additional effect processing on a downmix<br>
signal. Alternatively, the channel processor 173 may add a signal obtained by the<br>
additional effect processing to a signal output by the multi-channel decoder 171. The<br>
channel processor 173 may change the spectrum of an object or modify a downmix<br>
signal whenever necessary. If it is not appropriate to directly perform an effect<br>
processing operation such as reverberation on a downmix signal and to transmit a<br>
signal obtained by the effect processing operation to the multi-channel decoder 171,<br>
the downmix processor 173 may add the signal obtained by the effect processing<br>
operation to the output of the multi-channel decoder 171, instead of performing effect<br>
processing on the downmix signal.<br>
The audio decoding apparatus 170 may be designed to include not only the channel<br>
processor 173 but also a downmix processor. In this case, the downmix processor may<br>
be disposed in front of the multi-channel decoder 173, and the channel processor 173<br>
may be disposed behind the multi-channel decoder 173.<br>
 <br>
FIG. 12 is a block diagram of an audio decoding apparatus 210 according to a<br>
seventh embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 12, the audio decoding<br>
apparatus 210 uses a multi-channel decoder 213, instead of an object decoder.<br>
More specifically, the audio decoding apparatus 210 includes the multi-channel<br>
decoder 213, a transcoder 215, a renderer 217, and a 3D information database 217.<br>
The renderer 217 determines the 3D positions of a plurality of object signals based<br>
on 3D information corresponding to index data included in control information. The<br>
transcoder 215 generates channel-based side information by synthesizing position information<br>
regarding a number of object audio signals to which 3D information is<br>
applied by the renderer 217. The multi-channel decoder 213 outputs a 3D signal by<br>
applying the channel-based side information to a down-mix signal<br>
A head-related transfer function (HRTF) may be used as the 3D information. An<br>
HRTF is a transfer function which describes the transmission of sound waves between<br>
a sound source at an arbitrary position and the eardrum, and returns a value that varies<br>
according to the direction and altitude of the sound source. If a signal with no directivity<br>
is filtered using the HRTF, the signal may be heard as if it were reproduced<br>
from a certain direction.<br>
When an input bitstream is received, the audio decoding apparatus 210 extracts an<br>
object-based downmix signal and object-based parameter information from the input<br>
bitstream using a demultiplexer (not shown). Then, the renderer 217 extracts index<br>
data from control information, which is used to determine the positions of a plurality of<br>
object audio signals, and withdraws 3D information corresponding to the extracted<br>
index data from the 3D information database 219.<br>
More specifically, mixing parameter information, which is included in control information<br>
that is used by the audio decoding apparatus 210, may include not only level<br>
information but also index data necessary for searching for 3D information. The<br>
mixing parameter information may also include time information regarding the time<br>
difference between channels, position information and one or more parameters<br>
obtained by appropriately combining the level information and the time information.<br>
The position of an object audio signal may be determined initially according to<br>
default mixing parameter information, and may be changed later by applying 3D information<br>
corresponding to a position desired by a user to the object audio signal. Alternatively,<br>
if the user wishes to apply a 3D effect only to several object audio signals,<br>
level information and time information regarding other object audio signals to which<br>
the user wishes not to apply a 3D effect may be used as mixing parameter information.<br>
The transcoder 217 generates channel-based side information regarding M channels<br>
by synthesizing object-based parameter information regarding N object signals<br>
transmitted by an audio encoding apparatus and position information of a number of<br>
 <br>
object signals to which 3D information such as an HRTF is applied by the renderer<br>
217.<br>
The multi-channel decoder 213 generates an audio signal based on a downmix signal<br>
and the channel-based side information provided by the transcoder 217, and generates<br>
a 3D multi-channel signal by performing a 3D rendering operation using 3D information<br>
included in the channel-based side information.<br>
FIG. 13 is a block diagram of an audio decoding apparatus 220 according to a eighth<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 13, the audio decoding<br>
apparatus 220 is different from the audio decoding apparatus 210 illustrated in FIG. 12<br>
in that a transcoder 225 transmits channel-based side information and 3D information<br>
separately to a multi-channel decoder 223. In other words, the transcoder 225 of the<br>
audio decoding apparatus 220 obtains channel-based side information regarding M<br>
channels from object-based parameter information regarding N object signals and<br>
transmits the channel-based side information and 3D information, which is applied to<br>
each of the N object signals, to the multi-channel decoder 223, whereas the transcoder<br>
217 of the audio decoding apparatus 210 transmits channel-based side information<br>
including 3D information to the multi-channel decoder 213.<br>
Referring to FIG. 14, channel-based side information and 3D information may<br>
include a plurality of frame indexes. Thus, the multi-channel decoder 223 may<br>
synchronize the channel-based side information and the 3D information with reference<br>
to the frame indexes of each of the channel-based side information and the 3D information,<br>
and may thus apply 3D information to a frame of a bitstream corresponding<br>
to the 3D information. For example, 3D information having index 2 may be applied at<br>
the beginning of frame 2 having index 2.<br>
Since channel-based side information and 3D information both includes frame<br>
indexes, it is possible to effectively determine a temporal position of the channel-based<br>
side information to which the 3D information is to be applied, even if the 3D information<br>
is updated over time. In other words, the transcoder 225 includes 3D information<br>
and a number of frame indexes in channel-based side information, and thus,<br>
the multi-channel decoder 223 can easily synchronize the channel-based side information<br>
and the 3D information.<br>
The downmix processor 231, transcoder 235, renderer 237 and the 3D information<br>
database may be replaced by a single module 239.<br>
FIG. 15 is a block diagram of an audio decoding apparatus 230 according to a ninth<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 15, the audio decoding<br>
apparatus 230 is differentiated from the audio decoding apparatus 220 illustrated in<br>
FIG. 14 by further including a downmix processor 231.<br>
More specifically, the audio decoding apparatus 230 includes a transcoder 235, a<br>
 <br>
Tenderer 237, a 3D information database 239, a multi-channel decoder 233, and the<br>
downmix processor 231. The transcoder 235, the renderer 237, the 3D information<br>
database 239, and the multi-channel decoder 233 are the same as their respective<br>
counterparts illustrated in FIG. 14. The downmix processor 231 performs a preprocessing<br>
operation on a stereo downmix signal for position adjustment. The 3D information<br>
database 239 may be incorporated with the renderer 237. A module for<br>
applying a predetermined effect to a downmix signal may also be provided in the audio<br>
decoding apparatus 230.<br>
FIG. 16 illustrates a block diagram of an audio decoding apparatus 240 according to<br>
a tenth embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 16, the audio decoding<br>
apparatus 240 is differentiated from the audio decoding apparatus 230 illustrated in<br>
FIG. 15 by including a multi-point control unit combiner 241.<br>
That is, the audio decoding apparatus 240, like the audio decoding apparatus 230,<br>
includes a downmix processor 243, a multi-channel decoder 244, a transcoder 245, a<br>
renderer 247, and a 3D information database 249. The multi-point control unit<br>
combiner 241 combines a plurality of bitstreams obtained by object-based encoding,<br>
thereby obtaining a single bitstream. For example, when a first bitstream for a first<br>
audio signal and a second bitstream for a second audio signal are input, the multi-point<br>
control unit combiner 241 extracts a first downmix signal from the first bitstream,<br>
extracts a second downmix signal from the second bitstream and generates a third<br>
downmix signal by combining the first and second downmix signals. In addition, the<br>
multi-point control unit combiner 241 extracts first object-based side information from<br>
the first bitstream, extract second object-based side information from the second<br>
bitstream, and generates third object-based side information by combining the first<br>
object-based side information and the second object-based side information.<br>
Thereafter, the multi-point control unit combiner 241 generates a bitstream by<br>
combining the third downmix signal and the third object-based side information and<br>
outputs the generated bitstream.<br>
Therefore, according to the tenth embodiment of the present invention, it is possible<br>
to efficiently process even signals transmitted by two or more communication partners<br>
compared to the case of encoding or decoding each object signal.<br>
In order for the multi-point control unit combiner 241 to incorporate a plurality of<br>
downmix signals, which are respectively extracted from a plurality of bitstreams and<br>
are associated with different compression codecs, into a single downmix signal, the<br>
downmix signals may need to be converted into pulse code modulation (PCM) signals<br>
or signals in a predetermined frequency domain according to the types of the<br>
compression codecs of the downmix signals, the PCM signals or the signals obtained<br>
by the conversion may need to be combined together, and a signal obtained by the<br>
 <br>
combination may need to be converted using a predetermined compression codec. In<br>
this case, a delay may occur according to whether the downmix signals are incorporated<br>
into a PCM signal or into a signal in the predetermined frequency domain.<br>
The delay, however, may not be able to be properly estimated by a decoder. Therefore,<br>
the delay may need to be included in a bitstream and transmitted along with the<br>
bitstream. The delay may indicate the number of delay samples in a PCM signal or the<br>
number of delay samples in the predetermined frequency domain.<br>
During an object-based audio coding operation, a considerable number of input<br>
signals may sometimes need to be processed compared to the number of input signals<br>
generally processed during a typical multi-channel coding operation (e.g., a<br>
5.1-channel or 7.1-channel coding operation). Therefore, an object-based audio coding<br>
method requires much higher bitrates than a typical channel-based multi-channel audio<br>
coding method. However, since an object-based audio coding method involves the<br>
processing of object signals which are smaller than channel signals, it is possible to<br>
generate dynamic output signals using an object-based audio coding method.<br>
An audio encoding method according to an embodiment of the present invention will<br>
hereinafter be described in detail with reference to FIGS. 17 through 20.<br>
In an object-based audio encoding method, object signals may be defined to<br>
represent individual sounds such as the voice of a human or the sound of a musical<br>
instrument. Alternatively, sounds having similar characteristics such as the sounds of<br>
stringed musical instruments (e.g., a violin, a viola, and a cello), sounds belonging to<br>
the same frequency band, or sounds classified into the same category according to the<br>
directions and angles of their sound sources, may be grouped together, and defined by<br>
the same object signals. Still alternatively, object signals may be defined using the<br>
combination of the above-described methods.<br>
A number of object signals may be transmitted as a downmix signal and side in-<br>
formation. During the creation of information to be transmitted, the energy or power of<br>
a downmix signal or each of a plurality of object signals of the downmix signal is<br>
calculated originally for the purpose of detecting the envelope of the downmix signal.<br>
The results of the calculation may be used to transmit the object signals or the<br>
downmix signal or to calculate the ratio of the levels of the object signals.<br>
A linear predictive coding (LPC) algorithm may be used to lower bitrates. More<br>
specifically, a number of LPC coefficients which represent the envelope of a signal are<br>
generated through the analysis of the signal, and the LPC coefficients are transmitted,<br>
instead of transmitting envelop information regarding the signal. This method is<br>
efficient in terms of bitrates. However, since the LPC coefficients are very likely to be<br>
discrepant from the actual envelope of the signal, this method requires an addition<br>
process such as error correction. In short, a method that involves transmitting envelop<br>
 <br>
information of a signal can guarantee a high quality of sound, but results in a considerable<br>
increase in the amount of information that needs to be transmitted. On the<br>
other hand, a method that involves the use of LPC coefficients can reduce the amount<br>
of information that needs to be transmitted, but requires an additional process such as<br>
error correction and results in a decrease in the quality of sound.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a combination of these<br>
methods may be used. In other words, the envelope of a signal may be represented by<br>
the energy or power of the signal or an index value or another value such as an LPC<br>
coefficient corresponding to the energy or power of the signal.<br>
Envelope information regarding a signal may be obtained in units of temporal<br>
sections or frequency sections. More specifically, referring to FIG. 17, envelope information<br>
regarding a signal may be obtained in units of frames. Alternatively, if a<br>
signal is represented by a frequency band structure using a filter bank such as a<br>
quadrature mirror filter (QMF) bank, envelope information regarding a signal may be<br>
obtained in units of frequency sub-bands, frequency sub-band partitions which are<br>
smaller entities than frequency sub-bands, groups of frequency sub-bands or groups of<br>
frequency sub-band partitions. Still alternatively, a combination of the frame-based<br>
method, the frequency sub-band-based method, and the frequency sub-band partition-<br>
based method may be used within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Still alternatively, given that low-frequency components of a signal generally have<br>
more information than high-frequency components of the signal, envelop information<br>
regarding low-frequency components of a signal may be transmitted as it is, whereas<br>
envelop information regarding high-frequency components of the signal may be<br>
represented by LPC coefficients or other values and the LPC coefficients or the other<br>
values may be transmitted instead of the envelop information regarding the high-<br>
frequency components of the signal. However, low-frequency components of a signal<br>
may not necessarily have more information than high-frequency components of the<br>
signal. Therefore, the above-described method must be flexibly applied according to<br>
the circumstances.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, envelope information or index<br>
data corresponding to a portion (hereinafter referred to as the dominant portion) of a<br>
signal that appears dominant on a time/frequency axis may be transmitted, and none of<br>
envelope information and index data corresponding to a non-dominant portion of the<br>
signal may be transmitted. Alternatively, values (e.g., LPC coefficients) that represent<br>
the energy and power of the dominant portion of the signal may be transmitted, and no<br>
such values corresponding to the non-dominant portion of the signal may be<br>
transmitted. Still alternatively, envelope information or index data corresponding to the<br>
dominant portion of the signal may be transmitted, and values that represent the energy<br>
 <br>
or power of the non-dominant portion of the signal may be transmitted. Still alternatively,<br>
information only regarding the dominant portion of the signal may be<br>
transmitted so that the non-dominant portion of the signal can be estimated based on<br>
the information regarding the dominant portion of the signal. Still alternatively, a<br>
combination of the above-described methods may be used.<br>
For example, referring to FIG. 18, if a signal is divided into a dominant period and a<br>
non-dominant period, information regarding the signal may be transmitted in four<br>
different manners, as indicated by (a) through (d).<br>
In order to transmit a number of object signals as the combination of a downmix<br>
signal and side information, the downmix signal needs to be divided into a plurality of<br>
elements as part of a decoding operation, for example, in consideration of the ratio of<br>
the levels of the object signals. In order to guarantee independence between the<br>
elements of the downmix signal, a decorrelation operation needs to be additionally<br>
performed.<br>
Object signals which are the units of coding in an object-based coding method have<br>
more independence than channel signals which are the units of coding in a multichannel<br>
coding method. In other words, a channel signal includes a number of object<br>
signals, and thus needs to be decorrelated. On the other hand, object signals are independent<br>
from one another, and thus, channel separation may be easily performed<br>
simply using the characteristics of the object signals without a requirement of a<br>
decorrelation operation.<br>
More specifically, referring to FIG. 19, object signals A, B, and C take turns to<br>
appear dominant on a frequency axis. In this case, there is no need to divide a<br>
downmix signal into a number of signals according to the ratio of the levels of the<br>
object signals A, B, and C and to perform decorrelation. Instead, information regarding<br>
the dominant periods of the object signals A, B, and C may be transmitted, or a gain<br>
value may be applied to each frequency component of each of the object signals A, B,<br>
and C, thereby skipping decorrelation. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the amount of<br>
computation and to reduce the bitrate by the amount that would have otherwise been<br>
required by side information necessary for decorrelation.<br>
In short, in order to skip decorrelation, which is performed so as to guarantee independence<br>
among a number of signals obtained by dividing a downmix signal<br>
according to the ratio of the ratios of object signals of the downmix signal, information<br>
regarding a frequency domain including each object signal may be transmitted as side<br>
information. Alternatively, different gain values may be applied to a dominant period<br>
during which each object signal appears dominant and a non-dominant period during<br>
which each object signal appears less dominant, and thus, information regarding the<br>
dominant period may be mainly provided as side information. Still alternatively, the in-<br>
 <br>
formation regarding the dominant period may be transmitted as side information, and<br>
no information regarding the non-dominant period may be transmitted. Still alternatively,<br>
a combination of the above-described methods which are alternatives to a<br>
decorrelation method may be used.<br>
The above-described methods which are alternatives to a decorrelation method may<br>
be applied to all object signals or only to some object signals with easily distinguishable<br>
dominant periods. Also, the above-described methods which are alternatives<br>
to a decorrelation method may be variably applied in units of frames.<br>
The encoding of object audio signals using a residual signal will hereinafter be<br>
described in detail.<br>
In general, in an object-based audio coding method, a number of object signals are<br>
encoded, and the results of the encoding are transmitted as the combination of a<br>
downmix signal and side information. Then, a number of object signals are restored<br>
from the downmix signal through decoding according to the side information, and the<br>
restored object signals are appropriately mixed, for example, at the request of a user<br>
according to control information, thereby generating a final channel signal. An object-<br>
based audio coding method generally aims to freely vary an output channel signal<br>
according to control information with the aid of a mixer. However, an object-based<br>
audio coding method may also be used to generate a channel output in a predefined<br>
manner regardless of control information.<br>
For this, side information may include not only information necessary to obtain a<br>
number of object signals from a downmix signal but also mixing parameter information<br>
necessary to generate a channel signal. Thus, it is possible to generate a final<br>
channel output signal without the aid of a mixer. In this case, such an algorithm as<br>
residual coding may be used to improve the quality of sound.<br>
A typical residual coding method includes coding a signal and coding the error<br>
between the coded signal and the original signal, i.e., a residual signal. During a<br>
decoding operation, the coded signal is decoded while compensating for the error<br>
between the coded signal and the original signal, thereby restoring a signal that is as<br>
similar to the original signal as possible. Since the error between the coded signal and<br>
the original signal is generally inconsiderable, it is possible to reduce the amount of information<br>
additionally necessary to perform residual coding.<br>
If a final channel output of a decoder is fixed, not only mixing parameter information<br>
necessary for generating a final channel signal but also residual coding information<br>
may be provided as side information. In this case, it is possible to improve the quality<br>
of sound.<br>
FIG. 20 is a block diagram of an audio encoding apparatus 310 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 20, the audio encoding<br>
 <br>
apparatus 310 is characterized by using a residual signal.<br>
More specifically, the audio encoding apparatus 310 includes an encoder 311, a<br>
decoder 313, a first mixer 315, a second mixer 319, an adder 317 and a bitstream<br>
generator 321.<br>
The first mixer 315 performs a mixing operation on an original signal, and the<br>
second mixer 319 performs a mixing operation on a signal obtained by performing an<br>
encoding operation and then a decoding operation on the original signal. The adder 317<br>
calculates a residual signal between a signal output by the first mixer 315 and a signal<br>
output by the second mixer 319. The bitstream generator 321 adds the residual signal<br>
to side information and transmits the result of the addition. In this manner, it is<br>
possible to enhance the quality of sound.<br>
The calculation of a residual signal may be applied to all portions of a signal or only<br>
for low-frequency portions of a signal. Alternatively, the calculation of a residual<br>
signal may be variably applied only to frequency domains including dominant signals<br>
on a frame-by-frame basis. Still alternatively, a combination of the above-described<br>
methods may be used.<br>
Since the amount of side information including residual signal information is much<br>
greater than the amount of side information including no residual signal information,<br>
the calculation of a residual signal may be applied only to some portions of a signal<br>
that directly affect the quality of sound, thereby preventing an excessive increase in<br>
bitrate. The present invention can be realized as computer-readable code written on a<br>
computer-readable recording medium. The computer-readable recording medium may<br>
be any type of recording device in which data is stored in a computer-readable manner.<br>
Examples of the computer-readable recording medium include a ROM, a RAM, a CD-<br>
ROM, a magnetic tape, a floppy disc, an optical data storage, and a carrier wave (e.g.,<br>
data transmission through the Internet). The computer-readable recording medium can<br>
be distributed over a plurality of computer systems connected to a network so that<br>
computer-readable code is written thereto and executed therefrom in a decentralized<br>
manner. Functional programs, code, and code segments needed for realizing the<br>
present invention can be easily construed by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, sound images are localized<br>
for each object audio signal by benefiting from the advantages of object-based audio<br>
encoding and decoding methods. Thus, it is possible to offer more realistic sounds<br>
through the reproduction of object audio signals. In addition, the present invention may<br>
be applied to interactive games, and may thus provide a user with a more realistic<br>
virtual reality experience.<br>
 <br>
While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference<br>
to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in<br>
