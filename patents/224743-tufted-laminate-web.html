				<td>TUFTED LAMINATE WEB<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to webs such as films and fibrous woven and nonwoven webs. In<br>
particular, this invention relates to laminates of such webs treated by mechanical formation to<br>
have increased softness or bulk properties.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Laminates of webs, such as films and fibrous webs are well known in the art. For<br>
example, nonwoven webs are often laminated with polymer films such that they are useful as<br>
materials in disposable products such as backsheets on disposable absorbent diapers, for example.<br>
In such laminates the nonwoven portion can provide softness while the film portion can provide<br>
for fluid impermeability.<br>
In many applications it is desirable that laminates of webs have a bulky texture and/or<br>
softness. Additionally, it is desirable that laminates of webs have the texture and softness<br>
different on the two sides of the web. That is, the web can have a textured, relatively rough<br>
surface on one side, and a soft, relatively smooth surface on the other side. This can be achieved<br>
by laminating two dissimilar webs together, such as by adhesive or thermal bonding means. For<br>
example, a tufted nonwoven web can be adhered by adhesive to a non-tufted nonwoven web to<br>
make a laminate web having two sides with very different textures and softness characteristics.<br>
Additionally, it is known to combine into a laminate two nonwoven materials to gain the<br>
benefits of dissimilar materials in a single laminate web. For example, it is known to necdlcpunch<br>
nonwoven webs to produce integrally-bonded and entangled nonwoven webs. This process is<br>
often simply referred to as "needling." U.S. Patent No. 5,080,951 granted Jan. 14, 1992 to<br>
Guthrie, for example, discloses a nonwoven web composed of multiple layers bonded by a<br>
needling process that causes some fibers to extend through the entire thickness of the fabric and<br>
beyond the surface, thereby leaving short segments of filaments protruding from the exterior<br>
surface of the web. Frequently hydroentangling is used to accomplish a similar entangling of two<br>
fibrous nonwoven webs. Needling, like fluid entangling, is a relatively slow and therefore<br>
expensive process for manufacture of nonwoven webs, particularly for webs intended for<br>
disposable article use.<br><br>
In general, current methods for making laminates of films and fibrous webs having bulky<br>
or tufted textures on at least one side thereof are either relatively expensive for many applications<br>
of such webs, or the resulting webs are too stiff due to the application of adhesives or thermal<br>
bonding.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a low cost laminate web having terry cloth-like<br>
properties.<br>
Additionally, there is a need for a laminate web in which a nonwoven having tufted<br>
regions and a film or another nonwoven layer can be joined, preferably by means that do not<br>
require adhesives or thermal bonding to remain laminated.<br>
Additionally, there is a need for a laminate web in which the layers are not only joined to<br>
but also integrated through one another.<br>
Additionally, there is a need for a method of relatively inexpensively making a laminate<br>
web having terry cloth-like properties.<br>
Further, there is a need for a low cost method of making a soft, high bull porous laminate<br>
web of film, woven and/or nonwoven material.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A laminate web comprising a first and second precursor webs, at least the first precursor<br>
web being a nonwoven web, the laminate web having a first side, the first side comprising the<br>
second precursor web and at least one discrete tuft, each of the discrete tufts having a linear<br>
orientation defining a longitudinal axis and comprising a plurality of tufted fibers being integral<br>
extensions of the first precursor web and extending through the second precursor web; and a<br>
second side, the second side comprising the first precursor web.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIG. 1 shows a laminate web 1 of the present invention, hereinafler referred to simply as<br>
web 1. Web I comprises at least two layers. The layers are referred to herein as generally planar,<br>
two-dimensional precursor webs, such as first precursor web 20 and second precursor web 21.<br>
Either precursor web can be a film, a nonwoven, or a woven web. Precursor webs 20 and 21 (and<br>
any additional webs) can be joined by adhesive, thermal bonding, ultrasonic bonding and the like,<br>
but are preferably joined without the use of adhesive or other forms of bonding. As disclosed<br>
below, the constituent precursor webs of web 1 can be joined by interlocking mechanical<br>
engagement resulting from the formation of tufts 6.<br>
Web 1 has a first side 3 and a second side 5, the term "sides" being used in the common<br>
usage of generally planar two-dimensional webs, such as paper and films that have two sides<br>
when in a generally flat condition. Each precursor web 20 and 21 has a first surface 12 and 13,<br>
respectively, and a second surface 14 and 15, respectively (shown in FIG. 3). Web 1 has a<br>
machine direction (MD) and a cross machine direction (CD) as is commonly known in the art of<br>
web manufacture. Although the present invention can be practiced with polymer films and woven<br>
webs, in a preferred embodiment first precursor web 20 is a nonwoven web comprised of<br>
substantially randomly oriented fibers. By "substantially randomly oriented" is meant that, due to<br>
processing conditions of the precursor web, there may be a higher amount of fibers oriented in the<br>
MD than the CD, or vice-versa. For example, in spunbonding and meltblowing processes<br>
continuous strands of fibers are deposited on a support moving in the MD. Despite attempts to<br><br>
make the orientalion of the fibers of the spunbond or meltblown nonwoven web truly "random,"<br>
usually a slightly higher percentage of fibers are oriented in the MD as opposed to the CD. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, second precursor web 21 is a nonwoven web similar to the first precursor<br>
web 20, or a polymer film or an apertured polymer film, such as a polyethylene film.<br>
In one embodiment, first side 3 of web 1 is defined by exposed portions of the first<br>
surface 13 of second precursor web 21 and at least one, but preferably a plurality of, discrete tufts<br>
6 which are integral extensions of the fibers of a nonwoven first precursor web 20. As shown in<br>
FIG. 3, each tuft 6 can comprise a plurality of looped, aligned fibers 8 extending through second<br>
precursor web 21 and outwardly from the first surface 13 thereof. In another embodiment each<br>
tuft 6 can comprise a plurality of non-looped fibers 18 (as shown in FIG. 3) that extend outwardly<br>
from the first surface 13.<br>
As used herein, the term "nonwoven web" refers to a web having a structure of individual<br>
fibers or threads which are interlaid, but not in a repeating pattern as in a woven or knitted fabric,<br>
which do not typically have randomly oriented fibers. Nonwoven webs or fabrics have been<br>
formed from many processes, such as, for example, meltblowing processes, spunbonding<br>
processes, hydrocntangling, airlaying, and bonded carded web processes, including carded<br>
thermal bonding. The basis weight of nonwoven fabrics is usually expressed in grams per square<br>
meter (gsm). The basis weight of the laminate web is the combined basis weight of the<br>
constituent layers and any other added components. Fiber diameters are usually expressed in<br>
microns; fiber size can also be expressed in denier, which is a unit of weight per length of fiber.<br>
The basis weight oflaminate webs suitable for use in the present invention can range from 10 gsm<br>
to 500 gsm, depending on the ultimate use of the web 1. For use as a hand towel, for example,<br>
both first precursor web 20 and second precursor web 21 can be a nonwoven web having a basis<br>
weight for of between 25 gsm and 100 gsm. For use as a bath towel both first precursor web 20<br>
and second precursor web 21 can have a basis weight for of between 125 gsm and 250 gsm. For<br>
use as a ground cover, such an erosion control liners, a laminate basis weight of between 350 gsm<br>
and 500 gsm or higher may be appropriate.<br>
The constituent fibers of nonwoven precursor web 20 or 21 can be comprised of<br>
polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, and blends thereof. The fibers can<br>
comprise cellulose, rayon, cotton, or other natural materials or blends of polymer and natural<br>
materials. The fibers can also comprise a super absorbent material such as polyacrylate or any<br>
combination of suitable materials. The fibers can be monocomponent, bicomponent, and/or<br>
biconstituent, non-round (e.g., capillary channel fibers), and can have major cross-sectional<br><br>
dimensions (e.g., diameter for round fibers) ranging from 0.1-500 microns. For example, one<br>
type of fibers suitable for the nonwoven web includes nanofibers. Nanofibers arc described as<br>
fibers having a mean diameter of less than 1 micron. Nanofibers can comprise all of the fibers in<br>
a nonwoven web or a portion of the fibers in a nonwoven web. The constituent fibers of the<br>
nonwoven precursor web may also be a mixture of different fiber types, differing in such features<br>
as chemistry (e.g. PE and PP), components (mono- and bi-), denier (micro denier and &gt;20 denier),<br>
shape (i.e. capillary and round) and the like. The constituent fibers can range from about 0.1<br>
denier to about 100 denier.<br>
As used herein, "spunbond fibers" refers to small diameter fibers which are formed by<br>
extruding molten thermoplastic material as filaments from a plurality of fine, usually circular<br>
capillaries of a spinneret with the diameter of the extruded filaments then being rapidly reduced.<br>
Spunbond fibers are generally not tacky when they are deposited on a collecting surface.<br>
Spunbond fibers are generally continuous and have average diameters (from a sample of at least<br>
10) larger than 7 microns, and more particularly, between about 10 and 40 microns.<br>
As used herein, the term "meltblowing" refers to a process in which fibers are formed by<br>
extruding a molten thermoplastic material through a plurality of fine, usually circular, die<br>
capillaries as molten threads or filaments into converging high velocity, usually heated, gas (for<br>
example air) streams which attenuate the filaments of molten thermoplastic material to reduce<br>
their diameter, which may be to microfiber diameter. Thereafter, the meltblown fibers are carried<br>
by the high velocity gas stream and are deposited on a collecting surface, often while still tacky,<br>
to form a web of randomly dispersed meltblown fibers. Meltblown fibers are microfibers which<br>
may be continuous or discontinuous and arc generally smaller than 10 microns in average<br>
diameter.<br>
As used herein, the term "polymer" generally includes, but is not limited to,<br>
homopolymers, copolymcrs, such as for example, block, grafl, random and alternating<br>
copolymcrs, tcrpolymers, etc., and blends and modifications thereof. In addition, unless otherwise<br>
specifically limited, the term "polymer" includes all possible geometric configurations of the<br>
material. The configurations include, but are not limited to, isotactic, atactic, syndiotactic, and<br>
random symmetries.<br>
As used herein, the term "monocomponent" fiber refers to a fiber formed from one or<br>
more extruders using only one polymer. This is not meant to exclude fibers formed from one<br>
polymer to which small amounts of additives have been added for coloration, antistatic<br>
properties, lubrication, hydrophilicity, etc. These additives, for example titanium dioxide for<br><br>
coloration, are generally present in an amount less than about 5 weight percent and more typically<br>
about 2 weight percent.<br>
As used herein, the term "bicomponent fibers" refers to fibers which have been formed<br>
from at least two different polymers extruded from separate extruders but spun together to form<br>
one fiber. Bicomponent fibers are also sometimes referred to as conjugate fibers or<br>
multicomponent fibers. The polymers are arranged in substantially constantly positioned distinct<br>
zones across the cross-section of the bicomponent fibers and extend continuously along the length<br>
of the bicomponent fibers. The configuration of such a bicomponent fiber may be, for example, a<br>
sheath/core arrangement wherein one polymer is surrounded by another, or may be a side-by-side<br>
arrangement, a pie arrangement, or an "islands-in-the-sea" arrangement.<br>
As used herein, the term "biconstituent fibers" refers to fibers which have been formed<br>
from at least two polymers extruded from the same extruder as a blend. Biconstituent fibers do<br>
not have the various polymer components arranged in relatively constantly positioned distinct<br>
zones across the cross-sectional area of the fiber and the various polymers are usually not<br>
continuous along the entire length of the fiber, instead usually forming fibrils which start and end<br>
at random. Biconstituent fibers are sometimes also referred to as multiconstituent fibers.<br>
As used herein, the term "non-round fibers" describes fibers having a non-round cross-<br>
section, and includes "shaped fibers" and "capillary channel fibers." Such fibers can be solid or<br>
hollow, and they can be tri-lobal, delta-shaped, and are preferably fibers having capillary channels<br>
on their outer surfaces. The capillary channels can be of various cross-sectional shapes such as<br>
"U-shaped", "H-shaped", "C-shaped" and "V-shaped". One preferred capillary channel fiber is<br>
T-401, designated as 4DG fiber available from Fiber Innovation Technologies, Johnson City, TN.<br>
T-401 fiber is a polyethylene terephthalate (PET polyester).<br>
As used herein, the term "integral" as in "integral extension" when used for the tufts 6<br>
refers to fibers of the tufts 6 having originated from the fibers of the first precursor web 20.<br>
Therefore, the looped fibers 8 and non-looped fibers 18 of tufts 6, can be plastically deformed and<br>
extended fibers of the first precursor web 20, and are, therefore, integral with first precursor web<br>
20. As used herein, "integral" is to be distinguished from fibers introduced to or added to a<br>
separate precursor web for the purpose of making tufts, as is commonly done in conventional<br>
carpet making, for example.<br>
The number, spacing, and dimensions of tufts 6 can be varied to give varying texture to<br>
first side 3 of web 1. For example, if tufts 6 are sufficiently closely spaced the first side 3 of web<br><br>
1 can have a terry cloth-like feel. Alternatively, tufts 6 can be arranged in patterns such as lines or<br>
filled shapes to create portions of a laminate web having greater texture, softness, bulk,<br>
absorbency or visual design appeal. For example, when tufts 6 are arranged in a pattern of a line<br>
or lines, the tufts can have the appearance of stitching. Tufts 6 can also be arranged to form<br>
specific shapes, such as designs, words or logos. Such shapes can be used, for example, on<br>
laminates useful for hotel bath towels or robes which can have the name or logo of the hotel<br>
formed thereon. Likewise, the size dimensions, such as the height, length and width of individual<br>
tufts 6 can be varied. Single tufts can be as long as about 3 cm in length and can be made alone or<br>
dispersed among tufts of various sizes.<br>
First precursor web 20 can be a fibrous woven or nonwoven web comprising fibers<br>
having sufficient elongation properties to have portions formed into tufts 6 as described more<br>
fully below. Tufts are formed by urging fibers out-of-plane in the Z-direction at discrete,<br>
localized, portions of first precursor web 20. The urging out-of-plane can be due to fiber<br>
displacement, i.e., the fiber is able to move relative to other fibers and be "pulled," so to speak,<br>
out-of-plane. More often, however, for most nonwoven first precursor webs 20, the urging out-<br>
of-plane is due to the fibers of tufts 6 having been at least partially plastically stretched and<br>
permanently deformed to form tufts 6. Therefore, in one embodiment, depending on the desired<br>
height of tufts 6, the constituent fibers of a nonwoven first precursor webs 20 can exhibit an<br>
elongation to break of at least about 5%, more preferably at least about 10%, more preferably at<br>
least about 25%, more preferably at least about 50%, and more preferably at least about 100%.<br>
Elongation to break can be determined by simple tensile testing, such as by use of Instron tensile<br>
testing equipment, and can generally be found on material data sheets from suppliers of such<br>
fibers or webs.<br>
It can be appreciated that a suitable nonwoven first precursor web 20 should comprise<br>
fibers capable of experiencing sufficient plastic deformation and tensile elongation, or are capable<br>
of sufficient fiber mobility, such that looped fibers 8 are formed. However, it is recognized that a<br>
certain percentage of fibers urged out of the plane of the first surface 12 of first precursor web 20<br>
will not form a loop, but instead will break and form loose ends. Such fibers are referred to<br>
herein as "loose" fibers or "loose fiber ends" 18 as shown in FIG. 3. Loose fiber ends 18 are not<br>
necessarily undesirable for the present invention, and in some embodiments, most or all of the<br>
fibers of tufts 6 can be loose fiber ends 18. Loose fiber ends 18 can also be the result of forming<br>
tufts 6 from nonwoven webs consisting of, or containing, cut staple fibers. In such a case, some<br>
number of the staple fiber ends may protrude into the tuft 6, depending upon such things as the<br><br>
number of staple fibers in the web, the staple fiber cut length, and the height of the tufts. In some<br>
instances, it may be desired to use a blend of fibers of different lengths in a precursor web or<br>
fibers of different lengths in different layers. This may be able to selectively separate the longer<br>
fibers from the shorter fibers. The longer fibers may predominately form the tuft 6 while the<br>
shorter fibers predominately remain in the portion of the web not forming the tuft 6. An<br>
exemplary mixture of fiber lengths can include fibers of approximately 2 to 8 centimeters for the<br>
longer fibers and less than about 1 centimeter for the shorter fibers.<br>
First precursor web 20 can be a fibrous woven or nonwoven web comprising elastic or<br>
elastomeric fibers. Elastic or elastomeric fibers can be stretched at least about 50% and return to<br>
within 10% of their original dimension. Tufts 6 can be formed from elastic fibers if the fibers are<br>
simply displaced due to the mobility of the fiber within the nonwoven, or if the fibers are<br>
stretched beyond their elastic limit and are plastically deformed.<br>
Second precursor web 21 can be virtually any web material, the only requirement being<br>
that it have sufficient integrity to be formed into the laminate by the process described below, and<br>
that it have sufficiently less elongation properties relative to first precursor web 20, such that upon<br>
experiencing the strain of fibers from first precursor web 20 being urged out-of-plane in the<br>
direction of second precursor web 21, second precursor web 21 will rupture, e.g., by tearing due<br>
to extensional failure, such that portions of first precursor web 20 can extend through, (i.e.,<br>
"punch through" so to speak), second precursor web 21 to form tufts 6 on first side 3 of web 1. In<br>
one embodiment second precursor web 21 is a polymer film. Second precursor web 21 can also<br>
be a woven textile web, a nonwoven web, a polymer film, an apertured polymer film, a paper<br>
web, (e.g., tissue paper), a metal foil (e.g., aluminum wrapping foil), a foam (e.g., urethane foam<br>
sheeting), or the like.<br>
A representative tuft 6 for the embodiment of web 1 shown in FIG. 1 is shown in a further<br>
enlarged view in FIG. 2. As shown in FIG. 2 or 3, tuft 6 comprises a plurality of looped fibers 8<br>
that are substantially aligned such that tuft 6 has a distinct linear orientation and a longitudinal<br>
axis L. Tuft 6 also have a transverse axis T generally orthogonal to longitudinal axis L in the<br>
MD-CD plane. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, longitudinal axis L is parallel to the<br>
MD. In one embodiment, all the spaced apart tufts 6 have generally parallel longitudinal axes L.<br>
The number of tufts 6 per unit area of web 1, i.e., the area density of tuft 6, can be varied from I<br>
tuft per unit area, e.g., square centimeter to as high as 100 tufts per square centimeter. There can<br>
be at least 10, or at least 20 tufts 6 per square centimeter, depending on the end use. In general,<br>
the area density need not be uniform across the entire area of web 1, but tufts 6 can be only in<br><br>
certain regions of web I, such as in regions having predetermined shapes, such as lines, stripes,<br>
bands, circles, and the like.<br>
As can be appreciated by the description herein, in many embodiments of web 1 openings<br>
4 of second precursor web 21 will have a distinct linear orientation and a longitudinal axis, which<br>
is oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis L of its corresponding tuft 6. Likewise, openings 4<br>
will also have a transverse axis generally orthogonal to longitudinal axis in the MD-CD plane.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1-4, tufts 6 extend through openings 4 in second precursor web 21.<br>
Openings 4 are formed by locally rupturing second precursor web 21 by the process described in<br>
detail below. Rupture may involve a simple splitting open of second precursor web 21, such that<br>
opening 4 remains a simple two-dimensional aperture. However, for some materials, such as<br>
polymer films, portions of second precursor web 21 can be deflected or urged out-of-plane (i.e.,<br>
the plane of second precursor web 21) to form flap-like structures, referred to herein as flap, or<br>
flaps, 7. The form and structure of flaps 7 is highly dependent upon the material properties of<br>
second precursor web 21. Flaps 7 can have the general structure of one or more flaps, as shown in<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2. In other embodiments, flap 7 can have a more volcano-like structure, as if the tuft<br>
6 is erupting from the flap 7.<br>
In one embodiment flaps 7 do not contribute significantly to the material of tufts 6, and<br>
particularly do not contribute significantly to the tactile quality of tufts 6. In one embodiment,<br>
therefore, the laminate web 1 comprises at least two layers (i.e., precursor webs 20 and 21), but at<br>
least one of the layers (i.e., precursor web 21 in FIGS. 1-4) does not significantly affect on the<br>
tactile qualities of tufts 6.<br>
In one embodiment, flaps 7 may extend out of plane significantly, even being as high, so<br>
to speak, as the tufts 6 themselves. In this embodiment flaps 7 can cause the tufts 6 to be more<br>
resilient and less susceptible to flattening due to compressive or bending forces. In one<br>
embodiment, therefore, the laminate web 1 comprises at least two layers (i.e., precursor webs 20<br>
and 21), and both layers affect the tactile qualities of tufts 6.<br>
Tufts 6 are, in a sense, "punched through" second precursor web 21 and can be "locked"<br>
in place by factional engagement with openings 4. In some embodiments, for example, the lateral<br>
width of opening 4 (i.e., the dimension measured parallel to its transverse axis) can be less than<br>
the maximum width of the tooth that formed the opening (per the process described below). This<br>
indicates a certain amount of recovery at the opening that tends to constrain tuft 6 from pulling<br>
back out through opening 4. The frictional engagement of the tufts and openings provides for a<br><br>
laminate web structure having permanent tufting on one side that can be formed without<br>
adhesives or thermal bonding.<br>
Because in some embodiments at least one of the layers (e.g., a relatively low elongation<br>
polymer film or tissue paper second precursor web 21 in FIGS. 1-4) does not significantly<br>
contribute material to the tufts 6 (such as in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 1-4) a web 1<br>
comprising a nonwoven first precursor web 20 can be characterized as being predominantly<br>
fibrous on both sides of web 1 with the fibers being contributed only by nonwoven first precursor<br>
web 20. Therefore, tufts 6 can be spaced sufficiently closely so as to effectively cover first side 3<br>
of web 1. In such an embodiment, both sides of web 1 appear to be nonwoven, with a difference<br>
between the two sides 3 and 5 being a difference in surface texture. Therefore, in one<br>
embodiment, the invention can be described as a laminate material of two or more precursor<br>
webs, wherein both sides of the laminate web are substantially covered by fibers from only one of<br>
the precursor webs.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1-4, one characteristic of tufts 6 can be the predominant directional<br>
alignment of the fibers 8 or 18. For example, looped, aligned fibers 8 can be described as having<br>
a significant or major vector component parallel to the Z-CD plane and the looped fibers 8 have a<br>
substantially uniform alignment with respect to transverse axis T when viewed in plan view, such<br>
as in FIG. 4. By "looped" fibers 8 is meant fibers 8 that are integral with and begin and end in<br>
first precursor web 20 but extend outwardly in the Z-direction from first surface 13 of second<br>
precursor web 21. By "aligned" with respect to looped fibers 8 of tufts 6 is meant that looped<br>
fibers 8 are all generally oriented such that, if viewed in plan view as in FIG. 4, each of the looped<br>
fibers 8 has a significant vector component parallel to the transverse axis T, and preferably a<br>
major vector component parallel to the transverse axis T.<br>
In contrast, non-looped fibers 18 are integral with, but only begin in first precursor web<br>
20 and have a free end extending outwardly in the Z-direction from first surface 13 of second<br>
precursor web 21. Loose fibers 18 can also have a generally uniform alignment described as<br>
having a significant or major vector component parallel to the Z-CD plane.<br>
For both looped fibers 8 and loose fibers 18, the alignment is a characteristic of tufts 6<br>
prior to any post-manufacture deformation due to winding onto a roll, or compression in use in an<br>
article of manufacture.<br>
As used herein, a looped fiber 8 oriented at an angle of greater than 45 degrees from the<br>
longitudinal axis L when viewed in plan view, as in FIG. 4, has a significant vector component<br><br>
parallel to the transverse axis T. As used herein, a looped fiber 8 oriented at an angle of greater<br>
than 60 degrees from longitudinal axis L when viewed in plan view, as in FIG. 4, has a major<br>
vector component parallel to the transverse axis T. In a preferred embodiment, at least 50%, more<br>
preferably at least 70%, and more preferably at least 90% of fibers 8 of tuft 6 have a significant,<br>
and more preferably, a major vector component parallel to transverse axis T. Fiber orientation<br>
can be determined by use of magnifying means if necessary, such as a microscope fitted with a<br>
suitable measurement scale. In general, for a non-linear segment of fiber viewed in plan view, a<br>
straight-line approximation for both longitudinal axis L and the looped fibers 8 can be used for<br>
determining the angle of looped fibers 8 from longitudinal axis L. For example, as shown in FIG.<br>
4, one fiber 8a is shown emphasized by a heavy line, and its linear approximation 8b is shown as<br>
a dashed line. This fiber makes an angle of approximately 80 degrees with the longitudinal axis<br>
(measured counterclockwise from L).<br>
The orientation of looped fibers 8 in the tufts 6 is to be contrasted with the fiber<br>
composition and orientation for first precursor web 20, which, for nonwoven webs is best<br>
described as having a substantially randomly-oriented fiber alignment. In a woven web<br>
embodiment, the orientation of the looped fibers 8 in tufts 6 could be the same as described<br>
above, but the fibers of first precursor web 20 would have the orientation associated with the<br>
particular weaving process used to make the web, e.g., a square weave pattern.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 the longitudinal axes L of tufts 6 are generally<br>
aligned in the MD. Tufts 6 and, therefore, longitudinal axes L, can, in principle, be aligned in any<br>
orientation with respect to the MD or CD. Therefore, in general, it can be said that for each tuft<br>
6, the looped aligned fibers 8 are aligned generally orthogonal to the longitudinal axis L such that<br>
they have a significant vector component parallel to transverse axis T, and more preferably a<br>
major vector component parallel to transverse axis T.<br>
In some embodiments, due to the preferred method of forming tufts 6, as described below,<br>
another characteristic of tufts 6 comprising predominantly looped, aligned fibers 8, can be their<br>
generally open structure characterized by open void area 10 defined interiorly of tufts 6, as shown<br>
in FIGS. 2 and 3. The void area 10 may have a shape that is wider or larger at the distal end 31<br>
of the tuft 6 and narrower at the base 17 of the tuft 6. This is opposite to the shape of the tooth<br>
which is used to form the tuft 6. By "void area" is not meant an area completely free of any<br>
fibers; the term is meant as a general description of the general appearance of tufts 6. Therefore,<br>
it may be that in some tufts 6 a loose fiber 18 or a plurality of loose fibers 18 may be present in<br>
the void area 10. By "open" void area is meant that the two longitudinal ends of tuft 6 are<br><br>
generally open and free of fibers, such that tuft 6 can form something like a "tunnel" structure in<br>
an uncompressed state, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Additionally, as a consequence of a preferred method of making web 1, the second side 5<br>
of web 1 exhibits discontinuities 16 characterized by a generally linear indentation defined by<br>
formerly random fibers of the second surface 14 of first precursor web 20 having been urged<br>
directionally (i.e., in the "Z -direction" generally orthogonal to the MD-CD plane as shown in<br>
FIGS. 1 and 3) into tufts 6 by the teeth of the forming structure, described in detail below. The<br>
abrupt change of orientation exhibited by the previously randomly-oriented fibers of first<br>
precursor web 20 defines the discontinuity 16, which exhibits a linearity such that it can be<br>
described as having a longitudinal axis generally parallel to longitudinal axis L of the tuft 6. Due<br>
to the nature of many nonwoven webs useful as first precursor webs 20, discontinuity 16 may not<br>
be as distinctly noticeable as tufts 6. For this reason, the discontinuities 16 on the second side S<br>
of web 1 can go unnoticed and may be generally undetected unless web 1 is closely inspected. As<br>
such, the second side 5 of web 1 can have the look and feel of an un-tufted first precursor web 20.<br>
Thus in some embodiments, web 1 can have the textured look and feel of terry cloth on first side<br>
3, and a relatively smooth, soft look and feel on second side 5, both sides being comprised of<br>
fibers from the same nonwoven web, i.e., the first precursor web 20. In other embodiments,<br>
discontinuities 16 can appear as apertures, and may be apertures through web 1 via the ends of the<br>
tunnel-like tufts 6.<br>
From the description of web 1 comprising a nonwoven first precursor web 20, it can be<br>
seen that the fibers 8 or 18 of tuft 6 can originate and extend from either the first surface 12 or the<br>
second surface 14 of first precursor web 20. Of course the fibers 8 or 18 of tuft 6 can also extend<br>
from the interior 28 of first precursor web 20. As shown in FIG. 3, the fibers 8 or 18 of tufts 6<br>
extend due to having been urged out of the generally two-dimensional plane of first precursor web<br>
20 (i.e., urged in the "Z -direction" as shown in FIG. 3). In general, the fibers 8 or 18 of the tufts<br>
6 comprise fibers that are integral with and extend from the fibers of the first precursor web 20.<br>
Therefore, from the above description, it is understood that in one embodiment web 1 can<br>
be described as being a laminate web formed by selective mechanical deformation of at least a<br>
first and second precursor webs, at least the first precursor web being a nonwoven web, the<br>
laminate web having a first side, the first side comprising the second precursor web and a<br>
plurality of discrete tufts, each of the discrete tufts comprising a plurality of tufted fibers being<br>
integral extensions of the first precursor web and extending through the second precursor web;<br>
and a second side, the second side comprising the first precursor web.<br><br>
The extension of fibers 8 or 18 can be accompanied by a general reduction in fiber cross<br>
sectional dimension (e.g., diameter for round fibers) due to plastic deformation of the fibers and<br>
Poisson's ratio effects. Therefore, the aligned looped fibers 8 of tuft 6 can have an average fiber<br>
diameter less than the average fiber diameter of the fibers of first precursor web 20. It is believed<br>
that this reduction in fiber diameter contributes to the perceived softness of the first side 3 of web<br>
1, a softness that can be comparable to cotton terry cloth, depending on the material properties of<br>
the first precursor web 20. It has been found that the reduction in fiber cross-sectional dimension<br>
is greatest intermediate the base 17 and the distal portion 31 of tuft 6. This is believed to be due<br>
to the preferred method of making, as disclosed more fully below. Briefly, as shown on FIG. 3, it<br>
is believed that portions of fibers at the base 17 and distal portion 31 of tufts 6 are adjacent the tip<br>
of teeth 110 of roll 104, described more fully below, and are frictionally locked and immobile<br>
during processing. Thus, the intermediate portions of tufts 6 are more free to stretch, or elongate,<br>
and accordingly, can experience a corresponding fiber cross sectional dimension reduction. Some<br>
fibers of first precursor web 20 may laterally squeeze the base 17 of the tuft 6. The base 17 of the<br>
tuft 6 may even be closed (if the fibers from the tuft 6 are close enough together to touch) or may<br>
remain open. Generally, any opening at the base 17 is narrow. The closing or narrowing or<br>
squeezing of other fibers at the base 17 can help to stabilize the tufts 6 and second precursor web<br>
21.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5 there is shown in an apparatus and method for making web 1 of the<br>
present invention. The apparatus 100 comprises a pair of intermeshing rolls 1.02 and 104, each<br>
rotating about an axis A, the axes A being parallel in the same plane. Roll 102 comprises a<br>
plurality of ridges 106 and corresponding grooves 108 which extend unbroken about the entire<br>
circumference of roll 102. Roll 104 is similar to roll 102, but rather than having ridges that<br>
extend unbroken about the entire circumference, roll 104 comprises a plurality of rows of<br>
circumferentially-extending ridges that have been modified to be rows of circumferentially-<br>
spaced teeth 110 that extend in spaced relationship about at least a portion of roll 104. The<br>
individual rows of teeth 110 of roll 104 are separated by corresponding grooves 112. In<br>
operation, rolls 102 and 104 intermesh such that the ridges 106 of roll 102 extend into the grooves<br>
112 of roll 104 and the teeth 110 of roll 104 extend into the grooves 108 of roll 102. The<br>
intermeshing is shown in greater detail in the cross sectional representation of FIG. 6, discussed<br>
below. Both or either of rolls 102 and 104 can be heated by means known in the art such as by<br>
using hot oil filled rollers or electrically-heated rollers.<br><br>
In FIG. 5, the apparatus 100 is shown in a preferred configuration having one patterned<br>
roll, e.g., roll 104, and one non-patterned grooved roll 102. However, in certain embodiments it<br>
may be preferable to use two patterned rolls 104 having either the same or differing patterns, in<br>
the same or different corresponding regions of the respective rolls. Such an apparatus can<br>
produce webs with tufts 6 protruding from both sides of the web 1. An apparatus could also be<br>
designed to have teeth that pointing in opposite directions on the same roll. This would result in a<br>
web with tufts 6 being produced on both sides of the web.<br>
The method of making a web 1 of the present invention in a commercially viable<br>
continuous process is depicted in FIG. 5. Web 1 is made by mechanically deforming precursor<br>
webs, such as first and second precursor webs, 20 and 21 that can each be described as generally<br>
planar and two dimensional prior to processing by the apparatus shown in FIG. 5. By "planar"<br>
and "two dimensional" is meant simply that the webs start the process in a generally flat condition<br>
relative to the finished web 1 that has distinct, out-of-plane, Z-direction three-dimensionality due<br>
to the formation of tufts 6. "Planar" and "two-dimensional" are not meant to imply any particular<br>
flatness, smoothness or dimensionality.<br>
The process and apparatus of the present invention is similar in many respects to a<br>
process described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,518,801 entitled "Web Materials Exhibiting Elastic-Like<br>
Behavior" and referred to in subsequent patent literature as "SELF" webs, which stands for<br>
"Structural Elastic-like Film". However, there are significant differences between the apparatus<br>
and process of the present invention and the apparatus and process disclosed in the '801 patent,<br>
and the differences are apparent in the respective webs produced thereby. As described below,<br>
the teeth 110 of roll 104 have a specific geometry associated with the leading and trailing edges<br>
that permit the teeth to essentially "punch" through the precursor webs 20, 21 as opposed to, in<br>
essence, deforming the web. In a two layer laminate web 1 the teeth 110 urge fibers from a first<br>
precursor web 20 simultaneously out-of-plane and through second precursor web 21, which is<br>
punctured, so to speak, by the teeth 110 pushing the fibers 8 through to form tufts 6. Therefore, a<br>
web 1 of the present invention can have tufts 6 of loose fiber ends 18 and/or 'tunnel-like" tufts 6<br>
of looped, aligned fibers 8 extending through and away from the surface 13 of a first side 3,<br>
unlike the "tent-like" rib-like elements of SELF webs which each have continuous side walls<br>
associated therewith, i.e., a continuous "transition zone," and which do not exhibit<br>
interpenetration of one layer through another layer.<br>
Precursor webs 20 and 21 arc provided either directly from their respective web making<br>
processes or indirectly from supply rolls (neither shown) and moved in the machine direction to<br><br>
the nip 116 of counter-rotating intermeshing rolls 102 and 104. The precursor webs are<br>
preferably held in a sufficient web tension so as to enter the nip 16 in a generally flattened<br>
condition by means well known in the art of web handling. As each precursor web 20, 21 goes<br>
through the nip 116 the teeth 110 of roll 104 which are intermeshed with grooves 108 of roll 102<br>
simultaneously urge portions of first precursor web 20 out of the plane of first precursor web 20<br>
and through second precursor web 21 to form tufts 6. In effect, teeth 110 "push" or "punch"<br>
fibers of first precursor web 20 through second precursor web 21.<br>
As the tip of teeth 110 push through first and second precursor webs 20, 21 the portions<br>
of the fibers of first precursor web 20 that are oriented predominantly in the CD across teeth 110<br>
are urged by the teeth 110 out of the plane of first precursor web 20. Fibers can be urged out of<br>
plane due to fiber mobility, or they can be urged out of plane by being stretched and/or plastically<br>
deformed in the Z-direction. Portions of first precursor web 20 urged out of plane by teeth 110<br>
push through second precursor web 21, which due to its relatively lower extensibility, ruptures,<br>
thereby resulting in formation of tufts 6 on first side 3 of web 1. Fibers of first precursor web 20<br>
that are predominantly oriented generally parallel to the longitudinal axis L, i.e., in the MD of<br>
precursor web 20 as shown in FIG. 1, are simply spread apart by teeth 110 and remain<br>
substantially in their original, randomly-oriented condition. This is why the looped fibers 8 can<br>
exhibit the unique fiber orientation in embodiments such as the one shown in FIGS. 1-4, which is<br>
a high percentage of fibers of each tuft 6 having a significant or major vector component parallel<br>
to the transverse axis T of tuft 6.<br>
It can be appreciated by the forgoing description that when web 1 is made by the<br>
apparatus and method of the present invention that the precursor webs 20, 21 should possess<br>
differing material properties with respect to the ability of the precursor webs to elongate before<br>
failure, e.g., failure due to tensile stresses. In particular, a nonwoven first precursor web 20 can<br>
have greater fiber mobility and/or greater fiber elongation characteristics relative to second<br>
precursor web 21, such that the fibers thereof can move or stretch sufficiently to form tufts 6<br>
while the second precursor web 21 ruptures, i.e., does not stretch to the extent necessary to form<br>
tufts.<br>
The degree to which the fibers of nonwoven precursor webs are able to extend out of<br>
plane without plastic deformation can depend upon the degree of inter-fiber bonding of the<br>
precursor web. For example, if the fibers of a nonwoven precursor web are only very loosely<br>
entangled to each other, they will be more able to slip by each other (i.e., to move relative to<br>
adjacent fibers by reptation) and therefore be more easily extended out of plane to form tufts. On<br><br>
the other hand, fibers of a nonwoven precursor web that are more strongly bonded, for example<br>
by high levels of thermal point bonding, hydroentanglement, or the like, will more likely require<br>
greater degrees of plastic deformation in extended out-of-plane tufts. Therefore, in one<br>
embodiment, first precursor web 20 can be a nonwoven web having relatively low inter-fiber<br>
bonding, and second precursor web 21 can be a nonwoven web having relatively high inter-fiber<br>
bonding, such that the fibers of first precursor web can extend out of plane, while the fibers of<br>
second precursor web 21 cannot. Upon sufficient force applied to first precursor web 21, the<br>
fibers therein tend to extend, while the fibers of second precursor web, unable to extend, tend to<br>
break.<br>
For a given maximum strain (e.g., the strain imposed by teeth 110 of apparatus 100),<br>
second precursor web 21 must actually fail under the tensile loading produced by the imposed<br>
strain. That is, for the tufts 6 of the present invention to be disposed on the first side 3 of web 1,<br>
second precursor web 21 must have sufficiently low fiber mobility (if any) and/or relatively low<br>
elongation-to-break such that it locally (i.e., in the area of strain) fails in tension, thereby<br>
producing openings 4 through which tufts 6 can extend. If second precursor web 21 merely<br>
deforms or stretches in the region of induced strain, but does not actually fail, thereby producing<br>
an opening 4 therein, a tuft 6 may not result. In one embodiment second precursor web 21 has an<br>
elongation to break in the range of l%-5%. While the actual required elongation to break depends<br>
on the strain to be induced to form web 1, it is recognized that for most embodiments, second<br>
precursor web 21 can exhibit a web elongation-to-break of 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, or more. It is<br>
also recognized that actual elongation-to-break can depend on the strain rale, which, for the<br>
apparatus shown in FIG. 5 is a function of line speed. Elongation to break of webs used in the<br>
present invention can be measured by means known in the art, such as by standard tensile testing<br>
methods using standard tensile testing apparatuses, such as those manufactured by Instron, MTS,<br>
Thwing-AIbert, and the like.<br>
Furthermore, relative to first precursor web 20, second precursor web 21 should have<br>
lower fiber mobility (if any) and/or lower elongation-to-break (i.e., elongation-to-brcak of<br>
individual fibers, or, if a film, elongation-to-break of the film) such that, rather than extending<br>
out-of-plane to the extent of the tufts 6, second precursor web 21 fails in tension under the strain<br>
produced by the formation of tufts 6, e.g., by the teeth 110 of apparatus 100. In one embodiment,<br>
second precursor web 21 exhibits sufficiently low elongation-to-break relative to first precursor<br>
web 20 such that flaps 7 of opening 4 only extend slightly out-of-plane, if at all, relative to tufts 6.<br>
In general, it is believed that second precursor web 21 should have an elongation to break of at<br><br>
least 10% less than the first precursor web 20, preferably at least 30% less, more preferably at<br>
least 50% less, and even more preferably at least about 100% less than that of first precursor web<br>
20. Relative elongation to break values of webs used in the present invention can be measured by<br>
means known in the art, such as by standard tensile testing methods using standard tensile testing<br>
apparatuses, such as those manufactured by Instron, MTS, Thwing-Albert, and the like.<br>
In one embodiment second precursor web 21 can comprise substantially all MD-oriented<br>
fibers, e.g., tow fibers, such that there are substantially no fibers oriented in the CD. For such an<br>
embodiment of web 1 the fibers of second precursor web 21 can simply separate at the opening 4<br>
through which tufts 6 extend. In this embodiment, therefore, second precursor web 21 need not<br>
have any minimum elongation to break, since failure or rupture of the material is not the mode of<br>
forming opening 4.<br>
The number, spacing, and size of tufts 6 can be varied by changing the number, spacing,<br>
and size of teeth 110 and making corresponding dimensional changes as necessary to roll 104<br>
and/or roll 102. This variation, together with the variation possible in precursor webs 20, 21<br>
permits many varied webs 1 to be made for many purposes. For example, web 1 made from a<br>
first precursor web 20 comprising a relatively high basis weight woven fabric having MD and CD<br>
woven plastically-extensible threads and a second precursor web 21 comprising relatively high<br>
basis weight, relatively low-extensible synthetic polymer nonwoven material could be made into a<br>
strong, porous ground covering, such as an erosion control device useful for reducing sloping path<br>
deterioration and enabling growth of indigenous vegetation in unstable soil. A web 1 made from<br>
a first precursor web 20 comprising a relatively low basis weight nonwoven web of plastically-<br>
extensible spunbond polymer fibers and a second precursor web 21 comprising relatively low-<br>
extensible synthetic polymer film could be could be used as a terry cloth-like fabric for semi-<br>
durable or durable clothing, or for personal care items as are described in WO 01/76523. As<br>
described more fully below, a web 1 comprising a nonwoven/film first precursor web/second<br>
precursor web combination can also be used as a component in disposable absorbent articles.<br>
FIG. 6 shows in cross section a portion of the intermeshing rolls 102 and 104 and ridges<br>
106 and teeth 110. As shown teeth 110 have a tooth height TH (note that TH can also be applied<br>
to ridge height; in a preferred embodiment tooth height and ridge height are equal), and a tooth-to-<br>
tooth spacing (or ridge-to-ridge spacing) referred to as the pitch P. As shown, depth of<br>
engagement E is a measure of the level of intermeshing of rolls 102 and 104 and is measured<br>
from tip of ridge 106 to tip of tooth 110. The depth of engagement E, tooth height TH, and pitch<br>
P can be varied as desired depending on the properties of precursor webs 20, 21 and the desired<br><br>
characteristics of web 1. For example, in general, the greater the level of engagement E, the<br>
greater the necessary elongation or fiber-to-fiber mobility characteristics the fibers of first<br>
precursor web 20 must possess. Also, the greater the density of tufts 6 desired (tufts 6 per unit<br>
area of web 1), the smaller the pitch should be, and the smaller the tooth length TL and tooth<br>
distance TD should be, as described below.<br>
FIG. 7 shows one embodiment of a roll 104 having a plurality of teeth 110 useful for<br>
making a terry cloth-like web 1 from a nonwoven first precursor web 20 having a basis weight of<br>
between about 60 gsm and 100 gsm, preferably about 80 gsm and a polyolefinic film (e.g.,<br>
polyethylene or polypropylene) second precursor web 21 having a density of about 0.91-0.94 and<br>
a basis weight of about 20 gsm.<br>
An enlarged view of teeth 110 is shown in FIG. 8. In this embodiment of roll 104 teeth<br>
110 have a uniform circumferential length dimension TL measured generally from the leading<br>
edge LE to the trailing edge TE at the tooth tip 111 of about 1.25 mm and are uniformly spaced<br>
from one another circumferentially by a distance TD of about 1.5 mm. For making a terry-cloth<br>
web 1 from web 1 having a total basis weight in the range of about 60 to about 100 gsm, teeth 110<br>
of roll 104 can have a length TL ranging from about 0.5 mm to about 3 mm and a spacing TD<br>
from about 0.5 mm to about 3 mm, a tooth height TH ranging from about 0.5 mm to about 5 mm,<br>
and a pitch P between about 1 mm (0.040 inches) and about 5 mm (0.200 inches). Depth of<br>
engagement E can be from about 0.5 mm to about 5 mm (up to a maximum equal to tooth height<br>
TH). Of course, E, P, TH, TD and TL can be varied independently of each other to achieve a<br>
desired size, spacing, and area density of tufts 6 (number of tufts 6 per unit area of web 1).<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, each tooth 110 has a tip 111, a leading edge LC and a trailing edge<br>
TE. The tooth tip 111 is elongated and has a generally longitudinal orientation, corresponding to<br>
the longitudinal axes L of tufts 6 and discontinuities 16. It is believed that to get the tufted,<br>
looped tufts 6 of the web 1 that can be described as being terry cloth-like, the LE and TE should<br>
be very nearly orthogonal to the local peripheral surface 120 of roll 104. As well, the transition<br>
from the tip 111 and LE or TE should be a sharp angle, such as a right angle, having a<br>
sufficiently small radius of curvature such that teeth 110 push through second precursor web 21 at<br>
the LE and TE Without being bound by theory, it is believed that having relatively sharply<br>
angled tip transitions between the tip of tooth 110 and the LE and TE permits the teeth 110 to<br>
punch through precursor webs 20, 21 "cleanly", that is, locally and distinctly, so that the First side<br>
3 of the resulting web 1 can be described as "tufted" rather than "deformed." When so processed,<br>
the web 1 is not imparted with any particular elasticity, beyond what the precursor webs 20 and<br><br>
21 may have possessed originally. The punching through of the precursor web 21 may result in a<br>
small portion of the web 21 forming "confetti" or small pieces.<br>
At higher line speeds, i.e., relatively higher rates of processing of the web through the nip<br>
of rotating rolls 102 and 104, like materials can exhibit very different structures for tufts 6. The<br>
tuft 6 shown in FIG. 9 is similar in structure to the tuft shown in FIG. 2 but exhibits a very<br>
different structure, a structure that appears to be typical of spunbond nonwoven materials<br>
processed to form tufts 6 at relatively high speeds, i.e., at high strain rates. Typical of this<br>
structure is broken fibers between the proximal portion, i.e., base 17, of tufts 6 and the distal<br>
portion, i.e., the top 31, of tuft 6, and what appears to be a "mat" 19 of fibers at the top of the tuft<br>
6. Mat 19 comprises and is supported at the top of tufts 6 by unbroken, looped fibers 8, and also<br>
comprises portions of broken fibers 11 that are no longer integral with first precursor web 20.<br>
That is, mat 19 comprises fiber portions which were formerly integral with precursor web 20 but<br>
which are completely detached from precursor web 20 after processing at sufficiently high line<br>
speeds, e.g., 30 meters per minute line speed in the process described with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
Therefore, from the above description, it is understood that in one embodiment web 1 can<br>
be described as being a laminate web formed by selective mechanical deformation of at least a<br>
first and second precursor webs, at least the first precursor web being a nonwoven web, the<br>
laminate web having a first side, the first side comprising the second precursor web and a<br>
plurality of discrete tufts, each of the discrete tufts comprising fibers integral with but extending<br>
from the first precursor web and fibers neither integral with nor extending from the first precursor<br>
web.<br>
Although it is believed that the distinct fiber orientation observed at the distal portion 31<br>
of tufts 6, e.g., mat 19, is due primarily to processing rates, it is also believed to be affected by<br>
other parameters, such as fiber type and basis weight of the first precursor web 20 as well as<br>
processing temperatures that can affect the degree of fiber-to-Fiber bonding. Matting of fibers is<br>
believed to occur on the portion of tuft 6 associated during manufacturing with the tip of tooth<br>
110 of roll 104. It is believed that factional engagement of the fibers at the tip of the teeth "lock"<br>
the fibers in place, thereby limiting fiber elongation and/or fiber mobility, two mechanisms<br>
believed to permit formation of tufts 6. Therefore, once locked, so to speak, in position, fibers<br>
adjacent tooth 110 tip can be broken, and, due to the random entanglement of the precursor web<br>
as well as possible cold welding of fibers due to pressure and friction, the broken fibers 11<br>
become and remain lodged in mat 19 at the distal end 31 of tufts 6.<br><br>
First precursor webs 20 having relatively higher basis weights generally have relatively<br>
more fiber 11 portions in mat 19. In one sense, it appears as if most of the fiber content of the<br>
first precursor web 20 in the immediate vicinity of a tooth tip 110 during manufacture is simply<br>
displaced in the Z-direction to the distal portion 31 of tufts 6, resulting in mat 19. First precursor<br>
webs 20 comprising relatively low elongation fibers, or fibers with relatively low fiber-to-fiber<br>
mobility (e.g., relatively limited capability for fiber reptation) appear to result in relatively few<br>
fibers becoming and remaining lodged in mat 19 at the distal end 31 of tufts 6. Fiber-to-fiber<br>
mobility can be increased by reducing or eliminating the fiber-to-fiber bonds. Thermal bonds can<br>
be completely eliminated (i.e., avoided by not bonding), or significantly reduced in certain<br>
nonwoven webs to increase fiber-to-fiber mobility. Similarly, hydroentangled webs can be less<br>
entangled to increase fiber-to-fiber mobility. For any precursor web 20, lubricating it prior to<br>
processing as disclosed herein can also increase fiber-to-fiber mobility. For example, a mineral<br>
oil lubricant can be applied to first precursor web 20 prior to it entering the nip 116 of rolls 102<br>
and 104. Additionally, a plasticizing agent, such as petrolatum, can be added to some synthetic<br>
fiber webs, such as polyethylene or a polyethylene and polypropylene web, to increase<br>
extensibility.<br>
The result of the presence of mats 19 is a web 1 having a slightly rougher, textured<br>
impression on one side thereof, useful, for example, for wipes in which more scrubbing texture is<br>
desirable. In one sense a web having soft terry cloth-like tactile impression when made under<br>
relatively low-speed processing conditions, can have relatively abrasive feel when processed<br>
under identical, but relatively higher line speed conditions. This rough, textured tactile<br>
impression on a fibrous web can be useful for some applications, such as for a hard surface<br>
cleaning wipe or an exfoliating facial wipe. Therefore, whether the web 1 is desired to be soft and<br>
cloth-like for use with a mucilaginous substance to be applied to inflamed parts of the body, e.g.,<br>
a cataplasm, or as a conformable, semi-durable light abrasive for gently removing rust and<br>
oxidation from curved surfaces of metals, the rate of formation of tufts 6 can be adjusted to give<br>
the necessary texture.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that if the fibers of the first<br>
precursor web have a highly curvilinear shape, e.g., curled fibers, the resultant tufts 6 will have<br>
more looped fibers 8 and less broken fibers 18 as compared to more linear fiber conformations. It<br>
is believed that such fiber conformations have a lesser chance of bridging between two adjacent<br>
teeth, and, as a result they are less prone to be stretched beyond their breaking point, and thus<br>
have a greater chance of forming complete loop structures. Furthermore, such curvilinear-shaped<br><br>
fibers can be made by using eccentric bicomponent fibers, or side-by-side bicomponent fibers,<br>
such as bicomponent fibers consisting of polyethylene and nylon.<br>
It has been found that certain nonwoven webs, such as carded webs comprising staple-<br>
length fibers, when used as first precursor web 20 produce very few looped fibers 8 in tufts 6, so<br>
that the tufts 6 produced in these webs cannot be described as comprising a plurality of looped,<br>
aligned fibers 8 as described above with respect to FIGS. 1-4. Instead, carded nonwoven webs<br>
can produce tufts 6 having few, if any, looped, aligned fibers 8, and many, if not all, non-aligned<br>
fibers and/or broken fibers 18. It is believed that the non-alignment of fibers in tufts 6 made from<br>
carded webs is due in part to the nature of the fiber content of carded webs. Staple fibers are not<br>
"endless," but instead have a predetermined length on the order of about 15 mm to about 100 mm,<br>
and, more typically from about 40 mm to about 80 mm. Therefore, when a carded web is<br>
processed by the apparatus described with respect to FIG. 5, it is believed that there is a much<br>
greater likelihood that a loose fiber end will be in the vicinity of a tuft 6 and thus produce a non-<br>
looped fiber end in tuft 6. Furthermore, often staple fibers do not have the same elongation<br>
characteristics of spunbond or meltblown fibers, for example. However, even if tufts 6 have no<br>
looped fibers, the fibrous tufts can nevertheless provide a softness benefit and produce a web<br>
having terry cloth-like characteristics.<br>
Therefore, from the above description, it is understood that in one embodiment web 1 can<br>
be described as being a laminate web formed by selective mechanical deformation of at least a<br>
first and second precursor webs, at least the first precursor web being a nonwoven web, the<br>
laminate web having a first side, the first side comprising the second precursor web and a<br>
plurality of discrete tufts, the tufts comprising a plurality of fibers integral with but extending<br>
from said first region.<br>
If a woven first precursor web 20 is utilized, the formation and structure of tufts 6 can be<br>
very close to the same as that exhibited by tufts 6 formed from nonwoven webs. For example, if a<br>
woven first precursor web 20 has extensible warp and/or weft threads predominantly oriented in a<br>
cross machine direction, upon being processed by the apparatus 100 described above, the teeth<br>
110 tend to separate the machine direction threads (either warp or weft) and only urge out of plane<br>
the cross-machine direction threads. Thus, the web 1 produced from a woven first precursor web<br>
20 can look and feel very much like terry cloth fabric.<br>
In preferred embodiments first precursor web 20 is a nonwoven web in which there arc<br>
minimal fiber-to-fiber bonds. For example, the precursor web can be a nonwoven web having a<br>
pattern of discrete thermal point bonds, as is commonly known in the art for nonwoven webs. In<br><br>
general, however, it is desirable to minimize the number of bond points and maximize the spacing<br>
so as to allow for maximum fiber mobility and dislocation at during formation of tufts 6. In<br>
general, utilizing fibers having relatively high diameters, and/or relatively high extension to break,<br>
and/or relatively high fiber mobility, results in better and more distinctly formed tufts 6.<br>
Although web 1 is disclosed in preferred embodiments as a two layer web made from two<br>
precursor webs, it is not necessary that it be limited to two layers. For example, a three-layer or<br>
more laminate can be made from three precursor webs, as long as one of the precursor webs can<br>
extend and push through openings in another layer to form tufts. For example, web 1 could<br>
comprise the top sheet, secondary topsheet, and core of hygiene products. In general, it is not<br>
necessary that adhesive or other bonding means be utilized to make laminate web 1.<br>
The constituent layers of web 1 (e.g., precursor webs 20 and 21 and any other layers) can<br>
be held in a face-to-face laminated relationship by virtue of the "locking" effect of the tufts 6 that<br>
extend through openings 4 in second precursor web 21. In some embodiments it may be desirable<br>
to use adhesives or thermal bonding or other bonding means, depending on the end use<br>
application of web 1. For example, a web 1 comprising bicomponent fiber nonwoven webs can<br>
be through-air bonded after formation of tufts 6 to provide for layer-to-layer adhesion for greater<br>
peel strength. Additionally, it may be desirable to apply adhesive to at least a portion of one of<br>
the precursor webs. For example, in some embodiments adhesive, chemical bonding, resin or<br>
powder bonding, or thermal bonding between layers can be selectively applied to certain regions<br>
or all of the precursor webs. In the case of adhesive application, for example, adhesive can be<br>
applied in a continuous manner, such as by slot coating, or in a discontinuous manner, such as by<br>
spraying, extruding, and the like. Discontinuous application of adhesive can be in the form of<br>
stripes, bands, droplets, and the like.<br>
Although web 1 is disclosed in preferred embodiments as comprising a nonwoven first<br>
precursor web, in practice, any of the precursor webs can be nonwoven webs, polymer films,<br>
woven webs, or paper webs. Of course, regardless of the web characterization, the first precursor<br>
web must have sufficient material properties such as extensibility and yield-to-break to be locally<br>
deformed into discrete tufts. Likewise, the second precursor web must have relatively less<br>
extensibility or yield-to-break, such that it ruptures when processed according to the method<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
In a multilayer web 1 each precursor web can have different material properties, thereby<br>
providing web 1 with beneficial properties. For example, web 1 comprising two (or more)<br>
precursor webs, e.g., first and second precursor webs, can have beneficial fluid handling<br><br>
properties for use as a topshect on a disposable absorbent article, as described more fully below.<br>
For superior fluid handling, for example, first precursor web 20 can be comprised of relatively<br>
hydrophilic fibers. Second precursor web 21 can be polymer film, e.g., a polyethylene film, and<br>
can be hydrophobic or rendered hydrophobic. The tufts 6 of such a web could form an upper<br>
layer, i.e., a body-contacting layer when used as a topsheet on a disposable absorbent article.<br>
Fluid deposited upon the upper, relatively hydrophilic tufts is quickly transported away from the<br>
relatively hydrophobic film to the portion of the first precursor web underlying the second film<br>
precursor web layer. One reason for the observed rapid fluid transport is the capillary structures<br>
formed by the generally aligned fibers 8, 18 of tufts 6. The fibers 8, 18 form directionally-aligned<br>
capillaries between adjacent fibers, and the capillary action is enhanced by the general<br>
convergence of fibers near the base 17 of tufts 6.<br>
It is believed that the rapid fluid transport is further increased due to the ability of fluid to<br>
enter the web 1 via the voids 10 defined by looped tufts 6. This "lateral entry" capability and/or<br>
capillary action, and/or the hydrophilicity gradient afforded by the structure of web 1 makes web<br>
1 an ideal material for optimal fluid handling for disposable absorbent articles. In particular, a<br>
multilayer web 1 can provide for even greater improvement in fluid handling characteristics.<br>
Depending on the precursor webs 20 and 21 utilized and the dimensional parameters of<br>
rolls 102 and, including teeth 110, web 1 of the present invention can exhibit a wide range of<br>
physical properties. The web 1 can exhibit a range of texture subjectively experienced as ranging<br>
from softness to roughness, an absorbency ranging from non-absorbent to very absorbent, a<br>
bulkiness ranging from relatively low bulk to relatively high bulk; a tear strength ranging from<br>
low tear strength to high tear strength; an elasticity ranging from non-elastic to at least 100%<br>
elastically extensible, a chemical resistance ranging from relatively low resistance to high<br>
resistance, depending on the chemical considered, and many other variable parameters generally<br>
described as shielding performance, alkali resistance, opacity, wiping performance, water<br>
absorptivity, oil absorptivity, moisture permeability, heat insulating properties, weatherability,<br>
high strength, high tear force, abrasion resistance, electrostatic controllability, drape, dye-effinity,<br>
safety and the like. In general, depending on the elongation properties of the first precursor web<br>
20, the dimensions of apparatus 100 can be varied to produce a web 1 having a wide range of<br>
dimensions associated with tufts 6, including the height h (as shown in FIG. 3), and spacing<br>
(including area density of tufts 6). Additionally, the tufts may be easily patterned into lines, filled<br>
forms, and selective regions of the laminate web by having the desired pattern displayed in the<br>
teeth 110 on the roll 104.<br><br>
Web 1 may be used for a wide variety of applications, including various filter sheets such<br>
as air filter, bag filter, liquid filter, vacuum filter, water drain filter, and bacterial shielding filter;<br>
sheets for various electric appliances such as capacitor separator paper, and floppy disk packaging<br>
material; various industrial sheets such as tacky adhesive tape base cloth, oil absorbing material,<br>
and paper felt; various wiper sheets such as wipers for homes, services and medical treatment,<br>
printing roll wiper, wiper for cleaning copying machine, baby wipers, and wiper for optical<br>
systems; various medicinal and sanitary sheets, such as surgical gown, gown, covering cloth, cap,<br>
mask, sheet, towel, gauze, base cloth for cataplasm, diaper, diaper liner, diaper cover, feminine<br>
napkin covers, feminine napkin or diaper acquisition layer (underneath the cover layer), diaper<br>
core, tampon liners, base cloth for adhesive plaster, wet towel, and tissue; various sheets for<br>
clothes, such as padding cloth, pad, jumper liner, and disposable underwear; various life material<br>
sheets such as base cloth for artificial leather and synthetic leather, table top, wall paper, blind,<br>
wrapping, and packages for drying agents, shopping bag, suit cover, and pillow cover; various<br>
agricultural sheets, such as ground covers and erosion control devices, cooling and sun light-<br>
shielding cloth, lining curtain, sheet for overall covering, light-shielding sheet, wrapping materials<br>
of pesticides, underlining paper of pots for seeding growth; various protection sheets such as fume<br>
prevention mask and dust prevention mask, laboratory gown, and dust preventive clothes; various<br>
sheets for civil engineering building, such as house wrap, drain material, filtering medium,<br>
separation material, overlay, roofing, tuft and carpet base cloth, wall interior material, soundproof<br>
or vibration reducing sheet, and curing sheet; and various automobile interior sheets, such as floor<br>
mat and trunk mat, molded ceiling material, head rest, and lining cloth, in addition to a separator<br>
sheet in alkaline batteries. Other uses include utilizing web 1 as a wipe for personal cleansing or<br>
hygiene, such as for a baby wipe, facial cloth or wipe, or body cloth.<br>
in one embodiment, web 1 or a composite comprising web 1 can be utilized as a fecal<br>
material storage element. Web 1 can be utilized as a secondary topsheet or sublayer when it is<br>
disposed under an apertured web or film to accept and hold low viscosity feces or viscous bodily<br>
waste away from a wearer's skin after defecation. Embodiments of the present invention having<br>
larger total three dimensional volume within the web or between the tufts 6 generally provide a<br>
greater capacity for storage of low viscosity feces. Absorbent articles employing such fecal<br>
material storage elements, or sublayers, arc described in U.S. patents 5,941,864; 5,957,906;<br>
6,018,093; 6,010,491; 6,186,992; and 6,414,215, among others.<br>
In one embodiment, web 1 comprises a nonwoven first precursor web 20 comprising a<br>
spunbond nonwoven having a basis weight of about 80 gsm, and comprising<br><br>
polyethylene/polypropylene (sheath/core) bicomponent fibers having an average diameter of<br>
about 33 microns, and a second precursor web comprising a polyethylene film having a basis<br>
weight of 20 gsm. In this embodiment, web 1 has about 24 tufts 6 per square centimeter, the tufts<br>
6 having a plurality of looped, aligned fibers 8, each of which has an average fiber diameter of<br>
about 18 microns. A web of this type can be beneficially used as a topsheet for disposable<br>
absorbent articles, as shown below with reference to FIG. 10. For example, such a web 1 is fluid<br>
impermeable except in the regions of the tufts 6 which can wick fluid from the first side 3 of web<br>
1 to the second side 5.<br>
FIG. 10 shows in partial cut away plan view a sanitary napkin having as one of its<br>
components a web 1 of the present invention. In general, sanitary napkin 200 comprises a<br>
backsheet 202, a topsheet 206 and an absorbent core 204 disposed between the topsheet 206 and<br>
backsheet 202 which can be joined about a the periphery 210. Sanitary napkin 1 can have side<br>
extensions, commonly referred to as "wings" 208 designed to wrap the sides of the crotch region<br>
of the panties of the user of sanitary napkin 1. Sanitary napkins, including topsheets for use as the<br>
body facing surface thereof, are well known in the art and need no detailed description of various<br>
alternative and optional designs. In addition to sanitary napkins, web 1 can also be used in a<br>
diaper or adult incontinence product or other disposable hygiene products. However, it is noted<br>
that web 1 can be used as, or as a component of, one or more of a backsheet, core material,<br>
topsheet, secondary topsheet, or wing material. Web 1 can also have multiple layers and<br>
comprise a topsheet, secondary topsheet, core, backsheet, or any number of layers.<br>
Web 1 is especially useful as a topsheet 206 of sanitary napkin 200. Web 1 is particularly<br>
beneficial as a topsheet 206 for sanitary napkins due to the combination of excellent fluid<br>
acquisition and distribution to the absorbent core 204, and excellent prevention of rewet to the<br>
body-facing surface of topsheet 206 when in use. Rewet can be a result of at least two causes: (1)<br>
squeezing out of the absorbed fluid due to pressure on the sanitary napkin 200; and/or (2) wetness<br>
entrapped within or on the topsheet 206. In a preferred topsheet 206 both properties, fluid<br>
acquisition and fluid retention, are maximized and rewet is minimized. Said differently,<br>
preferably a topsheet will exhibit high rates of fluid acquisition, and low levels of rewet.<br>
A topsheet 206 can be made by using a nonwoven first precursor web 20 and a fluid<br>
impermeable polyethylene film second precursor wcb 21. The basis weights of the component<br>
webs can be varied, however, in general due to cost and benefit considerations a total basis weight<br>
of between about 20 gsm and 80 gsm is desirable for web 1. When made as a film/nonwoven<br>
laminate, web 1 combines the softness and fluid capillarity of fiber tufts and the rewet prevention<br><br>
of a fluid impermeable polymer film. When a sanitary napkin is used having a topsheet 206<br>
comprising web 1 with first side 3 being the body-facing side, and the second side S being in fluid<br>
communication with an underlying absorbent core, fluid can be acquired by tufts 6 on first side 3<br>
of web 1 and wicked through second precursor web 21 to second side 5 of web 1 which can then<br>
be desorbed to the absorbent core 204. Because tufts 6 are discrete and spaced apart, and are<br>
separated by a fluid impermeable second precursor web 21, rewet can be minimized.<br>
Alternatively, web 1 could be used with first side 3 being the fluid communication side and<br>
second side 5 being the body-facing side. This enables the discontinuities 16 to potentially allow<br>
fluid to be transported into or through the tufts 6.<br>
FIG. 11 shows in partial cut away perspective view a catamenial tampon 300 having as<br>
one of its components a web 1 of the present invention. In general, tampon 300 comprises a<br>
compressed absorbent core 302 and a fluid permeable cover wrap 304 that covers absorbent core<br>
302. Cover wrap 304 may extend beyond one end of absorbent core 302 to form a skirt portion<br>
306. A removal means, such as string 308 can be provided to facilitate removal of the tampon<br>
after use. Tampons, including cover wraps for use as the body contacting surface thereof, are well<br>
known in the art and need no detailed description of various alternative and oprional designs.<br>
However, it is noted that web 1 can be used as, or as a component of, one or more of a cover<br>
wrap, absorbent core material, or removal means material.<br>
Table 1 below shows representative examples of webs 1 according to the present<br>
invention, along with dimensions relative to the apparatus 100 used in the process to make them,<br>
as disclosed hcrcinabovc. A brief description of each Sample listed follows Table 1<br>
Table 1: Examples of Apparatus Dimensional Parameters and Web Dimensions<br><br><br><br>
FIG. 12 is a photomicrograph of Sample 1. The first precursor web of Sample 1 was a<br>
carded PET nonwoven web having a basis weight of 145 grams per square meter (gsm) that was<br>
hand carded from 38 mm (1.5 inch) staple length polyester/co-polyester trilobal-shaped fibers,<br>
typs F30A. from FIT (Fiber Innovation Technology) Inc., Johnson City, TN. The second<br>
precursor web of Sample 1 was a low density polyethylene (LDPE) film having a caliper of 0.1<br>
mm (0.004 inch) made by Huntsman Film Products Co., Carrolton OH, designated as X420.<br>
Sample 1 was produced on an apparatus as described above with respect to FIG. 5 at a line speed<br>
of approximately 3 meters per minute (10 feet per minute). As shown in FIG. 12, flap 7 extends<br>
about significantly out of the plane of the second precursor web (i.e., the film layer) and covers<br>
approximately half of the tuft 6. As noted above, this can be desirable where a more stiff, resilient<br>
tuft 6 is desired<br>
FIG. 13 is a photomicrograph of Sample 2. The first precursor web of Sample 2 was a<br>
spunbond PE/PP 50/50 core/sheath nonwoven web having a basis weight of 30 gsm and was<br>
made by BBA, Simpsonville SC. The second precursor web of Sample 2 was aluminum foil<br>
obtained by removing (i.e., by rubbing) the adhesive off of Fasson® 1803 aluminum foil tape<br><br>
from Avery Dennison, U.S. Specialty Tape Division, Painesville OH. Sample 2 was produced on<br>
an apparatus as described above with respect to FIG. 5 at a line speed of approximately 3 meters<br>
per minute (10 feet per minute). As shown in FIG. 13, aluminum foil tends to split open, with<br>
very little plastic deformation of flaps 7.<br>
FIG. 14 is a photomicrograph of Sample 3. The first precursor web of Sample 3 is a<br>
spunbond PE/PP 50/50 core/sheath nonwoven having a basis weight of 30 gs;m and was made by<br>
BBA, Simpsonville SC. The second precursor web of Sample 3 was brown 100% recycled 30 1b<br>
Kraft packaging paper available from any source of Kraft paper, e.g., Uline Shipping Supplies,<br>
Waukegan, IL. Sample 3 was produced on an apparatus as described above with respect to FIG. 5<br>
at a line speed of approximately 3 meters per minute (10 feet per minute). As shown in FIG. 14,<br>
a second precursor web of Kraft paper can result in openings 4 and flaps 7 that resemble a<br>
volcano-shaped opening.<br>
FIG. 15 is a photomicrograph of Sample 4, which comprises three precursor webs. The<br>
first and third precursor webs of Sample 4 were a spunbond polypropylene nonwoven having a<br>
basis weight of 13.5 gsm, designated NW30 from First Quality Nonwovens, Haxleton, PA. The<br>
first and third precursor webs were the outer layers, sandwiching the second precursor web which<br>
was a loosely bonded airlaid nonwoven web made from 44 mm (1.75 inch) long staple fibers<br>
comprising polyester fibers and PE/PP 50/50 core/sheath nonwoven bicomponent binder fibers in<br>
an 80/20 fiber ratio by weight, respectively. The polyester fibers were Type 1311 fibers and the<br>
PE/PP fibers were Type 851607 fibers, both fibers being available from FIT (Fiber Innovation<br>
Technology) Inc., Johnson City, TN. Sample 4 was produced on an apparatus as described above<br>
with respect to FIG. 5 at a line speed of approximately 30 meters per minute (100 feet per<br>
minute). As shown in FIG. 15, in some embodiments of web 1 there may be no flaps 7 to speak<br>
of, but only a slight disruption of second precursor web around the opening through which tufts 6<br>
extend. The tufts 6 shown in FIG. 15 can be seen to comprise two fiber types. Fibers from both<br>
the middle, sandwiched airlaid web, and one of the outer layers contribute to the tuft 6.<br>
As can be understood from the above description of webs 1 and apparatus 100 of the<br>
present invention, many various structures of webs 1 can be made without departing from the<br>
scope of the present invention as claimed in the appended claims. For example, webs 1 can be<br>
coated or treated with lotions, medicaments, cleaning fluids, anti-bacterial solutions, emulsions,<br>
fragrances, surfactants. Likewise, apparatus 100 can be configured to only farm tufts 6 on a<br>
portion of the web 1, or to form varying sizes or area densities of tufts 6.<br><br>
Another advantage of the process described to produce the webs of the present invention<br>
is that the webs can be produced in-line with other web production equipment or in-line with<br>
disposable absorbent article production equipment. Additionally, there may be other solid state<br>
formation processes that can be used either prior to or after the process of the present invention.<br>
For example, a web could be processed according to the present invention and then apertured with<br>
a stretching process, such as one described in US Patent No. 5,658,639 to Curro et al.<br>
Alternatively, a material could be made into a composite through a variety of processes, such as<br>
one described in US Publication No. 2003/028,165A1 to Curro et al. or ring rolled, for example as<br>
in US Patent No. 5,167,897 to Weber et al. and then processed according to the present invention.<br>
The resulting webs can thus exhibit the combined benefits of these multiple material<br>
modifications.<br>
All documents cited in the Detailed Description of the Invention are, in relevant part,<br>
incorporated herein by reference; the citation of any document is not to be construed as an<br>
admission that it is prior art with respect to the present invention.<br>
While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and<br>
described, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and<br>
modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is<br>
therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are<br>
within the scope of this invention.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A laminate web (1) comprising a first (20) and<br>
second (21) precursor webs, at least the first<br>
