CROSSLINKABLE HIGH PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE COMPOSITION, A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF, A PIPE AND A CABLE<br>
PREPARED THEREOF<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a crosslinkable high pressure polyethylene composition containing ethylene silane copolymer resin having a content of silane of about 0.1 to 10 weight% and at least one silanol condensation catalyst. The invention further re-lates to a' process for the preparation thereof, to a pipe made of said composition and .to the use of the composi-tion as an insulation for a cable.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Presently commercially available ethylene-vinyltri-methoxysilane copolymer resins having a vinyltrimethoxy-silane (VTMS) content in the range of about 1.0-2.0 weight% and a density below 925 kg/m3 are not suitable for pipe applications within the segment of plumbing and heating. Such water crosslinkable polyolefin pipes (PEX-b) do not have the properties required to pass the qual-ity control point of hydrostatic pressure resistance at 95°C in accordance with i. e. the German medium density norm for PEX pipes, DIN 16894. The lifetime of a pipe according to this norm should be at least 1000 hour at 95°C, the circumferential stress in the pipe wall being 2.8 MPa. At a temperature as high as 95°C the hydrostatic pressure resistance of the commercially available pipe above is very week and such a pipe has a lifetime of less than 1 hour, i. e. the time to failure is less than 1 hour.<br>
Attempts have been made in order to improve the hydrostatic pressure resistance of pipes made of ethyl-ene- vinyltrimethoxy silane copolymer resins by increasing<br><br>
WO 2005/023908	PCT/EP2004/009630<br>
the density of the copolymer resin by mixing the resin with a high density polyethylene polymer (HDPE, i. e. PE made by low pressure polymerization). However, incorpora-ting about 30 weight% high density polyethylene polymer into the resin and thereby increasing the density thereof to 934 kg/m does not result in an increased lifetime. Accordingly such pipes will not pass the quality control of DIN 16894.<br>
Ethylene-vinylsilane copolymers, such as e. g. Visico™, may also be used for moisture crosslinking within the field of cable insulations. However, the prior art silane crosslinked polyethylene insulation materials have exhibited problems with so called xxfrozen layers", i. e. the molecules of the co-polymer will not have the time to relax when they hit the cold conductor and this will in turn lead to a thin layer of highly oriented molecules being formed close to the conductor. Such orientation of the molecules leads to deterioration of the mechanical properties. Previously, this problem has been solved by preheating the conductor or by decreasing the shear stresses by using a tube on die in stead of a pressure die. However, the investment in a preheater in-duces higher costs. Furthermore, a reduction of the die pressure by using a tube on die leads to a deterioration of the wetting properties, and this in turn involves re-duced adhesion properties betw'een the conductor and the insulation material.<br>

Other objects, features, advantages and preferred embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.<br>
Detailed description of preferred embodiments<br>
It is well known to use additives to crosslink poly-mers since this improves most of the properties of the polymer such as heat resistance, chemical resistance and mechanical strength, etc. Crosslinking may be performed by condensation of silanol groups contained in the poly-mer which can be obtained by hydrolysation of silane groups. For the crosslinking of such polymers, a silanol condensation catalyst must be used. Conventional cata-lysts are for example tin-organic compounds such as di-butyl tin dilaurate (DBTDL). It is further known that the crosslinking process advantageously may be carried out in the presence of acidic silanol condensation catalysts, such as e. g. Ambicat™ from Borealis AB.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention the crosslinking process is carried out in the presence of a silanol condensation catalyst comprising a compound of formula (I):<br>
ArSO3H (I)<br>
or a precursor thereof, Ar being a hydrocarbyl sub-stituted aromatic group comprising at least 14 carbon atoms. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention the polymer composition is crosslinked in the<br><br>
WO 2005/023908	PCT/EP2004/009630<br>
presence of a silanol condensation catalyst, preferably dibutyl-tin-dilaurate.<br>
By additionally admixing of 
The present invention will now be illustrated by way of non-limiting examples of preferred embodiments in or-der to further facilitate the understanding of the inven-tion.<br>
Examples Example 1<br>
Tests were performed on pipes produced from differ-ent polymer compositions and the results are shown below in table 1.<br>
The following polymers were used in the examples:<br>
Polymer A: High pressure produced ethylene-vinyl trimethoxysilane copolymer having a density of 930.5 kg/m3, MFR2.i6=l-9 g/10 min and a VTMS content of 1.9 weight%. Produced in a tubular reactor at 2550 bar and 250°C.<br>
Polymer B: High pressure produced ethylene-vinyl trimethoxysilane copolymer having a density of 925 kg/m3, MFR2.i6=0.9 g/10 min and a VTMS content of 1.25 weight%. Produced in a tubular reactor at 2400 bar and 280°C.<br>
Polymer C: High pressure produced ethylene-vinyl-trimethoxysilane copolymer having a density of 922 kg/m3, MFR2.i6=0.9 g/10 min and a VTMS content of 1.25 weight%. Produced in a tubular reactor at 2300 bar and 310°C.<br>
Polymer D: High pressure produced ethylene-vinyl-trimethoxysilane copolymer having a density of 922 kg/m3, MFR2.i6=0.9 g/10 min and a VTMS content of 1.9 weight%. Produced in a tubular reactor at 2300 bar and 310°C.<br><br>
WO 2005/023908	PCT/EP2004/009630<br>
Polymer M-l: High density polyethylene (i. e. low pressure polyethylene) having a density of 954 kg/m3 and MFR2.i6=4 g/10 min.<br>
Polymer M-2: High density grafted silane PEX polymer (i. e. silane grafted, cross-linked, low pressure polyethylene) having a density of 950 kg/m and MFR5.o=l g/10 min.<br>
PVC-Jacket: typical PVC jacket formulation consist-ing of 20% plastisizer, e. g. dioctylphtalate, DOP, 20 weight% chalk and lead stabilizer.<br>
Catalyst master batch CMB-1: In all examples 5% of CMB-1 was dry blended into the polymers prior to extru-sion. CMB-1 consists of 1.7% d.odecylbenzenesulphonic acid crosslinking catalyst, drying agent and antioxidants mixed into an ethylene butylacrylate copolymer. Butyl-acrylate content: 17 weight%, MFR2=4.5 g/10 min.<br>
Catalyst master batch CMB-2 consists of a standard tin silanol condensation catalyst dibutyl-tin-dilaurate (1%) and antioxidants mixed into a high density polyeth-ylene. In all pipe examples 5% of CMB-2 was dry blended into the polymers prior to extrusion. The blend was ex-truded to 32x3 mm natural pipes which were kept in a wa-ter bath at 95°C for at least 16 hours. Each pipe was pressure tested according to DIN 16894/16892.<br>
The tested cables were manufactured in the following way: Cables consisting of an 8 mm2 compact aluminium con-ductor and an insulation thickness of 0.7 mm were pro-duced in a Nokia-Maillefer 60 mm extruder at a line speed of 75 m/min.<br>
Die: Pressure (wire guide 3.1 mm, die 4.4 mm).<br>
Conductor temperature: 20°C (non-pre-heated conduc-tor) or 110°C (pre-heated conductor).<br>
Cooling bath temperature: 23°C.<br>
Screws:Elise.<br>
Temperature profile:170-180-190-190-190-190-190-190°C.<br><br>
WO 2005/023908	PCT/EP2004/009630<br>
5% of the crosslinking catalyst master batch CMB-1 was dry blended into the polymers prior to extrusion.<br>
In order to measure the influence of plastisizer mi-gration the cable core produced according to the descrip-tion above was coated with a 2 mm PVC jacket. The Me-chanical evaluation of the cables were performed accord-ing to ISO 527.<br>
From table I it is clearly shown that by increasing the density of the copolymer resin (polymer D) by blending with a high density polyethylene polymer (30 weight% polymer M-l) will not result in passing the quality control point of pressure resistance at 95°C, see table 1. By increasing the density of the ethylene-vinyltri-methoxysilane copolymer base resin to 930 kg/m (polymer A) the extruded and afterwards crosslinked pipes pass the quality control point of pressure resistance at 95°C as stated in the German medium density norm for MD-PEX pipes, DIN 16894.<br>
Example 2<br>
By blending high density polyethylene into the eth-ylene-vinyltrimethoxysilane copolymer (polymer A) the hydrostatic pressure resistance will be increased. In table 2 belowf the hydrostatic pressure behaviour of the<br><br>
WO 2005/023908	PCT7EP2004/009630<br>
medium density ethylene-vinyltrimethoxysilane copolymer (polymer A) and a blend of this silane copolymer with 15 weight% and 30 weight% high density polyethylene (polymer M-l) are shown. The gel content should preferably be &gt;65% as measured according to ASTM D 2765.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
4 0 weight% of silane crosslinkable medium density polyethylene (MEPE) product polymer A having a density of 930 kg/m3 was blended with 30 weight% of grafted silane crosslinked PEX high density polyethylene product polymer M-2 with a density of 950 kg/m3 and 30 weight% of high density polyethylene product polymer M-l having a density of 954 kg/m3. The pressure resistance in accordance with the quality.control point of pressure resistance at 95°C as stated in the German high density norm for HD-PEX pipes., DIN 16892. The gel content should preferably be &gt;65%, measured according to ASTM D 2765.<br><br><br>
WO 2005/023908	PCT/EP2004/009630<br>
Example A<br>
In order to investigate the need of preheating the conductor cables were produced with and without preheating of the conductors as described above. Some cable cores were coated with a 2 mm PVC jacket and aged in a heating oven at 100°C for 168 hours. The results are presented in table 4.<br><br>
The results presented in table 5 show that polymers A and B fulfil the specified requirements (e. g. VDE 0273-603) without any need of preheating or use of pro-tection layers between the PVC jacket and the insulation.<br><br>
