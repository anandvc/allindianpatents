				<td>BACKGROUND OF THF INVENTION<br>
a) Field of the Invention<br>
 This invention relates to pigment compositions, a<br>
production process thereof, colorants and colored articles.<br>
More specifically, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide pigment compositions comprising, as a principal<br>
component, pronouncedly reddish ?-copper phthalocyanine<br>
(hereinafter abbreviated as "the component A" or "the ?-form")<br>
and suitable for a variety of coloring applications,<br>
a) Description of the Related Art<br>
 Among all pigments, copper phthalocyanine pigment is<br>
especially stable, is excellent in a variety of fastness, and<br>
has many crystal forms. Of these crystal forms, those known<br>
to have already found actual industrial use include a-copper<br>
phthalocyanine (hereinafter abbreviated as "the component A-l"<br>
or "the ?-form"), ?-copper phthalocyanine (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated as "the ?-form") , and the ?-form. It is a common<br>
practice to use the ?-form in applications to impart a greenish<br>
blue color and the a-form in applications to impart a reddish<br>
blue color. The ?-form is, however, employed when impartation<br>
of a blue color more reddish than that available from the use<br>
of the a-form is required.<br>
In a variety of coloring applications, however, there is<br>
an outstanding demand to impart a blue color still more reddish<br>
than that available from the use of the ?-form. Such a<br>
pronouncedly reddish color tone cannot be realized with a single<br>
copper phthalocyanine pigment. In general, there is hence no<br>
choice other than relying upon use of a mixture of copper<br>
phthalocyanine and a pigment more reddish than copper<br>
phthalocyanine. Mixing of two or more pigments, however, leads<br>
to a reduction in tone when they are mixed in the form of powders<br>
or colorants and are then used. Therefore, the color tone so<br>
obtained is unavoidably accompanied with reductions in<br>
saturation and vividness and also with a decrease in<br>
transmittance.<br>
With a view to lessening these problems, attempts have<br>
been made to mix two or more pigments in the course of<br>
conditioning such that the resulting pigment mixture shows a<br>
behavior similar to a single pigment. Such attempts include,<br>
for example, dry grinding of a phthalocyanine pigment and<br>
another pigment into a pigment mixture. Even with the pigment<br>
mixture obtained by this method, however, tinting power and<br>
vividness are still insufficient.<br>
 As a method for lessening the above-described drawbacks<br>
of dry grinding and imparting better homogeneity to the<br>
resulting mixed pigment, it has also been proposed to produce<br>
a pigment mixture by wet grinding. The pigment mixture obtained<br>
by this method is excellent in both dispersibility and vividness,<br>
but fails to exhibit particularly good properties in heat<br>
resistance, solvent resistance, light fastness and .<br>
weatherability.<br>
Even if the processing of pigments is performed by<br>
grinding as described above or by another method, a pigment<br>
mixture which can produce the above-described still more<br>
reddish blue color cannot be obtained unless the processing<br>
forms only the ?-crystal form, which shows a blue tone with a<br>
reddish-purple tinge, as the crystal form of the processed<br>
copper phthalocyanine pigment as a base colorant.<br>
 It is also known to form copper a phthalocyanine pigment<br>
and another pigment into a pigment composition by dissolving<br>
them in sulfuric acid and then causing them to co-precipitate<br>
in water. However, the copper phthalocyanine pigment in the<br>
pigment composition obtained by this process has all been<br>
transformed into the ?-form, so that the color tone of the copper<br>
phthalocyanine pigment itself as a color base is more greenish<br>
than the ?-form. This process, therefore, cannot provide a<br>
pigment which produces the above-described still more reddish<br>
blue color.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is, therefore, to<br>
eliminate the above-described drawbacks of the conventional ar1<br><br>
and to provide a copper phthalocyanine pigment composition<br>
comprising a mixture of the more reddish ?-form and another<br>
pigment and capable of producing a vivid reddish-blue color.<br>
 The present inventors have proceeded with extensive<br>
research to achieve the above object. As a result, it has been<br>
found that a pigment composition, which comprises the ?-form<br>
as a principal component and is a more homogeneous mixture, can<br>
be obtained by transforming the a-form into the ?-form in a<br>
pigment mixture of the ?-form and another pigment, leading to<br>
the completion of the present invention.<br>
 The above-described object can be achieved by the present<br>
invention to be described hereinafter. Described specifically,<br>
the present invention provides a pigment composition comprising<br>
a wet-ground pigment mixture of the following components (A)<br>
and (B):<br>
(A)	?-copper phthalocyanine, and<br>
(B)	at least one pigment selected from a group consisting<br>
of condensed polycyclic pigments and azo pigments;<br>
wherein a weight ratio of the component (A) to the<br>
component (B) is 100:0.1 to 100:50.<br>
A first process according to the present invention for<br>
the production of the pigment composition comprises wet-<br>
grinding (A-l) ?-copper phthalocyanine and the component (B)<br>
at a weight ratio of from 100:0.1 to 100:50 in a non-aromatic<br>
solvent.<br><br>
A second process according to the present invention for<br>
the production of the pigment composition comprises dry-<br>
grinding the components (A-l) and (B) at a weight ratio, of from<br>
100:0.1 to 100:50 to obtain a dry-ground pigment mixture; and<br>
then wet-grinding the dry-ground pigment mixture in a non-<br>
aromatic solvent.<br>
A third process according to the present invention for<br>
the production of the pigment composition comprises adding<br>
(A-2) copper phthalocyanine of any crystal form and the<br>
component (B) at a weight ratio of from 100:0.1 to 100:50 into<br>
an at least 60 wt.% aqueous solution of sulfuric acid; pouring<br>
the resultant aqueous sulfuric acid solution into water to have<br>
the component (A-2) transformed in crystal form into the ?-<br>
form such that a pigment mixture of the component (A-l) and the<br>
component (B) is obtained; and then wet-grinding the thus-<br>
obtained pigment mixture of the component (A-2) and the<br>
component (B) in a non-aromatic solvent.<br>
In all applications, for example, in coloring plastics,<br>
paints, printing inks, textile printing agents,<br>
electrophotographic toners, color filters, ink-jet inks, heat<br>
transfer inks and the like, the pigment composition according<br>
to the present invention is useful as a colorant improved in<br>
heat resistance, solvent resistance, light fastness and<br>
weatherability while producing a color tone more pronouncedly<br>
reddish than conventional copper phthalocyanine pigments<br><br>
without causing reductions in saturation and vividness and a<br>
decrease in transmittance.<br>

further detail based on preferred embodiments.<br>
The pigment composition according to the present<br>
invention contains the component (A) (?-form) and the component<br>
(B) [a pigment other than the component (A) ] . On the other hand,<br>
the first to third processes according to the present invention<br>
for the production of the pigment composition are each<br>
characterized in that in a mixed system of the component (A-l)<br>
(?-form) or the component (A-2) (copper phthalocyanine of any<br>
crystal form) and the component (B), the component A-l or the<br>
component A-2 is transformed in crystal form into the component<br>
A.<br>
Firstly, a description will be made about the individual<br>
components which make up the pigment composition according to<br>
the present invention. The component (A) itself is known to<br><br>
the public. The component (B) which is mixed with the component<br>
(A) is at least one pigment selected from condensed polycyclic<br>
pigments and azo pigments. Illustrative of the condensed<br>
polycyclic pigments are perylene pigments, perynone pigments,<br>
quinacridone pigments, dioxazine pigments, diketopyrrolo-<br>
pyrrole pigments, anthraquinone pigments, quinophthalone<br>
pigments, indigo pigments, thioindigo pigments, methine<br>
pigments, azomethine pigments, metal complex pigments, and<br>
derivatives thereof. On the other hand, illustrative of the<br>
azo pigments are insoluble azo pigments, polyazo pigments, and<br>
derivatives thereof. Among these, preferred are pigments<br>
having a royal purple, purple, reddish purple, deep red or red<br>
color tone, and particularly preferred are pigments having a<br>
color tone of a royal purple color inclining toward blue to a<br>
purple color.<br>
Incidentally, the term "derivatives thereof" means those<br>
containing, on the above-described individual pigments, one to<br>
several substituent groups such as nitro groups, primary,<br>
secondary or tertiary amines, sulfonic groups or salts thereof,<br>
phthalimidomethyl groups, carboxybenzamidomethyl groups,<br>
methyl groups having primary, secondary or tertiary amino<br>
groups, carbonylmethyl groups, sulfonamido groups,<br>
sulfonamido groups having primary, secondary or tertiary amino<br>
groups, phenylacetyl groups, and/or carboxyl groups or salts<br>
thereof. Among these, preferred are pigment derivatives<br>
having a royal purple, purple, reddish purple, deep red or red<br>
color tone, and particularly preferred are pigment derivatives<br>
having a color tone of a royal purple color inclining toward<br>
blue to a purple color.<br>
The pigment composition according to the present<br>
invention comprises the component (A) and the component (B) as<br>
essential components, and may preferably contain, as the<br>
component(C), at least one compound selected from the group<br>
consisting of (C-l) copper phthalocyanine derivatives each of<br>
which contains one or more substituents on a benzene ring<br>
thereof and (C-2) compounds each of which is available from an<br>
aromatic isocyanate compound and an aliphatic, primary or<br>
secondary amine containing at least one secondary or tertiary<br>
amino group.<br>
Illustrative of the components (C-l) are copper<br>

groups, methyl groups having primary, secondary or tertiary<br>
amino groups, carbonylmethyl groups, sulfonamido groups,<br>
sulfonamido groups having primary, secondary or tertiary amino<br>
groups, phenylacetyl groups, and/or carboxyl groups or salts<br>
thereof. These derivatives have been used for many years to<br>
improve rheological properties, such as viscosity and flow<br><br>
property when copper phthalocyanine pigment is dispersed in<br>
paint, ink or like vehicles, and also stability in liquid<br>
colorants, such as anitflooding property of the pigment and<br>
antiflocculation property of the dispersed pigment particles.<br>
These conventionally known derivatives are all usable in the<br>
present invention. Particularly preferred examples of these<br>
components (C-l) are represented by the following formula (A) :<br><br>
wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a desired substituent, and n<br>
stands for 1 to 2. The desired substituent may preferably be<br>
a halogen atom.<br>
 The components (C-2) are known as compounds which, when<br>
wet-ground with the component (A-l), converts the component<br>
(A-l) into the component (A) (JP 2-548 68 B): Such<br>
conventionally-known compounds are all usable. Illustrative<br>
of the components (C-2) are those available by reacting an<br>
aliphatic, primary or secondary amine having at least one<br><br>
secondary or tertiary amino group - such as an N-alkylamine,<br>
N,N-dialkylalkylenediamine, polyalkylenepolyamine, spermine<br>

diisocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate, 4,4"-diphenylmethane<br>
diisocyanate, tolidine diisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate,<br>
1,5-napthhalene diisocyanate and/or tetramethylxylylene<br>
diisocyanate. Preferred are those containing at least two.<br>
secondary or tertiary amino groups, and particularly preferred<br>
are those containing three or more secondary or tertiary amino<br>
groups. For example, compounds each of which is obtained by<br>
reacting one of the above-described diisocyanate compounds with<br>
an N,N-bis(aminoalkyl)amine, an N,N-bis(aminoalkyl)-<br>
alkyleneamine or the like at a molar ratio of 1:2 and then<br>

wherein R1 to R5 each independently represent a hydrogen atom<br>
or a C1-C4 alkyl group, R6 and R7 each independently represent<br>
-NH- or a C2-C6 alkylene group which may contain one or more<br>
-NR1- groups, and R8 represents an arylene group.<br>
The pigment composition according to the present<br>
invention comprises the above-described components (A) and<br>
component (B) , and the weight ratio of the component (A) to the<br>
component (B) is l00:0.1 to l00:50, preferably 100: 0.1 to 100:20.<br>
More preferably, the component (C-l) and/or the component (C-2)<br>
may be additionally contained as the component (C) such that<br>
the weight ratio of the component (A) to the component (C) is<br>
100:0.1 to 100:30, preferably 100:0.1 to 100:30, more<br>
preferably 100:0.5 to 100:20.<br>
A description will next be made of the process according<br>
to the present invention for the production of the pigment<br>
composition.<br>
(1) First production process<br>
 The component (A-1) for use in the process of the present<br>
invention can be obtained by treating crude copper<br>
phthalocyanine by a conventionally-known method such as wet<br>
grinding, for example, acid pasting or acid slurrying or dry<br>
grinding, for example, salt milling, and no particular<br>
limitation is imposed on the production process of the component<br>
(A-l).<br>
Examples of the non-aromatic solvent employed upon<br>
grinding the mixture of the component (A-l) and the component<br>
(B-l) can include glycerin, ethylene glycol, polyethylene<br>
glycol, carbitol solvents, cellosolve solvents, and Ketone<br>
solvents. The crystalline transformation from the component<br>
(A-l) into the component (A) becomes easier as the aromaticity<br>
of the solvent becomes stronger. It is, however, necessary to<br>
carefully choose a solvent because, if the aromaticity of the<br>
solvent is excessively strong, the crystalline transformation<br>
becomes hardly controllable, resulting in occurrence of the<br>
?-form. Particularly preferred is polyhydric alcohols having<br>
high viscosity, such as diethylene glycol. The non-aromatic<br>
solvent is generally used in an amount 5 to 10 times by weight<br>
as much as the total amount of the component (A-l) and the<br>
component (B-l) or the total amount additionally including the<br>
component (C) if the component (C) is also used, although the<br>
amount of the non-aromatic solvent to be used is not limited<br>
to the above-described amount.<br>
The proportions of the respective components in the<br>
above-described wet grinding are as described above in the<br>
description of the pigment composition. The transformation in<br>
crystal form from the component (A-l) into the component (A)<br>
becomes easier as the component (B) and the component (C) are<br>
used in smaller proportions relative to the component (A-l) .<br>
The above-described transformation in crystal form, however,<br>
becomes more difficult as the component (B) and the component<br>
(C) are used in greater proportions relative to the component<br>
(A-l). Here, difficult transformation in crystal form means<br>
that high temperature and/or long time is needed for. the<br>
transformation in crystal form. On the other hand, easy<br>
transformation in crystal form means that the transformation<br>
can be completed at low temperature and/or in a short time.<br>
However, easy transformation in crystal form involves a<br>
potential problem that the transformation may excessively<br>
proceeds and the crystal form may change from the ?-form to the<br>
P-form. The easiness in the crystal form transformation and<br>
the stability of the crystal form, therefore, should preferably<br>
be balanced depending on the amount of the component (B) and/or<br>
the component (C).<br>
Upon conducting the wet grinding, addition of a small<br>
amount of the component (A) as a seed in the above-described<br>
components is preferred because the time required for the<br>
transformation in crystal form can be substantially shortened.<br>
The proportion of the component (A) to be used as the seed may<br>
preferably range from 0.5 to 20 wt. % based on the total amount<br>
of the individual components.<br>
For the wet grinding, apparatuses which have been<br>
conventionally employed in the wet grinding of pigments are all<br>
usable, including, for example, ball mills, beads mills, sand<br>
mills, vertical or horizontal, continuous dispersers with<br>
tumbling medium contained therein, kneaders and attritors.<br>
Any grinding apparatus can be used, insofar as it permits<br>
temperature control and application of strong shear force.<br>
Incidentally, inclusion of the ?-form even in a smallest<br>
proportion in a grinding system causes prompt occurrence of<br>
crystalline transformation from the ?-form into the most stable<br>
?-form, thereby making it difficult to allow the ?-form to exist<br>
stably. Upon wet grinding, it is therefore especially<br>
important to avoid mixing of the (?-form irrespective of its<br>
amount.<br>
Upon wet grinding, use of a grinding aid is not essential..<br>
A grinding aid may, however, be used without problem or<br>
inconvenience if it is required to control the particle size<br>
of the pigments in the finished pigment composition. Usable<br>
examples of the grinding aid can include water-soluble<br>
inorganic salts known to date, such as sodium chloride, sodium<br>
bicarbonate and sodium sulfate. The wet grinding is generally<br>
conducted at 60 to 180oC, with 80 to 150oC being preferred.<br>
(2) Second production process<br>
Firstly, the components (A-l) and (B) and the component<br>
(C), if added, are dry-ground, and then, the resultant dry-<br>
ground mixture is wet-ground in a non-aromatic solvent. The<br>
combined use of dry grinding and wet grinding can achieve the<br>
mixing of the individual components more completely than in the<br>
first production process of the present invention in which only<br>
wet grinding is conducted, so that the time required for the<br>
transformation of the component (A-l) into the crystal form of<br>
the component (A) can be shortened.<br>
Dry grinding is generally used upon producing a mixture<br>
of the ?-form and the p-form by grinding the ?-form. In the<br>
present invention, however, the ?-form alone is used from the<br>
beginning so that a mixture of the ?-form and the ?-form is by<br>
no means formed. Accordingly, dry grinding no longer becomes<br>
a cause for the occurrence of the ?-form, and is used as an<br>
excellent method for completing the crystalline transformation<br>
from the component (A-l) into the component (A) in a shorter<br>
time.<br>
The proportions of the components (B) and (C) to be used<br>
relative to the component (A-l) in the second production process<br>
is the same as in the first production process. Firstly, these<br>
components are dry-ground. For the effective transformation<br>
in crystal form from the ?-form into the ?-form, it is preferred<br>
to grind all the components together in their entirety. As an<br>
alternative, it is also possible to conduct dry grinding by<br>
using at least portions of the entire portions of the individual<br>
components to be employed. This can be effected, for example,<br>
by using the whole portion of the component (A-l) together with<br>
portion (s) of the other component (s) or by using only portions<br>
of the individual components. The individual components may<br>
also be used in other ways. No particular limitation is imposed<br>
on the proportions of the individual components to be used based<br>
on their whole amounts when portions of the whole portions of<br>
the components are used in the dry grinding. The proportion<br>
of each component to be used may be in a range of from 0.1 to<br>
99. 9 wt.%, preferably from 30 to 70 wt.% based on its whole amount.<br>
A grinding apparatus employed for the dry grinding is the same<br>
grinding apparatus as that used for the wet grinding in the first<br>
process . The dry grinding is generally conducted at 20 to 100°C,<br>
with 30 to 70oC being preferred. For the dry grinding, a<br>
conventionally-known apparatus, for example, a ball mill, an<br>
oscillating mill or an attritor can be used. Upon dry grinding,<br>
the above-described grinding aid can also be used.<br>
 The resultant dry-ground mixture is next subjected to wet<br>
grinding. If only a portion of at least one of the components<br>
has been dry-ground, the dry-ground mixture is wet-ground<br>
together with the remaining portion of the component. As a<br>
solvent, a non-aromatic solvent similar to that employed in the<br>
first production process is used. The wet grinding can be<br>
practiced in exactly the same manner as in the first production<br>
process. As in the first production process, the ?-form may<br>
also be added as a seed as needed. This can shorten the time<br>
required for the transformation in crystal form from the ?-<br>
form into the ?-form.<br>
(3) Third production process<br>
The third production process is different from the first<br>
or second production process in that as copper phthalocyanine,<br>
copper phthalocyanine the crystal form of which is not specified,<br>
in other words, copper phthalocyanine of any crystal form (the<br>
component (A-2) is used and also in that the of-form formed as<br>
fine particles in the presence of the component (B) and/or the<br>
component (C) by acid pasting or acid slurrying in the first<br>
stage is used. Wet grinding is conducted in the second stage.<br>
This is equal to the first or second production process. As<br>
the component (A-2), crude copper phthalocyanine can usually<br>
be employed irrespective of its production process, although<br>
the component (A-2) is not limited to such crude copper<br>
phthalocyanine.<br>
The proportions of the components (B) and (C) to be used<br>
relative to the component (A-2) in the third production process<br>
are the same as the corresponding proportions in the first or<br>
second production process. Firstly, upon formation of the<br>
?-form in the first stage, the component (A-2) is added together<br>
with the component (B) and/or the component (C) into an aqueous<br>
solution of sulfuric acid, the concentration of which is 60 wt. %<br>
or higher. No particular limitation is imposed as to how the<br>
individual components are used. For example, all the<br>
components can be used in their entirety, or the component (A-2)<br>
can be used in its entirety together with the whole portion or<br>
a portion of the component (B) and a portion of the component<br>
(C). It is, however, preferred to use the whole portion or a<br>
portion of the component (B) together with the component (A-2) .<br>
When only portions of the components (B) and (C) are used, no<br>
particular limitation is imposed on the proportions of the used<br>
components (B) and (C) based on their whole amounts.<br>
Nonetheless, the proportions of the components (B) and (C) to<br>
be used may be in a range of from 0.1 to 99.9 wt.%, preferably<br>
from 30 to 70 wt.%.<br>
The aqueous solution of sulfuric acid may generally be<br>
used in an amount 5 to 30 times by weight as much as the amount<br>
of the component (A-2) to be used. No particular limitation<br>
is imposed on the temperature of the aqueous solution of<br>
sulfuric acid upon adding the individual components, although<br>
its temperature may generally be in a range of from 10 to 80°C.<br>
No particular limitation is imposed on the manner of addition<br>
of the individual components. For example, the individual<br>
components may be added after mixing them in advance, may be<br>
added at the same time, or may be added separately in a desired<br>
order. If the component (B) and/or the component (C) are not<br>
soluble in the aqueous solution of sulfuric acid, it is<br>
preferred to use them in a form divided beforehand into fine<br>
particles so that they can be dispersed in a form as fine as<br>
possible. As the component (B), it is preferred to use one<br>
soluble in sulfuric acid. Further, if there is a potential<br>
problem that these components may be modified with sulfuric acid,<br>
it is preferred to use such components by adding them at the<br>
time of the below-described wet-grinding instead of adding them<br>
to an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid.<br>
Next, the above-prepared aqueous solution of sulfuric<br>
acid is poured into a great deal of water such that the component<br>
(A-2) is transformed in crystal form into the a-form as a<br>
precipitate in water. Described specifically, the component<br>
(A-2) and the components (B) and (C) , all of which are dissolved<br>
in the aqueous solution of sulfuric acid, are allowed to<br>
precipitate as a uniform mixture in the form of fine particles.<br>
Here, the component (A-2) is transformed in crystal form into<br>
the component (A-l) . The component (A-l) is collected from the<br>
aqueous solution by a conventionally-known separation method,<br>
thoroughly washed, and then dried.<br>
In the second stage, the mixture which has been obtained<br>
in the above-described first step and contains the a-form is<br>
wet-ground in a non-aromatic solvent. When only portions of<br>
the components (B) and/or (C) are used in the first stage, the<br>
mixture is wet-ground together with the remaining portions of<br>
the components (B) and/or (C) . The wet grinding can be<br>
conducted in exactly the same manner as in the first production<br>
step, and the non-aromatic solvent can be exactly the same as<br>
that employed in the first production step. As in the first<br>
production process, it is also possible to use the ?-form as<br>
a seed and to employ a grinding aid.<br>
 From the non-aromatic solvent and the dispersing medium,<br>
if used, the pigment composition - which has been formed by<br>
wet-grinding in any one of the above-described first to third<br>
production processes and contains the ?-form and the component<br>
(B) and if necessary, the component (C) - is separated, washed<br>
with water, and then dried by conventionally-known methods . To<br>
the pigment composition according to the present invention,<br>
conventionally-known pigment treatments, surfactants and/or<br>
dipersants - such as rosin, aliphatic amines, the above-<br>
described pigment derivatives, and high molecular dispersants<br>
such as polyesters of 1, 2-hydroxystearic acid and polyesters<br>
of 1, 2-hydroxyoleic acid, their aminoalkylamides, their salts,<br>
naphthyloxyalkyl esters of the polyesters - can be added in any<br>
desired step(s) in each of the above-described production<br>
processes.<br>
The pigment composition (X) available from the process<br>
of the present invention as described above is different in<br>
thermal behavior from a pigment composition (Y) prepared by<br>
simply mixing the individual components at the same mixing ratio<br>
as the pigment composition according to the present invention<br>
(for example, mixing them by similar procedures as in dry<br>
grinding or toning). It is therefore possible to distinguish<br>
them from each other. Described specifically, when the<br>
above-described two kinds of pigment compositions (X) and (Y)<br>
are measured by using a differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA)<br>
apparatus which can also measure weight losses simultaneously<br>
during heating, these pigment compositions are different in the<br>
temperature range of a feeble exothermic peak ascribed to the<br>
component B and associated with a weight loss, thereby making<br>
it possible to clearly distinguish from each other the pigment<br>
composition (X) obtained by the process of the present invention<br>
and the pigment composition (Y) prepared by simple mixing.<br>
The pigment composition (X) according to the present<br>
invention is characterized in that it has high transmittance<br>
on the side of optically lower wavelengths (420 to 440 nra) than<br>
the conventional ?-form pigment composition (Y) and also in that<br>
it does not induce such a decrease in transmittance inherent<br>
to the conventional ?-form pigment composition (Y).<br>
Accordingly, the pigment composition (X) has a color tone of<br>
pronouncedly reddish blue and is particularly useful as a<br>
colorant for color filters which require such a color tone.<br>
Components which make up a colorant differ depending on<br>
the application. No particular limitation is, therefore,<br>
imposed on the components (for example, a binder resin, a<br>
dispersant, an organic solvent, water, a varnish, plastics,<br>
aids, etc.) other than the pigment composition of the present<br>
invention as a colorant, and those suited for the application<br>
of a colorant are used. No particular limitation is imposed<br>
on the content of the pigment composition in the colorant, and<br>
the content of the pigment composition in the colorant can be<br>
determined as needed depending on the application of the<br>
colorant.<br>
The present invention will next be described more<br>
specifically based on examples, comparative examples and<br>
application examples, in which all designations of "part" or<br>
"parts" and "%" are by a weight basis unless otherwise<br>
specifically indicated. Incidentally, it was confirmed from<br>
a Bragg angle in X-ray diffraction that the copper<br>

A deep-colored sheet and tinted sheet were prepared in<br>
a similar manner as in Example 13 except that in place of the<br>

obtained by combining the pigment composition prepared in<br>
Comparative Example 1 and dioxazine violet pigment such that<br>
the mixture contained the same components in the same<br>
proportions as the pigment composition of Example 3 - was used.<br>
The deep-colored sheets of Examples 13, 14 and 15 and<br>
Comparative Example 3 were visually observed to determine the<br>
vividness and clarity of their color tones. Concerning the<br>
tinted sheets Examples 13, 14 and 15 and Comparative Example<br>

Example 9, a mixture - which had been obtained by combining the<br>
pigment composition prepared in Comparative Example .1 and<br>
dioxazine violet pigment such that the mixture contained the<br>
same components in the same proportions as the pigment<br>
composition of Example 9 - was used.<br>
 The base colors of Example 16 and Comparative Examples<br>
4 and 5 were separately coated on glass substrates by a spin<br>
coater and then prebaked. The thus-coated glass substrates<br>
were measured for light transmission properties by "COLORCOM<br>
C" (trade name; manufactured by Dainichiseika Color &amp; Chemicals<br>
Mfg., Co., Ltd.) . The values shown in Table 8 were obtained.<br>
Further, those prebaked films were measured by a spectro-<br>
photometer. Their spectral transmittance curves are shown in<br>
FIG. 1.<br>
To evaluate the heat resistance of the coated glass<br>
substrates, the coated glass substrates were left over for 1<br>
hour in an atmosphere heated at 250oC and then, were<br>
colorimetrically measured. As indexes of heat resistance,<br>
color differences (?Eab* (heat resistance)) before and after<br>
the heat resistance test were determined. To evaluate the light<br>
fastness of coated glass substrates, the base colors of Example<br>
16 and Comparative Examples 4 and 5 were coated on glass<br>
substrates by a spin coater, respectively. Subsequent to<br>
prebaking, the coated glass substrates were colorimetrically<br>
measured. The individual coated glass substrates were left<br>
over for 12 hours in an atmosphere under a 90 mW metal halide<br>
lamp and were then colorimetrically measured. As indexes of<br>
light fastness, color differences (?Eab* (light fastness))<br>
after the exposure to light from the metal halide lamp were<br>
determined. The results of the above measurements are shown<br>
in Table 9.<br>
The blue base color obtained in Example 16 was confirmed<br>
to have clear superiority in heat resistance and light fastness<br>
to the blue base colors of Comparative Examples 4 and 5.<br>
Example 17<br>
To obtain a blue (B) color filter film, a photosensitive<br>

pigment red 177) was used as a pigment instead of using the<br>
pigment composition prepared in Example 9.<br>
Example 19<br>
To obtain a green (G) color filter film, a photosensitive<br>
pigment dispersion of G was obtained in accordance with the<br>
formula of Table 10 by using a green base color prepared in a<br>
similar manner as in Example 16 except a green pigment (C.I.<br>
pigment green 36) was used as a pigment instead of using the<br>
pigment composition prepared in Example 9.<br>
Example 20<br>
To obtain an RGB color filter for use in an LCD color<br>
display, a glass substrate which had been treated with a silane<br>
coupling agent was set on a spin coater, and was spin-coated<br>
with the above-described photosensitive pigment dispersion for<br>
R color filters firstly at 300 rpm for 5 second and then at 1, 200<br>
rpm for 5 seconds. The thus-coated glass substrate was prebaked<br>
at 80°C for 10 minutes. After a photomask having a mosaic<br>
pattern was brought into close contact with the coated glass<br>
substrate, the coated glass substrate was exposed at a light<br>
quantity of 100 mJ/cm2 by using an extra-high pressure mercury<br>
vapor lamp. Development and rinsing were then conducted with<br>
a specifically-formulated developer and a specifically-<br>
formulated rinse, respectively, whereby a red mosaic pattern<br>
was formed on the glass substrate.<br>
Subsequently, a green mosaic pattern and a blue mosaic<br>
pattern were formed, respectively, by conducting coating and<br>
baking with the above-described photosensitive pigment<br>
dispersions for G color filters and B color filters as described<br>
above, whereby an RGB color filter was obtained. The thus-<br>
obtained color filter had excellent spectral transmittance<br>
curve characteristics, was excellent in durability such as.<br>
light fastness and heat resistance, had excellent light<br>
transmission property, and was equipped with properties<br>
excellent as an LC color filter which features a vivid<br>
reddish-blue color tone and high transmission property in<br>
particular.<br>
