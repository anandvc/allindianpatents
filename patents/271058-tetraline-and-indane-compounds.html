Method for Producing Hot Strips Consisting of Lightweight Steel<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing hot strips from a deformable lightweight steel which is especially suitable for cold deep drawing and includes as main elements Fe, Mn, Si and Al and which has a high tensile strength and TRIP and/or TWIP properties, according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
The method, set forth in the preamble, for producing hot strips from a deformable lightweight steel which is especially suitable for cold deep drawing is known (steel research 74 (2003), No. 11/12, pp 724-731).<br>
The production of such steels of high manganese content has been marred by problems to ensure a fine-grained and isometric microstructure.<br>
DE 197 58 108 C1 discloses a production method and production installation for continuous production of hot-rolled thin flat products. Melt from steel that has not been designated in greater detail is cast in a horizontal continuous strip installation close to its final dimension in a range between 5-18 mm and cooled in a controlled manner under a protective gas atmosphere before reaching the single-stand roughing train.<br>
The pre-rolled hot strip is selectively cooled, heated or maintained at a temperature in a controlled fashion in a device downstream of the roughing train, and the edges of the hot strip are re-heated.<br>
The single-stand roughing train is followed by a multi-stand finishing train, a delivery roller table with a device for cooling the hot strip as well as upstream and downstream coiling machines for coiling up the hot strip. Downstream of the roughing train, the rolling temperature upstream of the multi-stand finishing train can be selectively adjusted in the austenitic or ferritic<br><br>
range or tailored in the transition from austenite to ferrite by the device for controllable cooling, heating or maintaining the temperature of the hot strip.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a method for producing hot strips from a deformable lightweight steel which is especially suitable for cold deep drawing and which allows a reliable realization of a fine-grained, preferably isometric microstructure.<br>
Staring from the preamble, this object is attained in combination with the characterizing features of claim 1. Advantageous improvements are the subject matter of sub-claims.<br>
According to the teaching of the invention, the pre-strip produced by continuous strip casting passes through a device under protective gas for homogenizing in concert with a selective temperature maintenance, cooling or heating. Subsequently, the pre-strip is subjected to a hot-rolling process having at least one pass and a total deformation degree of at least 50 %. After the last pass, the hot strip is cooled down and reeled. The hot rolling process is implemented in-line or de-coupled, depending on the ratio of casting speed in relation to rolling speed. Preferably, the total deformation degree amounts to more than 70 %.<br>
The passage of the homogenization zone is intended to effect a temperature balance across the surface and a stress relief, regardless whether the temperature level is maintained, or is lowered or raised by cooling and heating, respectively.<br>
The ratio of casting speed to rolling speed is crucial for the choice of in-line or separate hot-rolling process. When both speeds are about the same, in-line rolling is possible. However, when the casting speed is significantly smaller or greater than the rolling speed., the casting and hot rolling process must be decoupled from one another.<br><br>
The speed is normally determined by the rolling speed in the first stand and must be sufficiently high to be able to establish the deformation in a particular temperature window. When the rolling speed is too low, the deformation temperature decreases and the required rolling forces rise excessively. Although it could be attempted to conform the possible casting speed to the respective rolling speed in the first stand by changing the length of the continuous strip casting machine, this, however, would preclude any possibility of variation.<br>
In other words, when limited to one steel grade only, the installation could be configured to satisfy the condition casting speed = rolling speed in the first stand, but more likely is the use of such a installation for a wider spectrum of varying steel grade so that a decoupled installation design would take precedent.<br>
Apart from the issue of the speed condition, recrystallization behavior is also of relevance. Both limit cases involve a complete recrystallization during deformation (dynamic) as opposed to a recrystallization after deformation (static). The actual conditions involve a hybrid form, whereby at one time or another dynamic or the static behavior is dominant depending on the conditions.<br>
The proposed decoupling has the advantage that the casting speed can be selected in dependence on the alloy composition of the steel with respect to optimum solidification conditions, regardless of the cycle of the subsequent hot rolling process. In contrast thereto, the afore-mentioned in-line hot rolling has, however, the advantage of increased productivity, whereby the final thickness may be realized by the rolling operation either throughout or partway.<br>
In in-line hot rolling, the microstructure has not sufficiently recrystallized so that the final adjustment of the material properties is preferably realized by a subsequent annealing process and/or combined annealing and cold-rolling processes.<br><br>
When a decoupled operation is involved, the pre-strip is directly reeled in the simplest case after complete solidification and passage through the homogenization zone. This assumes that the casting structure of the pre-strip is so configured as to enable reeling and unreeling. Normally, the pres-strip is subjected to a first pass which is sufficient to effect at least a partial crystallization of the outer regions of the strip in order to be able to easily reel the strip.<br>
The actual hot-rolling process is implemented in Steckel operation at defined temperature, with the finished hot strip being cooled and reeled after reaching the predefined deformation degree.<br>
Depending on the installation layout, it may be required to adjust the coil before uncoiling to a predefined temperature. As an alternative, the hot-rolling process may take place in a finishing line with at least three reductions in strip thickness.<br>
Also in this procedure, it is considered advantageous to subject the pre-strip to a first pass. Depending on the alloy composition and desired microstructure configuration, it may be necessary to provide intermediate heating between the first pass and the finishing line.<br>
All thus-produced hot strips can be deep-drawn cold, and targeted cold forming processes (e.g. rolling, stretching, deep drawing) with optional interposed annealing processes make it possible to adjust a wide spectrum of different properties with respect to strength, ductility, and structural isometry.<br>
The decision as to whether only recrystallization annealing, or only cold forming, or a combination of both, is necessary to be carried out after the last hot forming process depends always on the extent of the attained recrystallization after hot forming and on the wanted technological properties including the structural isometry.<br><br>
The method according to the invention is preferably suitable for the production of hot strips from a lightweight steel with following contents C = 0.04-1.0 %, Mn = 9-30 %, Si = 0.0-6.0 %, Al = 0.05 
Beneficial values are realized at a Si content from 2.0-4.0 % and an Al content of 2.0-3.0 %. The Mn content may be adjusted to an upper range (22-30 %) and a lower range (9-18 %), depending on whether TRIP or TWIP properties should prevail. The average Mn range (18-22 %) is preferred for a balanced ratio between TRIP and TWIP properties.<br>
Further features, advantages and details of the invention are apparent upon from the following description of several exemplified embodiments depicted in a drawing, in which:<br>
Fig. 1	shows schematically the process sequence according to the<br>
invention for the condition casting speed = rolling speed,<br>
Fig. 2	shows schematically the process sequence according to the<br>
invention for the condition casting speed * rolling speed, with the variation Steckel operation,<br>
Fig. 3	like Fig. 2 but with variation finishing line.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates schematically a process sequence according to the invention for the condition casting speed substantially equal to rolling speed. Upstream of the hot-rolling process is the casting process with a horizontal continuous strip casting installation 1, comprised of a revolving conveyor belt 2 and two deflection pulleys 3, 3'. A lateral seal 4 can be further seen to prevent the supplied melt 5 from flowing off to the right and left of the conveyor belt 2. The melt 5 is transported by means of a ladle 6 onto the horizontal continuous strip casting installation 1 and flows through a bottom opening 7 into a tundish 8. This tundish 8 is constructed as an overflow tank.<br><br>
Not shown are the equipments for intense cooling of the underside of the upper strand of the conveyor belt 2 and the complete envelope of the continuous strip casting installation 1 with respective protective gas atmosphere.<br>
After depositing the melt 5 onto the revolving conveyor belt 2, the intense cooling causes solidification and formation of a pre-strip 9 which is substantially solidified at the end of the conveyor belt 2.<br>
Following the continuous strip casting installation 1 is a homogenization zone 10 for temperature compensation and stress relief. The homogenization zone includes a heat-insulated housing 11 and a roller table not shown in detail here. This device may be selectively used to maintain the temperature of the pre-strip 9 or to further cool down or, as an alternative, to slightly heat up the pre-strip 9.<br>
The subsequent first stand 12 is constructed either as a pure driver unit with a slight initial pass or as rolling unit with a predefined initial pass.<br>
Depending on the alloy composition and desired microstructure formation, the pre-strip feeds directly into the finishing line, or an intermediate heating is required. Advantageously, this is realized by inductive heating, e.g. in the form of a coil 13. The actual hot forming is implemented in the following finishing line 14, with the first three stands 15, 15', 15" effecting the actual reduction in strip thickness whereas the last stand 16 is constructed as smoothing rolls.<br>
Following the last pass is a cooling zone 17 in which the finished hot strip is cooled down to the reeling temperature.<br>
Shear 20 is arranged between the end of the cooling zone 17 and reel 19, 19'. The shear 20 has the task to separate the hot strip 18 transversely as soon as one of the two reels 19, 19' has been fully wound. The leader of the following hot strip 18 is then routed to the second free reel 19, 19'. This ensures that the pull on the strip is maintained over the entire strip length. This is especially of importance when producing thin hot strips.<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows the process sequence for the condition that casting speed * rolling speed. This means that the casting speed is significantly greater or smaller than the rolling speed.<br>
As melt 5 is deposited upon the continuous strip casting installation 1 and the solidification to form a pre-strip 9 is realized in a same manner as the process depicted in Fig. 1, a repetition thereof is omitted.<br>
As already explained with reference to Fig. 1, the first stand 12 following the homogenization zone 10 may be configured only as driver unit or as rolling stand with predefined reduction in strip thickness. To reduce the function simply to a driving of the pre-strip 9 is only possible when the casting structure permits a reeling of the pre-strip 9. Normally, a certain initial pass is always necessary.<br>
In order to be able to remove the wound coil 21 from reel 19, a shear 20 is arranged downstream of the first stand 12 for transverse separation of the pre-strip 9. Depending on the cycle sequence, there may be a need for provision of a second reel (not shown here)<br>
The actual hot forming is carried out decoupled from the casting process in a separate installation.<br>
In this exemplified embodiment, a reversing stand 22, also called "Steckel mill", is used which rolls alternatingly from left to right and from right to left and again reels. Not shown here is the option to set the temperature during rolling in so-called heat retaining boxes. Also not shown is the option to provide a furnace between casting installation and reversing stand 22 to adjust the wound coil 21 to a defined temperature before being unreeled.<br>
After the last hot forming pass, the right delivery side of the reversing stand 22 is reversed so that the finished hot strip 18 passes through a cooling zone 17 and the hot strip 18 is again reeled to a finished coil 23.<br><br>
As opposed to Fig. 2, Fig. 3 illustrates the execution of the actual hot forming in a finishing line 24. The reeled coil 21 is hereby transported to the finishing line 23 and the strip leader is threaded into the first stand 15 of the finishing line 24.<br>
In this exemplified embodiment, the finishing line 24 includes three rolling stands 15, 15', 15" and a smoothing rolls stand 16. After leaving the smoothing rolls stand 16, the finished hot strip 18 passes through a cooling zone and is reeled to a finished coil 23 at predefined reeling temperature.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
