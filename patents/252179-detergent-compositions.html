				<td>Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions, particularly laundry detergent compositions and in particular to detergents comprising lipolytic or lipase enzymes.<br>
Background of the Invention and Prior Art<br>
Lipase enzymes have been used in detergents since the late 1980s for removal of fatty soils. It is known that lipase enzymes impact perfumes of detergent compositions . containing them. The selection of perfumes for use in detergent compositions comprising lipase enzymes is documented in EP-A-430315, where it is described that in order to combat malodours resulting from the use of lipase enzymes, perfumes should be used that comprise at least 25% by weight of defined perfume materials and less than 50% by weight of esters derived from fatty acids with 1-7 carbon atoms.<br>
Until relatively recently, the main commercially available lipase enzymes worked particularly effectively at the lower moisture levels of the drying phase of the wash process. However, more recently, higher efficiency lipases have been developed that also work effectively during the wash phase of the cleaning process. Examples of such enzymes are as described in WO00/60063 and Research Disclsoure IP6553D. This makes it even more difficult for the detergent formulator to produce consumer acceptable perfumes in a climate where consumers' expectation is increasingly for pleasant perfumes at all stages of the washing process. One particular area where the impact of lipase on the perfume in the detergent composition can be most noticeable to consumers is after storage and as a result, during the washing process. This can be a particular problem for detergents for use in hand-washing processes. The present inventors have found that the problems described above can be alleviated even for detergent, formulations comprising the new high efficiency lipase enzymes. Furthermore, the present inventors have found specific preferred perfumes for use in such detergent formulations. <br>
Definition of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a detergent composition comprising:<br>
1.         a lipase which is a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence which: (a) has at least 90% identity with the wild-type lipase derived from Humicola lanuginosa strain DSM 4109; (b) compared to said wild-type lipase, comprises a substitution of an electrically neutral or negatively charged amino acid at the surface of the three-dimensional structure within 15 Angstroms of El or Q249 with a positively charged amino acid; and (c) comprises a peptide addition at the C-terrninal; and/or (d) comprises a peptide addition at the N-terminal and/or (e) meets the following limitations: i) comprises a negative amino acid in position E210 of said wild-type lipase; ii) comprises a negatively charged amino acid in the region corresponding to positions 90-101 of said wild-type lipase; and iii) comprises a neutral or negative amino acid at a position corresponding to N94 of said wild-type lipase and/or has a negative or neutral net electric charge in the region corresponding to positions 90-101 of said wild-type lipase; and<br>
2. an encapsulated perfume particle comprising (a) an at least partially water-soluble solid matrix comprising one or more water-soluble hydroxylic compounds, preferably starch; and (b) a perfume oil encapsulated by the solid matrix.<br>
The lipase enzyme may be a polypeptide as defined above, meeting criteria (a) and (b) and (c) and/or (e).<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the encapsulated perfume oil comprises at least 1 % by weight or at least 5wt% or even at least 10% by weight, or even at least 20%, 30,40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90 % by weight of at least one perfume ingredient having a boiling point at 36KNm-2 (760mmHg) of 260°C or lower and a calculated logic of its octanol/water coefficient P (ClogP), of at least 3.0. In a further embodiment, the encapsulated perfume oil comprises at least one ester derived from fatty acids with 1-7 carbon atoms, generally at least 1 % by weight or at least 5wt% or even at least 10% by weight, or even at least 20%, 30,40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90 wt% ester by weight based on the weight of the total perfume oil in the encapsulated perfume particle. The inventors have found that two particular perfume esters are especially sensitive to the presence of<br><br>
lipase enzymes so that the invention is particularly beneficial where the encapsulated perfume oil comprises benzyl acetate and/or phenylethyl acetate. In a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a detergent composition comprising a perfume composition, said perfume composition comprising the perfume oil in the encapsulated perfume particle and any optional additional pefume oil, said perfume composition comprising at least 10% by weight, or at least 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or even 90 wt% of one or more perfume components having a molecular weight of greater than 0 but less than or equal to 350 daltons, at least 80% of said one or more perfume components having a cLogP of at least 2.4, said perfume composition comprising at least 5% of said one or more perfume components having a cLogP of at least 2.4.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
All percentages and ratios herein are calculated by weight unless otherwise indicated. Percentages and ratios are calculated based on the total composition unless otherwise indicated. The nomenclature used herein describing the enzymes, for example relating to amino acid modifications, amino acid groupings and amino acid identity is as in WOOO/60063.<br>
The lipase enzymes suitable for use in the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of enzymes capable of hydrolyzing ester bonds, classified by EC number 3.1, preferably enzymes that hydrolyze carboxylic ester bonds, classified by EC number 3.1.1 Within this class, particularly preferred are lipases classified by EC number 3.1.1.3 and most preferred are those with first wash performance such as are described in WOOO/60063, WO99/42566, W002/062973, WO97/04078, WO97/04079 and US5869438.<br>
The preferred lipase enzymes are described in WOOO/60063. The preferred lipases suitable for use in the present invention as described in WOOO/60063 are described with reference to a lipase that is the wild-type lipase derived from Humicola Lanuginosa strain DSM 4109 (reference lipase). The reference lipase is also referred to as Lipolase (registered trade name of Novozymes). It is described in EP258068 and EP305216 and has the amino acid sequence shown in positions 1-269 of SEQ ID No 2 of US5869438.<br><br>
The most preferred first wash lipase for use in the present invention is available under the tradename LIPEX (registered tradename of Novozymes), a variant of the Humicola lanuginosa (Thermomyces lanuginosus) lipase (Lipolase registered tradename of Novozymes) with the mutations T231R and N233R.<br>
The lipase enzyme incorporated into the detergent compositions of the present invention is generally present in an amount of 10 to 20000 LU/g of the detergent composition, or even 100 to 10000 LU/g. The LU unit for lipase activity is defined in WO99/42566. The lipase dosage in the wash solution is typically from 0.02 to 2 mg/1 enzyme, more typically from 0.1 to 2mg/l as enzyme protein.<br>
The lipase enzyme may be incorporated into the detergent composition in any convenient form, generally in the form of a non-dusting granulate, a stabilised liquid or a coated enzyme particle. Alternatively a slurry may be suitable.<br>
The at least partially water soluble hydroxylic compounds useful herein are preferably selected from carbohydrates, which can be any or mixture of: i) simple sugars (or mono-saccharides); ii) oligosaccharides (defined as carbohydrate chains consisting of 2-10 monosaccharide molecules); iii) polysaccharides (defined as carbohydrate chains consisting of at least 11, or more usually at least 35 monosaccharide molecules); and iv) starches.<br>
Both linear and branched carbohydrate chains may be used. In addition chemically modified starches and poly-/oligo-saccharides may be used. Typical modifications include the addition of hydrophobic moieties of the form of alkyl, aryl, etc. identical to those found in surfactants to impart some surface activity to these compounds.<br>
Other examples of suitable encapsulating materials include all natural or synthetic gums such as alginate esters, carrageenin, agar-agar, pectic acid, and natural gums such as gum arabic, gum tragacanth and gum karaya, chitin and chitosan, cellulose and cellulose derivatives including i) cellulose acetate and cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP); ii) hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC); iii)carboxymethylcellulose (CMC); iv) all enteric/aquateric coatings and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Particularly preferred encapsulating matrix materials comprise starches. Suitable examples can be made from, raw starch, pregelatinized starch, modified starch derived from tubers, legumes, cereal and grains, for example corn starch, wheat starch, rice starch, waxy corn starch, oat starch, cassava starch, waxy barley, waxy rice starch, sweet rice starch, amioca, potato starch, tapioca starch, oat starch, cassava starch, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Modified starches suitable for use as the encapsulating matrix in the present invention include, hydrolyzed starch, acid thinned starch, starch esters of long chain hydrocarbons, starch acetates, starch octenyl succinate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The term "hydrolyzed starch" refers to oligosaccharide-type materials that are typically obtained by acid and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of starches, preferably corn starch. Suitable hydrolyzed starches for inclusion in the present invention include maltodextrins and corn syrup solids. The hydrolyzed starches for inclusion with the mixture of starch esters have a Dextrose Equivalent (DE) values of from about 10 to about 36 DE. The DE value is a measure of the reducing equivalence of the hydrolyzed starch referenced to dextrose and expressed as a percent (on a dry basis). The higher the DE value, the more reducing sugars present. A method for determining DE values can be found in Standard Analytical Methods of the Member Companies of Corn Industries Research Foundation, 6th ed. Corn Refineries Association, Inc. Washington, DC 1980, D-52.<br>
Starch esters having a degree of substitution in the range of from about 0.01% to about 10.0% may be used to encapsulate the perfume oils of the present invention. The hydrocarbon part of the modifying ester should be from a C5 to C16 carbon chain. Preferably, octenylsuccinate (OSAN) substituted waxy corn starches of various types such as 1) waxy starch: acid thinned and OSAN substituted, 2) blend of corn syrup solids: waxy starch, OSAN substituted, and dextrinized, 3) waxy starch: OSAN substituted and dextrinized, 4) blend of corn syrup solids or maltodextrins with waxy starch: acid thinned OSAN substituted, and then cooked and spray dried, 5) waxy starch: acid thinned and OSAN substituted then cooked and spray dried, and 6) the high and low viscosities of the above modifications (based on the level of acid treatment) can also be used in the present invention.<br><br>
Modified starches having emulsifying and emulsion stabilizing capacity such as starch octenyl succinates have the ability to entrap the perfume oil droplets in the emulsion due to the hydrophobic character of the starch modifying agent.   The perfume oils remain trapped in the modified starch until dissolved in the wash solution, due to thermodynamic factors i.e., hydrophobic interactions and stabilization of the emulsion because of steric hindrance. The perfume may be adsorbed or adsorbed onto a carrier prior to encapsulation. Suitable examples of carriers are as described in WO 97/11151 or may be polymeric materials. Zeolite is a particularly preferred carrier, for example as described in more detail in WO97/11151.<br>
Other known methods of manufacturing the starch encapsulates of the present invention, include but are not limited to, fluid bed agglomeration, extrusion, cooling/crystallization methods and the use of phase transfer catalysts to promote interfacial polymerization.<br>
Other suitable matrix materials and process details are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,971,852, Brenner et al., issued July 27, 1976.<br>
Perfume Oils<br>
As used herein, the expression "perfume oil" is intended to refer to perfume raw materials or ingredients, or combinations thereof. Whilst these are generally immiscible with water under standard conditions of temperature and pressure, a small number may be miscible with water. The perfume oil may comprise one perfume ingredient or mixtures of more than one perfume ingredient. In addition to the perfume oil present in the detergent compositions of the invention via the encapsulated perfume particle, additional perfume oils may be present in the detergent via other delivery systems as discussed below. The overall sum of perfume ingredients present in the encapsulated perfume oil and any optional additional perfume oils provides the perfume composition of the detergent composition.<br>
The inventors have found that often lipase enzymes and particularly the high efficiency lipase enzymes essential for the present invention, are problematic for perfume stability on storage and this means that the perfume fragrance detected by the consumer is not only reduced compared with the amount of perfume added into the detergent<br><br>
formulation but may also be adversely affected so that it is not the perfume selected by the perfumer. This problem is particularly noticeable by the consumer during the washing process and the inventors have found that not only do the encapsulated perfumes have a degree of protection on storage, but also surprisingly, the encapsulated perfumes appear to be chaperoned to the surface of the wash water by the encapsulate, providing maximum efficacy for the perfume raw materials used. The use of the encapsulated perfumes in combination with the specified lipases also provides a degree of protection from these particularly lipase-sensitive perfume raw materials.<br>
Preferably the perfume oil present in the encapsulated perfume particle comprises one or more perfume ingredient characterized by its boiling point (B.P.) and its octanol/water partition coefficient (P). The octanol/water partition coefficient of a perfume ingredient is the ratio between its equilibrium concentrations in octanol and in water. The preferred perfume ingredients of this invention have a B.P., determined at the normal, standard pressure of about 760 mm Hg, of about 260°C or lower, preferably less than about 255°C; and more preferably less than about 250°C, and an octanol/water partition coefficent P of about 1,000 or higher. Since the partition coefficients of the preferred perfume ingredients of this invention have high values, they are more conveniently given in the form of their logarithm to the base 10, logP. Thus the preferred perfume ingredients of this invention have logP of at least 3, preferably more than 3.1, and even more preferably more than 3.2.<br>
The boiling points of many perfume ingredients are given in, e.g., "Perfume and Flavor Chemicals (Aroma Chemicals)," Steffen Arctander, published by the author, 1969, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The logP of many perfume ingredients has been reported; for example, the Pomona92 database, available from Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc. (Daylight CIS), Irvine, California, contains many, along with citations to the original literature. However, the logP values are most conveniently calculated by the "CLOGP" program, also available from Daylight CIS. This program also lists experimental logP values when they are available in the Pomona92 database. The "calculated logP" (ClogP) is determined by the fragment approach of Hansch and Leo ( cf., A. Leo, in Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 4, C. Hansch, P. G. Sammens, J. B. Taylor<br><br>
and C. A. Ramsden, Eds., p. 295, Pergamon Press, 1990, incorporated herein by reference). The fragment approach is based on the chemical structure of each perfume ingredient, and takes into account the numbers and types of atoms, the atom connectivity, and chemical bonding. The ClogP values, which are the most reliable and widely used estimates for this physicochemical property, are preferably used instead of the experimental logP values in the selection of perfume ingredients which are useful in the present invention.<br>
Thus, when a perfume composition which is composed of ingredients having a B.P. of about 260°C or lower and a ClogP, or an experimental logP, of about 3 or higher, is used in an detergent composition, the perfume is very effusive and very noticeable when the product is used. Table 1 gives some' non-limiting examples of the preferred perfume ingredients, useful in the detergent compositions of the present invention. Particularly preferred perfume oils for encapsulation, include one or a mixture of more than one ingredient selected from octyl aldehyde, nonyl aldehyde, decyl aldehyde, dodecyl aldehyde (dodecanal or lauric aldehye), diphenyl oxide, alpha-Ionine, Lilial and alpha-iso "gamma" methyl lonone. These have been found to be particularly useful for masking malodours produced from fatty acid odours. These particularly preferred perfume oils may be encapsulated singly or as part of a mixture with other preferred (i.e. listed in Table 1 below) or particularly preferred perfume oils or as part of a mixture with other perfume oils.<br><br>
Table 1 Examples of Preferred Perfume Ingredients<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The perfume oil in the encapsulated perfume particle may be adsorbed or absorbed onto a carrier prior to encapsulation. Suitable carriers are described in WO97/11151. A particularly preferred carrier is zeolite.<br>
The detergent compositions herein comprise from about 0.01% to 50% of the encapsulated perfume particle. More preferably, the detergent compositions herein comprise from 0.05% to 8.0% of the perfume particle, even more preferably from 0.5% to 3.0%. Most preferably, the detergent compositions herein contain from 0.05% to 1.0% of the encapsulated perfume particle. The encapsulated perfume particles preferably have size of from 1 micron to 1000 microns, more preferably from 50 microns to 500 microns.<br>
The perfume oil and/or perfume composition is generally present in the detergent compositions of the invention in amounts of from 0.001% to about 5%, preferably from 0.01% to 5%, and more usually from 0.05% to 3%. Where present in the detergent compositions of the present invention, the preferred perfume ingredients may comprise 100% of the perfume oil, but is more usually used in addition to other perfume ingredients. A mixture of more than one of the preferred perfume ingredients may be present for example, at least 2 or even at least 5 or 6 or 7 different preferred perfume ingredients. Furthermore, the encapsulated perfume particles may contain at least 1 Or 5 or 10 wt% or even at least 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90 wt% of such preferred perfume ingredients.<br>
Most common perfume ingredients which are derived from natural or synthetic sources are composed of a multitude of components. For example, orange terpenes contain about 90% to about 95% d-limonene, but also contain many other minor ingredients. When each such material is used in the formulation of the perfume oils in the present invention, it is counted as one ingredient, for the purpose of defining the invention.<br>
The detergent compositions may comprise in addition to the encapsulated perfume oil, additional perfume oil forming part of the total perfume composition in the detergent composition. The additional perfume oil may be incorporated into the detergent composition by any other delivery method, for example, simply by spraying onto the finished detergent composition or onto a component thereof, prior to mixing to form the finished detergent composition.<br>
The encapsulated perfume particles also may comprise perfume oil comprising esters derived from fatty acids having 1 to 7 carbon atoms. Where the detergent composition additionally comprises additional perfume oil, preferably at least 60 wt%, or at least 80 or 90 or substantially all the ester derived from fatty acid having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms will be present in the encapsulated perfume particles.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, the encapsulated perfume oil and/or the perfume composition in the detergent composition comprises at least 10 % , 20%, 30%, 40% , 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or even 90% of one or more perfume ingredients having a molecular weight of greater than 0 but less than or equal to 350 daltons, from about 100 daltons to about 350 daltons, from about 130 daltons to about 270 daltons, or even from about 140 daltons to about 230 daltons; at least 80%, 85%, 90% or even 95% of said one or more perfume ingredients having a cLogP of at least 2.4, from about 2.75 to about 8.0 or even from about 2.9 to about 6.0, said perfume composition comprising at least 5%, 15%, 25%, 35%, 45%, 55%, 65%, 75%, 85%, or even 95% of said one or more perfume ingredients having a cLogP in the range of at least 2.4, from about 2.75 to about 8.0 or even from about 2.9 to about 6.0. In said aspect of the invention said one or more perfume ingredients may be selected from the group consisting of a Schiffs base, ether, phenol, ketone, alcohol, ester, lactone, aldehyde, nitrile, natural oil or mixtures thereof. Schiffs base and nitriles may be least preferred. In certain aspects of the invention as recited above, said one or more perfume ingredients may include Table 2 Perfume Ingredients or mixtures thereof or even Table 2 Perfume Ingredients 1 through 28 or mixtures thereof. It may be preferred for ketones and aldehydes to have a molecular weight of below 200 daltons.<br>
In another aspect of the invention said perfume composition comprises at least 10 % , 20%, 30%, 40% , 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or even 90% of a perfume ingredient selected from the group consisting of the ingredients listed in Table 2 below and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Table 2<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
In any of the aforementioned aspects, if the perfume oil or composition comprises an ester perfume ingredient, when said perfume oil or composition comprises an ester perfume component said ester perfume may have one or more of the following characteristics: branching or pendant rings in at least one of the alpha, beta or gamma positions; branching or puidant rings in at least one of the alpha or beta positions; or at least one tertiary carbon atom in the alpha position. While not being bound by theory, it is believed that the aforementioned perfume ester characteristics result in increased perfume ester stability, and thus perfume composition stability, when said perfume ester in is the presence of an enzyme that can hydrolyze ester bonds, for example, enzymes classed in EC 3.1.1, such as lipases.<br>
In any of the aforementioned aspects of the invention, said perfume oil or composition typically contains no more than about 5 %, or even none of the perfume components selected from the group consisting of Acetic acid, phenylmethyl ester; Benzene ethanol; Butanoic acid, 2-methyl-, ethyl ester; 4H-Pyran-4-one, 2-ethyl-3-hydroxy-; Benzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-; Benzaldehyde, 3-ethoxy-4-hydroxy-; 3-Hexen-1-ol, acetate, (Z)-; Butanoic acid, 2-methyl-, 1-; methylethyl ester; 3-Decanone, 1-hydroxy-; 2-Heptanone; Benzaldehyde; Propanenitrile, 3-(3-hexenyloxy)-, (Z)-; 2-Butanone, 4-phenyl-; 2-Hexen-l-ol; 2(3H)-Furanone, 5-butyldihydro-. Processes of Making Perfume Compositions<br>
Perfume compositions of the present invention may be made by ad-mixing of perfume raw materials, which are typically liquids. Certain perfume raw materials are solid materials and can require gentle heat to homogenise with the rest of the perfume. The perfume blend can also comprise a significant proportion of a diluent (e.g dipropylene glycol), an antioxidant or a solubilising material. Solubilisers can be particularly advantageous where the surfactant level is low in order to disperse the perfume in a predominantly hydrophilic matrix such as aqueous liquid cleaners.<br>
Perfume Delivery Methods<br>
Any of the aforementioned aspects of the perfume compositions may be combined with other materials to produce any of the following delivery systems for delivering additional perfume oils into the detergent composition: spray-on perfume oils, sprayed directly onto detergent composition or components thereof, starch encapsulate delivery systems, porous carrier material delivery systems, coated porous carrier material delivery systems, microencapsulate delivery systems. Preferably, detergent comopositions of the invention will comprise encapsulates and spray-on perfume. Suitable methods of producing the aforementioned delivery systems may be found in one or more of the following U.S. patents 6,458,754; 5,656,584; 6,172,037; 5,955,419 and 5,691,383 and WIPO publications WO 94/28017, WO 98/41607, WO 98/52527. Such delivery systems may be used alone, in combination with other or even in combination with the neat sprayed on or admixed perfume compositions of the present invention in a consumer product.<br>
In addition to the lipase enzyme and encapsulated perfume particles, the detergent compositions of the invention will also contain one or more conventional detergent ingredients and/or detergent adjunct ingredients.<br>
Optional Detersive Adjuncts<br>
The detergent compositions of the invention may be in any convenient form such as powdered or granular solids, bars, tablets or non-aqueous liquids, including gel and paste forms.

Manufacture of Modified Starch Encapsulated Perfume Particles Example 3<br>
1.	225 g of CAPSUL modified starch (National Starch &amp; Chemical) is added to 450 g of<br>
" water at 24°C.<br>
2.	The mixture is agitated at 600 RPM (turbine impeller 2 inches in diameter) for 20<br>
minutes.<br>
3.	75 g perfume oil is added near the vortex of the starch solution.<br>
4.	The emulsion formed is agitated for an additional 20 minutes (at 600 RPM).<br>
5.	Upon achieving a perfume droplet size of less than 15 microns, the emulsion is<br>
pumped to a spray drying tower and atomized through a spinning disk with co-current<br>
airflow for drying.    The inlet air temperature is set at 205-210°C, the exit air<br>
temperature is stabilized at 98-103°C.<br>
6.	Dried particles of the starch encapsulated perfume oil are collected at the dryer outlet.<br>
Analysis of the finished perfume particle (all % based on weight):<br>
Total Perfume Oil	24.56%<br>
Encapsulated Oil/ Free or Surface Oil	24.46%/0.10%<br>
Starch	72.57%<br>
Moisture	2.87%Particle Size Distribution<br>
50-500 micrometers<br>
&gt; 500 micrometers Example 4<br>
In a suitable container 500g of HiCap 100 modified starch (supplied by National Starch &amp; Chemical) are dissolved into lOOOg of deionised water. Once a homogenous solution is achieved, 40g of anhydrous citric acid is added to the starch solution. The mixture is agitated for 10 minutes to dissolve the citric acid. At this point, 600g of perfume is added to the mixture. The emulsion is then agitated with a high shear mixer (ARD-Barico) for 10 more minutes.<br>
The mixture is then spray dried in a Production Minor cocurrent spray dryer manufactured by Niro A/S. A rotary atomising disc type FS 1, also from Niro A/S, is used. The air inlet temperature is 200°C and the outlet temperature 90°C. Disc speed is set at 28,500 rpm.
