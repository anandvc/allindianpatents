BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a system for broadcasting data signals in a secure manner, comprising means for encrypting the data signals using a first key, means for broadcasting the encrypted data signals to subscribers, means for decrypting the encrypted data signals at each of the subscribers using the first key, means for encrypting the first key using a second key, said second key being different for each group of subscribers having a common interest in a type of programs, means for broadcasting the encrypted first key to all subscribers, means for decrypting the encrypted first key at each of the subscribers using the second key.<br>
Such a system can be used for example in a pay-TV system. A system of this type is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,531,020. For security reasons it would be desired to change the second key rapidly. In the known system this would however require a large amount of data to be distributed to the subscribers in the system. Distributing a large amount of data for changing the keys reduces the availability of bandwidth for broadcasting program signals and the like. Therefore the second key is changed at a very low rate of each month or even less.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a system of the above-mentioned type, wherein the second key can be changed relatively rapidly without requiring the distribution of a large amount of data.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According  to  the  invention the  system of the  above-mentioned type  is characterised in that said second key is a combination of a key common to all<br><br>
subscribers and a difference key which is unique per type of programs, wherein means are provided for encrypting the common key and for broadcasting the encrypted common key to all subscribers and means for decrypting the encrypted common key at each of the subscribers.<br>
In this manner the second key can be changed very rapidly by changing the common key which is common to all subscribers so that only one key for the complete system needs to be distributed.<br>
Preferably the system comprises means for changing the common key at a relatively high rate.<br>
The system of the invention further shows the advantage that a different key hierarchy can be used for entitlements and security, repectively. At the entitlement level the second key is different for each group of subscribers having a common interest in a specific type of programs, such as sports, film etc. The difference in second keys is obtained by providing different difference keys for each type of program or individual program etc. The security structure however can be structured to eliminate pirate smart cards as soon as possible. According to the invention said means for encrypting and decrypting the common key, respectively, include a chain of encrypting and decrypting means, respectively, each next encrypting and decrypting means  operating   in  a  manner  common  to  a  smaller  number  of subscribers.<br>
In this manner the group including the pirated smart card can be found relatively easily.<br><br>
The invention further provides a system for decrypting encrypted data signals in a broadcasting system with a number of subscribers, comprising means for decrypting the encrypted data signals using a first key, means for decrypting the encrypted first key at each of the subscribers using a second key, said second key being different for each group of subscribers having a common interest in a type of program, characterized in that said second key is a combination of a key common to all subscribers and a difference key which is unique per type of programs, wherein means are provided for decrypting the encrypted common key at each of the subscribers.<br>
BRIEF OF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will be further explained by reference to the drawings in which two embodiments of the system according to the invention is shown in a very schematical manner.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a diagram of a first embodiment of a system for broadcasting data signals according to the invention.<br>
FIG. 2 show a diagram of a second embodiment of a system for decrypting encrypted data signals in a second embodiment of the broadcasting system of the invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br>
It is observed that in the specification and drawing reference numerals are used with a character E or D added to indicate the encryption and decryption side, respectively. Further P' is used to indicate the encrypted version of P, for example.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1 there is shown in a very schematical way a system for broadcasting data signals in a secure manner. The data to be broadcasted can be a tv-program signal or any other data signal. The data is provided to a first encryptor or encrypting device IE delivering encrypted data signals encrypted using a first key or control word CW. The encrypted data signals are broadcasted to all subscribers in the system in a manner not further shown. Broadcasting may take place through satellite, antenna, cable or any suitable manner. The control word CW is encrypted in a second encryptor 2E using a second key P+D and the encrypted control word CW' is also broadcasted. The second key P+D is different for each group of subscribers having a common interest in a type of program, such as for example sport programs, films, entertainment and the like. This means that for each different program or each different film for example, a different second key is required. This difference is obtained by combining a common key P which is common to all subscribers in the system, and a difference key D which is unique per type of program. The common key P and the difference key D are combined in a combination device 3E receiving the common key P and a difference key D. The difference key D is also encrypted in an encryptor 4E using a group key G common to a group of subscribers of 256 subscribers, for example.  The encrypted difference key D' is also broadcasted.<br><br>
The common key P is also encrypted in a further encryptor 5E using a key H common to a group of subscribers substantially larger than the number of subscribers having the same group key G. The subscribers using the same key H can be called a super group. The encrypted common key P' is also broadcasted.<br>
At the receiver side, i.e. at each subscriber the encrypted first key CW is received and decrypted in a decryptor or decrypting device 2D using the second key P+D to obtain the first key CW to decrypt the encrypted data in a decryptor ID, so that the subscriber can watch the program or film or the like to which he is entitled. The difference key D' is decrypted in a decryptor 4D using the group key G to obtain the difference key D and this difference key is combined with the common key P in the combination device 3D to obtain the second key P+D. The common key P is obtained by decrypting the encrypted common key P' in a decryptor 5D using the super group key H.<br>
As indicated by a dashed line, the system can be seen as being divided in an entitlement section below the dashed line which is structured to manage entitlements, i,e. providing entitlements to the subscribers to watch different type of programs, films and the Uke. In this section the first key CW is changed rapidly, for example each 10 seconds. The difference key D is changed at a low rate, for example each month.<br><br>
In the security section, the common key P can also be changed rapidly, for example each 10 seconds, so that the second key required to decrypt the first key CW actually also is changed at a relatively high rate. In this manner the security of the system is enhanced without the requirement of distributing a large database of the program dependent second keys to all groups of subscribers.<br>
Further, the security section can be structured to eliminate pirate cards as soon as possible. This means that the super group key H used for encrypting and decrypting the common key can be obtained through a chain of encrypting and decrypting devices 6E,7E and 6D,7D, respectively, wherein each next encrypting and decrypting device uses a key which is common to a smaller number of subscribers. This means that each next encrypting and decrypting device operates in a manner common to a smaller number of subscribers. In the embodiment shown, the super group key H is encrypted and decrypted, respectively by encrypting and decrypting devices using the group key G common to a group of 256 subscribers. This group key G is encrypted and decrypted, respectively in encrypting and decrypting devices 7E, 7D using a card key Xi. It is noted that the chain of encrypting and decrypting devices may include more or less levels depending on the overall size of the system for example.<br>
If a pirate card is found, it can be determined quickly in which group of 256 subscribers the card key Xi is located. By changing this one group key G the pirate cards can be switched off.<br><br>
In the system described above, smart cards can be used having a memory divided in sectors to be used by different service providers. In such a case each service provider operates his own entitlement and security structure. FIG. 2 shows the receiving side at a subscriber in a different embodiment of the system of the invention, wherein when smart cards with several sectors are used, each service provider can use his own entitlement structure using group keys G, second keys combining a common key P and difference keys D, and first keys CW. Separate from this entitlement structure there is a security structure common to all sectors using the same key hierarchy as shown in FIG. 1, wherein however a separate group key GS is used to locate the pirate cards if a pirate card is found.<br>
In the drawings means for providing and changing the first and difference keys CW and D is indicated by a block 8 and means for providing and changing the keys P, H, G and Xi is indicated by a block 9. In practice the keys can be can be generated and changed in any suitable manner. Further, the keys at the subscriber side will generally be stored in a memory. Except for the part described above a conditional access module and decoder known per se can be used by the subscriber.<br>
It is noted that in the above-described systems encryption and decryption algorithms using keys are applied at all levels. However at least with respect to the encryption and decryption of the difference key D and the key H and the algorithm used in the devices 7E, 7D it is also possible to use an encryption algorithm and decryption algorithm which does not use a key. In such a system the algorithm itself<br><br>
need to be changed if for security reasons the operator wishes to use a different algorithm.<br>
Therefore, it will be understood that in the above-described systems any suitable encryption and decryption algorithm either key-based or not, can be used- The invention is not restricted to the use of a specific algorithm. Further, decryption may include any suitable authentication algorithm. The combination function used to combine the keys P and D to obtain the second key P+D can also be any suitable function and is not restricted to merely adding of P and D. Further it will be understood that the encryption and decryption devices can be implemented in any suitable manner, for example by using a microprocessor and suitable software. Therefore, the specific terms "device, encryptor, decryptor, encrypting means and decrypting means" as used in the specification and claims should not be deemed to be limited to physical devices. On the contrary, it will be clear to the skilled person that the encryption and decryption functions can be realized in various manners either in software or hardware.<br>
