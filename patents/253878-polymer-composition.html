				<td>Polymer composition<br>
The present invention concerns a polymer composition comprising at least one polyolefin and at least one component that is not a polyolefin.<br>
According to second aspect the invention concerns adaptation of different properties of a polymer composition by suitable choice of the above mentioned components. According to a third aspect the invention concerns use of such polymer compositions.<br>
Background<br>
Polymer materials are utilized in an increasing number of categories of products, such as components for cars, boats, airplanes, within the electronics industry and other advanced industry as well as in paints and other coatings, for special packaging etc, The uses of polymer materials in new categories of products are only limited by the product properties, It is thus a continuous need for development of polymer products with improved properties e.g. with respect to increased scratch resistance, improved weather resistance, increased UV resistance, increased chemical resistance and improved properties with respect to anti oxidation, anticorrosion etc.<br>
In addition to pure polymer materials there has also been developed products based on materials that may be described as hybrids between inorganic and organic materials, which means that these materials are macro molecules that may have an inorganic core and organic branches.<br>
Organic polymer molecules with branched structures have an enormous economical growth potential, particularly as components in new materials. So-called dendrimers are important examples of such polymer molecules with a perfectly branched structure as well as hyperbranched polymers with statistically progressive branching. Both dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers are denoted dendritic polymers. Dendritic (from Greec: "dendron" = tree) characterizes the principle of a progressive branching that is more or less perfect (G,R, Newkome, C.N. Moorefield, F. VSgtle, "Dendrimers and Dendrons: Concepts, Syntheses, Applications", Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, (2001)). Formula 1 illustrates the principle difference between linear polymers and dendritic polymers (hyperbranched polymers and dendrimers).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
K •» germ (the beginning of the polymer<br>
molecule)<br>
L = linear propagation<br>
Formula 1<br><br>
D = dendritic branching<br>
T - termination (the end of the polymer<br>
molecule)<br><br>
Dendritic polymers are particularly interesting because the T units may carry functional groups and the density of available functional groups per weight or volume unit of the polymer is much higher than what is the case for linear polymers. Functional T groups may be used to impart a function in a material, like an antioxidant, a UV absorber, or a radical scavenger as described in WO publication No. 02092668.<br>
Alternatively the T groups may be used as very efficient cross-linkers of organic materials like epoxy resins or polyurethaties or as cross-linkers for thermoplastics. Due to the high degree of cross-linking between dendritic polymers and such organic compounds the dendritic polymers are superior cross-linkers compared to conventional cross-linkers like polyamines, polyalcohols. or multifunctional acrylates. Higher degree of cross-linking of an organic material like a cross-linked thermoplastic improves properties such as chemical resistance, weather resistance and wears resistance and makes the material useful for applications at higher temperature. (Hans Zweifel (ed.), Plastics Additives Handbook, Carl Hanser Verlag, Miinchen, (2001), 725-811). The T groups may also be used to organize the dendritic polymers in a network. As component in a material the dendritic polymer thus may induce improved barrier properties. Alternatively such dendritic polymers may be used as a binder or as a component in a thermoset plastic.<br><br>
Dendrimers are usually manufactured in relatively complicated and expensive synthesis comprising several steps. Hie process conditions must be maintained very accurately in order to achieve a perfect progressive branch structure. Their industrial applications are therefore limited.<br>
A general way of manufacture of hyper branched polymers was early described by Flory (P.J.. Flory, Principles of Polymer Chemistry, Cornell University, (1953)). The polymerization of an AB2 monomer where A may react with B but where the reactions between A and A and between B and B are precluded, leads to a hyperbranched polymer.<br>
Another way of manufacturing hyperbranched polymers involves the utilization of a reactive monomer that also carries an initiator, a so-called "inimer". One example is the base catalyzed reaction between the inimer gfycidol and the germ trimethylol propane as illustrated by Formula 2.<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br><br><br>
K = germ (the beginning of the polymer<br>
molecule)<br>
L = linear propagation<br>
Formula 2<br>
D = dendritic branching<br>
T = termination (the end of the polymer molecule)<br><br>
Hyperbranched polymers made in this way have properties that are quite similar to corresponding dendrimers (A. Sunder, R. Hansetaiann, H. Frey, R. Mtthlhaupt; Macromolecides, (1998), 32, 4240), This implies a touch iower viscosity than that of linear polymers with a comparable number of free available HO-groups. A characteristic feature in the manufacturing process is that the inimer glycidol must be added very slowly to the germ and in a very thin dilution. Thus, the cost-efficiency of the process is severely reduced which is why the utility of hyperbranched polymers in industrial applications is quite limited.<br>
It is previously known to perform certain modifications of the T groups of hyperbranched polymers. J.-P. Majoral, A.-M. Caminade and R, Kraemer, Andes de QuimicaInt. Ed., (1997X 93,415-421 describe the functionalization of dendrimers containing phosphorus. The fimctionalization of the T groups can be made with identical I similar chemical groups or with different chemical groups.<br>
FR 2761691 discusses dendrimers with functional groups atthe surface that are modified through a reaction with cyclic thioesters.   The reaction leads to a dendrimer surface with thiol groups that are attached to the dendrimer by amide or amine bondings. The products may be used as antioxidants. The dendrimers described are of the type polyanudoamine dendrimers (PAMAM dendrimers). PAMAM dendrimers contain tertiary amines that comparatively easy may be degraded after conversion to quaternary ammonium salts or aminoxides ( A. W. Hofmann, Jtistus LiebigsAm. Cheai. (1851), 78, 253-286; A. C. Cope, E. R. Trumbull, Org. React. (I960), 11,317-493; A. C. Cope, T. T. Foster, p. H, Towle, J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1949), 71,3929-3935). Quaternary ammonium salts or aminoxides from amine based dendrimers can be formed when additives of amine based dendrimers are incorporated/ compounded into thermoplastics with subsequent processing of the thermoplastics (e,g. film blowing, extrusion, casting). Such a degradation on one hand leads to a partial deterioration of the dendrimer core and on the other hand to formation of degradation products which may leak out and thereby reduce the surface quality of the polymer product. In addition tertiary amines may during processing of the thermoplastic form free radicals by decomposition of hydro peroxides (A. V. Tobolsky, R.B. Mesrobian, Organic Peroxides, (1954), Interscience Publishers, New York, p. 104-106). Dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers that contain tertiary amines thereby may induce an unintended degradation of thermoplastics during their processing, storage or use.<br>
WO 01/48057 discusses multifunctional stabilizers against thermal oxidaiive degradation based on a core structure containing tertiary amities. As mentioned above this may lead to an unintended degradation of the core structure during processing, storage or use of (the) thermoplastics. The molar weight of a typical stabilizer manufactured in accordance with WO 01/48057 is 1246 g/mole.<br>
WO 97/19987 discusses combinations of polymer additives and modified dendrimers feat may be used in polymer materials. In the exemplification of WO 97/199987 the dendrimers are based on polypropyleneimine (PPI) of 3tfi, 4th and 5* generation thereby including 16, 32, and 64 terminal<br><br>
amine groups. The core structure contains tertiary amines which may lead to an unintentiea degradation of the core structure during processing, storage or use of thermoplastics. The modification of the PPI dendrimer with a fatty acid to form a multifunctional fatty acid amide may bee conducted by means of heating in a suitable solvent. The tertiary amine groups hi th« core structure of the dendrimer and primary amine groups at the dendrimer surface may in presence of oxygen contribute to partial degradation of the dendrimer structure. As explained above free radicals may be formed by decomposition of hydro peroxides. Such a partial degradation is indicated by a faint brown or yellow colour of the modified PPI dendrimer, like in examples I, XI, and XII in WO 97/19987. Typical molecule weights for modified PPI dendruners in WO 97/19987 are in the range 10 000 to 40 000 g/mole. In WO 02/092668 surface activated hyperbranched or dendritic stabilizers comprising at least one additive group and a hyperbranched or dendritic core is discussed. In the exemplification of WO 02/092668 only dendritic cores based on 2,2-bts-(hydfoxymethyl)-propionic acid is used. The dendritic core and the bonding to the additive group thereby are mainly based on ester bondings, which make the stabilizer sensitive to hydrolysis. In addition the exemplification of WO 02/092668 shows that the molecules of the prepared stabilizers as determined by gel permeation chromatography is between 1000 and 1500 grams/ mole.<br>
One type of paniculate polymers with properties corresponding to the properties of hyperbranched polymers comprises an inorganic SixO(i.s)X-core with one T group per Si atom and is known as POSS (polyhedral oligosilesquioxanes). The most common compound of this class is a POSS with •£=8 and substantially cubic structure (C. Sanchez, G J. de A.A. Soler-Illia, F. Ribot, T. Lalot, C.R. Mayer, V. Cabuil; Chem. Mater., (2001), 13,3066). The manufacture of POSS is expensive (M.C. Gravel, C. Zhang, M. Dinderman, R.M. L&amp;ms;Appl. Organometal. Chem., (1999), 13, 329-336 and WO 01/10871) and their industrial applicability is therefore limited.<br>
Another type of particulate polymers with properties corresponding to the properties of hyperbarnched polymers consists of an inorganic SixO(i.s)X core that carries one T group per Si atom and may be manufactured in a sol-gel process through controlled hydrolysis and condensation of a silane with a structure:<br>
Where Y is chosen among hydrolysable residues and X-B basically corresponds to the T group. The process is described e.g. in Applicant's own WO publication No. 0208343. Sol-gel processes may be cost efficient so that they may be conducted in industrial scale from favourable raw materials and under mild conditions, i.e. without use of high pressures or high temperatures and without particular precautions like extreme dilution or the like. Thus particulate polymers with properties corresponding to properties of hyperbranched polymers manufactured by sol gel processes are industrially applicable in many areas.<br><br>
Many examples of utilization of sol gel products in polymer products are known (DE 199 33 093, EP 666 290). Normally the main focus is placed upon the inorganic SiKQ(u)x core with a size in the nanometre range and thereby upon the sol-gel product as inorganic nano particle, cf. DE 199 33 098 and EP 486 469. The inorganic residues X-B are typically used to anchor the sol gel products int an organic matrix, cf. EP 486 469.<br>
Trie sol gel process involving hydrolysis and condensation of a silane in which the X-B group contains one or more amide groups is particularly simple because no external catalyst is needed and because die process may be conducted at ambient temperature or under moderate heating. One example is controlled hydrolysis and condensation of y-aminopropyl trialkoxysilane as described in applicant's own patent application, WO publication No. 020 8343. Controlled hydrolysis and condensation of silanes in which the X-B groups contains one or more amide groups typically leads to a sol in which the resulting particulate polymer product has an organic/ inorganic structure (hybrid polymer) that is comparable with a hyperbranched polymer product with a number of more or less tree amtae groups in the T groups. Such organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers exhibits a large number of functional T groups compared to their weight and/ or volume. At the same time its compact structure compared to the structure of linear polymers ensures desirable properties like low viscosity and good admixing properties with mermoset plastics and thermoplastics. An example of an organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer with properties corresponding to a hyperbranched polymsr is shown by Formula 3:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br>
D = dendritic branching based on SiOu	T = termination (functional T-groups)<br>
D-groups that are bonded to fewer than three D units do not carry hydrotysed and/ or condensed substituents<br>
Formula 3<br><br>
Use of fat-soluble metal compounds in which the metal is present in its tiignesr siaoie oxiaauuu state at standard conditions and/ or organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers with properties similar to hyperbranched polymers can improve the compatibility between different thermoplastics. In addition polymer compositions, e.g. in the form of compounds comprising at least one poJyolefin and at least one of the following components<br>
a)	a thermoplastic which is not a polyolefin,<br>
b)	hyperbranched organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer comprising an inorganic core carrying an<br>
organic branches, core and branches forming a particle structure.,<br>
c)	fat-soluble metal compound in which the metal is present in its highest stable oxidation<br>
state at standard conditions (25°C and maximum 98% humidity)<br>
in addition to known polymer additives (Hans Zweifel (ed.), Plastics Additives Handbook, Carl Hanser Vet-lag, Munchen, (2001)) can be used in applications other than that of pure thermoplastic materials including compositions thereof.<br>
Objects<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide polymer compositions comprising at least one polyolefln, for which properties like weather resistance, scratch resistance, viscosity, degree of cross-linking, shelf life, barrier properties, flame and temperature resistance, rigidity, retention of additives and/ r degradation products, and controlled release of additives easily can be adapted in dependence of the relevant application.<br>
The invention<br>
The above mentioned objects are achieved by means of a polymer composition as claimed in claim 1.<br>
According to another aspect the invention concerns use of such a polymer compositions, as claimed in claims 17-19.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed by the dependent claims.<br>
The difference between the methods of manufacture of the polybranched organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers defined by claims 2 and 12 respectively solely depends on whether the starting organic afruno-functional silanes used are hydrolysed and condensed or not hydrolysed. In the latter case hydrolysis and condensation form the first step in a process comprising at least two steps. In the former case such a step obviously is redundant and therefore omitted. The skilled artisan will furthermore understand that the group X-B is chosen such that it will not be hydrolysed under the conditions that will be applied for the method.<br>
In either case free amine groups are modified through a chemical substitution after the completed silane hydrolysis and condensation. Suitable chemical substitutions are conducted between the free<br><br>
amine groups in the T groups and reactive compounds that preferably react actually quantitatively with more or less free amine groups at temperatures typically below 470 K and pressures typically lower than 0.3 MPa,<br>
Particularly interesting are soi-gel processes by which the T groups may be chemically modified in one or more steps immediately alter the hydrolysis and condensation has been completed and for which the reactor equipment used for the silane hydrolysis and condensation may be employed. Such batch processes form the basis for a very cost efficient manufacture of particulate organic/ inorganic poiybranched polymers which can carry a large number of different T groups and which therefore may be used in a large number of different industrial areas of application.<br>
By reactions typical for primary and secondary amines is meant addition reactions, substitution reactions and combinations of such reactions with suitable reactant such as, but not limited to, compounds comprising epoxy groups, isocyanate groups, reactive double bonds, substitutable groups, and proton donating groups.<br>
By an alternative or supplementary modification an acid is added, which may be a Lewis acid or a Broensted acid, and which is able to cause an addition to N atoms hi the X-B group in order to convert such N atoms to quaternary nitronium ions.<br>
By controlled hydrolysis and condensation in this description is understood hydrolysis and condensation of a silane compound as described hi WO publication No. 0208343 with the difference that the reaction mixture includes a suitable stabilizer that prevents oxidative degradation of reactants and reaction products during hydrolysis and condensation and subsequent modification.<br>
The first step is hydrolysis of a suitable silane compound, R*-Si(OR)a, wherein the group R' does not participate in the hydrolysis or condensation reactions. Alkoxide ligands are replaced by hydroxyl groups:<br>
Si-OR+H-OH   Si-OH -f ROM<br>
A controlled amount of water and a controlled amount of a glycol based solvent is added during this step. The reaction temperature and the reaction time are also controlled.<br>
The second step is condensation in which the hydroxyl group can react with hydroxyl groups or alkoxy groups from other silicon centres and form Si-O-Si bonds and water or alcohol respectively:<br>
Si-OH + HO-S1    Si-O-Si +H2O<br>
or<br>
Si-OR + HO-SJ     Si-O-Si +ROH<br>
To manufacture particles of a certain size it is required to establish chemical conditions that ensures a correct balance between the kinetics of the two reactions, namely condensation and hydrolysis. While the condensation contributes to formation of polymer chains from (single) monomer<br><br>
molecules, the hydrolysis contributes to a polycrystallinic precipitation or oxohydroxide precipitation. The combination of arnino-tunctional silanes and exchange of alkoxide groups with strong ligands will moderate the hydrolysis reaction, which will ensure that the polymer chains not become too long but remiart in the size of oligomers. In practice the particles will be prepared with a size of few nanometres, more typically less than 10 nm. A suitable stabilizer is normally added to the reaction composition to avoid oxidative degradation of reactants and reaction products during hydrolysis and condensation and subsequent modification. The resulting solution is comprised of inorganic polymer particles dipersed in a solvent.<br>
According to the present invention component d) of fee composition may be manufactured by a sol-gel process comprising at least two steps in a defined chronological sequence. In the first steps the core is prepared by controlled hydrolysis and condensation of a silane with formula:<br>
with the provisions and definitions stated in claim 4.<br>
In the second step the organic branches is developed by a substitution of N-H hydrogen atoms of the X-B group through reactions mat are typical for primary and secondary amines and/ or by the alternative modification mentioned above. In the first mentioned type of reactions suitable reactants are reactive compounds such as epoxides, cyclic and non-cyclic acid derivatives, blocked and unblocked isocyanates, compounds with reactive double bonds, aldehydes, ketones, proton donating compounds, and compounds R-X mat comprises<br>
a) a suitable atom or atom group X and a group R,<br>
in which R-X may react with more or less free amine groups in a substitution reaction in which an atom or an atom group X is replaced by an amine group (Endre Berner, "Lajrebok i organisk kjemi", Aschehoug &amp; Co., Oslo (1964), s. 144-147) and where the group R is chosen among non-substituted saturated or unsaturated Ci-C24 alkyl, substituted saturated or unsaturated Ci-C24 alkyl* non-substituted or substituted aryl, aliphatic or aromatic carbonyl, while the carbon chains of said compounds optionally can contain one or more of the elements oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorous, silicon, and boron; or groups chosen among condensation products or addition products of one or more types of chemical compounds such as acids, alcohols, phenols, amines, aldehydes, or epoxides in which the atom or atom group X preferably is chosen among halogen, substituted or non-substituted alkoxyl, phenoxyl, amine, carboxylate, sulphonate, sulphinate, phosphonate, or phosphinate.<br>
When step i) is an addition reaction it is convenient and preferred that this is conducted by substitution of the N-H hydrogen atom with an A-=B double bond where A, B are chosen among the elements C, O, N. S and P. According to an also preferred alternative the addition reaction involves ring opening of an epoxide group that optionally may be succeeded by reaction<br><br>
(substitution) with a ketone or an aldehyde. Yet another preferred embodiment for the accoBaplishmeEt of the addition reaction consists in a reaction at the 3M-H hydrogen atom with a blocked or unblocked isocyanate. Still another preferred embodiment for accomplishing the addition reaction includes ring opening of a cyclic acid anhydride or derivative thereof, such as a carbonic acid derivative. Also a combination of such reactant as mentioned above may be used for the desired addition reaction.<br>
For some objects is preferred that the developed branches in the organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers includes groups that are derivatives of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine or derivatives of phenol<br>
When using an addition reaction a molar excess of the reactant causing the addition reaction may be added if desired, leading to repeated addition reactions which in practice involves a polymerization of the organic branches.<br>
As reactant when using at least one substitution reaction in step i) a mono functional carboxylic acid or a derivative of a sulphinic or sulphom'c acid may be used.<br>
In step ii) the add used can be a Lewis acid or a Broensted acid.<br>
The method of manufecture according to the invention is not dependent upon a certain type of reaction medium and may be conducted in bom aqueous and organic based dispersion agents. It is particularly surprising and beneficial mat it is also applicable in water based media, which is also environmentally favourable. Presence of the organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer may stabilize the polymer composition and may act to cross-link polymer chains in the composition.<br>
For particular purposes it is preferred to use particularly selected reactants mat lead to specific properties for the paniculate, polybranched, organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer. For example, in order to obtain a product with flame retardant properties it is advantageous to use reactants that comprise halogen for the reaction exemplified as addition reaction oar substitution reaction. If a particularly hydrophobia end product is desired it may be advantageous to use at least one fluorinated reactant in step i) and/ or ii) of the method according to flhe invention.<br>
For further use or treatment of the particulate, polybranched organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer it is convenient that it has at least one polymerizable double bond, such as part of an aery] group, vinyl group or an unsaturated fatty acid.<br>

In the manufacture of a polybranched, organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer by a sol-gel process, the hybrid polymer having the form of an inorganic core and organic branches, a suitable stabilizer is normally added to the reaction composition to prevent oxidative degradation of the reactauts and reaction products during hydrolysis and condensation and subsequent modification of X-B-Si(-Y)3. Suitable stabilizers are radical scavengers based on hindered amines, one or more antioxidants or a combination of same (Hans Zweifel (ed.)5 Plastics Additives Handbook, Carl Hanser Verlag, Mtochen, (2001), 10-19).<br>
By first hydrolysing the molecules that comprises the organic core and thereafter through suitable reaction, addition or addition, attach the organic branches thereto, the method of the present invention thereby provides a particularly high degree of branching and a control of the particle size in the thus produced sol that has never before been achieved. This leads to several advantages, Firstly the hydrolysis may be conducted more completely than what is the case if the particle composition includes some very large particles, Secondly the risk that water used for the hydrolysis to some extent unintentionally reacts with active groups in the organic parts of the molecule is avoided.<br>
The invention thus provide a possibility of manufacturing a large number of differently functionalized organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers with properties corresponding to the properties of hyperbranched polymers, through a simple two step batch process under mild conditions (T 
Such organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers have properties that are comparable with the properties of organic, hyperbranched polymers and may be used for many applications, like functional additives<br><br>
in thermoplastics and thermoset plastics, e.g. as antioxidant, UV absorb or radical scavenger, as cross-binder in thermoplastics and thermoset plastics, as component in adhesives, lacquers and coating products and as functional material in other connections. Used as additive the polybranehed hybrid polymers prepared according to the invention contribute to a lasting increase in scratch resistance and weather resistance for the products in which they are used.<br>
Temperature and stability during hydrolysis of the organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers according to the invention are better than those of the organic hyperbranched polymers due to stable Si-O bonds in the polymer core and due to the core's compact structure with a very high degree of cross-linking.<br>
Reversible viscosity changes is observed during heating/ cooling due to the particulate structure with a stable inorganic core and function carrying organic groups that are bonded to the inorganic core, which is important in connection with the subsequent treatment/ processing of products based on the invention.<br>
The choice of method for the manufacture of materials and products according to the invention enables an industrial utilization of the invention in a cost efficient manner. The manufacture of materials and products according to the invention is based on a batch process under mild conditions (T 
By convenient choice of raw materials for the method according to the invention, stabilizers, coating forming additives or other additives may be manufactured. Such stabilizers or other additives provide a broader range of applications than what is the case for known, mono functional stabilizers and may be used hi lacquers, paints, thermoset plastics and thermoplastics. By convenient choice of raw materials one may for instance in combination with a suitable polymer achieve an excellent barrier layer for molecules in gas and liquid form, like water, Oa, CO2 and hydrocarbons.<br>
The invention furthermore concerns additives for avoiding leakages of additives and/ or degradation products. Correspondingly self-organizing networks may be formed, such as in adhesives or thermo-stable/ thermo-reversible networks that find use in functional materials.<br>
Fat-soluble metal compounds for use in a composition according to the invention may be prepared (manufactured) by reacting a metal salt with an acidic, organic compound in a process in which a suitable oxidation agent ensures that all the metal in the end product is present in its highest stable oxidation step at standard conditions (25 C and maximum 98% humidity). The acidic, organic compound can e.g. be a C« - C24 fatty acid or a Cs - C34 fatty acid derivative. A particular feature of the manufacturing process can involve the use of a completely or partially halogenated Cs - C24 fatty acid or derivative thereof. Another particular feature of the manufacturing process can be that<br><br>
the Cg~C24 fattv ae*d or Cg-C24 fatty a°id derivative Is completely or partially unsaturated. A third particular feature of the manufacturing process can be that the oxidation agent used is hydrogen peroxide or an organic peroxide.<br>
Per se known polymer additives are described by Hans Zweifel (Hans Zweifel (ed.), Plastics Additives Handbook, Carl Manser Verlag, Mtachen, (2001)),<br>
The polymer composition according to the invention may have the form of an independent, homogenous product, i.e. that all the components are evenly distributed in a polymer matrix. The polymer composition may also constitute a layer of a laminate in which the other layers may have a composition that either fall within or not fall within the definition of the polymer composition according to the invention, In cases where the other layers do not fall within the definition according to the invention, these layers may be polymers of one or more components or substrates of another type, i.e. not polymers. The polymer composition may also have the form of a tube that either is a complete product or constitutes a protecting film around other components that similar to the layers of the laminate structure either may fall within or not fall within the definition of the polymer composition according to the present invention.<br>
With "partially heterogeneous structure" inn this context is understood a product that does not have a uniform structure throughout but may have a composition in the form of a laminate hi which each layer is homogenous but different from the composition of at least one other layer.<br>
The polymer composition may, however, also have a heterogeneous structure (product) in which each layer separately do not fall within the definition of the present invention, but where the product as a whole still falls within the definition of the product. For example, component d) and e) may constitute a majority of one layer of the product while another layer of the product may be a pure polymer such as PE or PP.<br>
A polymer composition according to the invention may be used as a transition (intermediate) layer between a coating based on a polybranched organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer and a thermoplastic<br>
(material).<br>
Examples<br>
Experiment 1<br>
Manufacture of ajjolybranched organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer by a sol-gel process.<br>
a)  221.4 g (1.00 mol) y-ammopropyltriethoxysilane (A-l 100, GE SHicones, USA) was placed in a 1000 ml round bottom flask with hose cooler and magnetic stirrer. A mixture of 93.6 g (0.60 moles) butyldiglycol (BDG) and 22.5 g (1.30 moles) water and 1.00 g Tinuvin 123 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Switzerland) was added. The mixture was heated in an oil bath at 110°C under reflux for 45 minutes. Thereafter the volatile reaction products or reactants were removed in a vacuum distillation at the oil bath temperature of 110°C - 160°C and a<br><br>
vacuum gradient from about 1000 mbar to less than 20 mbar. The distillation was terminated when the pressure in the round bottom flask has reached 20 mbar or less for 10 minutes,  Ca, 192 ml distillate was recovered. The reaction product was a clear, uncoloured liquid with a Gardner Color - 1 (according to. Gardner Color Scale / ASTM D1544)<br>
b) The reaction product from a) was heated to 70°C to obtain a clear liquid. Then 256.4 g (1.00 moles) of Araldite DY-E (glycidylether of CirCu-ftlcohol, Vantico AO (Huntsman AG), Switzerland) was added and the reaction mixture was held at 70°C for an hour. A clear product with a Gardner Color = 1, having the form of a viscous gel at 20°C and a non-viscous liquid at 90°C, was obtained.<br>
The distillate in a) comprises insignificant amounts of volatile amine. In a corresponding experiment in which no stabilizer (like e.g. Tinuvin 123) was used during the manufacturing process, the distillate in a) comprises relatively large amounts of the volatile amine products, which mainly is due to degradation of A-l 100 during the synthesis.<br>

Experiment 20<br>
Manufacture of a fat-soluble ferric compound ("Nor-X").<br>
The synthesis was conducted in a beatable 5 litre glass reactor with feeding funnels, a mechanically operated glass stirrer, a glass mantled thermometer, a distillation cooler, an adjustable air inlet and a bottom valve. 2,180 kg (7,66 moles) of stearic acid was melted in the reactor. The air inlet was adjusted to about 200 ml air per minute and the temperature in the reactor was controlled to 120 °C. 600 grams (2,22 moles) of ferric chloride hexahydrate was dissolved in 600 ml of water to obtain about 900 ml of an aqueous ferric chloride solution. This solution was added through one of the feeding funnels at a rate of about 20 ml per minute to the melted stearic acid. The total addition of aqueous ferric chloride solution was controlled to ensure that the amount of distilled water and hydrogen chloride corresponded to the amount aqueous ferric chloride solution added. Continuous addition of air and a 2 ml per minute addition of a 3 % aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution through the other feeding funnel ensured that oxidation state HI of the ferric ions were maintained. After completed addition of aqueous ferric chloride solution the mixture was boiled and distilled under continuous addition of air and a 5 ml per minute addition of a 3 % aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution until the distinct yellow colour of aqueous ferric chloride solution no longer could be observed. Then the ferric stearate product was drained through the bottom valve into 10 litre of aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution. When the following gas development is about to terminate the ferric stearate product is filtered from the liquid phase and thoroughly washed with water to remove any remains of ferric chloride. The ferric stearate product is then dispersed in a 1 % aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution at 55 C for 2 hours by means of a dispersing rod. The dispersed ferric stearate product is filtered from the liquid phase, thoroughly washed with water and dried in a convection oven at 50 °C.<br><br>
