				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a process of preparation of personal cleansing gel composition for<br>
skin and/or hair. The invention relates to process of preparation of a personal cleansing gel<br>
composition, said personal cleansing gel composition comprising anionic surfactant,<br>
amphoteric surfactant, non-ionic surfactant, neutralizer and rheology modifier. In particular,<br>
the invention relates to a process for the preparation of personal cleansing gel compositions<br>
where the composition is devoid of air-bubbles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE ART<br>
Different kinds and varieties of personal cleansing gel composition are commonly available<br>
in market. Owing to the ingredients, which constitute them, they vary in their aesthetics<br>
appeal, fragrance, colour and delivery of desirable sensory and aroma therapeutic effects.<br>
An attractive visual appearance is sine qua non of beauty products to which personal<br>
cleansing gel composition is no exception. Therefore research has continually been focused<br>
on the general appearance of personal cleansing gel composition, improvements thereof and<br>
on processes, which provide products that find better acceptability amongst consumers.<br>
Transparent gel preparations appeal to the eye and air bubbles suspended in them further add<br>
to their aesthetic appeal. Many such products are known in the art and are available in the<br>
market.<br>
US 5,646,100 discloses an aqueous mild to the skin cleansing composition comprising<br>
laureth sulfate, an alkyl carboxy amido alkylene betaine, an alkyl polyglycoside and<br>
antibacterial effective amount of triclosan.<br>
US 6,518,228 discloses a ultra-mild, clear, aqueous, foamable skin cleanser composition<br>
comprising one salt of a fatty acid amide of an amino acid , acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylates<br>
crosspolymer, water.<br>
US 6,365,559 relates to a clear personal cleansing composition comprising water, sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate, an amphoteric cleansing agent compromising at least one betaine, a cloud<br>
point depressing agent comprising ammonium chloride, at least one preservative and optional<br>
ingredients.<br>
US 6,383,997 relates to an alcohol based antibacterial liquid formulation with high lathering<br>
properties, containing an antibacterial agent, an anionic surfactant, moisturizers, skin<br>
conditioners, and a high level of alcohol for frequent use in disinfecting the hands and body.<br>
US 5,866,110 relates to a mild liquid personal cleansing composition comprising an alkyl<br>
ethoxylated sulfate anionic surfactant, an amphoteric surfactant selected from the group<br>
consisting of betaine surfactants, an N-acylamino acid surfactant, or salt thereof, a cationic<br>
cellulose ether derivative, water and a C12 to C14 fatty alcohol.<br>
These prior patents disclose shower gel preparations, which may be opaque or transparent.<br>
However improvements have always been desirable and such products, which while<br>
appearing attractive are able to provide added sensory' and/or aroma-therapeutic effects are<br>
eagerly sought after. A step towards the preparation of such products has been the<br>
incorporation of insoluble particles containing desired active ingredients in shower gel<br>
formulations. Still more desirable are products wherein the incorporated particles, when used,<br>
may be suspended in the aqueous gel matrix to appear appealing to the eye. Achieving<br>
stability in such formulations, wherein the desired molecules have been suspended, is<br>
challenging. Even so, stabilization procedures, though not perfect, are known in the art. One<br>
of the problems associated with these procedures is the inadvertent appearance and<br>
stabilization of air bubbles in the formulation. A process to control the appearance of these<br>
air bubbles is not available in the known art. Even though a few suspended air bubbles are<br>
acceptable and help enhance the visual effect, an excess of these only makes the final<br>
formulation unattractive. High density of air bubbles also has a negative impact on the<br>
flowability characteristics of the gel composition, which is amplified manifold while<br>
handling the formulation on an industrial scale. Also, the presence of air bubbles causes<br>
hindrance during the filling procedure of the final formulation. Therefore the density of air<br>
bubbles present in the preparation need to be controlled necessarily.<br>
US 6,533,873 in particular discloses a shower gel formulation having a clear appearance<br>
which suspends insoluble particles, water insoluble liquids or bubbles and contains an<br>
acrylate copolymer, an anionic surfactant, a cationic polymer and, optionally, an amphoteric<br>
surfactant. The patent discloses several routes for the preparation of gels none of which is<br>
suitable for controlling the density of air bubbles. The products formed by following the<br>
disclosed methods contain suspended particles, which are rarely visible amongst a cluster of<br>
air bubbles. The air bubbles besides interfering in the filling operations of the final<br>
formulation make it look unsightly and unappealing to the onlookers.<br>
Hence there remains a need for gel products, which comprise suspended particles and are<br>
typically devoid of suspended air bubbles. Also there remains a need for a process by which<br>
gel products devoid of suspended air bubbles may be prepared. The need also remains for a<br>
process by which the density of air present in a gel preparation can be controlled.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention a process for the preparation of personal<br>
cleansing gel composition is disclosed. The process comprises the following steps:<br>
a) preparing a solution comprising a chelating agent, a humectant and a hot diluent;<br>
b) heating the solution to a temperature below 100°C and adding a neutralizer and at<br>
least one of a surfactant, a conditioner, or a combination thereof, to provide a<br>
transparent mass;<br>
c) adding to the transparent mass a UV absorber and a colorant followed by de-aeration<br>
to provide a de-aerated mass;<br>
d) adding a solution of rheology modifier to the de-aerated mass to provide a thickened<br>
solution;<br>
e) cooling the thickened solution and<br>
f) optionally adding at least one of preservatives, fragrances, emotive ingredients,<br>
solubilizers, active ingredients, free-radical scavengers and antioxidants to provide<br>
the personal cleansing gel composition.<br>
wherein the rheology modifier is added after the addition of neutralizer and under<br>
continued de-aeration conditions<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention meets the above mentioned needs and other needs by providing a<br>
method to control the density of air bubbles present in a personal cleansing gel composition<br>
for skin and/or hair. In one of its embodiments the invention provides a process of<br>
preparation of a transparent personal cleansing gel composition containing suspended<br>
particles and typically devoid of any air bubbles. The invention provides a process for<br>
preparation of personal cleansing gel composition with enhanced aesthetic appeal.<br>
Firstly, a clear solution of chelating agents is made in hot diluent solution. Thereafter<br>
humectant is added to the mixture and it is reheated to a temperature below 100°C. To this<br>
mixture anionic surfactant, neutralizer, amphoteric surfactant, non-ionic surfactant, and<br>
conditioners are added sequentially to obtain a clear transparent mass. To this transparent<br>
mass a solution of neutralized UV absorber and thereafter colourant is added. The solution is<br>
de-aerated and temperature is maintained below 100°C. To the de-aerated mixture, a solution<br>
of rheology modifier is added to form a thickened solution. De-aeration is continued. The<br>
thickened solution is cooled and fragrances, preservatives, conditioners, active ingredients<br>
and emotive ingredients are added to obtain the personal cleansing gel formulation.<br>
Gel formulations prepared by following the disclosed sequence of the instant invention<br>
exhibit a conspicuous absence of air bubbles. The difference is striking when compared to<br>
personal cleansing gel formulations known in the prior art where a muddled mass of air<br>
bubbles appeared inadvertently. Owing to the absence of air bubbles an improvement in the<br>
flow-ability characters of the formulation is achieved. Further it is also noted that the filling<br>
procedures of the formulation becomes effortless at the time of final packing and dispensing.<br>
This is a much-desired attribute while carrying out the packaging of gel formulations in<br>
greater volumes.<br>
It has also been noted that the process steps for preparation of gel preparations are significant<br>
for the aesthetics of the final formulation. Thus depending upon the accuracy of the process<br>
used, a given set of ingredients may provide a bubble-free or bubbled formulation. Even<br>
slight departures from the process steps of the instant invention leads to the presence of air-<br>
bubbles in the final formulation. For instance when the steps of addition of neutralizer and<br>
rheology modifier are interchanged, the bubbles reappear, as in the process stated hereunder.<br>
Hot water is added to a mixer followed by a premixed clear solution of EDTA-TS/EDTA -<br>
DS powder, commonly known as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and hot water. Thereafter<br>
glycerin is added to the mix. The solution is heated to temperature below 100°C. Thereafter<br>
SLES, also known as sodium lauryl ether sulphate, (m(EO) of 1 to 20) is added to main<br>
mixer and mixed thoroughly. To this TEA, also known as triethanolamine, premixed with<br>
water is added and mixed. Thereafter, acrylate copolymer is added to main mixer and mixed<br>
thoroughly for at least 15 minutes. Vacuum is applied and the mixture is cooled to about<br>
50°C. Then cocoamido propyl betaine (CAPB) and alkyl glucoside are added to main mixer<br>
one by one and mixed thoroughly. This is followed by the addition of PEG/ PPG -8/ 3<br>
Diisostearate to main mixer and mixed thoroughly until a clear transparent mass is formed.<br>
To the transparent mass Benzophenone-4 premixed with water and TEA is added and mixed<br>
thoroughly. Colour premixed with water is then added to main mixer and mixed thoroughly.<br>
The solution is thereafter cooled with cooling water/chilled to bring down the temperature to<br>
40°C. Fragrance premixed with PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil and extracts are thereafter<br>
added followed by DMDM Hydantoin. The resultant formulation is allowed to cool to room<br>
temperature.<br>
The invention has herewith been described in further details with its various embodiments<br>

Process for preparation:<br>
Hot water is added to a mixer followed by a premixed clear solution of EDTA-TS/EDTA -<br>
DS powder and hot water. Thereafter glycerin is added to the mix. The solution is heated to<br>
temperature below 100°C. Thereafter SLES (m(EO) of 1 to 20) is added to main mixer and<br>
mixed thoroughly. To this TEA premixed with water is added and mixed. Thereafter, CAPB<br>
is added to main mixer and mixed thoroughly. Then alkyl glucoside is added to main mixer<br>
and mixed thoroughly. This is followed by the addition of PEG/ PPG -8/ 3 Diisostearate to<br>
main mixer and mixed thoroughly until a clear transparent mass is formed. To the transparent<br>
mass Benzophenone-4 premixed with water and TEA is added and mixed thoroughly. Colour<br>
premixed with water is then added to main mixer and mixed thoroughly. Vacuum is applied<br>
and maintained at 100 - 400 mmHg till the entire mass is completely clear of any aeration to<br>
get completely de-aerated mass. Temperature of the solution is maintained belowl00°C and<br>
acrylate copolymer premixed with water is added to the de-aerated mass to get a thickened<br>
solution. The transfer is typically free of air-bubble. Mixing is continued under 100 - 400<br>
mmHg vacuum for about 1 - 60 minutes till the entire thickened solution is clear of any<br>
aeration. The solution is thereafter cooled with cooling water/chilled under continuous<br>
vacuum to bring down the temperature to 40°C. Fragrance premixed with PEG-40<br>
Hydrogenated Castor Oil and extracts are thereafter added followed by DMDM Hydantoin.<br>
The resultant formulation is allowed to cool to room temperature to provide the personal<br>
cleansing gel composition.<br>
On visual examination no air bubbles are found in the formulation prepared by method stated<br>
in the instant invention.<br>
Example 5 : Consequence of altering the sequence of addition of neutralizer and rheology<br>
modifier<br>
Hot water is added to a mixer followed by a premixed clear solution of EDTA-TS/EDTA -<br>
DS powder, commonly known as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and hot water. Thereafter<br>
glycerin is added to the mix. The solution is heated to temperature below 100°C. Thereafter<br>
SLES, also known as sodium lauryl ether sulphate, (m(EO) of 1 to 20) is added to main<br>
mixer and mixed thoroughly. To this TEA, also known as triethanolamine, premixed with<br>
water is added and mixed. Thereafter, acrylate copolymer is added to main mixer and mixed<br>
thoroughly for at least 15 minutes. Vacuum is applied and the mixture is cooled to about<br>
50°C. Then cocoamido propyl betaine (CAPB) and alkyl glucoside are added to main mixer<br>
one by one and mixed thoroughly. This is followed by the addition of PEG/ PPG -8/ 3<br>
Diisostearate to main mixer and mixed thoroughly until a clear transparent mass is formed.<br>
To the transparent mass Benzophenone - 4 premixed with water and TEA is added and mixed<br>
thoroughly. Colour premixed with water is then added to main mixer and mixed thoroughly.<br>
The solution is thereafter cooled with cooling water/chilled to bring down the temperature to<br>
40°C. Fragrance premixed with PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil and extracts are thereafter<br>
added followed by DMDM Hydantoin. The resultant formulation is allowed to cool to room<br>
temperature.<br>
On visual inspection air bubbles were seen<br>
It was thus found that if the sequence of addition of ingredients in particular that of the<br>
neutralizer and rheology modifiers is altered or reversed, air bubbles reappeared even though<br>
all the ingredients and other process conditions are maintained.<br>
Other variations as may be obvious to one skilled in the art may be made in compounds,<br>
compositions, and methods described herein without departing from the essential features of<br>
the invention and therefore must be held non restrictive to the scope of the instant invention.<br>
The embodiments of the invention specifically illustrated herein are exemplary only and may<br>
not in any way be intended as limitations in its scope.<br>
