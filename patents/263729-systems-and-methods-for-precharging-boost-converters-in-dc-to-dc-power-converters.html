				<td>SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PRECHARGING BOOST<br>
CONVERTERS IN DC TO DC POWER CONVERTERS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for<br>
precharging boost converters in DC to DC power converters, and more<br>
particularly relates to systems and methods for precharging boost converters in<br>
DC to DC power converters that reduce the rate of precharge if the voltage<br>
source (e.g., a battery) falls below a predetermined threshold.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] DC to DC power converters are utilized in a number of different<br>
electronic devices to boost one DC voltage level to another. One exemplary<br>
use is in electric or hybrid automobiles. A DC to DC power converter can be<br>
utilized to drive a 320 volt bus from a 12 volt battery, which can be<br>
particularly useful to start an electric automobile. While conventional DC to<br>
DC power converters have been suitable for boosting the charge of a fully-<br>
charged battery to the necessary voltage, conventional DC to DC power<br>
converters can cause problems in a system in which a battery that is not fully<br>
charged. If the voltage of the battery in an electric automobile drops below a<br>
threshold value, it may be difficult to start the vehicle.<br>
[0003] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide systems and methods for<br>
precharging boost converters in DC to DC power converter systems that<br>
reduce the rate of precharge in order to prevent the voltage of a voltage source<br>
from dropping below a threshold value. Furthermore, other desirable features<br>
and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the<br>
subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and<br>
background.<br><br>

of the current to the predetermined current limit. The system includes a<br>
microprocessor coupled to the precharge controller and the boost converter,<br>
the microprocessor configured to monitor the input voltage, provide the<br>
current limit to the precharge controller, and to increase the current limit when<br>
the input voltage is above a predetermined value.<br>

of the depicted subject matter.<br>
[0016] FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of a DC to DC power<br>
converter system 100 for boosting an input voltage VIN to an output voltage<br>
VOUT in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The system 100 includes a microprocessor 102, a precharge controller 108<br>
coupled to the microprocessor 102, and a boost converter circuit 114 coupled<br>
to the precharge controller 108. Ignoring for a moment a monitoring of VIN by<br>
the microprocessor shown in FIG. 1, the microprocessor 102 provides a<br>
control signal (ILIMIT) to the precharge controller 108.<br>
[0017] The precharge controller 108 receives ILIMIT and, in response<br>
thereto, provides signals for controlling a first switch (SI) 216 (FIG. 4) and a<br>
second switch (SI) 218 (FIG. 4) in the boost converter circuit 114. As<br>
discussed in further detail below, the input voltage VIN is boosted to the output<br>
voltage VOUT input voltage VIN as a result of the manipulation of the switches<br>
216, 218 (FIG. 4) by the precharge controller 108 The voltage source (not<br>
shown) that provides VIN can be, for example, an automobile battery.<br>
Generally, the switches 216, 218 (FIG. 4) are controlled such that the current<br>
in the boost converter circuit 114 does not exceed ILIMIT<br><br>
[0018] FIG. 2 is a more detailed view of the exemplary precharge<br>
controller 108 utilized in the system of FIG. 1. FIG. 2 is described in<br>
association with FIG. 3, which is an exemplary motor start up timing diagram<br>
for the precharge controller 108.<br>
[0019] The precharge controller 108 includes a boost control circuit 310<br>
coupled to first and second switch drive elements 306 and 308. The boost<br>
control circuit 310 is coupled to switch drive elements 306 and 308, which in<br>
turn provide switching signals SI and S2 to switches 216 and 218 in the boost<br>
converter circuit 114 (FIG. 4). As discussed in further detail below, turning<br>
the first and second switches 216 and 218 on and off in the boost converter<br>
circuit 114 boosts the output voltage VOUT, and the rate at which the output<br>
voltage VOUT increases is referred to as the "boost rate."<br>
[0020] The precharge controller 108 additionally includes a comparator<br>
302 having an output coupled to a delay (D) type flip flop circuit 304. ILIMIT<br>
and a measured ramp current (IL1) (see FIG. 4) from the boost converter<br>
circuit 114 are coupled to inputs of comparator 302, and the output of<br>
comparator 302 is coupled to an input of D flip flop 304. D flip flop 304 also<br>
receives a clock signal (CLK in FIG. 3) from an oscillator in boost control<br>
circuit 310. The output of D flip flop 304 (En in FIG. 3) is coupled to the<br>
inputs of switch drive elements 306 and 308. As shown in FIG. 3, during<br>
operation, when the ramp current ILi reaches ILIMIT, the enable signals from D<br>
flip flop 304 are turned off, and as a result, both switches SI and S2 and<br>
turned off. This results in the ramp current ILI in the boost converter circuit<br>
114 going to zero. Thereafter, CLK signal from boost control circuit 310<br>
resets the D flip flop 304, and the enable signals are turned back on and the<br>
first and second switches 216 and 218 begin switching again. This process is<br>
repeated to boost the output voltage VOUT.<br>
[0021] FIG. 4 is a more detailed view of the exemplary isolated boost<br>
converter circuit 114 utilized in the system of FIG. 1. Input voltage VIN is<br>
applied across a first node 250 and a second node 252. A first terminal of a<br>
first capacitor 204 is coupled to node 250, and a second terminal of the<br><br>
capacitor 206 is coupled to node 252. Node 250 is additionally coupled to a<br>
third node 254. One terminal of a first inductor 210 is coupled between node<br>
254, and a second terminal is connected to a fourth node 256, which in turn, is<br>
coupled to a primary winding of a transformer 212. A second inductor 214 is<br>
coupled between node 254 and a fifth node 258, which in turn is coupled to<br>
the primary winding of the transformer 212.<br>
[0022] Switch 216 has a first terminal coupled to node 256, and a second<br>
terminal coupled to a sixth node 260, which in turn is coupled to node 252. In<br>
this embodiment, switch 216 may be a MOSFET transistor having a source<br>
coupled to node 260, and a drain coupled to node 256. A gate of this transistor<br>
is coupled to receive the control signal SI from the precharge controller 108<br>
(FIGS. 1 and 2). Second switch 218 has a first terminal coupled to node 258<br>
and a second terminal coupled to node 232. In this embodiment, second<br>
switch 218 may be a MOSFET transistor having a source coupled to a sixth<br>
node 260 and a drain coupled to node 258. A gate of this transistor is coupled<br>
to receive control signal S2 from the precharge controller 108 (FIGS. 1 and 2).<br>
A secondary winding of the first transformer 212 is coupled to a rectifier<br>
circuit 222. Output voltage VOUT applies across a second capacitor 224 (nodes<br>
262 and 264).<br>
[0023] The operation of the isolated boost control circuit 114 will now be<br>
described during both normal and precharge operations. Output voltage VOUT<br>
across the capacitor 224 may be, for example, about 300 volts. If the<br>
transformer 212 is a 6:1 transformer, the 300 volts on the secondary winding<br>
of the transformer 212 will be approximately 50 volts on the primary winding<br>
of the transformer 212 and on the first and second inductors 210 and 214.<br>
During normal operation, both the first and second switches 216 and 218 are<br>
on and the voltage on the primary winding of the transformer 212 will be<br>
virtually zero. During this time, current in both the first and second inductors<br>
210 and 214 will start to ramp up. If switch 216 is off, the current to the first<br>
inductor 210 cannot go to ground and instead goes through the transformer<br>
212. During this time, the voltage across first inductor 210 is approximately<br><br>
50 volts at node 256 and only approximately 14 volts at node 254. The<br>
voltage across inductor 210 increases to approximately 36 volts in order to<br>
forward bias the rectifier circuit 222 and provide current to capacitor 224.<br>
This results in the rate of the ramping up of current on the first inductor 210 to<br>
decrease. When the first switch 216 is on again, the rate increases again.<br>
[0024] Similarly, when the second switch 218 is off, the current in<br>
inductor 214 starts flowing through transformer 212 and though the first<br>
switch 216 to ground. During this time, inductor 214 has applied<br>
approximately 14 volts at node 254 and approximately 50 volts at node 258.<br>
The voltage across inductor 214 increases to approximately 36 volts and, as a<br>
result, discharges into capacitor 224. This causes a rate of the ramping up of<br>
the current on inductor 214 to decrease. Switch 216 is turned on again, and<br>
the rate increases again. Accordingly, the process of turning the first and<br>
second switches 216 and 218 on and off results in boosting the charge stored<br>
on capacitor 224 (VOUT)-<br>
[0025] During precharge condition, there is essentially no voltage stored<br>
on capacitor 224. Switches 216 and 218 are turned on, which causes the<br>
current in the first and second inductors 210 and 214 to ramp up. However,<br>
when switch 216 is turned off, there is virtually no voltage across transformer<br>
212. Some charge is transferred through transformer 212 and rectifier circuit<br>
222, and into capacitor 224, typically in the order of 0.5 to 1 volts. The<br>
current in inductors 210 and 214 continues to ramp up, even with the switch<br>
216 is off. When the current in inductors 210 and 214 reaches the ILIMIT, both<br>
switches 216 and 218 are turned off, which forces the current towards zero<br>
(see also, FIGS. 3 and 4).<br>
[0026] Switches 216 and 218 are then turned on again and current begins<br>
to rise in the inductors 210 and 214. At this point, some charge remains in<br>
capacitor 224 that produces at least some voltage. The process is repeated<br>
until the voltage across capacitor 224 is sufficient to keep the voltage across<br>
inductors 210 and 214 from becoming too high.<br><br>
[0027] FIG. 5 illustrates the relationship between the input voltage VIN and<br>
the ILIMIT. AS ILIMIT increases, the input voltage VIN decreases. As discussed<br>
above in reference to FIG. 3, ILIMIT affects the boost rate of the output voltage<br>
VOUT (and as a result, the depletion rate of the voltage source providing VIN)<br>
by dictating the frequency at which the switching signals SI and S2 that<br>
manipulate switches 216 and 218 are disabled. As noted above, the switching<br>
signals SI and S2 are disabled when the ramp current (IL1) exceeds IUMIT. As<br>
such, a higher ILIMIT results in a less frequent disabling of the switching signals<br>
SI and S2, an increased boost rate of the output voltage VOUT- and an<br>
increased depletion rate of the input voltage VIN. Conversely, a lower IUMIT<br>
results in a more frequent disabling of the switching signals SI and S2, a<br>
decreased boost rate of the output voltage VOUT, and a decreased depletion rate<br>
of the input voltage VIN.<br>
[0028] As noted above in reference to FIG. 1, the microprocessor 102<br>
monitors the input voltage VIN and provides the ILIMIT to the precharge<br>
controller 108. The microprocessor 102 selects a relatively low initial ILIMIT,<br>
and thereafter, increases the ILIMIT- In one embodiment, the ILIMIT is increased<br>
in a linear manner, although the IUMIT can be increased in any suitable manner.<br>
The microprocessor 102 allows ILIMIT to increase so long as the input voltage<br>
VIN does not drop below a predetermined threshold. The threshold of the<br>
input voltage VIN can be, for example, nine volts. When microprocessor<br>
determines that the input voltage VIN reaches the predetermined threshold<br>
(labeled voltage limit in FIG. 5), the microprocessor 102 halts further increase<br>
of the IUMIT (line 504) or decreases the ILIMIT (line 502). This enables an<br>
optimal ILIMIT that provides a more efficient precharge of the boost converter<br>
circuit 114 while preventing depletion of the voltage source.<br>
[0029] This may eliminate the need for a fast control voltage loop, or other<br>
types of dedicated additional components to monitor VIN and adjust ILIMIT-<br>
Moreover, this may reduce the demand on the microprocessor 102 since, while<br>
the ILIMIT is increasing relatively slowly, the rate of change of the input voltage<br>
VIN is limited. As such, the set of instructions in the microprocessor 102 can<br><br>
be executed less frequently and still maintain adequate control of the input<br>
voltage VIN.<br>
