Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to seamless reproduction of multi-angle data, and more particularly, to an apparatus and method for guaranteeing seamless reproduction of multi-angle data, even during a change of angle, and an information storage medium on which the multi-angle data is recorded.<br>
Background of invention<br>
Data obtained by photographing a scene at various angles and encoding the result is called multi-angle data. While a viewer watches a scene by reproducing contents containing the multi-angle data, if the viewer wants to see the scene photographed at a different angle, the viewer inputs an angle change command to a reproducing apparatus. After receiving the command, the reproducing apparatus reproduces data for a new angle. fo guarantee seamless reproduction during angle change, the multi-angle data is stored using an interleaving method in which the multi-angle data is divided into units having a specified size and the units are recorded in an alternating fashion. To search for and reproduce data blocks for one angle in the interleaved multi-angle data, additional information for tracing data blocks by angles is recorded within a video bit stream.<br>
Arrival time information, such as an arrival time stamp (ATS), is added to each angle data of the multi-angle data. When an angle data is reproduced, it is output and reproduced according to the ATS. In general, since an independent ATS is added to the angle data, seamless reproduction (i.e., without pause), cannot be ensured during change of angle.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVETION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is for continuously reproducing multi-angle data, even during a change of angle from an information storage medium. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for reproducing data from an information storage medium.<br><br>

Additional and/or other aspects and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below in order to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram of an angle block in which multi-angle data is stored. Referring to FIG. 1, an angle block 100 is constructed such that a plurality of cells are arranged in parallel. These cells can be reproduced only one at a time by a user's selection. The cells that form the angle block have the same reproduction time and correspond to a specific angle. If the cells, which are units of reproduction, form an angle block, data for a specific angle is divided into interleaved units (ILVUs) and recorded on video objects (VOBs), which are recording units, and cells, which are recording units, using the interleaving method.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram of angle data and used for explaining a process of receiving an angle change command, and jumping to another angle data.<br>
Each angle data comprises ILVUs. The maximum number of angles supported by a Digital Video Disc (DVD) is nine. Referring to FIG. 2, first angle data is AGL_C #1210,<br><br>
second angle data is AGL_C #2 220, . . . ninth angle data is AGL_C #9 230. To reproduce the first or ninth angle data while the second angle data AGL_C #2 220 is being reproduced, a jump is made to a pertinent ILVU of the first or ninth angle data. To seamlessly reproduce video data even if a user issues a command to change angles at a certain time during reproduction of an ILVU of the second angle data, it is necessary to complete reproduction of the currently reproduced ILVU of the second angle data and then jump to the desired ILVU of the first or ninth angle data.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an apparatus for reproducing a motion picture experts group (MPEG)-2 transport stream (TS) from a storage medium.<br>
A reading unit 310 reads AV data from a storage medium 305 on which the AV data is stored in the form of an MPEG-2 TS. A read buffer 320 temporarily stores the data at a read data rate R.sub.ud. A source de-packetizer 330 reads the data stored in the read buffer 320 at a read data rate R.sub.max of the read buffer 320, removes an arrival time stamp (ATS) from the data, and outputs the data in the form of MPEG-2 TS packets. A decoder 340 decodes an MPEG-2 TS according to a presentation time stamp (PTS) contained in the MPEG-2 TS packets, and displays the result on a display unit 350.<br>
The AV data recorded on the storage medium 305 is packet data formed by coding audio or video data and breaking it up into packets having a specified size according to a specified transmission method. For example, if the data is transmitted in the form of the MPEG-2 TS according to ISO/IEC 13818-1 standards, the specified size of the packets is 188 bytes. As a further example, if the data is transmitted using an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) method, the specified size of the packets is 53 bytes. The packet data may be   transmitted   over,   for   example,   a   cable   or   a   local   area   network   (LAN).<br>
When the packet data is transmitted in digital broadcasting, transmission time intervals between the packet data are not constant. That is, a transmitter transmits the packet data at appropriate time intervals considering a buffering state of a receiver, and the receiver decodes and displays the packet data immediately after receiving the packet data.<br><br>
However, when the packet data is recorded on a storage medium, it is inefficient to store it at the transmission time intervals. Accordingly, transmission time information is added to the packet data. The inconstant time intervals at which the packet data is transmitted are important when the stored packet data is output to the decoder. This is because a buffer of the receiver overflows or underflows if the packet data is transmitted to the decoder regardless of the transmission time information. Accordingly, a transmission system is constructed such that the transmitter adjusts the time intervals between the packet data considering the state of the buffer in the receiver and transmits the packet data at the adjusted time intervals.<br>
If the packet data is stored on the storage medium, not in the transmission system, it is necessary to add arrival time information to all the packets and output the packets to the reproducing apparatus according to the information. To this end, the reproducing apparatus includes a clock generator 360 which generates a clock of a specified frequency. The clock generator 360 generates clock signals at, by way of non-limiting example, 27 MHz. The reproducing apparatus also includes a counter 370 which counts the clock signals, e.g., 27 MHz clock signals, generated by the clock generator 360. The counter 370 receives an initial counter value from the source de-packetizer 330 to set an initial value, and then, counts the 27 MHz clock signals and transmits arrival time information to the source de-packetizer 330.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram of clips for angles.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, information about jump points is contained in clip information. Jump points located at the same positions have the same PTS value. To continuously (i.e., seemlessly) reproduce video data, even during a change of angle, the decoder 330 reads and decodes data for a desired angle having the same time as data for a current angle, with reference to the PTS value contained in the MPEG-2 TS, and displays the decoded data through the display unit 350.<br>
The jump points have position information about data for a first angle for a second angle. Additional information regarding intervals and positions of the jump points is recorded in<br><br>
a separate space of the storage medium and is used for searching for a new position of data to be reproduced by performing a seamless reproduction process during a change of angle. Clips which should be reproduced at the same time have the same PTS value. Thus, arrival time information of packets input from the source de-packetizer to the decoder  allows  seemless  reproduction  of video  data during  a  change  of angle.<br>
That is, to continuously reproduce AV data, even during a change of angle, ATC values as well as STC values are consistently maintained. When a user changes angles and a new clip is input from the read buffer to the source de-packetizer, the reproducing apparatus does not reset a counter for an arrival time clock with reference to a first ATS value of the newly read clip. If the counter is reset with reference to the first ATS value of the new clip, a discontinuity occurs in the ATC and the MPEG-2 TS data input to a buffer in the decoder underflows or overflows, and seamless reproduction is not assured.<br>
Accordingly, the packet data for angles in the packet data structure for seamless reproduction have appropriate ATS values, and even if the packet data is changed, the reproducing apparatus does not reset the counter and continuously operates according to a preset ATC.<br>
A clip of data for one angle comprises several small ILVUs. In the case where there are clips for many angles of one scene, the clips are recorded in an interleaved manner. In this case, an ILVU is a unit of jumping, and a starting point of each ILVU is called a jump point. To reproduce a clip for one angle, a jump is made to an ILVU of the angle. The jump point is used to search for a subsequent ILVU after completion of reproduction of the  current  ILVU.  The jump point  is  also  used during  a  change  of angle.<br>
The jump point information about clips which are reproduced at the same time has the same PTS value and the same ATS value so as to prevent discontinuity. It is also possible that the jump point information has a value between the same ATS value and an ATS value of a subsequent jump point to achieve seamless reproduction.<br><br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating a decoding process according to an ATC and an STC during a seamless change of angle.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, even though the angle is changed during AV data reproduction, a continuous decoding process is performed without causing discontinuity in the ATC and STC. That is, even when a new clip is input in the reproducing apparatus of FIG. 3, the counter is not reset with reference to ATS and STC values of the new clip. In order for the reproducing apparatus to continuously reproduce the video, the same jump points must have the same PTS values. To this end, an ATS value of a packet to which a jump needs to be made should be equal to an ATS value of a first TS packet, or a value between the ATS value of the first packet and the ATS value of the next jump point.<br>
As described above, the apparatus and method according to the present invention can seemlessly reproduce multi-angle data by first completing the reproduction of angle data photographed at one angle, changing the angle, and reproducing angle data photographed at the new angle.<br>
