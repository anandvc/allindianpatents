Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of speech coding and decoding<br>
technologies, and in particular, to a method and apparatus for pitch search.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Generally, speech and audio signals are somewhat periodic. The long-term<br>
periodicity in the speech and audio signals may be removed through a Long Term<br>
Prediction (LTP) method. Before LTP prediction, a pitch needs to be searched out first. A<br>
conventional method for pitch search is performed based on an autocorrelation function.<br>
In a Moving Pictures Experts Group Audio Lossless Coding (MPEG ALS) apparatus, the<br>
history data in the buffer is used as excitation signals to predict the signals of the current<br>
frame. Taking the open loop pitch analysis as an example, the method is described below.<br>
First, the original speech signal is input into a perceptual weighting filter to obtain<br>
a weighted speech signal sw(n) ¦ The expression of perceptual weighting filter function is<br>
 and pi = 0.68. For each subframe,<br>
the subframe length (L) is 64, and the expression of the weighted speech signal sw(n)<br>
is:<br>
where s(n) is the original speech signal; a' is an LP coefficient; and ft is a<br>
perceptual weighting factor.<br>
A four-order Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter Hdedm2(z) performs<br>
down-sampling by 2 on the weighted speech signal to obtain Swd'"'; the weighted<br>
correlation function is:<br>
 (2)<br>
The obtained pitch is the pitch delay d that maximizes C(d), where w(d) is a<br>
weighting function that includes a low-delay weighting function w'^ ' and a<br>
previous-frame delay weighting function "^ ', as shown in formula (3):<br>
w{d)=wl(d)wn(d) (3)<br>
The expression of the low-delay weighting function w'^ ' is:<br>
wl(d) = cw(d) (4)<br>
where cw(d) exists in the tab file of the program, and the previous-frame delay<br>
weighting function w" ^ ' depends on the pitch delay of the previous frame, and the<br>
expression of the previous-frame delay weighting function W"^ ' is:<br>
 (5)<br>
T<br>
where, °,d is the average of the pitch delay in the first 5 frames, and v is an<br>
adaptive factor. When the open loop pitch gain (g) is greater than 0.6, the frame is<br>
regarded as a voiced frame, and "v" for the next frame is set to 1; otherwise, v = 0.9v. The<br>
expression of the open loop pitch gain (g) is:<br>
 (6)<br>
The pitch delay is the one that maximizes C(d). The mid value filter is updated in<br>
the voiced frames. If the previous frame includes an unvoiced or silent sound, the<br>
weighting function is attenuated by parameter "v".<br>
As described above, in the prior art, to solve the long-term periodicity, an<br>
autocorrelation function is calculated for the input speech signals in a frame to obtain the<br>
pitch.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
The present invention is hereinafter described in detail with reference to<br>
accompanying drawings and exemplary embodiments.<br>
FIG. 1 is a flowchart of a method for pitch search according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The method includes the following steps:<br>
Step 101: Obtain a characteristic function value of a residual signal, where the<br>
residual signal is a result of removing an LTP contribution signal from input speech<br>
signals.<br>
Step 102: Obtain a pitch according to the characteristic function value of the<br>
residual signal.<br>
In the method according to this embodiment, obtain the characteristic function<br>
value of the residual signal, and the pitch is obtained according to the characteristic<br>
function value of the residual signal, without calculating the correlation function values<br>
of the input speech signals in the entire frame.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flowchart of a method for pitch search according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The method includes the following steps:<br>
Step 201: Preprocess the input speech signals.<br>
The preprocessing may be low-pass filtering or down-sampling, or may be a<br>
low-pass filtering process followed by a down-sampling process. In one embodiment, the<br>
low-pass filtering may be mean-value filtering. Taking a Pulse Coded Modulation (PCM)<br>
signal as an example, y(n) represents an input speech signal, and the frame length L of<br>
the input speech signal is 160 (that is, one frame includes 160 samples); y2(n) represents<br>
the down-sampled, and is hereinafter referred to as a down-sampled signal. Taking the<br>
down-sampling by 2 as an example in this embodiment, the following equation applies:<br>
 (7)<br>
where, M is the order of the mean filter, and the sample range of y2(n) is [0,<br>
79].<br>
This step is optional. The preprocessing may be omitted before step 202 occurs.<br>
Step 202: Search the input speech signals for a pulse with the maximum<br>
amplitude.<br>
The pulse may be searched within the entire frame, or within a set range of a<br>
frame. Taking searching for the pulse in a set range of a frame as an example, the process<br>
is detailed below:<br>
First, for the input speech signal y(n), its pitch range is pre-set according to the<br>
frame length. The pitch range is set with reference to the frame length, and the pitch<br>
should not be too high. If the pitch is too high, few samples in the signals of a frame are<br>
involved in the LTP calculation, and the LTP performance is degraded. For example, if<br>
the frame length L equals to 160, the pitch range of y(n) may be set to [20, 83].<br>
According to one embodiment, down-sampling by 2 is applied in step 202. The pitch<br>
range of the down-sampled signal y2(n) may be [10, 41], namely, [PMIN, PMAX], where<br>
PMIN = 10, and PMAX = 41. To ensure that the pitch can be found when the pitch is the<br>
maximum, the sample range of the pulse being searched may be set to [41, 79].<br>
Afterward, within the sample range [41, 79], the pulse with the maximum<br>
amplitude in the y2(n) is found. Supposing pO is the sample corresponding to the pulse<br>
with the maximum amplitude (41 
abs(y2(p0)) &gt; abs(y2(n)% n e [PMAX, --\],n*p0 (8)<br>
In this embodiment, the amplitude of y2(n) may be a real number, and the<br>
amplitude value of y2(n) is the absolute value of y2(n), and is a non-negative number.<br>
Step 203: Set a target window according to the position of the pulse pO with the<br>
maximum amplitude in the input speech signals.<br>
Specifically, a target window is added around the pulse pO to select parts of the<br>
signals, and this target window covers the pulse pO. The range of the target window is<br>
[smint smax^ and me target window length is len = smax- smin . Tne range of "len"<br>
is [1,L]. That is, the target window may cover all the signals of the frame.<br>
For example, s min = j _ max(p0 - d,41), s max = s _ m\n(pO + d,79), where d is<br>
used to limit the length of the target window. In this embodiment, d=15.<br>
s_max(p0-d,4l) refers to obtaining the greater value between Pv~" an£j 41,<br>
s _ min(&gt;0 + d,19) refers tQ obtaining the smaller value between P° + d and 79.<br>
Step 204: Calculate the residual signal of the input speech signal (namely, a<br>
down-sampled signal in this embodiment) corresponding to each pitch in the preset pitch<br>
range, and the residual signal is a result of removing an LTP contribution signal from the<br>
input speech signal, where the LTP contribution signal xk (/') is determined according to<br>
the LTP excitation signal and the pitch gain:<br>
 (9)<br>
where ^ represents a pitch, and g represents the pitch gain, g may be a fixed<br>
empirical value, or may be a value determined adaptively according to the pitch in the<br>
preset pitch range. That is, different pitches (k) may have the same g. Alternatively, a<br>
table of mapping between the pitch k and the pitch gain g may be preset, where g varies<br>
with k.<br>
Step 205: Calculate the energy of the residual signal corresponding to each pitch.<br>
 (10)<br>
where l^i'^J represents the pitch range. In one embodiment, Ai=10; 2 =41; and<br>
*"' represents the energy of the residual signal corresponding to ^.<br>
Step 206: Select the minimum value E(P) among the calculated residual signal<br>
energy values, and E(P) is the minimum residual signal energy of the down-sampled<br>
signal y2(n) corresponding to the pitch P within the range "- ' 2 J.<br>
Step 207: Obtain the pitch for y(n), and this pitch is 2P because y2(n) is obtained<br>
from y(n) through down-sampling by 2.<br>
Further, to avoid mistaking the double pitch for the pitch, the method according to<br>
this embodiment may further include the following process after obtaining the pitch 2P.<br>
In the speech signal domain, the correlation function corresponding to the<br>
obtained pitch is calculated, and the correlation function of the double pitch is calculated.<br>
This step calculates the correlation function of 2P nor_cor[2P] and the correlation<br>
function of 2P, namely, nor_cor[P], according to the following equation:<br>
 (11)<br>
The pitch corresponding to the calculated maximum value of the correlation<br>
function is regarded as the final pitch. That is, the value of nor-cori^"l js compared<br>
with the value of ™r_cor[P] If nor_cor\2P}&gt;nor_cor[P]? 2p is used as the fina,<br>
pitch of the speech signal. If ™r _cor[2P] 
of the speech signal.<br>
This embodiment sets a target window and calculates the energy of the residual<br>
signals in a frame, without calculating the correlation function values of the signals in the<br>
entire frame, thus simplifying the pitch search greatly; moreover, this embodiment<br>
compares the correlation function of the pitch with the correlation function of the double<br>
pitch to avoid mistaking the double pitch for the pitch and ensure the accuracy of pitch<br>
search.<br>
FIG 3 is a flowchart of a method for pitch search according to yet another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment differs from the second<br>
embodiment in that: step 205 and step 206 are replaced with step 305 and step 306, and<br>
the characteristic function value of the residual signal in this embodiment is the sum of<br>
the absolute values of the residual signals, as detailed below:<br>
Step 305: Calculate the sum of the absolute values of the residual signals of the<br>
down-sampled signals corresponding to the pitches within the pitch range:<br>
 (12)<br>
where E(k) is the sum of the absolute values of the residual signals corresponding<br>
to *.<br>
Step 306: In the calculated sums of absolute values of residual signals, select the<br>
minimum sum E(P), which is the minimum sum of absolute values of residual signals<br>
of down-sampled signals corresponding to pitch P within the range L*i&gt; ^ J.<br>
This embodiment sets a target window to calculate the sum of absolute values of<br>
residual signals of the signals in a frame, without calculating the correlation function<br>
values of the signals in the entire frame, thus simplifying the pitch search greatly.<br>
The second embodiment and the third embodiment are applicable to the scenario<br>
where the previous part of the signals in a frame is used to predict the last part of the<br>
signals in the frame. The present invention is not limited to this scenario, and is also<br>
applicable to the scenario where the signals of a previous frame are used to predict the<br>
signals of the current frame. In this scenario, the characteristic function values of the<br>
residual signals of the entire frame may be obtained first, and then the pitch is obtained<br>
according to the characteristic function values of the residual signals of the entire frame.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of method for pitch search according to yet another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The method includes the following steps:<br>
Step 401: Search the input speech signals for a pulse with the maximum<br>
amplitude.<br>
Step 402: Set a target window for the input speech signals according to the<br>
position of the pulse with the maximum amplitude.<br>
Step 403: Slide the target window to obtain a plurality of sliding windows,<br>
calculate the correlation coefficient of the input speech signals in each sliding window<br>
and in the target window, and obtain the maximum value of the correlation coefficients.<br>
Step 404: Obtain a pitch according to the maximum value of the correlation<br>
coefficients.<br>
This embodiment sets a target window, slides the target window, and calculates<br>
the correlation coefficient of the signals in each sliding window and in the target window<br>
to obtain the maximum value of the correlation coefficients, and obtains a pitch according<br>
to the maximum value of the correlation coefficients, without calculating the correlation<br>
function values of the input speech signals in the entire frame, thus simplifying the pitch<br>
search greatly.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of method for pitch search according to yet another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The method includes the following steps:<br>
Step 501: Preprocess the input speech signals.<br>
Further, the preprocessing may be low-pass filtering or down-sampling, or may be<br>
a low-pass filtering process followed by a down-sampling process. Specifically, the<br>
low-pass filtering may be mean-value filtering. Taking a PCM signal as an example, y(n)<br>
represents an input speech signal, and the frame length L of the input speech signal is 160<br>
(that is, one frame includes 160 samples); y2(n) represents the down-sampled input<br>
speech signal, and is hereinafter referred to as a down-sampled signal. Taking the<br>
down-sampling by 2 as an example in one embodiment, the following equation applies:<br>
 (13)<br>
where, M is the order of the mean filter, and the sample range of y2(n) is [0,<br>
79].<br>
This step is optional. The preprocessing may be omitted before step 502 occurs.<br>
Step 502: Search the input speech signals for a pulse with the maximum<br>
amplitude.<br>
The pulse may be searched out within the entire frame, or within a set range of a<br>
frame. Supposing the pulse is searched out in a set range of a frame, the process is<br>
detailed below:<br>
First, for the input speech signal y(n), its pitch range is pre-set according to the<br>
frame length. The pitch range is set with reference to the frame length, and the pitch<br>
should not be too high. If the pitch is too high, few samples in the signals of a frame are<br>
involved in the LTP calculation, and the LTP performance is degraded. For example, if<br>
the frame length L equals to 160, the pitch range of y(n) may set to [20, 83]. According to<br>
one embodiment, down-sampling by 2 is applied in step 202. The pitch range of the<br>
down-sampled signal y2(n) may be [10, 41], namely, [PMIN, PMAX], where PMIN = 10,<br>
and PMAX = 41. To ensure the pitch to be findable when the pitch is the maximum, the<br>
sample range of the pulse being searched may set to [41, 79].<br>
Afterward, within the sample range [41, 79], the pulse with the maximum<br>
amplitude in the y2(n) is found. Supposing pO is the sample corresponding to the pulse<br>
with the maximum amplitude (41 
abs(y2(p0)) &gt; abs{y2(n)),n e [PMAX,--X\,n* pO (14)<br>
In this embodiment, the amplitude of y2(n) may be a real number, and the<br>
amplitude value of y2(n) is the absolute value of y2(n), and is a non-negative number.<br>
Step 503: Set a target window for the input speech signals according to the<br>
position of the pulse pO with the maximum amplitude in the input speech signals.<br>
Specifically, a target window is added around the pulse pO to select parts of the<br>
signals, and this target window covers the pulse pO. The range of the target window is<br>
[smin&gt; smax]; ancj me target window length is len = smax-smin . The range of "len"<br>
is [1,L]. That is, the target window may cover all the signals of the frame.<br>
For example, s min = s __ max(/?0 - d,41), s max = s _ min(/?0 + d,79), where d is<br>
used to limit the length of the target window. In one embodiment, d=15.<br>
s_max(p0-d,4\) refers to obtaining the greater value between P^~d and 41.<br>
s _ min(/?0 + d,79) refers t0 obtaining the smaller value between P0 + d and 79.<br>
Step 504: Slide the target window to obtain a plurality of sliding windows, and<br>
calculate the correlation coefficient of the signals in each sliding window and in the target<br>
window.<br>
smax-l<br>
corr[k}= Yiy2(i)*y2(i-k),ks[kl,k2] (15)<br>
where * represents the pitch, and lA'^J represents the pitch range. In one<br>
embodiment, i = 10; *2 = 41; and corr\k\ represents the correlation coefficient<br>
corresponding to ^.<br>
Step 505: Select the maximum correlation coefficient corr\."\ among the<br>
calculated correlation coefficients, and corr\.P\ js the maximum correlation coefficient<br>
of the down-sampled signal corresponding to the pitch P within the range L^i'^J<br>
Step 506: Obtain the pitch for y(n), and this pitch is 2P because y2(n) is obtained<br>
from y(n) through down-sampling by 2.<br>
Further, to avoid mistaking the double pitch for the pitch, the method according to<br>
this embodiment may further include the following process after obtaining the pitch 2P:<br>
In the speech signal domain, the correlation function of the obtained pitch is<br>
calculated, and the correlation function of the double frequency of the obtained pitch is<br>
calculated. This step calculates the correlation function of 2P nor_cor[2P] and the<br>
correlation function of the double frequency (P) of 2P, namely, nor _cor[P], according<br>
to the following equation:<br>
 (16)<br>
The pitch corresponding to the calculated maximum value of the correlation<br>
function is used as the final pitch. That is, the value of nor_cor\.*-"\ js compared with<br>
the value of ™r _cor[P] Jf nor_cor[2P]&gt;nor_cor[P]^ 2p is use(J as the final pitch<br>
of the speech signal. If ™r _cor[2P]  pis usedasthe fina, pltchofthe<br>
speech signal.<br>
This embodiment sets a target window and slides the target window, calculates the<br>
correlation coefficient of the signals in each sliding window and in the target window;<br>
and obtains a pitch according to the maximum value of the correlation coefficients,<br>
without calculating the correlation function values of the signals in the entire frame, thus<br>
simplifying the pitch search greatly; moreover, this embodiment compares the correlation<br>
function of the pitch with the correlation function of the double pitch to avoid mistaking<br>
the double pitch for the pitch and ensure accuracy of pitch search.<br>
FIG 6 shows a schematic structural view of an apparatus for pitch search<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus includes: a<br>
characteristic value obtaining module 11, adapted to obtain a characteristic function value<br>
of a residual signal, where the residual signal is a result of removing an LTP contribution<br>
signal from input speech signals; and a pitch obtaining module 12, adapted to obtain a<br>
pitch according to the characteristic function value of the residual signal.<br>
Specifically, the characteristic value obtaining module 11 may calculate the<br>
characteristic function values of the residual signals of the entire frame. The characteristic<br>
value obtaining module 11 may include a target window unit 13 and a characteristic value<br>
obtaining unit 14. The target window unit 13 sets a target window for the input speech<br>
signals, and the characteristic value obtaining unit 14 obtains the characteristic values of<br>
the residual signals in the target window.<br>
Further, the apparatus according to this embodiment may include a searching<br>
module 15. The searching module 15 searches the input speech signals for a pulse with<br>
the maximum amplitude. The target window unit 13 sets a target window according to the<br>
position of the pulse with the maximum amplitude in the input speech signals.<br>
The apparatus according to this embodiment may further include a preprocessing<br>
module 16. The preprocessing module 16 preprocesses the input speech signals.<br>
Specifically, the preprocessing module 16 performs low-pass filtering or down-sampling<br>
processing, and transmits the preprocessed input speech signals to the target window unit<br>
13 and the characteristic value obtaining unit 14.<br>
The characteristic value obtaining module 11 may further include a first<br>
calculating unit and a second calculating unit. The first calculating unit calculates the<br>
residual signal corresponding to each pitch within the preset pitch range. The second<br>
calculating unit calculates the characteristic function value of the residual signal<br>
corresponding to each pitch, and obtains the minimum value of the characteristic function<br>
value. The pitch obtaining module 12 uses the pitch corresponding to the minimum value<br>
of the characteristic function value as the obtained pitch.<br>
This embodiment sets a target window to calculate the characteristic function<br>
values of the residual signals of the signals in a frame, without calculating the correlation<br>
function values of the signals in the entire frame, thus simplifying the pitch search<br>
greatly.<br>

the correlation coefficient of the signals in each sliding window and in the target window<br>
to obtain the maximum value of the correlation coefficients, and obtains a pitch according<br>
to the maximum value of the correlation coefficients, without calculating the correlation<br>
function values of the input speech signals in the entire frame, thus simplifying the pitch<br>
search greatly.<br>
