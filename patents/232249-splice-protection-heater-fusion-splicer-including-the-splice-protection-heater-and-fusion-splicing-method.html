				<td>SPLICE PROTECTION HEATER, FUSION SPLICER INCLUDING THE SPLICE PROTECTION HEATER, AND FUSION SPLICING METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]       The present invention relates to a splice protection heater for protecting a fusion spliced portion of an optical fiber by heat shrinking a protection sleeve covering the fusion spliced portion, a fusion splicer including the splice protection heater, and a fusion splicing method.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]        Fusion splicing of optical fibers is performed by heating and fusing abutting end portions of glass fibers that have been exposed by removing protective coatings on splicing ends of the optical fibers.    Since a part of the fusion spliced optical fiber where the glass fiber has been exposed is mechanically weak, it is necessary to protect the part with a protection sleeve.   The protection sleeve is usually configured by accommodating hot-melt adhesive resin and a tensile body (also referred to as a reinforcing rod) within a heat shrinkable tube that shrinks in the radial direction when heat is applied thereto (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 09-297243).<br>
[0003]       In general, when protecting a fusion spliced optical fiber, the fusion-spliced portion of the optical fiber is disposed in a housing part of a<br><br>
splice protection heater with a protective sleeve covering the portion.    Next, the heating element is switched ON, and then later switched OFF after heating the protection sleeve for a predetermined time, whereupon the fusion-spliced portion is removed from the splice protection heater.   The switch of the heating element is configured to be ON with a timing determined by an operator regardless of whether or not the fusion-spliced portion is in the splice protection heater.<br>
[0004]       However, a loss of time may be incurred, for example, if an operator forgets to turn the switch ON after having disposed a fusion-spliced portion in the splice protection heater.    Furthermore, a fusion-spliced portion may be broken or damaged if an operator removes the unprotected optical fiber from the splice protection heater after a fixed time without becoming aware that he has not turned the switch ON.    Moreover, a proper protection process may not be performed because of an insufficient actual heating time if the switch is turned ON before a fusion-spliced portion is disposed in the housing part of the splice protection heater.    An operator may forget to manually switch the heating element ON or OFF regardless of the care taken and an ON/OFF timing of the switch may not be uniform.<br>
[0005]        Furthermore, batch fusion splicing of a plurality of optical fibers and batch protection processing of the plurality of optical fibers are known (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 02-72305).    In this case, although respective fusion spliced portions are disposed in separate channels provided on the heating platform of the splice<br><br>
protection heater, the heating element is turned ON with a switch to thermally protect the plurality of fusion-spliced portions in a batch.    This arrangement cannot be applied, therefore, if different types of protection sleeves that require different heating times for processing are used.    In addition, once the switch of the heating element is turned ON, protection sleeves cannot be added until the thermal protection process ends. [0006]       In a general fusion splicing process, time required for the splicing operation is 10 to 20 seconds, and time required for the protection operation is 40 to 135 seconds.    Therefore, even though the splicing operation is performed quickly, the thermal protection operation to the following fusion spliced fiber cannot be started and an idle time in a standby state is induced until the protection process of the preceding fusion spliced fiber has been completed.   Although splicing operation can be performed parallel to the protection operation, the fusion-spliced portion as itself that has not yet been protected is extremely weak.   Therefore, a situation where many fusion-spliced optical fibers waiting protection processing are accumulated may cause problems in which a fusion-spliced portion is broken, damaged or the like by an external force.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0007]       An object of the present invention is to provide a splice protection<br><br>
heater capable of efficiently performing a thermal protection process without causing idle time between splicing operation and the following protection operation, and further capable of performing a thermal protection process suitable for each protection sleeve, a fusion splicer including the splice protection heater, and a fusion splicing method.   A further object of the present invention is to provide a splice protection heater capable of quickly and efficiently performing a thermal protection process with just sufficient heating time for the protection operation and capable of preventing human error in the ON/OFF operations of the heating element switch, a fusion splicer including the splice protection heater, and a fusion splicing method. Means for Solving the Problem<br>
[0008]       These objects are attained by providing a splice protection heater comprising a heating part for heat shrinking at least one protection sleeve covering a fusion spliced portion of at least one optical fiber, the heading part having a plurality of heating elements separated by at least one heat-shielding member and capable of individually heating the at least one protection sleeve with different timings by being individually turned ON/OFF by switches, a heater cover that is openable and closable around a heat generating portion of the heating elements, and a clampers for gripping the at least one optical fiber at both ends of the heating elements, and a fusion splicer provided with this splice protection heater.   The heater cover may include a plurality of cover sections individually openable and closable around corresponding one of the heating elements.    Each of the<br><br>
clampers may include a plurality of clamper sections for individually gripping the at least one optical fiber disposed on corresponding heating element and each of the clamper sections may be provided with a tension exerting mechanism capable of individually exerting a tension force on the at least one fiber.<br>
[0009]       Additionally provided is an optical fiber fusion splicing method comprising fusion splicing at least first and second optical fibers, covering fusion spliced portions of the first and second optical fibers with first and second protection sleeves, respectively, turning on a first heating element of a splice protection heater at a first timing to start heat shrinking of the first protection sleeve, and turning on a second heating element of the splice protection heater at a second timing to start heat shrinking of the second protection sleeve.<br>
[0010]       Another aspect provides a splice protection heater including a heating part for heat shrinking a protection sleeve covering a fusion spliced portion of an optical fiber, having a heating element that is turned ON/OFF by a switch, a heater cover that is openable and closable around a heat generating portion of the heating element, and clampers for gripping optical fiber at bilateral ends of a heating element, and a detecting section that detects whether or not a protection sleeve is on the heating element, and for turning the switch ON/OFF, and a fusion splicer provided with the splice protection heater.   The detecting section may be, for example, a sensor that optically or magnetically detects whether an protective sleeve is placed on the heating element, a sensor that optically or magnetically detects the<br><br>
operation of the heater cover, or a microswitch that mechanically detects the operation of the heater cover, a sensor that optically or magnetically detects the operation of at least one of the clampers, or a microswitch that mechanically detects the operation of at least one of the clampers, or a microswitch that optically or mechanically detects whether an optical fiber is placed on the splice protection heater.<br>
[0011]       Additionally provided is an optical fiber fusion splicing method including fusion splicing optical fibers, covering a fusion-spliced portion of the optical fiber with a protection sleeve, detecting whether the protection sleeve is placed on a heating element of a splice protection heater, and automatically turning ON a switch of the heating element of the splice protection heater upon detection of the protection sleeve being placed on a heating element to start heat shrinking the protection sleeve.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0013]       Figure 1 is a schematic drawing showing of a splice protection heater according to a first embodiment of the present invention.   The splice protection heater 33 performs a thermal protection process on an optical fiber 1 (single strand or optical fiber ribbon) at a fusion spliced portion 2 covered by a protection sleeve via a heating part 4.   The heating part 4 is provided with a pair of clampers 6 disposed at bilateral ends of a base 5, and a heating element 7 that is disposed at a center portion of the heating part. The heating part 4 supports a fusion-spliced optical fiber without slack by the left and right clampers 6.<br>
[0014]       After the fusion-spliced portion 2 that is covered by the protection sleeve 3 has been placed on the heating element 7, the heating part 4 is enclosed by a heater cover (not shown in Figure l).   Then, a switch 8 is turned ON to provide current to the heating element 7 and to heat shrink the protection sleeve 3.   When heating has occurred for a predetermined time and the protection sleeve 3 heating process ends, the switch 8 is turned OFF.   Another power supply switch 10 may be provided to supply current to the heating element 7.   The protection sleeve 3 houses within the heat shrink tube a hot-melt member formed of hot-melt adhesive resin or the like, and a reinforcing rod, such as a stainless rod, magnetic rod, glass ceramic rod or the like.   The protection sleeve 3 is inserted on one side of<br><br>
the optical fiber 1 in advance, and is moved so as to cover the fusion-spliced portion 2 after fusion splicing.<br>
[0015]       The splice protection heater of the first embodiment is configured such that the switch 8 of the heating element 7 is turned ON and OFF automatically when a detecting section 9 detects that a fusion spliced portion covered by a protection sleeve 3 has been set or removed from the heating element of the splice protection heater.    The splice protection heater of the first embodiment can prevent forgetting to turn the switch ON or OFF<br>
[0016]       Figure 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating the detecting section optically detecting the fusion-spliced portion within the splice protection heater.    In this example, a light-emitting element 13, such as a light-emitting diode or the like, is disposed at a side wall 12a of a housing 11 accommodating the protection sleeve 3, and a photoreceptor element 14, such as a photoreceptor diode or the like, is disposed at a side wall 12b on the opposite side to detect the placement and removal of the fusion spliced portion 2.   When the fusion-spliced portion 2 is set within the heater, the light from the light-emitting element 13 to the photoreceptor diode 14 is blocked, and the placement of the fusion-spliced portion 2 is optically detected in a contactless detection.    Then, the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned ON to start the current flow.   The switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned OFF to stop the current flow when the fusion-spliced portion 2 is removed from the housing 11.   A timer may be simultaneously used to turn OFF the switch to accurately<br><br>
measure the heating time.   This method can be expected to provide safe and accurate control since the presence/absence of the fusion-spliced portion 2 itself is directly detected.<br>
[0017]       In the structure shown in Fig. 2, the light-emitting element and<br>
the photoreceptor element may be replaced by an embedded magnetic<br>
sensor while a magnetic rod detectable by a magnetic sensor is used as the<br>
reinforcing rod of the protection sleeve 3.    For example, a magnetic<br>
resistance element, a hall element, a lead switch and the like may be used<br>
as the magnetic sensor.    In this case too, the switch of the heating element<br>
7 is automatically turned ON to allow current to flow by placement of the<br>
fusion-spliced portion 2.    The switch of the heating element 7 is<br>
automatically turned OFF when the fusion-spliced portion 2 is removed<br>
from the housing 11.   A timer may also be used as described above to turn<br>
OFF the switch so as to accurately measure the heating time.<br>
[0018]	Figures 3 to 5 are schematic diagrams illustrating the<br>
detecting section that detect the fusion spliced portion within the splice protection heater using the opening and closing of the heater cover that encloses the heating part, and Fig. 3 shows an example of magnetic detection.   A magnet 16 is embedded in a heater cover 15 that is hinged on the sidewall 12a side and is operated so as to enclose the heating part, and a magnetic sensor 17 is embedded in the sidewall 12b side.    For example, a magnetic resistance element, a hall element, a lead switch and the like may be used as the magnetic sensor 17.   When the fusion spliced portion 2 covered by the protection sleeve 3 is set on the heating element 7 in the<br><br>
housing 11 and the heater cover 15 is closed, the magnetic sensor 17 detects the proximity of the magnet 16, and the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned ON to allow the current to start flowing.   When the heater cover 15 is opened to remove the fusion-spliced portion 2 from the housing 11, the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned OFF to stop the current flow.<br>
[0019]       Figure 4 shows an example of mechanical detection by a microswitch.    A microswitch 18 is installed on the sidewall 12b side and operates when the heater cover 15 is opened and closed.    When the heater cover 15 is closed, the heater cover 15 presses against a switch lever 18a of the microswitch 18, and the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned ON to allow current to start to flow.   When the heater cover 15 is opened, the pressure on the switch lever 18a of the microswitch 18 is released and the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned OFF to stop the current flow.<br>
[0020]       Figure 5 shows an example of optical detection.   An optical sensor 19 having a light-emitting element and a photoreceptor element, and a light shutter member 20 are provided on the sidewall 12b side (details of the optical sensor 19 are described later with reference to Fig. 10).   When the heater cover 15 is closed, the heater cover 15 depresses the light shutter member 20 and the shutter member 20 is disposed between the light-emitting element and the photoreceptor element of the optical sensor 19, thereby actuating the optical sensor 19, and the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned ON to start the current flow.   When the<br><br>
heater cover 15 is opened, the depression of the light shutter member 20 is released; the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned OFF to stop the current flow.<br>
[0021]       As shown in the examples of Figs. 3 to 5, forgetting to turn the switch ON or OFF can be reliably prevented since the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned ON and OFF by the operation of the heater cover 15 when the fusion spliced portion 2 covered by the protection sleeve 3 is set in the splice protection heater.    Furthermore, since the heating by the heating element is performed when the protection sleeve 3 is set in the heating part, the heating time and heating environment are uniform, and a standardized quality fusion process is performed. Moreover, the switch may be turned OFF using a timer to accurately measure the heating time.<br>
[0022]       Figures 6 to 8 are schematic diagrams illustrating the detecting section that detects the fusion-spliced portion 2 in the splice protection heater by the operation of the clamper 6, and Fig. 6 shows an example of mechanical detection.   The clamper 6 has a pressing member 6a connected to an openable and closable hinge, and a clamp base 6b provided with a V-channel 6c for gripping the optical fiber 1 at a predetermined position.   The magnet 16 is embedded in the pressing member 6a side, and the magnetic sensor 17 is embedded in the clamp base 6b side.    For example, a magnetic resistance switch, a hall element, a lead switch and the like may be used as the magnetic sensor 17.   When the pressing member 6a is closed, the magnetic sensor 17 detects the proximity of the magnet 16, and the switch<br><br>
of the heating element 7 is automatically turned ON to start the current flow.   When the pressing member 6a is opened, the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned OFF to stop the current flow. [0023]       Figure 7 shows an example of mechanical detection by a microswitch.   The microswitch 18 is provided on the clamp base side 6b and is actuated by the operation of the pressing member 6a.   When the pressing member 6a is closed, the pressing member 6a presses against the switch lever 18a of the microswitch 18, and the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned ON to start the current flow.    When the pressing member 6a is opened, the pressure on the switch lever 18a of the microswitch 18 is released, and the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned OFF to stop the current flow. [0024]       Figure 8 shows an example of optical detection.    The optical sensor 19 having a light-emitting element and a photoreceptor element, and the light shutter member 20 are provided on the clamp base 6b side.    When the pressing member 6a is closed, the pressing member 6a depresses the light shutter member 20 and actuates the optical sensor 19, and the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned ON to start the current flow.   When the pressing lever 6a is opened, the depression of the light shutter member 20 is released, and the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned OFF to stop the current flow.<br>
[0025]       As shown in the examples of Figs. 6 to 8, forgetting to turn the switch ON or OFF can be reliably prevented since the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned ON and OFF by the operation of the<br><br>
pressing member 6a of the clamper 6 when a fusion spliced portion 2<br>
covered by a protection sleeve 3 is set in the splice protection heater.    The<br>
switch may be turned OFF using a timer to accurately measure the heating<br>
time.   Furthermore, by providing the detecting section that detects a<br>
change of the position of the optical fiber on the clamper, which is separated<br>
from the heating part and unlikely to be influenced by the heat, there is<br>
scant wear and greater stability in the operating state.<br>
[0026]	Figures 9 and 10 are schematic diagrams illustrating the<br>
detecting section that detects the fusion-spliced portion within the splice protection heater by detecting the optical fiber, and Fig. 9 shows an example of direct mechanical detection by the microswitch.    The switch lever 18a of the microswitch 18 disposed near the clamper 6 is directly actuated by placing the optical fiber 1.    When the pressing member 6a is closed, the optical fiber 1 presses against the switch lever 18a of the microswitch 18, and the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned ON to start the flow of current.    A sufficient actuation force is generated to actuate the microswitch 18 by the tightly stretched optical fiber 1.   When the pressing member 6a is opened to remove the fusion spliced portion 2 from the heating element, the pressure is released on the switch lever 18a of the microswitch 18, and the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned OFF to stop the flow of current.<br>
[0027]       Figure 10 shows an example of optical detection where part (a) illustrates a view on a plane taken in a direction substantially perpendicular to the optical fiber and part (b) illustrates a view on a plane<br><br>
taken in a direction substantially parallel to the optical fiber.   An optical sensor is disposed near the clamper 6.   The optical sensor has an actuation member 23 that is biased upward by a force-exerting member 24, such as a spring or the like, and an actuation member 23.   The actuation member 23 is depressed when the optical fiber 1 is placed.   A optical shutter 23a is provided on the actuation member 23, and the optical sensor, which has a light-emitting element 21 and a photoreceptor element 22, is shielded by the optical shutter 23a, such that the photoreceptor element 22 does not receive light and the placement of the fusion spliced portion 2 is detected whereupon the heating element 7 is automatically turned ON to start the current flow.    When the fusion-spliced portion 2 is removed from the heating element, the optical shutter 23a returns to the higher position and the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned OFF to stop the current flow.    Since the optical fiber 1 is extremely fine, it is difficult for the optical fiber itself to directly block the light emitted by the light-emitting element.   However, the change of position of the optical fiber 1 can be directly detected using the above construction.<br>
[0028]       As shown in the examples of Figs. 9 and 10, forgetting to turn the switch ON and OFF is reliably prevented because the switch of the heating element 7 is automatically turned ON and OFF by the presence/absence of the optical fiber 1.    Furthermore, since the heating by the heating element is performed when the fusion-spliced portion 2 is set at a predetermined position of the heating part, the heating time is uniform, and a standardized<br>
4<br>
quality fusion process is performed.   Moreover, the switch may be turned<br><br>
OFF using a timer to accurately measure the heating time.   Less wear and more stable operation can be obtained since the detecting section that detects a change of position of the optical fiber can be provided near the clamper so as to be separated from the heating part and not influenced by the heat emanating therefrom.<br>
[0029]       Figure 11 is a schematic diagram illustrating a fusion splicer provided with the splice protection heater of the first embodiment.   A fusion splicing mechanism 32 can perform a single core fusion splice or multi core fusion splice by arc discharge, and the fusion state is monitored by a monitoring device 31.   Since the fusion splicing mechanism 32 is well known in the art, the structure will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein.    Figure 11 shows an example of a multi core optical fiber ribbon 26 being batch fusion spliced.   When the optical fiber is fusion spliced, a protection sleeve 27 is inserted beforehand from one side or another of the optical fiber ribbon, and moved so as to cover the fusion-spliced portion after fusion splicing.   A fusion splicer 30 efficiently performs consecutive operations of fusion and protection by disposing the splice protection heater 33 of the first embodiment parallel to the fusion splicing mechanism 32. [0030]       After the optical fiber ribbon 26 has been inserted and fusion spliced by the fusion splicing mechanism 32, the fusion spliced portion is covered with the protection sleeve 27 and set in the heating part of the adjacently disposed splice protection heater 33.    The placement of the protection sleeve 27 at the predetermined position in the splice protection heater 33 automatically turns ON the switch of the heating element, thus<br><br>
preventing the operator from forgetting to turn on the switch and efficiently performing the fusion process for a predetermined heating time.   The switch is turned OFF when the protection sleeve 27 is removed, thus preventing the operator from forgetting to turn OFF the switch. [0031]       Since the thermal protection process requires a longer time than the time necessary for fusion splicing, the optical fiber protection process produces idle time even though the fusion splice has been made.   A fusion spliced optical fiber that has not been subjected to the optical fiber protection process is mechanically weak, susceptible to fracture, and can be easily damaged.    In such case, it is preferable to provide a plurality of splice protection heaters 33 to eliminate the idle time for the thermal protection process for a plurality of fusion-spliced optical fibers. [0032]        Figures 12 to 15 are schematic diagrams illustrating a splice protection heater according to a second embodiment of the present invention.    Figure 12 is a perspective view, Fig. 13 is a front view with the heater cover removed, Fig. 14 is a cross sectional view taken along a section line a*a of Fig. 13 with the clamper and heater cover opened, and Fig. 15 is a cross sectional view taken along a section line b-b of Fig. 13.   As shown in Fig. 12, the splice protection heater 33b is provided with a base 5 and at least two heating unit 4a and 4b as a heating part 4, such that heating elements 7a and 7b, which are turned ON and OFF by independent switches, are respectively disposed in each heater 4a and 4b.    Figure 12 shows a state in which the optical fiber 1 and the protection sleeve 3 are removed from the splice protection heater.<br><br>
[0033]       Each of the heating unit 4a and 4b has a housing part to accommodate the protection sleeve 3, and each of the heating unit 4a and 4b is provided with a pair of clampers 61 and 62 for fixedly gripping the optical fiber 1 extending from bilateral ends of the protection sleeve 3.   A tension exerting mechanism 41 is provided on the right side clamper 62 to operate in conjunction therewith.   Each of the heating unit 4a and 4b is provided with a heater cover 15b that covers the protection sleeve 3.   A heat-shielding member 42 is disposed between the heating unit 4a and 4b.    The switches for operating the heating elements 7a and 7b, for example manual ON/OFF pushbutton switches 10b are provided for the heating unit 4a and 4b.<br>
[0034]       The protection sleeves 3 are set on the heating elements 7a and 7b, and the optical fibers 1 extending bilaterally are fixedly gripped by the clampers 61 and 62 (Fig. 13).    The two heating unit 4a and 4b are separated by the heat-shielding member 42, such that the respective heating elements 7a and 7b are mutually impervious to adjacent thermal influence (Fig. 14).   The protection sleeves 3 are set in the housing part of each of the heating unit 4a and 4b so as to contact the heating elements 7a and 7b.    The optical fibers 1 extending from the bilateral ends of the protection sleeves 3 are set on the clamp base (not shown in the drawing) of the clampers 61 and 62.<br>
[0035] The heated portion of the protection sleeves 3 are covered by the heater cover 15b during the heating operation so that there will be no heat released externally.   The heater cover 15b is provided for each heating<br><br>
element 7a and 7b, and is configured, for example, with a flat or Lrshaped cross section so as to cover part of the exterior surface of the protection sleeve 3 when closed.   The heater cover 15b is preferably configured in two parts, cover sections, in a shape that opens bilaterally in left/right symmetry so as to be installable in a narrow space and improve operation. [0036]       A linkage rod 39 extends from bilateral ends of the heater cover 15b and engages apertures 61b and 62b of the clampers 61 and 62. Accordingly, the heater cover 15b can be closed in linkage with the linkage rod 39 by closing either clamper 61 or 62.   The linkage rod 39 and apertures 61b and 62b are provided with large clearances to allow some play in operation.    The heater cover 15b and the clampers 61 and 62 need not necessarily be linked, and may be operated separately. [0037]       The clampers 61 and 62 are preferably provided, as clamper sections, for each heating element so as to be operable independently.    The clampers 61 and 62 are configured by three legs including a handle 62c, a pressing member 62a, and a shaft support 62d.    The aperture 62a for engaging the linkage rod 39 of the heater cover 15b is provided on the pressing member 62a as previously mentioned.    The left side clamper 61 is identically configured as the right side clamper 62.   The shaft support 62d can pivot to open, and has en embedded magnet 43.   A magnet 44 or other magnetic body is embedded on the clamp base side, such that the closed state is fixedly maintained by magnetic attraction between the magnets 43 and 44. [0038]       A tension exerting mechanism 41 can be provided on one or<br><br>
another of the left and right clampers 61 and 62.   The tension exerting mechanism 41 may be realized, as shown in Fig. 13 for example, by forcing clamp base side of the clamper 62 toward the outer side by a force exerting member 45 such as a spring or the like, so as to move along a sliding axis 41a.<br>
[0039]       In this configuration, the protection sleeve 3 covering the fusion-spliced portion of the optical fiber is placed on the heater 4a or 4b, and the right side of the optical fiber is first gripped by the right side clamper 62. Then, the right side clamper 62 is moved leftward compressing the tension-exerting member 45, and while maintaining this state the left side clamper 61 fixedly grips the left side of the optical fiber 1.    Thereafter, the right side clamper 62 is forced rightward when the compression of the tension-exerting member 45 is released, thus drawing the fusion spliced optical fiber tight.    By drawing the optical fiber tight, the optical fiber is maintained without bends within the protection sleeve 3, such that the optical fiber is protected in a bendless state when the hot-melt material within the heat-shrunk protection sleeve 3 has been melted and solidified. [0040]       It is preferable that the splice protection heater is provided with the heat-shielding member 42 for blocking heat between the heating elements 7a and 7b so as to prevent mutual thermal influence between the respective heating elements 7a and 7b of the heating unit 4a and 4b, and it is preferable that the heat-shielding member 42 is formed of a resin having excellent heat resistance and heat insulation.    It is further preferable that the shape of the heat-shielding member 42 is such as to enclose the<br><br>
protection sleeve 3 to block heat from the heating element 7a and 7b from being released to the outside when the heater cover 15b is closed. [0041]       By providing heating elements that can be turned ON and OFF with different timings by independent switches in at least two heating unit, »     and providing independently operated cover sections, clamper sections, and a tension exerting mechanisms, as described above, the optical fiber can be provided with a protection sleeve and the thermal protection process can be performed immediately after the fusion splicing has ended without producing idle time.    Thus, the overall work time can be shortened and bends and damage are prevented in the vicinity of the splice caused as a result of the unprotected condition of the fusion spliced portion after the optical fiber has been fusion spliced.<br>
[0042]        Figure 16 is a schematic diagram showing a fusion splicer provided with the splice protection heater of the second embodiment.    The fusion splicing mechanism 32 is identical to that of the first embodiment. A hood 49 is used as a cover for the fusion splicing mechanism 32 to prevent the heat discharged during fusion splicing from affecting the outside. [0043]       The optical fiber ribbon 26 is placed in the fusion splicing mechanism 32 and fusion spliced, then the fusion spliced portion is covered by the protection sleeve 27, and the ribbon is placed on either heater 4a or 4b of the adjacent splice protection heater 33b.    Heating is started by a heating element that can be individually turned ON and OFF, and a new optical fiber to be fusion spliced is set on the empty fusion splicing mechanism 32.<br><br>
[0044]       Although the previously fusion spliced optical fiber protection process is underway in the splice protection heater 33b even after the new optical fiber fusion splice is completed, a protection process for the new fusion spliced optical fiber can be performed in the empty heater.   That is, the heating starting time is staggered, to perform heating processes of a plurality of protection sleeves.   Thereafter, the cycle is repeated.   The time waiting to perform the thermal protection process is reduced to zero by adding several heating unit 4a and 4b with independent heat controls according to the time required for the fusion splicing and for the protection process.<br>
[0045]        Figure 17 is a schematic drawing showing an electrical circuit in the splice protection heater of the second embodiment.    The splice protection heater of the second embodiment has two sets of the heating element 7, the switch 8 and the detecting section 9 of the first embodiment (illustrated in Fig. 17 as the heating elements 7a and 7b, the switches 8a and 8b and the detecting section 9a and 9b).    In addition, a single control unit 50 is provided to batch control the current supplied to the heating elements 7a and 7b.<br>
[0046]       Figure 18 contains graphs showing examples of the current controlled by the control unit 50 and the temperatures of the heating parts. Part (a) shows the current la supplied to the heating element 7a, and the temperature Ta of the heating element 7a, and part (b) shows the current lb supplied to the heating element 7b, and the temperature Tb of the heating element 7b.   At time to the switch 8a is turned ON when a fusion splice<br><br>
portion is set on the heater 4a, and a current Io is supplied to the heating element 7a.   The control unit 50 measures the temperature Ta of the heating element 7a by monitoring the resistance of the heating element 7a, and switches ON/OFF the current la supplied to the heating element 7a so as to maintain the heating element 7a at the temperature To. [0047]       At time ti the switch 8b is turned ON when a fusion splice portion is placed on the heater 4b, and the current Io is also supplied to the heating element 7b.   The control unit 50 measures the temperature Tb of the heating element 7b by monitoring the resistance of the heating element 7b, and turns ON/OFF the current lb supplied to the heating element 7a so as to maintain the heating element 7b at a temperature To.   Thus, current is controlled so as to not be supplied simultaneously to the heating element 7a and heating element 7b.<br>
[0048]        Since the control unit 50 controls the current so as to not be supplied simultaneously to the heating elements 7a and 7b, the maximum current supplied via a battery is restricted to the same current Io as in the case of a single splice protection heater (for example, 2.6 A).   Thus, battery depletion is suppressed, and the number of battery recharges and discharges can be increased from 400 to 500 times.<br>
