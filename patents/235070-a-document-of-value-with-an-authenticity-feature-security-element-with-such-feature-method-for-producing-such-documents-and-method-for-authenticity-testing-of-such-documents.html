				<td>A DOCUMENT OF VALUE WITH AN AUTHENTICITY FEATURE, SECURITY<br>
ELEMENT WITH SUCH FEATURE, METHOD FOR PRODUCING SUCH DOCUMENTS<br>
AND METHOD FOR AUTHENTICITY TESTING OF SUCH DOCUMENTS<br>
This invention relates to a printed document of value having at least one authenticity<br>
feature in the form of a luminescent substance based on host lattices doped with<br>
chromophores with the electron configuration (3d)2.<br>
The term "document of value" refers according to the invention to bank notes,<br>
checks, shares, tokens, ID cards, credit cards, passports and other documents as well as<br>
labels, seals, packages or other elements for product protection.<br>
Protecting documents of value against forgery by means of luminescent substances<br>
has been known for some Lime. The use of rare earth metals has also been discussed in<br>
this context. They have the advantage of having narrow-band characteristic spectral lines<br>
that facilitate reliable detection and delimitation over other spectra. The substances<br>
preferably used have either absorption or emission outside the visible spectral region.<br>
If the emissions are at wavelengths between about 400 nanometers and about 700<br>
nanometers, the luminescent substances are detectable with the eye upon suitable<br>
excitation. This is desirable for some applications, e.g. for an authenticity check by<br>
illumination with UV light. For other applications, however, it is of advantage if the<br>
emission is outside the visible spectral region since special detectors are then necessary<br>
for detecting the substances.<br>
Luminophores with characteristic properties that are suitable for protecting<br>
documents of value and in particular for automatic authenticity detection are limited in<br>
number, however. Most inorganic and organic luminophores have uncharacteristic, broad<br>
spectra and are moreover often commercially available. This impedes their identification<br>
and makes it impracticable to use several of said substances simultaneously.<br>
Starting out from this prior art, the invention is based on the problem of increasing<br>
the number of luminophores suitable as an authenticity marking for documents of value<br>
and in particular providing documents of value with authenticity features in the form of<br>
luminescent substances that differ from documents of value with hitherto known<br>
luminophores by a characteristically altered excitation and/or emission spectrum.<br>
The solution to this problem can be found in the independent claims. Developments<br>
are the subject matter of the subclaims.<br>
The invention is based on the finding that the difficult detectability of certain<br>
luminescences with increasing emission wavelength in the IR spectral region can be<br>
utilized very advantageously to increase the protection from forgery.<br>
According to the invention, documents of value are protected using at least one<br>
luminescent substance whose emission spectrum is outside the visible spectral region,<br>
preferably even outside the responsiveness of silicon detectors.<br>
The substances suitable for the inventive authenticity protection are luminescent<br>
substances based on host lattices doped with chromophores with the electron<br>
configuration (3d)2. These may be chromophores of one kind or a mixture of at least two<br>
different chromophores. The inventive chromophores are preferably the transition metals<br>
titanium in oxidation state Ti2+, hereinafter Ti(II), vanadium in oxidation state V3+,<br>
hereinafter V(III), chromium in oxidation state Cr4+, hereinafter Cr(IV), manganese in<br>
oxidation state Mn5+, hereinafter Mn(V), and iron in oxidation state Fe6+, hereinafter<br>
Fe(VI).<br>

palmierites, forsterite, brushites, dahllites, ellestadites, francolites, monetites, morinites,<br>
whitlockites, wilkeites, voelckerites, pyromorphites, garnets, perovskites, olivines and<br>

a, b each range from 0 to 1.<br>
K Ti2 (P O4)3, K Zr2 (P O4)3 is especially preferred.<br>
Host lattices with a strong crystal field are in particular preferred.<br>
The positions and shapes of the excitation and/or emission bands are dependent on<br>
the insertion position of the chromophores in the host lattice. The chromophores can be<br>
present in the oxidic structural units of the host lattice both in the tetrahedral and in the<br>
octahedral configuration. However, the tetroxo configuration in the host lattice is<br>
preferred. In addition, the positions and shapes of the excitation and/or emission bands<br>
depend on the strength of the crystal field in the host lattice. The interactions occurring<br>
between chromophore and host lattice cause the electronic levels of the chromophores to<br>
change relative to their values and arrangement in the gas phase, i.e. to shift (in part<br>
mutually).<br>
The concept of the crystal field will be explained by the example of the system Cr3+<br>
in an octahedral environment [Imbusch, G.F.; Spectroscopy of Solid-State Laser-Type<br>
Materials, Ed: B. Di Bartolo; p 165; 1987]. Fig. la shows how the position and<br>
succession of the electronic levels of the chromophore Cr3+ depend on the strength of the<br>
crystal field, i.e. the interaction between chromophore and lattice (Tanabe-Sugano<br>
diagram). For weak octahedral crystal fields, the electronic state 4T2 is the first excited<br>
state above the ground state 4A2, a broad-band luminescence from level 4T2 is observed.<br>
For strong crystal fields, finally, the state 2E weakly dependent on the crystal field is the<br>
first excited electronic state and a narrow-band emission from this level is observed.<br>
Analogous energy diagrams can be formulated for the inventive (3d)2 configuration with<br>
the corresponding designations of the levels. For the important octahedral (Oh) and<br>
tetrahedral (Td) configuration the level sequence is shown in Fig. lb.<br>
For protecting documents of value both broad-band and narrow-band luminescence<br>
can be used, but for reasons of selectivity narrow-band luminescence is preferred. These<br>
are observed in particular from the chromophores Mn(V) and Fe(VI) in host lattices with<br>
a strong crystal field.<br>
Narrow band emission is usually spoken of when the bands occurring in the<br>
emission spectrum show an average half-value width of less than 50 nanometers.<br>
However, this does not mean that bands having a half-value width outside this range do<br>
not solve the inventive problem.<br>
Varying and combining the inventive chromophores and varying the host lattices<br>
open up numerous possibilities for influencing the excitation and emission spectra of the<br>
inventive luminescent substances and thus producing a great number of security features.<br>
Not only the evaluation of the excitation and/or emission spectra can be used for<br>
differentiation but also the lifetime of luminescence. The evaluation can take account of<br>
not only the wavelengths of the excitation or emission lines but also their number and/or<br>
shape and/or intensities, so that any desired coding can be represented.<br>
The number of distinguishable inventive substances can be further increased if<br>
mixed crystals of the host lattices are also permitted or the host lattices are varied with<br>
additional dopings. For example, apatites and spodiosites or garnets and perovskites in<br>
certain concentration ratios of the starting substances can form mixed crystals in which<br>
the lattices run into one another. Connected therewith the crystal field acting on the<br>
chromophore can be changed.<br>
Likewise, it is possible to incorporate further chromophores into the host lattices in<br>
addition to the inventive chromophores by doping and thus obtain combined<br>
luminescence of both systems or an energy transfer between the systems and utilize it for<br>
identification. For example, rare earth ions that maintain their typical luminescence in the<br>
host lattice due to their shielded shells are suitable for this purpose. These are preferably<br>
neodymium (Nd), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm) or ytterbium (Yb) cations or<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
If the document of value is marked not with one but with several of the inventive<br>
luminescent substances, the number of distinguishable combinations can be increased<br>
further. If different mixture ratios are moreover distinguished, the number of<br>
combinations can be increased again. Marking can be effected either at different places on<br>
the document of value or at the same place. If the luminescent substance is applied or<br>
incorporated at different places on the document of value, a spatial code, in the simplest<br>
case e.g. a bar code, can be produced in this way.<br>
Further, the forgery-proofness of the document of value can be increased by linking<br>
the special chosen luminescent substance e.g. in a document of value with other<br>
information of the document of value so that a check by means of a suitable algorithm is<br>
possible. The document of value can of course have further additional authenticity<br>
features, such as classic fluorescence and/or magnetism, besides the inventive<br>
luminescent substance.<br>
The luminescent substances can be incorporated into the document of value in a<br>
great variety of ways according to the invention. Thus, the luminescent substances can be<br>
incorporated into a printing ink for example. It is also possible to admix the luminescent<br>
substance to the paper pulp or plastic composition during production of a document of<br>
value based on paper or plastic. Likewise, the luminescent substances can be provided on<br>
or in a plastic carrier material, which can for example be again embedded at least partly<br>
into the paper pulp. The carrier material, which is based on a suitable polymer, such as<br>
PMMA, and into which the inventive luminescent substance is embedded, can have the<br>
form of a security thread, a mottling fiber or a planchet. Likewise, for product protection<br>
the luminescent substance can be incorporated e.g. directly into the material of the object<br>
to be protected, e.g. into housings and plastic bottles.<br>
However, the plastic or paper carrier material can also be fastened to any other<br>
object, e.g. for product protection. The carrier material is in this case preferably designed<br>
in the form of a label. If the carrier material is part of the product to be protected, as is the<br>
case e.g. with tear threads, any other design is of course also possible. It can be expedient<br>
in certain cases of application to provide the luminescent substance on the document of<br>
value as an invisible coating. It can be present all over or else in the form of certain<br>
patterns, such as stripes, lines, circles or in the form of alphanumeric characters. To<br>
guarantee the invisibility of the luminescent substance, either a colorless luminescent<br>
substance must, according to the invention, be used in the printing ink or coating lacquer<br>
or a colored luminescent substance used in such low concentration that the transparency<br>
of the coating is just given. Alternatively or additionally, the carrier material can be<br>
already colored suitably so that colored luminescent substances are not perceived due to<br>
their inherent color.<br>
Usually, the inventive luminescent substances are processed in the form of<br>
pigments. For better processing or to increase their stability, the pigments can be present<br>
in particular as individually encapsulated pigment particles or be covered with an<br>
inorganic or organic coating. For example, the individual pigment particles are<br>
surrounded with a silicate sheath and can thus be more easily dispersed in media.<br>
Likewise, different pigment particles of a combination can be encapsulated jointly, e.g. in<br>
fibers, threads, silicate sheaths. Thus, it is e.g. no longer possible to change the "code" of<br>
the combination subsequently. "Encapsulation" refers here to complete encasing of the<br>
pigment particles, while "coating" includes partial encasing or covering of the pigment<br>
particles.<br>
Hereinafter, some examples of the inventive luminescent substance will be<br>
explained in more detail.<br>
Example 1<br>
For the preparation the starting substances in oxidic form or substances that can be<br>
converted into oxides are mixed in a suitable ratio, e.g. as in equation (1), provided with<br>
the chromophore and then annealed, crushed, washed (e.g. with water), dried and ground.<br>
The chromophores used can be e.g. Mn2O3, MnO, MnO2, MnCO3) MnCl2, KMnO4 and<br>
organic manganese compounds. Their weight fraction based on the total mixture can be<br>
up to 20 percent by weight. Annealing is effected in the temperature range from 200 to<br>
1700°C and a holding time of 0.2 to 24 hours, but preferably at 300 to 500°C and a<br>
holding time from 0.5 to 2 hours.<br>
(1)6 LiOH + As2O5 +x MnCl2 ? 2 Li3AsO4 : Mn + 3 H2O + x Cl2<br>
To shift equilibrium in the direction of product formation, the preparation can<br>
additionally be mixed with LiCO3, preferably 1 to 5 percent, and additional LiOH,<br>
preferably 1 to 20 percent by weight.<br>
Example 2<br>
Suitable quantities of sulfates (e.g. K2SO4) or chromates (e.g. K2CrO4) and the<br>
quantity of dopant, e.g. Na2FeO4 are dissolved in an alkaline medium. The doping with<br>
Na2FeO4 can be up to 20 percent. Vaporization of the solvent yields the product, which is<br>
ground for further use.<br>
Alternatively, a solid-state reaction can also be performed. For this purpose, K2S04<br>
is ground with NaCl and intimately mixed with Fe3CO4. The mixture is then annealed at<br>
temperatures between 700 and 1800°C. The product is ground for further use.<br>
Example 3<br>
The method described in Example 2 can be altered so that a spray dryer is used for<br>
vaporizing the solvent. Further, the alkaline medium can consist completely or partly e.g.<br>
of a silicate suspension (e.g. LUDOX® AS-40, Dupont). In this case a material encased<br>
with silicate is obtained upon spray drying. A subsequent annealing process, preferably at<br>
temperatures from 200°C to 600°C, produces a SiO2 protective layer and stabilizes the<br>
substance with respect to solubility in water. Additionally the material can be embedded<br>
into a polymer, e.g. PMMA, and processed into foil material. This is then cut into<br>
planchets.<br>
Further embodiments and advantages of the invention will be explained hereinafter<br>
with reference to Figure 2.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an inventive security element in cross section.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an embodiment of the inventive security element. The security element<br>
consists in this case of label 2 composed of paper or plastic layer 3, transparent cover<br>
layer 4 and adhesive layer 5. Label 2 is connected via adhesive layer 5 with any desired<br>
substrate 1. Substrate 1 may be a document of value, ID card, passport, certificate or the<br>
like, or another object to be protected, for example CD, package or the like. Luminescent<br>
substance 6 is contained within the volume of layer 3 in this example.<br>
Alternatively, the luminescent substance might also be contained in a printing ink<br>
(not shown) that is printed on one of the label layers, preferably on the surface of layer 3.<br>
Instead of providing the luminescent substance in or on a carrier material that is then<br>
fastened to an object as a security element, it is also possible according to the invention to<br>
provide the luminescent substance directly in the document of value to be protected or on<br>
the surface thereof in the form of a coating.<br>
