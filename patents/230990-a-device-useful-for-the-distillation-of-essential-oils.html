				<td>The present invention relates to a device useful  for the distillation of essential oils. <br>
The present invention particularly relates to a device useful for the  distillation  of  essential  oils  and  process  thereof  for distillation of essential oils such as rose oil, lavender oil, chamomile oil, celery seed oil, tagetes oil, vetiver root oil,  and so on, in general, being of versatile design and hence suitable for multipurpose use.  Specifically, the device and process of the present i-nvention is for rose oil distillation.<br>
This unit is useful to distill the essential oils from fresh flowers  of  Rosa  damascene,  Lavandula  officinalis,  Matricaria chamomilla, seeds of Apium graveolens, biomass of Tagetes minuta, roots of Vetivarea zizanioides  and so on by all the three methods of hydrodistillation. There is no need to comminute the rose flowers before charging into the still, which decreases recurring cost and time of processing.     The process provides minimum dilution and charring effect of the charged materials.  Due to built-in cohobation column, within the system, the yield of direct rose oil comes up to 70% of total oil.  The unit is most suitable for covering commercial scale plantation of scented roses for bulk production of rose water and rose oil.<br>
The traditional  rose oil distillation unit is shown in fig.:l of the drawings accompanying this specification.  Reference may be made<br>
to (1) Kahol, A.P. and Aggarwal, K.K.   "Improved Technology for Production of Rose oil" Indian Perfumer 27 (2), pp.137-142. 1983. (2) Sharma, M.L. Cultivation of Rose and Manufacture of its Products in India. In: Cultivation and Utilization of Aromatic Plants. Regional Research Laboratory (CSIR) Jammu Tawi, pp. 537. 1982.<br>
The traditional rose oil distillation unit comprises : directly fired copper vessel of spherical shape called Deg (a) of  250-500 lit. capacity to process 50-100 kg of   rose flowers per batch, a long necked copper vessel  immersed in a cold water tank employed as a condenser-cum-receiver for collecting distillate called Babhka (b) and a bamboo pipe serving as the vapour connection (c).  The water in the cooling tank (d) has to be changed from time to time.    The water charged into still is 3 to 4 times the weight of  rose flowers.  The heating is done by  a slow burning fire wood  or cow-dung from the hearth (e) below.   The "first water" collected from several stills is redistilled very slowly  until 15-20% of  total rose water charged is collected as a distillate ("second  rose water").   Mud and cloth are used to seal the system.  The oil recovery is 0.01% to 0.02%.<br>
The major drawback of this system is the lack of controlling devices for temperature, pressure and for monitoring the rate of distillation.   Charring  of rose flowers occurs, if  fire is not controlled well.  The use of poor sealing agents like mud and cloth<br><br>
often fails to hold the Deg lid (f) in case of  pressure generated inside the system.  Due to short length of the Deg connection (c), a part of vapour line, the pollen and other low volatile components also get mixed with oil vapour resulting into poor quality of rose water and rose oil.  Due to uncontrolled heating and inability to monitor the process, high amount of water has to be charged in the still leading to the high dilution  of rose water causing poor recovery of rose oil and separation of   rose oil from water becomes tedious. There are always chances of leakage or bursting because of the use of receiver as  condenser owing to its insufficient heat transfer area and poor sealing agents.<br>
An improvement of the traditional unit has been reported by Sharma, M.L. Rosa damascena Mill. - A Source of Natural Perfume. Indian Rose Annual V, pp. 162 - 169. 1986.  The unit consists of a directly fired distillation vessel provided with a false bottom to avoid direct contact of the flowers with the heating surface, a tubular condenser with provision of   running water, a separating funnel for separating rose water &amp; rose oil and a pipe connecting separating funnel and the still for recycling of rose water.  The major limitation of this method is that the recycled rose water gets continuously mixed with the refuse resulting into deterioration of quality.  The refuse of the charged material after certain period of heating starts producing burnt off-notes.  Because of the recycling of the rose water into the still, the subsequently extracted lot of rose<br>
oil contains such off-notes and fetches very low price in the market. The unit is also not suitable for bulk distillation being small sized. Another draw back of this unit is that it can not be used to distill the plant materials by steam distillation.<br>
Other improvements of the rose oil distillation unit have been<br>
*<br>
reported:  (1)  V.  Chandra,  Oil  Bearing Rose.  In  :  Advances  in Horticulture. Vol. 11. Eds. K.L.Chadha and Rajendra Gupta. Malhotra Publishing House, New Delhi-110 064. INDIA, 1995. (2) Kahol, A.P. and Aggarwal, K.K.   "Improved Technology for Production of Rose oil" Indian Perfumer 27 (2), pp.137-142. 1983.  This involves a separate redistillation unit provided with a cohobation tower for subsequent processing of rose water  to rose oil .  The heating in the system is done by steam jacket.  This improvement because of its two step nature requires more time and energy for distillation leading to higher recurring and non-recurring production cost.  Because of the lack of stirring effect of the flowers, the petals lying just adjacent to the steam jacket get charred resulting into poor quality oil.<br>
Another improvement of the direct fired distillation unit {CSIR News vol. 46, No. 7, 15th April, 1996.} involving recycling through the same still involves an efficient and evenly distributed heating system achieved by  an  increased   heating  surface  area  through horizontal set of exhaust pipes at the base of the still (calandria),<br><br>
and very long vertical part of the vapour line which gives cohobation effect.   The major drawback of this design is very high risk of charring  even upon slight overloading of the still resulting into settling down of the flower mass through the false bottom then on to the calandria. Moreover, the per batch capacity of the still is only 150 kg rose flowers.<br>
Steam distillation is a universal process for the distillation of number of aromatic herbs for production of essential oils.  The said process is performed on simple field distillation units which are used in essential oil industry for primary distillation of essential oils at commercial scale.  A schematic diagram of such a field distillation unit  is  shown  in  fig. :  2  of  the  drawings  accompanying  this specification.   These units comprises of a distillation tank (A) without steam jacket and cohobation column.  The plant material is charged above the false bottom (D) from the top of the tank after removing the top lid (C).   Before charging, the chains (B) for removing the false bottom (along with the processed material after the completion of distillation process) are lifted and then the material is charged.   Then the lid is closed and the bolts are tightened. Steam generated in a separate boiler is fed to the unit through the steam spurger (E) below the false bottom (D).  The tank is connected through a small inclined vapour line (F) to a condenser (G) where vapours are condensed.  The distillate from condenser is collected in a receiver (H) through oil &amp; water out let pipe (I).  The essential<br>
oil, being lighter than water, settles as upper layer.  The excess water from the receiver (H) is drained out through water out let (J) continuously.  The settled essential oil is again send to the oil receiver (K) through oil drain pipe line (L).<br>
The main draw back of this system is that the device can not be used to distill high valued essential oil for the reason being its low recoveries due to the lack of cohobation column.  Another disadvantage is that it can not be used to distill the plant material such as freshly harvested scented rose flowers by water distillation process.<br>
Thus, all the distillation units and process mentioned above have one or the other major drawbacks like poor oil quality, low oil recovery, low efficiency in terms of fuel and time,  low batch capacity, high non-recurring costs and inefficient to perform all the three types of hydrodistillations.<br>
The main object of the present  invention is to provide a device useful for the distillation of essential oils and a process thereof which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present  invention is to provide a device for higher recovery of essential oils such as rose oil, lavender oil, chamomile oil, celery seed oil, tagetes oil, vetiver root oil,  and so on with low capital investment.<br><br>
Still another object of the present invention is  to provide a device for industrial production of essential oils such as rose oil, lavender oil, chamomile oil, celery seed oil, tagetes oil, vetiver root oil,  and so on  covering  large area of  cultivation.<br>
Yet another very specific object of the present invention is to provide a device useful for cost effective rose oil distillation of 400 to 425 kg batch capacity, providing quality grade rose oil with 0.035% oil recovery.<br>
In fig.: 3 of the drawings accompanying this specification, a schematic diagram of the device of the present invention is shown. The device  of  the present  invention  essentially  consists  of  a distillation tank unit (I), a cohobation head column (II), condenser unit (III) and a receiver-cum-separator unit (IV).<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device useful for the distillation of essential oils, which comprises a distillation tank (1) having an external jacket (2) connected to means (3,4) for steam supply (3) and steam trap (4); the  distillation tank being provided at its bottom portion with means (5,6,7) for steam spurging (5), auxiliary heating (6), and an outlet (7); above the said steam spurger and auxiliary heaters being provided a removably fixed grating (8); above the said grating (8) being provided at least one opening (9) for discharging of spent materials; the said distillation tank<br>

The process of the present invention for distillation of essential oils is detailed below:<br>
The flower material is charged in the still along with sufficient quantity of water.   The heaters are switched on prior to steam injection to allow minimum condensation of steam inside the still. Then the steam is directly forced through the spurger in to the flower mass which keeps on stirring the mass besides providing heat for distillation.  The vapours evolved from the tank are enriched with more volatile constituents in the cohobation column.  The vapours with desirable constituents coming out  of  the cohobation column are condensed in the condenser and collected in the receiver.   The distillate in the receiver is separated on the basis of density difference into first rose oil and first rose water.  The rose water<br>
from three batches is pooled and is redistilled to recover the remaining rose oil.   Redistillation of rose water employs heating through steam jacket and heaters.<br>
A mixture of two mutually insoluble compounds, like oil and water, boil when its temperature is raised to the point where the combined vapour pressure becomes equal to the surrounding pressure. The basic principle of steam distillation, therefore, consists in bringing  the  two mutually  insoluble  liquids  into  contact  at  a temperature  very close to the boiling point of the more volatile liquid of the two.  At this stage small addition of vapour pressure by the low volatile fluid, make the combined pressure equal to the surrounding pressure.  The mixture then boil and the oil vapourise into the passing  steam as fast as its requirement of latent heat can be fulfilled.<br>
Steam generated  in a separate boiler is passed through mass. Steam imparts its  latent heat to the mass by way of condensation on the  surface of flower which, ultimately causes the transfer of oil from glands to the surface of the flower.  Further, no sooner the temperature of any layer of mass reaches to an equilibrium point the droplets of oil on the surface of flower start vapourising and the necessary  current to lift the vapours of oil from surface of material to the top is provided by latent heat of steam.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the device and the process of the present invention for the distillation of essential oils and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1:<br>
The essential oil distillation unit shown in fig.: 3 with the following features was constructed and installed at an altitude of 1350 m msL (mean sea level) where the water boils at a temperature of<br>
96 C with vapour pressure 644.4 mm Hg (0.876 kg/cm). Processing o 1200 kg flowers of Rosa damascena was standardised for the production of quality grade rose oil.<br>
(A) Constructional Features : -<br>
The unit comprised four parts;<br>
1.	The still<br>
2.	The condenser<br>
3.	The receiver-cum-separator<br>
4.	A boiler for generation of steam.<br>
l.The Still:-<br>
The still commonly called as "tank" (1) with actual volume = 2235.75 lit. (excluding top lid volume = 82.33 lit.) and thickness = 4mm primarily serving as a container for holding the plant material, and as a vessel in which the water and/or steam contacts the material<br>
and vapourises its essential oil was used.  In its simple form the still consisted of merely a cylindrical container with length  egua! to 1.7 times the diameter of tank and equipped with a removable cove (10)  device used for holding the top  of the still and consists of simple water seal (21).  A charging hole (20) was introduced  on the still  top/lid  to  charge  the  plant material and water into  the still.    Similarly, a discharging hole (9) on  one side of the cylindrical tank (1) was welded just above the false bottom (8) to remove the spent material after processing and for any other related operations.   Electric kettle elements of  2 kW  (6 nos.)  (6) were fixed  in the actual bottom of the still.  A false bottom (8) was placed sufficiently far above the real bottom of the still so that it could hold the herbal materials and do not  come in contact with the heaters (6) below to avoid   charring.  A perforated coil of 3/4"ø pipe with cross (5) below the false bottom  (8) which enters through the side of the still was provided to pass the live steam. Holes of l/8"ø were drilled on the top of each arm throughout its length to ensure optimum and even steam distribution. The distance between bottom of the retort (1) and to false bottom (8) was 250 mm to permit any water condensing within the retort.    The bottom of  the still was provided with a drain valve of 2"ø  (gate valve) (?) so that the<br>
spent water could easily be drained off along with some fine suspended spent plant material after completion of the process.   Around the cylindrical tank within the steam jacket (2) portion  four stiffeners of 25x25x3 thick   iron angles were   welded on vessel at 200mm<br>
intervals.  This was required, to prevent buckling when high pressure of steam was introduced in the steam jacket.  This steam jacket (2) was made up of   Mild Steel  (MS) with a thickness of 4mm,  internal diameter (ID) = 1400 mm with cylindrical height of 1000mm  to cover the stainless steel  tank (1) from outside and bottom.  Steam jacket (2) was provided with a pressure gauge (18) span  0-100 psig, 6" dial type, i"ø vent  cock by its side to release the unwanted/excess steam or air and to maintain it at a required pressure.  A safety valve was also provided  on the steam jacket.  A dial type temperature gauge with extension lead having a temperature range of 0-150 ° C with 1 ° division to measure the temperature inside the tank was fixed. Another temperature gauge and pressure gauge (18) was placed at a height  of 1500 mm (approx.) from the vapour  outlet (11) of the still.  Actual height of cohobation  column (13) was 1500 mm, and had four spherical loops of  ID = 200 mm, ID of  column  = 100 mm and was well insulated so that optimum condensation  occurs in the vapour line.  All joints were welded and steam tight, as any steam leak could lead to loss of essential oil and fuel.<br>
2.The Condenser:-<br>
The details of condenser used are given below; SHEpL AND TUBE EXCHANGER DATA SHEET;<br>

2.	Type	: Simple shell and tube (1-1) counter flow condenser.<br>
3.	Horizontal/Vertical	: Horizontal<br>
4.	Surface area	: 23,56,195 mm2<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
3.	The Oil Receiver-cum-Separator:-<br>
The material  of construction  (MoC)  of the    receiver-cum-separator (17) was Stainless Steel-304 having a diameter = 500 mm and could hold 110 lit. of distillate in it.   A long stemmed funnel (16) was welded onto the separator for receiving the distillate.   The lower outlet of the funnel was turned upward.   On an average   the separator received water to oil   weight ratio of   4760:1.   To remove   excess water continuously',  a water outlet  (22)  25 mm      SS pipe,  16 BWG was provided.   For collecting oil after completion of the process, a 10 mm stainless steel pipe was welded at the top of the receiver with an anfle of 15° slightly above the condensate outlet pipe.    The inner wall of the receiver-cum-separator (17) was highly polished.<br>
4.	A Boiler for Steam generation:-<br>
The boiler with a capacity to generate 500 kg of steam per hour was<br>
used.<br>
(B) Working details _:-<br>
In the beginning,   400 lit. of fresh water was   charged into the sterilised/rinsed still  (1).   Then   heaters (6) were switched on to heat the water to 601. Four hundred kilograms of freshly plucked rose flowers were charged into the still  through the charging hole (20). Then the charging hole (20) was   tightened so that the vapours   do not escape during the process.     Live steam was used to heat the mixture in the still (1), through perforated steam coil  (spurger)  (5).     After reaching the boiling   point of the mixture in the still,   the steam<br>
was controlled so that   the gauge pressure of the steam  in the boiler<br>
2 was maintained between   2-4 kg/cm   and the flow rate of the same was<br>
adjusted such that  the  flow rate  of  distillate must be around  50 lit/hr.    The range of shell side   fluid flow rate in condenser (23) is maintained at 200 to 250 lit/hr.   The distillate was collected in an    oil  receiver-cum-separator  (17).  The  total  distillate  collected equaled to   the fresh water   fed into the still (1) in the beginning. The rose oil was separated from rose water.   The collected rose water was stored.   In the same way   3 batches of rose water   collected was charged in the still  (1) and was heated by electric heaters (6) and by passing the steam through the means (3) to the steam jacket (2). 400 lit. of rose water was collected @ 35-40 lit/hr.   Some of the oil first retained in a tubular rose oil separator further the distillate along  with  some  oil  droplets  were  collected  in  the  receiver-cum-separator.   The rose oil settled in the receiver above   the rose water was separated out  after circulating tepid water around the receiver-cum-separator  (17).    The  separated  rose  oil  was  dried  by  adding anhydrous sodium sulphate.   The dried rose oil was measured and stored in aluminum containers for three months to attain maturation of the oil.   The oil   was then further analysed for its quality and results given below.<br>

Example 2:<br>
$team distillation of Lavender Oil :<br>
Three  hundred  and  twenty  five  kilograms  of  freshly  plucked lavender  spikes  were  charged  into  the  still,  through  the  charging hole.   Then the charging hole was tightened.     The process was best started  with  steam  of  low  pressure  (saturated  steam)  with  rapid distillation,  followed by steam of higher pressure towards the end of the distillation.   The water below the false bottom   was drained off from time to time through the spent water outlet to control the   ester aaponification  to  increase  the  ester  value  which  is  the  main constituent    in quality determination.    The uniqueness in the system was the steam inside the steam jacket prevented the condensation of any steam within the still and maintained the quality of lavender oil.<br>
The  vapour  evolved  from  the  still  was  condensed  in  the horizontally fixed condenser (23) and the distillate was collected in the  receiver-cum-separator  (17)  through  distillate  carrier  line  (19). The process was  continued for  3| hours.    The oil  settled  in the receiver-cum-separator  (17)  was  separated,  dried,  weighed  and  then stored in aluminum bottles. The recovery of the oil was 1.4%.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Water distillation of celery seed oil:<br>
Three hundred kilograms  of  celery seeds were  churned with 1200 lit of cold water in churning tank till the slurry of seeds and water formed.   The churning was done with the mechanical stirrer, driven by an electric motor.   The time for churning was about an hour.   The slurry of seeds was soaked for 12 hrs. The slurry was transferred to distillation still with the help of slurry pump.   After the slurry was fed into the distillation still, the whole mass was heated by indirect steam to effect the distillation.   Once the distillation started,  the temperature inside the still is maintained at 95 °  C by controlling indirect steam.   During the process of distillation the live steam was injected into the slurry within the still for a period of 5 minutes at an interval of 30 minutes.<br>
The  oil  vapours  along  with  the  steam  passes  through  the cohobation column,  then to the condenser where the mixture of vapours were cooled to a temperature of 20 to 25 °  C in order to avoid the congealing of the lighter fraction of the oil,  which distill  over at first.  360 lit.  of distillate was collected in 8 hours.    The oil settled in the receiver above the distillate was separated.   The water traces in the separated oil were removed by the addition of   sodium sulphate.   The oil is then decanted from sodium sulphate and stored in prescribed bottles. The recovery of the oil was 2.1%.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are :<br>
1.	This  improved distillation unit enables  the unique	distillation<br>
process  employing  a  synergistic  combination  of  water  and  steam<br>
distillation  and  steam  distillation  which  significantly	enhances  the<br>
rose oil recovery and its quality on commercial scale.<br>
2.	The distillation unit can be used for any one or more of the<br>
hydrodistillation  techniques  viz.,  water  distillation,  water  and  steam<br>
distillation and steam distillation.<br>
3.	This distillation unit has the unique advantage that the flowers<br>
do not need to be comninute before charging.   Thus, saving time and<br>
money as wel1.<br>
4.	The built-in cohobation column helps in getting   70 to 80% of<br>
the  total  essential  oil  as  decanted/first  oil.    Qualitatively,  the<br>
decanted or direct oil is better than water oil or redistilled oil.<br>
5.	Tubular oil  separator specifically designed for better  rose oil<br>
separation, helps in retaining the rose oil in tubes by virtue of its<br>
surface tension and adhesive forces, from rose water.<br>
6.	The    provision  of  heating  elements  inside	the  still  allows<br>
heating  of  charged water	before steam injection.	Thereby minimises<br>
the condensation of steam,  thus maintaining essential  oil  quality by<br>
avoiding dilution effect.<br>
7.	A	perforated steam coil/spurger   helps in passing live	steam to<br>
transfer	its  latent heat  directly to the aromatic botanical	without<br>
forming	agglutinates and eliminating the problems of  charring	of  rose<br>
flowers	which  is  important  in  maintaining  the  quality  of  essential<br>
oil.<br>
8.	The chargeable quantity in the still  is about 25% more in this<br>
steam based distillation unit  compared with direct  fired distillation<br>
unit.<br><br><br><br><br>
