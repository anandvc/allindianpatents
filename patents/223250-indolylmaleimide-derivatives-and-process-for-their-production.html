Indolvlmaleimide Derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to indolylmaleimide derivatives, process for their production and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
More particularly the present invention provides a compound of formula I<br><br>
R1 is piperazin-1 -yl optionally substituted by CH3 in position 3 or 4; or 4,7-diaza-spiro [2.5] oct-7-yl;<br>
R2 is CI; Br; CF3; or CH3; and<br>
Rs is H; CH3; or CF3; R2 being other than CH3 or CI when R3 is H, Ra is H or CH3, Rb is<br><br>
R4 is 1 -piperazinyl substituted in positions 3 and/or 4 by CH3; or 4,7-diaza-spiro [2.5] oc±-7-yl; R2 being other than H or CH3 when R4 is 4-methyl-1-piperazinyl; or<br><br><br>
3 by methyl or ethyl and optionally In position 4 by methyl.<br>
The compounds of formula I may exist in free form or in salt form, e.g. addition salts with e.g. organic or Inorganic acids, for example, hydrochloric acid, acetic add, trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compounds of formula I may exist in the form of optical isomers, racemates or diastereoisomers. For example, a ring carbon atom bearing a substltuent in the position 3 of the piperazinyl residue Is asymmetric and may have the R- or S- configuration. It is to be understood that the present Invention embraces all enantiomers and their mixtures. Enantiomers are preferred over racemates. Similar considerations apply in relation to starting materials exhibiting asymmetric carbon atoms as mentioned.<br><br>
Alkyl or alkoxy may be straight or branched. Phenyl-C1-4alkyl is preferably benzyl or phenethyl. In C1-4alkoxy-C1-4alkyl the alkoxy moiety is preferably methoxy or ethoxy and the alkyl moiety preferably methyl or ethyl; a suitable example is e.g. 2-methoxyethyl. Halogen may be F, CI, Br or I, preferably F, CI or Br. Halogeno-C1-4alkyl is alkyl wherein one or more H are replaced by halogen, e.g. CI or F, e.g. CH2CI, CH2F or CF3<br>
R is preferably a radical of formula (a), (c) or (e), preferably (e).<br>
In the radical of formula (a) or (c), R2 or R15 is preferably in para to R1 or R14, respectively. R3<br>
is preferably in meta to Ri. In the radical or formula (e), R9 is preferably 4,7-diaza-spiro [2.5]<br><br>
and, where required, converting the resulting compound of formula I obtained in free form to a salt form or vice versa, as appropriate.<br>
The process may conveniently be effected in the presence of a strong base, e.g. t-BuOK, e.g. as disclosed in WO02/38561, the contents of which being incorporated herein by reference, and as illustrated in the Examples.<br>
Compounds of formula II and III may be prepared in accordance with known methods, e.g. as disclosed in WO02/38561, the contents of which being incorporated herein by reference, and as illustrated in the Examples.<br>
Insofar as the production of the starting materials Is not particularly described, the compounds are known or may be prepared analogously to methods known in the art or as described hereafter.<br><br><br>

The two-way MLR is performed according to standard procedures (J. Immunol. Methods, 1973, 2. 279 and Meo T. et al., Immunological Methods, New York, Academic Press, 1979, 227-39). Briefly, spleen cells from CBA and BALB/c mice (1.6x10^ cells from each strain per well in flat bottom tissue culture microtiter plates, 3.2 x 10^ in total) are incubated in RPMI medium containing 10% PCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100//g/ml streptomycin (Gibco BRL, Basel, Switzerland), 50/vM 2-mercaptoethanol (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and serially diluted compounds. Seven three-fold dilution steps in duplicates per test compound are performed. After four days of incubation 1 pCi 1H-thymidine is added. Cells are harvested after an additional five-hour incubation period, and incorporated 1H-thymidine is determined according to standard procedures. Background values (low control) of the MLR are the proliferation of BALB/c cells alone. Low controls are subtracted from all values. High controls without any sample are taken as 100% proliferation. Percent inhibition by the samples is calculated, and the concentrations required for 50% inhibition (IC50 values) are determined. In this assay. Compound of Example 29 has an IC50 of 28 nM.

B.     In vivo<br>
Rat Heart transplantation<br>
The strain combination used: Male Lewis (RT^ haplotype) and BN (RT^ haplotype). The animals are anaesthetised using inhalational isofluorane. Following heparinisation of the donor rat through the abdominal inferior vena cava with simultaneous exsanguination via the aorta, the chest is opened and the heart rapidly cooled. The aorta is ligated and divided distal to the first branch and the brachiocephalic trunk is divided at the first bifurcation. The left pulmonary artery is ligated and divided and the right side divided but left open. All other vessels are dissected free, ligated and divided and the donor heart is removed into iced saline.<br>
The recipient is prepared by dissection and cross-clamping of the infra-renal abdominal aorta and vena cava. The graft is implanted with end-to-side anastomoses, using 10/0 monofilament suture, between the donor brachiocephalic trunk and the recipient aorta and the donor right pulmonary artery to the recipient vena cava. The clamps are removed, the graft tethered retroabdominally, the abdominal contents washed with warm saline and the animal is closed and allowed to recover under a heating lamp. Graft survival is monitored by daily palpation of the beating donor heart through the abdominal wall. Rejection is considered to be complete when heart beat stops. Increases of graft survival are obtained in animals treated with a compound of formula I administered orally at a daily dose of 1 to 30 mg/kg bid.<br>
Graft V. Host Model<br>
Spleen cells (2x10^) from Wistar/F rats are injected subcutaneously into the right hind footpad of (Wistar/F x Fischer 344)Fi hybrid rats. The left footpad is left untreated. The animals are treated with the test compounds on 4 consecutive days (0-3). The popliteal lymph nodes are removed on day 7, and the weight differences between two corresponding lymph nodes are determined. The results are expressed as the inhibition of lymph node enlargement (given in percent) comparing the lymph node weight differences in the experimental groups to the weight difference between the corresponding lymph nodes from<br><br>
a group of animals left untreated with a test compound. In this assay, an inhibition of 100% is obtained with compound of Example 29 when administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day bid.<br>
The compounds of formula I are, therefore, useful in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases or disorders mediated by T lymphocytes and/or PKC, e.g. acute or chronic rejection of organ or tissue alio- or xenografts, graft versus host diseases, atherosclerosis, vascular occlusion due to vascular injury such as angioplasty, restenosis, obesity, syndrome X, impaired glucose tolerance, polycystic ovary syndrome, hypertension, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CNS diseases such as Alzheimer disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cancer, infectious diseases such as AIDS, septic shock or adult respiratory distress syndrome, ischemia/reperfusion injury e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, gut ischemia, renal failure or hemorrhage shock, or traumatic shock, e.g. traumatic brain injury. The compounds of formula I are also useful in the treatment and/or prevention of T-cell mediated acute or chronic inflammatory diseases or disorders or autoimmune diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto's thyroidis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, diabetes type I or II and the disorders associated therewith, e.g. angiopathy, diabetic proliferative retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, nephropathy, neuropathy and dawn phenomenon, respiratory diseases such as asthma or inflammatory lung injury, inflammatory liver injury, inflammatory glomerular injury, cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated disorders or illnesses, inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases (such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis and further eczematous dermatitises, seborrhoeic dermatitis), inflammatory eye diseases, e.g. Sjoegren's syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis or uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. For the above uses the required dosage will of course vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired. In general, satisfactory results are indicated to be obtained systemically at daily dosages of from about 0.1 to about 100 mg/kg body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, e.g. humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 2000 mg, conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in retard form.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be administered by any conventional route, in particular enterally, e.g. orally, e.g. in the form of tablets or capsules, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions, topically, e.g. in the form of lotions, gels, ointments or creams, or in a nasal or a suppository form. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form in association<br><br>
with at least one pharmaceutical acceptable carrier or diluent may be manufactured In conventional manner by mixing with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Unit dosage forms for oral administration contain, for example, from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg of active substance.<br>
