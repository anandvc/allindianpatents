OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved sand mould air impact or blast compacting machine, which machine has been substantially improved, specifically as regards its valve system to relate the compressed air-containing bell to the diffuser which projects air towards the sand mass, directly or with impact rams in between<br>
Accordingly, the invention is aimed at improving the functional features of the release valve, improving the compacting conditions and generally improving the functionality and versatility of the machine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Air impact sandbox moulding machines exist that use a release valve located between the bell and the diffuser, comprising a rigid disc or plate that is kept in the closed position by action of the excess . existing in a chamber in which said plate operate and hence upon the overpressure in such chamber disappearing, the accumulated air in the bell is capable of displacing the same to the open position, brusquely entering the diffuser and hitting the sand. Upon air under a greater pressure being again introduced in said chamber, in which the release valve operates the latter moves back towards the closed position.<br>
This solution results in brusque impacts and consequently noises when the closed position changes to the open position, but most importantly, after the release, the residual air has to be delivered through side ducts provided in the frame or close to the mouth of the diffuser, and thus its delivery causes sand particles to be dragged that significantly damage the machine because they are extremely abrasive.<br><br>
-2-<br>
Another known solution consists of using butterfly valves which, being of the mechanic kind, have a slow opening or closing response and the residual air must, as in the previous case, be removed through side ducts provided in the frame, with the same problems aforesaid.<br>
A more advanced solution is described in patent 8800859, which consists of using a highly elastic membrane as a delivery valve, solidly attached by means of two annular concentric flanges to a supporting plate within the bell body, thereby for a tightly sealed annular chamber to be configured between the membrane and its support, to which compressed air supply duct has access, which membrane is operatively placed facing a narrow annular seat and thus, when idle, an annular passage is established between the membrane and the seat, whereas when said annular chamber is pressurized , the membrane is deformed and sealed tightly against its seat<br>
The main drawback of this solution, which it shares with the<br>
preceding cases, is a reduction in compaction about the outer mould contour, or in other words, the inner moulding box contour. Deflectors<br>
are generally used to solve this problem, directing the air current towards the corners or edges of the moulding box, but this results in a substantial loss of efficiency and demands that very high impact pressures have to be applied to achieve effective compaction on the edges of the box.<br>
Another solution to improve compaction of mould contour is described in patent 8803220, in which the air impact moulding machine is provided with a sand-supplying hopper axially located within the air release bell, and therefore both elements have direct access into the moulding chamber, the air outlet area from the bell being provided with a tube-shaped membrane valve that is axially deformed to open or close the passage of compacting air from the bell towards the sand mould In addition to being more complicated due to the inclusion of the sand loading hopper at its central area, this machine moreover fully prevents<br><br>
-3-<br>
the use of ancillary compacting systems, such as hydraulic rams for instance<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved sand mould air impact or blast compacting machine, of the kind having a compressed air drum that is capable of delivering air through a diffuser onto a moulding box for sand" housed within the same to be compacted, characterised in that a peripheral passage is provided right before the diffuser for air to be delivered, with a' membrane connected to a valve body operating within the same, said membrane being solidly attached through its edge portions to the valve body in order to define an enveloping chamber that is pressurised to deform the tubular membrane towards a valve seat provided in a core that defines an inner wall of the peripheral passage, the arrangement being such that when pressure is lost in the enveloping chamber, most of the blowing air is delivered at the periphery of the moulding box.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The sand mould air impact or blast compacting machine subject of the invention fully overcomes the above-mentioned drawbacks inasmuch as it allows air to be directed straight to the outer mould periphery or contour, i e the area where compacting is most effective, moreover leaving the central machine area clear, thereby to allow the inclusion of ancillary compacting means in such area, such as hydraulic rams or impact rams for instance.<br>
To such end, and starting with the conventional construction of a machine of this kind based upon a pressure drum and a diffuser that channels the jet of air towards the moulding box, the primary features of the machine subject hereof lie in that a valve body having a generally square or rectangular contour, to which the diffuser is m turn coupled, is coupled to the mouth of the drum, through a supporting frame, a membrane being established within this valve body made up of four independent sectors tightly fixed to the valve body through the marginal areas thereof, an enveloping chamber being hence established outside such membrane, capable of inwardly deforming the same to establish a tight seal over the respective valve seat, when the pressure within such enveloping chamber is suitable, whereas in the absence of said pressure the tubular membrane is no longer deformed as before, and clears a peripheral passage established between the valve body and a central core, in which said valve seat is established, which largely closes the bottom of the drum.<br>
In accordance with this construction, during the blowing stage, air reaches the diffuser and hence the moulding box as an annular, perimetnc curtain, in a direction largely parallel to the drum axis, and the blowing pressure is thus at a maximum at the marginal or perimetric mould area.<br><br>
5<br>
In addition, the valve leaves the central or core machine area,<br>
where the residual air outlet is established, absolutely clear, which also<br>
allows ancillary compacting means, such as hydraulic rams, to be<br>
established	<br><br>
The machine of the invention allows ancillary compacting means to be fitted, consisting of impact rams such as are described in patent 9600122. To such end, a pan-shaped body, whose inner wall stands as a travelling guide for a rubber or metal plate lying on the heads of the impact rams, is coupled to the bottom of the diffuser, and therefore the air impact does not act directly on the sand but on the plate that in turn pushes the rams to compact the sand. With the valve system proposed herein, the air through the peripheral passage acts mostly on the outer contour of the plate and hence on the heads of the rams provided on the periphery, thereby for compacting of the sand to be very effective at both the central and peripheral areas.<br>
In a different embodiment, instead of having a single closing and opening valve, four valves are provided to act independently on the four membrane sectors, which four valves will therefore act concurrently to achieve a total synchronism of the membrane sectors, in their closing and opening movements, and hence a uniform distribution of the compressed air and thus an optimum operation of the machine<br>
In this different embodiment, the membrane sectors are designed to be he directly on the walls of the valve body, which has been found to lessen the noise and results in a longer service life of said membranes, for they must be moved over shorter distances to serve their function.<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to these figures and in particular figure 1, the machine subject hereof can be seen to be constructed, as any mould compacting machine of this kind, with a drum (1), capable of storing a sufficient quantity of compressed air, in order that, when its valve is opened, a blast of air is released through the diffuser (2) to the moulding box (3) carrying the pattern (4) and the sand mass (5), which are suitable for the part to be obtained and attachable to and detachable from said diffuser (2), by means of a lifting mechanism (6), which is not shown<br>
Now then, from this basic and conventional construction, the improvements of the invention are focused on the fact that the valve device comprises a valve body (7) having a generally square or rectangular contour, matching that of the moulding box (3), the bottom end of which is fixed to the diffuser (2), whereas the top end is fixed, with the assistance of a supporting frame (8), to the mouth (9) of the drum (1), the diffuser (2) and the supporting frame (8) having facing wings for the attachment, using screws (10) or any other suitable means, of the four marginal areas constituting the valve membrane (11), in order that between such membrane (11) and the valve support (7) an enveloping chamber (12) is established to which a suitable pressure is applied, through a duct (13), in order for the membrane (11) to be deformed against the seat (14) defined in an inner core (15) that largely closes the base of the drum (1) and which, together with the supporting frame (8), the actual valve body (7) and the bottom diffuser (2), defines a peripheral passage (16) for air, from the drum (1) to the moulding box (3), through said diffuser (2).<br>
As shown in the operative sequences of figure 2 and starting with the first of such sequences, in which the moulding box (3) is shown detached from the machine, a rising movement thereof, in accordance with the second sequence of said figure, causes the moulding box (3) to be tightly coupled to the diffuser (2) At this time, the existing pressure in the enveloping chamber (12) is delivered, thereby for the tubular<br><br>
-8-<br>
membrane (11) to move away from the seat (14), causing the valve to open and consequently a brusque delivery to take place from the drum (1), thereby for the blowing air arriving through the diffuser (2), to the moulding box (5), to hit its marginal or penmetric area, as shown in the third sequence of said figure 2. When the blowing stage is over, the moulding box (3) is detached from the machine, as shown in the fourth and final sequence of figure 2, thereafter to eliminate therefrom the respective finished sand mould.<br>
In addition to allowing optimum blowing conditions to be obtained, as described hereinbefore, and since the air passage (16).is provided facing the marginal or perimetnc area of the moulding box, the above-described construction moreover leaves the central machine area absolutely clear, and therefore the residual outlet duct (17) will be located in that area, and the diffuser (2) may at the same time be fixed, with a pan-shaped support (18) located between it and the moulding box (3), for a group of impact rams (19), such as are shown in figure 3, or the actual core (15) may be used as a support for a plurality of additional hydraulic compacting rams (20), as shown in figure 5.<br>
In a different embodiment, as shown in figures 6 and 7, each valve support sector (7) has been designed to have a valve (21), the outlet (22) of which leads directly onto the respective membrane sector (11), the foregoing such that if said valves (21) act simultaneously, the membrane sectors (11) will also work simultaneously, which results in an optimum operation of the machine.<br><br>
