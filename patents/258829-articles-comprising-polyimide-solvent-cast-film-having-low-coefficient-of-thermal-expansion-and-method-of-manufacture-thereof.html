CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims priority to copending U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/805,821, filed June 26, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a solvent cast film comprising a polyimide and methods for the manufacture of such films. The film is formed by polymerization of a dianhydride component and a diamine component, and has a Tg of between 180°C and 450°C, specifically 190°C or greater, and wherein the film has: a) a CTE of less than 70 ppm/°C, specifically less than 60 ppm/°C; b) a thickness of 0.1 micrometers and 250 micrometers, specifically 5 to 250 micrometers; and, c) contains less than 5% residual solvent by weight.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thermoplastic sheets and films have a broad range of applications. For instance, thermoplastic films and sheets can be found in automotive applications, electronic applications, military applications, appliances, industrial equipment, and furniture.<br>
Thermoplastic sheets and film can be reinforced or non-reinforced, porous or nonporous and can comprise a single thermoplastic or multiple thermoplastics. When a thermoplastic sheet or film comprises multiple thermoplastics it may be as a blend, as layers, or both.<br>
One important use of films is their use as substrates, or coatings on, flexible circuit applications. In order to serve in this role a new film should meet two requirements critical for flexible circuit substrates, namely low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and high temperature survivability (especially when a high temperature fabrication step is employed).<br>
Low CTE is necessary to match, as closely as possible, the CTE of copper (CTE = 17 ppm/°C). This keeps the film from curling upon temperature change when the film is a substrate for a copper layer, or copper circuit traces. Low CTE also prevents unmatched changes in dimension between the copper and subsfrate layers upon thermal cycling, which increases the lifetime of the final flexible circuit by reducing stress and fatigue on the patterned copper traces. In other words, the properties of flexible circuit boards are benefited when their film substrate and applied conductive metal layer expand and contract at the same rate. When these layers don't expand and contract at the same rate issues regarding the adherence, and orientation of the layers can and do arise. While a CTE of less than 70 ppm/°C, specifically less than 60 ppm/°C, even more specifically less than 30 ppm/°C will allow low warpage upon thermal cycling and is a common goal, better results will be achieved as the CTE of the film becomes closer to the CTE of copper.<br>
A TMA or Thermomechanical Analysis tests CTE. The dimension change of a film sample is determined as a function of temperature, and from the slope of this change, the CTE is calculated. Typically, the CTE must be measured for the temperature range that the film is expected to see during flex circuit processing. A temperature range of 20 to 250°C is a reasonable temperature range for determination of the CTE.<br>
High temperature survivability can also be an important property for the substrate film to survive the soldering process durmg flex circuit fabrication. The film should exhibit survivability for short periods at elevated temperatures of, for example, 260°C for new lead-free soldering processes. The standard test for temperature survivability is the solder float test, where a small piece of film is affixed to a cork and is immersed for 10 seconds in molten solder. The film is then removed, the solder is wiped off, and the film is examined. If there is any visible warpage or bubbling, the film fails the test. While there is not a standard thickness for this test, the minimum thickness at which the film passes the solder float test can be reported. Temperatures of 260°C and 288°C are standard solder float temperatures for lead-eutectic and lead-free solders, respectively.<br>
Low CTE and high temperature resistance requirements for flexible circuit substrates have been addressed through the use of polyimide films. Many commercial polyimide (PI) films have a high glass transition temperature (greater than 350°C), and can be partially crosslinked, giving exceptional temperature survivability. The polymer molecules in these films are stressed slightly as they are produced, leading to alignment of the polymer molecules and giving PI films a low CTE. Since the films never see temperatures above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the material, the stress is never able to relax and the films are dimensionally stable at flex fabrication temperatures.<br>
As thermoplastic sheets and films are used in an increasmg wide array of applications the need for thermoplastic sheets and films that can withstand elevated temperatures for appropriate periods of time without substantial degradation is growing. There is a continuing need for films having: a) a CTE under seventy ppm/°C, specifically under thirty ppm/°C and as close to the CTE of copper as technically possible; and b) high thermal survivability.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As thermoplastic sheets and films Eire used in the specification and the claims which follow, reference will be made to a number of terras which shall be defined to have the following meanings. The singular forms "a," "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art. Compounds are described using standard nomenclature.<br>
Other than in the operating examples or where otherwise indicated, all mmibers or expressions referring to quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and the like, used in the specification and claims are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term "about." The term "combination thereof means that one or more of the listed components is present, optionally together with one or more like components not listed. Various numerical ranges are disclosed in this patent application. Because these ranges are continuous, they include every value between the minimum and maximum values. Unless expressly indicated otherwise, the various numerical ranges specified in this application are approximations. The endpoints of all ranges directed to the same component or property are inclusive of the endpoint and independently combinable.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, a "film" is a flat section of thermoplastic resin or other material that is extremely thin in comparison to its length and breadth.<br>
The term "casting" refers to a process of molding or forming wherein impressions are made with fluent or molten materials as by pouring into a mold or onto a sheet with hardening or setting of said material in said mold or on said sheet.<br>
A "solvent cast film" is a fikn formed through the casting of fluids on a forming surface to form a sheet or web with removal of solvent from the cast liquid.<br>
All ASTM tests and data are from the 1991 edition of the Annual Book of ASTM Standards unless otherwise indicated.<br>
"Coefficient of thermal expansion" is the increment in volume of a unit volume of polymer for a rise of temperature of 1°C at constant pressure. For the present invention CTE measurements were performed by thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) with a thermal ramp rate of 5°C/minute. Test specimen dimensions were 23 mm in length by 5 mm in width. Test specimens were subjected to a first heat from 0°C to 250°C at 5°C/min heating rate and CTE values were determined under a force of 0.05 Newtons from the slope of length change over the temperature range from 30°C to 200°C.<br>
"Chemical resistance" is the ability of solid materials to resist damage by chemical reactivity or solvent action, and can be determined in accordance with ASTM Test D543-06<br>
"Dielectric Constant" (permittivity constant): between any two electrically charged bodies there is a force (attraction or repulsion) that varied according to the strength of the charges, ql and q2, the distance between the bodies, r, and a characteristic of the medium separating the bodies (the dielectric) known as the dielectric constant, . This force is given by the equation:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
"Flexural Modulus" (flex modulus) is the ratio, within the elastic limit, of the applied stress in the outermost fibers of a test specimen in three-point, static flexure, to the calculated strain in those outermost fibers, and can be determined according to ASTM Test D790 or D790M.<br><br>
"Flexural Strength" (flexural modulus of rupture) is the maximum calculated stress in the outermost fibers of a test bar subjected to three-point loading at the moment of cracking or breaking. ASTM Test D 790 and D 790M are widely used for measuring this property. For most plastics, flexural strength is usually substantially higher than the straight tensile strength.<br>
"Glass Transition" is a reversible change that occurs in an amorphous polymer or in amorphous regions of a partly crystalline polymer when it is heated from a very low temperature into a certain range, peculiar to each polymer, characterized by a rather sudden change from a hard, glassy, or brittle condition to a flexible or elastomeric condition. Physical properties such as coefficient of thermal expansion, specific heat, and density, usually undergo changes in their temperature derivatives at the same time. During the transition, the molecular chains, normally coiled, tangled, and motionless at the lower temperatures, become free to rotate and slip past each other.<br>
"Glass Transition Temperature" (Tg) is the approximate midpoint of the temperature range over which the glass transition occurs. Tg is not obvious (like a melting point), and is detected by changes, with rising temperature, in secondary properties such as the rate of change with temperature of specific volume or electrical or mechanical properties. Moreover, the observed Tg can vary significantly with the specific property chosen for observation and on experimental details such as the rate of heating or electrical frequency. A reported Tg should therefore be viewed as an estimate. The most reliable estimates are normally obtained from the loss peak in dynamic-mechanical tests or from dilatometric data. For purposes of the present invention, the glass transition temperature (Tg) is determined by the maximum point of the tan delta curve. Tg can also be determined by the inflection of the DSC (Differential Scaning Calorimetry) trace (ASTM Test D3148).<br>
"Melting Temperature" (hereafter identified by its symbol "Tm") is the temperature at which the thermal energy in a solid material is sufficient to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction in the crystalline lattice so that the lattice breaks down and the material becomes a liquid, i.e. it melts. According to the present invention the Tm is measured according to ASTM test D3148.<br>
"Melt Viscosity" is the resistance to shear in a molten resin, quantified as the quotient of shear stress divided by shear rate at any point in the flowing material. Elongational viscosity, which comes into play in the drawing of extrudates, is analogously defined. In polymers, the viscosity depends not only on temperature and, less strongly, on pressure, but also on the level of shear stress (or shear rate). For purposes of the present invention melt viscosity is determined at 380°C as measured by capillary rheology according to ASTM D3835.<br>
"Moisture Absorption" is the pickup of water vapor by a material upon exposure for a definite time interval in an atmosphere of specified humidity and temperature. No ASTM test exists for this property. Moisture absorption at 50% relative humidity and by immersion in water is measured by weight gain.<br>
"Tensile Modulus" or "Modulus of Elasticity" is the ratio of nominal tensile stress to the corresponding elongation below the proportional limit of the material. The relevant ASTM test is D638.<br>
"Tensile Strength" is the maximum nominal stress sustained by a test specimen being pulled from both ends, at a specified temperature and at a specified rate of stretching. When the maximum nominal stress occurs at the Yield Point it shall be designated tensile strength at yield. When it occurs at break, it shall be designated tensile strength at break. The ASTM test for plastics is D638 (metric, D638M). The SI unit of tensile strength is the pascal (N/m2).<br>
Gallery spacing or d-spacing is the distance between the various microplates that make up a nanosilicate (synonymous with nano-clay, nano clay, or nanoclay). The changes in the gallery spacing appear to be dependent on the composition of the modified nanosilicate and the solvent.<br>
"Intercalate" refers to a process by which the d-spacing is increased by the incorporation of a modifier, solvent, or a polymer between the plates. A modified nano clay has a d-spacing that is greater than that for the same unmodified nano clay.<br>
"Exfoliate" refers to the complete separation of the plates that make up the clay structure. Sometimes there is incomplete exfoliation to smaller structures that have multiple plate that are called tactoids.<br>
"Polyamic acid solution" (also known as poly-amide-acid, poly(amic acid), amic acid, polyamicacid, poly (amic acid), poly(amide acid), poly(amic) acid, poly(amide-acid), or polyamic-acid) is a solution containing amic acid units that have the capability of reacting with surrounding organic moieties to form imide groups.<br>
"Polyimide" as used herein refers to polymers comprising repeating imide functional groups, and optionally additional functional groups such as amides and/or ethers. "Polyimide" accordingly includes within its scope poly amide imides and polyetherimides.<br>
The term "inerted" means that the atmosphere in a container is replaced with an inert gas, such as for example, nitrogen.<br>
"Recycle" means that all or a part of the polymer according to the present invention can be re-used for the original utility for which the polymer was made. For example, if the original use of the polymer as a solvent cast film for a flexible circuit board, all or part of the polymer can be recycled and be re-dissolved in solvent with or without the use of additional monomer or polymer. Recycle can also mean that the polymer can be re-used either in part or completely by another reprocessing method into another utility such as an injected molded part.<br>
When structural units of chemical moieties are said to be formally derived from a precursor moiety herein, there is no implied limitation on the actual chemical reaction which may be used to produce the chemical moiety. For example when a chemical moiety such as a polyetherimide is said to have structural units formally derived from a dianhydride and a diamine, then any known method could be used to prepare the polyetherimide, including reaction of a dianhydride and a diamine, or a displacement reaction between a phenoxide species and an imide bearing a displaceable group, or other known method, it only being necessary that the chemical moiety comprise structural units which may be represented in the stated precursor moiety.<br>
The present disclosure is directed to solvent cast films comprising a dianhydride component and a diamine component and having a Tg of between 180°C and 450°C, specifically 190°C or greater, and wherein the film has: a) a CTE of less than 70 ppm/°C, specifically less than 60 ppm/°C; b) a thickness of between 5 micrometers and 250 micrometers, specifically 0.1 to 250 micrometers; and, c) contains less than 5% residual solvent by weight.<br>
The solvent cast film according to the present invention can be made of at least one polyimide have a Tg of betweenl80°C and 450°C. In another embodiment, the polyimide has a Tg of 190°C or greater, specifically 190°C to 500°C, more specifically 190°C to 400°C. The skilled artisan will appreciate that the Tg of any particular polyimide can vary widely depending upon factors including the choice of dianhydride monomer, the number of different dianhydride monomers (structures as opposed to units), the choice of diamine monomer, the number of different diamine moilomers (structures as opposed to units), processing conditions during production of the film, type of imidization process used to cure the polymer, etc. The skilled artisan will appreciate the ability to create a polymer having a desired Tg anywhere within the aforementioned range of Tg's, depending on the monomers used, the use of endcapping, etc.<br>
The type of polyimide making up the film is similarly variable. The present invention specifically includes random and block polymers and co-polymers in all combinations of the one or more dianhydride and the one or more diamine from which the present polyimides can be made. More than one type of polyimide can be present, for example a combination of a polyamideimide and a polyetherimide, or two different kinds of polyetherimide. Also, the present invention is directed to solvent cast films comprising one or more polyimide films that includes other polymers selected from the group consisting of amorphous thermoplastic polymers including PPSU (polyphenylene sulfone), PSU (polysulfone), PC (polycarbonate), PPO (polyphenylene ether), PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene terpolymer), PS (polystyrene), PVC (polyvinylchloride), crystalline thermoplastic resins including PFA (perfluoro alkoxy alkane), MFA (co-polymer of TFE (tetrafluoroethylene) and PFVE (perfluorinated vinyl ether)), PEP (fluorinated<br>
ethylene propylene polymers), PPS (polyphenylene sulfide), PEK (polyether ketone), PEEK (polyether-ether ketone), ECTFE (ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymer), PVDF(polyvinylidene fluoride), PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), PET (polyethylene terephthalate), POM (polyacetal), PA (polyamide), UHMW-PE (ultra high molecular weight polyethylene), PP (polypropylene), PE (polyethylene), HDPE (high density polyethylene), LDPE (low density polyethylene), and advanced engineering resins such as PBI (polybenzimidazole), poIy(ether sulfone), poly(aryl sulfone), polyphenylene ethers, polybenzoxazoles, and polybenzothiazoles, as well as blends and co-polymers thereof.<br>
Measured CTE's of the films may be an inherent property of the material by virtue of the materials chemical make-up. Alternatively, the CTE may be significantly lower than the inherent CTE of the film material through the use of additives and or by the performance of additional processing steps. The CTE of the solvent cast film can be any CTE which is below 70 ppm/°C, specifically below 60 ppm/°C, and allows the film to function in its intended utility. For example, for a flexible circuit board the CTE can be close enough to that of the adjacent metallic conductive layer that the film is capable of serving its intended utility as a dielectric substrate, a layer in a laminate and/or a covering for a flexible circuit board. In separate embodiments, the CTE is less than 70 ppm/°C, less than 50 ppm/°C, less than 40 ppm/°C, less than 35 ppm/°C, less than 30 ppm/°C, or less than 20 ppm/°C. According to other embodiments, the film has a CTE of at least 5 ppm/°C. The film can also have a CTE of 5 to 60 ppm/°C, and more specifically the coefficient of thermal expansion is 10 ppm/°C to 30 ppm/°C, and even more specifically 10 ppm/°C to 20 ppm/°C.<br>
Alternatively, the CTE of the film is adjusted to match a substrate material on which it is disposed. In one embodiment, the film has a CTE that is within +20 ppm/°C of the CTE of copper, silicon, aluminum, gold, silver, nickel, a glass, a ceramic, or a polymer, specifically within +20 ppm/°C of the CTE of copper, silicon, aluminum, gold, silver, or nickel. In another embodiment, the film has a CTE that is within +15 ppm/°C of the coefficient of thermal expansion of copper, silicon, aluminum, gold, silver, or nickel, specifically copper.<br>
In an advantageous feature, it has been found that the CTE of the films is very stable. For example, the film after lamination to a substrate at a temperature from 250 to 450°C has a CTE within +10 ppm/°C of the CTE of the film prior to lamination.<br>
The thickness of the films can vary widely depending upon the end use application, the method of making the film, the solids contents of the casting solution, to name a few of the subject parameters. The thickness may vary from 0.1 micrometers up to 10,000 micrometers, or more particularly from 5 micrometers up to 1,000 micrometers, however it is expected that for use in flexible circuit boards the most likely thickness will be between 0.1 micrometers and 250 micrometers.<br>
The final solvent cast film may contain residual solvent and still be capable of functioning for its intended purpose. The minimum amount of residual solvent will be the most residual solvent content under which the film will still fiunction for its intended utility. One the other hand, the solvent cast films may also contain as low a residual solvent content as is possible to achieve. For example, solvent is expensive and can be an environmental hazard. Both a cost savings and an improvement of environmental conditions may be achieved by minimizing the amounts of solvent contained in final product. The residual solvent content will be less than 5% of the total weight of the film. In another embodiment, the amount of residual solvent will be less than 1% of the total weight of the film.<br>
Solvents which can be used in the process include any solvent with which a solvent cast film may be made. The solvent can be a good solvent for polyimides, by for example, having a relatively high boiling to facilitate solution film formation or direct devolatization via extrusion. The solvent for film formation can be the same that is used to make the polyamic acid solution described below. Examples of suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, N-methyl pyrrolidinone(NMP), trichloroethane, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), N-methylpyrolidinone (NMP), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), sulfolane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), benzophenone, cyclohexanone, phenol, mixtures of o-, p- and m- cresols, mixtures of cresylic with phenol, ethylphenols, isopropylphenols, tert-butylphenols, xylenols, mesitols, chlorophenols,     dichlorophenols,     such     as     ortho-dichlorobenzene     (o-DCB),<br>
phenylphenols, a monoalkyl ether of ethylene glycol having from 1 to4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, a monoalkyl ether of diethylene glycol having from 1 to4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, a monoaryl ether glycol, a monoaryl ether of propylene glycol, N,N-dimethylformamide, tetramethylurea, phenoxy ethanol, propylene glycol phenyl ether, anisole, veratrole, o-dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, trichloroethane, methylene chloride, chloroform, pyridine, N-cyclohexylpyrrolidinone, ethyl lactate, an ionic liquid, and mixtures containing one or more of these solvents. Ionic liquids generally include salts having a melting point that is relatively low (below 100°C). Examples of ionic liquids include, but and are not limited to ammonium, imidazolium-, phosphonium-, pyridinium-, pyrrolidinium-, and sulfonium-based salts. Counter-ions in such liquids can include, but are not be limited to the following: bromides, chlorides, tetrafluoroborates, acetates, phosphates, carbonates, sulfates, methane sulfates, nitrates, thiocyanates, and combinations thereof.<br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that the specific solvent used is dependent on any number of factors including the solubility of the polyimide and the precursor monomers in a solvent, and the volatility of the solvent, for example.<br>
Solvent cast films according to the present invention may be made by any method known in the art. The following patents assigned to GE disclose generic methods of making solvent cast films and casting solutions: 4,115,341; 4,157,996; 4,307,226; 4,360,633; 4,374,972; and, 3,847,867. One manufacturing process can involve the following steps: forming a polyamic acid solution comprising the polyamic acid product of a monomer component comprising one or more dianhydrides and one or more organic diamines at least partially dissolved in a solvent system; casting the polyamic acid solution onto a substrate such that the polyamic acid solution takes on a form having a length, width and depth on the surface of the substrate; removing the solvent, and curing the polyamic acid solution to form a film having a CTE less than 70 ppm/°C, specifically less than 60 ppm/°C, and a thickness of from 0.5 micrometers to 250 micrometers, specifically 0.1 to 250 micrometers.<br>
Alternatively, the method can comprise making a solvent cast film comprising: preparing a casting solution comprising a polyamic acid solution made up of a<br>
monomer component the forms a polyamic acid, and a solvent component; casting a film of the casting solution on a support base; removing solvent from the cast film for a predetermined period of time to form a solvent cast polyimide film having a CTE less than 70 ppm/°C, specifically less than 60 ppm/°C and a thickness of between 5 micrometers and 250 micrometers, specifically between 0.1 and 250 micrometers; and conducting an additional process step on the solvent cast film to reduce the CTE of the film below 35 ppm/°C, specifically below30 ppm/°C.<br>
The polyamic acid solution may be prepared by mixing one or more dianhydride(s), water, and solvent as by stirring until the one or more dianhydride component is dissolved. Then the one or more monomeric diamine can be added and the solution stirred until the amines dissolve. The components which make up the dianhydride component and the diamine component may include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more different dianhydrides and diamines. The scope of the present invention is specifically intended to include all permutations, and combinations of the number and variety of dianhydride and diamine monomers. For example, in one embodiment, the polyamic acid solution will be made up of two different dianhydrides and two different diamines. In another embodiment, one of the one or more dianhydrides is ODPA.<br>
In general, the organic amine component may be included in an amount of from 0.5 mole to2.0 moles, or, more particularly, froml to 1.3 moles, per mole of dianhydride component. Where more than one compound is included in a component of the present solution, the parts, moles, or other quantity of such component is taken as the sum of the parts, moles, or such other quantity, respectively, of each compound included in such component. Thus, for example, total amine content is calculated by adding the equivalent amounts of each diamine in the amine component e.g., 2(number of moles of 1st diamine) + 2(number of moles of 2nd diamine) = total equivalents of amine.<br>
Total anhydride content is calculated in a similar fashion. A slight excess of amine can be used to impart additional film flexibility or possible cross-linking. It has been found that polyimide enamel can have from 5 to 500 repeating dianhydride-diamine<br>
reaction product units and preferably from 10 to 200. Terminal amino and phthalic acid or phthalic anhydride or various suitable end groups can also be present.<br>
Experience has shown that sufficient solvent should be utilized to provide a solids content to provide a solution with a workable viscosity for stirring and handling. In one embodiment, the solids content will be from 1-65% by weight. In other embodiments the solids content will be from 1-40%, 1-30 %, 1-25%, 1-15%, or 1-12.5% by weight.<br>
Solutions having high ratios of monomeric reactants to organic solvent component advantageously minimize the amount of organic solvent released during subsequent formation and cure of polyetherimide resins as in the manufacture of solvent cast film. Such solutions having high amounts of monomeric reactants may have higher viscosities than desired for some solvent cast fihns. Typically, inclusion of water decreases the solution viscosity. A given decrease in viscosity may be effected using a lower amount of added water relative to the amount of added organic solvent component which would be required to effect the same viscosity decrease.<br>
Water may or may not be a part of the polyamic acid solution. Water may be present in any amount up to the maximum amount at which the solution is substantially free of precipitate. Although water is miscible with the organic solvent component in substantially all proportions, inclusion of too much water in the present monomeric solution results in precipitate or other plural phase formation. The amount of water which may be present depends on the particular dianhydride and diamine components, the particular organic solvent component, and the weight ratio of monomeric reactants to organic solvent.<br>
Advantageously, the present polyamic acid solutions may include the monomeric reactants in a combined amount of 40 or more weight percent, e.g. from 40 to75 or more weight percent, based on the weight of the solution. In general, such high monomer content solutions, including water as may be required, have suitable viscosities in the temperature range, e.g., 15°C to 200°C, normally used to make solvent cast films.<br>
Solutions including water are more easily prepared by adding the monomeric reactant components with stirring to a solution of the water and organic solvent component. Preparation of the solution is generally accelerated at elevated temperatures.<br>
An additive can be added to the polyamic acid solutions in order to reduce the CTE below the CTE that the material would have without the additive. These additives include those which will aid in lowering the CTE of the solvent cast film, and those which can aid in producing another desirable property in the present films. These ingredients may be used in any amount to impart the desired property at proportions of from 0.001 to 60 parts of additive, per 100 parts by weight of polyimide. Alternatively these additives may be added in amounts from 0.01 to30 parts of additive, and more particularly from 0.1 to 10 parts of additive per 100 parts by weight of polyimide.<br>
The types of additives which can be employed to lower the CTE of a solvent cast polyimide film include modified nano-composite silicates (nanoclays) and soluble nano-particle precursors such as aluminum (acetylacetonoate)3.<br>
A nanoclay can be added directly to the polyamic acid composition after it is formed. It has also been found that polyimide can be readily solubilized in an exfoliated nanocomposite solution, and that exfoliation can be maintained after removal of the solvent by devolatization or precipitation into nonsolvent. The resulting polyimide-nanocomposite materials can be formed into films via solution casting or melt extrusion. The resulting films have high Tg and low CTE.<br>
Moreover, it has been found that polymerization of a diamine and dianhydride in the presence of organically modified nanosilicates results in good dispersion of the modified nanofiller. The nanofilled polyimide composite can be formed into films by melt extrusion or solution casting to give a low CTE, high Tg, polyimide film.<br>
Exfoliated nanoclays are most commonly used. Exfoliation, e.g., by sonication, is carried out in a solvent system. For example exfoliating is carried out in a composition comprising from 10 to 90% by weight of the nanoclay and from 10 to 90% by weight of the solvent system. Exfoliation can be performed before addition<br>
to the polyamic acid solution, after addition to the polyamic acid solution, or before reacting the dianhydride component and the organic diamine component in the solvent system. Alternatively, addition of a high molecular weight polymer to the exfoliated nanosilicate solution results in exfoliated high Tg nanocomposites. These materials can be formed into films by solution casting to give a low CTE polyimide film. In one embodiment homogenization of the modified nanosilicate in the selected solvent is followed by sonication. Sonication can be performed in either a batch or continuous process. In the batch process, the homogenized modified silicate/solvent mixture is placed in contact with the sonic source. The mixture is stirred well to ensure uniform sonication of the entire mixture. In the continuous process, the modified nanosilicate/solvent mixture is flowed through the sonic zone at a given rate. The modified nanosilicate/solvent mixture is stirred well to ensure a uniform dispersion of the nanosilicate. In either the batch or continuous process, the sonication conditions required for exfoliation (i.e. flow rate, sonication power, sonication time) depends on the type of modifier used, solvent, batch size, configuration and size of the sonic source, and temperature at which sonication takes place. Intercalation and exfoliation of the nanosilicate particles can be observed via X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the resulting solution. Exfoliation can be more directly observed by combining the sonicated nanosilicate solution with a polyimide solution, removing the solvent by evaporation or precipitation, casting or pressing a film and performing TEM analysis.<br>
The nanosilicates may be exfoliated such that the materials d-spacing is greater than the material would have, but for the exfoliation step. According to the present invention the d-spacing can be any that is greater than the unmodified nanosilicate that will lower the CTE of the polyimide film. According to alternate embodiments, the modified nanosilicates will have d-spacings greater than 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, and 75 Angstroms.<br>
It has been found that use of nanoclays, particularly exfoliated nanoclays provides unexpected advantages. Films comprising a nanoclay can have a lower CTE than a film of the same composition without the nanoclay. Alternatively, or in addition, films comprising a nanoclay can have a Tg that is the same as a film of the same<br>
composition without the nanoclay. A film comprising a nanoclay can also be transparent. The amount of nanoclay used in the film will vary, depending on the desired film properties. For example, the film can comprise from 0.1 to 10 wt% nanoclay, specifically 1 to 10 wt% nanoclay, based on the total weight of the film.<br>
The nanosilicate can have an organic modifier with cationic functionality and may be thermally stable at film forming processing temperatures.<br>
A general methodology for making solvent cast films according to this process involves dispersing the modified clay either by sonication or high shear mixing in the chosen solvent (for example, DMAc). The clay dispersion is formulated to be in the range of 1-15% solids by weight, or more particularly, 1-5% solids by weight. The monomers, at least one dianhydride monomer and at least one diamine monomer, are added to the clay dispersion to form a modified polyamic acid solution. Also, instead of adding polyamic acid to the clay dispersion, fully imidized soluble polyimides can be dissolved in solvents such as DMAc and NMP in the range of 5-25% solids by weight, for example 10% by weight. In another embodiment, a 10% by weight solution of the dried film in dimethylacetamide or N-methylpyrolidinone has an inherent viscosity of greater than 0.05 dl/g. The polyimide solution can then be combined with the clay dispersion and cast as above.<br>
Another additive which can be employed to lower the CTE of solvent cast polyimide<br>
films are metal oxide nanoparticles which can be formed from an organo-metallic<br>
precursor. Metal oxide nanoparticles can be generated in situ by decomposing an<br>
organometallic     precursor.	One     example     of    such     a     material     is<br>
aluminum(acetylacetonate)3 (Al(acac)3). Thermolysis of (Al(acac)3) yields, aluminum oxide. When done in dilute solution (small molecule solvent or polymer melt) Al2O3 nanoparticles are formed. Targeting a 1% by weight loading of A12O3 in the final polymer, the precursor can be added upfront to the polymerization of dianhydride and diamine monomers, specifically oxydiphthalic anhydride and diaminodiphenylsulfone. Resultant polymer filled with Al2O3 nanoparticles exhibited a CTE lowered by more than 15% compared to an unfilled control sample.<br>
In addition to the organo-metallic precursor being added to the polymerization, the precursor can be solvent blended with the polyamic acid solution, or finished soluble polyimide, or blended and extruded with finished polymer to yield a filled system. The materials in solution can be cast as films and cured to give the filled film. Other suitable organo-metallic precursors include metal(acac) complexes, and ceramic precursors such as molybdenum sulfide.<br>
Other classes of additives which can be used to impart a desirable property other than, or in addition to lowering the CTE of a polyimide film, include fillers and reinforcements for example fiber glass, milled glass, glass beads, flake and the like. Minerals such as talc, wollastonite, mica, kaolin, or montmorillonite clay, silica, fumed silica, perlite, quartz, and barite may be added. The compositions can also be modified with effective amounts of inorganic fillers, such as, for example, carbon fibers and nanotubes, glass fibers, metal fibers, metal powders, conductive carbon, and other additives including nano-scale reinforcements.<br>
In some cases a metal oxide may be added to the polymers of the present invention. In some instances the metal oxide may further improve flame resistance (FR) performance by decreasing heat release and increasing the time to peak heat release. Titanium dioxide is of note. Other metal oxides include zinc oxides, boron oxides, antimony oxides, iron oxides, and transition metal oxides. Metal oxides that are white may be desired in some instances. Metal oxides may be used alone or in combination with other metal oxides. Metal oxides may be used in any effective amount, in some instances at from 0.01 to 20% by weight of the polymer.<br>
Other useful additives include smoke suppressants such as metal borate salts, for example zinc borate, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal borate or other borate salts. Additionally other boron containing compounds, such as boric acid, borate esters, boron oxides, or other oxygen compounds of boron may be useful. Additionally other flame retardant additives, such as aryl phosphates and brominated aromatic compounds, including polymers containing linkages made from brominated aryl compounds, may be employed.   Examples of halogenated aromatic compounds are<br>
brominated phenoxy resins, halogenated polystyrenes, halogenated imides, brominated polycarbonates, brominated epoxy resins and mixtures thereof.<br>
In some instances it maybe desired to have flame retardant compositions that are essentially free of halogen atoms, especially bromine and chlorine. Essentially free of halogen atoms means that in some embodiments the composition has less than 3% halogen, specifically chlorine and/or bromine by weight of the composition, and in other embodiments less than 1% by weight of the composition contains halogen atoms, specifically chlorine and/or bromine. The amount of halogen atoms can be determined by ordinary chemical analysis.<br>
The composition may also optionally include a fluoropolymer in an amount of 0.01 to 5.0 % fluoropolymer by weight of the composition. The fluoropolymer may be used in any effective amount to provide anti-drip properties to the resin composition. Some examples of suitable fluoropolymers and methods for making such fluoropolymers are set forth, for example, in US Patent Nos. 3,671,487, 3,723,373 and 3,383,092. Suitable fluoropolymers include homopolymers and copolymers that comprise structural units derived from one or more fluorinated alpha-olefin monomers. The term "fluorinated alpha-olefin monomer" means an alpha-olefin monomer that includes at least one fluorine atom substituent. Some of the suitable fluorinated alpha-olefin monomers include, for example, fluoroethylenes such as, for example, CF2=CF2, CHF=CF2, CH2=CF2, and CH2=CHF and fluoro propylenes such as, for example, CF3CF=CF2, CF3CF=CHF, CF3CH=CF2, CF3CH=CH2, CF3CF=CHF, CHF2CH=CHF, and CF3CF=CH2.<br>
Some of the suitable fluorinated alpha-olefin copolymers include copolymers comprising structural units derived from two or more fluorinated alpha-olefin monomers such as, for example, poly(tetrafluoro ethylene-hexafluoro ethylene), and copolymers comprising structural units derived from one or more fluorinated monomers and one or more non-fluorinated monoethylenically unsaturated monomers that are copolymerizable with the fluorinated monomers such as, for example, poly(tetrafluoroethylene-ethylene-propylene) copolymers. Suitable non-fluorinated monoethylenically   unsaturated   monomers   include   for   example,   alpha-olefin<br>
monomers such as, for example, ethylene, propylene, butene, acrylate monomers such as for example, methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, and the like, with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) homopolymer (PTFE) preferred.<br>
Other additives which may be added to the solvent cast films include antioxidants such as phosphites, phosphonites, and hindered phenols. Phosphorus containing stabilizers, including triaryl phosphite and aryl phosphonates, are of note as useful additives. Diflunctional phosphorus containing compounds can also be employed. Stabilizers with a molecular weight of greater than or equal to 300 Daltons are preferred. In other instances phosphorus containing stabilizers with a molecular weight of greater than or equal to 500 Daltons are useful. Phosphorus containing stabilizers are typically present in the composition at 0.05-0.5% by weight of the formulation. Colorants as well as light stabilizers and UV absorbers may also be used. Flow aids and mold release compounds are also contemplated. Examples of mold release agents are alkyl carboxylic acid esters, for example, pentaerythritol tetrastearate, glycerin tri-stearate and ethylene glycol distearate. Mold release agents are typically present in the composition at 0.05-0.5% by weight of the formulation. Preferred mold release agents will have high molecular weight, typically greater than 300 Daltons, to prevent loss if the release agent from the molten polymer mixture during melt processing.<br>
Compositions used to form the articles according to the present invention may also include various additives such as nucleating, clarifying, stiffness, and/or crystallization rate agents. These agents are used in a conventional matter and in conventional amounts.<br>
The compositions can be blended with the aforementioned ingredients by a variety of methods involving intimate mixing of the materials with any additional additives desired in the formulation. A preferred procedure includes solution blending, although melt blending may be employed after the solvent cast film is made. Illustrative examples of equipment used in such melt processing methods include co-rotating and counter-rotating extruders, single screw extruders, co-kneaders, disc-pack processors, and various other types of extrusion equipment.<br>
Liquid coating solutions can be formed using the above-described polyimide compositions, as well as film-forming solutions. The liquid coating solutions have many and varied uses. The coating solutions can be applied to a variety of substrates using any suitable coating method, e.g. dipping, brushing, spraying, wiping and the like, and thereafter heated to evaporate the solvent system and form cured polyetherimide resinous coatings. The temperature is preferably increased gradually to produce smooth resinous coatings. The polymerization and cure proceeds advantageously at a temperature of from 125°C to300°C or more.<br>
The polyamic acid solution can also be used as a coating solution which may be applied immediately upon preparation or stored prior to use. In general, maximum storage life can be obtained by storing the solutions under a nitrogen blanket in the absence of light.<br>
Polymers used to make the solvent cast films and coatings are polyimides and in some specific instances, polyetherimides. Polyimides according to the present invention have the general formula (1):<br>

Desirably, the diamino compounds are aromatic diamines, especially m- and p-phenylenediamine and mixtures comprising at least one of the foregoing.<br>
In one embodiment, the polyetherimide resin comprises structural units according to formula 12 wherein each R is independently p-phenylene or m-phenylene or a mixture comprising at least one of the foregoing and T is a divalent radical of the formula (10):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Included among the many methods of making the polyimides, particularly polyetherimides, are those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,847,867, 3,850,885, 3,852,242, 3,855,178, 3,983,093, and 4,443,591.<br>
The reactions can be carried out employing solvents, e.g., o-dichlorobenzene, m-cresol/toluene and the like, to effect a reaction between the anhydride of formula (7) and the diamine of formula (8), at temperatures of 100°C to 250°C. Chain stoppers and branching agents may also be employed in the reaction.<br>
When polyimide copolymers of ether-containing and non-ether containing subunits are used, a dianhydride, such as pyromellitic anhydride, is used in combination with the bis(ether anhydride). The polyimides can optionally be prepared from reaction of an aromatic bis(ether anhydride) with an organic diamine in which the diamine is present in the reaction mixture at less than or equal to 0.2 molar excess. Under such conditions the polyetherimide resin may have less than or equal to 15 microequivalents per gram (µeq/g) acid titratable groups, or, more specifically less<br>
than or equal to 10 microequivalents/g acid titratable groups, as shown by titration with chloroform solution with a solution of 33 weight percent (wt%) hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid. Acid-titratable groups are essentially due to amine end-groups in the polyetherimide resin.<br>
One route for the synthesis of polyimides proceeds through a bis(4-halophthalimide) having the following structure (11):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is as described above and X is a halogen. The bis(4-halophthalimide) wherein R is a 1,3-phenyl group (12) is particularly useful.<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>

Suitable phase transfer catalysts are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,229,482. Suitable dihydroxy substituted aromatic hydrocarbons include those having the formula (14):<br>

wherein A is a divalent aromatic hydrocarbon radical. Suitable A radicals include m-phenylene, p-phenylene, 4,4'-biphenylene, and similar radicals.<br>
As described above, virgin polyimides can be used in the formation of the solvent cast polyimide films. However, in a specific embodiment, the polyimide films comprise up to 50 wt%, specifically up to 30 wt%, of a recycled polyimide. The recycled polyimide, prior to recycling, can have a glass transition temperature from 210°C to 450°C. In one embodiment, virgin polyimide is melt blended with recycled polyimide, for example polyimide that has already been formed into a film as described above. In another embodiment, virgin polyimide is solvent mixed with recycled polyimide, for example polyimide that has been formed into a film as described above. Polyimide compositions comprising the recycled polyimide can then be formed into a casting composition and be cast as described above, for example from a composition comprising 1 to 30 wt% solids. In the foregoing embodiments, the CTE of the film comprising the recycled polyimide can be within ±10 ppm/°C of a film having the same composition without the recycled polyimide.<br>
The above described solvent cast polyimide films can be used to manufacture recycled film compositions for a variety of uses. The recycled film compositions can be formed by melt bending (when the recycled film is capable of being melt blended) or by solvent mixing. In one embodiment, a method for the manufacture of recycled polyimide composition comprises melting the solvent cast polyimide film as described herein; and combining the melted solvent cast polyimide film of claim 1 with a polymer composition to form a recycled polyimide composition. In another embodiment, a method of manufacture of a recycled a polyimide composition comprises dissolving the solvent cast polyimide film and combining the dissolved film of claim 1 with a polymer composition to form the recycled polyimide composition. In either of the foregoing embodiments, the polymer composition can comprise a virgin polyimide. The recycled compositions can then be used in the manufacture of compositions and articles as is known in the art.   For example, the<br>
recycled polyimide composition can be extruded, or cast as described above. Articles comprising the recycled polyimide compositions are within the scope of the invention.<br>
As an alternative to creating a solvent cast film having a CTE less than 70 ppm/°C, in another embodiment less than 60 ppm/°C, or in another embodiment, less than 35 ppm/°C, it is possible to add an additional process step to lower the CTE of a solvent cast film having a CTE above 70 ppm/°C, above 60 ppm/°C, or in another embodiment, above 35 ppm/°C, to a CTE below 60 ppm/°C and in another embodiment less than 35 ppm/°C, specifically less than 30 ppm/°C.<br>
The CTE of a solvent cast film can be reduced by biaxially stretching as described in US Patent 5,460,890. Similarly, the CTE of a melt extruded film or fully imidized solvent cast film can be reduced by thermally biaxially stretching as described in US Patent No. 5,260,407. The skilled artisan will be familiar with the other known methods of lowering the CTE of a polyimide film.<br>
For example, a film with a low in-plane CTE may be obtained from polyimide resin compositions because the resin exhibits a partial crystallinity after armealing, and the crystalline phases can be aligned in two dimensions through biaxial stretching after extrusion. The film can then be heat set while constrained in a frame, returning the amorphous portion of the film back to a random unoriented configuration while retaining the alignment of the crystalline phases (and also inducing more aligned crystalline domains). The alignment of the crystalline phases results in a film with a low CTE. Since the amorphous part of the material is returned to its random state the film will not exhibit shrinkage, even when taken above the Tg of the material. This can lead to a dimensionally stable film at flex fabrication temperatures, because the crystalline domains are stable to temperatures above 400°C. The film has high temperature survivability due to the high Tg of the material and the partial crystallinity. The Tg of the material is above the temperature of the solder float test, which makes the material survive this test as well. The polymer crystals do not melt until temperatures exceeding 400°C, which is well above the temperatures seen during flex fabrication. The crystals act as effective crosslinks below Tm, holding the material together for high temperature survivability.   The crystallization kinetics of<br>
the composition identified below is fairly slow, allowing the material to be melt extruded to a film before significant crystallization takes place. The film can then be heat set above Tg to induce crystallinity.<br>
A wide range of polyetherimide copolymers containing a combination of the monomers 4,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA), bisphenol A dianhydride (BPADA), meta-phenylenediamine (mPD), and para-phenylenediamine (pPD) exhibit the partial crystallinity and high heat necessary for the film to exhibit the desired properties. The polymer can be end capped with, for example, aniline. The scope of the present invention is specifically intended to encompass the monomers and endcaps necessary to have partial crystallinity and to maintain processability. A specific example can be 80-100% ODPA as the dianhydride and 30-100% pPD as the diamine, with 3.5-5% aniline as the endcapping agent.<br>
Varying these compositions can alter the crystallization kinetics to achieve the desired balance of processability and achievable crystallinity to reduce CTE. In one embodiment, the optimum composition in terms of processability, ductility, slow crystallization kinetics, and maximum achievable crystallinity is a dianhydride component comprising 95% ODPA and 5% BPADA, on an equivalents basis, and a diamine component comprising 70% mPD and 30% pPD on an equivalents basis, together with 5% aniline, based on the total equivalents of dianhydride component and diamine component.<br>
Very good film properties are obtained when a specific combination of dianhydrides are used, especially when the specific dianhydrides are used in combination with specific diamines. In one embodiment, the dianhydrides comprise 3,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, 3,3'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, 4,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, and combinations thereof. Other, additional dianhydrides can be present to adjust the properties of the films. In one embodiment, however, the polyimide has less than 15 molar % of structural units derived from a member of the group consisting of biphenyltetracarboxylic acid, a dianhydride of biphenyltetracarboxylic acid, an ester of biphenyltetracarboxylic acid, and combinations thereof<br>
Alternatively, the polyimides are formed from a dianhydride component that consists essentially of 3,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, 3,3'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, 4,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, and combinations thereof. In still another embodiment, the polyimides are formed from a dianhydride component that consists of 3,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, 3,3'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, 4,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, and combinations thereof<br>
It has further been found films having excellent properties are obtained when the diamine component comprises 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone, m-phenylenediamine, p-phenylenediamine, 4,4'-oxydianiline, l,3-bis(4-aminophenoxy)benzene, l,3-bis(3-aminophenoxy)benzene, and combinations thereof In one embodiment, the diamine component consists essentially of 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone, m-phenylenediamine, p-phenylenediamine, 4,4'-oxydianiline, l,3-bis(4-aminophenoxy)benzene, l,3-bis(3-aminophenoxy)benzene, and combinations thereof In another embodiment, the diamine component consists of 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone, m-phenylenediamine, p-phenylenediamine, 4,4'-oxydianiline, l,3-bis(4-aminophenoxy)benzene, l,3-bis(3-aminophenoxy)benzene, and combinations thereof, and no other diamines are present.<br>
The polyimides are further advantageously formed from structural units wherein the diamine component comprises greater than or equal to 10 mole % of 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone, based on the total moles of diamine component. In one embodiment the diamine component comprises 10 to 100 mole % of 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone.<br>
The films can have a number of advantageous properties, in addition to low CTE, useful Tg, and low solvent retention. In one embodiment, the fihn is stable, that is, loses less than 5% of its initial weight after storage in water for 24 hours at 25°C, specifically less than 2% of its initial weight after storage in water for 24 hours at<br>
25°C.<br>
In an unexpected feature, it has been found by the inventors that the polyimides, in particular polyetherimides comprising units derived from specific diamines, can be formulated to exhibit a relatively constant CTE while achieved a Tg from 220 to<br>
375°C. This result is unexpected because ordinarily in thermoplastic amorphous films, CTE varies with Tg of in a linear relationship. It is therefore possible to select a desired Tg while maintaining a specific CTE.<br>
The liquid coating solutions, film casting solutions, coatings, and solvent cast films of the present invention have many and varied uses. The coating solutions may be applied to a variety of substrates using any suitable coating method, e.g. dipping, brushing, spraying, wiping and the like, and thereafter heated to evaporate the solvent system and form cured polyimide resinous coatings and/or solvent cast films. The temperature is preferably increased gradually to produce smooth resinous coatings. The polyimide-forming reaction proceeds advantageously at a temperature of froml25°C to 450°C or more. A variety of substrates can be used, for example copper, silicon, aluminum, gold, silver, nickel, a glass, a ceramic, and a polymer, including a polymeric release layer.<br>
The present coating and casting solutions, including compositions comprising a recycled polyimide film, may be employed to manufacture a variety of articles. In one embodiment, the coating and casting solutions is used to manufacture films for circuit boards, including flexible circuit boards. In this embodiment, a solvent cast polyetherimide film is adheringly disposed on an electrically conductive substrate, for example a face of a metal layer such as copper. A second substrate, e.g., another layer of a conductive material, i.e., a metal such as copper, can be disposed on a side of the film opposite the first substrate. Other specific articles that can be manufactured using the solvent cast polyimide films include capacitors, which in their simplest embodiment comprise a solvent cast polyimide film disposed between two electrically conductive layers, e.g., two copper layers. In still another embodiment, the solutions can be used as wire enamels to form resinous insulating coatings on copper and aluminum wire. In this embodiment, the polyimide film forms a coating on an electrically conductive wire. The solutions can also be used as varnishes for coating or impregnating various substrates such as coils of previously insulated wire (e.g. in motor and generator coils), as well as woven and non-woven fabrics, and the like. The solvent cast films of the present invention may also be used for flexible printed circuit board (FPC), chip-on-flex (COF), and tape automated bonding (TAB)<br>
applications. The term "articles" can also include speaker cones, tapes and labels, wire wraps, etc.<br>

Examples 1-72<br>
Film Casting Procedure and Experimental for Examples 1-72:<br>
Inventive formulations 1-72 were prepared using the compositions specified in Table 1. The amounts of each monomer were calculated at a stoichiometry of 1 amine for every anhydride with no correction for purity, (corrections for purity can affect the final molecular weight of the polymer and could affect the final performance of the article). A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet calculator was constructed that calculates the grams of each monomer based upon the total grams polymer desired and the monomer feeds of dianhydride and amine. The skilled artisan will appreciate that there are many different ways of ascertaining the correct amount by weight of each ingredient to be used in making the films according to the present invention. It is within the ability of the skilled artisan to calculate the weight amount of ingredients based on the overall stoichiometry and the final percent solids of the reaction mechanism enunciated herein.<br>
Casting Procedure: The correct mole ratios of dianhydride and diamine as shown in Table 1 were weighed on an analytical balance to four decimal place accuracy.<br>

The monomers were then transferred to a scintillation vial and the weigh paper used was rinsed with the solvent. The remaining volume of solvent was transferred to the vial and the vial was rendered inert with nitrogen. The sealed inert vial was then placed on a shaker overnight to produce a poly(amic acid) solution. The poly(amic acid) solution was then drop cast through a 0.45 micrometer filter onto clean glass slides, prepared in advance by cleaning with hexanes.<br>
The coated slides were then placed on a hotplate equipped with: a thermocouple; a ramp and soak temperature controller; a nitrogen purge; and, a cover. The films were then imidized following the heating profile outlined in Table 2 and Figure 1.<br>

Weight% (wt%) is defined as: [weight of component/(weight of component + weight of all other components)] x 100. Because the initial curing profile was not optimum for every formulation/solvent combination, some of the films were not suitable for testing described in Table 3 and thus not represented. It should be recognized by those skilled in the art that a suitable combination of solvent and thermal processing profile may be developed to make films that can be tested.<br>
Example 73<br>
Detailed Film Casting Example:<br>
On an analytical balance, 0.5937 g (0.001914 mol) of 4,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride and 0.4752 g (0.001914 mol) of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone were weighed out to be with in 0.0005g of the desired weight. The monomers were transferred to a 20 mL scintillation vial, rinsing the weigh paper with 2.0 mL of dimethylacetamide, to ensure complete transfer of the monomers. The remaining solvent (5.47 mL of dimethylacetamide) was transferred by volumetric pipette to give a solution of 12.5 weight % solids. The vial was rendered inert by flowing nitrogen through the vial for one minute and then quickly capping the vial. The sample was then placed on the shaker overnight to form a poly(amic acid) solution.<br>
Glass slides (Fisherbrand precleaned microscope slides) were cleaned with hexanes. The solution (2.0 mL) was then filtered through a 0.45 micrometer syringe tip filter onto a glass slide. The solution coated glass slide was then placed on a hotplate equipped with a ramp and soak temperature controller, a cover, and a controlled nitrogen purge of 85 liters (3 cubic feet) per hour (apparatus volume of 0.1 cubic feet). The sample was then imidized using the thermal profile outline described above for examples 1-8 and detailed in Tables 3 and Figure 1. Following imidization the film was released from the glass slide by immersion in water at 25°C, to yield a freestanding polyimide film. The film was then used for later examples or submitted for testing and analysis.<br>
Example 74<br>
Detailed Film Casting Example:<br>
On an analytical balance, 0.8113g of 4,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride and 0.0566g of meta-phenylene diamine and 0.2263g of para-phenylene diamine were weighed out to be with in 0.0005g of the desired weight. The monomers were transferred to a 20 mL scintillation vial, rinsing the weigh paper with 1.0 mL of dimethylacetamide, to ensure complete transfer of the monomers. The remaining solvent (5.47 mL of dimethylacetamide) was transferred by volumetric pipette to give a solution of 12.5 weight % solids. The vial was rendered inert by flowing nitrogen through the vial for one minute and then quickly capping the vial. The sample was then placed on the shaker overnight to form a poly(amic acid) solution.<br>
Glass slides (Fisherbrand precleaned microscope slides) were cleaned with hexanes. The solution (2.0 mL) was then filtered through a 0.45 micrometer syringe tip filter onto a glass slide. After the solution was filtered onto the slide a 635 micrometer doctor blade (25 mil gap) was used to yield a wet film, (final film thickness is a function of concentration and gap on the doctor blade).<br>
The solution coated glass slide was then placed on a hotplate equipped with a ramp and soak temperature controller, a cover, and controlled nitrogen purge of 85 liters (3 cubic feet) per hour (apparatus volume of 0.1 cubic feet). The sample was then imidized using the thermal profile outline described above for examples 1-72 and detailed in Tables 2 and Figure 1. Following imidization the film was released from the glass slide by immersion in water at 25°C, to yield a freestanding polyimide film. The film was then used for later examples or submitted for testing and analysis.<br>
Example 75<br>
Additional examples were performed with the following terms being defined:<br>
DSC: Differential Scanning Calorimetry was conducted on a Perkin Elmer DSC 7 with a heating rate of 20°C/min and the glass transition measured in the second heat. This method is based upon ASTM D3418.<br>
DMA: Film samples cut precisely to give known length width and thickness were analyzed on a dynamic mechanical analyzer in a tensile mode with a frequency of 1 Hz and heating rate of 5°C/min over the temperature range 40-350°C. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is conducted in accordance to ASTM test D5026, with the exception that only one test specimen is tested. The glass transition temperature (Tg) is determined by the maximum point of the tan delta curve.<br>
TMA: CTE values of the cast films were measured on a thermo-mechanical analyzer with a heating rate of 5°C/min from 0-250°C. CTE values were calculated from the slope over the range of 30-200°C.<br>
Equilibrium water: The equilibrium water content was defined as the moisture content of films allowed to stand at ambient conditions in the lab for 72h (about 25°C and 70% RH). The moisture content was measured by accurately weighing a sample of film 10.2 centimeters x 1.27 centimeters x 63.5 micrometers (about 4 inch x 0.5 inch X 0.0025 inch) before and after a drying. Films were weighed (to 0.00005g), dried in a 150°C oven for 4h, and then immediately weighed to determine the moisture loss. Equilibrium water content is the mass lost upon heating divided by the mass of the dried film as a percent.<br>
Moisture absorption: Dried film samples (oven at 150°C for 4h) of known mass were submerged in water for 72h at ambient temperature (25°C). Following the time period, the films were removed from the water and the excess moisture removed by drying with a Kim wipe. Moisture absorption is the mass uptake upon soaking in water divided by the weight of the dried film as a percent.<br>
Solubility: A positive result indicates that at a concentration of 10% solids, the folly imidized film cast from the poly(amic acid) solution dissolves in dimethylacetamide or N-methylpyrolidinone (solvent indicated in the test) and can pass through a 0.45 micrometer filter.<br>

Modification of Nano Clays.<br>
Procedure for the preparation of organically modified clay:<br>
The organically modified clay was prepared via ion exchange in water or a combination of water and an alcohol, or water and acetonitrile. The Na+ MMT (a clay with sodium counter ions) was dispersed in water or water/solvent combination at 1-5% by weight and heated to 80°C. The organic cation, tetraphenylphosphonium bromide, was dissolved or dispersed water or solvent combination as above in a ratio such that when the solution or dispersion of the organic cation was added to the clay dispersion there is organic cations equal to or in excess of the cation ion exchange capacity of the dispersed clay. The mixture was then heated to reflux for 1-2 h. Following cooling to room temperature, the modified clay is collected by centrifugation. The supernatant was poured off, and the solid modified clay was washed by redispersing the clay in deionized water or deionized water solvent combination and recollected by centrifogation. The wash solution was poured off and the wash process is repeated twice more. Following the final centrifogation, the solid clay was dried in an oven and then ground to a fine powder.<br>

Detailed Experimental Analysis of Adhesion of Films to Copper<br>
Metal Adhesion: 2.54 centimeter square (one inch square) film samples were sandwiched between two pieces of copper foil. One piece of foil has a roughened granular surface to enhance adhesion, the other copper surface was polished smooth. The stack was then pressed between the parallel plates of a heated press at 421°C (790°F) for one minute with three tons of pressure on the hydraulic ram. The adhesion of the film to copper was then graded using a scale of 1-5. A one indicates no adhesion to either surface. A two indicates moderate adhesion to the roughened copper. A three indicates good adhesion to the roughened copper surface, a four indicates good adhesion to the roughened surface and moderate adhesion to the smooth surface. A five indicates good adhesion to both copper surfaces equal to or better than the benchmark films. The benchmark materials are GE resins XH6050 extruded film and CRS5001 extruded film.<br>

TPP-MMT (Tetraphenylphosphonium treated montmorillonite clay) was dispersed in NMP solvent with the aid of sonication. Oxydianiline (ODA) was added to the resulting solution and mechanically stirred until the diamine was completely dissolved at room temperature. Oxydiphthalic dianhydride (ODPA) was then added to the solution and dispersed with mechanical stirring to form a viscous poly(amic acid) solution at 20 wt% solids. The solution was allowed to react at room temperature for 12 hours. The solution was cast onto a glass substrate at 70 °C and imidized by successive heating at 70 °C for 2 hours, 150 °C for 4 hours, 200 °C for 1 hour and 300 °C for 1 hour.
