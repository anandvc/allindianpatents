				<td>TThe present invention relates to a high gas barrier receptacle and closure assembly<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATONS. This application claims the benefit of provisional application Serial No. 60/284,277, filed April 17, 2001, which, is incorporated by reference and made a part hereof.<br>
Technical Field The present invention relates to a high gas barrier primary receptacle system, and more particularly to a receptacle system for medical solutions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION: There is an ever increasing number of therapeutic fluids being developed for delivery by a flexible receptacle. Many of these therapeutic fluids are sensitive as they degrade or react with gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. These therapeutic fluids must be protected from contact.by such gases to maintain the efficacy of the therapeutic fluid.<br>
For example, hemoglobin solutions are known to lose their ability to function as blood substitutes during storage. A hemoglobin solution loses its ability to function as a blood substitute because of spontaneous transformation of oxyhemoglobin in the solution to methemoglobin, a physiologically inactive form of hemoglobin which does not function as a blood substitute by releasing oxygen into a patient's bloodstream. To improve shelf life, the blood substitutes industry delaya loss of function by refrigerating or freezing the solutions, or controlling the oxygenation state of the hemaglohin within the solution.<br>
Therapeutic hemoglobin solutions are typically oxygenated, stored frozen in conventional oxygen-permeable, 200 ml plastic solution bags, and thawed to room temperature hours before use.<br>
WO 99/15289 describes a multiple layer structure for fabricating medical products. The layer structure has a core layer of an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer, a solution contact layer of a polyolefin positioned on a first side of the core layer, an outer layer positioned on a second side of the core layer opposite the solution contact layer, the outer layer being selected from the group consisting of polyamides,<br><br>
polyesters and polyolefins, and a tie layer on each side of the core layer. The tie layer is 0.2-1.2 mils in thickness, and is the only layer of the structure which may be composed of ethylene vinyl acetate.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,271,351 describes a method of storing deoxyhemoglobin in a container which is said to exhibit low oxygen permeability. The container is composed of a layered structure including ethylene vinyl alcohol, but does not include ethylene vinyl acetate.<br>
There is a need for containers having minimal oxygen permeability which would enable deoxygenated hemoglobin solutions to be stored for weeks or months at room temperature and then used as a blood substitute.<br>
Receptacles used for the shipping, storing, and delivery of liquids, such as medical or therapeutic fluids, are often fabricated from single-ply or multiple-ply polymeric materials. Two sheets of these materials are placed in overlapping relationship and the overlapping sheets are bonded at their outer peripheries to define a chamber or pouch for containing liquids. It is also possible to extrude these materials as a tube and to seal longitudinally spaced portions of the tube to define chambers between two adjacent seals. Typically, the materials are joined along their inner surfaces using bonding techniques such as heat sealing, radio-frequency sealing, thermal transfer welding, adhesive sealing, solvent bonding, sonic sealing, and laser welding.<br>
It is also common to provide such receptacles with access ports to provide access to the interior of the receptacle. Access ports typically take the form of one or more end ports (transfer tubes) inserted between the sidewalls of the receptacle or panel ports attached to a sidewall of the receptacle. The end ports typically have a fluid passageway with a closure wall positioned inside the passageway to form a fluid tight seal of the receptacle. The closure, typically in the form of a membrane, must be punctured by an access needle or "spike" to allow for delivery of the contents of the receptacle.<br>
Conventional flexible solution receptacles employing end port designs typically use flexible PVC or soft polyolefins such as LDPE to construct the port tubes. Such materials have sufficient elasticity to grip the outside of an access spike to retain the spike during fluid delivery. The inner diameter of the end ports are<br>
dimensioned to be smaller than the outer diameter of the access device.  Due to the<br>
ductility of PVC or LDPE, the port tube caa expand about the outside of the access spike to form an interference fit therewith. However, such receptacle and port closure systems are readily permeated by oxygen and other gases such as carbon dioxide. If such receptacles are to be utilized to house a gas sensitive liquid, such packages must utilize a gas barrier overwrap material.<br>
To provide a stand-alone gas barrier primary receptacle, all components of the receptacle system should be fabricated using barrier material. For medical applications where such receptacles are typically disposed of by incineration, it is desirable to construct the receptacle system components from non-halogen containing polymers. Halogen containing compounds have the potential for creating inorganic acids upon incineration. Further, for medical applications, it is also desirable to construct the receptacle system components from polymers having a low quantity of low molecular weight additives, such as plasticizers, as such low molecular weight components can potentially leach out into the fluids contained or transported therein.<br>
It is well known that certain materials provide a high resistance to the ingress of oxygen or other gases. For example, ethylene vinyl alcohol (BVOH) provides a high barrier to the ingress of oxygen. However, EVOH provides a significant design challenge for use in flexible receptacle systems as EVOH is also know to be a very rigid material. A port tube containing a significant quantity of EVOH will have insufficient elasticity to expand around an access device. Thus, such an EVOH containing port tube cannot be dimensioned to be smaller in diameter than an access device.<br>
Due to the variation in the outer diameter dimensions of access devices commercially, it is also difficult to design a single port tube to have an appropriate diameter to form an interference fit with all access devices commercially available. The spike holder or needle holder has sufficient elasomeric properties to form around an access device and form a grasping hold of the access device, The present invention is provided to solve these and other problems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention provides a receptacle for a therapeutic fluid susceptible to deterioration on exposure to a gas such as oxygen or carbon dioxide. The receptacle<br>
has walls of sheet material each including at least one layer forming a barrier<br>
essentially impermeable to said gas, and a seal sealing the walls together in a region thereof. A transfer tube is sealed in the seal having a proximal end in the receptacle, a distal end accessible from outside the receptacle, a flow passage extending between said proximal and distal ends, and a closure blocking flow through said flow passage adapted to be pierced by a tubular needle for transfer of therapeutic through the needle. The transfer tube and closure are essentially impermeable to said gas.<br>
The present invention further provides a transfer rube for attachment to a receptacle adapted to hold a fluent therapeutic susceptible to deterioration on exposure to gas such as oxygen or carbon dioxide. The transfer tube has a tubular body having a proximal end, a distal end opposite the proximal end, a flow passage extending between said proximal and distal ends adapted to communicate with said receptacle, and a closure blocking flow through the flow passage and adapted to be pierced by a tubular needle for transfer of therapeutic through the needle. The tubular body and closure are essentially impermeable to said gas.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a needle holder for application to the distal end of a transfer tube of a receptacle particularly adapted to hold a fluen therapeutic susceptible to deterioration on exposure to gas such as oxygen or carboxy dioxide, The needle holder is adapted to hold in place the carrier of a transfer needle with the needle piercing the transfer tube. The holder has a body having a first annuls wall defining a first cavity at a first end of the body, a second annular wall defining second cavity at a second end of the body, and a flow passage extending between the two cavities, the first annular wall being sized for an interference fit with said transfer tube to releasably attach the needle holder to the transfer tube, and the second annuls wall being sized for an interference fit with said needle carrier to releasably attach th needle carrier to the needle holder in a position in which needle is disposed in said flow passage.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
While this invention is susceptible of embodiments in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail preferred embodiments of the invention with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the invention to the embodiments illustrated.<br>
FIG. la shows a flowable materials receptacle and closure system generally referred to as 10. The system includes a flowable materials receptacle 30, a port (transfer) tube and closure assembly 40, and a needle or "spike" holder 50. The relative size of the receptacle 30, assembly 40, and spike holder SO are exaggerated for illustrative purposes. In a preferred form of the invention, the system 10 is useful for containing and delivering a fluent therapeutic susceptible to deterioration on exposure to a gas such as oxygen or carbon dioxide. The system is also particularly well suited for storage and delivery of a buffered solution.<br>
What is meant by "flowable material" is a material that will flow by the force of gravity, Flowable materials therefore include both liquid items and powdered or granular items and the like. Flowable materials receptacles find particular use for<br>
storage and delivery of medical or therapeutic fluids and include, but are not limited<br>
to, IV. receptacles, peritoneal dialysis drain and fill receptacles, blood receptacles, blood product receptacles, blood substitute receptacles, nutritional receptacles, food receptacles and the like.<br>
FIGS, la and 8 illustrate the assembly 40 as including a port (transfer) tube 52 and a closure in the form of a wall or membrane 54. The port tube 52 defines a fluid flow passage 56 and has an end surface 58. The membrane 54 is shown attached to the port tube end surface 58. It is contemplated by the present invention the membrane 54 could also be positioned inside the port tube flow passage 56 without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
While it is contemplated the port tube 52 can have any number of layers, in a preferred form of the invention the port tube 52 will include either a discrete layer of a barrier material or a blend layer including a barrier material. The barrier material will present a barrier to the passage of gasses or water vapor transmission, and, in a preferred form of the invention, will reduce the passage rate of oxygen therethrough. It is also desirable that all materials in the solution contact layer, and more preferably all materials used in the tubing, be free of halogens, plasticizers or other low-molecular weight or water soluble components that can leach out into the solutions transferred through the tubing. Suitable barrier materials include ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymers having an ethylene content of from about 25% to about 45% by mole percent, more preferably from about 28% to about 36% by mole percent and most preferably from about 30% to about 34% by mole percent.<br>
In an even more preferred form of the invention, the port tube 52 will have multiple layers, FIG. 2a and FIG. 2b show respectively a three-layer port tube 52 and a two-layer port tube. The three-layer port tube 52 has an outside or an outermost layer 60, a core layer 62 and an inside solution contact layer 64. Similarly, the two-layer port tube 52 has an outside layer 60 and an inside, solution contact layer 64.<br>
In a preferred form of the invention, the multiple layer transfer tube or port tube 52 will have a discrete layer of a barrier material with the remaining layers being selected from polyolefins. The layers of the tube can be positioned in any order, however, in a preferred form of the invention, the barrier layer is not positioned as the outside layer 60. Thus, the layers of a three layer tube can be positioned in one of six orders selected from the group: first/seconod/third, first/third/second, second/first/third,<br>
second/third/first,   third/first/second,   and   third/second/first.      Further,   in   tube<br>
embodiments having more than two layers, the tube 52 can be symmetrical or asymmetrical from a material aspect and from a thickness of layers aspect.<br>
Suitable polyolefins include homopolymers, copolymers  and terpolymers obtained using, at least in part, monomers selected from a-olefins having from 2 to 12 carbons. One particularly suitable polyolefin is an ethylene and a-olefin interpolymer (which sometimes shall be referred to as a copolymer). Suitable ethylene and a-olefin interpolymers preferably have a density, as measured by ASTM D-792 of less than about 0.915 g/cc and are commonly referred to aa very low density polyethylene (VLDPE), ultra low density ethylene (ULDPE) and the like. The a-olefin should have from 3-17 carbons, more preferably from 4-12 and most preferably 4-8 carbons. In a preferred form of the invention, the ethylene and a-olefin copolymers are obtained using single site catalysts.   Suitable single site catalyst systems, among others, are those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,783,638 and 5,272,236. Suitable ethylene and a- olefin copolymers  include those sold by Dow Chemical Company under the AFFINITY trademark, Dupont-Dow under the ENGAGE trademark and Exxon under the EXACT and PLASTOMER trademarks.<br>
The polyolefins also include modified polyolefins  and modified olefins blended with unmodified olefins.     Suitable modified polyolefins are typically polyethylene or polyethylene copolymers.   The polyethylenes can be ULDPE, low density (LDPE), linear low density (LLDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), and high density polyethylenes (HDPE). The modified polyethylenes may have a density from 0.850-0.95 g/cc.   The polyethylene may be modified by grafting or otherwise chemically, electronically or physically associating a group of carboxylic acids, and carboxylic acid anhydrides.    Suitable modifying groups include,  for example, maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, allylsuccinic acid, cyclohex-4-ene-l,2-dicarboxylic acid, 4-methylcyclohex-4-ene-l,2-dicarboxylic acid, bicyclo[2.2.l]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, x-methylbicyclo[2.2. l]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic   acid,   maleic   anhydride,   itaconic   anhydride,   citraconic   anhyride, allylsuccinic anhydride, citraconic anhydride, allylsuccinic anhydride, cyclohex-4-ene-1,2-dicarboxylic   anhydride,   4-methyIcyclohex-4-ene~l,2-dicarboxylic   anhydride, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride, and x-methylbicyclo[2.2.1 ]hept-5-ene-2,2-dicarboxylic anhydride.<br>
