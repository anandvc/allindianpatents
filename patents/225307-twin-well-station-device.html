The holder and the tray may have complementary locating Means to allow insertion of the inserts in a desired orientation into the wells, and to prevent incorrect insertion in inverse orientation. Preferably the inserts bear a Specific sensitization, e.g. an immunological sensitization, reagents for the assay Reaction are dosed and stabilised in the wells, and a sealing cover retains the Reagents in stable form in storage before use.<br>
US  Patent no.  49112034 describes an apparatus provided for use in an immunoassay for the detection of a target analyte in a liquid sample, comprising a porous reactive filter, having an upper surface and a lower surface, to which is Bound an antibody specific for the target antigen: a holder affixed to the porous Filter, wherein the upper surface and lower surface of the reactive filter are Accessible for passage of liquids through the reactive filter; and an absorbent Container capable of being detachably attached to the holder; and an absorbent material contained within the container so as contact the lower surface of the porous filter when the absorbent container is attached to the holder. A prefilter assembly can optionally be attached to the holder so that the prefilter contacts the upper surface of the reactive fiter. The prefilter assembly, if present, and the absorbent container can readily be detached from the holder to avoid problems of back flow and to allow ease of storage of the disassembled holder and reactive filter for analysis and comparison with related assays, optionally a series of assays run at different times.<br>
U.S. Patent no.5827681 describes a test kit for malaria comprising a slide Incubation chamber, which permits rapid detection of malaria in wet blood samples using a regular transmitted light microscope to detect opaque hemozoin particles<br>
The disturbing rate at which malaria parasites are becoming resistant to ant malarial drugs emphasizes the need for a standardized test. Which can be Readily used by medical and laboratory personnel to determine the parasite's susceptibility to various drugs. The present invention utilizes a method based on chromatographic detection of presence of P. falciparum and P.vivax in the given blood sample and assesses a drug sensitivity upto 99.8% and specificity upto 99.6%. The malaria stix used with the twin well station device has a substantially good shelf life and is economical to produce.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a visual, rapid and sensitive immunoassay for the qualitative differential detection of falciparum and P. vivax for malaria.<br>
The invention will be descried in short with reference to the accompanying<br>
Drawings.<br>
