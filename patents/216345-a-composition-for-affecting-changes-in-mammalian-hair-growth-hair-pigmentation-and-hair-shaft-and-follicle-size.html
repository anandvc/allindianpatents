				<td>REDUCING HAIR GROWTH, HAIR FOLLICLE AND HAIR SHAFT SIZE<br>
AND HAIR PIGMENTATION<br>
Miri Seiberg, Stanley Shapiro, Jue-Chen Liu, Jonathan<br>
Miller<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is related to methods and<br>
compositions effective for reducing hair growth. More<br>
specifically, the present invention is directed to<br>
methods for changing the rate of hair growth, reducing<br>
the size of the hair follicle and the hair shaft, and<br>
reducing hair shaft pigmentation, by topical application<br>
of either botanical extracts containing serine protease<br>
inhibitory activity and in particular soybean extracts<br>
such as soymilk, or mixtures and formulations of the<br>
above, combined with other active ingredients such as<br>
isoflavones.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
One main function of mammalian hair is to provide<br>
environmental protection. However, that function has<br>
largely been lost in humans, in whom hair is kept or<br>
removed essentially for social and cosmetic purposes.<br>
Many procedures are used to remove unwanted hair<br>
including shaving, electrolysis, plucking, laser and<br>
light therapies and injection of therapeutic<br>
antiandrogens. These conventional methods are not<br>
without their shortcomings. Shaving, for instance, may<br>
result in nicks and cuts in the skin"s surface, may<br>
leave a perception of an increase in the rate of hair<br>
regrowth, and may also leave undesirable stubble. While<br>
electrolysis may keep an area free of unwanted hair for<br>
a prolonged period of time, the process is often<br>
expensive and painful and may further result in<br>
scarring. Not only may plucking cause pain and<br>
discomfort, but it often result in a poor removal of<br>
short hair. Several unwanted side effects, such as<br>
effects on muscularity, often accompany the use of<br>
antiandrogens. For these reasons, better methods for<br>
reducing hair growth are needed.<br>
Pseudofolliculitis barbae is an inflammatory hair<br>
disorder, most commonly found on the beard area.<br>
Inflammatory follicular papules result when hair tips<br>
penetrate into the skin rather than passing through the<br>
follicular orifice. This process is extremely common in<br>
black men because their hairs are frequently curly,<br>
exiting the skin at an acute angle. Close shaves,<br>
particularly with a razor blade, predispose them to<br>
pseudofolliculitis barbae. The most effective treatment<br>
available is to allow the hairs to grow well beyond the<br>
skin surface. Such a treatment is often not desired.<br>
Hirsutism is a relatively frequent condition<br>
affecting about 4% of women. Facial hirsutism often<br>
interferes with personal and work activities, and<br>
temporary hair removal is a major component in the<br>
management of hirsute patients. Shaving is the most<br>
frequently used temporary method for facial hair, as<br>
plucking, waxing and depilatories are more difficult to<br>
tolerate and care must be taken to avoid folliculitis,<br>
pigmentation, and scarring. Cosmetic cover-ups are<br>
usually used to hide cuts and stubble and electrolysis<br>
and thermolysis may be used for permanent hair removal<br>
when affordable.<br>
An alternative or complementary desired approach to<br>
hair removal, would be a method to reduce hair growth,<br>
reduce hair follicle and hair shaft size and reduce hair<br>
shaft pigmentation. Such an approach could reduce the<br>
visibility of existing hair, making it softer and<br>
lighter. When combined with other methods of hair<br>
removal such a method could enhance and prolong the<br>
removal effect, and reduce the need and frequency of<br>
hair removal. Long term use of such an approach could<br>
lead to attenuated, soft, pigmentation-reduced hair<br>
growth, that is less visible and does not require the<br>
use of other removal methods.<br>
Reduced hair growth is desired in the axilla area<br>
(fossa axillaris), where deodorants and anti-perspirants<br>
are used to control odor trapped within the axillary<br>
hairs. It would be desired to have products for under-<br>
arm use, which combine deodorant or anti-perspirant<br>
activities with reduced hair growth activity.<br>
African type hair is unique in its morphology -- a<br>
kinky hair shaft with variations in diameter. This<br>
complex shaft structure creates the need for specialized<br>
grooming products and procedures to ensure that the<br>
African type hair maintains cosmetic desired properties.<br>
It is desired to have products that reduce this<br>
complexity and make the African type hair more<br>
manageable, improving its appearance.<br>
It would be desirable to provide a method for<br>
chemically or naturally affecting hair growth, hair<br>
follicle and hair shaft size and hair shaft<br>
pigmentation, which does not cause unwanted side effects<br>
to the user.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention, we<br>
have found compositions and methods for affecting<br>
changes in mammalian hair growth, hair follicle and hair<br>
shaft size and hair pigmentation by topically applying<br>
to the skin of a mammal an effective amount of a<br>
topically active composition comprising protease<br>
inhibitors, botanical extracts, and in particular legume<br>
extracts including, but not limited to, soymilk, for a<br>
period of time sufficient to affect hair growth, hair<br>
follicle and hair shaft size and hair shaft<br>
pigmentation. Such topically active compositions may be<br>
further combined with other active ingredients<br>
including, but not limited to, synthetic or naturally-<br>
occurring isoflavones, to enhance the desired effects on<br>
hair growth and pigmentation.<br>
The compositions and methods of this invention<br>
provide a unique, convenient means for delaying hair<br>
growth, reducing hair follicle and hair shaft size and<br>
hair shaft pigmentation, by using serine protease<br>
inhibitors, botanical extracts of the legume family, and<br>
in particular, but not limited to, soymilk, containing<br>
serine protease inhibitory activity, and their<br>
combinations with isoflavones.<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
As used herein, "mammal" shall mean any member "of<br>
the higher vertebrate animals comprising the class<br>
Mammalia," as defined in Webster"s Medical Desk<br>
Dictionary 407 (1986) , and includes but is not limited<br>
to humans. As used herein "(%, w/v)" shall mean grams<br>
of a given component per 100 ml of the total<br>
composition.<br>
Topically active agents suitable for use in the<br>
composition of the present invention include protease<br>
inhibitors and natural plant extracts having protease<br>
inhibitory activity and mixtures thereof. Preferred<br>
protease inhibitors are serine protease inhibitors, and<br>
in particular Soybean Trypsin Inhibitor ("STI") and the<br>
soybean-derived Bowman Birk Inhibitor ("BBI). Preferred<br>
botanical extracts are of the legume family and in<br>
particular bean extracts, such as soymilk. Preferably,<br>
the protease inhibitors are present in an amount, based<br>
upon the total volume of the composition of the present<br>
invention, of from about 0.0001% (w/v) to about 20%<br>
(w/v), and more preferably from about 0.001% (w/v) to<br>
about 5% (w/v). Preferably, botanical aqueous extracts<br>
such as soymilk are present in an amount of 10-99%<br>
(v/v), and more preferably from 50-99% (v/v).<br>
We have unexpectedly found that when topically<br>
active agents such as described above, and in particular<br>
soymilk or soymilk containing formulations, are enriched<br>
with isoflavones, and in particular soybean-derived<br>
isoflavones, the inhibitory effect on hair growth, hair<br>
dimensions and hair pigmentation is enhanced.<br>
Preferably, the isoflavones are present in the botanical<br>
aqueous extracts such as soymilk in an amount of<br>
0.000005-15% (v/v), and more preferably from 0.00001-10%<br>
(v/v) .<br>
If the delivery parameters of the topically active<br>
pharmaceutical or cosmetic agent so require, the<br>
topically active composition of the present invention<br>
may be further comprised of a pharmaceutically or<br>
cosmetically acceptable vehicle capable of functioning<br>
as a delivery system to enable the penetration of the<br>
topically active agent into the hair follicle and the<br>
skin.<br>
The pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition may be<br>
optionally combined with other ingredients such as<br>
moisturizers, cosmetic adjuvants, anti-oxidants,<br>
depigmenting agents, anti-aging agents, hair removal<br>
agents, hair styling agents, sunscreens surfactants,<br>
foaming agents, conditioners, humectants, fragrances,<br>
colorants, viscosifiers, buffering agents,<br>
preservatives, and the like and mixtures thereof. These<br>
will be combined in an amount which will not affect the<br>
serine protease inhibitory activity, in order to produce<br>
cosmetic or pharmaceutical products such as, non-<br>
exclusively, essences, creams, lotions, pastes, gels,<br>
powders, patches or injectables and the like for the<br>
reduction of hair growth, hair size and hair<br>
pigmentation.<br>
The compositions of this invention may be applied<br>
prior to, concurrently with or after other active<br>
ingredients or compositions to enhance their effect.<br>
For example, the compositions of this invention may be<br>
applied in conjunction with one or more products whose<br>
purpose is to facilitate the removal of hair to to<br>
actually remove hair, reduce hair visibility, improve<br>
hair style or improve hair management. The compositions<br>
of this invention may be applied topically prior to,<br>
during or following hair removal. They may be applied<br>
topically concurrently with one or more of the following<br>
group: depilatory agents, shampoo, hair conditioner,<br>
styling gel, hair care products, waxing products,<br>
shaving products, hair-removal products, after-shave<br>
products, deodorant, anti-perspirant, electrolysis,<br>
laser hair removal, light-induced hair removal, mask or<br>
bath additives.<br>
The compositions of this invention may be applied<br>
daily for at least four to eight weeks, by which an<br>
effect upon the appearance of hair should be observed.<br>
Application may be continued as long as desired to<br>
maintain the condition of the hair. Daily application<br>
to the face may mitigate the condition of<br>
pseudofolliculitis barbae and/or hirsutism; application<br>
to the axillary area may reduce hair growth under the<br>
arms and application to the scalp and hair may assist in<br>
managing and styling African-type hair.<br>
The topically active pharmaceutical or cosmetic<br>
composition should be applied in an amount effective to<br>
effect changes in mammalian hair growth, hair follicle<br>
and hair shaft size and hair shaft pigmentation. As<br>
used herein "amount effective" shall mean an amount<br>
sufficient to cover the region of skin surface where a<br>
delay in hair growth and hair pigmentation and reduced<br>
hair size are desired. Preferably, the composition is<br>
applied to the skin surface such that, based upon a<br>
square cm of skin surface, from about 2 µl /cm2 to about<br>
500 µl /cm2 of topically active agent is present when a<br>
delay in hair growth, hair size and hair pigmentation is<br>
desired.<br>
We have unexpectedly found that when topically<br>
active agents, such as soymilk, or isoflavone-enriched<br>
soymilk are topically applied to an animal"s skin, a<br>
significant delay in hair growth, hair follicle and hair<br>
shaft size and hair shaft pigmentation was achieved. We<br>
further believe that since the hair growth cycle for<br>
humans is often slower than that for mice, it is further<br>
likely that the hair growth delay in humans would be<br>
considerably longer than in mice.<br>
The invention illustratively disclosed herein<br>
suitably might be practiced in the absence of any<br>
component, ingredient, or step which is not specifically<br>
disclosed herein. Several examples are set forth below<br>
to further illustrate the nature of the invention and the<br>
manner of carrying it out. However, the invention should<br>
not be considered as being limited to the details<br>
thereof.<br>
Examples<br>
EXAMPLE 1; Depilation of Test Subjects in the Mouse<br>
System<br>
C57BI/6 or C3H mice (male and female) were obtained<br>
from Charles River (Kingston, NY) , at 8 -10 weeks of age<br>
and were in the resting (telogen) phase of their<br>
respective hair cycle. Hair growth was induced by wax<br>
depilation (plucking) of each respective animal"s back<br>
fur according to the procedure set forth in Stenn, et<br>
al., "Glucocorticoid Effect on Hair Growth Initiation: A<br>
Reconsideration," 6 Skin Pharmacol. , 125 -134 (1993).<br>
In C57B1/6 and C3H mice, 8-10 weeks old, the growth<br>
phase (anagen) starts synchronously in all hair<br>
follicles at the time of depilation. As illustrated in<br>
Table 1, the following observations were noticed at the<br>
induction site:<br>
As shown in Table 1, the hair growth was visible several<br>
days after depilation as the pink skin of the animal<br>
began to darken. This is likely due to hair<br>
pigmentation in the shaft since the C57BI/6 and C3H mice<br>
contained melanocytes only in the hair follicles and not<br>
in the dorsal epidermis. Similar hair growth pattern<br>
was documented in our international application No.<br>
PCT/US 97/11033, when chemical depilation using<br>
commercially available products was performed.<br>
Since the murine hair cycle varies not only between<br>
strains, but also amongst individual animals, the status<br>
of the hair cycle was analyzed in each animal on study.<br>
A 2 cm by 1 cm skin sample was isolated from each mouse<br>
with scissors, fixed with a 10% buffered formalin<br>
solution having a pH of about 6.9 - 7.1 at 25 °C<br>
(Stephens Scientific), and then formed into a paraffin<br>
block according to well-known procedures. The block was<br>
then microtomed, and sections were stained with H&amp;E or<br>
Fontana-Mason stain. Sections were examined<br>
histologically in order to verify the phase of the hair<br>
cycle, the size of the hair follicle and hair shaft and<br>
the level of hair pigmentation, using procedures well<br>
known in the art. Hair length was assessed visually,<br>
and by using a low magnification (x8) dissecting<br>
microscope.<br>
This Example, as well as the one described in our<br>
international application No. PCT/US 97/11033, shows<br>
that the hair growth cycle for C57BI/6 and C3H mice<br>
averaged about 25 days and reports similar timing of<br>
hair follicle and shaft development regardless of the<br>
method used for depilation.<br>
EXAMPLE 2; Preparation of soymilk and sovmilk<br>
formulations<br>
One way to make soymilk is to soak the soybeans in<br>
deionized or purified water for several hours, and grind<br>
them after they were fully hydrated, with the addition<br>
of small quantities of water. (The grinding process<br>
allows the soybean milk to be extracted). After<br>
collection, the soybean milk may be filtered to remove<br>
any residual parts of the bean husk. The soymilk used<br>
in the formulations described below can be fresh soymilk<br>
as described above, or may be made from soybean powder<br>
and water. The soybean powder is milled from soybeans<br>
and may also be lyophilized, spray dried, or freeze-<br>
dried and the resulting soymilk may or may not be<br>
filtered. Such prepared soymilk may have from about 1 to<br>
about 90% by weight dry soybean powder. Another example<br>
is the use of soymilk powder, made from lyophilized,<br>
spray dried or freeze-dried soymilk, with the addition<br>
of water and finished with or without filtration or<br>
homogenization. Other methods of soybean extraction<br>
could also be used to create the active ingredients in<br>
the formulations described below. For example, the<br>
active ingredients could be extracted from ground<br>
soybeans using ethanol/water mixtures, followed by the<br>
removal of the ethanol from the extract, in such ways<br>
that the serine protease inhibitory activity of the<br>
soybean will be retained, and preferably that the<br>
protein STI will remain intact.<br>
The soy products useful in this invention may be<br>
produced from all soybean species, regardless of their<br>
geographic origin, sun exposure, harvest time and the<br>
like. However, specific strains, geographic origins or<br>
growth conditions might be preferred. For example, but<br>
not limiting to, soybean strains particularly rich in its<br>
Soybean Trypsin Inhibitor (STI) content or in isoflavone<br>
content, or growth conditions that result in STI or<br>
isoflavone enrichment in the bean, might be preferred.<br>
It should be noted that the soy products useful in the<br>
compositions of this invention have a distinctive odor,<br>
which may be tolerable in some cultures, but is undesired<br>
in others. If necessary, the odor of the compositions of<br>
this invention may be reduced by using soybean products<br>
derived from specific strains of soybeans known to<br>
produce reduced-odor, including, but not limited to,<br>
lipoxygenase-2-deficient beans and those having modified<br>
sugar profile, and the like. A process to reduce oxygen<br>
levels in the formulation may also reduce the odor.<br>
Various masking agents or fragrances may also be used to<br>
mask the odor.<br>
The compositions of this invention may further comprise<br>
surfactants, moisturizers, humectants, conditioners,<br>
fragrances, colorants, preservatives, anti-oxidants,<br>
depigmenting agents, hair removal agents, anti-aging<br>
agents, sunscreens, foaming agents, cosmetic adjuvants,<br>
buffering agents or mixtures thereof.<br>
The compositions of this invention may be left on the skin<br>
for a period sufficient to effect changes. For example,<br>
the compositions of this invention may be applied to the<br>
skin daily treatment for at least about four weeks, more<br>
preferably, the composition should applied daily for at<br>
least eight weeks.<br>
Another method according to this invention is a method to<br>
reduce or prevent pseudofolliculitis barbae. Daily<br>
application of the compositions of this i nvention may<br>
reduce or prevent this condition. The compositions of this<br>
invention may also be applied daily to the axilliary area<br>
to reduce hair growth. Furthermore, the compositions of<br>
this invention may be applied daily to the scalp to style<br>
and improve management of African type hair.<br>
As shown in our co-pending U.S. Patent Application<br>
(Attorney Docket No. JBP 430), numerous soymilk-based<br>
formulations could be used to reduce pigmentation. All<br>
these formulations could also be used to reduce hair<br>
growth. Some particularly preferred examples of soymilk<br>
formulations and soymilk formulations containing<br>
isoflavones are shown in table 2 below. An example for<br>
an isoflavones preparation that could be used in this<br>
invention is Flavosterone SE from Ichimaru, Japan, which<br>
contains about 0.1% pure isoflavones. In all these<br>
formulations, soymilk could be replaced with the<br>
appropriate quantities of soybean powder or soymilk<br>
powder and water.<br>

Soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) and Bowman-Birk<br>
inhibitor (BBI), from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation were<br>
mixed into a 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Gibco-<br>
BRL, Gaithersburg, MA), pH 7.4, in concentrations of 1%<br>
to 0.001% (w/v) . Four volumes of the resulting<br>
solutions were then mixed with 1 volume of (100 mg/ml)<br>
liposomes vehicle, which was prepared by the methods<br>
described in Niemiec et. al, in order to yield the<br>
topically active composition. Non-ionic liposomes<br>
preparations, such as those disclosed in Niemiec et al.,<br>
"Influence of Nonionic Liposomal Composition On Topical<br>
Delivery of Peptide Drugs Into Pilosebaceous Units: An<br>
In Vivo Study Using the Hamster Ear Model," 12 Pharm.<br>
Res. 1184-88 (1995) ("Niemiec"), which is incorporated<br>
by reference herein in its entirety, are well known in<br>
the art, and are described our U.S. Patent Application<br>
(Attorney Docket No. JBP 430) . GDL liposomes were<br>
prepared as set forth in Niemiec, et al., above, with<br>
the exception of the following changes: the non-ionic<br>
liposomal formulation contained glycerol dilaurate<br>
(Emulsynt GDL, ISP Van Dyk)/cholesterol<br>
(Croda)/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether (Brij76,<br>
ICI)/polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, as at ratio of<br>
37.5:12.5:33.3:16.7. Either PBS or Hepes buffer, 0.05M,<br>
pH 7.4 (Gibco-BRL of Gaithersburg, MD) were used as the<br>
aqueous phase in the preparation of the liposomes.<br>
EXAMPLE 4; Soymilk Delays Hair Growth and reduce hair<br>
follicle and hair shaft size and Hair shaft Pigmentation<br>
C57B1/6 mice were induced for a new hair cycle as<br>
described in Example 1, and treated daily with soymilk.<br>
Animals were observed daily for their hair growth<br>
pattern, and skin biopsies were taken at important time<br>
points of the hair cycle. As a result of soymilk<br>
treatment the hair growth of the treated mice was<br>
delayed, and their hairs were visibly thinner, and<br>
smoother to touch. Treated mice did not show skin<br>
darkness at days 7-8 of the hair cycle, as expected, and<br>
hair shafts were not visible at days 11-12 as in the<br>
control animals. In average, the hair cycle of the<br>
soymilk treated mice was delayed by 3-6 days. Figure 1<br>
is a picture of the mice fur, showing the difference in<br>
hair appearance, color, size and thickness following<br>
soymilk treatment.<br>
Histological examination of the biopsied skin<br>
samples confirmed these observations. As shown in<br>
Figure 2 by Fontana-Mason (F&amp;M) staining, at day four of<br>
the hair cycle the untreated hair follicle is fully<br>
developed, as expected, containing all the cellular<br>
layers and pigment deposition. In contrast, the soymilk<br>
treated sample, (shown at same magnification), shows a<br>
smaller and not as fully developed hair follicle, with<br>
no pigment deposition.<br>
Figure 3 shows two sets of histological sections<br>
stained with F&amp;M, of lower and higher magnification.<br>
These sections are from day seven of the hair cycle.<br>
The upper panel shows that soymilk treated skin has<br>
smaller, shorter, and less pigmented hair follicles than<br>
the untreated control. The lower panel shows a higher<br>
magnification of the follicles, further demonstrating<br>
the difference in hair follicle and hair shaft size and<br>
pigmentation following soymilk treatment.<br>
Figure 4 shows low magnification of F&amp;M stained<br>
skin sections at day 18 of the hair cycle. At this<br>
magnification it is obvious that soymilk treatment<br>
results in reduced hair follicle size, which leads to<br>
reduced hair shaft length and thickness, and reduced<br>
total pigment deposition within the treated follicles.<br>
Figure 5 shows skin sections at day 21 of the hair<br>
cycle, with two magnifications. The upper panel<br>
demonstrates that the control animals were in the<br>
catagen stage, when hair follicles are regressing.<br>
Soymilk treated follicles, on the other hand, had<br>
already completed the catagen stage, as they are shown<br>
in telogen, the resting stage. This indicates that not<br>
only the hair cycle was delayed following soymilk<br>
treatment, it was also prematurely terminated. The<br>
lower panel demonstrates the catagen control follicle<br>
and the shorter, telogen (resting) soymilk-treated<br>
follicle using higher magnification.<br>
EXAMPLE 5; The effects of soymilk on hair growth, size<br>
and pigmentation are reproducible in C3H mice<br>
In order to verify that the effect of soymilk on<br>
hair growth is not specific to C57B1/6 mice, we repeated<br>
the experiment described in Example 4 using the brown<br>
haired (Agouti) C3H mice. The results of these<br>
experiments were similar both visually and<br>
histologically. Soymilk delayed hair growth and reduced<br>
hair follicle and hair shaft size and pigment deposition<br>
in the C3H mice.<br>
Histological analysis confirmed these visual<br>
observations. As shown in the upper panel of Figure 6,<br>
using F&amp;M staining, at day seven of the hair cycle<br>
soymilk treated follicles are smaller and accumulate<br>
less pigment than untreated controls. The upper panel<br>
of Figure 7 (F&amp;M staining) shows a lower magnification<br>
of the same skin sections, demonstrating the thinner and<br>
less pigmented follicles following soymilk treatment.<br>
Figure 8 shows F&amp;M stained skin sections at day 21<br>
of the hair cycle. As shown for the C57B1/6 mice,<br>
following soymilk treatment the hair cycle terminates<br>
prematurely. Soymilk treated follicles are in the<br>
resting state, while untreated control follicles are<br>
still in catagen.<br>
EXAMPLE 6; The effects of soymilk and soybean derived<br>
serine protease inhibitors on hair growth, size and<br>
pigmentation<br>
In search for a mechanism to explain the effect of<br>
soymilk on hair growth, we tested the effect of the<br>
soymilk-derived serine protease inhibitors, STI and BBI.<br>
We had shown earlier that these proteins induce<br>
depigmentation in skin, by affecting the PAR-2 pathway<br>
(U.S. Patent Application, Attorney Docket No. JBP 430) .<br>
The experiments described in Example 4 were<br>
repeated using STI, BBI, and soymilk. STI and BBI were<br>
used in a PBS-liposome vehicle as described in Example<br>
3. Visual observations throughout the hair cycle<br>
confirmed that both STI and BBI could delay hair growth<br>
and reduce hair follicle and hair shaft size, similar to<br>
soymilk (see hair pictures in Figure 9) . Using high<br>
concentrations of STI or BBI, the effect on hair growth<br>
and pigmentation was substantial.<br>
Histological analysis confirmed these finding. As<br>
shown in Fig. 6, at day seven of the hair cycle 1% of<br>
STI and 1% of BBI reduce hair follicle and hair shaft<br>
size and hair shaft pigmentation in C3H mice. Figure 7<br>
shows lower magnification sections of the same day into<br>
the hair cycle, demonstrating smaller hair follicles and<br>
hair shafts and reduced pigmentation, relative to<br>
untreated control, with soymilk, STI or BBI treatment.<br>
Figure 10 shows that STI and BBI have the same effect in<br>
C57B1/6 mice too, demonstrating smaller and less<br>
pigmented follicles. Taken together, this example shows<br>
that STI and BBI are soybean-derived serine protease<br>
inhibitors, found in soymilk, that could delay hair<br>
growth, reduce hair follicle and hair shaft size and<br>
reduce hair pigmentation. STI and BBI could represent a<br>
part of the soymilk ingredients that affects hair<br>
growth.<br>
In order to support the hypothesis that STI and BBI<br>
in soymilk are involved in the hair growth effects<br>
described above, we tested soymilk for its serine<br>
protease inhibitory activity. An enzymatic assay was<br>
performed using "Enzchek", a protease digestion<br>
fluorescent test system made by Molecular Probes of<br>
Eugene, OR. Using 100 units of trypsin (from Sigma<br>
chemicals, St. Louis MO) the test system produced<br>
fluorescence reading of about 1100 units. This reaction<br>
was inhibited with increasing concentrations of STI, as<br>
expected from a known trypsin inhibitor. Serial<br>
dilutions of soymilk were tested in this assay, and<br>
found to inhibit trypsin activity. As shown in Figure<br>
11, soymilk exerts trypsin inhibitory activity similar<br>
to about 0.2% of pure STI. This suggests that soymilk<br>
could exert its hair growth effect, at least in part, by<br>
STI and BBI.<br>
EXAMPLE 7:___Soymilk Induces Chancres in Tyrosinase and<br>
TRP-1 protein expression<br>
The histological analyses of soymilk treated skin<br>
samples described in the examples above show dramatic<br>
reduction in pigment deposition within the hair<br>
follicle. To further understand the mechanism of<br>
soymilk-induced depigmentation, we studied tyrosinase,<br>
the key enzyme in melanogenesis and Tyrosinase-Related<br>
Protein-1 (TRP-1), the enzyme that stabilizes<br>
tyrosinase. C57B1/6 and C3H mice were treated as<br>
described above, and samples were collected throughout<br>
the study for protein analysis. Protein extraction and<br>
Western blot analysis were performed using standard<br>
procedures, such as the one described in Current<br>
Protocols in Cell Biology, Edited by Juan S. Bonifacino<br>
et al. Chapter 6: Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting.<br>
Copyright 1999 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. An<br>
example of one such study is shown in Figure 12.<br>
Equal amounts of skin-extracted proteins were probed<br>
with the anti-tyrosinase antibody "anti PEP1", and with<br>
the anti-TRP-1 antibody "anti PEP7" which are described<br>
in Jimenez, M., Kameyama, K., Maloy, WL, Tomita Y., and<br>
Hearing, V. Mammalian tyrosinase: biosynthesis,<br>
processing and modulation by melanocyte stimulating<br>
hormone. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1988), 85:3830-34,<br>
and Jimenez, M., K., Maloy, WL, and Hearing, V.<br>
Specific identification of an authentic tyrosinase<br>
clone. J. Biol. Chem. (1989) 264:3397-3403, which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
As shown in Figure 12, The expression of Tyrosinase<br>
and TRP-1 proteins is dramatically affected by soymilk<br>
treatment. Tyrosinase and TRP-1 levels are reduced, and<br>
the duration of the expression is shortened. These two<br>
factors affect overall hair pigmentation, which is<br>
reduced due to the reduced level and shorter duration of<br>
melanogenesis.<br>
EXAMPLE 8; Soymilk reduces human facial hair lenath and<br>
thickness<br>
An individual male with dark facial hair who shaves<br>
daily was treating the right side of his face with<br>
soymilk, immediately after shaving, for five weeks. By<br>
the third week, and more noticeably by the forth week,<br>
the hair of the treated side was visually lighter and<br>
felt smoother to touch. Digital pictures at different<br>
magnifications were taken throughout the treatment<br>
period, using Hi-Scope. These pictures clearly<br>
demonstrate the reduced size and thickness of the hair<br>
shafts at the treated side. An example of such pictures<br>
is shown in Figure 13, demonstrating the difference in<br>
hair shaft thickness and density at four weeks of<br>
treatment. Since both sides of the face were shaved at<br>
the same time, and pictures of both sides were taken at<br>
the same time, the difference in length of the facial<br>
hair indicates slower growth rate at the treated area.<br>
Figure 14 shows a computerized image analysis of<br>
the facial hair length, thickness and total area,<br>
following four weeks of soymilk treatment. All images<br>
were analyzed with Image Pro Plus 3.0 software (Media<br>
Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) . Data are presented as<br>
average of 180 hair shafts of each side of the face,<br>
with standard deviation (SigmaPlot® 5.0, SPSS Science,<br>
Chicago, IL) . Statistical analysis was performed using<br>
SigmaStat® 2.0 (SPSS Science) software, demonstrating a<br>
statistical significant difference in all measured<br>
parameters, following soymilk treatment.<br>
EXAMPLE 9; Soymilk reduces human legs hair length and<br>
thickness<br>
Hair was wax-depilated of two symmetrical areas of<br>
the medial part of the legs, below the knee, in one<br>
individual. One leg was treated daily, for four weeks,<br>
with soymilk. Visual observations indicate slower hair<br>
growth on the treated site. Hair shafts were reduced in<br>
number and were shorter and thinner than those of the<br>
untreated site, as shown in Figure 15. These<br>
observations further confirm the effect of soymilk on<br>
hair growth. Examples 8 and 9 together confirm that the<br>
effect of soymilk on human hair growth is not related to<br>
the method of hair removal or to the body part being<br>
treated.<br>
EXAMPLE 10:______Soymilk formulations enriched with<br>
isoflavones are preferred to soymilk formulations in<br>
reducing hair growth and pigmentation.<br>
The experiments described in Example 4 were<br>
repeated, using two formulations described in Table 2<br>
above, Soymilk Essence 23 which is a soymilk-based<br>
formulation, and soymilk Essence 30 which is identical<br>
to Soymilk Essence 23 except the addition of 5% of a<br>
0.1% isoflavones extract. As shown in Figure 16, mice<br>
treated with Soymilk essence 23 show reduced hair growth<br>
and nicer hair appearance. This effect was more<br>
pronounced with the use of soymilk Essence 30,<br>
demonstrating that isoflavone-enriched soymilk<br>
formulations are superior to soymilk formulations in<br>
reducing hair growth. Figure 17 shows histological skin<br>
sections of the treated mice, at day 15 of the<br>
treatment. The hair shafts documented in these sections<br>
clearly demonstrate the reduction in hair shaft<br>
dimensions, the reduced level of pigmentation within the<br>
hair shaft, and the increased smoothness of the hair<br>
shaft following the Soymilk Essence treatments.<br>
EXAMPLE 11;______Soymilk formulations enriched with<br>
isoflavonea are preferred to isoflavone formulations<br>
which are effective in reducing hair growth and<br>
pigmentation.<br>
The experiments described in Example 4 were<br>
repeated, using formulations described in Table 2 above,<br>
of soymilk essence with or without increasing<br>
concentrations of isoflavones. These Soy Essence<br>
formulations were compare to similar formulations, where<br>
the soymilk component only was replaced with water.<br>
These three sets of formulations (Soy Essence,<br>
isoflavones, Soy Essence containing additional<br>
isoflavones) were prepared to test the possibility that<br>
isoflavones might be sufficient for the effect observed<br>
on hair growth. Figure 18 shows the C57B1/6 mouse hair<br>
following three weeks of topical treatment, as described<br>
in example 4. Both untreated control mice and placebo<br>
treated mice have long and less "ordered" hair. Soymilk<br>
Essence 23 reduces hair growth and leads to a nicer<br>
appearance, as described earlier in this application.<br>
Soymilk Essence formulations containing 1, 5 and 10% of<br>
a 0.1% isoflavones containing extract result in a<br>
superior effect on hair growth. However, formulations<br>
containing isoflavones but no soymilk demonstrate<br>
milder, and not as superior effect as when combined with<br>
soymilk. This example demonstrates that soymilk<br>
formulations containing isoflavone could reduce hair<br>
growth. This example further demonstrates that soymilk<br>
formulations containing isoflavones reduce hair growth<br>
to a higher degree than formulations containing<br>
isoflavones alone.<br>
Example 12: Soy Essence formulations affect human hair<br>
growth<br>
The efficacy and irritancy potential of Soymilk<br>
Essence 23 and 3 0 compared to a placebo formulation were<br>
examined in a blinded placebo-controlled four-week test<br>
with twelve pre-menopausal female panelists ages 29 to<br>
45 by evaluations by the study investigator, self-<br>
assessment by panelists and Hi-scope image analysis.<br>
Panelists signed an Informed Consent and were instructed<br>
about study procedures and expectations and were asked<br>
to shave that night. At the baseline visit the<br>
following day, two test lotions were distributed to each<br>
panelist (Day 1) , a placebo lotion and either soymilk<br>
Essence 23 or 30. The lotions were randomly assigned to<br>
either the right leg or left leg. The test lotions and<br>
placebo were used on the respective legs for the<br>
duration of the study with no other lotions used on the<br>
lower legs. Panelists were instructed to apply the test<br>
lotions twice daily, morning and evenings and were also<br>
instructed to try to refrain from shaving their lower<br>
legs until after each weekly evaluation. On evaluation<br>
days, the investigator visually inspected the panelists"<br>
legs for any clinical signs of irritation and compared<br>
legs for hair growth attenuation. Self-assessment<br>
questionnaires were completed by panelists at each<br>
evaluation time point (Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4) . In<br>
addition, Hi-scope images (2.5 cm in diameter for each<br>
image, KH-2400R, Hirox) were obtained at each time point<br>
using a MX-MACROZ lens (Hirox).<br>
No panelists dropped from the study for any<br>
product-related reason. No signs of irritation were<br>
seen in any of the study panelists at any time point,<br>
nor was any irritation reported when self-assessed by<br>
panelists at any time point during the study.<br>
For the purpose of hair counts all hair, including<br>
"stubble", were counted in the given 2.5 cm field for<br>
each panelist at each time point. Results showed a<br>
decrease in lower leg hair counts by week 5 for Soymilk<br>
Essence 30 and by week 4 for Soymilk Essence 23. The<br>
placebo treated legs did not show a change in mean leg<br>
hair counts throughout the study although the standard<br>
deviations were large. The growth rate was calculated<br>
by dividing the length of time (in days) since the<br>
panelist last shaved, by the average length of leg hairs<br>
for that panelist, which was calculated from the hi-<br>
scope images using Image Pro Plus analysis for each<br>
panelist at each test site. The results are documented<br>
in Table 3, demonstrating that both Soymilk Essences 23<br>
and 30 treatments resulted in reduced hair growth rate<br>
compared to placebo.<br>
Results from panelists" self-assessment questionnaires<br>
showed that panelists felt that the test lotions attenuated<br>
hair growth and softened the feel of leg hair, compared to<br>
the placebo lotion. Panelists felt that the hair felt less<br>
coarse and less stubbley. The majority of the panelists<br>
believed that the test lotions were attenuating leg hair<br>
growth or altering the texture of the hair so that it felt<br>
smoother and less coarse. Hi Scope analysis further<br>
demonstrated that the hair re-growth following treatment with<br>
Soymilk Essence 23 or 30 seemed to be growing in the same<br>
direction and was more uniform in shape, texture and<br>
appearance. In contrast, the hair that re-grew on the<br>
placebo- treated legs grew in different directions, differing<br>
in length, angle of growth and thickness.<br>
This Example clearly demonstrate the effect of soymilk<br>
formulations in delaying and reducing hair growth, and<br>
enabling the growth of softer, less coarse and more managed<br>
and directionally-organized hair.<br>
