				<td>Field of the Inventioo<br>
This invention relates to novel substituted imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine compounds,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and the use of such compounds as corticotropin<br>
releasing factor 1 (CRF1) receptor antagonists in the treatment of psychiatric disorders<br>
and neurological diseases.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a 41 amino acid peptide that is the primary<br>
physiological regulator of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptide secretion from<br>
the anterior pituitary gland [J. Rivier et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci (USA) 80:4851 (1983);<br>
W. Vale et al., Science 213:1394 (1981)]. In addition to its endocrine role at the pituitary<br>
gland, immunohistochemical localization of CRF has demonstrated that the hormone has<br>
a broad extrahypothalamic distribution in the central nervous system and produces a wide<br>
spectrum of autonomic, electrophysiological and behavioral effects consistent with a<br>
neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role in the brain [W. Vale et al., Rec. Prog. Horm.<br>
Res. 39:245 (1983); G. F. Koob, Persp. Behav. Med. 2:39 (1985); E. B. De Souza et al., J.<br>
Neurosci. 5:3189 (1985) ]. There is also evidence that CRF plays a significant role in<br>
integrating the response in the immune system to physiological, psychological, and<br>
immunological stressors [J. E. Blalock, Physiological Reviews 69:1 (1989); J. E. Morley,<br>
Life Sci. 41:527(1987)].<br>
There is evidence that CRF has a role in psychiatric disorders and neurological<br>
diseases including depression, anxiety-related disorders and feeding disorders. A role for<br>
CRF has also been postulated in the etiology and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease,<br>
Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and<br>
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as they relate to the dysfunction of CRF neurons in the<br>
central nervous system [for a review, see: E. B. De Souze, Hosp. Practice 23:59 (1988)].<br>
Furthermore, CRF is known to have a broad extrahypothalmic distribution in the CNS,<br>
contributing therein to a wide spectrum of autonomic behavioral and physiological effects<br>
[see, e.g., Vale et al., 1983; Koob, 1985; and E. B. De Souze et al.. 1985]. For example,<br><br>
CRF concentrations are significantly increased in the cerebral spinal fluid of patients<br>
afflicted with affective disorder or major depression [C. B. Nemeroff et al., Science<br>
226:1342 (1984); C. M. Banki et al., Am. J. Psychiatry 144:873 (1987); R. D. France et<br>
al., Biol. Psychiatry 28:86 (1988); M. Arato et al., Biol. Psychiatry 25:355 (1989)].<br>
Moreover, excessive levels of CRF are known to produce anxiogenic effects in animal<br>
models [see, e.g., Britton et al., 1982; Berridge and Dunn, 1986 and 1987].<br>
The density of CRF receptors is significantly decreased in the frontal cortex of suicide<br>
victims, consistent with a hypersecretion of CRF [C. B. Nemeroff et al., Arch. Gen.<br>
Psychiatry 45:577 (1988)]. In addition, there is a blunted adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)<br>
response to CRF (intravenously administered) observed in depressed patients [P.W. Gold<br>
et al., Am. J. Psychiatry 141:619 (1984); F. Holsboer et al., Psychoneuroendocrinology<br>
9:147 (1984); P. W. Gold et al., New Engl. J. Med. 314:1129 (1986)]. Preclinical studies<br>
in rats and non-human primates provide additional support for the hypothesis that<br>
hypersecretion of CRF may be involved in the symptoms seen in human depression [R.<br>
M. Sapolsky, Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 46:1047 (1989)]. There is also preliminary evidence<br>
that tricyclic antidepressants can alter CRF levels and thus modulate the numbers of<br>
receptors in the brain [Grigoriadis et al., Neuropsychopliannacology 2:53 (1989)].<br>
Neurochemical, endocrine and receptor binding studies have all demonstrated<br>
interactions between CRF and benzodiazepine anxiolytics, providing further evidence for<br>
the involvement of CRF in these disorders. Chlordiazepoxide attenuates the "anxiogenic"<br>
effects of CRF both in the conflict test [K. T. Britton et al., Psycliopharmacology 86:170<br>
(1985); K.T. Britton et al., Psychopharmacology 94:306 (1988)] and in the acoustic<br>
startle test [N. R. Swerdlow et al., Psycliopharmacology 88:147 (1986)] in rats. The<br>
benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788, which was without behavioral activity<br>
alone in the operant conflict test, reversed the effects of CRF in a dose-dependent manner<br>
while the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 enhanced the actions of CRF [K. T.<br>
Britton et al., Psychopharmacology 94:396 (1988)]. Preliminary studies using the putative<br>
CRF receptor antagonist a-helical ovine CRF (9-41) in a variety of behavioral paradigms<br>
demonstrates that the antagonist produces "anxiolytic-like" effects that are qualitatively<br>
similar to the benzodiazepines [C. W. Berridge and A. J. Dunn, Horm. Behav. 21:393<br>
(1987), Brain Research Reviews 15:71 (1990)].<br><br>
CRF receptor subtypes, CRF1 and CRF2, have been identified and are distributed<br>
heterogeneously within the brain [D. T. Chalmers et al., TIPS 17:166-72 (1996)] thereby<br>
suggesting potential functional diversity [S. C. Heinrichs et al., Regul. Peptides 71:15<br>
(1997)]. For example, widely distributed brain CRF1 receptors are strongly implicated in<br>
emotionality accompanying exposure to environmental stressors [G. Liebsch et al., Regul.<br>
Peptides 59: 229-39 (1995); D. W. Schulz, PNAS 93: 10477-82 (1996)]. Significantly,<br>
CRF1, not CRF2, receptors appear to mediate select anxiogenic like behaviors [Heinrichs<br>
et al., 1997]. A more discrete septal/hypothalmic distribution [D. T. Chalmers.et al., J.<br>
Neurosci. 15(10): 6340-50 (1995)] and the availability of alternative endogenous ligands<br>
[J. Vaughan et al., Nature 378: 287-92 (1995)] suggest an altogether different functional<br>
role for the CRF2 receptor [Heinrichs et al., 1997]. For example, a novel CRF-family<br>
neuropeptide with preferential affinity for CRF2 relative to CRF1 receptors is reported to<br>
suppress appetite without producing the profile of behavioral activation observed with<br>
selective CRF1 agonism (H. Tezval et al., PNAS 101(25): 9468-9473 (2004)]. In many<br>
cases, CRF2 agonism produces similar effects to those reported for CRF1 antagonists or<br>
CRF1 gene deletion [S. C. Heinrichs, Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 20(8):311-5<br>
(1999)]. While CRF2 agonists have been proposed as antiobesity agents, CRF1<br>
antagonists may be an important treatment for obesity as well [C. Contoreggi et al.,<br>
Neuroendocrinology 80(2): 111-23 (2004)].<br>
In view of the above, efficacious and selective antagonists of CRF1 are desired as<br>
potentially valuable therapeutic agents for the treatment of psychiatric disorders and<br>
neurological diseases. It is thus desirable to discover new CRF1 antagonists.<br>

"Pharmaceutical Salts," J. Pharm. Sci.. 66,1-19 (1977). Lists of suitable salts are found<br>
in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing. Company, Easton,<br>
Pa., 1985, p. 1418.<br>
It will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of Formula<br>
I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
"Therapeutically effective amount" or "effective amount" means the amount of<br>
the compound of formula I of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition<br>
containing a compound of formula I of the present invention that will elicit the biological<br>
or medical response of or desired therapeutic effect on a tissue, system, animal or human<br>
that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.<br>
The terms "treatment," "treat," "treating," and the like, are meant to include both<br>
slowing or reversing the progression of a disorder. These terms also include alleviating,<br>
ameliorating, attenuating, eliminating, or reducing one or more symptoms of a disorder or<br>
condition, even if the disorder or condition is not actually eliminated and even if<br>
progression of the disorder or condition is not itself slowed or reversed. The term<br>
"treatment" and like terms also include preventive (e.g., prophylactic) and palliative<br>
treatment. Prevention of the disease is manifested by a prolonging or delaying of the<br>
onset of the symptoms of the disease.<br>
The symbol"	" in a molecular structure indicates the position of attachment<br>
for that particular substituent.<br>
When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or in formula I,<br>
its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other<br>
occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if<br>
such combinations result in stable compounds. In choosing compounds of the present<br>
invention, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the various substituents, i.e.<br>
R \ R2, etc., are to be chosen in conformity with well- known principles of chemical<br>
structure connectivity.<br>
Under standard nomenclature used throughout this disclosure, the terminal portion<br>
of the designated side chain is described first, followed by the adjacent functionality<br>
toward the point of attachment. For example, an arylcarbonylaminoalkyl substituent is<br>
equivalent to aryl-C(0)-NH-alkyl-.<br><br>
The present invention contemplates specific classes of compounds of Formula I.<br>
The following paragraphs describe such specific classes:<br><br>
While all the compounds of Formula I are useful CRF1 receptor antagonists, the<br>
following paragraphs describe further specific classes:<br>
(a)	Each of R1 and R3 is methyl and each of R5a and R5b is ethyl;<br>
(b)	R1 and R3 are methyl, R5a and R5b are ethyl, and R° is hydrogen;<br>
(c)	R1 and R3 are methyl, R5a and R5b are ethyl, and R° and R4 are hydrogen;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Preferably compounds of the invention exhibit a Ki value for CRF1 binding of 1<br>
micromolar or less, more preferably of 500 nanomolar or less. Even more preferably,<br>
compounds of the invention exhibit a Ki value for CRF1 binding of 250 nanomolar or<br>
less, with 100 nanomolar or less being even further preferred. With even greater<br>
preference, compounds of the invention exhibit a Ki value for CRF1 binding of 30<br>
nanomolar or less, while 15 nanomolar or less is even more greatly preferred.<br>
Compounds of the invention exhibiting a Ki value for CRF1 binding of 5 nanomolar or<br>
less are most preferred.<br>
The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceuticaUy acceptable salt thereof and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient. A "pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier, diluent, or excipient" is a medium generally accepted in the art for the delivery of<br>
biologically active agents to mammals, e.g., humans. Such carriers are generally<br>
formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art to determine and account for. These include, without limitation: the type<br>
and nature of the active agent being formulated; the subject to which the agent-containing<br>
composition is to be administered; the intended route of administration of the<br>
composition; and the therapeutic indication being targeted. Pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers and excipients include both aqueous and non-aqueous liquid media, as well as a<br>
variety of solid and semi- solid dosage forms. Such carriers can include a number of<br>
different ingredients and additives in addition to the active agent, such additional<br>
ingredients being included in the formulation for a variety of reasons, e.g., stabilization of<br>
the active agent, well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of suitable<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and factors involved in their selection, are found in<br>
a variety of readily available sources, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17 th<br>
ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985.<br>
These compounds of formula I may be administered orally, topically, parenterally,<br>
by inhalation or spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional<br>
non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of general formula I may<br>
be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or<br>
oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsion, hard or soft capsules, or<br>
syrups or elixirs.<br>
Dosage forms suitable for administration generally contain from about 1 mg to<br>
about 300 mg of active ingredient per unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions, the<br>
active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.5 to 95% by weight<br>
based on the total weight of the composition. Appropriate coatings may be applied to<br>
increase palatability or delayed adsorption.<br>
The compounds of formula I are antagonists at the CRF1 receptor and are useful<br>
in the treatment of anxiety disorders, depression, major depressive disorder, and stress<br>
related disorders. Anxiety disorders are a group of diseases, recognized in the art, that<br>
includes phobic disorders, anxiety states, post-traumatic stress disorder and atypical<br>
anxiety disorders [The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 16 th edition (1992)].<br>
Emotional stress is often a precipitating factor in anxiety disorders, and such disorders<br>
generally respond to medications that lower response to stress. The compounds are also<br>
useful in smoking cessation programs. The method of treatment involves administration<br>
to a mammal (e.g. a human) an effective amount of a compound of the invention. In<br>
particular, therapeutically effective amounts of the compounds of this invention are<br>
amounts effective to antagonize, or lower, levels of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)<br>
in a mammal (e.g. a human), thereby alleviating in the mammal's conditions<br>
characterized by abnormally high levels of CRF expression.<br>
As such, the present invention provides a method for treating a condition which is<br>
treatable by reducing CRF1 receptor stimulation, comprising administering to the<br>
mammal (e.g. a human) in need thereof a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, in an amount effective to antagonize CRF1 receptor stimulation.<br><br>
The present invention also provides use of a compound of Formula I for the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for treating a condition which is treatable by reducing<br>
CRF1 receptor stimulation.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of antagonizing CRF1 receptors in a<br>
warm-blooded animal, comprising administering to the animal a compound of the<br>
invention at amount effective to antagonize CRF1 receptors. The warm-blooded animal is<br>
preferably a mammal, and more preferably a human.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of treating a disorder in a warm-<br>
blooded animal, which disorder manifests hypersecretion of CRF, or the treatment of<br>
which disorder can be effected or facilitated by antagonizing CRF1 receptors, comprising<br>
administering to the animal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the<br>
invention. The warm-blooded animal is preferably a mammal, and more preferably a<br>
human.<br>
Compounds of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are useful<br>
for treating various disorders and conditions in a mammal (e.g. human) including social<br>

A compound of this invention can be administered to treat the above disorders or<br>
abnormalities by means that produce contact of the active agent with the agent's site of<br>
action in the body of a mammal (e.g. human), such as by oral or parenteral administration<br>
using appropriate dosage forms. The compounds can be administered by any conventional<br>
means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals either as individual<br>
therapeutic agent or in combination of merapeutic agents. It can be administered alone,<br>
but will generally be administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of<br>
the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
The therapeutically effective amounts of the compounds of the invention for<br>
treating the diseases or disorders described above in a warm-blooded animal can be<br>
determined in a variety of ways known to those of ordinary skill in the art, e.g., by<br>
administering various amounts of a particular agent to an animal afflicted with a<br>
particular condition and then determining the effect on the animal. Typically,<br><br>
therapeutically effective amounts of a compound of this invention can be orally<br>
administered daily at a dosage of the active ingredient of 0.002 to 200 mg/kg of body<br>
weight. Ordinarily, a dose of 0.01 to 10 mg/kg in divided doses one to four times a day, or<br>
in sustained release formulation will be effective in obtaining the desired pharmacological<br>
effect. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose levels for any particular<br>
patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific<br>
compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of<br>
administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination and the<br>
severity of the particular disease. Frequency of dosage may also vary depending on the<br>
compound used and the particular disease treated. However, for treatment of most CNS<br>
disorders, a dosage regimen of four-times daily or less is preferred. For the treatment of<br>
stress and depression, a dosage regimen of one or two-times daily is particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
It will be appreciated that all combinations of specific and preferred embodiments<br>
discussed above and the examples discussed below are contemplated as being<br>
encompassed by the present invention, provided such combinations do not comprise<br>
inconsistent groupings. In addition, all examples described herein are for illustrative<br>
purposes, and are not intended to narrow the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
Compounds of the invention can generally be prepared using the synthetic routes<br>
illustrated in the Schemes below. Starting materials can be prepared by procedures<br>
described in these schemes or by procedures that would be well known to one of ordinary<br>
skill in organic chemistry. The variables used in the schemes are as defined below or as in<br>
the claims.<br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that the introduction of certain substituents will<br>
create asymmetry in the compounds of Formula I. The present invention contemplates all<br>
enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers and stereoisomers, that is, both the<br>
stereomerically pure form (e.g., geometrically pure, enantiomerically pure, or<br>
diastereomerically pure) and enantiomeric and stereoisomeric mixtures, including<br>
racemates. Enantiomeric and stereoisomeric mixtures can be resolved into their<br>
component enantiomers or stereoisomers by well known methods, such as chiral phase<br>
gas chromatography, chiral-phase high performance liquid chromatography, or<br>
crystallizing the compound as a chiral salt complex. Enantiomers and stereoisomers can<br><br>
also be obtained from stereomerically- or enantiomerically-pure intermediates, reagents,<br>
and catalysts by well known asymmetric synthetic methods.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are contemplated to be within the scope of the<br>
present invention. The compounds of the present invention are bases and salts of such<br>
compounds may be formed with acids, for example, a salt with inorganic acid such as<br>
hydrochloric acid or a salt with organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be prepared by employing reactions as<br>
shown in the following schemes, in addition to other standard manipulations that are<br>
known in the literature or exemplified in the experimental procedures. These schemes,<br>
therefore, are not limited by the compounds listed nor by any particular substituents<br>
employed for illustrative purposes.<br><br>
R1, R3, R5a, and R5* are defined supra.<br>
In Scheme I, a substituted 3-amino-pyridazine 1 is acylated with pivaloyl halide<br>
and a base, e.g., triethylarnine in a polar aprotic solvent, e.g., methylene chloride at from<br><br>
room temperature to the reflux to give amide 2. Amide 2 is treated with a Grignard<br>
reagent in diethylether or THF to give the 4-substituted amide 3. Amide 3 is hydrolyzed<br>
with aqueous HC1 at from room temperature to 110 °C then neutralized to provide free<br>
amine 4. Amine 4 is treated with an alpha-halo ketone and base, e.g., sodium bicarbonate<br>
in 95% ethanol at from room temperature to 110 °C to give imidazopyridazine 5.<br>
Imidazopyridazine 5 is treated with a halogenating reagent e.g., N-iodo or N-<br>
bromosuccinimide in a polar aprotic solvent (e.g., acetonitrile) at from 0 °C to room<br>
temperature to give halide 6. Halide 6 undergoes halogen metal exchange with an alkyl<br>
lithium reagent, e.g., n-, sec-, or tert- butyllithium in diethyledier or THF at from -78 °C<br>
to room temperature, followed by treatment with a trialkylborate, e.g., trimethylborate to<br>
give an intermediate boronic ester, which is hydrolyzed upon workup with aqueous HC1<br>
to provide boronic acid 7.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
R1, R2, R3, R5a, R5b R6, R7, R8, U, and z arc defined supra.<br>
In Scheme II equation 1, halide 6 can be used in a coupling reaction with a 5-<br>
membered ring heterocyclic boronic acid 8 in the presence of palladium catalysis, e.g.,<br>
tetrakis-triphenylphosphine palladium (0) in a lower alkanol (methanol or n- or i-<br>
propanol)/DME mixture at from 70-120 °C to give compounds of formula I.<br>
Alternately in equation 2, boronic acid 7 can be used in a coupling reaction with a<br>
5 membered ring heterocyclic halide 9 and palladium catalysis, e.g., tetrakis-<br>
triphenylphosphine palladium (0) in a lower alkanol (methanol or n- or i-propanol)/DME<br>
mixture at from 70-120 °C to give a compound of formula I.<br>
In equation 3, 5-membered ring heterocyclic halides 9 may undergo halogen-<br>
lithium exchange with, e.g., n-, sec- or tert-butyl lithium in THF or ether at -65 °C,<br>
followed by lithium-zinc exchange with ZnCk in either diethylether or THF at<br>
temperatures up to room temperature. The in situ organozinc reagent 10 may then<br>
undergo coupling with halide 6 in the presence of palladium, e.g., PdC^dppf) in THF at<br>
from 70-120°C to give a compound of formula I.<br>
In equation 4, a 5-membered heterocyclic ring with a ring proton may be lithiated<br>
by either an alkyllithium, e.g., n-, sec- or tert-butyl lithium or lithium diisopropyl amide<br>
in THF or ether at -65 °C to room temperature followed by lithium-zinc exchange with<br><br>
anhydrous zinc halide in either diethylether or THF to give an organozinc reagent 10 that<br>
is used as in equation 3 above. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that<br>
commercially available organozinc reagents 10 can be used directly as an organozinc<br>
coupling partner.<br>
Furthermore from equation 5, it may be advantageous or convenient to use Reike<br>
Zn in THF to directly convert a 5-membered ring heterocyclic halide 9 to an organozinc<br>
reagent 10 for coupling with a halide 6.<br>
In equation 6, a 5 membered heterocyclic halide 9 can be directly coupled with die<br>
imidazo[l,2-b]pyridazine intermediate 5 in the presence of palladium, e.g., Pd2(dba)3,<br>
PdCU, Palladium acetate/TDBPP, or tetrakis-triphenylphosphine palladium (0) in DMF,<br>
THF, or NMP solvent from 70-120°C to give a compound of formula I.<br>
Alternately, from equation 7, the imidazo[l,2-b]pyridazine halide 6 may be<br>
directly coupled with a 5 membered heterocycle 11 in the presence of palladium, e.g.,<br>
Pd2(dba)3, PdCl2 or Palladium acetate/TDBPP in DMF, THF, or NMP solvent from 70-<br>
120 °C to give a compound of formula I.<br><br><br>
Several 5 membered heterocyclic rings and/or their bromides and/or iodides useful<br>
as starting materials for the synthesis of compounds of Formula I are commercially<br>
available or may be prepared by methods well know to the skilled artisan. From Scheme<br>
m, they may also be prepared by halogenation, e.g., with bromine, NBS or NIS,<br>
Furthermore, some of the intermediates 11 and 12 may be prepared by lithium halogen<br>
exchange followed by water quench.<br>
Compounds of Formula I as intermediates in the preparation of other compounds<br>
of Formula I include the addition of aryllithium reagents (generated by the methods of<br>
equations 3 and 4 in Scheme II) to carbonyl compounds, e.g., aldehydes, ketones, esters,<br>
and Weinreb amides. The resulting carbinols or carbonyl compounds are further<br>
elaborated by halogenation under acidic conditions and by a second aryllithium addition,<br>
respectively.<br>

Example A<br>
In Vivo Potency Assessment Using Ex Vivo Binding<br>
To assess in vivo potency, a compound of the present invention is evaluated using<br>
ex vivo binding. Using the procedures as provided in D. R. Gehlert et al., EJP 509:145-<br>
153 (2005), a compound is administered to a rat via the oral route. The binding of 125I-<br><br>
sauvagine to the cerebellum is then assessed ex vivo as described in Gehlert et al For<br>
example, Example 199 provides an ED50 result of 1.3 mg/kg.<br>
Example B<br>
CRF1 Filter Binding Assay<br>
The limitations of plasmid-based human CRF1 expression, in terms of generating<br>
a recombinant cell line with sufficient receptor density to develop a binding assay, arc<br>
overcome by using a Phoenix retroviral expression system licensed from Stanford. The<br>
stable HEK-hCRFl cell line is used to prepare membranes and binding reactions (200 ul)<br>
are set up as follows: 50 ul of 125I-sauvagine (0.2 nM final), 50 \i\ compound and 100 ul<br>
CRF1 membrane (25 u,g/reaction). The reactions are incubated at room temperature for 2<br>
hours and then terminated by filtration through pre-treated FB Millipore glass fiber filter<br>
plates (96 well). The plates are wash twice with ice-cold assay buffer (50 mM tris, 12.5<br>
mM NaCl, ImM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.2), air dried over night and<br>
counted with 100 uJ Microscint 40 in a MicroBeta counter. Non-specific binding (NSB)<br>
is determined in the presence of 0.5 uM non-labeled sauvagine. Triplicate determinations<br>
are typically run and the median data points plotted by Graph Pad Prism.<br>
Using this assay, the claimed exemplified compounds of the present invention<br>
inhibit the binding of 125I-Sauvagine (4 nM) in roller/adherent cells with a Ki (inhibition<br>
constant) below 1 uM. For example, Examples 102 and 199 exhibit a Ki of 4.92 ± 0.57<br>
nM and 9.98 ± 0.72 nM, respectively.<br>
Example C<br>
CRF2 Filter Binding Assay<br>
The limitations of plasmid-based human CRF2 expression, in terms of generating<br>
a recombinant cell line with sufficient receptor density to develop a binding assay, are<br>
overcome by using a Phoenix retroviral expression system licensed from Stanford. The<br>
stable HEK-hCRF2 cell line is used to prepare membranes and binding reactions (200 ul)<br>
are set up as follows: 50 ul of 125I-sauvagine (0.2 nM final concentration), 50 ul<br>
compound and 100 ul CRF2 membrane (25 ug/reaction). The reactions are incubated at<br>
room temperature for 2 hours and then terminated by filtration through pre-treated FB<br>
Millipore glass fiber filter plates (96 well). The plates are washed twice with ice-cold<br><br>
assay buffer (50 mM tris, 12.5 mM NaCl, ImM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05% BSA, pH<br>
7.2), air dried over night and counted with 100 ul Microscint 40 in a MicroBeta counter.<br>
Non-specific binding (NSB) is determined in the presence of 0.5 uM non-labeled<br>
sauvagine. Alternatively, compounds are evaluated using a Scintillation Proximity assay.<br>
This assay is set up as follows: 50ul of 125I-Sauvagine (0.2 nM final concentration), 50 jxl<br>
compound or non-labelled sauvagine (NSB) and 100 ul containing 250 jig wheat germ<br>
agglutinin (WGA) SPA beads and CRF2 membrane (1.5 u.g/reaction). Plates are<br>
incubated for 4-5 hours at room temperature and then centrifuged at 200 X g for 10<br>
minutes. Bound radioactivity is assessed using a Wallac Trilux scintillation counter.<br>
Binding is assessed typically using triplicate determinations and the median data points<br>
plotted by Graph Pad Prism. Compounds are initially screened at a fixed concentration<br>
and, if sufficient activity is noted, subsequent concentration-response curves are<br>
generated.<br>
Compounds of the present invention are tested in the CRF2 binding assay and<br>
exhibit weak affinity for the CRF2 receptor. For example, Examples 102 and 199 exhibit<br>
a percent inhibition at 50 uM of 9.0 ± 2.6 and 16.9 ± 1.9, respectively. These results<br>
suggest that the compounds of the present invention are highly selective for the CRF1<br>
receptor.<br>
Example D<br>
Bioavailability and Pharmacokinetic Properties<br>
The "compounds of Formula I are antagonists of CRF1, arid possess surprisingly<br>
useful properties related to their pharmacokinetics and bioavailability.<br>
The volume of distribution (Vdist) relates the amount of the drug in the body to<br>
the concentration of the drug in the blood or plasma. The volume of distribution refers to<br>
the fluid volume that would be required to contain the total amount of the drug in the<br>
body at the same concentration as in the blood or plasma: Vdist = amount of drug in the<br>
body/ concentration of drug in blood or plasma (Goodman and Gillman's). For a 10 mg<br>
dose and a plasma concentration of 10 mg/L, the volume of distribution would be 1 liter.<br>
The volume of distribution reflects the extent to which the drug is present in the<br>
extravascular tissue. A large volume of distribution reflects the tendency of a compound<br>
to bind to the tissue components compared with plasma protein binding. In a clinical<br><br>
setting, Vdist can be used to determine a loading dose achieve a steady state<br>
concentration.<br>
To test for volume of distribution, Male Sprague Dawley rats (N=3) are<br>
administered a single 3 mg/kg intravenous dose of compound. Multiple plasma samples<br>
are collected at time points from 0.08 to 24 hours post-dose. The plasma samples are<br>
analyzed by LC/MS/MS to determine the plasma concentrations. Plasma pharmacokinetic<br>
calculations are performed to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters including Vdist<br>
and plasma clearance (Clp).<br>
An overwhelming majority of commercial CNS and cardiovascular drugs exhibit a<br>
human Vdist of 
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 93:10477 (1996)) and NBD0775 (Chen et al., Drug<br>
Development Research, 65:216 (2005)) which exhibit a rat Vdist of 114 L/Kg and 76<br>
L/Kg, respectively, following a single intravenous dose, thiazole Examples 48 and 199 of<br>
the present invention exhibits a rat Vdist of only 9 and 2 L/Kg, respectively.<br>
Furthermore, thiophene Examples 88 and 39 of the present invention exhibit a rat Vdist of<br>
only 44 and 17 L/kg, respectively.<br><br>
