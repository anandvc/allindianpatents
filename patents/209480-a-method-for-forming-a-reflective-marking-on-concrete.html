COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 ; rule 13]]<br>
"A method for forming a reflective marking on concrete"<br>
MICHAEL LAZAR, a Singapore citizen, of Block 214 Marsiling Lane, #24-806, 730214 Singapore.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for marking concrete and other surfaces, 5      and to compositions for use in the method.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In this specification, where a document, act or item of knowledge is referred to or discussed, this reference or discussion is not an admission that the document, act or item of knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority date:<br>
10	(i)	part of common general knowledge; or<br>
(ii)        known to be relevant to an attempt to solve any problem with which this specification is concerned.<br>
Thermoplastic markings are satisfactory for the bituminous surfaces for which they were designed. Such markings have quick drying times, which can be critical for the efficient 15      movement of traffic as it leads to minimum disruption to road access.<br>
Over the years, concrete pavement has started to be used instead ot bituminous surfaces. Thermoplastic or paint markings were applied as required on the concrete surfaces in a similar manner to their use on bituminous surfaces. However, such markings were formulated for bituminous surfaces and have not performed well on concrete surfaces.<br>
20	Further, maintaining these markings is difficult, and is becoming more and more<br>
expensive, since the markings have to be repainted frequently to maintain their effectiveness. In general, repainting needs to occur every six to eighteen months depending on the usage and site condition.<br>
The main problems associated with paint or thermoplastic markings on concrete 25      surfaces maybe summarized as follows:<br>
1.	Poor adhesion;<br>
2.	Chaffing;<br>
3.	Rapid wear;<br>
4.	Poor skid resistance;<br>
30	5.	Re-application on the markings causes unevenness and weakens the adhesion;<br>
- 2-<br><br><br>
6.	Frequent re-application required to maintain the markings;<br>
7.	Increased maintenance cost;<br>
8.	Emits toxic vapors during preparation for application;<br>
9.	Breathing apparatus must be worn by applicators; and<br>
5	10.	Pollutes the environment.<br>
Since the cost of maintenance has been increasing, the authorities concerned with such markings are constantly looking for new methods or markings that address some of these issues.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>

In one particularly preferred embodiment the binder comprises a mixture of cement and sand which is combined with the pigment and the reflective material to form a pre-mix material. The pre-mix is then blended with a polymer material to form the marking 10      composition according to the invention.<br>
Other binder materials and mixtures are envisaged within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The binder may be present in the composition in any suitable amount. When present, the cement is typically present in amounts of up to about 50% by weight, and more preferably 15      up to about 40% by weight. When present the sand is typically present in amounts up to about 20% by weight, and more preferably up to about 16% by weight. When present, the polymer material is typically present in amounts up to about 30% by weight, and more preferably up to about 20% by weight.<br>
The pigment may take any suitable form. The pigment is typically selected to match 20      internationally accepted road marking colourings, namely white or yellow. A suitable pigment is titanium dioxide. That material has the advantage that it also has reflective characteristics. Other pigments are envisaged within the scope of the present invention.<br>

The primer preferably has adhesive characteristics, and maybe a material such as a paint or a flowable adhesive. This is intended to render the surface sufficiently adhesive to enable the marking composition to adhere to the surface. The marking composition is applied to the coated surface before the coating has dried. A stencil laid onto the road surface is typically 10      used to delineate the area to be marked.<br>
Preferably the thickness of the marking composition applied to the surface is at least about 2mm, and more preferably at least about 3mm. The thickness will generally not exceed about 8mm, and more preferably will not exceed about 5mm.<br>
The cqating of the marking composition following its application to the surface to be 15      marked may take any suitable form. The coating will typically be for the purpose of providing a seal for the composition. The coating preferably has adhesive properties, and maybe in the form of a paint or a flowable adhesive. A layer of reflective material, such as glass beads or crushed glass, may be applied to the coating to provide the marked surface with the required reflectivity.<br>

20	(e)        coating the marked surface witli a top coat; and<br>
(f)        applying a layer of glass beads to provide tne required reflectivity.<br>
Step (f) above may occur before step (e).<br>
Compositions according to the invention can be used to cast the required demarcation lines and directional signs to pro-long the life-span and reduce the maintenance cost of such 25      markings.<br>
7<br><br>
The present invention provides in another particularly preferred embodiment a method for marking concrete and other surfaces comprising:<br>
(a)        coating the concrete or other surface to be marked with a primer by use of a pressure activated spray,<br>
5	(b)        applying to the surface to be marked a marking composition comprising a<br>

One or both of the coating steps (a) and (c) above maybe performed by the use of a paint roller.<br>
Step (d) above may occur before step (c).<br>
15	Investigations indicate that one or more of the following properties may be exhibited<br>
in some formulations of the marking composition according to the invention.<br>
1.	It is easy to apply;<br>
The marking composition can be directly applied or sprayed onto any type of<br>
surfaces i.e. concrete, bituminous, pavers, tiles, bricks etc by similar methods<br>
20	to those used to apply existing thermoplastic paint markings.<br>
2.	Its skid resistance is superior to that of thermoplastic or paint markings and allows the reflective markings to comply with various government standards;<br>
3.	It has good adhesion to concrete surfaces;<br>
4.	It has a longer life-span, that is, it is more wear-resistant than existing<br>
25	markings;<br>
The reflective markings may last up to 4 times longer than that of known markings. Generally the expected life span of the markings according to the invention is approximately 5 years.<br>
5.	There are minimal maintenance requirements. It only requires washing off any<br>
30                              surface dirt to retain its effectiveness;<br>
8<br><br>
6.	It is more cost effective than existing marking compositions and methods since the need to apply fresh markings to the surface should be less frequent; and<br>
7.	It is considered to be environmentally friendly.<br>
5	In comparison known thermoplastic mix markings commonly used emit toxic<br>
vapors during heating and are hazardous to health and to the environment.<br>
8.	Quick drying<br>
The initial setting of the composition will be within 5 minutes and the full cure<br>
will be approximately 30 to 45 minutes. The area could be trafficked within an<br>
10	hour of application.<br>
In particular investigations indicate that some formulations of the composition according to the invention provide a permanent marking which may be readily cleaned to maintain its effectiveness in comparison to other type of markings currently used for similar applications.<br>
15	The composition not only remains effective but also has "self cleansing" properties.<br>
Due to the durability of the markings, prolonged use would expose the markings to all types of stains during trafficking. In order to remain effective and visible, some form of cleaning material may be required to remove dirt. Stains deposited on the markings can be washed away during a downpour. More stubborn stains may be easily scrubbed off. The durable<br>
20     nature of the markings allows it to withstand scrubbing.<br>
Authorities concerned with the safety and maintenance of such markings are constantly placing greater emphasis on the quality and visibility of the markings. This composition for marking concrete and other surfaces provides an alternative, cost effective solution to minimize the problems associated with the markings currently applied.<br>
25      Examples<br>
The invention will now be further illustrated and explained in the following non-limiting example.<br>
Concrete surfaces were marked using the following components:<br>
1.	One part of white cement;<br>
30      2.	One part of pigment such as titanium dioxide grade A or yellow PP920;<br>
9<br><br>
3.	One part of fine washed silica sand;<br>
4.	One part of fine glass beads grade A;<br>
5.	One part of organic polymer grade SS50;<br>
6.	One part of primer grade 780;<br>
5      7.	One part of top coat grade 788; and<br>
8.	Drop on glass beads.<br>
The cement, pigment, sand and glass beads are mixed together and prepacked in 25 kg double ply bags.<br>
One bag of this mixture is to be emptied into a mixer mounted onto a marking 10      machine and combined with one liter of the organic polymer. The materials are then mixed together for at least two minutes and then discharged into a chute in the machine for application.<br>
The surface area is coated with the primer using an RMM 100 machine designed for spraying or coating the surface with an attached roller as required depending on the site or 15      road condition.<br>
The cement mixture is then discharged from the machine through a stencil placed for the required road markings. The markings will have a thickness of not less than 3 mm and not exceeding 5 mm.<br>
A top coat grade 788 is then sprayed onto the markings by an air-operated RM 101 20      machine, followed by the application of drop-on glass beads by gravity for the required reflectorisation.<br>
The drop-on beads are discharged onto the markings by an RM103 machine. The required index of retro-reflectivity could be obtained by adjusting and controlling the discharge of the glass beads onto the markings.<br>
25	A marking formed by this method is thought to comply with the following adopted<br>
standards:<br>
1.	ASTMD4541	Adhesion to substrate<br>
2.	ASTME303	Skid resistance test<br>
3.	BS 3262 : Part 1:1981:	Skid resistance test<br>
10<br><br>
4.	BS 3900 : Part C: 1971	Hard drying time<br>
5.	BS 6044 : 1987	Determination of luminance factor<br>
6.	ASTMD4061	Determination of retroreflectance<br>
Investigations further indicate that some formulations of the composition according to the invention is that it may be suitable and durable for the following applications due to its improved durability and enhancement of safety in most weather conditions:<br>
1.	Concrete surfaces (may last approximately 5 times longer in comparison to some known markings)<br>
2.	Bituminous surfaces (may last approximately 3 times longer in comparison to some known markings)<br>
