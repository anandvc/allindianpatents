The stereoisomers as a rule are generally obtained as racemates that can be separated into the optically active isomers in a manner known per se. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) having an asymmetric carbon atom the present invention relates to the R-isomer, S-isomer and R,S- mixtures and in the case of a number of asymmetric carbon atoms, the diastereomeric forms and the invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. Those compounds of general formula (I) which have an asymmetric carbon and as a rule are obtained as racemates can be separated one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. However, it is also possible to employ an optically active compound from the start, a correspondingly optically active or diastereomeric compound then being obtained as the final compound.<br>
The stereoisomers of compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by one or more ways presented below:<br>
i)	One or more of the reagents may be used in their optically active form,<br>
ii) Optically pure catalyst or chiral ligands along with metal catalyst may be employed in the reduction process. The metal catalysts may be employed in the reduction process. The metal catalyst may be Rhodium, Ruthenium, Indium and the like. The chiral ligands may preferably be chiral phosphines (Principles of Asymmetric synthesis, J. E. Baldwin Ed., Tetrahedron series, 14, 311-316). iii) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as forming diastereomeric salts with chiral acids or chiral amines, or chiral amino alcohols, chiral amino acids. The resulting mixture of diastereomers may then be separated by methods such as fractional crystallization, chromatography and the like, which is followed by an additional step of isolating the optically active product by hydrolyzing or neutralizing the derivative (Jacques et. al., "Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolution", Wiley<br><br>
Interscience, 1981). Chiral acids that can be employed may be tartaric acid,<br>
mandelic acid, lactic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, amino acids and the like.<br>
Chiral bases that can be employed may be cinchona alkaloids, brucine or a<br>
compound containing basic amino group such as lysine, arginine and the like, iv)        The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such<br>
as microbial resolution, resolving the diastereomeric salts formed with chira!<br>
acids or chiral bases.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of the formula (I) can be prepared. The non-toxic acid addition salts include those having pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as the chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, acetate, lactate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, bitartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, gluconate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benezenesulfonate, p-tolunesulfonate, palmoate and oxalate. Pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts forming part of this invention are intended to define but not limited to the above list.<br>
In addition, pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts of the compound of general formula (I) can be obtained by converting derivatives which have tertiary amino groups into the corresponding quarternary ammonium salts in the methods known in the literature by using quarternizing agents. Possible quarternizing agents are, for example, alkyl halides such as methyl iodide, ethyl bromide and n-propyl chloride, including arylalkyl halides such as benzyl chloride or 2-phenylethyl bromide.<br>
The pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts forming a part of this invention may be prepared by treating the compound of formula (I) with 1-6 equivalents of a acid mentioned as above in solvents such as water, alcohols, ethers, ethyl acetate, dioxane, DMF or a lower alkyl ketone such as acetone, or the mixtures thereof.<br>
Further the exceptional salts may be formed as intermediates during purification, preparation of other salts, or identification and characterization of compounds of formula (I) or intermediates involved in preparing compounds of formula<br>
(I).<br>
The pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts of compounds of formula (I) may exist<br>
as solvates, such as with water, methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide, ethyl acetate,<br>
and the like. The source of such solvate can be from the solvent of crystallization,<br>
inherent in the solvent preparation or crystallization, or adventitious to such solvent.<br>
There may be need to prepare radio-labelled compounds related to general<br>
structure (I). Suitable isotopes which can be prepared by incorporating isotopes of<br>
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine, chlorine, iodine, bromine<br>
and mTecnitium, exemplified by 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, 1sO, 18F, ""Tc, 31P, S,<br><br>
123l and 125l. These compounds containing the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Isotopically labelled compounds of the present invention are popular in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution and target occupancy assays. For example, isotopically labelled compounds are particularly useful in SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) and in PET (positron emission tomography)<br>
Another aspect of the present invention comprises of a pharmaceutical composition, containing at least one of the compounds of general formula (I) as defined earlier, either in pure or impure forms forming an active ingredient, together with pharmaceutical^ employed carriers, auxiliaries and the like.<br>
An effective amount of a compound of general formula (I), or their derivatives as defined above can be used to produce a medicament, along with conventional pharmaceutical auxiliaries, carriers and additives. "Therapeutically effective amount" is defined as 'an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition, or disorder, (ii) attenuates, ameliorates, or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein'.<br>
Such therapy includes multiple choices: for example, administering two compatible compounds simultaneously in a single dose form or administering each compound individually in a separate dosage; or if required at same time interval or separately in order to maximize the beneficial effect or minimize the potential side-effects of the drugs according to the known principles of pharmacology.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, and/or the mammal being treated therewith.<br>
The terms "treating", "treat", or "treatment" embrace all the meanings such as preventative, prophylactic and palliative.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Thus, the active compounds of the invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, intranasal, parental (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous) or rectal administration or a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions as well as the formulated medicaments prepared according to the present invention may in addition to at least one compound of formula formula (I), optionally in form of one of its stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, its racemate or in form of a mixture of at least two of its<br><br>
stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, in any mixing ratio, or a corresponding physiologically acceptable salt or a corresponding solvate, comprise further conventional auxiliary substances known to those skilled in the art, such as carriers, fillers, solvents, diluents, colouring agents, coating agents, matrix agents and/or binders. As is also known to those skilled in the art, the choice of the auxiliary substances and the amounts thereof to be used are dependent on the intended route of administration, e.g. oral, rectal, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intranasal, buccal or topical route.<br>
The dose of the active compounds can vary depending on factors such as the route of administration, age and weight of patient, nature and severity of the disease to be treated and similar factors. Therefore, any reference herein to a pharmacologically effective amount of the compounds of general (I) refers to the aforementioned factors. A proposed dose of the active compounds of this invention, for either oral, parenteral, nasal or buccal administration, to an average adult human, for the treatment of the conditions referred to above, is 0.1 to 200 mg of the active ingredient per unit dose which could be administered, for example, 1 to 4 times per day.<br>
Medicaments suitable for parenteral, topical or inhalatory administration may preferably be selected from the group consisting of solutions, suspensions, readily reconstitutable dry preparations and also sprays.<br>
Suitable medicaments, e.g. medicaments for oral or percutaneous use may release the sulphonamide compounds of general formula (1) in a delayed manner, whereby the preparation of these delayed release medicaments is generally known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Medicaments suitable for oral administration are for example, tablets, sugar-coated pills, capsules or multiparticulates, such as granules or pellets, optionally compressed into tablets, filled into capsules or suspended in a suitable liquid, solutions or suspensions. Such the pharmaceutical compositions may have excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutical^ acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose or hydrogenated edible fats);<br><br>
emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid).<br>
For buccal administration, the composition may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.<br>
The active compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, including using conventional catheterization techniques or infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulating agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The active compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
For intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the active compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pressurized container or a nebulizer, or from a capsule using a inhaler or insufflator. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas and the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The medicament for pressurized container or nebulizer may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound while for a capsule it preferably should be in the form of powder. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
Aerosol formulations for treatment of the conditions referred to above (e.g., migraine) in the average adult human are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or "puff* of aerosol contains 20 ^g to 1000 \ig of the compound of the invention. The overall daily dose with an aerosol will be within the range 100 |^g to 10 mg. Administration may be several times daily, for example 2, 3, 4 or 8 times, giving for example, 1, 2 or 3 doses each time.<br><br>

Example -15 :	FOOD INTAKE MEASUREMENT<br>
Male Wistar rats (100-270 g) obtained from (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) are used. The animals are acclimatized to the animal facility for at least 7 days before they are subjected to any treatment. During this period the animals are housed (in groups of three) in translucid cages and provided with food and water ad libitum. At least 24 hours before the treatment starts, the animals are adapted to single-housing conditions.<br>
The chronic effect of the compounds of general formula (I) on food intake in well-fed rats is then determined as follows. The rats were housed in their single homecages for 28 days. After this period, the rats are orally dosed with a composition comprising a compound of formula (1) or a corresponding composition (vehicle) without said compound, once-a-day. The rat is provided with ad libitum food and water. On 0, 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th day the rat is left with preweighed food. Food intake and weight gain is measured.<br><br><br>
The ingredients are combined and granulated using a suitable solvent such as ethanol. The formulation is then dried and formed into tablets (containing about 20 mg of active compound) with an appropriate tablet machine.<br><br>
The ingredients are mixed and dispensed into capsules containing about 100 mg each; one capsule would approximate a total daily dosage.<br><br><br>
The active ingredient is dissolved in a portion of the water for injection. A sufficient quantity of sodium chloride is then added with stirring to make the solution isotonic. The solution is made up to weight with the remainder of the water for injection, filtered through a 0.2 micron membrane filter and packaged under sterile conditions.<br><br>
The ingredients are melted together and mixed on a steam bath, and poured into molds containing 2.5 g total weight<br><br>
All of the ingredients, except water, are combined and heated to about 60° C. with stirring. A sufficient quantity of water at about 60° C. is then added with vigorous stirring to emulsify the ingredients, and water then added q.s. about 100 g.<br>
Example - 22 :	Binding assay for human 5HT6 receptor<br>
