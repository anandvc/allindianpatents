				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions and methods of preparing and storing<br>
AAV virions that prevent aggregation.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is a promising vector for human gene<br>
transfer. Grimm, D., and Kleinschmidt, J. A. (1999) Hum Gene Ther. 10: 2445-2450; High,<br>
K. A. (2001) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 953: 64-67; Pfeifer, A., and Verma, I. M. (2001) Ann. Rev.<br>
Genomics Hum. Genet. 2: 177-211. AAV is a member of the Dependovirus genus of the<br>
parvoviruses. AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) is composed of a single-strand DNA molecule of<br>
4680 nucleotides encoding replication {rep) and encapsidation (cap) genes flanked by<br>
inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences. Berns, K. I. (1996) in Fields Virology (B. N.<br>
Fields et. al. Eds.), pp. 2173-2197. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia. The genome<br>
is packaged by three capsid proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3), which are amino-terminal variants<br>
of the cap gene product. The resulting icosahedral virus particle has a diameter of ~26 nm.<br>
A high resolution crystal structure of AAV2 has been reported. Xie, Q. et al. (2002) Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99: 10405-10410.<br>
The solubility of purified AAV2 virus particles is limited, and aggregation of AAV2<br>
particles has been described as a problem. Croyle, M. A. et al. (2001) Gene Therapy 8: 1281-<br>
1290; Huang, J. et al. (2000) Mol. Therapy 1: S286; Wright, J. F. et al. (2003) Curr. Opin.<br>
Drug Disc. Dev. 6: 174-178; Xie, Q. et al. (2004) J. Virol. Methods 122: 17-27. In<br>
commonly used buffered-saline solutions, significant aggregation occurs at concentrations of<br><br>
1013 particles/mL, and aggregation increases at higher concentrations. Huang and co-workers<br>
reported that AAV vectors undergo concentration-dependent aggregation. Huang, J. et al.<br>
(2000) Mol. Therapy 1: S286. Xie and coworkers (Xie, Q. et al. (2004) J. Virol. Methods<br>
122: 17-27) similarly reported that at concentrations exceeding 0.1mg/mL, AAV2 vectors<br>
require elevated concentrations of salt to prevent aggregation. Aggregation of AAV2 vectors<br>
occurs at particle concentrations exceeding 1013 particles/mL in commonly used neutral-<br>
buffered solutions such as phosphate- and Tris-buffered saline. This corresponds to a protein<br>
concentration of~0.06 mg/mL, and emphasizes the low solubility of AAV2 under these<br>
conditions. The effective vector concentration limit may be even lower for vectors purified<br>
using column chromatography techniques because excess empty capsids are co-purified and<br>
contribute to particle concentration.<br>
Particle aggregation is a significant and not fully resolved issue for adenovirus vectors<br>
as well. Stability of a recently established adenovirus reference material (ARM) was recently<br>
reported. Adadevoh, K. et al. (2002) BioProcessing 1(2): 62-69. Aggregation of the<br>
reference material, formulated in 20mM Tris, 25 mM NaCl, and 2.5% glycerol at pH 8.0, was<br>
assessed by dynamic light scattering, photon correlation spectroscopy and visual appearance.<br>
A variable level of vector aggregation following either freeze-thaw cycling or non-frozen<br>
storage was observed, resulting in restrictive protocols for the use of the ARM.<br>
Aggregation can lead to losses during purification and inconsistencies in testing of<br>
purified vector preparations. The in vivo administration of AAV2 vectors to certain sites,<br>
such as the central nervous system, may require small volumes of highly concentrated vector,<br>
and the maximum achievable dose may be limited by low vector solubility.<br>
Vector aggregation is also likely to influence biodistribution following in vivo<br>
administration, and cause adverse immune responses to vectors following their<br>
administration. As has been reported for proteins (Braun, A. et al. (1997) Pharm. Res. 14:<br><br>
1472-1478), aggregation of vector may increase immunogenicity by targeting the vector to<br>
antigen presenting cells, and inducing enhanced immune responses to the capsid proteins and<br>
transgene product. The reports of immune responses to AAV vectors in pre-clinical<br>
(Chenuaud, P. et al. (2004) Blood 103: 3303-3304; Flotte, T. R. (2004) Human Gene Ther.<br>
15: 716-717; Gao, G. et al. (2004) Blood 103: 3300-3302) and clinical (High, K. A. et al.<br>
(2004) Blood 104: 121a) studies illustrate the need to address all factors that may contribute<br>
to vector immunogenicity.<br>
Testing protocols to characterize purified vectors are also likely to be affected by<br>
vector aggregation. Determination of the infectivity titer of vector was reported to be highly<br>
sensitive to vector aggregation. Zhen, Z. et al. (2004) Human Gene Ther. 15: 709-715. An<br>
important concern is that vector aggregates may have deleterious consequences following<br>
their in vivo administration because their transduction efficiency, biodistribution and<br>
immunogenicity may differ from monomelic particles. For example, intravascular delivery<br>
of AAV vectors to hepatocytes requires that the vectors pass through the fenestrated<br>
endothelial cell lining of hepatic sinusoids. These fenestrations have a radius ranging from<br>
50 to 150 nm (Meijer, K. D. F., and Molema, G. (1995) Sent. Liver Dis. 15: 206) that is<br>
predicted to allow the passage of monomelic AAV vectors (diameter ~26 nm), but prevent<br>
the passage of larger vector aggregates. In biodistribution studies in mice, aggregated AAV2<br>
vectors labeled with the fluorescent molecule Cy3 were sequestered in liver macrophages<br>
following vascular delivery. Huang, J. et al. (2000) Mol. Therapy 1: S286.<br>
Formulation development for virus-based gene transfer vectors is a relatively recent<br>
area of investigation, and only a few studies have been reported describing systematic efforts<br>
to optimize AAV vector formulation and stability. Croyle, M. A. et al. (2001) Gene Therapy<br>
8: 1281-1290; Wright, J. F. et al. (2003) Curr. Opin. Drug Disc. Dev. 6: 174-178; Xie, Q. et<br>
al. (2004)J. Virol. Methods 122: 17-27. Defining formulations compatible with pre-clinical<br><br>
and clinical applications that minimize changes in vector preparations is an important<br>
requirement to achieve consistently high vector safety and functional characteristics. As is<br>
well established for protein therapeutics (Chen, B. et al. (1994) J. Pharm. Sci. 83: 1657-1661;<br>
Shire, S. J. et al. (2004) J. Pharm. Sci. 93:1390-1402; Wang, W. (1999) Int. J. Pharm. 185:<br>
129-188; Won, C. M. et al. (1998) Int. J. Pharm. 167: 25-36), an important aspect of vector -<br>
stability is solubility during preparation and storage, and vector aggregation is a problem that<br>
needs to be fully addressed. Vector aggregation leads to losses during vector purification,<br>
and while aggregates can be removed by filtration, the loss in yield results in higher costs and<br>
capacity limitations when producing vector for pre-clinical and clinical studies. Even after<br>
filtration to remove aggregates, new aggregates can form in concentrated preparations of<br>
AAV2 vector in buffered-saline solutions.<br>
The need exists for improved formulations and methods for purification and storage<br>
of AAV vectors, such as rAAV2, that prevent aggregation of virus particles.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
These and other needs in the art are met by the present invention, which provides high<br>
ionic strength solutions for use in preparing and storing AAV vectors that maintain high<br>
infectivity titer and transduction efficiency, even after freeze-thaw cycles.<br>
In one aspect the invention relates to methods of preventing aggregation of virions in<br>
a preparation of virions by adding excipients to achieve an ionic strength high enough to<br>
prevent aggregation. In another aspect the invention relates to compositions of virions having<br>
an ionic strength high enough to prevent aggregation.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the ionic strength is at least about 150mM,<br>
200mM, 250mM, 300mM, 350mM, 400mM, 450mM, 500mM, 600mM, 700mM or more. In<br><br>
some embodiments this ionic strength is accomplished using excipients comprising one or<br>
more multivalent ions, for example citrate, sulfate, magnesium or phosphate.<br>
In additional embodiments, the osmolality of the preparation of virions is maintained<br>
at near isotonic levels, for example 200mOsm, 250mOsm, 280mOsm, 300mOsm, 350mOsm<br>
or 400mOsm, even though the ionic strength is high enough to prevent virion aggregation.<br>
In some embodiments the virions are adeno-associated virus (AAV) virions, for<br>
example AAV-2.<br>
In other embodiments of the methods of the present invention preparations of virions<br>
are treated with a nuclease, for example Benzonase®. In further embodiments, nuclease<br>
treatment is combined with addition of excipients that achieve an ionic strength high enough<br>
to prevent aggregation.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, the surfactant Pluronic® F68 is added<br>
to a preparation of virions, for example to 0.001%. In one embodiment, the composition<br>
comprises purified virus particles, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100mM sodium citrate and 0.001%<br>
Pluronic® F68.<br>
In one embodiment, AAV vectors can be stored as compositions of the present<br>
invention at concentrations exceeding 1x1013 vg/mL, for example 2x1013, 3x1013, 4x1013,<br>
5x1013 and up to 6.4x1013 vg/mL, without significant aggregation. In some embodiments,<br>
AAV vectors stored using the methods and compositions of the invention do not exhibit<br>
significant aggregation when stored at 4°C for five days. In other embodiments, AAV<br>
vectors that are stored as such compositions do not exhibit significant aggregation after,one,<br>
five, ten or more freeze-thaw cycles at -20°C or at -80°C.<br>
In some embodiments, preparations of virions stored according to the methods and<br>
compositions of the invention exhibit an average particle radius (Rh), as measured by<br>
dynamic light scattering, indicating that no significant aggregation of virions has taken place.<br><br>
In some embodiments, preparations of virions stored according to the methods and<br>
compositions of the invention exhibit an average particle radius (Rh) greater than about<br>
15nm, 20nm, or 30nm.<br>
In some embodiments, recovery of virions from preparations of virions stored<br>
according to the methods and compositions of the invention is greater than about 85%, 90%<br>
or 95% following filtration through a 0.22µm filter.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention relates to kits comprising the high ionic strength<br>
formulations of the invention. In one embodiment the kit comprises a pre-mixed solution of<br>
excipients. In another embodiment the kit comprises two or more separate components of a<br>
high ionic strength composition of the present invention to be mixed by a user. In some<br>
embodiments the kit comprises sodium citrate, Tris® and Pluronic® F68. In other<br>
embodiments, the kit further comprises instructions for making a composition or performing<br>
a method of the present invention.<br><br>

for each data point) 72 hours post-transduction. Error bars represent standard deviations.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
AAV2 vector aggregation is frequently observed in concentrated preparations of<br>
vectors and can affect purification recovery, and in vivo potency and safety. Hence, an<br>
important objective for the development-AAV2 vectors is to identify methods and<br>
formulations that prevent aggregation of vectors when concentrated stocks are prepared.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, the term "vector" as used herein refers to a recombinant<br>
AAV virion, or virus particle, regardless of the frequent use of "vector" to also refer to non-<br>
viral DNA molecules, such as plasmids, in other contexts.<br>
The present invention is based in part on the observation that solution ionic strength is<br>
an important parameter in AAV vector aggregation, implicating the involvement of ionic<br>
interactions between virus particles in the aggregation process. The observation that elevated<br>
ionic strength increases AAV2 vector solubility regardless of the identity of the charged<br>
excipient supports the hypothesis that ionic strength of solution per se, rather than<br>
interactions involving a specific ionic species, is the relevant physico-chemical parameter. A<br>
threshold ionic strength of at least 200mM is required to prevent aggregation at vector<br>
particle concentrations examined herein.<br><br>
Of practical concern, commonly used buffered saline solutions have insufficient ionic<br>
strength to prevent AAV2 vector aggregation at concentrations exceeding 1013 particles/mL.<br>
It is known that high salt concentrations increase AAV2 vector solubility (e.g. highly<br>
concentrated AAV2 vectors recovered from gradients generally remain soluble in<br>
concentrated CsCl). However, optimal formulations for pre-clinical and clinical studies<br>
should be close to isotonic (280-400 mOsm), especially for in vivo administration of vector to<br>
sites where dilution of hypertonic solutions may be slow. In embodiments of the present<br>
invention the exponential relationship of ionic strength with charge valency is used to<br>
develop isotonic formulations with high ionic strengths. Salt species with multiple charge<br>
valencies (e.g. salts of sulfate, citrate, and phosphate) that are commonly used as excipients in<br>
human parenteral formulations can provide the level of ionic strength needed to prevent<br>
AAV2 vector aggregation when used at isotonic concentrations. While isotonic (150mM)<br>
sodium chloride has an ionic strength of 150mM, a value insufficient to maintain AAV2<br>
solubility at high vector concentrations, isotonic sodium citrate, with an ionic strength of<br>
~500mM, can support AAV2 vector concentrations of at least 6.4 x 1013 vg/mL without<br>
aggregation.<br>
Without intending to be limited by theory, the low solubility of AAV2 particles may<br>
be caused by their highly symmetrical nature in conjunction with the stabilizing effect of<br>
complementary charged regions between neighbouring particles in aggregates. The surface<br>
charge density based on the crystal structure of AAV2 (Xie, Q. et al. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. U.S.A. 99: 10405-10410) reveals a pattern of positive and negative charges on the virus<br>
surface. Previous reports have shown that AAV2 vector aggregation is pH dependent, and<br>
hypothesized that amino acids with charged side groups are involved in inter-particle binding.<br>
Qu, G. et al. (2003) Mol. Therapy 7: S238. These reports hypothesized that if charged amino<br>
acid side chains are involved in vector aggregation, high concentrations of free amino acids<br><br>
could block vector particle interactions. However, we have found that amino acids with<br>
charged side chains are not effective in preventing AAV2 vector aggregation beyond their<br>
contribution to ionic strength.<br>
Vector aggregation at low ionic strength was also found to be reduced but not<br>
prevented by efficient nuclease treatment of purified vector particles. Digestion at an earlier<br>
stage of the purification process (clarified HEK cell lysate) did not reduce aggregation<br>
following vector purification. It is likely that digestion of already purified virions is more<br>
efficient because of a higher enzyme to nucleic acid substrate ratio. One mechanism to<br>
explain these results is that residual nucleic acid impurities (e.g. host cell and plasmid DNA)<br>
bound to the vector surface can bridge to binding sites on neighbouring virus particles and<br>
thus cause aggregation. Purified AAV2 vectors (empty capsid free) have been reported to<br>
contain approximately 1% non-vector DNA. Smith, P. et al. (2003) Mo/. Therapy 7: S348.<br>
While &gt;50% of this non-vector DNA was reported to be nuclease resistant and was packaged<br>
within capsid particles, some impurity DNA was nuclease resistant and appeared to be<br>
associated with the surface of purified vector particles. The observation that efficient<br>
nuclease treatment can reduce vector aggregation suggests that nucleic acids associated with<br>
the vector surface at an average level not greater than ~25 nucleotides per vector particle can<br>
contribute to AAV vector aggregation.<br>
In summary, the use of high ionic strength solutions during AAV2 vector purification<br>
and final formulation, and efficient removal of residual vector surface DNA are two effective<br>
strategies to achieve highly concentrated solutions of AAV2 vectors for use in pre-clinical<br>
and clinical studies. High ionic strength solutions and nuclease treatment can be used in<br>
combination or separately. Although data were obtained using AAV2 vectors, the<br>
composition and methods of the present invention may also be useful with other AAV<br>
serotypes / variants, or other viral vectors such as adenoviruses, lentiviruses and retroviruses.<br><br><br>
AA V Aggregation as a Function of Excipient Concentration<br>
Initial screening experiments are performed to elucidate the mechanism of AAV<br>
vector aggregation and to identify classes of excipients that can reduce / prevent aggregation.<br>
Vector aggregation can be caused by dilution (5-fold) of vector in neutral-buffered saline<br>
with low concentration buffer (20mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2). Excipients are screened<br>
using this "dilution-stress" method to identify excipients that are able to prevent vector<br>
aggregation when included in the diluent. For screening, aggregation is measured by<br>
dynamic light scattering (DLS). Classes of excipients examined included selected inorganic<br>
salts, amino acids, uncharged carbohydrates, and surfactants. Results are presented in<br>
Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
As illustrated in Table 1, charged excipients (inorganic salts and amino acids) prevent<br>
aggregation when present at sufficient concentrations. However, salt concentrations required<br>
to prevent vector aggregation vary, ranging from 180 mOsrn for magnesium sulfate, to 320<br>
mOsm for sodium chloride. The amino acids arginine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine,<br>
histidine, and lysine do not prevent aggregation at 200 mOsm, but lysine, aspartic acid, and<br>
glutamic acid prevent aggregation at 300-320 mOsm. Arginine, glycine and histidine were<br>
not tested at concentrations other than 200 mOsm. Selected carbohydrates have no effect on<br>
vector particle aggregation when present at concentrations up to 5% w/v. For example, 5%<br>
w/v glycerol (543 mOsm) does not prevent aggregation. The surfactants Polysorbate80 (1%<br>
w/v) and Pluronic® F68 (10% w/v) similarly have no effect on aggregation using the<br>
"dilution-stress" method.<br>
AAV Aggregation as a Function of Osmolarity and Ionic Strength<br>
FIGS. 1A and 1B show the results of a more detailed analysis of vector aggregation as<br>
a function of the concentration of various salts. FIG. 1A shows vector aggregation as a<br>
function of the osmolarity of selected excipients. For charged species a concentration-<br>
dependent inhibition of AAV2 vector aggregation is observed. Salts with multivalent ions<br>
achieve a similar degree of inhibition of aggregation at lower concentrations than monovalent<br>
sodium chloride. For example, magnesium sulfate prevents aggregation at 200 mOsm<br>
whereas sodium chloride requires 350 mOsm to achieve a similar effect. Sodium citrate,<br>
sodium sulfate, and sodium phosphate are intermediate in their potency to prevent vector<br>
aggregation.<br>
Although the results in FIG. 1A and Table 1 show no effect of glycerol and certain<br>
sugars at concentrations up to 5% on AAV2 vector aggregation induced by low ionic<br><br><br>
strength, the data cannot rule out improvement of AAV2 solubility at glycerol concentrations<br>
above 5%. For example, Xie and co-workers reported that 25% (w/v) glycerol enabled<br>
concentration of AAV2 to very high concentrations (4.4 to 18 x 1014 particles/ml) in low<br>
ionic strength solutions. Xie, Q. et al. (2004) J. Virol. Methods 122: 17-27.<br>
FIG. 1B shows the data of FIG. 1A plotted as a function of the calculated ionic<br>
strength, rather than osmolality, for each excipient. FIG. 1B demonstrates that vector<br>
aggregation is prevented when ionic strength is ~200 mM or greater regardless of which salt<br>
is used. These data suggested that the ionic strength (µ) of a solution, a parameter that<br>
depends on both solute concentration and charge valency, is the primary factor affecting<br>
aggregation.<br>
Ionic strengths useful to prevent aggregation in embodiments of the present invention<br>
include, for example, 250 mM, 300 mM, 350 mM, 400 mM, 450 mM, 500 mM, 600 mM,<br>
700 mM or higher ionic strengths. Multivalent ions are preferred to achieve these ionic<br>
strengths in methods and formulations of the present invention, such as divalent, trivalent,<br>
tetravalent, pentavalent ions and ions of even higher valency. The pH buffer in solutions and<br>
formulations of the present invention may be phosphate, Tris, or HEPES (or other Good's<br>
buffers), but any other suitable pH buffer may be used. In preferred embodiments, the<br>
multivalent ions and buffer are selected to be compatible with the target tissue for the vector<br>
being prepared.<br>
Use of multivalent ions in the methods and compositions of the invention makes it<br>
possible to create compositions of high ionic strength but relatively low osmolality. High<br>
ionic strength compositions of the present invention may be nearly isotonic, and may be, for<br>
example, about 200mOsm, 250mOsm, 280mOsm, 300mOsm, 350mOsm or 400mOsm,<br>
although other osmolalities may be acceptable for some uses of the compositions.<br>

AA V Aggregation as a Function of the Method of AA V Purification<br>
Recombinant AAV2 purified using different methods (e.g. density gradient<br>
purification versus ion-exchange chromatography) would be expected to have different<br>
impurity profiles. FIG. 2 shows vector aggregation as a function of ionic strength for several<br>
preparations of AAV differing in the purification method. Purification methods are described<br>
in Example 1. Sodium chloride is used to vary the ionic strength. AAV2-FIX vectors<br>
purified by double cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation (Method 1), by cation<br>
exchange column chromatography (Method 2), or by combined column and cesium chloride<br>
gradient ultracentrifugation (Method 3) each demonstrate similar aggregation responses as<br>
ionic strength is decreased. In contrast, AAV2-FIX purified by the column method and then<br>
subjected to a nuclease digestion step (Method 2 + nuclease) shows reduced aggregation at<br>
low ionic strength.<br>
AAV Aggregation at Preparative Scale<br>
The data in Table 1 and FIGS. 1 A, 1B and 2 involve vector aggregation at an<br>
analytical scale, employing DLS to measure aggregation. Table 2, in contrast, shows the<br>
effects of elevated ionic strength and nuclease treatment on AAV2 vector aggregation at a<br>
larger scale, using methods to induce and quantify vector aggregation that are relevant to<br>
preparative scale vector purification. Experimental details are provided in Example 2.<br>
Purified AAV vectors are diafiltered into solutions of various ionic strengths, the volume is<br>
reduced to achieve high vector concentrations, and aggregation is then assessed by measuring<br>
vector recovery after filtration through a 0.22µm filter. Aliquots from a single pool of<br>
AAV2-AADC vector purified by Method 1 through the second CsCl gradient centrifugation<br>
step (1.8xl015 vg in 91mL, 1.8xl013 vg/mL, in ~3M CsCl) are used as starting material in the<br>
diafiltration experiments. Tangential flow filtration using hollow fibers is used for<br><br><br>
diafiltration because it is scalable and yet it still enables preparation of volumes (min.<br>
1,4mL), and thus AAV concentrations, at which aggregation would be expected in neutral<br>
buffered saline.<br>
In Experiment 1, three hollow fiber units are used to diafilter AAV2-AADC vector in<br>
formulations CF, TF1, or TF2, and the volume is reduced to a target of 2.5xl013 vg/mL. See<br>
Example 2. The samples are then filtered through a 0.22um filter. Results are shown in<br>
Table 2. Vector recovery ("Yield %") for both elevated ionic strength formulations TF1 (95<br>
± 7.4%) and TF2 (93 ± 7.4%) are significantly higher than the recovery using the control<br>
formulation CF.(77 ± 6.6%).<br><br>
In Experiment 2, AAV2-AADC is concentrated to a higher target value (6.7x1013<br>
vg/mL) in CF or.TF2. Vector recovery using TF2 (96 ± 4.4%) is again significantly higher<br>
than recovery using CF (59 ± 6.0%). Within the variability of the assays used, vector was<br>
recovered fully at both target concentrations using TF2, indicating that aggregation was<br>
prevented. In contrast, significant aggregation was observed at both target concentrations<br>
using CF, and the extent of aggregation (i.e. loss following 0.22 µm filtration) was higher at<br>
the higher target vector concentration. In an additional experiment (not shown), 50 µL<br><br>
samples of AAV2 vector are taken following concentration but prior to the 0.22µm filtration<br>
step of Experiment 2, and examined by light microscopy. Vector concentrated in CF contains<br>
obvious amounts of visible material (not shown), while no such material is seen in vector<br>
concentrated in TF2.<br>
Experiment 3 examines the effect of prior nuclease digestion of purified vector on<br>
aggregation. In the absence of nuclease digestion recovery of AAV2-AADC in CF is 68 ±<br>
11%, similar to the recoveries in Experiments 1 and 2. In contrast, purified vector treated<br>
with nuclease and then concentrated in CF gives higher recovery (91 ± 12%). These prep<br>
scale results reflect the same effect of nuclease digestion shown in FIG. 2 using the "dilution-<br>
stress" (analytical scale) method.<br>
The results presented in Table 2 demonstrate that the methods and compositions of<br>
the present invention increase the recovery of AAV vector recovery. For example, in various<br>
embodiments of the present invention, recovery is improved from less than about 80% to at<br>
least about 85%, 90%, 95% or more.<br>
AA V Stability and Activity Following Storage or Freeze-Thaw Cycling<br>
Croyle and coworkers reported a significant loss of titer of AAV and adenovirus<br>
following multiple freeze-thaw cycling in sodium phosphate buffer, and demonstrated that<br>
the better pH buffering provided by potassium phosphate during freeze-thaw cycling<br>
prevented titer loss. Croyle, M. A. et al. (2001) Gene Therapy 8: 1281-1290. Results of our<br>
freeze-thaw stability study using sodium phosphate support these findings. We find that<br>
while 150mM sodium phosphate provides sufficient ionic strength to prevent aggregation<br>
during preparation and non-frozen storage of concentrated AAV2-AADC vector, even a<br>
single freeze-thaw cycle at -20 or -80 °C results in aggregation.<br><br>
AAV stability after storage or freeze-thaw (F/T) cycling is assessed in buffers of the<br>
present invention as follows. The concentrated vectors prepared in CF, TF1, and TF2 (Table<br>
2, Experiment 1) are subjected to a short stability study to investigate whether aggregation<br>
will occur during refrigerated storage, or following multiple freeze-thaw (F/T) cycles.<br>
Aggregation is assessed by DLS using undiluted samples, and Rh values &gt;20nm are deemed<br>
to indicate the occurrence of some level of aggregation.<br><br>
As shown in Table 3, AAV2-AADC vector prepared in CF shows some aggregation<br>
after 5 days of storage at 4 °C, as well as following one or more F/T cycles at -20 or -80°C.<br>
For vector prepared in TF1, no aggregation occurs after 5 days at 4°C, but aggregation occurs<br>
following a single F/T cycle at -20 or -80 °C as indicated by a DLS signal intensity that is too<br>
high to measure. Visual inspection of these samples reveals slight cloudiness, which is<br>
consistent with aggregation. For vector prepared in TF2, no aggregation is observed at 4 °C,<br>
or following up to 10 F/T cycles at -20 °C. Some aggregation is observed following 5 and 10<br>
F/T cycles at -80 °C.<br><br>
AAV activity after storage or F/T cycling in TF2 is assessed as follows. As described<br>
above, the high ionic strength, isotonic formulation TF2 effectively prevents vector<br>
aggregation during concentration and storage, and therefore represents a promising candidate<br>
for further study. An important question is whether preparation and storage of the vector in<br>
high ionic strength TF2 would adversely affect its functional activity. To assess this, assays<br>
are performed to measure the infectious titer and the transduction efficiency of vectors<br>
prepared and stored for an extended period of time in TF2.<br>
For infectivity, a highly sensitive infectivity assay capable of detecting single<br>
infectious events is used. Zhen, Z. et al (2004) Human Gene Ther. 15: 709-715. AAV2-<br>
AADC is prepared in TF2 at a concentration of 6.4x1013 vg/mL. After being stored for 45<br>
days at 4 °C the preparation has a vector genome to infectious unit ratio (vg/IU) of 13,<br>
compared to a value of 16 vg/IU for the reference vector.. This difference is not significant<br>
given the reported variability of this assay (RSD -50%).<br>
Transduction efficiency is assessed by measuring the expression of AADC protein by<br>
ELISA following transduction of D7/4 cells. FIG. 3 shows no significant difference between<br>
vector prepared in TF2 and the reference control for vector input ranging from 10 to 105<br>
vg/cell. Together, these data indicate that preparation and storage of AAV2 vectors in high<br>
ionic strength TF2 does not have a deleterious effect on vector infectivity or transduction<br>
efficiency.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The effect of ionic strength (µ) on virus particle interactions is determined to elucidate<br>
the mechanism of vector aggregation. The ionic strength of neutral-buffered isotonic saline<br>
(µ = 150mM) is insufficient to prevent aggregation of AAV2 vectors purified by gradient<br>
ultracentrifugation or by cation exchange chromatography at concentrations exceeding ~1013<br><br><br>
particles/mL. Inclusion of sugars (sorbitol, sucrose, mannitol, trehalose, glycerol) at<br>
concentrations up to 5% (w/v) or of surfactants Tween80® (1%) or Pluronic® F68 (10%) does<br>
not prevent aggregation of vector particles.<br>
In contrast, vector particles remain soluble when elevated ionic strength solutions (µ &gt;<br>
200mM) are used during purification and for final vector formulation. Elevated ionic<br>
strength solutions using isotonic excipient concentrations for in vivo administration are<br>
prepared with salts of multivalent ions, including sodium citrate, sodium phosphate, and<br>
magnesium sulfate. An isotonic formulation containing 10mM Tris, 100mM sodium citrate,<br>
0.001% Pluronic® F68, pH 8.0 (µ ~500mM) enables concentration of AAV2-AADC vectors<br>
to 6.4x1013 vg/mL with no aggregation observed during preparation and following ten freeze-<br>
thaw cycles at -20 °C. See Table 3, below, and accompanying discussion. AAV2-AADC<br>
vectors prepared and stored for an extended period in elevated ionic strength formulation<br>
retain high infectivity titer (13 IU/vg) and transduction efficiency.<br>
Nuclease treatment of purified AAV2 vectors reduces the degree of vector<br>
aggregation, implicating vector surface nucleic acid impurities in inter-particle interactions.<br>
Hence, purification methods to efficiently remove vector surface residual nucleic acids,<br>
coupled with the use of elevated ionic strength isotonic formulations, are useful methods to<br>
prevent AAV2 vector aggregation.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
AAV PURIFICATION METHODS<br>
AAV2 vectors expressing human coagulation factor IX (FIX) or human amino acid<br>
decarboxylase (AADC) are produced by triple transfection of HEK293 cells as previously<br>
described (Matsushita, T. et al. (1998) Gene Therapy 5: 938-945), with modifications. For<br><br><br>
the large scale preparations, cells are cultured and transfected in 850 mm2 roller bottles<br>
(Corning). Vectors are purified by one of three methods.<br>
In purification Method 1, modified from Matsushita, transfected HEK293 cells in<br>
roller bottles are collected by centrifugation (1000g, 15min), resuspended in 10mM sodium<br>
phosphate, 500mM sodium chloride, pH 7.2, and lysed by three freeze / thaw cycles<br>
(alternating an ethanol / dry ice bath and a 37°C water bath). The cell lysate is clarified by<br>
centrifugation (8,000g, 15 min). The supernatant is then diluted to 200mM NaCl by addition<br>
of lOmM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and digested with Benzonase® (Merck, Purity Grade 1;<br>
200 U/mL, 1h, 37 °C). The lysate is adjusted to 25mM CaCl2 using a IM stock solution, and<br>
incubated at 4°C for one hour.<br>
The mixture is centrifuged (8,000g, 15 min), and the supernatant containing vector is<br>
collected. To precipitate virus from the clarified cell lysate, polyethylene glycol (PEG8000)<br>
is added to a final concentration of 8%, the mixture incubated at 4°C for three hours, and then<br>
centrifuged (8,000g, 15 min). The pellets containing vector are re-suspended with mixing in<br>
0.15M NaCl, 50mM Hepes, 25mM EDTA, pH 8.0 and incubated at 4°C for 16 hours. The<br>
resuspended material is pooled, and solid cesium chloride is added to a final density of 1.40<br>
gm/ml. Vector is then banded by ultracentrifugation (SW28,27,000rpm, 24h, 20°C) using a<br>
Beckman model LE-80 centrifuge. The centrifugation tubes are fractionated, and densities<br>
from 1.38 to 1.42 gm/mL containing vector are pooled. This material is banded a second<br>
time by ultracentrifugation (NVT65 rotor, 65,000 rpm, 16h, 20°C), and fractions containing<br>
purified AAV2 vectors are pooled. To concentrate vector and to perform buffer exchange,<br>
vectors in concentrated cesium chloride solution are subjected to ultrafiltration / diafiltration<br>
(UF/DF) by tangential flow filtration as described below (Example 2).<br>
In purification Method 2, cell harvests containing AAV are microfluidized and<br>
filtered sequentially through 0.65 and 0.22 µm filters (Sartorius). Virus is purified from the<br><br><br>
clarified cell lysates by cation exchange chromatography using Poros HS50 resin as<br>
previously described. U.S. Pat. No. 6,593,123. For the nuclease digestion described in<br>
FIG. 2, column-purified vectors are incubated (4h, RT) with 100 U/mL Benzonase and 10<br>
U/mL DNAse I (RNAse free, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana).<br>
For purification Method 3, AAV2 vectors purified by cation exchange<br>
chromatography are subjected to an additional cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation<br>
step (SW28,27,000rpm, 20h) to remove empty capsids prior to UF/DF.<br>
Real time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) is used to quantify AAV preparations as<br>
previously described. Sommer, J. M. et al. (2003) Mol. Therapy 7: 122-128. Vectors<br>
purified by each of the three methods are analyzed by SDS-PAGE / silver staining analysis,<br>
and in all cases VP1, VP2 and VP3 are present in the expected ratios, with the capsid proteins<br>
representing &gt;95% of total proteins as determined by scanning densitometry. However,<br>
unlike gradient-purified AAV2 vectors purified using Methods 1 and 3, vectors purified by<br>
Method 2 (column chromatography) contain empty capsids, ranging from 3-10 empty capsids<br>
per vector genome.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
ULTRAFILTRATION AND DIAFILTRATION TO DETECT AAV AGGREGATION<br>
Disposable hollow fiber tangential flow filtration devices (Amersham BioSciences 8"<br>
Midgee, 100 kDa nominal pore size) are used to concentrate and diafilter AAV2 vectors<br>
purified by the methods described above, and for the UF/DF experiments described in Table<br>
2. For all UF/DF procedures a volume of diafiltration buffer corresponding to 10x the<br>
product volume is used, and it is added in ~1mL increments to approximate continuous<br>
diafiltration. Using this method, the calculated residual CsCl after diafiltration is 
21<br><br>
The following three formulations were used for UF/DF: Control Formulation (CF:<br>
140mM sodium chloride, 10mM sodium phosphate, 5% sorbitol, pH 7.3); Test Formulation 1<br>
(TF1: 150mM sodium phosphate, pH7.5); and Test Formulation 2 (TF2: 100mM sodium<br>
citrate, 10mM Tris, pH8.0). For Experiment 1 shown in Table 2, diafiltration is performed at<br>
a volume corresponding to a vector concentration of 1x 1013 vg/mL, and following<br>
diafiltration the volume is reduced to a value corresponding to 2.5x1013 vg/mL (assuming no<br>
vector loss).<br>
For Experiment 2, diafiltration is performed at a volume corresponding to a 2x1013<br>
vg/mL, and the volume is then reduced to a value corresponding to 6.7x1013 vg/mL.<br>
For Experiment 3 (CF ± Bz), AAV2-AADC (approximately 1.2x1014 vg) is first<br>
diafiltered into TF1 (a formulation compatible with nuclease activity) and then passed<br>
through a 0.22 µm filter. The titer of this material is determined, and the volume is adjusted<br>
to correspond to a concentration of 1x1013 vg/mL. To 10 mL of this material, MgCl2 is added<br>
to a concentration of 2 mM, and then divided into two equal aliquots. One aliquot is<br>
incubated with Benzonase (200 U/mL, 4h, RT), and the second is mock-incubated. Each<br>
aliquot is then diafiltered at a volume corresponding to a vector concentration 2x1013 vg/mL,<br>
and then concentrated to a 3.6x1013 vg/mL target. Following all UF/DF protocols, Pluronic®<br>
F-68 (BASF Corp., Mount Olive, NJ) from a 1% stock is added to the vector product to a<br>
final concentration of 0.001%, and the solution is passed through a 0.22µm syringe filter<br>
(Sartorius). All UF/DF procedures are performed in a laminar flow cabinet.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
MEASUREMENT OF VECTOR AGGREGATION BY<br>
DYNAMIC LIGHT SCATTERING<br>
Purified vectors are analyzed for aggregation by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using<br>
a Protein Solutions DynaPro 99 (λ=825.4 nm). Primary data (particle radius - Rh, average<br>
value measured over 30 cycles, 10 cycles/min) are used for all analyses reported. A<br>
"dilution-stress" method is used to assess the effect of varying excipients on vector<br>
aggregation. In this method, 80 µL of test diluent is added to 20 µL of vector solution with<br>
mixing in the actual cuvette used for DLS measurement, and data collection is initiated<br>
within 10 seconds of mixing. Prior to addition of test diluents, the Rh value for AAV2 vector<br>
preparations is measured and confirmed to be 
monomeric. Samples that are not 100% monomelic are passed through a 0.22µm syringe<br>
disc filter (Sartorius, low protein binding) to remove aggregates.<br>
The osmolarity and ionic strength values given in FIGS. 1 and 2 are calculated using<br>
all excipients present in the mixture (i.e. weighted: test diluent (80%) and starting vector<br>
formulation (20%)). Osmolarity is calculated according to the equation: Osmolarity = ci,<br>
where ci is the molar concentration of each solute species. The ionic strength (µ) is<br>
calculated according to the equation: µ = ½ ciz2, where zi is the charge on each species. In<br>
conditions that resulted in vector aggregation (e.g. low µ) a progressive increase in Rh is<br>
observed over the course of data collection. To validate the use of the average Rh measured<br>
over the 3 minute interval following dilution as a reliable measure of aggregation, the average<br>
rate of increase of Rh (ΔRh I At) over the same time interval is also determined (not shown).<br>
Analysis of ΔRh / Δt gives results concordant with those obtained using the average Rh value<br>
reported in FIGS. 1 and 2.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
AAV VIRION rNFECTIVITY<br>
Infectivity of AAV2-AADC vectors is determined using a highly sensitive assay as<br>
previously described. Zhen, Z. et ah (2004) Human Gene Ther. 15: 709-715. Briefly,<br>
samples are serially diluted (10-fold dilutions, 10 replicates / dilution) and added to D7/4<br>
cells (modified HeLa cells expressing AAV rep and cap) grown in 96 well tissue culture<br>
plates (Falcon, cat. #353227) in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS. Adenovirus (Ad-5,<br>
100 vp/cell) is added to each well to provide helper functions. After 48h, replication of AAV<br>
vector in each well is quantified by Q-PCR using transgene-specific primers and probes, and<br>
the frequency of infection at limiting dilution is analyzed by the Karber method to calculate<br>
the infectivity titer. The test sample is run concurrently with an AAV2-AADC reference<br>
previously prepared in CF and stored at -80 °C.<br>
The transduction efficiency of AAV2 vectors is quantified by a whole cell ELISA.<br>
D7/4 cells grown in 96 well plates are infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of the test sample<br>
and reference vector, corresponding to 10 to 105 vg / cell input (5 replicates / dilution). After<br>
48h, the culture medium is removed, and cells are washed twice with 200 µL PBS (10 mM<br>
sodium phosphate, 140mM sodium chloride, pH 7.2). Cells are then permeabilized and fixed<br>
by addition of 100µL of PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 4% paraformaldehyde to<br>
each well (15 min). The fixing solution is removed, and the cells are washed twice with PBS<br>
containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Non-specific sites are blocked by adding PBS containing 3%<br>
bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.5% Triton X-100 (60min).<br>
After washing, cells are incubated for one hour with rabbit anti-AADC IgG antibody<br>
(Chemicon, AB136), and washed. Cells are then incubated for one hour with alkaline<br>
phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and washed. Antibodies are diluted 1:1000 in<br>
PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.5% Triton X-100. Substrate (PNPP, Pierce, cat. #34047) is then<br><br><br>
added (1 mg/mL in IX diethanolamine substrate buffer, Pierce, cat. #34064), and after<br>
incubation for 30min the concentration of cleaved substrate is measured<br>
spectrophotometrically (λ=405nm). Human AADC expression as a function of vector input<br>
is fitted using a spline curve (SigmaPlot). The AAV2-AADC reference vector is measured<br>
concurrently with the test sample.<br>
