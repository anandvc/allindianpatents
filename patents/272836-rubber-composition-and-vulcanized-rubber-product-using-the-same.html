RUBBER COMPOSITION AND VULCANIZED RUBBER PRODUCT<br>
USING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a rubber composition<br>
and a vulcanized rubber product using such rubber<br>
composition.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Oil resistance and weather resistance (in particular<br>
ozone resistance) are required for the outer layer rubber<br>
of hydraulic hoses and high-pressure hoses. These hoses<br>
very often have a brass-plated reinforced layer such as a<br>
brass-plated wire, so that the rubber composition applied<br>
to the outer layer rubber is also required to have adhesion<br>
to a metal such as brass during vulcanization.<br>
[0003]<br>
Therefore, chloroprene rubber (CR)-based rubbers<br>
which are excellent in oil resistance, weather resistance<br>
and adhesion to metals during vulcanization have<br>
conventionally been used as the outer layer rubber of<br>
hydraulic hoses and high-pressure hoses.<br>
 <br>
[0004]<br>
However, in recent years, from the viewpoint of<br>
environmental control and in particular dioxin control,<br>
halogenated rubbers are used less frequently, whereas<br>
rubber mixtures of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubbers and<br>
olefin rubbers are being used for the material having oil<br>
resistance and weather resistance (see, for example, Patent<br>
Document 1).<br>
[0005]<br>
Patent Document 1 describes a rubber composition<br>
comprising 20 to 80 wt% of an α,β-unsaturated nitrile-<br>
conjugated diene copolymer rubber, 18 to 60 wt% of an<br>
ethylene-α-olefin-nonconjugated diene copolymer rubber,<br>
and 2 to 20 wt% of an aromatic vinyl compound-conjugated<br>
diene copolymer rubber.<br>
[0006]<br>
Patent Documents 2 to 5 describe that the adhesion to<br>
metals during vulcanization may be improved by the addition<br>
of a metal salt of an organic acid.<br>
[0007]<br>
Patent Document 1: JP 62-172043 A<br>
Patent Document 2: JP 2005-188607 A<br>
Patent Document 3: JP 2005-188608 A<br>
Patent Document 4: JP 2005-291281 A<br>
 <br>
Patent Document 5: JP 2005-291282 A<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0008]<br>
Although the rubber composition described in Patent<br>
Document 1 had excellent oil resistance and weather<br>
resistance, its adhesion to brass was not sufficient.<br>
In addition, the rubber compositions described in<br>
Patent Documents 2 to 5 did not exhibit satisfactory oil<br>
resistance and weather resistance, although having adhesion<br>
to metals during vulcanization.<br>
[0009]<br>
Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide<br>
a rubber composition which is excellent in oil resistance<br>
and weather resistance and also adheres well to brass.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a vulcanized<br>
rubber product using such rubber composition.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0010]<br>
The inventors of the invention have found that a<br>
rubber composition including a rubber component (A), an<br>
inorganic filler (B), a plasticizer (C), and a process oil<br>
(D) wherein the rubber component (A) contains 30 to 60 wt%<br>
of an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, 20 to 40 wt% of an<br>
 <br>
ethylene-propylene-nonconjugated diene rubber, and 20 to 50<br>
wt% of a styrene-butadiene rubber, the content of the<br>
inorganic filler (B) is 5 to 100 parts by weight with<br>
respect to 100 parts by weight of the rubber component (A),<br>
and the weight ratio of the plasticizer (C) to the process<br>
oil (D) is 15/85 to 75/25, is excellent in oil resistance<br>
and weather resistance and also adheres well to brass, and<br>
the invention has been thus completed.<br>
[0011]<br>
Specifically, the invention provides the following<br>
(1) to (10) .<br>
(1)	A rubber composition including a rubber component<br>
(A), an inorganic filler (B), a plasticizer (C), and a<br>
process oil (D),<br>
wherein the rubber component (A) contains 30 to 60<br>
wt% of an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, 20 to 40 wt% of<br>
an ethylene-propylene-nonconjugated diene rubber, and 20 to<br>
50 wt% of a styrene-butadiene rubber,<br>
the content of the inorganic filler (B) is 5 to 100<br>
parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the<br>
rubber component (A) , and<br>
the weight ratio of the plasticizer (C) to the<br>
process oil (D) is 15/85 to 75/25.<br>

 <br>
rubber component (A) contains 30 to 50 wt% of the<br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, 20 to 35 wt% of the<br>
ethylene-propylene-nonconjugated diene rubber, and 25 to 50<br>
wt% of the styrene-butadiene rubber.<br>
(3)	The rubber composition of (1) or (2) above,<br>
wherein the inorganic filler (B) is clay.<br>
(4)	The rubber composition of any one of (1) to (3)<br>
above, further including carbon black.<br>
(5)	The rubber composition of any one of (1) to (4)<br>
above, wherein the rubber composition is a rubber<br>
composition for use in hoses.<br>
(6)	A vulcanized rubber product obtained by<br>
vulcanizing the rubber composition of any one of (1) to (5)<br>
above.<br>
(7)	The vulcanized rubber product of (6) above,<br>
including a rubber layer obtained by vulcanizing the rubber<br>
composition of any one of (1) to (5) above and a brass-<br>
plated reinforced layer adjoining to the rubber layer.<br>
(8)	The vulcanized rubber product of (6) or (7) above<br>
which is a hose.<br>
(9)	The vulcanized rubber product of (7) above which<br>
is a hydraulic hose or a high-pressure hose.<br>

circumferential side of the reinforced layer,<br>
wherein at least the outer rubber layer is formed<br>
from the rubber composition of any one of (1) to (5) above.<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
[0012]<br>
The rubber composition of the invention is excellent<br>
in oil resistance and weather resistance and also adheres<br>
well to brass. In cases where the content of the inorganic<br>
filler (B) is 5 to 50 parts by weight with respect to 100<br>
parts by weight of the rubber component (A), the rubber<br>
composition of the invention also has excellent mechanical<br>
strength following vulcanization.<br>
The vulcanized rubber product of the invention can<br>
suppress the generation of dioxin during waste disposal and<br>
has therefore little effect on the environment. The<br>
vulcanized rubber product also has excellent oil resistance<br>
and weather resistance. Even in the case of using a<br>
reinforced layer having a brass-plated surface, the<br>
vulcanized rubber product has excellent durability owing to<br>
the excellent adhesion between the rubber layers and the<br>
reinforced layer.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0015]<br>
The invention is described more fully below.<br>
The rubber composition of the invention is a rubber<br>
composition including a rubber component (A), an inorganic<br>
filler (B), a plasticizer (C), and a process oil (D)<br>
wherein the rubber component (A) contains 30 to 60 wt% of<br>
an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, 20 to 40 wt% of an<br>
ethylene-propylene-nonconjugated diene rubber, and 20 to 50<br>
wt% of a styrene-butadiene rubber, the content of the<br>
inorganic filler (B) is 5 to 100 parts by weight with<br>
respect to 100 parts by weight of the rubber component (A) ,<br>
and the weight ratio of the plasticizer (C) to the process<br>
oil (D) is 15/85 to 75/25.<br>
[0016]<br>
 <br>
Rubber Component (A)<br>
The rubber component (A) contains 30 to 60 wt% of the<br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, 20 to 40 wt% of the<br>
ethylene-propylene-nonconjugated diene rubber, and 20 to 50<br>
wt% of the styrene-butadiene rubber.<br>
[0017]<br>
The acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) is a<br>
butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer and general NBRs may be<br>
used without any particular limitation. In terms of the<br>
oil resistance and cold resistance, the average amount of<br>
nitrile bonds in the NBR is preferably 15 to 50 wt% and<br>
more preferably 20 to 45 wt%.<br>
The NBR content in the rubber component (A) is 30 to<br>
60 wt%. At an NBR content of less than 30 wt%, the oil<br>
resistance is poor, whereas at an NBR content in excess of<br>
60 wt%, the weather resistance is poor.<br>
The NBR content in the rubber component (A) is<br>
preferably 30 to 50 wt% and more preferably 35 to 45 wt%<br>
because the oil resistance and the weather resistance can<br>
be simultaneously achieved at a high level.<br>
[0018]<br>
The ethylene-propylene-nonconjugated diene rubber<br>
(EPDM) is a terpolymer of ethylene, propylene and diene,<br>
and general EPDMs may be used without any particular<br>
 <br>
limitation.<br>
The EPDM content in the rubber component (A) is 20 to<br>
40 wt%. At an EPDM content of less than 20 wt%, the<br>
weather resistance is poor, whereas at an EPDM content in<br>
excess of 40 wt%, the oil resistance is poor.<br>
The EPDM content in the rubber component (A) is<br>
preferably 20 to 35 wt% and more preferably 25 to 35 wt%<br>
because the oil resistance and the weather resistance can<br>
be simultaneously achieved at a high level.<br>
[0019]<br>
The styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) is a styrene-<br>
butadiene copolymer and general SBRs may be used without<br>
any particular limitation.<br>
The SBR content in the rubber component (A) is 20 to<br>
50 wt%. At an SBR content of less than 20 wt%, the<br>
adhesion to brass during vulcanization is poor, whereas at<br>
an SBR content in excess of 50 wt%, the oil resistance and<br>
weather resistance are poor.<br>
In terms of excellent oil resistance and weather<br>
resistance and higher adhesion to brass during<br>
vulcanization, the SBR content in the rubber component (A)<br>
is preferably 25 to 50 wt% and more preferably 25 to 35<br>
wt%.<br>
[0020]<br>
 <br>
The rubber component (A) may contain other rubbers<br>
than the NBR, EPDM and SBR, as long as the effects of the<br>
invention are not impaired. Such rubbers are hereinafter<br>
referred to as "other rubbers".<br>
Exemplary other rubbers include natural rubber (NR),<br>
epoxidized natural rubber (ENR), isoprene rubber (IR),<br>
acrylonitrile-isoprene rubber (NIR), butadiene rubber (BR),<br>
butyl rubber (IIR), hydrogenated nitrile rubber (HNBR),<br>
acrylic rubber (ACM), styrene-isoprene-butadiene rubber<br>
(SIBR), carboxylated butadiene rubber (XBR), carboxylated<br>
nitrile rubber (XNBR), carboxylated styrene butadiene<br>
rubber (XSBR), ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVM),<br>
ethyl acrylate-acrylonitrile copolymer (ANM), and ethyl<br>
acrylate-ethylene copolymer (AEM).<br>
Such other rubbers may be preferably incorporated in<br>
the rubber component (A) in an amount of not more than 30<br>
wt% and more preferably 0 wt%.<br>
[0021]<br>
Inorganic Filler (B)<br>
Any known inorganic fillers may be used for the<br>
inorganic filler (B) without particular limitation. The<br>
rubber composition of the invention containing a specific<br>
amount of the inorganic filler (B) has excellent adhesion<br>
to brass during vulcanization.<br>
 <br>
Examples of the inorganic filler (B) include clay,<br>
talc, calcium carbonate, activated calcium carbonate,<br>
magnesium carbonate, basic magnesium carbonate, finely-<br>
divided magnesium silicate, zinc carbonate, silica, mica,<br>
iron oxide, zinc oxide, titanium oxide, barium oxide,<br>
magnesium oxide, barium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and<br>
aluminum sulfate. Such inorganic fillers may be used<br>
singly or as combinations of two or more thereof. Carbon<br>
black is not included in the inorganic filler (B).<br>
Of these, clay is preferred in terms of its excellent<br>
adhesion to brass during vulcanization and its excellent<br>
rubber tensile strength and wear resistance.<br>
[0022]<br>
Examples of the clay include pyrophyllite clay,<br>
kaolin clay, sintered clay and silane-modified clay. These<br>
may be used singly or as combinations of two or more<br>

Of these, kaolin clay is preferred in terms of its<br>
excellent rubber-reinforcing properties.<br>
[0023]<br>
The content of the inorganic filler (B) is 5 to 100<br>
parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the<br>
rubber component (A). At an inorganic filler (B) content<br>
of less than 5 parts by weight, the adhesion to brass<br>
 <br>
during vulcanization is poor, whereas at an inorganic<br>
filler (B) content in excess of 100 parts by weight, the<br>
mechanical strength of vulcanized rubber is poor.<br>
The content of the inorganic filler (B) is preferably<br>
5 to 50 parts by weight and more preferably 10 to 25 parts<br>
by weight because the adhesion to brass during<br>
vulcanization and mechanical strength of vulcanized rubber<br>
are excellent.<br>
[0024]<br>

polyester plasticizers; polymerizable polyether<br>
plasticizers; and pentaerythritol esters. These may be<br>
used singly or as combinations of two or more thereof.<br>
Of these, triisononyl trimellitate as a trimellitic<br>
acid derivative and tricresyl phosphate as a phosphoric<br>
acid derivative are preferred in terms of their excellent<br>
oil resistance and heat resistance.<br>
[0025]<br>
The content of the plasticizer (C) is not<br>
particularly limited as long as the weight ratio of the<br>
plasticizer (C) to the process oil (D) to be described<br>
later is satisfied, and is preferably 2 to 75 parts by<br>
weight, more preferably 5 to 50 parts by weight and even<br>
more preferably 10 to 30 parts by weight with respect to<br>
100 parts by weight of the rubber component (A). At a<br>
plasticizer (C) content within the above-defined range, the<br>
rubber characteristics such as mechanical strength of<br>
vulcanized rubber, heat resistance and rubber extrudability<br>
are excellent.<br>

Any known process oils may be used for the process<br>
oil (D) without particular limitation.<br>
Examples of the process oil (D) include mineral oils<br>

later is satisfied, and is preferably 2 to 75 parts by<br>
weight, more preferably 5 to 50 parts by weight and even<br>
more preferably 10 to 30 parts by weight with respect to<br>

process oil (D) content within the above-defined range, the<br>
mechanical strength of vulcanized rubber, heat resistance<br>
and rubber extrudability are excellent.<br>
[0028]<br>
The weight ratio of the plasticizer (C) to the<br>
process oil (D) in the rubber composition of the invention<br>
(plasticizer (C) / process oil (D)) is 15/85 to 75/25,<br>
preferably 30/70 to 70/30 and more preferably 40/60 to<br>
 <br>
60/40. At a weight ratio within the above-defined range,<br>
the adhesion to brass during vulcanization and mechanical<br>
strength of vulcanized rubber are excellent.<br>
[0029]<br>
The rubber composition of the invention further<br>
contains a vulcanizing agent.<br>
Examples of the vulcanizing agent include sulfur such<br>
as powdered sulfur, precipitated sulfur, highly dispersible<br>

 <br>
accelerators, and xanthate vulcanization accelerators.<br>
These may be used singly or as combinations of two or more<br>
thereof.<br>
Of these, sulfenamide vulcanization accelerators are<br>
preferred because the covulcanization properties of the<br>
rubber component (A) are good and the rubber mechanical<br>
strength is excellent.<br>

the invention including carbon black is excellent in rubber<br>
characteristics such as rubber tensile strength and wear<br>
 <br>
resistance.<br>

[0034]<br>
Examples of the thermal black include FT (Fine<br>
Thermal) and MT (Medium Thermal).<br>
[0035]<br>
In terms of reinforcing properties and rubber<br>
extrudability, ISAF carbon black, HAF carbon black, FEF<br>
carbon black, GPF carbon black and SRF carbon black are<br>
preferred carbon blacks, with FEF carbon black, GPF carbon<br>
black and SRF carbon black being more preferred. These may<br>
be used singly or as combinations of two or more thereof.<br>
[0036]<br>
The carbon black content is preferably 20 to 120<br>
parts by weight and more preferably 40 to 80 parts by<br>
weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the rubber<br>
 <br>
component (A).<br>
[0037]<br>
Various additives such as reinforcing agents,<br>
antioxidants, vulcanization activators, antiscorching<br>
agents, tackifiers, lubricants, dispersants, processing<br>
aids, and aids for vulcanization adhesion may be optionally-<br>
blended in the rubber composition of the invention.<br>
[0038]<br>
Although the method of producing the rubber<br>
composition of the invention is not particularly limited,<br>
the rubber composition of the invention can be obtained by<br>
a method which involves kneading the essential ingredients<br>
except the vulcanizing agent and vulcanization accelerator,<br>
and optional ingredients in a 3.4 L Banbury mixer for 5<br>
minutes, taking out the mixture from the mixer at 160oC to<br>
prepare a masterbatch, adding the vulcanizing agent and<br>
vulcanization accelerator to the masterbatch, and kneading<br>
the resulting mixture with an open roll.<br>
This rubber composition can be further vulcanized<br>
under appropriate conditions to obtain the vulcanized<br>
rubber product of the invention.<br>
[0039]<br>
The rubber composition of the invention includes the<br>
rubber component (A), the inorganic filler (B), the<br>
 <br>
plasticizer (C) and the process oil (D) at the above-<br>
described specific ratio and has therefore oil resistance<br>
and weather resistance in a balanced manner while also<br>
exhibiting excellent adhesion to brass.<br>
In cases where the content of the inorganic filler<br>
(B) is 50 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by<br>
weight of the rubber component (A), the rubber composition<br>
of the invention also has excellent mechanical strength<br>
following vulcanization.<br>
[0040]<br>
The rubber composition of the invention has the<br>
excellent properties as described above and can be<br>
therefore advantageously used as the rubber composition for<br>
hoses. The rubber composition of the invention may also be<br>
employed as the rubber material for vulcanization adhesion<br>
which is used to adhere together rubber materials of<br>
different polarities.<br>
The rubber composition of the invention is useful as<br>
the rubber material for rubber/metal composite products<br>
which may be used in the fields requiring oil resistance<br>
and weather resistance. In particular, the rubber<br>
composition of the invention can be advantageously employed<br>
for the outer layer rubber in high-pressure hoses having a<br>
brass-plated, steel wire reinforced pressure-proof layer<br>
 <br>
and for the intermediate rubber used between brass-plated,<br>
steel wire reinforced pressure-proof layers.<br>
[0041]<br>
Next, the vulcanized rubber product of the invention<br>
is described.<br>
The vulcanized rubber product of the invention is not<br>
particularly limited as long as it is obtained by<br>
vulcanizing the above-described rubber composition of the<br>
invention, and a preferable example thereof includes one<br>
having a rubber layer obtained by vulcanizing the rubber<br>
composition of the invention and a brass-plated reinforced<br>
layer adjoining to the rubber layer.<br>
[0042]<br>
Specific examples of the vulcanized rubber product of<br>
the invention include hoses, conveyor belts, fenders,<br>
marine hoses and tires. Hoses are preferred and hydraulic<br>
hoses and high-pressure hoses as exemplified by steel wire<br>
reinforced hydraulic hoses for construction machines and<br>
hydraulic hoses for civil engineering works are more<br>
preferred.<br>
[0043]<br>
A preferred embodiment of the hose of the invention<br>
is described below with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 1 is a cutaway perspective view of hose layers.<br>
 <br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a hose 1 has an inner rubber<br>
layer 2 as the inner tube, and a reinforced layer 3 formed<br>
on the inner rubber layer 2 and an outer rubber layer 4 as<br>
the outer tube.<br>
[0044]<br>
Next, the rubber layers (inner rubber layer and outer<br>
rubber layer) and the reinforced layer making up the hose<br>
of the invention are described in detail.<br>
[0045]<br>

and hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer rubbers.<br>
In addition, mixtures with thermoplastic resins and<br>
thermoplastic elastomers may optionally be used.<br>
The rubber composition of the invention is a<br>
preferred rubber composition that may be used in the inner<br>
rubber layer.<br>
From the viewpoint that the hose obtained has<br>
excellent durability, the rubber composition used in the<br>
inner rubber layer preferably has a 100% modulus (M100)<br>
following vulcanization of at least 4 MPa and more<br>
preferably 5 to 20 MPa.<br>
As used herein, "100% modulus" refers to a value<br>
measured according to JIS K6251-2004.<br>
[0047]<br>
The rubber composition of the invention is preferably<br>
used as the rubber composition for the outer rubber layer,<br>
but an appropriate rubber composition may be selected and<br>
 <br>
composed in terms of the wear resistance and oil<br>
resistance.<br>
Exemplary rubber materials that may be used in the<br>
other rubber composition than that of the invention include<br>

rubbers (in particular AEM), hydrogenated NBR, and hydrin<br>
rubbers. In addition, mixtures with thermoplastic resins<br>
and thermoplastic elastomers may optionally be used.<br>
[0048]<br>
From the viewpoint that the hose obtained has<br>
excellent durability, the rubber composition used in the<br>
outer rubber layer preferably has a 100% modulus (M100)<br>
following vulcanization of at least 2 MPa and more<br>
preferably 3 to 15 MPa.<br>
The rubber composition that may be used in the outer<br>
rubber layer is subjected to an Akron abrasion test (method<br>
A) according to JIS K6264-2-2005 under the conditions of a<br>
leaning angle between a specimen and a grinding wheel of<br>
15°, a load applied to the grinding wheel of 27 N and a<br>
specimen rotational speed of 75 ± 5 rpm, and preferably has<br>
 <br>
a wear volume per 1000 revolutions of the grinding wheel of<br>
not more than 0.2 cm3.<br>
The rubber composition that may be used in the outer<br>
rubber layer preferably has a coefficient of expansion (VC)<br>
of not more than 100% as measured by the immersion test<br>
according to JIS K6258-2003 (immersion in IRM903 at 80°C<br>
for 72 hours).<br>
[0049]<br>
The inner rubber layer of the hose of the invention<br>
preferably has a thickness of 1.0 to 4.0 mm and more<br>
preferably 1.5 to 1.8 mm. The outer rubber layer<br>
preferably has a thickness of 0.5 to 2.5 mm and more<br>
preferably 0.8 to 1.5 mm.<br>
[0050]<br>
Reinforced Layer<br>
The reinforced layer is a layer provided outside the<br>
inner rubber layer in terms of holding strength. In the<br>
practice of the invention, the reinforced layer may be in<br>
the form of a blade or in a spiral form. The reinforced<br>
layer may be composed of two or more sublayers.<br>
In the case of the reinforced layer having two or<br>
more sublayers, exemplary rubber compositions that may be<br>
used in the intermediate rubber layer between the<br>
reinforced sublayers include those containing as their main<br>
 <br>
ingredient at least one rubber selected from the group<br>
consisting of chlorine-free synthetic rubbers such as NBR,<br>
NR, SBR, BR, EPDM, and ethylene-acrylic acid ester<br>
copolymer rubbers (in particular AEM) . In addition,<br>
mixtures with thermoplastic resins and thermoplastic<br>
elastomers may optionally be used. The rubber composition<br>
of the invention is a preferred rubber composition that may<br>
be used in the intermediate rubber layer.<br>
The rubber composition that may be used in the<br>
intermediate rubber layer preferably has a 100% modulus<br>
(M100) following vulcanization of at least 2 MPa.<br>
[0051]<br>
Exemplary materials that may be preferably used to<br>
form the reinforced layer include, but are not limited to,<br>
metallic materials such as hard steel wires (e.g., brass-<br>
plated wires and zinc-plated wires).<br>
The reinforced layer is preferably brass-plated in<br>
terms of high adhesion to the rubber composition of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0052]<br>
The method of manufacturing the hose of the invention<br>
including the rubber layers and the reinforced layer is not<br>
particularly limited but any conventionally known method<br>
may be used.<br>
 <br>
More specifically, an exemplary method that may be<br>
advantageously used includes a manufacturing method<br>
involving disposing the inner rubber layer, the reinforced<br>
layer and the outer rubber layer on a mandrel in this order<br>
and curing and adhering these layers by press<br>
vulcanization, steam vulcanization, oven vulcanization (hot<br>
air vulcanization) or hot water vulcanization under the<br>
conditions of 140 to 190°C and 30 to 180 minutes.<br>
[0053]<br>
The hose in another preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention includes an inner rubber layer, a first<br>
reinforced layer, an intermediate rubber layer, a second<br>
reinforced layer and an outer rubber layer disposed from<br>
inside in this order. It is particularly preferable for<br>
the outer rubber layer to be made of the rubber composition<br>
of the invention.<br>
[0054]<br>
Even in the case of using, for the reinforced layers,<br>
a material having a brass-plated surface (such as brass-<br>
plated wire), the hose of the invention exhibits excellent<br>
adhesion between the rubber layers and the reinforced<br>
layers by forming the rubber layers using the rubber<br>
composition of the invention. Therefore, the hose of the<br>
invention has excellent durability. The hose of the<br>
 <br>
invention also has excellent oil resistance and weather<br>
resistance.<br>
Examples<br>
[0055]<br>
Examples of the invention are given below by way of<br>
illustration, and not by way of limitation.<br>
Examples 1 to 11 and Comparative Examples 1 to 11<br>
The components shown in Table 1 were blended at a<br>
ratio (parts by weight) shown in Table 1 to prepare a<br>
rubber composition.<br>
More specifically, the ingredients shown in Table 1<br>
except sulfur and the vulcanization accelerator were first<br>
kneaded in a Banbury mixer (3.4 L) for 5 minutes and the<br>
kneaded mixture was taken out at 160oC to prepare a<br>
masterbatch. Then, the sulfur and the vulcanization<br>
accelerator were added to the resulting masterbatch and the<br>
mixture was kneaded with an open roll to obtain a rubber<br>
composition.<br>
For each rubber composition obtained, the physical<br>
properties following vulcanization were measured by the<br>
methods described below.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0056]<br>
Tensile strength<br>
 <br>
Each rubber composition was hot-pressed at 148°C for<br>
45 minutes to prepare a vulcanized sheet with a thickness<br>
of 2 mm, from which a JIS No. 3 dumbbell specimen was<br>
blanked.<br>
The resulting specimen was subjected to a tensile<br>
test according to JIS K6251-2004 at room temperature (23°C)<br>
at a tensile rate of 500 mm/min to measure the tensile<br>
strength.<br>
[0057]<br>
Oil Resistance<br>
Each rubber composition was vulcanized by hot<br>
pressing at 148°C for 45 minutes to prepare a vulcanized<br>
sheet with a thickness of 2 mm, from which a strip specimen<br>
with a width of 20 mm, a length of 50 mm and a thickness of<br>
2 mm was blanked.<br>
The resulting specimen was immersed in a test oil<br>
(IRM903 available from Japan Sun Oil Co., Ltd.) having a<br>
temperature of 80oC for 72 hours according to JIS K6258-<br>
2003 to measure the volume change rate (AV) [%] following<br>
immersion.<br>
The oil resistance is relatively good at a volume<br>
change rate of not more than 100%.<br>
[0058]<br>
Weather Resistance<br>
 <br>
Each rubber composition was press-cured at 148°C for<br>
45 minutes to prepare a vulcanized sheet with a thickness<br>
of 2 mm, from which a strip specimen with a width of 10 mm,<br>
a length of 150 mm and a thickness of 2 mm was blanked.<br>
According to JIS K6259-2004, the specimen was<br>
extended by 20% and exposed to an atmosphere with an ozone<br>
concentration of 100 pphm at 50°C for 168 hours, and the<br>
state of the specimen was visually checked.<br>
The specimen was rated as "good" when there was no<br>
abnormality such as cracking, and "NG" when there was an<br>
abnormality such as cracking.<br>
[0059]<br>
Adhesion Properties<br>
(1) Peel Strength<br>
Each rubber composition obtained was molded into a<br>
sheet with a thickness of 2.5 mm by a laboratory roll and<br>
the sheet was combined with a brass plate for pressure<br>
bonding. Cellophane paper was provided to the portion to<br>
be gripped with a chuck during peeling in order to avoid<br>
adhesion. Then, the combined sheet was press-cured at<br>
148oC for 60 minutes at a surface pressure of 3.0 MPa using<br>
a laboratory pressing machine to obtain a brass/rubber<br>
composite. This composite was allowed to stand at room<br>
temperature for 24 hours and cut into a width of 25 mm to<br>
 <br>
obtain a specimen.<br>
The resulting specimen was subjected to a peel test<br>
between the rubber composition and the brass plate<br>
according to JIS K6256-1999 "90 degree peel test of<br>
vulcanized rubber from metal piece" using a tensile tester<br>
according to JIS K6256 under the condition of a tensile<br>
rate of 50 mm/min to thereby measure the peel strength.<br>
[0060]<br>
(2) Sticking of Rubber<br>
A peel test was made as above to measure the<br>
percentage of rubber remaining stuck to the brass plate of<br>
the specimen following peeling according to JIS K6256-1999.<br>
[0061]<br>
The adhesion is good at a peel strength value of at<br>
least 70 N/25 mm and a percentage of stuck rubber of at<br>
least 70%.<br>

[0067]<br>
As is clear from the results shown in Table 1, the<br>
rubber compositions (in Comparative Examples 1 to 6) in<br>
which the ratio of at least one of NBR, EPDM and SBR was<br>
outside the range of the invention were inferior in any of<br>
oil resistance, weather resistance and adhesion.<br>
The rubber compositions (in Comparative Examples 8<br>
and 9) in which no inorganic filler was included or its<br>
content was outside the range of the invention had poor<br>
adhesion.<br>
The rubber compositions in which the weight ratio of<br>
the plasticizer to the process oil was outside the range of<br>
the invention had poor adhesion.<br>
On the other hand, the rubber compositions in<br>
Examples 1 to 11 were excellent in oil resistance, weather<br>
resistance and adhesion to brass. In addition, the rubber<br>
compositions in Examples 1 to 8 and 10 to 11 also had a<br>
good mechanical strength following vulcanization.<br>
[0068]<br>
 <br>
Examples 12 to 13 and Comparative Example 12<br>
The respective rubber compositions obtained as<br>
described above were used to manufacture high-pressure<br>
hoses.<br>
The rubber composition indicated in the column of<br>
inner rubber layer in Table 2 was extruded onto a mandrel<br>
with an external diameter of 12.5 mm to which a release<br>
agent had been applied in advance to form an inner tube<br>
with a thickness of 2 mm. A brass-plated wire (with a wire<br>
diameter of 0.3 mm) was braided outside the inner tube and<br>
the rubber composition indicated in the column of outside<br>
rubber layer in Table 2 was extruded outside the brass-<br>
plated wire to form an outer rubber layer with a thickness<br>
of 2 mm. Then, these layers were vulcanized by heating at<br>
150°C for 60 minutes, after which the mandrel was pulled<br>
out to obtain a high-pressure hose.<br>
The respective high-pressure hoses obtained were<br>
subjected to the following tests.<br>
The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
[0069]<br>
Hose Impulse Test<br>
The resulting high-pressure hose was subjected to a<br>
hose impulse test in which a pressure of 20.5 MPa was<br>
repeatedly applied at 100oC with a period of 1Hz to thereby<br>
 <br>
evaluate the durability. A hose operating 500,000 times or<br>
more in the hose impulse test was rated as "good" because<br>
of its excellent durability, whereas a hose operating less<br>
than 500,000 times was rated as "NG" because of poor<br>
durability.<br>
[0070]<br>
Oil Resistance Test<br>
Grease was applied to the outer rubber layer of the<br>
hose, which was then allowed to stand in an oven having a<br>
temperature of 100'C for 48 hours. Thereafter, the hose<br>
was rated as "good" when there was no abnormality such as a<br>
slit, "NG" when there was an abnormality such as a slit.<br>
[0071]<br>
Weather Resistance Test<br>
The hose was fixed at a bend radius of 80 mm and<br>
exposed to an atmosphere with an ozone concentration of 100<br>
pphm at 50oC for 168 hours, and the state of the hose was<br>
visually checked. The hose was rated as "good" when there<br>
was no abnormality such as cracking, and "NG" when there<br>
was an abnormality such as cracking.<br>
[0072]<br>
[Table 3]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0073]<br>
As is clear from the results shown in Table 2, the<br>
hose (in Comparative Example 12) in which the rubber<br>
composition (in Comparative Example 4) containing SBR in a<br>
smaller amount than the range of the invention was used for<br>
the inner rubber layer and the outer rubber layer was<br>
excellent in oil resistance and weather resistance but had<br>
low durability.<br>
On the other hand, the hoses (in Examples 12 and 13)<br>
in which the rubber composition of the invention was used<br>
for at least the outer rubber layer were excellent in all<br>
of durability, oil resistance, and weather resistance.<br>
