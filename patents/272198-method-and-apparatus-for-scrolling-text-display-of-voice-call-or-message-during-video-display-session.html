 <br>
1UU36] VV3. b illustrates operation of the communication device 500 in accordance with an embodiment. In 601, the communication device is connected to a network, over, for example, transmit link 513 and receive link 515 via transceiver/s 511. A voice call may be received from the network over the receive link 515 as shown in 603. However, the user may be busy with an application as shown in 605, for example engaged in a multi-media session, and the multi-media client 517 may be providing video, or other information, to the display 521. As shown in 607, the user will be provided with an indication of an incoming message. The indication may be a visual indicator, or may be an audio tone such as a ring-tone. If the user decides to accept an view the message as in 609, the application 501 will take action to obtain message text data as shown in 611. The message text data may be obtained in various ways as is described in fliilher detail herein. The application 501 will provide the text data to display driver 507 as shown in 613. As shown in 615, scrolling text, which represents the message text data, will then be displayed on display 521 along with information displayed from the other application which the user was engaged with, for example, a video application.<br>
[0037] FIG. 7 illustrates further details of block 611 and how message text data may be obtained in the various embodiments. In 701 a given message type is received from the process illustrated in FIG. 6. If the message is not a multi-media message in 703, and if the message is not a voice message or voice call in 705, then the message is handled as a text only message, for example, and IM, SMS, or email message. The apphcation 501 will get the message text as shown in 707, from the appropriate client of clients 527. The application 501 will then provide the text data, over communication link 520, to the display drive 507 to display as scrolling text as shown in 717.<br>
 <br>
[0038] If however the message is a muHi-media message in 703, for example an MMS message, the application 501 will check text/video options as in 709, by, for example, checking a set of stored user option settings in user options 539. Various user settings may be applied in the embodiments, for example, the user may select to receive video only, such as a PiP display, or may choose to receive video and scrolling text corresponding to the video. The scrolling text position may also be settable via the user options 539, and therefore the scrolling text may be displayed as was illustrated previously by FIG. 1 through FIG. 4.<br>
(0039] Therefore in 709, text/video option settings are checked. If a video only option is selected, then the application 501 will send the video to the display drivers for PiP display as in 717. In this case, the user may, if desired, select the PiP display thereby causing the audio portion, if any, to be played along with the video in the PiP display. Otherwise, the video may run silently in the PiP display, while the user receives audio from another currently running application or video.<br>
[0040] If however a video and text option setting is detected in 709, then the application 501 may strip the audio portion from the message as in 711. The stripped audio portion may then be provided to the voice-to-text converter 505 as shown in 713, and added to the display as scrolling text as shown in 715. For PiP display of video, or MMS messages, the scrolling text may be displayed in accordance with any of the examples illustrated by FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, and may be located at any desired position on the display in accordance with user settings stored in user options 539. The application 501 therefore provides a user interface such that a user may select options for storage in user options 539. Default values for the user options 539 may be provided in the embodiments, such that, for example, video and text may be a default display setting for<br>
 <br>
MMS messages or video. Various other default settings may likewise be appropriate for the various embodiments.<br>
[0041] FIG. 8 illustrates operation of the communication device 500 in accordance widi an embodiment. In 801, the communication device is connected to a network, over, for example, transmit link 513 and receive link 515 via transceiver/s 511. A voice call may be received from the network over the receive link 515 as shown in 803. However, the user may be busy with an application as shown in 805, for example engaged in a multi-media session, and the multi-media client 517 may be providing video, or other information, to the display 521. As shown in 807, the user will be provided with an indication of an incoming call. The indication may be a visual indicator, or may be an audio tone such as a ring-tone. If the user decides to accept the call as in 809, the application 501 will establish a live voice call link 508 to protocol stack 509, to receive voice data from the network. The application 501 will however divert the voice data from the audio logic of the communication device 500, and will instead send the voice data to voice-to-text converter logic 505 over communication link 504. The voice-to-text converter logic 505 will therefore convert the audio data to text as shovm in 811, and vAW, via application 501, provide the text data to display driver 507 as shown in 813. As shown in 815, scrolling text, which represents the received voice call, will then be displayed on display 521 along with information displayed from the other application which the user was engaged with, for example, a video application.<br>
|0042] In accordance with the embodiments, the application 501 may also retrieve and display as scrolling text, a voice mail message file. Therefore the user may ignore the call in 803 in which case a voice mail indication may be provided in 807. The user may therefore decide to receive the voice mail message in 809, and application 501 may then command the voice mail<br>
 <br>
retriever logic 503 to obtain the voice mail file either fi-om a remote voice mail server or from memory used for storing voice mail directly on communication device 500. The retrieved voice mail file will then be converted to text in 8II and displayed accordingly.<br>
[0043] This embodiment is further illustrated with respect to FIG. 9. As shown in 901, video media content, or any other information, may be displayed. An audio voice file may be converted to textual data as in 903. The textual data may then be scrolled across the display as in 905, along with the video media content or other information, at the same time. That is, a video application may continue to play video as the text of the voice mail message is scrolled across the display, FIG. 10 illustrates further details of the embodiment. In 1001, video information is received. For example, DVB data may be received fi"om a video digital broadcasting network. In 1003, the video information is displayed on the display 521. In 1005, a voicemail message indication is received, for example, a voicemail message indication fi^om a wireless network. In 1007, the user may provide an acfivation signal via user interfaces 523. For example, the user may press a key on a keypad such that the application 501 may, in response to the user input, convert the voicemail message to scrolling text on the display 521. Alternatively in 1007, the voicemail message indication may be detected by the application 501, where the application 501, in response may automatically retrieve the voicemail message as shown in 1009. In 1011, the voicemail message is converted to text and, in 1013, the text is scrolled across the display 521 as previously described.<br>
[0044| FIG. 11 illustrates operation of the applicafion 501 with respect to a voice call. In 1101, video maybe displayed on display 521. Audio voice data for a voice call may be received by the communicafion device 500 and sent to the application over the live voice call link 508. The application manages diversion of the voice data from an audio logic of the communication<br>
 <br>
device 500, and may send the voice data to voice-to-text converter logic 505 as shown in 1103. In 1105, the textual data is scrolled on the display 521 along with the video.<br>
[0045] FIG. 12 illustrates operation of the communication device 500 and application 501 with respect to activation. For example, in 1201, the application 501 may receive a user activation signal from user interfaces 523. The user activation signal may be in response to an incoming voice call, or may be in response to a voice mail indication received from a network. Alternatively, the application 501 may provide configurable user settings stored in user options 539. For example, the user may set an option of user options 539 such that, when a video application is running, any incoming calls are automatically directed to the application 501. In another example, the user may set an option such that, when a voice mail indication is received, the corresponding voice mail message file is automatically retrieved by the application 501. Various other user configurations may be used in accordance with the embodiments.<br>
[0046] In 1203, the display 521 may be split into a video portion and a text scrolling portion as was described with respect to FIG. 1 through FIG. 4. As shown in FIG. 2 for example, the text may be scrolled over the video in some embodiments. The application 501 may also provide user configurable settings, stored in user options 539, for configuring the position of the scrolling text with respect to the display 521. For example, the user may set an option such that text is scrolled across the middle of the display 521, or at the top or bottom of the display 521. Other user options may also be provided, such as, but not limited to, color and size of the scrolling text. Therefore, in 1205, the scrolling text is displayed in accordance with the user options 539, or with default settings.<br>
 <br>
[0047] FIG. 13 illustrates an example embodiment corresponding to a display configuration as was shown and described by FIG. 1, and FIG. 3 for PiP displays. In 1301, a video may be displayed and, in 1303, audio data, or an audio file, may be converted to text. In 1305, the application 501, in conjunction with display driver 507, may cause the display to be partitioned into, for example, a video portion 101 and a text portion 103, as illustrated in FIG. 1. The text data is converted to video format by the display driver 507, as shovra in 1307, and displayed as scroUing text in the text portion 103, as shown in 1309.<br>
[0048] FIG. 14 and FIG. 15 are signal flow diagrams providing further details of operation of the communication device 500. In FIG. 14, a signal flow diagram 1400 illustrates handling of a voice call by application 501. For example, a network 1402 may send a voice call indication, or paging message, 1405 to the communication device 500. Because of a user setting as discussed above, or because the user is operating an apphcation using the display 521, the application 501 receives the voice call indication 1405, The user may accept the voice call via 1407. This may require a user input via the user interfaces 523, or may be based on a user configuration setting. The application 501 may then receive voice data 1409 from the network 1402. If the user continues to run an application 1411, such as a video or other application such as a gaming apphcation, the application 501 will send voice bits 1413 to voice-to-text converter logic 505. The application 501 will receive the text bits 1415, which correspond to the converted audio, and will send the text bits and overlay details 1417 to the display 1401.<br>
[0049] FIG. 15 is a signal flow diagram 1500 illustrating handling of a voice mail message by application 501. Although, in accordance with the embodiments, a voice mail message may be processed by the application 501 at any time, the call process is illustrated for completeness. For example, a voice call indication 1505 may be received by the application 501 similar to the case<br>
 <br>
illustrated by FIG. 14. However, the user may ignore the voice call 1507. In this case the network 1502 will redirect the caller to voice mail via voice mail redirect 1509. If the caller deposits a voice mail message with voice mail server 1503, the network 1502 will send a voice mail message indication 15U to the application 501. If an application 1513 is running and using the display 1501, the application 501 may get the voice file 1515 via voice mail retriever logic 503. The voice mail retriever logic 503 will communication via messages 1517 and 1519 with the voice mail server 1503 via network 1502, and will obtain the voice file 1521.<br>
[0050] The application 501 will provide the voice file 1523 to the voice-to-text converter logic 505, and will receive back text bits 1525, corresponding to the voice file. The application 501 will then provide the text bits and overlay details 1527 to the display 1501.<br>
[0051] Therefore, methods and apparatuses for displaying scrolling text, wherein the scrolling text represents a voice mail message, or audio of an MMS message or a video, and wherein the scrolling text is displayed along with video broadcast data, or along with video or application data displayed on a display from a video file simultaneously. Various advantages of the herein disclosed embodiments will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
