				<td>Isoalkane mixture, its preparation and use<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to an isoalkane mixture, to a method for its preparation and to cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions which comprise such a mixture.<br>
Hydrocart&gt;on mixtures which comprise short-chain olefins, e.g. having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, are obtainable on a large industrial scale. Thus, for example, the processing of petroleum by steam cracking or fluidized catalyst cracking (FCC) gives rise to a hydrocarbon mixture referred to as a C4 cut and which has a high total olefin content, the olefins essentially being olefins having 4 carl&gt;on atoms. Such C4cuts, i.e. mixtures of isomeric butenes and butanes, are very well suited, if appropriate following prior removal of the isobutene and hydrogenation of the butadiene present, to the preparation of oligomers, in particular of octenes and dodecenes.<br>
The essentially linear oligomer mixtures obtainable from olefin mixtures containing predominantly linear starting olefins have acquired great importance. They are suitable, for example, as diesel fuel component, and as intermediates in the preparation of functionalized, predominantly linear hydrocarbons. Thus, hydroformylation and subsequent hydrogenation of the olefin oligomers gives the corresponding alcohols, which are used, inter alia, as starting materials for detergents and as plasticizers. For many fields of use, e.g. as plasticizer alcohols, the degree of branching of the olefins plays a decisive role. The degree of branching is described here, for example, by the ISO index, which specifies the average number of methyl branches in the particular olefin fraction. Thus, in a Cs fraction, for example, the contribution to the ISO index of the fraction by the n-octenes, methylheptenes and dimethylhexenes is 0,1 and 2, respectively. The lower the ISO index, the greater the linearity of the molecules in the particular fraction.<br>
It is known to use catalysts which comprise metals and predominantly nickel as active component for the preparation of slightly branched, likewise olefinically unsaturated oligomers from lower olefins. Heterogeneous catalysts here have the advantage over homogeneous ones that separating off the catalyst from the reaction product is dispensed with. Thus, for example, DE-A-43 39 713 (= WO 95/14647) discloses a method for the oligomerization of unbranched C2-C6-olefins over a fixed-bed catalyst at increased pressure and elevated temperature, where the catalyst comprises, as essential active constituents, 10 to 70% by weight of nickel oxide, 5 to 30% by weight of titanium dioxide and/or zirconium dioxide, 0 to 20% by weight of aluminum oxide, and silicon oxide as the remainder. Further oligomerization catalysts and methods are<br><br>
described, for example, in WO 99/25668, WO 00/59849, WO 00/53546. WO 01/72670 and EP-A-1 457 475.<br>
A. Ansaldi describes, in Cosmetics and Toiletries Manufacture Woridwide, pp. 128 -133, highly branched isoparafTins which are sold commercially by Presperse Inc. under the name Permethyl.<br>
Besides water, so-called oil bodies belong to the most important raw materials for the formulation of cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions. A broad diversity of hydrophobic components are used both as base materials and auxiliaries, and also as active ingredients. These components include, quite generally, natural fats and oils, petroleum products, such as paraffins, silicone oils, fatty alcohols, fatty acids, etc. The provision of products with a complex profile of properties often presents difficulties. Thus, there is a requirement for oil bodies for cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions which, for example, have very good dermatological compatibility, impart a pleasant feel to the hair and the skin, have a good conditioning effect (e.g. are able to improve the feel to the touch, shine and appearance, dry and wet combability, etc.), are compatible with a large number of other active ingredients and auxiliaries and permit adjustment of the rheological properties of the compositions in a wide range (e.g. from liquid to gel-like). Additionally, many consumers increasingly desire products which have only a discreet odor or are completely free from perfume substances.<br>
DE 10 2004 018 753 A1 describes a method for the preparation of a Cie-alkane mixture in which a butene-containing C4-hydrocarbon stream is oligomerized in the presence of a nickel-containing catalyst, then the Ci6-olefin fraction is separated off and the separated-off Ci6-fraction is hydrogenated. Also described are Cig-alkane mixtures which have a fraction of Cie-alkanes of ^ 95% by mass, and their use. A use in cosmetics is also mentioned here quite generally, without information regarding formulation or support by a working example.<br>
DE-OS 2360306 describes an oil for cosmetic purposes which is obtainable by:<br>
1.	polymerization of isobutene or an isobutene-containing C4-olefin mixture in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst,<br>
2.	distillation,<br>
3.	hydrogenation and<br>
4.	steam distillation for deodorization.<br>
WO 2004/091555 describes a cosmetic composition which comprises at least one branched o-olefin or a hydrogenation product thereof. Here, the a-olefin has at least<br><br>
one C2- or longer-chain alkyl branch and is obtainable by oligomerization of certain linear or branched a -olefins in the presence of an acidic catalyst. A disadvantage of these products is their high degree of branching, their content of tert-butyl groups and their nonuniformity, meaning that the profile of properties achieved therewith is still in need of improvement for use in cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations. Thus, the oligomers used, for example, have a marked intrinsic odor reminiscent of terpenes.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide saturated hydrocarbons which are suitable in an advantageous manner as oil bodies for cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions. In particular, they should be suitable for the preparation of products which essentially have no intrinsic odor attributable to the oil body.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that this object is achieved by an isoalkane mixture with an average degree of branching.<br>
The invention therefore provides an isoalkane mixture whose ^H NMR spectrum in the region of a chemical shift 5 of from 0.6 to 1.0 ppm, based on tetramethylsilane, has a surface integral of from 25 to 70%, based on the total integral surface.<br>
Preference is given to isoalkane mixtures whose ^H NMR spectrum in the region of a chemical shift 5 of from 0.6 to 1.0 ppm, has a surface Integral of from 30 to 60%, preferably from 35 to 55%, based on the total integral surface.<br>
Preferably, the isoalkane mixtures according to the invention have no olefinic double bonds. Suitable Isoalkane mixtures have, in the ^H NMR spectrum in the region of a chemical shift 5 of from 4 to 6 ppm, no signals which are attributable to olefin protons.<br>
Furthermore, the isoalkane mixture preferably has, in the ^H NMR spectrum in the region of a chemical shift 6 of from 0.5 to 3 ppm (i.e. In the region of the aliphatic protons), a surface integral of up to 95%, partlculariy preferably of up to 98%, based on the total integral surface.<br>
The isoalkane mixtures according to the Invention essentially have no tert-butyl groups (-C(CH3)3). The fraction of terminal tert-butyl groups is preferably at most 20%, particularly preferably at most 10%, in particular at most 5% and specifically at most 2%.<br>
Preferably, the Isoalkanes according to the invention have a uniform structure. Thus, based on the longest continuous carbon chain, they had essentially or exclusively methyl branches. The fraction of side chains with alkyl groups which have 2 or more<br><br>
than two carbon atoms is less than 20%, preferably at most 10%, particularly preferably at most 5%, in particular at most 1%, based on the total number of branching sites.<br>
Preferably, the isoalkane mixtures comprise at least 70% by weight, preferably at least 85% by weight, in particular at least 95% by weight, of alkanes having 8 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferably, the isoalkane mixtures comprise at least 70% by weight, preferably at least 80% by weight, in particular at least 90% by weight (such as, for example, at least 94% by weight), of alkanes having 12 to 20 cart&gt;on atoms.<br>
The alkane mixture according to the invention preferably comprises at least 70% by weight, preferably at least 85% by weight, in particular at least 95% by weight, of alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms. A specific embodiment is an isoalkane mixture which consists essentially of alkanes having 8 or 12 or 16 carbon atoms.<br>
The isoalkane mixtures according to the invention (and obtainable by the method descrit&gt;ed t&gt;elow) preferably have an oligomeric distribution, i.e. nonuniformity with regard to the number of carbon atoms (and thus the molecular weight) of the alkanes present. Preferably, the isoalkane mixtures according to the invention comprise, based on their total weight, less than 95% by weight, particularly preferably at most 90% by weight, of alkanes of the same molecular weight. Such nonuniform isoalkane mixtures can have particulariy advantageous application properties, specifically for use in cosmetic compositions. These include, specifically, the rheological properties of the isoalkane mixtures according to the invention, such as the spreading behavior. Thus, the relative spreading values of the isoalkane mixtures according to the invention (based on Paraffinum periiquidum as standard) are at least 130%, particularly preferably at least 140%, in particular at least 150%. They thus surpass the oil bodies used customarily from the prior art and in particular tsohexadecane (Ci6-isoalkane, and mixtures with very high Cie-isoalkane content, e.g. according to DE 10 2004 018 753). The isoalkane mixtures according to the invention and obtainable by the method according to the invention preferably have a viscosity, determined in accordance with Brookfield, in the range from 2 to 10 mPas, particularly preferably in the range from 4 to 8 mPas. The kinematic viscosity is preferably in the range from 5 to 25 cSt, particulariy preferably in the range from 10 to 20 cSt.<br>
In addition, the isoalkane mixtures according to the invention are particularly advantageously suitable for the preparation of stable emulsions, in particular stable cosmetic emulsions.<br><br>
The isoalkane mixtures according to the invention and obtainable by the method according to the invention preferably have a density in the range from 0.7 to 0.82 g/cm^, particularly preferably in the range from 0.75 to 0.8 g/cm^.<br>
The isoalkane mixtures according to the invention and obtainable by the method according to the invention preferably have a refractive index in the range from 1.4 to 1.5.<br>
The isoalkane mixtures according to the invention preferably have a degree of branching B in the range from 0.1 to 0.35, particularly preferably 0.12 to 0,3, in particular 0.15 to 0.27 and specifically 0.17 to 0.23.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the degree of branching B is independent of molecular weight and defined as the number of branches per carbon atom (B = number of branches/number of carbon atoms, e.g. n-octane: 0/8 = 0, methylheptane: 1/8 = 0.125, dimethylhexane: 2/8 = 0.25, squalane: 6/30 = 0.2.<br>
The isoalkane mixtures according to the invention are preferably not pure substances and/or natural products. In particular, the isoalkane mixtures according to the invention do not consist of squalane (2,6,10,15,ig,23-hexamethyttetracosane) and in particular do not comprise it either. However, the isoalkane mixtures according to the Invention are suitable in an advantageous way as substitute for squalane. Squalane is a high-value native oil which is obtained, for example, from shark liver. Being a natural product, it is available only in restricted amounts and, for reasons of species protection, there is a great need for a suitable replacement. Although the isoalkane mixtures according to the invention, on the evidence of their ^H NMR spectrum, differ significantly in structural terms from squalane, they have a similar degree of branching and are suitable in an advantageous way as replacement.<br>
Suitable isoalkane mixtures are obtainable by a method in which<br>
a)	a hydrocarbon feed material is provided which comprises at least one olefin having 2 to 6 carbon atoms,<br>
b)	the hydrocarbon feed material is subjected to an oligomerization over a transition-metal-containing catalyst,<br>
c)	the oligomerization product obtained in step b) is completely hydrogenated.<br>
This method is likewise provided by the invention.<br><br>
step a)<br>
Suitable olefin feed materials for step a) are in principle all compounds which comprise 2 to 6 carison atoms and at least one ethylenlcalty unsaturated double bond.<br>
Preferably, in step a), an industrially available olefin-containing hydrocarbon mixture is used.<br>
Preferred industrially available olefin mixtures result from the hydrocarbon cleavage during petroleum processing, for example by catalytic cracking, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), thermocracking or hydrocracking with subsequent dehydrogenation. A preferred industrial olefin mixture is the C4 cut. C4cuts are obtainable, for example, by fluid catalytic cracking or steam cracking of gas oil or by steam cracking of naphtha. Depending on the composition of the C4 cut, a distinction is made between the whole C4 cut (crude C4 cut), so-called raffinate I obtained after separating off 1,3-butadiene, and raffinate II obtained after separating off isobutene. A further suitable industrial olefin mixture is the C5 cut obtainable during the cleavage of naphtha. Olefin-containing hydrocarbon mixtures having 4 to 6 carbon atoms suitable for use in step a) can also be obtained by catalytic dehydrogenation of suitable industrially available paraffin mixtures. Thus, the preparation of C4-olefin mixtures is possible, for example, from liquid gases (liquefied petroleum gas, LPG) and liquefiable natural gases (liquefied natural gas, LNG). Besides the LPG fraction, the latter also additionally comprise relatively large amounts of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons (light naphtha) and are thus also suitable for the preparation of C5- and Cg-olefin mixtures. The preparation of olefin-containing hydrocarbon mixtures which comprise monoolefins having 4 to 6 carbon atoms from LPG or LNG streams is possible by customary methods known to the person skilled in the art which, t)esides dehydrogenation, usually also comprise one or more work-up steps. These include, for example, separating off at least some of the saturated hydrocarbons present in the at&gt;ovementioned olefin feed mixtures. These can be reused, for example, for the preparation of olefin feed materials by cracking and/or dehydrogenation. The olefins used in step a), however, may also comprise a fraction of saturated hydrocart)ons which behave inertly toward the oligomerization conditions. The fraction of these saturated components is generally at most 60% by weight, preferably at most 40% by weight, particularly preferably at most 20% by weight, based on the total amount of the olefins and saturated hydrocarbons present in the hydrocarbon feed material.<br>
Preferably, in step a), a hydrocarbon mixture is provided which comprises 20 to 100% by weight of C4-olefins, 0 to 80% by weight of Cg-olefins, 0 to 60% by weight of<br><br>
Ce-oleftns and 0 to 10% by weight of olefins different from the abovementioned olefins, in each case based on the total olefin content.<br>
Preferably, in step a), a hydrocarbon mixture is provided which has a content of linear monoolefins of at least 80% by weight, particulariy preferably at least 90% by weight and in particular at least 95% by weight, based on the total olefin content. Here, the linear monoolefins are selected from 1-butene, 2-butene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene and mixtures thereof. To establish the desired degree of branching of the isoalkane mixture, it may be advantageous if the hydrocart&gt;on mixture used in step a) comprises up to 20% by weight, preferably up to 5% by weight, in particular up to 3% by weight, of branched olefins, based on the total olefin content.<br>
In step a), a C4-hydrocarbon mixture is particularly preferably provided.<br>
The butene content, based on 1-butene, 2-butene and isobutene, of the C4-hydrocarbon mixture provided in step a) is preferably 10 to 100% by weight, particularly preferably 50 to 99% by weight, and in particular 70 to 95% by weight, based on the total olefin content. Preferably, the ratio of 1-butene to 2-butene is in a range from 20 : 1 to 1 : 2, in particular about 10 : 1 to 1 :1. Preferably, the C4-hydrocarbon mixture used in step a) comprises less than 5% by weight, in particular less than 3% by weight, of isobutene.<br>
The provision of the olefin-containing hydrocarbons in step a) can comprise separating off branched olefins. Of suitability are customary separation methods known from the prior art which are based on differing physical properties of linear and branched olefins or on differing reactivities, which permit selective reactions. Thus, for example, isobutene can be separated off from C4-olefin mixtures, such as raffinate I, by one of the following methods:<br>
Molecular sieve separation,<br>
fractional distillation,<br>
reversible hydration to tert-butanol,<br>
acid-catalyzed alcohol addition onto a tertiary ether, e.g. methanol addition to methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE),<br>
irreversible catalyzed oligomerization to di- and triisobutene,<br>
irreversible polymerization to poly isobutene.<br><br>
Such methods are described in K. Weissermel, H.-J. Arpe, Industrielle organische Chemie [Industrial Organic Chemistry], 4th edition, pp. 76 - 81, VCH-Veriagsgesellschaft Weinheim, 1994, to which reference is hereby made in its entirety.<br>
Preferably, in step a), a rafTinate II is provided.<br>
A raffinate II suitable for use in the method according to the invention has, for example, the following composition:<br>
0.5 to 5% by weight of isobutane, 5 to 20% by weight of n-butane, 20 to 40% by weight of trans-2-butene, 10 to 20% by weight of cis-2-butene, 25 to 55% by weight of 1-butene, 0.5 to 5% by weight of isobutene<br>
and traces of gases, such as 1,3-butadiene, propene, propane, cyclopropane, propadiene, methylcyclopropane, vinylacetylene, pentenes, pentanes etc. in the region of in each case at most 1 % by weight.<br>
A suitable rafTinate II has the following typical composition:<br>
ISO-, n-butane	26% by weight<br>
isobutene	1 % by weight<br>
1 -butene	26% by weight<br>
trans-2-butene	31 % by weight<br>
cis-2-butene	16% by weight<br>
If diolefins or alkynes are present in the olefin-rich hydrocarbon mixture, then these can be removed from same to preferably less than 10 ppm by weight prior to the oligomerization. They are preferably removed by selective hydrogenation, e.g. as in EP-81 041 and DE-15 68 542, particularly preferably by a selective hydrogenation to a residual content of below 5 ppm by weight, in particular 1 ppm by weight.<br>
Expediently, oxygen-containing compounds, such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones or ethers, are furthermore largely removed from the olefin-rich hydrocarbon mixture. For this, the olefin-rich hydrocarbon mixture can advantageously be passed over an adsorbent, such as, for example, a molecular sieve, in particular one with a pore diameter of &gt; 4 A to 5 A. The concentration of oxygen-containing, sulfur-containing.<br><br>
nitrogen-containing and halogen-containing compounds in the olefin-rich hydrocarbon mixture is preferably less than 1 ppm by weight, in particular less than 0.5 ppm by weight.<br>
Step b)<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "oligomers" comprises dimers, trimers, tetramers and higher products from the synthesis reaction of the olefins used. Preferably, the oligomers obtained in step b) are selected from dimers, trimers and tetramers. The oligomers are for their part olefinically unsaturated. The desired isoalkanes can be obtained through appropriate choice of the hydrocarbon feed material and the oiigomenzation catalyst used for the oiigomenzation, as descrit&gt;ed below.<br>
For the oiigomenzation in step b), a reaction system can be used which comprises one or more, identical or different reactors. In the simplest case, a single reactor is used for the oligomerization in step b). However, it is also possible to use a plurality of reactors which in each case have identical or different mixing characteristics. The individual reactors can, if desired, be divided one or more times by intemals. If two or more reactors form the reaction system, then these can be connected with one another as desired, e.g. in parallel or in series. In one suitable embodiment, for example, a reaction system is used which consists of two reactors connected in series.<br>
Suitable pressure-resistant reaction apparatuses for the oligomerization are known to the person skilled in the art. These include the generally customary reactors for gas-solid and gas-liquid reactions, such as, for example, tubular reactors, stirred-tank reactors, gas circulation reactors, bubble columns etc., which may, if appropriate, be divided by intemals. Preferably, tube-bundle reactors or shaft furnaces are used. If, for the oligomerization, a heterogeneous catalyst is used, then this can be arranged in a single or in a plurality of catalyst fixed beds. In this connection, it is possible to use different catalysts in different reaction zones. However, preference is given to using the same catalyst in all reaction zones.<br>
The temperature during the oligomerization reaction is generally in a range from about 20 to 280°C, preferably from 25 to 200°C, in particular from 30 to 140*'C. The pressure during the oligomerization is generally in a range from about 1 to 300 bar, preferably from 5 to 100 bar and in particular from 20 to 70 bar. If the reaction system comprises more than one reactor, then these may have identical or different temperatures and identical or different pressures. Thus, for example, in the second reactor of a reactor<br><br>
cascade, a higher temperature and/or a higher pressure than in the first reactor can be set, e.g. in order to achieve as complete a conversion as possible.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the temperature and pressure values used for the oligomerization are selected so that the olefin-containing feed material is in the form of a liquid or is present in the supercritical state.<br>
The reaction in step b) is preferably carried out adiabatically. For the purposes of the present invention, this term is to be understood in the industrial sense and not in the physicochemical sense. Thus, the oligomerization reaction generally proceeds exothermally, meaning that the reaction mixture, upon flowing through the reaction system, for example a catalyst bed, experiences a temperature increase. Under adiabatic reaction control is understood as meaning a procedure in which the amount of heat liberated in an exothermic reaction is absort)ed by the reaction mixture in the reactor and no cooling by cooling devices is applied. The heat of the reaction is thus dissipated with the reaction mixture from the reactor, apart from a residual amount which is released through natural thermal conduction and thermal radiation from the reactor to the surroundings.<br>
For the oligomerization in step b), a catalyst containing transition metal is used. These are preferably heterogeneous catalysts. Preferred catalysts which known a low oligomer branching nickel-comprising catalysts for the reaction in step a), which as are known bring about low oligomer branching, are generally known to the person skilled in the art. These include the catalysts described in Catalysis Today, 6, 329 (1990), in particular pages 336-338, and the catalysts described in DE-A-43 39 713 (= WO-A 95/14647) and DE-A-199 57 173, to which reference is hereby expressly made. A suitable oligomerization process in which the feed stream used for the oligomerization is divided and passed to at least two reaction zones operated at different temperatures is described in EP-A-1 457 475, to which reference is likewise made.<br>
The heterogeneous nickel-comprising catalysts used can have different structures. In principle, unsupported catalysts and also supported catalysts are suitable. The latter are preferably used. The carrier materials may be, for example, silica, clay earth, aluminosilicates, aluminosilicates with layer structures and zeolites, such as mordenite, faujasite, zeolite X, zeolite Y and ZSM-5, zirconium oxide, which is treated with acids, or sulfated titanium dioxide. Of particular suitability are precipitation catalysts which are obtainable by mixing aqueous solutions of nickel salts and silicates, e.g. sodium silicate with nickel nitrate, and, if appropriate, aluminum salts, such as aluminum nitrate, and calcination. It is also possible to use catalysts which are obtained through intercalation<br><br>
of Ni^*" ions by bn exchange into natural or synthetic sheet silicates, such as montmorillonrtes. Suitable catalysts can also be obtained by impregnation of silica, clay earth or alumosilicates with aqueous solutions of soluble nickel salts, such as nickel nitrate, nickel sulfate or nickel chloride, and subsequent calcination. Catalysts comprising nickel oxide are preferred. Particular preference is given to catalysts which consist essentially of NiO, Si02, Ti02 and/or Zr02. and, if appropriate, AI2O3. Most preference is given to a catalyst which comprises, as essential active constituents, 10 to 70% by weight of nickel oxide, 5 to 30% by weight of titanium dioxide and/or zirconium dioxide, 0 to 20% by weight of aluminum oxide and, as the remainder, silicon dioxide. Such a catalyst is obtainable by precipitation of the catalyst mass at pH 5 to 9 by adding an aqueous solution comprising nickel nitrate to give an alkali waterglass solution which comprises titanium dioxide and/or zirconium dioxide, filtration, drying and heat-treatment at 350 to 650°C. For the preparation of these catalysts, reference is made specifically to DE-43 39 713. Reference is made to the disclosure of this specification and the prior art cited therein in their entirety.<br>
In a further embodiment, the catalyst used in step b) is a nickel catalyst as in DE-A-199 57 173. This is essentially aluminum oxide which has been supplied with a nickel compound and a sulfur compound. Preferably, a molar ratio of sulfur to nickel in the range from 0.25 :1 to 0.38 :1 is present in the finished catalyst.<br>
The catalyst is preferably in piece form, e.g. in the form of tablets, e.g. having a diameter of from 2 to 6 mm and a height of from 3 to 5 mm, rings with, for example, an outer diameter of from 5 to 7 mm, a height of from 2 to 5 mm and a hole diameter from 2 to 3 mm, or strands of varying length with a diameter of, for example, 1.5 to 5 mm. Such forms are obtained in a manner known per se by tableting or extrusion, mostly using a tableting auxiliary, such as graphite or stearic acid.<br>
Step c)<br>
In step c), the hydrogenation catalysts which can be used are usually all catalysts of the prior art which catalyze the hydrogenation of olefins to the corresponding alkanes. The catalysts can be used either in heterogeneous phase or as homogeneous catalysts. Preferably, the hydrogenation catalysts comprise at least one metal of group VIII.<br>
Particularly suitable metals of group VIM are chosen from ruthenium, cobalt, rhodium, nickel, palladium and platinum.<br><br>
The metals can also be used as mixtures. Furthermore, besides the metals of group VIII, the catalysts can also comprise small amounts of further metals, for example metals of group Vila, in particular rhenium, or metals of group lb, i.e. copper, silver or gold. Particularly preferred metals of group VIM are ruthenium, nickel, palladium and platinum, in particular platinum, nickel and palladium, and more preferably palladium and nickel. Specifically, the catalyst comprises palladium as catalytically active species. If a heterogeneous catalyst is used, then this is suitably in finely divided form. The finely divided form is achieved, for example, as follows:<br>
Black catalyst: the metal is reductively deposited from the solution of one of its salts shortly prior to use as catalyst.<br>
Adams catalyst: the metal oxides, in particular the oxides of platinum and palladium, are reduced in situ by the hydrogen used for the hydrogenation.<br>
Skeleton or Raney catalyst: the catalyst is prepared as "metal sponge" from a binary alloy of the metal (in particular nickel or cobalt) with aluminum or silicon by leaching out one partner with acid or alkali. Remains of the original alloy partner often have a synergistic effect.<br>
Supported catalyst: black catalysts can also be precipitated on the surface of a support substance. Suitable supports and support materials are descrit&gt;ed below.<br>
Such heterogeneous catalysts are described in general form, for example, in Organikum, 17th edition, VEB Deutscher Veriag der Wissenschaften, Beriin, 1988, p. 288. Furthermore, heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts which are suitable for the reduction of olefins to alkanes are descrit&gt;ed in more detail in the following specifications:<br>
US 3,597,489, US 2,898,387 and GB 799,396 describe the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane over nickel and platinum catalysts in the gas or liquid phase. GB 1,155,539 describes the use of a nickel catalyst doped with rhenium for the hydrogenation of benzene. US 3,202,723 describes the hydrogenation of benzene with Raney nickel. Ruthenium-containing suspension catalysts which are doped with palladium, platinum or rhodium are used in SU 319582 for the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane. Aluminum oxide-supported catalysts are described in US 3,917,540 and US 3,244,644. Reference is made to the hydrogenation catalysts described in these specifications in their entirety.<br><br>
Depending on the version of the hydrogenation method, the support material can have various forms. If the hydrogenation is carried out in the liquid-phase procedure, then the support material is generally used in the form of a finely divided powder. By contrast, if the catalyst is used in the form of a fixed-bed catalyst, then moldings, for example, are used as support material. Such moldings can be in the form of spheres, tablets, cylinders, hollow cylinders, Raschig rings, strands, saddle packings, stars, spirals, etc. with a size (measurement of the longest expanse) of from about 1 to 30 mm. Furthermore, the supports can be in the form of monoliths, as are described, for example, in DE-A-19642770. Furthermore, the supports can be used in the form of wires, sheets, grids, meshes, fabrics and the like.<br>
The supports can consist of metallic or nonmetallic, porous or nonporous material.<br>
Suitable metallic materials are, for example, high-alloy stainless steels. Suitable nonmetallic materials are, for example, mineral materials, e.g. natural and synthetic minerals, glasses or ceramics, plastics, e.g. synthetic or natural polymers, or a combination of the two.<br>
Preferred support materials are carbon, in particular activated carbon, silicon dioxide, in particular amorphous silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, and furthermore the sulfates and carbonates of the alkaline earth metals, calcium carbonate, calcium sul^te, magnesium carbonate, magnesium sulfate, barium carbonate and barium sulfate.<br>
The catalyst can be applied to the support by customary methods, e.g. by impregnation, wetting or spraying the support with a solution which comprises the catalyst or a suitable precursor thereof.<br>
Suitable supports and methods of applying the catalyst to these are described, for example, in DE-A-10128242, to which reference is hereby made in its entirety.<br>
Homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts can also be used in the method according to the invention. Examples thereof are the nickel catalysts which are described in EP-A-0668257. A disadvantage of using homogeneous catalysts, however, is their production costs and also the fact that they cannot usually be regenerated.<br>
Therefore, in the method according to the invention, heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts are preferably used.<br>
The heterogeneous catalysts used in the method according to the invention particulariy preferably comprise at least one metal from subgroup VIII which is selected from<br><br>
ruthenium, nickel, cobalt, palladium and platinum, and which is, if appropriate, doped with a further transition metal, in particular with one from subgroup Vila, lb or lid and in particular with rhenium.<br>
The metal is particularly preferably used in supported form or as metal sponge. Examples of supported catalysts are, in particular, palladium, nickel or ruthenium on carbon, in particular activated carbon, silicon dioxide, in particular on amorphous silicon dioxide, barium carbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate or aluminum oxide, where the supports may be present in the forms described above. Preferred support forms are the moldings described above.<br>
The metallic catalysts can also be used in the form of their oxides, in particular palladium oxide, platinum oxide or nickel oxide, which are then reduced to the corresponding metals under the hydrogenation conditions.<br>
As metal sponge, Raney nickel in particular is used.<br>
Specifically, use is made in the method according to the invention of palladium on support materials, such as activated carbon, as hydrogenation catalyst.<br>
The amount of catalyst to be used depends inter alia on the particular catalytically active metal and on its use form and can be determined in a particular case by the person skilled in the art. Thus, for example, a nickel- or cobalt-containing hydrogenation catalyst is used in an amount of preferably from 0.5 to 70% by weight, particularly preferably from 1 to 20% by weight and in particular from 2 to 10% by weight, based on the weight of the oligomerization product to be hydrogenated. The stated amount of catalyst refers here to the amount of active metal, i.e. to the catalytically effective component of the catalyst. When using precious metal catalysts which comprise, for example, platinum or palladium, the values are about a factor of 10 smaller.<br>
The hydrogenation takes place at a temperature of from preferably 20 to 250°C, particularly preferably from 50 to 240X and in particular from 150 to 220**C.<br>
The reaction pressure of the hydrogenation reaction is preferably in the range from 1 to 300 bar, particularly preferably from 50 to 250 bar and in particular from 150 to 230 bar.<br>
Both reaction pressure and reaction temperature depend, inter alia, on the activity and amount of the hydrogenation catalyst used and can be determined in a particular case by the person skilled in the art.<br><br>
If desired, the oligomerization product can t&gt;e hydrogenated several times ("after hydrogenated") to achieve as complete a hydrogenation as possible. In this connection, as soon as hydrogen consumption can no longer be established, further hydrogen is injected. Preferably, before injecting hydrogen, fresh catalyst is firstly added.<br>
The hydrogenation can in a suitable solvent or preferably without a diluent preferably. Suitable solvents are those which are inert under the reaction conditions, i.e. neither react with the starting material or product, nor are themselves changed, and which can be separated off from the resulting isoalkanes without problems. Suitable solvents include open-chain and cyclic ethers, such as diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxane and alcohols, in particular Ci-C3-alkanols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol or isopropanol. Also suitable are mixtures of the abovementioned solvents.<br>
The hydrogen required for the hydrogenation can be used either in pure form or in the form of hydrogen-containing gas mixtures. However, the latter must comprise no harmful amounts of catalyst poisons, such as CO. Examples of suitable hydrogen-containing gas mixtures are those from the reforming process. However, preference is given to using hydrogen in pure form.<br>
The hydrogenation can be configured either continuously or discontinuously.<br>
The hydrogenation is usually carried out such that the oligomerization product, if appropriate in a solvent, is initially introduced. This reaction solution is then preferably firstly admixed with the hydrogenation catalyst before the introduction of hydrogen starts. Depending on the hydrogenation catalyst used, the hydrogenation takes place at elevated temperature and/or at increased pressure. For carrying out the reaction under pressure, the customary pressurized vessels known from the prior art, such as autoclaves, stirred autoclaves and pressurized reactors, can be used. If a superatmospheric hydrogen pressure is not used, then the customary reaction devices of the prior art which are suitable for atmospheric pressure are contemplated. Examples thereof are customary stirred vessels, which are preferably equipped with evaporative cooling, suitable mixers, feed devices, if appropriate heat exchanger elements and inertization devices. If the reaction is carried out continuously, the hydrogenation can be carried out under atmospheric pressure in reaction vessels, tubular reactors, fixed-bed reactors and the like customary for this purpose.<br>
When the hydrogenation is complete, the catalyst and the solvent are usually removed. The heterogeneous catalyst is preferably separated off by filtration or by sedimentation<br><br>
and renrK)val of the upper, product-containing phase. Other separation methods for removing solids from solutions, such as, for example, centrifugation, are also suitable for removing the heterogeneous catalyst. Homogeneous catalysts are removed by customary methods for the separation of equiphasal mixtures, for example by chromatographic methods. If appropriate, it may be necessary, depending on the type of catalyst, to deactivate it prior to the removal. This can be carried out by customary methods, for example by washing the reaction solution with protic solvents, e.g. with water or with CrCs-alkanols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol or isopropanol, which are, if required, rendered basic or acidic.<br>
The solvent is removed by customary methods, for example by distillation, in particular under reduced pressure.<br>
In a specific embodiment of the method according to the invention, the oligomerization product obtained in step b) and/or the hydrogenation product obtained in step c) are/is subjected to a separation. Here, at least one fraction enriched in one specific oligomer, or hydrogenated oligomers, is obtained. Thus, for example, a C4-hydrocart&gt;on mixture can in step b) be subjected to an oligomerization and then, before the hydrogenation, be subjected to a separation, where at least one fraction enriched in Cs-, C12- or Ci6-oligomers is obtained. This (these) oligomer-enriched fraction(s) is/are then used for the hydrogenation. It is equally possible for an oligomer mixture from step b) to firstly be hydrogenated without separation and then for the product mixture of hydrogenation to be subjected to separation, where, for example when using a C4 hydrocarbon mixture for the oligomerization, at least one fraction enriched in Cs-, C12-or C^e-isoalkanes is obtained. The fractions enriched in one of the abovementioned alkanes comprise, in a preferred embodiment, as stated at the beginning, further alkanes different therefrom. These are preferably essentially alkanes with a higher molecular weight than the enriched alkane. Preferably, then, for example, a fraction enriched in Ci6-isoalkanes is obtained which essentially comprises no Cs- and/or Ci2-isoalkanes, but which comprises C2o-isoalkanes and, if appropriate, higher homologs.<br>
For the separation, the reaction mixture of the oligomerization or of the hydrogenation can be subjected to one or more separation steps. Suitable separation devices are the customary apparatuses known to the person skilled in the art. These include, for example, distillation columns, e.g. plate columns, which may, if desired, be equipped with bubble caps, sieve plates, sieve trays, valves, side take-offs, etc., evaporators, such as thin-film evaporators, falling-film evaporators, wiper-blade evaporators, Sambay evaporators, etc. and combinations thereof. Isolation of the olefin fraction preferably takes place by single-stage or multistage fractional distillation.<br><br>
The isoalkane mixtures according to the invention are particularly advantageously suitable for use in cosmetic and phanmaceutical compositions. They are generally odoriess and in particular have no odor components perceived by the consumer of cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations as "strange" or "chemical", e.g. a terpene-like odor, which requires the use of intensively fragrant or relatively large quantities of perfume oils for masking.<br>
Although the isoalkane mixtures according to the invention have no intrinsic odor as such, it may be advantageous to subject the hydrogenated oligomerization product obtained in step c) to at least one work-up step to remove undesired components. These include, for example, components which possibily still adversely affect the optical and/or olfactory properties. Preferably, the hydrogenated oligomerization product obtained in step c) is subjected to a work-up by bringing it into contact with at least one adsorbent. Suitable adsorbents are described, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 6th Edition, 2000 Electronic Release, "Adsorption", 3. Absorbents and the corresponding tables 1 and 2, to which reference is made here in its entirety.<br>
The adsorbents are preferably selected from silicone dioxides, kieselguhr, natural and synthetic aluminum silicates, aluminum oxides, solids containing aluminum oxide, aluminum phosphates, phosphates different from aluminum phosphates, titanium dioxides, zirconium dioxides, adsort&gt;ents containing carbon, organic absorber resins and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable adsort&gt;ents are, for example, active aluminum oxides. They are prepared, for example, starting from aluminum hydroxide, which is obtainable by customary precipitation methods from aluminum salt solutions. Active aluminum oxides suitable for the method according to the invention are also obtainable starting from aluminum hydroxide gels. To prepare such gels, precipitated aluminum hydroxide, for example, can be activated by customary work-up steps, such as filtration, washing and drying, and then, if appropriate, be ground or agglomerated. If desired, the resulting aluminum oxide can then also be subjected to a shaping method, such as extrusion, granulation, tableting etc. Suitable adsorbents are preferably the Selexsorb TM grades from Alcoa.<br>
Suitable adsorbents are furthermore solids containing aluminum oxide. These include, for example, the so-called clay earths, which likewise have aluminum oxides as main constituent. Natural and synthetic aluminum silicates are also suitable. These include sheet silicates, such as clay minerals, and particulariy preferably tectosilicates, specifically zeolites.<br><br>
Furthermore, suitable adsort}ents are aluminum phosphates.<br>
Further suitable adsorbents are silicon dioxides, which are obtainable, for example, by dewatering and activating silica gels. A further method of producing silicon dioxide is the flame hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride, where, through appropriate variations of the reaction parameters, such as, for example, the stoichiometric composition of the starting mixture and the temperature, the desired surface properties of the resulting silicon dioxide can be varied within wide ranges.<br>
Further suitable adsorbents are kieselguhrs, which likewise have silicon dioxides as<br>
main constituent. These include, for example, the diatomaceous earth obtained from<br>
silica sediments.<br>
Further suitable adsorbents are titanium dioxides and zirconium dioxides, as are<br>
described, for example, in R6mpp, Chemie Lexikon, 9th edtion (Paperback), Vol. 6, p.<br>
4629ff. and p. 5156fF. and the literature cited therein. Reference is made to this in its<br>
entirety.<br>
Further suitable adsorbents are phosphates, in particular condensed phosphates, such as, for example, melt phosphates or high-temperature phosphates, which have a large active surface area. Suitable phosphates are described, for example, in Rdmpp, Chemie Lexikon, 9th edition (Paperback), Vol. 4, p. 3376ff. and the literature cited therein. Reference is made here to this in its entirety.<br>
Further suitable adsorbents are cart)on-containing adsorbents, preferably activated cart)on. Activated carbon is generally understood here as meaning carbon with a porous structure and high internal surface area. To produce activated carbon, vegetable, animal and/or mineral cart)on-containing raw materials are heated, e.g. with dehydrating agents, such as zinc chloride or phosphoric acid, or are carbonized by dry distillation and then oxidatively activated. For this, the carbonized material can, for example, be treated at elevated temperatures of from at&gt;out 700 to 1000°C with steam, cart)on dioxide and/or mixtures thereof.<br>
It is also possible to use ion exchangers and/or adsorber resins.<br>
The adsorbents generally have a specific surface area, determined according to BET, in the range from about 10 to 2000 m^g, in particular in the range from 10 to 1500 m^/g and specifically in the range from 20 to 600 m^g.<br>
The isoalkane mixtures according to the invention are furthermore generally coloriess or have only a slight intrinsic color. Preferably, the isoalkane mixtures according to the<br><br>
invention and obtainable by the method according to the invention have a Hazen or APHA color number (determined in accordance with DIN 6271) of at most 6, particularly preferably of at most 5. Depending on the molecular weight, the isoalkanes are of liquid to oil-like consistency. For a use in cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions, preference is given to using isoalkane mixtures which have isoalkanes having 8 to 28, preferably 8 to 20, carbon atoms. These isoalkane mixtures are liquid under standard conditions (25°C, 1013 mbar).<br>
In a specific embodiment, isoalkane mixtures which have a high uniformity with regard to the molecular weight of the isoalkanes present are used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions. These are preferably dimers, trimers or tetramers. These isoalkane mixtures have then preferably at least 70% by weight, particulariy preferably at least 85% by weight and in particular at least 95% isoalkanes with the same number of cart)on atoms.<br>
Compared to the oil bodies known from the prior art for cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions, the isoalkanes according to the invention are characterized by comparable or better application properties. For example, they have excellent skin compatibility, do not lead to irritations and are suitable for alleviating the irritating effect of other ingredients or for improving the dermal application of active ingredients. They can be formulated with a large number of cosmetic active ingredients and auxiliaries. In this connection, they usually have a lower volatility than corresponding silicone oils of the same molecular weight. Their flame points are sufTiciently high to satisfy stringent safety standards during production and use. Thus, for example, a C-ie-isoalkane mixture according to the invention generally has a flame point of at least 100*^0, such as, for example, of 105'C. Furthermore, the isoalkane mixtures according to the invention have excellent sensory properties. They leave behind a good feel on the skin, absorb readily on keratin surfaces and impart good combability to hair treated therewith. They are thus suitable in a particularly advantageous way for partially or completely replacing other hydrophobic components of cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions, in particular silicone oils and mineral oils.<br>
Besides the isoalkane mixtures according to the invention and obtainable according to the inventive method, isoalkane mixtures which have a very high fraction of alkanes of the same molecular weight are also suitable for use in cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions. These include isoalkane mixtures which have greater than or equal to 95% by weight, preferably at least 96% by weight, in particular at least 97% by weight, of alkanes of the same molecular weight. These are preferably Cig-isoalkane mixtures (referred to t&gt;elow as "high Ci6-containing isoalkane mixtures"). The invention therefore further provides a cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition which comprises at least<br><br>
one mixture having Cie-alkanes, where the mixture has a fraction of Cie-alkanes of greater than or equal to 95% by weight. Preferably, the cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions then comprise a mixture having Ci6-alkanes wherein the mixture has a composition in which the molecules present comprise, on average, fewer than 1.0 quaternary carbon atoms per molecule, where the mixture has a fraction of Cie-alkanes of greater than or equal to 95% by mass and where the mixture has a fraction of less than 5% by mass of n-hexadecane.<br>
Such mixtures having Ci6-isoalkanes are obtainable by a method where<br>
a)	a butene-containing C4-hydrocarbon stream which has less than 5% by mass, based on the total of all butenes, of isobutene, is oligomerized in the presence of a nickel-containing catalyst,<br>
b)	that a Ci6-olefin fraction is separated off from the reaction mixture and<br>
c)	that the Ci6 fraction is hydrogenated.<br>
Suitable Cie-isoalkane mixtures and a method for their preparation are described in DE 10 2004 018 753 A1, to which reference is made here in its entirety. In DE 10 2004 018 753 A1, the hydrocari^on mixtures are referred to as "Ci6-alkane" mixtures although they also have only a very small fraction of n-hexadecane. For the purposes of the present application, the synonymous term "iso" alkane mixture has been used in order to denote alkane mixtures which comprise branched alkanes.<br>
However, particular preference is given to the use of the isoalkane mixtures according to the invention and obtainable according to the inventive method which, as detailed above, have particularly advantageous properties. In particular, they surpass, with regard to the rheological properties and specifically spreading behavior, all oil bodies known from the prior art, including those of DE 10 2004 018 753 A1, which othenwise have good application properties.<br>
The invention therefore further provides a cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
A)	at least one isoalkane mixture, as defined above,<br>
B)	at least one cosmetically or pharmaceutically acceptable active ingredient or effect substance.<br><br>
C)     if appropriate at least one further cosmetically or pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary different from B).<br>
The isoalkane mixtures according to the invention and high Ci6-containing isoalkane mixtures are suitable both for the preparation of homogeneous-phase hydrophobic compositions and also for the formulation of heterogeneous-phase compositions which additionally comprise at least one water-soluble (hydrophilic) liquid or solid compound. Irrespective of the number of their constituents, "homogeneous-phase compositions" have only a single phase. "Heterogeneous-phase compositions" are disperse systems of two or more immiscible components. These include solid/liquid, liquid/liquid and solid/liquid/liquid compositions, such as dispersions and emulsions, e.g. O/W and W/0 formulations which have at least one isoalkane mixture according to the invention as oil or fat component and water as immiscible phases.<br>
The isoalkane mixtures according to the invention and high Ci6-containing isoalkane mixtures are also suitable in an advantageous way for producing cosmetic compositions and pharmaceutical compositions in the form of opaque to clear gels.<br>
Active ingredients for cosmetics and drugs are generally understood as meaning substances which develop an effect even in low concentration, e.g. a cosmetic effect on skin and/or hair or a pharmacological effect in an organism. Effect substances are substances which impart a certain property to living things or inanimate substrates, for example colored pigments for make-up.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention comprise component A) preferably in a fraction of from 0.01 to 99.9% by weight, particularly preferably 0.1 to 75% by weight, in particular 1 to 50% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are preferably in the form of an ointment, cream, emulsion, suspension, lotion, milk, paste, gel, foam or spray.<br>
If the isoalkanes A) do not already serve as carriers for the preparation of the compositions, said compositions preferably have a carrier component C) which is chosen from water, hydrophilic components, hydrophobic components and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable hydrophilic carriers C) are, for example, mono-, di- or polyhydric alcohols having preferably 1 to 8 cart)on atoms, such as ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, propylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, etc.<br><br>
Suitable hydrophobic earners C) are preferably chosen from<br>
i)       oils, fats, waxes different from component A),<br>
ii)      esters of Ce-Cso-monocarboxylic acids with mono-, di- or trihydric alcohols,<br>
iii)     saturated acyclic and cyclic hydrocarbons different from component A),<br>
iv)     fatty acids,<br>
v)      fatty alcohols,<br>
vi)     propellant gases,<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>

Besides components typical of the field of use (e.g. certain pharmaceutical active ingredients), they are selected from carriers, excipients, emulsifiers, surfactants, preservatives, fragrances, perfume oils, thickeners, polymers, gel formers, dyes, pigments, photoprotective agents, consistency regulators, antioxidants, antifoams, antistats, resins, solvents, solubility promoters, neutralizing agents, stabilizers, sterilizing agents, propellants, drying agents, opacifiers, cosmetically active ingredients, hair polymers, hair and skin conditioners, graft polymers, water-soluble or dispersible silicone-containing polymers, bleaches, care agents, colorants, tinting agents, tanning agents, humectants, refatting agents, collagen, protein hydrolyzates, lipids, emollients and softeners.<br>

In one embodiment of the present invention, the copolymers Ca) of A), B) and if appropriate C) and D) used according to the invention have an average molar mass M^ in the range from 1000 g/mol to 50 000 g/mol, preferably 1500 g/mol to 25 000 g/mol, determined, for example, by gel permeation chromatography with dimethylacetamide as solvent and polymethyl methacrylate as standard.<br>

The polydispersity M^Mn of the copolymers Ca) is generally in the range from 1.1 to 20, preferably from 2 to 10.<br>
Preferably, the copolymers Ca) have K values in accordance with Fikentscher in the range from 5 to 100, preferably 8 to 30 (measured In accordance with H. Fikentscher at 25**C in cyclohexanone and a polymer concentration of 2% by weight).<br><br>
To prepare suitable copolymers Ca), the starting materials are A), B) and if appropriate<br>
C)	and D), which are preferably free-radically copolymerized with one another and if<br>
appropriate reacted with E). The reaction with E) can take place before, during and<br>
after the copolymerization. During or preferably after the copolymerization, the mixture<br>
can be contacted with water. However, to prepare the copolymers Ca), it is also<br>
possible to dispense with the contacting with water.<br>
If a reaction of copolymer of A), B) and if appropriate C) and D) with E) or a free-radical copolymerization in the presence of E) is desired, then the total amount of E) is preferably calculated in such a way that a complete conversion of E) is assumed and up to 50 mol%, preferably 1 to 30 mol%, particularly preferably 2 to 20 mol% of E), based on all carboxyl groups of the copolymer, is used. For the purposes of the present invention, the term "all carboxyl groups present in the polymer" is to be understood as meaning those carboxyl groups from copolymerized comonomers A) and if appropriate<br>
D)	which are present as anhydride, as CrC4-alkyl ester and as carboxylic acid.<br>
The free-radical copolymerization is advantageously started by the customary Initiators known for this purpose, for example peroxides or hydroperoxides.<br>
The copolymerization can be carried out in the presence or the absence of solvents and precipitants. Suitable solvents for the free-radical copolymerization are polar solvents inert toward acid anhydride, such as, for example, acetone, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane. Suitable precipitants are, for example, toluene, ortho-xylene, meta-xylene and aliphatic hydrocarbons.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the method is carried out without solvents or in the presence of only small amounts of solvent, i.e. 0.1 to at most 10% by weight, based on the total mass of comonomers A), B) and if appropriate C) and D). Solvents are to be understood as meaning substances inert under the conditions of the copolymerization and the esterification or amide formation, in particular aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as, for example, cyclohexane, n-heptane, isododecane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene as isomer mixture, meta-xylene, ortho-xylene. If, in the reaction with E), no acidic catalyst is used, or if the reaction with E) is dispensed with, then the free-radical copolymerization and, if appropriate, reaction with E) can also be carried out in solvents selected from ketones, such as, for example, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, or cyclic or noncyclic ethers, such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran or din-butyl ether.<br><br>
The copolymerization and, if appropriate, the reaction with E) is preferably carried out with the exclusion of oxygen, for example in a nitrogen or argon atmosphere, preferably in a stream of nitrogen.<br>
Preferably, the temperature for the copolymerization of A), B) and if appropriate C) and D) is in the range from 80 to 300°C, preferably 90 to 200°C.<br>
The pressure is, for example, in the range from 1 to 15 bar, preferably 1 to 10 bar.<br>
Regulators can be used, for example C',-C4-aldehydes, formic acid and organic compounds comprising SH groups, such as 2-mercaptoethanol, 2-mercaptopropanol, mercaptoacetic acid, tert-butyl mercaptan, n-dodecyl mercaptan. Polymerization regulators are generally used in amounts of from 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the total mass of the comonomers used. Preference is given to working without the use of regulators.<br>
During the copolymerization, one or more polymerization inhibitors can be added in small amounts, for example hydroquinone monomethyl ether. Polymerization inhibitor can advantageously be metered in with B) and if appropriate C) and D). Suitable amounts of polymerization inhibitor are 0.01 to 1% by weight, preferably 0.05 to 0.5% by weight, calculated on the mass of all of the comonomers. The addition of polymerization inhibitor is preferred particularly if the copolymerization is carried out at temperatures above 80°C.<br>
When the addition of A), B) and if appropriate C) and D), if appropriate E), and if appropriate initiator is complete, the mixture can be left to afterreact.<br>
The reaction with E) can be carried out in the absence or presence of catalysts, in particular acidic catalysts, such as, for example, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, n-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid or acid ion exchangers.<br>
In a further variant of the described method, the reaction with E) is carried out in the presence of an entrainer which forms an azeotrope with water forming, if appropriate, during the reaction.<br>
In general, under the conditions of the above-described steps, E) reacts completely or to a certain percentage with the carboxyl groups of the anhydrides A) and, if appropriate, the carboxyl groups from D). In general, less than 40 mol% remain as unreacted E).<br><br>
It is possible, through methods known per se, such as, for example, extraction, to separate off unreacted E) from copolymer obtainable by the preparation method according to the invention.<br>
In one embodiment, it is possible to dispense with the further step of separating off unreacted E) from the prepared copolymers. In this embodiment, copolymers are used together with a certain percentage of unreacted E) for the treatment of fibrous substrates.<br>
The above-descrit)ed copolymerization of A), B) and if appropriate C) and D) gives copolymers. The resulting copolymers can be subjected to purification by conventional methods, for example reprecipitation or extractive removal of unreacted monomers. If a solvent or precipitant has been used, it is possible to remove this once copolymerization is complete, for example by distillation.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, copolymer prepared as described above can be contacted with water, and the amount of added water is calculated so that dispersions according to the invention are obtained which have a water content in the range from 30 to 99.5% by weight, based on the total mass of auxiliaries. In one embodiment, after the free-radical copolymerization and, if appropriate, the reaction with E), water is added, where the water can also comprise Brensted acid or preferably Bronsted base. Examples of Bronsted acids are sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, tartaric acid and citric acid. Examples of Br0nsted bases are alkali metal hydroxide, such as, for example, NaOH and KOH, alkali metal carbonate, such as, for example, NasCOa and K2CO3, alkali metal hydrogencarbonate, such as, for example, NaHCOa and KHCO3, ammonia, amines, such as, for example, trimethylamine, triethylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, N,N-diethanolamine, N,N,N-triethanolamine, N-methylethanolamine. The concentration of Bronsted acid or preferably Bronsted base is generally 1 to 20% by weight, based on the sum of water and Brensted acid or water and Brensted base.<br>
Water can be added during the free-radical copolymerization, although it is preferably added only towards the end of the free-radical copolymerization. If the free-radical copolymerization and the reaction with E) has been carried out in the presence of solvents, then it is preferred to firstly remove solvents, for example by distillation, and only then to contact with water.<br>
As a result of the contacting with water, which, if appropriate, can comprise Brensted acid or preferably Brensted base, the carboxylic acid anhydride groups present in the<br><br>
copolymer Ca) can be partially or completely hydrolyzed. After the contacting with water, which can, if appropriate, comprise Brensted acid or preferably Bronsted base, the mixture can be left to afterreact at temperatures in the range from 20 to 120°C, preferably up to 100°C, for a period of from 10 minutes to 48 hours.<br>
The isoalkane mixtures A) to be used according to the invention are likewise suitable in pharmaceutical preparations of any type, e.g. as oil bodies, for modifying the rheological properties, and as solubilizer.<br>
The invention therefore further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
A)	at least one isoalkane mixture, as defined above,<br>
B)	at least one pharmaceuttcally acceptable active ingredient and<br>
C)	if appropriate at least one further pharmaceuticalty acceptable active ingredient or auxiliary different from B).<br>
In a further suitable embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise, as component A), at least one high Cie-containing isoalkane mixture, as defined above.<br>
The formulation base of the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention preferably comprises pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries. Of pharmaceutical acceptability are the auxiliaries known for use in the field of pharmacy, food technology and related fields, in particular the auxiliaries listed in the relevant pharmacopoeia (e.g. DAB Ph.

To prepare pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention, the active ingredients can be mixed or diluted with a suitable auxiliary (excipient). Excipients may be solid, semisolid or liquid materials which can serve as vehicles, carriers or medium for the active ingredient. The admixing of further auxiliaries takes place, if desired, in the manner known to the person skilled in the art. In particular, these are aqueous solutions or solubilizates for oral or parenteral application. Furthermore, the copolymers to be used according to the invention are also suitable for use in oral administration forms such as tablets, capsules, powders, solutions. Here, they can make the drug available with increased bioavailability. In the case of parenteral application, besides solubilizers, it is also possible to use emulsions, for example fatty emulsions. The isoalkane mixtures A) according to the invention are also suitable for this purpose in order to process a drug that is sparingly soluble in, for example, aqueous media.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of the abovementioned type can be obtained by processing the copolymers A) to be used according to the invention with pharmaceutical active ingredients by conventional methods and using known and novel active ingredients.<br>
The composition according to the Invention can additionally comprise pharmaceutical auxiliaries and/or diluents. Cosolvents, stabilizers, preservatives are especially listed as auxiliaries.<br>
The pharmaceutical active Ingredients used are substances which are soluble or insoluble or a little soluble in water. According to DAB 9 (German Pharmacopoeia), the solubility of pharmaceutical active ingredients is graded as follows: a little soluble (soluble in 30 to 100 parts of solvent); sparingly soluble (soluble in 100 to 1000 parts of solvent); virtually Insoluble (soluble in more than 10 000 parts of solvent). The active ingredients here can come from any indication area.<br>
Of the abovementioned pharmaceutical compositions, particular preference is given to those which are formulations which can be applied parenterally.<br>
The content of Isoalkane mixture A) in the pharmaceutical compositions is, depending on the active ingredient, in the range from 0.01 to 50% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 40% by weight, particulariy preferably 1 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>

Examples of suitable pharmaceutical active ingredients are in particular the active ingredients specified in paragraphs 0105 to 0131 of US 2003/0157170.<br>
The isoalkane mixtures obtainable according to the invention and by the method according to the invention are free from intrinsic odors and have an extremely wide liquid interval (at least from -70 to +200°C). They are therefore suitable in a particularly advantageous manner as heat transfer liquid, e.g. for solar energy plants, geothermal plants, heat exchangers used industrially etc. They are further suitable as solvents for fuel additives and low-temperature fuel (e.g. as or in jet fuel(s)).<br>
The isoalkane mixture according to the invention is also suitable as shock absorber oil. In this connection, it can be used in pure form or in a mixture with at least one further oil, e.g. a mineral oil and/or synthetic oil (e.g. polyalphaolefin). Further components such as viscosity improvers, pour-point depressants or antioxidants can likewise be added.<br>

Example 1: Preparation of an isoalkene mixture<br><br>
An oligomer as in example 3 of WO 95/14647 was prepared starting from the C4 hydrocarbon mixture described therein using the catalyst described in example 1 of WO 95/14647. 2 kg of this oligomer were subjected to fractionation over an 80 cm packed column (wire-mesh coils) with a reflux ratio of 1:5. This gave:<br><br>
According to GC analysis, fraction 1c consisted of 7% Ci2 0ligomerization product, 70% C16 oligomerization product, 17% C20 oligomerization product, and higher homologs.<br>
Example 2: Hydrogenation effraction 1c<br>
6 I of butene tetramer 1c from example 1 and 50 g of Pd/activated cart}on (10% Pd) were introduced into a 9 I stirred pressurized container. Firstly, up to a maximum of 50 bar (5 MPa) of hydrogen was injected, such that the temperature did not exceed 50°C. Then, at 50°C, the hydrogen pressure was increased to 200 bar (20 MPa) and the mixture was after-hydrogenated for 2 hours. When hydrogenation was complete, the catalyst was separated off firstly over a fluted filter and then over a short column containing AI2O3. This gave 4.4 kg of a clear, pale, odorless liquid.<br>
^H-NMR (16 scans, 400 MHz, 10% in CDCI3): no signals in the range 5 7.0 - 2.5 ppm detectable; 48% of the integral in the range 6 0.6 - 1 ppm.<br>

Then, at 50*'C, the hydrogen pressure was increased to 200 bar (20 MPa) and the mixture was after-hydrogenated for 2 hours. When hydrogenation was complete, the catalyst was separated off firstly over a fluted fitter and then over a short column containing AI2O3. This gave 1.2 kg of a clear, pale, odorless liquid. 1.2 kg of a clear, pale, odorless liquid.<br>

Example 5 (comparative example, in accordance with example 5 of WO 2004/091555)<br>
800 g of isobutene and 200 g of 1-butene were initially introduced into a 3 I stirred pressurized container, and also 100 g of Lewatit® SPC 112. (In contrast to WO 2004/091555, the ion exchanger resin was converted beforehand into the active H"^ form with 10% H2SO4, washed thoroughly with H2O and dried. Without this catalyst activation, no conversion was achieved.). The mixture was stirred for 3 hours at 100°C, a maximum pressure of 20 bar (2 MPa) being achieved. The reactor contents were discharged, separated from the catalyst and degassed on a rotary evaporator at 40°C / 100 mbar (0.02 MPa). This gave 815 g of a water-pale, low viscosity liquid with an olefinic odor.<br>
M-NMR (16 scans, 400 MHz, 10% in GDCI3): 7.7% of the integral in the olefin range 6 5.5-4.5 ppm<br>
770 g of the above olefin mixture and 5 g of Pd/activated carbon (10% Pd) were introduced into a 3 I stirred pressurized container. Firstly, up to a maximum of 20 bar (2 MPa) of hydrogen was injected, such that the temperature does not exceed SO^C. Then, at 100°C, the hydrogen pressure is increased to 200 bar (20 MPa) and the mixture is hydrogenated for a total of 12 hours. When hydrogenation was complete, the catalyst was separated off firstly over a fluted filter and then over a short column containing AI2O3. This gave 670 g of a clear, pale liquid with a slight terpene odor.<br>

II. Spreading behavior<br>
The spreading values given below were determined by the following method: A piece of filter paper (filter paper grade 1243/90, white, 500 x 500 mm sheet, manufacturer: Pdrringer, ca. 200 x 200 mm) is placed in freely suspended form onto a watchglass or a Petri dish, and 10 pi of the lipid to be measured is placed in the middle. After 10 minutes, the lipid-wetted area is marked, cut out and weighed. The same method is used with the internal standard (Paraffinum perliquidum). The relative spreading value is calculated from the values obtained by the following formula:<br>
relative spreading value = (area of measured substance x 100) / area of Paraffinum perliquidum<br><br><br><br>
