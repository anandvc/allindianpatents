This application claims benefit of priority of US provisional<br>
application 60/461,190 filed on Aprif 9, 2003 and US application<br>
10/446,704 filed on May 29, 2003, which are incorporated by reference<br>
in their entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed generally to electrochemical<br>
systems and more particularly to co-production of electricity and hydrogen<br>
in a high temperature fuel cell system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an electrochemical device that<br>
converts chemical energy directly into electrical energy. A solid oxide<br>
regenerative fuel cell (SORFC) is an electrochemical device that converts<br>
electrical energy directly into chemical energy and subsequently reconverts<br>
chemical energy back to electrical energy. This device differs significantly<br>
from rechargeable batteries in that the chemicals are stored outside of the<br>
SORFC converter. The SORFC system has many building electrical energy<br>
storage applications that cannot be satisfied by batteries. For example, a<br>
SORFC system for building power generation is discussed in the<br>
Proceedings of the 2001 DOE Hydrogen Program Review NREL/CP-570-<br>
30535. A SORFC system which generates hydrogen in the electrolysis<br>
mode and which generates electricity in the fuel cell mode is described in<br>
Proceedings of the 2002 DOE Hydrogen Program Review NREL/CP-610-<br>
32405. This SORFC system may contain a separate electrolyzer unit<br>
which operates in the electrolysis mode and which is operatively<br>
connected to the fuel cell stack to generate hydrogen. However, these<br>
SORFC systems have certain environmental and economic drawbacks.<br>
The SOFC and SORFC are high temperature electrochemical<br>
systems. Another high temperature electrochemical system is a molten<br>
carbonate fuel cell. Fuel cells often use hydrogen as fuel. For example,<br>
fuel cell powered vehicles would require hydrogen refueling stations for<br>
operation. However, distribution of hydrogen from centralized hydrogen<br>
producing plants to refuel vehicles is not currently economical.<br>
Furthermore, hydrogen production is fairly expensive.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
THE FIRST PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present inventors have realized that a suitably configured high<br>
temperature electrochemical system, such as a solid oxide electrochemical<br>
system, such as a SOFC or a SORFC system, or a molten carbonate fuel<br>
cell system, can be used to co-produce hydrogen and electricity in the fuel<br>
cell mode. Thus, while the prior art SORFC system can generate either<br>
electricity in the fuel cell mode or hydrogen in an electrolysis mode, the<br>
system of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention can co-<br>
produce both hydrogen and electricity (i.e., produce hydrogen and<br>
electricity together). The system of the first preferred embodiment<br>
generates a hydrogen rich exhaust stream using reforming reactions that<br>
occur within the fuel cell stack and/or in a reformer in thermal integration<br>
with the fuel cell stack. The amount of hydrogen produced can be<br>
controlled by the operator. The hydrogen rich stream is further<br>
conditioned if necessary and stored or used directly by the operator.<br>
Thus, the high temperature electrochemical systems produce purified<br>
hydrogen as a by-product of fuel reformation in the fuel cell mode. The<br>
electrochemical system may operate in the fuel cell mode, when no<br>
external electricity input is required, to generate diffusion of ions across an<br>
electrolyte of the system. In contrast, a reversible or regenerative<br>
electrochemical system operates in the electrolysis mode when external<br>
electricity is required to generate diffusion of ions across the electrolyte of<br>
the system.<br>
It should be noted that the electrochemical system of the first<br>
embodiment does not necessarily co-produce or co-generate power or<br>
electricity for use outside the system. The system may be operated to<br>
primarily internally reform a carbon and hydrogen containing fuel into<br>
hydrogen with minimal power generation or without delivering or<br>
outputting power from the system at all. If desired, a small amount of<br>
power may be generated and used internally within the system, such as to<br>
keep the system at operating temperature and to power system<br>
components in addition to other parasitic loads in the system.<br>
The system of the first preferred embodiment which produces<br>
hydrogen in the fuel cell mode may be any high temperature<br>
electrochemical system which produces sufficient heat to free bound<br>
hydrogen contained in a fuel gas provided into the system. For example,<br>
the system may be a solid oxide or a molten carbonate system. The solid<br>
oxide system, such as a SOFC or SORFC is preferred. The following<br>
description of the preferred aspects of the present invention describes<br>
SOFC or SORFC systems. However, it should be noted that other suitable<br>
electrochemical systems may also be used.<br>
Thus, in a preferred aspect of the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the high temperature electrochemical system is a SOFC or a<br>
SORFC system which co-produces electricity and hydrogen in the fuel cell<br>
mode. A SOFC or SORFC system operates in the fuel cell mode when<br>
oxygen ions diffuse through an electrolyte of the fuel, cells from the<br>
oxidizer side to the fuel side of the fuel cell containing the carbon and<br>
hydrogen containing gas stream. Thus, when the high temperature<br>
electrochemical system, such as a SOFC or SORFC system operates in the<br>
fuel cell mode to generate hydrogen, a separate electrolyzer unit operating<br>
in electrolysis mode and which is operatively connected to the fuel cell<br>
stack is not required for generation of hydrogen. Instead, the hydrogen is<br>
separated directly from the fuel cell stack fuel side exhaust gas stream<br>
without using additional electricity to operate a separate electrolyzer unit.<br>
When an SORFC system is used rather than an SOFC system, the<br>
SORFC system can be connected to a primary source of electricity (e.g.,<br>
grid power) and can accept electricity from the primary source when<br>
desirable or can deliver electricity to the primary source when desirable.<br>
Thus, when operating the SORFC system of the first preferred<br>
embodiment, the system operator does not have to sacrifice electricity<br>
production to produce hydrogen and vice versa. The SORFC system does<br>
not require a hot thermal mass which absorbs heat in the fuel cell mode<br>
and which releases heat in the electrolysis mode for operation or energy<br>
storage. However, a hot thermal mass may be used if desired.<br>
Furthermore, the system may use, but does not require a fuel reformer.<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred aspect of the first embodiment, a<br>
relative amount of hydrogen and electricity produced can be freely<br>
controlled. All or a portion of the hydrogen in the fuel side exhaust stream<br>
may be recirculated into the fuel inlet stream to provide control of the<br>
amount of electricity and hydrogen being co-produced in the system, as<br>
will be described in more detail below. The hydrogen product can be<br>
further conditioned, if necessary, and stored or used directly in a variety of<br>
applications, such as transportation, power generation, cooling,<br>
hydrogenation reactions, or semiconductor manufacture, either in a<br>
pressurized or a near ambient state.<br>
Figure 1A illustrates an SOFC or SORFC electricity generation<br>
system 100 according to the first preferred embodiment. The system<br>
derives power from the oxidation of a carbon and hydrogen containing<br>
fuel, such as a hydrocarbon fuel, such as methane, natural gas which<br>
contains methane with hydrogen and other gases, propane or other<br>
biogas, or a mixture of a carbon fuel, such as carbon monoxide,<br>
oxygenated carbon containing gas, such as methanol, or other carbon<br>
containing gas with a hydrogen containing gas, such as water vapor, H2<br>
gas or their mixtures. For example, the mixture may comprise syngas<br>
derived from coal or natural gas reformation. Free hydrogen is carried in<br>
several of the system process flow streams. The carbon containing fuel is<br>
provided into the system from a fuel source, which may comprise a fuel<br>
inlet into the fuel cell stack, a fuel supply conduit and/or a fuel storage<br>
vessel.<br>
The system illustrated in Figure 1A contains a fuel preprocessor<br>
subsystem 104, which may contain a heat exchanger and/or other fuel<br>
processing elements. In one preferred aspect of the present invention, the<br>
fuel preprocessor subsystem 104 converts a biogas, such as natural gas,<br>
to methane, and supplies methane into the fuel cell. The system 100 also<br>
contains an oxidizer inlet conduit 105, which preferably contains an air or<br>
other oxidizer blower (schematically shown in Figure 1), and fuel inlet 106<br>
and outlet 109 conduits. The system also contains a stack of SOFCs or<br>
SORFCs 110, which have a fuel inlet 107 and a fuel outlet 108. The<br>
stack 110 preferably contains the fuel cells, separator plates, seals, gas<br>
conduits, heaters, thermal insulation, control electronics and various other<br>
suitable elements used in fuel cell stacks. If desired, the system may have<br>
an optional oxidizer exhaust or outlet 116. Alternatively, the oxidizer<br>
outlet may be omitted to allow alI oxygen to diffuse from the oxidizer inlet<br>
conduit 105 through the fuel cell electrolyte. The oxidizer inlet conduit<br>
105 may also be used as an oxygen outlet when a SORFC is operated in<br>
the electrolysis mode. Water may be recirculated into the fuel inlet 107<br>
from the fuel outlet 108, as will be described in more detail with respect<br>
to Figures 6A and 6B.<br>
The system 100 also contains at least one hydrogen separator 113.<br>
The hydrogen separator 113 may comprise any device which can separate<br>
some or all hydrogen from a hydrogen containing gas stream. Preferably,<br>
the hydrogen separator is a device which can separate a desired or<br><br>
variable amount of hydrogen from a hydrogen gas containing stream,<br>
depending on user requirements. Alternatively, the hydrogen separator<br>
113 may comprise a device which separates all or substantially all<br>
hydrogen from a hydrogen containing gas stream.<br>
The hydrogen separator 113 may comprise one or more polymeric<br>
proton exchange membranes, ceramic proton exchange membranes,<br>
polymeric gas separation membranes, adsorption-based gas separation<br>
columns (such as pressure swing adsorption units), and flow diverting<br>
devices such as valves. The suitable device may be selected based on the<br>
state point of the gas stream (composition, temperature, and pressure),<br>
the desired product purity, available volume that depends on the specific<br>
generator design, and economic factors.<br>
The system 100 also contains an optional hydrogen conditioner<br>
114. The hydrogen conditioner 114 may be any suitable device which can<br>
purify, dry, compress (i.e., a compressor), or otherwise change the state<br>
point of the hydrogen-rich gas stream provided from the hydrogen<br>
separator 113. If desired, the hydrogen conditioner 114 may be omitted.<br>
The system 100 also contains a hydrogen storage/use subsystem<br>
115. This subsystem 115 may comprise a hydrogen storage vessel, such<br>
as a hydrogen storage tank, a hydrogen dispenser, such as a conduit<br>
which provides hydrogen or a hydrogen-rich stream to a device which uses<br>
hydrogen, or a hydrogen using device. For example, the subsystem 115<br>
may comprise a conduit leading to a hydrogen using device or the<br>
hydrogen using device itself, used in transportation, power generation,<br>
cooling, hydrogenation reactions, or semiconductor manufacture.<br>
For example, the system 100 may be located in a chemical or a<br>
semiconductor plant to provide primary or secondary (i.e., backup) power<br>
for the plant as well as hydrogen for use in hydrogenation (i.e., passivation<br>
of semiconductor device) or other chemical reactions which require<br>
hydrogen that are carried out in the plant.<br>
Alternatively, the subsystem 115 may also comprise another fuel<br>
cell, such as an SOFC or SORFC or any other fuel cell, which uses<br>
hydrogen as a fuel. Thus, the hydrogen from the system 100 is provided<br>
as fuel to one or more additional fuel cells 115. For example, the system<br>
100 may be located in a stationary location, such as a building or an area<br>
outside or below a building and is used to provide power to the building.<br>
The additional fuel cells 115 may be located in vehicles located in a garage<br>
or a parking area adjacent to the stationary location. In this case, the<br>
carbon and hydrogen containing fuel is provided to the system 100 to<br>
generate electricity for the building and to generate hydrogen which is<br>
provided as fuel to the fuel cell 115 powered vehicles. The generated<br>
hydrogen may be stored temporarily in a storage vessel and then provided<br>
from the storage vessel to the vehicle fuel cells 115 on demand<br>
(analogous to a gas station) or the generated hydrogen may be provided<br>
directly from the system 100 to the vehicle fuel cells 115.<br>
In one preferred aspect of the present invention, the hydrogen<br>
separator 113 is used to separate and route hydrogen from the fuel side<br>
exhaust stream only into the subsystem 115. In another preferred aspect<br>
of the present invention, the hydrogen separator 113 is used to separate<br>
hydrogen from the fuel side exhaust stream and to route all or a part of<br>
the hydrogen back into the fuel inlet 107 of the fuel cell stack 110<br>
through conduit 112, to route all or part of the hydrogen to the subsystem<br>
115 and/or to route the hydrogen out with the tail gas.<br>
Alternatively, two different hydrogen separators may be used to<br>
route the hydrogen to the conduit 112 and to the subsystem 115, as<br>
shown in Figure 6B and described in more detail below. Thus, the fuel<br>
side exhaust is separated by a valve or another device to two different<br>
hydrogen separators. The first hydrogen separator separates hydrogen<br>
from the first part of the fuel side exhaust and routes the hydrogen to<br>
conduit 112 to be recirculated into the inlet 107. The second hydrogen<br>
separator separates hydrogen from the second part of the fuel side<br>
exhaust and routes the hydrogen to the subsystem 115. Thus, the<br>
amount of hydrogen provided to conduit 112 and to subsystem 115 may<br>
be varied by controlling the amount of fuel side exhaust provided into each<br>
hydrogen separator.<br>
Alternatively, only one hydrogen separator 113 is used. A valve or<br>
another device separates the hydrogen output from the separator into<br>
conduit 112 and into subsystem 115. Thus, the valve or another such<br>
device determines the amount of hydrogen provided to conduit 112 and<br>
subsystem 115. In both cases the valve or similar device may be<br>
controlled by an operator or controlled automatically by a computer based<br>
on predetermined data or on input parameters.<br>
Figure 1B illustrates a system 120 according to an alternative<br>
aspect of the first preferred embodiment. The system 120 is identical to<br>
the system 100 illustrated in Figure 1A, except that the system 120<br>
contains a fuel reformer 124 upstream of the fuel inlet 107. Preferably,<br>
the fuel reformer is included in the system 120 instead of the fuel<br>
preprocessing subsystem 104. However, if desired, the fuel reformer 124<br>
may be used together with the fuel preprocessing subsystem 104, such<br>
that the output of the subsystem 104 is provided into the reformer.<br>
The fuel reformer 124 may be any suitable device which is capable<br>
of reforming a carbon and bound hydrogen containing fuel to form a<br>
carbon containing fuel and free hydrogen. For example, the fuel reformer<br>
124 may be any suitable device which can reform a hydrocarbon gas into<br>
a gas mixture of free hydrogen and a carbon containing gas. For example,<br>
the fuel reformer 124 may reform a biogas, such as natural gas to form<br>
free hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The free hydrogen and carbon<br>
monoxide are then provided into the fuel inlet 107 of the fuel cell stack<br>
110. If desired, some or all free hydrogen may also be separated from the<br>
carbon containing gas by an additional hydrogen separator prior to entry<br>
into the fuel cell stack 110 and provided to the hydrogen storage/use<br>
subsystem 115.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the first embodiment, the fuel reformer 124<br>
is thermally integrated with the fuel cell stack 110. The term "thermally<br>
integrated" in this context means that the heat from the reaction in the<br>
fuel cell stack 110 drives the net endothermic fuel reformation in the fuel<br>
reformer 124. The fuel reformer 124 may be thermally integrated with the<br>
fuel cell stack 110 by placing the reformer 124 and stack 110 in physical<br>
and thermal contact with each other, or by providing a thermal conduit or<br>
thermally conductive material which connects the stack 110 to the<br>
reformer 124. While less preferred, a separate heater may also be used to<br>
heat the reformer 124 instead of or in addition to the heat provided from<br>
the stack 110. If any hydrogen is recycled from the separator 113 back<br>
into the fuel cell stack 110, then the hydrogen may be provided by the<br>
conduit 112 directly into the reformer 124 or into the fuel cell stack 110<br>
inlet 107.<br>
Figure 1C illustrates a system 130 according to an alternative<br>
aspect of the first preferred embodiment. The system 130 is identical to<br>
the system 100 illustrated in Figure 1A, except that the system 130<br>
contains a water-gas shift reactor 133. The water-gas shift reactor 133<br>
may be any suitable device which converts at least a portion of the water<br>
exiting the fuel cell stack 110 fuel outlet 108 into free hydrogen. For<br>
example, the reactor 133 may comprise a tube or conduit containing a<br><br>
catalyst which converts some or all of the carbon monoxide and water<br>
vapor in the tail gas exiting outlet 108 into carbon dioxide and hydrogen.<br>
The catalyst may be any suitable catalyst, such as a iron oxide or a<br>
chromium promoted iron oxide catalyst. The reactor 133 is preferably<br>
located between the outlet 108 and the hydrogen separator 113 (i.e.,<br>
downstream of the outlet 108 and upstream of the separator 113).<br>
The reactor 133 works in tandem with the separator 113 by<br>
increasing the amount of free hydrogen in the fuel side exhaust (i.e., tail<br>
gas) by converting some or all water present in the fuel side exhaust gas<br>
into hydrogen. The reactor 133 then provides hydrogen and carbon<br>
dioxide to the separator 113. The separator 113 separates the hydrogen<br>
from the carbon dioxide. Thus, all or some of the water present in the fuel<br>
may be converted to hydrogen in the reactor 133.<br>
Figure 1D illustrates a system 140 according to an alternative<br>
aspect of the first preferred embodiment. The system 140 is identical to<br>
the system 100 illustrated in Figure 1A, except that the system 140<br>
contains a water supply 144. The water supply 144 may be any suitable<br>
liquid water and/or water vapor supply device, such as a water conduit or<br>
storage tank. The water supply is located upstream of the fuel inlet 107<br>
to provide water into the fuel inlet 107 in addition to the fuel being<br>
provided to the inlet from the preprocessing subsystem 104 or the<br>
reformer 124.<br>
The water supply 144 is preferably, but not necessarily, used to<br>
provide water into the fuel inlet 107 when the fuel cell stack 110 is<br>
operated to generate hydrogen while generating little or no electricity in<br>
the fuel cell mode (i.e., no net electricity is produced in the fuel cell<br>
mode). The additional water is used to support fuel reforming as needed.<br>
The elements of systems 100, 120, 130 and 140 may be used in<br>
any suitable combination. For example, the reformer 124, the reactor 133<br>
and the water supply 144 may be used together in one system with or<br>
without the fuel preprocessing subsystem 104. Furthermore, any two or<br>
three elements selected from the fuel preprocessing subsystem 104, the<br>
reformer 124, the reactor 133 and the water supply 144 may be used<br>
together in the same system.<br>
The systems 100, 120, 130 and 140 illustrated in Figures 1A-1D<br>
may have other embodiments and configurations, as desired. Other<br>
components, such as fuel side exhaust stream condensers, heat<br>
exchangers, heat-driven heat pumps, turbines, additional gas separation<br>
devices, may be added if desired, as described, for example, in U.S.<br>
Application Serial Number 10/300,021, filed on November 20, 2002, to<br>
Matthias Gottmann, et al., incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
A preferred method of operating the systems 100, 120, 130, 140<br>
will now be described. The systems are preferably operated so that<br>
excess fuel is provided to the fuel cell stack 110. Any suitable carbon<br>
containing and hydrogen containing fuel is provided into the fuel cell stack.<br>
The fuel may comprise a fuel such as a hydrocarbon fuel, such as<br>
methane, natural gas which contains methane with hydrogen and other<br>
gases, propane or other biogas.<br>
If desired, hydrogen and/or water vapor may be added to the<br>
hydrocarbon fuel. Alternatively, the fuel may comprise a mixture of a non-<br>
hydrocarbon carbon containing gas, such as carbon monoxide, carbon<br>
dioxide, oxygenated carbon containing gas such as methanol or other<br>
carbon containing gas with a hydrogen containing gas, such a water vapor<br>
or hydrogen gas, for example the mixture may comprise syngas derived<br>
from coal or natural gas reformation. The hydrogen and water vapor may<br>
be recycled from the fuel side exhaust gas stream or provided from<br>
hydrogen and water vapor conduits or storage vessels.<br>
The reformation reactions occur within the fuel cell stack 110<br>
and/or in the optional reformer 124 and result in the formation of free<br>
hydrogen in the fuel side exhaust gas stream. For example, if a<br>
hydrocarbon gas such as methane is used as a fuel, then the methane is<br>
reformed to form a mixture containing non-utilized hydrogen, carbon<br>
dioxide and water vapor in the fuel cell stack 110. If natural gas is used<br>
as a fuel, then the natural gas may be converted to methane in the<br>
preprocessing subsystem 104 or it may be reformed directly to a non-<br>
hydrocarbon carbon containing gas such as carbon monoxide in the<br>
reformer 124.<br>
The following Table I summarizes one or more reactions that may<br>
occur within the fuel cell stack 110 when methane is supplied to the<br>
stack.<br>
If a mixture of a hydrogen containing gas and a non-hydrocarbon<br>
carbon containing gas, such as carbon monoxide, is used as a fuel, then<br>
some of the carbon monoxide is converted to carbon dioxide in the fuel<br>
cell stack 110 and a gas mixture including carbon monoxide, carbon<br>
dioxide and unutilized hydrogen is provided from the fuel cell stack 110. If<br>
the water-gas shift reactor 1 33 is included in the system, then it converts<br>
some of the carbon monoxide and water vapor in the fuel side exhaust gas<br>
stream to hydrogen and carbon dioxide.<br>
Preferably, the fraction of hydrogen separated by the hydrogen<br>
separator 113 and the amount of total fuel provided to the fuel cell stack<br>
110 for electricity and hydrogen production are variable and under the<br>
control of an operator operating a control unit of the system. An operator<br>
may be a human operator who controls the hydrogen separation and<br>
electricity production or a computer which automatically adjusts the<br>
amount of hydrogen separation and electricity production based on<br>
predetermined criteria, such as time, and/or based on received outside<br>
data or request, such as a demand for electricity by the power grid and/or<br>
a demand for hydrogen by the subsystem 115. Controlling these two<br>
parameters allows the operator to specify largely independently the<br>
amount of hydrogen produced and the amount of electricity generated.<br>
The outside data or request may comprise one or more of electricity<br>
demand, hydrogen demand, electricity price and hydrogen price, which<br>
may be transmitted electronically to a computer system operator or<br>
visually or audibly to a human system operator.<br>
In one extreme, when the user of the system needs electricity, but<br>
does not need additional hydrogen, then the operator can choose to have<br>
the hydrogen containing streams recirculated back into the fuel cell stack<br>
110 by the separator 113 through conduit 112 while providing no<br>
hydrogen or a minimum amount of hydrogen to the subsystem 115.<br>
In another extreme, when the user of the system needs hydrogen,<br>
but does not need any electricity generated, the operator can choose to<br>
have the fuel cell stack 110 act primarily to internally reform the carbon<br>
containing fuel into hydrogen with minimal power generation and/or<br>
minimal-or no external power output/delivery from the system. A small<br>
amount of power may be generated to keep the system at operating<br>
temperature and to power the hydrogen separator 113 and conditioner<br>
114, if necessary, in addition to other parasitic loads in the system. All or<br>
most of the hydrogen from the separator 113 is provided to the subsystem<br>
115 rather than to the conduit 112. In this case, additional water from<br>
the water supply 144 is preferably added to the fuel.<br>
In the continuum between the two extremes, varying amounts of<br>
hydrogen and electricity may be needed simultaneously. In this case, the<br>
operator can choose to divert varying amounts of the hydrogen enriched<br>
stream from the separator 113 to conduit 112 and subsystem 115 while<br>
simultaneously generating the desired amount of electricity. For example,<br>
if more hydrogen is recirculated back into the fuel cell stack 110 through<br>
conduit 112, then more electricity is generated but less hydrogen is<br>
available for use or storage in the subsystem 115. The trade off between<br>
the amount of electricity and hydrogen produced can vary based on the<br>
demand and the price of each.<br>
The trade off between the amount of electricity and hydrogen<br>
generated may also be achieved using several other methods. In one<br>
method, the amount of fuel provided to the fuel cell stack 110 is kept<br>
constant, but the amount of current drawn from the stack 110 is varied.<br>
If the amount of current drawn is decreased, then the amount of hydrogen<br>
provided to the hydrogen separator 113 is increased, and vice versa.<br>
When less current is drawn, less oxygen diffuses through the electrolyte<br>
of the fuel cell. Since the reactions which produce free hydrogen (i.e., the<br>
steam-methane reforming reaction (if methane is used as a fuel) and the<br>
water-gas shift reaction) are substantially independent of the<br>
electrochemical reaction, the decreased amount of diffused oxygen<br>
generally does not substantially decrease the amount of free hydrogen<br>
provided in the fuel side exhaust gas stream.<br><br>
In an alternative method, the amount of current drawn from the<br>
stack is kept constant, but the amount of fuel provided to the stack 110 is<br>
varied. If the amount of fuel provided to the stack 110 is increased, then<br>
the amount of hydrogen provided to the hydrogen separator 113 is<br>
increased, and vice versa.<br>
In another alternative method, both the amount of current drawn<br>
and the amount of fuel provided into the fuel cell stack 110 are varied.<br>
The amount of hydrogen generated generally increases with decreasing<br>
amounts of drawn current and with increasing amounts of fuel provided<br>
into the fuel cell stack. The amount of hydrogen generated generally<br>
decreases with increasing amounts of drawn current and with decreasing<br>
amounts of fuel provided into the fuel cell stack.<br>
Preferably, the systems of the first preferred embodiment may be<br>
operated at any suitable fuel utilization rate. Thus, 0 to 100 percent of<br>
the fuel may be utilized for electricity production. Preferably, 50 to SO<br>
percent of the fuel is utilized for electricity production and at least 10<br>
percent, such as 20 to 50 percent, of the fuel is utilized for hydrogen<br>
production. For example, a 100 kWe SOFC system may be used to<br>
generate from about 70 to about 110 kWe of electricity and from about<br>
45 to about 110 kg/day of high pressure hydrogen when 50 to 80 percent<br>
of the fuel is utilized for electricity production. The present inventors have<br>
determined that the systems of the first preferred embodiment may be<br>
used to produce hydrogen cost effectively. Thus, the method of the first<br>
preferred embodiment provides a reduction in the cost of hydrogen<br>
production.<br>
If the fuel cell stack 110 is a solid oxide regenerative fuel cell<br>
(SORFC) stack which is connected to a primary source of power (such as<br>
a power grid) and a source of oxidized fuel (such as water, with or without<br>
carbon dioxide), then the device can operate transiently in an electrolysis<br>
mode as an electrolyzer to generate hydrogen streams, methane streams,<br>
or mixtures when economically advantageous (e.g., when the cost of<br>
electricity is inexpensive compared to the cost of the fuel containing<br>
bound hydrogen), or during times when the demand for hydrogen<br>
significantly exceeds the demand for electricity. At other times, the<br>
system 100 can be used in the fuel cell mode to generate electricity from<br>
the stored hydrogen or carbon containing fuel. Thus, the system 100 can<br>
be used for peak shaving.<br>
THE SECOND PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present inventors have also realized that the electrochemical<br>
system produces valuable byproducts in addition to electricity and<br>
hydrogen. The byproducts can include production, consumption, and/or<br>
temporary storage of heat, methane, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and water.<br>
Carbon dioxide and/or other carbon containing gases emitted in a fuel side<br>
exhaust of a SORFC system of a second preferred embodiment operating<br>
in the fuel cell mode may be captured and stored rather than vented into<br>
the atmosphere. This improves the environmental friendliness of the<br>
SORFC system. The stored carbon dioxide and/or other carbon containing<br>
gases can then be provided into the SORFC system operating in the<br>
electrolysis mode to generate a hydrocarbon fuel, such as methane, rather<br>
than a hydrogen fuel. If desired, the SORFC system may contain a flow<br>
controller which controls a flow of carbon dioxide being provided into the<br>
solid oxide regenerative fuel cell fuel inlet during electrolysis mode. The<br>
flow controller may be any suitable gas flow control device, such as a<br>
computer or operator controlled valve which opens and closes access to a<br>
carbon dioxide and/or other carbon containing gas storage vessel, such as<br>
a carbon dioxide storage tank. The SORFC generates a hydrocarbon fuel,<br>
such as methane, by using a Sabatier subsystem, when carbon dioxide<br>
and water vapor are provided into the SORFC fuel inlet. The SORFC<br>
generates a hydrogen fuel when water vapor is provided into the SORFC<br>
fuel inlet and the flow controller prevents carbon dioxide flow into the<br>
SORFC fuel inlet.<br>
Thus, the first and second preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention enable a user to choose between multiple options for procuring<br>
electricity, heat, and fuels (hydrogen, hydrocarbons, or mixtures) using a<br>
high temperature electrochemical system. For example, a hydrocarbon<br>
fuel, such as natural gas or methane, can be used to generate a<br>
continuously variable amount of electricity and hydrogen rich streams<br>
when either or both electricity and hydrogen are needed or it is<br>
economically desirable to do so. In a preferred aspect of the present<br>
invention, a fuel, such as methane or hydrogen, or fuel mixtures can be<br>
produced from electricity and water, with or without carbon dioxide, when<br>
such fuels are needed or when desirable to do so for economic reasons<br>
and/or for carbon sequestration. In another preferred aspect of the<br>
present invention, energy or electricity may be stored efficiently in the<br>
form of hydrocarbon fuel, hydrogen, or fuel mixtures during times when<br>
electricity is relatively inexpensive compared with the cost of procuring the<br>
hydrocarbon fuel, hydrogen or fuel mixtures in order to effect peak<br>
shaving or enable the use of such stored electricity when the primary<br>
source of electricity is relatively expensive or unavailable.<br>
A general block diagram of the inputs and outputs in an SORFC<br>
system 200 of the second preferred embodiment is shown in Figure 2.<br>
The inputs into the SORFC stack 210 include two or more of the<br>
following: electricity, heat, hydrocarbon fuel or fuel mixtures, hydrogen<br>
fuel or fuel mixtures, air, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water. The outputs<br>
include two or more of the following: electricity, heat, hydrocarbon fuel or<br>
fuel mixtures, hydrogen fuel or fuel mixtures, oxygen, carbon dioxide,<br>
water, and exhaust.<br>
The SORFC system 200 is capable of electrolyzing water or water<br>
and carbon dioxide mixtures with the addition of electricity and heat. The<br>
SORFC system 200 generates hydrogen in an electrolysis mode when it<br>
electrolyzes water and generates a hydrocarbon fuel, such as methane,<br>
when it electrolyzes a water/carbon dioxide mixture. The SORFC system<br>
200 is capable of performing fuel cell reactions (i.e., operate in the<br>
electricity generating fuel cell mode) using any suitable fuel, such as<br>
hydrogen fuel, a carbon containing fuel, such as a hydrocarbon fuel, such<br>
as methane, propane or natural gas, and mixtures of hydrogen, hydrogen<br>
containing, carbon containing, and/or hydrocarbon fuels, and any suitable<br>
oxidizer, such as air, purified oxygen or mixtures thereof. In fuel cell<br>
mode, reformation reactions within the fuel stack result in the formation of<br>
free hydrogen as discussed above.<br>
Thus, the system 200 can be operated to perform one or more of<br>
the following functions. The system 200 can produce hydrogen and<br>
oxygen from electricity, heat, and water in the electrolysis mode. The<br>
system 200 can produce methane and oxygen from carbon dioxide, water,<br>
and electricity in the electrolysis mode. The system 200 can produce<br>
hydrogen from a carbon and hydrogen containing fuel in a fuel cell mode,<br>
as described with respect to the first embodiment. The system 200 can<br>
generate any one or more of electricity, heat, water and carbon dioxide<br>
from a carbon containing fuel, hydrogen, or fuel mixtures and oxygen or<br>
air in the fuel cell mode. The system 200 also enables real-time arbitrage<br>
between buying and selling electricity from different sources (e.g., grid<br>
power vs. fuel cell generation using hydrocarbon fuel, hydrogen, or fuel<br>
mixtures that are purchased or previously generated and stored for later<br>
use).<br><br>
The SORFC system 200 has many different uses. For example, the<br>
system 200 may be connected to a primary source of power for<br>
purchasing power when desirable and/or for selling power back to the grid<br>
when desirable. Operating decisions can be made by a human operator<br>
and/or can be under computer operator control in order to make decisions<br>
based on time-dependent economic factors. One time dependent<br>
economic factor is a time variable cost of electricity to the operator or<br>
charged by the operator which depends on time of day, day of the week,<br>
season, local weather, etc. Another time dependent economic factor is<br>
the cost of natural gas or other hydrocarbon fuel charged to the operator<br>
which depends on season, local weather, or other time dependent factors.<br>
A third time dependent economic factor is a user's time dependent needs<br>
for hydrogen to be used as a commodity, such as for a transportation fuel,<br>
in addition to its utility for energy storage.<br>
The net electrolysis reaction is xCO2 + 2(x + y)H2O = xCH4 + 2yH2<br>
+ (2x + y)O2, where x and y are continuously variable by the operator, and<br>
can equal zero. The net fuel cell reaction is: XCH4 + 2YH2 + (2X + Y)O2<br>
= XCO2 + 2(X + Y)H2O, where X and Y are continuously variable by the<br>
operator. By varying the amount of carbon dioxide in the electrolysis<br>
mode, the system 200 may be used to generate the desired amount of<br>
hydrogen, methane and mixtures thereof, based on the demand for and/or<br>
the price of hydrogen and methane. Thus, a human or a computer<br>
operator may vary the carbon dioxide to water ratio provided into the<br>
SORFC stack 210 in the electrolysis mode to obtain a desired amount of<br>
methane and/or hydrogen. If no carbon dioxide or other carbon bearing<br>
gasses are provided into the SORFC stack 210, then the stack 210<br>
generates pure hydrogen. If mostly carbon dioxide or other carbon bearing<br>
gas along with a small amount of water are provided into the SORFC stack<br>
210 in the electrolysis mode, then the system generates mostly methane.<br>
The hydrogen and/or methane generated in the electrolysis mode may be<br>
separated from each other by a hydrogen separator and stored for future<br>
use when the system 200 operates in the fuel cell mode or may be put to<br>
other uses outside the system 200, such as for use in transportation (i.e.,<br>
to power a vehicle if the system 200 is located in a vehicle), power<br>
generation, heating or in chemical reactions (i.e., to be used in<br>
hydrogenation).<br>
Thus, it is advantageous to store carbon dioxide and other carbon<br>
containing gases, such as unused fue! present in the tail gas, produced by<br>
the system 200 in the fuel cell mode rather than venting these gases into<br>
the air. First, storing carbon containing gases reduces environmental<br>
pollution. Second, the stored carbon containing gases, such as carbon<br>
dioxide can be fed back into the SORFC stack 210 in the electrolysis mode<br>
when it is desired to generate and store methane.<br>
The systems 100, 120, 130, 140, 200 of the preferred embodiment<br>
are advantageous because they can be used to simultaneously generate<br>
both electrical power and hydrogen in the fuel cell mode. An example is<br>
an apartment or office complex, whose tenants will use electrical power<br>
within their residences or offices and hydrogen to fuel their vehicles.<br>
Another example may be a manufacturing plant that requires electrical<br>
power for operations and hydrogen for processing, cooling, or for<br>
transportation of goods. Additionally, the systems 100, 120, 130, 140,<br>
200 of the preferred embodiments are advantageous because they allow<br>
the real-time economic trade between production of hydrogen streams via<br>
electrolysis of water using grid power, and the production of hydrogen<br>
streams and electricity by operating the fuel cell stack in the fuel cell mode<br>
with internal reforming of the fuel containing bound hydrogen.<br>
Figures 3-7 illustrate the preferred components of the systems 100,<br>
120, 130, 140 and 200 of the first and second preferred embodiments.<br>
While a SORFC system is described with respect to Figures 3-7, it should<br>
be noted that a SOFC system may also be used instead, except that the<br>
SOFC system does not operate in the electrolysis mode.<br>
A single SORFC 10 operating in the electrolysis mode is shown in<br>
Fig. 3. The SORFC contains an anode electrode, an electrolyte and a<br>
cathode electrode. Anode electrode 11 is preferably a porous electrode<br>
comprising perovskites, metals and/or cermets. Preferably, the anode<br>
electrode comprises a perovskite material. Cathode electrode 12 is also<br>
preferably a porous electrode comprising platinum or platinum family<br>
metals. Preferably, the cathode electrode comprises platinum. Solid oxide<br>
electrolyte 13 is sheet of ceramic material, such as yttria stabilized<br>
zirconia. Electrodes 11 and 12 are attached to electrolyte 13. An anode<br>
gas chamber 14 is formed between the electrolyte 13 and an anode side<br>
interconnect (not shown for simplicity). A cathode gas chamber 15 is<br>
formed between the electrolyte 13 and a cathode side interconnect (also<br>
not shown for simplicity).<br>
A gas mixture 17 containing primarily water vapor and optionally<br>
carbon dioxide is introduced into the cathode gas chamber 15. A direct<br>
current power source (not shown) is connected to the anode electrode 11<br>
and the cathode electrode 12 in such a way that when electrical current is<br>
flowing, the anode electrode 11 takes on a positive voltage charge and the<br>
cathode electrode 12 takes on a negative voltage charge. When the<br>
electric current is flowing, the gas mixture 17 containing primarily water<br>
vapor and carbon dioxide gives up oxygen ions 16 to form cathode<br>
discharge mixture 19 consisting primarily of hydrogen and carbon<br>
monoxide. Oxygen ions 16 transport across the electrolyte 13 under the<br>
electrical current. The oxygen ions 16 are converted into oxygen gas 18<br>
on the anode electrode 11 under the influence of the electrical current.<br>
The oxygen gas 18 is discharged from the anode chamber 14.<br>
A single SORFC 20 operating in the fuel cell mode is shown in Fig.<br>
4. SORFC 20 is the same as SORFC 10, except that the cathode and<br>
anode designations of its electrodes are reversed. Cathode electrode 21 is<br>
the same electrode as that identified as the anode electrode 11 in Fig. 3<br>
when operating in the electrolysis mode. Anode electrode 22 is the same<br>
electrode as that identified as the cathode electrode 12 in Fig. 3 when<br>
operating in the electrolysis mode. Solid oxide electrolyte 23 is the same<br>
electrolyte as that identified as electrolyte 13 in Fig. 3 when operating in<br>
the electrolysis mode. Cathode gas chamber 24 is the same gas chamber<br>
as that identified as the anode gas chamber 14 in Fig. 3 when operating in<br>
the electrolysis mode. Anode gas chamber 25 is the same gas chamber as<br>
that identified as the cathode gas chamber 15 in Fig. 3 when operating in<br>
the electrolysis mode.<br>
A gas mixture 27 containing water vapor and methane is introduced<br>
into the anode gas chamber 25. Oxygen gas 28 is introduced into the<br>
cathode chamber 24. An electrical fuel cell load (not shown) is applied to<br>
the SORFC 20 and the oxygen gas 28 forms oxygen ions 26 under the<br>
influence of the electrical load. Oxygen ions 26 transport across the<br>
electrolyte 23 under the influence of the electrical current. On the anode<br>
electrode 22, the oxygen ions 26 combine with carbon and hydrogen from<br>
gas mixture 27 to form gas mixture 29 containing carbon dioxide, water<br>
vapor and hydrogen. Gas mixture 29 is discharged from the anode<br>
chamber. In the process described above, the SORFC 20 has made<br>
electrical energy or power, which is output through its electrodes.<br>
A Sabatier reactor subsystem 30 is shown in Fig. 5. The reactor<br>
tube 31 contains a catalyst, such as a platinum family metal on an alumina<br>
support. Preferably, the catalyst comprises ruthenium. A gas mixture 32<br>
consisting primarily of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is introduced into<br>
reactor tube 31 and contacts the catalyst therein. The gas mixture 32<br>
undergoes an immediate exothermic reaction and produces gas mixture 33<br>
consisting primarily of methane and water vapor. Gas mixture 33 is then,<br>
discharged from the reactor tube 31. When the Sabatier reactor is used<br>
with the SORFC 10 operating in the electrolysis mode, the hydrogen and<br>
carbon monoxide discharge mixture 19/32 is provided from the SORFC<br>
into the Sabatier reactor 30.<br>
Because the reaction within reactor tube 31 is highly exothermic, a<br>
heat exchanger 34 is used to capture the generated heat. Gas mixture 35,<br>
consisting primarily of carbon dioxide and water, flows through heat<br>
exchanger 34 to absorb the exothermic reaction heat. When the Sabatier<br>
reactor is used with the SORFC 10 operating in the electrolysis mode, the<br>
water vapor and carbon dioxide inlet mixture 17/35 is heated in the<br>
Sabatier reactor by the reaction of the outlet or discharge mixture 19/32.<br>
The water vapor and carbon dioxide inlet mixture 17/35 is then provided<br>
from the Sabatier reactor into the SORFC 10.<br>
The SORFC systems 50A, 50B of preferred embodiments operating<br>
in a fuel cell mode are shown in Figs. 6A and 6B as simplified schematics.<br>
A single SORFC 20 previously shown in Fig. 4 as a cross section operating<br>
in the fuel cell mode is shown again in Figs. 6A and 6B. While a single<br>
SORFC is shown, it should be understood that the systems 50A, 50B<br>
contains a plurality of SORFC stacks.<br>
The system 50A contains one hydrogen separator 113 as shown in<br>
Figure 6A. The system 50B contains two hydrogen separators 113A,<br>
113B, as shown in Figure 6B. A valve 111 A, 111B, such as a three way<br>
valve, or another similar device, may be used to control the amount of<br>
hydrogen provided into conduit 112 and into subsystem 115. If desired,<br>
the vaive 111 A, 111B and conduit 112 are omitted and all hydrogen<br>
recovered by the hydrogen separator is provided into subsystem 115.<br>
An enthalpy recovery unit 52 transfers water vapor from a first gas<br>
stream to a second gas stream. The enthalpy recovery unit 52 can be a<br>
device which transfers water vapor based on cyclic desiccant beds or a<br>
rotating desiccant wheel. The desiccant wheel (i.e., "enthalpy wheel") is<br>
preferred. Purge valve 53 is a normally closed powered open solenoid<br>
valve. A heat exchanger 54 is a counter flow gas-gas heat exchanger.<br>
The SORFC power output, such as output electrode(s), is connected to a<br>
power distribution system. The oxidizer (i.e., oxygen or air) enters the<br>
systems 50A, 50B through the oxidizer inlet or conduit 55, while the fuel<br>
enters the systems through the fuel inlet or conduit arrangement 56/57.<br>
The fuel side exhaust exits through conduit arrangement 58/59.<br>
One preferred method of operating the system 50A in the fuel cell<br>
mode is now described. Within the SORFC system 50A shown in Fig. 6A,<br>
pure oxygen reactant gas is delivered from an oxygen storage vessel, such<br>
as a liquid oxygen tank, to the cathode chamber of SORFC 20 through<br>
inlet conduit 55. The oxygen reactant, being highly pure, is normally dead<br>
headed within the cathode chamber of SORFC 20. However, even the<br>
purest of gases will include trace non reactant gas species. As a result<br>
the cathode chamber of SORFC 20 must be occasionally purged of these<br>
non reactant species. Oxygen purge valve 53 is used to accomplish this<br>
purging.<br>
A fuel inlet stream, such as a carbon containing gas stream,<br>
preferably a hydrocarbon gas stream, is introduced into the SORFC system<br>
50A from a fuel storage vessel, such as a tank (not shown for clarity),<br>
through conduit 56. Preferably, the fuel inlet stream is a methane stream.<br>
The hydrogen separator 113 preferably transfers hydrogen gas from the<br>
fuel side exhaust outlet stream in conduit 58 into the fuel inlet stream in<br>
conduit 56 through conduit 112. The recirculated hydrogen supports a<br>
uniform methane reformation process within the anode chamber of SORFC<br>
20. The methane and hydrogen mixture next is introduced into the<br>
enthalpy recovery unit 52, where a portion of the water vapor is<br>
transferred from the fuel side exhaust outlet stream in conduit 58 into the<br>
methane and hydrogen inlet stream. Preferably, the enthalpy recovery unit<br>
also transfers heat from the outlet stream to the inlet stream. From the<br>
enthalpy recovery unit 52, the methane, hydrogen and water vapor<br>
mixture is introduced into the heat exchanger 54, where the gas mixture<br>
temperature is increased near to the operational temperature of 600C to<br>
1000C using the high temperature waste heat from the outlet stream in<br>
conduit 58. From heat exchanger 54, the hot mixture of methane,<br>
hydrogen, and water vapor is delivered to the anode chamber of SORFC<br>
20 through conduit 57. Some steam reformation of the methane will<br>
occur in the heat exchanger 54 and conduit 57 but the amount is<br>
suppressed by the existence of the hydrogen. The completion of the<br>
steam reforming of the methane is accomplished in the anode chamber of<br>
the SORFC 20.<br>
Within the anode chamber of the SORFC 20, the steam reforming of<br>
methane and the oxidation of carbon and hydrogen in the fuel cell<br>
reactions converts the discharged gas mixture (i.e., fuel side exhaust) in<br>
conduit 58 to carbon dioxide, additional water vapor, and excess<br>
hydrogen. The discharged gas mixture in conduit 58 passes through heat<br>
exchanger 54, releasing waste heat, and then through the enthalpy<br>
recovery unit 52 to supply a portion of the water vapor to support the<br>
input methane reformation. The discharged gas mixture in conduit 58 is<br>
then directed to the hydrogen separator 113. The hydrogen separator 113<br>
separates hydrogen from the gas mixture. An optional valve 111A, such<br>
as a three way valve or a similar device, separates the recovered hydrogen<br>
flowing from separator 113 into two streams. The first hydrogen stream<br>
is directed back into the fuel inlet stream in conduit 56 through conduit<br>
112. The other hydrogen stream is directed to the subsystem 115<br>
through the optional hydrogen conditioner 114. By varying the valve<br>
111A position, the amount of hydrogen provided into each of the two<br>
streams may be varied, or one of the streams may be shut off as desired.<br>
The outlet or tail gas mixture in conduit 59 from the hydrogen separator<br>
113 contains only carbon dioxide and water which are stored separately<br>
(not shown).<br>
An alternative preferred method uses two hydrogen separators<br>
113A and 113B of the system 50B, as shown in Figure 6B. The<br>
discharged gas mixture in conduit 58 from the enthalpy recovery unit 52 is<br>
directed to the valve 111B. The valve 111B separates the gas mixture<br>
into two streams or portions. The first stream or portion is provided to the<br>
first hydrogen separator 113A. The first hydrogen separator 113A<br>
separates the hydrogen from the discharged fuel side exhaust stream and<br>
provides the separated hydrogen though conduit 112 back into conduit<br>
56. The second stream or portion is provided to the second hydrogen<br>
separator 113B. The hydrogen separator 11 3B separates the hydrogen<br>
from the discharged fuel side exhaust stream and provides the separated<br>
hydrogen though optional conditioner 114 into subsystem 115. By<br>
varying the valve 111B position, the amount of hydrogen provided into<br>
conduit 112 and subsystem 115 may be varied or hydrogen may be<br>
provided only into one of the conduit 112 and subsystem 115, as desired.<br>
The outlet or tail gas mixture in conduit 59 from the hydrogen separators<br>
113A, 113B contains only carbon dioxide and water which are stored<br>
separately (not shown). Other aspects of the method of using system 50B<br>
are the same as in the method of using system 50A, and are not repeated.<br>
The SORFC system 60 of a preferred embodiment operating in an<br>
electrolysis mode is shown in Fig. 7 as a simplified schematic. A single<br>
SORFC 10 previously shown in Fig. 3 as a cross section operating in the<br>
electrolysis mode is shown again in Fig. 7.<br>
The Sabatier reactor subsystem 30, described with respect to Fig.<br>
5, converts carbon monoxide and hydrogen into methane and water vapor.<br>
The heat exchanger 54 is a counter flow gas-gas heat exchanger. Carbon<br>
dioxide and water enter the system 60 through inlet or conduit 61, which<br>
may be the same or different than conduit 56, shown in Fig. 6A. The<br>
generated oxygen exits through outlet or conduit 65, while the methane<br>
and water exit through outlet or conduit arrangement 63/64. Conduits<br>
63/64 and 65, respectively, may be the same or different conduits as<br>
conduits 58/59 and 55, respectively, shown in Fig. 6A.<br>
Thus, the system 60 operating in the electrolysis mode is the same<br>
system as system 50 operating in the fuel cell mode, except that the inlet<br>
and outlet streams are steered through the Sabatier reactor subsystem 30<br>
instead of through the enthalpy recovery unit 52, which remains inactive<br>
in the electrolysis mode. The inlet and outlet streams may be steered<br>
using valves and parallel conduits (not shown for clarity). Furthermore,<br>
the electrode designations in the SORFC 10 of system 60 are reversed<br>
compared to SORFC 20 of system 50, as explained in detail with respect<br>
to Figs. 3 and 4 above.<br>
A method of operating the system 60 in the electrolysis mode is<br>
now described. Carbon dioxide and water are introduced into the SORFC<br>
system 60 through conduit 61 from water source 71 (such as a water<br>
pipe or water storage vessel) and carbon dioxide 73 storage vessel. A<br><br>
valve 75 controls the amount of carbon dioxide provided into conduit 61.<br>
Alternatively, a three way valve may be used in conduit 61 to control the<br>
relative amounts of water and carbon dioxide flowing through the conduit.<br>
If the valve 75 is closed, then no carbon dioxide is provided into the<br>
conduit 61, and the system 60 produces a hydrogen fuel. In this case, the<br>
exhaust from the fuel cell stack 10 may be diverted around the Sabatier<br>
subsystem 30 by using bypass valves and conduits (not shown for clarity).<br>
If the valve 75 is open, the system 60 produces a hydrocarbon fuel.<br>
Within the hydrogen separator 113, hydrogen gas is transferred<br>
from the outlet stream in conduit 63 into the carbon dioxide and water<br>
inlet stream in conduit 61. This extra hydrogen eventually assures that all<br>
the carbon bearing gases are converted into methane within the Sabatier<br>
reactor subsystem 30. The carbon dioxide, water, and hydrogen inlet<br>
mixture next is introduced into the Sabatier subsystem 30 heat exchanger<br>
where it is heated by the exothermic- reaction. From the Sabatier<br>
subsystem 30, the carbon dioxide, hydrogen and water vapor mixture is<br>
introduced into the heat exchanger 54, where the gas mixture temperature<br>
is increased further to near to the operational temperature of 600C to<br>
1000C using the high temperature waste heat from the outlet stream in<br>
conduit 63. From heat exchanger 54, the hot mixture of carbon dioxide,<br>
hydrogen, and water vapor is delivered to the cathode chamber of SORFC<br>
10 through conduit 62. Within the cathode chamber of SORFC 10, the<br>
carbon dioxide and water vapor are reduced by electrolysis to carbon<br>
monoxide and hydrogen. Excess water and some unreacted carbon<br>
dioxide will be discharged from the cathode chamber of SORFC 10 along<br>
with the carbon monoxide and hydrogen through conduit 63.<br>
The discharged gas mixture in conduit 63 passes through heat<br>
exchanger 54 releasing waste heat to the inlet stream and then through<br>
the Sabatier subsystem 30 to convert all the carbon oxides to methane<br><br>
and water with the excess hydrogen. The discharged gas mixture in<br>
conduit 63 is then directed to the hydrogen separator 113 which can<br>
separate and transfer hydrogen to the inlet carbon dioxide and water<br>
stream and/or forward hydrogen to the hydrogen storage/use subsystem<br>
115. The outlet mixture in conduit 64 from hydrogen separator 113<br>
preferably contains only methane and water which are stored separately<br>
(not shown).<br>
In the meantime, pure oxygen gas is generated in the SORFC 10<br>
anode during the electrolysis process. The oxygen is discharged from the<br>
SORFC 10 anode through conduit 65. The oxygen can be discharged into<br>
the air, provided for direct metabolic use and/or provided for liquefied<br>
storage in a storage vessel (not shown). Preferably, the fuel cell systems<br>
described above have an active fuel cell system design and operate under<br>
a forced gas stream flow regime, rather than passive system design<br>
operating under an equilibrium/diffusion gas stream flow regime.<br>
However, passive systems may also be used, if desired.<br>
THIRD PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
While the preferred embodiments described above have been<br>
described as using a hydrocarbon and/or hydrogen fuel, other non-<br>
hydrocarbon carbon containing fuels may be used instead. For example,<br>
carbon monoxide, or other carbon bearing gases may be used as fuel for a<br>
solid oxide fuel cell. These non-hydrocarbon carbon containing fuel gases<br>
may optionally be mixed with hydrogen, water vapor, hydrocarbon gases<br>
and/or other gases. Thus, in another preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a non-hydrocarbon carbon containing fuel is used to operate the<br>
solid oxide fuel cell. The non-hydrocarbon carbon containing fuel may be<br>
used to operate the fuel cell with or without additional hydrocarbon and<br>
hydrogen containing gases, such as methane, natural gas, hydrogen and<br>
water vapor. In this embodiment, the fuel cell may be used with or<br>
without the hydrogen separator 113 and subsystem 115 described in the<br>
previous embodiments. The non-hydrocarbon carbon containing fuel<br>
preferably comprises at least 50 volume % of the fuel provided into the<br>
fuel cell, more preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least 95%, up<br>
to 100% of the fuel.<br>
The non-hydrocarbon carbon containing fuel may be obtained from<br>
several different sources. For example, the fuel may be provided into the<br>
SOFC or SORFC from a carbon monoxide storage vessel or conduit.<br>
Alternatively, the fuel may be provided from a coal source. One way to<br>
use a coal source is to gasify coal and to provide this gas into the fuel cell.<br>
Another way is to provide coal and carbon dioxide into a fluidized bed<br>
reactor to obtain carbon monoxide and to provide the carbon monoxide<br>
into the fuel cell. Another way is to gasify and partially oxidize coal with<br>
oxygen to obtain carbon monoxide and water vapor, then to provide a<br>
water gas shift reaction using a catalyst bed, such as a Ni catalyst bed to<br>
provide a carbon dioxide and hydrogen fuel mixture, all or part of which is<br>
provided into the fuel cell (i.e., the hydrogen may be separated). Another<br>
way is to react coal with water vapor at high temperature to generate<br>
carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas and to provide all or part of this gas<br>
mixture into the fuel cell (i.e., the hydrogen may be separated). The<br>
hydrogen in the fuel mixtures described above may be separated by a<br>
hydrogen separator before the fuel is provided into the fuel cell or from the<br>
fuel side exhaust exiting the fuel cell. The separated hydrogen may be<br>
provided into the subsystem 115 and/or recirculated into conduit 112.<br>
In one preferred aspect, the non-hydrocarbon carbon containing fuel<br>
excludes a reformed non-hydrocarbon carbon containing fuel, such as<br>
syngas, which was reformed in a reformer located in the electrochemical<br>
system from a hydrocarbon fuel, such as natural gas. In another preferred<br><br>
aspect, the non-hydrocarbon carbon containing fuel includes a reformed<br>
non-hydrocarbon carbon containing fuel, such as syngas, which was<br>
reformed in a reformer located in the electrochemical system from a<br>
hydrocarbon fuel, such as natural gas.<br>
For example, clean coal particulate is reacted with carbon dioxide in<br>
a fluidized bed to produce carbon monoxide. This carbon monoxide is<br>
reacted within a solid oxide fuel cell to produce electricity and carbon<br>
dioxide.<br>
Figure 8 provides a view of the fluidized bed reactor 300. The<br>
reactor includes a large quartz tube 301 or other reactor enclosure which<br>
can tolerate the high temperature reaction without itself entering into the<br>
reaction. Such a reactor can be used to react carbon and carbon dioxide<br>
into carbon monoxide at approximately 1000 °C. For example, the clean<br>
coal particulate is fed into the reactor 300 by a mechanical worm screw<br>
feed or other suitable feeder 303. The solid fuel is maintained at a level<br>
approximately one half of the reactor volume. Nickel catalyst particles are<br>
initially seeded within the reactor to encourage the reaction. As the solid<br>
carbon is converted to carbon monoxide the nickel catalyst is left behind in<br>
the reactor to support the conversion of additional coal. The carbon<br>
dioxide is fed into the hot zone 305 of the reactor through an inlet 307,<br>
such as a small quartz tube. Heat is applied to the reactor to bring the<br>
reactor to approximately 1000 °C. The product carbon monoxide is then<br>
delivered from the reactor 300 through an outlet conduit 309 to the fuel<br>
cell.<br>
Figure 9 shows the coal reactor 300 integrated into the entire solid<br>
oxide fuel cell system 400. In the system 400, the hot carbon monoxide<br>
from the reactor 300 is fed directly into the solid oxide fuel cell 20 anode<br>
22. At the same time, air is forced from blower 105 through an air/air<br>
heat exchanger 401 to obtain an appropriate temperature for introduction<br>
into the solid oxide fuel cell 21 cathode. Within the solid oxide fuel cell,<br>
oxygen ions pass through the solid oxide electrolyte 23 from the airside to<br>
the fuel side and react with the carbon monoxide to produce electricity<br>
and carbon dioxide. From a practical viewpoint, it is not possible to react<br>
all the carbon monoxide within the solid oxide fuel cell. This does not<br>
create a problem because heat energy is needed in the fluidized coal<br>
reactor bed to produce the carbon monoxide. The fuel anode exhaust gas<br>
is reacted with excess air from exchanger 401 in the catalyst combustion<br>
heater 403 that surrounds the fluidized bed reactor 300. All of the carbon<br>
monoxide is consumed in producing the required heat and only depleted air<br>
and carbon dioxide mixture is discharged from the heater 403. Before<br>
discharging this mixture to ambient, some of the carbon dioxide is<br>
preferably separated from the mixture by a carbon dioxide separator 405.<br>
If desired, the separated carbon dioxide can be blown back into the<br>
fluidized bed reactor 300 as the second reactant. An<br>
adsorption/absorption based separator 405 is used to separate the carbon<br>
dioxide from the other gases.<br>
Alternatively, the separated carbon dioxide may be stored in vessel<br>
73 to be later used with a SORFC in an electrolysis mode. Furthermore, if<br>
desired, the hydrogen separator 113 and other system components<br>
illustrated in Figures 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 6A, 6B, and 7 may be located<br>
between the fuel cell 20 and the heater 403. Thus, the tail gas containing<br>
CO and CO2 provided from the separator 113 outlet conduit 59 may be<br>
provided into the heater 403.<br>
The foregoing description of the invention has been presented for<br>
purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive<br>
or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed, and modifications<br>
and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be<br><br>
