				<td>DIRECTLY OPERATED PNEUMATIC VALVE<br>
HAVING AN AIR ASSIST RETURN<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The invention relates, generally, to pneumatic valve assemblies and, more<br>
specifically, to a directly operated pneumatic valve having an air assist return.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] Directly operated, or actuated, pneumatic valves are well known in the art for<br>
controlling the flow of pressurized air therethrough. Directly operated valves may be used alone<br>
or in connection with, for example, spool valves and regulators that, in turn, control the flow of<br>
pressurized air to and from various pneumatically actuated devices such as press clutches, air<br>
brakes, air cylinders or any other pneumatic device or application requiring precise control of<br>
operating air. More specifically, two-way, three-way and four-way direct operated valve<br>
assemblies are commonly employed in these environments. Such valves typically include a valve<br>
body having a valve bore formed in the valve body. A valve member is movably supported within<br>
the valve bore from one position to another in direct response to an operative force placed on the<br>
valve member by an actuator. A plurality of ports are used to connect the valve assembly to a<br>
system supply pressure as well as the various active devices that the valve may control. The<br>
actuator is typically an electromagnetically operated solenoid that is energized to move the valve<br>
member to a predetermined position within the valve bore. A return spring is often employed to<br>
bias the valve member back to a known non-energized position. Valves of this type are employed<br>
in a wide variety of manufacturing environments where a high flow rate and very fast response<br>
time are desired.<br>
[0003] As the technology for these valves has advanced, there has been an increase in the<br>
demand for smaller valves that are designed to be employed in operating environments with ever<br>
decreasing physical dimensions. In addition, the advance in technology has dictated that the<br>
valves must be able to operate with very fast cycle times. In fact, the demand for greater speed<br>
and shorter response time is an ongoing requirement for valves of this type. However, in the past,<br>
certain design barriers have limited the extent to which the size of the valve assembly could be<br>
reduced while at the same time increasing its speed. When the valve member and the valve bore<br>
are reduced below a predetermined size, the return spring may be of insufficient physical size and<br>
mechanical strength to overcome the inertia of the valve member. In addition, after the valve<br>
member has been biased in one direction by the actuator, frictional forces and surface adhesion<br>
can build up at the interface of the valve member seals and the valve bore. These frictional forces<br>
and related surface adhesion can act to inhibit movement of the valve member in the opposite<br>
direction and reduce valve speed and therefore increase valve response time. In this case, the<br>
return spring may be unable to provide enough biasing force to quickly or effectively move the<br>
valve member from its energized position and return it to the non-energized position when the<br>
actuator force is removed. When this occurs, accurate control of the active device is lost. To<br>
counter this shortcoming, various design strategies have emerged. However, the design strategies<br>
that have been proposed in the related art all suffer from the disadvantage that they add<br>
supplemental mechanisms, hardware, or require a remote mounting of the valve.<br>
[0004] For example, one design strategy proposed in the related art involves the use of<br>
dual electromagnetic actuators to move the valve member in opposite directions. Thus, the return<br>
spring is replaced by an electromagnetic actuator such as a solenoid. Unfortunately, this solution<br>
adds the complexity of a second solenoid and its associated parts, and also creates another size<br>
limiting boundary. On the other hand, single electromagnetic actuators that energize in both<br>
directions have been suggested in the related art. However, these single electromagnetic actuators<br>
require a bulkier double wound actuator as well as additional electronic circuitry and controls.<br>
Thus, directly operated valves that employ the bulkier single electromagnetic operators are<br>
typically mounted in a remote location relative to the pneumatically actuated device they control.<br>
Unfortunately, the remotely located valves defeat the purpose of smaller, lighter, and more<br>
accurate valve designs that can be mounted in very close proximity to the active devices. Also,<br>
they must be interconnected via conduits or other flow passages, which require additional<br>
hardware and plumbing, and can lower pneumatic efficiencies and introduce line losses within the<br>
system.<br>
[0005] While the use of the larger conventional valves, either remotely disposed or with<br>
the addition of other components, has generally worked for their intended purposes, there remains<br>
an ongoing need in the art to simplify pneumatic systems and thereby lower costs of manufacture<br>
and/or assembly by creating ever smaller, yet highly accurate, fast actuating, directly operated<br>
pneumatic valves. Smaller directly operated valves can be located in very close proximity to<br>
active system components, thereby shortening flow paths, reducing or eliminating additional<br>
plumbing and hardware, and increasing pneumatic flow efficiency. Unfortunately, the design<br>
strategies that have been proposed in the related art have failed to overcome the problems created<br>
when the valve member and bore are reduced in size past the point where a return spring has the<br>
physical size and mechanical force to quickly, effectively, and repeatedly return the valve member<br>
of a fast acting valve to the non-energized position.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] The present invention overcomes these design barriers and other disadvantages of<br>
the related art in a directly operated valve assembly. More specifically, the present invention is<br>
directed toward a directly operated valve assembly including a valve body having a pressurized<br>
air supply inlet port in communication with a source of pressurized air, and at least one cylinder<br>
port. A valve bore extends axially within the valve body, and a valve member is moveably<br>
supported within the valve bore between predetermined positions to selectively direct pressurized<br>
air from the inlet port through the cylinder port. An actuator is mounted to the valve body for<br>
moving the valve member in a first direction and a biasing member is disposed between the valve<br>
member and the valve body to provide a biasing force to the valve member in an opposite<br>
direction. Also, an air-assist passage is included for providing a source of pneumatic pressure that<br>
acts in combination with the biasing member to operatively move the valve member in a direction<br>
opposite to the movement induced by the actuator.<br>
r00071 The directly operated valve assembly of the present invention has distinct<br>
advantages over the valves known in the related art. The air-assist passage provides a source of<br>
pneumatic pressure from the pressurized cylinder port that acts in combination with the biasing<br>
member to operatively move the valve member in a direction opposite to the movement induced<br>
by the actuator. Importantly, the air assist facilitates a faster acting valve. More specifically,<br>
valve assemblies employing the air assist of the present invention may include a smaller biasing<br>
member that generates less force than would be required without the air assist. Because the<br>
biasing member generates less force, the actuator has less force to overcome and therefore moves<br>
the valve member to its first position faster. In addition, the biasing member, along with the air<br>
assist provided through the passage, will be able to quickly and efficiently move the valve member<br>
away from its second, or energized, position once the solenoid assembly is de-energized. The air-<br>
assist passage provides the necessary mechanical impetus to assist in moving the valve member<br>
to the de-energized position.<br>
[0008] Thus, the directly operated valve assembly of the present invention overcomes the<br>
shortcoming and drawbacks of conventional valve assemblies when they are so reduced in size<br>
such that the biasing member alone is of insufficient physical size and mechanical strength to<br>
repeatedly, quickly, and efficiently overcome the inertia of the valve member and/or exceed the<br>
fiictional adhesion forces acting at the valve bore. This allows a very fast acting valve assembly<br>
to be constructed in sizes below the conventional standards.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
[0016] Referring now to the figures where like numerals are used to designate like<br>
structure throughout the drawings, one embodiment of a directly operated valve assembly of the<br>
present invention is generally indicated at 10 in Figures 1-3. The valve assembly 10 includes a<br>
valve body 12 and an electromagnetic actuator, generally indicated at 14, mounted to the valve<br>
body 12. The valve body 12 has a thin rectangular shape defining top and bottom surfaces 16,<br>
18, respectively, a pair of opposed side surfaces 20, 22 extending between the top and bottom<br>
surfaces 16 and 18 and end surfaces 24, 26. The actuator, shown as solenoid assembly 14, is<br>
mounted to the end surface 24 of the valve body 12.<br>
[0017] Referring now to Figures 2 and 3, the valve body 12 includes a pressurized fluid<br>
inlet port 30 for communicating with a source of pressurized fluid, such as air. Furthermore, the<br>
valve body 12 includes at least one cylinder port 32. A valve bore 36 extends axially through the<br>
valve body 12. In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 - 3, the directly operated valve<br>
assembly 10 is a three-way valve and includes at least one cylinder port 32, and at least one<br>
exhaust port 38 each in fluid communication with the valve bore 36. In this embodiment, the<br>
cylinder port 32 is formed through the top surface 16 of the valve body 12 opposite the inlet port<br>
30 and the exhaust port 38 is formed through the bottom surface 18. However, those having<br>
ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the various ports may be formed through various,<br>
different, surfaces of the valve body 12. For example, these ports and passages may all be formed<br>
through one surface, such as the bottom 18 of the valve body 12, without departing from the<br>
scope of the invention. The inlet port 30, exhaust and cylinder ports 38 and 32, respectively may<br>
also be threaded to accommodate any mechanism necessary to establish fluid communication with<br>
another component that is operatively associated with the valve assembly 10. To this end, the<br>
valve body 12 is adapted to be mounted to a manifold, sub-base, or any of a number of various<br>
pneumatically actuated devices (not shown).<br>
[0018] As shown in Figures 2-3, the valve bore 36 extends completely through the valve<br>
body 12 to present a pair of open ends 42, 44. A valve member, generally indicated at 46, is<br>
movable between predetermined positions within the valve bore 36 to selectively direct<br>
pressurized air from the inlet port 30 through the cylinder port 32 and the exhaust port 38 as will<br>
be described in greater detail below. A pair of end retainers 48 and 50 are received in the pair of<br>
open ends 42, 44, respectively, of the valve body 12 and act to retain the valve member 46 within<br>
the valve bore 36 as will be described in greater detail below.<br>
[0019] The valve member 46 further includes a pair of opposed valve heads 60 and 62<br>
disposed at either end of the valve member 46 and at least one valve element 54, 56 that is formed<br>
on the valve member 46 between the opposed valve heads 60, 62. The valve element 54, 56 is<br>
operable to selectively direct a flow of pressurized air from the inlet port 30 through the valve<br>
bore 36 to either the cylinder port 32 or exhaust port 38. Each of the end retainers 48, 50 has a<br>
central bore 74, 76, respectively, that receives opposite heads 60, 62 of the valve member 46 and<br>
allows the valve member to slidingly move within the valve body 12. As best shown in Figure 3,<br>
the valve member 46 includes annular grooves 70 that receive o-ring type seals 72 that slidingly<br>
engage the central bore openings 74, 76, respectively, defined in the end retainers 48, 50 to<br>
prevent leakage of pressurized air within the valve bore 36. In one embodiment, the valve<br>
member 46 may be a poppet valve that is supported within the valve bore 36 for reciprocal<br>
movement therein to control the flow of fluid through the valve body 12. In this case, the poppet<br>
valve member 46 is preferably an aluminum insert over molded and bonded with rubber in specific<br>
areas of the valve member 46 and ground to specific dimensions to form, for example, the valve<br>
elements 54, 56. However, from the description that follows, those having ordinary skill in the<br>
art will appreciate that the present invention is not limited in any way to use in connection with<br>
a poppet valve. Rather, the present invention may be employed in connection with any other<br>
directly operated valve including, but not limited to, for example, spool valves, flat rubber poppet<br>
valves, flapper valves, pilot valves, or valve assemblies employed adjacent to or remote from the<br>
pneumatically actuated device.<br>
[0020] The end retainer 50 is cup-shaped and includes a plurality of cylinder passages 64<br>
defined in the end retainer 50 and spaced radially relative to one another. The cylinder passages<br>
64 provide fluid communication between the valve bore 36 and the respective adjacent ports. A<br>
biasing member 66 is positioned between the end retainer 50 and a recess 68 formed in one of the<br>
opposed valve heads 62 of the valve member 46. In the preferred embodiment, the biasing<br>
member is a coiled spring 66. However, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that<br>
any biasing mechanism commonly known in the art that is sufficient to provide a force in one<br>
direction may be suitable for use in this application. Furthermore, those having ordinary skill in<br>
the art will appreciate that, because of the sheer number of suitable biasing members that may be<br>
employed in this environment, it is not efficient to attempt to catalog all of them here. Rather, it<br>
should be sufficient for purposes of description and illustration to mention that the return spring<br>
66 applies a constant biasing force against the valve member 46 and to the left as viewed in<br>
Figures 2 and 3. Furthermore, the same is true with respect to the other embodiments described<br>
with respect to Figures 4-6 of the present application.<br>
[0021] A plurality of valve seats 84, 86 are presented in the valve bore 36. The valve<br>
seats 84 and 86 cooperate with the valve elements 54, 56 to seal the various passages in the valve<br>
body 12 as will be described in greater detail below. The valve seats 84, 86 provide sealing<br>
contact with the valve sealing surfaces of the valve elements 54, 56 when the valve member 46<br>
is in a closed position relative to a particular port thereby interrupting the flow of pressurized air<br>
in that port.<br>
[0022] At least one of the valve seats, and in this case valve seat 84, may be formed<br>
directly on the valve bore 36 itself. The other valve seat 86 may be defined near the terminal end<br>
51 of the end retainer 48 or 50. In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, the valve seat<br>
86 is disposed upon the terminal end 51 of the retainer 50. The end retainer 50 is threadably<br>
adjustable within the valve bore 36 of the valve body 12 and therefore may be adjustably<br>
positioned within the end 44 of the valve bore 36. Thus, the threadably set position of the end<br>
retainer 50 within the valve body 12 controls the sealing of the valve seats 84, 86 with a given<br>
force applied to the valve member 46. The position to which the terminal end 51 of the end<br>
retainer 50 is located within the valve bore 36 defines the predetermined "open" and "closed"<br>
positions of the valve assembly 10 and thereby sets the stroke length of the valve member 46. To<br>
prevent leakage of the pressurized air within the valve bore 36, the end retainer 50 further includes<br>
annular grooves 91 and 93 that receive o-ring type seals 92, and the valve body 12, at the end<br>
retainer 48, further includes an annular groove 80 that receives an o-ring type seal 82.<br>
[0023] As noted above and illustrated in Figures 1-3, the electromagnetic actuator 14 is<br>
a solenoid assembly mounted to the end surface 24 of the valve body 12. The poppet valve<br>
member 46 is actuated in one direction, or to the right as viewed in Figure 2, under the influence<br>
of the solenoid assembly 14. To this end, the solenoid assembly 14 includes a housing, generally<br>
indicated at 100. The housing 100 includes a pole plate 102 abutting the valve body 12, a cap 104<br>
disposed opposite the pole plate 102 and a solenoid can or frame 106 extending therebetween.<br>
The frame 106 supports a coil 108 including a conductive wire, schematically indicated at 110,<br>
conventionally wrapped around a bobbin 112. The conductive wire 110 is connected to a source<br>
of electrical current through leads, generally indicated at 114. The leads 114 are supported in the<br>
cap 104 and include lead pins 116, electrical contacts 118 and lead wires 120. The lead wires 120<br>
are operatively connected to a source of electrical current. The direction of the current through<br>
the coil 108 and thus the direction of the electromagnetic force generated thereby is controlled<br>
by a control circuit (not shown). A top plate 122 is mounted adjacent to the bobbin 112 and<br>
between a portion of the frame 106 and the cap 104.<br>
[0024] The pole plate 102 includes an opening 124 extending therethrough. The solenoid<br>
assembly 14 further includes a ferromagnetic pole piece 126 having a stepped portion 128 with<br>
a smaller cross-sectional area than the rest of the pole piece 126. The stepped portion 128 is<br>
received in the opening 124 of the pole plate 102 for mechanically fixing the pole piece 126 to the<br>
pole plate 102. A centrally located passage 131 extends through the pole piece 126. A pushpin<br>
132 is movably supported in the passage 131.<br>
[0025] A ferromagnetic armature 138 is disposed between the cap 104 and the pole piece<br>
126. A bushing 140 guides the armature 138 within the bobbin 112. The armature 138 is<br>
movable toward the pole piece 126 under the influence of an electromagnetic flux generated by<br>
a pulse of current flowing through the coil 108 in one direction. This flux drives the armature 138<br>
against the pushpin 132 to move the valve member 46 to the right as viewed in Figures 2-3 and<br>
to one predetermined position. Furthermore, the armature 138 is movable away from the pole<br>
piece 126 and toward the cap 104 (to the left as viewed in the Figures) under the influence of a<br>
force generated in the opposite direction as will be described in greater detail below.<br>
[0026] To this end, the pushpin 132 presents an enlarged head 142 which is disposed<br>
adjacent one end of the poppet valve member 46 for contacting it when the armature 138 contacts<br>
the pushpin 132.<br>
[0027] While a particular electromagnetically actuated device has been described above,<br>
the actuator employed with the valve assembly of the present invention may be of any known type<br>
used in pneumatic valves such as a self-latching electromagnetic solenoid of the type described<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 6,129,115 issued on October 10, 2000. Alternatively, the actuator may be an<br>
electromagnetic solenoid having a floating armature with lost-motion biasing such as described<br>
in prior art U.S. Patent Nos. 4,438,418 or 3,538,954. Each of these patents are assigned to the<br>
assignee of the present invention and the disclosures of these patents are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Thus, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate from the description that<br>
follows that the exact form of the actuator, whether electromagnetic or otherwise, forms no part<br>
of the present invention. It should be further appreciated from the description of the invention<br>
that follows that, although the preferred embodiment of the pneumatic valve assembly 10 of the<br>
present invention is depicted as a three-way valve in Figures 1-3, the present invention may also<br>
be alternately embodied in the form of a two-way valve (not shown), a four-way valve (as shown<br>
in Figure 4-5), or the like.<br>
[0028] When the valve member 46 has been moved by the solenoid assembly 14 to the<br>
right as illustrated in Figure 3, the valve element 56 is moved into sealing engagement with the<br>
valve seat 86 defined on the terminal end 51 of the end retainer 50. In this operative disposition,<br>
fluid communication between the inlet port 30 and the cylinder port 32 is established and<br>
pneumatic pressure may be delivered to any down stream device. However, when the valve<br>
member 46 is in this operative disposition, frictional and adhesive forces may be generated at the<br>
interface between the valve member 46 and the central bore openings 74, 76 of the end retainers<br>
48, 50. These forces act to resist the biasing force generated in the opposite direction by the<br>
biasing member 66 once the solenoid assembly 14 has been de-energized. Thus, these forces act<br>
to degrade the speed and efficiency at which the valve member 46 is returned to its first position.<br>
In addition, a reduction in the size of the biasing member 66 may result in a reduction of the force<br>
generated thereby resulting in a slower valve response time.<br>
[0029] In order to overcome this problem, the valve assembly 10 of the present invention<br>
includes an air-assist passage, generally indicated at 94. In the embodiment illustrated in Figures<br>
1-3, the air assist passage 94 is formed within the valve member 46 and provides fluid<br>
communication between at least one cylinder port 32 and the recess 68 in the valve head 62 of the<br>
valve member 46. Thus, the air assist passage 94 provides selective fluid communication between<br>
the source of pressurized air and the recess 68. More specifically, and as illustrated in Figures 2<br>
and 3, the air assist passage 94 includes an inlet portion 96 and a main passage 98. The inlet<br>
portion 96 extends radially relative to the centerline "A" of the valve member. In this<br>
representative embodiment, the inlet portion 96 is formed between valve elements 54, 56 and<br>
between the valve seats 84, 86 defined in the valve bore 36. The main passage 98 provides fluid<br>
communication between the inlet portion 96 and the recess 68. In this representative embodiment,<br>
the main passage 98 is coaxial relative to the longitudinal axis A of the valve member.<br>
[0030] The air-assist passage 94 provides a source of pneumatic pressure from the<br>
pressurized cylinder port 32 that acts in combination with the biasing member 66 to operatively<br>
move the valve member 46 in a direction opposite to the movement induced by the actuator 14.<br>
Importantly, the air assist facilitates a faster acting valve. More specifically, a valve assembly 10<br>
employing the air assist of the present invention may include a smaller biasing member 66 that<br>
generates less force than would be required without the air assist. Because the biasing member<br>
66 generates less force, the actuator 14 has less force to overcome and therefore moves the valve<br>
member 46 to its first position faster. In addition, the biasing member 66, along with the air assist<br>
provided through the passage 94, will be able to quickly and efficiently move the valve member<br>
46 away from its second, or energized, position once the solenoid assembly 14 is de-energized.<br>
The air-assist passage 94 provides the necessary mechanical impetus to assist in moving the valve<br>
member 46 to the de-energized position.<br>
[0031J Thus, the directly operated valve assembly of the present invention overcomes the<br>
shortcoming and drawbacks of conventional valve assemblies when they are so reduced in size<br>
such that the biasing member 66 alone is of insufficient physical size and mechanical strength to<br>
repeatedly, quickly, and efficiently overcome the inertia of the valve member 46 and/or exceed<br>
the frictional adhesion forces acting at the interface between the valve member 46 and the central<br>
bore openings 74 and 76 of the end retainer 48, 50. This allows a very fast acting valve assembly<br>
10 to be constructed in sizes below the conventional standards.<br>
[0032] Referring now to Figures 4-5, an alternate, non-limiting embodiment of a directly<br>
operated valve assembly having an air assist return of the present invention is generally indicated<br>
at 210, where like numerals increased by 200 with respect to the embodiment illustrated in Figures<br>
1-3 are used to designate like structure . The valve assembly 210 illustrated in Figures 4 and 5<br>
includes a valve body 212 having a pressurized fluid inlet port 230 for communicating with a<br>
source of pressurized fluid, such as air. Furthermore, the valve body 212 includes at least one<br>
cylinder passage, or outlet port 232, that is adapted for fluid communication with one or more<br>
pneumatically actuated devices. A valve bore 236 extends axially through the valve body 212.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated here, the pneumatic valve assembly 210 is a four-way valve and<br>
includes a pair of outlet ports 232, 234 and a pair of exhaust ports 238, 240 each in fluid<br>
communication with the valve bore 236. The outlet ports 232, 234 are formed through the top<br>
surface 216 of the valve body 212 opposite the inlet port 230 and exhaust ports 238, 240, which<br>
are formed through the bottom surface 218. However, those having ordinary skill in the art will<br>
appreciate that the inlet port 230, outlet and exhaust ports 232, 234 and 238, 240, respectively,<br>
may be formed through the various surfaces of the valve body 212. For example, these ports may<br>
all be formed through one surface, such as the bottom 218 of the valve body 212, without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention. The inlet port 230, outlet and exhaust ports 232, 234<br>
and 238, 240, respectively may also be threaded to accommodate any mechanism necessary to<br>
establish fluid communication with another element that is operatively associated with the valve<br>
assembly 210.<br>
[0033] In the preferred embodiment illustrated in Figures 4-5, the valve bore 236 may<br>
extend completely through the valve body 212 to present a pair of open ends 242, 244. A valve<br>
member, generally indicated at 246, is movably supported within the valve bore 236 between<br>
predetermined positions to selectively direct a flow of pressurized air from the inlet port 230<br>
through the valve bore 236 to at least one of the outlet ports 232, 234. Concomitantly, the valve<br>
member 246 may also selectively direct pressurized air to vent from at least one of the outlet ports<br>
232, 234 to at least one of the exhaust ports 238, 240, as will be described in greater detail below.<br>
A pair of end retainer inserts, generally indicated at 248 and 250, are received in the pair of open<br>
ends 242, 244 of the valve body 212, thereby retaining the valve member 246 within the valve<br>
bore 236 as will be described in greater detail below. Similarly, the valve assembly 210 may<br>
include one or more inner retainers that are threadably positioned within the valve bore 236. In<br>
the embodiment illustrated herein, the valve assembly 210 includes one inner retainer 251 that is<br>
threadably positionable within the valve bore 236 as will be described in greater detail below.<br>
[0034] The valve member 246 further includes a pair of opposed valve heads 260, 262<br>
disposed at either end of the valve member 246 and at least one valve element formed on the valve<br>
member 246 between the valve heads 260, 262. In the specific embodiment illustrated in Figures<br>
4 and 5, a plurality of valve elements 252, 254, 256, and 258 are formed on the valve member 246<br>
and are each operable to selectively direct a flow of pressurized air from an inlet port 230 through<br>
the valve bore 236 to the respective outlet ports 238, 240. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, the valve<br>
member 246 further includes annular grooves 270 that receive o-ring type seals 272, which<br>
slidingly engage the central bore openings 274, 276 respectively, of the retainer inserts 248, 250<br>
to prevent leakage of the pressurized air within the valve bore 236. In the preferred embodiment,<br>
the valve member 246 is an aluminum insert that is over-molded with a suitable resilient material<br>
such as rubber, or any known elastomer, in the appropriate places. More specifically, it should<br>
be appreciated by those having ordinary skill in the art that the material of the sealing surface may<br>
be made of any known composition that is slightly yielding, yet highly resilient, such as nitrile,<br>
which may be bonded, or over-molded to the valve element 246. However, from the description<br>
that follows, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the present invention is not<br>
limited in any way to use in connection with the specific valve illustrated in Figures 4-5. Rather,<br>
the present invention may be employed in connection with any other directly operated valve<br>
including, but not limited to, for example, spool valves, flat rubber poppet valves, flapper valves,<br>
pilot valves, or valve assemblies employed adjacent to or remote from the pneumatically actuated<br>
device.<br>
[0035] The end retainer inserts 248 and 250 each include a plurality of cylinder passages<br>
264 defined in the diameter of the retainers that spaced radially relative to one another. The<br>
cylinder passages 264 provide fluid communication between the valve bore 236 and the respective<br>
adjacent ports. A biasing member 266, such as a coiled spring, is positioned between the cup-<br>
shaped end retainer insert 250 and a recess 268 formed in one of the opposed valve heads 262 of<br>
the valve member 246. The return spring 266 applies a constant biasing force against the valve<br>
member 246 and to the left as viewed in Figures 4 and 5.<br>
[0036] A plurality of valve seats 282, 284, 286, and 288 are presented in the valve bore<br>
236. The valve seats 282, 284, 286, and 288 cooperate with the valve elements 252, 254, 256,<br>
and 258, respectively, to seal the various passages in the valve body 212 as will be discussed in<br>
greater detail below. The valve seats 282, 284, 286, and 288 provide a sealing contact with the<br>
valve sealing surfaces of the valve elements 252, 254, 256, and 258 when the valve member 246<br>
is in a closed position, relative to a particular outlet port, thereby interrupting the flow of<br>
pressurized air to that port.<br>
[0037] Of the plurality of valve seats 282, 284, 286, and 288 shown in Figures 4 and 5,<br>
some may be formed directly in the valve bore 236 itself, as in the case of valve seat 284, while<br>
others (e.g., valve seats 282, 286, and 288) may be disposed upon the end retainer inserts 248,<br>
250 and inner retainer 251. The retainer inserts 248, 250, and 251 may be adjustably positioned<br>
within the valve bore 236 of the valve body 212, having a threadable interaction with the ends<br>
242, 244 or any other suitable portion of the valve bore 236. As discussed above, each of the<br>
retainer inserts 248, 250 has a central bore 274, 276 that receives the opposed heads 260, 262 of<br>
the valve member 246 and allows it to slidingly move within the valve body 212. Thus, the<br>
threadably set position of the end retainer inserts 248, 250 within the valve body 212 controls the<br>
sealing of the valve seats with a given force applied to the valve member 246. The end retainer<br>
inserts 248, 250 further include annular grooves 291 and 293 which receive o-ring type seals 295<br>
to prevent leakage of the pressurized air within the valve bore 236. On the other hand, the<br>
positions to which the inner retainer insert 251 is threadably set defines the predetermined "open"<br>
and "closed" positions of the valve assembly 210 and thereby sets the stroke length of the valve<br>
member 246. And like the end retainer inserts, the inner retainer 251 may also include an annular<br>
groove 297 which is adapted to receive an o-ring type seal 299 so as to prevent leakage of the<br>
pressurized air within the valve bore 236.<br>
[0038] In the preferred embodiment, the central bore 274 of retainer insert 248, which<br>
receives the end 260 of the valve member 246 also extends fully through the retainer allowing the<br>
actuator assembly 214 to engage and thereby actuate the valve member 246. As shown for<br>
illustration purposes only, this may be accomplished by the use of an actuator pushpin 332 having<br>
an enlarged head 342 that extends into the retainer insert 248 to engage and actuate the valve<br>
member 246. As alluded to above, it should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that<br>
the specific actuating means used to provide motive force to the valve member 246 lies beyond<br>
the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, it should be further appreciated that any number<br>
of different types of actuating elements, rather than a push pin, may be employed based on the<br>
actuating means used. The actuator assembly 214, as previously mentioned, is used to selectively<br>
actuate the valve member 246 within the valve bore 236 in the direction opposite to the biasing<br>
force of the biasing member 266. In this manner, the actuator assembly 214 drives the valve<br>
member to the right, as shown in Figure 4, and the biasing member 266 returns the valve member<br>
246 to its original position (to the left, in Figure 5) when the actuator assembly 214 is deactivated.<br>
[0039] When the valve member 246 has been moved by the solenoid assembly 214 to the<br>
right as illustrated in Figure 4, the valve element 256 is moved into sealing engagement with the<br>
valve seat 286 defined on the inner retainer 251. In this operative disposition, fluid<br>
communication between the inlet port 230 and the cylinder port 232 is established and pneumatic<br>
pressure may be delivered to any down stream device. However, when the valve member 246 is<br>
in this operative disposition, rrictional and adhesive forces may be generated at the interface<br>
between the valve element 256 and valve seat 286. These forces act to resist the biasing force<br>
generated in the opposite direction by the biasing member 266 once the solenoid assembly 214<br>
has been de-energized. Thus, these forces act to degrade the speed and efficiency at which the<br>
valve member 246 is returned to its first position.<br>
[0040] In order to overcome this problem, an air-assist passage, generally indicated at<br>
294, is formed within the valve member 246 and extends between at least one cylinder port 232<br>
and the recess 268 in the valve head 262 of the valve member 246 to provide selective fluid<br>
communication between the source of pressurized air and the recess 294. More specifically, and<br>
as illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, the air assist passage 294 includes an inlet portion 296 and a main<br>
passage 298. The inlet portion 296 extends radially relative to the centerline A of the valve<br>
member. In this representative embodiment, the inlet portion 296 is formed between a pair of<br>
valve elements 252, 254. The main passage 298 provides fluid communication between the inlet<br>
portion 296 and the recess 268 formed in the head 262 of the valve member 246. In this<br>
representative embodiment, the main passage 298 is coaxial relative to the longitudinal axis A of<br>
the valve member 246.<br>
[0041] The air-assist passage 294 provides a source of pneumatic pressure from the<br>
pressurized cylinder port 232 that acts in combination with the biasing member 266 to operatively<br>
move the valve member 246 in a direction opposite to the movement induced by the actuator 214.<br>
Importantly, the air assist facilitates a faster acting valve. More specifically, the valve assembly<br>
210 employing the air assist of the present invention may include a smaller biasing member 266<br>
that generates less force than would be required without the air assist. Because the biasing<br>
member 266 generates less force, the actuator 214 has less force to overcome and therefore<br>
moves the valve member 246 to its first position faster. In addition, the biasing member 266,<br>
along with the air assist provided through the passage 294, will be able to quickly and efficiently<br>
move the valve member 246 away from its second, or energized, position once the solenoid<br>
assembly 214 is de-energized. The air-assist passage 294 provides the necessary mechanical<br>
impetus to assist in moving the valve member 246 to the de-energized position.<br>
[0042] Thus, the directly operated valve assembly of the present invention overcomes the<br>
shortcoming and drawbacks of conventional valve assemblies when they are so reduced in size<br>
such that the biasing member 266 alone is of insufficient physical size and mechanical strength to<br>
repeatedly, quickly, and efficiently overcome the inertia of the valve member 246 and/or exceed<br>
the factional adhesion forces acting at the interface of the valve member 246 and the central bore<br>
openings 274 and 276 of the end retainer inserts 248, 250. This allows a very fast acting valve<br>
assembly 210 to be constructed in sizes below the conventional standards.<br>
[0043] Referring now to Figures 6, another, alternate non-limiting embodiment of a<br>
directly operated valve assembly having an air assist return of the present invention is generally<br>
indicated at 310, where like numerals increased by 300 with respect to the embodiment illustrated<br>
in Figures 1-3 are used to designate like parts. More specifically, the valve assembly 310<br>
illustrated here is also a three-way valve and includes many of the same or similar components of<br>
the type described in connection with the three- and four-way valves illustrated in Figures 1-5.<br>
Accordingly, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the following description<br>
is presented in such a way so as to highlight the salient features of the present invention and does<br>
not include a restatement of the discussion of all like components of the valve assembly of the type<br>
described above.<br>
[0044] With this in mind, the valve assembly 310 includes a valve body 312 having a<br>
pressurized fluid inlet port 330 for communicating with a source of pressurized fluid, such as air.<br>
A valve bore 336 extends axially within the valve body 312. The valve body 312 also includes<br>
a cylinder port 332 and an exhaust port 338 both in fluid communication with the valve bore 336.<br>
A valve member 346 is moveably supported within the valve bore 336 and has a pair of opposed<br>
heads 360, 362. In addition, the valve member 346 includes at least one valve element 354, 356<br>
that is operable to selectively direct a flow of pressurized air from the inlet port 330 through the<br>
valve bore 336 to either the cylinder port 332 or the exhaust port 338. A plurality of valve seats<br>
384, 386 are presented in the valve bore 336. The valve seats 384 and 386 cooperate with the<br>
valve element 354, 356 to seal the various passages in the valve body 312 as will be described in<br>
greater detail below. The valve seats 384, 386 provide sealing contact with the valve sealing<br>
surfaces of the valve elements 354, 356 when the valve member 346 is in a closed position relative<br>
to a particular port thereby interrupting the flow of pressurized air in that port.<br>
[0045] Unlike the open ended valve bores illustrated in Figures 1-5, the valve bore 336<br>
is a blind bore having an open end 342 and a closed end 344. An electromagnetic actuator, such<br>
as a solenoid assembly, generally indicated at 314, is mounted to the valve body 312 at the open<br>
end 342 of the valve bore 336. The solenoid assembly 14 acts to bias the valve member 346 in<br>
one direction in the same manner as described with respect to the embodiments illustrated in<br>
Figures 1-5. On the other hand, a biasing member 366, such as a coiled spring, is positioned<br>
between the blind end 344 of the valve bore 336 and a recess 368 formed in one of the opposed<br>
valve heads 362 of the valve member 346. The return spring 366 applies a constant biasing force<br>
against the valve member 346 in a direction opposite to the force applied by the solenoid assembly<br>
314.<br>
[0046] When the valve member 346 has been moved by the solenoid assembly 314<br>
downwardly, relative to Figure 6, the valve element 356 is moved into sealing engagement with<br>
the valve seat 386 defined in the valve bore 336. In this operative disposition, fluid<br>
communication between the inlet port 330 and the cylinder port 332 is established and pneumatic<br>
pressure may be delivered to any downstream device. However, when the valve member 346 is<br>
in this operative disposition, frictional and adhesive forces may be generated at the interface<br>
between the seals 372 on the valve member 246 and the ends 342, 344 of the central bore 336.<br>
These forces act to resist the biasing force generated in the opposite direction by the biasing<br>
member 366 once the solenoid assembly 314 has been de-energized. As noted above, these forces<br>
act to degrade the speed and efficiency at which the valve member 346 is returned to its first<br>
position.<br>
[0047] In order to overcome this problem, an air assist passage, generally indicated at<br>
394, is formed within the valve body 312 and provides fluid communication between the cylinder<br>
port 332 and the recess 368 in the valve head 362 of the valve member 346. Thus, the air assist<br>
passage 394 provides selective fluid communication between the source of pressurized air and the<br>
recess 368. However, those having ordinary skill in the art will note that the air assist passage<br>
394 differs from the air assist passages 94 and 294 in that it is defined within the valve body 312<br>
as opposed to the valve member 46, 246. More specifically, and as illustrated in Figure 6, the air<br>
assist passage 394 includes an inlet portion 396 and a main passage 398. The inlet portion 396<br>
extends axially within the valve body 312 relative to the movement of the valve member 346 and<br>
provides fluid communication between the cylinder port 332 and the main passage 398. On the<br>
other hand, and in this representative embodiment, the main passage 398 extends transverse to<br>
the longitudinal axis A of the valve member 346 and provides fluid communication between the<br>
inlet portion 396 and the recess 368 formed in the valve head 362 of the valve member 346.<br>
[0048] The air-assist passage 394 provides a source of pneumatic pressure from the<br>
pressurized cylinder port 332 that acts in combination with the biasing member 366 to operatively<br>
move the valve member 346 in a direction opposite to the movement induced by the actuator 314.<br>
Importantly, the air assist facilitates a faster acting valve. More specifically, a valve assembly 310<br>
employing the air assist of the present invention may include a smaller biasing member 366 that<br>
generates less force than would be required without the air assist. Because the biasing member<br>
366 generates less force, the actuator 314 has less force to overcome and therefore moves the<br>
valve member 346 to its first position faster. In this way, the biasing member 366, along with the<br>
air assist provided through the passage 394, will be able to quickly and efficiently move the valve<br>
member 346 away from its energized, position once the solenoid assembly 314 is de-energized.<br>
The air-assist passage 394 provides the necessary mechanical impetus to assist in moving the<br>
valve member 346 to the de-energized position. Thus, the directly operated valve assembly of the<br>
present invention overcomes the shortcoming and drawbacks of conventional valve assemblies<br>
when they are so reduced in size such that the biasing member 366 alone is of insufficient physical<br>
size and mechanical strength to repeatedly, quickly, and efficiently overcome the inertia of the<br>
valve member 346 and/or exceed the frictional adhesion forces acting between the valve member<br>
346 and the valve bore 336. This allows a very fast acting valve assembly 310 to be constructed<br>
in sizes below the conventional standards.<br>
OPERATION<br>
[0049] The operation of the directly operated pneumatic valve having an air assist return<br>
of the present invention will now be described with reference to the three-way valve assembly 10<br>
illustrated in Figures 1-3. However, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the<br>
explanation of the operation of the valve illustrated in Figures 1-3 also applies with respect to the<br>
four-way valve illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 as well as the three-way valve illustrated in Figure<br>
6 and any other directly operated pneumatic valve that employs the air assist return of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0050] In operation, pressurized air is supplied to the inlet port 30. The pressurized air<br>
flows past a filter 31 disposed in that port and into the valve bore 36. When the solenoid<br>
assembly 14 is de-energized, the biasing member 66 biases the valve member 46 to the left as<br>
viewed in Figure 2 such that the valve element 54 is in sealing engagement with the valve seat 84.<br>
In this disposition, the valve element 56 is disposed spaced from the valve element 86 providing<br>
a flow passage between the cylinder port 32 and the valve bore 36. In this way, the cylinder port<br>
32 is vented through the main valve bore 36 and the cylinder passages 64 and into the exhaust<br>
port 38.<br>
[0051] On the other hand, when the solenoid assembly 14 is energized, it produces a force<br>
that drives the valve member 46 to the right as viewed in Figure 3 and against the biasing force<br>
of the biasing member 66. In this operative disposition, the valve element 54 is moved off of the<br>
valve seat 84 and the valve element 56 is quickly moved into sealing engagement with the valve<br>
seat 86. Pressurized air is then allowed to flow through the inlet port 30, past the filter 31, into<br>
the valve bore 36, past the open valve element 54 and valve seat 84, and into the cylinder port 32.<br>
On the other hand, the interaction of the valve element 56 and valve element 86 seals the cylinder<br>
port 32 with respect to the exhaust port 38. In addition, the air assist passage 94 is open to the<br>
pressurized air flowing through the valve bore 36 and cylinder port 32. Thus, the recess 68<br>
formed in the valve head 62 is similarly pressurized. However, the force generated by the<br>
solenoid assembly 14 is sufficient to overcome the oppositely directed force generated by this<br>
pressure.<br>
[0052] Once the solenoid assembly 14 is de-energized and the actuating force is removed<br>
from the valve head 60 of the valve member 46, the biasing member 66 and the air pressure acting<br>
on the valve head 62 cooperatively start to move the valve member 46 back to its first position.<br>
As this occurs, the valve element 56 that formed a seal in the energized position with the valve<br>
seat 86 will quickly move off valve seat 86, so that the cylinder port 32 that was pressurized (and<br>
providing the air-assist pressure) vents through the exhaust port 38. The valve member 46 is then<br>
moved to the left until the valve element 54 seals with the valve seat 84 and fluid communication<br>
between the cylinder port 32 and the exhaust port 38 is established past the valve element 56 and<br>
the valve seat 86 through the valve bore 36. It should be noted that, once the valve member 46<br>
is moving and any frictional or adhesion forces acting at the valve element 56 are overcome, the<br>
biasing member 66 has enough mechanical strength to continue to move the valve member 46 to<br>
its first de-energized position and the air-assist is no longer needed.<br>
[0053] The air-assist passage provides a source of pneumatic pressure from the<br>
pressurized cylinder port that acts in combination with the biasing member to operatively move<br>
the valve member in a direction opposite to the movement induced by the actuator. Importantly,<br>
the air assist facilitates a faster acting valve. More specifically, valve assemblies employing the<br>
air assist of the present invention may include a smaller biasing member that generates less force<br>
than would be required without the air assist. Because the biasing member generates less force,<br>
the actuator has less force to overcome and therefore moves the valve member to its first position<br>
faster. The biasing member, along with the air assist provided through the passage, will be able<br>
to quickly and efficiently move the valve member away from its second, or energized, position<br>
once the solenoid assembly is de-energized. The air-assist passage provides the necessary<br>
mechanical impetus to assist in moving the valve member to the de-energized position. Thus, the<br>
directly operated valve assembly of the present invention overcomes the shortcoming and<br>
drawbacks of conventional valve assemblies when they are so reduced in size such that the biasing<br>
member alone is of insufficient physical size and mechanical strength to repeatedly, quickly, and<br>
efficiently overcome the inertia of the valve member and/or exceed the frictional adhesion forces<br>
acting between the valve member and the central bore.<br>
[0054] The structure of the direct operated valve assembly 10, 210, and 310 of the<br>
present invention as described above has distinct advantages over the valves known in the related<br>
art. The valve assemblies 10, 210, and 310 are very fast acting. Further, the size limitations of<br>
convention valve assemblies are overcome and a range of smaller size valves become available.<br>
More specifically, the air-assist passage allows for a very fast acting valve assembly in a size<br>
much smaller than conventional designs. Thus, it is easily employed in environments where space<br>
is at a premium. The small size of the pneumatic valve of the present invention is facilitated by<br>
the air-assist passage providing a supplemental force of pressurized air to the biasing member.<br>
Furthermore, and from the foregoing description, those having ordinary skill in the art will readily<br>
appreciate that the air assist passage may be formed anywhere, either within the valve body, the<br>
valve member, partially exterior of the valve body, or any combination of these to provide a<br>
source of pneumatic pressure that acts in combination with the biasing member to operatively<br>
move the valve member in the direction opposite to the movement induced by the actuator.<br>
[0055] Once again, from the foregoing description, those having ordinary skill in the art<br>
will appreciate that the present invention is not limited in any way to use in connection with a<br>
poppet valve. Rather, the present invention may be employed in connection with any other<br>
directly operated valve including, but not limited to, for example, spool valves, flat rubber poppet<br>
valves, flapper valves, pilot valves, or valve assemblies employed adjacent to or remote from the<br>
pneumatically actuated device.<br>
[0056] The invention has been described in an illustrative manner. It is to be understood<br>
that the terminology that has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description<br>
rather than of limitation. Many modifications and variations of the invention are possible in light<br>
of the above teachings. Therefore, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may<br>
be practiced other than as specifically described.<br>
