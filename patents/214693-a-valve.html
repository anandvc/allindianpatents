				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a valve.<br>
^For various reason it is sometimes necessary to put valves in series i.e. one after the other in a pipeline. However for valves particularly used in larger diameter pipelines e.g. 12 inches (approximately 300 mm) and greater because of the size of associated actuators, handles and other equipment and often space is limited this is not always readily achievable.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome or at least reduce the effect of this disadvantage.<br>
The present invention relates to a valve comprising a valve body having a passageway therethrough for flow of medium, two bores intercepting said passageway, the axes of the bores extending transversely of the passageway, two obturators located one in each of the bores and each rotatable the axis thereof between a closed position wherein said passageway is blocked and an open position wherein said passageway is unblocked, and wherein said method io characterized by? uL/n J^K^T<br>
the axis of one obturator and associated bore being arranged at an angle of at least 90° with respect to the axis of the other obturator and associated bore.<br>
The axis of said one obturator and associated bore may be arranged at an angle of between 90° and 180° with respect to the axis of said other obturator and associated bore.<br>
The axis of said one obturator and associated bore may be arranged at an angle of 180° with respect to the axis of said other obturator and associated bore, thus said one obturator and associated bore is inverted with respect to said other obturator and associated bore.<br>
Preferably two drive shafts are provided one drive shaft being associated with said one obturator and the other associated with said other obturator, the axis of each drive shaft being the same as the axis of the associated obturator and the axes of the two drive shafts being substantially parallel. One drive shaft preferably extends in one direction and the other preferably in the opposite direction e.g. one extending vertically upwards and the other vertically downwards.<br>
Two rotatable handles may be provided one handle being associated with said one obturator and the other handle associated with said other obturator, each handle being operable to rotate its associated obturator between said closed position and said open position, both handles being located on the same side of the valve.<br>
The valve may comprise two actuators one attached to said one drive shaft through a gear system and the other actuator being attached to said other drive shaft through another gear system. The two actuators may each comprise one of two rotatable handles, both handles being located on the same side of the valve.<br>
The axes of rotation of the two handles may be parallel.<br>
The valve body may comprise two standard flanges each for attachment to pipe work, the longitudinal distance between the flanges being a standard distance e.g. the same as that for a valve comprising only one obturator and associated bore. Examples of relevant standards in use in the oil and gas industry and setting out standard distances are API.6D, BS2080, BS5353 and ANSI.B16.10.<br>
One embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings of which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows perspective view of a tapered plug valve in accordance with   the invention;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a side view of the valve shown in Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a partial sectional view on section Ill-Ill of the valve shown in Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
The tapered plug valve 1 comprises a body 2 having two end flanges, 3,4 spaced apart by a standard distance D, for fitment to associated pipe work.<br>
A passageway 12 passes through the body 2 and intercepting the passageway are two bores 6 each having a tapered plug 7 therein. Each plug 7 has a port 11 which may be aligned with the passageway 12 in an open condition of the plug 7 or extending at right angles to the passageway 12 in a closed condition of the plug 7.<br>
Each plug 7 has an axis of rotation which extends vertically and the two plug axes are parallel. However one plug and its associated bore is arranged at 180° with respect to the other plug, that is it is inverted with respect to the other plug and associated bore.<br>
Each plug 7 has a drive shaft 8 attached to the narrow end thereof, one extending vertically upwards and the other extending vertically downwards. Attached to each drive shaft is a horizontally disposed actuating shaft 13,14 and associated actuator 9,10. Each actuating shaft has a handle 15,16 attached at the end thereof. Each actuating shaft extends in the same direction from the associated drive shafts and the handles 15,16 are located on the same side of the valve, one, 16, generally, but not vertically, above the other 15.<br>
A venting facility 17 may be provided in the body between the two bores to check the integrity of the upstream obturator seat.<br>
This construction has the advantage that the two handles 15,16 are enabled to be positioned on the same side of the valve because of the inverted arrangement of one plug with respect to the other.  This makes it easier for an operator to operate the valves in the limited space which is available.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
1.	A valve comprising a valve body having a passageway therethrough<br>
for flow of medium, two bores intercepting said passageway, the axes of<br>
the bores extending transversely  of the passageway,   two  obturators<br>
located one in each of the bores and each rotatable    the axis thereof<br>
between a closed position wherein said passageway is blocked and an<br>
open position wherein said passageway is unblocked, and wherein said<br>
method is characterized by;<br>
the axis of one obturator and associated bore being arranged at an angle of at least 90° with respect to the axis of the other obturator and associated bore.<br>
2.	A valve  as claimed in Claim  1,  wherein the axis of said one<br>
obturator and associated bore is arranged at an angle of between 90° and<br>
180° with respect to the axis of said other obturator and associated bore.<br>
3.	A valve  as claimed in Claim  1,  wherein the axis of said one<br>
obturator and associated bore is arranged at an angle of 180° with<br>
respect to the axis of said other obturator and associated bore.<br>
4.	A valve as claimed in any one of Claims 1, 2 or 3 having two drive<br>
shafts, one drive shaft being associated with said one obturator and the other drive shaft being associated with said other obturator.<br>
5.	A valve as claimed in Claim 3 having two drive shafts, one drive<br>
shaft being associated with said one obturator and the other drive shaft<br>
being associated with said other obturator, the axis of each drive shaft<br>
being the same as the axis of the associated obturator and the axes of<br>

6.	A valve as claimed in Claim 5, wherein one drive shaft extends in<br>
one direction and the other drive shaft extends in the opposite direction.<br>
7.	A valve as claimed in any one of Claims 1, 2 or 3, wherein two<br>
