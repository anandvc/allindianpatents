The invention relates to a process for winding the spun yarn onto the bobbin holder and device therefor.<br>
Pot spinning machines are used in the Textile industry to produce spun yarn in spinning mills. The invention eliminates sources of interference on a pot spinning machine and thus will improve the production of pot spinning machines.<br>
During pot spinning it is usual for the thread deposited in the spinning centrifuge or the spinning pot as spinning cake, at the end of the actual spinning process, to be wound onto an empty bobbin holder previously introduced, resulting in a spinning cop. This purpose is served by an empty bobbin holder, which during the actual spinning process is held ready on the thread guide tube, and, in order to initiate the covering process of the yarn package deposited on the inner walls of the spinning centrifuge, is lowered out over the mouth of the thread guide tube.<br>
The edge of the empty bobbin holder in this situation takes up the rotating yarn stretch which emerges from the thread guide tube, for example in a slot arranged at the lower end of the empty bobbin holder, and so prevents it from any further rotation, with the result that the yarn packages deposited on the inner wall of the spinning centrifuge, and other yarn packages which continue to rotate with it, wrap around the empty bobbin holder, and are therefore wound around and cover it.<br>
Because of the absence of further rotation, the thread is indeed released from the drafting device, if the drafting device continues to deliver material, or is, as is know from DE 43 24 039 Al, cut off by a clamping and cutting device directly in the direction of the thread run, behind the drafting device. The thread remains secured to the bobbin holder, however, and forms a trailing thread or trailing thread residue, and can,<br><br>
-2-<br>
with its free end, which may, for example, be half a metre long, create and interference at the winding station or when the bobbin holder or the spinning cop undergoes further handling.<br>
The objective of the invention is to eliminate sources of interference on a pot spinning machine,,<br>
By cutting off close to the point at which the thread was taken up by the tube foot, the free end of the spinning thread remaining at the tube foot is sufficiently short that no farther impairment or interference in the functions of the pot spinning machine can be caused by it or by the spinning thread section which is cut off and removed by suction extraction.<br>
Due to the fact that the separation is effected for preference as a shearing<br>
procedure, a specific, clean, and reliable separation is possible. The thread does not tear<br>
at random, for example, at a thin point, leaving behind a thread residue or free end which<br>
will continue to cause interference. For preference, the separation is effected when the<br>
thread is held and tensioned at one end by the drafting device rollers and at the other end<br>
by the yarn package or the bobbin holder, as is the case during the period of time between<br>
the beginning of the winding process and the release of the thread from the	<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
drafting device. Separation is therefore possible without additional clamping devices. At the moment of the shearing process, the thread is adequately secured and tensioned at both ends.<br>
By means of a separation device, capable of being controlled by means of the relative movement between the bobbin holder and the thread guide tube, which is designed as part of a thread guide, it is ensured that the separation of the spinning thread residue takes place automatically at the start of the winding, i.e. when the thread spinning residue becomes apparent. There is no need for any additional control mechanism. The gathering of the spinning thread residue in the spinning centrifuge is excluded by the separation at the start of the winding process.<br>
In a preferred manner, separation takes place as a result of the rotational movement of a separation device, the axis of rotation of which lies on the notional mid-line which forms the common longitudinal axis of the bobbin holder and the thread guide tube. This allows for a particularly functionally reliable and specific separation to be achieved directly at the bobbin holder slot. The preferred suction extraction through the slubbing extraction system represents a simple and effective means of removal.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment of the process, the spinning thread residue is cut off after the arrival of a travelling doffer at the winding station, by means of a separation device carried by the travelling doffer, and the removal of the spinning thread residue is effected by the suction extraction system of the doffer. This allows for the separation and removal of the spinning thread residue to be carried out with low expenditure of effort as a function of the travelling<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
doffer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, each winding station features a separation device for the separation of the spinning thread residue from the yarn package and a suction device for the removal of the separated spinning thread residue. This makes it possible, at the start of the covering process, and therefore at the appearance of the spinning thread residue, for the thread residue to be eliminated immediately.<br>
In order to avoid the use of additional suction devices, and keep the structural effort involved at the winding station low, the slubbing suction extraction of the pot spinning machine is, for preference, also designed to be the suction extraction device for the spinning thread residue.<br>
In further embodiments, the separation device features for preference at least one blade, capable of movement in the axial direction of the bobbin holder, and for preference at least one blade capable of rotation about an axis of rotation, in which situation the axis of rotation lies on the notional mid-line formed by the common longitudinal axis of the bobbin holder and the thread guide tube. The blade is designed to advantage in the shape of a crown. With such embodiments of the separation device according to the invention, the spinning thread residue can be cut off especially reliably and specifically during the separation process, without any disadvantageous deviation. Simple and space-saving structural solutions such as the arrangement of the separation device inside the bobbin holder, which do not interfere with or impede the other functions of the pot spinning machine, are therefore possible.<br>
In a particularly advantageous manner, the pot spinning<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
device contains media for converting the relative axial movement of the thread guide tube and bobbin holder into the movement of the blade, in which situation the media consist in particular of a slot, running at least partially in a spiral shape, and a bolt capable of moving in the slot. In this embodiment, any additional drive system, or additional drive device, become superfluous.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, at least one separation device is arranged at a travelling doffer to cut off the spinning thread residue, and the doffer extraction suction system is also designed as a suction device for the spinning thread residue. Thanks to the arrangement of the cutting device at the moving doffer, cutting devices at each individual winding station may be done away with, and the substantially lower number of cutting devices at a pot spinning machine will reduce the expenditure and effort considerably.<br>
Further details of the invention are provided by the embodiments presented on the basis of the drawings.<br>

Fig. 7  A schematic representation of a winding station<br>
of a pot spinning machine and a doffer equipped<br>
with  a  separation  device and  a  suction extraction device.<br>
The winding station shown in Fig. 1 of a pot spinning machine is located in the fibre flow direction beneath a drafting device 1, indicated by the last pair of delivery rollers. The fibre strip 2 drawn in the drafting device 1 is drawn together in the spinning triangle 3 under the effect of the circumferential spinning centrifuge 4, to form a thread 5, and introduced into the spinning centrifuge 4 through the thread guide tube 6, designed as part of a thread guide. The thread 5 emerging from the mouth 7 of the thread guide tube 6 comes to rest, under the effect of the rotation of the spinning centrifuge 4, on the inner wall 8 of the spinning centrifuge 4, and there forms a yarn package 9. The thread guide tube 6 in this situation carries out a change of to-and-fro motion in the axial direction, indicated by the double arrow, by means of which motion the formation of the yarn package 9 is controlled. The position which the thread guide tube 6 in Fig. 1 also adopts during the to-arid-fro motion is designated as the spinning position. During the spinning process, an empty bobbin holder 10 which is pushed over<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
the thread guide tube 6 is located above the mouth 7 of the thread guide tube 6.<br>
In order to initiate the covering process, the empty bobbin holder 10 is lowered beyond the mouth 7 of the thread guide tube 6, into the rewinding position 11 designated by the broken line. The circulating yarn element 12 is taken up by a slot 13 at the foot of the bobbin holder 10, and secured in such a way that the yarn package 9 is automatically wound onto the bobbin holder 10 as the spinning centrifuge 4 continues to rotate. The covered bobbin holder 10 can then be placed on a transport plate 14 held ready beneath the spinning centrifuge 4, and carried away together with the transport plate 14 for further processing.<br>
A bobbin holder 10 covered with a yarn package 30 is formed. A bobbin holder 10 formed in this way is shown by the representation in Fig. 2. Due to the securing of the thread 5 in the slot 13, no further rotation is applied to the thread 5, and the thread 5 is accordingly separated by this from the thread strip 2 beneath the drafting device 1. Separation can also be effected by a clamping and cutting device directly beneath the drafting device 1, as is known from DE 43 24 053 Al. The free end of the thread 5 then forms a spinning thread residue 15, which can be close on half a metre long.<br>
The spinning thread residue 15 remains fixed by one end to the bobbin holder 10, and the other loose end can lead to interference at the winding station, during removal transport, or during further processing.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a part of the thread guide tube 6, the lower end of which projects into the spinning centrifuge 4. The thread guide tube 6 is held in a guide 17, capable of displacement in the axial direction.  The<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
bobbin holder 10 is fixed in its position during the spinning process by means of a releasable connection created by a retaining device 16. The guide 17 is arranged in the interior of the bobbin holder 10 and in the retaining device 16, in order to be mounted in rotatable fashion about the mid-line 18, which coincides with the longitudinal axis. In the axial direction, the guide 17 is not capable of displacement, by contrast with the guide 17.<br>
The mouth 7 of the thread guide tube 6 projects out over the end of the bobbin holder 10, and the yarn element 12 can rotate without hinderance. The bobbin holder 10, bobbin holder retainer 16, and guide element 17 together with the thread guide tube 6 carry out the to-and-fro upwards-and-downwards motion during the spinning process, without the position of these components changing in relation to one another.<br>
In the lower part of the bobbin holder 10 is arranged a blade 19, connected securely to the guide element 17. The blade 19 is guided in a counter-piece 20, which in turn is secured firmly to the bobbin holder. The blade 19 is formed into the shape of a crown at its lower end, and, with the spikes 21 of the crown-shaped part in the counter-piece 20, can carry out a rotational movement about the mid-axis 18. The detail X of Fig. 3 is represented in an enlargement in Fig. 4.<br>
The thread guide tube 6 features in the lower part a slot 22, initially running parallel to the mid-line 18, which is designed to run in spiral form onto the lower end of the thread guide tube 6. A bolt 23, securely connected to the guide 17, engages in the slot 22, and is capable of being displaced in it.<br>
The covering process is initiated by the bobbin holder<br><br>
-9 -<br>
10 being lowered backwards over the mouth 7 of the thread guide tube 6. When the lower edge of the bobbin holder 10 reaches the circulating yarn element 12, the yarn element is taken up by the slot 13 and secured. The covering process then begins automatically, brought about by the continuing rotation of the spinning centrifuge 4.<br>
The rewinding position 11 of the bobbin holder 10 is represented in Fig. 5. The bobbin holder 10 has changed its position in the axial direction in relation to the thread guide tube 6, together with the holding device 16 and the guide element 17, together with the blade 19 secured to the guide element 17 and the counter-piece 20. The bolt 23 has likewise changed its position downwards, by the corresponding distance. Thread guide tube 6 and bobbin holder 10 are held in such a way that both do not fully complete a rotational movement about the mid-line 18.<br>
Other details in this position are shown from the sectional representation in Figure 6. As the bobbin holder 10 moves further downwards, the bolt 23 reaches the spiral-shaped section of the slot 22, and incurs a rotational movement of the guide element 17, and therefore of the blade, about the mid-axis 18. The thread S, which is held on the bobbin holder 10 between the drafting device 1 and the yarn package 30, and runs between two spikes 21 of the blade 19 and through a notch 24 of the counter-piece 20, is separated by the shearing effect of the blade 19 and the counter-piece 18. The spinning thread residue 15 is sucked up by the slubbing suction extraction, functioning as a suction extraction device.<br>
Doffing can also take place by and by, in a non-ordered sequence,  by  means  of  a  moving  doffer  26.  The<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
representation of the basic principles set forth in Fig. 7 shows a moving doffer - 26, which features a cutting device 27, a suction device 28, and a gripping device 29 for drawing the covered bobbin holder 10 and for fitting a bobbin holder 10, held ready as an empty holder, into position. Once the moving doffer 26 has reached the winding station, the gripping device 2 9 takes up the foot of the covered bobbin holder 10, the suction device 28 sucks in the spinning thread residue 15, which has in the interim been released at the spinning triangle 3 from the thread strip 2, and the cutting device 27 separates the spinning thread residue 15 directly at the foot of the covered bobbin holder 10.<br>
The object of the invention is not restricted to the embodiments shown in the figures. Further embodiments are possible, for example of the mounting and guide element.<br>
The blade 19 can also carry out a shearing effect on the spinning thread residue 15 in direct interaction with the slot 13 of the bobbin holder 10, in which situation the slot 13 functions like a notch 24 of the counter-piece 20.<br>
Details not described here of the drive system and the mounting of the thread guide tube, bobbin holder, bobbin holder mount, and guide element, can accord with the prior art, as detailed, for example, in DE 195 20 153 Al or DE 43 24 039 Al.<br><br>
