				<td>Field of the invention<br>
[0001] The present invention is related to a diffusive sampling device or 'dosimeter' used for the detection of pollutants in a gaseous fluid, primarily in air, and for the measurement of the concentration of such pollutants.<br>
State of the art<br>
[0002] Diffusive sampling devices of this kind have been described in the art. They comprise an adsorbant which is able to react with or adsorb a particular pollutant, when exposed to a gas mixture, e.g. ambient air of an indoor workplace. The pollutant is able to diffuse towards said adsorbant through a diffusive portion, which may be an air gap or a portion of porous material, or a combination of both. From the uptake of pollutant by the adsorbant, the concentration of the pollutant in the air may then be calculated, based on the knowledge of the diffusive portion's dimensions and the pollutant's diffusion coefficient in said diffusive portion. [0003] Known diffusive dosimeters are described in US-A-4158958, GB-A-2078371 and FR-A-2621691. A problem with existing dosimeters is that they are produced as a kind of 'black box' . They have fixed dimensions leading to a fixed uptake rate for each pollutant, i.e. the mass of pollutant adsorbed per unit of time.<br>
As the time of a measurement is often fixed, e.g. 8h for a workplace test, it is a problem that the uptake rate cannot be adapted to the test conditions by the user of the device. Ambient air with low pollutant concentrations may require a higher uptake rate, and vice versa. When a fixed high uptake rate is applied, there is a danger of oversaturation of the adsorbant, while a low uptake rate may cause the adsorbed pollutant to remain below the detection limit.<br>
Aims of the invention<br>
[0004] The present invention aims to provide a modular diffusive dosimeter which allows a higher degree of flexibility in its operation. The flexibility is a choice of uptake rate and thus mass adsorbed with one and the same sampler without changing external sampler geometry/ sampling time and exposure concentration.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
[0005] The invention . is related to a modular diffusive dosimeter with variable uptake rate as described in the appended claims.<br>
Short description of the drawings<br>
[0006]       Fig.  1  represents  a  dosimeter  of  the<br>
invention, having an open cover and a first spacer element.<br>
[0007]       Fig. 2 represents the same dosimeter, wherein<br>
a spacer is provided comprising small holes.<br>
[0008]       Fig. 3 represents the same dosimeter, wherein<br>
a spacer is provided which allows the application of two<br>
different adsorbents.<br>
[0009]       Fig. 4 represents the same dosimeter, wherein<br>
a spacer is provided with two halves, each halve having a<br>
different uptake rate.<br>
[0010] Fig. 5, 6 and 7 show prototypes of a dosimeter according to the invention.<br>
Detailed description of the Invention<br>
[0011] Based on Pick's diffusion law, the concentration of a pollutant in a gas mixture, said pollutant having diffused through a diffusive layer, can be expressed as :<br>
r -0" DM<br>
wherein m is the uptake of pollutant (in mg) , L is the length of the diffusion path (cm), D is the diffusion coefficient of the pollutant in the diffusive layer (cm2/s) , A is the surface of the diffusive layer (cm2) , and t is the uptake time (sec). When defining the uptake rate Q as D.A/L, this becomes :<br>
 [0012] As mentioned above, in existing dosimeters, Q is a constant value for a particular pollutant type. The adsorbed amount (m) can only be changed by changing the sampling time (t) or when Co changes. In the dosimeter of the invention, means are provided for the user to adapt the uptake rate as a function of the ambient conditions, without changing the external dimensions of the device. The basic idea is to provide a modular dosimeter, wherein one or more sub-parts can be exchanged by the user so that the use of a particular part results in a particular value of the parameters A and L, thereby leading to a variable uptake rate Q.<br>
[0013]       Figure  1  shows  a  schematic  view  of  a dosimeter according to the invention.   It comprises a housing 1, which may be a square shaped receptacle formed by a bottom plate 11 and a vertical circumferential wall 12 as shown in the drawing.  On the bottom of the housing is the adsorbant 2, a layer of a suitable material, able to take up the pollutant by physical or chemical reactions. A spacer 3 is then present on top of the adsorbant.  The spacer is essentially a ring-shaped part of the same form as the housing, and which has the function of creating an air gap 4 playing the part of the diffusive layer (still air zone) .  At the top of the spacer 3 is a protective layer 5, which is permeable by the pollutant but which stops convection currents from entering the dosimeter, so that  the  air  in  the  air  gap  remains  essentially undisturbed.  The dosimeter is closed by a cover 6.  The cover is easily removable from the device.  The cover 6 shown in figure 1 has an opening 7.  This results in a dosimeter with a given uptake factor Q, defined by the diffusion length L, and the surface A of the air gap region.  Cover 6 can be replaced for transport by a closed cover.   The cover of the preferred embodiment of the invention has a circumferential wall 8, which overlaps with the wall of the housing, thereby closing off the dosimeter at the sides.  This aspect will be better described based on the prototype drawings in figures 5 to 7. [0014]       According to the invention, the spacer 3 can be replaced by another spacer with a different surface area A.  For example, the spacer 15 shown in figure 2 can be used, which has a number of cylindrical holes 10 through the thickness of the spacer.  Installation of spacer 15 will have the effect of a reduction of the surface A and thus a change in uptake rate for a particular pollutant. By providing a set of spacers with varying amounts of holes<br>
through their thickness, said holes possibly having varying diameters, the user has the possibility to select the suitable spacer which will give rise - for a particular pollutant- to the optimum uptake rate.<br>
[0015] Figure 3 shows another type of spacer 16 which can be installed in stead of the previously described model 3. Spacer 16 has two large openings 20 and 21. This spacer part is suitable to be used in combination with two different adsorbant layers 22 and 23, corresponding to the two openings, each adsorbant being adapted to measure a different pollutant. Alternatively, spacer 16 of figure 3 can be used with an adsorbant 2 of one particular type, as shown in figure 1. In this way, the two halves of the adsorbant are taking up pollutant through separated air gaps 4a and 4b. After exposure, the adsorbant can then be cut in two parts, which can be analysed separately, possibly by applying different analytical procedures. It is equally possible to place two adsorbant layers of the same type, side by side, in combination with the spacer 16 of figure 3. The two adsorbants can then be analysed separately after the test. Spacers of type 16 can be provided having more than two openings.<br>
[0016] One particular embodiment of a spacer has one large opening 25 on one half of the spacer surface, and a number of cylindrical holes 10 on the other half (see spacer 17 in fig. 4) . This spacer allows to do a measurement with a different uptake rate for each sub-part of the dosimeter's surface. This type of spacer adds another dimension to the dosimeter, as it allows to do one measurement with two different uptake rates, thereby allowing to measure quantitatively different pollutants using the same adsorbant, as well as the same pollutant over a very different concentration range. Of course, the spacer 17 can also be used with different adsorbants under<br>
each subpart, thereby allowing a further variation in the measurement conditions.<br>
[0017] Apart from the spacer (3,15,16,17), also the adsorbant 2 and the protective layer 5 are easily removable from the device and can be replaced by adsorbants or protective layers chosen from a set of these items provided to the user, for example for adapting the dosimeter to another type of pollutant. For this purpose these layers are preferably self-supporting, i.e. sufficiently rigid so that they can be easily taken out of the device by the user. Finally, a set of covers 6 may be provided, with different sizes of aperture 7.<br>
[0018] So in the first place, the invention is related to a *ki-otf-parts', comprising at least :<br>
-	a housing 1<br>
-	a first adsorbant 2<br>
-	a first spacer 3, to define the thickness L and a first<br>
surface area A of the diffusive layer,<br>
-	a first protective layer 5<br>
-	a first cover 6 having an opening 7<br>
and further comprising at least one or more additional spacers, preferably having the same thickness L, each additional spacer being able to replace said first spacer, wherein each spacer defines a different surface area, so that each spacer allows to do a measurement with a different uptake rate. This leads to the concept of a multi-uptake rate sampler.<br>
[0019] In particular, each spacer comprises openings through the thickness of the spacer, said openings having an essentially constant cross-section, said openings defining the surface area A. The openings in one spacer are different in number, size or shape from the openings in<br>
another spacer, so that different spacers allow to do a measurement with different uptake rates.<br>
[0020] In other words, each spacer partitions the surface of the adsorbant in a different way, allowing to expose a different portion of the adsorbant to the pollutant, thereby leading to a variation of the parameter 'A' in the formula of Pick's law. For a given length 'L' of the diffusive path, and a particular diffusion layer (preferably air) , this leads to a variation of the uptake rate Q (also within one and the same sampler, e.g. when the spacer of figure 4 is used).<br>
[0021] Preferably, the set of spacers comprises one or more of the following : a spacer with a number of small holes, as shown in figure 2, a spacer with two large openings of the same size, as shown in figure 3, a spacer with one large opening on one half of the surface and small openings on the other, as shown in figure 4, the latter allowing a measurement with two different uptake rates within one and the same sampler.<br>
[0022] Besides this, any spacer may be added which partitions the dosimeter's surface in another way, e.g. small holes on one quarter of the surface, small holes with another diameter on another quarter, and a large opening on the rest of the surface. Any combination of sizes and shapes or number of openings can be applied, as is clear to the skilled person.<br>
[0023] According to the preferred embodiment, the kit of parts further comprises an additional closed cover, to replace the open cover 6 after the measurement, so that the dosimeter can be closed off and brought to the laboratory for analysis, without taking further precautions to make sure the adsorbant is no longer exposed to the atmosphere.<br>
[0024] In stead of one adsorbant, the kit of parts of the invention may comprise different adsorbants, possibly in different sizes. For example, two different adsorbants may be provided, each corresponding to half the size of the housing's surface. These adsorbants can then be used in combination with a spacer as shown in figure 3 or 4. The kit of. parts may equally comprise several additional protective layers, able to replace the first protective layer.<br>
[0025] The kit of parts may further comprise a means for identifying the pre-defined uptake rate linked to a particular spacer, or to a part of a spacer (in the case of figure 4, e.g.) . This means may be a list of values, identifying the spacers or sub-parts of the spacers in the kit of parts (e.g. by a number, appearing on the spacers themselves), and the corresponding uptake rates, preferably for a diffusion layer consisting of air, or possibly for different types of diffusion layers. Alternatively, the uptake rates may be printed on the spacers themselves. [0026] The housing and cover of a dosimeter of the invention must be designed so that they can be easily separated and re-assembled, with a minimum of leakage between the housing and the cover through the sides of the device.<br>
[0027] Figure Sa shows a prototype of the dosimeter's housing according to the invention. A groove 30 is made in the outer wall of the housing. To one side of the housing, at position 31, the groove has a larger depth, in order to facilitate the removal of the cover. The cover 6 which is to be used with the housing of figure 5a is shown in figure 5b. It has a first protruding rim 32 arranged to be accommodated into a circumferential groove 33 at the top of the housing, for accurate positioning of the cover. On the vertical walls, the cover has a second<br>
 <br>
protruding rim 34, arranged to fit into the groove 30 and thereby close off the housing at the sides. [0028]       For improved closure of the housing at the sides, it is beneficial to apply an O-ring between the housing's outer wall 12 and the vertical wall 8 of the cover.  For this purpose, the housing and cover shown in figures 6a and 6b are suitable.  This housing has a deep groove 40 around its circumference, into which the O-ring can be accommodated.  The vertical wall 8 of the cover 6 does not have a protruding rim in this case. [0029]       Figure 7 shows another prototype with an open housing 50, to which a cover can be attached at both sides, so that the double amount of pollutant uptake is possible. All the embodiments of figures 5, 6 and 7 are of the 'badge' type, i.e. they can be attached to the wearer's clothes for example.  To this aim, they have a connection ring 60 to one side of the housing.<br>
[0030] The housing, cover and spacer parts can be made of PVC or an equivalent material. The protective layer 5 can be a layer of e.g. hydrophobia polyethylene with a thickness of 2mm. The adsorbent can e.g. be a layer of carbon based material known in the art.<br>
