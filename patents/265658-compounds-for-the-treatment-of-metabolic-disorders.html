				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetes mellitus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Chronically elevated blood glucose leads to debilitating complications: nephropathy, often necessitating dialysis or renal transplant; peripheral neuropathy; retinopathy leading to blindness; ulceration of the legs and feet, leading to amputation; fatty liver disease, sometimes progressing to cirrhosis; and vulnerability to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction.<br>
There are two primary types of diabetes. Type I, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is due to autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets. The onset of this disease is usually in childhood or adolescence. Treatment consists primarily of multiple daily injections of insulin, combined with frequent testing of blood glucose levels to guide adjustment of insulin doses, because excess insulin can cause hypoglycemia and consequent impairment of brain and other functions.<br>
Type II, or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) typically develops in adulthood. NEDDM is associated with resistance of glucose-utilizing tissues like adipose tissue, muscle, and liver, to the actions of insulin. Initially, the pancreatic islet beta cells compensate by secreting excess insulin. Eventual islet failure results in decompensation and chronic hyperglycemia. Conversely, moderate islet insufficiency can precede or coincide with peripheral insulin resistance. There are several classes of drugs that are useful for treatment of NEDDM: 1) insulin releasers, which directly stimulate insulin release, carrying the risk of hypoglycemia; 2) prandial insulin releasers, which potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion, and must be taken before each meal; 3) biguanides, including metformin, which attenuate hepatic gluconeogenesis (which is paradoxically elevated in diabetes); 4) insulin sensitizers, for example the thiazolidinedione derivatives rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, which improve peripheral responsiveness to insulin, but which have side effects like weight gain, edema, and occasional liver toxicity; 5) insulin injections, which are often necessary in the later stages of NEDDM when the islets have failed under chronic hyperstimulation.<br><br>
Insulin resistance can also occur without marked hyperglycemia, and is generally<br>
associated with atherosclerosis, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and essential hypertension. This<br>
cluster of abnormalities constitutes the "metabolic syndrome" or "insulin resistance<br>
syndrome". Insulin resistance is also associated with fatty liver, which can progress to<br>
chronic inflammation (NASH; "nonalcoholic steatohepatitis"), fibrosis, and cirrhosis.<br>
Cumulatively, insulin resistance syndromes, including but not limited to diabetes,<br>
underlie many of the major causes of morbidity and death of people over age 40.<br>
Despite the existence of such drugs, diabetes remains a major and growing public health<br>
problem. Late stage complications of diabetes consume a large proportion of national<br>
health care resources. There is a need for new orally active therapeutic agents which<br>
effectively address the primary defects of insulin resistance and islet failure with fewer or<br>
milder side effects than existing drugs.<br>
Currently there are no safe and effective treatments for fatty liver disease. Therefore such<br>
a treatment would be of value in treating this condition.<br>
WO 02/100341 (Wellstat Therapeutics Corp.) discloses certain compounds having<br>
oxygen in place of sulfur, for example 4-(3-(2,6-DimethylbenzyIoxy)phenyl)-4-<br>
oxobutyric acid.<br>

USE IN METHODS OF TREATMENT<br>
This invention provides a method for treating a mammalian subject with a condition<br>
selected from the group consisting of insulin resistance syndrome and diabetes (both<br>
primary essential diabetes such as Type I Diabetes or Type II Diabetes and secondary<br>
nonessential diabetes), comprising administering to the subject an amount of a<br>
biologically active agent as described herein effective to treat the condition. In<br>
accordance with the method of this invention a symptom of diabetes or the chance of<br>
developing a symptom of diabetes, such as atherosclerosis, obesity, hypertension,<br>
hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, foot ulceration<br>
and cataracts, each such symptom being associated with diabetes, can be reduced. This<br>
invention also provides a method for treating hyperlipidemia comprising administering to<br>
the subject an amount of a biologically active agent as described herein effective to treat<br>
the condition. As shown in the Examples, compounds reduce serum triglycerides and<br>
free fatty acids in hyperlipidemic animals. This invention also provides a method for<br>
treating cachexia comprising administering to the subject an amount of a biologically<br>
active agent as described herein effective to treat the cachexia. This invention also<br>
provides a method for treating obesity comprising administering to the subject an amount<br>
of a biologically active agent as described herein effective to treat the condition. This<br>
invention also provides a method for treating a condition selected from atherosclerosis or<br>
arteriosclerosis comprising administering to the subject an amount of a biologically active<br>
agent us described herein effective to treat the condition. The active agents of this<br>
invention are effective to ueal liypeilipidemia, fatty liver disease, cachexia, obesity,<br>
atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis whether or not the subject has diabetes or insulin<br>
resistance syndrome. The agent can be administered by any conventional route of<br>
systemic administration. Preferably the agent is administered orally. Accordingly, it is<br>
preferred for the medicament to be formulated for oral administration. Other routes of<br>
administration that can be used in accordance with this invention include rectally,<br>
parenterally, by injection (e.g. intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or<br>
intraperitioneal injection), or nasally.<br>
Further embodiments of each of the uses and methods of treatment of this invention<br>
comprise administering any one of the embodiments of the biologically active agents<br>
described above. In the interest of avoiding unnecessary redundancy, each such agent<br>
and group of agents is not being repeated, but they are incorporated into this description<br>
of uses and methods of treatment as if they were repeated.<br>
Many of the diseases or disorders that are addressed by the compounds of the invention<br>
fall into two broad categories: Insulin resistance syndromes and consequences of chronic<br>
hyperglycemia. Dysregulation of fuel metabolism, especially insulin resistance, which<br>
can occur in the absence of diabetes (persistent hyperglycemia) per se, is associated with<br>
a variety of symptoms, including hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, obesity, essential<br>
hypertension, fatty liver disease (NASH; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), and, especially in<br>
the context of cancer or systemic inflammatory disease, cachexia. Cachexia can also<br>
occur in the context of Type I Diabetes or late-stage Type II Diabetes. By improving<br>
tissue fuel metabolism, active agents of the invention are useful for preventing or<br>
amelioriating diseases and symptoms associated with insulin resistance, as is<br>
demonstrated in animals in the Examples. While a cluster of signs and symptoms<br>
associated with insulin resistance may coexist in an individual patient, it many cases only<br>
one symptom may dominate, due to individual differences in vulnerability of the many<br>
physiological systems affected by insulin resistance. Nonetheless, since insulin resistance<br>
is a major contributor to many disease conditions, drugs which address this cellular and<br>
molecular defect are useful for prevention or amelioration of virtually any symptom in<br>
any organ system that may be due to, or exacerbated by, insulin resistance.<br>
When insulin resistance and concurrent inadequate insulin production by pancreatic inlets<br>
are sufficiently severe, chronic hyperglycemia occurs, defining the onset of Type II<br>
diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). In addition to the metabolic disorders related to insulin<br>
resistance indicated above, disease symptoms secondary to hyperglycemia also occur in<br>
patients with NIDDM. These include nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy,<br>
microvascular disease, ulceration of the extremities, and consequences of nonenzymatic<br>
glycosylation of proteins, e.g. damage to collagen and other connective tissues.<br>
Attenuation of hyperglycemia reduces the rate of onset and severity of these<br>
consequences of diabetes. Because, as is demonstrated in the Examples, active agents<br>
and compositions of the invention help to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetes, they are<br>
useful for prevention and amelioration of complications of chronic hyperglycemia.<br>
Both human and non-human mammalian subjects can be treated in accordance with the<br>
treatment method of this invention. The optimal dose of a particular active agent of the<br>
invention for a particular subject can be determined in the clinical setting by a skilled<br>
clinician. In the case of oral administration to a human for treatment of disorders related<br>
to insulin resistance, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease, cachexia or obesity the<br>
agent is generally administered in a daily dose of from 1 mg to 400 mg, administered<br>
once or twice per day. In the case of oral administration to a mouse the agent is<br>
generally administered in a daily dose from 1 to 300 mg of the agent per kilogram of<br>
body weight. Active agents of the invention are used as monotherapy in diabetes or<br>
insulin resistance syndrome, or in combination with one or more other drugs with utility<br>
in these types of diseases, e.g. insulin releasing agents, prandial insulin releasers,<br>
biguanides, or insulin itself. Such additional drugs are administered in accord with<br>
standard clinical practice. In some cases, agents of the invention will improve the<br>
efficacy of other classes of drugs, permitting lower (and therefore less toxic) doses of<br>
such agents to be administered to patients with satisfactory therapeutic results.<br>
Established safe and effective dose ranges in humans for representative compounds are:<br>
metformin 500 to 2550 mg/day; glyburide 1,25 to 20 mg/day; GLUCOVANCE<br>
(combined formulation of metformin and glyburide) 1.25 to 20 mg/day glyburide and 250<br>
to 2000 mg/day metformin; atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg/day; lovastatin 10 to 80 mg/day;<br>
pravastatin 10 to 40 mg/day; and simvastatin 5-80 mg/day; clofibrate 2000 mg/day;<br>
gemfibrozil 1200 to 2400 mg/day, rpsiglitazone 4 to 8 mg/day; pioglitazone 15 to 45<br>
mg/day; acarbose 75-300 mg/day; repaglinide 0.5 to 16 mg/day.<br>
Type I Diabetes Mellitus: A patient with Type I diabetes manages their disease primarily<br>
by self-administration of one to several doses of insulin per day, with frequent monitoring<br>
blood glucose to permit appropriate adjustment of the dose and timing of insulin<br>
administration. Chronic hyperglycemia leads to complications such as nephropathy,<br>
neuropathy, retinopathy, foot ulceration, and early mortality; hypoglycemia due to<br>
excessive insulin dosing can cause cognitive dysfunction or unconsciousness. A patient<br>
with Type I diabetes is treated with 1 to 400 mg/day of an active agent of this invention,<br>
in tablet or capsule form either as a single or a divided dose. The anticipated effect will<br>
be a reduction in the dose or frequency of administration of insulin required to maintain<br>
blood glucose in a satisfactory range, and a reduced incidence and severity of<br>
hypoglycemic episodes. Clinical outcome is monitored by measurement of blood glucose<br>
and glycosylated hemoglobin (an index of adequacy of glycemic control integrated over a<br>
period of several months), as well as by reduced incidence and severity of typical<br>
complications of diabetes. A biologically active agent of this invention can be<br>
administered in conjunction with islet transplantation to help maintain the anti-diabetic<br>
efficacy of the islet transplant.<br>
Type II Diabetes Mellitus: A typical patient with Type II diabetes (NIDDM) manages<br>
their disease by programs of diet and exercise as well as by taking medications such as<br>
metformin, glyburide, repaglinide, rosiglitazone, or acarbose, all of which provide some<br>
improvement in glycemic control in some patients, but none of which are free of side<br>
effects or eventual treatment failure due to disease progression. Islet failure occurs over<br>
time in patients with NIDDM, necessitating insulin injections in a large fraction of<br>
patients. It is anticipated that daily treatment with an active agent of the invention (with<br>
or without additional classes of antidiabetic medication) will improve glycemic control,<br>
reduce the rate of islet failure, and reduce the incidence and severity of typical symptoms<br>
of diabetes. In addition, active agents of the invention will reduce elevated serum<br>
triglycerides and fatty acids, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, a major<br>
cause of death of diabetic patients. As is the case for all other therapeutic agents for<br>
diabetes, dose optimization is done in individual patients according to need, clinical<br>
effect, and susceptibility to side effects.<br>
Hyperlipidemia: Elevated triglyceride and free fatty acid levels in blood affect a<br>
substantial fraction of the population and arc an important risk factor for atherosclerosis<br>
and myocardial infarction. Active agents of the invention are useful for reducing<br>
circulating triglycerides and free fatty acids in hyperlipidemic patients. Hyperlipidemic<br>
patients often also have elevated blood cholesterol levels, which also increase the risk of<br>
cardiovascular disease. Cholesterol-lowering drugs such as HMG-CoA reductase<br>
inhibitors ("statins") can be administered to hyperlipidemic patients in addition to agents<br>
of the invention, optionally incorporated into the same pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Fatty Liver Disease: A substantial fraction of the population is affected by fatty liver<br>
disease, also known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); NASH is often associated<br>
with obesity and diabetes. Hepatic steatosis, the presence of droplets of triglycerides with<br>
hepatocytes, predisposes the liver to chronic inflammation (detected in biopsy samples as<br>
infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes), which can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Fatty<br>
liver disease is generally detected by observation of elevated serum levels of liverspecific<br>
enzymes such as the transaminases ALT and AST, which serve as indices of<br>
hepatocyte injury, as well as by presentation of symptoms which include fatigue and pain<br>
in the region of the liver, though definitive diagnosis often requires a biopsy. The<br>
anticipated benefit is a reduction in liver inflammation and fat content, resulting in<br>
attenuation, halting, or reversal of the progression of NASH toward fibrosis and cirrhosis.<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
This invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a biologically active<br>
agent as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Further<br>
embodiments of the pharmaceutical composition of this invention comprise any one of<br>
the embodiments of the biologically active agents described above. In the interest of<br>
avoiding unnecessary redundancy, each such agent and group of agents is not being<br>
repeated, but they are incorporated into this description of pharmaceutical compositions<br>
as if they were repeated.<br>
Preferably the composition is adapted for oral administration, e.g. in the form of a tablet,<br>
coated tablet, dragee, hard or soft gelatin capsule, solution, emulsion or suspension. In<br>
general the oral composition will comprise from 1 mg to 400 mg of such agent. It is<br>
convenient for the subject to swallow one or two tablets, coated tablets, dragees, or<br>
gelatin capsules per day. However the composition can also be adapted for<br>
administration by any other conventional means of systemic administration including<br>
rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection<br>
solutions, or nasally.<br>
The biologically active compounds can be processed with pharmaceutically inert,<br>
inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical compositions. Lactose,<br>
corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for<br>
example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules.<br>
Suitable carriers for soft gelatin capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats,<br>
semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like. Depending on the nature of the active<br>
ingredient no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatin capsules,<br>
other than the soft gelatin itself. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and<br>
syrups are, for example, water, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like. Suitable<br>
carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semilliquid<br>
or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers,<br>
stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying<br>
the osmotic pressure, buffers, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still<br>
other therapeutical ly valuable substances, particularly antidiabetic or hypolipidemic<br>
agents that act through mechanisms other than those underlying the effects of the<br>
compounds of the invention. Agents which can advantageously be combined with<br>
compounds of the invention in a single formulation include but are not limited to<br>
biguanides such as metformin, insulin releasing agents such as the sulfonylurea insulin<br>
releaser glyburide and other sulfonylurea insulin releasers, cholesterol-lowering drugs<br>
such as the "statin" HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as atrovastatin, lovastatin ,<br>
pravastatin and simvastatin, PPAR-alpha agonists such as clofibrate and gemfibrozil,<br>
PPAR-gamma agonists such as thiazolidinediones (e.g. rosiglitazone and pioglitazone,<br>
alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose (which inhibit starch digestion), and<br>
prandial insulin releasers such as repaglinide. The amounts of complementary agents<br>
combined with compounds of the invention in single formulations are in accord with the<br>
doses used in standard clinical practice. Established safe and effective dose ranges for<br>
certain representative compounds are set forth above.<br>
The invention will be better understood by reference to the following examples which<br>
illustrate but do not limit the invention described herein.<br>

(associated with peripheral insulin resistance) to hypoinsulinemic diabetes.<br>
Male obese (db/db homozygote) C57BL/Ksola mice approximately 8 weeks of age, were<br>
obtained from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME) and sorted into groups of 7 animals each<br>
animals such that the body weights (40 -45 g) and serum glucose levels (&gt;300 mg/dl in<br>
fed state) were similar between groups. A minimum of 7 days was allowed for adaptation<br>
after arrival. All animals were maintained under controlled temperature (23 °C), relative<br>
humidity (50 + 5 %) and light (7:00 - 19:00), and allowed free access to standard chow<br>
(Formulab Diet 5008, Quality Lab Products, Elkridge, MD) and water.<br>
Groups of mice received daily oral doses of vehicle (1% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)<br>
or Compound CS (60 mg/kg) for 17 days. At the end of the treatment period, blood<br>
samples were collected and serum glucose, triglycerides, and free fatty acids were<br>
measured. (Table Removed)<br><br><br><br>
