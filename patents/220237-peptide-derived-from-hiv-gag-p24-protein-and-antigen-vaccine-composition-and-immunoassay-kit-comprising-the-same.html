COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"PEPTIDE DERIVED FROM HIV gag p24 PROTEIN AND ANTIGEN, VACCINE COMPOSITION AND IMMUNOASSAY KIT COMPRISING THE SAME"<br>
BIONOR IMMUNO AS, a Norwegian company of P.O. Box 1893 Gulset, N-3703 Skien, Norway<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel peptides based on conserved regions of HIV gag p24, antigens in free or carrier-bound form comprising at least one of the said peptides, vaccine compositions containing at least one of the antigens, immunoassay kits and a method of detecting antibodies, induced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or HlV-specific peptides, using such antigens.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
There is an urgent need to control the global epidemic of HIV infection and the development of a vaccine against HIV is one of the major objectives in AIDS research. In general vaccines should activate antigen presenting cells, overcome genetic restriction in T-cell responses and generate T- and B-memory cells. The variability of the viral population poses a further difficulty in obtaining an effective HIV vaccine. A break through in the ongoing attempts to develop a vaccine against AIDS has so far not been reported. It is now generally accepted that an induction of antigen-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity is crucial for a development of an effective prophylactic arid therapeutic vaccine. All three arms of the immune system including neutralizing antibodies; CD8+CTL and T-helper-1 (TH1) cells might be required for protective immunity to HIV. It is known that CTL can clear other viral infections (Ada, Immunol. Cell Biol., 72:447-454, 1994) and that CTL can lyse infected targets early in infection before viral progeny can be produced and released by cell lysis, Ada et al., supra.The focus has been on selection of antigens as well as on design and evaluation of different adjuvances. The antigens used in different in vitro and in vivo studies have been all from crude proteins to various synthetic peptides mainly from gp160 and to some extent from p24. A large number of studies have been done on the V3 loop of gp120. Induction of both B- and T-cell responses have been observed, however, it has been reported from an in vitro study that a peptide from the conserved region of gp41 have indicated infection enhancement (Bell S.J., et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol., 87 (1): 37-45, (January 1992).<br><br><br>
Naturally occurring HIV sequences in vaccine candidates are not capable of stimulating a stable immune response due to the viruses inherent ability to hide by changing the appearance of the epitopes presented on the cell surface of infected cells. The immune system is fooled to believe that a particular amino acid sequence is relevant when in fact the amino acids of importance is hidden.<br>
A resent study of titers of antibodies against the gag p24 protein, has shown that slpw progression towards development of AIDS is associated with high titers, while fast progression towards development of AIDS is associated with low titers. It is shown that persons with low p24 antibody titer develop significantly faster AIDS than persons with high p24 anybody titers (Zwart G et al Virology, 201 p 285 93 june 1994 indicating that p24 can play a key role to control the development of AIDS.<br>
New HIV p24 peptides are described in VVO91/13360, wherein the peptides are used in a method of discriminating between a false and true diagnosed HIV-positive serum sample.<br>
Johnson R.P., et al., The Journal of Immunology, Vol.147, p.1512-1521, No.5, September 1,1991 describe an'analysis' of the fine specificity of gag-specific CTL-responses in three HIV-1 seropolsitive individuals,"'the gag-specific CTL-responses were found to be mediated by CD3^CD8+lymphocytes which are HLA class I restricted.<br>
EP-A-0 356 007 discloses antigenic determinants, in particular it relates to synthetic polypeptide sequences which are related to proteins present in the HIV-1 and which can be used as a basis for a potential vaccine against AIDS.<br>
Rosenberg E.S. etal., Science, Vol.278, 21 November 1997, p. 1447-1450 describe<br>
that virus specific CD4+ T helper lymphocytes are critical to the maintenance of<br>
effective immunity in a nurnber of chronic viral infections but 	are characteristically<br>
undetectable in chronic human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) infection. HIV-1-specific proliferative responses to p24 were inversely related to viral load. They<br><br><br>
conclude that the HIV-1-specific helper cells are likely to be important in immunotherapeutic interventions and vaccine development.<br>
EP 0 230 222, EP 0 270 114, DE 37 11 016 and GB 2 188 639 all in the name of F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co. Aktiengesellschaft concern recombinant expression and purification of an HTLVIII Gag/Env gene protein or fusionproteins. The proteins consisting of native sequences can be purified to homogeneity and used as a basis for diagnostic tests for detection of antibodies against viruses associated with AIDS. The gag/env protein may also be formulated for use as a vaccine for protection against AIDS through prophylactic immunization.<br>
From a diagnostic and therapeutic point of view, the major problems with using p24 as part of an assay or therapy is associated with the high number of epitopes on p24 which stimulates production of a large number of antibodies with poor specificity, which through repeated boostering on potential mutated sequences can create autoantibodies (Autoantibodies to the alfa/beta T-cell receptors in HIV infection; dysregulation and mimicry. Lake D.F., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA, (23): 10849-53, Nov. 8 1994). Further, it is reported that the p24 antibody titer does not reach the same high levels as for the envelope proteins (gp120 and gp41). Normally antibodies to p24 are developed in the very early phase of the infection, but the titer is fairly quickly stabilized after the initial infection period. Later the p24 titer is gradually decreasing while the opposite happens with gp160. These findings can also be seen in relation to recent reports stating that cytotoxic T-cell activity is antagonized by naturally occurring HIV-1 gag variants (Klenerman P., et al.. Nature, 2:369 (6479), p. 355, 2 June 1994). This can be one of the reasons why a rapid stabilization of the p24 titer is seen and why it later starts to decrease.<br>
Based on the above background data, we decided to investigate the possibility of designing novelsyrithetic peptides which can mimic the p24 epitope without antagonizing the cytotoxic T-cell activity, in order to meet the need for an effective prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine.<br><br>
The intital work was based on one epitope which was published by Korber B., et al., Human Retroviruses and AIBB 1997 EdsTbeoretical Biology and Biophysics: Group; Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM. The amino add sequence of this epitope (203-222) was:    ,<br>

The one tetter as well as the three letter codes defining the amino adds in the. sequences given throughout this specification are in aocrdae with International . standards and given in textbooks, for instance Lehnnger A.L, (Principles of Biochemistry*. Worth Publishers Inc., New York. 1982. The aminoarids given below the head sequence represent the natural variation of the sequence. An initial study of a sequence containing this modified epitope was conducted on the sequence:<br><br>
wherein X indicates 2-aminohexanoic acid and the cysteine residues are in an oxidized state, i.e. are forming an intrachain disulphide bridge. The results      (unpublished) from studies using this peptide as part of a diagnostic kit showed that the specificity became 67% (n=279) on a preselected panel of African sera. The sensitivity was surprisingly 100% on a panel of HIV-1 positive sera including HIV-1! subtype O sera, which is quite different from the other subtypes.<br>
In order to improve specificity, i.e. define the amino acids which contribute to a pure         non-crossreacting antibody response, a similar study was applied to a significantly shorter and further modified peptide:<br><br><br>
wherein X has the above mentioned meaning and the cysteine residues are forming an intrachain disulphide bridge.<br>
The results from this study showed that the specificity of the assay increased to 96%, and (n=293) which is similar to the specificity obtained in the assay without using the p24 peptide. With a specificity of 87% to the assay where the first peptide was included, it would be likely that the peptide would induce immune response to more than one" epitope since it was recognized by unspecific antibodies, if it was used as a vaccine candidate. The latter, however, show that the peptide sequence is picking up an immune response which is unique to HIV-1. Consequently, if a sequence based on this is used as an antigen in a vaccine candidate, it would most likely boost an unique immune response to HIV-1.<br>
To further increase the number of T-cell epitopes and reduce the probability for development of escape mutants three additional peptide sequences were based on the following three sequences from residues 264-284, 253-271 and 166-186, respectively published in Human Retroviruses and AIDS 1997; A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences.

wherein the sequence of SEQ ID NO : 15 consists of at least six consecutive amino<br>
acids, n = 1,2 or 3 and m=0,1,2 or 3,<br>
the terminal ends of the sequences may be free carboxyl- or amino groups, amides, acyls, acetyls or salts thereof,<br>
two or more of the Cys residues may form part of an intrachain- or interchain disulphide binding, a -S-(CH2)P-S- or a - (CH2)p-bridge wherein p = 1-8, optionally intervened by one or more heteroatoms such as O, N or S and/or the said peptide sequences are immobilized to a solid support.<br>
The new peptide sequences have the potential to serve as a good antigen wherein the antigen comprises at least one peptide selected from the group of sequences of SEQ ID NO : 1, SEQ ID NO : 4, SEQ ID NO : 9 or SEQ ID NO: 15. The antigenicity may be adapted through adjusting the ratio or concentration of different peptides or size of the peptides by for instance dimerisation or polymerisation and/or immobilisation to a solid phase. The antigen comprises two or more polypeptide sequences, according to the<br><br>
invention, which are either linked by a bridge for instance a disuiphide bridge between the Cys residues of the chains or bridges like C1- C8 alkylen possibly intervened by one or more heteroatoms like O, S, or N or preferably they are unlinked. The chains may be immobilized to a solid phase in monomelic, dimeric or oligomeric forms. Further amino acids may be added to the ends in order to achieve an «arm» to facilitate immobilization.<br>
All amino acids in the peptides of the invention can be in both D- or L-form, although the naturally occurring L- form is preferred.<br>
The C- and N-termina! ends of the peptide sequences could deviate from the natural sequences by modification of the terminal NH2-group and/or COOH-group, they may for instance be acylated, acetylated, amidated or modified to provide a binding site for a carrier or another molecule.<br>
The peptides according to the invention are consisting of 6 to 50 amino acids, preferably between 10 and 30 amino acids. They are covering all natural variation of amino acids in the identified positions.<br>
The polypeptide antigen according to the invention is either in a free or in a carrier-bound form. The carrier or solid phase to which the peptide is optionally bound can be selected from a vide variety of known carriers. It should be selected with regard to the intended use of the immobilized polypeptide as a diagnostic antigen or as an immunizing component in a vaccine.<br>
Examples of carriers that can be used for e.g. diagnostic purposes are magnetic beads or latex of co-polymers such as styrene-divinyl benzene, hydroxylated styrene-divinyl benzene, polystyrene, carboxylated polystyrene, beads of carbon black, non-activated or polystyrene or polyvinyl chloride activated glass, epoxy-activated porous magnetic glass , gelatine or polysaccharide particles or other protein particles, red blood cells, mono- or polyclonal antibodies or fab fragments of such antibodies.<br><br><br>
According to a further embodiment of the present invention, the antigens may form part of a vaccine possibly combined with carriers, adjuvants or combined with other immunostimulating elements such as canarypox virus carrying the env gene. Examples of carriers and/or adjuvants for vaccine purposes are other proteins such as human or bovine serum albumin and keyhole limpet haemocyanin. Immunostimulatory materials may be divided into three groups; adjuvants, carriers for antigens and vehicles. Examples of adjuvants include aluminum hydroxyd, aluminum salts, saponin, muramyl di- and tri-peptides, monophosphoryl lipid A, B.pertussis and various cytokines including the Th1 cytokine IL-12 and IL-1. A number of protein toxins can be used to carry passenger proteins across cellular membranes into the cytosol, which are useful in developing CTL vaccines Carriers bactenal toxoids; such as inactivated tetanus and cholera genetically detoxified bacterial tixins such as heat labile<br>
enterotoxin from E.coli, fatty;acids live, vectors such as polio chimeras and hybrid proteins that form particulates for example yeast retrotransposon hybrid TY particles and HBcAg particles. Vehicles which are frequently occurring components in modem vaccines are consisting of mineral oil emulsion, Freunds complete and incomplete adjuvant, vegetable oil emulsions, nonionic block co-polymer surfactants, squalene or squalane, liposomes and biodegradable microspheres. Two novel adjuvants which possess significant potential for the development of new vaccines include an oil-in-water microemulsion (MF59).and polymenc microparticles. Any substance that can enhance the immunogenicity of the antigen, may, be used and several further alternatives of carriers or adjuvants are given in the US or European Pharmacopoeia.<br>
A suitable formulation of the antigen for immunostimulatpry uses may also comprise interferons such as INF-y, antiviral chemokines or haematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte macrophage growth factor.<br>
Another approach in order to enhance the stimulation and absorption in for instance the<br>
intestine is to administer the peptides of the invention, with small    peptides such as di-<br>
tri- or tetfa peptides. Tnese peptides can be administred in addition to	or in<br>
combination with the peptides of the invention. Preferably the peptides are administered together with the tripeptide YGG, consisting of amino acids in the D- or L-forms; preferably in the D-form.<br><br>
Recent approaches to non-parenteral delivery of vaccines, for instance via mucosa include; gene fusion technology to create non-toxic derivatives of mucosal adjuvants, genetically inactivated antigens with a deletion in an essential gene, coexpression of an antigen and a specific cytokine that is important in the modulation and control of a mucosal immune response, and genetic material itself that would allow DNA or RNA uptake and its endogenous expression in the host's cells.<br>
One approach for developing durable responses where cell-mediated immunity is * required, is to vaccinate with plasmid DNA encoding one or more specific antigen(s).<br>
In order to protect against HIV infection, vaccines should induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses and could be administered by any convenient route, parenterally or non-parenterally, such as subcutanously, intracutanously, intravenously, intramuscularly, perorally, mucosally or intranasally for example.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the vaccine according to the present invention it comprises antigens containing the peptides of the SEQ ID NO : 1, 4, 9 and 15, more preferred the peptides occur in the ratio 1:1:1:1.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment the vaccine composition contains the antigens ;<br>
RAL GPAATLQTPWTASLGVG-NH2(SEQIDNO:3)<br>
R WL L L G L N P L V G G G R L Y S P T S I L G - NH2 (SEQ ID NO : 6)<br>
RAIPIPAGTLLSGGGRAIYKRTAILG-NH2(SEQ ID NO:11)<br>
and<br>
RFMPNIFTALSGGRRALLYGATPYAIG-NH2 (SEQ ID NO : 18).<br>
One of the sequences contains a B-celi epitope and will activate the humoral immune system, whereas the other sequences contribute with CTL-epitopes and the amino acid changes implemented within the frame of the CTL-epitope are designed to achieve enhanced binding. Other amino acid changes have been conducted in order to facilitate the synthesis of the peptide and/or increase the solubility of the peptide.<br><br>
A method for detecting antibodies, induced by HIV-1 or HIV-1 specific peptides or proteins, in a sample of body fluid using the present antigens is a further embodiment of the invention. Also immunoassay kit designed for this detection and antibodies capable of selectively reacting with the said antigens are encompassed by the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREPARATION OF THE PEPTIDES<br>
The peptides of the invention can be produced by any known method of producing a linear amino acid sequence, such as recombinant DNA techniques. A nucleic acid sequence which encodes a peptide of the invention or a multimer of the said peptides, is introduced into an expression vector. Suitable expression vectors are for instance plasmids, cosmids, viruses and YAC (yeast artifical chromosome) which comprise necessary control regions for replication and expression. The expression vector may be stimulated to expression in a host cell. Suitable host cells are for example bacteria, yeast cells and mammal cells. Such techniques are well known in the art and described for instance by Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, 1989. Other well-known techniques are degradation or synthesis by coupling of one amino acid residue to the next one in liquid phase or preferably on a solid phase (resin) for instance by the so-called Memfield synthesis. See for instance Barany and Merrifield in the Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis, Biology, Vol.2, E. Gross and Meinhofer. Ed. (Acad.Press, N.Y., 1980), Kneib-Coronier and Mullen Int. J. Peptide Protein Res.,30, p.705-739 (1987) and Fields and Noble IntJ.Peptide Protein Res., 35, p.161-214 (1990).<br>
In case a linked or cyclic peptide is desired, the amino acid sequence is subjected to a chemical oxidation step in order to cyclize or link the two cysteine residues within one or between two peptide sequences, when the appropriate linear amino acid sequences are synthesized, see Akaji et al., Tetrahedron Letter, 33, 8, p. 1073-1076,1992.<br><br>
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SYNTHESIS<br>
All peptide derivatives prepared in the Examples given below were synthesized on a Miliigen 9050 Peptide Synthesizer using a standard program. The resin used was Tenta Gel P RAM with a theoretical loading of 0,20 meq/g (RAPP POLYMERE GmbH, TQbingen). The final product of the synthesis was dried in vacuo overnight. The peptide was then cleaved from the resin by treatment with 90% trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of ethandithiol (5%) and water (5%) as scavengers (1,5 hours at RT). Then the resin was filtered and washed on filter with additional trifluoroacetic acid (100%) (2 x 20 ml). The combined filtrates were evaporated in vacuo (water bath at RT) and the residue was triturated with ethyl ether (200 ml) and the precipitated product filtered off. The solid was promptly dissolved on filter with glacial acetic acid (100 ml) and added to 1,5 I of 20% acetic acid in methanol and treated with 0,1 M solution of iodine in methanol until a faint brown colour remained. Then Dowex 1 x 8 ion exchange in acetate form (15g) (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) was added and the mixture filtered. The filtrate was evaporated and the residue freeze-dried from acetic acid. The product was then purified by reversed phase liquid chromatography on a column filled with Kromasil® 100 - 5 C8 (EKA Nobel, Surte, Sweden) in a suitable system containing acetonitrile in 0,1 % trifluoroacetic acid water solution. The samples collected from the column were analyzed by analytical high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Beckman System Gold, USA) equipped with a Kromasil® 100 - 5 C8 Column (EKA Nobel, Surte, Sweden). Fractions containing pure substance were pooled, the solvent was evaporated and the product freeze-dried from acetic acid. The final HPLC analysis was performed on final product, and the structure of the peptide was confirmed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry (LDI-MS).<br>
All amino acids used during the synthesis were L-amino acids and they were protected with a fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl group at the -amino function. The side chains were protected as follows:<br>
Cys (Trt), Gln(Trt), Glu(OtBu), Thr(tBu).<br>
The abbreviations, within the brackets are :<br><br>
Trt = triphenylmethyl<br>
-Bu = tert. Butyl<br>
OtBu = tert. Butylester<br>
The amino acid derivatives was supplied by Bachem AG, Switzerland.<br>
