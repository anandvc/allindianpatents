				<td>AMINO-SUBSTITUTED (E)-2,6-DIALKOXYSTYRYL 4-SUBSTITUTED-BENZYLSULFONES FOR TREATING PROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to compositions and methods for the treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Extracellular signals received at transmembrane receptors are relayed into the cells by the signal transduction pathways (Pelech et al., Science 257:1335 (1992)) which have been implicated in a wide array of physiological processes such as induction of cell proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis (Davis ef al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:14553 (1993)). The Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade is a major signaling system by which cells transduce extracellular cues into intracellular responses (Nishida et al., Trends Biochem. Sci. 18:128 (1993); Blumer et al., Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:236 (1994)). Many steps of this cascade are conserved, and peptides with considerable homology with MAP kinases have been discovered in different species.<br>
In mammalian cells, the Extracellular-Signal-Regulated Kinases (ERKs), ERK-1 and ERK-2 are the archetypal and best-studied members of the MAPK family, which all have the unique feature of being activated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues by an upstream dual specificity kinase (Posada et al., Science 255:212 (1992); Biggs III et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:6295 (1992); Garner era/., Genes Dev. 6:1280 (1992)).<br>
Recent studies have identified an additional subgroup of MAPKs, known as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases 1 and 2 (JNK-1 and JNK-2), that have different substrate specificities and are regulated by different stimuli (Hibi et al., Genes Dev. 7:2135 (1993)). JNKs are members of the class of stress-activated protein kinases (SPKs). JNKs have been shown to be activated by treatment of cells with<br>
UV radiation, pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental stress (Derijard et a/., Cell 1025 (1994)). The activated JNK binds to the amino terminus of the c-Jun protein and increases the protein's transcriptional activity by phosphorylating it at ser63 and ser73 (Adler et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:5341 (1992); Kwok er a/., Nature 370:223 (1994)).<br>
Analysis of the deduced primary sequence of the JNKs indicates that they are distantly related to ERKs (Davis, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). Both ERKs and JNKs are phosphorylated on Tyr and Thr in response to external stimuli resulting in their activation (Davis, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). The phosphorylation (Thr and Tyr) sites, which play a critical role in their activation are conserved between ERKs and JNKs (Davis, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). However, these sites of phosphorylation are located within distinct dual phosphorylation motifs: Thr-Pro-Tyr (JNK) and Thr-Glu-Tyr (ERK). Phosphorylation of MAPKs and JNKs by an external signal often involves the activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) (Gille et a/., Nature 358:414 (1992)), which constitute a large family of proteins encompassing several growth factor receptors and other signal transducing molecules.<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases are enzymes which catalyze a well defined chemical reaction: the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue (Hunter et al., Annu Rev Biochem 54:897 (1985)). Receptor tyrosine kinases in particular are attractive targets for drug design since blockers for the substrate domain of these kinases is likely to yield an effective and selective antiproliferative agent. The potential use of protein tyrosine kinase blockers as antiproliferative agents was recognized as early as 1981, when quercetin was suggested as a PTK blocker (Graziani era/., Eur. J. Biochem. 135:583-589 (1983)).<br>
The best understood MAPK pathway involves extracellular signal-regulated kinases which constitute the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade (Boudewijn er a/., Trends Biochem. Sci. 20, 18 (1995)). Once this pathway is activated by different stimuli, MAPK phosphorylates a variety of proteins including several transcription factors which translocate into the nucleus and activate gene transcription. Negative regulation of this pathway could arrest the cascade of these events.<br>
What are needed are new anticancer chemotherapeutic agents which target receptor tyrosine kinases and which arrest the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase<br>
cascade. Oncoproteins in general, and signal transducing proteins in particular, are likely to be more selective targets for chemotherapy because they represent a subclass of proteins whose activities are essential for cell proliferation, and because their activities are greatly amplified in proliferative diseases.<br>
What are also needed are new cell antiproliferative agents, and anticancer therapeutics in particular, which are highly selective in the killing of proliferating cells such as tumor cells, but not normal cells.<br>

(E)-2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-3-(2,2,3,3,tetrafluorosuccinamido)-4-methoxybenzyl-sulfone.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention of formula I,<br>
Xis<br>
and y is 0; and R2 is-H.  According to a sub-embodiment, there are provided compounds of the formula III, below: <br>
wherein:<br>
g is Oor 1;<br>
each R2 is independently selected from the group consisting of -H, -(C1-C6)alkyl, and aryl(C1-C3)alkyl, wherein -R2 and -(M)y-R1 may optionally be linked covalently to form a 5-, 6- or 7-membered substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle;<br>
each R3 is independently selected from -(C1-C6)alkyl;<br>
each R4 is independently selected from the group consisting of -H, and -(C1-C6)alkyl;<br>
Q is selected from the group consisting of -H, -(C1-C6)alkoxy, halogen, -(d-CeJalkyl and -NR42; and<br>
X1 is selected from the group consisting of (i), (ii) and (iii) below:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein X1 is optionally protected with one or more chemical protecting groups;<br>
Suitable protecting groups will be stable to reactions designed to derivatize the 3-amino group of formula III. Subsequently, said protecting groups are optionally removed to regenerate the X1.<br>
In another sub-embodiment, there are provided compounds of the formula Ilia, below: <br>
wherein X2 is selected from the group consisting of -NO2 and -NH2, wherein said -NH2 is optionally protected with a chemical protecting group.<br>
The strategy for synthesizing compounds of formula I involves derivatization of a primary or secondary amino group at the 3-position of formula Ilia. Such derivatizations of the 3-amino group include for example reactions to form carboxamides, sulfonamides alkyl amines, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, imines, guanidines, ureas, amidines, and amino ketones.<br>
The intermediate of formula Ilia also incorporates a nitro group or a<br>
protected amino group at the 5-position.    In the synthetic strategy, this 5-<br>
substituent serves as a second, latent amino group.   The use of this protecting<br>
group strategy allows for differential derivatization of these two amino groups, i.e.,<br>
the 3-amino group of formula Ilia and the moiety at the 5-position which is inert to<br>
the conditions of the derivatization of the 3-amino group.   Hence, the synthetic<br>
route involves first derivatizing the 3-amino group, followed by conversion of the 5-<br>
substituent to an amino group via either (a) deprotection, if X2 is a protected<br>
amine,  or (b) chemical reduction if X2 is a nitro group.     Hence,  from a<br>
retrosynthetic viewpoint, the synthetic route allows for differential derivatization of<br>
two amino groups, one at the 5-position which is protected (either with a chemical<br>
protecting group, or by being in a nitro oxidation state) and thereby inert to the conditions of the derivatization of the 3-amino group. Suitable chemical protecting groups for the 5-position protected amine, include for example, benzyl, 2,4-dimethoxy-benzyl and benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ). In a similar manner, when X2 is -NO2, the 3-amino group may be derivatized in the aforesaid manner. Subsequently the -NO2 group may optionally be chemically reduced to the corresponding 5-amino group via a variety of procedures known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Subsequently, the 5-amino group, generated by either reduction of a 5-nitro group or by removing a protecting group from a protected 5-amino compound, is optionally derivatized. Derivatization of the 5-amino group may be the same or different from the derivatization of the 3-amino group.<br>
According to a sub-embodiment of the aforesaid compounds of formula Ilia, compounds are provided wherein Q is -(C1-C6)alkoxy.<br>
According to another sub-embodiment of formula Ilia, Q is -OCH3.<br>
According to a further sub-embodiment of formula Ilia, R3 is -CH3. One such compound is (E)-2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-4-methoxy-3-amino-benzylsulfone.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the invention of formula I,<br>
Xis<br>
and R2 is -H, y is 0; and <br>
R1 is selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted aryl, substituted aryl, substituted heterocyclic, unsubstituted heterocyclic, -CO2R3, -C(=O)NR42, -CHR6R7, -C(=NH)-NR42 and a monovalent peptidyl moiety with a molecular weight of less than 1000.<br>
According to a third embodiment of the invention of formula I,<br>
Xis (Formula Removed) <br><br>
and y is 1; M is -(CH2)a-V-(CH2)b-; and V is -C(=O)-. According to a sub-embodiment thereof, compounds of the formula IV, below and salts thereof, are provided:<br>

wherein A is a moiety containing an electrophilic reactive center, said moiety selected from the group consisting of:<br>

(b)	an aryl halide moiety or aryl pseudo halide moiety.<br>
(c)	a carboxylic acid moiety activated with a leaving group, for example a carboxylic acid chloride moiety or a carboxylic acid anhydride moiety;<br>
(d)	a sulfonic acid moiety activated with a leaving group, for example a sulfonyl chloride moiety;<br>
(e)	a carbamic acid moiety activated with a leaving group, for example a carbamyl chloride moiety;<br>
(f)	a cyanate moiety, for example potassium cyanate;<br>
(g)	an aldehyde or ketone moiety, or a hydrate thereof or a ketal<br>
or acetal thereof;<br>
(h) a carboxylic acid moiety or an amino acid moiety, wherein an amide coupling agent is employed in the reaction; (i) a moiety that is the reaction product of the reaction of a substituted  thiourea  moiety  and  a   1-methyl-  or  1-phenyl-2-<br>
halopyridinium   salt,   preferably     2-chloro-1-methyl   pyridinium iodide, which iodide is also known as Mukaiyama's reagent; to form a compound of formula la:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
 (2)	optionally:<br>
(a)	when -X2 is -NH2 protected with a protecting group, removing said protecting group from -X2 to yield a compound of formula lb; or<br>
(b)	when -X2 is -NO2, chemically reducing said -NO2; to form a compound of formula lb:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
(3)	optionally coupling said compound of formula lb or a salt thereof,<br>
with a compound of formula XI:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein one or more functional groups comprising  R1  are optionally protected by chemical protecting groups; and A is defined as above; and<br>
(4)	optionally removing said protecting groups protecting functionalities<br>
comprising R1 to form a compound of formula I:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
or a salt thereof.<br>
In the aforesaid process of coupling compounds of formula Ilia to compounds of formula XI, and the coupling of compounds of formula lb to compounds of formula XI, the electrophile XI in the second coupling may be the same or different from that in the first coupling. Halides which may comprise a leaving group component of the electrophilic functionality A are preferably chloro, bromo or iodo. The term "pseudo halide" refers to a moiety which behaves like a halide in palladium or nickel-catalyzed amination reactions. Pseudo halide moieties include for example, triflates and mesylates.<br>
Carboxylic acid moieties (h) include for example, amino acids bearing optional protecting groups on any alpha-amino functionality, sidechain amino functionality, alpha carboxylic acid functionality, sidechain carboxylic acid functionality or other sidechain functionality that requires a protecting group. Such amino acids may be naturally occurring amino acids or synthetic amino acids including amino acids of either R- or S- absolute configuration.<br>
Additionally, in the aforesaid process of coupling compounds of formula Ilia to compounds of formula XI, and the coupling of compounds of formula lb to compounds of formula XI, the term "protecting group" or "chemical protecting group" refers to a derivative of a chemical functional group which is employed to derivatize chemical functionalities which would otherwise be incompatible with the conditions of a desired reaction. The protecting group renders this functionality stable to the desired reaction conditions and may later be removed to regenerate the de-protected functionality. One example of the use of protecting groups is in the common reaction of the amino group of a first amino acid with the carboxyl group of a second amino acid to form an amide bond.   However, since each<br>
reactant contains both an amino and a carboxylate functional group, the reaction between them is (1) nonspecific as to which amino group will react with which carboxyl group, and (2) subject to polymerization since the product of the reaction still contains both reactive moieties. A protecting group on the carboxylate of the first amino acid and a protecting group acid on the amino group of the second amino acid will serve to limit the reagents to the single desired reaction of the amino group of the first amino acid with the carboxylic acid of the second amino acid and yields a product which will not react further because both of the remaining reactive moieties are blocked by protecting groups which may be subsequently be removed.<br>
Any chemical functionality that comprises R1 may optionally be protected with a chemical protecting group if such a protecting group is useful in the synthesis of compounds of formula I. Appropriate protecting groups for functionalities comprising R1, include for example, such moieties as te/t-butoxy carbonyl (t-Boc) or 9-fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc).<br>
Additionally, in the aforesaid process of coupling compounds of formula Ilia to compounds of formula XI, and the optional coupling of compounds of formula lb to compounds of formula XI, amide coupling reagents (h) are compounds used to couple unactivated carboxylic acids to amino groups, such as the anilino moiety of a compound of formula I wherein -X is NH2 (i.e., wherein X is formula (i), y is 0, R1 is -H and R2 is -H). Such amide coupling reagents include for example, reagents such as diisopropyl carbodiimide and 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N.N.N'.N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU).<br>
Following the aforesaid process of coupling compounds of formula Ilia to compounds of formula XI, and the optional coupling of compounds of formula lb to compounds of formula XI, any protecting groups used in the synthesis of a compound of formula I are optionally removed.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, a process for preparing compounds according to formula Ilia is provided, comprising<br>
(1) chemically reducing a compound according to formula lla; and<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
 (2) optionally alkylating the resulting aniline via any suitable amine alkylation;<br>
to form a compound of formula Ilia;<br>
wherein: <br>
g isO or 1;<br>
each R3 is independently selected from -(C1-C6)alkyl;<br>
each R4 is independently selected from the group consisting of -H, and -(C1-C6)alkyl;<br>
Q is selected from the group consisting of -H, -(C1-C6)alkoxy, halogen, -(C1-C6)alkyl and -NR42; and<br>
X2 is selected from the group consisting of NO2 and -NH2, optionally protected with a chemical protecting group.<br>
or a salt of such a compound.<br>
The term "chemically reducing" or "chemical reduction" refers to a chemical reaction wherein a reactant which is reduced has a net gain of electrons. In the aforesaid process, a -NO2 functionality is reduced to an -NH2 functionality. This reduction reaction may be effected by a variety of procedures familiar to one of ordinary skill in synthetic chemistry. Such procedures include for example: catalytic hydrogenation using a catalyst such as, for example, palladium or<br>
platinum and a hydrogen source, which may be for example, introduction of H2 gas, or may be via a chemical generator of hydrogen such as hydrazine. Other procedures include for example, metal and metal salt reagents such as, for example, Sn°, Zn°, Fe° and SnCl2. Other reagents that accomplish this type of chemical reduction include for example, sulfite reagents such as sodium hydrosulfite.<br>
Suitable alkylations of an aniline nitrogen include:<br>
(a)	alkylation with an alkyl moiety having a leaving group, such as, for example an alkyl halide or an alkyl mesylate; or<br>
(b)	reductive amination, i.e., reaction with an aldehyde or a ketone in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoboro-hydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride.<br>

The styryl benzylsulfones are characterized by cis-trans isomerism resulting from the presence of a double bond. The compounds are named according to the Cahn-lngold-Prelog system, the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations, Section E: Stereochemistry, in Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY, 4th ed., 1992, p. 127-138. Using this system of nomenclature, the four groups about a double bond are prioritized according to a series of rules. Then, that isomer with the two higher ranking groups on the same side of the double bond is designated Z (for the German word "zusammen", meaning together). The other isomer, in which the two higher ranking groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, is designated E (for the German word "entgegen", which means "opposite").

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, certain substituted styryl benzylsulfone derivatives selectively kill various tumor cell types without killing normal cells.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the compounds affect the MAPK signal transduction pathway, thereby affecting tumor cell growth and viability. This cell growth inhibition is associated with regulation of the ERK and JNK types of MAPK. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the<br>
styryl sulfones of the present invention may block the phosphorylating capacity of ERK-2.<br>
The compounds of the invention inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells by inducing cell death.<br>
The compounds of the invention are believed effective against broad spectrum of cancer types of diverse histologic subtype and origin. Cancer types which may be treated by the present compounds include for example, those cancers listed and described in the National Cancer Institute's "CancerNet" at http://cancernet.nci.nih.gov/pdq/pdq_treatment.shtml, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
For example, the compounds of the invention may be used to kill primary or metastatic tumor or neoplastic cells in cancers of at least the following histologic subtypes: sarcoma (cancers of the connective and other tissue of mesodermal origin); melanoma (cancers deriving from pigmented melanocytes); carcinoma (cancers of epithelial origin); adenocarcinoma (cancers of glandular epithelial origin); cancers of neural origin (glioma/glioblastoma and astrocytoma); and hematological neoplasias, such as leukemias and lymphomas (e.g., acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and chronic myelocytic leukemia).<br>
The present compounds may also be used to kill primary or metastatic tumor or neoplastic cells in cancers having their origin in at least the following organs or tissues, regardless of histologic subtype: breast; tissues of the male and female urogenital system (e.g. ureter, bladder, prostate, testis, ovary, cervix, uterus, vagina); lung; tissues of the gastrointestinal system (e.g., stomach, large and small intestine, colon, rectum); exocrine glands such as the pancreas and adrenals; tissues of the mouth and esophagus; brain and spinal cord; kidney (renal); pancreas; hepatobiliary system (e.g., liver, gall bladder); lymphatic system; smooth and striated muscle; bone and bone marrow; skin; and tissues of the eye.<br>
Furthermore, the present compounds are believed effective in treating cancers or tumors in any prognostic stage of development, as measured, for example, by the "Overall Stage Groupings" (also called "Roman Numeral") or the Tumor, Nodes, and Metastases (TNM) staging systems.  Appropriate prognostic<br>
staging systems and stage descriptions for a given cancer are known in the art, for example as described in http://cancernet.nci.nih.gov/pdq/pdq_treatment.shtml, supra. The compounds do not kill normal cells in concentrations at which tumor cells are killed.<br>
The compounds are also believed useful in the treatment of non-cancer proliferative disorders. Non-cancer proliferative disorders are characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells with a benign phenotype, meaning that the cells evade only the normal controls on growth, but cannot metastasize. Non-cancer proliferative disorders which may be treated with the present compounds include, but are not limited to, the following: hemangiomatosis in newborn; secondary progressive multiple sclerosis; chronic progressive myelodegenerative disease; neurofibromatosis; ganglioneuromatosis; keloid formation; Paget's disease of the bone; fibrocystic disease (e.g., of the breast or uterus); sarcoidosis; Peyronie's fibrosis, Dupuytren's fibrosis, cirrhosis, atherosclerosis and vascular restenosis.<br>
Treatment of this broad range of tumor cells with the styryl benzylsulfone compounds of the invention leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptotic cell death.<br>
Tumor cells treated with the compounds of the invention accumulate in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. As the cells exit the G2/M phase, they appear to undergo apoptosis. Treatment of normal cells with the styryl benzylsulfones does not result in apoptosis.<br>
Methods of Preparation<br>
The intermediate (E)-styryl-3-nitrobenzylsulfones of formula II of the present invention may be prepared by a Knoevenagel condensation of aromatic aldehydes with benzylsulfonyl acetic acids. These intermediate nitro derivatives of formula II may then be reduced to the corresponding aniline derivatives and subsequently alkylated at the aniline nitrogen to give the intermediate (E)-styryl-3-aminobenzylsulfones of formula III. Said aniline alkylation may be by alkylation techniques well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, said aniline nitrogen may be alkylated by a SN2 reaction with an alkyl moiety comprising a leaving group such as a halide, a tosylate or a mesylate. Examples of such reagents include for example, methyl iodide and benzyl bromide. Another method<br>
of alkylating an aniline nitrogen is via a reductive amination with an aldehyde or a ketone in the presence of an appropriate reducing agent. Suitable reducing agents for this reaction include for example sodium cyanoborohydride and sodium triacetoxy borohydride, which will, at a slightly acidic pH, selectively reduce an imine intermediate in the presence of said aldehyde or ketone starting material, yielding an alkylated product of formula III.<br>
The Knoevenagel condensation is described by Reddy et a/., Acta. Chim. Hung. 115:269-71 (1984); Reddy era/., Sulfur Letters 13:83-90 (1991); Reddy et a/., Synthesis No. 4, 322-323 (1984); and Reddy et a/., Sulfur Letters 7:43-48 (1987), the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
According to the Scheme 1 below, the benzyl thioacetic acid C is formed by the reaction of sodium thioglycollate and a benzyl halide B. The benzyl thioacetic acid C is then oxidized with 30% hydrogen peroxide to give a corresponding benzylsulfonyl acetic acid D. Condensation of the benzylsulfonyl acetic acid D with an aromatic aldehyde E via a Knoevenagel reaction in the presence of benzylamine and glacial acetic acid yields the desired (E)-styryl-3-nitrobenzylsulfone F. The (E)-styryl-3-nitrobenzylsulfone F is then reduced via either palladium catalyzed hydrogenation with hydrazine hydrate as the hydrogen source or with Na2S2O4, and subsequently alkylated to give the desired (E)-styryl-3-aminobenzylsulfone INa.<br>

Scheme 1:<br>
The following is a more detailed two-part synthesis procedure for preparing (E)-styryl benzylsulfone intermediates according to the above scheme.<br>
General Procedure 1: Synthesis (E)-Styryl Benzylsulfones Part A.    To a solution of sodium hydroxide (8g, 0.2mol) in methanol (200mL), thioglycollic acid (0.1 mol) is added slowly and the precipitate formed is<br>
dissolved by stirring the contents of the flask. Then an appropriately substituted benzyl halide (0.1 mol) is added stepwise and the reaction mixture is refluxed for 2-3 hours. The cooled contents are poured onto crushed ice and neutralized with dilute hydrochloric acid (200ml_). The resulting corresponding benzylthioacetic acid (0.1 mol) is subjected to oxidation with 30% hydrogen peroxide (0.12mol) in glacial acetic acid (125mL) by refluxing for 1 hour. The contents are cooled and poured onto crushed ice. The separated solid is recrystalized from hot water to give the corresponding pure benzylsulfonylacetic acid, D.<br>
Part B. A mixture of the benzylsulfonyl acetic acid (10mmol), an appropriately substituted aromatic aldehyde, E (10mmol), and benzylamine (200ml_) in glacial acetic acid (12ml_) is refluxed for 2-3 hours. The contents are cooled and treated with cold ether (50ml_). Any product precipitated out is separated by filtration. The filtrate is diluted with more ether and washed successively with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate (20mL), sodium bisulfite (20ml_), dilute hydrochloric acid (20mL) and finally with water (35mL). Evaporation of the dried ethereal layer yields styryl benzylsulfones as a solid material.<br>
According to an alternative to Part A, the appropriate benzylsulfonylacetic acids may be generated by substituting a thioglycollate HSCH2COOR for thioglycollic acid, where R is an alkyl group, typically (C-i-Ce) alkyl. This leads to the formation of the alkylbenzylthioacetate intermediate (H),<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
which is then converted to the corresponding benzyl thioacetic acid B by alkaline<br>
or acid hydrolysis.<br>

In addition, reaction with substituted cyanate moieties will yield monosubstituted ureas. A synthetic procedure for this type of coupling is provided in Example 16.<br>

The aniline nitrogen of compounds of formula Ilia can also be reacted to form amino acid derivatives of formula XX, wherein the aniline nitrogen of Ilia is the alpha-amino moiety of an amino acid. As depicted in Scheme 9, below, these amino acid derivatives may be formed by reacting a compound of formula III with a carboxylic acid having a leaving group alpha to the carboxylate. For example, the starting carboxylate for the compound of Example 4 is methyl bromoacetate. Example 22 is another compound wherein the aniline nitrogen is derivatized as an amino acid (alanine).<br>

The styryl benzylsulfone compounds of the present invention may be derivatized with a chemical group to permit conjugation to a carrier molecule, for the purpose of raising antibodies to the styryl sulfones. Suitable derivatizing chemistries are well known to those skilled in the art. Preferably, the derivative comprises a carboxylic acid derivative. The carrier may comprise any molecule sufficiently large to be capable of generating an immune response in an appropriate host animal. One such preferred carrier is keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Additionally, R1 structural components (such as peptidyl substituents) of compounds of the present invention can themselves provide antigenic activity sufficient to raise antibodies to the styryl sulfones.<br>
Antibodies, preferably monoclonal antibodies and monospecific polyclonal antibodies, and most preferably tumor-specific antibodies may be covalently linked to compounds of the present invention. By "tumor-specific antibody" is meant, an antibody which specifically binds to a tumor antigen, e.g., an antigen on a tumor cell.<br>
The covalent linker between a compound of formula I or formula III and an antibody may in its simplest form, comprise a single covalent bond connecting the compound of formula I to the antibody. More commonly the compound of formula I is attached to the antibody using a suitable bifunctional linking reagent. The term "Afunctional linking reagent" refers generally to a molecule that comprises two reactive moieties which are connected by a spacer element. The term "reactive moieties" in this context, refers to chemical functional groups capable of coupling with an antibody or a compound of formula I by reacting with functional groups on the antibody and the compound of formula I or of formula III.<br>
two compounds in saturated NaHCO3 at 0°C according to the procedure of Bodanszky and Bodanszky, The Practice of Peptide Synthesis; Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 29-31 (1984)(the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). The product of the resulting reaction mixture is isolated by extraction into ethyl acetate, followed by washing with water, dried over Na2SO4, and is then concentrated in vacuo to produce N-hexylmaleimide as a light yellow oil. S-(N-Hexylsuccinimido)-modified antibody and formula I compound are then prepared from a cysteine-containing peptide and N-hexylmaleimide by mixing one part peptide with 1.5 parts N-hexylmaleimide in dimethylformamide (3.3 mL/mM peptide) followed by addition to 30 volumes of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. The S-alkylation reaction carried out in this manner is complete in 30 min. The resulting S-(N-hexylsuccinimido)-modified peptide monomer is purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC, followed by lyophilization as a fluffy, white powder.<br>
Bis-succinimidohexane peptide heterodimers (wherein one peptide is the antibody and the other peptide is a formula I compound wherein R1 is a peptidyl moiety), may be prepared according to the method of Cheronis et a/., supra from cysteine-substituted peptides. A mixture of one part bismaleimidohexane is made with two parts peptide monomer in dimethylformamide (3.3ml_/mM peptide) followed by addition to 0.1 ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature and is usually completed within 30min. The resulting bis-succinimidohexane peptide dimer is purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC. After lyophilization the material is a fluffy, white powder.<br>
Covalently linked adducts of the general formula l-L-Ab of the present invention, or of the formula lll-L-Ab when coupling to a compound of formula III, may be prepared by utilizing homo-bifunctional linking reagents (wherein the two reactive moieties are the same), such as, for example, disuccinimidyl tartrate, disuccinimidyl suberate, ethylene glycolbis-(succinimidyl succinate), 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene ("DFNB"), 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene ("DIDS"), and bis-maleimidohexane ("BMH"). The linking reaction occurs randomly between the Ab and a compound of formula I having a peptidyl moiety asR1.<br>
Alternatively, hetero-bifunctional linking reagents may be employed. Such agents include, for example, N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate ("SPDP"), sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyl-1-3'-dithiopropionate ("SASD", Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL), N-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxy-succinimidyl ester ("MBS"), m-maleimidobenzoylsulfosuccinimide ester ("sulfo-MBS"), N-succinimidyl(4-iodoacetyl)aminobenzoate ("SIAB"), succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate ("SMCC"), succinimidyl-4-(p-maleimidophenyl)butyrate ("SMPB"), sulfosuccinimidyl(4-iodoacetyl)amino-benzoate ("sulfo-SlAB"), sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate ("sulfo-SMCC"), sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(p-maleimidophenyl)-butyrate ("sulfo-SMPB"), bromoacetyl-p-aminobenzoyl-N-hydroxy-succinimidyl ester, iodoacetyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester, and the like.<br>
For hetero-bifunctional linking, a compound of formula I (or a compound of formula III) is derivatized with, for example, the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl portion of the Afunctional reagent, and the resulting derivatized compound is purified by chromatography. Next, a suitable tumor-specific Mab is reacted with the second functional group of the bifunctional linking reagent, assuring a directed sequence of binding between components of the desired adduct<br>
Typical hetero-bifunctional linking agents for forming protein-protein conjugates have an amino-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS-ester) as one functional group and a sulfhydryl reactive group as the other functional group. First, epsilon-amino groups of surface lysine residues of either the Mab or the formula I compound (or formula III compound) are acylated with the NHS-ester group of the cross-linking agent. The remaining component, possessing free sulfhydryl groups, is reacted with the sulfhydryl reactive group of the cross-linking agent to form a covalently cross-linked dimer. Common thiol reactive groups include for example, maleimides, pyridyl disulfides, and active halogens. For example, MBS contains a NHS-ester as the amino reactive group, and a maleimide moiety as the sulfhydryl reactive group.<br>
Photoactive hetero-bifunctional linking reagents, e.g., photoreactive phenyl azides, may also be employed. One such reagent, SASD, may be linked to either a Mab or to a formula I compound wherein R1 is a peptidyl moiety, via its NHS-ester group. The conjugation reaction is carried out at pH 7 at room temperature<br>
for about 10 minutes. Molar ratios between about 1 and about 20 of the cross-linking agent to the compounds to be linked may be used.<br>
Numerous bifunctional linkers, useful as linkers (-L-), exist which have<br>
been used specifically for coupling small molecules to monoclonal antibodies, and<br>
many of these are commercially available. Examples include N-succinimidyl-3-(2-<br>
pyridyldithio)-propionate        (SPDP),	2-iminothiolane	(2-IT),	3-(4-<br>
carboxamidophenyldithio)propionthioimidate	(CDPT),	N-succinimidyl-<br>
acetylthioacetate (SATA), ethyl-S-acetyl-propionthioimidate (AMPT) and N-succinimidyl-3-(4-carboxamidophenyldithio)propionate (SCDP). Procedures for preparation of immunoconjugates using these linkers is detailed in Toxin-Targeted Design for Anticancer Therapy. II: Preparation and Biological Comparison of Different Chemically Linked Gelonin-Antibody Conjugates (Cattel, et al, J. Pharm. Sci., 82:7, p699-704, 1993), (the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference).<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention the antibody comprises a tumor-specific antibody, more preferably a tumor-specific monoclonal antibody or a tumor-specific monospecific polyclonal antibody.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies may be advantageously cleaved by proteolytic enzymes to generate fragments retaining the antigen-binding site. For example, proteolytic treatment of IgG antibodies with papain at neutral pH generates two identical so-called "Fab" fragments, each containing one intact light chain disulfide-bonded to a fragment of the heavy chain (Fd). Each Fab fragment contains one antigen-combining site. The remaining portion of the IgG molecule is a dimer known as "Fc". Similarly, pepsin cleavage at pH 4 results in the so-called F(ab')2 fragment.<br>
Methods for preparation of such fragments are known to those skilled in the art. See, Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies Principles and Practice, Academic Press (1983), p. 119-123. Fragments of the anti-DBF-MAF monoclonal antibodies containing the antigen binding site, such as Fab and F(ab')2 fragments, may be preferred in therapeutic applications, owing to their reduced immunogenicity. Such fragments are less immunogenic than the intact antibody, which contains the immunogenic Fc portion.<br>
The effects of sensitization in the therapeutic use of animal origin monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of human disease may be diminished by employing a<br>
hybrid molecule generated from the same Fab fragment, but a different Fc fragment, than contained in Mab's previously administered to the same subject. It is contemplated that such hybrid molecules formed from the monoclonal antibodies of the invention may be used in therapy. The effects of sensitization are further diminished by preparing animal/human chimeric antibodies, e.g., mouse/human chimeric antibodies, or humanized {i.e. CDR-grafted) antibodies. Such monoclonal antibodies comprise a variable region, i.e., antigen binding region, and a constant region derived from different species.<br>
Chimeric animal-human monoclonal antibodies may be prepared by conventional recombinant DNA and gene transfection techniques well known in the art. The variable region genes of a mouse antibody-producing myeloma cell line of known antigen-binding specificity are joined with human immunoglobulin constant region genes. When such gene constructs are transfected into mouse myeloma cells, antibodies are produced which are largely human but contain antigen-binding specificities generated in mice. As demonstrated by Morrison et aL, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81, 6851-6855, 1984, both chimeric heavy chain V region exon (VH)-human heavy chain C region genes and chimeric mouse light chain V region exon (VK)-human K light chain gene constructs may be expressed when transfected into mouse myeloma cell lines. When both chimeric heavy and light chain genes are transfected into the same myeloma cell, an intact H2L2 chimeric antibody is produced. The methodology for producing such chimeric antibodies by combining genomic clones of V and C region genes is described in the above-mentioned paper of Morrison et aL, and by Boulianne et al., Nature 312, 642-646, 1984. Also see Tan et al., J. Immunol. 135, 3564-3567, 1985 for a description of high level expression from a human heavy chain promoter of a human-mouse chimeric K chain after transfection of mouse myeloma cells. As an alternative to combining genomic DNA, cDNA clones of the relevant V and C regions may be combined for production of chimeric antibodies, as described by Whitte et al., Protein Eng^ 1, 499-505, 1987 and Liu era/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA84, 3439-3443, 1987.<br>
For examples of the preparation of chimeric antibodies, see the following U. S. Patents: 5,292,867; 5,091,313; 5,204,244; 5,202,238; and 5,169,939. The entire disclosures of these patents, and the publications mentioned in the preceding paragraph, are incorporated herein by reference.    Any of these recombinant<br>
techniques are available for production of rodent/human chimeric anti-DBP-MAF monoclonal antibodies.<br>
To further reduce the immunogenicity of murine antibodies, "humanized" antibodies have been constructed in which only the minimum necessary parts of the mouse antibody, the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), are combined with human V region frameworks and human C regions (Jones et aL, Nature 321, 522-525, 1986; Verhoeyen et aL, Science 239, 1534-1536, 1988; Reichmann et aL, 322, 323-327, 1988; Hale era/.. Lancet2,1394-1399, 1988; Queen era/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 10029-10033, 1989). The entire disclosures of the aforementioned papers are incorporated herein by reference. This technique results in the reduction of the xenogeneic elements in the humanized antibody to a minimum. Rodent antigen binding sites are built directly into human antibodies by transplanting only the antigen binding site, rather than the entire variable domain, from a rodent antibody. This technique is available for production of chimeric rodent/human antibodies of reduced human immunogeneicity.<br>
Several such monoclonal antibodies, chimeric animal-human monoclonal antibodies, humanized antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof have been made available. Some examples include:<br>
Satumomab Pendetide (by Cytogen, a murine Mab directed against TAG-72);<br>
Igovomab (by CIS Bio, a murine Mab fragment Fab2 directed against tumor-associated antigen CA 125);<br>

Capromab Pentetate (by Cytogen, a murine Mab directed against tumor surface antigen PSMA);<br>

ABX-EGF (by Abgenix, a fully human monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr)); and<br>
Epratuzumab (by Immunomedics, a humanized, anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody).<br>
Hence, compounds of formula I can readily be covalently bonded to antibodies, preferably tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mab) via a suitable bifunctional linker (-L-) to yield a conjugate of general formula, l-L-Ab. In addition, compounds of formula III can be covalently bonded to antibodies (Ab), preferably tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mab) via a suitable bifunctional linker (-L-) to yield a conjugate of general formula, lll-L-Ab. A general synthetic route for preparing compounds of the present invention of general formula l-L-Ab or of formula lll-L-Ab, is depicted below in Scheme 11.<br>

In a variation of this strategy, antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) comprises administration of tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies to localize not the drug itself, but rather, an enzyme such as a p-lactamase to the tumor site. Then, cytotoxic compound according to the present invention, is appropriately derivatized into a prodrug designed to be a substrate to the p-lactamase. The prodrug is administered to the patient and a compound of formula I is released only when the prodrug reaches the tumor site and is bound to the tumor-localized enzyme. In a preferred embodiment, the prodrug is less cytotoxic than the p-lactamase-released drug, such that the therapeutic index of the prodrug is substantially elevated over that of the free drug. This is because the enzyme-released cytotoxic drug is effectively localized to the tumor site where the free drug is released on exposure to the tumor-localized lactamase enzyme.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may take the form of salts. The term "salts", embraces salts commonly used to form alkali metal salts and to form addition salts of free acids or free bases. The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable salt" refers to salts which possess toxicity profiles within a range so as to have utility in pharmaceutical applications. Pharmaceutically unacceptable salts may nonetheless possess properties such as high crystallinity, which have utility in the practice of the present invention. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from an inorganic acid or from an organic acid. Examples of such inorganic acids are hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, carbonic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid. Appropriate organic acids may be selected from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic, carboxylic and sulfonic classes of organic acids, example of which are formic, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, gluconic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, glucuronic, maleic, fumaric, pyruvic, aspartic, glutamic, benzoic, anthranilic, mesylic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, phenylacetic, mandelic, embonic (pamoic), methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, pantothenic, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, sulfanilic, cyclohexylaminosulfonic, stearic, alginic, beta-hydroxybutyric, salicylic, galactaric and galacturonic acid. Examples of pharmaceutically unacceptable acid addition salts include perchlorates and tetrafluoroborates.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical^ acceptable base addition salts of compounds of<br>
formula I include for example, metallic salts made from calcium, magnesium,<br>
potassium, sodium and zinc or organic salts made from N,N'-<br>
dibenzylethylenediamine,	chloroprocaine,	choline,	diethanolamine,<br>
ethylenediamine, meglumine (N-methylglucamine) and procaine. Examples of pharmaceutically unacceptable salts include lithium salts. All of these salts may be prepared by conventional means from the corresponding compound of formula I by reacting, for example, the appropriate acid or base with the compound of formula I.<br>
It will be understood that when compounds of the present invention contain one or more chiral centers, the compounds may exist in, and may be isolated as pure enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms or as racemic mixtures. The present invention therefore includes any possible enantiomers, diastereomers, racemates or mixtures thereof of Formula I which are biologically active in the treatment of cancer or other proliferative disease states.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The active ingredient in such formulations may comprise from 0.1 to 99.99 weight percent. By "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" is meant any carrier, diluent or excipient which is compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered to individuals (mammals, including animals and humans) afflicted with cancer.<br>
The compounds are also useful in the treatment of non-cancer proliferative disorders, that is, proliferative disorders which are characterized by benign indications. Such disorders may also be known as "cytoproliferative" or "hyperproliferative" in that cells are made by the body at an atypically elevated rate, but do not escape normal position controls (i.e., have no metastatic potential). Such disorders include, but are not limited to, the following: hemangiomatosis in newborn; secondary progressive multiple sclerosis; chronic progressive myelodegenerative disease; neurofibromatosis; ganglioneuromatosis; keloid formation; Paget's disease of the bone; fibrocystic disease (e.g., of the breast or uterus); sarcoidosis; Peyronie's, cirrhosis, atherosclerosis and vascular<br>
restenosis.<br>
The compounds may be administered by any route, including oral and parenteral administration. Parenteral administration includes, for example, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intranasal, rectal, intravaginal, intravesical (e.g., to the bladder), intradermal, topical, sublingual or subcutaneous administration. Also contemplated within the scope of the invention is the instillation of drug in the body of the patient in a controlled formulation, with systemic or local release of the drug to occur at a later time. For example, the drug may be localized in a depot for controlled release to the circulation, or for release to a local site of tumor growth.<br>
The active agent is preferably administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier selected on the basis of the selected route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The active agent may be formulated into dosage forms according to standard practices in the field of pharmaceutical preparations. See Alphonso Gennaro, ed., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., (1990) Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA. Suitable dosage forms may comprise, for example, tablets, capsules, solutions, parenteral solutions, troches, suppositories, or suspensions.<br>
For parenteral administration, the active agent may be mixed with a suitable carrier or diluent such as water, an oil (particularly a vegetable oil), ethanol, saline solution, aqueous dextrose (glucose) and related sugar solutions, glycerol, or a glycol such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol. Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water-soluble salt of the active agent. Stabilizing agents, antioxidizing agents and preservatives may also be added. Suitable antioxidizing agents include for example, sulfite, ascorbic acid, citric acid and its salts, and sodium EDTA. Suitable preservatives include for example, benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propyl-paraben, and chlorbutanol. The composition for parenteral administration may take the form of an aqueous or nonaqueous solution, dispersion, suspension or emulsion.<br>
For oral administration, the active agent may be combined with one or more solid inactive ingredients for the preparation of tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules or other suitable oral dosage forms. For example, the active agent may be combined with at least one excipient such as fillers, binders,<br>
humectants, disintegrating agents, solution retarders, absorption accelerators, wetting agents absorbents or lubricating agents. According to one tablet embodiment, the active agent may be combined with carboxymethylcellulose calcium, magnesium stearate, mannitol and starch, and then formed into tablets by conventional tableting methods.<br>
The specific dose of compound according to the invention to obtain therapeutic benefit will, of course, be determined by the particular circumstances of the individual patient including, the size, weight, age and sex of the patient, the nature and stage of the disease, the aggressiveness of the disease, and the route of administration. For example, a daily dosage of from about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg/day may be utilized. Higher or lower doses are also contemplated.<br>
The practice of the invention is illustrated by the following non-limiting examples. In each of the following examples, the substituted benzylsulfonyl acetic acid was made according to Part A of General Procedure 1: Synthesis (E)-Styryl Benzylsulfones, above. The styryl benzylsulfone compounds were recrystalized from 2-propanol and the purity was checked by thin layer chromatography.<br>

To a cold solution of sodium hydroxide (9.75g, 240mmol) in methanol (200mL), thioglycollic acid (11.25g, 120mmol) was added slowly over 30 minutes. Sodium thioglycollate precipitated was dissolved by stirring and warming up the solution.  The solution was cooled  to  room  temperature and 4-methoxy-3-<br>
nitrobenzyl chloride (30.Og, 120mmol) was added in portions to reduce the intensity of exothermic reaction. The reaction mixture was then refluxed for 4 hours, cooled and poured onto crushed ice (1 Kg) containing hydrochloric acid (50mL). The precipitate formed was filtered, washed with ice cold water and dried under vacuum. (30.0g, 95% yield) m.p. 130-132°C.<br>
Step 3: Synthesis of 4-Methoxv-3-Nitrobenzylsulfonvlacetic acid:<br>
4-Methoxy-3nitrobenzylthioacetic acid (10 g) was dissolved in glacial acetic acid (80mL) and 30% hydrogen peroxide (20mL) was added in one portion and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 hours. The contents of the flask were cooled and poured on to crushed ice (500g). A yellow precipitate formed, and was filtered, washed with cold water and dried (55% yield).

A solution of (E)-2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-4-methoxy-3-nitrobenzylsulfone (1.3mmol) in acetone-water (10:5) was heated to 50°C. After 30 min, sodium hydrosulfite (Na2S2O4) (26.3mmol) was added slowly, and the mixture was heated at reflux (50°C, 1 h.), cooled to room temperature and water was added. The product was rinsed with NaHCO3, and then isolated by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was<br>
removed under reduced pressure and the crude product was recrystallized from 2-propanol, m.p.148-150°C.<br>
The reduction of (E)- 2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-4-methoxy-3-nitrobenzylsulfone to (E)-2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-4-methoxy-3-aminobenzylsulfone was also performed by the following method.<br>
Reduction of (E)-2,4,6-Trimethoxystyryl-4-methoxv-3-nitrobenzvlsulfone: Method 2:<br>
5% Pd/C wet (10% by weight of the nitro compound) was charged into a flask. Pd/C was wetted with ethanol by slowly adding through the sides of the flask. The nitro compound (10mmol) is added to the flask and then 20 volume equivalents of ethanol is added. The temperature of the flask was raised to 50-60°C. Then hydrazine hydrate (26 equivalents) is added over a period of 15-20 min. It is then refluxed for 5-6 hours. The completion of the reaction was monitored every hour by TLC. After completion of the reaction, Pd/C was filtered while the solution was hot and the filtrate was washed with 2 volumes of hot ethanol. The volume of ethanol was reduced to 50% by distilling under reduced pressure and 10 volumes of ice cold water was added. The solution was stirred for 30min and the precipitated solid was filtered and dried under vacuum and recrystallized from 2-propanol to give 2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-4-methoxy-3-aminobenzylsulfone, m.p. 148-150°C.<br>
General Method A: Synthesis of (E)-2,4,6-Trimethoxvstyrvl-3-amino-substituted-4-methoxybenzylsulfone derivatives<br>
A solution of 1-chlorocarbonyl ester (10 mmol) and triethylamine (10 mmol) in dichloromethane (40 mL) was stirred for 10 min. at room temperature. (E)-2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-3-amino-4-methoxybenzylsulfone (10 mmol) in dichloromethane (20 mL) was added dropwise. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The organic layer was separated, washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Volatiles were removed under vacuum to give the product ester in 80% yield.<br>
The ester (1 g) was taken up in 4% aqueous sodium hydroxide (50 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. Subsequently, concentrated hydrochloric acid was added dropwise until a solid precipitate formed. The precipitate was separated by filtration, washed with water and recrystallized from 2-propanol to give the desired product.<br>
General Method B: Synthesis of (E)-2,4,6-Trimethoxystyryl- 3-Aminosubstituted-4-Methoxybenzylsulfone Derivatives.<br>
Sodium acetate (0.4 mol) was dissolved in methanol (200 mL). An alkyl halide (0.4 mol) was added and the resulting mixture was refluxed for 10 minutes. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and (E)-2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-3-amino-4-methoxybenzylsulfone (0.1 mol) was added. The resulting mixture was heated to reflux for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was then concentrated the residue was poured to ice water. A solid precipitate formed. The precipitate was separated by filtration and recrystallized from ethanol to give the desired amino substituted ester.<br>
The ester compound (0.1 mol) was taken up in ethanol (200 mL) and sodium hydroxide (20% aqueous solution, 200 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 2.5 hours.
