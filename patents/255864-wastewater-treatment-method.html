SPECIFICATION<br>
WASTEWATER TREATMENT METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a wastewater treatment method that uses a<br>
submerged membrane separation activated sludge process for treating organic<br>
wastewater.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A membrane separation activated sludge process, which is a type of wastewater<br>
treatment method, consists of submerging a membrane cartridge in an activated<br>
sludge tank and carrying out solid-liquid separation to separate the activated sludge<br>
and treated liquid by filtration. Since this method allows solid-liquid separation to be<br>
carried out at an extremely high activated sludge (mixed liquor suspended solid:<br>
MLSS) concentration of 5000 to 20000 mg/l, it offers the advantages of being able to<br>
reduce the volume of the activated sludge tank or shorten the reaction time in the<br>
activated sludge tank. In addition, since suspended solids (SS) do not contaminate<br>
the treated water due to the use of membrane filtration, a final sedimentation tank is<br>
not required, the area of the treatment facility site can be reduced and solid-liquid<br>
separation can be carried out regardless of the ease of settling of the activated sludge,<br>
thereby resulting in rapid proliferation of this process in recent years since it offers<br>
numerous advantages such as being able reduce the burden of activated sludge<br>
management.<br>
Fiat sheet membranes or hollow fiber membranes are used for the membrane<br>
cartridge. In a membrane separation activated sludge process, since the effective<br>
membrane surface area is reduced resulting in a decrease in filtration efficiency due<br><br>
to the adherence to the membrane surface of biopolymers metabolized by<br>
microorganisms in the activated sludge, the activated sludge itself or contaminants<br>
contained in the wastewater, there are cases in which it is difficult to maintain stable<br>
filtration for a long period of time. At this time, backwashing may be carried out in<br>
which a medium such as filtered water is effused in the opposite direction from the<br>
direction of filtration to remove adhered substances on the surface of the membrane.<br>
In the past, in order to avoid this accumulation of activated sludge aggregates,<br>
contaminants and the like on the membrane surface and between the membranes,<br>
the membranes were aerated with air and the like from the bottom of the membrane<br>
cartridge, thereby causing activated sludge aggregates, contaminants and the like to<br>
be separated from the membrane surface and between the membranes due to<br>
vibration effects of the membranes and agitation effects produced by the upward<br>
movement of air bubbles. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.<br>
2000-157846 (Patent document 1) discloses a hollow fiber membrane cartridge in<br>
which a cartridge head is fastened to be liquid-tight to the outer periphery of one end<br>
of a hollow fiber bundle and a skirt is fastened to be liquid-tight to the outer periphery<br>
of the other end to allow the hollow fiber membrane to vibrate at the maximum<br>
amplitude within an allowed range during aeration, a hollow portion of the end of the<br>
hollow fiber membrane on the side of the cartridge head is open, a hollow portion of<br>
the end of the hollow fiber membrane on the side of the skirt is sealed, and a plurality<br>
of through holes are provided in an adhesive fixing layer on the side of the skirt.<br>
However, stable solid-liquid separation may not be able to be carried out<br>
depending on the composition of the organic wastewater flowing into the activated<br>
sludge tank even if aeration and backwashing are carried out unless activated sludge<br>
treatment conditions are set properly. This is thought to be because numerous<br>
components are excreted that cause microorganisms to clog the membrane:<br><br>
On the other hand, susceptibility to clogging can be reduced by increasing the<br>
concentration of the activated sludge, reducing the amount of organic matter that<br>
flows into the activated sludge, or setting a lower membrane filtration permeation flux.<br>
However, excessive use of such methods has the problem of decreasing the<br>
efficiency of wastewater treatment.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a method that allows<br>
solid-liquid separation of activated sludge and a treated liquid to be carried out stably<br>
and efficiently by appropriately evaluating the risk of clogging prior to membrane<br>
clogging and adopting necessary and adequate countermeasures.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
As a result of conducting extensive studies, the inventors of the present<br>
invention found that substances that impair filtration by adhering to the outer surface<br>
of a membrane are bjopolymers composed mainly of sugars that have a molecular<br>
weight of several hundred thousand to several million. Moreover, the inventors of the<br>
present invention found that the ease of biodegradation of organic wastewater is<br>
dependent on the ratio between biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which measures<br>
the concentration of organic matter resulting from biodegradation, and total organic<br>
carbon (TOC), which enables measurement of nearly all organic components<br>
contained in organic wastewater, total oxygen demand (TOD) or chemical oxygen<br>
demand using potassium dichromate (CODcr). Thus, studies were conducted on a<br>
method for suitably evaluating the risk of membrane clogging by determining the ratio<br>
between BOD and TOC, TOD or CODCr in the form of a γ value and using that γ value.<br><br>
As a result, it was touna tnat when treating poorly degradable organic<br>
wastewater having a γ value of 0.6 to less than 1.5, there are no increases in sugar<br>
concentrations if the BOD-sludge load is set to 0.05 - 0.06 x (5 - 0.6)<br>
[(kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS] or less. In addition, it was found that sugar concentrations<br>
can be prevented from increasing and stable filtration can be continued by adjusting<br>
the BOD-sludge load to 0.1 - 0.12 x (5 - 0.6) [(kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS] or less when<br>
the γ value is such that 1.5 
- 0.6) [(kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS] or less when treating easily biodegradable organic<br>
wastewater having a γ value of 2.5 or more.<br>
Here, 5 indicates average membrane filtration flux. The average membrane<br>
filtration flux refers to the flow rate per unit membrane surface area per day, and is<br>
determined by dividing the value obtained by subtracting the backwashing flow<br>
volume from the filtration flow volume by the membrane surface area.<br>
According to these formulas, the upper limit of the BOD-sludge load can be<br>
increased by decreasing the average membrane filtration flux 5. Thus, the inventors<br>
of the present invention confirmed that stable operation can be continued by reducing<br>
the membrane filtration flux even if sugar concentration increases.	<br>
Here, the BOD-sludge load is represented by the equation below.<br>
BOD-sludge load = (BOD x average membrane filtration flux x membrane<br>
surface area) / (MLSS x activated sludge volume)<br>
As can be understood from this equation, the BOD-sludge load refers to the<br>
amount of BOD components that flow into the activated sludge tank in one day per<br>
unit sludge weight (MLSS concentration x activated sludge volume), and represents<br>
the amount of BOD components attributable to unit microorganisms per day in units of<br>
(kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS.<br>
In addition, γ = BOD/(a x p), and p is one of the parameters selected from the<br><br>
previously defined total organic carbon (TOC) [mg/L] in the organic wastewater,<br><br>
chemical oxygen demand using potassium dichromate (CODCr) [mg/L] or total oxygen<br>
demand (TOD) [mg/L], where<br>
BOD indicates the biological oxygen demand [mg/L] in the organic wastewater,<br>
a is an adjustment coefficient based on β, and<br>
α = 1.0 in the case of selecting TOC for β,<br>
α = 0.33 in the case of selecting CODCr for β, or<br>
α = 0.33 in the case of selecting TOD for β.<br>

Advantageous Effects of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, by suitably evaluating the risk of clogging<br>
according to a γ value of organic wastewater, and adjusting a BOD-sludge load based<br>
on that value, membrane clogging in an activated sludge tank can be suppressed in<br>
advance when that risk is high. In addition, efficiency can be enhanced by utilizing<br>
solid-liquid separation capacity without waste in cases when the risk is low. The<br>
. BOD-sludge load can be easily controlled by adjusting MLSS concentration, activated<br>
sludge volume, the amount of organic matter flowing into the activated sludge tank<br><br>
and membrane surface area, in other words, in the case of, for example, poorly<br>
biodegradable organic wastewater (that in which the γ value is comparatively low), by<br>
increasing the amount of activated sludge or reducing the amount of organic matter<br>
flowing into the activated sludge tank, the BOD-sludge load can be set to a lower<br>
value by increasing the amount of microorganisms relative to the amount of inflowing<br>
organic matter. On the other hand, in the case of easily biodegradable organic<br>
wastewater (that in which the γ value is comparatively high), since the upper limit of<br>
the BOD-sludge load can be set higher, solid-liquid separation efficiency can be<br>
enhanced by setting a smaller amount of microorganisms relative to the amount of<br>
inflowing organic matter.<br>
In addition, the upper limit of the BOD-sludge load can be increased by reducing<br>
average membrane filtration flux δ. Thus, membrane clogging can also be prevented<br>
in advance by setting the value of 5 so that the upper limit of the BOD-sludge load<br>
exceeds the value of the actual BOD-sludge load.<br>
In general, there is the possibility of worsening the quality of treated water if<br>
treated under conditions of easily biodegradable organic wastewater even though<br>
poorly biodegradable wastewater is actually flowing into the activated sludge tank.<br>
However, a constant and satisfactory level of treated water quality can be secured by<br>
adjusting treatment conditions according to the method of the present invention.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The following provides an explanation of preferable embodiments of the<br>
wastewater treatment method as claimed in the present invention.<br>
The wastewater treatment method as claimed in the present invention can be<br>
carried out using, for example, the apparatus shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 1, organic<br>
wastewater 1 that flows into a membrane separation activated sludge tank is removed<br><br>
of contaminants by pretreatment equipment 2 such as a fine mesh screen or drum<br>
screen, after which it is temporarily retained in a flow equalization tank 3.<br>
Subsequently, the organic wastewater 1 is fed to a membrane separation activated<br>
sludge tank (aeration tank) 4 at a constant flow rate from the flow equalization tank 3<br>
to maintain a constant membrane filtration flux in the membrane separation<br>
apparatus.<br>
In membrane separation activated sludge tank (aeration tank) 4,<br>
microorganisms degrade and remove organic matter (BOD) in the organic wastewater<br>
1. Solid-liquid separation of the activated sludge mixture in membrane separation<br>
activated sludge tank 4 is carried out in a submerged separation membrane apparatus<br>
5 submerged in the membrane separation activated sludge tank 4, and a filtrate 9 is<br>
detoxified in a sterilization tank 10 as necessary to obtain treated water 11.<br>
In membrane separation activated sludge tank (aeration tank) 4,<br>
microorganisms degrade BOD components in the organic wastewater and proliferate.<br>
As was previously described, the inventors of the present invention found that<br>
the risk of separation membrane clogging can be avoided by analyzing the water<br>
quality of organic wastewater flowing into an activated sludge tank (measuring BOD<br>
and TOC, CODCr or TOD), calculating a γ value by using TOC, CODCr or TOD,<br>
determining the upper limit of a BOD-sludge load according to that γ value, and<br>
controlling the actual value of the BOD-sludge load so that it is below that upper limit<br>
value.<br>
Time-based changes in the γ value of organic wastewater can be easily<br>
determined by periodically measuring BOD, TOC, TOD and CODCr values, for<br>
example, once every few days or once every few weeks, and the determining the ratio<br>
of BOD/TOC, BOD/CODcr or BOD/TOD.<br>
Normally, the value of γ is roughly the same regardless of whether using TOC,<br><br>
TOD or CODcr- Although the γ values of any of these parameters can be suitably<br>
selected by a person with ordinary skill in the art in the case each γ value differs and<br>
each γ value falls within a range to which different formulas are applied, it is preferable<br>
to use these parameters in the order that allows total organic content to be measured<br>
more accurately, namely in the order of priority of TOD, CODCr and TOC.<br>
Furthermore, each of the values of BOD, TOC, TOD and CODCr can be<br>
measured according to methods described in, for example, JIS K 0102.<br>
Since MLSS concentration is increased by reducing the amount of sludge<br>
extracted from the activated sludge tank or the amount of organic wastewater flowing<br>
into the activated sludge tank is decreased or diluted in cases in which the γ value is<br>
0.6 to less than 1.5, namely in the case of poorly biodegradable organic wastewater,<br>
the BOD-sludge load is adjusted to 0.05 - 0.06 x (5 - 0.6) [(kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS] or<br>
less. In the case the γ value is 1.5 to less than 2.5, the BOD-sludge load is adjusted<br>
to 0.1 - 0.12 x (5 - 0.6) [(kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS] or less. In the case the γ value is<br>
2.5 or higher, the BOD-sludge load is adjusted to 0.3 - 0.24 x (5 - 0.6)<br>
[(kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS] or less. As a result of adjusting in this manner, clogging of<br>
the* separation membrane can be prevented while allowing stable and efficient<br>
continuation of solid-liquid separation by the separation membrane without impairing<br>
the quality of treated water.<br>
In addition, the upper limit of the BOD-sludge load as determined with the above<br>
formula can be increased by decreasing the average membrane filtration flux 5 of the<br>
membrane separation apparatus. Thus, by setting the value of 5 within a range that<br>
yields an upper limit that exceeds the actual BOD-sludge load, clogging of the<br>
separation membrane can be prevented while allowing stable and efficient<br>
continuation of solid-liquid separation by the separation membrane without impairing<br>
the quality of treated water.<br><br>
Furthermore, the present invention can be applied even in the case the<br>
membrane separation activated sludge tank (aeration tank) 4 is an aerobic<br>
tank-oxygen-free tank for denitrification. In addition, the present invention can also<br>
be applied in the case the separation membrane apparatus is provided after the<br>
activated sludge tank.<br>
Examples<br>
Although the following provides an explanation of examples of the present<br>
invention, the present invention is not limited by these examples.<br>
(Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2)<br>
Changes in membrane filtration flux in a membrane separation activated sludge<br>
process were confirmed by adjusting BOD-sludge load according to the method<br>
described below.<br>
First, a membrane separation activated sludge experiment was carried out using<br>
three types of organic wastewater consisting of sugar refinery wastewater (y value:<br>
1.9), cleaner plant wastewater (y value: 1.3) and tofu plant wastewater (y value: 4.4),<br>
followed by an evaluation of stable membrane filtration flux for various BOD-sludge<br>
loads. A membrane module having a membrane surface area of 0.015 m2 and<br>
consisting of a bundle of a large number of hollow fiber precision filtration membranes<br>
made of PVDF having a pore diameter of 0.1 µm was used for the separation<br>
membrane apparatus. Membrane aeration consisted of feeding in air from the<br>
bottom of the membrane module at a flow rate of 200 L/h. Here, stable membrane<br>
filtration flux is defined as that demonstrating an increase in membrane filtration<br>
pressure from the initial pressure of no more than 10 kPa even after 20 days have<br>
elapsed since the start of operation.<br>
The results are shown in FIG. 2. In all cases, when the BOD-sludge load was<br>
high, stable membrane filtration flux was low and stable membrane filtration flux<br><br>
conversely increased wnen tne Bod-sludge load was set to a low level, in addition,<br>
different curves were depicted depending on the type of wastewater. In the case of a<br>
BOD/TOC, or γ value, of 1.3, although stable membrane filtration flux was 0.8 m/D<br>
when the BOD-sludge load was 0.03 (Example 1), stable membrane filtration flux was<br>
0.3 m/D when the BOD-sludge load was 0.06 (Comparative Example 1). In the case<br>
of a BOD/TOC value, or γ value, or 1.9, although stable membrane filtration flux was<br>
0.7 m/D when the BOD-sludge load was 0.07 (Example 2), stable membrane filtration<br>
flux was 0.2 m/D when the BOD-sludge load was 0.13 (Comparative Example 2). In<br>
the case of a BOD/TOC value, or γ value, of 4.4, stable membrane filtration flux was<br>
0.65 m/D even when the BOD-sludge load was 0.12 (Example 3).<br>
Thus, the BOD-sludge load to be set in the solid-liquid separation step carried<br>
out by the separation membrane apparatus was able to confirmed to differ according<br>
to the BOD/TOC value (= γ value).<br>
(Examples 4 to 9 and Comparative Examples 3 to 8)<br>
A separation membrane apparatus, consisting of a module containing precision<br>
filtration hollow fiber membranes made of PVDF manufactured by Asahi Kasei<br>
Chemicals Corp. and having a pore diameter of 0.1 µm, was submerged in an<br>
activated sludge tank having an activated sludge volume of 10 L followed by treatment<br>
of various wastewater using a membrane separation activated sludge process.<br>
Membrane aeration consisted of feeding in air from the bottom of the membrane<br>
module at a flow rate of 200 NL/h. The retention time of the wastewater in the<br>
activated sludge tank was 18 hours. Water quality of the wastewater was analyzed<br>

pressure immediately after the start of operation was 4 kPa. The membrane filtration<br>
pressure on day 20 after the start of operation was 10 kPa (Example 4).<br>

Subsequently, when the membrane module was washed and operation was<br>
carried out after setting the membrane filtration flux to 0.2 m/D while maintaining the<br>
BOD-sludge load by adjusting the membrane surface area (upper limit of BOD-sludge<br>

m/D. The upper limit of the BOD-sludge load was determined to be 0.1<br>
[(kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS]. CODCr at this time was 1400 mg/L and the γ value was<br>
1.62. The BOD-sludge load was set to 0.1 [(kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS] by making the<br>
MLSS concentration 10000 mg/L. The membrane filtration pressure immediately<br>
after the start of operation was 4 kPa. The membrane filtration pressure on day 20<br>
after the start of operation was 11 kPa (Example 6).<br>
Since the filtration pressure had stabilized, when the BOD-sludge load was set<br>
to 0.12 [(kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS] by adjusting the BOD of the same wastewater to 900<br>
mg/L on day 21, the filtration pressure reached 37 kPa on day 25 (Comparative<br>

(Comparative Example 13).<br><br>
(6) Meat processing plant wastewater was treated using a membrane separation<br>
activated sludge process by adjusting the BOD to 2200 mg/L by diluting with water<br>
using a membrane surface area of 0.022 m2 and setting the membrane filtration flux to<br>

the BOD-sludge load is set to 0.05 - 0.06 x (5 - 0.6) [(kg/day-BOD/kg-MLSS] or less, in<br>
the case the γ value is such that 1.5 
x (5 - 0.6) [(kg/day-BOD/kg-MLSS] or less, and in the case the γ value is such that γ &gt;<br>
2.5, the BOD-sludge load is set to 0.3 - 0.24 x (5 - 0.6) [(kg/day-BOD/kg-MLSS] or less.<br>
As a result, stable solid-liquid separation can be carried out while maintaining a low<br>
filtration pressure without causing membrane clogging.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
(Example 22)<br>
A separation membrane apparatus, consisting of a module containing precision<br>
filtration hollow fiber membranes made of PVDF and having a pore diameter of 0.1 µm<br>
(membrane surface area: 0.015 m2), was submerged in an activated sludge tank<br>
having an effective volume of 10 L followed by treating wastewater from a cleaner<br>
plant using a membrane separation activated sludge process. The retention time of<br>
the wastewater in the activated sludge tank was 18 hours. The water quality of the<br>
wastewater was analyzed once a day. The membrane filtration flux was set to 0.6<br>
m/D. Membrane aeration consisted of feeding in air from the bottom of the<br>
membrane module at a flow rate of 200 L/h. The results of operation are shown in<br>
FIG. 3.<br>
Analysis of water quality of the wastewater prior to the start of operation yielded<br>
results consisting of BOD: 700 mg/L, TOC: 350 mg/L, CODCr: 1100 mg/L and TOD:<br>
1150. Since the γ values at this time ranged from 1.8 to 2.0, the experiment was<br>
started by setting the BOD-sludge load to 0.07 (kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS. The initial<br>
MLSS concentration of the activated sludge was 10 g/L and the MLSS concentration<br>
was maintained at 10 g/L by extracting sludge to adjust the amount of sludge. Stable<br>
operation was able to be carried out without any increases in filtration pressure<br>
through day 7 by setting the BOD-sludge load to a suitable range corresponding to the <br>
γ value.<br>
As a result of analyzing the water quality of the wastewater on days 7 to 15, the y<br><br>
values were touna to pe aDoui i.z. i-uiration pressure Degan iu rise siaiuny aiuunu<br>
day 10 of operation and operation was stopped on day 15 since it had reached 27 kPa<br>
at that time.<br>
Operation was then resumed after washing the membrane module, replacing<br>
the sludge and setting the MLSS of the initially loaded sludge to 15 g/L. The MLSS<br>
concentration was maintained at 15 g/L by extracting sludge to adjust the amount of<br>
sludge while monitoring measured MLSS values. As a result of analyzing the water<br>
quality of the wastewater, since γ values were about 2 from days 16 to 30 of operation,<br>
when the wastewater was diluted with water on day 16 to adjust the amount of organic<br>
matter flowing into the activated sludge tank and set the BOD-sludge load to 0.05<br>
(kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS, filtration pressure did not rise for six days thereafter.<br>
MLSS was maintained at 5 g/L on day 22 of operation by increasing the amount<br>
of sludge extracted for the purpose of reducing the amount of air in the activated<br>
sludge. The BOD-sludge load at this time was 0.15 (kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS. Since<br>
the pressure began to rise immediately after lowering the MLSS and filtration pressure<br>
reached 13 kPa on day 27 of operation, another activated sludge tank having an<br>
effective volume of 10 L was connected and the BOD-sludge load was set to 0.075<br>
(kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS. This resulted in the filtration pressure decreasing to 11<br>
kPa.<br>
As has been described above, no matter which method is used to adjust the<br>
BOD-sludge load by applying the present invention, whether it be increasing or<br>
decreasing the activated sludge concentration, increasing or decreasing the activated<br>
sludge volume, or increasing or decreasing the amount of organic matter that flows<br>
into the activated sludge tank, stable solid-liquid separation was confirmed to be able<br>
to be carried out without causing membrane clogging.<br>
(Example 23)<br><br>
Wastewater from a chemical and pharmaceutical plant was treated using a<br>
membrane separation activated sludge process. Operation was carried out by<br>
setting the membrane filtration flux to 0.6 m/D throughout the course of operation.<br>
Membrane aeration consisted of feeding in air from the bottom of the membrane<br>
module at a flow rate of 200 L/h.<br>
Analysis of water quality prior to the start of operation yielded results consisting<br>
of BOD: 30 mg/L and TOC: 100 mg/L, and the γ value was 0.3. A separation<br>
membrane apparatus, consisting of a module containing precision filtration hollow<br>
fiber membranes made of PVDF and having a pore diameter of 0.1 |im (membrane<br>
surface area: 0.15 m2), was submerged in an activated sludge tank having an<br>
effective volume of 10 L followed by setting the MLSS concentration to10 g/L and<br>
beginning operation. At this time, the BOD-sludge load was 0.027<br>
(kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS. Although the initial membrane filtration pressure was 5 kPa,<br>
it increased to 20 kPa on day 20 of operation.<br>
BOD was then adjusted to 160 mg/L, TOC was adjusted to 150 mg/L and the γ value was set to 1.1 by dissolving peptone in the wastewater. A separation<br>
membrane apparatus having a membrane surface area of 0.03 m2 was submerged in<br>
an activated sludge tank having an effective volume of 10 L followed by setting the<br>
MLSS concentration to 10 g/L and beginning operation. At this time, the BOD-sludge<br>
load was 0.029 (kg/day)-BOD/kg-MLSS. The initial membrane filtration pressure<br>
was 5 kPa, and the membrane filtration pressure 20 days later was 8 kPa.<br>
As has been described above, as a result of applying the present invention to organic<br>
wastewater having a γ value of less than 0.6 by adding a substance having a large γ value in the form of peptone, stable solid-liquid separation was confirmed to be able to<br>
be carried out without causing membrane clogging.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
Title: WASTEWATER TREATMENT METHOD<br>
A wastewater treatment method comprising:<br>
an inflow step of causing organic wastewater to flow into an activated sludge tank housing an<br>
activated sludge; and a separation step of biologically treating the organic wastewater in the<br>
activated sludge tank with the activated sludge, and carrying out solid-liquid separation on the<br>
activated sludge with a separation membrane apparatus installed in or after the activated sludge tank,<br>
wherein prior to the inflow step, α γ value is calculated based on an index indicating the total organic<br>
content of the organic wastewater and a BOD value, an upper limit of BOD-sludge load is determined<br>
according to the γ value, and the BOD-sludge load in the activated sludge tank is adjusted so as not to<br>
exceed the upper limit;<br>
[wherein, y=BOD/(αxβ),<br>
β is one of parameters selected from the total organic carbon (TOC) [mg/L] in the organic<br>
wastewater, chemical oxygen demand using potassium dichromate (CODcr) [mg/L] and total oxygen<br>
demand (TOD) [mg/L], BOD indicates the biological oxygen demand [mg/L] in the organic<br>
wastewater,<br>
α is an adjustment coefficient based on β,<br>
α = 1.0 in the case of selecting TOC for β,<br>
α = 0.33 in the case of selecting CODCr for β, or<br>
α = 0.33 in the case of selecting TOD for β, and<br>
δ is defined as the average membrane filtration flux of the separation membrane apparatus in units of<br>
m3/(m2day)].</td>
