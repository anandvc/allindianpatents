				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a 3-d identification apparatus using a random-type recognition object and method thereof, and product authentication system and method thereof.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a random type recognition object for an identification apparatus wherein identification particles axe distributed irregularly within a 3D shape, and a positional value and a characteristic value of the identification particles distributed within the 30 shape are recognized from one or a plurality of directions by separate recognition means, a 3D identification apparatus including a random type recognition object having identification particles distributed irregularly within the 3D shape and recognition means for recognizing the positional value of the identification particles distributed in the random type recognition object from one or a plurality of directions on an orthogonal coordinate, and a 3D identification method using the same.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a product authentication system and method wherein whether a product purchased by a purchaser is genuine is determined through a network including the Internet whereby a commercial transaction order is established and the purchaser is protected from an imitation,<br><br>
Background Art<br>
In a number of social activities such as various business transactions including product guarantee and contract, an entrance and exit procedure, an access procedure on information, etc., a process for validating things, authority or a person himself or herself is very important <br>
In the past, whether a product is genuine was validated based on a label, a warranty, etc., which are attached to a product. Also, whether a person is genuine is validated based on an identification card or a seal, etc. which are held by the person. Furthermore, the entrance and exit procedure is controlled using various keys. With the development of technology, reproduction technology makes progress. Thus, there is an increasing need for recognition means whose reproduction is difficult. To keep up with this trend, a variety of recognition means such as keys having barcode, a smart code, a magnetic card or an 1C chip built therein and various technologies using human physical characteristics such as fingerprint, iris and face recognition have been developed.<br>
However, the barcode, the 1C chip, etc. are problematic in security since they can be reproduced. A recognition system using a physical characteristic such as fingerprint recognition is difficult to reproduce but has a problem in its use (the number of users, the use time, the use space) because some of the human body * is used as &amp; recognition object.<br>
In addition, a consumer purchases a product through various paths, i.e., e-commerce through the Internet, departments, shops,<br><br>
direct transaction between consumers and so on. However, there is no method for determining whether a product purchased by the consumer is genuine.  Thus, there was no choice but to determine whether the product is genuine based on information provided by a seller. Meanwhile, an imitation similar to a curio, in particular, imitations of a watch, a handbag, a golf goods, foreign liquors, etc. are in circulation in some countries in the world. Therefore, it causes damage to innocent consumers and becomes problematic in determining whether the product is genuine.<br>
In order to prevent this imitation, conventionally, whether a product is genuine is validated based on a label, a warranty, etc. that are attached to the product. However, with the advancement of technology, reproduction technology makes progress and such recognition means is also reproduced. It thus becomes more difficult to determine whether a product is genuine.<br>
In addition, as a solution for such security authentication and curio validation, there was disclosed US Patent No. 4,767,205 entitled "a combination for Security Authentication and Security Authentication Method. The US patent discloses that a combination of a size, shape or color of microbead of a micron unit is used for security authentication.<br>
In other words, information on the size, shape and color of the microbead formed randomly is compared with each other and is used for security authentication, curio validation, etc.<br>
For example, it is assumed that an original document is written. An combination is produced at a predetermined location on the original document. First authentication information on the<br><br>
size, shape and color of a microbead constituting the combination is then acquired using a microscope. If whether the document is genuine becomes problematic, the size, shape and color of the microbead constituting the combination on the document are perceived using a microscope and are then compared with the first authentication information, to determine whether the document is genuine.<br>
It can be said that this method is relatively advantageous in preventing counterfeiting as compared with a conventional label or warranty, but still has the following problems,<br>
In other words, in this method, 2D information on a plane about the size, shape and color of the microbead constituting the combination that is generated randomly is perceived by means of the microscope. It is thus possible to counterfeit the 2D information like the conventional barcode or label.<br>
It only needs more elaborate technology upon counterfeiting in that a microbead of micro unit that is invisible to the naked eye is used.<br>
Moreover, in the aforementioned US patent, the size, shape and color of the microbead constituting the combination that is randomly generated are perceived by the microscope and are then compared with the stored first authentication information. It is thus inevitable that the speed of authentication is significantly low.<br>
Furthermore, the US patent has a significant limitation to an authentication place. This is because the US Patent does not disclose separate means such as the Internet through which the<br><br>
stored first authentication information can be accessed. In the prior art, authentication is possible only at a place where the first authentication is secured and is validated.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present, invention will now be described in detail in connection with preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In a random type recognition object for an identification apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention, identification particles are irregularly distributed within a 3D shape and a positional value and a characteristic value of the identification particles distributed within the 3D shape are recognized from one or a number of directions by means of separate recognition means.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a number of identification particles 12 are irregularly distributed within a 3D shape recognition object body 11 to form a random type recognition object. In the above, the recognition object body 11 may be formed using a variety of materials such as a synthetic resin such as plastic or a glass material. The recognition object body 11 may be transparent or opaque. It is preferred that the recognition object body 11 is formed using a transparent material. The identification particles 12 inserted into the random type recognition object body 11 may be formed using the same material as the recognition object body 11 and may have a spherical shape or a regular hexahedron shape. In addition, the size of the identification particles 12 may be several micrometers (im) to several millimeters (mm). The number and size of the identification particles 12 may be dependent on accuracy and .importance required in the recognition object.<br>
Furthermore, the size and shape of the random type recognition object may be various such as a plate shape such as a credit card or a pole shape. In reality, the random type recognition object may be various such as an attachment type and an independent type even when the recognition object is usea,<br>
An exemplary process of producing the random type recognition object using a synthetic resin as the recognition object body 11 will now be described.<br>
The recognition object body 11 is first melted so that the identification particles 12 to be inserted into the recognition object body 11 can fluctuate freely. If the identification particles 12 are inserted into the recognition object body and are then well stirred/ the inserted identification particles 12 are irregularly distributed within the recognition object body 11. In this state, if the recognition object body 11 containing the identification particles 12 is solidified, the random type recognition object in which the identification particles 12 are irregularly distributed is completed.<br>
Meanwhile, it is possible that additional identification particles 12 are inserted into the recognition object body 11, the melted recognition object body 11 is stirred and bubbles generated in this process are used as the identification particles 12. That is, a synthetic resin constituting the body is solidified in a state where bubbles exist. In this case, irregularity in distribution and shape of the identification particles 12 increases to make reproduction further impossible.<br>
As shown in Fig, 2, the 3D identification apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a random type recognition object 10 having the identification particles 12 irregularly distributed within the 3D shape, and recognition means 20 for recognizing a positional value of the identification particles 12 distributed within the random type recognition object from one or a number of directions on an orthogonal coordinate.<br>
In the random type recognition object constructed above, the positional value of the identification particles 12 is perceived by the separate recognition means 20, as shown in Fig. 2. In the random type recognition object, the position of the identification particles 12 is recognized from one or a number of directions by means of the recognition means 20, There is shown in Fig. 2 that the identification particles 12 within the random type recognition<br>
object are recognized from two directions on the orthogonal coordinate to obtain a 3D positional value.<br>
There is shown in Fig. 2 that the identification particles 12 within the random type recognition object are recognized from three directions on the orthogonal coordinate to obtain a 3D positional value. Thai is, images recognized from two directions on an orthogonal coordinate are acquired using an image recognition apparatus such as a CCD camera and the acquired images of the recognition object, are combined to produce the 3D positional value of the identification particles 12,<br>
At this time, resolution of the image recognition apparatus is determined depending on the size of the identification particles 12 within the recognition object. There are two methods for recognizing images, The first method is a reflect type method in which light is illuminated by illumination means 50 in the same direction as the image recognition apparatus, as shown in Fig. 3. The second method is a passage type method in which light is illuminated by illumination means 50 in the direction opposite to the image recognition apparatus and images that pass through the recognition object are acquired, as shown in Fig, 4.<br>
Also, a laser detector may be used as the recognition means 20.<br>
To obtain the positional value of the identification particles 12 within the recognition object using the recognition means 20 is made possible by a method for obtaining a 3D positional value of each of the identification particles 12 and for using only the relative positional value in three directions<br><br>
on the orthogonal coordinate. In other words, the position of each of the identification particles 12 on a x-y plane, the position of each of the identification particles 12 on a y-z plane, and the position of each of the identification particles 12 on a z-x plane are acquired and positional values on the respective planes are combined to produce the last positional value.<br>
In this case, a process for calculating a 3D positional value of each of the identification particles 12 is omitted. Thus, a simple recognition apparatus can be used. In this case, it is safe to use the reflect type method.<br>
Moreover, in the 3D identification apparatus according to still another embodiment of the present invention, the recognition means 20 recognizes not only the positional value of the identification particles 12 but also the characteristic value of the identification particles 12. That is, not only the positional value of each of the identification particles 12 but also an eigen visual characteristic value such as color and shape of the identification particles 12 or a magnetic characteristic value such as magnetism in each of the identification particles 12, and an optical characteristic value such as reflectivity are additionally recognized. As the positional value and the characteristic value of the identification particles 12 are recognized at the same time, a more accurate identification apparatus is provided.<br>
(3) Extraction step<br>
A purchaser purchases a product, extracts and recognizes a<br><br>
characteristic value from a recognition object that is distributed together with the product using a recognition apparatus in order to determine whether the purchased product is genuine. The recognition apparatus may be installed at a place where products are sold, a special place where services for determining whether products are genuine are provided/ etc. A purchaser may have the recognition apparatus as a computer peripheral device.<br>
In this input step, it is preferred that the characteristic value held by the recognition object is extracted by recognizing the positional value and the characteristic value of the identification particles within the random type recognition object from one or a number of directions on the orthogonal coordinate. Moreover, the recognition apparatus is a 3D identification apparatus, It is preferable that the recognition apparatus includes a random type recognition object having identification particles irregularly distributed within a 3D shape, and recognition means for recognizing the positional value of the identification particles distributed in the random type recognition object from one or a number of directions on the orthogonal coordinate.<br>
(4) Step of making requests for determining whether product is genuine<br>
In order to determine whether a product to be purchased is<br>
 genuine, a purchaser transmits a data of a recognition object<br>
recognized by the recognition apparatus to the authentication<br>
system through the network including the Internet. The purchaser<br><br>
transmits the recognition object data extracted by the recognition apparatus to the data receiving part 310 through the network. In the concrete, if the purchaser recognizes a positional value and a characteristic value of identification particles distributed in a random type recognition object using the recognition apparatus and then transmits those values to the authentication system, the data receiving part 310 receives the values.<br>
(5) Step of transmitting determination results The authentication-processing unit 320 compares the data of the recognition object received from the data receiving part 310 and the data stored in the authentication database 200 to search information on the product, which is coincident with the received data of the recognition object. The data transmitting part 330 transmits the information on the product that is searched from the authentication-processing unit 320 to the product purchaser. In the concrete, the authentication-processing unit 320 compares the data of the recognition object that is received from the data receiving part with the data stored in the authentication database to extract product information coincident with the data. That is, a seller extracts the characteristic value from the recognition object and searches information on the product assigned to the recognition object. The data transmitting part 330 transmits the information to the purchaser.<br>
The product authentication system according to the present invention further includes a history management unit for having a history received from a data transmitting part stored in the<br><br>
authentication database. If it was determined whether a product was genuine in the past, it is preferred that the past history is provided to the purchaser. The history management unit has Lhe history transmitted to the purchaser by the data transmitting part 330 stored in the authentication database 200. Thus, the purchaser can receive an existing determination history in addition to the information on the purchased product.<br>
The recognition object has an index assigned thereto. Thus, in order to make requests for determining whether a product purchased by the purchaser is genuine, if a data and an index of the recognition object that are recognized by the recognition apparatuses lOOa, lOOb,...lOOn are transmitted to the authentication system through the network, the authentication-processing unit 320 of the authentication system searches a data of the recognition object that is coincident with the index received through the network and determines whether the searched data of the recognition object and the data of the recognition object received through the network are coincident with each other. The data transmitting part 330 of the authentication server transmits the results so that the processing speed and overload of the authentication-processing unit are reduced.<br>
It is preferred that the index may have characters such as barcode, RFID, an electronic chip, numbers and alphabets and may be displayed on a recognition object. In other words, a seller recognizes the characteristic value of the recognition object using the recognition apparatuses lOOa, lOOb,...lOOn, assigns information on a product and an index of the recognition object to<br><br>
the recognition object, makes data the characteristic value held by the recognition object, the information on the product assigned to the recognition object and the index of the recognition object, inputs them to the authentication system, and then stores these information in the authentication database 200.<br>
If the purchaser transmits the data of the recognition object recognized by the recognition apparatuses lOOa, lOOb,...lOOn and the index of the recognition object to the authentication system through the network in order to determine whether the purchased product is genuine, the data receiving part 310 of the authentication system receives those data. The authentication-processing unit 320 searches a data of the recognition object that is coincident with the index transmitted through the network,' determines whether the searched data of the recognition object and the data of the recognition object received through the network are coincident with each other. The data transmitting part 330 transmits the determination result to the purchaser.<br>
If whether a product is genuine is performed at the request of a purchaser, there may be further included a settlement process in which payment through a credit card is made in order to pay the price of the authentication system.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, a 3D identification apparatus and identification method using the same according to embodiments of the present invention have the following effects.<br><br>
Firstly, it is possible to exactly validate identity of a user and to determine whether a product is genuine.<br>
Secondly, reproduction of a recognition object is impossible. It is thus possible to construct more complete security equipment and validation system.<br>
Lastly, according to a product authentication system and method, it is possible to easily determine whether a product is genuine through a network, The recognition object can be easily fabricated and cannot be reproduced. It is thus possible to protect a consumer from an imitation and to establish a business transaction order.<br><br><br><br>

purchaser is genuine, the authentication server(300) compares the data<br>
of  the  recognition   object  with   the   data   stored   in   the   authentication<br>
database(200)  and  then transmits  information on a product coincident<br>
with the data of the recognition object,<br>
wherein the  recognition apparatus(100a  ,,,100n)  is a  3D  identification<br>
apparatus and comprises:<br>
a   random   type   recognition   object(10)   having   identification   particles<br>
(12)irregularly distributed within a 3D(11) shape; and<br>
recognition    means(20)    for   recognizing    a    positional    value    of   the<br>
identification  particles(12)  distributed  in  the  random  type  recognition<br>
object(lO)   from   one   or   a   plurality   of   directions   on   an   orthogonal<br>
coordinate.<br>
7. The product authentication system as claimed in claim 6, wherein the<br>
authentication server(300) comprises:<br>
a data  receiving part(310)  that receives  the  data  of the  recognition<br>
object recognized by the recognition apparatus(100a ,,,100n), from the<br>
purchaser;<br>
an  authentication-processing  unit(320)  that  compares  the  data  of the<br>
recognition object received from the data receiving part(310) with the<br>
data stored in the authentication database(200) to search information on<br>
a product coincident with the data of the recognition object; and<br>
a   data   transmitting   part(330)   that   transmits   the   information   on   the<br>
product searched by the authentication-processing unit to the purchaser.<br>
8. The product authentication system as claimed in claim 7, wherein a history management unit(340) is provided which has a history received from the data transmitting part(330) stored in the authentication database(200).<br>
9. A product authentication method using a random type recognition object (10), wherein a purchaser determines whether a purchased product is genuine through a network using an authentication system connected to the purchaser, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) generating the recognition object distributed together with the product so that the recognition object has a characteristic value;<br><br>
 (b)	allowing a seller to recognize the characteristic value of the<br>
recognition object using a recognition apparatus, assign information on<br>
the product to the recognition object, store the characteristic value held<br>
by the recognition object and the information on the product assigned to<br>
the recognition object and then input those information to the<br>
authentication system;<br>
(c)	allowing the purchaser to recognize the characteristic value from the recognition object distributed together with the product using the recognition apparatus in order to determine whether the purchased product is genuine;<br>
(d)	allowing the purchaser to transmit a data of the recognition object recognized by the recognition apparatus to the authentication system through the network in order to make requests for determining whether the product is genuine; and<br>
(e)	allowing the authentication system to compare the data of the<br>
recognition object received through the network with the stored data to<br>
search information on the product coincident with the data of the<br>
recognition object and then transmit the information on the product,<br>
wherein the step (a) comprises generating a random type recognition<br>
object(lO) in which identification particles(12) are irregularly distributed<br>
within a 3D shaped 1), and a positional value and a characteristic value<br>
of the identification particles(12) distributed within the 3D shape(ll) are<br>
recognized from one or a plurality of directions by means of the<br>
recognition apparatus(100a ,„100n),<br>
wherein the step (b) comprises recognizing a positional value and a characteristic value of identification particles(12) within the random type recognition object(lO) produced in the step (a) from one or a plurality of directions on an orthogonal coordinate.<br>
10.	The product authentication method as claimed in claim 9, comprising the step of storing the transmitted history in the authentication system.<br>
11.	The product authentication method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the recognition object has an index assigned thereto, and<br>
if the purchaser transmits the data of the recognition object recognized by   the   recognition    apparatus(100a    ,,,100n)    and   its   index   to   the<br><br>
authentication system through the network in order to make requests for determining whether the purchased product is genuine, the authentication system searches data of the recognition object that is coincident with the index received through the network to determine whether the searched data of the recognition object and the data of the recognition object received through the network are coincident with each other and then transmits the determination result.<br>
12. The product authentication method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the step (c) comprises recognizing a positional value and a characteristic value of identification particles(12) within the random type recognition object(l0) produced in the step (a) from one or a plurality of directions on an orthogonal coordinate.<br></td>
