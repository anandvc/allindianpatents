AUTOMATIC BRAKING SYSTEM<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a braking system, and more<br>
particularly to a braking system and method used with an automatic transmission<br>
in a motor vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Braking a motor vehicle, whether a passenger vehicle or<br>
commercial truck, involves an operator of the vehicle manually engaging a<br>
primary brake. Engagement of the primary brake typically involves increasing<br>
the friction between the brake element and the axle of the vehicle, though other<br>
types of braking are known in the art. While this method of braking is well known<br>
and useful for its intended purpose, relying solely on a manually operated brake<br>
while on a steep road grade can increase the wear on the brake which can<br>
reduce the useful life of the brake. For example, increased wear can lead to an<br>
increased rate of the reduction of the brake lining, increased rotor temperature,<br>
and increased brake fade.<br>
[0004] One solution to avoid excessive wear on the primary brake<br>
while on steep road grades is to apply extra braking. The extra braking can<br>
include various forms of braking, including downshifting of the transmission in the<br>
1<br><br>
GP-309166<br>
motor vehicle, activation of engine compression brakes, or activation of an<br>
exhaust brake. While useful for reducing wear on the primary brake, in the past<br>
this extra braking was manually engaged by the operator of the motor vehicle,<br>
thereby increasing the complexity of operating the vehicle.<br>
[0005] One solution to the above problem is to automatically activate<br>
downshifting, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,212,458 B1, hereby incorporated<br>
by reference as if fully disclosed herein. While automatic downshifting is useful<br>
for its intended purpose, there is room in the art for improvement in providing<br>
additional mechanical automatic extra braking to a motor vehicle.<br>

based on the primary brake is activated, throttle activation, the road grade, the<br>
acceleration, and the speed.<br>
[0013] It is another object of the present invention to provide the art<br>
with a method for automatically providing extra braking to a motor vehicle.<br>
[0014] In one aspect of the present invention, a method for braking a<br>
vehicle having a throttle, a primary brake and an auxiliary brake is provided, the<br>

[0015] In another aspect of the present invention, determining whether<br>
extra braking is desirable further comprises determining whether the road grade<br>

extra braking is desirable includes combining the road grade, the speed of the<br>
vehicle, the amount of engagement of the throttle, the first time, the second time,<br>
and the third time into a combined factor.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0025] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0026] Figure 1 illustrates a braking system 10 in accordance with the<br>
principles of the present invention. The braking system 10 may be incorporated<br>
within a motor vehicle (not particularly shown). The braking system 10 includes<br>
5<br><br>
GP-309166<br>
an automatic transmission 12. The automatic transmission 12 may be any one of<br>
a set of well known automatic transmissions known in the art and having a<br>
plurality of gear sets for establishing a plurality of forward and reverse gear ratios<br>
(not shown).<br>
[0027] The automatic transmission 12 includes a controller 14 in<br>
electronic communication with a shift actuator 16 and a gear selector 18. The<br>
controller 14 is an electronic device having a preprogrammed digital computer or<br>
processor, control logic, memory used to store data, and at least one I/O section.<br>
The control logic includes a plurality of logic routines for monitoring,<br>
manipulating, and generating data. The shift actuator 16 is coupled to the<br>
plurality of gear sets within the automatic transmission 12 and is operable to<br>
change the gear ratio. The gear selector 18 is selectively actuated by an<br>
operator of the motor vehicle to select one of the plurality of forward or reverse<br>
gear ratios. During operation, an operator manually operates the gear selector<br>
18 to select different gear ratios, for example, a park, reverse, neutral, or forward<br>
gear ratio. This selection is communicated to the controller 14 and the controller<br>
14 then activates the shift actuator 16 to change the gear ratio of the automatic<br>
transmission 12.<br>
[0028] The brake system 10 further includes a plurality of sensors 20<br>
coupled to the motor vehicle. The sensors 20 are in electronic communication<br>
with the processor of the controller 14. The sensors 20 collect data regarding the<br>
operating parameters of the motor vehicle and generate output signals indicative<br>
of the vehicle operating parameters. These output signals are electronically<br>
6<br><br>
GP-309166<br>
communicated to the controller 14. The controller 14 then continuously or<br>
periodically monitors the output signals. The output signals include information<br>
regarding a speed of the vehicle and an acceleration of the vehicle. The output<br>
signals may include other kinds of data, for example, battery voltage, engine<br>
temperature, or oil pressure.<br>
[0029] The brake system 10 includes a primary brake 22 and an<br>
auxiliary brake 24. The primary brake 22 is used to reduce the speed of the<br>
vehicle and is preferably an operator actuated friction brake, though other brakes<br>
known in the art may be used. The primary brake 22 is in electronic<br>
communication with the controller 14 such that the controller 14 receives an<br>
output signal from the primary brake 22 indicating when the primary brake is<br>
engaged. The auxiliary brake 24 is a device used to reduce the speed of the<br>
vehicle and may include an exhaust brake, an exhaust compression brake, a<br>
variable nozzle turbocharger, a variable geometry turbocharger, an input<br>
retarder, an output retarder, or an electric motor.<br>
[0030] The auxiliary brake 24 is in electronic communication with the<br>
controller 14. When extra braking is desired, the controller 14 sends a control<br>
signal to the auxiliary brake 24 and the auxiliary brake 24 is activated or<br>
engaged.<br>
[0031] The brake system 10 includes a throttle 26 in electronic<br>
communication with the controller 14. The throttle 26 is coupled to an engine<br>
(not shown) in the motor vehicle. The throttle 26 preferably includes a pedal (not<br>
shown) and the operator may engage the throttle 26 by depressing the pedal<br>
7<br><br>
GP-309166<br>
when the operator desires to accelerate the motor vehicle. One of the plurality of<br>
sensors 20 then sends an output signal to the controller 14 indicating a position<br>
of the throttle 26. Alternatively, the throttle 26 sends an electronic output signal<br>
to the controller 14 indicating a position of the throttle 26.<br>
[0032] Turning now to Figure 2, a method for braking 100 employing<br>
the braking system 10 is illustrated in flowchart form. The method for braking<br>
100 begins at step 102 where the controller 14 monitors the output signals from<br>
the plurality of sensors 20. The output signals include data such as vehicle<br>
acceleration, the position of the throttle 26, and vehicle speed.<br>
[0033] A road grade is then calculated at step 104 by the controller 14.<br>
Various methods for calculating the road grade may be employed. In the present<br>
invention, the road grade is calculated as a percent grade using the following<br>
formula:<br><br>
[0034] wherein FTractiveEffort is the tractive effort of the motor vehicle, mveh<br>
is the mass of the vehicle aveh is the vehicle acceleration, Faero is an aerodynamic<br>
force, and FRollingResistance is the force of rolling resistance of the motor vehicle, and<br>
g is the constant acceleration due to gravity. FTractiveEffort is calculated using the<br>
following formula:<br><br>
wherein CTR is the converter torque ratio, MEngine is the engine torque, lEngine is<br>
the engine inertia, ωEngine is the engine acceleration, MAuxBrake is the auxiliary<br>
8<br><br>
GP-309166<br>
braking torque, KTransGearRatio is a pre-set automatic transmission gear ratio factor,<br>
KTire is a pre-set tire factor, and KAxle is a pre-set axle factor, and FPrimaryBrake is the<br>
force of the primary brake 22. FPrimaryBrake is preferably zero as the road grade is<br>
preferably calculated when the primary brake 22 is not activated. Faero is<br>
calculated using the following formula:<br><br>
[0035] wherein vveh is the vehicle speed and KDragCoeff is a pre-set drag<br>
coefficient for the motor vehicle. FRollingResistance is calculated using the following<br>
formula:<br><br>
[0036] wherein KRollingRes is a pre-set rolling resistance factor for the<br>
motor vehicle.<br>
[0037] At step 106, the controller 14 compares the road grade<br>
calculated at step 104 to a road grade threshold. The road grade threshold is a<br>
value set to indicate whether the road grade is steep. If the road grade is not<br>
steep, the method 100 proceeds back to step 102 and the controller 14 continues<br>
to monitor the output signals from the plurality of sensors 20. If the road grade<br>
calculated at step 104 exceeds the road grade threshold, the method 100<br>
proceeds to step 108.<br>
[0038] At step 108, the controller 14 determines whether the vehicle is<br>
accelerating. Acceleration of the vehicle can be determined from the output<br>
signals from the plurality of sensors 20 or alternatively by calculation using a<br>
derivative of a transmission output speed multiplied by tire and axle factors. If<br>
9<br><br>
GP-309166<br>
the vehicle is not accelerating, the method 100 proceeds back to step 102 and<br>
the controller 14 continues to monitor the output signals from the plurality of<br>
sensors 20. If the vehicle is accelerating, the method 100 proceeds to step 110.<br>
[0039] At step 110, the controller 14 determines whether the primary<br>
brake 22 has been activated by the operator of the motor vehicle. If the primary<br>
brake 22 has not been activated, this indicates that the operator does not desire<br>
to slow the vehicle, and the method 100 proceeds back to step 102 where the<br>
controller 14 continues to monitor the output signals from the plurality of sensors<br>
20. If the primary brake 22 has been activated, this indicates that the operator is<br>
attempting to slow the vehicle, and the method 100 proceeds to step 112.<br>
[0040] At step 112 the controller 14 determines the desire for extra<br>
braking. As will be described in further detail below, determining the desire for<br>
extra braking involves analyzing and manipulating the data from the plurality of<br>
sensors 20 to determine the type or method of extra braking desired.<br>
[0041] Once it has been determined the type or method of extra<br>
braking desired, the extra braking is activated at step 114. The controller 14<br>
sends a signal to activate the auxiliary brake 24, the shift actuator 16, or both.<br>
The controller 14 will preferably activate the auxiliary brake 24 before activating<br>
the shift actuator 16.<br>
[0042] At step 116 the controller 14 determines whether the throttle 26<br>
has been engaged. If the throttle 26 has not been engaged, the method 100<br>
continues to monitor the output signals from the plurality of sensors 20. If the<br>
throttle 26 has been engaged, this indicates that the operator no longer wishes to<br>
10<br><br>
GP-309166<br>
brake, and the extra braking is deactivated at step 118. The method 100 then<br>
continues to monitor the output signals from the plurality of sensors 20 at step<br>
102.<br>
[0043] Turning now to Figure 3, a flowchart illustrating a method for<br>
determining the desire for extra braking at step 112 is provided. Step 112 begins<br>
by recording a plurality of times. First, at step 120, the controller 14 records an<br>
amount of time that the acceleration of the vehicle (a first recorded amount of<br>
time) is greater than a threshold compensated by an acceleration magnitude.<br>
The threshold is a predetermined calibrated value correlating to vehicle<br>
acceleration. Preferably, the controller 14 includes in memory a lookup table<br>
that includes the threshold values indexed by the vehicle acceleration magnitude.<br>
Accordingly, the threshold is determined by selecting the threshold from the<br>
lookup table correlating to the vehicle acceleration magnitude. At step 122 the<br>
controller 14 records a second amount of time that the acceleration of the vehicle<br>
(a second recorded amount of time) is greater than a second threshold with the<br>
auxiliary brake 24 activated, compensated by the acceleration magnitude. The<br>
second threshold is determined in a manner similar to the threshold in step 120.<br>
At step 124 the controller 14 records a third amount of time that the acceleration<br>
of the vehicle (a third recorded amount of time) is less than a third threshold. At<br>
step 126 the controller 14 records a fourth amount of time that the acceleration of<br>
the vehicle (a fourth recorded amount of time) is less than a fourth threshold with<br>
the auxiliary brake 24 activated. The third and fourth thresholds are pre-<br>
determined to help calibrate the desire for extra braking. At step 128 the<br>
11<br><br>
GP-309166<br>
downshift), or whether to activate both the auxiliary brake 22 and the shift<br>
actuator 16. In the preferred embodiment, when the combined factor is greater<br>
than the auxiliary brake threshold, the controller 14 determines that it is desirable<br>
to activate the auxiliary brake 24. If the combined factor is greater than the<br>
downshift threshold, the controller 14 determines that it is desirable to activate<br>
the shift actuator 16 to downshift the automatic transmission 12. Alternatively,<br>
when the downshift threshold is calibrated to be greater than the auxiliary brake<br>
threshold and the combined factor is greater than the downshift threshold, the<br>
controller 14 determines that it is desirable to activate both the auxiliary brake 24<br>
and the shift actuator 16 to downshift the automatic transmission 12. Once the<br>
controller 14 determines the desire for extra braking at step 112, the method 100<br>
continues to step 114 (Figure 2) and activates the extra braking.<br>
[0047] Using the braking system 10 and braking method 100 of the<br>
present invention, extra braking can be activated automatically based on various<br>
factors and operating parameters of the vehicle. Moreover, the present invention<br>
allows various kinds and combinations of extra braking to be automatically<br>
employed to more efficiently brake the vehicle. Thus, the present braking system<br>
and method thereby allows the operator of the motor vehicle to focus on<br>
operating the vehicle rather than manually activating extra braking.<br>
[0048] While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been<br>
described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will<br>
recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the<br>
invention within the scope of the appended claims.<br>

13.	The system of claim 12, wherein the control logic includes a tenth<br>
control logic for combining the road grade, the throttle position, the speed, the<br>
first time, the second time, the third time, the fourth time, and the fifth time into a<br>
combined value, and the combined value is used to determine whether to<br>
activate one of the auxiliary brake and the actuator.<br>
16<br><br>
GP-309166<br>
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the combined value determines<br>
whether the auxiliary brake is activated, whether the actuator is activated, or<br>
whether both the auxiliary brake and the actuator are activated together.<br>
17<br><br>
GP-309166<br>
15.	A method for braking a vehicle having a throttle, a primary brake and<br>
an auxiliary brake, the method comprising the following steps:<br>
determining a road grade;<br>
determining an acceleration of the vehicle;<br>
determining an activation status of the primary brake;<br>
determining a position of the throttle;<br>
determining whether extra braking is desirable based on the road grade,<br>
the acceleration of the vehicle, the activation status of the primary brake, and the<br>
position of the throttle; and<br>
activating the auxiliary brake based on the extra braking determination.<br>
16.	The method of claim 15, wherein determining whether extra braking is<br>
desirable further comprises determining whether the road grade exceeds a road<br>
grade threshold, whether the vehicle is accelerating, whether the primary brake is<br>
activated, and the position of the throttle.<br>
17.	The method of claim 16 further comprising determining a first amount<br>
of time the vehicle acceleration is different than a first threshold, a second<br>
amount of time the vehicle acceleration is different than a second threshold with<br>
the auxiliary brake activated, and a third amount of time the primary brake is<br>
activated.<br>
18<br><br>
GP-309166<br>
18.	The method of claim 17 wherein determining whether extra braking is<br>
desirable includes combining the road grade, the speed of the vehicle, the<br>
position of the throttle, the first time, the second time, and the third time into a<br>
combined factor.<br>
19.	The method for braking of claim 18, wherein the combined factor is<br>
compared to an auxiliary brake threshold and the auxiliary brake is activated if<br>
the combined factor is greater than the auxiliary brake threshold.<br>
20.	The method for braking of claim 19, wherein the vehicle includes an<br>
automatic transmission with a plurality of drive ratios, and determining whether<br>
extra braking is desirable includes comparing the combined factor to a downshift<br>
threshold and the drive ratio is changed when the combined factor is greater than<br>
the downshift threshold.<br>
Dated this 1st day of NOVEMBER 2007<br><br>
A system for braking a vehicle includes a transmission having a plurality of gear<br>
sets for establishing a plurality of forward and reverse gear ratios and an actuator<br>
for changing the gear ratios. The system also includes a plurality of sensors for<br>
detecting a plurality of vehicle operating parameters and an auxiliary brake for<br>
reducing a speed of the vehicle. A controller having a processor configured to<br>
receive a plurality of output signals from the plurality of sensors has control logic<br>
for activating one of the actuator and the auxiliary brake based on the received<br>
output signals. A method for operating the system for braking is also provided.<br>
The method includes determining road grade, determining an acceleration of the<br>
vehicle, determining an activation status of the primary brake, determining a<br>
position of the throttle, determining whether extra braking is and activating the<br>
auxiliary brake based on the extra braking determination.<br><br></td>
