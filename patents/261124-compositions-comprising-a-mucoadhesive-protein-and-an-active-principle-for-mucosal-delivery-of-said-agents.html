				<td>COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING A MUCOADHESIVE PROTEIN AND AN ACTIVE PRINCIPLE FOR MUCOSAL DELIVERY OF SAID AGENT  <br>
                   Priority is claimed herein to U.S. provisional patent application no. 60/580,877, entitled "COMPOSITIONS FOR MUCOSAL DELIVERY OF AGENTS" to Bromley et al, filed June 17, 2004. This application is related to U.S. Application Serial No. (attorney docket no. 17357-002001/5702), filed on the same day herewith, entitled "COMPOSITIONS FOR MUCOSAL DELIVERY OF AGENTS.<br>
Where permitted, the subject matter of each of these applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD<br>
Provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions for delivery of agents. Compositions formulated as emulsions for mucosal delivery are provided. BACKGROUND<br>
Numerous pharmaceutical substances are available for administration to animals, including humans, for a variety of purposes. These substances include, for example, therapeutic agents, such as drugs; dietary supplements, such as vitamins; prophylactic agents, such as antigens for use in vaccines; and diagnostic agents, such as labeled imaging agents. Administration of these substances can be via a number of routes including intramuscular, subcutaneous and oral administration. Intramuscular or subcutaneous, administration of the substance suffers from disadvantages: relatively specialized skills are required to administer the pharmaceutical; large scale administration can be difficult to perform; it is expensive; and a number of side reactions can occur to the substance administered. Many antibiotics (i.e., tetracycline and penicillin ), and hormones (I.e., progesterone and estrogen) can be administered successfully via the oral route.<br>
There are, however, biologically active agents, for example certain dietary supplements, drugs, hormones and immunogens, whose efficacy is almost totally lost upon oral administration. Included among those agents that<br>
cannot be effectively orally administered are polypeptide agents, such as Calcitonin, Erythropoetin, Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor, Stem Cell Factor, Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor, LHRH analogues, Somatostatin, Insulin, Interferons, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitors and species of DNA and RNA. Oral delivery of certain protein and polypeptide drugs is complicated by the presence of proteolytic digestive enzymes in the stomach and intestines. Unprotected proteins, which are administered orally are largely degraded by such enzymes before they are able to pass through the enteric wall and enter blood circulation. To some extent this effect can be overcome by the administration of extremely large doses of the pharmaceutical agent. This approach, however, is not economically feasible for many pharmaceutical agents and may result in undesired side effects.<br>
Thus, there continues to be a need for development compositions and methods for convenient delivery of such substances to animals, including humans, efficiently. Accordingly, among the objects herein, it is an object to provide compositions and methods for convenient delivery of agents to be delivered to a subject. SUMMARY<br>
Provided herein are compositions and methods for formulation of the compositions for mucosal delivery and administration of agents to animals, including humans.  Provided are compositions and methods for administering substances to animals, including humans, employing a carrier that facilitates entry of the substance to the mucosa in a non-specific manner.<br>
The compositions provided herein are stable emulsions of oil in water or water in oil, wherein an agent to be delivered is dissolved in either the oil phase or the water phase. The emulsions are typically stabilized by surface active molecules in the emulsion. The surfactant molecules form various macro-molecular structures in an emulsion, such as micelles, inverse micelles, lipid bilayers (liposomes) and cubosomes. The exact macromolecular structure formed depends on the relative sizes of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the surface active molecule. The<br>
agent to be delivered can be distributed between the hydrophobia and hydrophilic phases of an oil in water or water in oil type emulsion, or can be present predominantly in one of the phases. In certain embodiments, the active agent in the emulsion is encapsulated in a delivery vehicle such as a micelle, a liposome or a cubosome or a mixture thereof.<br>
The compositions provided have a mucoadhesive property whereby the composition, when administered either orally or nasally, adheres to and/or anchors to a subject's mucous membrane for a period of time sufficient to quantitatively deliver the agent to be delivered to the subject. The compositions contain a mucoadhesive substance that imparts the composition a property of adhering or anchoring to a mucosal membrane thereby effecting absorption of the agent through the mucosal membrane. Typically, the mucoadhesive protein is present in an amount sufficient to confer mucoadhesive property to the composition. Such mucosal absorption allows entry of the agent being delivered into the systemic circulation without first passing through the liver, and thus alleviates the loss of activity upon passage through the liver.<br>
The mucoadhesive substances for use herein include, but are not limited to natural or synthetic proteins, polypeptides or fragments thereof that have the property of adhering or penetrating into a mucus membrane for a period of time sufficient to achieve quantitative delivery of an agent to be delivered. In certain embodiments, the compositions are designed for mucosal delivery of a therapeutically-effective amount of a biologically active agent to the subject. The mucoadhesive protein is generally dissolved in the water phase. In certain embodiments the mucoadhesive protein can be dissolved in the oil phase. The mucoadhesive protein is typically anchored to polar head groups of the delivery vehicles in the emulsion.<br>
In certain embodiments, the compositions provided herein is formulated to contact the mucosal membrane from about 5-24 hours or even longer, in some embodiments about 5,10,12,14,16,18, 20, 22 or up to 24 hours. In some embodiments, the compositions provided herein is formulated<br>

In other embodiments, the compositions provided herein are formulated to adhere and penetrate into the mucosal membrane from about 5-24 hours or even longer, in some embodiments, for about 5, 10,12,14,16,18,20,22 or up to 24 hours. In some embodiments, the compositions provided herein are formulated to adhere and penetrate into the mucosal membrane from about 1 minute up to about 180, 120, 100, 60, 40, 30, 20, 10,5,4,3, 2 minutes. In certain embodiments, the compositions provided herein are formulated to adhere to the mucosal membrane from about 5-24 hours or even longer, in some embodiments for about 5, 10, 12,14,16,18, 20, and 22 or up to 24 hours. In some embodiments, the compositions provided herein are formulated to adhere to the mucosal membrane from about 1 minute up to about 180,120, 100, 60, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 minutes. In certain embodiments, the compositions provided herein are formulated to penetrate into the mucosal membrane from about 5-24 hours or even longer, In some embodiments for about 5, 10, 12,14,16,18, 20, and 22 or up to 24 hours.

Compositions provided herein can have a wide range of viscosities, typically in a range that assists retension of the composition on a mucosal surface. Generally, the viscosity ranges from an oil like viscosity, honey like viscosity, ketchup like viscosity, chocolate syrup like viscosity to peanut butter like or butter like viscosity. The viscosity of the compositions can be<br>
measured by methods known to those of skill in the art, including measurement by using a viscometer such as Brookfield LVDV-I+ viscometer and T spindles with a heliopath adapter.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 indicates variance in blood glucose levels in a human after administration of a composition provided herein for 3 consecutive days. DETAILED DESCRIPTION A.       Definitions<br>
Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which the invention(s) belong. All patents, patent applications, published<br>
can result in adhesion and/or penetration of the composition into the mucosal surface. The compositions provided herein can contact the mucosal surface from 30 seconds up to about 24 hours. In certain embodiments, the composition contacts the mucosal surface for about 5, 10, 12,14,16,18, 20, and 22 or up to 24 hours. In some embodiments, the compositions provided herein contact the mucosal membrane from about 1 minute up to about 180, 120,100, 60, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5,4, 3, 2 minutes.<br>
As used herein, mucoadhesive property refers to a property whereby a natural or synthetic substance, such as a protein, when applied to a mucosal epithelium adheres to or penetrates a subject's mucous membrane for a period of time sufficient to quantitatively deliver a composition provided herein to the subject. The composition can anchor in and/or penetrate into a mucosal surface. Adhesion of mucoadhesives to a mucous membrane occurs generally, although not necessarily or exclusively, via secondary chemical bonds, such as hydrogen bonding and Van der Waal forces (Tabor et al., 1977 J. Colloid Interface Sci. 58:2 and Good 1977 J. Colloid Interface Sci. 59:398). Parameters, such as mechanical binding to mucous membrane per se or the degree of biological effect of an agent delivered can be used as a measurement parameter to detect and quantitate mucoadhesion.<br>
As used herein, mucoadhesive compositions are viscous aqueous solutions. Their mucoadhesive (or penetrative) properties can be assessed by comparison to a control composition that does not contain the mucoadhesive protein(s) added to the mucoadhesvie composition. At similar viscosities, the emulsion prepared with a mucoadhesive protein or protein binds to a mucosal surface more strongly (i.e. more is bound or penetrates or is delivered) compared to a control emulsion without the mucoadhesive protein or protein(s).   Such increase in delivery or binding or penetration is at least about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 100% greater mucosal binding than a control emulsion.<br>
As used herein, mucoadhesive proteins refer to any natural or synthetic proteins, polypeptides or fragments thereof that possess the mucoadhesive<br>
property. Non-limiting examples of mucoadhesive proteins include mucin proteins and transferrins. In certain embodiments, the protein for use in the compositions and methods provided herein is lactofemn. In certain embodiments, the mucoadhesive protein present in a composition provided herein is in an amount sufficient to confer a mucoadhesive property to the composition.<br>
As used herein, "biologically compatible substance" refers to a substance which when administered to a subject, such as a human, does not produce undesired or toxic effects.<br>
As used herein, "an agent," is any substance that can be delivered via compositions provided herein to a mucosal surface of a subject.<br>
As used herein, "a biologically active agent," "a biological agent," or "an agent," is any substance which when introduced into the body causes a desired biological response, such as altering body function at the cellular, tissue or organ level and/or altering cosmetic appearance. Such substance can be any synthetic or natural element or compound, protein, cell, or tissue including a pharmaceutical, drug, therapeutic, nutritional supplement, herb, hormone, or the like, or any combinations thereof. The terms also encompass pharmaceutically acceptable, pharmacologically active derivatives of those active agents specifically mentioned herein, including, but not limited to, salts, esters, amides, prodrugs, active metabolites, isomers, fragments, analogs, and the like. When the terms "biologically active agent," "biological agent" and "agent" are used, then, or when a particular active agent is specifically identified, it is intended to include the active agent per se as well as pharmaceutically acceptable, pharmacologically active salts, esters, amides, prodrugs, active metabolites, isomers, fragments and analogs.<br>
As used herein, a subject is defined as an animal, including a mammal, typically a human.<br>
As used herein, quantitative delivery refers to delivery of a substantial portion of the amount administered, and is typically, greater than 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%.<br>
As used herein, therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount of the active agent for a desired therapeutic, prophylactic, or other biological effect or response when a composition is administered to a subject in a single dosage form. The particular amount of active agent in a dosage will vary widely according to conditions such as the nature of the active agent, the nature of the condition being treated, the age and size of the subject.<br>
As used herein, an emulsion is defined as a colloidal dispersion of two immiscible liquids, such as oil and water, in the form of droplets. The emulsions are generally stabilized by an interfacial film of surface active agents or surfactant molecules, such as pdysorbate -80 and stability of an emulsion can be determined by well known routine methods.<br>
As used herein, surfactants (or "surface-active agents") are chemical or naturally occurring entities which, when dissolved in an aqueous solution, reduce the surface tension of the solution or the interfacial tension between the aqueous phase and the oil phase, to form a stable oil in water or water in oil emulsion. The surfactant molecules are amphiphilic and contain hydrophilic head groups and hydrophobic tails. The surfactant molecules form various macro-molecular structure in an emulsion, such as micelles, inverse micelles, lipid bilayers (liposomes) and cubosomes. The exact macromolecular structure which is formed depends on the relative sizes of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the surface active molecule.<br>
Micelle formation is favored when the cross sectional area of the hydrophilic region of the surface active molecule is greater than that of the hydrophobic part of the molecule. For example, sodium palmitate contains a hydrocarbon chain (the hydrophobic portion of the molecule) and an ionic base (the hydrophilic portion of the molecule), and act as emulsifying agent to bind water and oil phases. That is, it allows oil and water to be broken into tiny droplets suspended or dispersed in water as spherical micelle, wherein the<br>
hydrophilic arrange at the periphery of the sphere and hydrophobia tails are at the center.<br>
When the cross sectional area of the hydrophobic region of the molecule is greater than that of the hydrophilic part of the molecule, the formation of hexagonal phase structures, sometimes referred to as an inverse micelle is favored, e.g., dimyristoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE).<br>
For surface active molecules in which the cross sectional area of the hydrophilic region of the molecule is slightly less than, or equal to, that of the hydrophobic part of the molecule, such as many phospholipids (which are amphipathic type of lipids that contain phosphate, that is, molecules containing one phosphate, a glycerol and one or more fatty acids), the formation of biiayers is favored, e.g., dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). These biiayers are two dimensional sheets in which all of the hydrophobic portions, e.g., acyl side chains, are shielded from interaction with water except those at the ends of the sheet. An energetically unfavorable interaction of the acyl chains with water results in the folding of the biiayers to form three-dimensional, vesicles. These vesicles are referred to as "liposomes." Liposomes may be formed as a single bilayer enclosing a single aqueous space (small unilamellar vesicles; SUVS) or may be composed of concentric biiayers with many aqueous spaces alternating with the biiayers (multilamellar vesicles: MLVS). Liposomes can be used to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic active agents. Hydrophobic active agents are typically partitioned within the biiayers whereas hydrophific active agents are typically trapped within the aqueous compartments. The advantages of using liposomes as a carrier/encapsulation system is that they are stable and can protect the active agents from degradation, e.g., by oxygen, digestive enzymes, etc.<br>
As used herein, a "delivery vehicle" refers to macro-molecular structures in an emulsion, such as micelles, inverse micelles, lipid biiayers (liposomes) and cubosomes or a mixture thereof.<br><br>
As used herein, "protein is associated with a delivery vehicle" means the mucoadhesive protein is associated with a delivery vehicle via chemical or physical interaction, such as hydrogen bond or van der waal's forces. The mucoadhesive protein, such as lactoferrin can be for example, associated with the polar head groups of the delivery vehicles, such as micelles via a chemical interaction, such as a hydrogen bond.<br>
As used herein, "agent is associated with a delivery vehicle" means the delivery vehicle contains the agent to be delivered. The agent can be for example, encapsulated in a micelle or encapsulated in the liposome bilayers.<br>
As used herein, viscosity refers to a physical property of fluids that determines the internal resistance to shear forces and is expressed in centipoise (cp).<br>
The oil phase in the emulsion provided herein can contain any nontoxic oil, biocompatibte oil, which includes, but is not limited to mono-, di- and triglycerides, fatty acids and their esters, ethers and esters of propylene glycol or other polyols. The fatty acids and esters (used as such or where they form part of a glyceride) can be short chain, medium chain or long chain. As used herein, medium chain represents a hydrocarbon chain of C8 to C12 and short chain is a hydrocarbon chain of less than C8 and long chain means a hydrocarbon chain of more than C12. The water phase in the emulsion can be water, aqueous solutions, alcohols, alcohol solutions, and the like.<br>
As used herein, the stability of a composition provided herein refers to the length of time at a given temperature that greater than 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the initial amount of the agent to be delivered, e.g., insulin, is present in the composition. Thus, for example, a composition that is stable for 30 days at 25 °C would have greater than 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90% 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the initial amount of active ingredient present in the composition at 30 days following storage at 25 °C.<br>
As used herein, pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of a compound include salts, esters, enol ethers, enol esters, acids, bases, solvates, hydrates or prodrugs thereof. Such derivatives can be readily prepared by those of skill in this art using known methods for such derivatization. The compounds produced can be administered to animals or .humans without substantial toxic effects and either are pharmaceutically active or are prodrugs.

B.       Compositions<br>
1. Mucosal delivery<br>
Provided herein are compositions and methods for mucosai delivery of agents, particularly agents that are normally difficult to administer or ineffective when administered orally or nasally. The compositions provided herein contain one or more mucoadhesive proteins that impart a mucoadhesive property to the composition. Contacting a mucosai surface in a subject with a composition results in delivery of composition, including active and inactive components into circulation.  The compositions provided herein are for delivery of agents, such as biologically active agents, through mucosa, such as oral, nasal or intestinal mucosa.<br>
Mucosai delivery systems offer benefits over other methods of delivery. For example, absorption through the mucous membrane leads the delivered active agent directly into the circulatory system. This allows such agents, in certain embodiments, to bypass the gastrointestinal tract as well as first pass liver metabolism. Secondly, the biologically active agents such as drugs directly enter the circulatory system, which allows the therapeutic to be rapidly transported to the site of need. The faster the drug reaches its target area, the faster it can begin to elicit its desired effect. Further, the avoidance of the gastrointestinal tract and first pass metabolism means that much less of the drug can be administered to achieve the same effect, allowing for lower dosages to be administered and fewer side effects.<br>
Some common modes of mucosai administration include oral and nasal administrations. Those of skill in the art are familiar with a variety of modes of administration (see, e.g., Almeida et a/. Journal of Drug Targeting 3, 456-467 (1996), which provides a review of mucosai administration of vaccines in general, and nasal administration of vaccines in particular). The compositions upon contacting with the mucosai surface adhere thereto or penetrate through the mucosai surface, for an amount of time sufficient to achieve quantitative delivery of the composition, including, but not limited to less than 1 minute up to more than 3 hours. Various parameters known in the art can be used for measurement of mucoadhesion. Such parameters include, but are not limited to, mechanical binding to mucous membrane per se or the degree of biological effect of an agent delivered. The compositions are formulated to adhere to or penetrates into the mucosal surface for about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35,40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 150 minutes up to more than 180 minutes after being delivered to the mucosa. In certain embodiments, compositions are formulated to adhere to or penetrates into the mucosal surface for about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12,14,16,18, 20, and 22, 24 or more hours.<br>
Mucosal delivery of agents can be affected either in the absence or in the presence of a carrier. Mucosal administration in presence of a carrier serves various purposes, such as controlled release of biologically active molecules, targeting of biologically active molecules to specific tissues, and facilitating penetration into the mucosal layer.<br>
2.       Compositions<br>
The compositions provided herein, which provide mucosal delivery of agents, are formulated as emulsions, including oil in water and water in oil emulsions. In preparing the compositions, an agent to be delivered is dissolved either in the oil phase or the water phase prior to forming an emulsions. The compositions optionally include additional ingredients, such as surface active agents for stabilizing the emulsions.<br>

The water-in-oil emulsions contain at least 25% of oil by weight, in one embodiment between 30% and 80% and in another embodiment between 40% and 95% of oil by weight. The water phase in the water in oil emulsions is at least 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30% or more by weight of the emulsion. The emulsifier or surfactant in the emulsions is at least 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% by weight of the emulsion.<br>
The compositions provided herein also can include one or more other additives, such as a polymer, a cosolvent, an antioxidant, an antiseptic, a buffering agent, a chelating agent, a colorant, a flavorant, an odorant, an osmotic modifier, a preservative, a solubilizer, a tonicifier, a trace element, a viscomodulator and a mixture thereof. Such additional additives can be present in the oil phase, the aqueous phase, or both. a.       Mucoadhesive proteins<br>
The compositions contain one or more mucoadhesive proteins. The mucoadhesive proteins for use in the compositions and methods provided herein include any protein that imparts a mucoadhesive property to the composition whereby the composition when administered to a subject's mucosal surface, such as oral or nasal mucosa, adheres or penetrates into the mucosal epithelium of the subject for a period of time sufficient to achieve quantitative delivery of an agent to be delivered. In certain embodiments, the compositions adhere to or penetrate through the mucosal membrane for a<br>
period of time sufficient to locally deliver a therapeutically-effective amount of an active agent in the composition. Adhesion of mucoadhesive protein to the mucous membrane occurs primarily via secondary chemical bonds, such as hydrogen bonding and Van der Waal forces.<br>
Any mucoadhesive protein that is biologically compatible can be empbyed.   Mucoadhesive proteins for use herein include, but are not limited to natural or synthetic proteins, polypeptides or fragments thereof that possess the mucoadhesive property. Mucoadhesive proteins can be screened for their ability to be used as mucoadhesives for mucosal delivery of compositions provided herein according to the methodology described in Smart et a/., 1982 J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 34:70P and Smart et a/., 1984 J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 36:295. The methodology involves estimating values of adhesive strength between the mucoadhesive protein and the mucous membrane.<br>
In certain embodiments, the mucoadhesive proteins are selected from a family of mucin proteins and transferrins. In certain embodiments, the mucoadhesive protein is from transferrin family and is selected from bovine lactoferrin, human lactoferrin, lactoferrin binding proteins, recombinant human lactoferrin, lactoferricin, lactoferricin b, transferrin binding proteins, bovine transferrin, ovotransferrin, neutrophil granules, apo-lactoferrin and lanthanide-lactoferrin. In certain embodiments, the mucoadhesive proteins are selected from among lactorferrin, lactoferrin binding proteins, recombinant lactoferrin, lactoferricin, lactoferricin b, transferrin binding proteins, transferrin, ovotransferrin, neutrophil granules, apo-lactoferrin, immunoglobulin, albumin and lanthanide-lactoferrin. In certain embodiments, the mucoadhesive protein is selected from albumin, immunoglobulin and lactoferrin.<br>
In certain embodiments, the mucoadhesive protein for use in the compositions and methods provided herein is lactoferrin. In certain embodiments, the compositions contain one, two or three mucoadhesive proteins.   In certain embodiments, the compositions contain one<br>
mucoadhesive protein. In certain embodiments, the mucoadhesive protein in the compositions provided herein is present in an amount sufficient to confer a mucoadhesive property to the composition.<br>
The mucoadhesive proteins can associate with the delivery vehicle via chemical or physical interaction. For example, the mucoadhesive protein can be hydrogen bonded with polar head groups of the micelles or the liposomes or other vehicles that are present in the emulsion in the compositions provided herein. Such compositions when administered either orally or nasally, to a subject in need thereof, adhere to or penetrate through the mucosal membrane via chemical or physical bond, such as secondary chemical bonds, including hydrogen bonding and Van der Waal forces, thereby providing sustained or prolonged coating of the composition on the epithelium of the oral cavity or nasal cavity depending on the mode of administration. The sustained coating of the composition allows for increased contact time between the composition and the epithelial layer, which in turn results in enhanced absorption of the active agent in to the mucosal layer.<br>
The amount of mucoadhesive protein in the compositions provided herein, is an amount that results in quantitative delivery of an agent formulated therewith. The amount to be added can vary depending upon the agent delivered and other components of a composition, but it can be determined empirically by formulating compositions and testing them for delivery using any suitable assay known to those of skill in the art or as described herein.<br>

2.       Exemplary procedures for preparing the compositions<br>
Exemplary procedures for preparing the compositions are described below:<br>
a.       Procedure A<br>
Included among the compositions provided herein are oil in water emulsions where the agent to be delivered is soluble in the water phase or in the oil phase. Such compositions can be prepared by any suitable method known in the art, including the following procedure.  The compositions are prepared at a temperature and pressure at which all the oil and water soluble<br>
components are soluble in the oil and water phases, respectively and the mucoadhesive protein and the agent to be delivered are not degraded in any way. For example, the temperature for heating the solution can be maintained at about 100°-150° F, in certain embodiments, 115° F, for all phases; and the pressure is at maintained about 20-30 pounds-per-square inch (PSI). In certain embodiments, when using this range and a water jacket, the pressure can be about 25 PSI.<br>
i)       Oil phase<br>
The oils used in the oil phase are weighed, added in a suitable vessel, such as a reactor tank and mixed to form a solution. The solution is heated and maintained at a temperature where all the oil soluble components can be dissolved in the oil phase while retaining their activity. A suitable temperature during the mixing step can be determined empirically for a particular combination of ingredients in the composition. Typically, the temperature is maintained at about 100-120 °F, in some embodiments, at about 115 °F. A cosolvent, such as propylene glycol, is weighed and mixed with the oil solution at a speed where complete dissolution of the ingredients is achieved without denaturing or otherwise leading to degradation of the any active ingredients. Generally, mixing is carried out at about 10 rpm, 50 rpm, 100 rpm, 150 rpm, 200 rpm, 250 rpm, 300 rpm up to about 1000 rpm in oil phase. The oil preservatives, for example, methyl paraben and propyl paraben are weighed and added to the oil phase and the mixture is mixed to dissolve the preservatives. A sterile solution of benzyl hydroxide or benzyl benzoate is added and dissolved in the solution followed by addition of emulsifiers, lipids, phospholipids and polymers. If the agent to be delivered is soluble in the oil phase, it is added and mixed to dissolve. The temperature and pressure are maintained throughout the procedure to retain the activity of the agent to be delivered. In certain embodiments, the reactor vessel is closed to prevent evaporation of any of the ingredients or maintained at other conditions that minimize evaporation, such as contained in a beaker in small volume. When<br>
the combination of ingredients is such that evaporation is not a problem, the reaction vessel does not necessarily have to be sealed.<br>
ii)      Water phase<br>
The required amount of water used in the water phase is weighed and added in a suitable vessel, such as a reactor tank. The water phase is heated and maintained at a predetermined temperature such that the mucoadhesive protein and the active agent, when soluble in water phase, retain their activities. For example, in the compositions that contain lactoferrin, the temperature is maintained at or below 100 degrees F or about 115 °F, but not lower than 65-68 degrees F in order prevent lactoferrin from denaturing. The temperature and pressure are monitored and maintained throughout the procedure. The preservatives, for example, Na Benzoate and K Sorbate are weighed and added to the water phase and the mixture is mixed to dissolve the preservatives. A predetermined amount of lipids, phospholipids and polymers to achieve a stable emulsion, is added and dissolved. The temperature of the water phase is maintained at all times at a level that prevents denaturation of the mucoadhesive proteins. The mucoadhesive protein, required in an amount sufficient to achieve quantitative delivery of the agent to be delivered, is added to the water phase and mixed to dissolve. Where the agent to be delivered is water soluble, it is added and mixed to dissolve. The mixing is carried out at a speed where complete dissolution of the ingredients is achieved without denaturing or otherwise leading to degradation of the any active ingredients. Generally, mixing is carried out at about 10 rpm, 50 rpm, 100 rpm, 150 rpm, 200 rpm, 250 rpm, 300 rpm up to about 1000 rpm in water phase. In certain embodiments, the reactor vessel, such as reactor tank, is closed to prevent evaporation of any of the ingredients or maintained at other conditions that minimize evaporation, such as contained in a beaker in small volume. When the combination of ingredients is such that evaporation is not a problem, the reaction vessel does not necessarily have to be sealed.<br>
Hi)      Formation of Emulsion<br>
The oil phase is added to the water phase. This can be achieved, for example, by pumping, manually adding or any other means of transferring from the oil tank to the water tank. As the oil phase is being added to the water phase, the mixture is mixed at a speed to sufficient to create the emulsion without denaturing or otherwise leading to degradation of the any active ingredients. The mixing can be effected at about 100 RPM, 300 rpm, 500 rpm, 700 rpm, 1000 rpm, 10,000 rpm, 20,000 rpm, 30,000 rpm, 40,000 rpm, 50,000 rpm, 60,000 rpm up to about 100,000 PRM. The mixing step can involve shearing or just light mixing to create the emulsion. In certain embodiments, mixing is achieved by shearing. In certain embodiments, the pH of the emulsion is a function of the mucoadhesive protein used. The emulsion is maintained at neutral or basic pH throughout these steps. b.       Procedure B<br>
Included among the compositions provided herein are water-in-oil emulsions, where the agent for delivery is soluble in the oil phase. They can be prepared by any suitable method, including the following procedure and any modifications thereof. In all phases the temperature and pressure of the solution are maintained at a level sufficient to dissolve all the ingredients while retaining the activity of mucoadhesive protein and the agent to be delivered. The temperature generally is maintained at about 90° F to 110° F, typically at about 100° F or 115°F. A suitable temperature during the mixing step can be determined empirically for a particular combination of ingredients in the composition. Typically, the temperature is maintained at about 100-120 °F, in some embodiments, at about 115 °F. Pressure is adjusted to achieve the dissolution of the components while maintaining the activity of the mucoadhesive protein and the agent to be delivered. For the temperature range used in the procedures provided herein, the pressure (in pounds-per-square inch PSI) is in the range of about 20 to about 30 PSI, typically the pressure in the water jacket for heating the mixture is maintained at about 25<br>
PSI. Generally the water phase is added to the oil phase to produce a composition for mucosal delivery.<br>

and polymers to achieve stable emulsion are added and dissolved.   For the compositions containing mucoadhesive proteins, such as lactoferrin, temperature is maintained at or below 100 degrees F, in certain embodiments, 115°F, but not tower than room temperature in order prevent the protein from denaturing. Temperature and pressure are maintained throughout the procedure. The mucoadhesive protein, required in an amount sufficient to achieve quantitative delivery of the agent to be delivered, is added to the water phase and mixed to dissolve. An agent to be delivered, if soluble in the water phase, is added and mixed to dissolve. In certain embodiments, the reactor vessel, such as reactor tank, is closed to prevent evaporation of any of the ingredients or maintained at other conditions that minimize evaporation, such as contained in a beaker in small volume. When the combination of ingredients is such that evaporation is not a problem, the reaction vessel does not necessarily have to be sealed. Hi)      Formation of Emulsion<br>

The emulsion is maintained at pH or basic during these steps.<br>
c.       Procedure C<br>
This procedure can be used for either oil in water or water in oil emulsion where the agent to be delivered is soluble in the water phase or in the oil phase. Such compositions can be prepared by any suitable method<br>
known in the art, including the following procedure.  The compositions are prepared at a temperature and pressure at which all the oil and water soluble components are soluble in the oil and water phases, respectively and the mucoadhesive protein and the agent to be delivered are .not degraded in any way. For example, the temperature for heating the solution can be maintained at about 100°-150° F for all phases; and the pressure is at maintained about 20-30 pounds-per-square inch (PSI). For example, when using temperature in this range and a water jacket, the pressure can be about 25 PSI.<br>

The required amount of water used in the water phase is weighed and added in a reactor tank. The water phase is heated and maintained at a predetermined temperature such that the mucoadhesive protein and the active agent, when soluble in water phase, retain their activities. For example, in the compositions that contain lactoferrin, the temperature is maintained at or below 100 degrees F, or about 115° F but not lower than 65-68 degrees F in order prevent lactoferrin from denaturing. The temperature and pressure are monitored and maintained throughout the procedure.

E.      Methods of use of the compositions<br>
Provided herein are methods of mucosal delivery of agents to subjects. The methods for mucosal delivery of an agent provided herein include providing a composition for mucosal delivery and contacting the composition with a mucosal surface of a subject, whereby the agent is delivered into the circulatory system of the subject. Contacting a mucosal surface, such as the oral, nasal or other mucosal surface, of a subject with a composition provided herein permits delivery of the composition and hence of any selected agent that can be formulated as an emulsion. Contacting can be effected by any suitable method. For example, methods provided include the steps of providing a pharmaceutical composition as described herein, including an agent for delivery and administering the composition to the mucosa of the subject, generally either by oral, intranasal inhalation or other method whereby the composition contacts mucosa in the subject.<br>
In the methods provided herein, the compositions can contact, adhere and/or penetrate into the mucosal lining from about 1 minute up to about 24 hours and more, typically, about 1,2,3, 5,10,15,20,30,60,120 minutes. In some embodiments, in the methods provided herein, the compositions can contact, adhere and/or penetrate into the mucosal lining for about 2,3,4,6,8, 10,12,14,16,18, 20 ,22 or up to 24 hours.<br>
The compositions provided herein can be administered by methods known to those of skill in the art, including, but not limited to delivering the composition in oral cavity or nasal cavity. The composition can be sprayed into the oral cavity or nasal cavity, administered as soft capsule filled with the liquid composition or contacted to the mucosal surface in the oral and nasal cavity by any other means known in the art. When delivering with a soft capsule, the capsule can then be chewed by the subject to release the<br>
composition into the oral cavity. The intranasal composition is applied to the nasal mucosa via topical application (spray and/or drops) of a safe and effective amount of the composition. The frequency of administration of the composition may vary, depending upon personal or medical needs, but generally ranges from about once per day to about four times daily.<br>
The compositions are designed for delivery to a mucosal membrane whereby the agent to be delivered get absorbed into the mucosa and directly enters into circulation. The amount of agent that is absorbed through the mucosal lining can be assessed by methods known In the art and described herein. For example, the amount of agent absorbed can be assessed by measuring the amount of agent administered to the subject and comparing it to the amount thereof found in a blood sample. The blood sample can obtained at different time intervals. The interval of time can be empincaHy determined based on such factors as the agent to be delivered and the mode of administration. The amount of agent to be delivered per dosage depends on the amount of agent absorbed through the mucosal Hning and other factors such as age and physical condition of the subject.<br>
