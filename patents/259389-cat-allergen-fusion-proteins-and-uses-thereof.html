				<td>FILED OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is in the fields of medicine, public health, immunology, molecular biology md virology. The invention provides compositions comprising a virus-like particle (VLP) or a virus particle and at least one antigen, particularly at least one feline antigen, and more particularly at least one feline antigen that is a human allergen. In certain embodiments, the antigen is a Pel dl antigen or a fragment thereof, covalently linked to the VLP. The invention also provides methods for producing the compositions. The compositions of the invention induce efficient immune responses, in particular antibody responses, in mammals, particularly humans. The compositions and methods of the invention are useful in the production of vaccines, in particular for the treatment and/or prevention of allergies to cat dander ar d other cat antigens and allergens.<br>
RELATE DART<br>
The domestic cat (Felis domesticus) is an important source of indoor allergens (Lau, S., et al. (2000) Lancet 356, 1392-1397). Indeed, cats are found in about 25% of households in Western countries and allergy to cats is found in a large part of the population. The severity.of symptoms range from relatively mild rhinitis and conjunctivitis to potentially life-threatening asthmatic exacerbation.<br>
Although patients are occasionally sensitised to several different molecules in cat dander and pelts, the major allergen is Pel d 1 (i.e. Felis domesticus allergen 1; formerly Cat 1, i.e. Cat allergen ), The importance of this allergen has been emphasised in numerous studies. In fact more than 80% of cat allergic patients exhibit IgE antibodies to this potent allergen (van Ree. R.,etal. 11999) J. Allergy Clin Immunol 104, 1223-1230).<br>
Fel dl is a 35-39 kDa acidic glycoprotein containing 10-20% N-linked carbohydrates and is found in the pelt, saliva and lachrymal glands of cats. It is formed by two non-covalently linked heterodimers. Each heterodimer consists of one 70 residue peptide (known as "chain 1") and one 78, 85, 90 or 92 residue peptide (known as "chain 2") which are encoded by separate genes (see Duffort, 0. A., et al. (1991) Mol Immunol 28. 301-309; Morgenstern, J. P., et al; (1991) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 88, 9690-9694 and Griffith, l. J.. ct al. (1992) Gene 113. 263-268). Treatment of cat allergic patients is currently effected by desensitization therapy involving repeated njections with increasing dosages of either a crude cat dander extract or short peptides derived from Fel dl. Lilja et al and Hedlin et al have disclosed a desensitization program in the<br>
eourse of which crude cat dander extracts have been given to cat allergic patients (Lilja, Q, et al. (1989)  J Allergy Clin lmmunol 83, 37-44 and Hedlin, et al. (1991) J Allergy Clin lmmunol 87, 955-964), This program took at least two to three years and the patients after three year treatment still had systemic symptoms. Using short peptides derived from Pel dl for desensitii:ation resulted in non-significant difference between the peptide group and the placebo group (Oldfield, W. L.. et al. (2002) Lancet 360, 47-53). Efficacy was only seen when large amount (750 Âµg) of the short peptide was given to patients (Norman, P. S., et al, (1996) Am J Respir Crit Care Med 154. 1623-1628).<br>
Allergic side effects, such as late asthmatic reactions, have been reported in both crude cat dander extract treatment and in short peptide treatment. Therefore, anaphylactic shock due to the injected allergen is of great safety concern for any desensitization program. Avoidance of such effect by reducing the injected amount of allergen, however, either reduces the efficacy of the treatment or prolongs the treatment. Thus, there is a great need in the field of cat-allergy treatment for alternative desensitization regimes, and hereby in particular for desensitization regimes tnat are able to reduce allergic symptoms, but do not trigger allergic side reaction.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have, now, surprisingly found that the inventive compositions and vaccines, respectively, comprising at least one Pel dl antigen or fragment thereof of the invention, are not only capable of inducing immune responses against Pel dl, and hereby in particular antibody responses, but are. furthermore, capable of desensitizing a patient suffering from cat allergy, and hereby in particular, within a short period of time, indicating the high efficacy of the inventive eomposit ons and vaccines, respectively. In addition, we have surprisingly found that Pel dl of the invention, when covalently linked to the VLP in accordance with the invention, has dramatically reduced anaphylaclic activity as compared to Pel dl  of the invention not covalently linked to VLP while maintaining a high degree of antigenecity and immunogenecity. This is  of great advantage over prior art cat allergy treatments because the inventive composit ons and vaccines, respectively, dramatically reduce the risk of causing anaphylactic shock in animals and humans to be immunized. Furthermore, the inventive compositions and vaccines, respectively, allow the antigen to be given in much higher dose compared with prior art cat allergy treatments, which may in turn improve the efficacy and/or shorten the whole desensitization program. Thus, the inventive compositions and vaccines, respectively, induce potent anci-Fel dl immune responses but do not trigger an allergic reaction.<br>
thus in the first aspect, the present invention provides a composition which comprises (a) a core particle with at least one first attachment site, wherein said core particle is a virus-like particle (VLP) or a virus particle; and (b) at least one antigen with at least one second attachment site, wherein said at least one antigen is Pel dl protein or a Pel dl fragment, and wherein (a) and (b) are covalently linked through said at least one first and said at least one second attachment site, preferably to form an ordered and repetitive antigen array. In another aspect, the present invention provides a vaccine composition. Furthermore, the present invention provides a method to administering the vaccine composition to a human or a non-human mammal, such as dog, which is allergic to cat, preferably to cat Pel dl. In one preferred embodiment, the vaccine composition further comprises at least one adjuvant. The inventive vaccine composition is, however, capable of inducing strong immune response, in particular antibody response, without the presence of at least one adjuvant. Thus, in one preferred embodiment, the vaccine is devoid of an adjuvant. The avoidance of using adjuvant may reduce a possible occurrence of side effects relating to the using of adjuvants. In one preferred embodiment, the VLP comprised by the composition and the vaccine composit.on, respectively, is recombinantly produced in a host and the VLP is essentially free of host UNA, preferably free of host nucleic acids. It is advantageous to reduce, or preferably to eliminate, the amount of host, preferably free of host nucleic acids, to avoid unwanted T cell responses as well as other unwanted side effects, such as fever.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the composition of the invention further comprises at least one immunostimulatory substance, preferably at least one immunostimulatory nucleic acid. In one further preferred embodiment, the immunostimulatory nucleic acid is packaged inside the VLP of the invention. The inclusion of immunostimulatory substances, preferably immunostimulatory nucleic acids, into the composition of the invention may drives the immune responses towards Thl responses and thereby suppressing the Th2 responses and hence suppressing the production of lgR.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating cat allergy by administering the inven:ive composition or vaccine, respectively, into a cat allergic object, preferably human. In a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the inventive composition and an acceptable pharmaceutical carrier.<br>
In again a further aspect, the present invention provides for a method of producing the composit on of the invention comprising (a) core particle with at least one first attachment site, wherein said core particle is a virus-like particle (VLP) or a virus particle; (b) providing at least one antigsn with at least one second attachment site, wherein said antigen is a Pel dl protein or<br>
a Feldl fragment; and (c) combining said core particle and said at least one antigen to produce said" com position, wherein said at least one antigen and said core particle are linked through said at least one first and said at least one second attachment sites.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a Pel dl fusion protein comprising chain 1 of Pel dl and chain 2 of Pel dl fused via an amino acid spacer, which links the N-tenninus of one chain with the C-terminus of another chain, wherein said amino acid spacer consists of an amino acid sequence having 10-30 amino acid residues, and wherein said fusion protein is produced in E. coli or wherein said fusion protein is not glycosylated.<br>

The term "non-replicative", as used herein, refers to being incapable of replicating the genome comprised by the VLP. The term "non-infectious", as used herein, refers to being incapable of entering the host cell. Preferably a virus-like particle in accordance with the invention is non-replicative and/or non-infectious since it lacks all or part of th; viral genome or genome function. In one embodiment, a virus-like particle is a virus particle, in which the viral genome has been physically or chemically inactivated.

In one preferred embodiment, the compositions and vaccines of the invention have an antigen density being from 0.5 to 4.0. The term "antigen density", as used herein, refers to the average number cf Pel dl of the invention which is linked per subunit, preferably per coat protein, of the VLP. and hereby preferably of the VLP of a RNA phage.

In one preferred embodiment. Pel dl protein is a recombinant Pel dl protein, wherein at least one disu fide bond is disrupted, preferably by mutation, more preferably by conservative substitution, such as Cys to Ser.

(Kristensen, A. K.. et a!. (1997) Biol Chem 378, 899-908). In one preferred embodiment, one such disulfide bond of Pel d 1 protein is disrupted.

In one preferred embodiment, the antigen of the invention comprises or alternatively consists of a Pel dl fragment. It is known that possession of immunogenecity does not usually require the full length of a protein and usually a protein contains more than one antigenic epitope, i.e. antigenic site. A fragment or a short peptide may be sufficient to contain at least one antigenic site that can be bound immunospecifically by an antibody or by a T-cell receptor within the context of an MHC molecule. Antigenic site or sites can be determined by a number of techniques generally known to the skilled person in the art. It can be done by sequence alignment and structure prediction. By way of example, one can predict possible a-helices, turns, inter- and intra- chain disulfide bonds, etc. using a program such as Rasmol. One can further pi edict sequences that are buried within the molecule or sequences that are exposed on the surface of the molecule. Sequences exposed on the surface of the molecule are more likely to comprise natural antigenic site(s), and thus are useful in inducing therapeutic antibodies. After a surface peptide sequence has been determined, the antigenic site within this sequence can be further defined by, for example, exhaustive mutagenesis method (such as alanine scanning mutagenesis.

Another class of cross-linkers suitable in the practice of the invention is characterized by the introduction of a disulfide linkage between the Pel dl of the invention and the VLP upon coupling. Preferred cross-linkers belonging to this class include, for example, SPDP and Sulfo-LC-SPDP (Pierce).<br>
In a pre erred embodiment, the composition of the invention further comprises a linker. Engineering of a second attachment site onto the Pel dl of the invention is achieved by the association of a linker, preferably containing at least one amino acid suitable as second attachment site according to the disclosures of this invention. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a linker is associated to the Pel dl of the invention by way of at least one covalent bond, preferably, by at least one, typically one peptide bond.

In a further preferred embodiment the linker is added to the N-terninus of Fel dl of the invention. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the linker is added to the C-tenninus of Fel d 1 of the invention.<br>
Preferred linkers according to this invention are glycine linkers (G)n further containing a cysteine residue as second attachment site, such as N-terminal glycine linker (GCGGGG) and C-terminal glycine linker (GGGGCG). Further preferred embodiments are C-terminal glycine-lysine linker (GGKKGC. SEQ ID NO:67) and N-terminal glycine-lysine linker (CGKKGG. SEQ ID N0:68), GGCG a GGC or GGC-NH2 ("NH2" stands for amidation) linkers at the C-terminus of the peptide or CGG at its N-tenninus. In general, glycine residues will be inserted between bulky amino acids and the cysteine to be used as second attachment site, to avoid potential steric hindrance of the bulkier amino acid in the coupling reaction.

N-terminus and two C-terminus. The linker may be fused to both of the two N-terminus or to<br>
both of the C-terminus. Preferably the linker is fused to only one of the two N-terminus or only one of the two C-terminus.<br>
Unking of the Pel dl of the invention to the VLP by using a hetero-bifunctional cross-linker according to the preferred methods described above, allows coupling of the Pel dl of the invention to the VLP in an oriented fashion. Other methods of linking the Pel dl of the invention to the VLP include methods wherein the Pel dl of the invention is cross-linked to the VLP, usiig the carbodiimide EDC, and NHS. The Pel dl of the invention may also be first thiolated through reaction, for example with SATA. SATP or iminothiolane. The Pel dl of the invention, after deprotection if required, may then be coupled to the VLP as follows. After separation of the excess thiolation reagent, the Pel dl of the invention is reacted with the VLP, previously activated with a hetero-bifunctional cross-linker comprising a cysteine reactive moiety, fnd therefore displaying at least one or several functional groups reactive towards cysteine residues, to which the thiolated Pel dl of the invention can react, such as described above. Optionally, low amounts of a reducing agent are included in the reaction mixture. In further methods, the Pel dl of the invention is attached to the VLP, using a homo-bifunctional cross-linker such as glutaraldehyde, DSG, BM[PEO]4, BS3, (Pierce) or other known homo-bifunctional cross-linkers with functional groups reactive towards amine groups or carboxyl groups of the VLP.<br>
In other embodiments of the present invention, the composition comprises or alternatively consists essentially of a virus-like particle linked to Pel dl of the invention via chemical interactions, wherein at least one of these interactions is not a covalent bond. For example, linking crthe VLP to the Pel dl of the invention can be effected by biotinylating the VLP and expressing the Pel dl of the invention as a streptavidin-fusion protein.<br>
One or several antigen molecules, i.e. Pel dl of the invention, can be attached to one subunit of the VLP. preferably of RNA phage coat proteins, preferably through the exposed lysine residues of the coat proteins of RNA phage VLP, if sterically allowable. A specific feature of the VLPs of RNA phage and in particular of the QÃ coat protein VLP is thus the possibility to couple several antigens per subunit. This allows for the generation of a dense antigen array. In very preferred embodiments of the invention, the Pel dl of the invention is linked via a cysteine residue, having been added to either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the Pel dl of the invention, or a natural cysteine residue within the Pel dl of the invention, to lysine residues of coat proteins of the VLPs of RNA phage, and in particular to the coat protein of QÃ.<br>
ibed above, four lysine residues are exposed on the surface of the VLP of 03 coat proiein. "ypicaily and preferably these residues are derivatized upon reaction with a cross-iinker molecule. In the instance where not all of the exposed lysine residues can be coupled to an antigen, the lysine residues which have reacted with the cross-linker are left with a cross-linker molecule attached to the s-amino group after the derivatization step. This leads to disappearance of one or several positive charges, which may be detrimental to the solubility and stability of the VLP. By replacing some of the lysine residues with arginines, as in the disclosed QÃ coat protein mutants, we prevent the excessive disappearance of positive charges since the arginine residues do not react with the preferred cross-linkers. Moreover, replacement of lysine residues by arginine residues may lead to more defined antigen arrays, as fewer sites are available for reaction to the antigen.<br>
Accordingly, exposed lysine residues were replaced by arginines in the following QÃcoat protein mutants: QÃ-240 (Lysl3-Arg; SEQ ID NO: 15), QÃ-250 (Lys 2-Arg. Lysl3-Arg; SEQ ID NO: 17), QÃ-259 (Lys 2-Arg, Lysl6-Arg; SEQ ID NO: 19) and QÃ-251; (Lysl6-Arg, SEQ ID NO:18). In a further embodiment, we disclose a QÃ mutant coat protein with one additional lysine residue QÃ-243 (Asn 10-Lys; SEQ ID NO: 16), suitable for obtaining even higher density arrays of antigens.<br>

Disassembly: 20 ml of AP205 VLP solution (1.6 mg/ml in PBS, purified from E.coli extract) was mixed with 0.2 ml of 0.5 M DTT and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 5 ml of 5 M NaCl was added and the mixture was then incubated for 15 min at 60 Â°C, causing precipitation of the DTT-reduced coat proteins. The turbid mixture was centrifuged (rotor Sorvall SS34, 10000 g, 10 min, 20 Â°C) and the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was dispersed in 20 ml of 1 M Urea/20mM Na Citrate pH 3.2. After stirring for 30 min at room temperature, the dispersion was adjusted to pH 6.5 by addition of 1.5 M Na2HPO4 and then<br>
centrifuged (rotor Sorvall SS34.  10000g, 10min. 20 Â°C) to obtain supernatant containing dimeric coat protein.<br>
Cation exchange chroinatography: The supernatant (see above) was diluted with 20 ml water to adjust a conductivity of approx. 5 mS/cm. The resulting solution was loaded on a column of 6 ml SP Sepharose FF (Amershain Bioscience) which was previously equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.5 buffer. After loading, the column was washed with 48 ml of 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.5 buffer followed by elution of the bound coat protein by a linear gradient to 1 M Nad over 20 column volumes. The fractions of the main peak were pooled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and UV spectroscopy. According to SDS-PAGE, the isolated coat protein was essentially pure from other protein contaminations. According to the UV spectrosc apy, the protein concentration was 0.6 mg/ml (total amount 12 ing), taking that 1 A280 unit reflects 1.01 mg/ml of AP205 coat protein. Furthermore, the value of A280 (0.5999) over the "alue of A260 (0,291) is 2, indicating that the preparation is essentially free of nucleic acids.<br>

EXAMPLE 5<br>
Oxidative folding disulfide bonds in purified Fel dl fusion proteins<br>
Nr'-affirity purified FELD1-HC consists of a variety of mixed-disulfide bridged species from 1 5 kD to 20 kD. Native folding of FELD1-HC was achieved by intramolecular reshuffling the disulfide bonds with oxidized glutathion (GSSG, Applichem) and reduced glutathion (GSH, Appliche;n) at a molar ratio of 1:1. The reaction was performed for 24 hours immediately after<br>
o'TELDl in the elution buffer by adding 2.5 mM GSSG and 2.5 mM GSH at room temperature. Refolded FELD1-HC showed a single band at a molecular weight of 15 kD under non-reducing condition (FIG. 1. the first panel, lane 2). The potential free sulfhydryl groups of FELD1-HC were alkylated using iodoacetamide (Sigma). Probes were treatd with 5 mM iodoacetamide in 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8.0 for 15 minutes at room temperature. Refolded FELD1-HC was further purified to homogeneity by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Superdex 75 pg, Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences) equilibrated in PBS. FELDI-10aa-MC and FELDl-15aa-HC were renatured by substantially the same method as described above (FIG. 1, the two middle panels).<br>

EXAMPLE 6<br>
Fel dl fusion proteins are recognized by epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies The binding of Fel dl fusion proteins in comparison to natural Fel dl (nFel dl) to epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAB) was measured by a sandwich ELISA using the Fel dl EL1SA kit (6F9/3E4) from Indoor biotechnologies (Cardiff, UK).<br>
Briefly, the anti-Fel d 1 mAB 6F9 supplied as a 2 mg/ml stock solution was diluted 1:1000 in 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonite buffer pH 9.6. Microtiter wells were coated with 100 ul of the diluted mAB 6F9 per well at 4Â°C overnight. Plates were washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween20 (PBS-T) and then blocked with 100 ul blocking buffer (1% BSA (Sigma) in PBS-T). Then the microtiter wells were incubated for one hour with 100 ul of Fel dl fusion proteins or nFel dl standard (Indoors technologies; UK) using doubling dilutions from 80-0.16 ng/ml. The nFel dl reference was sub-standardized from the CBER cat dander reference E10, which contains 13.47 U/ml Fel dl (1 unit = 4 mg protein).<br>
Plates were then washed and 100 Âµl diluted (1:1000 in 1% BSA/PBS-T) biotinylated anti-Fel dl mAB 3E4 antibody was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS-T using 100 ul diluted (1:1000 in 1% BSA/PBS-T) Streptavidin-Peroxidase (Sigma S5512. 0.25 mg reconstituted in 1 ml destilled water). After 30 minutes incubation at room temperature wells were washed three times with PBS-T. Detection was<br>
with OPD substrate solution and 5% H2SO4 as stop solution. The absorbance was measured using ELISA reader (BioRad) at 450 nm and for calculation of arithmetic means and standard error of the mean (SEM) EXCEL software (MS Office: Microsoft) was used. The results are shown in TABLE 1. Thus the recognition of Pel dl fusion proteins and nFel dl by cpitope-soecific mABs reflects the high similarity of antigcnicity of both proteins.<br>

EXAMPLE 7). Graded amounts of QÃ-FELDl-HC or corresponding amounts of FELD1-HC<br>
(obtained from EXAMPLE 5) were introduced into the skin of a cat allergic individual and the<br>
skin reaction was assessed 20 minutes later. QÃ-FELD1-HC was unable to trigger a skin<br>
reaction while FELD1-HC was active at more than 100 fold lower concentrations (TABLE 3)<br>
TABLEÃ : Corresponding amounts of FELD1-HC were present in both preparations.<br><br>
(Table Removed)HXAMPLE 16<br>
Immunization of an allergic individual with QB-FELDI-HC reduces skin prick test reactivity In order to test the ability of QÃ-FELD-HC to ameliorate clinical symptoms, a patient suffering from cat allergy was vaccinated with 17ug QÃ-FELDl-HC (obtained from EXAMPLE 7) on dav 0 (3 injections of 2, 5 and 10 ug), 40 ug on day 7 (3 injections of 10, 10 and 20 ug) and 50<br>
day 14 (2 injections of 10 and 40 ug). Skin prick testes were performed with a standardised cat extract on days 0, 14 and 21 and the diameters of the central swelling reaction was quantified (FIG 3). Within 3 weeks, 1000-fold higher allergen concentrations were required 10 induce clinical symptoms in the skin prick test than the initial amount sufficient to induce symptom in the prick test.<br>
EXAMPLE 17<br>
Immunization of an allergic individual with QÃ -FELD1-HC reduces allergic symptoms in<br>
nasal provocation test<br>
in order to test the ability of QÃ-FELDI-HC to ameliorate clinical symptoms, a patient suffering from cat allergy was vaccinated with 17ug QÃ-FELD1-HC (obtained from EXAMPLE 7) on clay 0 (3 injections of 2, 5 and 10 ug), 40 ug on day 7 (3 injections of 10, 10 and 20 ug) and 50 ug on day 14 (2 injections of 10 and 40 ug). Nasal provocation tests were performed with a standardized cat extract on days 0, 14 and 21 and the clinical symptoms were assessed at each dose escalation level (FIG 4A) and an overall allergic rating was made according to (FIG 4B). Within 3 weeks, 100-1000-fold higher allergen concentrations were required 10 induce clinical symptoms and the overall allergic rating was strongly reduced.<br>
EXAMPLE. 18<br>
Packaging. immunosimulatory nucleic acids into QÃ VLP<br>
Disassembled and purified coat protein of QÃ was obtained as described in EXAMPLE 1 (A)<br>
and (B). Reassembly, Ã-mercaptoethanol was added to the 10 ml dimer fraction to a final<br>
concentration  of 10%.  and  300  Âµl  of a  solution  of (CpG)20OpA  oligodeoxynucleotide.<br>
containing  12.3 nmol of oligonucleotide, were added. The reassembly mixture was first<br>
dialyzed against 30 ml NET buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 with 5mM EDTA and 150 mM<br>
Nad) containing  10% beta-mercaptoethanol for 2 hours at 4Â°C, and then dialyzed in a<br>
continuous mode, with a flow of NET buffer of 8 ml/h over 4 days at 4Â°C. The reassembly<br>
mixture was then desalted against water by dialysis, with 6 buffer exchanges (4 X 100 ml. 2 X<br>
1 liter).<br>
Coupling Eel dl  fusion proteins lo the OP VLP with packaged CpG inside is carried out<br>
substantially the same as described in EXAMPLE 7<br>

Pel d I specific serum inhibited the Pel dl fusion proteins induced basophil degranulation in vitro<br>
To test the ability of anti-Fel dl specific IgG to inhibit degranulation, basophils of an allergic individual were stimulated with a defined amount of FELD1-HC or FELDl-15aa-HC pre-incubatec with a serial of dilutions of decreasing amounts of IgGs isolated from QÃ-FELD1-HC immunized rabbits. Upregulation of CD63 was assessed by flow cytometry. Anti-Fel dl IgG blocked the Fel dl-induced degranulation at all tested concentrations while control lgG did not show any effect (TABLE 4).<br>

lininunizi ttion of Fel dl allergic mice with OP-FELD1-HC<br>
An experimental asthma model of allergic airway inflammation in mice was used to assess the<br>
effects of vaccination against the natural allergen Fel dl on the IgE antibody response in serum<br>
and BAL  (Bronchoalveolar lavagc) of BALB/c mice. 5 mice per group were peritoneally<br>
sensitizec   with   lug natural  Fel dl   in AlumGel-S at day 0. Mice were subcutaneously<br>
vaccinated on day 35 and 49 with either 50ug Q(3 alone or with 50ug QÃ-FELDl-HC before<br>
iwo subsequent imranasai challenges on day 63 and day 70. 5 days after the last intranasal<br>
challenge, mice \\ere sacrificed to collect serum and BALF (Bronchoaleveolar Lavage Fluid)<br>
lor analysis of the humoral immune response ( \gE subclass tilers) by EL1SA.<br>
plates were coated with a rat anti-IgE mAb (2ug/ml) diluted in Carbonat buffer over night at 4Â°C. After blocking of plated with PBS/5% BSA for 2 hours, plates were incubated for further two hours with either serum (first well 1:100 pre-diluted, then 1:3 dilution over 8 steps) or BAL ; first well pure BAL then 1:3 dilution over 8 steps) of sensitized, vaccinated and antigcn-ctiallenged mice. After 2 hours of sample incubation, serum and BAL-IgE was detected with a rat anti-mouse lgE-HRP labelled antibody prior detection with the substrate OPD.<br>
