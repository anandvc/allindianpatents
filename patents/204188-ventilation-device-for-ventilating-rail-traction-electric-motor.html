COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>

"[VENTILATION    DEVICE  TRACTION    ELECTRIC    MOTOR for ventn lating <br>
ALSTOM, a French company, of 25 avenue Kleber, 75116 Paris, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-	<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
978/MUMNP/2000<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
30-11-2004<br><br><br>
The invention relates to a ventilation device and to a rail traction electric motor equipped with such a device.<br>
In the field of rail traction, an electric motor is generally incorporated at a bogey, under the body of a locomotive or a carriage. As an electric motor can consume a significant amount of electrical power, it needs to be cooled so as to dissipate some of this power and it is known practice to use the ambient atmosphere to do this. However, the surroundings of rail traction motors are generally polluted, on the one hand, because of rubbish which may lie on the track and, on the other hand, because of rain or mud resulting from unfavourable weather conditions. For the above reasons, it is known practice for an electric motor to be protected from its environment by placing filters or gratings  over  the<br>
cooling air intake. It is also known practice for the motor cooling air to be drawn in through a length of trunking, from a region of lower pollution, such as an interior compartment of the train or a region near the roof  of  a  locomotive.   These  measures  introduce â€¢ significant pressure drops along the path along which the cooling air flows, and this reduces its effectiveness and may lead to soiling of the motor. Document (FR-A-2,64 5,817)discloses the ventilating of a rail traction motor using air delivered by a fan, some of this air being discharged by centrifuging into an opening facing which there is a separator element. The heaviest  particles  are  removed  under  the  effect  of centrifugal forces and are therefore not sent towards the interior volume of the motor. However, the effectiveness<br>
of the centrifuging depends essentially on the rotational<br>
speed of the inlet fan, which speed is linked to the<br>
 running speed of the motor. This speed depends on the<br>
conditions of use of the motor, it being possible for a<br>
motor usually to run at a low speed, particularly in the<br><br>
case of an urban rail vehicle of the tramway or trolley bus type. Furthermore, the air discharged through the peripheral opening plays no part in cooling and the acoustic emissions may be generated by the discharge of    part of the air stream directly into the ambient atmosphere.<br>
It is these drawbacks which the invention more<br>
specifically  sets  out  to  overcome  by  proposing  a<br>
ventilation device in which all of the air delivered by a<br>
                  fan is used to cool the motor while the risks of soiling<br>
or pollution are minimized.<br>
With this  in mind,  the invention relates  to a device for ventilating a rail traction electric motor, comprising a centrifugal fan capable of rotating in one or both directions,? placed in an air inlet chamber and delivering air towards the motor, characterized in that the air stream delivered by the fan is split into an inner  stream,  directed  towards  the  interior  of  a<br>
confinement space containing at least the rotor of the   <br>
motor, and an outer stream directed towards ducts for cooling the stator of the motor.<br>
By virtue of the invention, the air stream delivered by the inlet fan is used to cool both the rotor and the stator of the motor, that proportion of the air<br>
	which is most likely to be contaminated with relatively<br>
heavy particles being directed, under the effect of centrifugal force, outwards, that is to say towards the ducts for cooling the stator, while the less contaminated proportion, which constitutes the inner stream, can be<br>
    directed towards the interior of the confinement space without major risk of soiling the inside of the motor.<br>
According to advantageous but not compulsory aspects of the invention, the device incorporates one or more of the following features:<br>
   The fan delivers into a feed nozzle for the said ducts, a partition which separates the internal volume of this nozzle from the confinement space being pierced with at least one communication opening allowing the said first stream to circulate.  It is possible to provide<br><br>
several openings for communication between the internal<br>
volume of the nozzle and the space, these openings being<br>
distributed roughly uniformly around a central axis of<br>
the motor. It is also possible to envisage for this or<br>
	these openings to be formed radially on the inside the<br>
path defined by the nozzle for the second stream. By virtue of this aspect of the invention, the first stream of cooling air directed towards the space is "tapped" off the stream directed towards the ducts for cooling the     stator, this tapping taking place at an internal face of the nozzle where the most contaminated air, that is to say the air most heavily laden with relatively heavy particles, is furthest away.<br>
-	There is at least one outlet opening for the<br>
    first air stream to leave the space. This outlet opening<br>
may be formed near the mouth of a duct for cooling the stator. In this case, a rib for separating the air streams leaving this opening and leaving this duct is advantageously provided.<br>
-	A second fan generates or assists a flow of air inside the confinement space, from the inner stream. This second fan increases the movements of the air in the confinement space and thus improves the effectiveness of the cooling of the elements contained in this space.<br>
-	The confinement space contains the rotor, an internal central part of the stator, at least one winding associated with this stator or with this motor, part of the central shaft of the motor and, possibly, a second fan. All of the a forementioned elements are thus cooled by the first air stream.<br>
The invention also relates to a rail traction electric motor equipped with a ventilation device as defined hereinabove Such a motor operates very satisfactorily, including in a contaminated environment,<br>
and its particularly effective cooling means that it may be envisaged for a high power motor according to the invention to be made relatively small in size.<br>
The invention will be better understood and other advantages thereof will emerge more clearly in the light<br><br>
of the description which will follow of two embodiments of a rail traction motor equipped with a ventilation device according to its principle, given merely by way of example and made with reference to the appended drawings,        in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 is a longitudinal section through a rail<br>
traction motor according to a first embodiment of the<br>
invention, and<br>
Figure 2 is a section similar to Figure 1 in the             case of a rail traction motor according to a second<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
The motor  1  depicted in Figure  1  comprises  a<br>
central shaft 2 supported by bearings 3 and 4 and on<br>
which a rotor 5 is mounted.<br>
	The longitudinal axis of the shaft 2, which is the<br>
axis of rotation of the rotor 5, is denoted X-X'.<br>
A stator 8, centred on the axis X-X', is arranged radially around the rotor 5 and equipped with a winding 9. ,The gap between the rotor 5 and the stator 8 is           denoted e.<br>
An end plate 11 supports the bearing 3 and is connected to a flange 12 which is an integral part of the stator 8.<br>
Furthermore, the flange 12 is connected by screws<br>
	16 into a nozzle 17 which defines an inlet orifice 18 for<br>
the air for cooling the motor 1 and supports the bearing 4.<br>
The nozzle 17 comprises an outer casing part 20 and an inner casing part 21 defining between them an internal       volume V of the nozzle 17, the opening 18 being formed in the part 20, while the bearing 4 is secured to the part 21. A grating 22 is provided in the opening 18 and makes it possible to hold back rubbish such as papers or leaves which may tend to enter the nozzle 17 through the        orifice 18.<br>
A fan 24, the radial blades of which are denoted 25, is mounted at one end 2a of the shaft 2, inside an air inlet chamber C formed in the nozzle 17 between the grating 22 and the internal part 21.<br><br><br>
Given the shape and arrangement of the elements 11, 12 and 21, these form a confinement space E for the rotor 5, for part of the shaft 2, for an internal part 8a of the stator 8,. distant from the axis X-X' by a distance  which is shorter than a radius R corresponding approximately to the maximum internal radius R21 of the part 21 and of the winding 9. The space E thus allows the elements 5, 8a and 9 to be protected from the ambient atmosphere and, in         particular,fror dust.<br>
According to the invention, the air stream F1 entering the nozzle 17 through the orifice 18 is delivered by the fan 24 both towards the interior of the space E and towards the stator 8, as depicted by the air streams F2 and F3 respectively.<br>
	The  internal  air  stream F2 passes  through  the<br>
openings 26 formed in the part 21 of the nozzle 17, these openings being distributed about the axis X-X'. The air stream F2 entering the space E is split into two air streams F4 and F5. The air stream F4 passes along ducts 27<br>
                provided in the rotor 5 parallel to the axis X-X' , and this allows the rotor 5 to be cooled effectively. The air stream F5 passes through the gap e between the rotor 5 and the stator 8 and licks the stator.<br>
The circulation of  air  inside  the  space  E  is<br>
      assisted by a second fan 28 mounted on the shaft 2 inside the space E and the blades 29 of which create a movement which agitates the air from the openings 26 and towards several outlet orifices 30 formed in the flange 12. The arrows F6 and F7 have been used to depict the cooling air<br>
     stream in the downstream part and at the outlet from the space E, which stream is the result of the combining of the air streams F4 and F5.<br>
The air stream F3 is, for its part, directed towards ducts 31 made in the stator 8 radially outside the part<br>
             8a. These ducts 21 may be uniformly distributed around the axis X-X' or localized in certain areas, particularly when the stator has a polygonal outline. For example, when the stator 8 has an octagonal outline whereas its central part is circular, the ducts 31 are formed in four<br><br>
external regions of the cross section of the stator. The air stream F3 allows the stator 8 to be cooled and emerges at F8 through an outlet orifice 34 provided at the downstream end of each duct 31 in the flange 12, near the orifices 30.<br>
There is a rib 33 near each orifice 32 to deflect the stream F8 and thus prevent the creation of a back pressure at the nearby orifice 30.<br>
As the second air stream F3 follows a path, defined<br>
    by the nozzle 17 and the ducts 31, which is radially outside the path followed by the first stream F2, it is more heavily laden with impurities which are relatively heavy and are centrifuged by the fan 17, but this is not particularly  troublesome  because  the  ducts  31  are<br>
     separated from the internal volume of the motor defined by the space E and because their cross section is large enough to allow its flow. Furthermore, the ducts 31 are basically straight, which means that the stream F3 is not hampered in its flow and the impurities have little tendency towards becoming deposited in the ducts 31.<br>
By contrast, the air stream F2 is relatively clean because the openings 26 are located radially on the inside of the region of radius R, that is to say inside the path of the second air stream.  Furthermore,  the<br>
	openings 26 are approximately perpendicular to the air<br>
stream F3 in the relevant region of the nozzle 17, the stream F3 constituting the main flow stream, in such a way that the impurities prefer to follow the path of the stream F3.<br>
Thus, the air circulating through the space E is relatively clean and does not risk soiling the rotating parts of the motor 1 or accumulating in the gap e or in the winding 9, even though the path of the air streams F4 to F6 through the space E is relatively tortuous.<br>
	In the second embodiment of the invention, depicted<br>
in Figure 2, the elements which are similar to those of the first embodiment bear identical references. This embodiment differs from the previous one in that the outlet orifices 30 for the internal air stream are offset<br><br><br>
angularly from the ducts 31. Thus, the outlet orifices 32 via which the external flow emerges, as depicted by the arrow FB, are arranged in such a way that the flows F7 and F8 do not interfere with each other. As depicted in Figure<br>
             2, an orifice 32 may be diametrically opposite an orifice 30.<br>
Whatever the embodiment considered, the cooling obtained is of very good quality because all of the stream F1 is used to cool the motor 1. The diameter of the fan 1 can therefore be small compared with devices of the prior art, and this allows a corresponding reduction in the noise emitted by this fan.<br>
Given the fact that impurities are centrifuged towards the outside of the space E, the grating 22 can<br>
       have a relatively large mesh size, which reduces the pressure drops incurred and it is not necessary to perform regular maintenance on a filtration element like those fitted to certain motors of the prior art.<br>
The invention is applicable irrespective of the<br>
      precise type of motor 1, which may be a synchronous motor or an asynchronous motor, of the precise type of fan 24, which may be able to rotate in just one direction or in both directions about the axis X-X', of the type of motor frame which may, in particular, be made of a pack of<br>
      sheets which is force-fitted into a solid surround, possibly with external fins.<br>
According to an alternative form of the invention, not depicted, the flange 12 may be made in several pieces, particularly so as to make it easier for the<br>
     stator 8 to be fitted.<br><br>
