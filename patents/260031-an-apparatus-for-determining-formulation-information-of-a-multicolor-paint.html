BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of determining formulation information of a coating composition for forming a multicolor pattern and visual information of a base material used for forming a desired multicolor pattern coating film on the surface of a target, and to a method of generating a desired multicolor pattern image, showing the image on an image display apparatus, analyzing the image and determining formulation information of a coating composition for forming a multicolor pattern and visual information of a base material.<br>
(2)	Description of the Related Art<br>
A multicolor pattern design is sometimes given to the surfaces of interior and exterior walls of a building to impart special features. As methods of imparting a multicolor pattern design, application of natural materials, adhesion of films, painting and other processes have been used.<br>
Among these, when natural materials such as stones are applied, a design having an impression of high quality can be realized. However, there are the problems that processing and application of stones and modification of designs are difficult, reproducing the identical design is difficult and it may contribute to exhaustion of natural resources.<br>
When a film is adhered, various designs can be presented and high reproducibility is obtained at relatively low costs. However, there are the problems that adhering on curved surfaces and surfaces having projections and recesses and realizing high-quality appearance are difficult, etc.<br>
When a multicolor pattern design is imparted by painting, there are the advantages of relatively easy application, a high<br><br>
degree of freedom in designing, environmental friendliness because of aqueous coating compositions used, etc. However, since a multicolor pattern design is imparted by painting a liquid coating composition, formed design vary depending on the composition formulation of the coating compositions and painting conditions. Accordingly, to obtain a desired multicolor pattern design, determining the composition formulation of coating compositions and painting conditions are important.<br>
For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 1997-220508 discloses a method of readily determining raw material coating compositions of coating compositions for forming a multicolor pattern (hereinafter referred also as multicolor paints) in a short period of time . More specif ically, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 1997-220508 , a picture image of the multicolor pattern coating film is prepared, the types of colors for constituting this picture image are analyzed, the colors constituting the picture image of the analyzed multicolor pattern coating film and the area ratio of each color occupying the image of the multicolor pattern coating film are determined, and the formulation ratio of coloring coating composition particle based on this area ratio is determined.<br>
However, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 1997-220508 mentioned above does not disclose or suggest a method of determining the colors of the coloring particles constituting the multicolor pattern coating film.<br>

variables each of which is assigned to each of the plurality of visual information in advance with an initial value being 0 is increased by one, and the formulation ratio of the coloring particles is determined for all pixels of the color image by using the variable after carrying out the tenth and eleventh steps.<br>
Moreover, the second step may comprise a twelfth step in which the control means determines, from the pixel data in the color image, visual information in the color space to which the visual information of the speckles belong and a thirteenth step in which the control means determines visual information which is in the shortest geometrical distance from the visual information determined in the twelfth step among a plurality of the visual information of the speckles, and adds a numerical value obtained by multiplying the distance by a contributing coefficient depending on the distance to the variable corresponding to the determined visual information among variables each of which is assigned with an initial value being 0 to each of the plurality of visual information in advance, and in the second step the formulation ratio of the coloring particles may be determined by using the variable for all pixels of the color image after carrying out the twelfth and thirteenth steps.<br>

Moreover, the range of the random number corresponding to the visual information of the coloring particle may be determined by using further an average area ratio of single particle among the coloring particles.<br>
Moreover, the particle size distribution may be a log-normal distribution<br><br>

Effect of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, a multicolor pattern can be readily simulated, and formulation information of a coating composition for forming a multicolor pattern and visual information of a base material can be accurately and efficiently determined.<br>
Moreover, by analyzing image data generated by capturing the multicolor pattern of an object which actually occurs in nature, a multicolor pattern coating film which resembles the multicolor pattern in nature can be realized.<br>
Moreover, since minute coloring particles in simulation are rendered as noises, the time for generating a CG image can be shortened, and a CG image having an appearance which is closer to the actual multicolor pattern can be generated.<br><br>
In simulation, coloring particles are rendered as polygons of more than one type whose sizes are log-normally distributed. Therefore, a CG image which is closer to the actual multicolor pattern can be generated.<br>
Moreover, since a single multicolor paint can be produced which is a mixture of more than one type of coloring particles with the determined formulation information, a multicolor pattern coating film can be efficiently formed with a single painting gun without the need for using a gun for each coating composition.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic constitution of a computer system used for carrying out a method of determining formulation information of a multicolor paint and visual information of a base material according to an embodiment of the present invention. This system consists of a process apparatus 101 having an operation means, an image display apparatus (hereinafter simply referred to as display apparatus) 102 which is connected to the process apparatus 101 and is capable of displayin a full-color image, and an image input device 103 which retrieves the image of the surface of an object to be measured 104 on the surface of which a multicolor pattern exsists as electronic data and transmits the data to the process apparatus 101.<br>
The process apparatus 101 is, for example, a computer comprising a keyboard and a mouse for computers as the operation means. The display apparatus 102 is, for example, a CRT display apparatus, liquid crystal display apparatus or the like. Moreover, the image input device 103 is, for example, an image scanner, CCD camera or the like, and obtains a multicolor pattern image of electronic data from the surface of the object<br>
to be measured 104. When the multicolor pattern image is prepared by a designer or captured into the process apparatus 101 via communication lines such as the internet, the image input device 103 is not necessarily be provided.<br>
The outline of the method of determining formulation information of a multicolor paint and visual information of a base material according to an embodiment of the present invention can be described as follows:<br>
Firstly, image data of a desired multicolor pattern, i.e., a pattern formed by distribution of amorphous coloring particles (for example, various kinds of natual materials such as granite) is obtained, and visual information of speckles corresponding to each coloring particle (continuous region of the identical color or approximate colors on the image), that is, representative colors of the speckles are determined. An example of the multicolor pattern is shown in Fig. 2 (a) . Fig. 2 (a) is an image of the surface of granite (China Pink) captured by a scanner.<br>
Secondly, the area ratio of the speckles of the multicolor pattern is determined to reproduce the speckles by using coloring particles of known coating compositions which can reproduce the representative colors of the speckles, and the multicolor pattern image is rendered by computer graphic (hereinafter referred to as CG) by using this area ratio as a formulation ratio of the coloring particles and by using the representative colors and formulation ratio (formulation information) . Fig. 2 (b) is the image in Fig. 2 (a) whose gradation levels are reduced to four colors by image processing. For example, an area ratio can be calculated from the image in Fig. (b) by using image processing, and can be used as a formulation ratio.<br>
Finally, evaluation is made if the rendered image is close to the desired multicolor pattern, and when the desired image is obtained, the formulation information used for rendering the image is determined as the formulation information of the actual coloring particles.<br>
A multicolor paint (a coating composition mixture of coloring particles) is produced by using the determined formulation information of the coloring particles, and is applied on the object (refer to Fig. 3). Fig. 4 is a cross-sectional view which conceptually shows the formed multicolor pattern coating film. In Fig. 4, the uppermost layer is a multicolor pattern coating film, and small figures inside the uppermost layer shows each coloring particle. Each of the coloring particles reproduces each speckle on the multicolor pattern image.<br>
(First embodiment)<br>
The method of determining formulation information of a multicolor paint and visual information of a base material according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be describd now in detail. Fig. 5 is a flowchart for describing the method of determining formulation information of a multicolor paint and visual information of a base material using the system shown in Fig. 1. In the description below, a process carried out by the process apparatus 101 in response to an operation by an observer (designer, etc.) is a processs of reading predeteremined data from an internal recording means (hard disk drive, etc.) to an internal temporary storage means (hereinafter referred to as memory) and using the memory as an work area carried out by an internal central processing unit (hereinafter referred to as CPU) . The CPU suitably records the process results in recording means.<br>
In step SI, the object to be measured 104 is prepared, the image input device 103 is operated by the observer, and the image on the surface of the object to be measured 104 is captured into the process apparatus 101 as electronic data (multicolor pattern image) . The object to be measured 104 has a multicolor pattern, i.e., a pattern formed by distribution of amorphous coloring particles, on its surface. Therefore, there are speckles on the multicolor pattern image (electronic data) captured into the process apparatus 101, as described above. The multicolor pattern image captured into the process<br>
apparatus 101 is a picture image which is applied to the surface of a building, etc. In the present invention, objects with patterns such as flow marks formed on their surfaces are not used as objects to be measured. Moreover, material data which are already in the form of electronic data can be obtained via the internet or other communication lines and used.<br>
Herein, the format of the electronic image data is not particularly limited, but a data format in the sRGB (standard RGB) space is preferable. sRGB is an international standard of color space developed by IEC (International Electrotechnical Commision) in October, 1998, and is an established machine-independent system of representing colors. Electronic image data may be converted from the sRGB format to the Lab format, which is a representing system closer to the impression perceived by the human eye, and explanation of the conversion method is omitted since it is already known (actually, it is converted from the sRGB format to the XYZ format, and is converted from the XYZ format to the Lab format) . The sRGB color space can represent a narrower range of colors than other color spaces and representing emerald green, dark cyan, orange, bright red, yellow, etc., appropriately is difficult for it. However, this does not cause a problem in the field of coating compositions for interior and exterior work of buildings because such colors having high chroma are not used.<br>
In step S2, the visual information of the coloring particles and the visual information of the base material of the coating composition for forming a multicolor pattern are determined. More specifically, the observer operates the operation means of the process apparatus 101, and the colors of the coloring particles and of the base material for reproducing the speckles of each color on the multicolor pattern image (electronic data) by painting are determined in the following manner:<br>
Firstly, the process apparatus 101 shows the multicolor pattern image obtained in step SI on the display apparatus 102 as a color image and accepts the operation of the operation unit.<br>
The size and shape of the shown multicolor pattern image is optional (for example, a square having 256 pixels per side). Secondly, when the observer operates the operation means (for example, push a button of a mouse for computers) and specifies a certain position on the multicolor pattern image shown, the process apparatus 101 determines a certain region centered around the specif led position, averages the visual information, that is, the RGB values of all pixels in the region, converts the value to an XYZ value assuming that the obtained average value is a sRGB value, and further converts to a Lab value. Finally, the process apparatus 101 uses the obtained Lab value and the visual information, that is, the color data of a plurality of color chips recorded in the recording unit in advance to detemine the color chip which is closest to the obtained Lab value, that is, the color chip which is in the shortest geometrical distance (color difference) AE in the Lab space. The process apparatus 101 repeats these processes each time the observer specifies a certain position. Therefore, if the observer appropriately specifies a pixel in a speckle of certain color on the multicolor pattern image shown on the display apparatus 102, a corresponding color chip is determined for each speckle of a different color. Specifically, the color of the coloring particles and the color of the base material of the coating composition for reproducing speckles are determined. Normally, three to four colors are determined from a single image including the base material. To specifically describe step S3 and the following processes, Herein, it is assumed that one color for the base material, three colors for the coloring particles corresponding to speckles of four types of colors and the color chips of four colors are determined (color chip 0 corresponds to the material, color chips 1 to 3 correspond to the coloring particles).<br>
An example of the certain region in which the average value of the RGB values is determined is shown in a square in Fig. 2 (a) . As the predetermined region, a small square region having 10 to 20 pixels on one side is normally used, but it may be any<br>
region which is nearly contained in one speckle on the multicolor pattern image region. For example, in case of a square, it may have 8 to 256 pixels on one side. Moreover, toCIEXYZ, which is known as a standard function of JAVA (registered trademark) language, can be used for converting color formats. Alternatively, functions published on the internet<br>
(http://www005.upp.so-net.ne.jp/fumoto/linkp25.htm) can be also used.<br>
Standard Paint Colors published by Japan Paint Manufacturers Association and other references can be used as the color chips. DIG color guide, Munsel color system and other references may be also use. Since the color chart of Japan Paint Manufacturers Association is the color samples when the coating compositions are used, its color chips are particularly preferable.<br>
Moreover, as for the color space (colorimetric system), the one which is close to visual sensation is the Lab format mentioned above, but it is not limited to this system and the RGB, Lab, HSI and other formats may be also used.<br>
The case where the position for determining the representative colors is specified by the observer visually is described above, but as shown in Fig. 2 (b) , it is also possible to analyze RGB, HSI, etc. of all pixels of the multicolor pattern image, and carry out a color reduction process (process of reducing the number of gradations) by image processing to extract the representative colors. Moreover, instead of selecing the colors of the coloring particles from the image, setting the color of the base material and multiple colors of the coloring particles as standard colors in advance, and retrieving approximate colors from all pixels of the image to determine the color of the base material and the colors of the coloring particle are also possible.<br>
The formulation ratio of the coloring materials can be calculated by using CCM employing the KS theory of Kubelka-Munk from the actual measurement of the reflectance of the color<br>
chips of the determined color chart numbers and the KS values of the coloring materials. A method of determining the formulation ratio from the multicolor pattern image data, not by a known CCM, will be described in detail below.<br>
Secondly, in step S3, the process apparatus 101 determines the representative colors of the speckles, that is, the area ratio of the representative colors of the coloring particles. More specifically, firstly, "0" is set to variables Nj (j=l to 3) representing the numbers of the coloring particles approximate to the representative colors, i.e., the color chips j (j=l to 3) as initial values. One pixel of the multicolor pattern image is then selected, and the RGB value of each pixel is converted to Lab. The color difference AE between the obtained Lab and the Lab value of each of the color chips j determined in step S2 is calculated. A color chip j having the smallest color difference AE among the plurality of color chips j (j=l to 3) is determined, and one is added to the variable Nj of the color chip j to give a new variable Nj. If these processes are carried out for every pixel of the multicolor pattern image, the variables Nj (j=l to 3) become the numbers of pixels having a color approximate to the representative colors of each of the coloring particles. Its ratio (Nj/Nall) to the number of all pixture elements Nail is calculated, and the area ratio of the speckles (coloring particles) in the image is determined. This area ratio (Nj/Nall) is the formulation information (formulation ratio) of each of the coloring particles for the coating compositions for forming a multicolor pattern. Assuming that the particle distribution and specific gravity of the coloring particles are the same for all colors, the area ratio becomes proportional to the number of the coloring particles.<br>
In the above, the area ratio is determined by using the color chip with the smallest color difference AE, but another possible method is determining the color difference AE between each pixel of the multicolor pattern image and the color chips and "weighting" this difference to determine the area ratio.<br>
A possible method of "weighting" comprises calculating the color difference AE between the Lab of the color chip determined in the Lab color space and the Lab of each pixel, summing the number of the pixels in which AE is up to a predetermined value, for example, AE&gt;3, and determining the formulation information (formulation ratio) of each of the coloring particles from the summed value. This method can determine the colors of the image as the formulation of the coating compositions to match the visual impression more closely.<br>
Another possbile method of "weighting" comprises multipying the color difference AE of the pixels having the color difference AE determined in a manner similar to that mentioned above is up to the predetermined value by a contributing coefficient depending on AE, summing the obtained values, and determining the formulation information (compounding ratio) of each of the coloring particles from the summed value. For example, if AEl, the contributing coef ficient=l, if AE=1 to 3, the contributing coef ficient=0. 8, and if AE&gt;3, the contributing coefficient=0.2. The colors of the image can be determined as the formulation of coating compositions to match the visual impression more closely also by this method.<br>
As a result of the processes in the above steps SI to S3, the color chips of the base material and the coloring particles and the area ratios of the coloring particles are now determined. In the steps shown below, a multicolor paint is produced by using these information obtained, and evaluation by simulation if a desired multicolor pattern is obtained or not is conducted when it is applied on the base material.<br>
In step S4, the conditions for the simulation are specified. For example, the color of the base material, the colors of the coloring particles, the ratio by weight of a vehicle to the coloring particles, the amount of the coloring particles and the size of the coloring particles are input in the process apparatus 101 via the operation means by the<br>
observer, considering the results of steps SI to S3. Fig. 6 shows an example of input screens. In Fig. 6, the base material is bg and the coloring particles of three colors are cl to c3. The colors of the coloring particles are input in the RGB values, that is, 8-bit (0 to 255) Red, Green, Blue values. The ratio by weight of the vehicle (material serving as a "paste") component to the coloring particles is specified in the range of vehicle /coloring particles =60/40 to 70/30, and is normally 65/35. In actual coating compositions, the overall amount of the coloring particles is defined in terms of appearance and performance of coated films, and therefore the amount of the coloring particles Haigo is specified by the formulation percentage (%) relative to the total amount. The size Dia of the coloring particles is specified to 10.0 (pixel) for all three colors. Since the coloring particles completely cover the base material and other coloring particles overlapping one another, the haze of the coating compositions are specified to 100 (%) .<br>
The colors of the coloring particles may be directly input in the RGB values as mentioned above, or they may be input in color chip numbers . In Fig. 6, the color chip numbers (C15-75B, C25-90A, etc.) of Standard Paint Colors published by Japan Paint Manufacturers Association are shown on the column of the color. Specifically, when color chip numbers are specified, corresponding Red, Green, Blue can be automatically set.<br>
In step S5, the process apparatus 101 renders the noises of the colors of the coloring particles by using the information input in step S4 . Herein, in correspondence to the results of steps SI to S3, in step S4, it is assumed that vehicle/coloring particle =65/35, the colors of the coloring particles are RGB values of the three colors of brown, white, gray, and the amounts (formulation ratio) of the colors input are brown/white/gray =12/26/62. The ratio of brown/white/gray =12/26/62 is close to that of the numbers of the coloring particles determined in step S3, Nj (j = l to 3) , and is the combination of positive real values which make one hundred in total. Therefore, the values<br>
are not limited to the positive integer values shown here as examples, and may be values including decimals.<br>
A photograph of a actual coloring particle is shown in Fig. 7. This is a coloring particle which is prepared by adding sodium alginate to a coloring coating composition of an aqueous reaction curable acrylic resin-based coating composition (white) prepared to develop an optional color by using a coloring pigment paste, and adding this mixture dropwise to an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide, stirring and filtrating the mixture. Since it is such a particle, it covers the base (the surface of the base material) . As can be seen from Fig. 7, the coloring particles are amorphous particles, and their sizes are not constant and the distribution of the sizes is wide. Fig. 8 is a graph showing the particle size distribution obtained by measuring the partcile size of an actual coloring particle. From the measurement results shown in Fig. 8, the coloring particles having diameters of 0.2 mm or smaller which cannot be visually recognized as particles are rendered as noises on the base material. This advantageously accelerates CG rendering process and makes the appearance of the image closer to an actual coated film.<br>
With reference to Fig. 9, the process of rendering the noises will be specifically described. Firstly, as shown in Fig. 9(a), the process apparatus 101 renders the color of the base material in a predetermined size. Secondly, the process apparatus 101 selects one color (color chip j) of the coloring particles from three colors, and determines the RGB value for rendering. Thirdly, the process apparatus 101 selects a pixel randomly on the image of the color of the base material, and repeats a process of setting the RGB value of the color chip j to the selected pixel the number of times equal to the number of the coloring particles in the image. For example, in case of an image sized 512 pixels  512 pixels, As for the coloring particle of brown, 512 (vertical pixels) 512 (horizontal pixels) xQ.35 (ratio of the total number of coloring particles to the total pixels) 0.12 (ratio of the amounts of the coloring<br>
particles to the total amount of the coloring particles) =11010<br>
pixels   are  randomly   rendered.     Similarly,   23855<br>
(=512x512x0.35x0.26)   of   white   noises   and   56885<br>
(=512512x0.35xQ.62) gray noises are randomly rendered.  Fig.<br>
9 (b) is an image of noises of coloring particles rendered in<br>
a single color.<br>
Originally, on the speckles having diameters of 0.2 mm or smaller should be rendered as noises as shown in Fig. 8. However, as described later, the speckles having diameters greater than 0.2 mm are rendered as polygons (color filling). Therefore, the areas of the actually rendered speckles become smaller than in the case where circles (color filling) are rendered, and thus as many noises as the total number of the particles of the coloring particles are rendered to compensate the difference. In an experiment, as for a coloring particle of one color, the "area rendered by noises" was determined so that<br>
area rendered by circles = area rendered by polygons + area rendered by noises. As a result, as mentioned above, it was found that<br>
number of rendered noises = the total pixels of the entire image  ratio of the total number of coloring particles to the total pixels  ratio of the total amount of the coloring particles to the total amount of the coloring particles is desirable.<br>
Since a plurality of the coloring particles are used (three colors: brown, white, gray herein), the noises of the coloring particles are rendered in the increasing order of their formulation amount so that the noises of the coloring particles of colors with large formulation amounts are not covered, whereby an image with of an impression close to an actual coated film can be obtained. Therefore, the noises are rendered desirably in the order of brown, white and gray herein.<br>
Next in step S6, the process apparatus 101 determines conditions for rendering the coloring particles having diameters of 0.2 mm or greater by CG from the information input<br>
in step S4. In generation of the CG image in step S7 described later, the coloring particles of a plurality of colors are simultaneously rendered using multithread by JAVA (registered trademark) language. Specifically, a rendering method using JAVA (registered trademark) multithread which is a known technique (refer to pages 97 to 109 of "Java Kanzen Master Book ( "Java Complete Master Book)" (auther: Miki Takada, published by Gijutsu Hyoronsha, May, 2004)) is employed. This technique creates a rendering process corresponding to spray painting carried out with a single paint gun as a thread which is a unit of computer programs, and as many threads as the number of guns are prepared, and rendering is carried out while the plurality of threads are simultaneously carried out. The actual multicolor paint is one type of coating composition whih is a mixture of coloring particles of a plurality of colors, in this simulation, a CG image is generated by simulating painting with a plurality of guns.<br>
The rendering conditions are the number of used threads (corresponding to the number of coating compositions or colors) , colors (RGB values) of the coating compositions of each thread, waiting time ST of each thread and the particle size distribution of rendered particles of each thread. As the number of threads and the colors of the coating compositions of each thread, the data input in step S4 are used as they are. The waiting time ST is calculated from the ratio by weight of the vehicle to the coloring particles and the amount of the coloring particles which are input in step S4, as shown below. Moreover, log-normal distribution is used for the particle size distribution of the rendered particles.<br>
Firstly, the area ratio (%) of the coloring particles of each thread is determined from the ratio by weight of the vehicle to the coloring particles input in step S4 and the amount of the coloring particles (formulation ratio) . For example, when the ratio of vehicle/coloring particles =65/35, brown/white/gray =12/26/62, and the coloring particles are oriented on the surface without overlapping, the ratio of the<br>
area of the coloring particles of the gray color to the area of the entire image is thought to be 0.350.62=0.217 (21.7%). However, the coloring particles actually overlap each other. Moreover, since minute particles (grain size: 0 . 2 mm or smaller) have been already rendered as noises as mentioned above, the area ratio rendered in later processes needs to be less than 21.7%. From the measurement results of the actual coated film, it was found that the value obtained by mutiplying the area assumed from the formulation specified in step S4 by 0.6 is desirably used as the area ratio.<br>
Therefore, for example, the ratio of the area of the gray coloring particles to the area of the entire color image is 0.35x0.62x0.6=0.1302 (13.02%). Similarly, the ratios of the areas of the brown and white coloring particles to the area of the entire image are 0.0252 (=0.35x0.12x0.6) (2.52%) and 0.35x0.26x0.6=0.0546 (5.46%), respectively.<br>
Secondly, the waiting time ST of each thread is calculated from the area ratio (%) of the coloring particles. The waiting time ST is a time from when one thread renders a polygon (generation of polygons will be described later) whose inner area is filled with one color until it renders the next polygon, and it is normally specified in msec (millisecond). The shorter the waiting time ST, the more the number of polygons rendered per unit time and the more dense the rendered coloring particle image. In contrast, the longer the waiting time ST, the coarser the rendered coloring particle image. More specifically, equation 1 is determined in advance as the regression equation, and the waiting time ST is determined by using this.<br>
y=axb   (equation 1)<br>
Herein, x is the area ratio (%) of the coloring particles, and y is the waiting time ST (msec).<br>
Moreover, the regression coefficients a, b of equation 1 are determined to have one of three models, small, medium, large, in advance, depending on the size of the coloring particles. Small: the case where the partcile size (pixel) 
particle diameter (mm) 0.5, and the equation determined with<br>
the partcile size of 5 pixels is used.<br>
Medium: the case where 7<particle size></particle>
particle diameter (mm) 
the particle size of 10 pixels is used.<br>
Large: the case where particle size (pixel) &gt;15, 1.5<average></average>
particle diameter (mm) 3, and the equation determined with the<br>
particle size of 20 pixels is used.<br>
Fig. 10 is a graph showing the relationship between the area ratio x obtained by rendering polygons (generation of polygons will be described later) having the size of 10 pixels (D=10) for 60 seconds and the waiting time ST (in case of the "medium" model). From the graph in Fig. 10, the regression equation y=e4'41&gt;x~1'01, wherein the regression coefficients are a=4.41, b=-1.01, is obtained. This equation has a correlation coefficient of as high as R2=0.996, which shows strong correlation. This indicates a high reproducibility in the regression equation of equation 1.<br>
Subsequently, log-normal distribution is determined as the particle size distribution of the rendered particles . When polygon regions are repeatedly rendered by CG, for example, when polygons having the size of the coloring particles specified in step S4 are rendered, if rendering is conducted with a distribution close to the particle size distribution of the actual painting while a distance R between the center and vertex of the polygon is appropriately changed, the rendered image becomes similar to the actual multicolor pattern. As a result of studying various particle size distributions, log-normal distribution was found to have the distribution closest to the actual coated plate. To realize the log-normal distribution in the CG image, the shape of a polygon rendered in the following procedure can be determined.<br>
First, using a known algorithm (algorithm generating normal distribution described on pp.152 to 153 of "JAVA ni yoru algorithm jiten (Dictionary of JAVA algorithms)" (author: Haruhiko Okumura et al., Gijustu Hyoronsha, May, 2003)), a<br>
variable f which normally distributes (average value =0, standard deviation =1) is generated. As in the following equation 2, exp (f) using the variable as an exponent is calculated, and this is multiplied by exp (0.5). This is further multiplied by the size of the coloring particles Dia specified in step S4 to produce the particle size distribution which log-normally distributes, i.e., the size g of the particles which are variables which log-normally distributes. g=Diaexp (f) /exp (0.5) (equation 2)<br>
Further, the distance R between the center and vertex of the polygon rendered is determined by the following equation 3 with the size g of the particles generated by equation 2. R=0.5g (equation 3)<br>
Herein, there is a relationship represented by the following equation 4 between the normal distribution and log-normal distribution of the average value y=0 and standard deviation a=l, and the coefficient exp (0.5) is a coefficient for adjusting the average value of the log-normal distribution to 0.<br>
The expected value of the log-normal distribution=exp (u+a2/2) =exp (0+1/2) =exp (0.5) =1.64872   (equation 4)<br>
In step S7, CG rendering is carried out by using the parameters determined by the calculations above (the number of threads, the colors of the coating compositions of each thread, waiting time ST of each thread, the particle size distribution of rendered particles of each thread). Specifically, multithread is started, each thread (corresponding to each coloring particle) generates the number n of the vertex (n is a natural number of three or more) and the position coordinates of the center of the polygon in every waiting time ST, the distance R which log-normally distributes is generated n times using equation 2 and equation 3, and the pixel data in n polygons in which the distance between the center and vertex is R are overwritten with the RGB value of the coating compositions of each thread.<br>
Referring to Fig. 11, rendering of polygons will be<br>
described in detail. The actual coloring particles are amorphous, and may be also deformed in the formation of the coated film after being applied. Accordingly, amorphous polygons are rendered in a multicolor pattern coating film. Polygons are thus rendered in this step S7. Specifically, the coordinates of the center of each rendered polygon is generated by an uniform random function, and an n-agonal polygon having a random shape is generated at a probability specified for each n-agonal shape. For example, triangles (n=3) are generated at a probability of 1/3, squares (n=4) at a probability of 1/3, and pentagons (n=5) at a probability of 1/3 (refer to Fig. 11 (a)). Once the number n of the vertexes of the polygon is determined, the distance R which log-normally distributes is generated n times using equations 2 and equation 3. In Fig. 11 (b), n=4, and the distance R between the center 0 to each vertex of the square is represented by LI to L4. A position coordinate which is in a distance of R from the center is determined, and the RGB value of the coating compositions of each thread is set to pixels positioned inside the n-agonal shape having vertexes at the determined n positions. Fig. 11 (c) is an image of a multicolor pattern generated in such a manner. Herein, the position of the vertexes of the n-agonal shape is optionally determined only by specifying the distance R from the center, and therefore the rendered polygon is not necessarily a convex polygon. Therefore, there can be concave polygons and polygons with their sides crossing each other. For this reason, the inside of the n-agonal shape refers to a region surrounded by at least three sides.<br>
The rendering process is carried out sequentially in such a manner, and the data on a video memory is shown on the display apparatus 102 as a CG image. When a command to stop rendering is input at an optional timing, the process apparatus 101 stops excution of the threads, and a still image at that point is shown on the image display apparatus 102 as a multicolor pattern. Stop of rendering may be orderd by, for example, the operation of the operation means by the observer, and rendering may be<br>
conducted while the time from the start of rendering is recorded so that it automatically stops after a preset time has elapsed.<br>
In step S8, the design of the multicolor pattern of the CG image rendered in step S7 and shown on the display apparatus 102 is judged by the observer visually whether it is close to his/her impression. If it is close to the impression of the observer, the process apparatus 101 stops the simulation by the CG mentioned above in response to the operation of the observer, records the rendering parameters which have been last used in the recording unit, and proceeds to step S9. If the observer does not approve, the process apparatus 101 receives a direction, and returns to step S4 to carry out .the simulation again. At this time, the observer may compare the CG image with the object to be measured 104 itself or the multicolor pattern image on the surface of the object to be measured 104 captured in step SI to evaluate the design of the multicolor pattern of the CG image shown on the display apparatus 102.<br>
A multicolor paint is produced by a series of processes described above based on the color of the base material, the colors and the formulation ratio of the coloring particles, and a multicolor pattern coating film obtained by applying the paint can be predicted with a CG image.<br>
(Second embodiment)<br>
A method of determining formulation information of a multicolor paint and visual information of a base material according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be now described. The constitution of the computer system used is the same as in Fig. 1. Moreover, the flowchart showing the outline of the process in the second embodiment is the same as in Fig. 5, and the same processes as in the first embodiment are included. Specifically, the processes of steps SI to S5 in the second embodiment are the same as in the first embodiment described above. Therefore, their explanation is omitted herein, and step S6 and the following processes which are different from the first embodiment are described.<br>
In the second embodiment, in step S6, the process<br>
apparatus 101 determines the conditions for rendering figures representing the coloring particles having diameters greater than 0.2 mm by CG from the information input in step S4. In generating the CG image in step S7 described later, random numbers are used for rendering the figures representing the coloring particles at a frequency depending on the ratio of the number of the coloring particles.<br>
The rendering conditions are the correspondence of (i) the colors of the coloring particles (rendered colores), (ii) the particle size distribution of the coloring particles of each color (determined depening on the particle size of the coloring particles) and(iii) a random number generated (details described later), with the colors of the coloring particles. Among these conditions, the colors of the coloring particles and the particle sizes of the coloring particles used are the values input in step S4 as they are. The correspondence of the random numbers with the colors of the coloring particles is calculated using the ratio by weight of the vehicle to the coloring particles and the amount of the coloring particles (formulation ratio) input in step S4 as described later. Moreover, log-normal distribution is used for the particle size distribution of the rendered particles.<br>
Fig. 12 is a flowchart showing a process in step S6. Firstly, in step S61, the number NT of all types of the coloring particles rendered is determined by equation 5. NT=pixels of the entire image  the ratio of the coloring particles  performance  coefficient    (equation 5) Herein, the number of the coloring particles is not that of the pixels but that of the rendered figures.  The ratio of the coloring particles is the ratio by weight of the coloring particles to the vehicle input in step S4.<br>
The reason why "performance" is introduced in equation 5 is because in actual painting, the coloring particles are distributed inside a coated film and all coloring particles are not positioned on the surface position (refer to the multicolor pattern coating film in Fig. 4), and minute particles (grain<br>
size: 0.2 mm or smaller) cannot be recognized as coloring particles by the eye. The minute particles (grain size: 0.2 mm or smaller) have been already rendered as noises in step S5. From experiment results, it was found that performance =0.6 is desirable.<br>
Moreover, the "coefficient" is a parameter for adjusting a difference between the image of the rendered multicolor pattern and the actual coated plate. As a result of visual comparision of the images and the actual coated plates obtained by redering numerous designs, it was found that the coefficient =0.4 is desirable.<br>
For example, in case of the ratio by weight of the coloring particles to the vehicle=0.35 (vehicle /coloring particle = 65/35) and the image of a square having 512 pixels on one side is rendered, NT=512x512xQ.35x0.6x0.422020.<br>
In step S62, it is judged whether or not the particle sizes of each coloring particles Dia which are set in step S4 are identical, and if they all have the identical value, the process proceeds to step S63, but if any one of them differs from the others, the process proceeds to step S64.<br>
When the particle sizes of the coloring particles are identical regardless of colors, the ratio of the number of the coloring particles (ratio to the total number NT of the rendered figure) is equal to the area ratio. Therefore, in step S63, the formulation ratio of the corresponding coloring particle is set to the ratio of the number of the coloring particles.<br>
When the particle sizes of the coloring particles differ depending on the color, in step S63, the ratio of the number of the coloring particles is determined depending on the area ratio of a single coloring particle. The categories of the sizes of the coloring particles analyzed from the actual coated plates and the images obtained by rendering represented, for example, on a scale of large, medium and small in the unit pixel are found to be approximately the following ranges: Small: particle size 7 (actually, O.laverage particle size (mm) 
Medium:  7<particle size particle></particle>
Large:  particle size &gt;15 (actually, 1. 5<average particle size></average>
Therefore, each average particle size, i.e., average diameter is determined as follows: Small: average diameter =5 Medium:  average diameter =10 Large:  average diameter =15<br>
At this time, the average area ratio of a single coloring particle is small/medium/large=52/102/152=0.25/1/2.25 . Therefore, the formulation ratio ai of the coloring particle of each color is divided by a value pj corresponding to the particle size of these area ratios (ai/(3j), the summation S of the obtained division value is determined, the ratio of each division value to this to the summation S (ai/|3j) /S is determined to use it as the ratio of the number of the coloring particles.<br>
Specific examples include the followings: For example, vehicle /coloring particle =65/35, brown/white/gray =26/12/62. When the particle sizes Dia of the brown, white and gray coloring particles specified in step S4 are the values which are in the categories of medium, small and large, respectively, the division value of the brown coloring particle is 26/1=26. Similarly, the division values of the white and gray coloring particles are 12/0.25=48 and 62/2.2528, respectively. Therefore, the ratio of the number of the brown particle is 26/ (26+48+28) =0.26. Similarly, the ratios of the number of the white and gray particles are 48/(26+48 + 28) 0.47 and 28/(26+48+28) 0.27, respectively. Herein, the rounding process of the calculation results can be suitably carried out.<br>
The number of the categories the size of single particles of the coloring particles are not limited to three as mentioned above (large, medium, small), but may be four or more. Moreover, the criteria for categorizing the particle size are not limited to the above-mentioned values (when categorized into three<br>
groups, 7 and 15 pixels).<br>
Next in step S65, the relationship between the random numbers generated in rendering and the colors of the associated coloring particles (rendering colors) is determined from the ratio of the number of the coloring particles determined in steps S63 or S64. Specifically, the range r min to r max of the random numbers generated depending on the ratio pi of the number of the coloring particles of the color i is proportionally allocated, and the range of the random numbers associated with the rendering colors is determined.<br>
Specific examples include the followings: for example, in the above-mentioned step S63 (the case where the particle sizes are equal), the ratio of the number of the brown, white and gray coloring particles are determined to be 0.26, 0.12 and 0.62, respectively. When uniform random numbers in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 are generated, the range of the random number corresponding to each of the rendering colors can be determined as follows:<br>
Range of random number r for brown: 0.0r0.26<br>
Range of random number r for white: 0.26<r0.38></r0.38>
Range of random number r for gray: 0.38<rl.></rl.>
For example, in above-mentioned step S64 (the case where the particle sizes differ) , the ratios of the number of the brown, white and gray coloring particles are determined to be 0.26, 0.47 and 0.27, respectively. When uniform random numbers in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 are generated, the range of the random numbers associated with the rendering colors can be determined as follows:<br>
Range of random number r for brown: 0.0<r0.26></r0.26>
Range of random number r for white: 0.26<r></r>
Range of random number r for gray: 0.73<rl.o></rl.o>
The ranges of the random numbers associated with the<br>
rendering colors may be any ranges as long as it is proportionally allocated depending on the number ratio, and may be ranges other than those mentioned above. For example, in the example of step S63 mentioned above, a range containing the lower limit value 0.0 of the random numbers is associated with white and determined as follows:<br>
Range of random number r for white: 0.0r
Range of random number r for gray: 0.38<r or may be determined as follows:></r>
Range of random number r for white: 0.0r
Range of random number r for brown: 0.74<rl.o></rl.o>
Furthermore, the range of the random number r associated with each of the rendering colors is not necessarily a continuous region.<br>
Range of random number r for brown: O.OrO.10<br>
Range of random number r for white: 0.10<r0.22></r0.22>
Range of random number r for brown: 0.22<r0.38></r0.38>
Range of random number r for gray: 0.38<rl.o></rl.o>
The log-normal distribution used as the particle size distribution of the rendered particles is the same as in the first embodiment, and therefore its explanation is omitted.<br>
In step S7, CG rendering is carried out by using the parameters determined by the calculations above (the colors used for rendering the coloring particles, the particle size distribution of the colors of the coloring particles, correspondence between random numbers generated and the rendering colors). Specifically,<br>
(A) uniform random numbers are generated in the range of 0.0 to 1.0,<br>
(B)	rendering colors (RGB value) are determined according to<br>
the correspondence between the generated random numbers r and<br>
the rendering colors (determined in step 6 mentioned above),<br>
(C)	the number n of the vertexes (n is a natural number of 3<br>
or more) and the position coordinates of the center of the<br>
polygon are generated,<br>
(D)	the distance R which is log-normally distributed is<br>
generated n times by equation 2 and equation 3 by using the<br>
particle size Dia corresponding to the rendering colors<br>
determined in (B), and<br>
(E)	a point randomly determined on the image region is used<br>
as the center to overwrite the data of the pixels in the n-agonal<br>
polygon in which the distance from the center to the vertexes<br>
is R with the rendering colors determined in (D).<br>
A series of these processes (A) to (E) are repeated the number of times equal to the total number'NT of the rendered coloring particles (NT times).<br>
Herein, the centeral position of the polygon determined in (E) may be determined by generating uniform random numbers in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. For example, in case of the image of a square having 512 pixels on one side, an interger value which is not greater than rl&gt;
Redering of polygons is the same as in the first embodiment, and therefore the explanation is omitted.<br>
In step S8, the design of the multicolor pattern of the CG image rendered in step S7 and shown on the display apparatus 102 is judged by the observer visually whether it is close to his/her impression. If the CG image is close to the impression of the observer, the process apparatus 101 stops the simulation by the CG mentioned above in response to the operation of the observer, records the rendering parameters which have been last used in the recording unit and proceeds to step S9. If the<br>
observer does not approve, the process apparatus 101 receives a direction, and returns to step S4 to carry out the simulation again. At this time, the observer can compare the CG image with the object to be measured 104 itself or the multicolor pattern  image on the surface of the object to be measured 104 captured in step SI to evaluate the design of the multicolor pattern of the CG image shown on the display apparatus 102.<br>
By the series of processes described above, a multicolor paint is produced based on the color of the base material, the<br>
colors and the formulation ratio of the coloring particles, and a multicolor pattern coating film obtained by applying the paint can be predicted with a CG image.<br>
Although the first and second embodiments of the present invention are described above, the present invention is not<br>
  limited to the above-mentioned embodiments.<br>
For example, in the case described in the above, the observer considers the results in step S3 and inputs the corresponding simulation conditions (the color of the base material, the colors of the coloring particles, the ratio by<br>
weight of the vehicle to the coloring particles, the amount of the coloring particles, and the size of the coloring particles) in step S4 after the visual information of the speckles of the multicolor pattern is determined. But these conditions can be automatically determined. The CG image may be rendered by using<br>
the automatically determined simulation conditions and evaluated by the observer, and therefore part of the simulation conditions may be slightly changed, if necessary, to repeat the rendering process of the CG image again.<br>
Another possible idea is to determine more than one type<br>
of multicolor patterns as standard pattern color samples (hereinafter referred to as standard colors) and market a coating composition for forming multicolor patterns which can reproduce those samples (coating composition mixture). Furthermore, preparing a coating composition for forming an<br>
original multicolor pattern by fine-tuning each of the colors and mixing ratio of the coloring particles in those standard<br>
colors are also possible. If the present invention is applied to such cases, coating compositions for forming original multicolor patterns can be readily simulated.<br>
Moreover, even when there is no dissatisfaction with  patterns of the standard colors, formulation of a coating composition which can reproduce multicolor patterns of hues different from standard colors (for example, in a multicolor pattern of granite including white, black and pink, pink is replaced with blue and white and black are inverted) can be<br>
10  readily determined by applying the present invention.<br>
When such customizing is carried out, the conditions for simulation of multicolor patterns can be changed in a wide variety. However, simulation conditions are desirably limited within the range which can be actually reproduced with coating<br>
compositions. Moreover, the simulation conditions may be limited to avoid generating CG images with unnatural color harmonization. For this purpose, for example, the number of the colors of the coloring particles, the colors of the coloring particles, the number of the coloring particles and other<br>
20  variable amount can be limited to certain appropriate ranges.<br>
Moreover, as the images which serve as originals, not only<br>
multicolor pattern images but also any images desired by users<br>
(landscape photographs, photogravures, abstract paintings,<br>
etc.) can be used.  For example, the present invention can be<br>
applied to an image obtained by subjecting a given image to image processing, and a plurality of colors (coating compositions) and their formulation can be determined.<br>
Moreover, the present invnetion can be applied to such cases of imparting interior finishing of multicolor patterns<br>
to the interior of buildings (specific rooms in a restaurant, hotel, office, etc.). In such a case, processes similar to steps S5 to s7 mentioned above can be carried out on a certain wall surface determined depending on the three-dimensional structural data of a target, whereby a three-dimensional CG<br>
35 image with the caretain wall surface decorated with a multicolor pattern can be generated. Moreover, an image of a<br>
two-dimensional multicolor pattern, which is produced in advance by steps S5 to S7 mentioned above, may be mapped on the certain wall surface so that a three-dimensional CG image is produced. [Example 1]<br>
Examples are shown below to describe the features of the present invention more clearly. Herein, Examples of the method of determining formulation information of a multicolor paint and visual information of a base material according to the first embodiment will be described.<br>
Three types of coloring particles were produced. These coloring particles were used to prepare six types of coating compositions for forming multicolor patterns.

(Table Remove (7) Preparation of coloring particle (brown C15-75B) A stainless steel container having a capacity of 4 liters was loaded with 1300 parts of a 0.15% aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide (an aqueous solution of 0.15 g of calcium hydroxide dissolved in 100 g of deionized water at 25°C) . 650 parts of the aqueous liquid composition (brown C15-75B) mentioned above was gradually added dropwise into the container with stirring<br>
using an agitating blade having a diameter of 75 mm at a rotation speed of 2500 rpm, producing a coloring particle. The liquid in the container was stirred for 15 minutes with stirring maintained, and then the liquid was filtrated using a wire net of 200 mesh, obtaining a coloring particle (brown C15-75B).<br>

EP Sealer Clear (trade name, manufactured by Kansai Paint Co., Ltd., a water-based acryl emulsion -based sealer) was applied on a slate plate (150x70x3mm) in a coating amount of 100 g/m2 with a roller. The coated plate was left to dry for one day, and then Vinydeluxe 300 white (trade name, manufactured by Kansai Paint Co., Ltd., an acrylic emulsion -based coating composition compliant with JIS K 56631) was further applied on the plate in a coating amount of 100 g/m2 with a roller.

The coated plates were dried for 7 days under the conditions of a temperature of 23°C and a relative humidity of 60%, giving coated plates with a multicolor pattern coating film.<br>
(12)	Evaluation  of  the  reproducibilities  of  the<br>
multicolor pattern coating films by CG imaging<br>
The multicolor pattern coating films on the surface of the 6 produced coated plates were captured by an image scanner to obtain 6 image data. The processes of the step S2 to S5 as mentioned above were carried out to determine the color chips of the base material and the area ratios of the coloring particles. The process of step S6 was carried out to determine the waiting time and particle size distribution of each thread. The process of step S7 using multithread was then carried out to generate 6 types of CG images of the multicolor pattern coating films.<br>
After these processes, evaluation of the CG images produced contemplating the case where the CG images were observed from a distance with which the pattern was not recognized (when the observation distance is long) was carried out. More specifically, regarding the produced CG images and the images generated by capturing the multicolor pattern coating films by an image scanner, the average value of the RGB<br>
values of the central portions of the images (256x256 pixels) was determined, and was converted to Lab by the method mentioned above to determine a color difference AE. As a result, as shown in Table 8, the color difference AE was in the range of 1.3 to 3.2, which was sufficient as the concordance for the case where the observation distance is long.<br>
Subsequently, the variance described on page 709 of "Shinpen Image Processing Handbook (Handbook of Image Processing New Edition) , published by University of Tokyo Press, September, 2004" was used to evaluate the patterns. More specifically, each of the color images was converted to a 256 gray scale image, and the dispersion of gray levels (0 to 255) for all pixels (512x512=262144 (pixels)) was calculated. The results are shown in Table 8. The dispersion values var-img of the image captured with an image scanner, and the dispersion values var-sim of the generated CG image are shown. It was confirmed from these values that the correlation coefficient was as high as 0.983.<br>
[Table 8]<br><br>
(Table Remove Finally, visual evaluation was carried out. Six images capture by an image scanner and six CG images were printed with the identical ink jet printer on matte papers. The concordance of the two corresponding images was visually evaluated by five building exterior designers. The results of the evaluation carried out on a scale of the following three levels are shown on the rightmost column of Table 8. Excellent: The design of the original is generally reproduced.<br>
Fair: Either of the colors or the pattern is not reproduced. Poor: Neither the colors nor the pattern is reproduced.<br>
These results show that the generated CG images were able to reproduce the actual multicolor pattern coating film well. 5  [Example 2]<br>

10 capturing the six coated plates with a multicolor pattern coating film prepared in Example 1 by an image scanner were used. The processes of steps S2 to S5 were carried out on these six image data to determine the color chips and area ratio of the base material and the coloring particles, the correspondence<br>
15 between the random numbers and rendering colors according to the flowchart of Fig. 12 were determined, and then the process of step S7 for determining the rendering colors was carried out by generating random numbers and using this correspondence to generate CG images of the multicolor pattern coating films of<br>
20  six types.<br>
As in Example 1, evaluation of the CG images produced contemplating the case where the CG images were observed from a distance with which the pattern was not recognized (when the observation distance is long) was carried out. As a result,<br>
25 as shown in Table 9, the color difference AE was in the range of 1.2 to 3.4, which was sufficient as the concordance for the case where the observation distance was long.<br>
Subsequently, as in Example 1, evaluation of the pattern was carried out. The results are shown in Table 9. The<br>
30  meanings of var-img and var-sim in Table 9 are the same in Table 8.  It was confirmed from these values that the correlation coefficient was as high as 0.974. [Table 9]<br>
