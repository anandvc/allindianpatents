				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention refers to a plastic lid for the<br>
closure of a can mace of a metallic sheet and of the<br>
type comprising a tubular body, with the lower edge<br>
affixing or incorporating a bottom wall and with the<br>
upper edge carrying, directly by means of a deformed<br>
portion of the tubular body or by means of an annular<br>
upper wall portion that can take the form of a<br>
structural ring, a seat for the seating and retention<br>
of the press-fittable lid. Particularly, the invention<br>
refers to the provision of a plastic lid for a can of<br>
the type considered above which is used for containing<br>
products of progress ive consumption, such as certain<br>
food products.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Determined products, such as certain food products,<br>
must be submitted to a hermetic storage and provided<br>
with a clear visual indication to the consumer that<br>
the container in vvhich they are presented in the<br>
market has not been violated. Since many of these<br>
products are of progressive consumption, it is<br>
indispensable that after the first opening of the<br>
container, the lid which gives access to the inside of<br>
the can may be rec Losed as many times as necessary<br>
during the progressive consumption of the stored<br>
product, in order to guarantee the hermeticity of the<br>
reclosed can and protect the remaining portion of the<br>
content thereof.<br>
There are well knowr from the prior art the cans with<br>
a press-fit lid, in which the latter is press fitted<br>
in a peripheral structural ring, which is internal to<br>
the upper edge of the body of the can and which is<br>
hermetically double seamed to said upper edge. The<br>
hermeticity of the content is guaranteed in this type<br><br>
of construction by the fitting of the lid in the seat<br>
for the seating and retention thereof, which can be<br>
provided in the structural ring that defines the<br>
annular upper wall of the can, or in the tubular body<br>
of the latter.<br>
In this type of closure, the tamper evident seal,<br>
which also guarantees the tightness, is normally<br>
defined by an aluminum metallic sheet, which is<br>
peripherally double seamed to the upper edge of the<br>
body of the can jointly with the structural ring. This<br>
inner seal is only visible when the lid is removed and<br>
it also requires the use of an instrument for cutting<br>
it peripherally, which invariably leaves cutting edges<br>
close to the upper opening of the can, causing<br>
frequent accidents with wounds in the user's fingers.<br>
Besides the inconveniences mentioned above, these<br>
known press-fit lids require the use of an instrument,<br>
in the form of a lever, for allowing the user to<br>
remove the lid from its seat defined in the structural<br>
ring. It is not possible for the user to remove this<br>
type of lid by using his hands only.<br>
It is also known from the Brazilian patent application<br>
PI 0003727-3 a solution in which the plastic lid<br>
comprises a sealing portion,, which is removably seated<br>
and retained in the seat, and a pair of generally<br>
semi-annular handles disposed around an upper edge of<br>
the sealing portion and having ends incorporated to<br>
the latter. The handles can be medianly displaced,<br>
from an inoperative position, coplanar to said upper<br>
edge, to a raised operative position, after rupturing<br>
the breakable means :hat connect the median regions of<br>
the handles to the scaling portion of the plastic lid.<br>
In this prior art construction, the plastic lid<br>
further incorporates a manually breakable seal strip,<br>
provided around the upper end of the tubular body and<br><br>
presenting a lower portion, which is seated and locked<br>
under the double seam of the annular upper wall, and<br>
an upper portion ccnnected to the handles and to the<br>
sealing portion by breakable connecting means.<br>
While it eliminates the deficiencies of the prior lids<br>
for cans containing products of progressive<br>
consumption, this prior solution of the same applicant<br>
still presents some inconveniences. One of said<br>
inconveniences relates to the questionable reliability<br>
of the retention cf the seal strip, as it can be<br>
removed if carefully forced upwardly, sliding out from<br>
the upper double seem of the can.<br>
Another inconvenience of said prior art lid results<br>
from the fact that the opening thereof, by axially<br>
pulling it by means of the opposite handles, is<br>
abrupt, provoking an undue discharge of the stored<br>
product when the lid is removed.<br>
Two more aspects that can be improved are related to<br>
the facility with which the handles are accessed for<br>
extracting the lid, and to the permanence of the seal<br>
strip around the upper edge of the tubular body of the<br>
can, usually requiring the application of a cutting<br>
instrument for removing it. US3773207 discloses a<br>
container which car be sealingly closed by a lid,<br>
resting in the closed position on a horizontal rim of<br>
the container. The lid comprises a circumferential<br>
score line located - in the closed position - in the<br>
area of the horizontal rim. When the lid is opened and<br>
thereby broken along the score line, both parts of the<br>
id - the radially outer part and the radially inner<br>
part - rest on the horizontal rim, when the container<br>
is closed again. Especially, if the inner part is put<br>
under load, the stability of the construction might be<br>
insufficient. Moreover, the construction does not<br>
allow to increase :he width of the outer part for<br><br>
providing an enlarged resting or support ring to improve the stacking of the<br>
lid/can combination.<br>
WO 0058171 discloses a cover including an assembly of a holder and a cover.<br>
The cover comprising a closing wall having a downward edge which lies so<br>
closely against a holder flange exdending perpendicularly to the casing wall of the<br>
holder, or is so screened by a well portion connected with the holder flange and<br>
extending substantially parallel to the casing wall, that engagement of this<br>
downward edge is not possible, whilst at an engagement position an<br>
engagement lip is connected with the downward edge of the closing wall, which<br>
engagement lip extends from the downward edge, so as to be engageable.<br>
DE 3149633 discloses an apparatus for cold rolling, an associated pair of shape<br>
rolls and a method for their manufacture. The rolling spindles (3,4) of the pair of<br>
shape rolls are synchronised with one another in a fixed manner by gears (2)<br>
and each carries a spindle flange (33, 43) which has a radial keyway and, in the<br>
latter, a synchronising pin (321, 421) engaging with its key-like end. The two<br>
synchronising pins (321, 421) are arranged offset by an angle of 180 DEG and<br>
engage in synchronising holes (320, 420) of the shape rolls (32, 42) held on the<br>
rolling spindles (3, 4) by means of a central chuck. The synchronising hole of the<br>
two shape rolls is normally arranged at the same centre angle to the peripheral<br>
profile.<br>
US 4117946 discloses describes a plastic cap for widemouthed containers. The<br>
plastic cap has a closure wall positionable across a container neck opening, and<br><br>
an integrally formed skirt wall adapted to extend around the container neck.<br>
Projections are formed on the inner surface of the skirt wall and extend laterally<br>
of the skirt toward the neck. Elongated lug-like formations depend from the<br>
closure wall into the neck opening and bias portions of the container neck toward<br>
the skirt-carried projections to clamp neck portions against the projections,<br>
whereby the cap is securely releasably retained on the container neck. In<br>
preferred practice, the skirt-carried projections cooperate with neck-carried<br>
protrusions to provide snap-on, snap-off actions as the cap is pressed onto and<br>
removed from the container ne:k. Another preferred feature is the use of a<br>
specially configured upstanding formation on the top surface of the closure wall<br>
which not only facilitates nesting the container cap with a similarly configured<br>
recess formed in the bottom wall of the container, but also serves to maintain<br>
alignment between the labeled fronts of stacked, displayed containers.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is a generic object of the present invention to provide a reclosable plastic lid<br>
for a can of the type considered herein, wherein the lid is reclosable and which<br>
presents a simple construction and reduced cost, incorporating means for<br>
facilitating the opening thereof and also a reliable seal of prompt visual indication<br>
of violation.<br><br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a plastic lid such as<br>
defined above, which can be safely and easily handled by the consumer.<br>

Description of the Illustrated Embodiments<br>
According to the embodiments illustrated in figures 1-<br>
10, the present lid is applied to a can made of a<br>
metallic sheet, comprising a tubular body 10 with a<br>
lower end 11 affixing a bottom wall 12, and with an<br>
upper end 13 affixing, by double seaming, an annular<br>
upper wall 14, which defines, internally, a seat 15<br>
for the hermetic sealing of the lid 20.<br>
The annular upper wall 14 takes the form of a<br>
structural ring, as Illustrated in figures 4, 5, 9,<br>
and 10.<br>
The construction of the annular upper wall 14 and of<br>
the seat 15 may be achieved by different manners,<br>
provided that it allows a hermetic and safe fitting of<br>
the lid 20 to the upper part of the can. In figures 4,<br>
5, 9 and 10, the construction of the annular upper<br>
wall 14 and of the seat 15 is accomplished as<br>
described and claimed in the Brazilian patent PI<br>
9408643-5 issued to the Same applicant in Brazil and<br>
in other countries (such as, for example in the United<br>
States, US5899352, and in Europe, EP0706486).<br>
Therefore, it is not necessary to include the detailed<br>
description of said prior construction in the present<br>
specification.<br>
According to the invention and as illustrated in the<br>
appended drawings, the lid 20 is preferably<br>
constructed in plastic material, transparent or not,<br>
comprising a sealing portion 21 of adequate<br>
construction, so as to be removably seated and<br>
retained in the seat 15, said sealing portion 21<br>
presenting an upper edge 21b, which in the illustrated<br>
embodiment is defined by an outer peripheral flange<br>
21a superiorly incorporated to the sealing portion 21.<br><br>
The lid 20 further comprises, in a single piece with<br>
the sealing portion 21, a seal portion 25 having a<br>
lower skirt 25a, which is generally tightly seated<br>
around a circumferential extension of the upper end 13<br>
of the tubular body L0, and an upper ring 25b seated<br>
onto a circumferential extension of the upper end of<br>
the tubular body 10. The upper ring 25b is<br>
incorporated, externally, to the lower skirt 25a and,<br>
internally and by means of manually breakable radial<br>
bridges 26, to the upper edge 21b of the sealing<br>
portion 21.<br>
According to the present invention, the radial bridges<br>
2 6 are broken when submitted to a certain pulling<br>
force, for separating the seal portion 2 5 from the<br>
sealing portion 21, upon the first opening of the lid<br>
20.<br>
The seal portion 25 presents an interruption 25c, in<br>
its circumferential extension, extending through the<br>
width of the upper ling 25b and through at least part<br>
of the height of the lower skirt 25a, said<br>
interruption 25c defining a certain circumferential<br>
spacing between respective confronting edges of each<br>
of said parts of upper ring 25b and lower skirt 25a in<br>
both sides of the interruption 25c.<br>
According to the present invention, the sealing<br>
portion 21 incorporates a gripping tab 27 projecting<br>
radially outwardly and axially downwardly along said<br>
interruption 25c of the seal portion 25, for example<br>
remaining substantially leveled with the respective<br>
part of said seal portion 25.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in figures 1-5, the<br>
gripping tab 27 projects through the whole<br>
corresponding radial extension of the upper ring 25b<br>
and through part of the axial extension of the lower<br>
skirt 25a and, in the construction illustrated in<br><br>
figures 6-10, the qripping tab 27 occupies the whole<br>
corresponding radia.. extension of the upper ring 25b<br>
and projects axially and inferiorly beyond the axial<br>
extension of the lower skirt 25a.<br>
According to the present invention, the seal portion<br>
25 comprises at least one breakable lock 28 connecting<br>
the gripping tab 2 7 to at least one of the parts<br>
defined by the upper ring 25b and by the lower skirt<br>
25a of the seal portion 25. The gripping tab 27 is<br>
manually operable only when part of the seal portion<br>
25 is ruptured, for example when each breakable lock<br>
28 is broken.<br>
In the construction illustrated in figures 1-5, the<br>
gripping tab 27 is laterally incorporated to the upper<br>
ring 25b by means of a breakable lock 28 in the form<br>
of two or more circumferential bridges, which are<br>
manually broken upon the first opening of the lid 20.<br>
In the construction proposed by the present invention<br>
and illustrated in figures 1-5, the radial bridges 26<br>
and the breakable locks 28 are broken, allowing<br>
separating the sealing portion 21 from the seal<br>
portion 2 5 upon the first opening of the lid by the<br>
user manually raising the gripping tab 27.<br>
In the construction illustrated in figures 6-10, the<br>
lower skirt 25a incorporates the ends of a seal bridge<br>
25d circumferentially extended over the interruption<br>
25c of the seal portion 25 and over the gripping tab<br>
27. The seal bridge 25d presents a first end 25e,<br>
which is incorporated to the lower skirt 25a by<br>
connecting means 25f to be ruptured when said first<br>
end 25e is forced away from the lower skirt 25a, for<br>
example being radially pulled outwardly, so as to<br>
release the manual access to the gripping tab 27. In<br>
the illustrated embodiment, the seal bridge 25d has<br>
its first end 25e disposed over the lower skirt 25a,<br><br>
being incorporated to the latter by two connecting<br>
means 25f circumferentially spaced from each other.<br>
In the construction illustrated in figures 6-10, the<br>
gripping tab 27 is interiorly incorporated to the seal<br>
bridge 25d through a breakable lock 28 in the form of<br>
one or more axial bridges that are manually broken<br>
upon the first opening of the lid.<br>
The provision of the gripping tab 27 allows the<br>
sealing portion 21 to be easily removed from its<br>
seating position in :he sea-; 15 and also a controlled<br>
and progressive opening of the can, first in the<br>
region adjacent to the gripping tab 27 and,<br>
subsequently, in the remaining portion of the seat,<br>
preventing the storec product from being inadvertently<br>
taken out from the can.<br>
According to the present invention, the gripping tab<br>
27 can be massive and at least partially hollow,<br>
defining a handle, as illustrated in figures 6-10.<br>
In the construction illustrated in figures 1-3, and 5,<br>
the gripping tab 27 Ls massive, formed of respective<br>
portions of the upper ring 25b and of the lower skirt<br>
25a, remaining substantially leveled with said parts<br>
of the sealing portion 21 and maintaining from said<br>
parts a gap 29 along the whole extension thereof.<br>
As illustrated in figures 1-3, and 5, the gripping tab<br>
27, is preferably defined in a rupture portion 24 of<br>
the lower skirt 25a that is maintained separated from<br>
the remaining portion of the lower skirt 25a and only<br>
superiorly incorporated to the upper ring 25b. With<br>
this construction, tho rupture portion 24 of the lower<br>
skirt 25a can be a "U" shaped strip, maintaining said<br>
gap 29 around the respective extension of the gripping<br>
tab 27 and separated from the remaining portion of the<br>
lower skirt 25a by a pair of axial cuts 23, which in<br>
the illustrated example extend radially inwardly by a<br><br>
certain extension of the width of the upper ring 25b,<br>
for allowing, after the first opening of the lid, the<br>
seal portion 25 to be ruptured in the region of the<br>
rupture portion 24 and completely and easily separated<br>
from the tubular body 10.<br>
In a constructive form, the upper ring 25b may<br>
incorporate an upper circumferential rib 25g, which is<br>
continuous or definec in segments, projecting over the<br>
upper end 13 of the tubular body 10, in order to fit<br>
loosely and telescopically, and externally or<br>
internally, in the Lower end 11 of another tubular<br>
body 10 stacked over the first one.<br>
In case the upper circumferential rib 25g presents a<br>
diameter smaller thar that of the lower end 11 of the<br>
tubular body 10, it is fitted in a circumferential<br>
recess 12a provided on the bottom wall 12, internally<br>
to the lower end 11 of another tubular body stacked<br>
over the first one.<br>
In the construction of the lid 20, as illustrated in<br>
figures 1-5, the upper edge 21b of the sealing portion<br>
21 is provided in a plane substantially coinciding<br>
with a plane containing the upper ring 25b, the radial<br>
bridges 26 in this construction being provided<br>
substantially horizontal and leveled with said parts.<br>
