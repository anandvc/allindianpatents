CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the priority benefit of US Provisional Application No. 60/068,509, filed October 15,2007, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods for the preparation of fluorinated olefins, and in particular tetrafluorinated propenes. In specific embodiments, the invention concems processes for the preparation of 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene, CF3CF=CH2 (HFO-1234yf).<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's), in particular hydrofluoroakenes (i.e. hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs)) such as tetrafluoropropenes (including 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene (HFO-1234yf)) have been disclosed to be effective refrigerants, fire extinguishants, heat transfer media, propellants, foaming agents, blowing agents, gaseous dielectrics, sterilant carriers, polymerization media, particulate removal fluids, carrier fluids for buffing abrasive agents, displacement drying agents and power cycle working fluids. Unlike chiorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochiorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), both of which potentially damage the Earth's ozone layer, MFCs do not contain chlorine and, thus, pose no threat to the ozone layer.<br>
However, compared to HFCs, HFOs are generally even more ecologically friendly because they generally have a lower Global Warming Potential (GPW).<br>
Several methods for preparing hydrofluoroalkanes are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,900,874 describes a method of making fluorine containing olefins by contacting hydrogen gas with fluorinated alcohols. U.S. Pat. No. 2,931,840 describes a method of making fluorine containing oleflns by pyrolysis of methyl chloride and tetrafluoroethylene or chlorodifluoromethane. The preparation of HFO-1234yf from trifluoroacetylacetone and sulfur tetrafluoride has been described. See Banks, etal.. Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, Vol. 82, Iss. 2, p. 171-174 (1997). Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,594 discloses a process wherein tetrafluoroethylene is reacted with another fluorinated ethylene in the liquid phase to produce a polyfluoroolefin product.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,548,719 describes generally the production of a wide range of fluoroolefins by dehydrohalogenating, in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, a compound of formula CF3C{R^aR\)C(R\R'*d) with at least one alkali metal hydroxide, where the R substituents are as defined in the patent, provided that there is at least one hydrogen and one halogen on adjacent carbon atoms.<br>
The preparation of 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,986,151 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,124,510. These patents disclose processes that comprise catalytic dehydrofluorination of CF3CH2CF2H in<br>
the gas phase to afford CF3CH=CHF. However, each of these methods has the disadvantage of being limited by the requirement of isolating 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane ("245fa") as a starting reactant, which may be undesirable for reasons including cost and material availability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

(b) exposing said compound of formula (IIIA) to reaction conditions effective to convert said compound of formula (IIIA) to a compound of formula (IVA)<br>
CF3CF=CH2    (IVA) wherein X1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, fluorine and iodine, and each X2 is each independently selected from the group consisting of chlorine, bromine, fluorine and iodine.<br>
In certain highly preferred embodiments, the compound of fonnula (I) comprises HF, the compound of formula (II) comprises CCl2=CCICH2CI (HFCO-1230), and the compound of formula (III) comprises CF3CHFCH2F (HFC-245eb).<br>

350 g HF, 50 g CCl2=CCICH2CI, and 75 g SbCI5 were charged into<br>
a 1-L autoclave. The reaction mixture was stirred at 150 °C for 8 h under<br>
910 psig of pressure. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled to room<br>
temperature and 300 ml water was then added slowly into the autoclave<br>
over a period of 45 min. After complete addition of water under stirring, the<br>
reactor was cooled to room temperature and then the overhead gases<br>

Example 4 - Synthesis of CF3CF=CH2 (HFO-1234yf) by Gas-phase reaction of CF3CHFCH2F<br>
1.32 Kg (9.85mol) CF3CHFCH2F (99% pure) is stirred witli 2.5L (10.1mol) of 25% KOH solution in the presence or absence of 18-Crown etlier at 50 °C. Without being bound to theory, the reaction is believed proceed as indicated below:<br>
CF3CHFCH2F + KOH → CF3CF=CH2 + KF + H2O A cleaned and leak tested 2 gallon autoclave was evacuated and then 2.5 L KOH water solution as indicated above was charged into it. The KOH solution was cooled down to 0 °C by chiller. The autoclave was evacuated again and using vacuum, 1.32Kg CF3CFHCFH2 was then charged into it. The sealed reactor was gradually heated with stirring to 55 °C and then was heated by setting temperature at 55 °C. After a reaction time of about 45 min., the temperature increased to 70 °C by exothermic reaction (pressure was 165 psig). A 0 °C cooling liquid was applied to bring the temperature down to 57°C. Then the reaction was continued at 55 °C for 20h.<br>

In a gas phase dehydrohatogenation reaction, 50 seem CF3CHFCH2F was passed over a 100 cc catalyst bed comprised of Cr2O3 or Ni-mesh or activated carbon or Pd/C or Ni/C kept inside a monel reactor in the presence of 20 seem of HF at 250-400 °C to synthesize CF3CF=CH2 which was finally trapped in a dry ice tap. The results using different catalysts are shown in Table 1.<br>
In a typical reaction, a 22-inch long monel reactor with 14-inch inner diameter was charged with 100 cc catalyst. A flow of 20 sccm of N2 was always kept during the reaction. The reactor temperature was then raised gradually to the desired reaction temperature. HFC-245eb was passed through gas-flow controllers into a preheater. The preheater temperature was kept at 300 °C. The gas stream coming out of the preheater was passed through the catalyst bed at the desired temperature over a specified period of time. An on-line GC and a GCMS were used to analyze samples taken at the reactor exit line at regular time intervals. Finally, the reactor exit stream was run into a 20% KOH scrubber solution at room temperature to eliminate any acid HF formed in-situ during the reaction. The exit gas mixture coming out of the scrubber solution was then condensed in a dry-ice trap to collect the products. The desired product CF3CF=CH2 (1234yf) was then isolated from the mixture by distillalion. Results are shown in Table 1<br>
