Human anti-B7RPl Neutralizing Antibodies<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application, Serial<br>
No. 60/700,265, filed July 18, 2005, the disclosure of which is explicitly incorporated<br>
by reference herein.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to human monoclonal antibodies that bind B7 related<br>
protein-1 (B7RP1). Compositions and methods for treating diseases and disorders<br>
related to immunosuppression and immune activation are also described.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
T-cells initiate the immune response, mediate antigen-specific effector<br>
functions, and regulate the activity of other leukocytes by secreting cytokines. For the<br>
generation of a proper T-lymphocyte (T-cell) immune response, two signals must be<br>
provided to the T-cell by antigen presenting cells (APC). Antigen must be presented<br>
to the T-cell receptor (TCR) via a major histocompatibility complex (MHC), in an<br>
event that determines specificity. T-cells can only recognize antigen presented on an<br>
APC. In addition to the antigen receptor, proper T-cell activation also requires the<br>
interaction of other cell-surface molecules on both the T-cell and the APC. These<br>
molecules, referred to as co-stimulatory molecules, consist of a receptor on the<br>
responding cell and a ligand present on the inducer cell. This antigen independent,<br>
co-stimulatory signal must be delivered by engagement of members of the B7 family<br>
on the APC with their receptors on T-cells. A productive immune response leads to<br>
proliferation, differentiation, clonal expansion, and effector function. In the absence<br>
of the second, co-stimulatory signal, T-cells undergo a state of long-lasting antigen-<br>
specific unresponsiveness, termed anergy. Phase II clinical experiments have<br>
demonstrated that blocking one co-stimulation pathway is efficacious in the treatment<br>
of psoriasis (Abrams et al, 2000, J Exp Med. 192:681-94; Abrams et al, 1999, J<br>
Clin. Invest. 103:1243-52) and rheumatoid arthritis (Kremer et al, 2003, New<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
England Journal of Medicine 349:1907-15), indicating that this general strategy is a<br>
good target for immunomodulatory therapy.<br>
A particular co-stimulatory B7 molecule, B7 related protein-1 (B7RP1), is a<br>
type 1 transmembrane protein with a signal sequence and extracellular domain at the<br>
amino-terminus, an extracellular domain comprising two Ig loops, a transmembrane<br>
domain, and a carboxy terminal intracellular domain (PCT Application Publication<br>
No. WO 00/46240). B7RP1 preferentially binds to ICOS (which stands for "inducible<br>
costimulator"; Yoshinga et al, 2000, Int. Immun. 12:1439-1447) expressed on the<br>
cell surface of T-cells. ICOS plays an important role in the production of both type 1<br>
and type 2 cytokines by activated T-cells (Coyle et al, 2000, Immunity 13:95-105).<br>
B7RP1 is the sole ligand expressed constitutively on APCs (Yoshinaga et al,<br>
1999, Nature. 402:827-32), while ICOS is expressed only on activated T-cells<br>
(McAdam et al, 2000, Journal of Immunology 165:5035-40). B7RPl-dependent<br>
signaling is required for the activation of the effector (i.e. fully activated) T-cell, as<br>
well as its maturation from its naive precursor (Dong et al, 2003, Journal of<br>
Auioimmunity. 21:255-60; Coyle et al, 2000, Immunity. 13:95-105). Consequently,<br>
the B7RP1/1COS interaction is required for proper T-cell-dependent recall immune<br>
responses (Dong et al, 2003, Journal of Autoimmunity. 21:255-60).<br>
Current attempts to interfere with the co-stimulatory T-cell pathway have<br>
focused primarily on co-stimulatory polypeptides that block T-cell activation only,<br>
but have not focused on activation and maturation. Consequently, these therapies<br>
provide general inhibition of T-cell function. In contrast, blocking the B7RP1/ICOS<br>
interaction provides a more specific inhibition of T-cell function by affecting only<br>
mature effector T-cells. Thus, blocking the B7RP1/ICOS interaction in a clinical<br>
setting is highly desirable because it would provide a more limited side-effect profile<br>
than co-stimulation therapies that block naive T-cell activation only.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

1 (B7RP1). In one embodiment, the monoclonal antibodies are human monoclonal<br>

linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (See, Sola, 1987, Monoclonal Antibodies: A<br>
Manual of Techniques, pp. 147-158, CRC Press, Inc.) for the detection and<br>
quantitation of B7RP1. The antibodies can bind B7RP1 with an affinity that is<br>
appropriate for the assay method being employed.<br>
In addition, the invention provides methods for treating a disease associated<br>
with increased production of B7RP1, increased sensitivity to B7RP1, and/or diseases<br>
related to control of T-cell responses, comprising the step of administering a<br>
pharmaceutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising at<br>
least one antibody of the invention or an antigen-binding or an immunologically<br>
functional immunoglobulin fragment thereof to an individual in need thereof.<br>

double-stranded nucleic acid polymers of at least 10 nucleotides in length. In certain<br>
embodiments, the nucleotides comprising the polynucieotide can be ribonucleotides<br>
or deoxyribonucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. Said<br>
modifications include base modifications such as bromuridine, ribose modifications<br>

such as arabinoside and 2',3'-dideoxyribose and internucleotide linkage modifications<br>
such as phosphorothioate, phosphoroditbioate, phosphoroselenoate,<br>
phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phoshoraniladate and<br>
phosphoroamidate. The term "polynucleotide" specifically includes single and double<br>
stranded forms of DNA or RNA.<br>
The term "oligonucleotide" referred to herein includes naturally occurring, and<br>
modified nucleotides linked together by naturally occurring, and/or non-naturally<br>
occurring oligonucleotide linkages. Oligonucleotides are a polynucleotide subset<br>
comprising members that are generally single-stranded and have a length of 200<br>
nucleotides or fewer. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are 10 to 60<br>
nucleotides in length. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,<br>
17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 nucleotides in length. Oligonucleotides may be single stranded<br>
or double stranded, e.g. for use in the construction of a genetic mutant.<br>

which are hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose. An oligonucleotide can<br>
include a detectable label to enable detection of the oligonucleotide or hybridization<br>
thereof.<br>
The term "isolated protein" referred to herein means that a subject protein (1)<br>
is free of at least some other proteins with which it would be found in nature, (2) is<br>
essentially free of other proteins from the same source, e.g., from the same species,<br>
(3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, (4) has been separated from at least<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
about 50 percent of polynucleotides, lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with<br>
which it is associated in nature, (5) is not associated (by covalent or noncovalent<br>
interaction) with portions of a protein with which the "isolated protein" is associated<br>
in nature, (6) is operably associated (by covalent or noncovalent interaction) with a<br>
polypeptide with which it is not associated in nature, or (7) does not occur in nature.<br>
Such an isolated protein can be encoded by genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA or other<br>
RNA, of synthetic origin, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, the<br>
isolated protein is substantially free from proteins or polypeptides or other<br>
contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its<br>
use (therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic, research or otherwise).<br>
An "isolated" antibody is one that has been identified and separated and/or<br>
recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of<br>
its natural environment are materials that would interfere with diagnostic or<br>
therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other<br>
proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous substances. In certain embodiments, the antibody<br>
is purified (1) to greater than 95% or greater than 99% by weight of antibody as<br>
determined by the Lowry method, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15<br>
residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup<br>
sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing<br>
conditions using Coomassie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the<br>
antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the<br>
antibody's natural environment will not be present.<br>
The terms "polypeptide" or "protein" means molecules having the sequence of<br>
native proteins, that is, proteins produced by naturally-occurring and specifically non-<br>
recombinant cells, or genetically-engineered or recombinant cells, and comprise<br>
molecules having the amino acid sequence of the native protein, or molecules having<br>
deletions from, additions to, and/or substitutions of one or more amino acids of the<br>
native sequence. The terms "polypeptide" and "protein" specifically encompass anti-<br>
B7RP1 antibodies, or sequences that have deletions from, additions to, and/or<br>
substitutions of one or more amino acid of an anti- B7RP1 antibody.<br>
The term "polypeptide fragment" refers to a polypeptide that has an ammo-<br>
terminal deletion, a carboxyl-terminal deletion, and/or an internal deletion. In certain<br>
embodiments, fragments are at least 5 to about 500 amino acids long. It will be<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
appreciated that in certain embodiments, fragments are at least 5, 6, 8,10,14, 20, 50,<br>
70, 100, 110, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, or 450 amino acids long. Particularly<br>
useful polypeptide fragments include functional domains, including binding domains<br>
particularly antigen-binding domains, especially wherein the antigen is an epitope of<br>
human B7RP1. In the case of an anti-B7RPl antibody, useful fragments include but<br>
are not limited to a CDR region, a variable domain of a heavy or light chain, a portion<br>
of an antibody chain or just its variable region including two CDRs, and the like.<br>
The term "specific binding agent" refers to a naturally occurring or non-<br>
naturally occurring molecule that specifically binds to a target. Examples of specific<br>
binding agents include, but are not limited to, proteins, peptides, nucleic acids,<br>
carbohydrates, and lipids. In certain embodiments, a specific binding agent is an<br>
antibody.<br>
The term "specific binding agent to B7RP1" refers to a specific binding agent<br>
that specifically binds any portion of B7RP1. In certain embodiments, a specific<br>
binding agent to B7RP1 is an antibody that binds specifically to B7RP1.<br>
By way of example, an antibody "binds specifically" to a target if the<br>
antibody, when labeled, can be competed away from its target by the corresponding<br>
non-labeled antibody.<br>
The term "immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment" as used<br>
herein refers to a polypeptide fragment that contains at least the CDRs of the<br>
immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. An immunologically functional<br>
immunoglobulin fragment of the invention is capable of binding to an antigen. In<br>
certain embodiments, the antigen is a ligand that specifically binds to a receptor. In<br>
these embodiments, binding of an immunoiogically functional immunoglobulin<br>
fragment of the invention prevents binding of the ligand to its receptor, interrupting<br>
the biological response resulting from ligand binding to the receptor. In one<br>
embodiment, an immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment of the<br>
invention binds specifically to B7RP1. Preferably, the fragment binds specifically to<br>
human B7RP1.<br>
The term "naturally-occurring" or "native" as used herein and applied to an<br>
object refers to the fact that the object can be found in nature. For example, a<br>
polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and that has not been<br>
intentionally modified by man is naturally-occurring. The term "non-naturally<br>
occurring" or "non-native" as used herein refers to a material that is not found in<br>
nature or that has been structurally modified or synthesized by man. For example,<br>
"non-naturally occurring" can refer to a variant, such as a polynucleotide variant that<br>
can be produced using art-known mutagenesis techniques, or a polypeptide variant<br>
produced by such a polynucleotide variant. Such variants include, for example, those<br>
produced by nucleotide substitutions, deletions or additions that may involve one or<br>
more nucleotides. Polynucleotide variants can be altered in coding or non-coding<br>
regions or both. Alterations in the coding regions may produce conservative or non-<br>
conservative amino acid substitutions, deletions, or additions. Especially certain<br>
among these are silent substitutions, additions, deletions, and conservative<br>
substitutions, which do not alter the properties and activities of a B7RP1 antibody of<br>
the invention. One of skill in the art can readily determine how to generate such a<br>
variant using methods well known in the art.<br>
The term "operably linked" means that the components to which the term is<br>
applied are in a relationship that allows them to carry out their inherent functions<br>
under suitable conditions. For example, a control sequence "operably linked" to a<br>
protein coding sequence is ligated thereto so that expression of the protein coding<br>
sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the transcriptional activity of<br>
the control sequences.<br>
The term "control sequence" as used herein refers to polynucleotide sequences<br>
that can effect expression, processing or intracellular localization of coding sequences<br>
to which they are operably linked. The nature of such control sequences may depend<br>
upon the host organism. In particular embodiments, control sequences for<br>
prokaryotes may include a promoter, ribosomal binding site, and transcription<br>
termination sequence. In other particular embodiments, control sequences for<br>
eukaryotes may include promoters comprising one or a plurality of recognition sites<br>
for transcription factors, transcription enhancer sequences, transcription termination<br>
sequences and polyadenylation sequences. In certain embodiments, "control<br>
sequences" can include leader sequences and/or fusion partner sequences.<br>
The term "vector" includes a nucleic acid molecule capable of carrying into a<br>
cell another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
"plasmid", which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional<br>
DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein<br>
additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are<br>
capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g.,<br>
bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian<br>
vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated<br>
into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell and thereby are<br>
replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of<br>
directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors<br>
are referred to herein as "recombinant expression vectors" (or simply, "expression<br>
vectors"). In general, expression vectors useful in the practice of recombinant DNA<br>
techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, "plasmid"<br>
and "vector" may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used<br>
form of vector. However, the invention is intended to include such other forms of<br>
expression vectors, such as viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses,<br>
adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions.<br>
The phrase "recombinant host cell" (or simply "host cell") includes a cell into<br>
which a recombinant expression vector has been introduced. It will be understood by<br>
those of skill in the art that such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular<br>
subject cell but to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may<br>
occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences,<br>
such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included<br>
within the scope of the term "host ceil" as used herein. A wide variety of host<br>
expression systems can be used to express the antibodies of the present invention<br>
including bacterial, yeast, baculoviral and mammalian expression systems (as well as<br>
phage display expression systems). An example of a suitable bacterial expression<br>
vector is pUC19. To express an antibody recombinantly, a host cell is transfected<br>
with one or more recombinant expression vectors carrying DNA fragments encoding<br>
the immunoglobulin light and heavy chains of the antibody such that the light and<br>
heavy chains are expressed in the host cell and can be secreted into the medium in<br>
which the host cells are cultured, from which medium the antibodies can be<br>
recovered. Standard recombinant DNA methodologies are used to obtain antibody<br>
heavy and light chain genes, incorporate these genes into recombinant expression<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
vectors and introduce the vectors into host cells, such as those described in Sambrook<br>
et al, 2001, MOLECULAR CLONING, A LABORATORY MANUAL, Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratories, Ausubel, F.M. et al. (eds.), CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR<br>
BIOLOGY, Greene Publishing Associates, (1989) and in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,397 to<br>
Boss et al.<br>
The term "transduction" is used to refer to the transfer of genes from one<br>
bacterium to another, usually by a phage. "Transduction" also refers to the<br>
acquisition and transfer of eukaryotic cellular sequences by retroviruses.<br>
The term "transfection" is used to refer to the uptake of foreign or exogenous<br>
DNA by a cell, and a cell has been "transfected" when the exogenous DNA has been<br>
introduced inside the cell membrane. A number of transfection techniques are well<br>
known in the art and are disclosed herein. See, e.g., Graham et al, 1973. Virology 52:<br>
456; Sambrook et al, 2001, MOLECULAR CLONING, A LABORATORY MANUAL, Cold<br>
Spring Harbor Laboratories; Davis et al, 1986, BASIC METHODS IN MOLECULAR<br>
BIOLOGY, Elsevier; and Chu et al, 1981, Gene 13: 197. Such techniques can be used<br>
to introduce one or more exogenous DNA moieties into suitable host cells.<br>
The term "transformation" as used herein refers to a change in a cell's genetic<br>
characteristics, and a cell has been transformed when it has been modified to contain a<br>
new DNA. For example, a cell is transformed where it is genetically modified from<br>
its native state. Following transfection or transduction, the transforming DNA may<br>
recombine with DNA from the cell by physically integrating into a chromosome of<br>
the cell, or may be maintained transiently as an episomal element without being<br>
replicated, or may replicate independently as a plasmid. A cell is considered to have<br>
been stably transformed when the DNA is replicated with the division of the cell.<br>
The term "antigen" refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule capable of<br>
being bound by a selective binding agent, such as an antibody, and additionally<br>
capable of being used in an animal to produce antibodies capable of binding to an<br>
epitope of that antigen. An antigen may have one or more epitopes.<br>
In certain embodiments, antibody variants include glycosylation variants<br>
wherein the number and/or type of glycosylation site has been altered compared to the<br>
amino acid sequences of the parent polypeptide. In certain embodiments, protein<br>
variants comprise a greater or a lesser number of N-linked glycosylation sites than the<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
native protein. An N-linked glycosylation site is characterized by the sequence: Asn-<br>
Xaa-Ser or Asn-Xaa-Thr, wherein the amino acid residue designated as Xaa may be<br>
any amino acid residue except proline. The substitution of amino acid residues to<br>
create this sequence provides a potential new site for the addition of an N-linked<br>
carbohydrate chain. Alternatively, substitutions that eliminate this sequence will<br>
remove an existing N-linked carbohydrate chain. Also provided is a rearrangement of<br>
N-linked carbohydrate chains wherein one or more N-linked glycosylation sites<br>
(typically those that are naturally occurring) are eliminated and one or more new N-<br>
linked sites are created. Additional antibody variants include cysteine variants<br>
wherein one or more cysteine residues are deleted from or substituted for another<br>
amino acid (e.g., serine) compared to the parent amino acid sequence. Cysteine<br>
variants may be useful when antibodies must be refolded into a biologically active<br>
conformation such as after the isolation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Cysteine<br>
variants generally have fewer cysteine residues than the native protein, and typically<br>
have an even number to minimize interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines.<br>
In additional embodiments, antibody variants can include antibodies<br>
comprising a modified Fc fragment or a modified heavy chain constant region. An Fc<br>
fragment, which stands for "fragment that crystallizes," or a heavy chain constant<br>
region can be modified by mutation to confer on an antibody altered binding<br>
characteristics. See, for example, Burton and Woof, 1992, Advances in Immunology<br>
51: 1-84; Ravetch and Bolland, 2001, Amu. Rev. Immunol. 19: 275-90; Shields et al,<br>
2001, Journal of Biol. Chem 276: 6591-6604; Telleman and Junghans, 2000,<br>
Immunology 100: 245-251; Medesan et al., 1998, Eur. J. Immunol 28: 2092-2100; all<br>
of which are incorporated herein by reference). Such mutations can include<br>
substitutions, additions, deletions, or any combination thereof and are typically<br>
produced by site-directed mutagenesis using one or more mutagenic<br>
oligonucleotide(s) according to methods described herein, as well as according to<br>
methods known in the art (see, for example, Sambrook et al., MOLECULAR CLONING: A<br>
LABORATORY MANUAL, 3rd Ed., 2001, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.and Berger and<br>
Kimmel, METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY, Volume 152, Guide to Molecular Cloning<br>

herein by reference).<br>

According to certain embodiments, amino acid substitutions may (1) reduce<br>
susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding<br>
affinity, and/or (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties on<br>
such polypeptides. According to certain embodiments, single or multiple amino acid<br>
substitutions (in certain embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions) may be<br>
made in the naturally occurring sequence (in certain embodiments, in the portion of<br>
the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermodular contacts). In certain<br>
embodiments, a conservative amino acid substitution typically does not substantially<br>
change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino<br>
acid should disrupt or tend to disrupt secondary structure that characterizes a parent<br>
sequence, such as a helix). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and<br>
tertiary structures are described in PROTEINS, STRUCTURES AND MOLECULAR<br>

"Antibody" or "antibody peptide(s)" refer to an intact antibody, or a binding<br>
fragment thereof that competes with the intact antibody for specific binding. In<br>
certain embodiments, binding fragments are produced by recombinant DNA<br>
techniques. In additional embodiments, binding fragments are produced by enzymatic<br>
or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Binding fragments include, but are not<br>
limited to, F(ab), F(ab'), F(ab')2, Fv, and single-chain antibodies.<br>
The invention provides antibodies that comprise a heavy chain and a light<br>
chain, wherein the heavy and light chains together form an antigen binding structure<br>
capable of specifically binding B7RP1. A full-length heavy chain includes a variable<br>
region domain, VH, and three constant region domains, CH1, CH2, and CH3. The VH<br>
domain is at the ammo-terminus of the polypeptide, and the CH3 domain is at the<br>
carboxyl-terminus. The term "heavy chain", as used herein, encompasses a full-<br>
length heavy chain and fragments thereof. A full-length light chain includes a<br>
variable region domain, VL, and a constant region domain, CL- Like the heavy chain,<br>
the variable region domain of the light chain is at the amino-terminus of the<br>
polypeptide. The term "light chain", as used herein, encompasses a full-length light<br>
chain and fragments thereof. A F(ab) fragment is comprised of one light chain and<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
the CH1 and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a F(ab)<br>
molecule cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule. A F(ab')<br>
fragment contains one light chain and one heavy chain that contains more of the<br>
constant region, between the CH1 and CH2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide<br>
bond can be formed between two heavy chains to form a F(ab')2 molecule. The Fv<br>
region comprises the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains, but lacks<br>
the constant regions. Single-chain antibodies are Fv molecules in which the heavy<br>
and light chain variable regions have been connected by a flexible linker to form a<br>
single polypeptide chain, which forms an antigen-binding region. Single chain<br>
antibodies are discussed in detail in International Patent Application Publication No.<br>
WO 88/01649 and U.S. Patent Nos. 4.946,778 and 5,260,203.<br>
A bivalent antibody other than a "multispecific" or "multifunctional" antibody,<br>
in certain embodiments, is understood to comprise binding sites having identical<br>
antigenic specificity.<br>
In assessing antibody binding and specificity according to the invention, an<br>
antibody substantially inhibits adhesion of a ligand to a receptor when an excess of<br>
antibody reduces the quantity of ligand bound to receptor by at least about 20%, 40%,<br>
60%, 80%, 85%, or more (as measured, inter alia, using an in vitro competitive<br>
binding assay).<br>
By "neutralizing antibody" is meant an antibody molecule that is able to block<br>
or substantially reduce an effector function of a target antigen to which it binds.<br>
Accordingly, a "neutralizing" anti-B7RPl antibody is capable of blocking or<br>
substantially reducing an effector function, such as receptor binding and/or elicitation<br>
of a cellular response, of B7RP1. "Substantially reduce" is intended to mean at least<br>
about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about<br>
85%, or at least about 90% reduction of an effector function of the target antigen (e.g.,<br>
human B7RP1).<br>
The term "epitope" includes any site on an antigen that is capable of specific <br>
binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. In certain embodiments, epitope<br>
determinants include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino<br>
acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups, and, in certain<br>
embodiments, may have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, and/or<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
specific charge characteristics. An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by<br>
an antibody. In certain embodiments, an antibody is said to specifically bind ah<br>
antigen when it preferentially recognizes its target antigen in a complex mixture of<br>
proteins and/or macromolecules. In certain embodiments, an antibody is said to<br>
specifically bind an antigen when the equilibrium dissociation constant is about 10-6<br>
M, 10-7M, 10-8 M, 10-9M, 10-10M, 10-11 M, 10-12 M, or less than about 10-12M.<br>
An antibody binds "essentially the same epitope" as a reference antibody,<br>
when the two antibodies recognize identical or sterically overlapping epitopes. The<br>
most widely used and rapid methods for determining whether two antibodies bind to<br>
identical or sterically overlapping epitopes are competition assays, which can be<br>
configured in all number of different formats, using either labeled antigen or labeled<br>
antibody. Usually, the antigen is immobilized on a substrate, and the ability of<br>
unlabeled antibodies to block the binding of labeled antibodies is measured using<br>
radioactive isotopes or enzyme labels.<br>
The term "agent" is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of<br>
chemical compounds, a biological macromoiecule, or an extract made from biological<br>
materials.<br>
As used herein, the terms "label" or "labeled" refers to incorporation of a<br>
detectable marker, e.g., by incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to<br>
a polypeptide of biotin moieties that can be detected by labeled avidin (e.g.,<br>
streptavidin comprising a detectable marker such as a fluorescent marker, a<br>
chemiluminescent marker or an enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or<br>
colorimetric methods). In certain embodiments, the label can also be therapeutic.<br>
Various methods of labeling polypeptides and glycoproteins are known in the art and<br>
may be used advantageously in the methods disclosed herein. Examples of labels for<br>
polypeptides include, but are not limited to radioisotopes or radionuclides such as 3H,<br>
14C, 15N, 35S, 90Y, 99mTc, 111In, 125I, and 131I, fluorescent labels (e.g., fluorescein<br>
isothiocyanate or FITC, rhodamine, or lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g.,<br>
horseradish peroxidase, β-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase),<br>
chemiluminescent labels, hapten labels such as biotinyl groups, and predetermined<br>
polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair<br>
sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, or epitope<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
tags). In certain embodiments, labels are attached by spacer arms (such as (CH2)n,<br>
where n 
The term "biological sample", as used herein, includes, but is not limited to,<br>
any quantity of a substance from a living thing or formerly living thing. Such living<br>
things include, but are not limited to, humans, mice, monkeys, rats, rabbits, and other<br>
animals. Such substances include, but are not limited to, blood, serum, urine, cells,<br>
organs, tissues, bone, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and skin.<br>
The term "pharmaceutical agent or drug" as used herein refers to a chemical<br>
compound or composition capable of inducing a desired therapeutic effect when<br>
properly administered to a patient. The expression "pharmaceutically effective<br>
amount" in reference to a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or a plurality<br>
of the antibodies of the invention is understood to mean, according to the invention,<br>
an amount of the said pharmaceutical composition that is capable of abolishing, in a<br>
patient, the decrease in the sensitivity threshold to external stimuli with a return of<br>
this sensitivity threshold to a level comparable to that observed in healthy subjects.<br>
A "disorder" is any condition that would benefit from treatment according to<br>
the present invention. "Disorder" and "condition" are used interchangeably herein<br>
and include chronic and acute immune system disorders or immune system diseases<br>
associated with inappropriate immune response, including those pathological<br>
conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. A number of<br>
conditions and disorders that would benefit from the treatment according to the<br>
present invention are described, for example, in International Patent Application No.<br>
PCT/US00/01871 (Publication No. WO 00/46240), the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The terms "immune system disease" and "immune system condition"<br>
encompass any medical condition or disorder associated with increased levels of<br>
B7RP1, increased sensitivity to B7RP1, or T-cell mediated diseases, including, but<br>
not limited to, autoimmune disease, graft survival, bone marrow and organ<br>
transplantation, allosensitization due to blood transfusions, toxic shock syndrome, T-<br>
cell dependent B-cell mediated diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases associated<br>
with chronic immune cell dysfunction, lymphoproliferative disorders (such as<br>
multiple myeloma, Waldenstom's macroglobulinemia, and crioglobulinemias), and<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
cancer. Non-limiting examples of autoimmune diseases include systemic lupus<br>
erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP),<br>
multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and psoriasis. Non-limiting examples of chronic<br>
inflammatory diseases include inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease<br>
and ulcerative colitis), Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and diabetes<br>
mellitus.<br>
The terms "immune system disease" and "immune system condition" also<br>
encompass any clinical condition that would be ameliorated by the inhibition of<br>
antibody production, such as hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions<br>
can be caused, for example, by hay fever, allergies, asthma, atopy, and acute edema.<br>
Non-limiting examples of diseases that cause antibody-mediated hypersensitivity<br>
reactions include systemic lupus erythematosis, arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis), nephropathies (such as glomerulo-nephritis,<br>
membranous, mesangiocapillary, focal segmental, focal necrotizing, crescentic, and<br>
proliferative nephropathies such as tubulopathies), skin disorders (such as pemphigus<br>
and pemphigoid, erythema nodosum), endocrinopathies (such as thyroiditis, Grave's<br>
disease, Hashimoto's disease, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), various<br>
pneumopathies (such as extrinsic alveolitis), various vasculopathies, coeliac disease,<br>
diseases with aberrant production of IgA, many anemias and thrombocytopenias,<br>
Guillain-Barre Syndrome, and myasthenia gravis.<br>
As used herein, the terms "effective amount" and "therapeutically effective<br>
amount" when used with reference to a vehicle- or a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising one or more anti-human B7RP1 human antibodies refers to an amount or<br>
dosage sufficient to produce a desired result (i.e., where for therapy with the vehicle-<br>
or anti-human B7RP1 human antibodies of the present invention the desired result is<br>
the desired modulation of T-cell responses, for example) or to support an observable<br>
decrease in the level of one or more biological activities of B7RP1. More<br>
specifically, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount of the anti-human B7RP1<br>
human antibody(ies) sufficient to inhibit, for some period of time, one or more of the<br>
clinically defined pathological processes associated with the condition at issue, e.g.<br>
immune disorders and diseases, in a subject treated in vivo with the agent. In the<br>
present invention, an "effective amount" of an anti-B7RPl antibody may modulate T-<br>
cell responses in a patient. In the methods of the present invention, the term "control"<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
and grammatical variants thereof, are used to refer to the prevention, partial or<br>
complete inhibition, reduction, delay or slowing down of an unwanted event, e.g.<br>
immune response. The effective amount may vary depending on the specific vehicle-<br>
or anti-human B7RP1 human antibody(ies) selected, and is also dependent on a<br>
variety of factors and conditions related to the subject to be treated and the severity of<br>
the disorder. For example, if the vehicle- or anti-human B7RP1 human antibody(ies)<br>
is to be administered in vivo, factors such as the age, weight and health of the patient<br>
as well as dose response curves and toxicity data obtained in preclinical animal work<br>
would be among those considered. If the agent is to be contacted with the cells in<br>
vitro, one would also design a variety of pre-clinical in vitro studies to assess such<br>
parameters as uptake, half-life, dose, toxicity, etc. The determination of an effective<br>
amount or a therapeutically effective amount for a given agent is well within the<br>
ability of those skilled in the art.<br>
As used herein, the terms "B7 related protein-1" and "B7RP1" are defined as<br>
all mammalian species of native sequence B7RP1, which is described in International<br>
Patent Application Publication No. WO 00/46240, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
As used herein, "substantially pure" or "substantially purified" means a<br>
compound or species that is the predominant species present (i.e., on a molar basis it<br>
is more abundant than any other individual species in the composition). In certain<br>
embodiments, a substantially purified fraction is a composition wherein the species<br>
comprises at least about 50 percent (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species<br>
present. In certain embodiments, a substantially pure composition will comprise more<br>
than about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of all macromolar species present in the<br>
composition. In certain embodiments, the species is purified to essential homogeneity<br>
(contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection<br>
methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single macromolecular<br>
species.<br>
The term "patient" includes human and animal subjects.<br>
"Treatment" or "treat" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or<br>
preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
disorder as well as those prone to have the disorder or those in which the disorder is to<br>
be prevented.<br>
Unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities<br>
and plural terms shall include the singular.<br>
According to certain embodiments of the invention, antibodies directed to<br>
B7RP1 may be used to treat immune system disorders and immune system diseases,<br>
including but not limited to, those mentioned above.<br>
In one aspect of the invention are provided fully human monoclonal antibodies<br>
raised against and having biological and immunological specificity for binding to<br>
human B7RP1. In another aspect the invention provides nucleic acids comprising<br>
nucleotide sequences encoding amino acid sequences for heavy and light chain<br>
immunoglobulin molecules, particularly sequences corresponding to the variable<br>
regions thereof. Particular embodiments of this aspect of the invention are sequences<br>
corresponding to complementarity determining regions (CDRs), specifically from<br>
CDR1 through CDR3, of the heavy and light chains provided by the invention. In yet<br>
another aspect the invention provides hybridoma cells and cell lines that express the<br>
immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies, such as monoclonal antibodies of the<br>
invention. The invention also provides biologically and immunologically purified<br>
preparations of antibodies, such as monoclonal antibodies raised against and having<br>
biological and immunological specificity for binding to human B7RP1.<br>
The ability to clone and reconstruct megabase-sized human loci in yeast<br>
artificial chromosomes (YACs) and to introduce them into the mouse germline<br>
provides an advantageous approach to elucidating the functional components of very<br>
large or crudely mapped loci as well as generating useful models of human disease.<br>
Furthermore, the utilization of such technology for substitution of mouse loci with<br>
their human equivalents provides unique insights into the expression and regulation of<br>
human gene products during development, their communication with other systems,<br>
and their involvement in disease induction and progression.<br>
An important practical application of such a strategy is the "humanization" of<br>
the mouse humoral immune system. Introduction of human immunoglobulin (Ig) loci<br>
into mice in which the endogenous Ig genes have been inactivated offers the<br>
opportunity to study mechanisms underlying programmed expression and assembly of<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
antibodies as well as their role in B-cell development. Furthermore, such a strategy<br>
provides a source for production of fully human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs).<br>
The term "human antibody" includes antibodies having variable and constant<br>
regions substantially corresponding to human germline immunoglobulin sequences.<br>
In certain embodiments, human antibodies are produced in non-human mammals,<br>
including, but not limited to, rodents, such as mice and rats, and lagomorphs, such as<br>
rabbits. In certain embodiments, human antibodies are produced in hybridoma cells.<br>
In certain embodiments, human antibodies are produced recombinantly.<br>
The term "recombinant" in reference to an antibody includes antibodies that<br>
are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means. Representative<br>
examples include antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector<br>
transfected into a host cell, antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial<br>
human antibody library, antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is<br>
transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes (see e.g., Taylor, et ah, 1992, Nucl.<br>
Acids Res. 20:6287-6295); or antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by<br>
any means that involves splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other<br>
DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant<br>
regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences.<br>
Human antibodies have at least three advantages over non-human and<br>
chimeric antibodies for use in human therapy:<br>
1)	because the effector portion of the antibody is human, it may interact better<br>
with the other parts of the human immune system (e.g., destroy the target cells more<br>
efficiently by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or antibody-dependent<br>
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC));<br>
2)	the human immune system should not recognize the human antibody as<br>
foreign, and, therefore the antibody response against such an injected antibody should<br>
be less than against a totally foreign non-human antibody or a partially foreign<br>
chimeric antibody;<br>
3)	injected non-human antibodies have been reported to have a half-life in the<br>
human circulation much shorter than the half-life of human antibodies. Injected<br>
human antibodies will have a half-life essentially identical to naturally occurring<br>
human antibodies, allowing smaller and less frequent doses to be given.<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
Thus, fully human antibodies are expected to minimize the immunogenic and<br>
allergic responses intrinsic to mouse or mouse-derivatized MAbs, and to thereby<br>
increase the efficacy and safety of the administered antibodies. Fully human<br>
antibodies of the invention, therefore, can be used in the treatment of diseases and<br>
disorders associated with inappropriate immune response, the treatment thereof<br>
requiring repeated antibody administration. Thus, one particular advantage of the<br>
anti-B7RPl antibodies of the invention is that the antibodies are fully human and can<br>
be administered to patients in a non-acute manner while minimizing adverse reactions<br>
commonly associated with human anti-mouse antibodies or other previously<br>
described non-fully human antibodies from non-human species.<br>
One skilled in the art can engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse antibody<br>
production with large fragments of the human Ig loci so that such mice produce<br>
human antibodies in the absence of mouse antibodies. Large human Ig fragments<br>
may preserve the large variable gene diversity as well as the proper regulation of<br>
antibody production and expression. By exploiting the mouse cellular machinery for<br>
antibody diversification and selection and the lack of immunological tolerance to<br>
human proteins, the reproduced human antibody repertoire in these mouse strains<br>
yields high affinity antibodies against any antigen of interest, including human<br>
antigens. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific human MAbs with the<br>
desired specificity may be produced and selected.<br>
Transgenic animals (e.g., mice) can also be used to produce human antibodies<br>
in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, transfer of<br>
the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will<br>
result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge (see, e.g.,<br>
Jakobovits et al, 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:2551-2555; Jakobovits et al,<br>
1993, Nature 362:255-258; Bruggemann et al, 1993, Year in Immun. 7:33, 1994,<br>
Nature .148:1547-1553) and, 1996, Nature Biotechnology 14:826; Gross et al, 2000,<br>
Nature 404:995-999; and U.S. Patents Nos. 5,877,397, 5,874,299, 5,814,318,<br>
5,789,650, 5,770,429, 5,661,016, 5,633,425, 5,625,126, 5,569,825, and 5,545,806,<br>
(each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes)).<br>
Human antibodies can also be produced in phage display libraries (Hoogenboom and<br>
Winter, 1992, J. Mol Biol 227:381; Marks et al, 1991, J. Mol. Biol 222:581). The<br>
techniques of Cole et al. and Boerner et al. are also available for the preparation of<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., 1985, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AND<br>
CANCER THERAPY Alan R. Liss, p. 77; and Boerner et al., 1991, J. Immunol. 147:86-<br>
95).<br>
Recombinant human antibodies may also be subjected to in vitro mutagenesis<br>
(or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic<br>
mutagenesis) and, thus, the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the<br>
recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from those related to human<br>
germline VH and VL sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody<br>
germline repertoire in vivo.<br>
In certain embodiments, the skilled artisan can use constant regions from<br>
species other than human along with the human variable region(s) in such mice to<br>
produce chimeric antibodies.<br>
A bispecific or bifunctional antibody typically is an artificial hybrid antibody<br>
having two different heavy chain/light chain pairs and two different binding sites.<br>
Bispecific antibodies may be produced by a variety of methods including, but not<br>
limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking of F(ab') fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai<br>
&amp; Lachmann, 1990, Clin. Exp Immunol 79: 315-321; Kostelny et al, 1992, J.<br>
bmmmol. 148:1547-1553.<br>
The invention provides antibodies that bind to human B7RP1. These<br>
antibodies can be produced by immunization with full-length B7RP1 or fragments<br>
thereof. The antibodies of the invention can be polyclonal or monoclonal, and/or may<br>
be recombinant antibodies. In preferred embodiments, antibodies of the invention are<br>
human antibodies prepared, for example, by immunization of transgenic animals<br>
capable of producing human antibodies (see, for example, International Patent<br>
Application, Publication WO 93/12227).<br>
The complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the light chain and heavy<br>
chain variable regions of anti- B7RP1 antibodies of the invention can be grafted to<br>
framework regions (FRs) from the same, or another, species. In certain embodiments,<br>
the CDRs of the light chain and heavy chain variable regions of anti-B7RPl antibody<br>
may be grafted to consensus human FRs. To create consensus human FRs, FRs from<br>
several human heavy chain or light chain amino acid sequences are aligned to identify<br>
a consensus amino acid sequence. The FRs of the anti-B7RPl antibody heavy chain<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
or light chain can be replaced with the FRs from a different heavy chain or light<br>
chain. Rare amino acids in the FRs of the heavy and light chains of anti-B7RPl<br>
antibody typically are not replaced, while the rest of the FR amino acids can be<br>
replaced. Rare amino acids are specific amino acids that are in positions in which<br>
they are not usually found in FRs. The grafted variable regions from anti-B7RPl<br>
antibodies of the invention can be used with a constant region that is different from<br>
the constant region of anti-B7RPl antibody. Alternatively, the grafted variable<br>
regions are part of a single chain Fv antibody. CDR grafting is described, e.g., in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 6,180,370, 5,693,762, 5,693,761, 5,585,089, and 5,530,101, which are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.<br>
Antibodies of the invention can be prepared using transgenic mice that have a<br>
substantial portion of the human antibody producing locus inserted in antibody-<br>
producing cells of the mice, and that are further engineered to be deficient in<br>
producing endogenous, murine, antibodies. Such mice are capable of producing<br>
human immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and do not produce or produce<br>
substantially reduced amounts of murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies.<br>
Technologies utilized for achieving this result are disclosed in the patents,<br>
applications, and references disclosed in the specification herein. In certain<br>
embodiments, the skilled worker may employ methods as disclosed in International<br>
Patent Application Publication No. WO 98/24893. which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference for any purpose. See also Mendez et al., 1997, 'Nature Genetics 15:146-<br>
156, which is hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.<br>
The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the invention can be produced by a<br>
variety of techniques, including conventional monoclonal antibody methodology, e.g.,<br>
the standard somatic cell hybridization technique of Kohler and Milstein (1975,<br>
Nature 256:495). Other techniques for producing monoclonal antibodies may be<br>
employed, e.g., viral or oncogenic transformation of B-lymphocytes.<br>
An exemplary animal system for preparing hybridomas is the mouse.<br>
Hybridoma production in the mouse is known in the art and immunization protocols<br>
and techniques for isolation of immunized splenocytes for fusion are also known in<br>
the art. Fusion partners (e.g., murine myeloma cells) and fusion procedures are also<br>
known.<br>

In a certain embodiment, human monoclonal antibodies directed against<br>
B7RP1 can be generated using transgenic mice carrying parts of the human immune<br>
system rather than the mouse system. These transgenic mice, referred to herein as<br>
"HuMab" mice, contain a human immunoglobulin gene minilocus that encodes<br>
unrearranged human heavy (µ and γ) and K light chain immunoglobulin sequences,<br>
together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous µ and K chain loci<br>
(Lonberg et al, 1994, Nature 368:856-859). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced<br>
expression of mouse IgM or K and in response to immunization, the introduced human<br>
heavy chain and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation<br>
to generate high affinity human IgG K monoclonal antibodies (Lonberg et al, supra.;<br>

Alternatively, transgenic mice strains described in the Examples below can be used to<br>
generate human anti-B7RPl antibodies.<br>
The present invention provides human monoclonal antibodies that are specific<br>
for and neutralize bioactive human B7RP1 polypeptides. Also provided are antibody<br>
heavy and light chain amino acid sequences which are highly specific for and<br>
neutralize B7RP1 polypeptides when they are bound to them. This high specificity<br>
enables the anti-human B7RP1 human antibodies, and human monoclonal antibodies<br>
with like specificity, to be effective immunotherapy for B7RP1 associated diseases.<br>

WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides isolated human antibodies that bind the<br>
same or essentially the same epitope as the 16H antibody provided herein.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides isolated human antibodies comprising at<br>
least one of the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS: 1-40 or 44-58 that<br>
binds a B7RP1 polypeptide epitope with high affinity and has the capacity to<br>

with a dissociation constant (KD) of about 10-6 M, 10-7 M, 10-8 M, 10-9 M, 10-10 M, 10-<br>
11 M or less and inhibits B7RP1 induced survival in an in vitro neutralization assay<br>

are referred to herein as 16H, 16Hg (germline), 5D, 2H, 2Bg (germline), 15H, 41H,<br>
and 43H. Antibody 16H comprises VL and VH polypeptide sequences as shown in<br>

WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
The dissociation constant (KD) of an anti-human B7RP1 human antibody can<br>
be determined by surface plasmon resonance as generally described in the Examples<br>
below. Generally, surface plasmon resonance analysis measures real-time binding<br>
interactions between ligand (recombinant B7RP1 polypeptide immobilized on a<br>
biosensor matrix) and analyte (antibodies in solution) by surface plasmon resonance<br>
(SPR) using the BIAcore® system (Pharmacia Biosensor, Piscataway, NJ). Surface<br>
plasmon analysis can also be performed by immobilizing the analyte (antibodies on a<br>
biosensor matrix) and presenting the ligand (recombinant V in solution). The<br>
dissociation constant (KD) of an anti-human B7RP1 human antibody can also be<br>
determined by using KinExA methodology. In certain embodiments of the invention,<br>
the antibodies bind to B7RP1 with a KD of approximately 10-5 M, 10-6 M, 10-7 M, 10-8<br>
M, 10-9 M, 10-10 M, 10-11 M, or 10-12 M. The term "KD", as used herein, is intended to<br>
refer to the dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. For<br>
purposes of the present invention KD was determined as shown in the Examples<br>
below.<br>
In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are of the IgG1, IgG2,<br>
IgG3, or IgG4 isotypc. The antibodies may be of the IgG2 or IgG1 isotype. In other<br>
embodiments, the antibodies of the invention may be of the IgM, IgA, IgE, or IgD<br>
isotype. In certain embodiments of the invention, the antibodies comprise a human<br>
kappa light chain and a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 heavy chain. Expression<br>
of antibodies of the invention comprising an IgG1 or an IgG2 heavy chain constant<br>
region is described in the Examples below. In particular embodiments, the variable<br>
regions of the antibodies are ligated to a constant region other than the constant region<br>
for the IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 isotype. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of<br>
the invention have been cloned for expression in mammalian cells.<br>
In certain embodiments, conservative modifications to the heavy chains and<br>
light chains of anti-B7RP1 antibodies (and corresponding modifications to the<br>
encoding nucleotides) will produce anti-B7RP1 antibodies having functional and<br>
chemical characteristics similar to those of the anti-B7RP1 antibodies disclosed<br>
herein. In contrast, substantial modifications in the functional and/or chemical<br>
characteristics of anti-B7RP1 antibodies may be accomplished by selecting<br>
substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the heavy and light chains that differ<br>
significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the molecular backbone<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the<br>
charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side<br>
chain.<br>
 For example, a "conservative amino acid substitution" may involve a<br>
substitution of a native amino acid residue with a nonnative residue such that there is<br>
little or no effect on the polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at that position.<br>
Furthermore, any native residue in the polypeptide may also be substituted with<br>
alanine, as has been previously described for "alanine scanning mutagenesis."<br>
Amino acid substitutions (whether conservative or non-conservative) can be<br>
determined by those skilled in the art at the time such substitutions are desired. In<br>
certain embodiments, amino acid substitutions can be used to identify those amino<br>
acid residues of an anti-B7RP1 antibody that are involved in binding specificity<br>
and/or affinity of the antibody for B7RP1 (e.g. residues that are involved in binding of<br>
the antibody to a particular epitope), such as amino acid residues in CDR1, CDR2,<br>
and/or CDR3 regions of the light or heavy chains as described herein. Such amino<br>
acid substitutions may increase or decrease the affinity of the anti-B7RP1 antibodies<br>
described herein.<br>
Minor changes in an amino acid sequence such as deletion, addition or<br>
substitution of one, a few or even several amino acids may lead to an allelic form of<br>
the original protein which has substantially identical properties. Therefore, in<br>
addition to the antibodies specifically described herein, other "substantially<br>
homologous" antibodies can be readily designed and manufactured utilizing various<br>
recombinant DNA techniques well known to those skilled in the art. In general,<br>
modifications of the genes may be readily accomplished by a variety of well-known<br>
techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis. Therefore, the present invention<br>
contemplates "variant" or "mutant" anti-B7RP1 human antibodies having<br>
substantially similar characteristics to the anti-B7RP1 human antibodies disclosed<br>
herein (See, for example, WO 00/56772, all of which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference). Thus, by the term "variant" or "mutant" in reference to an anti-B7RP1<br>
human antibody is meant any binding molecule (molecule X) (i) in which the<br>
hypervariable regions CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 of the heavy chain or the<br>
hypervariable regions CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 of the light chain taken as a whole<br>
are at least about 80% homologous, at least about 90% homologous, or at least about<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
95% homologous to the hypervariable regions as shown in SEQ ID NO: 15 through<br>
SEQ ID NO. 26 or SEQ ID NO: 27 through SEQ ID NO: 40, respectively, and (ii)<br>
wherein the variant or mutant is capable of inhibiting the activity of human B7RP1 to<br>
the same extent as a reference anti-B7RP1 human antibody having framework regions<br>
identical to those of molecule X. Such antibodies may bind to human B7RP1 or to<br>
mouse B7RP1 or both. The mouse B7RP1 sequence is described in WO 00/46240,<br>
which is incorporated by reference.<br>
Ordinarily, an anti-B7RP1 human antibody variant will have light and/or<br>
heavy chain CDRs, when taken as a whole, that are at least about 80% amino acid<br>
sequence identity, at least about 85% sequence identity, at least about 90% sequence<br>
identity, at least about 91% sequence identity, at least about 92% sequence identity, at<br>
least about 93% sequence identity, at least about 94% sequence identity, at least about<br>
95% sequence identity, at least about 96% sequence identity, at least about 97%<br>
sequence identity, at least about 98% sequence identity, or at least about 99% amino<br>
acid sequence identity to the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NOS: 15<br>
through SEQ ID NO. 26 and/or SEQ ID NOS: 27 through SEQ ID NO. 40,<br>
respectively. Such antibodies may bind to human B7RP1 or to mouse B7RP1 or to<br>
both.<br>
An anti-B7RP1 human antibody variant will have a light chain variable region,<br>
when taken as a whole, that has at least about 80% amino acid sequence identity, at<br>
least about 81% sequence identity, at least about 82% sequence identity, at least about<br>
83% sequence identity, at least about 84% sequence identity, at least about 85%<br>
sequence identity, at least about 86% sequence identity, at least about 87% sequence<br>
identity, at least about 88% sequence identity, at least about 89% sequence identity, at<br>
least about 90% sequence identity, at least about 91% sequence identity', at least about<br>
92% sequence identity, at least about 93% sequence identity, at least about 94%<br>
sequence identity, at least about 95% sequence identity, at least about 96% sequence<br>
identity, at least about 97% sequence identity, at least about 98% sequence identity, at<br>
least about 99% amino acid sequence identity to the amino acid sequence as shown in<br>
SEQ ID NOS: 1 through SEQ ID NO. 6, and/or a heavy chain variable region, when<br>
taken as a whole, that has at least about 70% amino acid sequence identity, at least<br>
about 75% sequence identity, at least about 80% sequence identity, at least about 81%<br>
sequence identity, at least about 82% sequence identity, at least about 83% sequence<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
identity, at least about 84% sequence identity, at least about 85% sequence identity, at<br>
least about 86% sequence identity, at least about 87% sequence identity, at least about<br>
88% sequence identity, at least about 89% sequence identity, at least about 90%<br>
sequence identity, at least about 91% sequence identity, at least about 92% sequence<br>
identity, at least about 93% sequence identity, at least about 94% sequence identity, at<br>
least about 95% sequence identity, at least about 96% sequence identity, at least about<br>
97% sequence identity, at least about 98% sequence identity, or at least about 99%<br>
amino acid sequence identity to the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NOS: 7<br>
through SEQ ID NO. 14. Such antibodies may bind to human B7RP1 and/or mouse<br>
B7RP1.<br>
As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, many of the potential CDR-<br>
contact residues are amenable to substitution by other amino acids and still allow the<br>
antibody to retain substantial affinity for the antigen. Likewise, many of the<br>
framework residues not in contact with the CDRs in the heavy and light chains can<br>
accommodate substitutions of amino acids from the corresponding positions from<br>
other human antibodies, by human consensus amino acids, or from other mouse<br>
antibodies, without significant loss of the affinity or non-immunogenicity of the<br>
human antibody. Selection of various alternative amino acids may be used to produce<br>
versions of the disclosed anti-B7RP1 antibodies and fragments thereof that have<br>
varying combinations of affinity, specificity, non-immunogenicity, ease of<br>
manufacture, and other desirable properties.<br>
A "variant" in reference to a polynucleotide is intended to refer to a nucleic<br>
acid molecule having at least about 75% nucleic acid sequence identity with a<br>
polynucleotide sequence of the present invention. Ordinarily, a polynucleotide<br>
variant will have at least about 75% nucleic acid sequence identity, at least about 80%<br>
nucleic acid sequence identity, at least about 81% nucleic acid sequence identity, at<br>
least about 82% nucleic acid sequence identity, at least about 83% nucleic acid<br>
sequence identity, at least about 84% nucleic acid sequence identity, at least about<br>
85% nucleic acid sequence identity, at least about 86% nucleic acid sequence identity,<br>
at least about 87% nucleic acid sequence identity, at least about 88% nucleic acid<br>
sequence identity, at least about 89% nucleic acid sequence identity, at least about<br>
90% nucleic acid sequence identity, at least about 91% nucleic acid sequence identity,<br>
at least about 92% nucleic acid sequence identity, at least about 93% nucleic acid<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
sequence identity, at least about 94% nucleic acid sequence identity, at least about<br>
95% nucleic acid sequence identity, at least about 96% nucleic acid sequence identity,<br>
at least about 97% nucleic acid sequence identity, at least about 98% nucleic acid<br>
sequence identity, or at least about 99% nucleic acid sequence identity with a novel<br>
nucleic acid sequence disclosed herein.<br>
In alternative embodiments, antibodies of the invention can be expressed in<br>
cell lines other than hybridoma cell lines. In these embodiments, sequences encoding<br>
particular antibodies can be used for transformation of a suitable mammalian host<br>
cell. According to these embodiments, transformation can be achieved using any<br>
known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell, including, for example<br>
packaging the polynucleotide in a virus (or into a viral vector) and transducing a host.<br>
cell with the virus (or vector) or by transfection procedures known in the art, as<br>
exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,912,040, 4,740,461, and 4,959,455 (all of<br>
which are hereby incorporated herein by reference for any purpose). Generally, the<br>
transformation procedure used may depend upon the host to be transformed. Methods<br>
for introducing heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in<br>
the art and include, but are not limited to, dextran-mediated transfection, calcium<br>
phosphate precipitation, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion,<br>
electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct<br>
microinjection of the DNA into nuclei.<br>
A nucleic acid molecule encoding the amino acid sequence of a heavy chain<br>
constant region, a heavy chain variable region, a light chain constant region, or a light<br>
chain variable region of an anti-B7RP1 antibody of the invention is inserted into an<br>
appropriate expression vector using standard ligation techniques. In one embodiment,<br>
the anti-R7RPl antibody heavy chain or light chain constant region is appended to the<br>
C-terminus of the appropriate variable region and is ligated into an expression vector.<br>
The vector is typically selected to be functional in the particular host cell employed<br>
(i.e., the vector is compatible with the host cell machinery such that amplification of<br>
the gene and/or expression of the gene can occur). For a review of expression<br>
vectors, see METHODS IN. ENZYMOLOGY 185 (Goeddel, ed.), 1990, Academic Press.<br>
Typically, expression vectors used in any of the host cells will contain<br>
sequences for plasmid maintenance and for cloning and expression of exogenous<br>
nucleotide sequences. Such sequences, collectively referred to as "flanking<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
sequences" in certain embodiments will typically include one or more of the<br>
following nucleotide sequences: a promoter, one or more enhancer sequences, an<br>
origin of replication, a transcriptional termination sequence, a complete intron<br>
sequence containing a donor and acceptor splice site, a sequence encoding a leader<br>
sequence for polypeptide secretion, a ribosome binding site, a polyadenylation<br>
sequence, a polylinker region for inserting the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide<br>
to be expressed, and a selectable marker element. Each of these sequences is<br>
discussed below.<br>
Optionally, the vector may contain a "tag"-encoding sequence, i.e., an<br>
oligonucleotide molecule located at the 5' or 3' end of the anti-B7RP1 antibody<br>
porypeptide coding sequence; the oligonucleotide sequence encodes polyHis (such as<br>
hexaHis), or another "tag" such as FLAG, HA (hemaglutinin influenza virus), or myc<br>
for which commercially available antibodies exist. This tag is typically fused to the<br>
polypeptide upon expression of the polypeptide, and can serve as a means for affinity<br>
purification or detection of the anti-B7RP1 antibody from the host cell. Affinity<br>
purification can be accomplished, for example, by column chromatography using<br>
antibodies against the tag as an affinity matrix. Optionally, the tag can subsequently<br>
be removed from the purified anti-B7RP1 antibody polypeptide by various means<br>
such as using certain peptidases for cleavage.<br>
Flanking sequences may be homologous (i.e., from the same species and/or<br>
strain as the host cell), heterologous (i.e., from a species other than the host cell<br>
species or strain), hybrid (i.e., a combination of flanking sequences from more than<br>
one source), synthetic or native. As such, the source of a flanking sequence may be<br>
any prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism, any vertebrate or invertebrate organism, or<br>
any plant, provided that the flanking sequence is functional in, and can be activated<br>
by, the host cell machinery.<br>
Flanking sequences useful in the vectors of this invention may be obtained by<br>
any of several methods well known in the art. Typically, flanking sequences useful<br>
herein will have been previously identified by mapping and/or by restriction<br>
endonuclease digestion and can thus be isolated from the proper tissue source using<br>
the appropriate restriction endonucleases. In some cases, the full nucleotide sequence<br>
of a flanking sequence may be known. Here, the flanking sequence may be<br>
synthesized using the methods described herein for nucleic acid synthesis or cloning.<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
Whether all or only a portion of the flanking sequence is known, it may be<br>
obtained using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or by screening a genomic<br>
library with a suitable probe such as an oligonucleotide and/or flanking sequence<br>
fragment from the same or another species. Where the flanking sequence is not<br>
known, a fragment of DNA containing a flanking sequence may be isolated from a<br>
larger piece of DNA that may contain, for example, a coding sequence or even<br>
another gene or genes. Isolation may be accomplished by restriction endonuclease<br>
digestion to produce the proper DNA fragment followed by isolation using agarose<br>
gel purification, Qiagen® column chromatography (Chatsworth, CA), or other<br>
methods known to the skilled artisan. The selection of suitable enzymes to<br>
accomplish this purpose will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
An origin of replication is typically a part of those prokaryotic expression<br>
vectors purchased commercially, and the origin aids in the amplification of the vector<br>
in a host cell. If the vector of choice does not contain an origin of replication site, one<br>
may be chemically synthesized based on a known sequence, and ligated into the<br>
vector. For example, the origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 (New<br>
England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) is suitable for most gram-negative bacteria, and<br>
various viral origins (e.g., SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, vesicular stomatitus virus<br>
(VSV), or papillomaviruses such as HPV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in<br>
mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for<br>
mammalian expression vectors (for example, the SV40 origin is often used only<br>
because it also contains the virus early promoter).<br>
A transcription termination sequence is typically located 3' to the end of a<br>
polypeptide coding region and serves to terminate transcription. Usually, a<br>
transcription termination sequence in prokaryotic cells is a G-C rich fragment<br>
followed by a poly-T sequence. While the sequence is easily cloned from a library or<br>
even purchased commercially as part of a vector, it can also be readily synthesized<br>
using methods for nucleic acid synthesis such as those described herein.<br>
A selectable marker gene encodes a protein necessary for the survival and<br>
growth of a host cell grown in a selective culture medium. Typical selection marker<br>
genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g.,<br>
ampicillin, tetracycline, or kanamycin for prokaryotic host cells; (b) complement<br>
auxotrophic deficiencies of the cell; or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
complex or defined media. Exemplary selectable markers are the kanamycin<br>
resistance gene, the ampicillin resistance gene, and the tetracycline resistance gene.<br>
Advantageously, a neomycin resistance gene may also be used for selection in both<br>
prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells.<br>
Other selectable genes may be used to amplify the gene that will be expressed.<br>
Amplification is the process wherein genes that are required for production of a<br>
protein critical for growth or cell survival are reiterated in tandem within the<br>
chromosomes of successive generations of recombinant cells. Examples of suitable<br>
selectable markers for mammalian cells include dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and<br>
promoterless thymidine kinase genes. Mammalian cell transformants are placed<br>
under selection pressure wherein only the transformants are uniquely adapted to<br>
survive by virtue of the selectable gene present in the vector. Selection pressure is<br>
imposed by culturing the transformed cells under conditions in which the<br>
concentration of selection agent in the medium is successively increased, thereby<br>
leading to the amplification of both the selectable gene and the DNA that encodes<br>
another gene, such as an antibody that binds to B7RP1 polypeptide. As a result,<br>
increased quantities of a polypeptide such as an anti-B7RP1 antibody are synthesized<br>
from the amplified DNA.<br>
A ribosome-binding site is usually necessary for translation initiation of<br>
mRNA and is characterized by a Shine-Dalgamo sequence (prokaryotes) or a Kozak<br>
sequence (eukaryotes). The element is typically located 3' to the promoter and 5' to<br>
the coding sequence of the polypeptide to be expressed.<br>
In some cases, such as where glycosylation is desired in a eukaryotic host cell<br>
expression system, one may manipulate the various pre- or prosequences to improve<br>
glycosylation or yield. For example, one may alter the peptidase cleavage site of a<br>
particular signal peptide, or add pro-sequences, which also may affect glycosylation.<br>
The final protein product may have, in the -1 position (relative to the first amino acid<br>
of the mature protein) one or more additional amino acids incident to expression,<br>
which may not have been totally removed. For example, the final protein product<br>
may have one or two amino acid residues found in the peptidase cleavage site,<br>
attached to the amino-terminus. Alternatively, use of some enzyme cleavage sites<br>
may result in a slightly truncated form of the desired polypeptide, if the enzyme cuts<br>
at such an area within the mature polypeptide.<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
Expression and cloning vectors of the invention will typically contain a<br>
promoter that is recognized by the host organism and operably linked to the molecule<br>
encoding the anti-B7RP1 antibody. Promoters are untranscribed sequences located<br>
upstream (i.e., 5') to the start codon of a structural gene (generally within about 100 to<br>
1000 bp) that control transcription of the structural gene. Promoters are<br>
conventionally grouped into one of two classes: inducible promoters and constitutive<br>
promoters. Inducible promoters initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA<br>
under their control in response to some change in culture conditions, such as the<br>
presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature. Constitutive promoters,<br>
on the other hand, uniformly transcribe genes to which they are operably linked, that<br>
is, with little or no control over gene expression. A large number of promoters,<br>
recognized by a variety of potential host cells, are well known. A suitable promoter is<br>
operably linked to the DNA encoding heavy chain or light chain comprising an anti-<br>
B7RP1 antibody of the invention by removing the promoter from the source DNA by<br>
restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the desired promoter sequence into the<br>
vector.<br>
Suitable promoters for use with yeast hosts are also well known in the art.<br>
Yeast enhancers are advantageously used with yeast promoters. Suitable promoters<br>
for use with mammalian host cells are well known and include, but are not limited to,<br>
those obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus,<br>
adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus,<br>
cytomegalovirus, retroviruses, hepatitis-B virus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40). Other<br>
suitable mammalian promoters include heterologous mammalian promoters, for<br>
example, heat-shock promoters and the actin promoter.<br>
Additional promoters which may be of interest include, but are not limited to:<br>
SV40 early promoter (Bernoist and Chambon, 1981, Nature 290:304-30); CMV<br>
promoter (Thomsen et al, 1984, Proc. Nat!. Acad. Sci. USA 81:659-663); the<br>
promoter contained in the 3' long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto,<br>
et al, 1980, Cell 22:787-97); herpes thymidine kinase promoter (Wagner et al, 1981,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:1444-45); promoter and regulatory sequences from<br>
the metallothionine gene (Brinster et al.,, 1982, Nature 296:39-42): and prokaryotic<br>
promoters such as the beta-lactamase promoter (Villa-Kamaroff et al, 1978, Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci U.S.A., 75:3727-31); or the tac promoter (DeBoer et al, 1983, Proc.<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
Natl Acad Sci. U.S.A., 80:21-25). Also of interest are the following animal<br>
transcriptional control regions, which exhibit tissue specificity and have been utilized<br>
in transgenic animals: the elastase I gene control region that is active in pancreatic<br>
acinar cells (Swift et al., 1984, Cell 38:639-46; Ornitz et al., 1986, Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Symp. Quant Biol. 50:399-409 (1986); MacDonald, 1987, Hepatology 7:425-<br>

1985, Nature 315:115-22); the immunoglobulin gene control region that is active in<br>
lymphoid cells (Grosschedl et al, 1984, Cell 38:647-58; Adames et al, 1985, Nature<br>

control region that is active in liver (Krumlauf et al., 1985, Mol. Cell Biol, .5:1639-<br>
48: Hammer et al, 1987, Science 235:53-58): the alpha 1-antitrypsin gene control<br>
region that is active in liver (Kelsey et al, 1987, Genes and Devel 1:161-71); the<br>
beta-globin gene control region that is active in myeloid cells (Mogram et al, 1985,<br>
Nature 315:338-40; Kollias et al, 1986, Cell 46:89-94); the myelin basic protein gene<br>
control region that is active in oligodendrocyte cells in the brain (Readhead et al,<br>
1987, Cell 48:703-12); the myosin light chain-2 gene control region that is active in<br>
skeletal muscle (Sani, 1985. Nature 114:283-86); and the gonadotropic releasing<br>
hormone gene control region that is active in the hypothalamus (Mason et al, 1986,<br>
Science 234:1372-78).<br>
An enhancer sequence may be inserted into the vector to increase transcription<br>
of DNA encoding light chain or heavy chain comprising an anti-B7RP1 antibody of<br>
the invention by higher eukaryotes. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA,<br>
usually about 10-300 bp in length, that act on the promoter to increase transcription.<br>
Enhancers are relatively orientation and position independent, having been found at<br>
positions both 5' and 3' to the transcription unit., Several enhancer sequences<br>
available from mammalian genes are known (e.g., globin, elastase, albumin, alpha-<br>
feto-protein and insulin). Typically, however, an enhancer from a virus is used. The<br>
SV40 enhancer, the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer,<br>
and adenovirus enhancers known in the art are exemplary enhancing elements for the<br>
activation of eukaryotic promoters. While an enhancer may be positioned in the<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
vector either 5' or 3' to a coding sequence, it is typically located at a site 5' from the<br>
promoter.<br>
Expression vectors of the invention may be constructed from a starting vector<br>
such as a commercially available vector. Such vectors may or may not contain all of<br>
the desired flanking sequences. Where one or more of the flanking sequences<br>
described herein are not already present in the vector, they may be individually<br>
obtained and ligated into the vector. Methods used for obtaining each of the flanking<br>
sequences are well known to one skilled in the art.<br>
After the vector has been constructed and a nucleic acid molecule encoding<br>
light chain, a heavy chain, or a light chain and a heavy chain comprising an anti-<br>
B7RP1 antibody has been inserted into the proper site of the vector, the completed<br>
vector may be inserted into a suitable host cell for amplification and/or polypeptide<br>
expression. The transformation of an expression vector for an anti-B7RP1 antibody<br>
into a selected host cell may be accomplished by well known methods including<br>
transfection, infection, calcium phosphate co-precipitation, electroporation,<br>
microinjection, lipofection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, or other known<br>
techniques. The method selected will in part be a function of the type of host cell to<br>
be used. These methods and other suitable methods are well known to the skilled<br>
artisan, and are set forth, for example, in Sambrook et al., supra.<br>
A host cell, when cultured under appropriate conditions, synthesizes an anti-<br>
B7RP1 antibody that can subsequently be collected from the culture medium (if the<br>
host cell secretes it into the medium) or directly from the host cell producing it (if it is<br>
not secreted). The selection of an appropriate host cell will depend upon various<br>
factors, such as desired expression levels, polypeptide modifications that are desirable<br>
or necessary for activity (such as glycosylation or phosphorylation) and ease of<br>
folding into a biologically active molecule<br>
Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the<br>
art and include, but are not limited to, immortalized cell lines available from the<br>
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), including but not limited to Chinese<br>
hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey<br>
kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells {e.g., Hep G2), and a<br>
number of other cell lines. In certain embodiments, cell lines may be selected through<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
determining which cell lines nave high expression levels and constitutively produce<br>
antibodies with B7RP1 binding properties. In another embodiment, a cell line from<br>
the B cell lineage that does not make its own antibody but has a capacity to make and<br>
secrete a heterologous antibody can be selected.<br>
Antibodies of the invention are useful for detecting B7RP1 in biological<br>
samples and identification of cells or tissues that produce B7RP1 protein. Antibodies<br>
of the invention that specifically bind to B7RP1 may be useful in treatment of B7RP1<br>
mediated diseases. Said antibodies can be used in binding assays to detect B7RP1<br>
and to inhibit B7RP1 from forming a complex with B7RP1 receptors. Said antibodies<br>
that bind to B7RP1 and block interaction with other binding compounds may have<br>
therapeutic use in modulating B7RP1 mediated diseases. In certain embodiments,<br>
antibodies to B7RP1 may block B7RP1 binding to its receptor, which may result in<br>
disruption of the B7RP1 induced signal transduction cascade.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of one or more of the antibodies<br>
of the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a<br>
disorder or condition caused by increased expression of B7RP1 or increased<br>
sensitivity to B7RP1 in a patient such as any one of disorders or conditions disclosed<br>
herein.<br>
In certain embodiments, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one or a plurality of the antibodies of<br>
the invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, solubilizer,<br>
emulsifier, preservative and/or adjuvant. Acceptable formulation materials are<br>
nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. In preferred<br>
embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of anti-B7RP1 antibodies are provided.<br>
In certain embodiments, acceptable formulation materials are nontoxic to<br>
recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed.<br>
In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may contain<br>
formulation materials for modifying, maintaining or preserving, for example, the pH,<br>
osmolarity, viscosity, clarity, color, isotonicity, odor, sterility, stability, rate of<br>
dissolution or release, adsorption or penetration of the composition. In such<br>
embodiments, suitable formulation materials include, but are not limited to, amino<br>

buffers (such as borate, bicarbonate, Tris-HCl, citrates, phosphates or other organic<br>
acids); bulking agents (such as mannitol or glycine); chelating agents (such as<br>
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)); complexing agents (such as caffeine,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, beta-cyclodextrin or hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin); fillers;<br>
monosaccharides; disaccharides; and other carbohydrates (such as glucose, mannose<br>
or dextrins); proteins (such as serum albumin, gelatin or immunoglobulins); coloring,<br>
flavoring and diluting agents; emulsifying agents; hydrophilic polymers (such as<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone); low molecular weight polypeptides; salt-forming counterions<br>
(such as sodium); preservatives (such as benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid,<br>
salicylic acid, thimerosal, phenethyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben,<br>
chlorhexidine, sorbic acid or hydrogen peroxide); solvents (such as glycerin,<br>
propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol); sugar alcohols (such as mannitol or<br>
sorbitol): suspending agents; surfactants or wetting agents (such as pluronics, PEG,<br>
sorbitan esters, polysorbates such as polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, triton,<br>
tromethamine, lecithin, cholesterol, tyloxapal); stability enhancing agents (such as<br>
sucrose or sorbitol); tonicity enhancing agents (such as alkali metal halides, for<br>
example, sodium or potassium chloride, mannitol sorbitol); delivery vehicles;<br>
diluents; excipients and/or pharmaceutical adjuvants. See REMINGTON'S<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 18th Edition, (A.R. Gennaro, ed.), 1990, Mack<br>
Publishing Company.<br>
In certain embodiments, the optimal pharmaceutical composition will be<br>
determined by one skilled in the art depending upon, for example, the intended route<br>
of administration, delivery format and desired dosage. See, for example,<br>
REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, supra. In certain embodiments, such<br>
compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release and<br>
rate of in vivo clearance of the antibodies of the invention.<br>
In certain embodiments, the primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical<br>
composition may be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. For example, a suitable<br>
vehicle or carrier may be water for injection, physiological saline solution or artificial<br>
cerebrospinal fluid, possibly supplemented with other materials common in<br>
compositions for parenteral administration. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed<br>
45<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
with serum albumin are mucher exemplary vehicles. In certain embodiments,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise Tris buffer of about<br>
pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, and may further include sorbitol,<br>
sucrose, Tween-20 and/or a suitable substitute therefor. In certain embodiments of<br>
the invention, anti-B7RP1 antibody compositions may be prepared for storage by<br>
mixing the selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional<br>
formulation agents (REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, supra) in the form of a<br>
lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. Further, in certain embodiments, the anti-<br>
B7RP1 antibody product may be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate<br>
excipients such as sucrose.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be selected for<br>
parenteral delivery. Alternatively, the compositions may be selected for inhalation or<br>
for delivery through the digestive tract, such as orally. Preparation of such<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is within the skill of the art.<br>
The formulation components are present in concentrations that are acceptable<br>
to the site of administration. In certain embodiments, buffers are used to maintain the<br>
composition at physiological pH or at a slightly lower pH, typically within a pH range<br>
of from about 5 to about 8.<br>
When parenteral administration is contemplated, the therapeutic compositions<br>
for use in this invention may be provided in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally<br>
acceptable aqueous solution comprising the desired anti-B7RP1 antibody in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral<br>
injection is sterile distilled water in which the anti-B7RP1 antibody is formulated as a<br>
sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved. In certain embodiments, the preparation<br>
can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable<br>
microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (such as polyiactic acid or<br>
polyglycolic acid), beads or liposomes, that may provide controlled or sustained<br>
release of the product which can be delivered via depot injection. In certain<br>
embodiments, hyaluronic acid may also be used, having the effect of promoting<br>
sustained duration in the circulation. In certain embodiments, implantable drug<br>
delivery devices may be used to introduce the desired antibody molecule.<br>
46<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be formulated for<br>
inhalation. In these embodiments, anti-B7RP1 antibodies are advantageously<br>
formulated as a dry, inhalable powder. In certain embodiments, anti-B7RP1 antibody<br>
inhalation solutions may also be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In<br>
certain embodiments, solutions may be nebulized. Pulmonary administration and<br>
formulation methods therefore are further described in International Patent<br>
Application No. PC17US94/001875, which is incorporated by reference and describes<br>
pulmonary delivery of chemically modified proteins.<br>
It is also contemplated that formulations can be administered orally. Anti-<br>
B7RP1 antibodies that are administered in this fashion can be formulated with or<br>
without carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as<br>
tablets and capsules. In certain embodiments, a capsule may be designed to release<br>
the active portion of the formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when<br>
bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic degradation is minimized. Additional<br>
agents can be included to facilitate absorption of the anti-B7RP1 antibody. Diluents,<br>
flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants, suspending agents,<br>
tablet disintegrating agents, and binders may also be employed.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is provided to comprise an<br>
effective quantity of one or a plurality of anti-B7RP1 antibodies in a mixture with<br>
non-toxic excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. By dissolving the<br>
tablets in sterile water, or another appropriate vehicle, solutions may be prepared in<br>
unit-dose form. Suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, such<br>
as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, lactose, or calcium phosphate;<br>
or binding agents, such as starch, gelatin, or acacia; or lubricating agents such as<br>
magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc.<br>
Additional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the<br>
art, including formulations involving anti-B7RP1 antibodies in sustained- or<br>
controlled-delivery formulations. Techniques for formulating a variety of other<br>
sustained- or controlled-delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible<br>
microparticles or porous beads and depot injections, are also known to those skilled in<br>
the art. See, for example, International Patent Application No. PCT/US93/00829,<br>
which is incorporated by reference and describes controlled release of porous<br>
polymeric microparticles for delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. Sustained-<br>
47<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
release preparations may include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of<br>
shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices may include<br>
polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,773,919 and<br>
European Patent Application Publication No. EP 058481, each of which is<br>
incorporated by reference), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-<br>
glutamate (Sidman et al, 1983, Biopolymers 22:547-556), poly (2-hydroxyethyl-<br>
methacrylate) (Langer et al. 1981, J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 15:167-277 and Langer,<br>
1982. Chem. Tech. .12:98-105), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al, supra) or poly-<br>
D(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (European Patent Application Publication No. EP<br>
133,988). Sustained release compositions may also include liposomes that can be<br>
prepared by any of several methods known in the art. See e.g., Eppstein et al., 1985,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 82:3688-3692; European Patent Application Publication<br>
Nos. EP 036,676; EP 088,046 and EP 143,949, incorporated by reference.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions used for in vivo administration are typically<br>
provided as sterile preparations. Sterilization can be accomplished by filtration<br>
through sterile filtration membranes. When the composition is lyophilized,<br>
sterilization using this method may be conducted either prior to or following<br>
lyophilization and reconstitution. Compositions for parenteral administration can be<br>
stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. Parenteral compositions generally are<br>
placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous<br>
solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.<br>
Once the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it may be stored in<br>
sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or as a dehydrated or<br>
lyophilized powder. Such formulations may be stored either in a ready-to-use form or<br>
in a form (e.g., lyophilized) that is reconstituted prior to administration.<br>
The invention also provides kits for producing a single-dose administration<br>
unit. The kits of the invention may each contain both a first container having a dried<br>
protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation. In certain<br>
embodiments of this invention, kits containing single and multi-chambered pre-filled<br>
syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes) are provided.<br>
The effective amount of an anti-B7RP1 antibody-containing pharmaceutical<br>
composition to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the<br>
48<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
therapeutic context ana objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the<br>
appropriate dosage levels for treatment will vary depending, in part, upon the<br>
molecule delivered, the indication for which the anti-B7RP1 antibody is being used,<br>
the route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface or organ size)<br>
and/or condition (the age and general health) of the patient. In certain embodiments,<br>
the clinician may titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the<br>
optimal therapeutic effect. A typical dosage may range from about 0.1 µg/kg to up to<br>
about 30 µg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In certain<br>
embodiments, the dosage may range from 0,1 µg/kg up to about 30 mg/kg; from 1<br>
µg/kg up to about 30 mg/kg; or from 5 µg/kg up to about 30 mg/kg.<br>
Dosing frequency will depend upon the pharmacokinetic parameters of the<br>
particular anti-B7RP1 antibody in the formulation used. Typically, a clinician<br>
administers the composition until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect.<br>
The composition may therefore be administered as a single dose, or as two or more<br>
doses (which may or may not contain the same amount of the desired molecule) over<br>
time, or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or catheter. Further<br>
refinement of the appropriate dosage is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art and is within the ambit of tasks routinely performed by them. Appropriate<br>
dosages may be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data. In certain<br>
embodiments, the antibodies of the invention can be administered to patients<br>
throughout an extended time period. Chronic administration of an antibody of the<br>
invention minimizes the adverse immune or allergic response commonly associated<br>
with antibodies that are raised against a human antigen in a non-human animal, for<br>
example, a non-fully human antibody produced in a non-human species.<br>
The route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is in accord<br>
with known methods, e.g. orally, through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal,<br>
intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, intra-ocular,<br>
intraarterial, intraportal, or intralesional routes; by sustained release systems or by<br>
implantation devices. In certain embodiments, the compositions may be administered<br>
by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation device.<br>
The composition also may be administered locally via implantation of a<br>
membrane, sponge or another appropriate material onto which the desired molecule<br>
49<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
has been absorbed or encapsulated. In certain embodiments, where an implantation<br>
device is used, the device may be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and<br>
delivery of the desired molecule may be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or<br>
continuous administration.<br>
It also may be desirable to use anti-B7RP1 antibody pharmaceutical<br>
compositions according to the invention ex vivo. In such instances, cells, tissues or<br>
organs that have been removed from the patient are exposed to anti-B7RP1 antibody<br>
pharmaceutical compositions after which the cells, tissues and/or organs. are<br>
subsequently implanted back into the patient.<br>
In particular, anti-B7RP1 antibodies can be delivered by implanting certain<br>
cells that have been genetically engineered, using methods such as those described<br>
herein, to express and secrete the polypeptide. In certain embodiments, such cells<br>
may be animal or human cells, and may be autologous, heterologous, or xenogeneic.<br>
In certain embodiments, the cells may be immortalized. In other embodiments, in<br>
order to decrease the chance of an immunological response, the cells may be<br>
encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. In further embodiments, the<br>
encapsulation materials are typically biocompatible, semi-permeable polymeric<br>
enclosures or membranes that allow the release of the protein product(s) but prevent<br>
the destruction of the cells by the patient's immune system or by other detrimental<br>
factors from the surrounding tissues.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples, including the experiments conducted and results<br>
achieved are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as<br>
limiting the invention.<br>

Production of Human Monoclonal Antibodies Against B7 related protein-1<br>
(B7RP1)<br>
Antigen<br>
50<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
Purified recombinant human B7RP-1 (hB7RP-l) prepared as described in<br>
International Patent Application Publication No. WO 00/46240, which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference, or CHO cells transfected to express hB7RP-l were used as the<br>
antigen. Mature human B7RP-1 has the amino acid sequence of residues X to 302 in<br>
the sequence shown in WO 00/46240 as SEQ ID NO: 17, wherein X can be 19, 20,<br>
21, 22, 24 or 28.<br>
Transgenic HuMab Mice<br>
Fully human monoclonal antibodies to B7RP-1 were prepared using HCo7 and<br>
HCo12 strains of HuMab transgenic mice, both of which express human antibody<br>
genes. In both of these mouse strains, the endogenous mouse kappa light chain gene<br>
has been homozygously disrupted as described in Chen et al. (1993) EMBO J.<br>
12:811-820 and the endogenous mouse heavy chain gene has been homozygously<br>
disrupted as described in Example 1 of PCT Publication WO 01/09187. Each of these<br>
mouse strains carries a human kappa light chain transgene, KCo5, as described in<br>
Fishwild et al (1996) Nature Biotechnology 14:845-851. The HCo7 strain carries the<br>
HCo7 human heavy chain transgene as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,545.806;<br>
5,625,825; and 5,545,807. The HCo12 strain carries the HCo12 human heavy chain<br>
transgene as described in Example 2 of PCT Publication WO 01/09187.<br>
HuMab Immunizations:<br>
To generate fully human monoclonal antibodies to B7RP-1, HuMab mice of<br>
the HCo7 or HCo12 strain were immunized with purified recombinant B7RP-1 or<br>
CHO cells transfected to express B7RP-1. General immunization schemes for<br>
HuMab mice are described in Lonberg et al (1994; Nature 368(6474): 856-859;<br>
Fishwild et al. (1996) Nature Biotechnology 14: 845-851 and PCT Publication WO<br>
98/24884. The mice were 6-16 weeks of age upon the first infusion of antigen. A<br>
purified recombinant preparation of B7RP-1 antigen (50 µg) or a preparation of<br>
transfected CHO cells (3.5 x 106 - 1 x 107 cells) was used to immunize the HuMab<br>
mice intraperitonealy.<br>
Transgenic mice were immunized twice with purified antigen in complete<br>
Freund's adjuvant intraperitonealy, followed by 2-4 weeks of IP immunizations (up to<br>
a total of 8 immunizations) with the purified antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant.<br>
51<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
Immunization with CHO cells transfected to express B7RP-1 was the same except<br>
that complete Freund's adjuvant and incomplete Freund's adjuvant were not used<br>
with the cells. The immune response was monitored by retroorbital bleeds. The<br>
plasma was screened by ELISA (as described below), and mice with sufficient titers<br>
of anti-B7RP-1 human immunogolobulin were used for fusions. Mice were boosted<br>
intravenously with antigen 3 and 2 days before sacrifice and removal of the spleen.<br>
Typically, 10-20 fusions for each antigen were performed. Several dozen mice were<br>
immunized for each antigen. A total of 28 mice of the HCo7 and HCol 2 mice strains<br>
were immunized with B7RP-1.<br>
Selection of HuMab Mice Producing Anti-B7RP-1 Antibodies;<br>
To select HuMab mice producing antibodies that bound B7RP-1, sera from<br>
immunized mice was tested by ELISA as described by Fishwild et al. (1996). Briefly,<br>
microtiter plates were coated with purified recombinant B7RP-1 at 1-2 µg /ml in PBS,<br>
50 µl/wells incubated 4 °C overnight then blocked with 200 µl/well of 5% chicken<br>
serum in PBS/Tween (0.05%). Dilutions of plasma from B7RP-1-immunized mice<br>
were added to each well and incubated for 1-2 hours at ambient temperature. The<br>
plates were washed with PBS/Tween and then incubated with a goat-anti-human IgG<br>
Fc polyclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 1 hour at<br>
room temperature. After washing, the plates were developed with ABTS substrate<br>
(Sigma, A-1888, 0.22 mg/ml) and analyzed by spectrophotometer at OD 415-495.<br>
Mice that developed the highest titers of anti-B7RP-1 antibodies were used for<br>
fusions. Fusions were performed as described below and hybridoma supernatants<br>
were tested for anti-B7RP-l activity by ELISA.<br>
Generation of Hybridomas Producing Human Monoclonal Antibodies to B7RP-1:<br>
The mouse splenocytes, isolated from the HuMab mice, were fused with PEG<br>
to a mouse myeloma cell line based upon standard protocols. The resulting<br>
hybridomas were then screened for the production of antigen-specific antibodies.<br>
Single cell suspensions of splenic lymphocytes from immunized mice were fused to<br>
one-fourth the number of SP2/0 nonsecreting mouse myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL<br>
1581) with 50% PEG (Sigma). Cells were plated at approximately 1x10 5/well in flat<br>
52<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
bottom microtiter plate, followed by about two week incubation in selective medium<br>
containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% P388D1 (ATCC, CRL TEB-63) conditioned<br>
medium, 3-5% origen (IGEN) in DMEM (Mediatech, CRL 10013, with high glucose,<br>
L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate) plus 5 mM HEPES, 0.055 mM 2-mercaptoethanol,<br>
50 mg/ml gentamycin and 1x HAT (Sigma, CRL P-7185). After 1-2 weeks, cells<br>
were cultured in medium in which the HAT was replaced with HT. Individual wells<br>
were then screened by ELISA (described above) for human anti-B7RP-1 monoclonal<br>
IgG antibodies. Once extensive hybridoma growth occurred, medium was monitored<br>
usually after 10-14 days. The antibody secreting hybridomas were replated, screened<br>
again and, if still positive for human IgG, anti-B7RP-1 monoclonal antibodies were<br>
subcloned at least twice by limiting dilution. The stable subclones were then cultured<br>
in vitro to generate small amounts of antibody in tissue culture medium for further<br>
characterization.<br>
Example 2<br>
Cloning the anti-B7RP1 Antibody Heavy and Light Chains<br>
The hybridoma expressing the B7RP1 binding monoclonal antibody 16H was<br>
used as a source to isolate total RNA using TRlzol® reagent (Invitrogen). A 5'<br>
RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) oligonucleotide (5'- CGA CUG GAG<br>
CAC GAG GAC ACU GAC AUG GAC UGA AGG AGU AGA AA-3'; SEQ ID NO:<br>
69) was ligated to the RNA using the GeneRacer™ Kit (Invitrogen) components and<br>
protocol. First strand cDNA was synthesized using a random primer with an<br>
extension adapter (5'-_ GGC CGG ATA GGC CTC CAN NNN NNT-3') (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 59) and a 5' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) preparative assay was<br>
performed using the GeneRacer™ Kit (Invitrogen) according to instructions from the<br>
manufacturer. For preparing complete light chain encoding cDNA, the forward<br>
primer was the GeneRacer™ nested primer, and the reverse primer was (5'- GGG<br>
GTC AGG CTG GAA CTG AGG-3') (SEQ ID NO: 60). For preparing cDNA<br>
encoding the variable region of the heavy chain, the forward primer was the<br>
GeneRacer™ nested primer and the reverse primer was (5'- TGA GGA CGC TGA<br>
CCA CAC G-3') (SEQ ID NO: 61). RACE products were cloned into pCR4-TOPO<br>
53<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
(Invitrogen) and the sequences determined. Consensus sequences were used to design<br>
primers for full-length antibody chain PCR amplification.<br>
For preparing cDNA encoding anti-B7RP1 16H kappa light chain, the 5' PCR<br>
primer encoded the amino terminus of the signal sequence, an XbaI restriction<br>
enzyme site, and an optimized Kozak sequence (5'-CAG CAG AAG CTT CTA GAC<br>
CAC CAT GGA CAT GAG GGT CCT CGC TCA GCT CCT GGG-3') (SEQ ID NO:<br>
62). The 3' primer encoded the carboxyl terminus and termination codon, as well as a<br>
SalI restriction site (5'-CTT GTC GAC TCA ACA CTC TCC CCT GTT GAA GCT<br>
C-3') (SEQ ID NO: 63). The resulting PCR product fragment was purified, digested<br>
with Xbal and Sail, and then gel isolated and ligated into the mammalian expression<br>
vector pDSRα20 (see International Application, Publication No. WO 90/14363,<br>
which is herein incorporated by reference for any purpose. pDSRα20 was produced<br>
by changing nucleotide 2563 in pDSRa19 from a "Guanosine" to an "Adenosine" by<br>
site directed mutagenesis.).<br>
For preparing cDNA encoding anti- B7RP1 16H heavy chain the 5' PCR<br>
primer encoded the amino terminus of the signal sequence, an XbaI restriction<br>
enzyme site, and an optimized Kozak sequence (5'-ACA ACA AAG CTT CTA GAC<br>
CAC CAT GGA GTT GGG GCT GAA CTG G-3') (SEQ ID NO: 64). The 3' primer<br>
encoded the carboxyl end of the variable region, including a naturally occurring sense<br>
strand BsmBI site (5'- GTG GAG GCA CTA GAG ACG GTG ACC AGG ATT CC -<br>
3'; SEQ ID NO: 65). The resulting product was purified, digested with Xbal and<br>
BsmBl, gel isolated and ligated into the pDSRa20 vector containing the human IgGl<br>
constant region and also into the pDSRa20 vector containing the human IgG2<br>
constant region. All of the hybridoma derived anti-B7RP1 heavy chain variable<br>
regions, regardless of the native constant region associated, were cloned as described<br>
above into both the pDSRoc20 vectors containing the human IgGl and the human<br>
IgG2 constant regions.<br>

Expression of Anti-B7RP1 Antibodies in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Cells<br>
Stable expression of the 16H anti-B7RP1 mAb was achieved by co-<br>
transfection of 16H-heavy chain/pDSRαl9 IgG2 B7RP1-kappa/pDSRαl9 plasmids<br>
54<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
into dihydrofolate reductase deficient (DHFR") serum-free adapted Chinese hamster<br>
ovary (CHO) cells using a calcium phosphate method (the full length 16H heavy<br>
chain sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO: 44; the 16H kappa chain sequence is shown<br>
in SEQ ID NO: 45). Transfected cells were selected in medium containing dialyzed<br>
serum but not containing hypoxanthine-thymidine to ensure the growth of cells<br>
expressing the DHFR enzyme. Transfected clones were screened using assays such<br>
as ELISA in order to detect the expression of 16H anti-B7RP1 mAb in the<br>
conditioned medium. The highest expressing clones were subjected to increasing<br>
concentrations of methotrexate (MTX) for DHFR amplification. MTX amplified<br>
clones were screened using assays such as ELISA in order to detect higher expression<br>
of 16H anti-B7RP1 mAb in the conditioned medium. The highest expressing clones<br>
were subjected to subcloning to obtain a homogeneous population and creation of cell<br>
banks.<br>
Other recombinant anti-B7RP1 antibodies of the invention can be generated in<br>
Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in DHFR using the same protocol as described<br>
above for the anti-B7RP1 monoclonal antibody. The DNA sequences encoding the<br>
complete heavy chain or light chain of each anti-B7RP1 antibody of the invention are<br>
cloned into expression vectors. CHOd-cells are co-transfected with an expression<br>
vector capable of expressing a complete heavy chain and an expression vector<br>
expressing the complete light chain of the appropriate anti-B7RP1 antibody. For<br>
example, to generate a 5D anti-B7RP1 antibody, cells are co-transfected with a vector<br>
capable of expressing a complete heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence as<br>
set forth in SEQ ID NO: 47 and a vector capable of expressing a complete light chain<br>
comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 48. Table 2 summarizes<br>
exemplary complete light chains and exemplary complete heavy chains for anti-<br>
B7RP1 antibodies having human IgG heavy chain constant regions. One of skill in<br>
the art will recognize that the IgG1 or IgG2 could be substituted for each other (i.e.<br>
where IgGl is listed in the table, IgG2 could be present, and vice versa).<br>
Alternatively, any other immunoglobulin (e.g., IgM, IgA, IgE or IgH) could be used<br>
to generate antibodies of the invention.<br>

Example 4<br>
Production of anti-B7RP1 Antibody<br>
Anti-B7RP1 antibody is produced by expression in a clonal line of CHO cells.<br>
For each production run, cells from a single vial are thawed into serum-free cell<br>
culture media. The cells are grown initially in a T-flask followed by spinner flasks<br>
and then grown in stainless steel reactors of increasing scale up to a 2000L bioreactor.<br>
Production is carried out in a 2000L bioreactor using a fed batch culture, in which a<br>
nutrient feed containing concentrated media components is added to maintain cell<br>
growth and culture viability. Production lasts for approximately two weeks during<br>
which time anti-B7RP1 antibody is constitutively produced by the cells and secreted<br>
into the cell culture medium.<br>
The production reactor is controlled at a predetermined pH, temperature, and<br>
dissolved oxygen level: pH is controlled by carbon dioxide gas and sodium carbonate<br>
addition; dissolved oxygen is controlled by air, nitrogen, and oxygen gas flows.<br>
56<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
At the end of production, the cell broth is fed into a disk stack centrifuge and<br>
the culture supernatant is separated from the cells. The concentrate is further clarified<br>
through a depth filter followed by a 0.2 µm filter. The clarified conditioned media is<br>
then concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration. The conditioned media is<br>
concentrated 15- to 30- fold. The resulting concentrated conditioned medium is then<br>
either processed through purification or frozen for purification at a later date.<br>
Example 5<br>
Germlining the 16H mAb<br>
Sequence alignment of the 16H antibody with human germline sequences<br>
showed that the framework sequence in the variable region of the 16H antibody was<br>
most identical to the VH 3-07 and JH4 germline sequences, with only three amino acid<br>
differences (Figure 1A). The framework sequence for the VK region of the 16H<br>
antibody was found to be identical to the VK1-L15 germline sequence. It is<br>
theoretically possible that somatic hypermutations are recognized as foreign by the<br>
immune response of a patient; in which case the patient would generate an anti-<br>
idiotype response that could neutralize the therapeutic. To reduce this possibility, the<br>
three amino acid changes in the VH framework region were converted back to the VH<br>
3-07 and JH4 germline sequences (Figure 1A). Since the germline VH and JH gene<br>
segments are present in every human genome, the germline version of 16H is not<br>
likely to be recognized as foreign by the immune response of a dosed patient. Plate<br>
co-stimulation bioassays were conducted to determine if the germlined antibodies<br>
could induce T-cell proliferation with an IC50 similar to the IC50 of the non-germlined<br>
antibodies. The co-stimulation assays were conducted as described below using anti-<br>
CD3 and hB7RP-1-Fc fusion protein confirmed that this germlined antibody, referred<br>
to as 16Hgermline or 16Hg, retains its biological activities (Figure 1B).<br>
Example 6<br>
Affinity Measurement of Monoclonal Antibodies by Biacore® and KinExA<br>
Three antibodies (5D and 16H, prepared as described in Example 1, and 16H<br>
germline, prepared as described in Example 5) were purified and submitted to binding<br>
57<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
affinity analysis. B7RP1-Fc was immobilized at a high density on a CM5 sensor chip<br>
using standard amine coupling chemistiy. A fixed concentration of mAb was then<br>
incubated with varying concentrations of B7RP-1 or B7RP1-Fc for at least eight hours<br>
at room temperature to allow them to reach equilibrium. The samples were then<br>
injected over the B7RP1-Fc surface, and the binding signal observed represented free<br>
antibody remaining in solution at equilibrium. By using two different antibody<br>
concentration (0.2nM and 1nM), the KD of the interaction between a particular mAb<br>
and ligand was calculated from nonlinear regression analysis of the competition<br>
curves using a dual-curve one-site homogeneous binding model (Adamczyk et al,<br>
1999, Bioconjugate Chem. 10:1032-37; Adamczyk et al, 2000, Methods 20:319-28).<br>
As shown in Figure 2 and Table 3, the 16K 16Hg, and 5D mAbs all bound both<br>
soluble B7RP-1 and B7RP-1-Fc proteins at high affinities. In addition, the results<br>
indicated that the 16H (non-germline) and the 16Hg (germline) reacted similarly,<br>
demonstrating that germlining did not significantly affect binding between antibody<br>
and ligand.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
Binding of 5D, 2H, and 2H germline antibodies was also tested using KinExA<br>
(kinetic exclusion assay) technology. In this assay, hB7RP-1 was coupled to agarose<br>
beads. The beads were used to create a bead column. Samples containing antibody at<br>
a fixed concentration, which were allowed to come to equilibrium with varying<br>
concentrations of hB7RP-l, were then passed over the bead column. Antibody not<br>
complexed with ligand bound to the coated beads.<br>
A fluorescent tagged anti-human Fc secondary antibody was used to detect<br>
bound test antibody. The signal obtained was proportional to free antibody in solution<br>
at a given ligand concentration. Using two different antibody concentrations, the KD<br>
of the interaction was calculated from nonlinear regression analysis of the competition<br>
curves using a dual-curve one-site homogeneous binding model (Adamczyk et al,<br>
58<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
1999, Bioconjugate Chem. 10:1032-37; Adaraczyk et al, 2000, Methods 20:319-28).<br>
Figures 3, 4, and 5 show the dual-curve fits for antibodies 5D, 2H and 2H(germline).<br>
Using this technique, an approximately 10-fold difference was seen in the Kps for<br>
antibodies 5D and 2H.<br>
The results of the Biacore® and KinExA assays demonstrated that antibody 5D<br>
has a higher affinity for hB7RP-l than do either 2H or 16H. Also, the germline<br>
version of antibody 2H does not show a significant difference from the non-germline<br>
construct.<br>

Functional Characteristics of anti-B7RP1 Antibodies<br>
The functional characteristics of B7RP-1 antibodies of the invention were<br>
evaluated using binding-competition assays, in vitro co-stimulation assays and in vitro<br>
tetanus toxoid assays.<br>
Binding-competition studies<br>
Binding-competition studies were conducted with the 16H mAbs to<br>
demonstrate that they can compete for ICOS binding for B7RP-1. CHO cells<br>
transfected with a gene encoding the full-length human B7RP-1 were first incubated<br>
with decreasing amounts of unlabeled 16H mAb and subsequently stained with a<br>
fluorescently-labeled ICOS-Fc fusion protein. The cells were then analyzed using<br>
flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 6, ICOS-Fc stained the B7RP-1-transfected<br>
CHO cells; 0.4p.g/ml of 16H mAb did not affect ICOS-Fc binding. However, 6 and<br>
25 µg/ml of 16H efficiently competed away ICOS-Fc binding, indicating that the 16H<br>
mAb indeed competed for ICOS binding on B7RP-1.<br>
Co-stimulation Assay's<br>
Cell culture plates (Falcon, Cat No.353077, U bottom) were coated with 1<br>
ug/ml anti-human CD3 antibodies (PharMingen Cat No.555336) and 10ug/ml anti-<br>
human IgG (Fc specific, Sigma Cat No.I3391). The anti-CD3 antibodies and anti-<br>
59<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
human immunoglobulin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were added to each well<br>
(100µl/well). The coated plates were incubated at 4°C overnight or at room<br>
temperature for 2 hours. The plates were then washed with PBS twice. After<br>
washing, 1µg/ml human B7-2Fc (R&amp;D System, Cat No.141-B2) or 5µg/ml<br>
hB7RP1Fc, each diluted in PBS, were added to each well (100µl per well). The plates<br>
were then incubated at room temperature for 3 hours and washed twice with PBS<br>
thereafter. Purified human T cells were added (1x105 per well) in 200µl volume of<br>
media (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin-<br>
streptomycin-L-glutamine (PSG), β-mercpatoethanol (2-ME), N-Acetyl aspartate<br>
(NAA) and Napyruvate) and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 hours. 3-H thymidine<br>
(ICN Cat No.2404205) was added at 1µCi/well and the cells were incubated overnight<br>
at 37°C, 5% CO2. The cells were then harvested and counted.<br>
Cell culture plates (Falcon, Cat No.353077, U bottom) were coated with 0.1<br>
jig/ml anti-human CD3 as above. hB7RP1 transfected CHO cells (5000RAD<br>
irradiated) were added at 2xl04 per well followed by purified human T cells at 1x105<br>
per well in 200µl volume. Plates were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 hours as<br>
above. 3-H thymidine was added at 1µCi/well. Cells were incubated overnight,<br>
harvested, and counted as above.<br>
Tetanus Toxoid Assays<br>
PBMC were purified from human blood using a Ficoll-Paque (Amersham<br>
Biosciences) gradient as follows. Blood was diluted 1:2 with PBS, diluted blood was<br>
layered on top of the Ficoll (1/3 room temp Ficoll + 2/3 diluted blood), centrifuged at<br>
2500 rpm for 30 minutes at room temperature, the top layer (plasma &amp; piatelets) was<br>
aspirated off, and the mononuclear cell layer was transferred to a fresh 50 ml tube.<br>
The isolated PBMC were washed with PBS (3x the volume of the mononuclear cell<br>
layer) and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1300 rpm at room temperature and washed as<br>
above. The PBMC were resuspended in media (RPMI 1640 + 10% heat-inactivated<br>
FBS + 1X PSG + 1X NEAA + 55 µM 2-ME) and the cells were counted.<br>
PMBC were added to wells of a 96-well round bottom plate at 100 µl<br>
PBMC/well (3x106/ml). Tetanus toxoid (20 µg/ml; University of Massachusetts) was<br>
added for a final concentration of 5 µg/ml. The cells were incubated for 3 days at<br>
60<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
37°C; 100 µl supernatant were collected and incubated for an addition 6 to 8 hours in<br>
the presence of 1 µCi/well 3H-thymidine (MP Biomedicals). The cells were then<br>
harvested and counted.<br>

Epitope Mapping<br>
Experiments were conducted to identify the region on B7RP-1 to which the<br>
16H/16Hg and 5D monoclonal antibodies bind. To do this, a novel Fluorescence-<br>
Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) binding assay was developed. The human extracellular<br>
domain (ECD) of B7RP1 (SEQ ID NO: 66) as well as truncated forms of B7RP-1<br>
containing either the IgI (IgV-like; SEQ ID NO: 67) or the Ig2 (IgC-like; SEQ ID<br>

Expression vectors containing genes encoding these fusion proteins were<br>
individually transiently transfected into 293T cells and the conditioned media from<br>
these ceil lines were used as the source of fusion protein. The avidin-tag was used to<br>
capture the B7RP1 fusion proteins from solution using a biotin-coated bead. Fusion<br>
proteins were incubated with either fluorescently-labeled 16H or 5D mAbs or a<br>
fluorescently-labeled ICOS-Fc fusion protein, and incubated with biotin-coated beads.<br>
The beads were recovered and analyzed using flow cytometry on a Becton-Dickinson<br>
Bioscience FACScan (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). As shown in Figure 9A, fluorescent<br>
staining of the beads was detected with the 16H, 5D, and the ICOS reagents when the<br>
full ECD of B7RP-1 was attached, indicating that all three of these reagents could<br>
bind to the ECD of B7R.P-1. Similarly, all three reagents bound to the avidin fusion<br>
protein containing only the Ig1 domain, indicating that both ICOS and the blocking<br>
anti-B7RP-1 mAbs could bind to this region. In contrast, neither ICOS nor the anti-<br>
B7RP-1 mAbs could bind to the fusion protein containing only the membrane-<br>
proximal Ig2 domain. Thus, the ICOS, 16H, and 5D binding regions on B7RP-1 were<br>
located in the Igl domain.<br>
The antibodies generated as described above in Example 1 and tested for<br>
binding using the avidin fusion binding assay, could be divided into two epitope<br>
classes, H and D, as shown in Table 5. Of the 100 antibodies initially selected based<br>
on their ability to bind B7RP1, 15 failed to bind in the avidin fusion binding assay,<br>
most likely because of degradation.<br>

SNP identification and functional analysis<br>
One major single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant was identified in<br>
B7RP-1 that is present in the population with an allele frequency of 28.4% (Figure 7).<br>
The variant was identified within the mature protein coding sequence. A search of the<br>
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databank revealed a second<br>
potential SNP variant; the second variant was identified in a 1.5 individual (three<br>
chromosome) analysis. The first SNP variant (V128I) was located in the first IgV-<br>
like domain, whereas the NCBI SNP variant (L221F) was located in the second IgC-<br>
like domain.<br>
As discussed above, both the 16H and 5D monoclonal antibodies bind to the<br>
first IgV-like domain, this it is unlikely that the latter L221F variant affects either 16H<br>
or 5D mAb binding or function. Nonetheless, to determine if either of these SNP<br>
variants affects 16H or 5D binding and/or function, two different experiments were<br>
conducted. In the first set of experiments, avidin fusion proteins were constructed<br>
with the two SNP variants and tested for binding to 16H or 5D antibodies in the flow<br>
cytometric assay as described above. These representative mAbs from the H and D<br>
epitope classes bound to the SNP variants with similar efficacy as the wild-type<br>
B7RP-1 (Figure 9B). These data suggested that antibodies from both the H and D<br>
epitope classes bind to the B7RP-1 SNP variants.<br>
In the second approach, Fc fusion proteins were constructed using the B7RP-1<br>
SNP variant sequences and compared for the ability of these proteins to stimulate T<br>
cells in the plate co-stimulation assay (Figure 9C). Both the 16H and 5D antibodies<br>
inhibited co-stimulation mediated by the SNP variant Fc fusion proteins with similar<br>
EC50s as the wild-type fusion protein. Taken together these data indicated that the<br>
two potential B7RP-1 SNP variants were recognized by the antibodies of the<br>
invention. Thus, the antibodies of the invention can bind to target in patients<br>
containing these SNP variants.<br>

In vivo Animal Efficacy Models<br>
The ability of B7RP-1 antibodies to inhibit immune response was analyzed<br>
using a murinized rat anti-murine B7RP-1 monoclonal antibody (1B7V2) and<br>
challenging BALB/c mice with keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH).<br>
Generation of the murinized rat anti-murine B7RP-1 monoclonal antibody 1B7v2<br>
A Chinese-Hamster-Ovary cell line that overexpressed a full-length murine<br>
B7RP-1 was injected into rats as a primary immunization, and subsequently with a<br>
murine B7RP-1-Fc fusion protein to boost the immune response. Spleens were<br>
harvested 3 or 4 days post-intravenous boost and the splenic B cells fused with the<br>
Y3-Agl.2.3 rat myeloma line (ATCC CRL-1631). Cells were then selected in media<br>
supplemented with hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) for 2 weeks and<br>
subsequently single-cell subcloned by limiting dilution. These procedures are<br>
described in "Practical Immunology, 2nd ed." Leslie Hudson and Frank C. Hay;<br>
Blackwell Scientific Publications 1980.<br>
Genes encoding the 1B7 immunoglobulin were cloned from the 1B7 cell line<br>
using standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 2001, MOLECULAR CLONING: A<br>
LABORATORY MANUAL, 3d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring<br>
Harbor, N.Y). The isotype switch of the human anti-huB7RP1 MAbs was<br>
accomplished by cloning the variable region fragments containing XbaI and BsmBI<br>
restriction site cohesive ends into the pDSRa vector with the human IgG1 or huIgG2<br>
constant region which also had Xbal and BsmBI ends. For the 1B7 rat anti-muB7RP1<br>
the chimera was formed by a three step overlapping PCR process. The rat variable<br>
region was PCR amplified with a 3' primer that contained part, ~25-35 nucleotides, of<br>
the murine constant region. The murine constant region was amplified with a 5'<br>
primer that contained part, ~25-35 nucleotides, of the rat variable region. The two<br>
fragments were then used as template and the 5' rat variable region (Xbal containing)<br>
and the murine 3' constant region (SalI containing) primers were used to generate a<br>
complete light chain or heavy chain. The light chain and heavy chain PCR products<br>
were then digested with Xbal and SalI and cloned into pDSRal9. A total of 25µg of<br>
64<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
linearized DNA (12.5 μg pDC323B LC + 12.5 μg pDC324 HC) were transfected into<br>
CS-9 cells using electroporation and selected on DHFR-supplemented medium.<br>
To test the efficacy of the 1B7V2 mAb, plate co-stimulation assays were<br>
conducted with this mAb. The results were compared with other anti-murine B7RP-1<br>
mAbs (Figure 10A). As discussed above, 1B7 is the original hybridoma-produced<br>
mAb; two different preparations (labeled 1.33 and 7.4) were tested. 5E1 and 11G10<br>
were other anti-mB7RP-l monoclonals generated in the fusions described above.<br>
Finally, HK5.3 was a commercially-available anti-mB7RP~l (ebiosciences # 16-5985-<br>

The 1B7V2 mAb blocked T cell activation in this assay equal to or better than<br>
any of the other mAbs, and thus was selected as the surrogate therapeutic for further<br>
studies.<br>
Antigen Challenge in Mice<br>
Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) was purchased from Pierce<br>
Biotechnology (Rockford, Illinois). Dosing solution #1 (KLH 5mg/kg in 1mg/mouse<br>
ALUM) was prepared with equal parts of 2x ALUM (500mg of ALUM plus 50ml<br>
PBS (phosphate buffered saline)) and 2x KLH (2.0ml dH20 (RNAse-Free) mixed<br>
with 20mg of lyophilized KLH, brought to 20ml with 1x PBS). Dosing solution #2<br>
(KLH 1mg/kg in 1mg/mouse ALUM) was prepared with 1 part 2x KLH mixed with 4<br>
parts lx phosphate buffered saline.<br>
Female BALB/c mice were primed either with 1 mg/kg of KLH/alum and re-<br>
immunized on day 21 with 5mg/kg KLH only, introduced by intraperitoneal injection.<br>
Mice were treated by intraperitoneal injection with lB7v.2, the isotype control<br>
antibody (anti-AGP3 PB) or the vehicle (PBS) alone, starting on day 1 (one day prior<br>
to priming with KLH/alum) in a final volume of 200μl every 5 days.<br>
The mice were bled every 7 days retro-orbitally (approximately 200μl) to<br>
obtain approximately 50-100μl of serum for analysis of antigen-specific serum IgM<br>
(Figure 10B), IgG2a (Figure 10C), and IgG1 (Figure 10D). Both the isotype-control<br>
and vehicle-treated mice showed significant primary and secondary immune<br>
responses. The IgM response was not affected by treatment, whereas, blockade of<br>
65<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
B7RP-1-IC0S with 1B7V2 decreased both primary and secondary IgG2a and IgG1<br>
responses in a statistically-significant manner.<br>
IL-5 is a cytokine released by T cells in response to antigen stimulation that<br>
induces B cell differentiation and function. As the B7RP-1/ICOS interaction is<br>
believed to be critical for T-cell-dependent B cell function, measuring serum IL-5<br>
levels was used to determine if interdiction of the B7RP-1/ICOS axis was indeed<br>
affecting T cell function. As expected, blockade of B7RP-1 also inhibited antigen-<br>
induced serum IL-5 levels. Sera were harvested from the mice from the antigen<br>
challenge experiment outlined above 24 hours after the antigen challenge on day 21,<br>
and serum IL-5 levels were determined by ELISA. As shown in Figure 11, elevated<br>
IL-5 levels were detected in the test mice as early as 9 hours after challenge; levels<br>
began to decline by 48 hours and returned to baseline by 72 hours. Treatment of the<br>
mice with 1B7V2 mAb lead to a statistically significant repression of IL-5 levels at the<br>
24-hour time point.<br>
Example 11<br>
Binding to cynomolgus monkey B7RP-1<br>
To determine if the anti-hB7RP-1 mAbs also bind to cynomolgus monkey<br>
B7RP-1, flow cytometric staining experiments were conducted with the 16H mAb and<br>
B cells purified from cynomolgus monkeys and humans. As shown in Figure 12A,<br>
addition of fluorescently-labeled 16H to cyno B cells lead to staining, indicating that<br>
16H was indeed binding to cyno B7RP-1 (right panel). As expected, 16H also stained<br>
human B cells (left panel). In addition, 16H, 16Hg, and 5D were tested in plate co-<br>
stimulation assays using cyno T cells, cyno B7RP-1-Fc, and anti-CD3 mAb. As<br>
shown in Figure 12B, all three mAbs inhibited cyno B7RP-1-dependent cyno T cell<br>
activation, indicating that these mAbs functionally block the cyno ICOS-B7RP-1<br>
interaction.<br>
Example 12<br>
T-Cell Dependent Antigen Responses in the Cynomolgus Monkey Following<br>
Administration of the Anti-B7RP-1 Antibodies<br>
66<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
A cynomolgus monkey study was conducted with two anti-B7RP-1<br>
monoclonal antibodies, 16H and 5D, to assess the ability of these antibodies to inhibit<br>
a T-cell dependent B cell antigen response as determined by serum levels of antigen-<br>
specific antibody. Briefly, the anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and anti-<br>
tetanus toxoid antibody responses were examined following antigen challenge in the<br>
presence of B7RP-1 antibodies in the cynomolgus monkey.<br>
Test Article 1 was 16H and Test Article 2 was 5D. The Control Article was<br>
the vehicle for B7RP-1 antibody (0.01 sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 5% sorbitol, 0.004%<br>
Tween 20). Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) was purchased from Pierce<br>
Biotechnology (Rockford, Illinois).<br>
The KLH was prepared by reconstitution with sterile water to yield a 10<br>
mg/rnL stock solution. The stock solution was diluted with sterile water to yield a 1<br>
mg/mL dosing solution. Tetanus Toxoid used for these experiments was Super-Tet®<br>
Tetanus Toxoid w/Havlogen®, purchased from IntervetTM Inc. (Milsboro, Delaware).<br>
The dose level for these experiments was 75 IU (0.5 mL of 150 IU/mL).<br>
Table 6 shows the treatment group distribution of 28 cynomolgus monkeys.<br>
Table 6<br><br>
Test article doses were administered via intravenous injection to all animals on<br>
Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, and 50. Animals scheduled for necropsy in Groups 1-4<br>
(1/sex/group) received an additional dose on Day 57. Evaluation of immune response<br>
was conducted on all animals via immunization with KLH and tetanus toxoid antigens<br>
followed by blood sampling for antigen-specific immunoglobulins (IgM and IgG).<br>
Titer values were present following primary administration of both the KLH<br>
and tetanus antigens. For KLH, primary titer values ranged from 0 to 900 for both<br>
IgM and IgG. As the primary KLH challenge was administered prior to test article<br>
67<br><br>
WO 2007/011941	PCT/US2006/027862<br>
administration, no effect of the B7RP-1 antibodies was evaluated. For tetanus toxoid,<br>
primayry titer values ranged from 0 to 50 for IgM and from 0 to 4050 for IgG. There<br>
were no differences in the primary response to tetanus toxoid between the B7RP-1<br>
antibody groups and the control group.<br>
As expected, titer values for IgG were increased following secondary<br>
administration of both the KLH and tetanus antigens, when compared to the primary<br>
titer values. For KLH, secondary titer values ranged from 0 to 300 for IgM and from<br>
0 to 8100 for IgG. However, there was no evidence of inhibition of the KLH<br>
secondary response attributed to administration of the B7RP-1 antibodies.<br>
For tetanus toxoid, secondary titer values were below 50 for IgM and ranged<br>
from 1350 to 36450 for IgG. Results for individual animal and group mean values are<br>
presented in the Figure 13A (16H antibody) and Figure 13B (5D antibody) for Days<br>
53 and 57 following the secondary challenge with tetanus toxoid on Day 42.<br>
On Day 53, the number of animals reaching peak response was 3/4, 1/4, and<br>
1/4 at the 0.1, 1, and 8 mg/kg dose levels of 16H, respectively, and 1/4, 1/4, and 1/4 at<br>
the 0.1, 1, and 8 mg/kg dose levels of 5D respectively, compared to 2/4 control<br>
animals. Thus, in general, the number of animals reaching a high titer on Day 53 was<br>
reduced in the B7RP-1 antibody-treated groups. On Day 57, titer values were<br>
maintained in the control animals, while titer values for several of the B7RP-1<br>
antibody-treated animals declined from the Day 53 values. The number of animals<br>
with high titers on Day 57 was 0/4, 0/4, and 1/4 at the 0.1, 1, and 8 mg/kg dose levels<br>
of 16H, respectively, and 0/4, 0/4, and 0/4 at the 0.1, 1, and 8 mg/kg dose levels of 5D<br>
respectively, compared to 2/4 control animals.<br>
These results demonstrated that the two B7RP-1 antibodies 16H and 5D<br>
inhibited a T-cell dependent B cell antigen response in cynomolgus monkeys, as<br>
determined by serum levels of tetanus toxoid-specific antibody. In addition, the<br>
presence of the B7RP-1 antibodies was important for blockage of the B7RP-1-ICOS<br>
interaction during the primary response in order to detect an effect following the<br>
secondary challenge.<br>
These results and the results from Example 10 demonstrated that both the<br>
surrogate therapeutic and the therapeutic candidates blocked T and B cell- dependent<br>
immune responses in murine and monkey model systems, which indicated that<br>
68<br><br>

blocking this co-stimulatory axis may be efficacious in the treatment of B-cell-<br>
mediated diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), asthma, and<br>
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).<br>
