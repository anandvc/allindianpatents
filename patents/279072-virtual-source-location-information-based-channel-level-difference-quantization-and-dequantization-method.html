[DESCRIPTION]<br>
[Invention Title]<br>
VIRTUAL SOURCE LOCATION INFORMATION BASED CHANNEL<br>
LEVEL DIFFERENCE QUANTIZATION AND DEQUANTIZATION METHOD<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to Spatial Audio Coding (SAC) of a multi-<br>
channel audio signal and decoding of an audio bitstream generated by the SAC, and<br>
more particularly, to efficient quantization and dequantization of Channel Level<br>
Difference (CLD) used as a spatial parameter when SAC-based encoding of a multi-<br>
channel audio signal is performed.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Spatial Audio Coding (SAC) is technology for efficiently compressing a<br>
multi-channel audio signal while maintaining compatibility with an existing stereo<br>
audio system. In the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), SAC technology has<br>
been standardized and named "MPEG Surround" since 2002, and is described in<br>
detail in the ISO/IEC working document, ISO/DEC CD 14996-x (published on<br>
February 18, 2005 and hereinafter referred to as "SAC standard document").<br>
Specifically, the SAC approach is an encoding approach for improving<br>
transmission efficiency by encoding N number of multi-channel audio signals (N&gt;2)<br>
using both a down-mix signal, which is mixed into mono or stereo, and a set of<br>
ancillary spatial parameters, which represent a human perceptual characteristic of the<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/011157	PCT/KR2006/002824<br>
2<br>
multi-channel audio signal. The spatial parameters can include Channel Level<br>
Difference (CLD) representing a level difference between two channels according to<br>
time-frequency, Inter-channel Correlation/Coherence (ICC) representing con-elation<br>
or coherence between two channels according to time-frequency, Channel Prediction<br>
Coefficient (CPC) for making it possible to reproduce a third channel from two<br>
channels by prediction, and so on.<br>
The CLD is a core element in restoring a power gain of each channel, and is<br>
extracted in various ways in the process of SAC encoding. As illustrated in FIG. 1 A,<br>
on the basis of one reference channel, the CLD is expressed by a power ratio of the<br>
reference channel to each of the other channels. For example, if there are six channel<br>
signals L, R, C, LFE, Ls and Rs, five power ratios can be obtained based on one<br>
reference channel, and CLD1 through CLD5 correspond to levels obtained by<br>
applying a base-10 logarithm to each of the five power ratios.<br>
Meanwhile, as illustrated in FIG. 1B, a multi-channel is divided into a<br>
plurality of channel pairs, and each of the channel pairs is analyzed on the basis of<br>
stereo, and, in each analysis step, one CLD value is extracted. This is carried out by<br>
step-by-step use of a plurality of One-To-Two (OTT) modules, which take two input<br>
channels to one output channel. In each OTT, any one of the input stereo signals is<br>
recognized as a reference channel, and a base-10 logarithmic value of a power ratio<br>
of the reference channel to the other channel is output as a CLD value.<br>
The CLD value has a dynamic range between -∞ and +∞. Hence, to express<br>
the CLD value with a finite number of bits, efficient quantization is required.<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/011157	PCT/KR2006/002824<br>
3<br>
Typically, CLD quantization is performed by using a normalized quantization table.<br>
An example of such a quantization table is given in the SAC standard document (see<br>
page 41, Table 57). In this manner, because all CLD values cannot be expressed<br>
with only a finite number of bits, the dynamic range of the CLD value is limited to a<br>
predetermined level or less. Thereby, quantization error is introduced, and thus<br>
spectrum information is distorted. For example, when 5 bits are used for the CLD<br>
quantization, the dynamic range of the CLD value will be limited to the range<br>
between -25 dB and +25 dB.<br>

[Mode for Invention]<br>
Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described in detail. However, the present invention is not limited to the exemplary<br>
embodiments disclosed below, but can be implemented in various forms. Therefore,<br>
these exemplary embodiments are provided for complete disclosure of the present<br>
invention and to fully convey the scope of the present invention to those.of ordinary<br>
skill in the art.<br>
FIG. 2 schematically illustrates a configuration of a spatial audio coding<br>
(SAC) system to which the present invention is to be applied. As illustrated, the<br>
SAC system can be divided into an encoding part of generating, encoding and<br>
transmitting a down-mix signal and spatial parameters from an N-channel audio<br>
signal and a decoding part of restoring the N-channel audio signal from the down-<br>
mix signal and spatial parameters transmitted from the encoding part. The encoding<br>
part includes an SAC encoder 210, an audio encoder 220, a spatial parameter<br>
quantizer 230, and a spatial parameter encoder 240. The decoding part includes an<br>
audio decoder 250, a spatial parameter decoder 260, a spatial parameter dequantizer<br>
270, and an SAC decoder 280.<br>
The SAC encoder 210 generates a down-mix signal from the input N-<br>
channel audio signal and analyzes spatial characteristics of the N-channel audio<br>
signal, thereby extracting spatial parameters such as Channel Level Difference<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/011157	PCT/KR2006/002824<br>
9<br>
(CLD), Inter-channel Correlation/Coherence (ICC), and Channel Prediction<br>
Coefficient (CPC).<br>
Specifically, N (N &gt; 1) multi-channel signal input into the SAC encoder 210<br>
is decomposed into frequency bands by means of an analysis filter bank. In order to<br>
. split a signal into sub-bands of a frequency domain with low complexity, a<br>
quadrature mirror filter (QMF) is used. Spatial characteristics related to spatial<br>
perception are analyzed from sub-band signals, and spatial parameters such as CLD,<br>
ICC, and CPC are selectively extracted according to an encoding operation mode.<br>
Further, the sub-band signals are down-mixed and converted into a down-mix signal<br>
of a time domain by means of a QMF synthesis bank.<br>
Alternatively, the down-mix signal may be replaced by a down-mix signal<br>
which is pre-produced by an acoustic engineer (or an artistic/hand-mixed down-mix<br>
signal). At this time, the SAC encoder 210 adjusts and transmits the spatial<br>
parameters on the basis of the pre-produced down-mix signal, thereby optimizing<br>
multi-channel restoration at the decoder.<br>
The audio encoder 220 compresses the down-mix signal generated by the<br>
SAC encoder 210 or the artistic down-mix signal by using an existing audio<br>
compression technique (e.g. Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG)-4, Advanced<br>
Audio Coding (AAC), MPEG-4 High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding (HE-<br>
AAC), MPEG-4 Bit Sliced Arithmetic Coding (BSAC) etc.), thereby generating a<br>
compressed audio bitstream.<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/011157	PCT/KR2006/002824<br>
10<br>
Meanwhile, the spatial parameters generated by the SAC encoder 210 are<br>
transmitted after being quantized and encoded by the spatial parameter quantizer 230<br>
and the spatial parameter encoder 240. The spatial parameter quantizer 230 is<br>
provided with a quantization table, which is to be used to quantize each of the CLD,<br>
ICC and CPC. As described below, in order to minimize sound deterioration caused<br>
by quantizing the CLD using an existing normalized CLD quantization table, a<br>
Virtual Source Location Information (VSLI)-based CLD quantization table can be<br>
used in the spatial parameter quantizer 230.<br>
The spatial parameter encoder 240 performs entropy encoding in order to<br>
compress the spatial parameters quantized by the spatial parameter quantizer 230,<br>
and preferably performs Huffman encoding on quantization indexes of the spatial<br>
parameters using a Huffman codebook. As described below, the present invention<br>
proposes a new Huffman codebook in order to maximize transmission efficiency of<br>
CLD quantization indexes.<br>
The audio decoder 250 decodes the audio bitstream compressed through the<br>
existing audio compression technique (e.g. MPEG-4, AAC, MPEG-4 HE-AAC,<br>
MPEG-4 BSAC, etc.).<br>
The spatial parameter decoder 260 and the spatial parameter dequantizer 270<br>
are modules for performing the inverse of the quantization and encoding performed<br>
by the spatial parameter quantizer 230 and the spatial parameter encoder 240. The<br>
spatial parameter decoder 260 decodes the encoded quantization indexes of the<br>
spatial parameters on the basis of the Huffman codebook, and the spatial parameter<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/011157	PCT/KR2006/002824<br>
11<br>
dequantizer 270 obtains the spatial parameters corresponding to the quantization<br>
indexes from the quantization table. In analogy to the quantization and encoding of<br>
the spatial parameters, the VSLI-based CLD quantization table and the Huffman<br>
codebook proposed in the present invention are used for the processes of decoding<br>
and dequantization of the spatial parameters.<br>
The SAC decoder 280 restores the N multi-channel audio signals by<br>
synthesis of the audio bitstream decoded by the audio decoder 250 and the spatial<br>
parameters obtained by the spatial parameter dequantizer 270. Alternatively, when<br>
decoding of the multi-channel audio signals is impossible, only the down-mix signal<br>
can be decoded by using an existing audio decoder, so that independent service is<br>
possible. Therefore, the SAC system can provide compatibility with an existing<br>
mono or stereo audio coding system.<br>
The present invention is concerned with providing both the CLD<br>
quantization capable of minimizing sound deterioration resulting from quantization<br>
by utilizing advantages of the quantization of the VSLI representing a spatial audio<br>
image of the multi-channel audio signal. The present invention is based on the fact<br>
that, in expressing an azimuth angle of the spatial audio image, human ears have<br>
difficulty in recognizing an error of 3° or less. The VSLI expressed with the azimuth<br>
angle has a limited dynamic range of 90°, so that quantization error caused by<br>
limitation of the dynamic range upon quantization can be avoided. When the CLD<br>
quantization table is designed on the basis of the advantages of the quantization of<br>
the VSLI, sound deterioration resulting from the quantization can be minimized.<br>
 <br>

FIGS. 3A and 3B are views for explaining a concept of VSLI serving as a<br>
reference of CLD quantization in accordance with the present invention. FIG. 3A<br>
illustrates a stereo speaker environment in which two speakers are located at an angle<br>
of 60°, and FIG. 3B is a view in which a stereo audio signal in the stereo speaker<br>
environment of FIG. 3A is represented by power of a down-mixed signal and by<br>
VSLI. As illustrated, the stereo or multi-channel audio signal can be represented by<br>
the magnitude vector of a down-mix audio signal and the VSLI that can be obtained<br>
by analyzing the each channel power of the multi-channel audio signals. The multi-<br>
channel audio signal represented in this way can be restored by projecting the<br>
magnitude vector according to the location vector of a sound source.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B, assuming that power of a signal of the<br>
left speaker is PL, power of a signal of the right speaker is PR, and angles of the left<br>
and right speakers are AL and AR respectively, the VSLI of the sound source can be<br>
found by Equations 1 and 2.<br>
Equation 1<br>
 <br>
The VSLI calculated in this way has a value between AL and AR. PL and PR<br>
can be restored from the VSLI as follows: First, the VSLI is mapped to a value,<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/011157	PCT/KR2006/002824<br>
13<br>
VSLI', between 0° and 90° using a Constant Power Panning (CPP) rule, as in<br>
Equation 3.<br>
Equation 3<br>
 <br>
By using the VSLF mapped in this way and power PD of the down-mixed<br>
signal, PL and PR are calculated using Equations 4 and 5.<br>
Equation 4<br>
 <br>
As previously described, the subject matter of the present invention concerns<br>
applying the advantages of quantization of the VSLI to quantization of the spatial<br>
parameter, the CLD. In the stereo speaker environment of FIG. 3A, the CLD can be<br>
expressed as in Equation 6.<br>
Equation 6<br>
 <br>
The CLD can be derived from the VSLI according to Equation 7.<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/011157	PCT/KR2006/002824<br>
14<br>
Equation 7<br>
 <br>
Further, as defined in Equation 8 below, the CLD can be obtained by talcing<br>
the natural logarithm, instead of the base-10 logarithm, of the VSLI.<br>
Equation 8<br>
 <br>
The CLD values obtained by Equations 7 and 8 can be directly used as<br>
spatial parameters of a general SAC system.<br>
As previously described, because the CLD has a dynamic range between -∞<br>
and +∞, problems occur in performing quantization using a finite number of bits.<br>
The main problem is quantization error caused by limitation of the dynamic range.<br>
Because all dynamic ranges of the CLD cannot be expressed with only a finite<br>
number of bits, the dynamic range of the CLD is limited to a predetermined level or<br>
less. As a result, quantization error is introduced, and the spectrum information is<br>
distorted. If 5 bits are used for the CLD quantization, the dynamic range of the CLD<br>
is limited to between -25 dB and +25 dB.<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/011157	PCT/KR2006/002824<br>
15<br>
In contrast, because the VSLI has a finite dynamic range of 90°, such<br>
quantization error caused by limitation of the dynamic range upon quantization can<br>
be avoided.<br>
In one embodiment, upon quantization of the VSLI, if 5 bits are used for the<br>
CLD quantization and a linear quantizer is applied, the number of quantization levels<br>
is 31 and a quantization interval is 3°. The validity of the VSLI quantization<br>
approach can be verified from the fact that people fail to recognize a difference of 3°<br>
or less when recognizing the spatial image of an audio signal.<br>
The advantages of this VSLI quantization are applied to the CLD<br>

Further, a VSLI decision level for the VSLI quantization is decided by a<br>
middle value between neighboring quantization values. The middle value is<br>
converted into the CLD and used as a decision level of the CLD quantization. The<br>
VSLI-based CLD quantization decision level has a value other than the middle value<br>
between neighboring quantization values as seen in Table 2, unlike ordinary CLD<br>
quantization in which the decision level has the middle value between neighboring<br>
quantization values.<br>
FIG. 4 is a graph showing CLD quantization values converted from VSLI<br>
quantization values in accordance with the present invention. As illustrated, when<br>
quantizing the VSLI at a uniform angle on the basis of 45°, the decision level<br>
between the quantized angles is the middle value between two angles. However,<br>
when this VSLI decision level is converted into a CLD value, it can be found that the<br>
VSLI decision level has a value other than the middle value between two<br>
neighboring CLD values. Table 2 below lists the decision levels of the VSLI<br>
quantization and the corresponding CLD values.<br>

The CLD quantization value using the VSLI can be calculated by taking a<br>
base-10 logarithm or natural logarithm. When taking the natural logarithm, e rather<br>
than 10 is used as the base when spectrum information is restored by using the CLD<br>
value.<br>

Table 12<br>
VSLI-based CLD Quantization Decision Levels (Integer)<br>
 <br>
As shown in Tables 7 and 12, when the CLD quantization values and the<br>
CLD quantization decision levels are expressed as integers by taking the base-10<br>
logarithm, it can be seen that there is a problem that some of the CLD quantization<br>
values are identical to some of the CLD quantization decision levels. Hence, the<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/011157	PCT/KR2006/002824<br>
28<br>
CLD quantization values and decision levels using the natural logarithm are<br>
preferably used for actual quantization. In other words, when intending to use the<br>
VSLI-based CLD quantization table and the VSLI-based CLD quantization decision<br>
levels, both of which are expressed to the integer, the CLD quantization values are<br>
derived by taking the natural logarithm rather than the base-10 logarithm of the VSLI.<br>
The VSLI-based CLD quantization table created in this way is employed in<br>
the spatial parameter quantizer 230 and the spatial parameter dequantizer 270 of the<br>
SAC system illustrated in FIG. 2, so that sound deterioration resulting from the CLD<br>
quantization error can be minimized.<br>
Further, the present invention proposes a Huffman codebook capable of<br>
optimizing Huffman encoding of the CLD quantization indexes derived on the basis<br>
of the above-described VSLI-based CLD quantization table.<br>
In the SAC system, the multi-channel audio signal is processed after being<br>
split into sub-bands of a frequency domain by means of a filter bank. When the<br>
multi-channel audio signal is split into 20 sub-bands, a differential coding method is<br>
applied to a quantization index of each sub-band, thereby classifying the quantization<br>
indexes into the quantization index of the fist sub-band and the other 19 differential<br>
indexes between neighboring sub-bands. Alternatively, they may be divided into<br>
differential indexes between neighboring frames. A probability distribution is<br>
calculated with respect to each of the three types of indexes classified in this way,<br>
and then the Huffman coding method is applied to each of the three types of indexes.<br>
Thereby, Huffman codebooks described in Tables 13 and 14 below can be obtained.<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/011157	PCT/KR2006/002824<br>
29<br>
Table 13 is the Huffman codebook for the index of the first sub-band, and Table 14 is<br>
the Huffman code book for the other indexes between neighboring sub-bands.<br>

In this manner, the Huffman codebooks proposed in the present invention are<br>
employed to the spatial parameter encoder 240 and the spatial parameter decoder 260<br>
of the SAC system illustrated in FIG. 2, so that a bit rate required to transmit the<br>
CLD quantization indexes can be reduced.<br>
Alternatively, when the number of bits used for Huffman encoding of the 20<br>
sub-bands exceeds 100, 5-bit Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) coding can be<br>
performed on each sub-band.<br>
