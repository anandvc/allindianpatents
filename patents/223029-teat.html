				<td>TEAT<br>
The invention relates to a teat, in particular a pacifier for infants and young children.<br>
Pacifiers for infants or young children are commercially available in many different models<br>
and sizes. Such pacifiers generally have a body, a connector or shaft as well as a lip guard or mouth<br>
plate that is directly or indirectly connected with the shaft. Generally, the body and the shaft are<br>
manufactured from elastomers or rubber. The body as well as the shaft usually have a hollow air-<br>
filled cavity, which generally make these parts very bulky.<br>
It has been shown, that the use of pacifiers of this technological standard may lead to a<br>
malpositioning of the teeth as well as malformations in the jaw. However, if the infant / young child<br>
is not offered a pacifier, the infant / young child will often suck on a finger or other objects, which<br>
may generally lead to even worse malpositioning of the teeth, especially frontal or lateral<br>
malocclusion.<br>
DE 200 22 126 U1 describes a pacifier, which consists of a body, which may be inserted into<br>
the mouth, and a guard, which are manufactured in one piece. The body has the shape of a spoon,<br>
whereby the side of the body facing the mouth has a bulge.<br>
WO 98/02132 reveals a pacifier with a body and a shaft, whereby the shaft is used to fasten<br>
the body to the guard. The bubble-shaped body has a concave rounded recess, adapted to the shape of<br>
the tip of the tongue of a young child and aids to accommodate of the tip of the tongue. The<br>
disadvantage of this pacifier, lies in the fact, that the tongue is forced dorsally backwards into the<br>
mouth cavity due to the recess in the pacifier. It is therefore forced into a position, which contradicts<br>
the physiological position of the tongue during sucking or suckling, whereby the tongue is placed<br>
forward and upwards. This pacifier is hardly calming, because the child is neither able to suck nor<br>
able to suckle.<br>
FR-A-1 436 140 reveals a teat consisting of a shaft and a body. The body, which is inserted<br>
into the mouth, has a bulge directly following the shaft, which is continuous with the recess, which<br>
extends over the remaining length of the body, whereby the transition of the bulge to the recess<br>
functions as a tongue stop.<br>
From DE 201 00 392 U1 a teat is known, which also consists of a body and a shaft. In this<br>
known teat the hollow body is shaped approximately spherical and has a recess on the lower side for<br>
the acceptance of the tongue.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a teat, particularly a pacifier or a teat for the<br>
dispensation of food or liquid, which is beneficial from an orthodontic aspect, whereby it<br>
simultaneously encourages the infant / young child to even sucking as well as having a calming<br>
effect.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a teat, consisting of a body as well as a shaft,<br>
whereby the body is provided with a recess, which extends longitudinally along the length of the teat,<br>
wherein the recess, when viewed in a longitudinal section, ends essentially flat towards the front free<br>
end of the body and wherein the body is conically tapered towards the free front end, when seen from<br>
above. The pacifier of this invention has in particular a body and a shaft or connector respectively,<br>
whereby the body is provided with a recess in the extending longitudinally along the pacifier, and<br>
whereby the recess, when viewed in a longitudinal section, tapers off towards the free front end of the<br>
body.<br>
If the teat is shaped as a pacifier, it furthermore has a lip-guard or mouth-plate directly or<br>
indirectly connected with the shaft.<br>
The free front end of the pacifier is the end, which is positioned furthest from the shaft, when<br>
viewed in a longitudinal section. In other words, it is the end, which first reaches the mouth cavity,<br>
when the pacifier is inserted into the mouth. The difference in the technological standard to the<br>
invention described in DE 200 22 126 U1 is the fact, that the body therefore does not have the shape<br>
of a spoon with the in figure 2 of that publication shown strong curvature of the recess in the front<br>
area. Rather the longitudinal recess in the body of the pacifier according to this invention is formed in<br>
the shape of a shovel, i.e. with a stronger recess or a convex curvature in the rearward section, which<br>
tapers off shallowly or with an only slight curvature towards the front end. Therefore, there is no<br>
bulge in the front area of the body.<br>
The tongue of the infant or young child therefore does not experience a resistance during<br>
sucking or suckling and is not slowed. Rather the tongue is able to position itself in the direction of<br>
its physiologically normal position - up behind the upper front teeth.<br>
Due to the recess, a body with a reduced volume is achieved. Particular achievements are the<br>
reduced thickness in comparison to conventional pacifiers, both those with a hollow cavity as well as<br>
the solid version.<br>
Furthermore, the pacifier in accordance with the invention, which may be shaped as a pacifier<br>
as well as a teat for the dispensation of food and drink bottles, also consists of a body as well as a<br>
shaft, whereby the body has an lower side, which is essentially parallel to the longitudinal axis A of<br>
the teat. The body of the teat in accordance with the invention is therefore at least on its lower side<br>
flat, so that in this case also the tongue does not encounter a resistance. Because the body extends<br>
essentially in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the pacifier, the entire length of the body is in<br>
continuous contact with the upper surface of the tongue.<br>
In accordance with the preferred application form the maximum ratio between height h of the<br>
body and its length 1 is 0.7, preferably should be a maximum of 0.6 and particularly preferred is a<br>
maximum ration of 0.5. In the context of this invention, height is defined as the sum of the distances<br>
between the highest point of the body and the lowest point of the body in relation to the longitudinal<br>
axis of the pacifier. In this context the terms "up" and "down / low" are seen in relation to the<br>
position the pacifier takes on, when inserted into the mouth of an infant or young child.<br>
The pacifier shaped in accordance with the preferred shape therefore has a relatively flat body<br>
in relation with its longitudinal dimension. Therefore there is no excessively bulbous element in the<br>
mouth of the infant.<br>
Due to the shaping of the pacifier in accordance with the invention, the young child<br>
automatically inserts the pacifier in the correct position into the mouth cavity, which is a further<br>
advantage. If the pacifier were inserted upside down, i.e. with the recess pointing upwards into the<br>
mouth cavity, the body would press downwards onto the tongue, due to the curvature of the shaft or<br>
the connector, which would feel uncomfortable to the young child, who in turn would correct the<br>
position of the pacifier accordingly.<br>
The body and the shaft of the pacifier in accordance with the invention, both in the model<br>
with a hollow cavity as well as a solid model, are preferably formed as one piece. In other words they<br>
are seamlessly manufactured from the same material. The construction of the pacifier in accordance<br>
with the invention enables the forming of the body as well as the shaft with or without a hollow<br>
cavity.<br>
During the insertion of the pacifier into the mouth cavity of the infant or young child, the<br>
tongue automatically adapts to the recess and presses the body against the palate. The body,<br>
irrespective of the construction as a solid body or hollow cavity, adapts perfectly to the palate due to<br>
the recess in the body.<br>
Because it is possible to abstain from the hollow interior if need be, it is possible to<br>
manufacture a body and shaft of the pacifier in accordance with the invention with reduced volume,<br>
particularly with a reduced thickness, than most of the currently commercial available pacifiers. In<br>
accordance with a further application forms, the body and the shaft may be manufactured as two<br>
components, i.e. from different materials and connected with each other.<br>
The construction of these parts in accordance with the invention is especially recommended,<br>
because malpositioning of the teeth and / or jaw anomalies, such as the so-called "frontal<br>
malocclusion" may be prevented or reduced. This is the case, because the pacifier acts as if the thumb<br>
inserted into the mouth : as a foreign object between the rows of teeth of the upper and lower jaws.<br>
When such foreign objects exert pressure onto the teeth over prolonged periods of time, the position<br>
of the teeth may be altered. A prolonged pressure of about 0.25 newton per cm2 onto the surface of<br>
the root is sufficient to move the front teeth. As a rule these are protrusive (moved forward), whereby<br>
the pivot point is located in the upper third of the root. In addition, especially the upper front teeth<br>
may also be intruded (moved up into the jaw).<br>
Depending on the amount of movement, the jawbone may also be deformed. This causes the<br>
already mentioned malocclusion. Due to the smaller root surface in milk teeth, less permanent<br>
pressure is necessary to alter the position of the teeth. Due to the smaller root surface in milk teeth,<br>
less permanent pressure is necessary to alter the position of the teeth. Any amount of pressure inside<br>
the mouth cavity, i.e. between the rows of teeth, should therefore be minimised or altogether<br>
prevented.<br>
Because the recess extends essentially along the entire length of the body, it is made possible,<br>
that the tongue can move along the body towards the front into its natural position without<br>
encountering resistances, such as hollows or bulges. Due to the ability of free movement for the<br>
tongue the pressure on teeth and jaws is further minimised.<br>
Preferably, the shaft has an angled shape when viewed in a longitudinal section. The angled<br>
shape may either be executed as a sharp kink or as a curvature or bend. If the item is used as a<br>
pacifier, the shaft generally represents the connection between the lip guard and the body. If used as a<br>
teat the shaft is used as a teat the shaft generally forms the connection between the body and the body<br>
of the bottle or the hollow cavity of the body, which is preposed to the body of the bottle.<br>
In this design, starting from the lip guard the shaft runs first horizontally between the lips and<br>
the rows of front teeth of the upper and lower jaws, and then rises with a kink or a bend behind the<br>
upper incisors transverse upwards towards the palate. The body is therefore higher (i.e. cranial) than<br>
the theoretical horizontal axis between the exit point of the shaft from the lip guard and the body. The<br>
tern 'higher" is here defined as the position of the body if inserted correctly into the mouth cavity of<br>
the infant or young child. In this case the side with the recess is directed towards the tongue.<br>
Due to the angled shape of the shaft, the body is guided into the arch of the palate of the upper<br>
jaw and lies against the palate.<br>
The angled and considerably thinner shaft permits the maximum closure between the upper<br>
and lower incisors, which causes less interference in comparison to a horizontal shaft.<br>
The shape of the angled shaft follows the so-called sagittal anterior tooth step. This<br>
maximises the prevention or at least the reduction of the formation of the malocclusion caused by<br>
excessive sucking on pacifiers with a conventional shaft.<br>
Furthermore, the body automatically lies against the palate.<br>
As mentioned above, it is beneficial, if the body and particularly the shaft are shaped with the<br>
smallest possible dimensions. In this context, it has been shown to be beneficial, if the body is shaped<br>
so that its frontal end is conically tapered when seen from above or below. This enables a more<br>
comfortable insertion of the body into the mouth cavity of the infant or the young child.<br>
In accordance with a preferred design, the body and the shaft have a total length of about<br>
15mm to 32mm, especially preferred is a length of about 24mm to 28mm. Investigations have shown,<br>
that the increase in length and width of the part of the jaw relevant for sucking in infants or young<br>
children is virtually insignificant until the appearance of the milk teeth. The width increases in the<br>
later months of life by only a few millimetres, so that the mentioned range of lengths for the part of<br>
the pacifier used for sucking, i.e. the body plus shaft, are sufficient for all ages from infancy and early<br>
childhood during which a pacifier is used. The relatively short length of the body is rather similar to<br>
the mamilla of breast feeding women, which is generally between 5 mm and 15 mm long, with an<br>
average length of 11 mm.<br>
As mentioned above, the shape and size or strength of the shaft is of particular importance in<br>
the prevention of the formation of malpositions of teeth. In a cross-section, perpendicular to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the pacifier, the shaft generally has the shape of a rectangle with rounded corners<br>
or an elliptical shape. If the pacifier is inserted into the mouth cavity, the shaft extends from the lip<br>
guard, outside the mouth, towards the inside of the mouth cavity of the body, which is in contact with<br>
the palate. The shaft therefore extends between the upper and lower rows of front teeth. When the<br>
jaws are in a closed position, the teeth exert some pressure onto the shaft. It only requires a little<br>
movement to close the mouth before the front teeth react as a permanent pressure body onto the shaft.<br>
It is therefore beneficial to minimise the width and height of the shaft of the pacifier.<br>
On the other hand, the shaft may not be shaped randomly small and thin. Strict standards must<br>
be observed in the manufacture of pacifiers, which are published by the European Committee for<br>
Standardisation in Brussels. The standards contain in particular also the requirements for the strength<br>
of such pacifiers. Therefore, the nominal values for width and thickness of the shaft have been<br>
determined on the basis of mechanical strength.<br>
If possible the shaft has a width of about 3mm to 15mm, however a width between 3mm and<br>
13mm is preferable, particularly a width between about 7mm and 12 mm. Shafts of this width may be<br>
expected to achieve generally a sufficient mechanical stability or strength in commonly available<br>
pacifiers.<br>
The shaft should be as thin as technically possible considering technology of the materials and<br>
manufacturing technology. In any case however, all available standards for pacifiers and teats for<br>
infants and young children must be observed. The thickness of the shaft should not exceed 4mm, if at<br>
all possible. Here also the requirements for mechanical stability dictate the minimum limit.<br>
Depending on the material used, the thickness should be at least 0.5mm. Particularly preferred in<br>
practice is the range between about 1mm and 3mm for the thickness of the shaft. If the shaft has a<br>
hollow cavity, the thickness for the shaft is preferably between about 4mm to 6mm.<br>
Suitable materials for the manufacture of the body and / or shaft of the pacifier in accordance<br>
with the invention are vulcanisation products based on natural caoutchouc-latex, natural caoutchouc,<br>
or synthetic polyisoprene or blends thereof or even thermoplastic elastomers. These materials fulfill<br>
in particular the requirements imposed by the above-mentioned standard in regards to mechanical<br>
stability as well as in regards to tolerability. Of course as an alternative, silicone may also be used for<br>
the manufacture of the mentioned parts.<br>
It is furthermore possible, to manufacture the shaft from plastics, such as polypropylene. If the<br>
situation requires, a so-called high-performance plastic may also be used, to satisfy the requirements<br>
regarding the low dimensions combined with high resistance to mechanical stress.<br>
In order to impose a minimum resistance to the closing motions of the mouth, it has been<br>
proven to be beneficial, if the degree of hardness of the material for the body and the shaft is below<br>
50 Shore A, particularly between 30 and 45 Shore A, whereby the range between 35 and 45 Shore A<br>
is the most preferred. This level of hardness may be achieved by the use of rubber or elastomers as<br>
materials for the body and the shaft.<br>
The invention is described below with several designs with references to the accompanying<br>
drawings. The figures show the following details :<br>

teat for food bottles or drink bottles.<br>

Figure 8 : a longitudinal section through an adapted design of the body shown in Figure<br>
5; and<br>
Figure 9 : a cross-section through the body shown in Figure 8 along the axis IX-IX shown<br>
in Figure 8.<br>
As shown in Figures 1 to 3, the pacifier in accordance with the invention consists of a body<br>
(1), a shaft (2), which is connected to the backward facing end of the body (1), and of a lip guard (3),<br>
which is directly or indirectly connected with the shaft (2). The perspective shown in Figures 1 and 2<br>
show, that the body (1) is conically tapered starting from the backward end towards its free front end.<br>
This results in a certain streamlined shape of the body (1) in the direction of the sucking motion<br>
inside the mouth cavity.<br>
On the side of the body (1), which faces downwards during the use of the pacifier (compare<br>
the view from below in Figure 2), is a longitudinal recess (4), which extends along the entire length<br>
of the body (1). the shape of the recess (4) may best be seen in the three-dimensional view of Figure<br>
3. To insert the pacifier correctly into the mouth cavity it must be inserted in such a way that the<br>
recess (4) faces downwards, i.e. is directed against the tongue (caudal), and therefore in the position<br>
shown in Figure 3.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show clearly, that the body (1), has no bulge or similar structure at its free<br>
front end. Rather, the recess (4) tapers off flatly towards the front end of the pacifier, so that the<br>
recess (4) is shaped similar to a shovel. The tongue of the infant or young child is therefore able to<br>
move along the body (1) without encountering resistance.<br>
The shaft (2) is here provided with an angled form, which is shaped as a bend (2a), which<br>
causes the body (1) to be positioned above the exit point of the shaft (2) from the lip guard (3). The<br>
shaft (2) is therefore suitably pre-shaped, so that the body (1) is already positioned towards the palate<br>
without the need for any additional pressure from the tongue or the teeth. In accordance with an<br>
alternative design, however, the shaft (1) may also be straight.<br>
Figure (4) shows a longitudinal section of a further design of the teat, which is shaped as a<br>
teat for the dissipation of food or drink. The teat also is provided with a body (1), which is connected<br>
to a shaft (2). In contrast to the previously described design with reference to Figures 1 to 3, the teat<br>
does not have a lip guard. Rather the shaft (2) continues into a hollow cavity (5) in its rearward<br>
section, as is usual for teats. In this case the shaft (2) and body (1) may be shaped as a single unit.<br>
The length L shown in Figure 4 comprises the length of the body (1) as well as the shaft (2).<br>
The transition from the shaft (2) to the hollow cavity (5) is located at the point, where the lips of the<br>
child attach to the teat, when it is inserted into the mouth of the child. At the end, which is located<br>
opposite to the shaft (2), the hollow cavity (5) may be connected with a screw-ring or a pressure cap<br>
(not shown), with which the teat is attached to a container, such as a drinking bottle. Alternatively,<br>
the teat may be attached directly to the drink container.<br>
In the teat, the shaft (2) and the body (1) have a hollow interior cavity (not shown), which is<br>
continuous with the hollow cavity (5) and therefore also with the interior of the drink bottle.<br>
The body (1) of the feeding teat is also provided with a longitudinal recess (4), which tapers<br>
off towards the front end of the body (1) or as shown in the design example - tapers of with an only<br>
slight curvature.<br>
In accordance with a further design of this invention, the recess (4) may also be omitted, so<br>
that the lower surface of the body extends flat in the longitudinal direction of the teat. In this case, the<br>
ratio between height h of the body (1) and its length 1 is preferably maximal 0.6. As shown in Figure<br>
4, the height h is made up of the height h1 of the highest point above the longitudinal axis and the<br>
height h2 of the lowest point of the body below the longitudinal axis.<br>
Figures 5 to 7 show the body (1) and shaft (2) of a third design of a pacifier, which is similar<br>
to the one described in Figures 1 to 3. This third design also has a recess (4) on the lower side of the<br>
body (1), which extends from the front end near the lip guard (not shown) towards the free end (1a)<br>
of the body (1) and tapers off, as shown particularly in Figure 6 in the longitudinal section along the<br>
line VI-VI shown in Figure 5 through the body (1).<br>
Furthermore in this third design, the lateral edges (1b) of the body (1), which limit the recess<br>
(4) in the longitudinal direction, are pulled down, as is shown particularly shown in Figure 7, which<br>
shows the cross-section through the body (1) along the line VII-VII shown in Figure 6. The edges<br>
(lb), which are pulled downwards, are shaped in such a way, that they taper towards the margin<br>
(compare Figure 7). This tapering of the marginal edges (lb) achieves, that the teat is aligned inside<br>
the mouth cavity by the tongue during insertion into the mouth. On the other hand, the tapering<br>
margins of the body (1) offer a comfortable transition between the lower surface of the teat and the<br>
palate.<br>
Because the body (1) tapers towards the free end (la), on the one hand and the comfortable<br>
transition between the margines (lb) and the palate in the inserted teat on the other hand, the tongue<br>
is able to slide along the recess (4) without noticeable resistance, without inhibiting the natural<br>
sucking or suckling motion of the tongue.<br>
As shown furthermore in the section in Figure 6, the adapted design has a shaft (2) with a<br>
straight shaft-section (2b), which extends in the longitudinal direction A of the teat. The straight<br>
section (2b) of the shaft continues into an angled support-section (2c), which extends at a<br>
predetermined angle to the longitudinal axis of the straight shaft-section (2b). The angle, with which<br>
the support section (2c) is extended in relation to the straight shaft-section (2b), is chosen to align the<br>
upper and lower jaw or the upper and lower front teeth in their physiologically correct position<br>
towards each other and so, that they are supported by the support-section (2c), when the teat is held<br>
in the mouth.<br>
The angled support section (2c) continues into a shaft-transition (2d), which is also angled,<br>
however at a reduced angle in comparison to the angled support-section (2c). The length and<br>
inclination angle of this transitional section 2(d) are chosen to position the body (1) evenly along the<br>
palate when the teat is held in the mouth, without the need for any additional force from the tongue of<br>
the child onto the body (1).<br>
Figures 8 and 9 show a design adaptation of the third design shown in Figures 5 to 7, whereby<br>
Figure 8 shows a longitudinal section through its design adaptation which is equivalent to the<br>
longitudinal section shown in Figure 6.<br>
As shown in Figure 8, the shaft (2) in this design adaptation is equivalent to the shaft (2) in<br>
the third design and is also provided with a straight shaft section (2b), an angled support-section (2c)<br>
as well as a transitional section (2d), with which the shaft (2) continues into the body (1). Compared<br>
to the transition of the shaft (2) into the body (1) in the third design however, the body (1) is thicker<br>
in this design adaptation.<br>
Due to the increased material strength, a thickening in the shape of a saddle (1c) is formed at<br>
the lower side of the body (1). This saddle (1c) continues into the recess (4) on the lower surface of<br>
the body (1), which extends towards the free end (1a) of the body (1), whereby the recess (4) is less<br>
pronounced due to the saddle (lc) and has less depth, as shown in Figure 9, which shows a cross-<br>
section through the body (I) along the line XI-XT.<br>
The saddle (lc) achieves, that the tongue of the child presses the teat against the palate with<br>
only little force, and therefore retains its optimal position inside the mouth cavity for the suck and<br>
suckling motion of the tongue.<br>

18. A teat as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the shaft is manufactured from<br>
plastic.<br>
19. A teat as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the body is formed as a hollow<br>
body.<br>
20. A teat as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 18, wherein the teat is formed as a solid body.<br>
21. A teat as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the body (1) is provided with<br>
edges (1b), which have been laterally pulled down, which laterally delineate the recess (4).<br>
22. A teat as claimed in claim 21, whereby the edges taper off towards the end of the edge, when<br>
seen in the transverse section to the longitudinal direction of the body.<br>
23. A teat as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein a saddle-shaped rise (lc) is<br>
formed at the transition from the shaft (2) to the body (1) on the lower side of the body (1) and that<br>
this saddle is continuous with the recess (4).<br>
24. A teat as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the shaft (2) is angled several<br>
times and has a straight shaft section (2b) and a subsequent angled support-section (2c), which is<br>
tilted at an angle towards to the longitudinal direction of the straight shaft section (2b) as well as a<br>
transitional section 2(d), which is also at an angle to the support section (2c), with which the shaft (2)<br>
is connected to the body (1).<br>
25. A teat as claimed in claim 24, wherein the angle, with which the angled support section (2c)<br>
tilts relatively to the longitudinal direction of the straight shaft section (2b), is chosen in such a way,<br>
that the support section holds and supports the upper and lower jaw or upper and lower front teeth in<br>
a physiologically correct position relatively to each other.<br>
26. A teat as claimed in claim 24 or 25, wherein the angle, with which the transitional section<br>
(2d) tilts relatively to the longitudinal direction of the straight shaft section (2b), is chosen in such a<br>
way, that the body (1) lies evenly against the palate, when the teat is inserted into the mouth.<br>
27. A teat substantially as herein described with reference to any one of the embodiments of the<br>
invention illustrated in the accompanying drawings and / or examples.<br>
The invention relates to a pacifier, consisting of a body (1) and a shank (2). The body of the<br>
pacifier (1) is provided with a recess extending in a longitudinal direction of the pacifier. Said<br>
pacifier is configured in such a way that the recess (4), when seen from a longitudinal point of view,<br>
tapers off in an essentially flat manner towards the free front end (1a) of the body (1) of the pacifier.<br>
Preferably, the recess (4) extends along the entire length of the pacifier (1). Preferably, the shank (2),<br>
when seen from a cross-sectional point of view, has a bent shape. The pacifier is particularly<br>
advantageous when seen from a jaw orthopedic point of view since it simultaneously pacifies and<br>
causes the infant or young child to suck in an uniform manner.</td>
