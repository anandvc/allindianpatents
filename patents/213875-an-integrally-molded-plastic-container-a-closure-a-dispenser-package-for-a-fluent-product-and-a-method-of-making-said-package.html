In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1-3A. sidewail 34 is cylindrical throughout its length. However, it will be understood that, in accordance with this aspect of the invention, only the upper portion of the<br>
r I<br>
interior body that rotatably receives the closure need be round, preferably cylindrical'.  The lower portion of the body can be rectangular, oval or any other desired shape.  Top vvall 38<br>
tapers upwardly and inwardly* having an enlarged circular center opening 40 coaxial with the<br>
i<br>
axis of sidewail 34, and at least one circular opening 42 offset from the axis of the si<jewall a circumferenuaily continuous channel extends around sidewail adjacent to top w as best seen in f and center opening container wall is bounded defined by acircurnfercmially that axially upwardly from coaxialiy with terminates radially outwardly extending circumfereniiajly rib ot bead offset disposed raised plateau contiguous being connected thereto an tapering conical></jewall>
A closure 50 is rotatably mounted on container 32 to form dispenser package 30 Closure 50 includes a circular base wall 52 from which a peripheral skirt 54 integrally depends A circumferential array of axially extending ribs are formed on the outer periphery of skirt 54 for enhanced gripping to rotate closure 50 on container 32. Base wall 52 of closure 50 is parallel to and uniformly spaced horn top wall 38 of container 32. A circumferentially continuous rib or bead 56 extends radially inwardly from the free end of skin 54 remote from<br><br>
base wall 52, and is received by sliding snap fit within channel 43 on sidewall 34 A ar<:umferentia continuous annular wait depends from the central portion of closure base wall surrounding and bead in assembly a circumferennajly rib or projects radially inwardly free end is received by snap fit></:umferentia>
assembly beneath bead 44 on wall 41 A second annular wall 60 depends from base wall 52 of closure 50 spaced radially inwardly from wall 57 so as to be received in sliding engagement within the inside diameter of wall 41 and form a plug seal with respect to wall 41 A circular dispensing opening 62 is formed in closure base wall 52 at a position radially offset from the axis of closure 50 by. an amount corresponding to the offset of opening 42 in container top wall 38 from the axis of container sidewall 34 Opening 62 is surrounded and defined by an annular collar 64 that extends inwardly from closure base wall 52. The rounded free edge of collar 64 lies in a plane parallel to container top wall 38, as best seen in FIG 3A Opening 62 and wall 61 have an inside diameter corresponding to the outer diameter of conical wall 48 of plateau 46 in container top wall 38 A lug 66 is formed as a part-spherical depression in base wall 52 of closure 50 at a position radially offset from the axis of closure 50 by a distance corresponding to the radial offset of plateau 46 and opening 42 in container 32 The outer diameter of closure skirt 54 is the same -as the outer diameter of sidewall 34 so that thej closure* periphery blends with the container sidewall<br>
Container 32 and closure 50 preferably are of plastic composition of any [suitable<br>
l<br>
type,1 and may be formed in any suitable molding operation. It is presently preferred that container 32 be of polyethylene composition, and that closure 50 be of polypiibpylene composition. With closure 50 separate fiom container 32, container 32 is filled with'product through center opening 40 defined by wall 41 After filling, closure 50 is assembled to container 32 by snapping bead 58 of wall 57 over bead 44 of wall 41, and by snapping bead 56 of peripheral wall 54 into channel 43 of container sidewall 34.  For shipment and storage,<br><br>
closure 50 is circumferenually positioned with respect to container 32 such that depression 66 on closure base will 52 registers and aligns with dispensing opening 42 in container top wall 38, as shown in FIG. 3A, thereby closing the dispenser package. To dispense product from wiihm the package, closure 50 is rotated about the axis of container 32 Initial rotation cams depression 66 out of opening 42 and down conical wail 48 of plateau 46 as container top wall 38 flexes axiaily inwardly. Continued rotation brings the lower edge of wall 64 into carjiming engagement with conical wall 48 of plateau 46, whereby wall 38 is cammed downwardly until<br>
plateau 46 ahgns or registers with closure wall 64,  At this point, cooperative engagement<br><i if></i>
between plateau 46 on container top wall 38 and wall 64 on closure base wall 52 reliably locks the closure in posirion so (hat product may be dispensed from within the package by squeezing the side wall of comainer 34, The sidewall 34 of container 32 is sufficiently thin to permit such flexure, and leassumes the initial configuration illustrated in the drawings when the squeezing forces have been released. To close package 30, closure 50 is rotated in the opposite direction, initially flexing plateau 46 inwardly and moving closure wall 64 out of registry therewith, and subsequently again flexing plateau 46 inwardly and moving depression 66 into sealing iegistry with dispensing opening 42<br>
FIGS. 4-21 illustrate various modified embodiments of the invention, in which identical reference numerals indicate identical components, and reference numerals with a letter suffix indicate modified but functionally similar components FIGS 4 and 5 illustrate a dispenser package 70, which is basically similar to package 30 of FIGS 1 -3A except in the configuration of the dispenser opening 62a in closure 50a. Closure dispensing opening 62a has an axial portion defined by an annular closure wall 64a, and a portion 72 that extends radially through base wall 52a of closure 50a. Thus, product is dispensed radially,in the embodiment 70 of FIGS 4 and 5 through the peripheral wall 54a of closure 50a.<br><br>
FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate a dispenser package 74 in which dispensing opening 62b and detent depression 66b are on diametrically opposed sides of the axis of closure 50b, rather than at 90" spacing from each other as in the embodiments of FIGS. 1-5.  Top wall 38b of<br>
container Mb »m-hides an upwardly facing pocket 76 for registry with depression 66b in the<br>
upon µo*iuuu ol pocket l•\ illusltatcd lit f•'IG /, and foi icgistiy with wall G•lb tn the closed position of the dispenser Thus, both plateau 46b surrounding dispensing opening 42b in container 32b and pocket 76 cooperate with both depression 62b and annular wall 64b surrounding dispensing opening 62b in closure 50b releasably to lock the closure in both the dispensing and non-dispensing positions of the closure- Base wall 52b of closure 50b has a peripheral skjn 54b that is either spaced from or in sliding engagement with the opposed a**al surface of wall 38b. Thus, closure 50b is retained on container 32b solely by the interlocking beads 44, 58 at center opening 40.<br>
FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate a dispenser package 78 of generally oval cross section, as distinguished from the circular cross section of the dispenser packages illustrated in, FIGS. 1-7    Closure 50c is rotatabiy secured to annular wall 41 of container top wall 38c; in the<br>
manner previously described.  A resilienr check valve 80 is caprured by a ring 82 that snaps<br>
i<br>
into a beaded depression 84 rhat defines the dispensing opening in container top wall 38£. The<br>
i<br>
upper surface of valve-retaining ring 82 is flat.  A depression 66c is again formed in closure<br>
\ 50c at a position diametrically opposed to dispensing opening 62.  However, wall 64 dbfining<br>
dispensing opening 62, and depression 66 do not function as detent locking meansi&gt;jin this<br>
