				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an automatically quenching surge arrester<br>
arrangement and use of such a surge arrester arrangement. More particularly,<br>
this invention relates to the field of electrical protection of electrical devices<br>
from permanent damage due to dangerous voltage spikes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART<br>
Lightening strikes or other brief phenomena can result in dangerous voltage<br>
spikes occurring in electrical and electronic circuits, or on electrical cables,<br>
which are connected to exposed apparatuses such as radio antennas, and<br>
these can lead to permanent damage to the electrical devices or to a total<br>
failure. In order to render such voltage spikes safe, surge arresters of various<br>
designs and methods of operation have for a very long time been installed at<br>
suitable points on the device to be protected, which are non-conductive in<br>
normal circumstances but are switched through when dangerous overvoltages<br>
occur, equalizing out the potential differences that occur.<br>
One possible type of surge arrester is formed by voltage-dependent resistors,<br>
for example metal-oxide varistors (MOVs), which are connected between two<br>
conductors between which dangerous voltage spikes can occur. At normal<br>
operating voltages, the resistance of the varistors is high, so that only a small<br>
leakage current flows between the two conductors. When high voltage spikes<br>
occur, the resistance of the varistors<br><br>
decreases drastically, so that the desired equalization<br>
current can flow. However, problems result in the case<br>
of varistors when greatly increased leakage currents<br>
flow in them even in normal conditions as a result of<br>
internal changes, which load the circuit to be<br>
protected and can lead to changes in their operation.<br>
It has therefore already been proposed for a switching<br>
device which can be activated thermally to be connected<br>
in series with a varistor, which interrupts the current<br>
through the varistor as the varistor is heated as a<br>
result of a major leakage current, and, as a substitute<br>
for this, introduces a spark gap as additional<br>
overvoltage protection into the disconnected connection<br>
(US-A-4,288,833). The switching device which can be<br>
activated thermally is provided by an elastic switching<br>
arm which is soldered by one end to the varistor such<br>
that it is mechanically prestressed, and which produces<br>
an electrical connection to the varistor. When the<br>
varistor is heated severely as a result of excessive<br>
leakage currents, the solder of the soldered joint<br>
melts, and the electrical switching arm is lifted off<br>
the varistor by its prestressing, interrupting the<br>
current flow through the varistor. As the switching arm<br>
is lifted off, a spark gap comes into effect, which is<br>
formed between the varistor and the raised switching<br>
arm . or conductor tips which are provided specifically<br>
for this purpose. This surge arrester arrangement has<br>
the disadvantage that the change in the arrangement<br>
when the switching device is triggered is irreversible.<br>
The switching process of the surge arrester which is<br>
provided with an external short-circuit device, from<br>
the document DE-A1-197 31 312 is also irreversible, in<br>
the same way. If the surge arrester is heated<br>
excessively, two insulating spacers melt, so that an<br>
elastically prestressed short-circuiting bracket can<br>
short the two or three connecting contacts of the surge<br>
arrester and can thus take over . the current flow<br>
through the surge arrester.<br><br>
Another type of surge arrester is formed by gas capsule<br>
arresters, in which an overvoltage results in a gas<br>
discharge being triggered in a closed gas-filled<br>
capsule with two or three electrodes. These arresters<br>
are subject to the problem that, once a gas discharge<br>
has been triggered, it is maintained at a comparatively<br>
low burning voltage. If, for example, a supply voltage<br>
for remote electronics which is greater than or equal<br>
to the burning voltage, or a high RF power, is applied<br>
during normal operation to the gas capsule arrester<br>
which is installed in a circuit or cable, the gas<br>
discharge continues to burn after the occurrence of a<br>
triggering overvoltage spike, and loads the circuit or<br>
cable. Additional irreversible switching devices have<br>
also already been proposed for gas capsule arresters,<br>
which react to excessive heat being created in the<br>
arrester and then permanently interrupt the current<br>
supply to the arrester (US-A-4,051,546) or permanently<br>
short the arrester by means of a bypass (US-A-3,755,715<br>
or US-A-4,132,915). The thermally activated switching<br>
devices can be integrated in the surge arrester (see<br>
the abovementioned documents), although they could also<br>
be formed separately and can be thermally coupled to<br>
the surge arrester from the outside (US-A-4,275,432).<br>
Thermally activated, irreversible shorting devices are<br>
also known in conjunction with gas capsule arresters<br>
for coaxial cables (US-A-5,724,220, Figures 24 and 25).<br>
A reversible switching device for interruption of the<br>
discharge current through a gas capsule arrester is<br>
known from US-A-4,068,277. In this case, a separate<br>
contactor is provided, which is equipped with a<br>
bimetallic element, operates thermally and whose<br>
heating element is connected in series with the<br>
arrester. If a discharge, once it has been triggered,<br>
remains in existence for a certain time in the<br>
arrester, the contactor trips and interrupts the<br><br>
current through the arrester and one line. Once the<br>
contactor has cooled down again sufficiently after a<br>
relatively long time of, for example, 20-30 seconds, it<br>
automatically reconnects the current through the<br>
arrester and the one line, thus restoring the initial<br>
state. This solution has the disadvantage that a<br>
compact and space-saving arrangement is not possible,<br>
because of the separate contactor. Furthermore,<br>
interruption in one line is unsuitable for applications<br>
in which a supply current for other circuit parts is<br>
passed via the lines.<br>
Surge arrester arrangements which are integrated in a<br>
coaxial conductor arrangement for radio frequencies and<br>
therefore have to be suitable not only for very high<br>
frequencies but should furthermore also be physically<br>
compact, functionally reliable, robust and requiring<br>
little maintenance, are ' subject to particular<br>
requirements.<br>
Examples of coaxial conductor arrangements with an<br>
integrated surge arrester arrangement but without any<br>
additional switching device are disclosed in CH-A5-660<br>
261, EP-A1-0 855 756, or EP-A1-0 938 166 from the same .<br>
applicant. In order to allow the gas capsule arresters<br>
to be reliably switched to the non-conductive state<br>
even when a DC voltage or a radio-frequency signal is<br>
applied, in the case of a defect with surge arrester<br>
arrangements such as these, WO-A1-2004/032276 from the<br>
same applicant proposes an additional switching<br>
arrangement, which comprises an inductance, an<br>
electromagnetically operated interrupter switch, and a<br>
diode. This switching arrangement interacts with a<br>
series circuit comprising two identical gas capsule<br>
arresters. The configuration and method of operation of<br>
the arrangement can be found in the cited document.<br><br>
The switching arrangement which is known from WO-A1-2004/032276<br>
protects the gas capsule arrester reliably against continuous loading, and is<br>
automatically reconnected after quenching of the gas discharge in the gas<br>
capsule arresters. This arrangement has been proven in practice and can be<br>
integrated in coaxial conductor arrangements provided that they are designed<br>
from the start for this purpose.<br>
FR 2848353 (A1) discloses an overvoltage protection, provided with an electric<br>
current interrupter opened by a spring and held closed by a catch. When the<br>
temperature exceeds a threshold value a bimetallic strip adjacent to the<br>
overvoltage protection bends sufficiently away from the catch to allow the<br>
circuit to open.<br>
CH 660261 (A5) discloses a surge arrester arrangement which has a radially<br>
arranged threaded hole or the attachment of a hollow screw. The screw is<br>
located in a cylindrical housing which is provided with an external thread for<br>
screw connections. A conventional gas-discharge overvoltage suppressor is<br>
inserted into the hollow screw.<br>
However, there is an urgent need to have an automatically quenching surge<br>
arrester arrangement which can be used in particular over a broad bandwidth,<br>
is of simple design and can be produced at low cost, but which can also be<br>
retrofitted to existing coaxial conductor arrangements with an integrated surge<br>
arrester, as described in CH-A5-660-261, without having to make any physical<br>
modifications to the coaxial conductor arrangement itself.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is thus to create an automatically quenching, broad<br>
bandwidth and low-cost surge arrester arrangement, which is of simple and<br>
robust design, is highly functionally reliable, can be implemented in an<br>
extremely space-saving manner, and in particular can be retrofitted to existing<br>
coaxial conductor applications without physical modifications.<br>
This is achieved by the totality of the features of claim 1. The essence of the<br>
invention is to provide a switching mechanism which responds reversibly to the<br>
heat which is produced by the current flow through the surge arrester when a<br>
current flows through the surge arrester and interrupts the current flow<br>
through the surge arrester, and then automatically returns to its initial state<br>
again. In the simplest case, this can be achieved by purely electronic means,<br>
for example by<br><br>
using a resistor with a positive temperature<br>
coefficient (PTC) or a negative temperature coefficient<br>
(NTC) to monitor the heat in the surge arrester, and to<br>
interrupt the gas discharge as a result of its change<br>
in resistance.<br>
The switching mechanism preferably has switching means<br>
as well as operating means, which are thermally coupled<br>
to the surge arrester, for operation of the switching<br>
means, which operating means - in contrast to the<br>
melting soldered joints from the prior art - respond<br>
reversibly to the heat which is produced by the current<br>
flow through the surge arrester. The direct thermal<br>
coupling of the operating means to- the surge arrester<br>
allows the two to be physically combined, thus<br>
resulting in a very compact arrangement. The response<br>
of the operating means to the heat which is produced in<br>
the surge arrester ensures that the interruption is<br>
carried out with a certain delay and only when the<br>
arrester is actually subject to a continuous load. When<br>
the heating of the arrester decays again after the<br>
interruption of the current flow through the surge<br>
arrester, the operating means automatically return to<br>
their initial state, so that the surge arrester<br>
arrangement is ready for use again after a certain time<br>
delay.<br>
By way of example, memory metals or bimetallic strips<br>
may be used as the operating means, which change their<br>
shape as a result of being heated and either operate<br>
separate switching means or are themselves part of the<br>
switching means. One preferred refinement of the<br>
invention is distinguished in that the operating means<br>
have expansion means which convert the heat produced by<br>
the current flow in the surge arrester to a switching<br>
movement, by means of thermal expansion. The thermal<br>
expansion is a particularly simple, effective,<br>
functionally reliable and reproducible mechanism for<br><br>
the production of a switching movement, by means of<br>
which the current flow through the arrester can then be<br>
interrupted. When the surge arrester subsequently cools<br>
down again, the expansion is followed by a contraction,<br>
which returns it to the initial state.<br>
In principle, the thermal expansion of a gas, of a<br>
liquid or of a solid can be used. For simplicity and<br>
robustness, it is particularly advantageous, according<br>
to one preferred development, for the expansion means<br>
to have an expansion body composed of a solid material,<br>
whose thermal expansion on a first axis is used as a<br>
switching movement. This results in a linear switching<br>
movement which can be combined particularly easily with<br>
appropriate switching means. In particular, in this<br>
case, the thermal expansion of the expansion body on<br>
the first axis can be amplified by suitable shaping of<br>
the expansion body or by the expansion body material<br>
having an anisotropic behavior. One example of suitable<br>
shaping is an angled shape in the form of a toggle<br>
lever (acting in the opposite direction).<br>
The expansion body is preferably composed of a<br>
heat-resistant rubber-elastic material, in particular a<br>
silicone rubber or a fluoroelastomer, and the expansion<br>
body is preferably surrounded by a limiting element,<br>
which limits the radial expansion, and thus amplifies<br>
the axial expansion. The limiting body limits the<br>
thermal expansion radially with respect to the first<br>
axis, and results in considerable amplification of the<br>
expansion in the direction of the first axis as a<br>
result of the "quasi-hydrostatic" behavior of the<br>
expansion body.<br>
If, according to one development, the expansion body is<br>
in the form of a circular disk which is axial with<br>
respect to the first axis, and a hollow-cylindrical,<br>
coaxial, electrically and thermally insulating<br><br>
insulator sleeve, in particular composed of<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene, is provided as the limiting<br>
element, this makes it possible to prevent the heat<br>
which has flowed into the expansion body flowing away<br>
which is not wanted, as a result of the lateral limit.<br>
In principle, the current flow through the surge<br>
arrester can be interrupted by opening a<br>
series-connected switch or by closing a<br>
parallel-connected switch. The design of the surge<br>
arrester arrangement is particularly simple and compact<br>
if the switching means have a switch which is connected<br>
in series with the surge arrester and is closed in the<br>
initial state, and which is opened when the operating<br>
means respond to the heat which is produced by the<br>
current flowing through the surge arrester. However, it<br>
is also feasible within the scope of the invention for<br>
the switching means to have a switch which is connected<br>
in parallel with the surge arrester and is open in the<br>
initial state, and which is closed when the operating<br>
means respond to the heat which is produced by the<br>
current flow through the surge arrester.<br>
The switch preferably has two metallic contact<br>
elements, which are pressed against one another by a<br>
spring element and can be disconnected from one another<br>
against the pressure of the spring element, with one of<br>
the contact elements being connected to the surge<br>
arrester arrangement, in particular being soldered to<br>
it, and with the operating means and/or the expansion<br>
means being arranged between the two contact elements.<br>
The contact elements are surface-treated in order to<br>
prevent wear, in particular by being coated with<br>
silver.<br>
The surge arrester arrangement is very simple and is<br>
particularly suitable for use in coaxial<br>
radio-frequency cables when the surge arrester, the<br><br>
metallic contact elements, the spring element and the<br>
operating means and/or the expansion means are arranged<br>
one behind the other axially with respect to a first<br>
axis in a common housing, when the housing is<br>
electrically conductive and is used as a supply line to<br>
the surge arrester, and when contact springs are<br>
provided in order to make the contact with the housing.<br>
The metallic contact elements, the spring element and<br>
the operating means and/or the expansion means may in<br>
this case be arranged on one side of the surge<br>
arrester.<br>
However, the metallic contact elements and the<br>
operating means and/or the expansion means can also be<br>
arranged on one side of the surge arrester, with the<br>
spring element being arranged on the other side of the<br>
surge arrester.<br>
The housing may be in . the form of a housing which is<br>
open on one side and can be screwed in. However, it is<br>
also feasible for the housing to be in the form of a<br>
housing which is open on one side, and for connecting<br>
pins for insertion of the surge arrester arrangement<br>
into a printed circuit to be provided on the open side<br>
of the housing.<br>
The surge arrester is preferably in the form of a gas<br>
capsule arrester and has a cylindrical shape with<br>
electrical connections arranged on the end faces.<br>
According to the invention, a surge arrester<br>
arrangement in which the surge arrester, the metallic<br>
contact elements, the spring elements and the operating<br>
means and/or the expansion means are arranged one<br>
behind the other coaxially with respect to a first axis<br>
in a common housing, in which the housing is<br>
electrically conductive and is used as a supply line to<br><br>
the surge arrester, and in which contact springs are<br>
provided in order to make the contact with the housing,<br>
is used in a coaxial conductor arrangement.<br>
In particular, the coaxial conductor arrangement has an<br>
inner conductor which runs on a second axis and an<br>
outer conductor which coaxially surrounds the inner<br>
conductor, with the surge arrester arrangement being<br>
attached to the coaxial conductor arrangement with the<br>
first axis at right angles to the second axis, in<br>
particular being screwed to it, and with the housing<br>
being electrically conductively connected to the outer<br>
conductor, and with a second supply line to the surge<br>
arrester being electrically conductively connected to<br>
the inner conductor.<br>
Further embodiments are specified in the dependent<br>
claims.<br>

APPROACHES TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section through a coaxial<br>
conductor arrangement having a screwed-in surge<br>
arrester arrangement according to one preferred<br>
exemplary embodiment of. the invention. The<br>
configuration and external dimensions of the coaxial<br>
conductor arrangement 10 shown in Figure 1 are<br>
comparable to those of known gas capsule lightening-<br>
protection devices, such as those which are marketed by<br>
the same applicant and are used in particular in mobile<br>
radio base stations. Gas capsule lightening-protection<br>
devices such as these normally have an impedance of<br>
50 Q, can be used for frequencies up to several GHz,<br>
and can be loaded with single current pulses up to 30kA<br>
and . with multiple current pulses up to 20kA. Typical<br>
external dimensions are axial lengths of 100 mm and<br>
external diameters of about 30 mm. The invention allows<br>
gas capsule lightening-protection devices such as these<br>
to be fitted retrospectively with a switching device<br>
which is suitable for self-quenching, without any need<br>
to carry out significant modifications.<br>
The coaxial conductor arrangement 10 has a metallic<br>
outer conductor 11 (made from surface-treated brass or<br>
the like) which is used as a housing at the same time<br>
and has a stepped internal diameter, and an inner<br>
conductor which is composed of a plurality of inner<br><br>
conductor sections 12,..., 15. The inner conductor<br>
12,..., 15 is arranged and fixed coaxially in the outer<br>
conductor 11 by means of insulating holders 16, 17 in<br>
the form of disks. The inner conductor sections 14 and<br>
15 at the ends are in the form of slotted bushes and<br>
are part of screw-type plug connections. The outer<br>
conductor 11 has external threads 18, 19 on it for<br>
screw connection. The outer conductor 11 and its<br>
internal diameter are enlarged in a central section of<br>
the coaxial conductor arrangement 10. An inner<br>
conductor section 30 with a reduced external diameter<br>
is provided at the same time in this section. A<br>
threaded hole 23 is incorporated on one side (at the<br>
top in Figure 1) in the outer conductor and/or the<br>
housing 11 at right angles to the axis 35 of the<br>
coaxial conductor arrangement 10, and a surge arrester<br>
arrangement 2 0 according to the invention can be<br>
screwed into this threaded hole 23.<br>
The surge arrester arrangement 20 contains a<br>
(cylindrical) surge arrester 22 which is known per se<br>
and is in the form of a two-pole gas capsule arrester<br>
or gas discharge arrester, whose cylinder axis is<br>
located on the axis 34 of the surge arrester<br>
arrangement 20. Gas discharge arresters such as these,<br>
available for example from the Epcos Company, have<br>
response voltages from 70 V to several kV, and have an<br>
arc burning voltage of 10-30 V in the triggered state.<br>
The internal resistance in the triggered state falls to<br>
values of 
state) it is &gt; 1 GΩ. The capacitance is only a few pF,<br>
and this is particularly advantageous for RF<br>
applications. The external dimensions (length x<br>
external diameter) are in the order of magnitude of<br>
6 mm x 8 mm.<br>
The surge arrester 22 is held detachably in the surge<br>
arrester arrangement 20, and has two contact surfaces<br><br>
at the end, which are connected to the internal gas<br>
discharge path and are isolated from one another by the<br>
ceramic housing in between. The lower free end of the<br>
surge arrester 22 is seated in an insulating cup 21.<br>
Its lower contact surface rests on an electrically<br>
conductive connecting piece 24, which makes contact<br>
with the inner conductor section 13 through a hole in<br>
the bottom of the insulating cup 21.<br>
The surge arrester arrangement 20 illustrated in Figure<br>
1 is shown enlarged in Figure 2 in its own right. This<br>
has a housing 25 which is open at the bottom and holds<br>
the surge arrester or gas capsule arrester 22 (capsule<br>
holder housing) . On the outside, the housing 25 is<br>
provided with key surfaces and has a screw thread 32,<br>
by means of which it can be screwed into the threaded<br>
hole 23 in the outer conductor 11 (Figure 1).<br>
Initially, the housing 25 is also designed to be open<br>
on the other side, in order that the functional<br>
elements 22 and 26, ..., 31 accommodated in the housing<br>
can be introduced into the interior of the housing. A<br>
bolt 33 is then used to (permanently) close the upper<br>
opening.<br>
The surge arrester 22, a center contact 30, an<br>
expansion body 29, a contact disk 27 with contact<br>
springs 28 (which are fitted at the edge on the upper<br>
circumference and project upwards) and a spring element<br>
26 in the form of a spring washer are arranged one<br>
behind the other - from the bottom upwards - along the<br>
axis 34 of the surge arrester arrangement 20 in the<br>
housing 25. The center contact 30 has a base plate 40<br>
in the form of a circular disk, on which a cylindrical<br>
contact bolt 39 with reduced diameter is integrally<br>
formed pointing upwards. The external diameter of the<br>
base plate 40 is somewhat larger than the external<br>
diameter of the surge arrester 22. By way of example,<br>
the center contact 30 is composed of brass and is<br><br>
surface-treated, in particular by being coated with<br>
silver, in order to improve the contact characteristics<br>
and, in particular, in order to prevent wear.<br>
The expansion body 29 is in the form of a circular disk<br>
and is preferably composed of a heat-resistant,<br>
rubber-elastic material, in particular a silicone<br>
rubber or a f luoroelastomer. In the center, it has a<br>
coaxial hole 38, whose diameter is matched to that of<br>
the contact bolt 39 of the center contact 30. In the<br>
assembled state (Figure 2) the center contact 30 with<br>
the contact bolt 39 actually passes through the hole 38<br>
in the expansion body 2 9 to such an extent that, at the<br>
operating temperature, the end surface of the contact<br>
bolt 39 is adjacent to and flush with the upper face of<br>
the expansion body 29, and at the same time makes an<br>
electrical contact with the lower face of the contact<br>
disk 27, which is arranged above the expansion body 29.<br>
The circular contact disk 27 is likewise composed of<br>
surface-treated, in particular silver-plated, brass.<br>
The contact springs 28 which are fitted, distributed<br>
over the circumference, to the upper edge of contact<br>
disk 27, extend in the axial direction and are bent<br>
slightly outwards, make a sliding contact with the<br>
inner wall of the housing 25. The housing 25 is at the<br>
same time used as a supply line to the surge arrester<br>
22. In order to prevent the center contact 30 and the<br>
contact disk 27 from being shorted via the housing 25,<br>
the center contact 30 is surrounded on the outside by a<br>
coaxial insulator sleeve 31, which also surrounds the<br>
expansion body 29 and the lower part of the contact<br>
disk 27. The insulator sleeve 31 is in the form of a<br>
hollow cylinder and is composed of an electrically and<br>
thermally insulating, heat-resistant material,<br>
preferably of polytetrafluoroethylene. The insulator<br>
sleeve 31 has an outer projection 41 which engages<br>
behind an undercut in the housing 25. The center<br><br>
contact 30 with the base plate 40 is itself supported<br>
on an undercut 42 in the insulator sleeve 31. The surge<br>
arrester 22, whose upper contact surface is soldered to<br>
the base plate 40 of the center contact, is thus held<br>
in the housing 25.<br>
A spring element 2 6 is arranged between the upper face<br>
of the contact disk 27 and the housing 25 or the bolt<br>
34 and, in the illustrated example, is in the form of a<br>
spring washer, although it may also assume different<br>
shapes (cup spring, spiral spring or the like) . The<br>
spring element 2 6 and the axial dimensions of the<br>
individual components of the surge arrester arrangement<br>
20 are designed such that the contact bolt 39 and the<br>
contact disk 27 are pressed against one another, such<br>
that they make contact, by spring pretension in the<br>
normal state (at the operating temperature).<br>
The surge arrester arrangement 20 operates as follows:<br>
In the normal state, when the surge arrester 22 has not<br>
been triggered and the arrangement is essentially at<br>
the operating temperature, the switching contact which<br>
is formed by the center contact 30 and the contact disk<br>
27 remains closed. The surge arrester 22 is thus<br>
electrically conductively connected at its first end to<br>
the. inner conductor section 13, and at its other end<br>
via the elements 30, 27, 28 and the housing 25, to the<br>
outer conductor 11. If a lightening strike or some<br>
other brief voltage pulse which is greater than the<br>
triggering voltage of the surge arrester 22 is now<br>
applied to the coaxial conductor arrangement 10, the<br>
surge arrester 22 is triggered, and the potential<br>
difference is largely equalized. When the voltage<br>
falls, after the voltage pulse has decayed, back below<br>
the burning voltage of the surge arrester 22, the<br>
latter is quenched, and resumes the initial state.<br>
There is no significant heating of the surge arrester<br>
22 and thus of the expansion body 29.<br><br>
If, in contrast, a voltage which is above the burning<br>
voltage still remains on the surge arrester 22 even<br>
after the voltage pulse has decayed, with currents<br>
still flowing through the surge arrester 22, this<br>
current produces heat as a result of the internal<br>
resistance of the arrester, leading to heating of the<br>
surge arrester 22. The heat which is created in the<br>
surge arrester 22 flows axially via the base plate 40<br>
and radially via the contact bolt 39 of the center<br>
contact 30 into the expansion body 29, heats the latter<br>
and results in thermal expansion with a rapid radial<br>
outflow of the heat into the housing 25 being prevented<br>
by the thermally insulating insulator sleeve 31. In<br>
this case, the thermal expansion of the expansion body<br>
29 takes place virtually exclusively in the axial<br>
direction, because the expansion body 29 is bounded by<br>
the insulator sleeve 31 in the radial direction and the<br>
pressure which is created by this constriction acts in<br>
the axial direction owing to the "quasi-hydrostatic"<br>
material characteristics of the expansion body 29. This<br>
results in the expansion body 29 expanding axially by<br>
more than 3 times the isotropic expansion, thus<br>
representing a considerable amplification effect.<br>
Provided that a sufficiently high temperature of, for<br>
example, 100°C or more has been reached, the axial<br>
thermal expansion of the expansion body 2 9 between the<br>
two contacts 30 and 37 results in the two contacts<br>
being disconnected from one another, against . the<br>
pressure of the spring element 26. When the contacts 30<br>
and 27 are disconnected, the current flow through the<br>
surge arrester 22 and thus also 'the heat that is<br>
produced are interrupted (self-quenching). As soon as<br>
sufficient heat has flowed out of the expansion body 29<br>
again after the interruption and the expansion body 29<br>
has cooled down and contracted again, the switch which<br>
is formed from the center contact 30 and the contact<br><br>
disk 27 is closed again, and returns to the initial<br>
state.<br>
It is self-evident that the described switching process<br>
operates better the greater the thermal coefficient of<br>
expansion of the material used for the expansion body<br>
29. At the same time, however, the material should also<br>
be thermally resistant up to temperatures &gt; 200 °C and<br>
should have sufficient resistance to ageing. Finally,<br>
it should also have advantageous dielectric<br>
characteristics for use in the coaxial cable<br>
arrangement. The dielectric characteristics of the<br>
expansion body 29 are particularly important when the<br>
aim is to retrospectively install a switching device<br>
such as this in a coaxial lightening-protection device<br>
which is equipped with a surge arrester without a self-<br>
quenching switching device, as is advantageously<br>
possible in the case of the surge arrester arrangement<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Various measurements have been carried out in the<br>
laboratory with a coaxial conducting arrangement and a<br>
surge arrester arrangement as shown in Figure 1, using<br>
gas capsule arresters of the type described above with<br>
triggering voltages of 230 V and 90 V. Pulses of<br>
4 kV/2kA (in accordance with IEC 61000-4-5) resulted in<br>
capsule burning times in the order of magnitude of 10 s<br>
to 20 s, and reactivation times in the order of<br>
magnitude of 1-2 minutes.<br>
However, the surge arrester arrangement according to<br>
the invention may not only be advantageously used in<br>
conjunction with a coaxial conductor arrangement of the<br>
type shown in Figure 1, but can also be used whenever<br>
gas capsule arresters are used for over voltage<br>
protection. For example, it is normal practice to<br>
solder gas capsule arresters which are equipped with<br>
connecting wires or solder pins (see DE-Al-197 31 312)<br><br>
into printed circuits. Figure 3 shows a comparable<br>
surge arrester arrangement that has been modified<br>
according to the invention. The surge arrester<br>
arrangement 46 in Figure 3 has a surge arrester 22 in<br>
the form of a gas capsule, which is accommodated in a<br>
housing 43 which is open on one side. The series-<br>
connected switching device in turn comprises the center<br>
contact 30, which is soldered to the capsule 22, the<br>
expansion body 29, which is in the form of a disk, and<br>
a contact plate 36, and these items are isolated from<br>
the housing 43 by an insulation sleeve 31'. The<br>
switching device is in this case arranged underneath<br>
the surge arrester 22, while the contact springs 28<br>
with the contact disk 27 are located above the surge<br>
arrester 22. On one side (at the bottom), the surge<br>
arrester 22 is connected via central connecting means<br>
45 and the switch 30, 36. On the other side (at the<br>
top) , the connection is provided via the outer<br>
connecting means 44, the housing 43 and the contact<br>
disk 27 with the contact springs 28. The connecting<br>
means 44, 45 can advantageously be used for connection<br>
of the surge arrester arrangement 46 in a printed<br>
circuit.<br>
However, it is also feasible within the scope of the<br>
invention in the case of a surge arrester arrangement<br>
of the type illustrated in Figure 3 to provide axial<br>
(or also radial) connecting wires 37 on both sides,<br>
instead of the connecting means 44, 45 arranged on one<br>
side, as is shown in Figure 4. The surge arrester<br>
arrangement 46 can thus be provided with "flowing"<br>
wiring, that is to say it can be installed in any<br>
desired circuit.<br>
It is also feasible within the scope of the invention,<br>
instead of using the flat expansion body 29 in the form<br>
of a circular disk as described above, to use an<br>
expansion ' body which carries out an amplified thermal<br><br>
expansion movement by virtue of its special shape or<br>
the fact that its material has an anisotropic behavior.<br>
One example of a specially shaped expansion body is<br>
shown in Figure 5. The expansion body 4 8 in Figure 5<br>
uses the mechanical principle of a toggle lever by<br>
being formed either as a conically shaped disk or as a<br>
strip with a bend in the center. The outer edge of the<br>
expansion body 48 is supported on an opposing bearing<br>
47. Thermal expansion as indicated by the double-headed<br>
arrows in Figure 5 results, because of the special<br>
shaping, in a reverse toggle-lever effect, that is to<br>
say an amplified thermal expansion movement on the axis<br>
34 (arrow), which can advantageously be used as a<br>
switching movement.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
AUTOMATICALLY QUENCHING SURGE ARRESTER ARRANGEMENT AND USE<br>
OF SUCH A SURGE ARRESTER ARRANGEMENT<br>
The invention relates to an automatically triggering surge arrester arrangement<br>
(20) with a surge arrester (22) which, on exceeding a given first voltage,<br>
transforms from a non-conducting into a conducting state and returns to the<br>
non-conducting state only when a much smaller second voltage is dropped<br>
below and with a switch mechanism (26,..31), reacting to current flow through<br>
the surge arrester (22), interrupting the current flow through the surge arrester<br>
(22) and then automatically returning to the rest condition thereof. A simple,<br>
robust and compact assembly suitable for HF applications for such a surge<br>
arrester arrangement is achieved, whereby the switch mechanism (26,...31)<br>
reacts reversibly to the heat generated in the surge arrester (22) by the current<br>
flow.</td>
