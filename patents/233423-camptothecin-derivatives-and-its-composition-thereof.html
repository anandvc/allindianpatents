				<td>New analogues of camptothecin, their medical application and the pharmaceutical substances that contain them<br>
Camptothecin is a natural compound first isolated from the leaves and the bark of the Chinese plant known as camptotheca acuminata (see Wall et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 88:3888 (1966)). Camptothecin is a pentacyclic compound consisting of a quinoline indolizine [1,2-b] fragment merged with a 6-chain α-hydroxylactone. The carbon atom in position 20, which carries the a-hydroxy group, is asymmetrical and gives the molecule a rotatory capability. The natural form of camptothecin has the absolute "S" configuration at carbon atom 20 and has the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
Camptothecin has an inhibiting effect on the growth of many strains of cancer cells including those in human tumours of the colon, the lung and the breast (Suffness, M. et al.: The Alkaloids Chemistry and Pharmacology, Bross, A., ed., Vol. 25, p. 73 (Academic Press, 1985)). It is suggested that the growth-inhibiting action of camptothecin is related to its inhibition of topoisomerase I in DNA.<br>
It has been shown that the a-hydroxylactone is an absolute requirement for the activity of camptothecin both in vivo and in vitro (Camptothecins: New Anticancer Agents, Putmesil, M., and his colleagues, ed., p. 27 (CRC Press, 1995); Wall, M. and his colleagues, Cancer Res. 55:753 (1995); Hertzberg et al., J. Med. Chem. 32:715 (1982) and Crow et al., J. Med. Chem. 35:4160 (1992)). The present invention concerns a new class of analogues of camptothecin, wherein the natural α-hydroxylactone in camptothecin is replaced by a ß-hydroxylactone. The compounds according to the present invention show a powerful biological action that is unexpected in view of prior art.<br>
The subject of the invention is therefore new analogues of camptothecin which differ from any known derivatives of camptothecin in that they contain a ß-hydroxylactone (or its open hydroxycarboxylic form) in the place of an a-hydroxylactone (or its open hydroxycarboxylic form); or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the latter. The term derivative of camptothecin is taken to mean a compound having the same structure as camptothecin (in other words a quinoline indolizine [1,2-b] fragment which is merged with<br>
a 6-chain α-hydroxylactone), with or without other chemical substitutions on the structure. Different derivatives of camptothecin are well known to specialists, as described below. The term ß-hydroxylactone is taken to mean a lactone that comprises an additional carbon atom between the carbon of the carboxyl group and the a-carbon carrying the hydroxy group in the a-hydroxylactone.<br>
An analogue of camptothecin according to the invention may therefore comprise substitutions on the quinoline indolizine [1,2-5] fragment (for example to improve the solubility of the compound) or on the open or closed ß-hydroxylactone (for example in order to improve the stability of the compound). Typical substitutions on the closed ß-hydroxylactone comprise an alkyl substitution (for example ethyl) on the ¸ß-carbon. Typical substitutions on the open ß-hydroxylactone comprise alkyl substitutions on the ß-carbon, substitutions (for example, amidation) on the resulting carboxylic acid, and substitutions (for example, esterification) or eliminations of the resulting hydroxyl group. The subject of the invention is more particularly the compounds of the formula (I) and (II)<br>

As used here with reference to the alkyl, alkeylthio and alkoxy groups, the term "inferior" designates saturated, linear or ramified aliphatic hydrocarbon groups comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t-butyl, methylthio, ethylthio, methoxy and ethoxy. In referring to the alkenyl or alkynyl groups, the term "inferior" designates groups comprising 2 to 6 carbon atoms and one or more double or triple bonds, for example the following groups : vinyl, allyl, isopropenyl, pentenyl,<br>
hexanyl, ethynyl propenyl. propynyl and butynyl. The term "cycloalkyl" designates a cycle of 3 to 7 carbon atoms, for example the following groups : cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl. The term aryl designates a mono-, di- or tricyclic hydrocarbon compound with at least one aromatic ring, each ring containing a maximum of 7 links, for example phenyl, naphthyl, anthracyl, biphenyl or indenyl. The term halo signifies chloro, bromo, iodo or fluoro. The radicals corresponding to the expressions inferior haloalkyl, inferior cyanoalkyl, inferior nitroalkyl, inferior amidoalkyl, inferior hydrazinoalkyl, inferior azidoalkyl, inferior arylalkyl, inferior hydroxyalkyl, inferior alkoxy inferior alkyl, inferior alkylthio inferior alkyl, and inferior alkyl inferior sulphonylalkyl are substituted respectively by between one and three halo, cyano, nitro, amido, hydrazino, azido, aryl, hydroxy, inferior alkoxy, inferior alkylthio or inferior sulphonyl groups. The amino inferior alkyl radical may contain one or two inferior alkyl groups, and represent for example NHCH3, NHCH2CH3, N(CH3)2, ou N(CH3)(CH2CH3). Examples of [N=X] include the piperidinyl, morpholinyl, piperizinyl and imidazolyl groups.<br>
As is observed for camptothecin, the carbon atom carrying the hydroxyl function in ß-hydroxylactone or the P-hydroxycarboxylate group in compounds according to the present invention is asymmetrical. Consequently the compounds according to the present invention have two possible enantiomeric forms, that is, the "R" and "S" configurations. The present invention encompasses the two enantiomeric forms and all combinations of these forms, including the racemic "RS" mixtures. With a view to simplicity, when no specific configuration is shown in the structural formulae, it should be understood that the two enantiomeric forms and their mixtures are represented.<br>
Other objects of the invention are the processes for preparing compounds of general formula I and II, either from camptothecin or substituted camptothecins, or by total chemical synthesis.<br>
The invention therefore concerns a process for preparing compounds of formulae I and II according to the invention, and in particular the products whose formulae are shown above, starting from camptothecin or from substituted camptothecins, characterised in that<br>
- the α-hydroxylactone in camptothecin of general formula<br>

compound of general formula D<br>

Certain compounds of formula E can also be obtained by hydrolysing the ester function in compounds of the corresponding formula- D. The compounds of general formula E wherein R16 and/or R17 independently represent the hydroxy radical, can be esterified or amidified in conventional conditions familiar to the specialist in order to produce the corresponding esters or amides of formula E.<br>
In the above process, the groups R1, R2, R3 and R4 can be protected if necessary using the conventional protection methods (Greene, T., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 10-86 (John Wiley &amp; Sons 1981)). In this process, reduction is effected using a reducing agent in an appropriate solvent, for example sodium borohydride in methanol. The stage corresponding to the formation of compound B from compound A is effected in oxidising conditions, for example using lead tetraacetate, periodic acid or sodium metaperiodate in an appropriate solvent, for example acetic acid.   Treatment using a functionalised<br>
alkylating agent can be effected using a metal derivative, for example of lithium or zinc, a carboxylic ester in an anhydrous aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofurane. The lactonisation stage whereby compound D is obtained from compound C usually takes place in acidic conditions environment and can be effected, for example, by treatment by trifluoroacetic acid or hydrogen chloride dissolved in an anhydrous solvent such as dichloromethane or dioxane. The lactonic cycle of compound D can be opened to produce compound E for example by hydrolysis in alkaline conditions, followed by neutralisation.<br>
Examples of substituted camptothecins, used as starting substances, can be found in American patents Nos. 4 473 692, 4 604 463,4 894 956, 5 162 532, 5 395 939, 5 315 007, 5 264 579, 5 258 516, 5 254 690, 5 212 317 and 5 341 745, patent applications PCT Nos.

In the above process, the groups R, R2, R3,and R4 can be protected if necessary using the conventional methods of protection (Greene, T,M Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 10-86 (John Wiley &amp; Sons 1981)). The compound O is formed from the compounds of general formulae M and N by a process known to the professional as Mitsunobu's reaction (see Mitsunobu, O. et al., Synthesis, p. 1 (1981)). This involves displacing the hydroxyl function of the compound N by a nucleophile such as the compound M, or a deprotonated derivative of the latter, by a treatment with a phosphine, for example triphenylphosphine, and an azodicarboxylate derivative, for example diethyl azodicarboxylate, in an aprotic solvent, for example tetrahydrofurane or N,N-dimethylformamide. The compound O is cyclised preferably in the presence of a catalyst containing palladium (for example palladium diacetate) in basic conditions (provided for example by an alkaline acetate possibly combined with a phase transfer agent, for example tetrabutylammonium bromide), in an aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile or N,N-dimethylformamide, at a temperature between 50 °C and 120 °C (R. Grigg et al., Tetrahedron 46, page 4003 (1990)).<br>

-	the radical R22 in compound L is converted into a carbonyl, to produce the compound of<br>
general formula M<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
wherein Ri, Ris, R19, and R20 have the meanings indicated above.<br>
The carbonyl function of a 4-acyl-2-halopyridine (obtained for example according to Lamattina, J.L. J. Heterocyclic Chem. 20, p. 553 (1983)) is protected preferably by an acetal function, preferably a cyclic acetal, in the conventional conditions familiar to the professional (Greene, T., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 10-86 (John Wiley &amp; Sons 1981)). The intermediate product obtained in this way is treated by an alcoholate of sodium or potassium in an aprotic solvent (for example acetonitrile), or in the alcohol from which the alcoholate is derived, at a temperature between 0 °C and 100 °C to give the compound of general formula F. The said compound can be lithiated in position 3 by treatment by an aryl-lithium or alkyl-lithiura (for example mesityl-lithium) in an etherated solvent such as tetrahydrofurane at a temperature between -100 °C and 0 °C. To the intermediate lithiated product obtained in this way, a formylating electrophile such as N,N-dimethylformamide is added, and the aldehyde thus obtained, after hydrolysis, is treated by a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride to give the compound of general formula G. The alcohol function in the compound G is protected in a conventional manner familiar to the professional, to give a compound of general formula H. Examples of protective groups<br>
for the alcohol function comprise those that form ethers [that is, methyl, methoxymethyl, tetrahydropyranyl, 2-methoxyethoxymethyl, benzyloxymethyl, t-butyl, and benzyl (whether substituted or not)], and esters (that is, formate, acetate and isobutyrate). For other examples of protective groups for primary hydroxyls, reference may be made to Greene, T., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 10-86 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981). Removal of the protection from the compound of general formula H to give the compound of general formula F is carried out in selective conditions that maintain the integrity of the radical R23, for example by treatment in acidic conditions (for example using trifluoroacetic acid). The selective conditions for protecting and deprotecting functional groups are familiar to the professional (Greene, T., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 10-86 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981)). Treatment of the compound I' by a functionalised alkylating agent to give a p-hydroxy ester of general formula J can be performed using a lithium enolate or a zinc derivative of a carboxylic ester in anhydrous aprotic solvent, for example tetrahydrofurane. The protection group R23 on the compound of general formula J is removed to give a compound of general formula K, in conditions of protection removal familiar to the professional. For example, when R23 is a benzyl group, an alcoholic solution of the compound of general formula J together with a catalyst containing palladium can be exposed to an atmosphere of hydrogen at a pressure of 0.5 to 10 bar. The compound of general formula K obtained in this way can be cyclised in acidic conditions (for example by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid, or hydrochloric gas dissolved in an anhydrous solvent such as diehloromethane or dioxane) to give a 7-chain (3-hydroxylactonic cycle such as the compound of general formula L. The compounds of general formula L can be converted into pysidones of general formula M, for example by treatment with hot hydrochloric acid, or witth trimethylsilyl iodide.<br>
The 2-halo-3-quinoline-methanols of general formula N can be obtained from acetanilides of general formula P<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
wherein R2, R3 and R4 have the meanings indicated in the general formulae for compounds I and II. In the following processes, the groups R2, R3 and R4 can be protected if necessary by conventional methods of protection (Greene, T., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 10-86 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981)).<br>
The compounds of formula N can therefore be obtained using the following process : the said anilines of formula P are N-acetylated by treatment with an acetylating agent, for example acetic anhydride. The acetanilides thus obtained are treated at a temperature between 50°C and 100°C, for preference 75°C by a reagent known to the professional as Vilsmeyer's reagent (obtained by the action of phosphoryl oxychloride on N,N-dimethyl formamide at a temperature between 0°C and 10°C) to give the corresponding 2-chloro-3-quinoline carbaldehyde (see for example Meth-Cohn, et al. J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. I p. 1520 (1981); Meth-Cohn et al. J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. I p. 2509 (1981); and Nakasimhan et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc, 112, p. 4431 (1990)). The chlorine atom in position 2 of the 2-chloro-3-quinoline carbaldehydes can be substituted by iodine or bromine by heating the product in an inert solvent such as acetonitrile in the presence of a salt of iodine or bromine (for example sodium iodide or tetrabutylammonium bromide). A trace of acid such as concentrated hydrochloric acid may be necessary to catalyse this conversion. The 2-halo-3-quinoline carbaldehydes are easily reduced into the corresponding 2-halo-3-quinoline methanols of general formula N, in conventional conditions known to the professional such as treatment in an alcoholic solvent (for example, methanol) with sodium borohydride at a temperature between 0 °C and 40 °C.<br>
The compounds of formula N can also be obtained using the following process : the anilines of general formula P as defined above are acetylated by reaction with a nitrile (such as chloroacetonitrile or propionitrile) in the presence of boron trichloride and another Lewis acid such as aluminium trichloride, titanium tetrachloride or diethylaluminium chloride in an aprotic solvent or a mixture of aprotic solvents, followed by hydrolysis (see Sugasawa, T, et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 100, p. 4842 (1978)). The intermediate product thus obtained is then treated by ethyl malonyl chloride in an aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, then treated by an alkaline alcoholate, for example sodium methylate in methanol, to give an ethyl 2-hydroxy-3-quinoline carboxylate substituted in position 4. The latter is converted into ethyl 2-chloro-3-quinoline carboxylate by treating with phosphoryl oxychloride. When position 4 of the quinoline carries a chloromethyl group, a nucleophilic substitution can be made by treating with a secondary amine such as dimethylamine, N-methylpiperazine, morpholine or piperidine. The ethyl 2-chloro-3-quinoline carboxylate is then reduced by diisobutylaluminium hydride in an aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane to give the 2-chloro-3-quinoline methanol of general formula N. Analogues of the intermediate compounds (N) have been described in the literature and in particular in patent application PCT 95/05427.<br>
Another object of the invention, concerns, as new industrial products and particularly as new industrial products intended for preparing products of formula I or II, the products of formulae F and M as described above.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention can be prepared in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts using the usual methods.

Salts formed from bases such as sodium or potassium hydroxide also fall within the field of application of the present invention, when they are useable. Other examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be found in "Pharmaceutical Salts", J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1 (19771).<br>

The pharmaceutical composition may be in solid form, as for example powders, pills, granules, tablets, liposomes, capsules or suppositories. The pill, tablet or capsule may be coated with a substance capable of protecting the composition from the action of gastric acid or enzymes in the subject's stomach for a long enough period to allow this composition to pass undigested into the small intestine of the said patient. The compound can be administered locally, for example at the very location of the tumour.

14(4H,12H)-one<br>
Sodium borohydride (14 g, 370 mmol) is added in portions to a suspension of (S)-(+)-camptothecin (14 g, 40 mmol), that may be obtained using different commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI), in methanol (750 ml) and the resulting mixture is heated slowly to 55 ° C so as to obtain a limpid solution that is then agitated for 16 hours at ambient temperature. The solvent is then evaporated under reduced pressure, the residue is recovered in water (250 ml), neutralized by the addition of acetic acid (21 ml) and left at rest for 2 hours at 4° C. The resulting suspension is filtered and washed successively with cold water, acetoae and diethyl ether, which, after drying under reduced pressure, permits obtaining the sought compound in the form of a white solid (m.p. 280 °C).<br>
l.b.	8-formyloxymethyl-7-propionylindolizino [1,2-b] quinoline-9 (11H)-one<br>
A solution of sodium metaperiodate (14 g, 65 mmol) is added dropwise in water (140 ml) to a suspension of 4-ethyl-3,4-dihydroxy-lH-pyrano [3',4':6,7] indolizino [1,2b] quinoline-14(4H,12H)-one (13,4 g; 38 mmol) in glacial acetic acid (720 ml) and the resulting<br>
solution is agitated for one hour at ambient temperature. The reaction mixture is then poured into a mixture of ice/water (650 ml)#and the resulting suspension is agitated for one half-hour then filtered and washed successively with water, isopropyl alcohol, and diethyl ether, which, after drying under reduced pressure, produces the sought compound (11.5 g) in the form of a pale yellow solid m.p. &gt; 20 °C (d).<br>
I.e.	tert-buty ß-ethyl-ß-hydroxy-(8-droxymethyl-9-oxo(llH)-indolizino-<br>
[1,2-b] quinoline-7-yl)-propionate<br>
A zinc suspension (6.5g, 100 mmol) agitated with a magnetic agitator in anhydrous diethylether (50 ml) under argon, is activated, by dropwise addition of chlorotrimethylsilane (0.75 ml, 5.7 mmel). The reaction medium is agitated again 15 minutes at ambient temperature and then heated to reflux. The heating bath is then removed and tert-buiy\ bromoacetate (15 ml, 100 mmol) is added dropwise at a rate assuring the maintenance of reflux. The external heating is replaced and pursued again for one hour. The ethereal solution resulting flom the Reformatsky reagent is left to cool to ambient temperature then transferred, by means of a formula, into a suspension of 8-formyloxymethyl-7-propionylindolizino [l,2b] quinoline-9-(11H)-one (1.6g, 4.7 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (40 ml) under asgon. The reaction mixture is agitated at reflux for one hour, then left to cool to ambient temperature, and the reaction is stopped by adding saturated ammonium chloride (100 ml) and is extracted with chloroform (3 x 100 ml). The combined chloroformic extracts are dried on sodium sulphate, evaporated, and the residue is purified by gel chromatography on silica gel (1-2% MeOH/CH2Cl2), which makes possible obtaining 0.64 g of the sought-after compound (31 %) in the form of a pale yellow solid (m.p. 146-149 °C).<br>

Soc. 112, p. 4431 (1990), are used. 3,4-ethylenedioxyacetanilide (22 g, 113 mmol) is added to the Vilsmeyer reagent obtained by the dropwise addition of phosphoryl oxychloride (71 ml, 0.77 mol) to dimethylformamide anhydride (23 ml, 0.28 mmol), chilled in an ice-water bath and agitated for another 0.5 hour in an argon atmosphere. The resultant mixture is heated to 75° C for 16 hours. After cooling to ambient temperature, the reaction mixture is added to a mixture of ice and water (300 ml) and extracted with dichloromethane (5 x 200 ml). The combined organic extracts are dried on sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The solid residue is placed into suspension in dichloromethane (20 ml), filtered and dried under reduced pressure, which yields 10 g (35 %) of 2-chloro-6,7-ethylenedioxyquinoline-3-carbaldehyde in the form of a yellow solid (m.p. 222-224 °C). This intermediate is treated with sodium iodide (30 g, 0.2 mol) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (1.5 mlMn acetonitrile to reflux (150 ml) for 24 hours. After cooling to ambient temperature, the solvent is eliminated under reduced pressure and the residue is taken up in 50 % aqueous tefrahydrofuran (200 ml), filtered, washed with tetrahydrofuran and dried under reduced presure, which yields 12 g of 6,7-ethylenedioxy-2-iodoquinoline-3-carbaldehyde in the form of a yellow solid (m.p. 155-157 °C). This intermediate is treated with sodium boroh^dride (2 g, 52 mmol) in methanol at ambient temperature for 0.5 hour. The solvent is eliminated under reduced pressure and the residue is taken up in water and filtered. The resulting Solid is dried under reduced pressure in the presence of phosphorous pentoxide, which yields 11 g of (6,7-ethylenedioxy-2-iodoquinoline-3-yl)-methanol in the form of a yellow solid (m.p. 178-180 °C).<br>

[3',4':6,7]-indolizino [1,2-b] quinoline-3,15 (4H,13H)-dione<br>
A mixture of P-ethyl-P-hydroxy-(8-hydroxymethylindolizino[l,2-b]quinoline-9-(llH)-one-7-yl)-propionic acid (19.5 g, 52mmol) and L-(-)-α-methylbenzylamine (12.12 g, 100 mmol) in absolute ethanol (11) is carried to boiling, hot filtered and allowed to rest 68 hours. The precipitate is filtered and washed with ethanol and ether, yielding 9.8 g of a white solid. An analysis by high pressure affinity chromatography on the chiral phase ("HPLC chiral" on a Chiral-AGP column (Chromtech, Stockholm, Sweden) 100 x 4mm, 2 % acetonitrile eluant in a 10 mM at pH 6.9 phosphate buffer, eluant peaks at 4.5 and 7.5 min) reveals two peaks integrating respectively for 24 % and 76 % of the total surface of the two peaks. The solid is taken up in 93 % ethanol (350 ml) at reflux, then allowed to rest 48 hours. The precipitate is filtered, then washed with ethanol and ether to obtain 4.8 g of a white solid, giving two integrating peaks respectively for 9 % and 91 % of the total surface of the two peaks by chiral HPLC. The solid is taken up in 50 % ethanol (48 ml) at reflux then allow to rest for 48 hours. The precipitate is filtered, then washed with ethanol and ether resulting in 2.7 g of a white solid giving two integrating peaks respectively for 1 % and 99 % of the total surface of the two peaks by chiral HPLC. The resultant salt, diastereoisomerically enriched, is taken up in distilled water (20 ml) and treated with acetic acid (0.35 ml, 6.4 mmol) for 15 min. The obtained precipitate is filtered, washed with<br>
water, acetone and ether then dried in a vacuum at 80 °C resulting in 1.1 g of a white solid. The latter is taken up in absolute ethanol (55 ml) with concentrated hydrochloric acid added (11.5 N, 11 ml) resulting in a yellow solution which is agitated at ambient temperature for 68 h. The precipitate thus obtained is filtered and washed with water, ethanol and ether, then dried in vacuum at 80 °C resulting in 770 mg of enantiomerically enriched 5-ethyl-4,5-dihydro-5-hydroxy-lH-oxepino [3',4':6,7]-indolizino [l,2-b]quinoline-3,15 (4H,13H)-dione. An analysis by chiral HPLC (Chiral-AGP column, eluted by a 2 to 5 % gradient of acetonitrile in a l0mM ar pH 6.9 phosphate buffer, eluant peaks at 15 and 20 min) reveals an enantiomeric excess of 98 %. The procedure described above can be repeated replacing the L-(-)-α-methylbenzylamine by D-(+)-α-methylbenzylamine. The other enantiomer of 5-ethyl-4,5-dihydro-5-hydroxy-lH-oxepino [3\4':6,7]-indolizino [l,2-b]quinoline-3,15 (4H,13H)-dione is thus obtained.<br>

PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE PRODUCTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Test on DNA relaxation induced by topoisomerase 1<br>
All the reactions were performed in a 20 µl reaction buffer consisting of 50 mM of Tris-HC1 (pH 7.5), 50 mM of KC1, 0.5 mm of dithiothreitol, 10 mM of MgCl2, 0.1 mM of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 30µg/ml of bovine serum albumen and 300 ng of coiled pUC19 (Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France) with or without compounds to be tested at specific concentrations. All the compounds to be tested were initially dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) at 50 mM, the other dilutions being made using distilled water. The final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 1% (by volume). The reaction was initiated by adding one unit of topoisomerase 1 of purified calf thymus DNA (Gibco-BRL, Paisley, United Kingdom) and was carried out for 15 minutes at 37°C. The reactions were stopped by adding 3 µl of a mixture containing sodium dodecylsulphate at 1%, 20 mM of EDTA and 500 µg/ml of proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim, Meylan, France). After a further 30 minutes of incubation at 37°C, 2 µl of a buffer containing 10 mM of Na2HP04, 0.3% bromophenol blue and 16% Ficoll were added to the specimens which were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.2% agar gels at 1 V/cm for 20 hours in a buffer containing 36 mM of Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 30 mM of Na2HP04, 1 mM of EDTA and 2 µg/ml of chloroquine. The gels were stained with 2 µg/ml of ethidium bromide, photographed in UV light at 312 nm with a camera and the fluorescent intensity measured with a bioProfil camera (Vilber Lourmat, Lyon, France) in order to determine the percentage of relaxed DNA. Each experiment was performed at least three times and duplicated.<br>
In each experiment, the coiled plasmid DNA was incubated alone or with topoisomerase 1. The reaction was complete within 15 minutes. For each compound to be tested, or control, the coiled plasmid DNA was incubated in the presence of 500 µM of the compound to be tested with or without enzymes, plus the compound to be tested, at concentrations of 10 µM, 100 µM, 200 µM and 500 µM. As shown in table I, examples 2, 3, 4, 9, 10 and 11 inhibit the relaxation activity encouraged by the topoisomerase 1 in a manner that depends on dose.<br>

2. Tests on cell growth<br>
a. Eight strains of tumour cells were used in this study: L1210 (mouse lymphocytic leukaemia), HCT15 and LOVO (strains of human colon adenocarcinoma cells), A549 (human lung carcinoma), A172, U373 and U87 (human glioblastomas). All these strains were obtained from the American type culture collection (ATCC), Rockville, Md, United States. Cultures of L1210 cells in suspension were cultivated in a Dulbecco modified eagle medium (DMEM) (BioWhitaker, Verviers, Belgium) completed with 10% of foetal calf serum inactivated by heating, 2 mM of glutamine, 50 U/ml of penicillin and 50 fig/ml of streptomycin. HT29 cells were cultivated in single-layer cultures in a McCoy 5a medium (Gibco, Paisley, United Kingdom) completed with 10% foetal calf serum inactivated by heating plus 2 mM of glutamine and 50 µg/ml of gentamycin. The other cells were cultivated in an essential modified Earle medium (EMEM; Gibco, Paisley, United Kingdom) completed with 5% foetal calf serum inactivated by heat, 2 mM of glutamine, 50 U/ml of penicillin and 50 µg/ml of streptomycin. All these cell strains were cultivated at 37°C in a moistened atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.<br>
Inhibition of the growth of the strains of tumour cells was determined using an MTT test. 1500 L1210 cells in a culture medium (according to the cell medium requirements) were seeded in a well of a microplaque (tissue culture level:  96 wells, flat bottom) 24 hours<br>
before treatment with the compounds to be tested. For these dose-response investigations, the cells were incubated with each of the compounds to be tested or their corresponding solvent (controls) for 48 hours with a final concentration range of 1.10" to 1.10" . All the compounds were dissolved just before use in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 50 mM. Other drug dilutions were performed in the culture medium. The final concentration of DMSO never exceeded 0.2% (by volume). As controls, the solutions of drugs were replaced by the solvent that was diluted successively in the same way as the compounds under test.<br>
After the incubation period, the MTT marking reagent (3-[4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; Thiazol blue, Sigma M 565, Sigma, St Louis, MO, United States) was added at a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml to each well. The cells were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C in a moistened atmosphere. This stage allows the mitochondrial dehydrogenase in the living cells to convert the MTT yellow tetrazolium salt into crystals of purple formazan. The supernatant part was eliminated and the crystals of formazan formed were dissolved in DMSO. The resulting coloured solution was quantified by absorption at 570 nm using a scanning multi-chamber spectrophotometer. The growth data were expressed as a percentage of living cells in the wells treated, divided by the living cells in the controls. Each point represents the mean of three independent experiments, each experiment representing six determinations.<br>
For the other cell strains (HCT15, LOVO, A549, A172, U373, and U87), 1000 to 2000 cells were seeded in a well of a plate of microwells 24 hours before the drug treatment. They were incubated with each of the compounds to be tested or their corresponding solvent (controls) for 72 hours for a final concentration range of 1.10"    to 1.10" M.<br>
The results were expressed as percentages of growth calculated by the optical density (OD) of the cells treated with a drug divided by the OD of the control cells (cells treated with DMSO). As shown on table II, the compounds to be tested inhibited the growth of the cells in a manner that depended on dose.<br>

b. Nine strains of tumour cells were used in this investigation: PC3, DU145 (human prostate cells), MCF7 and MCF7-ADR (mammary cells, the symbol "ADR" was used to indicate that the cells have been made resistant to adriamycin), A427 (human lung adenocarcinoma), HT29 (human colon adenocarcinoma cells), T24s, T24r (human bladder cells, the T24r were resistant to adriamycin, amongst other things). The PC3, DU145 and A427 cells were obtained from the American type culture collection (ATCC, Rockville, Md, United States). The MCF7 and MCF7-ADR cells were provided gratis by Dr Jacques Soudon (Pharmacell, Paris, France). The T24s and T24r cells were given gratis by Dr Robert Kiss (Free University of Brussels, Belgium). HT29 cells were cultivated in single-layer cultures in a 4.5 g/1 DMEM medium (Gibco, Paisley, United Kingdom) completed with 10% of foetal calf serum inactivated by heat plus 2 mM of glutamine and 50 µg/ml of gentamycin (Gibco, Paisley, United Kingdom). The other cells were cultivated in an essential modified Earle medium EMEM at 4,5 g/1 (Gibco, Paisley, United Kingdom) completed with 10% of foetal calf serum inactivated by heat, 2 mM of glutamine (Gibco, Paisley, United Kingdom), 50 U/ml of penicillin and 50 u,g/ml of streptomycin (BioWhitaker, Verviers, Belgium). All the cell strains were cultivated at 37°C in a moistened atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.<br>
Inhibition of the growth of the strains of tumour cells was determined using a WST1 colorimetry test. Between 500 and 4000 cells in a culture medium (according to the cell medium requirements) were seeded in a well of a microplaque (96 wells, flat bottom) 24 hours before treatment with the compounds to be tested. For these concentration-response<br>
studies, the cells were incubated with each of the compounds to be tested or their<br>
-13 corresponding solvent (controls) for 72 hours in a final concentration range from 1x10<br>
to 1 x 10"   M.  All the compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) or in<br>
water for the water soluble compounds. The following dilutions of the compounds of the<br>
present invention were made in the culture medium such that the final concentration of<br>
DMSO, where the latter enters into the composition of the vector, was still 0.1% (by<br>
volume). As controls, the solutions of compounds were replaced by the solvent that was<br>
diluted successively in the same way as the compounds under test.<br>
After incubation, the WST1 marking reagent (4-[3-(4-iodophenyi)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2h-5-tetrazolio]-l,3-benzene disulphonate) (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) was added to a final concentration of 9% in each well. The cells were incubated for between 2 and 4 hours at 37 °C in a moistened atmosphere. This stage allows the mitochondrial dehydrogenase of the living cells to convert the WST1 orange tetrazolium salt into crystals of purple formazan. The resulting coloured solution was quantified by a double-beam reading (450 and 690 nm) using a scanning multi-chamber spectrophotometer.<br>
The results are expressed in the form of a window of concentrations, expressed as mol/litre, including the inhibiting concentration at 50% (IC50). They are shown on tables IIIA) and IIIB). The examples where the number is followed by an "s" correspond to the salts of the compounds. The abbreviations Cpt, Adr and Tpt represent camptothecin, adriamycin and topotecan respectively.<br>
