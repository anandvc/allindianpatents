BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
5	This invention relates generally to the production of power, and more particularly to<br>
an apparatus and method for generating power by utilizing the force of a flowing liquid.<br>
The need to generate power in times of crisis and the need to generate power from a relatively inexpensive resource have long been fell.  Inventors have tried for some time to create an apparatus and method that will generate power for little cost. The ability to 10      generate power from an inexpensive resource when access to traditional power, namely power supplied by a power company, is not available due to power shortages or natural disasters is needed.<br>
Also, in times when emergency power is not required, the ability to generate such power assists in preserving the environment by lessening the burden on power companies to 15      provide power, and the ability to generate power would save consumers money on monthly electric bills. The need to generate power from an inexpensive resource will become of even more importance as oilier more expensive resources of the world dwindle and disappear over the course of time.<br>
There have been attempls in the prior art to harness the kinetic energy of a flowing 20      liquid in order to generate power. However, these attempls arc either impractical, difficult to scale, difficult to distribute, awkward to use, or simply will not work. Therefore, an apparatus and method are needed thai generates power from a (lowing liquid,<br>

Particularly preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in the drawings, which illustrate a preferable apparatus and method for generating power from a flowing liquid.  Figure I .illustrates n preferred embodiment of die apparatus of Ihc present invention, The apparatus allows a flowing liquid, represented in direction of movement by 30      black arrows 10, to enter the apparatus through aperture 20, and the apparatus conveniently releases the (lowing liquid through npcrlure 30. The apparalus preferably comprises a control unit generally indicated by reference numeral 40,  The control unit is conveniently<br><br><br>
selectively operable between a first control unit configuration and a second control unit configuration for receiving the flowing liquid and selectively directing the flowing liquid to a first power unit aperture 50 when the control unit is in the first control unit configuration, and selectively directing the flowing liquid to a second power unit aperture 60 when the control 5      unit is in the second control unit configuration.<br>
A control unit operator 70 is preferably disposed in the control unit and suitably has ports 80 and 90 disposed in and through the control unit operator. The Control unit operator 70 is preferably selectively operable between a first control unit operator position 100 and a second control unit operator position 110. Suitably, when the control unit operator is<br>
10      disposed in the first control unit operator position 100, the control unit is in the first control unit configuration. Conversely, when the control unit operator is disposed in the second control unit operator position 110, the control unit is in the second control unit configuration. Preferably, when the control unit operator is disposed in the first control unit operator position 100, the flowing liquid is directed to the first power unit aperture 50, Conversely,<br>
15     when the control unit operator is disposed in the second control unit operator position 110, the flowing liquid is directed to the second power unit aperture 60. Conveniently, the control unit operator can be such devices as a slide valve or a piston.<br>
Preferably, the control unit 40 has a first control unit channel 120 arid a second control unit channel 130. Suitably, when the control unit is in the first control unit<br>
20      configuration, the flowing liquid is directed to the power unit through the first control unit channel 120 to the first power unit aperture 50, and when the control unit is in the second control unit configuration, the flowing liquid is directed to the power unit through the first - control unit channel 120 to the second power aperture 60. Conveniently, when the control unit is in the first control unit configuration, the flowing liquid exits the power unit through<br>
25      the second power unit aperture 60 to the second control unit channel 130, and when the<br>
control unit is in the first control unit configuration, the flowing liquid exits the power unit through the first power aperture 50 to the second control unit channel 130.<br>
The apparatus also preferably comprises a power unit, generally indicated by reference number 140. The power unit suitably includes a power chamber I 50 having the<br>
30      first power unit aperture 50 for receiving said flowing liquid from said control unit 40, and the second power unit aperture 60 for receiving a flowing liquid from said control unit 40.<br><br><br>
Conveniently, a power operator 160 is operable between a first power operator position 170 and a second power operator position 1 SO and is disposed within the power chamber I 50. The power operator 1 60 is suitably operatively configured so the power operator 160 becomes disposed in the first power operator position 170 when the control unit 40 is disposed in the first control unit configuration. Conversely, the power operator 160 becomes disposed in the second power operator position 180 when the control unit 40 is disposed in the second control unit configuration. The power unit may suitably be a piston.<br>
Preferably, a power transmission linkage, generally indicated by reference numeral 190 and herein illustrated by a rectangle representing any device used as a transmission known in the art, is operatively communicated with the power operator 160 for transmitting power as the power operator 160 reciprocates between the first power operator position 170 and the second power operator position 180.  As illustrated in Fig. 2, the power transmission linkage 190 may suitably comprise a rack and spur gear 200, a sprocket 210, a chain 220. an output power shaft 230, a timing gear 240, and a timing belt 250. Conveniently, a power generator 260, herein illustrated by a rectangle representing any device used to generate power known in the art, is operatively associated with the power transmission linkage 190. In a preferred embodiment, the power transmission linkage 190 is operatively communicated with the power operator 160 by a shaft 270.<br>
A compressed air generator, generally indicated by reference numeral 280, may also suitably be operatively associated with the power transmission linkage 190. As the power operator 160 reciprocates between the first power operator position 170 and the second power operator position 1 SO, a piston 290 operable between a first piston position 300 and a - second piston position 310 and contained in the compressed air generator 280 compresses air.<br>
The apparatus also preferably comprises a reversing unit 320 to adjust the control unit configuration to become disposed in the first control unit configuration when the power operator 160 becomes disposed in the second power operator position 180, and to adjust the control unit configuration to become disposed in the second control unit configuration when the power operator becomes disposed in the first power operator position 170.  Preferably, the reversing unit 320 adjusts the control unit configuration by selectively directing the flowing liquid to the control unit 40 through a first reversing unit channel 380 to a first control unit aperture 400 when die power operator 100 is in the firs! power operator position<br><br><br>
170 and through the first reversing unit channel 380 to the second control unit aperture 410 when the power operator 160 is in the second power operator position 180.<br>
Conversely, the flowing liquid exits the control unit 40 through the second control unit aperture 410 to the second reversing unit channel 390 when the power operator 160 is in 5      the first power operator position 170, and the (lowing liquid exits the control unit 40 through die first control unit aperture 400 to the second reversing unit channel 390 when the power operator 160 is in the second power operator position 180. Conveniently, the reversing unit 320 may be operatively communicated with the power transmission linkage 190 by a yoke 420 having a first strike 430 and a second strike 440.<br>
10	A reversing unit operator 330 is preferably disposed in the reversing unit 320 and<br>
suitably has ports 360 and 370 disposed in and through the reversing unit operator 330. The reversing unit operator 330 is preferably selectively operable between a first reversing unit operator position 340 and a second reversing unit operator position 350. Preferably, the reversing unit operator 330 adjusts the control unit configuration to become disposed in the<br>
15      first control unit configuration when said power operator 160 becomes disposed in (he second power operator position 180. Conversely, the reversing unit operator 330 adjusts the control unit configuration to become disposed in the second control unit configuration when the power operator 160 becomes disposed in the first power operator position 170. Conveniently, the reversing unit operator 330 may, among other things, be a slide valve or a<br>
20      piston.<br>
Figs. 3 through 11 illustrate the manner in which a preferred apparatus and method of this invention generates power from a (lowing liquid. The manner in which this preferred - apparatus operates may be explained by beginning at any of figs. 3 through Figs. 10.  For the sake of simplicity, the process is described beginning with Fig. 3, where the control unit<br>
25      operator 70 is disposed in the second control unit operator position 110. The (lowing liquid enters the apparatus through aperture 20 and passes through the control unit 40 and the firs! control unit channel 120 into second power unit aperture 60, forcing the power operator 160 to the second power operator position 1 80.  Upon reaching the second power operator position 180, the flowing liquid is directed through the reversing unit 320, the first reversing<br>
30      unit channel 380, and the reversing unit operator 330 to the second control unit aperture 4 10. Looking at Fig. 4, as the (lowing liquid enters the control unit 40 through the second control unit aperture 410, the control unit operator 70 begins to move towards the first<br><br><br>
control unit operator position 100, which forces the flowing liquid through the first control unit aperture 400 to the second reversing unit channel 390. The flowing liquid then exits the apparatus through port 30.<br>
In Fig. 5, the control unit is disposed in the first control unit configuration and the 5      control unit operator 70 has reached the first control unit operator position 100, forcing the flowing liquid entering the apparatus through port 20 to travel through the control unit 40 and the first control unit channel 120 to (lie first power unit aperture 50. This forces the power operator 160 to begin moving towards the first power operator position 170. As the power operator 160 moves towards the first power operator position 170, the flowing liquid exits the 10      power chamber 150 through the second power unit aperture 60 to the second control unit channel 130. The flowing liquid then exits the apparatus through aperture 30.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates the movement of the power operator 160 as the power operator is forced towards the first power operator position 1 70. As the power operator I 60 travels lo the first power operator position 170, the power operator forces the power transmission 15      linkage 190 (o move. This movement causes the power transmission linkage to transmit powcrto the power generator 260.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates (he movement of the reversing unit operator 330 towards the first reversing unit operator position 340. The power transmission linkage 190 contacts the first strike 430 of the yoke 420. As the power operator 160 moves towards the first power 20      operator position 170, the yoke 420 forces the reversing unit operator 330 towards the first reversing unit operator position 340.   The movement of the power transmission linkage 190 continues to cause the power generator 260 to generate power.<br>
In Fig. 8, the power operator 160 completely moves to the first power operator position 170, thereby causing the reversing unit operator 330 to move completely to the first 25      reversing unit operator position 340. As a result, the flowing liquid entering the apparatus travels through the first reversing unit channel 380 to the first control unit aperture 400. The flowing liquid forces the control unit operator 70 towards the second control unit operator position 1 10. As a result of the movement of the control unit operator 70, the flowing liquid exits the control unit 40 through the second control unit aperture 410 to the second reversing 30      unit channel 390.<br>
In Fig. 9, the control unit is disposed in the second control unit configuration and the control unit operator 70 is disposed in the second control unit operator position 110. This<br><br>
allows the flowing liquid to travel through the first control unit channel 120 to the second power unit aperture 60. Simultaneously, the power operator 160 moves towards the second power operator position 180, and flowing liquid is forced to exit the power chamber 150 through the first power unit aperture 50 to the second control unit channel 130.   As the 5      power operator 160 moves, the power transmission linkage 190 causes the power generator 260 to generate power.<br>
In Fig. 10, the power transmission linkage 190 contacts the second strike 440 of the yoke 420 as the power operator 1 60 proceeds towards the second power operator position 180. The movement of the power operator forces the reversing unit operator 330 towards the 10      second reversing unit operator position 350. At this point, the apparatus has complcled one full cycle, and the cycle begins again al Fig. 3.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates a preferred method of this invention. An act is preferably passing 500 the flowing liquid to a control unit selectively operable between a first control unit configuration and a second control unit configuration for receiving said flowing liquid. 15      Suitably, an act is directing 510., selectively, the flowing liquid fo a first power unit aperture: when the control unit is in the first control unit configuration, and selectively directing the (lowing liquid to a second power unit aperture when the control unit is in the second control unit configuration.<br>
Conveniently, an act is forcing 520 a power operator operable between a first power 20      operator position and a second power operator position and disposed within the power unit, to the first power operator position when receiving flowing liquid from the first power unit aperture and to the second power operator position when receiving flowing liquid from the - second power unit aperture.<br>
Preferably, an act is transmitting 530 power through a power transmission linkage 25      operatively communicated with the power operator as the power operator reciprocates between the first power operator position and the second power operator position.<br>
Conveniently, an act is directing 540 the flowing liquid to a reversing unit to adjust the control unit configuralion to become disposed in the first conlrol unit configuration when the power operator becomes disposed in the second power operator position, and to adjust the 30      control unit configuration to become disposed in the second control unit configuration when the power operator becomes disposed in the first power operator position.<br><br><br>
