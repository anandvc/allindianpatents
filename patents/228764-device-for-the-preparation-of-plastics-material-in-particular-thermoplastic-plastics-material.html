				<td>The invention relates to a device for the preparation of plastics material, in particular<br>
thermoplastic plastics material, with a receiving container for the material to be treated, the<br>
interior of the said receiving container having tools provided therein which are arranged on<br>
a carrier disc and which are driven by a shaft inserted into the interior for rotation about<br>
the, in particular vertical, axis of the shaft, and with at least one screw for removing the<br>
material out of the receiving container, the screw housing having a feed opening which is<br>
connected with respect to flow to a discharge opening in the receiving container, which<br>
discharge opening is situated at a lower level than the carrier disc and the tools carried by<br>
it, and further moved tools which convey the material into the discharge opening being<br>
provided in the receiving container below the carrier disc.<br>
A device of this type, known from WO 00/74912 A1, has proved highly successful for<br>
the preparation of plastics material, in particular thermoplastic plastics material, but it has<br>
been found that a blocking-in of the volatile substances released by the treated material<br>
occasionally occurs in the space below the carrier disc. It is not always possible for these<br>
volatile substances to escape upwards through the annular gap existing between the edge of<br>
the carrier disc and the inner wall of the receiving container, particularly since the material<br>
to be treated passes downwards from above through the said annular gap. It is particularly<br>
undesirable if the volatile substances are removed with the treated material out of the<br>
receiving container and arrive in the extruder which is attached directly or indirectly to the<br>
receiving container, since there is then a risk that inclusions of gas of various types will be<br>
present in the extruded material, and this substantially reduces the quality of the material<br>
contained at the outlet of the extruder. This risk cannot be entirely eliminated even by a<br>
de-gassing device generally provided in the extruder. In addition, volatile substances of<br>
this type cannot generally be prevented from the beginning, since they are water vapour,<br>
separation products of the material to be treated, gaseous or evaporated portions of coolant<br>
etc. In particular, in the case of moist plastics material introduced into the receiving con-<br>
tainer, these volatile substances can be substantial.<br>
The object of the invention is to avoid these drawbacks and, with little outlay, to make<br>
the material removed through the discharge opening of the receiving container at least sub-<br>
stantially free of the volatile substances mentioned above. This object is attained accord-<br>
ing to the invention in that the carrier disc comprises at least one aperture which is situated<br>
close to the axis and close to the trailing edges of the tools during the rotation of the carrier<br>
disc and which connects the space above it to the space below it. By means of the said<br><br>
aperture, the volatile substances present in the space below the carrier disc or at least<br>
formed there can escape upwards through the carrier disc into the space above it, where<br>
they are harmless and from where they can escape if necessary. In this case, it has been<br>
found from tests than apertures situated close to the axis are more effective than apertures<br>
situated at a distance from the axis. Such apertures situated at a distance from the axis are<br>
known from EP 625.373 A2 or DE 28 44 164 A, but are used there for the passage of<br>
crushed materials from the space above the disc to the space below it. In contrast thereto,<br>
the apertures according to the invention situated close to the trailing edges of the tools<br>
during the rotation of the carrier disc make use of the suction effect produced by the<br>
rotating tools in order to draw away the aforesaid volatile substances out of the space<br>
below the carrier disc.<br>
In accordance with a further development of the invention, it is advantageous for at<br>
least one of the apertures to be constructed with walls which extend at an inclination to the<br>
direction of the axis and to the plane of the carrier disc. This tends to prevent material<br>
present in the space above the disc from dropping down through the carrier disc. A similar<br>
effect can be achieved within the scope of the invention by a cover which is provided for at<br>
least one of the apertures and which covers the aperture all round apart from an opening<br>
directed towards the periphery of the carrier disc.<br>
The size of the apertures depends upon the quantity of the volatile substances to be<br>
removed. It has been found by tests that it sufficient for the cross-sectional area of all the<br>
apertures to be made at most as large as the cross-sectional area of all the screws of an<br>
extruder connected with respect to flow to the discharge opening of the receiving con-<br>
tainer.<br>
Further characterizing features and advantages of the invention may be seen in the<br>
description of embodiments of the subject of the invention, which are illustrated diagram-<br>
matically in the accampaying drawing.<br>

Fig. 2	is a plan view corresponding to Fig. 1, partly in section;<br>
Fig. 3	shows axonometrically the design of covers for the apertures;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further embodiment in a vertical section;<br>
Fig. 5	is a plan view corresponding to Fig. 4, partly in section, and<br>
Fig. 6 shows a detail in a vertical section through the carrier disc.<br>
In the case of the embodiment according to Figs. 1 and 2, the device has a receiving<br><br>
container 1 for the plastics material, in particular thermoplastic plastics material, which is<br>
to be treated and which is introduced into the said container 1 from above by means of a<br>
conveyor device (not shown), for example a conveyor belt. The plastics material supplied<br>
can be crushed and/or dried beforehand. The receiving container 1 is in the shape of a cup<br>
with vertical lateral walls 2 and it has a flat base 3 of circular cross-section. A shaft 4,<br>
mounted in a sealed manner, passes through the base 3 and has a vertical axis 8 which<br>
coincides with the axis of the container. The shaft 4 is driven by a motor 5 arranged below<br>
the base 3 and having a gear 6 for rotational movement. In the container 1 a rotor 7 and a<br>
carrier disc 9 arranged above it are connected to the shaft 4 in a rotationally fixed manner.<br>
The rotor 7 is formed by a circular cylindrical block, the axial extension h of which is sub-<br>
stantially greater than that of the flat carrier disc 9 but the radial extension d of which is<br>
substantially smaller than that of the carrier disc 9. In this way, a free space 10 is formed<br>
below the carrier disc 9 and communicates freely, with respect to flow for the treated<br>
material, with the space 26 situated above the carrier disc 9 in the container 1 by way of an<br>
annular gap 11 which is present between the periphery of the carrier disc 9 and the lateral<br>
wall 2 of the container 1. The treated plastics material can pass out of the space 26 through<br>
the said free annular gap 11 into the annular space 10 without obstruction. The carrier disc<br>
9 carries tools 21 which are arranged on its cover face in a fixed manner and which mix<br>
and/or crush and/or heat the material present in the space 26 in the container 1. For an<br>
effective crushing, the tools 21 are formed with cutter edges 22 which can be made curved<br>
or angled (Fig. 2) contrary to the direction of rotation of the carrier disc 9 (arrow 23), in<br>
order to produce a drawing cut. In operation, a rotation of the plastics material introduced<br>
into the container 1 takes place during the rotation of the carrier disc on account of the<br>
influence of the tools 21, the treated material ascending along the lateral wall 2 of the<br>
container 1 in the space 26 (arrows 24) and dropping down again in the region of the axis<br>
of the container (arrows 25). The mixing cone formed in this way swirls the material<br>
introduced, so that a good mixing effect is achieved. A small proportion of the material<br>
introduced into the container 1 and, if necessary, crushed there passes through the annular<br>
gap 11 into the space 10 situated below the carrier disc 9 and there it is acted upon by<br>
further tools 12 which are fastened to the rotor 7 in a pivotable manner by means of<br>
vertical pins 13 in annular grooves 14 in the rotor 7, so that the said tools can swing freely<br>
about the axes of the pins 13. The free ends of the tools 12 are situated at a distance from<br>
the lateral wall 2 of the container 1. On account of their beating action, these further tools<br>
12 result in an additional mixing and/or crushing and/or heating of the material present in<br>
the space 10. As a result of the centrifugal force exerted by the said tools 12 upon the<br>
material, the material is conveyed into a discharge opening 15 in the container 1, which<br>
discharge opening 15 is situated at the height of the additional tools 12 and connects the<br>
space 10 in the container 1 to a feed opening 27 in a screw housing 16, in which a screw 17<br><br>
is rotatably mounted. The screw 17 is driven at one of its end faces in a rotational manner<br>
by a motor 18 with a gear 19 and pushes out the plastics material supplied to it at the other<br>
end face, for example through an extruder head 20. It may be a single screw or a double<br>
screw. As may be seen, the screw housing 16 is attached substantially tangentially to the<br>
container, so that deflexions of the plastics material plasticized by the screw 16 [sic - recte<br>
17] in the region of its exit out of the housing 16 are prevented.<br>
Instead, the screw 17 can also be a conveyor screw only, which conveys the material<br>
prepared in the container 1 on for further use, for example to an extruder.<br>
In operation, after a brief start-up time a state of equilibrium is formed between the<br>
material removed by the worm and the material entering the space 10 from above through<br>
the annular gap 11. This has the result that it is highly improbable that a particle of plastics<br>
material introduced into the container 1 will arrive in the screw housing 16 without having<br>
first spent an adequate residence time in the container 1. This ensures that all the particles<br>
of plastics material are acted upon to a sufficient extent by the tools 12, 21, so that the<br>
material removed by the screw 17 has an at least approximately uniform nature, in particu-<br>
lar with respect to the temperature and the size of the particles of plastics material. This<br>
means that the plasticization action to be exerted by the screw 17 or the attached extruder<br>
screw is comparatively low, so that high thermal peak stresses upon the plastics material<br>
during the plasticization action are eliminated. As a result, the plastics material is spared<br>
and considerable savings are made in driving energy for the screw 17 or the extruder screw<br>
respectively.<br>
As mentioned, the material introduced into the container 1 is not completely dry as a<br>
rule and/or it has impurities which, during the processing in the container, release volatile<br>
substances, for example water vapour, separation products from the treated material, eva-<br>
porated coolant, volatile substances from inking and/or printing material etc. In order to<br>
prevent the said volatile substances from collecting in the space 10 below the carrier disc 9<br>
and thus obstructing the passage of the treated material from the space 26 into the space 10<br>
and/or penetrating into the interior of the screw housing 16, the carrier disc 9 has at least<br>
one aperture, and preferably a plurality of apertures 36, which connect the space 26 above<br>
the carrier disc 9 to the space 10 situated below it. As a result of the said apertures 36, the<br>
volatile substances blocked-in in the space 10 can escape upwards through the carrier disc<br>
9 and thus pass out of the container 1	or can be removed, for example by a<br>
suction means 34 (Fig. 4).<br>
These apertures can be formed by bores of circular cross-section. At least some of the<br><br>
said apertures 36 are arranged close to the axis 8 of the container 1, namely immediately<br>
behind the tools 21, so that the apertures 36 are situated adjacent to the trailing edges 37 of<br>
the tools 21 as viewed in the direction of rotation (arrow 23) of the carrier disc 9. The suc-<br>
tion effect produced by the tools 21 at their leading edges during their rotation assists the<br>
suction of the volatile substances upwards through the apertures 36. The axes of the aper-<br>
tures 36 can be arranged vertically, but it is more advantageous for the said axes 38 to be<br>
arranged obliquely (Fig. 6), namely in such a way that they are inclined both with respect<br>
to the plane of the cover face 39 of the carrier disc 9 and with respect to the axis 8 of the<br>
container. The inclination of the walls 40 of the apertures (angle a, Fig. 6) is advantage-<br>
ously between 30 and 60°, preferably approximately 45°. The said inclination is selected<br>
to be such that the inlet end 41 of each aperture 36 is situated further forward than the<br>
outlet end 42 as viewed in the direction of rotation of the carrier disc 9 (arrow 23). This<br>
step too assists the suction effect already mentioned and tends to prevent the material from<br>
dropping directly out of the space 26 through the apertures 36 into the space 10.<br>
In addition, it is advantageous to provide the apertures or at least some of them with a<br>
cover 28 (Fig. 3) which covers the aperture 36 all round apart from an opening 35 directed<br>
outwards in the direction towards the periphery 43 of the carrier disc 9 or directed radially<br>
(with respect to the axis 8).<br>
The size, i.e. the cross-sectional area of the apertures 36, depends upon the quantity of<br>
the volatile substances to be removed. As a rule, it is sufficient for the cross-sectional area<br>
of all the apertures 36 to be dimensioned as large as possible, such as the cross-sectional<br>
area of all the screws of the extruder connected with respect to flow to the discharge<br>
opening 15 of the container 1, or of the screws 17 respectively.<br>
The embodiment according to Figs. 4 and 5 differs from that according to Figs. 1 and<br>
2 above all in that the further tools 12 arc not suspended in a swinging manner, but are<br>
mounted rigidly on a further carrier disc 29 which is arranged coaxially with the carrier<br>
disc 9 and can be driven in a rotating manner by way of the same shaft 4. As a result, the<br>
rotor 7 can be made narrower or can be dispensed with entirely as an extension of the shaft<br>
4. As in the case of the embodiment according to Figs. 1 and 2, the lower tools 12 are<br>
arranged at the level of the discharge opening 15 in the container 1, in order to be able to<br>
convey the treated plastics material present in the space 10 into the feed opening 27 in the<br>
screw casing 16 in an effective manner.<br>
It is advisable to monitor the temperature of the material treated in the container 1. To<br>
this end, as shown in Fig. 4, a temperature-measuring unit 30 and a cooling device 33 are<br><br>
provided in the upper cutter space 26 (above the carrier disc 9), it being possible for the<br>
said cooling device 33 to be designed in the form of a coolant-spraying means. A similar<br>
temperature-measuring device 31 and a similar coolant supply 32 (Fig. 5) can be provided<br>
for the space 10 situated below the carrier disc 9.<br>
As already mentioned, the removal of the volatile substances entering the upper cutter<br>
space 26 can be assisted by a suction means. To this end, it is possible, as shown in Fig. 4,<br>
for a suction device 34 to be provided above the mixing cone formed in the said cutter<br>
space 26.<br><br>
