A refrigerator with a coo) air dispersing device<br>
Background of the invention<br>
1.	Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator, more specifically to ;i refrigerator including a main body housing a fresh food compartment, and a coo! air duct provided in a wall of the fresh food comparlment and havinj^ cool air discharge openings oiiened toward the fresh food compartmcTU to supply a cool air from an evaiwralor into the fresh food compartment.<br>
2.	Prior An<br>
As described in Fig. 1, a conventional refrigerator has a thennally insulated main body 4 housing a freezing compartment 2 and a fresh food compartment 3 separated with each other by a partitioning wall ], as well as a freezing compartment door 6 and a fresh food compartment door 7 which open/close the freezing compartment 2 and the fresh food compartment 3 respectively. In the main body 4 of Che refrigerator is installed a refrigeration system consisting of a compressor II, a condensertnot shown), an evaporator I2a for the freezing compartment 2 and an evaporator r2b for the fresh food compartment 3. A cool air produced at each evaporator 12a. 12b is directed toward the freezing compartment 2 and fresh food compartment 3 by means of the freezing compartment fan l3a or the fresh food compartment fan I3b.<br>
In the b;ick wall of the fresh food comparlmenl 3 is disposed a copl air duct 15 guiding the cool air from the fresh food compartment  fan  13b	The cool<br><br>
air duel J5 has cool air discharging opening  16 facing the interior of (he fresh food comjjartnient 3 through which the cool air is	provided to the compartment. 'A.    A  control   damper   19 closing/opening   the  entrance   of  the  cool   air  dnci   15   is provided at the entrance of the cool air duct 15 in order to control Ihe amount of cool air blown into the fresh food comparimenl 3,<br>
In the typical refrigerators, the cooi air for the fresh food compartment 3 is generally delivered in a so-called shelf-by-shelf fashion as illustrated in Fig. 2, In a shclf-by-shelf cooling method, the fresh food compartment 3 is stratified by means of shelves 8 into several sub-compartments, and the vertically arranged cool air discharging openings 16 are associated to the sub-com(?artments to provide the cool air to the respective corresponding sub-compartment.<br>
However, the refrigerator adopting the above shclf-by-shelf cooling method are burdened with a problem of an uneven refrigeration in the fresh food compartment 3, due to a temperature difference between regions of the fresh food compartment 3. Since the coo! air is blown into the compartment 3 only in the direction toward which the discharging openings 16 is facing, there is bound to exist a region within the compartment 3 receiving more cool air or less than others. Furthermore such a cooling method does not allow the flexibility to concentrate the cool air into a si^ecific region when there is a necessity to have a region cooler than others.<br>
A so-called tri-dimensional refrigerator has l^ecn recently conceived to overcome the forementioned shortcoming of the shelf-by-shelf cooling method. As illustrated in l"ig. 3, in such a method, a number of cool air discharging oix;nings<br><br>
16' are located not only on the back wall but also on the side wa!ls of the fresh<br>
food compartment 3 allowing the delivery of the cool air from three sides.	'<br>
Such a tri-dimensional cooling method, despite an improved uniform distribution of cool air in the fresh food compartment 3 however, does not ix'rmit the cool air to be fully dispersed in the compartment 3 as the discharge of the cool air'is effectuated only in fixed directions. i'"oodsluffs stored in a region where the cool air is mainly directed have a risk of being over-cooled. By contrast, foodstuffs scored in the corners may not be cooled sufficiently. Accordingly, in the method, there's a definite limit in maintaining the temperature even throughout the storage area. Furthermore, as in the case of the shelf-by-shelf cooling system, this method makes impossible to concentrate the cool air into a specific area, should there exist a necessity to do so. A further significant problem of the tri-dimensional cooling method is that a refrigerator equipped with such a system is expensive to produce (extra parts and extra manufacturing cost) as additional ducts need to be installed at the side walls of the fresh food compartment 3. Furthermore, such a refrigerator has yci another disadvantage of a reduced storing capacity as the walls need to be thicker. Moreover, the energy loss in the cool air flow becomes more significant.<br>
The above mentioned problems become a real issue with Uiday's trend of increasingly larger refrigerators. In high capacity refrigerators which necessitate larger dimensions, there is a definite limit in distribufing the cool air evenly to all regions in the fresh food compartment 3. As illustrated in Fig. 1, since each cool air discharging ojx'ning  16 is  formed licrix^ndicularly to the dircclion of the<br><br>
flow of the cool air. the cool air coming  from  Lhe evaix)rator  12b is not evenly<br>
rdistributed among the discharging openings 16. The lower the discharging opening 16b is, the more cool air is distributed lo. As a consequence, a uniform distribution of cool air in the fresh food comparLmenl 3 in a vertical direction can not be achieved, resulting in the over-cuoiing of the foodstuffs stored at the bottom, And under-cooling of those foodstuffs stored at the top.<br>
In order to solve the forementioned problems, a refrigerator has been proposed in International Patent Publication WO 95/27178 by Lhe applicant of this invention. The refrigerator is equipped with a cool air dispersing device which distributes the cool air from the cool air duct evenly to all regions of the fresh food compartment, as illustrated in Figs. 4 to 7.<br>
Fig. 4 is a side cross-sectional view of a refrigerator equipped with a cool air dispersing device, and Fig. 5 is a partially enlarged view of the refrigerator in Fig. 4. As in the conventional refrigerator of Fig. 1, the refrigerator consists of a main body 14, a compressor 31, evaporators 32a, 32b and fans 33a, 33b. In the rear wall of the fresh food compartment 23 is provided a coo! aJr duct 34 through which the cool air from the fresh food compartment evaporator 32b flows down after being blown therein by the fresh food compartment fan 33b. Inside this cool air duct 34 is disposed a cool air disix.'rsing device 40 in a vertical arrangement. In the rear wall of the fresh food comiMrtment 23 are disposed a cool air discharging openings 36 through which the cool air from the cool air duct 34 is discharged into the fresh food compartment 23. The cool air dispersing device   40   guides   the   provided   cool   air   into   (he   fresh   food <br><br>
through these cool air discharging opening 36. In the rear of the cool air duct 34 is disposed a circulation duct 28 connecting the fresh food compartment 23 and the fresh food compartmeni evaporator 32b in such a w;iy ihat the circulation duct 28 is isolated from the cool air duct 34. The cool air, after cooling the fresh food compartment 23, is returned to the fresh food compartmeni evaporat6r 32b via the circulation duct 28,<br>
The cool air dispersing device 40, as illustrated in Fig. 6. is comprised of a rotary shaft 41, and a plurality of coo) air disi:x?rsing wings 45, The rotary shaft 41 is installed at the surface of the rear wall of the fresh food compartment 23 in such a way as to allow it to rotate freely. To the upper part of the rotjiry shaft 41 is connected a driving motor 38 which enables the rotation oi the shaft 41. The cool air dispersing wings 45 have a waved strip shape waved to a plane including the rotational axis of the rotary shaft 41. The wings 45 are distanced out from each other along the length of the shaft 41 and are disixjsed as to correspond to the positions of the cool air discharging openings 36. At the upper and lower end of each cool air dispersing wing 45 are disposed end discs 43 including upper and lower disc 43a and 43b respectively. Furthermore, between the discs 43a and 43b is disposed a middle disc 44 which bisects the cool air dispersing wing 45 into a first wing portion 453 and a second wing portion 45b. Each wing portion 45a, 45b is curved in such fashion as to have a an "S" shaped cross-section. Within a single cool air dispersing wing 45. the "S" shaix.' of the upper and lower wing portions 45a and 45b are reversed lo each other.<br>
When  the driving  motor 38 rotates  the  rotary   shaft 41   al  low   speed,  ihe<br><br>
cool   air   supplied   through   the  cool   air   duct   34   changes   its   dirccLion   of   flow<br><br><br>
The object, according to the present invention, is realized by a refrigerator including a main body housing a fresh food compartment, and a cool air duct	provided in a wall of the fresh food compartment and having cool air discharging openings opened toward the fresh food compartment to supply a cool air from an evaporator into the fresh food compartment, the refrigerator comprising a rotary shaft; a'partidoning plate mounted on the rotary shaft along a rotation axis of the rotary shaft, the partitioning plate being disix)sed near the cool air discharging opening; a driving means for rotating the rotary shaft; and a pair of cool air dispersing wings mounted on both surfaces of the partitioning plate with an inclined angle to the rotation axis.<br>
Here, it is preferred that said cool air dispersing wings have the inclined angles opposite to each other. Desirably, an extra cool air dispersing wing of an opposite inclined angle may be disposed along the rotation axis in addition to said cool air dispersing wing corresponding to each surface of said partitioning plate. At this time, a disc shaped middle plate may be advantageously disposed transverse to said rotation axis between said cool air disiiersing wing and said extra cool air dispersing wing. Moreover, it is desired that disc shaped end plates are disposed transverse to the rotation axis at each end of said cool air dispersing wings. In order to effectively deliver the cool air in the rear corner regions of the fresh food compartment, the cool air dispersing wings may protrude from a inner wall of the fresh food compartment toward the interior of the fresh food compartment. In the case, there may be advantageously provided a coo! air grill  of a partially cylindrical  shape	  wliich  is  formed  with   the cool  air<br><br>
discharging opening, being distxsed along said rotary shaft.<br>

[Mailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Hereinafter,   the   present   invention   will   be   described   in   detail   with reference to the drawings.<br>
Fig'. 8 is a side cross-sectional view of a refrigerator equiied with a cool air dispersing device according to the present invention. As illustrated, the refrigerator according to the present invention, as in conventional refrigerators. has a thermally insulated main body 64 housing a freezing compartment 62 and a fresh food compartment 3 separated with each olher by a partitioning wall 61, as well as a freezing compartment door 66 and a fresh food compartment door 67 which open/close the freezing compartment 62 and the fresh food compartment 63 respectively.<br>
In the fresh food compartment 62 are disposed a plurality of shelves 68 which stratify the compartment 63 into several storage areas. A special sub-compartment 63a is disposed at the upper	 region of the fresh food compartment 63 for foodstuffs which require to be stored in a specific temperature. At the bottom of the fresh food compartment 63 is located a vegetables compartment 63b for storing vegetables,<br>
In the main body 64 of the refrigerator is installed a compressor 71, a condenser{not shown) as well as a freezing compartment evaixiralor 72a and a fresh food compartment evaporator 72b which together perform a refrigeration cycle. The cool air is produced at each evaporator 72a, 721). Directly above each<br><br>
evaporator 72ii, 72b are disposed a fan 73a for the freezing comparLmeni 62 and a fan 73b for the fresh food compartment 63 which forcefully blow the cool air produced at the evaporators 72a, 72b into the fresh food compartment 63 or the freezing compartment 62.<br>
In the rear wall of the fresh food compartment 63 is provided a coo! air duct 131' in which is disposed a coo! air dispersing device 80. The coo! air blown into the cool air duct 131 by the fan 73b of the fresh food compartment 63 is further delivered into the fresh food compartment 63 via the cool air dispersing device 80, In the rear of the cool air duct 131 is disposed a circulation duct 74 connecting the fresh food compartment 63 and the fresh food comiaartment evaporator 72b in such a way that the circulation duct 74 is isolated from the coot air duct 131. The cool air, after cooling the fresh food compartment 63, is returned to the fresh food compartment evaporator 72b via the above circulation duct 74.<br>
Fig. 9 is an enlarged side cross-sectional view of the duct housing 100 which is installed in the rear wall of the fresh food compartment 63 and constitutes the cool air duct 131. Fig. 10 is an exploded perspective view of Fig. 9. The duct housing 100 forming the cool air duct 131 is comprised of a duct member 130 which guides insulatedly the cool air, a frontal panel 120 which covers up the front side of the duct member 130, a seal panel 150 which covers up the rear side of the duct member 130 and a partially cylindrical cool air grill member 110 which surrounds the cool air disisersing device 80 at the front side of Che frontal panel  120. In the cool air grill member 110 arc formed the cool air<br><br>
discharging openings 111 facing the fresh food compartment 63. The coo! air dispersing device 80 is rotatably installed on the frontal panel 120, The frontal panel 120 and the duct member 130 are formed with recesses 121, 121' for accommodating a portion of the cool air dispersing device 80 to surround the cool air device 80 in cooperation with the cool air grill member 110.<br>
Th'e coot air dispersing device 80 is comprised of a vertically disposed rotary shaft 85, and coo! air dispersing wing pairs 81, 82 which arc disposed along the shaft 85 at locations corresponding to the cool air discharging openings HI. The device 80 is put into rotation by means of a driving motor 125 housed in a motor case 124 located in the upper part of the frontal panel 120. It is desirable that the driving motor 125 is of a stepping motor to allow angle-control led slops and reverse rotation. At each side of the driving motor 125 is disposed a lamp 127 for the purpose of illumination which is switched on and off according to the open/closed state of the fresh food compartment door 67. A lamp cover 126 houses each lamp 127.<br>
The cool air grill member 110 is installed at the recess 121. 121' of the frontal panel 120. The cool air discharging openings 111 on the grill member 110 are dis|X)sed in such a way as to correspond to the positions of the cool air dispersing wings 81 of the cool air dispersing device 80. The frontal panel 120 is installed virtually conforming with the inner surface of the rear wall of the fresh food compartment 63, and the cool air grill member 110 is installed in such a way as to protrude fi-om the frontal panel 120 out to the inside of the fresh food compartment 63.  Accordingly,  the grill  member  110  and  the cool  air dispersing<br><br>
device 80 as a whole protnade somewhat from the rear wail surface of the fresh food compartment 63; this allows the cool air delivered by the cool air disix-rsing device 80 to be distributed in the compartment 63 in a wide angle.<br>
In the upper part of the duct member 130 is disiXsed a conductinsj path 132 into which the cool air produced at the evaporator 72b is directed. Inside this conducting path 132 is installed a control damiier 79 which regulates the amount of cool air flowing into the path 132 by opening/closing this path 132. At the upper portion of the duct member 130 is located cool air vents 133 for the sjnecial sub-compartment 63a. extending out of the conducting path 132 into the front surface of the duct member 130. The cool air vents 133 communicate with cool air discharging oi^enings 123 for the special sub-compartment 63a, which are disposed in the frontal panel 120. The cool air discharging openings 123 for the special sub-compartment 63a face and provide the cool air to the interior of the special sub-compartment 63a in the fresh food compartment 63.<br>
Fig, U is a rear perspective view of Fig. 9 showing the coupled stale of the duct member 130 and the frontal panel 120. The rear surfjice of the duct member 130 is formed with a plurality of cool air guides 137, and between these guides 137 are disposed cool air directing vents 138 which pass through the duct member 130. The cool air directing vents 138 are ixisitioned to correspond to the locations of the dispersing wings 81 of the cool air disi^ersing device 80.<br>
The cool air ducts 131 are formed vertically at the rear surface of the duct member. The cool air guides 137 divides the cool air ducts 131 into a first duct portion 131a and a second duct jxirtion  131b at each side thereof. The two duct<br><br>
portions 131a, 131b are met by the conducting path  132 at the upper end. and by the vegetables compartment 63b at the lower end.<br>
Each duct portion l31a. 131b is directed into the cool air directing vent 138 through a first connecting channel 135a and a second connecting clianncl 135b which are formed between the cool air guides 137. In the illustrated embodiment, three cool air directing vents 138 are provided at the upjjer, middle and lower regions, and three sets of the connecting channels 135a and 135b are disposed to correspond to the positions of the cool air vents 138. Bach connecting channel 135 has its upper portion rounded and its lower portion wider to the exterior than the upper portion, thereby allowing the coo! air flowing down the duct portion 131 to be dispersed and directed to the connecting channels 135 in a natural fashion. The lower connecting channel is wider to the exterior and has a larger entrance than the middle connecting channel which is in turn wider than the upper connecting channel, thus allowing an even distribution of the cool air flowing into each respective cool air directing vent 138. The seal panel 150 is attached airtight to the duct member 130, and forms the rear wall of the cool air duct 131. The duct member 130 and the seal panel 150 are made out of insulating materials such as polystyrene foam and minimize the heat transfer loss of the cool air.<br>
Fig. 12 is a partially enlarged laerspective view of the cool air dispersing wing pairs 81. 82 of the cool air disix;rsing device 80 corresijonding to one cool air discharging oijening HI. The cool air disix'rsing device 80 is comprised of a rotary  shaft 85. a partitioning plate 83 mounted on  the roLary  shaft 85 alony ilic<br><br>
axis of rotation, and cool air disipersiny wing pairs 81, 82 which ore yitachcti to bolh<br>
surfaces of the partitioning plate 83. A connecting hole 86 is dis|X)se(i at the upixT distal end<br>
of the rotary shaft 85 for the connection of the diiving shaft of ihc motor 125.	'<br><br><br>
there is room between the individual wings 81a, 81b. 82a, 82b and the plates 87, 88, 89. The angle at which the cool air is discharged into the fresh food compartment is dependent upon the angular position of the rotary shaft 85, which means that as the driving motor 125 roVales the shaft 85, the cool air is dispersed evenly to all directionsdeft. right, up and down); and the cool air can be concentrated to one single specific direction by stopping the rolary shaft 85 from rotating.<br>
Inside the fresh food compartment 63, as illustrated in Fig 13, are disposed a plurality of temperature sensors 140. The refrigerator senses the temperature of the fresh food compartment 63 through these sensors 140 and if the temperature in the compartment 63 is not appropriate to the refrigeration power level desired by the user, the compressor 71 is activated and the refrigeration operation is put into effect.. Accordingly, the cool air produced in the fresh food compartment evaporator 72b passes through the control damper 79 and then to the conducting path 132; the cool air is then dispersed to the left and to the right by the cool air guides 137. The cool air is drained down, and discharged into the fresh food compartment 63 and the vegetables compartment 63b via the first and the second duct portions 131a and 131b. A portion of the cool air is blown into the si:&gt;ecial sub-compartment 63a through the cool air vents 133 and through the cool air discharging openings 123.<br>
In order to achieve an uniform distribution of the cool air in the fresh food compartment 63, the cool air dispersing device 80 rotates by means of a driving motor   125,   aiid   the   cool   air   provided   thereat   Hows   according   to   the   s!oi3ed<br><br>
surfaces   of   each   of   the   wings   81a,   81b,   82a,   82b   and   is   disserscd   to   all directions (left,   right,   up   and   down)   in   the   fresh   food   compartment   63   as   ' illustrated in iMg.  13.  As a result, a uniform temperature is achieved  within the fresh food compartment 63 eliminating regions that are normally dci:)nved of cool air.<br>
The cool air dispersing device 80 can change the direction of its cool air discharge by shifting its angular position of its rotation. An uniform distribution of cool air in all directions is realized thanks to the continuously changing angle of discharge of the cool air created by the slowly rotating cool air dispersing device 80 powered by a driving motor 125. P'urthermore, as the temperature of a specific region within the fresh food compartment 63 goes up for such reasons as storing a hot item, the driving motor 125 can lock the discharge angle of the cool air dispersing device 80, in order to concentrate all the cool air in that particular direction and effectuate a concenfrated refrigeration of the region.<br>
As explained above, according to the present invention, a refrigerator with a cool air dispersing device having cool air dispersing wings which provide a uniform refrigeration in all four directions (left, right, up and down) and which can also realize a concentrated refrigeration of a specific region by means of a controllable angle of discharge, is provided.<br><br><br><br><br>
The refrigerator as claimed in claim 1, wherein said cool air dispersing wings protrude from an inner wall of said fresh food compartment toward the interior of the fresh food compartment.<br>
7.	The refrigerator as claimed in claim 6, wherein a cool air grill of a partially cylindrical shape formed with said cool air discharging openings is disposed along said rotary shaft.<br>
8.	A refrigerator substantially as herein described with reference to figures<br>
8 to 13 of the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
