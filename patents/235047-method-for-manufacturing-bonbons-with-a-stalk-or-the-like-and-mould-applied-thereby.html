				<td>Method for manufacturing bonbons with a stalk or the like<br>
and mould applied thereby.<br>
The present invention concerns a method for<br>
manufacturing bonbons with a stalk or the like.<br>
In particular, the invention concerns a method for<br>
manufacturing bonbons, such as cherry liqueur<br>
chocolates, pralines, Easter eggs or the like, whereby<br>
these bonbons are provided with the stalk of a piece of<br>
fruit, a stick, a cord or the like.<br>
A method for manufacturing such bonbons is already<br>
known, which mainly consists of briefly immersing in<br>
chocolate for example a cherry or another piece of fruit<br>
that was previously macerated in liqueur, after which the<br>
chocolate which sticks to this cherry is made to set, such<br>
that a praline is formed.<br>
Next, a stalk or the like is immersed in chocolate<br>
with one far end, after which it is held against the<br>
bonbon with this far end, as a result of which, due to<br>
the setting of the chocolate, the stalk will adhere to<br>
the praline.<br>
A disadvantage of this known traditional method is that it<br>
is very time-consuming and expensive.<br>
The present invention aims to remedy the above-mentioned<br>
and other disadvantages.<br>
To this end, the present invention concerns a method for<br>
manufacturing bonbons with a stalk or the like,<br>
whereby use is made of a mould with at least one deepened<br>
part whose wall is provided with an opening and which<br>
consists in providing a stalk or the like through the<br>
opening, such that one far end thereof still extends in<br>
the deepened part, after which a measured amount of<br>
molten chocolate or the like is poured in this deepened<br>
part and is cooled, such that, after the chocolate or the<br>
like has set, a bonbon is formed in which the above-<br>
mentioned stalk or the like is cast in the chocolate with<br>
its above-mentioned far end.<br>
Such a method is advantageous in that it allows for<br>
an automation, as a result of which it can be applied<br>
in a mechanized manner on a large scale and as a result<br>
of which the production times and cost price decrease<br>
considerably, whereas a product quality comparable to<br>
that of the traditional method is obtained.<br>
The present invention also concerns a mould which can<br>
be applied in a method according to the invention, which<br>
mould is provided with at least one deepened part whose<br>
wall is provided with an opening.<br>
In order to better explain the characteristics of the<br>
present invention, the following method according to<br>
the invention for manufacturing bonbons with a stalk or<br>
the like is given as an example only without being<br>
limitative in any way, with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
figures 1 to 5 represent a method according to the<br>
invention;<br>
figure 6 represents a bonbon which is made according to<br>
the method of the invention;<br>
figure 7 represents a variant of a bonbon according to<br>
figure 6;<br>
figure 8 represents a variant of a mould according to<br>
figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 is a partial section of a mould 1 which can be<br>
applied in a method according to the invention, which<br>
mould 1 in this case consists of a base plate 2 in<br>
which has been provided a deepened part 3.<br>
In the wall of the deepened part 3 is provided an<br>
opening 4, conical in this case, which extends entirely<br>
through this bottom wall and which narrows towards the<br>
outside of the mould 1.<br>
The method according to the invention mainly consists in<br>
that a stalk 5 or the like is provided through the above-<br>
mentioned opening 4 in the above-mentioned mould 1,<br>
such that this opening 4 is sealed.<br>
As is represented in figure 2, the above-mentioned stalk 5<br>
can be provided with a thickening on far end 6 which is<br>
preferably larger than the above-mentioned opening 4 or<br>
which is complementary to it, and which is made<br>
practically conical in this case, such that a good<br>
sealing of the opening 4 is obtained.<br>
The above-mentioned stalk 5 can for example be made of<br>
paper, plastic or other materials which are allowed in<br>
the food sector.<br>
Next, as is represented in figure 3, in the mould 1, is<br>
poured a measured amount of chocolate 7 or the like.<br>
In a following step, as is represented in figure 4, a<br>
cooled die 8 is pressed in the mould 1, such that the<br>
chocolate 1 or the like is spread against the wall of the<br>
deepened part 3 with a more or less even thickness.<br>
The above-mentioned die 8 is preferably provided with a<br>
recess 9 which, when the die 8 is in use, is situated<br>
opposite the above-mentioned opening 4 in the mould 1, such<br>
that when the chocolate 7 is pressed on with the die 8, a<br>
layer of chocolate is formed on the thickened far end 6,<br>
whose thickness corresponds to the thickness of the<br>
chocolate layer between the die 8 and the wall of the<br>
deepened part 3.<br>
Since the above-mentioned die 8 is cooled, the<br>
chocolate 7 will set in such a manner that a little tub is<br>
formed in which the above-mentioned stalk 5 is held, as it<br>
is cast in the chocolate with its far end 6.<br>
Next, a filling is provided in the above-mentioned tub,<br>
such as a creme, a syrup, a piece of fruit, caramel or<br>
the like.<br>
In the case of figure 5, for example, a cherry 10 is<br>
provided in the above-mentioned tub, after which the rest<br>
of the tub is filled with for example chocolate..<br>
Thus, after everything has set, a bonbon 11 is formed<br>
which is provided with a stalk, as is represented in<br>
figure 6 and 15, which can then be removed from the mould<br>
1.<br>
Figure 7 represents a variant of a bonbon 11 which is<br>
obtained by means of a method according to the invention.<br>
In this case, the bonbon 11 is made in the shape of a<br>
chocolate egg, which is provided with an appendage in the<br>
shape of a little ribbon 12, both far ends of which are<br>
held in the chocolate.<br>
To manufacture such a bonbon 11, a half egg 13 is made<br>
according to the method as described above, and a second<br>
half egg 14 is formed in a known mould without opening,<br>
after which these two halves are melted together so as to<br>
form an egg.<br>
Figure 8 represents a variant of a mould 1 which can be<br>
applied in a method according to the invention, whereby<br>
the above-mentioned opening 4 in the deepened part 3 is<br>
covered on one side by means of a holder 15 for the<br>
stalk 5 or the like.<br>
The method for manufacturing bonbons by means of such a<br>
mould is analogous to the one described above.<br>
However, such a variant is advantageous in that the<br>
chocolate which runs through the opening 4, along the<br>
stalk. 5 or the like, ends up in the holder 15 and is not<br>
lost.<br>
Another advantage thereof is that, by means of the<br>
above-mentioned holder 15, the stalk 5 is positioned in<br>
the right place.<br>
Naturally, all sorts of bonbons can be made with a method<br>
according to the invention, and it is not restricted to<br>
the use of chocolate, but it also allows to manufacture<br>
bonbons made of other materials, such a for example sugar.<br>
It is also clear that the above-mentioned stalk 5 or the<br>
like, which is provided on a bonbon 11 which is obtained<br>
with a method according to the invention, can be made in<br>
all sorts of different shapes, such as for example in<br>
the shape of a little cord, liquorice or the like.<br>
The present invention is by no means limited to the<br>
embodiment given as an example and represented in the<br>
accompanying drawings; on the contrary, such a method<br>
according to the invention for manufacturing bonbons<br>
with a stalk or the like and a mould applied thereby, can<br>
be made in all sorts of shapes and dimensions while still<br>
remaining within the scope of the invention.<br>
