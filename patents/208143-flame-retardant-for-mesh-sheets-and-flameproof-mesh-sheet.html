The present invention relates to a halogen-free<br>
flameproof mesh sheet used outdoors such as a construction<br>
site for a long time.	<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
In recent years, there has been a trend toward the construction of buildings having a large number of! stories in the construction industry.  Meanwhile, there has been an increase in the number of houses having a small number of<br>
i<br>
stories.  Flameproof mesh sheets for safety and protection<br>
and scattering prevention flameproof mesh sheets must be<br>
i laid in these buildings and regulations are becoming more<br>
and more strict.	    <br>
Currently used flameproof mesh sheets and scattering prevention flameproof mesh sheets are produced by weaving yarn prepared by coating a polyester, nylon or polypropylene multi-filament fiber with a vinyl chloride-based paste resin composition and heating and then heating the obtained cloth and by coating a fabric prepared by weaving and processing a<br><br>
multi-filament fiber with a vinyl chloride-based paste resin composition, heating and processing to a desired shape, respectively.<br>
A vinyl chloride containing chlorine is used as the resin composition for coating a fiber and fabric. Illustrative examples of the flame retardant include chlorine-based flame retardants such as chlorinated paraffin, bromine-based flame retardants such as decabromodiphenyl oxide, and inorganic flame retardants such as antimony trioxide (Examined Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 52-41786, 53-18065 and 61-94305, Plastics, February, 1991).<br>
In recent years, it has been globally demanded to avoid the use of resins and flame retardants containing elemental halogen which generates harmful gas at the time of combustion from the viewpoint of the environmental -preservation of the earth.<br>
Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 61-223045 proposes that red phosphorus and ammonium phosphate are    [^ kneaded into polyolefin to prevent corrosion by halogen<br>
contained in a halogen-containing compound flame retardant.<br><br>
However, there is unknown a flame retardant which is<br>
dispersed in an aqueous dispersion of a polyolefin resin.<br>
-<br>
[0003]<br>

[0005]<br>
[Embodiments of the Invention]<br>
An aqueous dispersion of a polyolefin resin is used as a base material in the present invention because a multi-filament fiber and fabric are fully impregnated with a flame retardant and uniformly coated with the flame retardant.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous dispersion of a polyolefin resin comprises as the polyolefin resin an ethylene-methacrylic acid metal ion crosslinked copolymer containing 10 to 20 wt% of methacrylic acid and has a solid content of 20 to 45 wt%, a particle diameter of 0.01 to 3 µm, ja pH of 8 to 11, a viscosity of 30 to 1,000 cp (a BM type viscometer, 6 rotations).  The polyolefin resin is particularly<br>
preferably an ethylene-methacrylic acid metal ion<br>
i<br>
crosslinked copolymer having a resin surface hardness of D-40 to 75 (Shore-D: ASTMD2240) such as an ionomer resin exemplified by S-300, S-650 or S-100 (of Mitsui ' Petrochemical Industry Co.).<br>
An ethylene-based a-olefin copolymer may be used and a<br>
dispersion thereof has a solid content of 20 to 45 vt%, a particle diameter of 1 to 10 µm, a pH of 8 to 11, a viscosity of 2,000 to 8,000 cp (a BM type viscometer, 6<br><br>
rotations) and a resin surface hardness of A-80 to 97 (Shore A: ASTMD).  The ethylene-based a-olefin copolymer is<br>
preferably a thermoplastic elastomer resin comprising 50 wt% or more of ethylene, such as A-100 or A-200 (of Mitsui<br>
Petrochemical Industry Co.).<br><br>
 When a mixture of 90 to 10 wt% of an ethylene-methacrylic acid metal ion crosslinked copolymer and 10 to 90  vt|% of an ethylene-based a-olefin copolymer is used, the<br>
surface hardness of the ethylene-methacrylic acid metal ion<br><br>
crosslinked copolymer having a higher surface hardness and the surface hardness of the ethylene-based a-olefin<br>
copolymer having a lower surface hardness are well balanced<br><br>
and the feeling of a conventional flameproof mesh sheet      <br>
produced from a soft vinyl chloride resin is obtained.  As<br>
for the preferable ratio of the two materials, the ethylene-<br>
methacrylic acid metal ion crosslinked copolymer is used in'<br>
a proportion of 80 to 40 wt% and the ethylene-based a-olefin<br>
copolymer in a proportion of 20	to 60 wt%.<br>
[0006]<br>
Red phosphorus used in the	present invention is<br>
preferably micro-encapsulated.	Use of the micro-<br><br>
encapsulated red phosphorus makes it possible to reduce an increase in the viscosity of an aqueous dispersion when red phosphorus is mixed into the olefin aqueous dispersion. Further, the flameproof mesh sheet is detached and washed to remove dirt after it is spread at a construction site and used for 4 to 8 months.  It is washed by immersing it in hot<br>
water heated at about 40°C and containing a detergent for<br><br><br>
several hours.  At this point, red phosphorus can be prevented from dissolving in water by micro-encapsulation. The concentration of red phosphorus is 75 to 95 % and the average particle diameter thereof is 10 to 40 µm.<br>
Micro-encapsulation can be suitably carried out by coating the surface of a red phosphorus particle with a resin or inorganic material by interfacial polymerization, coacervation or the like.<br>
[0007]<br>
The ammonium polyphosphate compound used in the present invention is ammonium polyphosphate or amide polyphosphate. Use of the micro-encapsulated ammonium polyphosphate compound makes it possible to reduce an increase in the viscosity of the aqueous dispersion when the ammonium polyphosphate compound is mixed into the aqueous dispersion<br>
V<br>
of an olefin resin. Further, the flameproof mesh sheet is detached and washed to remove dirt after it is spread at a construction site and used for 4 to 8 months.  It is washed by immersing in hot water heated at about 40°C and containing a detergent.  At this point, the ammonium<br>
polyphosphate compound can be made hardly soluble in water<br><br>
and stable by micro-encapsulation.  The concentration of phosphor contained in the ammonium polyphosphate compound is 15 to 35 % and the average particle diameter of the compound is 5 to 40 µm.  Micro-encapsulation can be carried out like red phosphorus.<br>
[0008]<br>
Red phosphorus and an ammonium polyphosphate compound<br><br>
are used as flame retardants in the present invention because when a resin composition containing red phosphorus is brought close to flames, the resin and red phosphorus on the surface first burn and the resin is bonded to oxygen in the air to become carbon dioxide gas, water and carbon.  In this case, red phosphorus promotes the carbonization of the ethylene-methacrylic acid metal ion crosslinked copolymer and the ethylene-a-olefin copolymer-  Meanwhile, red<br>
phosphorus is bonded to oxygen to become an oxide which is<br>
further bonded to water to become condensation phosphoric<br>
acid.  A film made from a mixture of carbon and condensation<br><br>
phosphoric acid formed on the surface of the resin becomes an oxygen impermeable layer on the surface of the resin, suppresses the combustion of the resin and makes the resin flame resistant.<br>
Red phosphorus must be existent in an amount of 1.5 to 15 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyolefin resin solid content of the aqueous dispersion of a polyolefin resin having a solid content of 20 to 45 wt%. If the content of red phosphorus is less than 1:5  parts by weight based on the resin solid content, its flameproofincj effect will not be provided and if the content is more than 15 parts by weight, its flameproofing effect will not be improved, the resulting flameproof mesh sheet will have a strong red tint and difficult to be colored even with a pigment.<br>
In this case, when an ammonium phosphate compound is existent, the ammonium polyphosphate compound thermally<br>
V<br><br>
decomposes at the time of combustion and generates nitrogen gas which shuts off oxygen. The ammonium polyphosphate compound promotes the carbonization of a polyolefin resin as a dehydrocarbonizing agent and improves a combustion effect while it generates nitrogen-containing gas.  In the present invention, the ammonium polyphosphate compound must be existent in an amount of 10 to 70 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyolefin resin solid content of the aqueous dispersion of a polyolefin resin having a solid content of 20 to 45 wt%.  Below 10 parts by weight, a flameproofing effect will not be provided and above 7 0 parts by weight, a flameproofing effect will not be improved.<br>
[0009]<br>
Nova Excel 14 0 or Nova Red 120 (Rin Kagaku Kogyo Co.) is used as red phosphorus.<br>
TERRAJU-60 or TERRJU-70 (of Chisso Corp.), or Hostafuram AP462 (Hoechst Co.) is used as the ammonium polyphosphate compound.<br>
When a metal hydroxide is fdrther used, a great flameproofing effect is obtained advantageously.  The metal<br>
hydroxide is preferably magnesium hydroxide or aluminum ,<br><br>
hydroxide which can be used in conjunction with red phosphorus and ammonium polyphosphate to obtain a greater effect.  The metal hydroxide must be existent in an amount of 60 to 150 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyolefin resin solid content of a polyolefin resin aqueous dispersion.<br>
When the amount of the metal hydroxide is less than 60<br><br>
parts by weight, its effect of promoting flame resistance is <br>
small and when the amount is more than 150 parts by weight,<br>
 the viscosity of the aqueous dispersion of a polyolefin<br>
resin increases disadvantageously.<br>
[0010]<br>
As the aluminum hydroxide is used Hijilite H-42M or Hijilite H-43M (Showa Denko K.K.)<br>
As the magnesium hydroxide is used Kisuma 5 (Kyowa Kagaku Kogyo Co.)<br>
[0011]<br>
The multi-filament used in the present invention is at least one multi-filament selected from polyesters, nylons, polypropylene and vinylon.  It is preferably a polyester fiber from viewpoints of strength and thermal shrinkage. .<br>
A high-strength and lightweight flameproof mesh sheet can be obtained by controlling the tensile strength of the multi-filament fiber to 6 to 10 g/denier. A flameproof mesh Sheet having high toughness and high impact energy absorption at the time of falling can be obtained by controlling the break elongation of the multi-filament fiber to 14 to 45 %<br>
The multi-filament which is treated with a flame<br>
V<br>
retardant and then woven has an equivalent single fineness<br>
of 3 to 17 denier, preferably 3 to 12 denier, particularly<br>
preferably 4 to 9 denier and a total fineness of 1,000 to<br>
4,500 denier, preferably 1,260 to 3,500 denier, particularly<br>
 preferably 1,500 to 3,000 denier.<br><br>
The multi-filament used in a fabric which is woven and then treated with a flame retardant has an equivalent single fineness of 2 to 13 denier, preferably 2 to 11 denier, particularly preferably 2.5 to 9 denier and a total fineness of 150 to 2,500 denier, preferably 200 to 2,000 denier, particularly preferably 250 to 1,500 denier.  By controlling • tensile strength to 6 to 10 g/denier, a high-strength and lightweight flameproof mesh sheet can be obtained and by<br>
V<br>
controlling break elongation to 14 to 45 %, a flameproof mesh sheet having high toughness and high impact energy absorption at the time of falling can be obtained.<br>
A flameproof mesh sheet which needs to have high strength and toughness is prepared by paralleling 2 to 4 filament* fibers and lono weaving them with a Dobby weaving machine.  A scattering prevention flameproof mesh sheet is prepared by leno weaving a fabric of a single filament fiber with a weaving machine in most cases.<br>
As for the weight ratio of the multi-filament fiber and fabric to the solid content of a flame retardant, the solid content of the flame retardant is used in an amount of 60 to 250 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the multi-filament fiber and fabric.  When the solid content of the flame retardant is less than 60 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the multi-filament fiber or fabric, coating becomes nonuniform and the multi-filament fiber and fabric are partly exposed, thereby deteriorating outer appearance and weatherability.  Further, flame resistance also lowers.  When the solid content is more than .250 parts   <br><br>
by weight, the weight of the flameproof mesh sheet increases with the result of deteriorated handling properties disadvantageously.<br>
[0013]<br>
A pigment, dye, ultraviolet absorber, optical stabilizer, antioxidant, stabilizer, diluent, thickening<br>
agent, foaming agent, mold preventing agent, alga prevehting<br><br>
agent and the like can be used in conjunction with; the flame retardant in the present invention by suitably selecting types and amounts thereof.<br>
A description is subsequently given of a process for producing a flameproof mesh sheet of the present invention. When the flameproof mesh sheet of the present invention is produced using a multi-filament fiber, coated yarn prepared by coating the fiber with a flame retardant through a sizing nozzle, heating and gelling is taken up by a winder.  This coated yarn taken up by the winder is woven into a fabric by a weaving machine.  This fabric is introduced into a heating furnace and heated for non-shifting processing in order to obtain cloth.<br>
This cloth is cut to a predetermined size, sewed and subjected to non-shift processing to obtain a halogen-free flameproof mesh sheet.<br>
When the flameproof mesh sheet of the present invention is produced using a fabric, woven cloth is obtained by weaving the multi-filament fiber by a Dobby weaving machine. After this woven cloth is immersed in a tank filled with a flame retardant for mesh sheets and let pass through the<br><br>
tank, it is dried with an air blow, introduced into a heating furnace and gelled by heating to obtain coated cloth.  To increase the amount of the flame retardant coated on the fabric, the fabric is immersed in and let pass through the tank filled with the flame retardant at least two times to produce coated cloth.  The cloth is cut to a predetermined size, sewed and subjected to non-shifting ; processing to produce a halogen-free flameproof mesh sheet.<br>
[0014]<br>
[Examples]<br>
Example 1	<br><br>
100 parts by weight of the S-300 aqueous dispersion of<br>
an ethylene-methacrylic acid metal ion crosslinked copolymer<br>
(solid content of 35 %) was injected into a planetary mixer<br>
(volume of 25 liters), and then 1.5 parts by weight of the<br>
Nova Excel red phosphorus (4.3 parts by weight Based on 100<br>
parts by weight of a resin solid content), 12 parts by<br>
weight of the TERRAJU-60 ammonium polyphosphate ,(34.3 parts<br>
by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin solid<br>
content), 0.3 part by weight of the Tinuabin 327 ultraviolet<br>
absorber (0.86 part by weight based on the resin solid<br>
content), and 0.3 part by weight of the Irganox 1010<br>
antioxidant (0.86 part by weight based on the resin solid<br>

parts by weight of water were added gradually under<br>
agitation. After addition, these materials were stirred for<br>
another 20 minutes.  Then, vacuum defoaming was carried out<br><br>
at a reduced pressure of 5 mmHg for 30 minutes to obtain a flame retardant having a viscosity of 2,140 cps (a BM type viscometer, rotor V-6, 12 rpm, 25°C).  The flame retardant was charged into a bath, and a polyester multi-filament fiber having a total fineness of 1,750 denier, each consisting of 384 filaments, an equivalent single fineness of 4.5 denier, a tensile strength of 8-5 g/denier and a break elongation of 21 % was caused to pass through a guide, pinched with a pinch roll, further pass througlr- a guide roll, the bath of the flame retardant and then a sizing nozzle (diameter of 0.7 mm) to coat the multi-filament fiber.  Thereafter, the obtained strand was heated in a heating furnace at 140°C and caused to pass through another sizing nozzle (diameter of 0.8 mm) to coat the multi-filament fiber.  The strana was further heated in a heating furnace at 170°C to produce coated yarn of 4,030 denier. The weight ratio of the flame retardant for mesh sheets to the multi-filament fiber was 130/100.<br>
Thereafter, the coated yarn was woven into.a mesh plain weave fabric with a rapier loom at a speed of 50 cm/min with 52 warps/10 cm and 52 wefts/10 cm.  This fabric was then heated in a heating furnace at 160°C to thermally .fuse intersecting points between the warps and wefts to obtain the flameproof mesh sheet of the present invention. Further, this cloth was cut to a width of 190 cm and a length of 520 cm, sewed with a sewing machine and subjected to non-shifting processing to obtain a flameproof mesh sheet<br>
having a width of 180 cm and  length of 520 cm.<br><br><br>
