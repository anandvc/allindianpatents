PATENT ATTORNEY DOCKET NO: 50150/073WO2<br>
RIFAMYCIN ANALOGS AND USES THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of antimicrobial agents.<br>
The use of antibiotics by humans can be seen as an evolutionary experiment of enormous magnitude, a window from which to view not-quite-nataral selection operating in real time. Within 50 years, the number of species and strains of pathogenic and commensal bacteria resistant to antibiotics and the number of antibiotics to which they are resistant has increased virtually monotonically world-wide. As a result, infections that had been readily treatable by chemotherapy may no longer be so. It is clear that the evolution and spread of resistance can be attributed to the use and overuse of antibiotics. Increased resistance of bacterial infections to antibiotic treatment has been extensively documented and has now become a generally recognized medical problem, particularly with nosocomial infections. See, for example, Jones et aL, Diagn. Microbiol Infect Dis. 31:379-388,1998; Murray, Adv. Intern. Med. 42:339-367,1997; and Nakae, Microbiologia 13:273-284,1997.<br>
Throughout the developed world there is public and governmental concern about the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance to chemotherapy in bacteria that cause diseases in humans. Many pathogens exist for which there are few effective treatments, and the number of strains resistant to available drugs is continually increasing. New antimicrobial agents and improved methods are thus needed for the treatment and prevention of infections by such pathogens,<br>

A compound of formula I can be administered to the infected ear by means of drops or by the insertion of a compound-impregnated porous media into the external ear canal to the tympanic membrane. Ear infections that can be treated using the methods and composition of the invention include otitis media and otitis externa. Types of otitis media amenable to treatment include, for example, acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and chronic otitis media. Types of otitis externa include acute otitis externa, chronic otitis externa, and malignant otitis externa.<br>
A compound of the invention can also be administered to the ear (e.g., the tympanic membrane or the external auditory canal of the ear) to treat or prevent bacterial infections associated with otitis media (e.g., an infection of H. influenza, M. catarhalis, or S. pneumoniae) or otitis externa (e.g., an infection of 5. intermedins, Streptococcus spp. Pseudomonas spp., Proteus spp.9 or E. coli).<br>
The methods and compositions of the invention are also useful to treat infections associated with otic surgical procedures such as tympanoplasty, stapedectomy, removal of tumors, or cochlear implant surgery. The compositions may also be used prophylactically, prior to therapies or conditions that can cause ear infections. Compositions containing a compound of formula I can therefore be applied to an area of the ear to which the surgical intervention will be performed, within at least seven days (before or after) of the surgical intervention. When treating a patient affected with otitis externa, an acidification therapy involving the administration of an acetic acid solution to the ear of the patient may also be performed.<br>
Typically, patients are administered one to four drops of a compound of the invention in a total amount between 0.001% and 5% w/v, preferably 0.01% and 3% w/v, more preferably 0.1% and 1% w/v, or most preferably 0.1% and 0.4% w/v. The composition may be given daily (e.g., once, twice, three times, or four times daily) or less freC1uently (e.g., once every other day, or once or<br><br>
twice weekly). Treatment may be for 1 to 21 days, desirably 1 to 14 days, or even 3 to 7 days.  Additional therapeutic agents, such as anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory or steroid), anesthetics, zinc salts, or other antimicrobial agents, can also be administered with a compound of the invention.

By "atherosclerosis" is meant the progressive accumulation of smooth muscle cells, immune cells (e.g., lymphocytes, macrophages, or monocytes), lipid products (e.g., lipoproteins, or cholesterol), cellular waste products, calcium, or other substances within the inner lining of an artery, resulting in the narrowing or obstruction of the blood vessel and the development of atherosclerosis-associated diseases. Atherosclerosis is typically manifested within large and medium-sized arteries, and is often characterized by a state of chronic inflammation within the arteries.<br>
By "atherosclerosis-associated disease" is meant any disorder that is caused by or is associated with atherosclerosis. Typically, atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries commonly causes coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, coronary thrombosis, and angina pectoris. Atherosclerosis of the arteries supplying the central nervous system freC1uently provokes strokes and transient cerebral ischemia. In the peripheral circulation, atherosclerosis causes intermittent claudication and gangrene and can jeopardize limb viability. Atherosclerosis of an artery of the splanchnic circulation can cause mesenteric ischemia. Atherosclerosis can also affect the kidneys directly (e.g., renal artery stenosis).<br><br>
A patient who is being treated for an atherosclerosis-associated disease is one who a medical practitioner has diagnosed as having such a disease. Diagnosis may be by any suitable means. Methods for diagnosing atherosclerosis by measuring systemic inflammatory markers are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 6,040,147, hereby incorporated by reference. Diagnosis and monitoring may employ an electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization, ultrasound (for the measurement of vessel wall thickness), or measurement of blood levels of CPK, CPK-MB, myoglobin, troponin, homocysteine, or C-reactive protein. A patient in whom the development of an atherosclerosis-associated disease is being prevented is one who has not received such a diagnosis. One in the art will understand that these patients may have been subjected to the same tests (electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, etc.) or may have been identified, without examination, as one at high risk due to the presence of one or more risk factors (e.g., family history, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol levels). Thus, prophylactic administration of a rifamycin analog is considered to be preventing the development of an atherosclerosis-associated disease.<br>
An atherosclerosis-associated disease has been treated or prevented when one or more tests of the disease (e.g., any of the those described above) indicate that the patient's condition has improved or the patient's risk reduced. In one example, a reduction in C-reactive protein to normal levels indicates that an atherosclerosis-associated disease has been treated or prevented.<br>
An alternative means by which treatment or prevention is assessed includes determination of the presence of an infection of C. pneumoniae. Any suitable method may be employed (e.g., determination of C. pneumoniae in blood monocytes or in the atheroma itself (e.g., in macrophages or foam cells present in the fatty streak), or detection of C pneumoniae DNA, RNA, or antibodies to G pneumoniae in a biological sample from the patient).<br><br>
By "debris" is meant the mucoid exudate or desC1uamated epithelium in an infected ear of a patient having an ear infection.<br>
By "ear wick" is meant a sponge, cotton, gauze, compressed hydroxycellulose, or any other material used to increase the penetration of rifamycin to the infected otic area. The ear wick is typically inserted into the canal under direct vision. Its presence helps wick eardrops along the canal, hold the solution in contact with the skin of the canal, and apply pressure to the canal skin.<br>
By "granulation tissue" is meant the highly vascularized tissue that replaces the initial fibrin clot in a wound. Vascularization is a result of an ingrowth of capillary endothelium from the surrounding vasculature. The tissue is also rich in fibroblasts and leucocytes.<br>
"Antibiotic-associated bacterial diarrhea" means the condition wherein antibiotic therapy disturbs the balance of the microbial flora of the gut, allowing pathogenic organisms such as C. difficile to flourish. These organisms cause diarrhea. Antibiotic-associated bacterial diarrhea includes such conditions as G difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis.<br>
'Tseudomembranous colitis," also known as pseudomembranous enterocolitis or enteritis, means the inflammation of the mucous membrane of both small and large intestine with the formation and passage of pseudomembranous material (composed of fibrin, mucous, necrotic epithelial cells and leukocytes) in the stools.<br>
By "autoimmune disease" is meant a disease arising from an immune reaction against self-antigens and directed against the individual's own tissues. Examples of autoimmune diseases include but are not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, and Graves' disease.<br>
By tebacteria" is meant a unicellular prokaryotic microorganism that usually multiplies by cell division.<br>
By <ebacterial infection is meant the invasion of a host animal by pathogenic bacteria. for example may include excessive></ebacterial><br>
growth of bacteria that are normally present in or on the body of an animal or growth of bacteria that are not normally present in or on the animal. More generally, a bacterial infection can be any situation in which the presence of a bacterial population(s) is damaging to a host animal. Thus, an animal is "suffering" from a bacterial infection when an excessive amount of a bacterial population is present in or on the animal's body, or when the presence of a bacterial population(s) is damaging the cells or other tissue of the animal.<br>
By "chronic disease" is meant a disease that is inveterate, of long continuance, or progresses slowly, in contrast to an acute disease, which rapidly terminates- A chronic disease may begin with a rapid onset or in a slow, insidious manner but it tends to persist for several weeks, months or years, and has a vague and indefinite termination.<br>
By "immunocompromised" is meant a person who exhibits an attenuated or reduced ability to mount a normal cellular or humoral defense to challenge by infectious agents, e.g., viruses, bacterial, fungi, and protozoa. Persons considered immunocompromised include malnourished patients, patients undergoing surgery and bone narrow transplants, patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy, neutropenic patients, HIV-infected patients, trauma patients, burn patients, patients with chronic or resistant infections such as those resulting from myelodysplastic syndrome, and the elderly, all of who may have weakened immune systems.<br>
By "inflammatory disease" is meant a disease state characterized by (1) alterations in vascular caliber that lead to an increase in blood flow, (2) structural changes in the microvasculature that permit the plasma proteins and leukocytes to leave the circulation, and (3) emigration of the leukocytes from the microcirculation and their accumulation in the focus of injury. The classic signs of acute inflammation are erythema, edema, tenderness (hyperalgesia), and pain. Chronic inflammatory diseases are characterized by infiltration with mononuclear cells (e.g., macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells), tissue destruction, and fibrosis. Non-limiting examples of inflammatory disease<br><br>
include asthma, coronary artery disease, arthritis, conjunctivitis, lymphogranuloma venerum, and salpingitis.<br>
By "intracytoplasmic inclusion" is meant a replicating reticulate body (KB) that has no cell wall. Such inclusions may be detected, for example, through chlamydiae sample isolation and propagation on mammalian cell lines, followed by fixing and staining using one of a variety of staining methods including Giemsa staining, iodine staining, and immunofluorescence. These inclusions have a typical round or oval appearance.<br>
By "persistent bacterial infection" is meant an infection that is not completely eradicated through standard treatment regimens using anti-bacterial agents. Persistent bacterial infections are caused by bacteria capable of establishing a cryptic or latent phase of infection and may be classified as such by culturing the bacteria from a patient and demonstrating bacterial survival in vitro in the presence of anti-bacterial agents or by determination of antibacterial treatment failure in a patient. As used herein, a persistent infection in a patient includes any recurrence of chlamydial infection, after receiving antibacterial treatment, from the same species (e.g., C. trachomatis) more than two times over the period of two or more years or the detection of the cryptic phase of the infection in the patient by the methods described. An in vivo persistent infection can be identified through the use of a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to demonstrate the presence of 16S rRNA transcripts in bacterially infected cells after treatment with anti-bacterial agents (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 12:3288-3297, 2000).<br>
By "replicating phase" is meant the phase of the bacterial cell cycle characterized by the presence of an RB. The RB is the actively replicating form of the Chlamydia. It contains no cell wall and is detected as an inclusion in the cell.<br>
As used herein, fee term "treating" refers to administering or prescribing a pharmaceutical composition for prophylactic and/or therapeutic purposes. To "prevent disease" refers to prophylactic treatment of a patient who is not yet ill, but who is susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of, a particular disease. To "treat<br><br>
disease" or use for "therapeutic treatment" refers to administering treatment to a patient already suffering from a disease to improve the patient's condition. Thus, in the claims and embodiments, treating is the administration to an animal either for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes. An ear infection has been treated when one or more tests of the disease (e.g., any of the those described below) indicate that the patient's condition has improved. The detection of an infection may be done by a pneumatic otoscopic examination of the patient, or by a reduction in infection-associated symptoms in the patient (e.g., inflammation of ear drums, redness of ear drums, presence of fluid in ears). Reduction of symptoms may also be determined, for example, by audiogram to check recovery from hearing loss. Prophylactic administration of a rif amycin of the invention is considered to be preventing the development of an ear infection.<br>
By "effective amount" is meant the amount of a compound reC1uired to treat or prevent an infection. The effective amount of active compound(s) used to practice the present invention for therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of conditions caused by or contributed to by a microbial infection varies depending upon the manner of administration, the age, body weight, and general health of the subject Ultimately, the attending physician or veterinarian will decide the appropriate amount and dosage regimen. Such amount is referred to as an "effective" amount<br>
The term "microbial infection" refers to the invasion of the host animal by pathogenic microbes. This includes the excessive growth of microbes that are normally present in or on the body of an animal. More generally, a microbial infection can be any situation in which the presence of a microbial populations) is damaging to a host animal. Thus, an animal is "suffering" from a microbial infection when excessive numbers of a microbial population are present in or on an animal's body, or when the presence of a microbial population(s) is damaging the cells or other tissue of an animal.<br>
The term "microbes" includes, for example, bacteria, fungi, yeasts, viruses and protozoa.<br><br>
By "intracellular pathogen" is meant an infection by any facultative or obligate intracellular microbe.<br>
By "obligate intracellular pathogen" is meant a microbe that must use an intracellular location (e.g., a host cell) in order to replicate.<br>
By "facultative intracellular pathogen" is meant a microbe that is able to survive within an intracellular location (e.g., a host cell), but does not reC1uire an intracellular environment to replicate.<br>
The term "administration" or "administering" refers to a method of giving a dosage of a pharmaceutical composition to an animal, where the method is, e.g., topical, oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, or intramuscular. The preferred method of administration can vary depending on various factors, e.g., the components of the pharmaceutical composition, site of the potential or actual disease, and severity of disease.<br>
The terms "animal," "subject," and "patient5' specifically include humans, cattle, horses, dogs, cats, and birds, but also can include many other species.<br>

We have identified a method of preventing, stabilizing, or inhibiting the growth of microbes, or killing microbes. The method involves contacting microbes or a site susceptible to microbial growth with a compound of the invention. Compounds of the present invention can be used to treat,<br><br>
stabilize or prevent a microbial infection in an animal. In this method, the step of contacting microbes or a site susceptible to microbial infection (e.g., a site in or on the body of an animal) with a compound of the invention includes administering to the animal the compound in an amount sufficient to treat, stabilize, or prevent the microbial infection in the animal. In a related aspect, the invention features a method of treating any disease associated with such a microbial infection.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be used to treat atherosclerosis or diseases associated therewith, sexually transmitted diseases caused, for example, by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae, otitis media and other ear infections, antibiotic-associated colitis, gastritis and ulcers associated with an infection of H. pylori, Gram-positive infections, community-acC1uired pneumonia, upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, bone and joint infections, hospital-acC1uired lung infections, urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis, intra-abdominal infections, bacteremia, bacterial sepsis, would infections, peritonitis, osteomyelitis, infections after burns, pelvic inflammatory disease, and diseases associated with chronic infections.<br>
Atherosclerosis and other diseases associated with chlamydial infection<br>
An association was previously reported in International Publication No. WO 98/50074 between the cryptic phase of a persistent chlamydial infection of body fluids and/or tissues and several chronic disease syndromes of previously unknown etiology in humans. To date, these diseases include, but are not limited to, atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, interstitial cystitis, fibromyalgia, autonomic nervous dysfunction (neural-mediated hypotension); pyoderma gangrenosum, and chronic fatigue syndrome.<br>
As described in International Publication No. WO 98/50074, several lines of evidence have led to the establishment of a link between Chlamydia and a broad set of inflammatory, autoimmune, and immune deficiency<br><br>
diseases. These include (i) the association between the cryptic phase of a persistent chlamydial infection of body fluids and/or tissues and several chronic disease syndromes as described above, (ii) published evidence of an association between atherosclerosis and Chlamydia (Circulation, 96:404-407, 1997), and (iii) an understanding of the impact the persistent infection established by the cryptic phase of chlamydial infections can have on infected cells and the immune system. Thus, the present invention describes methods for treating chronic diseases associated with the cryptic phase of a persistent chlamydial infection, such as autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and diseases that occur in immunocompromised individuals by treating the cryptic phase of the infection in an individual in need thereof, using the rifamycin analogs described herein. Progress of the treatment can be evaluated, using the diagnostic tests described herein, to determine the presence or absence of Chlamydia. Physical improvement in the conditions and symptoms typically associated with the disease to be treated can also be evaluated. Based upon these evaluating factors, the physician can maintain or modify the anti-bacterial therapy accordingly.<br>
The therapies described herein can be used for the treatment of chronic immune and autoimmune diseases when patients are demonstrated to have a Chlamydia load by the methods of detection described above. These diseases include, but are not limited to, chronic hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, arthritis, thyroidosis, scleroderma, diabetes mellitus, Graves' disease, Behcet's disease, and graft versus host disease (graft rejection). The therapies of this invention can also be used to treat any disorders in which a chlamydial species is a factor or co-factor.<br>
Thus, the present invention can be used to treat a range of disorders in addition to the above immune and autoimmune diseases when demonstrated to be associated with chlamydial infection by the methods of detection described herein; for example, various infections, many of which produce inflammation as primary or secondary symptoms, including, but not limited to, sepsis syndrome, cachexia, circulatory collapse and shock resulting from acute or<br><br>
chronic bacterial infection, acute and chronic parasitic and/or infectious diseases from bacterial, viral or fungal sources, such as a HIV, AIDS (including symptoms of cachexia, autoimmune disorders, AIDS dementia complex and infections) can be treated, as well as Wegners Granulomatosis.<br>
Among the various inflammatory diseases, there are certain features that are generally agreed to be characteristic of the inflammatory process. These include fenestration of the microvasculature, leakage of the elements of blood into the interstitial spaces, and migration of leukocytes into the inflamed tissue. On a macroscopic level, this is usually accompanied by the familiar clinical signs of erythema, edema, tenderness (hyperalgesia), and pain. Inflammatory diseases, such as chronic inflammatory pathologies and vascular inflammatory pathologies, including chronic inflammatory pathologies such as aneurysms, hemorrhoids, sarcoidosis, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease and vascular inflammatory pathologies, such as, but not limited to, disseminated intravascular coagulation, atherosclerosis, and Kawasaki* s pathology are also suitable for treatment by methods described herein. The invention can also be used to treat inflammatory diseases such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, stroke, asthma, chronic hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy, chronic or recurrent sore throat, laryngitis, tracheobronchitis, chronic vascular headaches (including migraines, cluster headaches and tension headaches), and pneumonia.<br>
Treatable disorders when associated with a chlamydial infection also include, but are not limited to, neurodegenerative diseases, including, but not limited to, demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and acute transverse myelitis; extrapyramidal and cerebellar disorders, such as lesions of the corticospinal system; disorders of the basal ganglia or cerebellar disorders; hyperkinetic movement disorders such as Huntington's Chorea and senile chorea; drug-induced movement disorders, such as those induced by drugs which block CNS dopamine receptors; hypokinetic movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease; progressive supranucleo palsy; cerebellar and spinocerebellar disorders, such as astructural lesions of the cerebellum;<br><br>
spinocerebellar degenerations (spinal ataxia, Friedreich's ataxia, cerebellar cortical degenerations, multiple systems degenerations (Mencel, Dejerine-Thomas, Shi-Drager, and Machado Joseph)); and systemic disorders (Refsum's disease, abetalipoprotemia, ataxia, telangiectasia, and mitochondrial multi-system disorder); demyelinating core disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, acute transverse myelitis; disorders of the motor unit, such as neurogenic muscular atrophies (anterior horn cell degeneration, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, infantile spinal mnscular atrophy and juvenile spinal muscular atrophy); Alzheimer's disease; Down's Syndrome in middle age; Diffuse Lewy body disease; senile dementia of Lewy body type; Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome; chronic alcoholism; Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, Hallerrorden-Spatz disease; and Dementia pugilistica, or any subset thereof.<br>
It is also recognized that malignant pathologies involving tumors or other malignancies, such as, but not limited to leukemias (acute, chronic myelocytic, chronic lymphocytic and/or myelodyspastic syndrome); lymphomas (Hodgkkfs and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, such as malignant lymphomas (Burkitt's lymphoma or mycosis fungoides)); carcinomas (such as colon carcinoma) and metastases thereof; cancer-related angiogenesis; infantile hemangiomas; and alcohol-induced hepatitis. Ocular neovascularization, psoriasis, duodenal ulcers, and angiogenesis of the female reproductive tract can also be treated when demonstrated by the diagnostic procedures described herein to be associated with a chlamydial infection.<br>
Ear Infections<br>
Ear infections typically affect the middle or the external ear and include, for example, otitis media, otitis externa, and infections caused by surgical interventions. Due to multiplicity of secondary complications that arise from ear infections such as hearing loss, the treatment and prevention of such conditions is critical.<br><br>
Topical administration of a compound of formula I is effective in treating or preventing an infection of the ear, such as otitis media or otitis externa. In the case of otitis media or externa, infections are primarily caused by H. influenza, M. catarhalis, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. intermedius, S. epidermidis, S. aureus, S. caprae, S. auriculis, S. capitis, S. haemolytis, P. aeroginosa, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, E. faecalis, or E. colt A compound of formula I can be used to treat each of these infections of the ear. A compound of formula I may, for example, be topically administered to the area of the ear to which surgical intervention was performed or, alternatively, the compound may be administered to the ear of the patient prophylactically, prior to otic surgery, noninvasive otic procedures, or other types of surgery. Exemplary surgical procedures include for example, cochlear implant surgery, tympanoplasty, tympanostomy tube insertion, removal of tumors (e.g., cholesteatoma), or stapedectomy. The compound may be administered to the area of the ear to which surgical intervention will be performed, for example, within seven days, two days, one day, 12 hours, 10 hours, 6 hours, 4 hours, 2 hours, 1 hour, or less than 1 hour prior to or following the surgical intervention. The compositions may be used for acute treatment of temporary conditions, or may be administered chronically.<br>
A compound of formula I may be given daily (e.g., once, twice, three times, or four times daily) or less freC1uently (e.g., once every other day, or once or twice weekly). Typically, patients are administered a dosage consisting of one to four drops of solution containing the compound. The compound may be contained in any appropriate amount in any suitable carrier substance, and is generally present in an amount between 0.001% and 5%, desirably 0.01% and 3%, more desirably 0.1% and 1%, and even more desirably 0.1% and 0.4% by weight of the total volume (w/v) of the composition. The compound is provided in a dosage form that is suitable for topical administration. Thus, a composition containing a compound of formula I may be in the form of a solution, aerosol, gel, ointment, nebulizer, or suspension. Alternatively, a compound of the invention may be administered<br><br>
by placing an impregnated porous media into the external ear canal to the tympanic membrane. The pharmaceutical composition can generally be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice.<br>
Aural Toilet<br>
The external auditory canal and tissues lateral to the infected middle ear often are covered with mucoid exudate or desC1uamated epithelium. Since topically applied preparations cannot generally penetrate affected tissues until these interposing materials are removed, aural toilet is desirably performed before administering a compound of formula I. Aural toilet may be performed by a health provider, the patient, or any other individual. Removal of debris may be performed mechanically with the assistance of a microscope and microinstruments. Aural irrigation may also be performed using a solution containing peroxide. The concentration of peroxide should be the highest concentration without causing significant pain, or discomfort, to the patient. As an example, a solution of 50% peroxide and 50% sterile water can be used. Thirty to 40 mL of this solution can be irrigated through the external auditory canal, using a small syringe or bulb-type aspirator. The irrigant solution is allowed to drain out (e.g., for 5*10 minutes) prior to administering a compound of the invention.<br>
Granulation Tissue<br>
Granulation tissue often fills the middle ear and medial portions of the external auditory canal, and reducing this accumulation is beneficial for resolution of an ear infection. Granulation tissue may also prevent topically applied antimicrobial agents from penetrating to 'the site of infection, and the amount of granulation tissue is desirably reduced throughout the regimen.<br>
Although topical antimicrobial drops can reduce granulation by eliminating infection and by removing the inciting irritating inflammation, the amount of granulation tissue may be reduced using other methods known in the<br><br>
art. For example, topical steroids may hasten the resolution of middle ear granulation, thus improving penetration of topically delivered antibiotics.<br>
Cautery may also be used to reduce the amount of granulation tissue and to reduce its formation. Microbipolar cautery may be administered by a health provider. Chemical cautery, using for example silver nitrate, may also be applied to an infected ear in the form of silver nitrate sticks. Excision of granulation tissue may also be performed by a health care provider with a microscope and microinstraments.<br>
Ear Canal Acidification<br>
In a patient affected with otitis externa, a therapy involving ear canal acidification to restore the physiological acidity of the ear may be performed. The affected ear is administered with a solution containing acetic acid, which may also include a steroid (e.g., hydrocortisone), aluminum acetate, or rubbing alcohol.<br>
Topical Formulations<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention can be formulated for topical administration to the ear of the patient. Patients having an ear infection may be administered with effective amounts of a compound of the invention, by means of a solution (e.g., drops), ointment, gel, or aerosol (e.g., nebulizer). The composition is typically administered to the affected otic area by topically applying, for example, one to four drops of a solution or suspension, or a comparable amount of an ointment, gel, or other solid or semisolid composition, once, twice, three times, or more than three times per day. A porous media or an ear wick (e.g., cotton, gauze, or compressed hydroxycellulose) may also be used to increase the penetration of a compound of the invention to the infected otic area. The ear wick, which is inserted into the canal under direct vision, is typically a dried sponge that helps wick eardrops along the canal, hold the solution in contact with the skin of the canal and apply pressure to the canal skin. Wicks may be removed at one day, two<br><br>
days, or more than two days, and may be replaced if necessary. Alternatively, the ear wick may itself be impregnated with a compound of the invention. These formulations can be made according to known and conventional methods for preparing such formulations.<br>
For compounds of the invention that are not highly soluble in water at physiological conditions, a solubilizing excipient may be used to increase solubility. Solubilization is taken to mean an improvement in the solubility by virtue of surface-active compounds that can convert substances that are insoluble or virtually insoluble in water into clear, or opalescent, aC1ueous solutions without changing the chemical structure of these substances in the process. Excipients used for this purpose are restricted to those that are safe for administration to humans. Typically such co-solvents are employed at a level of about 0.01% to 2% by weight.<br>
A variety of solubilizing excipients may be used for the formulation of a compound of the invention, including compounds belonging to the following classes: polyethoxylated fatty acids, PEG-fatty acid diesters, PEG-fatty acid mono-ester and di-ester mixtures, polyethylene glycol glycerol fatty acid esters, alcohol-oil transesterification products, polyglycerized fatty acids, propylene glycol fatty acid esters, mixtures of propylene glycol esters and glycerol esters, mono- and diglycerides, sterol and sterol derivatives, polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers, sugar esters, polyethylene glycol alkyl phenols, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, lower alcohol fatty acid esters, or ionic surfactants. Such excipients are described for example, in U.S. Patent Application No: 60/385,532, hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Ototopical preparations may vary in viscosity. The use of viscosity enhancing agents to provide the compositions of the invention with viscosities greater than the viscosity of simple aC1ueous solutions may be desirable to increase the retention time in the ear. Such viscosity-building agents include, for example, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl<br><br>
cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, or other agents known to those skilled in the art. Such agents are typically employed at a level of about 0.01% to 2% by weight. Optionally, these preparations may include a buffering agent to maintain an acidic pH, since the normal environment of the external auditory canal is acidic. However, if treatment is reC1uired in the middle ear where the pH is neutral, the pH can be adjusted accordingly.<br>
Otic pharmaceutical products are typically packaged in multidose form. Preservatives are thus desired to prevent microbial contamination during use. Suitable preservatives include: polyC1uaternium-1, benzalkonium chloride, thimerosal, chlorobutanol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, phenylethyl alcohol, edetate disodium, sorbic acid, or other agents known to those skilled in the art. Typically such preservatives are employed at a level of from 0.001 % to 1.0% by weight<br>
A penetration enhancer may also be used to facilitate the diffusion of a compound of the invention through the tympanic membrane into the middle and inner ear in order to reduce inflammation of ear tissues. A penetration enhancer is an agent used to increase the permeability of the skin to a pharmacologically active agent to increase the rate at which the drug diffuses through the skin and enters the tissues and bloodstream. A chemical skin penetration enhancer increases skin permeability by reversibly damaging or by altering the physiochemical nature of the stratum corneum to reduce its diffusional resistance (Osborne DW, Henke JJ, Pharmaceutical Technology, November 1997, pp 58-86). Examples of penetration enhancers include without limitation: alcohols, such as ethanol and isopropanol; polyols, such as n-alkanols, limonene, terpenes, dioxolane, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, other glycols, and glycerol; sulfoxides, such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide, methyl dodecyl sulfoxide, dimethylacetamide; esters, such as isopropyl myristate/palmitate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, methyl proprionate, and capric/caprylic triglycerides; ketones; amides, such as acetamides; oleates, such as triolein; various surfactants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate; various alkanoic acids, such as caprylicacid; lactam compounds, such<br><br>
as azone; alkanols, such as oleyl alcohol; dialkylamino acetates, and admixtures thereof. The use of such penetration enhancers is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No 6,093,417, hereby incorporated by reference.<br>

Agents Chemother. 37:67 (1993). Agents can be screened against C. pneumoniae, C trachomatis, M. tuberculosis (including multiple drug resistant strains), M. avium complex, and other intracellular infectious microbes. Details of a standard MIC assay are provided in Example 69.<br>
Therapy<br>
The invention features a method of treating or preventing a disease or condition associated with a microbial infection by administering a compound of formulas (I). Compounds of the present invention may be administered by any appropriate route for treatment or prevention of a disease or condition associated with a microbial infection, inflammation, or infection derived autoimmune disease. These may be administered to humans, domestic pets, livestock, or other animals with a pharmaceuticaHy acceptable diluent, carrier, or excipient, in unit dosage form. Administration may be topical, parenteral, intravenous, intra-arterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intracranial, intraorbital, ophthalmic, intraventricular, intracapsular, intraspinal, intracisternal, intraperitoneal, intranasal, aerosol, by suppositories, or oral administration.<br>
Therapeutic formulations may be in the form of liC1uid solutions or suspensions; for oral administration, formulations may be in the form of tablets<br><br>
or capsules; and for intranasal formulations, in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols.<br>
Methods well known in the art for making formulations are found, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th ed., ed. A.R. Gennaro AR.), Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2000. Formulations for parenteral administration may, for example, contain excipients, sterile water, or saline, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, or hydrogenated napthalenes. Biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymer, lactide/glycolide copolymer, or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers may be used to control the release of the compounds. Nanoparticulate formulations (e.g., biodegradable nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, liposomes) may be used to control the biodistribution of the compounds. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes. Formulations for inhalation may contain excipients, for example, lactose, or may be aC1ueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycholate and deoxycholate, or may be oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel. The concentration of the compound in the formulation will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the dosage of the drug to be administered, and the route of administration.<br>
The compound may be optionally administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, such as a non-toxic acid addition salts or metal complexes that are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. Examples of acid addition salts include organic acids such as acetic, lactic, pamoic, maleic, citric, malic, ascorbic, succinic, benzoic, palmitic, suberic, salicylic, tartaric, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, or trifluoroacetic acids or the like; polymeric acids such as tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose, or the like; and inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid phosphoric acid, or the like. Metal complexes include zinc, iron, and the like.<br><br>
Administration of compounds in controlled release formulations is useful where the compound of formula I, has (i) a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., the difference between the plasma concentration leading to harmful side effects or toxic reactions and the plasma concentration leading to a therapeutic effect is small; generally, the therapeutic index, TT, is defined as the ratio of median lethal dose (LD50) to median effective dose (ED50)); (ii) a narrow absorption window in the gastro-intestinal tract; or (iii) a short biological half-life, so that freC1uent dosing during a day is reC1uired in order to sustain the plasma level at a therapeutic level.<br>
Many strategies can be pursued to obtain controlled release in which the rate of release outweighs the rate of metabolism of the therapeutic compound. For example, controlled release can be obtained by the appropriate selection of formulation parameters and ingredients (e.g., appropriate controlled release compositions and coatings). Examples include single or multiple unit tablet or capsule compositions, oil solutions, suspensions, emulsions, microcapsules, microspheres, nanoparticles, patches, and liposomes.<br>
Formulations for oral use include tablets containing the active ingredient(s) in a mixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents or fillers (e.g., sucrose and sorbitol), lubricating agents, glidants, and antiadhesives (e.g., magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, stearic acid, silicas, hydrogenated vegetable oils, or talc).<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be provided as chewable tablets, or as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of compounds of the invention described herein include isomers such as diastereomers and enantiomers, mixtures of isomers, including racemic mixtures, salts, solvates, and polymorphs thereof.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be used in combination with another antifungal, antiviral, antibacterial, or antiprotozoan compound or combinations<br><br>
thereof. The other agent may be employed as a supplemental antimicrobial for the purpose of broadening the activity spectrum of the therapeutics or to obtain particular effects, such as, to reduce the development of drug resistant microbes. Compounds of the invention can be used either alone or in conjunction with other pharmaceutical compounds to effectively combat a single infection. For example, compounds of the invention may be used either alone or combined with acyclovir in a combination therapy to treat HSV-1. Compounds of the invention may also be used either alone or in conjunction with other pharmaceutical compounds to combat multiple infections. For example, compounds of the invention may be used in combination with one or more anti-mycobacterial agents agents such as isoniazid, pyrazinamide, or ethambutol to treat or prevent intracellular bacterial infections. Compounds of the invention may also be used in combination with Intron A and/or a biflavanoid for treating Hepatitis B; with gancyclovir, progancyclovir, famcyclovir, foscarnet, vidarabine, cidovir, and/or acyclovir for treating herpes viruses; and with ribavarin, amantidine, and/or rimantadine for treating respiratory viruses.<br>
The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how the methods and compounds claimed herein are performed, made, and evaluated, and are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention.<br>
Syntheses of BenzoxazinorifC1-4tycin Compounds<br>
Benzoxazinorifamycin compounds can be prepared using methods that reC1uire the selective protection and deprotection of alcohols, amines, sulfhydryls and/or carboxylic acid functional groups. For example, commonly used protecting groups for amines include carbamates, such as tert-butyl, benzyl, 2,2,2 -trichloroethyl, 2-trimethylsilylethyl, 9-fluorenylmethyl, allyl, and m-nitrophenyl. Other commonly used protecting groups for amines include amides, such as fonnamides, acetamides, trifluoroacetamides,<br><br>
sulfonamides, trifluoromethanesulfonyl amides,<br>
trimethylsUylethanesulfonamides, and tert-butylsulfonyl amides. Examples of commonly used protecting groups for carboxylic acids include esters, such as methyl, ethyl, tort-butyl, 9-fluorenylmethyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy methyl, benzyl, diphenylmethyl, O-nitrobenzyl, ortho-esters, and halo-esters. Examples of commonly used protecting groups for alcohols include ethers, such as methyl, methoxymethyl, methoxyethoxymethyL metbylthiomethyl, benzyloxymethyl, tetrahydropyranyl, ethoxyethyl, benzyl, 2-naptfcylmethyl, O-nitrobenzyl, P-nitrobenzyl, P-methoxybenzyl, 9-phenyixanthyl, trityl (including methoxy-trityls), and silyl ethers. Examples of commonly used protecting groups for sulfhydryls include many of the same protecting groups used for hydroxyls. In addition, sulfhydryls can be protected in a reduced form (e.g., as disulfides) or an oxidized form (e.g., as sulfonic acids, sulfonic esters, or sulfonic amides). Protecting groups can be chosen such that selective conditions (e.g., acidic conditions,-basic conditions, catalysis by a nucleophile, catalysis by a lewis acid, or hydrogenation) are reC1uired to remove each, exclusive of other protecting groups in a molecule. The conditions reC1uired for the addition of protecting groups to amine, alcohol, sulfhydryl, and carboxylic acid functionalities and the conditions reC1uired for their removal are provided in detail in T.W. Green and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (2nd Ed.), John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991 and P.J. Kocienski, Protecting Groups, Georg Thieme Verlag, 1994 (hereby incorporated by reference). In the examples that follow, the use of protecting groups is indicated in a structure by the letter P, where P for any amine, carboxylic acid, sulfhydryl, or alcohol may be any of the protecting groups listed above.<br>
Example 1. General Coupling Procedure<br>
The synthesis of 5'-substituted benzoxazinorifamycin, 5'-substituted benzthiazinorifamycin, and 5'-substituted benzdiazinorifamycin analogs can all proceed through the same general route as shown in Scheme 1, using the general methods disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,965,261 for the attachment of<br><br>
amines to the 5'-position. In this scheme, rifamycin azaC1uinones of formula II are dissolved in a suitable solvent, for example, DMSO, and reacted with amines or the formula HI in the presence of manganese dioxide for several hours at room temperature to form azaC1uinones of formula IV. If reC1uired, azaC1uinones of formula IV can be further reacted with deprotection reagents to remove X at the 25-position, P' at the 21 and 23 positions, and/or any P" protecting group introduced with amines of formula HI. In some embodiments, the 25-position can be further derivatized with groups that introduce useful pharmacodynamic properties, such as groups that transform a rifamycin analog into a prodrug. Such groups are known to those skilled in the art, examples of which can be found in Testa and Mayer, Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Enzymology, published by Vch. Verlagsgesellschaft Mbh. (2003), which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br><br><br>
Compound 200 (LOO g, 1.09 mmol) was dissolved in methyl sulfoxide (10 mL) and treated with an amine of formula V (2.18 mmol) and manganese(TV) oxide (0.95g, 10.9 mmol) for between 12 h to 120 h at rt to 65 °C. The reaction mixture was subseC1uently diluted with ethyl acetate, filtered through celite, washed with water (x3), and dried over Na2SO4. Filtration, followed by removal of the solvent in vacuo, yielded a residue that was purified via flash chromatography (silica gel) using an appropriate solvent system, such as 1-10% methanol in methylene chloride, to produce abenzoxazinorifamycin of formula VI. If further purification is desired, a second column employing Cjg silica gel, using an appropriate solvent system such as 10% water in methanol, was performed.<br>
Alternatively, using the methods described in Helv. Chim. Acta 56:2369 (1973), a rifamycin C1uinone of formula VH can be reacted with an aniline of formula VHI, as shown in Scheme 2, to produce an azaC1uinone of formula EX.<br><br><br>
Example 2. General deacetylation procedure<br>
A compound of formula VI (~ 100 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (5 mL) and then treated with saturated sodium hydroxide in methanol solution (5 mL) for between 0.5 h to 3 h at rt. The reaction mixture was then poured into saturated ammonium chloride solution and extracted with chloroform. The organics were washed with water (2x) and dried over Na2S04. Filtration, followed by removal of the solvent in vacuo, yielded the desired des-acetyl product of formula X. If desired, these products were purified via flash chromatography (silica gel) using an appropriate solvent system, such as 1-10% methanol in methylene chloride.<br><br><br>

dihydroxypropylcarbono^<br>
1-piperazinyi] benzoxazinorifamycin (compound 242)<br><br>
Compound 241 (0.20 g) and l-0-C1-4oroformyl-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D,L-glycerol (0.90 g, see Seligson, et aL, Anticancer Drugs 12: 305-13,2001) are dissolved in dry CH2CI2 (4 mL) and cooled to -70°C under argon. Pyridine (0.28 mL) is added, the cold bath removed, and the reaction stirred at room temperature for 4.5 hours. The organics are washed with water and dried over magnesium sulfate. After filtration and concentration under reduced pressure, the resulting solution is purified by silica gel chromatography (CH2Cl2/acetone) to yield compound 242.<br><br>
Example 68. Synthesis of 25-0-deacetyl-25-(2'\3"-dihydroxypropylcarbonoxy)-5'~[4-isobutyl-l-piperazinyl]benzoxazinoiifainycin, (compound 244)<br><br>
The general coupling procedure of Example 1 is used to prepare the title compound. To compound 242 (0.20 g) in 3 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide is added 100 mg of 4-isobutylpiperazine and 0.2 g of manganese dioxide. The mixture stirred at room temperature for 5 days. The reaction mixture is diluted by addition of ethyl acetate and insoluble substances are filtered off. The filtrate is washed successively with water and with a saturated aC1ueous solution of sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After the drying agent is filtered off, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The residue is purified twice by silica-gel column-chromatography [eluent: ethyl acetate/hexane, 1:1 to 9:1 gradient] to give 25-0-deacetyl-25-(2",3"-dihydroxypropylcarbonoxy)-21,23-(l-methylethyhdeneacet^)-5'-[4-isobutyl-1-piperazinyl] benzoxazinorifamycin (compound 243).<br>
Compound 243 is dissolved in THF (2 mL) and 3% (v/v) sulfuric acid/water (0.7 mL) is added. The reaction mixture is stirred for 16 hours at 40°C. After cooling, the reaction mixture is diluted with water (5 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 10 mL).<br><br>
The combined organics are dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the volatiles removed under reduced pressure to give 25-0-deacetyl-25-(2",3"-dihydroxypropylcarbonoxy)-5 '-[4-isobutyl-1-piperazinyl]benzoxazinorifamycin, compound 244.<br>
Example 69. MIC Assay<br>
MICs of candidate compounds of the invention can be determined, for example, by the method of Lee et aL, Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 136:349 (1987). To a BACTEC 12B vial (4 mL of 7H12B medium), 0,1 mL of a 10-fold dilution of subculture of die test organisms in 7H9 medium (optical density at 540 nm, 0.1) is inoculated and cultured at 37 °C until a growth index (GI) of 999 is reached. Then the broth culture is removed and diluted 100-fold, and 0.1 mL of the dilution is inoculated into a BACTEC 12B vial with or without a candidate compound. The candidate compound containing vials can hold 0.1 mL of candidate compound solution appropriately diluted to obtain the desired concentration. A 1% control vial, 0.1 mL of the 100-fold dilution of the inoculum described above, is inoculated into 12B vial without candidate compound. The 12B vials are incubated at 37 °C, and GI readings recorded daily, using a BACTEC 460 TB instrument (Johnston Laboratories, Townsend, Md.)9 until the control vial reaches a GI greater than 30. When the final readings in the GI of the candidate containing vials are lower than those of the 1% control, the drug is considered to have inhibited more than 99% of the bacterial population, and this concentration will be defined as the MIC.<br>
