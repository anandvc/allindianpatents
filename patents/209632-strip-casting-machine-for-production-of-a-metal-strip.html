The invention pertains to a strip-casting machine for ::he production of a metal strip with two adjacent casting rolls with lateral surfaces of a certain width which form a casting gap between them, the end surfaces of the rolls being provided with side seals, the rolls being rotatably supported on a machine stand and driven by at least one motor^ where the metal melt is supplied through at least one casting tube or the like to the area betv/een the casting rolls and the sice seals, and is protected by at least one gaseous medium.<br>
In a strip-casting machine of the generic type in question according to the publication WO-A'97/34,718, the hori2ontally mounted casting rolls are supported in a machine framer which carries the rolls; a distribution vessel rests on the frame.  To seal off rhe surface of the metal bath, a plate is -provided over the bath, approximately parallel to its surface, which seals off the two casting rolls. .Underneath the casting rolls are separate wall parts, which adjoin the machine frame, and a multipart box, which is adjacent to the wall parrs.  The strip emerges from this<br><br>
box.  The disadvantage of this strip^casting machine is the relatively complicated design used to seal off the metal bath and/or the metal strip produced.<br>
■ In another known twin-roll strip-casting machine according to the publication EP-A-0 780 177, a box-like container is provided t.o seal off the solidified metal strip emerging underneath from the gap between the casting rolls.  The walls of this conta.iner extend all the way to the bottom parts of the outer jackets of the casting rolls^ where a seal is created by a sealing element.  This type of seal/ however, is relatively complicated in design and expensive to maintain and also entails undesirable contact between the sealing element and the rotating casting roll.  When leaks occurr there is the danger that scale can form en the metal strip, which lowers rhe quality of the product.<br>
Against this background, the present invention was based on the task of creating a strip-casting machine of the generic type indicated above, by means of which both the metal bath or the produced metal strip and the casting rolls can be sealed off satisfactorily from the ambient air and also so that the operation and maintenance of the machine can be simplified.<br>
The task is accomplished according to the invention in that<br><br>
a preferably multipart housing encloses at least the lateral surfaces and ends of the casting rolls and the side seals.<br>
With this design of the strip-casting machine according to the invention, it is easy to achieve an optimum seal for both the metal bath present between the rolls and the metal strip emerging underneath from between the casting rolls.<br>
The casting rolls and the side seals, however, can nevertheless be made accessible quickly and easily for the purpose of repair and maintenance, as a result of which the output of the machine can be increased.<br>
In a highly advantageous design, the housing for the metal strip emeiging underneath from the casting gap between the cas":ing rclls is adjoined by a longitudinal housing with a chai!\ber, where the chamber formed by the housing is connected by an opening to the adjoining chamber of the longitudinal housing.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention and additional advantages offered by it are explained in greater detail below on the basis of the drawing:<br>
—	Figure 1 shows a schematic longitudinal section through a strip-casting machine according to the invention;<br>
—	Figure 2 shows a cross section of a housing along the axes of the casting rolls of a strip^casting machine according to<br><br>
the invention;<br>
-* Figure 3 shows a cross section through the housing according to Figure 2; and<br>
— Figure 4 shows a schematic view of another variant of a strip-casting machine.<br>
Figure 1 shows a strip-casting machine 20 for the production ' of a metal strip 15, especially a steel strip, which can be produced in a continuous casting process.  This strip-casting machine 2C is mounted on a stage 12 and is supplied with metal melt 16 from a distribution vessel 18 installed above the machine, as is known from conventional continuous casting sysiems.  It is advisable for the distribution vessel 18 to have a pouring opening 17, which can be closed by a stopper 19 or the like, and a casting tube 13, extending to a point between the cas':ing rolls 22, 24, through which the melt can flow out*<br>
The main components of this strip-casting machine 20 are the two essentially parallel casting rolls 22, 24, the axes of which are approximately horizontal.  A side seal 25 is provided at each<br>
*<br>
end of the rolls, as a result of which an opening 26 is formed^<br>
A<br>
which is closed on all sides and which has the casting gap 15' at the bottom.  Each of the casting rolls 22, 24 is supported rotatably at each end on a machine stand 32 and is driven, by a<br>
4<br><br>
motor integrated into the stand.<br>
According to the invention, the casting rolls 11,   24 are surrounded by a closable housing 30, which has an opening 30' in the top for the casting tube 13, which projects into the area between the casting rolls 11^   24, and an opening 30' in the bottom for the emerging metal strip 15.  These openings 30\ 30" are sealed, and the chamber 33 inside the housing is filled with a shielding gas, preferably an inert gas, during the casting operation.  In cases where two or more casting tubes are used, it would be possible for several openings 30' to be provided in the top.  These openings Qould be round or slot-shaped, and there does not necessarily have to be a casting tube in each one.<br>
It is highly advantageous for this box-shaped housing 30 to be a certain distance away from the sides and the top of the casting rolls 22, 24 or from the machine stand 32, so that there is no need for the sealing elements required in the case of the cas-ing machine according to the previously cited publication EP-A-0 780 177 to seal the metal melt off from the outside.<br>
In the top, this housing 30 is provided with two horizontal doors 35, which are designed so that they can be slid horizontally from the closed position shown in Figure 1 into an open position.  For this purpose, they are guided laterally in<br><br>
appropriate rails (not shown), and it is advantageous for them ro be lowered into the closed position shown so that the housing 30 can be sealed in the desired manner.<br>
It would also be possible^ however, LO provide only one door, which would in any case reduce the number of gaps to be sealed- "t  would be advantageous for this one door to be approximately equal in size to the two doors 35 shown and to be provided with an appropriate opening 30' for the passage of mel-z.<br>
In addition, the housing 30 is also provided with openings 39, which can be closed by doors 36.  These openings make it possible for the side seals 25 of the cashing rolls 22,   24 to be guided by manipulators 40, which are free to travel outside the housing 3C and which are thus able to remove the side seals from thfiir operating positions shown and to take them out through these oper^ings 39 and return them to the housing 30 again.  The manipularcr 40 in question has for this purpose a support arm 41 and a drive 42,   which can adjust the height of the arm^  The manipulator can"thus be moved from an operating position to a retracted maintenance position and back again.  In the operating position of the manipulator 40, the unsealed opening 39 can be sealed off by means of a separate shield enclosure 38,  This shield enclosure 38 surrounds the manipulator 40 and rests<br><br>
tightly against the side of the housing 30.  Cassettes 88 are also indicated, which are used to bring ':he side seals up into position and to carry tham away.<br>
Another advantage obtained within the scope of the invention is that the cast metal strip 15 is guided underneath the housing 30 into an additional longitudinal housing 44, which forms a cha.-mber 4!i, in which a shielding gas is also present in order to protect the metal strip 15 from contact wi-th oxygen and especially to prevent the formation of ^cale.  In this chamber 44r several rollers 46 and compression rolls 47 are installed, so that the r.etal strip 15 is guided through this longitudinal housing 44 and through a sealed opening 46 in one end of the housing*  After it emerges from the housing 44, the metal strip, which has cooled by this point, can be coiled up, for example, or sent on for further processing.<br>
In addition, the longitudinal housing 4 4 has a pit 4 9 underneath the opening 30^' and thus underneath the casting gap 15'. h  collecting tank 52 is provided in this pit in the plant floor 51.  This collecting tank 52 has the task of collecting any liquid metal which might escape from between the casting rolls in the event of a leak and thus of preventing any damage from occurring.  Above this tank 52 are also swinging guide flaps 54,<br><br>
55, which form a pass-through opening in the position shown, whereas in the pivoted position 54', 55' they form a guide path for the metal strip 15*<br>
In the state of the casting operation illustrated in Figure 1, the top opening 30' in the housing 30 is sealed off by a bellows 1;L or the like, which connects the housing to the vessel 19,  The !3leeve^like bellows 11 surrounds the casting tube 13. The casting tube could also be omitted and the melt simply allowed to fall freely.  The lower opening 30" in the housing, through which the strip 15 passesr can be sealed off by a sealing device in the form of a gas shield,- for example, produced by nozzles 3<. in principle however this sealing device could also be omitted and the opening thus lead directly to chamber></.>
In addition, the housing 30 has a feed line (not shown) for the injection of a shielding gas into the interior space 33. Shielding gas can also be supplied to the distribution vessel IB, which is provided with a cover.  The gas introduced into the housing 30 can be cooled and returned through a gas circuit* Upon completion of the casting operation and before the housing is opened, the shielding gas can be pumped out and into a storage tank, and the air in it can be filtered out if desired.<br><br>
Figures 2 and 3 show the principle of a variant of a strip-casting machine, which is designed basically in the same way as the machine according to Figure 1.  In this strip-casting machine, a  housing 60 is providedr which, according to the invention, surrounds the casting rolls 22, 24.  The multipart housing 60 extends around both the lateral surfaces and the ends of the rc:.ls and thus also encloses the side seals 62.  The motor stands 61 supporting the■axles 54 of the casting rolls 22^ 24, however, are not enclosed.  The housing 60 surrounds the axles at both ends of the casting rolls cind  also the drive 66 of the seals G2.     At the top, it is a certain distante away from the indicated melt distribution vessel 18<br><br>
The multipart housing 60 is provided with a base 67 where it meets the longitudinal housing 65; the base can be attached by fastening elements 69 to the longitudinal housing.<br>
Between the housing 60 and the longixudinal housing 65, an opening 70 is present, which connects these two housings 60, 65 to each other.  The longitudinal housing 65 is advantageously sealed all the way around and has only one sealed outlet for the cast metal strip 15,<br>
Figure 4 shows a s'lirip-casting machine according tc the invention^ -again wirh two casting rolls 22, 24, which are contained in a housing 80.  This housing 80 consists of double side walls 81 and a cover 82, which is supported so that it can be lifted off, as indicated by "he cover B2', which has been removed.<br>
Within the scope of the invention, the housing 8 0 surrounds the casting rolls 22, 24 and the side seals 83.  In addition, the housing has an opening 6 4 at the bottom, which communicates with the chamber 85' of a longitudinal housing 85.  The housing 80 is positioned in a frame stand 88, which has wheels 87, which are guided on rails 89 •<br><br>
It iS advantageous, furthermore, for both the housing BO and the longitudinal housing 65 to be wster-cooled, so that their temperature does not increase excessively during continuous operation.<br>
With this strip-casting machine according to Figure 4, a design which is independent of format has been created, because the housing can be mads larger or smaller, depending on  the diaiaeter of the casting rolls.<br><br><br><br><br>
