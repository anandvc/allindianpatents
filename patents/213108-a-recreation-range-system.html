Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a plan view of recreation range according to a preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a sectioned elevation view of the recreation range of figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 is an enlarged portion of the section elevation view of figure 2.<br><br>
Figure 4 is a sectioned elevetion view of a further preferred embodiment of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OP PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A first preferred embodiment of a recreation range 10 according to the invention will now be described with reference to Figures 1 to 3.<br>
Accordingly in figure 1 is shown a field 11 of ovoid shape with periphery 12 and range carousel 13 offset from the field center. Preferably range carousel 13 is located at a somewhat higher level than the periphery 12 so that the surface 14 of field 11 slopes downwardly towards the periphery 12, the slope being sufficient to allow a ball 15 to roll towards periphery 12.<br>
Arranged around periphery 12 of field 11 are target structures 16. Also arranged around periphery 12 are ball collection troughs 17 provided with underground shafts 18 sloping downwardly to the center cf range carousel 13 to provide ball retrieval means. Range; carousel 13 is offset from the field center so as to give as wide a range of distances as possible from the carousel 13 to the target structures 16 at field periphery 12.<br>
In an alternative preferred embodiment illustrated in figure 4, the field 11 is constructed as a suspended surface  19  overlying a dished subsurface 2 0  where  the<br><br>
subsurface 2 0 rises from the center of range carousel 13 to the periphery 12 of the field 11. Peripheral openings 21 in the suspended field surface 18 allow for the entry of balls 15, these balls then rolling down the dished subsurface to collect at the central support column 22 of range carousel 13.<br>
In a preferred embodiment as shown in figures 2 and 3 range carousel 13 is constructed with two player levels, upper level 23 and lower level 24 forming circular discs around central support column 22. The outer annular segment of each player level is divided into a plurality of player lanes 25 as may best be seen in figure 1. Upper level 23 is further provided with annular safety net 26 extending outwardly from its periphery.<br>
Range carousel 13 is rotatably supported on bearings and driven by a suitable power source and drive train (not shown) to rotate the carousel about its central axis 2 7. Thus each player lane 25 is brought into alignment with every target structure 16 and any other feature of field 11 once every revolution of range carousel 13.<br>
Each player lane 2 5 is provided with a ball delivery means 28 fed from a central ball distribution system 29 located in central support column 22. In a preferred embodiment,  at  least  three sizes of balls  15 may be<br><br>
selected by a player 30 so as to allow for players from young children to adults.<br>
As well as being able to select a ball from the ball delivery means 2 8 of the range carousel 13, a player 3 0 may elect to be passed a ball from any one of a number of ball mortars 31 disposed at various distances from the range carousel 13 and generally radial to its center. The manner of the pass is further selectable by a player 30 so that the trajectory 32 and delivery of the ball 15 by the ball mortar 31 may simulate a variety of typical passes such as experienced in the game of soccer. Thus by means of the two methods of ball supply, a player may for example elect to kick a placed ball, kick a ball on the volley, "head" or "chest" a ball.<br>
Balls 15 kicked or otherwise ejected by players 3 0 from the range carousel 13 may hit one of the target structures 16 at the field periphery 12 or fall short onto the sloping surface 14 or 19 of the field 11. In either case a used ball 15 will roll into a ball collection through 17 or peripheral opening 21 and subsequently into its associated underground shaft 19 or onto subsurface 2 0 to thence roll downwardly to the central support column 22 of the range carousel 13.<br><br>
Located in the base of the central support column 22 is ball collection and sorting chamber 33. For clarity-figure 3 shows only a single size ball distribution system 29 but separate distribution pathways are provided for each size of ball offered for play. After sorting in chamber 33 balls 15 are raised to the upper level 2 3 for further distribution to the player lanes 25 on each player level.<br>
Balls are provided sequentially for the duration of a playing session. In one preferred embodiment a playing session is limited to one revolution of the range carousel.<br>
All balls are provided with a unique electronically readable recognition code. Target structures 16 are in this embodiment provided with a variety of target images which are fitted with sensors adapted to register the impact and recognition code of a ball. Sensors are associated with particular target images so that a point crediting system may award points to a player whose ball impacts a particular target image. Points gained by a player during a playing session are accrued to accord a score to the player. The score so gained is stored in a central database facility for subsequent retrieval if desired. Thus a players may play for the highest score among a group of players or an individual player may attempt to better his previous score in subsequent playing sessions.<br><br>
To allow a player to select a method of play (ball from range carousel delivery means or from a ball mortar) and as a means of communicating a target hit and any points scored, each player lane is provided with a player terminal 34. Player terminals are provided with selection input means and score display means. Optionally terminals could also function as fee collection stc.tions to allow a player to make deposits of playing fees for as many playing sessions as he or she wishes to play. Optionally terminals may include a printing means so as 'to provide a player with a printed record of the game played and the points and score attained.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment the surface of field 11 may be provided with a number of demarcated areas in the vicinity of the range carousel, these areas provided with impact and coded registering sensors so as to allow players to practice heading or high kicking a ball with accuracy to land on a selected demarcated area.<br>
Clearly the basic recreation range herein described may be adapted in various ways to provide additional interest to players as well as providing additional revenue streams to the recreation range operator. Thus by way of example, certain target images or accrued scores may be associated with special prizes; target structures may be<br><br>
adapted to carry advertising for products and the range carousel could be provided with kiosk facilities.<br><br><br>
