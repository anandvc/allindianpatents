COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10) <br><br>
A COSMETIC SKIN LIGHTENING <br>
PRODUCT<br>
DUAL COMPARTMENT PACKAGED COSMETIC COMPOSITION<br><br><br><br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification   particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
11-2-2004<br><br>
WO 03/015739<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09110<br><br><br>
The invention concerns cosmetic compositions for lightening skin color.<br>
A variety of products exist for helping consumers arrive at a whiter skin complexion.  The literature describes these products and related approaches.  For instance, U.S. Patent 4,096,240 (Mathur) reports the combination of niacinamide and sunscreens.  EP 0 396 422 (Natraj et al.) describes enhancement of niacinamide performance through formulations containing a silicone compound and both a UVA and UVB sunscreen.<br>
Treatment regimes are reported in U.S. Patent 5,914,116 (Suares et al.).  The patent discloses dual compartment packages for sequential delivery of first and second active materials.  Among listed actives are skin lighteners such as niacinamide.  This disclosure places emphasis on the actives but provides very little instruction on selection of the best carrier systems.  Indeed, no consideration is given to the possible beneficial impact potentially available through selection of carriers for the actives.<br>
Some consumers, especially those with dark complexion have a very oily skin".  Whitening products must be formulated to also address the oiliness comolication.<br>
CONFIRMATION COPY<br><br>
WO 03/015739<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09110<br><br>
Accordingly, it is an advantage of the present invention to provide a skin lightening product with improved effectiveness.<br>
   Another advantage of the present invention is to provide a                        5  skin lightening product operative on oily skin and providing    <br>
   sufficient moisturization during evening hours.<br>
These and other advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent through consideration of the following summary and detailed discussion.<br>
10  According to a first aspect of the invention, there is<br>
provided a cosmetic skin lightening product delivered from a dual chamber package which includes:<br>
(A) a first composition within a first chamber of the dual chamber package, the composition including:<br>
15	(i)   from about 5 to about 50% of stearic acid by<br>
weight of the first composition;<br>
(ii)   from about,.0.01 to about. 10%. of a. skin lightening agent by weight of the first composition;<br>
20	(B) a second composition within a second chamber of the<br>
dual-chamber package, the second composition including:<br>
(i)   from about 0.01 to about 40% of stearic acid by weight of the second composition;<br><br>
WO 03/015739<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09110<br><br><br>
(ii-) from  about .0 .01 to about 10.% of a skin<br>
             lightening agent by weight of the second<br>
composition; and<br>
wherein the stearic acid is present in a higher<br>
5	amount in the first than in the second composition.<br>
Not only actives but vehicles delivering those actives in sequential application from separate dual-chamber packaged compositions can have a significant impact upon performance. More specifically, advantages of the present invention are<br>
10  achieved by applying a first skin lightening composition characterized by a high stearic acid base carrier to an intended treatment area.  A second composition containing a further amount of skin lightening agent in a relatively low stearic acid content base carrier is subsequently applied to<br>
25  the treatment area. The first and second treatments preferably are applied respectively during daylight and night-time hours.  Sequential application of these compositions results in an optimum fairness improvement over application of the separate compositions.  More specifically,<br>
 30  the high stearic acid base carrier imparts the skin with a good appearance (improved skin fairness).  In a complementary fashion, the low stearic acid content base carrier facilitates transference of the skin lightening actives into the epidermis.  Thus, the system of this invention provides<br>
35  an optimum combination of appearance and delivery benefits.<br>
The first composition of the present invention will have levels of stearic acid ranging from about 5% to about 50%, preferably from about 10 to about 40%, optimally from about 15 to about 25% by weight of the first composition.  The<br><br>
WO03/015739<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09110<br><br>
second composition will have levels of stearic acid ranging from about 0.01 to" about 40%, preferably from about 0.5 to about 20%, optimally from about 1 to about 4% by weight of the second composition.<br>
5  Advantageously the stearic acid may be present as asymmetric solid particles.  Asymmetric is understood to mean that at least two of three dimensions on a majority of the particles are not size identical.  These particles can be oval or plate-like.  Average particle size along greatest length may<br>
10  range from about 0.01 to about 500 micron and preferably from about 1 to about 100 micron.  The particles are employed in the composition to impart a cream-like viscosity.  By virtue of being asymmetric, the particles deliver high skin friction.  The term "acid" as employed herein does not<br>
15  exclude the presence of a salt of stearic acid depending upon the pH of the final composition.  For instance, sodium, potassium or ammonium salts may be present.  The salt amount is included in the amount of fatty acid.  Most preferably, however, the stearic acid is present in its non-salt form.<br>
20  First and second compositions of the present invention may have a viscosity which can range from about 40 Pascal-second (PaS) at a shear rate of l reciprocal second (1/s), preferably in a viscosity ranging from about 40 PaS to about 3 00 PaS, more preferably from about 60 to about 12 0 PaS.<br>
2	5  Viscosity is measured using" any viscometer or Rheometer with<br>
    a shear rate of 1/s, at ambient temperature 25°C.  Suitable    <br>
    viscometers/rheometers are Brookfield, Eaake and Bohlin with           <br>
     cone:,and plate, fixtures..,Viscosity. of. the second .composition preferably <br>
    is higher than that" of the first to ensure higher<br>
3	0  moisturization.<br><br>
WO 03/015739<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09110<br><br>
First and second compositions are separately but sequentially applied to a skin treatment area.  Usually the first composition is permitted to remain on the treatment area for 1 to 48 hours, but preferably 6 to 12 hours before                                             application of the second composition.  Advantageously, the sequential use can be in the form of a day and night time application, respectively.  Consumers may be alerted to this sequential treatment regime by instructions provided with the packaging of the compositions.<br>
  Another useful component of compositions according to the present invention is that of an emollient, especially a liquid oil emollient. Amounts of the emollient may range from about 0.1 to about 40%, preferably from about 1 to about 30%, optimallyfrom about 5 to about 25% by weight of each of<br>
the first and second compositions. In particular, the amount of emollient present in the second composition advantageously is in a higher amount than in the first composition.<br>

EXAMPLE   2<br>
Variable Illumination Angle Photography<br><br>
A clinical evaluation was performed to determine the effectiveness in promotion skin fairness   (whitening)   using the 5  first and second compositions (Samples A and B, respectively) outlined under Tables I and II of the first Example.  Variable Illumination Angle Photography was employed to measure performance differences.<br>
An image collection approach was utilized which exploited the 0  concept that, apart from coherence effects, images collected with linear detectors under different lighting conditions can be added to produce the same image that would be observed if all lights were on simultaneously.  In this manner, several images were collected with directional illumination.  These 5  images were then added together to create an image with diffuse illumination.  The crow's foot region adjacent the eyes was focused upon as treatment area.<br>
 Eight fiber ends were mounted in a semi-circle so that they all illuminated the same spot.  A shutter was mounted in<br>
   front of each fiber bundle tip.  The semi-circle illuminator was tilted approximately 2 0 degrees above horizontal and a video camera aimed under it with a fixed focus on the illumination area.  The shutters and the camera were under computer control.  In approximately two seconds, eight<br>
 images were collected.  The subject was positioned using a head brace.<br>
   The eight images were added together to produce the same image that would have occurred if multiple lights were turned on.<br><br><br><br>
Short movies were generated showing the subject under changing illumination.  Forced choice, questions were. asked regarding each pair of movies.  Among the questions were which subject exhibited fewer signs of aging and which was better looking.                           Movies compared were taken 30-60 minutes after, normal<br>
application of the Sample A or Sample 3 formulations on two subjects.  Nine observers compared products on subject 1 three times and on subject 2 five times.<br>
Table I formula Sample A treated skin was found better 0  looking in 51 of 71 comparisons.  Further, Sample A treated skin showed fewer signs of aging with 49 votes of 71 total.<br>
statistical likelihood that the above results could have arisen from random guessing is less than 1% using the 5  cumulative probability of getting 51/71 or 49/71 in 50% trials.<br>
As each observer has a different reliability consistently answering a forced choice question, one can also weight the results by. ohserver variability five of the 9 observers 0  gave highly consistent results across trials, the other 4 performed more erratically.  The reliable observers unanimously preferred the appearance of the Sample A cream in" both questions.<br>
' Dermal Delivery Comparison<br>
    Skin delivery of a typical skin whitening agent<br>
(niacinamide) was measured after treatment according to   three different dosing regimens comprised of the<br>
compositions in Tables I and II. These were the high<br><br>
WO 03/015739<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09110<br><br>
stearic acid(Sample A) and low stearic acid (Sample B)<br>
formulas of the first and second compositions reported in the Tables.  The three dosing regimens were 1.) Sample A -Sample A, 2 .) Sample 3 - Sample A, and 3.)  Sample B -                               Sample B, in which the second sample of each pair was applied twelve hours after the first sample of the pair. The samples were tested in  vitro  using by-product Yucatan piglet skin and Bronaugh flow-through cells.  Dorsal skin from a female weanling Yucatan was shaved and sectioned to<br>
 380 um thickness using a Padgett Dermatome® and mounted in<br>
Bronaugh diffusion cells with 0.64-cm2 skin surface exposure<br>
(Crown Glass, Soramerville, NJ).  Skin barrier integrity was confirmed by trans-epidermal water loss measurement.  The cells were maintained at 32°C in cell warmers and the lower,<br>
 dermal, skin surface was perfused with balanced salts buffer with bacteriostat at 8 ml/hour.  Samples A and B were spiked with radiotracer 14C-niacinamide at 60 uCi/gram and equilibrated for 72 hours.  Homogenicity of radiotracer was confirmed by sampling aliquots from the top, middle and<br>
  bottom of the. vials.<br>
The skin discs were dosed with 4 ma of the first product from each regimen pair, and spread on the 9-mm diameter exposed skin surface with a microcapillary glass rod.  Seven replicates were dosed' with the initial regimen component for<br>
  each regimen pair, with the regimen pairs distributed<br>
equally among the sample warmers.  After twelve hours of skin contact with the initial component  of  each regimen pair, the exposed skin surfaces were rinsed three times with approximately 1-ml'of water and blotted dry with a cotton-<br>
 tip applicator.<br><br>
WO 03/015739<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09110<br><br>
The skin discs were then dosed with the second product from each respective regimen pair in exactly the same way, ie. 4 of product spread on the exposed skin surface with a microcapillary glass rod. Following twelve hours of skin                                                     contact with the second component of each regimen pair, the skin surfaces were again rinsed three times with about 1-ml water. The skin discs were then removed from the apparatus and blotted with Kim Wipe strips.  The upper surfaces were<br>
tape-stripped ten times with Scotch®  transparent tape to<br>
     remove the non-viable stratum corneum barrier layer, and the epidermis was separated from the dermis with a scalpel. Epidermis was sonicated in 500 uL water, and dermis samples were digested with NCS tissue solubilizer.  All samples were then analyzed for 14C-niacinamide in a solvent-appropriate<br>
     scintillation cocktail using a Beckman 6500 liquid scintillation counter.<br>
Results indicated that after the total 24-hour regimen, niacinamide deposition in the viable skin was greatest for the Sample B - Sample A regimen, compared to Sample A -<br>
    Sample A or sample B sample B The results suggest that alternate dosing with the low and high stearic base formulas exploits and synergizes the tissue deposition characteristics of the individual formulas to deliver maximum" niacinamide skin lightening benefit compared to<br>
 repetitive dosing with either the high stearic or low<br>
stearic base formulas alone.  Results are presented in the Table below as percent of applied dose accumulated in each viable tissue compartment after the total 24 hours of regimen "sample contact time.<br><br><br>
