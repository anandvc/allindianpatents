				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method for matching of a repair paint to texture<br>
properties, and optionally colour, of a paint film on a substrate to be repaired.<br>
Repairing painted surfaces requires that the repair paint visually matches the originally<br>
applied paint film. To this end, the colour of the original paint film is measured and<br>
subsequently a paint composition is determined having substantially the same colour<br>
within a predetermined tolerance. This can be done by searching a suitable paint<br>
composition in a databank or a suitable paint composition can be calculated based on the<br>
colorimetric data of the paint components.<br>
To allow easy formulation of matching paints in any colour, toners are often used. Toners<br>
are compositions of base colours comprising all ingredients which make up a complete<br>
paint. These toners can be mixed to obtain a paint of a colour, which after being applied<br>
and dried as a paint film, matches the colour of the paint originally coating the substrate. -<br>
Based on the colorimetric data of the individual toners, the colorimetric features of<br>
mixtures can be predicted by calculation, taking into account the concentrations of the<br>
toners used. Alternatively, paint compositions can be formulated on basis of other types<br>
of modules, such as pigment concentrates, binder modules, effect modules, components<br>
comprising flop-controllers, etc.<br>
Besides colour, a paint film shows numerous further visual properties. Particularly when<br>
effect pigments, such as for example aluminum flake pigments or pearlescent pigments,<br>
are used, the look of a paint film is not of a uniform colour, but shows texture. This can<br>
include phenomena as coarseness, glints, micro-brilliance, cloudiness, mottle, speckle,<br>
sparkle or glitter. In the following, texture is defined as the visible surface structure in the<br>
plane of the paint film depending on the size and organization of small constituent parts<br>
of a<br><br>
material. In this context, texture does not include roughness of the paint film but<br>
only the visual irregularities in the plane of the paint film. Structures smaller than<br>
the resolution of the human eye, contribute to "colour", whereas larger<br>
structures generally also contribute to "texture".<br>
Also particles which are not directly observable by themselves, can contribute to<br>
the overall visual appearance of a paint film. Des-orienters are an example of<br>
such particles. Effect pigments are generally flakes tending to take a horizontal<br>
orientation in a cured film. To prevent this, and to obtain more variation in flake<br>
orientation, spherical particles are used, referred to as des-orienters. Using des-<br>
orienters in a metallic paint, results in more glitter.<br>
Hitherto, the texture of the paint film to be repaired was judged by the eye, e.g.,<br>
by comparing it with samples on a sample fan. The results of such approach are<br>
strongly dependent on the skills of the practitioner and are often not satisfying.<br>
In practice, a colour specialist wanting to match a textured paint, first selects<br>
one or more effect modules or toners to obtain a matching texture effect.<br>
Meanwhile or subsequently, colourant modules or toners are selected to obtain<br>
a colour match. The result is compared with the original paint and iteratively<br>
adjusted if correction appears to be necessary. Selecting the right effect<br>
modules is difficult and requires a trial and error approach or accurate computer<br>
analysis of the effect pigments in the paint to be matched.<br>
EP-A 637 731 discloses a method for reproducing texture properties of a paint<br>
film. The reproduced paint is formulated on basis of concentrations of paint<br>
modules. The formulation is selected from a database or formulations with given<br>
texture properties. If this does not result in a satisfying match, corrections can<br>
be made by interpolation between two close matches.<br>
WO 01/25737 discloses a method of combined colour and texture matching,<br>
using a digital imaging device, such as a CCD camera, to determine the texture.<br><br>
A matching paint is determined by searching in a databank of colour<br>
formulations linked to texture data.<br>
US 2001/0036309 discloses a method of measuring micro-brilliance and using it<br>
for matching a repair paint with an original paint on, e.g., an automobile. The<br>
method includes measurement of colour as well as micro-brilliance, a specific<br>
type of texture. A colour formula with a matching micro-brilliance is selected<br>
from a databank of paint formulas. Consequently, the obtained micro-brilliance<br>
texture is acceptably matching. However, the colour is not necessarily matching<br>
evenly well. Hence, the colour formula needs to be iteratively adjusted until the<br>
colour match is also acceptable. In this prior art system, colour formulas that<br>
initially do not have the right texture are not taken into consideration, although<br>
these formulas could still be viable candidates as a formulation to start with.<br>
Furthermore, this prior art method does not assure that the texture remains<br>
intact during the adjustments of the colour formulas,<br>
The object of the invention is to improve matching of repair paints with paint<br>
originally applied on a substrate to give more accurate results in a faster and<br>
more reliable way, preferably without the need to build up a database of<br>
complete formulations with specified texture data.<br>
The object of the invention is achieved by a method for matching a repair paint<br>
to texture properties of a paint film on a substrate to be repaired, the repair paint<br>
being formulated on basis of concentrations of paint modules characterized in<br>
that each paint module is associated to specified texture data, and in that a<br>
calculational texture model using the texture date of the paint modules to<br>
calculate a repair paint with matching texture properties.<br>
These texture data can for instance include the particle size distribution of the<br>
effect pigments in the toner, and the optical contrast, defined as the difference<br>
in lightness, between the effect pigment and the other toner pigments present in<br>
the toner.<br><br>
Surprisingly it was found that a matching texture can be obtained by mixing<br>
toners selected from a limited range of toners showing particular pre-<br>
determined texture parameters, and that a computer can be used to calculate a<br>
matching mixture of texture toners.<br>
Preferably, the paint is also matched with the colour properties of the original<br>
paint. It has unexpectedly been found that by simultaneously matching colour<br>
and texture, the overall visual match appears to be improved, even if the colour<br>
match per se is a bit less.<br>
An alternative embodiment of the present invention, involves using a database<br>
of colour formulations, from which a best match is selected which subsequently<br>
further optimized using the calculation texture model by adapting the toner<br>
concentrations to obtain a closer texture match or combined colour and texture<br>
match. The adaptations can be small or can require removal of one or more<br>
toners or adding one or more new toners to the selected formulation.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for repairing a paint film on a substrate<br>
and to a method for matching of a repair paint to texture properties of a paint<br>
film on a substrate to be repaired using paint modules with specified texture<br>
data, which are used to calculate a combination of paint modules matching the<br>
required texture properties, mixing the modules as calculated and applying the<br>
resulting paint on the substrate to be refinished. This embodiment enables<br>
automated selection of effect toners, which was not possible hitherto. As a<br>
result, no inherently inaccurate visual assessment of a colour specialist is<br>
required.<br>
Texture can be imaged by means of a digital imaging device, such as a CCD<br>
camera. Subsequently, image analysis software can be used to translate the<br>
image into one or more texture parameters. Suitable image processing software<br>
is for instance Optimas or Image ProPlus, both commercially available from<br><br>
Media Cybernetics, MacScope, available from Mitani Corporation, or Matlab,<br>
available from The MathWorks Inc.<br>
Measuring texture<br>
In order to extract a texture parameter from a digital image, a set of<br>
representative car colours is collected and judged visually using a reference<br>
scale that covers the whole texture parameter range. An algorithm is derived<br>
that extracts texture parameter values from the images of the set of car colours<br>
that closely correlate to the visual assessments.<br>
The texture parameter "coarseness" describes the visual surface roughness of<br>
a sample: a coating shows coarseness when it exhibits a clear pattern of dark<br>
and light areas. Not only the ratio between dark and light areas, which for a<br>
black and white image can be expressed in a gray value standard deviation, is<br>
of importance, but also the size of the areas. For example, the drawings in<br>
Figure 1 have the same gray value standard deviation, but clearly differ in<br>
pattern.<br>
To extract coarseness, the following algorithm can be used:<br>
Take a CCD image of N x N pixels. The gray value standard deviation GVSTD<br>
is determined at several scales X: At the smallest scale X = 1 it is calculated per<br>
individual pixel. At the second smallest scale it is calculated over the average<br>
gray values of squares of 2 x 2 pixels (X = 4). At the third smallest scale<br>
squares of 4 x 4 pixels are used, so X = 16. This is repeated up to the maximum<br>
scale of N x N pixels (X = N2).<br>
The gray value standard deviation GVSTD can be described as a function of the<br>
scale X, using:<br><br><br>
With GVSTD and X being known, parameters A, B, and C can be calculated by<br>
fitting.<br>
The A, B and C parameters can be correlated to a visual coarseness value VC<br>
by:<br><br>
The values for the α1, α2, α3 and α4 have been pre-determined before by<br>
comparison with a set of panels of representative car colours. These reference<br>
colours are judged by the eye and accorded a value according to a reference<br>
scale. Judging is done by a number of people and the accorded values are<br>
averaged per panel. For each of these reference colours, the measured VC<br>
should be equal to the value according to the reference scale for visual<br>
judgment. The parameters α1, α2, α3 and α4 are found by minimizing the<br>
difference between observed and measured values for all used panels in the set<br>
of representative car colours. To find equal values for the α1, α2, α3 and α4<br>
parameters for all panels of the set of representative car colours, the square<br>
value of the difference between the reference scale value and the visual<br>
coarseness value VC is calculated for each panel. The sum of all these square<br>
values Σ all panels (visual judgment panel i - VC panel i)2 is subsequently minimized,<br>
resulting in values for α1, α2, α3 and α4. With these parameters being known,<br>
the coarseness of any car paint film can be determined.<br>
The aforementioned method to correlate the coarseness to visual assessments<br>
by using the theoretical model (2) can be done in general for any texture<br>
parameter for any observation and illumination condition for any particular<br>
model. This particular model can include any physical parameter (like particle<br><br>
size, flake composition, etc.), colour parameter (like CIE Lab parameters, etc.)<br>
or image parameters (like grey value standard deviation, etc.).<br>
An alternative way to measure texture, in particular so-called micro-brilliance,<br>
with a digital imaging device and image analysis software is disclosed in US<br>
2001/0036309, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The parameter 'glints' is another texture parameter, which describes the<br>
perception of bright tiny light spots on the surface of an effect coating under<br>
directional illumination conditions that switch on and off when you change the<br>
viewing angle. Glints is best observed in direct sun light, i.e. with a cloudless<br>
sky, from less than one meter. Even when the observation conditions are the<br>
same, some effect coatings show many bright glints, whereas other effect,<br>
coatings show few or even no glints at all. A glint scale has been designed with<br>
which an observer can visually inspect the effect coating, and express the|glints<br>
aspect as a number. Some effect coatings will have a small glints value, others<br>
a large glints value. In this way, the texture aspect "glint" of a coating can be<br>
observed in a quantitative way.<br>
The texture parameter "glint" can be described more specifically by making the<br>
distinction between glint intensity and glint size. Glint intensity is the light<br>
intensity or light intensity distribution of the bright tiny light spots. Glint size is<br>
the area or area distribution of the spots.<br>
A second way to make a further distinction between glints is by their colour or<br>
colour distribution.<br>
A glint is visible only in a given range of mutual orientations of illumination<br>
direction, observation direction and sample orientation. As a consequence, a<br>
third way to characterize glints is to determine the range of illumination angles<br>
(or the distribution thereof) for which a glint is visible to the human eye, given a<br>
certain observation angle and sample orientation. Similarly, the range of<br><br>
observation angles (or the distribution thereof) for which a glint is visible to the<br>
human eye can be used given a fixed illumination angle and sample orientation,<br>
or the range of sample orientations (or the distribution thereof) for which a glint<br>
is visible to the human eye, can be used given a fixed observation angle and a<br>
fixed illumination angle.<br>
Measuring colour<br>
Generally, texture matching will be combined with colour matching. To match a<br>
colour, the colour has to be measured first. Colours can be measured with the<br>
aid of colour meters, such as spectrophotometers or tri-stimulus meters. The<br>
measured signals can be used for the determination of a paint formula with a<br>
matching colour. US patent application US 2001/0036309 describes a method<br>
of measuring colour with the aid of a multi-angle spectrophotometer and using<br>
the measured data to search for a colour formula in a databank. US patent US<br>
4,813,000 discloses measuring a selected colour with the aid of a tri-stimulus<br>
colour analyser and using the measured chromaticity data to search for a colour<br>
formula in a databank. WO 01/25737 discloses how to measure colour with a<br>
digital imaging device such as a scanner or a digital camera.<br>
After measuring the texture properties, and optionally also the colour, a<br>
matching paint formulation is calculated. To this end, the texture, and optionally<br>
colour, of paint formulations is predicted.<br>
Predicting texture on basis of concentrations of paint modules<br>
A suitable repair paint is formulated as a mixture of a number of paint modules,<br>
e.g., toners, selected from a set of modules. Texture parameters of the modules<br>
have been predetermined. Based on these parameters, a mixture can be<br>
calculated showing a desired texture parameter. This way, a formulation for a<br>
repair paint can be calculated having a texture which closely matches the<br>
texture of the original paint film.<br><br>
The texture of a colour formula can be expressed in visual texture properties<br>
like coarseness, sparkling, glints, or micro-brilliance, but also in physical texture<br>
properties like particle size, particle size distribution, particle shape, particle<br>
colour, and the number of particles, a particle being, e.g., an effect pigment, or<br>
a couple of effect particles which cannot directly be distinguished visually or in<br>
the image, such as de-orienters.<br>
A texture parameter T of a single colour formula containing V toners each<br>
having a texture property c' can be written as:<br><br>
Ti is preferably a visual property, like coarseness, but could also be a physical<br>
texture property. For example, a coarseness model for a formulation of a<br>
number of v toners could be written as a function of Kubelka-Munk k and s<br>
values and the toner concentrations c, measured an optical geometry g and<br>
wavelength λ:<br><br>
In this example, the coarseness model uses the same parameters as the colour<br>
model (K and S values). This is not always necessary for texture models: a<br>
more generic example shows that Ti could be dependent on specific texture<br>
properties of the toners:<br><br>
where Aj is for example the particle area or area distribution of the specific;<br>
toners, and Bj is the particle shape (e.g. major axis length or circularity) of the<br>
specific toners. Ti can be a visual property like coarseness Tcoarseness, but can<br><br>
also be, e.g., the overall particle area or area distribution of the colour formula<br>
or the overall particle shape in the colour formula.<br>
The texture of a standard paint, e.g., the paint for a car to be repaired, can be<br>
expressed in a number texture parameters TiST. When the texture of this<br>
standard paint is to be matched, calculational methods such as for example the<br>
least squares method can be used to minimize the following expression by<br>
changing the toner concentrations:<br><br>
by using a non-linear optimization algorithm like the Marquardt-Levenberg<br>
algorithm (as described in Numerical Recipes in Pascal, W.H. Press, B.P.<br>
Flannery, S.A. Teukolsky, and W.T Vetterling. Cambridge University Press,<br>
1989). This means that for a single paint formula the toner concentrations are<br>
varied in such a way that the theoretical texture differences between the colour<br>
formula and a specified target colour is minimized (i.e. x2 from equation (6) is<br>
minimized).<br>
Coarseness<br>
The following is an example of a calculational model for predicting the<br>
coarseness of a paint film based on pre-determined coarseness data of paint<br>
modules used to formulate the paint. The following general function can be<br>
defined to predict the coarseness of a calculated colour formula as the sum of a<br>
number of predictors x, each with a weigh factor β:<br><br>
A possible predictor x is for instance the concentration of a toner used in the<br>
colour formulation. In Table 1 an example of a colour formula is given:<br><br><br>
Three possible predictors x are:<br>
CONCS = Concentration Solids: 0.17 + 0.20<br>
CONCM = Concentration Metallics: 0.30 + 0.05<br>
CONCP = Concentration Pearls: 0.05<br>
In this case, the predictors relate to toner types (solids, metallics, pearlescents,<br>
etc.). Alternatively, predictors can be used relating to individual toners, but this<br>
would generally result in a very large number of predictors. Another option is to<br>
use predictors relating to concentrations of solids with a low scattering<br>
coefficient (CONCSL), solids with a high scattering coefficient (CONCSH), fine<br>
metallics (CONCMF), medium metallics (CONCMM), coarse metallics<br>
(CONCMC), pearlescents with a low scattering coefficient (CONCPL),<br>
pearlescents with a high scattering coefficient (CONCPH), des-orienter<br>
(CONCQ), etc..<br>
It was found that scattering is a good indicator for coarseness. To avoid too<br>
many predictors, one can take the sum over the colourant concentrations times<br><br>
the colourant scattering coefficients averaged over the 16 wavelengths at 25°,<br>
45° and 110°. For the metallics in this case this would be for 25°:<br>
(8a) SUMMS1 = 0.30*AverageS25Q811E +0.05*AverageS25Q811U<br>
And for the other angles:<br>
SUMMS2 = 0.30*AverageS45Q811E +0.05*AverageS45Q811U<br>
SUMMS3 = 0.30*AverageS110Q811E +0.05*AverageS110Q811U<br>
Wherein "AverageS25Q811E" is the average value of the scattering coefficient<br>
over the 16 wavelengths at 25° for toner Q811E and "AverageS25Q811U" is the<br>
average value of the scattering coefficient over the 16 wavelengths at 25° for<br>
toner Q811U, weighed by their respective concentrations as shown in Table 1.<br>
The same can be done for the absorption coefficient. For the metallics in this<br>
case this would be for 25°:<br>
(8b) SUMMK1 = 0.30*AverageK25Q811 E+0.05*AverageK25Q811U<br>
The predictors SUMMS1, SUMMS2, SUMMS3, SUMMK1, SUMMK2, and<br>
SUMMK3 are used in equation (7).<br>
Additionally or alternatively, the L, a, b, Munsell chroma and Munsell hue values<br>
of the colour at the three angles can be used as predictor. Other predictors that<br>
can be thought of are ratio S to K and vice versa, splitting the wavelength<br>
domain into two (SUMMS1A and SUMMS1B) or four (SUMMS1A, SUMMS1B,<br>
SUMMS1C and SUMMS1D) parts instead of averaging over the whole range,<br>
and defining a sort of contrast predictor ([constant-{S/K}solid]/{S/K}solid). The<br><br>
number of possible combinations seems countless; however, many are highly<br>
correlated.<br>
Generally a number of 6 coarseness classes or categories are defined.<br>
Because these categories are used, a logistic regression is applied to predict<br>
the coarseness instead of a linear model, the latter would suggest a continuous<br>
scale. The function can be written as:<br><br>
with a being the boundaries between categories.<br>
The chance on a certain coarseness value can be calculated as follows:<br>
P(coarseness value = 1)=p(y≤y1)<br>
P(coarseness value = 2)= p(y≤y2)-p(y≤y1)<br>
P(coarseness value = 3)= p(y≤y3)-p(y≤y2)<br>
P(coarseness value = 4)= p(y≤y4)-p(y≤y3)<br>
P(coarseness value = 5)= p(y≤y5)-p(y≤y4)<br>
P(coarseness value = 6)= 1-p(y≤y5)<br>
Figure 2 shows an example of a chance distribution. As coarseness value either<br>
the median, mode or Σ i*P(i) with i=1 to 6 is taken.<br>
The values for the α's and β's are pre-determined by comparison with a set of<br>
panels of representative car colours. These reference colours are judged by the<br>
eye and accorded a value according to a reference scale. This is done by a<br>
number of people and the accorded values are averaged per panel. For each of<br>
these reference colours, the predicted coarseness value should be equal to the<br>
value according to the reference scale for visual judgment. The parameters are<br><br>
found by minimizing the difference between observed and measured values for<br>
all used panels in the set of representative car colours. With these parameters<br>
being known, the coarseness of any car paint film can be predicted.<br>
Glints<br>
A glints model has been designed in order to predict the glint number of an<br>
effect coating, based on only the concentrations of the various toners used in<br>
the paint. The model may be used when trying to match an original colour, e.g.,<br>
of a car to be refinished. In that case, the model can make sure that also the<br>
glint aspect of the original car colour is matched.<br>
In order to make these predictions, the glint model requires a number of input<br>
parameters:<br>
the illumination and observation angles. This means the angle from<br>
which the light source (for example, the sun) is shining on the coating,<br>
and the angle at which the observer is looking to it. Also the distance<br>
from which the light source is shining, and the distance between<br>
observer and coating are relevant. The intensity of the light source is also<br>
needed. And finally, the angular scope of detector/observer's eye and<br>
light source, as seen from the coating.<br>
Sizes and thicknesses and number of flake particles inside effect toners.<br>
The orientations in which the flakes for each toner are lying in a coating<br>
The absorption and scattering (K&amp;S) values of the non-effect toners, and<br>
the refractive index of the non-effect toners. These are used to calculate<br>
how the coating absorbs light.<br>
First the colour and intensity of the background, i.e. the coating surrounding<br>
glints, are calculated. This is important, because the human eye can detect a<br>
tiny light source like a glint better when it has a dark surrounding than when it<br>
has a lighter surrounding. The background colour is calculated based on the<br>
absorption and scattering (K&amp;S) values of the non-effect toners, under the<br><br>
assumption that all light falling on an effect coating is either absorbed or<br>
reflected by a flake at some depth in the coating. The various contributions from<br>
flakes at several depths in the coating are all taken into account.<br>
After calculating the background colour and intensity, it is calculated how<br>
intense a glint should be, in order to make it visible for the human eye, against<br>
the calculated background. The calculation is done as described in the article of<br>
hardy, J. Opt. Soc. Am 57 (1967) 44 - 47. Next, it is calculated how many flakes<br>
under one square centimeter of coating surface have the right orientation and<br>
depth in the coating, such that the light reflected from them is intense enough to<br>
be visible against the background. This number is called N and is found by<br>
multiplying four terms. The first term accounts for the fact that glints are more<br>
easily recognizable against a darker background, and deals with light<br>
absorption by solid pigments. The second term accounts for the dependence on<br>
viewing/illumination angle. The third term accounts for the concentration of<br>
flakes in the coating, and the fourth term calculates the fraction of flakes that<br>
have the correct orientation in order to make them visible as glint.<br>
Now using the psychologically based Weber law that human perception is often<br>
based on the logarithm of stimulus, the logarithm of N is correlated with the<br>
visually observed glint scale numbers. The Weber law is described in M. W.<br>
Levine, Fundamentals of Sensation and Perception, 3 ed., Oxford University<br>
Press, New York, 2000. Now using the psychologically based Weber law that<br>
human perception is often based on the logarithm of stimulus, the logarithm of<br>
N is correlated with the visually observed glint scale numbers.<br>
Matching colour on basis of concentrations of paint modules<br>
Colour formulas can be determined in a number of ways, i.e. by means of<br>
search procedures, calculations, or combinations of the two. For example, use<br>
may be made of a databank comprising colour formulas having colorimetric<br>
data linked thereto. Using the calculated colorimetric data of the measured<br><br>
selected colour, the most closely matching colour formula can be found.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to use a databank having colour formulas with<br>
spectral data linked thereto. Known calculation methods can be used to<br>
calculate the colorimetric data of the colour formulas and compare them. Also, a<br>
databank can be used in which the absorption and reflection data, the so-called<br>
K and S data, of pigments are stored. Using K and S data in combination with<br>
pigment concentrations makes it possible to calculate the colour formula of<br>
which the colorimetric data most closely match the colorimetric data of the<br>
measured selected colour. The methods in question have been described in<br>
detail in D.B. Judd et al., Colour in Business, Science and Industry. It is possible<br>
to combine the aforesaid search and calculation methods.<br>
Colour can be expressed by the paint film reflection as a function of wavelength<br>
of visible light. Alternatively, colour can be expressed in accordance with the so-<br>
called CIE Lab system, as defined by the Commission International d'Eclairage,<br>
or similar systems, such as the CIE Luv, CIE XYZ systems or the Munsell<br>
system. In paint films comprising effect pigments, the measured reflection R is<br>
dependent on the optical geometry, which is defined by the angle of observation<br>
and the angle of illumination. The theoretical reflection R9Λ at a wavelength λ<br>
and at optical geometry g of a colour formulation composed by a number of v<br>
toners, can be written as a function of the colorimetric parameters c of each<br>
toner:<br><br>
Alternatively, the L,a,b values of a paint formula can be written in a similar way.<br>
This colour formula contains V toners, g measuring geometries, and λ<br>
wavelengths per geometry. Generally, g =1 in case of solid colours without<br>
effect pigments, and λ = 16 when the wavelength range is between 400 and<br>
700nm and the wavelength interval is 20 nm. For paints comprising effect<br>
pigments, g is usually about 3.<br><br>
In accordance with the Kubelka Munk model (the hiding version) the reflection<br>
RKM is defined by the following formula:<br><br>
in which KigΛ is the absorption factor at wavelength A and optical geometry g of<br>
toner i and Sigλ is the scattering factor at wavelength A and optical geometry g of<br>
toner i. Hence, a similar formula as equation (4) is obtained:<br><br>
In order to match a standard colour (e.g. the colour of the car to be repaired)<br>
expressed in reflection values RSTgλ, for example the least squares method can<br>
be used to minimize the following expression:<br><br>
by using a non-linear optimization algorithm like the Marquardt-Levenberg<br>
algorithm. This means that for a single colour formula the toner concentrations<br>
are varied in such a way that the theoretical colour difference between the<br>
colour formula and a specified target colour is minimized (i.e. X2 from equation<br>
(13) is minimized). The concentrations ci of V different toners in one colour<br>
formula are estimated by fitting the ci parameters in the following equation using<br>
fixed K and S values for each toner:<br><br><br>
This way of representing colour formulation also incorporates the cases for<br>
which toners are omitted from or added to a colour formula: this can be<br>
achieved by setting the accompanied toner concentrations to zero, or removing<br>
the parameter respectively.<br>
Combined colour and texture matching<br>
The preferred way to cope with texture parameters is to match a paint based on<br>
colour and texture simultaneously. To this end, a combined colour and texture<br>
model "RT" has to be defined. This can for example be done by combining<br>
equations 6 and 13, i.e. by adding them up and defining a weigh factor α,<br>
ranging between 0 and 1:<br><br>
Equation (15) is minimized by using a non-linear optimization algorithm like the<br>
Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm. The fit parameters are the toner<br>
concentrations, and the fixed parameters are the K and S values from the<br>
colour model and the texture parameters from the texture model.<br>
The weigh factor a can be used to set the priority between colour and texture. If<br>
the colour match is given more priority than the texture match, then a is less<br>
than 0,5, while if the texture match is given more priority, then α is more than<br>
0,5. The higher the value of α, the more important the role of texture. The factor<br>
α can be kept constant for all colour formulas, but can also be varied for each<br>
separate colour formula.<br>
An alternative way to deal with texture is using texture as a constraint during a<br>
more or less standard colour formulation. This means that equation (13) is<br><br>
solved instead of equation (15), but during the estimation the toner<br>
concentrations are not allowed to vary in such a way that the texture parameter<br>
differences exceed predetermined upper and lower limits.<br>
Figure 3 shows a schematic example how to use equation (15), dividing X2 in a<br>
colour part and a texture part:<br><br>
Figure 3 shows graphically the function of equation 16 for a specific colour<br>
formula. When the formula is matched on colour only (α=0) then X2Colour (dark<br>
blue line) is in this particular case lower than the colour acceptance threshold<br>
(pink line) which means that the colour is visually acceptable according to the<br>
average colour specialist. However, X2texture (yellow line) is quite large and in<br>
this particular case larger than the texture threshold (cyan line), which means<br>
that the texture is visually not acceptable for the average colour specialist.;<br>
When, on the other hand, a match is based on texture only (α=1) then the<br>
colour is not acceptable while the texture is acceptable. To obtain a satisfactory<br>
match, both X2colour and X2texture must be lower than the corresponding<br>
thresholds. This is achieved in this particular example when 0.2 ≤ α ≤ 0.6.<br>
It is emphasized that this is just an example. There will always be colour<br>
formulas for which either the colour and / or texture will or cannot become :lower<br>
than their visual thresholds. This is for example the case when the toners have<br>
not been selected correctly.<br>
There are different ways to deal with the weighing factor a. One way is to set a<br>
to a fixed value that on average enables the best combined colour and texture<br>
match. A more preferred way is to determine an optimum value a specifically for<br>
each separate colour formula.<br>
The invention is further explained by the following example.<br><br>
Example<br>
A dark gray effect coating ("standard") was measured at three angles (25°, 45°<br>
and 110°) with a ColourChecker. Table 2 shows the measurement results.<br><br>
As texture property the coarseness was measured and indexed at 0.91.<br>
An effort was made to match on colour only ("colour") and on colour and texture<br>
("coltex"). For both calculations the same set of colourants was used. Recipes<br>
were sprayed out and samples measurements. Recipes are given in Tables 3,<br>
colour measurements results in Tables 4 and 5. For "colour" the coarseness<br>
value was 2.24 and for "coltex" 1.23, coarseness differences with the standard<br>
are given in Table 6.<br><br><br><br>
Using the weight averaged ΔEcmc (WADE), "colour" scores 0.46 and "coltex"<br>
0.68. This example shows the added value of texture matching: the texture of<br>
"coltex" matches the texture of "standard", is a bit more off in colour than<br>
"colour", but satisfies the requirement WADE
