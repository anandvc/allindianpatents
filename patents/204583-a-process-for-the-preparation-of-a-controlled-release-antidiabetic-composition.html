COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10)<br>
A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A CONTROLLED RELEASE ANTIDIABETIC COMPOSITION<br>
SUN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
A company incorporated under the laws of India having their office at ACME PLAZA, ANDHERI-KURLA ROAD, ANDHERI (E), MUMBAI-400059, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
The foUowing speciHcation particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A CONTROLLED RELEASE ANTIDIABETIC COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a controlled release antidiabetic composition comprising a biguanide such as metformin or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent of the biguanide class used in the treatment of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Metformin hydrochloride is highly soluble in water and has intrinsically poor permeability in the lower portion of the gasfrointestinal tract and an elimination half-life of 2-6 hours.<br>
The usual starting dose of metformin is 500 mg twice a day or 850 mg once a day given with meals with maximum of 2550 mg per day. Such conventional multiple dose therapy may lead to substantial fluctuation in the plasma concentration of the drug, especially in chronic administration. A controlled drug dehvery system allows the drug to be released in a rate-controlled manner leading to a constant therapy and thereby eliminating the multiple dosing and side effects.<br>
The prior art enumerates several attempts to prepare a controlled release metformin composition. United States Patent Number 5,955,106 (hereinafter referred to as '106 patent) disclosed a pharmaceutical composition comprising metformin and a hydrocolloid forming retarding agent with the residual moisture content of about 0.5-3%. The said moisture level was maintained such that usual capping problem associated with the high-dose tablet formulations is avoided. The hydrocolloid forming retarding agents used in this invention, were selected from a group of cellulose derivatives, dextrins, starches, carbohydrate polymers, natural gums, xanthane, alginates, gelatin, polyacrylic acid, poljrvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl pyrollidones. The matrix tablets so formed could optionally be film coated with polymers such as soluble cellulose<br><br>
derivatives, ethyl cellulose, poly(ethacrylate-methyl methacrylate) dispersion and plasticizers such as diethyl phthalate and macrogol to mask the taste or to additionally retard the release. Metformin has a comparatively large dose and thus the dosage form tends to becoine bulky and difficult to swallow. This coupled with the problem of poor compressibility of metformin reduces the flexibility in formulating the composition to obtain the optimum release profile. We have found a composition comprising metformin or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, two or more swellable polymers wherein at least one polymer is anionic, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s) that improve the compressibility of thg core composition and optionally a coat comprising one or more water insoluble polymer(s) surrounding the core wherein the composition enables the poor compressibility of metformin to be brought under control and allows convenient modulation of release_jA^.ithout necessarily requiring moisture control in the; range of 0.5-3%.<br>
PCT ^plication Number WO 9947128 disclosed a pharmaceutical composition wherein particles of an inner phase comprising a highly water soluble active ingredient and an extended release material are dispersed in an outer solid continuous phase comprising an extended release material, hi the system of the present invention however, the inner phase is in the form of a core, which is surrounded by a water insoluble polymeric coat. The system of WO 9947128 consists of a matrix of an inner phase in an outer phase and would be considered as a "matrix-system" by those skilled in the art. The system of the present invention has two distinct components viz. a core and a coat such systems are regarded as reservoir type systems and provide a distinctly different kinetics and mechanisms of release, alternately, the present invention has optionally no coat, thus is a single phase matrix system without coat and is thus different.<br>
United States Patent Number 6,099,859 disclosed an osmotic controlled release tablet composition. Osmotic controlled release system differs fi:om the present invention in that the release of a drug occurs through an orifice in the semipermeable membrane coating and the osmotic pressure within the system exercises control on the release.<br><br>
The prior art does not disclose a process for the preparation of a controlled release antidiabetic composition comprising mixing a compressible controlled release core composition comprising metformin or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, two or more swellable polymers wherein at least one polymer is an anionic polymer, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s) that improve the compressibility of the core composition and converting the mixture into a core and optionally surrounding the core with a coat comprising one or more water insoluble polymer(s).<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of a controlled release antidiabetic composition comprising metformin or its pharmaceutical acceptable salt in a readily compressible and controlled release form.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of a controlled release antidiabetic composition comprising metformin or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
In the preferred embodiments of the process of the present invention the amount of metformin hydrochloride ranges from about 500 mg to about 1000 mg.<br>
The swellable polymeric materials used in the present invention are hydrogels that swell in, and retain a significant amoimt of water. These swellable polymers are polymeric hydrogels (crosslinked or vmcrosslinked), which swell or expand significantly in water, usually exhibiting a 2 to 50 fold or greater volume increase. The crosslinked polymers will swell and will not dissolve; uncrosslinked polymers may dissolve subsequent to swelling although dissolution is not a necessary consequence.<br>
Examples of the swellable polymers that can be used in the present invention include:<br>
•	cellulose and cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose (MC), ethylcellulose (EC), hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropyl ethylcellulose (HPEC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), crosslinked carboxymethyl cellulose (croscarmellose) and its alkah salts, ethylhydroxyethylcellulose (EHEC), hydroxyethyl methylcellulose (HEMC), hydrophobically modified hydroxyethyl cellulose (HMHEC), hydrophobically modified ethylhydroxyethylcellulose (HMEHEC), carboxymethyl hydroxyethylcellulose (CMHEC), carboxymethyl hydrophobically modified hydroxyethyl cellulose (CMHMHEC) and the like;<br>
•	alkylene oxide homopolymers such as polypropylene oxide, preferably ethylene oxide homopolymers and the like;<br>
•	disintegrant such as cross-linked pol)^inylpyrrolidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose, carboxymethyl starch, sodium carboxymethyl starch, potassium<br><br>
methacrylate-divinylbenzene copolymer, polyvinyl alcohols, amylose, cross-linked amylose, pregelatinized starch, starch and starch derivatives. • gums of plant, animal, mineral or synthetic origin such as (i) agar, alginates, carrageenan, furcellaran derived fi^om marine plants, (ii) guar gum, gum arable, gum tragacanth, karaya gum, locust bean gum, pectin derived from terrestrial plants, (iii) microbial polysaccharides such as dextran, gellan gum, rhamsan gum, welan gum, (iv) synthetic or semi-synthetic gums such as hydroxypropyl guar and the like;<br>
It is also possible to use vinyl pyrrolidone polymers or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), also referred to as Povidone as the swellable poljmiers. These are the synthetic polymers consisting essentially of linear l-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone groups, the degree of polymerization of which results in polymers of various molecular weights, the molecular weight ranging between 2500 and 3,000,000 Daltons. PVP is commercially available as KoUidon® (BASF), Plasdone® and Peristone® (General Aniline). PVP is classified into different grades on the basis of its viscosity in aqueous solution. Different grades of PVP available are PVP K-12, PVP K-15, PVP K-17, PVP K-25, PVP K-30, PVP K-60, PVP K-90 and PVP K-120. The K-value referred to in the above nomenclature is calculated from the viscosity of the PVP in aqueous solution, relative to that of water. The preferred vinyl pyrrolidone polymer used as a swellable polymer is PVP K-30, having an approximate molecular weight of 50000 Daltons.<br>
The anionic swellable polymers used in the present invention are selected from the group consisting of homo-polymers and copolymers of polyacrylic acid and polyacrylic acid derivatives, various starch derivatives, cellulose derivatives, gums and the like.<br>
Homopolymers of polyacrylic acid and its derivatives that can be used in the present invention, include, but are not limited to, various grades sold under the frade name of Carbopol® by BFGoodrich. These are high molecular weight, crosslinked, acrylic acid-based polymers. Carbopol homopolymers are polymers of acrylic acid crosslinked with allyl sucrose or allylpentaerythritol. Carbopol copolymers are polymers of acrylic acid, modified by long chain<br><br>
(C10-C30) alkyl acrylates and crosslinked with allylpentaerythritol. The USP-NF, British Pharmacopoeia have adopted the generic name "Carbomer" for various Carbopol® Homopolymer polymers. The Japanese Pharmaceutical Excipients list carbopol homopolymers as "carboxyvinyl polymer" and "carboxy polymethylene". A range of different pharmaceutical grade polymers, each with special properties and applications depending upon the viscosity of the polymers and the apphcabihty are available. The Carbopol grades 934 NF, 2984, 5984 EP, for example can be used for stable emulsions and suspensions for water and solvent-based gels having viscosity ranging from 30,500 to 45,000 cps for 0.5% solution at pH 7.5. Carbopol 934P NF, 974P NF having viscosity ranging from 29,400 to 39,400 cps can be used especially for oral and mucoadhesive applications such as controlled release tablets and oral suspensions. The grades 940 NF, 980 NF having viscosity ranging from 40,000 to 65,000 cps are to be used for topical gels. The low viscosity grades of Carbopol namely, 941NF, 981 NF can be used for low viscosity sparkhng clear topical gels. The carbopol 934P is high purity grade of Carbopol 934. Depending on drug solubility, drug hydrophilicity and basic sfrength, polymer concenfration and test medium pH, Carbopol 934 P can show zero-order release profiles in tableting applications.<br>
It is also possible to use in the present invention, co-polymers of acrylate or methacrylate monomers, for example polymethacrylates marketed under the brand names of Eudragit as the anionic swellable polymers. Eudragit L and S also referred as methacrylic acid copolymers are the copolymerization products of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate. The ratio of free carboxy groups to the ester is approximately 1:1 in Eudragit L and approximately 1:2 in Eudragit S. Eudragit® RS and RL, also referred to as ammoniomethacrylate copolymers are copolymers synthesized from acrylic acid and methacrylic acid esters with Eudragit® RL type having 10% of functional quaternary ammonium groups and Eudragit® RS having 5% of fiinetional quaternary ammonium groups.<br>
Examples of starch derivatives that can be used as the anionic polymers include, but are not limited to, sodium starch glycolate and various other anionic starch derivatives and the like.<br><br>
Examples of other anionic polymers tJtiat can be used as tne swellable polymers in the present invention, include, but are not limited to gums such as sodium alginate, sold under the name of KELTONE , propylene glycol alginate and the like. Particularly, the preferred *anionic polymer used in the present invention is xanthan gum, which is a high molecular weight polysaccharide, available in various grades, viscosity ranges and of different particle sizes. The xanthan gum used in the present invention is the food fine (FF) grade, 200 mesh, supplied by Jungbunzlauer.<br>
Examples of anionic cellulose derivatives that can be used as the swellable polymers in the present invention, include, but are not limited to sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, potassium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, cross linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose known as crosscarmellose, sold under the name of Ac-Di-SOL®, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate and the like.<br>
Particularly, the preferred swellable polymers used in the present invention are the cellulose<br>
ethers. Cellulose ethers are nonionic polymers however some cellulose ethers may be anionic for<br>
example cellulose ethers with some hydroxyl groups esterified for example hydroxypropyl<br>
methyl cellulose phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate or cellulose ethers with the hydroxyl group<br>
further reacted to incorporate an anionic functional group for example carboxymethyl cellulose<br>
calcium and the like. The examples of the cellulose ethers include methylcellulose (MC),<br>
ethylcellulose (EC), hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC),<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropyl ethylcellulose (HPEC), carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose (CMC), crosslinked carboxymethyl cellulose (croscarmellose) and its alkaU salts,<br>

modified	hydroxyethyl	cellulose	(HMHEC),	hydrophobically	modified<br>
ethylhydroxyethylcellulose (HMEHEC), carboxymethyl hydroxyethylcellulose (CMHEC), and the like.<br>
More preferably, the swellable polymers used in the present invention include various grades of the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose available under the brand Name of Methocel. The grades<br><br>
available are categorized depending upon the chemical substitution and hydration rates. The Methocel Grade K, for example is used for HPMC having % methoxy content of 19-24 % and hydroxypropyl content of 7-12 % with a fastest relative rate of hydration. Similarly, the Methocel E grade is used for 28-30 % methoxy content and 7-12 % of hydroxypropyl with a more faster relative hydration rate as compared to the K grade. The F grade of Methocel indicates a 27-30 % methoxy content and 4-7.5 % of hydroxypropyl content with a slow relative hydration rate. The Methocel Grade A indicates a 27.5-31.5 % methoxy content and 0 % hydroxypropyl with slowest rate of hydration.<br>
HPMC is further categorized based on the particle size. For example, the premium grades of Methocel have particle size in the range such that 100% particles are less than 30 mesh screen and 99% of the particles are less than 40 mesh screen. The E grade has particle size in the range such that 95%) particles are less than 100 mesh screen whereas the K series has 90 % of particles less than 100 mesh screen.<br>
HPMC is further categorized according to viscosity exhibited by the 2%) HPMC solution in water. The Methocel grades based on the viscosities are KIOOLVP, K4M, K15MP, KIOOMP and E4MP. The KIOOLVP indicates a minimal viscosity of lOOcps, K4M of 4000 cps, K15MP of 15,000 and KIOOMP of 100,000 and several low viscosity grades such as E3, E5, E6, E15, E50andK3.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the swellable polymer, which is a high viscosity grade cellulose derivative, preferably hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, commercially available as Methocel KIOOM, with a viscosity of a 2 % w/w aqueous solution ranging from 80,000 to about 120,000 cps is used. In a particularly preferred embodiment the swellable polymer is a mixture of high viscosity grade of HPMC having a viscosity greater than about 10,000 cps and a low viscosity grade HPMC having a viscosity equal to or less than about 10,000 cps. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, one of the grades of the HPMC used has viscosity of about 4000 cps and is commercially available as Methocel K4M, and the other<br><br>
grade of HPMC used has a viscosity of about 100,000 cps, and is commercially available as MethocelKlOOM.<br>

hi the particularly preferred embodiments of the present invention, a combination of a high molecular weight HPMC and Carbopol 934P is used. HPMC may be used in the concenfration ranging from about 10 to 15 % w/w of the total weight of the tablet. Amounts of Carbopol 934P that can be used in preferred embodiments of the present invention may vary from about 5 to about 20 % w/w of the total weight of the tablet.<br>
hi the still fiirther preferred embodiments of the present invention, a combination of high molecular weight HPMC and Xanthan gum Type FF is used. HPMC may be used in the concentration ranging from about 10 to 20 % w/w of the total weight of the tablet. More preferably, the HPMC used is a mixture of high viscosity grade of HPMC having a viscosity greater than about 10,000 cps and a low viscosity grade HPMC having a viscosity equal to or less than about 10,000 cps.

The controlled release antidiabetic composition of the present invention contains one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s) that improve the compressibility of the core composition. These excipient(s) allow a wider range of moisture than the range of 0.5 to 3 % w/w to be retained in the core while enabling the poor compressibihty of metformin to be brought under control. The inventors do not subscribe to any theory but perhaps these excipient(s) by their wicking or dessicant action for retaining moisture or by their compressibility characteristics enable the compressibility to be brought under control. Thus excipient(s) that further modulate the release of metformin from the core can be included in the composition and provide flexibility to the formulation in obtaining the desired release profile.<br>
Examples of the excipient(s) that improve the compressibility of the core composition include microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, dextrins and dextrans, colloidal silicon dioxide, kaolin, titanium dioxide, fused silicon dioxide, alumina, bentonite, magnesium silicate, magnesium trisilicate, anhydrous calcium sulfate, magnesium aluminium silicate and the like.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the excipient used to improve the compressibility of the core composition is microcystalline cellulose.<br>
In the process for the preparation of a controlled release antidiabetic composition of the present invention, the core composition may optionally contain the excipient(s) that further modulate the rate of release of metformin from the core. These excipient(s) are selected from the group consisting of osmotic agents, inorganic or organic weak acids or weak bases and surfactants.<br>
Examples of the osmogent(s) used in the present invention include all pharmaceutically acceptable and pharmacologically inert water-soluble compounds referred to in the pharmacopoeias such as United States Pharmacopoeia, as well as in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy; edition 19; Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania (1995). Pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble salts of inorganic or organic acids, or non-ionic<br><br>
organic compounds with high water solubility, e.g. carbohydrates such as sugar, or amino acids, are generally preferred. The examples of agents used for inducing osmosis include inorganic salts such as magnesium chloride or magnesium sulfate, lithium, sodium or potassium chloride, lithium, sodium or potassium hydrogen phosphate, lithium, sodium or potassium dihydrogen phosphate, salts of organic acids such as sodium or potassium acetate, magnesiimi succinate, sodium benzoate, sodium citrate or sodium ascorbate; sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate; carbohydrates such as mannitol, sorbitol, arabinose, ribose, xylose, glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, raffinose, inositol, xylitol, maltitol; water-soluble amino acids such as glycine, leucine, alanine, or methionine; urea and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of inorganic or organic weak acids or weak bases used in the present invention include, but are not limited to citric acid, lactic acid, ascorbic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid and salts thereof<br>
Examples of the surfactants used in the present invention include, but are not limited to glyceride; partial glycerides, glyceride derivatives, polyhydric alcohol esters, PEG and PPG esters, polyoxyethylene and polypropylene sorbitan esters; sodium lauryl sulfate and the like.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the composition of the present invention include sodium chloride as the osmogent and sodium bicarbonate as the weak base.<br>
The additional excipient(s) used in the controlled release antidiabetic composition of the present invention include those excipient(s) which are generally used during the preparation of granules, compression e.g lubricants, glidants, disintegrants and the like. These excipients are discussed in 'Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18* edition, page 1635-38(1990).<br>
In the process for the preparation of a controlled release antidiabetic composition of the present invention, the core composition may optionally be surrounded with a coat comprising one or more water insoluble polymer(s). Examples of water insoluble polymers that may be used<br><br>
include cellulose ether derivatives, acrylic resins, copolymers of acryhc acid and methacryhc acid esters. Combined with the polymer material may be a hydrophobic agent, which may be a fatty acid of 10 or more carbon atoms, wax or the salts of a fatty acid or 10 or more carbon atoms such as magnesium stearate or calcium stearate. The particular hydrophobic agent may be a mixture of stearates which contain other fatty acids because the product is derived from a natural source. The purpose of the hydrophobic agent is to reduce the permeability of the water insoluble, water permeable polymer to water by adding from 25% to 50% by weight of the hydrophobic agent to said polymer based on the total combined weight of the hydrophobic agent and said polymer. Small amounts of stearates will reduce tackiness and very large amounts will reduce water permeabiUty.<br>
In the most preferred embodiments of the present invention, the water insoluble polymeric material used to coat the core is a highly water permeable, pH independent methacrylic-methacrylate polymer with quaternary ammonium groups.<br>
Plasticizers may be added to the water insoluble polymer to control any brittleness in the polymeric coat. The plasticizer used in the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of diethyl phthalate, diethyl sebacate, triethyl cifrate, diethyl phthalate, glycerol, sorbitol, crotonic acid, propylene glycol, castor oil, citric acid esters, dibutyl phthalate, dibutyl sebacate, and mixtures thereof<br>
The amount of the coating apphed on the core may vary from about 0.5 to about 20 % w/w of the total weight of the dosage form, depending on the core composition. In the preferred embodiments the amount of coating applied is from about 3% to about 5% by weight of the total weight of the dosage form.<br>
According to the process of the present invention, metformin or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, two or more swellable polymers wherein at least one polymer is an anionic polymer, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s) that improve the compressibility of the core<br><br>
composition and optionally excipient(s) that modulate the release of metformin from the core are mixed and the mixture is converted into a core by conventional means. These include wet granulation, dry granulation, direct compression, pelletization, extrusion-spheronization, layering onto inert particles such as non-pareil seeds, and the hke. The core other than the one whic|j,is already in the tablet form is further modified into a tablet by compression in a tablet press. The tablets may be single layered or compressed into multilayered tablets such as bilayered tablets. In the case of dry granulation, the dry mixture of metformin or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, swellable polymer(s), optionally excipient(s) that modulate the release of metformin from the core and the excipients that improve the compressibility of the core composition is compressed to obtain slugs, which are then passed through suitable sieves to obtain granules. In wet granulation, the mixture is granulated with a liquid preferably, a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and water. The dried granules are compressed on a tablet compression machine. In case of direct compression, the components of the system are mixed thoroughly and directly compressed on a tablet compression machine.<br>
The compressed cores in tablet form, obtained by any one of the above methods, may optionally be subjected to coating, moulding, spraying, or immersion using a coating solution comprising one or more water insoluble polymer(s) to form the water insoluble polymeric coat. The water insoluble polymer(s) and other adjuvants such as plasticizers, opacifiers, pigments and the like are dissolved or dispersed in a suitable organic or aqueous solvent to form the coating solution. The examples that follow do not limit the scope of the invention and are presented as illustrations.<br>
