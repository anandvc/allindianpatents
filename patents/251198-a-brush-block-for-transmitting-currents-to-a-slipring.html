				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
Brush Block for Transmitting Currents<br>
The present invention pertains to a brush block for transmitting currents with the features described<br>
in the preamble of the principal claim.<br>
Devices for transmitting currents to a slip ring by means of a maximum of two sliding contacts have<br>
been known so far, which are suitable for transmitting signal currents with a current intensity in the<br>
mA range. These devices cannot transmit higher current intensities.<br>
Since only a maximum of two sliding contacts are used to transmit the current, these devices imply<br>
a risk of failure, because the functionality of the entire device depends on a maximum of two<br>
individual elements subject to wear.<br>
The sliding contacts, if they consist of multiwire slip rings, have hitherto been brought into contact<br>
with the slip ring mostly approximately vertically, which causes intense felting of the multiwire slip<br>
rings, a relatively large contact area and thus a high contact resistance.<br>
The object of the present invention is to show an improved device for transmitting currents.<br><br>
This object is accomplished according to the features in the principal claim.<br>
The device being claimed for transmitting currents comprises essentially at least one brush block,<br>
which is connected with a plurality of multiwire sliding elements (MWSE). wherein these MWSE<br>
can be brought tangentially into contact with a slip ring. The use of such a plurality of MWSE has<br>
the advantage that the current to be transmitted is distributed among a plurality of contacts<br>
connected in parallel. As a result, the current power to be transmitted per MWSE is greatly<br>
reduced, as a consequence of which wear due to heating is greatly reduced and it is. above all.<br>
possible to also transmit power currents with current intensities of 40 A or higher. Furthermore,<br>
sufficient contact is still present even in case of wear-related loss of contact of individual MWSE to<br>
guarantee sufficient transmission of the current. As a result, the service life of the device is<br>
prolonged and the risk of failure is reduced.<br>
The individual brush block preferably comprises an MWSE carrier in conjunction with a plurality<br>
of MWSE. The MWSH carrier preferably has a plurality of regularly arranged stepped incisions on<br>
the inner side that points toward the slip ring and is essentially concentric with the slip ring. These<br>
stepped incisions are shaped such that one or more MWSE can be arranged on each of the sides of<br>
the step directed approximately tangentially to the slip ring. At right angles to the direction of<br>
rotation of the slip ring, a plurality of MWSE are arranged either directly adjoining one another<br>
| "aneinander schliessend" in German original is a probable typo for "aneinander anschliessend" -<br>
Tr.Ed. | or at slightly spaced locations next to one another on a step, and form an MWSE layer with<br><br>
The MWSE layers of two or more adjacent stepped incisions overlap one another in the form of<br>
scales. The MWSH thus arranged preferably describe with their free ends an enveloping curve, i.e..<br>
they approach a circular path, whose radius is somewhat smaller than the radius of the slip ring to<br>
be brought into contact. It is achieved as a result that the MWSE with the multiwire sliding rings<br>
can be brought into contact with the slip ring essentially tangentially and elastically and that the<br>
packing density of the sliding contacts is very high.<br>
Furthermore, the MWSH are preferably arranged in the stepped incisions in such a structured form<br>
that the individual layers are each offset in relation to one another. The offset of the layers is such<br>
that the multiwire slip rings of one MWSE layer are arranged staggered in relation to the next<br>
MWSH layer. Two or more different layers of arrangement can now be formed.<br>
The multiwire slip rings of two or more congruent, i.e., non-adjacent MWSE layers form a sliding<br>
track on the circumference of the slip ring. The MWSE layers are arranged at right angles to the<br>
direction of rotation of the slip ring, preferably such among one another that the sliding tracks of the<br>
respective offset MWSH layers adjoin each other as closely as possible and together form a broad<br>
overall track.<br>
Due to this arrangement of the MWSE at the MWSE carrier, it is achieved that when the brush head<br>
is brought into contact, the contact area between the MWSE and the slip ring is substantially<br><br>
enlarged and is uniform in the circumferential direction, as a result of which uniform wear of the<br>
slip ring is brought about without groove formation and an essential enlargement of the contact<br>
area. This lowers the contact resistance, which in turn reduces the wear and prolongs the service<br>
life.<br>
Each MWSE preferably comprises a flexible carrier leaf, at one end of which a multiwire slip ring<br>
is arranged. This multiwire slip ring comprises a plurality of small wires, which are integrated in<br>
one or more layers in the manner of a paintbrush. It is achieved as a result that the current to be<br>
transmitted is again distributed among many individual sliding wires. Every individual wire can<br>
adapt itself flexibly to small unevennesses of the slip ring, as a result of which a contact area of<br>
maximum size is covered. In addition, the multiwire slip rings are preferably bent off outwardly at<br>
their free ends in order to improve their stability and their guidance on the slip ring. Furthermore,<br>
the bending causes that the multiwire slip rings will not be upset or bent when the slip ring is<br>
possibly rotated in the opposite direction.<br>
If one or more sliding wires drop off due to wear-related breakage of the material or for another<br>
reason, other, still fully or partially unworn wires may be arranged behind and next to these wires,<br>
which will come into contact with the slip ring instead of the wires that have fallen off. As a result,<br>
the service life of every individual MWSE is prolonged and a contact area of maximum size is<br>
always covered.<br>
Due to the offset of the MWSE layers and the scale-like overlapping structure, the multiwire slip<br><br>
rings of the MWSE. which touch each other, will not come into direct contact even in case of an<br>
unforeseen deep penetration of the slip ring into the brush area, in which case individual MWSE<br>
would be pressed against each other, and the MWSE cannot become mutually entangled.<br>
Even when individual wires of an MWSE drop off due to wear, these wires will not fall directly into<br>
a multiwire slip ring of the next MWSE layer, but they can fall out toward the outside through a free<br>
space due to the staggered positions of the individual MWSE layers.<br>
All these wear reduction measures are responsible for a prolongation of the service life of the brush<br>
block, a reduction of the risk of failure and a reduced frequency of maintenance.<br>
If the contact area is to be increased further, it is possible to arrange a plurality of brush blocks in<br>
such a way that they are arranged next to one another or one after another and distributed over the<br>
circumference of the slip ring. At least one third of the area of the slip ring is preferably covered by<br>
brush blocks.<br>
Since a plurality of sliding contacts are integrated in one brush block, they can be mounted and<br>
replaced easily, as a result of which the arrangement shown can be installed and maintained at low<br>
cost.<br>
Each brush block may cover either only part of the slip ring or the entire slip ring and accordingly<br>
ha\e a full inner circle or a section of an arc of a circle, on which stepped sections with MWSL:<br><br>
connected thereto arc arranged.<br>
Provisions are made in another imaginable embodiment of the present invention that the MWSE<br>
carrier and the slip ring are transposed with one another. In this case, the MWSE carrier is<br>
essentially round with stepped sections of the type shown on the outer circumference. The MWSE<br>
connected to the MWSE carrier correspondingly approach an outer circle with a slightly larger<br>
radius than the inner radius of the slip ring, which now lies on the outside.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the slip ring comprises two or more segments,<br>
which are insulated from one another and which are supplied with different currents via a plurality<br>
of differently poled brush blocks. It is achieved as a result that a plurality of currents can be<br>
transmitted on only one slip ring circumference in a space-saving manner in order to bring about,<br>
for example, pole reversals at regular intervals.<br>
furthermore, it is possible to vary geometrically the arrangement being shown such that the brush<br>
blocks are brought into contact with the front side rather than with the circumference of a slip ring.<br>
The slip ring carrier may have a plate-shaped design instead of a cylindrical design in this case. The<br>
design of the brush head correspondingly has a plurality of MWSE layers, which are arranged in the<br>
arc of the circle and describe circular sliding tracks on the front side of the slip ring. The individual<br>
layers are offset correspondingly similarly to the offset shown in case of circumferential brush<br>
blocks.<br><br>
The present invention is schematically shown in the drawings as an example. In the accompaying drawings.<br><br>
Figure 1	shows a diametric view of a multiwire sliding element,<br><br>
Figure 2	shows a side view of an MWSE carrier.<br>
Figure 3	shows a side view of a brush block,<br>
Figure 4	shows a front view of a brush block.<br>
Figure 5	shows a side view of a current transmission means with three brush blocks in conjunction<br>
with a slip ring, and<br>
Figure 6	shows a side view of a variant of an MWSE carrier.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention.the brush block (6) is used to transmit power<br>
currents to a slip ring (7). which is mounted on the circumferential side of a cylindrical carrier (8)<br>
rotating about the axis (13). The kinematic arrangement may also be reversed. The brush block (6).<br>
	which is present as one brush block or as a plurality of brush blocks, and the one or more slip rings<br>
(7) arranged in parallel form a current transmission unit (14). Figure 5 schematically shows a<br>
current transmission unit (14) with terminals (15) for power current, which are connected to the<br><br>
brush blocks (6). The slip ring or slip rings (7) has/have corresponding current connections.<br>
The brush block (6) comprises a plurality of multiwire sliding elements (3) (hereinafter called<br>
MWSE). which are connected electrically in parallel and are arranged and fastened in a uniformly<br>
distributed pattern at an MWSE carrier (4) in the direction of sliding (9). A plurality of MWSE (3)<br>
are arranged here at mutually spaced locations from one another one after another in an arc in the<br>
direction of sliding (9) or in the circumferential direction of the slip ring (7). In this arrangement,<br>
the M WSE (3) together form with their ends a shell-like enveloping curve curved concentrically<br>
with the axis of rotation (13) of the slip ring (7) and a sliding mat (10). which is adapted to the<br>
contour of the slip ring. A plurality of contact points are thus obtained for current transmission.<br>
As is shown in Figure 1. each multiwire sliding element (3) comprises an electrically conductive,<br>
rigid or flexible carrier blade (1), which is mounted with one end at the MWSE carrier (4) at a<br>
suitable fastening point (11) and at the other end of which a multiwire slip ring (2) is arranged. The<br>
multiwire slip ring (2) comprises a plurality of flexible, thin sliding wires, which are located next to<br>
one another and optionally one on top of another in a one-layer or multilayer, paintbrush-like<br>
arrangement. The sliding wires are preferably bent off outwardly or bent at their free end.<br>
The MWSE carrier (4) has an inner wall (12), which is bent concentrically with the axis (13) and at<br>
which a plurality of stepped incisions (5) are arranged in the embodiment according to Figure 2.<br>
The stepped incisions (5) have a step side (5'). which points toward the middle (13) and is directed<br>
approximately tangentially to the slip ring (7). and a step side (5") that is directed at right angles<br>
thereto |to the said former step side] and is preferably perpendicular. A plurality of MWSE (3) are<br><br>
preferably arranged on each step side (5') next to one another with fastening points (11). The<br>
tangentially directed step sides (5') are spaced from one another by the step sides (5") directed at<br>
right angles to them. The stepped sections (5) follow the curvature of the slip ring and form a bent<br>
stepped contour with one another.<br>
The MWSE (3) are directed essentially straight, and they lie with their carrier leaves (1) flatly on<br>
the ("auf den" in line 4. p. 9 of German original is a typo for "auf der" - Tr.Ed.] step side (5') and are<br>
directed tangentially to the slip ring (7). The MWSE (3) of one step form an MWSE layer (A, B).<br>
the layers of a plurality of adjacent steps overlapping in a scale-like pattern. The layers (A, B)<br>
alternate regularly.<br>
The tangential step side (5') is directed such that the free ends of the individual MWSE layers (A. B)<br>
describe the said enveloping curve (10). The radius of this enveloping curve (10) is preferably<br>
somewhat smaller than the radius of the slip ring (7) that can be brought into contact. As a result,<br>
the elastic multiwire slip rings (2) of the MWSE layers are preferably in contact with the<br>
circumference or the jacket of the slip ring (7) with a slight pressure.<br>
As is shown in Figure 4. two or more MWSE layers (A. B) are preferably offset in relation to one<br>
another and have different numbers of MWSE (3). For example, three MWSE (3) are arranged next<br>
to one another in layer (A). The layer (B) has two MWSE (3). The lateral offset of the layers (A.<br>
B) is such that the multiwire slip rings (2) of one layer (A) are exactly staggered in relation to the<br>
multiwire slip rings (2) of an adjacent layer (B). The multiwire slip rings (2) of one layer (A. B)<br><br>
form a common two- or three-part sliding track on the circumference of a slip ring (7) that is to be<br>
brought into contact. The offset of the layers (A, B) is such that the different sliding tracks of the<br>
layers (A. B) together form a continuous, broad overall sliding track.<br>
The MWSF (3) arc connected to the MWSE carrier preferably by welding or riveting in the area of<br>
the stepped incisions (5) at the points (11). The carrier leaves (1) are fastened to the respective<br>
tangential step sides (5').<br>
As is shown in Figure 5. a plurality of brush heads (6) are preferably arranged distributed over the<br>
circumference of the slip ring (7). Furthermore, a plurality of brush heads (6) may be arranged next<br>
to one another in order to generate additional or broader sliding tracks.<br>
Figure 6 shows a variant of the MWSE carrier (4) and of the shape as well as of the fastening of the<br>
individual multiwire sliding elements MWSE (3). The carrier (4) has an essentially smooth inner<br>
wall (12) that is concentric with the axis (13) in this embodiment without the stepped incisions<br>
present in the previous exemplary embodiment. At their carrier leaves (1), the MWSE (3) have foot<br>
parts or foot tabs (16). which are bent on the end side, are in contact with the inner wall (12) in<br>
some areas, and are connected thereto in an electrically conductive manner in a suitable manner by<br>
welding, soldering, riveting, screwing or the like.<br>
Various variants of the embodiment shown are possible. On the one hand, the number and the<br>
arrangement of the brush blocks (6) may vary. On the other hand, the number, distribution and<br>
arrangement of the MWSF (3) within the brush blocks (6) may be modified. A disk-shaped design<br><br>
of the slip ring (1) with correspondingly bent brush blocks (6) and with MWSE (3) arranged one<br>
after another in an arc is also possible.<br><br>
