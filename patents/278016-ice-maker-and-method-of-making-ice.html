ICE   MAKER   AND   METHOD   OF   MAKING   ICE<br>
Technical   Field<br>
The present invention relates to an ice maker and a method of making ice, and more<br>
particularly, to an ice maker and a method of making ice which can rapidly make slush<br>
or ice by using a supercooled liquid made by supplying energy such as an electric<br>
field, and easily separate the ice by converting the ice into a supercooled state by<br>
supplying energy.<br>
Background   Art<br>
Supercooling means that a liquid such as water is not transited to a solid but<br>
maintained in a high temperature phase, namely, a liquid phase even below a phase<br>
transition temperature to the solid. Water drops can be supercooled in the natural state.<br>
In addition, water or beverages may be incidentally supercooled in a general re-<br>
frigerator. A freezing method disclosed under Japan Laid-Open Patent Official Gazette<br>
S59-151834 and a freezing method and a refrigerator disclosed under Japan Laid-Open<br>
Patent Official Gazette 2001-086967 apply the supercooling principle to the re-<br>
frigerator. An electric field or a magnetic field is applied to foods of the refrigerator, so<br>
that the foods can be maintained in a supercooled state below a phase transition<br>
temperature. An electrostatic field processing method disclosed under International<br>
Publication Official Gazette WO/98/41115 suggests various types of electrode<br>
structures that can be used to supercool and thaw foods.<br>
Fig. 1 is a structure view illustrating a transparent ice maker disclosed under Korea<br>
Laid-Open Patent Official Gazette 2006-0013721. The transparent ice maker 100<br>
includes a supercooling means 120 using blades 122. Thin plate ice is laminated by<br>
supplying supercooled water made by the supercooling means 120 to an ice making<br>
means 110 including an ice tray 111, an ice making chamber 112, a rotating shaft 114,<br>
ejectors 113 and a heater 117 at very small quantities, thereby making transparent ice.<br>
Here, heat is applied to the ice tray 111 by the heater 117 to separate the ice from the<br>
ice tray 111. The ice is slightly thawed to be easily separated from the ice tray 111.<br>
Thereafter, the ice is separated from the ice tray 111 by the ejectors 113 by rotating the<br>
rotating shaft 114.<br>
The conventional ice maker supercools water by the mechanical method using the<br>
blades, and makes the thin plate ice by supplying the supercooled water at very small<br>
quantities. Therefore, the ice maker can not rapidly make the slush or ice.<br>
 <br>
In addition, the conventional ice maker uses only the heater to thaw the ice for easy<br>
ice separation. Accordingly, a temperature of the ice tray 111 must be increased to a<br>
phase transition temperature of water.<br>

Mode   for   the   Invention<br>
An ice maker and a method of making ice in accordance with the present invention<br>
will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 2 is a concept view illustrating slush making or supercooling in axordance<br>
with the present invention. Referring to Fig. 2, a liquid 41 which is a supercooling<br>
object is disposed between electrodes 40. In a state where cool air 42 is supplied, an<br>
electric field is applied to the liquid 41 by using an AC power source 43. Therefore,<br>
the liquid 41 is not frozen but supercooled below its phase transition temperature (for<br>
example, water in 0°C under 1 atm pressure). It is know that supply of energy such as<br>
an electric field interrupts hydrogen bonding of water consisting of oxygen and<br>
hydrogen, and thus water is not frozen. When an external force is applied to the su-<br>
percooled liquid by a phase converter 44, for example, when electric force is applied to<br>
the supercooled liquid by an electric igniter, the supercooled state maintained by the<br>
energy which is being applied to the supercooled liquid or the energy which has been<br>
applied to the supercooled liquid (it means that the supercooled state can be<br>
maintained although energy supply is interrupted after a predetermined time) is<br>
disturbed by the force. Accordingly, freezing cores are formed, and the supercooled<br>
liquid is rapidly converted into a solid phase, thereby generating slush. Here, a<br>
temperature of the supercooled liquid is changed from a supercooled state temperature<br>
to a phase transition temperature.<br>
The experiment result of the present invention will now be explained.<br>
1.	Installation of Electrodes and Container<br>
Two electrodes having width and length of 100mm were installed at an interval of<br>
200mm. A container containing 1L of water was positioned between the two<br>
electrodes at a predetermined interval.<br>
2.	Supercooling<br>
The above apparatus was put in a refrigerator having a temperature of -6.8°C and an<br>
electric field of 40kHz and 2kV was applied thereto. As soon as the apparatus was put<br>
into the refrigerator, the electric field was applied to the apparatus. After sufficient su-<br>
percooling, the supercooled liquid was converted into a solid phase by using an electric<br>
igniter for 1500V electric lighter. The result was shown in Fig. 6.<br>
Fig. 3 is a graph showing one example of the experiment result, especially,<br>
correlation between the applied power and the temperature of the supercooled liquid.<br>
 <br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the applied power and the temperature of the supercooled liquid<br>
show almost linear proportion. It means that, in the given ambient temperature, the set<br>
temperature of the supercooled liquid can be controlled by adjusting power applied<br>
from an energy generator.<br>
Fig. 4 is a structure view illustrating an ice maker in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. A water tank 21, a tray 22 and a bank 23 are<br>
installed in order on a freezing chamber door 20. The water tank 21 is necessary to<br>
make a supercooled liquid. Electrodes 21a for applying electric field type energy are<br>
installed as an energy generator. A passage 21b is connected to the water tank 21, for<br>
supplying water. A valve 21c controls water supply to the water tank 21, and a valve<br>
21d controls supercooled water supply to the tray 22. A temperature sensor 21e is<br>
formed at one side of the water tank 21, for measuring a temperature of the su-<br>
percooled water. The tray 22 is rotatably installed, and rotation of the tray 22 is<br>
controlled by a motor 22a. Preferably, the tray 22 is made of a conductive material<br>
such as aluminum. A heater 22b is formed at the lower portion of the tray 22 for ice<br>
separation. On the other hand, an electric igniter 22c is installed at one side of the tray<br>
22 as a phase converter. The electric igniter 22c is disposed to apply an electric shock<br>
to the tray 22 or the supercooled water contained in the tray 22, thereby converting the<br>
supercooled liquid into a solid phase, namely, slush. The tray 22 Is divided into a<br>
plurality of sections by partitions 22d. Grooves are formed on connecting units 22e to<br>
link the supercooled liquid together, or for the supercooled liquid so as to<br>
communicate with one another, so that the electric shock applied to a specific point<br>
can be transmitted to the whole supercooled water. A bank 23 is formed at the lower<br>
portion of the tray 22, for containing slush or ice supplied from the rotated tray 22.<br>
Fig. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a method of operating the ice maker in<br>
accordance with the present invention. When the valve 21c is opened, water is<br>
supplied to the water tank 21. The supplied water is supercooled by cool air of a<br>
freezing chamber and electric field type energy generated by the electrodes 21a, and<br>
maintained below a phase transition temperature without phase transition. According<br>
to a command of the user or temperature measurement of the temperature sensor 21e,<br>
the valve 21d is opened to supply the supercooled water to the tray 22. The su-<br>
percooled water is frozen without the operation of the electric igniter 22c, converted<br>
into slush by the operation of the electric igniter 22c and then frozen, or converted into<br>
slush by the operation of the electric igniter 22c. The tray 22 is rotated by the operation<br>
of the motor 22a, so that the slush or ice can be contained in the bank 23. As shown in<br>
 <br>
Fig. 1, the motor 22a serves to rotate ejectors (not shown). It is also possible to supply<br>
the ice to the bank 23 by the operation of the ejectors without rotating the tray 22.<br>
When the ice is supplied to the bank 23, the heater 22d is operated to separate the ice<br>
from the tray 22.<br>
Fig. 7 is a structure view illustrating an ice maker in acordance with another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The ice maker 50 includes a tray 51 and an ice<br>
separator 52 disposed at the upper portion of the tray 51. The tray 51 includes a plural<br>
ity of sections 51a. Ice 51b is contained in each section 51a. A heater 53 is installed at<br>
the lower portions of the plurality of sections 51a. Electrodes 54 for supplying electric<br>
field type energy are formed at both sides of the tray 51. The ice separator 52 includes<br>
a rotating shaft 52a, ejectors 52b connected to the rotating shaft 52a, and a motor 52c<br>
for rotating the rotating shaft 52a. Preferably, the tray 51 is made of a material having<br>
high electricity and heat conductivity for heat transmission and electric field type<br>
energy transmission.<br>
A method of making and separating ice in accordance with the present invention<br>
will now be described. When the ice 51b is made by freezing water oontained in the<br>
tray 51 in the freezing chamber, energy is applied to the ice side by the electrodes 54 to<br>
lower the phase transition temperature of water, and heat is applied to the ice side by<br>
the heater 53. As a result, the ice maker 50 can more rapidly separate the ice 51b than<br>
the general ice maker. Thereafter, the ice 51b is separated from the tray 51 by the<br>
ejectors 52b by driving the motor 52c.<br>
