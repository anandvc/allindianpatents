				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE ON-S1TE GENERATION OF A<br>
GAS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus for the on-site generation of a gas, particularly, but not exclusively, chlorine gas.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
There are numerous advantages of having a facility for the on-site generation of chlorine gas. Chlorine gas is considered to be a hazardous substance and strict controls govern its storage and transport. In addition and because of its hazardous status, it is expensive, to .transport pressurised vessels -containing liquid chlorine. This increases the costs of production facilities using the gas.<br>
There is also a market, for on-site generators of relatively small volumes of chlorine<br>
gas, in facilities that use small quantities of chlorine gas.   These facilities include<br>
water purification and sewage  treatment plants and cooling towers where water used<br>
in these towers is chlorinated. To avoid having to store large quantities of liquid chlorine or chlorine in  a solid granulated or palletized form, these facilities could make use of an on-site  and on demand apparatus for generating chlorine gas and sodium hypochlorite are also used as a disinfectant.<br>
In addition, relatively small chlorine gas generators can be used in rural communities to purity and render potable water drawn from small dams and rivers.<br>
In addition to chlorine generation apparatuses there is also a market for apparatuses which generate other gasses on an on-demand and on-site basis. Such gasses would include the halogen bromine which is used as an agricultural soil sterilizing agent and which is particularly effective in combating nematode infestations of the soil.<br>
Apparatuses which generate chlorine gas by means of electrolysis are well known. These apparatuses generate chlorine gas from the anode of an electrolytic cell through which a solution of sodium chloride is passed. At the cathode hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide are produced.<br>
Many of the above-mentioned apparatus are suitable for and have been used for the on-site generation of chlorine gas. One example is disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,308,123.   In this example an electrolytic cell having an anode and a cathode separated from one another by a chemically resistant ion exchange membrane permeable only to positively charged ions is used.  The anode chamber is charged with an acidic sodium chloride solution while the cathode chamber is charged with a basic aqueous solution.   When an electric current is passed through the chamber chlorine gas is produced at the anode and hydrogen and sodium, hydroxide are produced at the cathode.     Chlorine arid sodium hydroxide generated may be. combined to form sodium hypochlorite.<br>
The above-described apparatus has a disadvantage in that anolyte and catholyte feed tanks or reservoirs as well as anolyte and catholyte surge tanks are necessary.<br>
These tanks represent a potential hazard particularly in a semi-industrial environment where strict safety controls may not be diligently enforced.<br>
Furthermore, many known gas generators require pumps to circulate the electrolyte solutions'. There pumps require a source of energy and, often sophisticated, control systems. In addition they also need regular maintenance which,' in remote areas, is a disadvantage particularly given the potentially hazardous nature of the gases produced.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and an apparatus for the on-site generation of gasses, particularly chlorine gas, which at least partly alleviates the above-mentioned disadvantages.<br>

Figures 2A to C are, respectively, a schematic first side view, a schematic second side view and a schematic plan view of an apparatus for the on-site generation of chlorine gas according to the method of Figure 1; and<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE DRAWINGS<br><br>
Referring to Figure 1. a method for the on-site generation of chlorine gas comprises the steps of:<br>
a) forming a first dissociatable, sodium chloride or brine, electrolyte solution (1) which is conveyed, through a conduit (2), to an anolyte section (3) of an electrolytic cell (7), and a second dissociatable, basic aqueous, solution (4) which is conveyed, through a conduit (5) to a catholyte section (6) of an electrolytic cell (7) which is divided into its sections by a perfluoropolymer membrane (8) which, while allowing the passage of sodium ions therethrough, is impermeable to chlorine, hydrogen and hydroxyl ions;<br>
b) heating the first dissociatable electrolyte solution (1) prior to conveying it to the anolyte section (3) of the electrolytic ceil (7) thereby causing it to circulate and re-circulate through the conduits and through the electrolytic cell (7) by means of a thermosyphon effect;<br>
c)	liberating, from the electrolyte solutions chlorine gas,  in the<br>
anolyte section (3) and hydrogen gas, in the catholyte section (6);<br>
d)	entraining chlorine and hydrogen gas bubbles in the electrolyte<br>
solutions thereby facilitating circulation of the electrolyte solutions<br>
by means of gas lift, and collecting chlorine gas (9) and hydrogen<br>
gas (10);<br>
e)	the method being characterised in that at no time is the electrolyte<br>
solution stored in a reservoir.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, the electrolysis cell (7) has an anode in its anolyte section (3.) and a cathode in its catholyte section (6). The anode and cathode are connected to the positive and negative poles respectively of a direct current supply (11) which, in this embodiment, is a direct current power converter. The direct current power converter (11) receives alternating current (12) from a suitable alternating current source.<br>
As the salt in the first dissociatable electrolyte solution (1) becomes depleted it is refreshed  by  adding  salt from  a  salt supply  hopper  (14)  to  the substantially, horizontally  orientated   electrolyte   salt  dissolving  tube  through  which  the first chlorinated electrolyte solution circulates before being strained,  heated and re-circulated to the electrolysis cell (7).<br>
As the solution on the anode side becomes volumetrically depleted, it is compensated by the addition of pure fresh brine (200) into the system. This pure fresh-brine is made up in item 201 where mains water is passed through a separate salt dissolving tube similar to that described in (1) above including a separate salt separator/strainer but the saturated solution so formed is then passed through a column containing a proprietary type resin which removes heavy metal anion impurities prior to transferring the purified solution via a conduit (200) to the anolyte system (1). The second dissociatable electrolyte solution (4) is refreshed by the addition of water from the water supply (13) after it has passed though a demineralizing unit (15).<br>
In addition to chlorine and hydrogen gas, the method includes producing sodium hypochlorite in a reactor ((16). Sodium hypochlorite is formed by combining chlorine and. sodium hydroxide produced in the anolyte and catholyte sections (3 &amp; 6) of the electrolysis cell (7) respectively. Once produced the sodium hypochlorite is stored in a storage facility (17). Sodium hydroxide produced in the catholyte section (6) of the .electrolysis cell (7) can also be drawn off and stored in a storage facility (18).<br>
Referring to Figures 2 A, B and C, an apparatus (20) for the on-site generation of chlorine gas comprises at-least one electrolysis cell (21) having an anolyte section and a catholyte section. At least one section which, in this embodiment, is the anolyte section, is connected by a conduit (22) to a fluid heater (23) which, in use, heates an electrolyte solution prior to its ingress into said section of the electrolysis cell (21) and facilitates circulation of the electrolyte-solution through the apparatus by means of a thermosyphon effect.<br>
The electrolyte solution is dissociatable into positively and negatively .charged ions at least one of which is an ion of a gaseous element. In this embodiment chlorine gas is generated  and the electrolyte solution  in the anolyte section of the apparatus becomes an acidic sodium chloride solution when chlorine meets with water to form hypochlorous acid which dissociates into positively charged sodium and hydrogen ions and negatively charged chlorine and hydroxyl ions.  The chlorine and hydrogen ions combine with like ions to form chlorine and hydrogen gas each of which is circulated together with the electrolyte solution through gas separators (24 &amp; 25) which separate the chlorine gas and hydrogen gas respectively from the electrolyte solutions.   In this embodiment the hydrogen gas is a waste product and is vented to atmosphere while the chlorine gas is used or processed further to produce sodium hypochlorite  by combining  chlorine with  sodium  hydroxide,   both  of .which  are produced by the apparatus.<br>
Each electrolysis cell (21) is divided into an anolyte section and a catholyte section by a perfluoropolymer membrane which allows sodium ions to pass therethrough but does not allow chlorine, hydrogen or hydroxyl ions to pass through it. This membrane effectively divides the apparatus as well as the electrolysis cell into an anolyte section and a catholyte section.<br>
As electrolyte passes through the anolyte section of the electrolysis cell (21), chlorine gas is formed at the anode and becomes entrained in the electrolyte solution which is depleted. The entrained gas bubbles facilitate circulation of the electrolyte and entrained gas bubbles to a chlorine gas separator (24) by means of a gas lift. After passing through the chlorine gas separator (24), the depleted electrolyte flows through a conduit (26) and enters a substantially horizontally orientated electrolyte salt dissolving tube (27) which is supplied with sodium chloride salt from a salt hopper (28) through a chute (29). In the salt dissolving tube (27) the electrolyte solution is refreshed. Salt crystals in the electrolyte solution are removed by passing<br>
the refreshed electrolyte  solution through a salt separator and strainer (30) from which it is returned to the fluid heater (23) for the process to be repeated.<br>
As electrolyte passes through the catholyte section of the electrolysis cell (21), hydrogen gas is produced at the cathode. The bubbles of hydrogen gas, like the chlorine gas, become entrained in the electrolyte solution and facilitate circulation thereof through a hydrogen gas separator (25). After removal of the hydrogen and sodium hydroxide, water which has passed through a demineralisation column (31) is added to refresh the catholyte electrolyte solution which passes through the catholyte section of the electrolysis cell (21).<br>
The catholyte electrolytic solution is not heated directly as is the anolyte electrolysis solution. It is, however, heated in the electrolysis cell (21) as a result of it being in contact with the heated anoiyte electrolyte solution. It is envisaged that heating of the anolyte electrolysis solution prior to its introduction into the electrolysis cell improves the efficiency of the gas generation process for the electrolyte is at its optimum temperature. Electric current for the anode, cathode and heater is supplied by a mains alternating current supply. In the case of the supply to the anode and cathode it passes through a direct current converter (not shown).<br>
Referring to Figures 3 A, B and C, details of a series of electrolysis cells (40) for use in the apparatus of Figure 2 are shown. In this embodiment there are two electrolysis •cells (40) each separated by a perfluoropolymer membrane (41) which is permeable to sodium ions but impermeable to chlorine,, hydrogen and hydroxyl ions.<br>
Each cell (40) has an anode (42) at which chlorine gas is generated and a cathode (43) at which hydrogen gas is generated. The cells (40) are formed by bolting together a series of plates, two-of. which are end plates. (44) which have anolyte<br>
electrolyte solution inlets (45) and outlets (46) and catholyte electrolyte solution inlets (47) and outlets (48). The inner spacer plates (100) form the counter through which anolyte electrolysis solution flows in at a bottom corner of the plate and consequently the cell and egresses at the opposite top corner. In a similar fashion, the catholyte electreolysis solution  ingresses the cell at the opposite bottom corner to the anolyte<br><br>
electrolysis solution, and egresses at the opposite top.   The anolyte and catholyte thus flow in a countercurrent which, in use, maximises efficiency. The complete assembly is bolted together  using backing plates  (101) and the bolts (102).<br>
It will be appreciated that numerous variations can be made to the above described embodiment of the invention without departing from the scope thereof. In particular, the embodiments describe a method and an apparatus for the generation of chlorine gas and hydrogen gas. The same apparatus can be used for the generation of bromine gas or, indeed, any gas which can be produced by an electrolytic reaction.<br><br><br><br><br>
