				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to glass laminated parabolic trough reflectors and process of manufacture thereof. The parabolic trough reflectors find applications in process heat and solar thermal power generation.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Parabolic trough reflectors/collectors are solar devices that concentrate solar radiations on to the focal line of the mirror. The device converts direct solar radiation into thermal energy and is ideal for working in the 150°C- 400°C temperature range. A parabolic trough reflector is basically made up a parabolic trough shaped mirror which is silver polished on the convex side of parabola and which reflects direct solar radiation, concentrating it on a receiver tube located in the focal line of the parabola. This concentrated radiation heats the fluid that circulates through the tube thus transforming the solar radiation into thermal energy.<br>
Conventional parabolic trough reflectors (fig.l) comprise of a moulded glass sheet (1) generally of 4mm thickness having a silver reflective surface (2) on its convex side. This silver surface is protected by two copper layers (3,4). The said copper layers are protected by two synthetic material layers (5,6) which are further protected by two enamel paint layers (7,8). Such a parabolic trough reflector concentrates solar radiations on a heat receiver tube located on the focal line of the<br>
parabola. Such concentrated heat radiations heat the fluid that circulates through the heat transfer tube, thus transforming solar radiations into thermal energy.<br>
A disadvantage of the above parabolic trough reflectors is these are breakable in nature. The broken pieces of the parabolic mirror fall apart from the supporting plate and fall on the lower half of glass surface of the parabolic trough reflector (PTR) and damage it. These broken pieces sometimes fall on the glass surface of Heat Collection Element/absorber tube and cause damage to it, which in turn results in loss of solar heat. The breakage of the parabolic trough reflectors is generally caused by thermal stress, high wind, vibrations during earthquake, repeated hitting by peacocks by their beaks, after their seeing their image in mirror and impact on account of solid objects during cleaning.<br>
Another disadvantage of the above type of mirrors is that the silver reflecting surface on the convex side of the parabola gets peeled-off over a period of time due to ingress of moisture through the scratch points on the silver polished surface of the mirror.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the above-type of mirrors is that during transportation or mounting of the reflectors, scratches occur on the reflective surface of mirror which ultimately dead to peeling of the polish due to ingress of moisture through the scratches thus caused.<br>
Further drawback of the above type of PTR is that the glass generally used in these PTRs is a naturally cooled glass which is more fragile due to invisible micro-cracks.<br>
US Patent No. 4,297,003 discloses a solar collector module comprising an extended width parabolic trough collector supported from pylons. The collector is formed by a center module and two wing modules which are joined together along abutting edges by connecting means.<br>
A drawback of the above patent is that the parabolic trough collector comprises of a single glass mirror and has therefore same disadvantages as described above.<br>
US Patent No. 4,427,838 discloses a high concentration solar energy reflector which collects direct solar radiation as well as diffused solar radiation. A reflector focuses direct radiation on to a first collector and reflects a substantial portion of the diffused radiation on to a second collector positioned near the focus of the reflector.<br>
However, the above reflector is also made of single glass reflecting surface and is therefore attended to with the disadvantages described for conventional reflectors.<br>
US Patent No. 3,985,119 discloses a solar energy collector system providing a mechanically oriented parabolic trough direct radiation collector having along the focal line a portion of a first fluid conduit<br>
system and outside the focal line, a portion of a second fluid conduit system. A second collector system is provided to conserve heat at the fluid conduit systems and a glass-front enclosure is provided over the parabolic trough collector.<br>
However, the above parabolic trough collector is based on a single glass reflecting surface which is vulnerable to breakage due to thermal stresses, vibrations, unintentional hits or hits by beaks of peacocks etc. leading to the disadvantages as described above.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to propose a glass laminated parabolic trough reflector which is non-breakable.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a glass laminated parabolic trough reflector wherein reflective surface comprises two glass surfaces which are laminated together with polyvinyl butyral film in between. Such lamination enhances strength of the glass surface by 2 to 3 times and does not allow the cracked pieces to fall apart. The lamination works as a damper to vibrations of impact. This immmizes the breakage of Heat Collection Element (HCE) and reflectors which is caused in conventional parabolic trough reflectors/collectors by falling pieces from the broken glass surface of the parabolic trough reflector.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a glass Laminated parabolic trough reflector which has 2-3% more efficiency than the conventional parabolic trough reflectors.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose a glass laminated parabolic trough reflector wherein the drawback of peeling off/scratching of polished surface is overcome by the laminated of two glass surfaces with a polyvinyl butyral film in between.<br>
