				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel water soluble sulfonated melamine formaldehyde ionic condensate. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel water soluble sulfonated melamine formaldehyde ionic condensate having general formula<br>
(Formula Removed).<br>
wherein,<br>
R = alkali metal salt of diamino or dihydroxyl sulfonic acid<br>
n = any integer between 10 and 100<br>
x = any integer between 2 and 10<br>
The invention further provides a process for the preparation of the novel sulfonated melamine formaldehyde ionic condensate.<br>
The product is envisaged to have several industrial applications. It finds potential application in leather processing industry as retanning agent that imparts improved grain tightness and buffing property in the resulting leather. The product may also be used for upgrading inferior quality raw hide/skin, whereby the resulting value added products may be useful for leather products industry. Further, the polymer finds application as polymer additive in the construction industry especially for colourful interior decoration.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Melamine formaldehyde condensates are conventionally prepared by polymerizing melamine with formaldehyde under controlled conditions of temperature, pressure and pH conditions. The hydrophobicity of the resulting condensed polymer restricts its use for aqueous based applications. Hence the product is made water soluble by introducing hydrophilic groups by sulfonation.    The    commercial    demand    of    water    soluble    melamine<br>
formaldehyde resin is significant primarily because of ease of preparation owing to the abundant availability of raw materials, and economy of production caused by short duration of production of the product to the extent of 6 hours. There have been several reports on the different features of the hitherto known melamine formaldehyde condensate products available in the public domain. Some of these properties which play a crucial role for certain specific industrial applications such as leather processing, are summarized below.<br>
Free Formaldehyde content<br>
The presence of free formaldehyde in a product to the extent of not less than 0.02% has been considered to be hazardous and even carcinogenic. The major limitation of the hitherto known processes is that the formaldehyde used for the purpose of the reaction results in significant amount of free formaldehyde content in the resulting products. This is an issue of much concern considering the awareness on health hazards arising out of free formaldehyde content in the product, thereby restricting the use of the resulting polymer for consumer products. Hence several attempts are being made by researchers in the present day context to provide products devoid of free formaldehyde or to restrict the free formaldehyde content of any product to the minimum.<br>
Aignesberger et al (US Patent No. 3,941,734) prepared sulfite modified melamine formaldehyde resin solution at ordinary atmospheric pressure for 1-3 hours at pH value of 8 - 11. The product was found to exhibit free formaldehyde content to the extent of 0.15%.<br>
Reference may be made to Sheldrick (US Patent No. 4,444,945), who prepared an aqueous solution of melamine formaldehyde condensation product having anionic sulfur groups by reacting with sulfate at atmosphere reflux and pH 8 -10 for 1-5 h. The product exhibits free formaldehyde content to the extent of 0.08%.<br>
Reference may be made to Dupuis et al (US Patent No. 5,424,390), who provided a process for manufacture of sulfonated melamine formaldehyde resins at super- atmospheric pressure at an elevated temperature of 100-130°C for 1- 5 hours at pH value of 5-7. However, the product exhibited free formaldehyde of 0.08%.<br>
This necessitates a requirement of providing a product of melamine formaldehyde resin with a free formaldehyde content not exceeding 0.02%.<br>
Particle size<br>
This is a very important parameter for chemicals to be used in processing industry. For example, leather processing requires a range of chemicals useful for filling up voids and imparting fullness. While melamine formaldehyde resin is known to be used as synthetic tanning agent in leather industry, bigger particle size of the product, which is not less than 100nm poses as a limitation for its use in leather industry for adequate penetration in the cross section, thereby necessitating additional filling auxiliaries for producing fuller leather, affecting the economy of leather industry adversely.<br>
The sulfite modified melamine resin solution provided by Aignesberger et al (US Patent No. 3,941,734) exhibited particle size of 250nm. Dupuis et al (US Patent  no.   5,424,390)  could  reduce  the  particle  size  of the  melamine<br>
formaldehyde condensation product to 200nm. Sheldrick (US Patent No. 4,444,945) provided melamine formaldehyde condensation product exhibiting particle size in the range of 120-140nm. It prompts researchers to explore possibilities to provide a melamine formaldehyde resin having particle size not exceeding 100nm.<br>
Free sulfate content<br>
Melamine formaldehyde resin finds application in leather as well as construction industries. The major limitation of the conventional products of this kind is that the product is prone to yellowing on ageing because of the presence of free sulfate present in the resin, whereby the sulfate, on ageing, breaks into sulfur that imparts the yellowish tone. In fact, the more the free sulfate content is, the more is the tendency for creating yellowing tone on ageing. Generally, the hithertoknown melamine formaldehyde resins have free sulfate content not exceeding 3.0%.<br>
While summarizing the processes for producing the hithertoknown melamine formaldehyde resins, it becomes evident that there is no mechanism available in the art to reduce the free sulfate content of the conventional resin, thereby leading to poor colour retention property. However, the aesthetic aspects of the user industries for this resin demand better colour retention of the polymer, necessitating reduction in the free sulfate content of the resin.<br>
Another limitation of the conventional processes is that the reaction temperature usually ranges between 100-130°C, thereby rendering the processes costlier because of the requirement of high temperature monitoring systems. Moreover, the usual reaction period extends upto the extent of 10<br>
hours, resulting in limited productivity. Attempts are therefore being made to reduce the production time to enhance the productivity.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel water soluble sulfonated melamine formaldehyde ionic condensate, which obviates the limitations as stated above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a melamine formaldehyde resin exhibiting free formaldehyde content not exceeding 0.02%.<br>

The rate of addition of the sulfonating agent is maintained in the range of 5-10 ml per minute. A known acid is then added to the resulting macromonomer solution of melamine formaldehyde to adjust its pH in the range of 2-4. The resulting solution is subjected to a temperature in the range of 50-80°C for a period of 1-6 hours to obtain a polymeric solution of sulfonated melamine formaldehyde ionic condensate. 1-5 % by weight of CaO is then added slowly to this polymeric solution under dynamic condition.
