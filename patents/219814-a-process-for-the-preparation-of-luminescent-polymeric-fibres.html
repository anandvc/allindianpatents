For certain applications it is recommendable to use a combination of different lanthanides, for example Eu and Tb. Such a mixture increases the degree of security of the hidden colourations, the sophistication of the security level and multiplies the coding possibilities.<br>
The compounds of formula I, II, III and IV are known, for instance from WO 96/20942 and from C.R. Hurt et a/., Nature 212, 179-180 (1966), or can be prepared by methods known per se. For example, a ligand such as acetylacetone, benzoylacetone, dibenzoylmethane,<br><br>
dipivaloylmethane, salicylic acid, valeric acid or caproic acid can be reacted under suitable conditions with a rare earth metal halide such as a lanthanide trichloride to produce the rare earth metal chelate. Further reaction with the monodentate or polydentate nitrogen-, oxygen-or sulfur-containing ligand L thus yielding the rare earth metal chelate compounds of formula I, II, III and IV.<br>
The luminescent lanthanide chelate can be applied as a powder, as a solution or as a<br>
dispersion.<br>
Accordingly, component (b) may be water, an organic solvent, a mixture of two or more<br>
organic solvents or a mixture of water and one or more organic solvents.<br>
Preferably, component (b) is water, one or more water-miscible organic solvents or a mixture of water and one or more water-miscible organic solvents.<br>
Suitable organic solvents include alcohols, glycols, ether alcohols, sulfoxides, amides, amines, heterocyclic solvents, ketones, ethers, esters, nitriles and aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
Examples of suitable organic solvents are methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, glycerol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, ethylene glycol monoethylether, polyethyleneglycol dimethyether, ethoxybutanol, 2-butoxyethanol, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), acetone, 2-butanone, diethylether, di-n-propylether, tetrahydrofurane (THF), ethyl acetate, ethyl propionate, acetonitrile, pyridine, n-pentane, n-hexane, cyclohexane, benzene and toluene.<br>

The compositions according to the invention may, in addition to components (a) and (b), comprise one ore more colorants (c).<br>
Suitable colorants are the well-known pigments and dyes including mixtures of different pigments and dyes.<br>
In the compositions according to the present invention the amounts of components (a) and (b) and where appropriate (c) and/or further ingredients (d) can vary within wide ranges.<br>
For a mass-dyeing process, the compositions according to the present invention consist of component (a). Optionally, further ingredients (c) and/or (d) may also be added together with (a) in order to give simultaneous supplementary propertie(s) to the polymeric material in addition to the UV-luminescence.<br>
For a dyeing process, preferred compositions contain 0.01 to 20.0 %, more preferably 0.05 to 10 % and in particular 0.1 to 5.0 %, by weight of component (a) and 80.0 to 99.99 %, more preferably 90.0 to 99.95 % and in particular 95.0 to 99.9 %, by weight of component (b)t based on the total amount of components (a) + (b).<br>
The amount of component (c) depends on the type of substrate as well as on the specific pigment or dye. Advantageous amounts will generally be 0.01% to 15% by weight and especially 0.1% to 10% by weight, of colorant based on the weight of fibre.<br>
Further ingredients (d) which may be present in the compositions according to the invention are e.g. optical brighteners, biocides, bactericides, fungicides insecticides and fragrance.<br>
The compositions containing at least one lanthanide chelate can be prepared by any suitable method known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the components of the composition can be combined and mixed in a suitable mixer or blender.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are useful for impregnating manufactured natural, artificial and especially synthetic hydrophobic materials, especially textile materials.<br><br>
Textile materials composed of blend fabrics comprising such manufactured natural polymer or synthetic hydrophobic fiber materials can likewise be impregnated with the formulations of the invention.<br>
Useful manufactured natural polymer textile materials are especially wool, cotton, silk, cellulose acetate and cellulose triacetate.<br>
Synthetic hydrophobic textile materials are especially linear aromatic polyesters, for example polyesters formed from a terephthalic acid and glycols, particularly ethylene glycol, or condensation products of terephthalic acid and 1,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane; polycarbonates, for example those formed from a,a-dimethyl-4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylmethane and phosgene; or fibres based on polyvinyl chloride or polyamide.<br>
The formulations according to the invention are applied to the textile materials according to known dyeing processes. For example, polyester fibres are exhaust dyed from an aqueous dispersion in the presence of customary anionic or nonionic dispersants with or without customary carriers at temperatures between 80 and 140°C, preferably between 120 and 135°C. Cellulose acetate is preferably dyed at between 60 to 85°C and cellulose triacetate at upto115°C.<br>
The formulations used according to the invention are useful for dyeing by the thermosol, exhaust and continuous processes and for printing processes. The exhaust process is preferred. The liquor ratio depends on the apparatus, the substrate and the make-up form. However, the liquor ratio can be chosen to be within a wide range, for example in the range from 4:1 to 100:1, but it preferably is between 6:1 to 25:1.<br>
The textile material mentioned may be present in the various processing forms, for example as a fibre, yarn or web or as a woven or loop-formingly knitted fabric.<br>
The luminescent lanthanide chelates of the invention are likewise useful for mass-dyeing of plastics.<br>
Accordingly, the invention further relates to a process for the preparation of luminescent plastics characterized in that the plastics material is extruded in the presence of 0.01 -10.0<br><br>
% by weight based on the amount of plastics material, of a compound of formula I, II, III or IV.<br>
Plastics useful for mass dyeing include for example dyeable high molecular weight organic materials (polymers) having a dielectric constant z 2.5, especially polyester, polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyamide, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene/acrylonitrile (SAN) or acryionitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS). Preference is given to polyester and polyamide. Particular preference is given to linear aromatic polyesters obtainable by polycondensation of terephthalic acid and glycols, especially ethylene glycol, or condensation products of terephthalic acid and 1,4-bis(hydroxymethy!)cyclohexane, for example polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polybutylene terephthalate (PBTP); polycarbonates, for example polycarbonates formed from a,ct-dimethyl-4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylmethane and phosgene; polymers based on polyvinyl chloride or polyamide, for example nylon 6 or nylon 6.6, polystyrene (PS) or polypropylene (PP).<br>
Very particular preference is given to plastics based on linear aromatic polyesters, for example those formed from terephthalic acid and glycols, particularly ethylene glycol, or condensation products of terephthalic acid and 1,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)cyciohexane, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polypropylene (PP) or polystyrene (PS).<br>
The plastics are dyed for example by mixing the luminescent lanthanide chelate according to component (a) into these substrates using roll mills or mixing or grinding apparatus whereby the lanthanide chelates are dissolved or finely dispersed in the plastic. The plastic with the admixed dyes is then processed in a conventional manner, for example by calendering, pressing, extrusion, spread coating, spinning, casting or injection moulding, whereby the dyed material acquires its ultimate shape. The mixing of the components can also be effected directly prior to the actual processing step, for example by continuously metering solid, for example pulverulent, lanthanide chelates and a granulated or pulverulent plastic and also optionally additional substances such as for example additives simultaneously directly into the inlet zone of an extruder where the mixing-in takes place just prior to the processing. In general, however, prior mixing of the lanthanide chelates into the plastic is preferable, since more uniformly impregnated substrates are obtainable.<br><br>
The invention further relates to luminescent textile fibre and to luminescent plastic prepared by the process described above.<br>
The present invention makes it possible to incorporate colourless or coloured hidden marks into various colourless, white, pale coloured or dark coloured substrates, which can be revealed under UV exposure.<br>
The claimed process is particularly useful for the manufacture of security fibres or security threads that can be applied to fiduciary documents or other materials. Security fibres are incorporated in fiduciary documents or other materials for the purpose of ensuring identification, an authentication, a protection against forgery, imitation or falsification. Security threads are continuous threads or strips of film introduced into fiduciary documents for the same purpose as security fibres.<br>
The expression "fiduciary documents" denotes papers, such as papers for bank notes, cheques, shares , bills, stamps, official documents, identity cards; passports, record books, notes, tickets, vouchers, bulletins, accounting books as well as credit, payment, access or multifunctional cards, and similar documents which necessarily involve a high degree of security.<br>
The manufacture of security fibres or security threads can be accomplished by known methods as described, for example, in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,655,788, 5,759,349 and 6,045,656, EP-A 185 396 and EP-A 1 013 824.<br>
Incorporation of the lanthanide chelate compound can be carried out by conventional dyeing or printing processes.<br>
Suitable fibres for the claimed process can be obtained from wood or vegetable pulp, cellulose pulp, cotton, linen or synthetic fibres.<br>
Preferably, paper fibres or synthetic fibres are used.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the process according to claim 1 is used for the preparation of anti-counterfeit documents, cards, cheques or banknotes.<br><br>
The compositions according to the invention distinguish from analogous prior art compositions by outstanding luminescence quantum yield, long-lasting luminescence and high luminescence intensity.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention.<br>
Ink Composition A:<br>
Concentrate of compound XVII in 1,2-propyIene glycol<br><br>
1 g of compound VIII is dissolved in 99 g of 1,2-propylenegIycol under heating at 100°C for 1 hour. The clear yellow solution is allowed to cool down and after filtration (clarification) provides the stable Ink Composition A which exhibits an intense red luminescence under UV light. This concentrate can be further used in either solvent based or aqueous based conventional or high-tech (ink-jet) printing formulations for paper, textile, leather, wood, plastic or other compatible substrates.<br>
Example 1:<br>
The impregnation of a cellulosic bobbin (0.75kg cotton thread 40tex) is performed at 35°C for 20 min in an alternated circulation dyeing apparatus (Callebault de Blicquy) (3 min cycle) with a liquour ratio of 1 to10. The liquour contains 4.5% of the compound of formula XVII<br><br>
in 2-butoxy-ethanol.<br>
After treatment, centrifugation and air-drying of the bobbin, strong red-orange fluorescence<br>
is observed under UV light.<br><br>
Example 2:<br>
The impregnation of a silk thread (iOg) is performed at 25°C for 10-60 min in the same<br>
liquour and liquour ratio to textile material as described in Example 1. After treatment,<br>
centrifugation and air-drying of the thread reveals strong red-orange fluorescence under UV<br>
light.<br>
Example 3:<br>
The impregnation of a patchwork fabric containing several distinct bands of synthetic, artificial, natural (vegetal and animal) fibers (20g) is performed at 25°C for 10-60 min in the same liquour and liquour ratio to textile material as described in Example 1. After treatment, centrifugation and air-drying of the patchwork reveals on most fibers strong red-orange fluorescence under UV light.<br>
Equivalent results are obtained from similar processes using other lanthanide complexes, exhibiting other emission wavelength under irradiation in the UV (e.g. terbium, dysprosium, samarium, neodymium).<br>

All above experiments of High Temperature Dyeing are also realised without using NMP, by<br>
a similar preparation method to that of Disperse Dyes, and by replacing the Disperse Dye<br>
with the UV fluorescent lanthanide chelate to be applied.<br><br>
Example 23:<br>
Transfer printing with UV fluorescent lanthanide chelates is performed by using transfer printing formulations containing one or more UV fluorescent lanthanide chelates.

Example 24:<br>
Preparation of a multi-component security thread<br>
A polymer mixture (e.g. copolymerised polyamide Akulon®, supplied by Akzoplastiks) is<br>
distributed to three extruders and the granules are melted. The melts indicated for the outer<br>
components of the thread are each mixed with 3 % by weight of a compound of formula<br>
(XVII) in such a way that it dissolves homogeneously in the polyamide melt. After extrusion<br>
of the multi-component threads a security thread is obtained the edge strips of which<br>
fluoresce under UV light whereas the central strip does not show any fluorescence.<br>
Co-extrusion of the lanthanide chelate(s) with one or more dyes or pigments provides<br>
coloured threads which are similarly fluorescent under UV light.<br>
