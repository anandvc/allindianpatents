				<td>WHITENESS PERCEPTION COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a cleaning and/or treatment compositions comprising a dye conjugate, and processes of making and using such compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Consumers prefer that articles, such as garments, maintain their initial color throughout the lifecycle of the article - even when such articles are repeatedly washed or cleaned.    For example, it is preferred that white surfaces remain white as such color is associated with the cleanliness.    However, the perception of color, in particular "whiteness" varies amongst consumers and is believed to result from the interaction of a number of parameters that include the cultural color associations of the observer.   For example, Egyptian and Mexican consumers typically perceive a blue hue as white, while Indian consumers typically perceive a violet pinkish hue as white.   In addition, while certain dyes may improve the whiteness perception of a situs, when employed in a cleaning and/or treatment compositions, such dyes deposit inefficiently and/or build up on a cleaned or treated situs. As a result, the whiteness perception of such situs may in fact be decreased due to discolouration that is believed to be caused by dye build up. While several techniques have been used to increase the efficiency of deposition of materials (See for example WO 2000/18862, WO 99/14245, WO 98/29528, WO 98/00500, WO 95/30042, US 6,579,842, US 6,586,384, US 5,972,049, US 3,597,304, GB 948678) there remains a need for cleaning and/or treatment compositions that can provide tailored color perceptions, such as "whiteness" or "blackness" without the negatives associated with dye build-up.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a cleaning and/or treatment compositions comprising a dye conjugate, and processes of making and using such compositions.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Definitions<br>
As used herein, the term "cleaning composition" includes, unless otherwise indicated, granular or powder-form all-purpose or "heavy-duty" washing agents, especially cleaning detergents; liquid, gel or paste-form all-purpose washing agents, especially the so-called heavy-duty liquid types; liquid fine-fabric detergents; hand dishwashing agents or light duty dishwashing agents, especially those of the high-foaming type; machine dishwashing agents, including the various tablet, granular, liquid and rinse-aid types for household and institutional use; liquid cleaning and disinfecting agents, including antibacterial hand-wash types, cleaning bars, mouthwashes, denture cleaners, car or carpet shampoos, bathroom cleaners; hair shampoos and hair-rinses; shower gels and foam baths and metal cleaners; as well as cleaning auxiliaries such as bleach additives and "stain-stick" or pre-treat types.<br>
As used herein, the term "situs" includes paper products, fabrics, garments and hard surfaces.<br>
As used herein, the term "polymer" encompasses oligomers.<br>
As used herein, the articles a and an when used in a claim, are understood to mean one or more of what is claimed or described.<br>
As used herein, "reactive dye" means a dye comprising at least one chromophore, said dye being capable of attaching to a hydroxy, an amino or a mercapto group of a substrate via a covalent bond.<br>
As used herein, "basis/cationic dye" means a dye comprising at least one chromophore, said at least one chromophore being part of the positive ion of said dye.<br>
Unless otherwise noted, all component or composition levels are in reference to the active level of that component or composition, and are exclusive of impurities, for example, residual solvents or by-products, which may be present in commercially available sources.<br>
All percentages and ratios are calculated by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
All percentages and ratios are calculated based on the total composition unless<br>
otherwise indicated.<br>
It should be understood that every maximum numerical limitation given throughout this specification includes every lower numerical limitation, as if such lower<br><br>
numerical limitations were expressly written herein.

Cleaning and/or Treatment Compositions<br>
It has been surprisingly found that dye conjugates can be used to at least partially coat a situs and that such coating can, at least in part, be readily stripped from the situs. Thus, when one or more of such dye conjugates are employed in a cleaning and/or fabric treatment composition, dye can be efficiently and uniformly deposited and readily removed, In addition, it is believed that dirt and soil adhere to such coating rather than the situs. Thus, when such coating is stripped, dirt and residual dye are removed and the negatives associated with dye build-up are mitigated. As a result, the colour perception of a treated situs, for example the whiteness or blackness, can be dramatically improved.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1; Synthesis of Remazol Blue or Lanasol Violet linked to CMC 50 grams of O-(carboxymethyl) cellulose is added to  1  liter of water, having a temperature of 50°C, containing 100 mg of Sigma crude cellulase preparation (Sigma C7502) and is stirred with a spatula to give a thick paste.   The pH is checked and, if necessary, adjusted to 4.5 by addition of 1M HC1. The solution temperature is maintained at 50'C for 30 minutes. The solution is blended vigorously to remove any lumps and then treated with 100 grams of anhydrous sodium sulphate, 10 grams of Remazol Brilliant Blue R ("RBB") or Lanasol Violet, and 10 grams of trisodium phosphate and the temperature is raised to 70'C.   The solution is stirred and maintained at 70°C on a hotplate magnetic stirrer for 2 hours.   While still hot, the solution is treated with 1.5 volumes of ethanol to precipitate the dyed polysaccharide which is then recovered on a nylon screen and excess liquid removed by squeezing. This material is redissolved in hot water by homogenizing in a blender and then recovered by precipitation with 1.5 volumes ethanol.   This process is repeated until the washings are essentially colourless.   The polysaccharide is then dissolved in 2 liters of water and dialyzed against flowing tap water for 16 hours. The polysaccharide is precipitated from solution by the addition of 2 volumes ethanol and a sufficient volume of 1M KC1 to induce precipitation of the dye polymer conjugate. The resulting dye polymer conjugate is collected on a nylon screen and dried by solvent exchange with ethanol and acetone and is dried in vacuo: the yield is 45 grams: RBB linked to CMC.   The resulting dye polymer conjugate is analyzed and found to have a weight average molecular weight of approximately 80,000 Daltons, a degree of ether substitution of approximately 0.4 and a dye substitution ratio of approximately 1:22.<br>

Brilliant Blue and Procion Blue HB.  50 ml of CMC-4 solution, prepared as described above, is warmed to 50°C and 0.1418 gram of sodium hydroxide is added to compensate for the buffer.   Next, 1 gram of anhydrous sodium sulfate is added.   After complete dissolution, 1.6 x 10"4 mole of dye and 0.1 g of trisodium phosphate are added and the temperature is raised to 70°C.  The solution is kept at this temperature and stirred for 2 hours.   While still hot, the solution is treated with 1.5 volumes of ethanol (75 ml) to precipitate the dyed polysacchande. This solution is cooled in an ice-bath, while stirring. The precipitate is then collected through filtration on a glass filter and washed with a 1/1.5   v/v  solution   of water/ethanol.   In   order  to  purify   the   dye-functionalized polysacchande, the residue is dissolved in approximately 30-40 ml water and warmed to 60-70°C.  The remaining ethanol is removed under vacuum, and the solution is stirred until complete dissolution occurs.   Then, the hot solution treated with 1.5 volumes of ethanol, cooled in an ice bath while stirring, and the precipitate is isolated through filtration.    This procedure is repeated until the filtrate is colourless.     The wet functionalized polysaccharide is eventually completely dried under vacuum.<br>

A dye solution comprising 0.25 grams of Basic Violet V3 C.I. 42555 dye in 2 liters of water is made and such solution is added to the clay suspension over a five hour period with continued mixing during the addition of the dye solution. The resulting dye/clay/water mixture is then mixed for another 48 hours.   After 48 hours the mixture is centrifuged and the supernatant is decanted. A washing step wherein the clay/dye precipitate is re-suspcndcd in 2 liters of distilled water and centrifuged and the supernatant is decanted is conducted. The re suspension/centrifugation step is repeated one more time.
