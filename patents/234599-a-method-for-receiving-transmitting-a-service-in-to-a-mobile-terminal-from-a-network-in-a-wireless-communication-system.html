				<td>A METHOD FOR RECEIVING/TRANSMITTING A<br>
SERVICE IN/TO A MOBILE TERMINAL FROM A<br>
NETWORK IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION<br>
SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for receiving/transmitting a service in/to a<br>
mobile terminal from a network in a wireless communication system and, generally relates to<br>
a radio communication system, and more particularly, to a radio communication system and<br>
method for transmitting and receiving a multimedia broadcast/multicast service.<br>
Background Art<br>
Radio communication systems have remarkably improved; however, when<br>
providing communication services dealing with a large capacity of data, radio systems<br>
have not provided the same functions provided by wired communication systems. Ac-<br>
cordingly, countries around the world are developing technologies, such as IMT-2000,<br>
a wireless communication system enabling a large capacity of data communication.<br>
Cooperation between many countries is currently progressing to create a specification<br>
for the technology.<br>
A universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) is a third generation<br>
mobile communication system evolving from the Global System for Mobile Commu-<br>
nications (GSM) system, which is the European standard. The UMTS is aimed at<br>
providing enhanced mobile communications services based a GSM core network and<br>
Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) technologies.<br>
In December 1998, ETSI of Europe, AREB/TTC of Japan, Tl of the United States<br>
of America, and TTA of Korea formed a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)<br>
for the purpose of creating a specification for standardizing the UMTS. The work<br>
towards standardizing the UMTS performed by the 3GPP has resulted in the formation<br>
of five technical specification groups (TSGs), each of which is directed to forming<br>
network elements having independent operations.<br>
Each TSG develops, approves, and manages a specification in a related region.<br>
Among them, a radio access network (RAN) group (TSG-RAN) develops a spec-<br>
ification for the function, items desired, and interface of a UMTS terrestrial radio<br>
access network (UTRAN), which is a new RAN for supporting a W-CDMA access<br>
technology in the UMTS.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a related art UMTS network 1 structure is shown. The<br>
UMTS broadly comprises a user equipment (UE or terminal) 10, a UMTS Terrestrial<br>
Radio Access Network (UTRAN) 100, and a core network (CN) 200. The UE 10 is<br>
connected to the core network 200 through the UTRAN 100. The UTRAN 100<br>
configures, maintains, and manages a radio access bearer for communications between<br>
the UE 10 and the core network 200 to meet end-to-end quality-of-service re-<br>
quirements.<br>
The UTRAN comprises a plurality of radio network subsystems (RNS) 110, 120,<br>
each of which comprises one radio network controller (RNC) 111 for a plurality of<br>
base stations, or Node Bs 112, 113. The RNC 111 connected to a given Node B 112,<br>
113 is the controlling RNC for allocating and managing the common resources<br>
provided for any number of UEs 10 operating in one cell. The controlling RNC 111<br>
controls traffic load, cell congestion, and the acceptance of new radio links. Each Node<br>
B 112, 113 may receive an uplink signal from a UE 10 and may transmit a downlink<br>
signals to the UE. Each Node B 112, 113 serves as an access point enabling a UE 10 to<br>
connect to the UTRAN 100, while an RNC 111 serves as access point for connecting<br>
the corresponding Node Bs to the core network 200.<br>
The interface between the UE 10 and the UTRAN 100 is realized through a radio<br>
interface protocol established in accordance with 3GPP radio access network speci-<br>
fications. Referring to Figure 2, a related art radio interface protocol structure used in<br>
the UMTS is shown. The radio interface protocol is divided horizontally into a<br>
physical layer, a data link layer, and a network layer, and is divided vertically into a<br>
user plane for data transmissions and a control plane for transfer of control signaling.<br>
The user plane is the region in which user traffic information, such as voice signals and<br>
IP (Internet Protocol) packets is transferred. The control plane is the region for<br>
carrying control information for the maintenance and management of the interface. In<br>
Figure 2, protocol layers may be divided into a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2),<br>
and a third layer (L3) based on the lower three layers of an open system inter-<br>
connection (OSI) model that is a well-known in the art.<br>
The first layer (L1) is a physical layer (PHY) providing information transfer<br>
service to a higher layer using various radio transmission techniques. The physical<br>
layer is linked to a medium access control (MAC) layer located above it. Data travels<br>
between the MAC layer and the PHY layer via a transport channel.<br>
The second layer (L2) comprises the MAC layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer,<br>
a broadcast/multicast control (BMC) layer and a packet data convergence protocol<br>
(PDCP) layer. The MAC layer of the second layer (L2) provides assignment service of<br>
a MAC parameter for assigning and re-assigning a radio resource. It is connected to an<br>
upper layer, i.e., the radio link control (RLC) layer by a logical channel. Various<br>
logical channels may be provided according to the type information transmitted.<br>
Generally, when control plane information is transmitted, a control channel is used.<br>
When user plane information is transmitted, a traffic channel is used.<br>
The RLC layer of the second layer (L2) supports the transmission of reliable data<br>
and is responsible for the segmentation and concatenation of RLC service data units<br>
(SDUs) delivered from a higher layer. The size of the RLC SDU is adjusted for the<br>
processing capacity in the RLC layer and a header is appended to form an RLC<br>
protocol data unit (PDU) for delivery to the MAC layer.<br>
The formed units of service data and protocol data delivered from the higher layer<br>
are stored in an RLC buffer of the RLC layer. The RLC services are used by service-<br>
specific protocol layers on the user plane, namely a broadcast/multicast control (BMC)<br>
protocol and a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP), and are used by a radio<br>
resource control (RRC) layer for signaling transport on the control plane.<br>
The broadcast/multicast control (BMC) layer schedules a cell broadcast (CB)<br>
message delivered from the core network 200 and enables the cell broadcast message<br>
to be broadcast to the corresponding UEs 10 in the appropriate cell. Header information,<br>
such as a message identification, a serial number, and a coding scheme, is<br>
added to the cell broadcast message to generate a broadcast/multicast control message<br>
for delivery to the RLC layer.<br>
The RLC layer appends RLC header information and transmits the thus-formed<br>
message to the MAC layer via a common traffic channel (CTCH) as a logical channel.<br>
The MAC layer maps the CTCH to a forward access channel (FACH) as a transport<br>
channel. The transport channel is mapped to a secondary common control physical<br>
channel (SCCPCH) as a physical channel.<br>
The packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer serves to transfer data efficiently<br>
over a radio interface having a relatively small bandwidth. The PDCP layer<br>
uses a network protocol such as IPv4 or IPv6 and a header compression technique for<br>
eliminating unnecessary control information utilized in a wire network. The PDCP<br>
layer enhances transmission efficiency since only the information essential to the<br>
header is included in the transfer.<br>
The radio resource control (RRC) layer handles the control plane signaling of the<br>
network layer (L3) between the UEs 10 and the UTRAN 100 and controls the transport<br>
and physical channels for the establishment, reconfiguration, and release of radio<br>
bearers. A radio bearer (RB) is a service provided by a lower layer, such as the RLC<br>
layer or the MAC layer, for data transfer between the UE 10 and the UTRAN 100.<br>
Establishment of an RB determines the regulating characteristics of the protocol<br>
layer and channel needed to provide a specific service, thereby establishing the<br>
parameters and operational methods of the service. When a connection is established to<br>
allow transmission between an RRC layer of a specific UE 10 and an RRC layer of the<br>
UTRAN 100, the UE 10 is said to be in the RRC-connected state. Without such<br>
connection, the UE 10 is in an idle state.<br>
For reference, the RLC layer can be included in the user plane or the control plane<br>
according to a layer connected above it. For example, when the RLC layer is part of<br>
the control plane, data is received from the RRC layer. In other cases, the RLC layer is<br>
part of the user plane.<br>
A particular radio bearer used for exchanging an RRC message or an NAS message<br>
between a terminal and the UTRAN 100 is referred to as a signaling radio bearer<br>
(SRB). When the SRB is set up between a particular terminal and the UTRAN 100,<br>
there can exist an RRC connection between the terminal and the UTRAN 100. The<br>
terminal which forms the RRC connection is said to be in the RRC connected mode (or<br>
state), and the terminal which does not form the RRC connection is said to be in the<br>
idle mode (or state). If the terminal is in the RRC connected mode, the RNC checks<br>
and manages a location of the corresponding terminal according to a cell unit. When<br>
the terminal gets into the RRC connected mode, the RNC sends a signaling message to<br>
the UTRAN 100. The terminal in the RRC connected mode may be further divided<br>
into a CELL_DCH mode, a CELL_PCH mode, a URA_PCH mode and a<br>
CELL_FACH mode.<br>
For those UEs in the idle state, URA_PCH mode, or CELLJPCH mode, a dis-<br>
continuous reception (DRX) method is employed to minimize power consumption. In<br>
the DRX method, a Secondary Common Control Physical Channel (SCCPCH), onto<br>
which a Paging Indicator Channel (PICH) and a Paging Channel (PCH) is mapped, is<br>
discontinuously received by the UE 10. During the time periods when the PICH or the<br>
SCCPCH is not received, the UE is in a sleep mode state. The UE wakes up at every<br>
DRX cycle length (discontinuous receiving period length) to receive a paging indicator<br>
(PI) of the PICH.<br>
The terminal in the RRC connected mode may additionally form a signaling<br>
connection with the core network 200. This signaling connection refers to a path for<br>
exchanging a control message between the terminal and the core network 200. The<br>
RRC connected mode refers to a connection between the terminal and the UTRAN<br>
100. Accordingly, the terminal informs the core network 200 of its location or requests<br>
a particular service using the signaling connection. To obtain the signaling connection,<br>
he terminal should be in the RRC connected mode.<br>
Hereafter, Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS or MBMS service)<br>
will be described. MBMS refers to a method of providing streaming or background<br>
services to a plurality of UEs 10 using a downlink-dedicated MBMS radio bearer. The<br>
MBMS radio bearer may utilize both point-to-multipoint and point-to-point radio<br>
bearer services.<br>
As the name implies, an MBMS may be carried out in a broadcast mode or a<br>
multicast mode. The broadcast mode is transmitting multimedia data to all UEs within<br>
a broadcast area, for example the domain where the broadcast area is available. The<br>
multicast mode is for transmitting multimedia data to a specific UE group within a<br>
multicast area, for example the domain where the multicast service is available.<br>
Figure 3 is a diagram showing procedures of the MBMS service in the multicast<br>
mode. Here, the UMTS network is shown providing a specific MBMS service (a first<br>
service) using the multicast mode. A terminal (UE1) is also shown receiving the<br>
specific service (the first service).<br>
When the UMTS network 1 provides a specific MBMS using the multicast mode,<br>
UEs 10 to be provided with the service must first complete a subscription procedure<br>
establishing a relationship between a service provider and each UE individually.<br>
Thereafter, the subscriber UE 10 receives a service announcement from the core<br>
network 200 confirming subscription and including, for example, a list of services to<br>
be provided.<br>
The subscriber UE 10 must join,' or participate in, a multicast group of UEs<br>
receiving the specific MBMS, thereby notifying the core network 200 of its intention<br>
to receive the service. Terminating participation in the service is called 'leaving.' The<br>
subscription, joining, and leaving operations may be performed by each UE 10 at any<br>
time prior to, during, or after the data transfer.<br>
While a specific MBMS is in progress, on or more service sessions may se-<br>
quentially take place, and the core network 200 informs the RNC 111 of a session start<br>
when data is generated by an MBMS data source and informs the RNC of a session<br>
stop when the data transfer is aborted. Therefore, a data transfer for the specific<br>
MBMS may be performed for the time between the session start and the session stop,<br>
during which time only participating UEs 10 can receive the data.<br>
To achieve successful data transfer, the UTRAN 100 receives a notification of the<br>
session start from the core network 200 and transmits an MBMS notification to the<br>
participating UEs 10 in a prescribed cell to indicate that the data transfer is imminent.<br>
The UTRAN 100 uses the MBMS notification to count the number of participating<br>
UEs 10 within the prescribed cell. Specifically, the UTRAN 100 can perform a<br>
function which counts the number of terminals which expect to receive the specific<br>
MBMS service within a specific cell.<br>
Through the counting process, it is determined whether the radio bearer providing<br>
the specific MBMS service is one for a point-to-multipoint transmission or a point-<br>
to-point transmission, or if the radio bearer is not to be set. To select the MBMS radio<br>
bearer (RB) for a specific service, the UTRAN 100 sets a threshold value cor-<br>
responding to the UE 10 count, whereby a low UE count establishes a point-to-point<br>
MBMS radio bearer and a high UE count establishes a point-to-multipoint MBMS<br>
radio bearer.<br>
The radio bearer established is based on whether the participating UEs 10 need to<br>
be in the RRC-connectcd state. When a point-to-point RB is established, all of the participating<br>
UEs 10 which expect to receive the service are in the RRC connected state.<br>
When a point-to-multipoint RB is established, it is unnecessary for all of the par-<br>
ticipating UEs 10 which expect to receive the service to be in the RRC connected<br>
mode since the point-to-multipoint RB enables reception by UEs in the idle state.<br>
Furthermore, based on the counted result, if no terminal wishes to receive the specific<br>
MBMS service, the UTRAN 100 does not establish any radio bearer and the MBMS<br>
service data is not transmitted. Thus, radio resources may be wasted by establishing the<br>
radio bearer even though no terminal desires the service. Also, the UTRAN 100<br>
transmits the MBMS service data received from the core network 200 during one<br>
session of the MBMS service using the established radio bearer.<br>
In the counting process, the UTRAN 100 has no information on terminals in the<br>
RRC idle state. Therefore, if the UTRAN 100 requests a counting of terminals in the<br>
RRC idle state, subscribed to a specific MBMS service, the terminals should form the<br>
RRC connection with the UTRAN 100 and inform the UTRAN 100 that they would<br>
receive the specific MBMS service.<br>
However, if a terminal has formed a signaling connection with a Serving GPRS<br>
Support Node (SGSN), the SGSN informs the UTRAN 100 of MBMS related in-<br>
formation of the terminal. The information includes a list of MBMS services the<br>
terminal has subscribed to. Therefore, because the UTRAN 100 can recognize whether<br>
terminals have subscribed to a specific MBMS service, the terminals do not respond to<br>
the counting request of the UTRAN 100. Furthermore, terminals which have not<br>
formed a signaling connection with the SGSN, but are in the RRC connected state, can<br>
inform the UTRAN 100 of the MBMS services they have subscribed to when forming<br>
the RRC connection with the UTRAN 100. Accordingly, the UTRAN 100 can count<br>
the number of terminals desiring to receive the specific MBMS service without any<br>
response sent by the terminals in the RRC connected state.<br>
The UTRAN 100 can perform the counting process not only at the beginning of the<br>
MBMS service but also in the middle of one session of the MBMS service. This is<br>
necessary since the number of terminals expecting to receive the MBMS service in a<br>
cell is variable because of events such as a terminal moving to another cell during the<br>
MBMS session in process, turning off power, or stopping the subscription of the<br>
MBMS service. Accordingly, in order to establish the radio bearer efficiently, the<br>
UTRAN 100 can perform the counting process during the MBMS session in process.<br>
However, in this counting process, the following problems may occur when<br>
counting the number of terminals desiring to receive the MBMS service and es-<br>
tablishing the radio bearer. A terminal is able to get information related to several<br>
MBMS services through the MBMS service announcement so that it may subscribe to<br>
a plurality of MBMS services. If the terminal stays in the RRC connected state, the<br>
UTRAN 100 can recognize all the MBMS services the terminal has subscribed to.<br>
Thus, when the UTRAN 100 performs the counting process for a certain MBMS<br>
service, a terminal in the RRC connected state and subscribed to the corresponding<br>
MBMS service, is added in the number of terminals desiring the MBMS service to be<br>
provided.<br>
When the terminal simultaneously receives services it has subscribed to, an event<br>
may occur when several services among the subscribed services may not be received<br>
due to the terminal's limited capability. For example, a terminal having subscribed to<br>
two MBMS services has one SCCPCH through which the MBMS services can be<br>
received. If each MBMS service is transmitted through different SCCPCHs, re-<br>
spectively, using the point-to-multipoint RB in a cell, the terminal can receive only one<br>
of the subscribed MBMS services due to its limited capability. However, the UTRAN<br>
100 is unable to recognize that the terminal can not receive one of the MBMS services.<br>
As a result, the UTRAN 100 performs the counting process and wrongfully considers<br>
the terminal as receiving all two MBMS services it has subscribed to. The UTRAN<br>
100 then establishes a radio bearer based on this information.<br>
The error occurring during the counting process causes radio resources to be<br>
wasted. As a further example, it is assumed that six terminals are in a cell, and all six<br>
terminals have subscribed to an MBMS service A and an MBMS service B. Moreover,<br>
all six terminals are in the RRC connected state and can receive services through one<br>
SCCPCH. It is also assumed that a threshold value for establishing a point-<br>
to-multipoint RB is set at 3. The MBMS service A is being transmitted through the<br>
point-to-multipoint RB in a cell and the UTRAN 100 has received a session start no-<br>
tification for the MBMS service B from the core network 200. In this case, the<br>
UTRAN 100 may determine there are six terminals which expect to receive the MBMS<br>
service B and thus establish the point-to-multipoint RB.<br>
However, if an SCCPCH different from an SCCPCH used for transmitting the<br>
MBMS service A is used for transmitting the MBMS service B, then the six terminals<br>
may receive only one of the MBMS services A and B due to the their limited ca-<br>
pabilities. Thus, either the MBMS service A or the MBMS service B is received<br>
according to a user's selection. A situation may occur where five terminals determine<br>
to receive the MBMS service A and one terminal determines to receive the MBMS<br>
service B. Accordingly, since there is only one terminal desiring to receive the MBMS<br>
service B, the UTRAN 100 should establish the point-to-point RB because the number<br>
terminals desiring the MBMS service B is below the threshold value of 3. However,<br>
the related art UTRAN 100 establishes the point-to-multipoint RB with respect to the<br>
MBMS service B because it wrongfully counts all six terminals for receiving the<br>
service B. The error occurs because the UTRAN 100 has no information regarding the<br>
capabilities of the terminals, service selection of the user, or the like. Unfortunately,<br>
the resources required for establishing the point-to-multipoint RB corresponds to<br>
several times that of the point-to-point RB. As a result, due to the error occurring<br>
during the counting process in the related art, radio resources are wasted and the<br>
number of services to be simultaneously provided in one cell is limited.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
The present invention relates to a method and system for transmitting and receiving<br>
a service in a wireless communication system.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the de-<br>
scription which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be<br>
learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the<br>
invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the<br>
written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the<br>
present invention, as embodied and broadly described, the present invention is<br>
embodied in a method and a system. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a<br>
method for receiving a service in a mobile terminal from a network in a wireless com-<br>
munication system comprises establishing a first radio bearer and receiving a service<br>
associated with the first radio bearer, receiving second radio bearer setup information<br>
from the network to establish a second radio bearer for receiving a service associated<br>
with the second radio bearer, prioritizing between the service associated with the first<br>
radio bearer and the service associated with the second radio bearer, determining<br>
whether the mobile terminal is able to receive a higher prioritized service if the second<br>
radio bearer is established, and retaining the higher prioritized service.<br>
The mobile terminal is in an RRC connected mode. The first radio bearer is a<br>
point-to-multipoint radio bearer and the second radio bearer is a point-to-point radio<br>
bearer. Alternatively, the first radio bearer is a point-to-point radio bearer and the<br>
second radio bearer is a point-to-multipoint radio bearer.<br>
In a detailed aspect, retaining the higher prioritized service comprises rejecting the<br>
establishment of the second radio bearer. In another aspect, retaining the higher<br>
prioritized service comprises requesting release of a lower prioritized service to the<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment of the invention, a radio system comprises a<br>
cell for providing a plurality of MBMS services, the cell including a mobile terminal or<br>
UE 10 and a UTRAN 100. The terminal 10 is capable of subscribing to a plurality of<br>
MBMS services and may transmit data to the UTRAN 100. Preferably, the data which<br>
the terminal 10 transmits comprises information regarding the MBMS services the<br>
terminal is receiving or expects to receive. The UTRAN 100 manages radio resources<br>
based on the information received from the terminal 10.<br>
Particularly, the terminal 10 transmits data to the UTRAN 100 according to the<br>
following situation. The terminal 10, currently receiving specific MBMS services,<br>
receives an MBMS notification message from the UTRAN 100 with respect to another<br>
MBMS service theterminal 10 has subscribed to. After receiving radio bearer establishment<br>
information for the other MBMS service, the terminal 10 compares the information<br>
received with its own receiving capability. When the terminal 10 determines<br>
that it cannot receive all the MBMS services it has subscribed to that a cell transmits,<br>
the terminal 10 informs the UTRAN 100 of the MBMS services it expects to receive<br>
among all the services it has subscribed to.<br>
Moreover, the terminal 10 may also transmit data to the UTRAN 100 according to<br>
the following situation. While the terminal 10 is receiving specific MBMS services in<br>
an RRC connected state, radio bearer establishment information for any of the MBMS<br>
services the terminal 10 is receiving may change. The terminal 10 then compares the<br>
changed radio bearer establishment information with its receiving capability. When the<br>
terminal 10 determines that it cannot receive all the MBMS services it has subscribed<br>
to that a cell transmits, the terminal 10 informs the UTRAN 100 of the MBMS services<br>
it expects to receive among all the services it has subscribed to.<br>
The terminal 10 further transmits data to the UTRAN 100 according to the<br>
following situation. While the terminal 10 is in the RRC connected state, the terminal<br>
may selectively receive MBMS services it has subscribed to according to its receiving<br>
capability. Changes in received MBMS services can result from a user selectively<br>
receiving services according to his or her preference. When a change occurs according<br>
to the user's selection, the terminal 10 informs the UTRAN 100 of the MBMS services<br>
it expects to receive among all the services it has subscribed to.<br>
MBMS-related information the terminal 10 transmits to the UTRAN 100 may<br>
include an MBMS service identifier. The service identifier informs the UTRAN 100 of<br>
which service each terminal 10 expects to receive. The terminal 10 can further inform<br>
the UTRAN 100 of its MBMS service receiving capability as well as information<br>
regarding a combination of MBMS services the terminal 10 can receive in each RRC<br>
state. For example, if the terminal is in a CELL_DCH state, the terminal 10 informs the<br>
UTRAN 100 whether MBMS services transmitted through a point-to-multipoint radio<br>
bearer (RB) can be received. If the terminal is in a CELL_FACH state, the terminal 10<br>
informs the UTRAN 100 of the number of different SCCPCHs provided through which<br>
simultaneously transmitted MBMS services may be received. The UTRAN 100 uses<br>
the information to check which subscribed MBMS services are received or not<br>
received by the terminal 10, if the services are transmitted in a cell.<br>
The UTRAN 100 performs a counting process for each MBMS service transmitted<br>
from a cell based on the MBMS-related information received from the terminal 10.<br>
When data is transmitted from the terminal 10 to the UTRAN 100, the UTRAN 100<br>
receives MBMS service reception information from the terminal 10 in the RRC<br>
connected state. If the MBMS service which the terminal 10 has subscribed to, and<br>
which the cell is transmitting or is going to transmit, is not included among the MBMS<br>
service reception information transmitted by the terminal 10, the UTRAN 100 excludes<br>
the terminal 10 from the number of terminals, or a list of terminals, which desire to<br>
receive the MBMS service. The UTRAN 100 then updates the number of terminals<br>
which desire to receive the MBMS service and compares the number with a threshold<br>
value. If required, the UTRAN 100 re-establishes a radio bearer for the MBMS service.<br>
The UTRAN 100 can further manage a terminal 10, wherein the terminal is in the<br>
RRC connected state and subscribed to a specific MBMS service but cannot receive<br>
the specific service. In this case, the UTRAN 100 manages the terminal using a list<br>
comprising of terminals which cannot receive or do not want to receive the MBMS<br>
service.<br>
In accordance with a second embodiment of the invention, a radio system<br>
comprises a cell for providing a plurality of MBMS services, the cell including a<br>
mobile terminal or UE 10 and a UTRAN 100. The terminal 10 is capable of<br>
subscribing to a plurality of MBMS services and may transmit data to the UTRAN<br>
100. Preferably, the data which the terminal 10 transmits comprises information<br>
regarding the MBMS services the terminal cannot receive or does not want to receive.<br>
The UTRAN 100 manages radio resources based on the information received from the<br>
terminal 10.<br>
In contrast to the first embodiment, the terminal 10 does not inform the UTRAN<br>
100 of an MBMS service the terminal is able to receive or is going to receive among<br>
the MBMS services subscribed to by the terminal and transmitted from the cell.<br>
Rather, the terminal 10 informs the UTRAN 100 of MBMS services the terminal 10<br>
cannot receive or will not receive among the MBMS services subscribed to by the<br>
terminal and transmitted by the cell. In this method, the UTRAN 100 is directly<br>
informed of the list of MBMS services not received by the terminal 10 when<br>
performing the counting process.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, an operation between the terminal 10 and the UTRAN 100 in<br>
accordance with the first and second embodiments is shown. A session for an MBMS<br>
service A is in progress in a cell. During the session for the MBMS service A, the<br>
UTRAN 100 transmits MBMS service data to the terminal 10. The terminal 10<br>
according to the first and second embodiment receives the MBMS service A in an<br>
RRC connected state. The terminal 10 is also subscribed to an MBMS service B.<br>
When a session start message for the MBMS service B arrives from the core<br>
network 200 (S10), the UTRAN 100 performs a counting process for the MBMS<br>
service B (S20). Based on the result of the counting process, the UTRAN 100 informs<br>
the terminal 10 of radio bearer establishment information with respect to the MBMS<br>
service B (S30).<br>
The terminal 10, which has subscribed to both the MBMS service A and the<br>
MBMS service B, determines whether it can receive both the MBMS service A and the<br>
MBMS service B based on the radio bearer establishment information of each MBMS<br>
service and the terminal's receiving capability. If there is a service which the terminal<br>
can not receive among the subscribed services, the terminal 10 determines which of the<br>
MBMS services to receive (S40). The terminal then informs the UTRAN 100 of a list<br>
of MBMS services the terminal expects to receive (S50) based on the determination<br>
made in step S40. Alternatively, the terminal 10 may inform the UTRAN 100 of a list<br>
of MBMS services the terminal 10 cannot receive. The terminal 10 can further inform<br>
the UTRAN 100 of both lists.<br>
In the case where an MBMS service is subscribed to by the terminal 10 but can not<br>
receive it, the UTRAN 100 performs the counting process based on the information<br>
received from the terminal 10 (S60). That is, the UTRAN 100 excludes the terminal<br>
from the number of terminals, or a list thereof, which expect to receive the corresponding<br>
MBMS service. The UTRAN 100 then compares the result of the counting<br>
process (S60) for each MBMS service with a threshold value. If required, the UTRAN<br>
100 re-establishes a radio bearer, and thereafter informs the terminal 10 of the changed<br>
information (S70).<br>
In accordance with a third embodiment of the invention, a radio system comprises<br>
a cell for providing a plurality of MBMS services, the cell including a mobile terminal<br>
or UE 10 and a UTRAN 100. The terminal 10 is capable of subscribing to a plurality of<br>
MBMS services and prioritizing between the subscribed MBMS services. Once<br>
priority amongst the services is determined, the terminal 10 transmits the priority information<br>
to the core network (CN) 200. The UTRAN 100 performs a counting<br>
process based on the priority information received from the terminal 10.<br>
When the terminal 10 subscribes to certain MBMS services, the terminal prioritizes<br>
between the subscribed MBMS services and informs the system of the priority information.<br>
The priority information is stored in the CN 200. When the terminal forms a<br>
signaling connection with an SGSN, the UTRAN 100 receives the priority information<br>
from the CN 200. Thereafter, the UTRAN 100 uses the priority information during the<br>
counting process when each MBMS service is started or in progress.<br>
For the terminal 10 in the RRC connected state, the UTRAN 100 can therefore be<br>
informed of the terminal's service receiving capability and the terminal's prioritized<br>
preferences among the MBMS services subscribed to by the terminal. Thus, if a<br>
plurality of services among the subscribed MBMS services are simultaneously in<br>
progress, the UTRAN 100 determines that the terminal 10 will receive the receivable<br>
MBMS services in the order from the highest priority service to the lowest priority<br>
service as determined by the terminal 10. The UTRAN 100 further determines what<br>
MBMS services the terminal will receive according to a limitation in the terminal's<br>
receiving capability.<br>
If the terminal is determined to receive the MBMS service, the UTRAN 100<br>
includes the terminal in the number of terminals desiring to receive the service during<br>
the counting process. After performing the counting process, if required, the UTRAN<br>
100 re-establishes a radio bearer and informs the terminals 10 of the changed information.<br>
In accordance with a fourth embodiment of the invention, a radio system comprises<br>
a cell for providing a plurality of MBMS services, the cell including a mobile terminal<br>
or UE 10 and a UTRAN 100. The terminal 10 is capable of subscribing to a plurality of<br>
MBMS services and prioritizing between the subscribed MBMS services. Once<br>
priority amongst the services is determined, the terminal 10 transmits the priority information<br>
to the UTRAN 100. The UTRAN 100 performs a counting process based on<br>
the priority information received from the terminal 10.<br>
In contrast to the third embodiment, the terminal 10 does not inform the CN 200 of<br>
the priority between the MBMS services the terminal 10 has subscribed to. Rather, the<br>
terminal 10 directly informs the UTRAN 100 when the terminal is in the RRC<br>
connected state. Using this method, unnecessary message exchanges between the<br>
UTRAN 100 and the CN 200 is reduced. Furthermore, the terminal 10 can inform the<br>
UTRAN 100 of its priority information more quickly.<br>
Particularly, when the terminal 10 goes into the RRC connected state, the terminal<br>
10 informs the UTRAN 100 of the priority amongst the MBMS services the terminal<br>
has subscribed to. Also, when the terminal 10 receives an MBMS message for MBMS<br>
services the terminal has subscribed to, the terminal 10 informs the UTRAN 100 of the<br>
priority amongst the MBMS services.<br>
Furthermore, whenever the terminal re-establishes the priority of each MBMS<br>
service in the RRC connected state, the terminal informs the UTRAN 100 of the reestablished<br>
priority information. Thus, in the case where the terminal 10 expects to<br>
receive other MBMS services transmitted from a cell while receiving a certain MBMS<br>
service, the terminal 10 informs the UTRAN 100 of the priority information for each<br>
MBMS service subscribed to so that the UTRAN 100 knows that the terminal 10<br>
expects to receive or is receiving other MBMS services.<br>
When informing the UTRAN 100 of the priority of each MBMS service, the<br>
terminal 10 transmits to the UTRAN 100 an identifier of each service in an arranged<br>
order according to the priority of the service. Alternatively, the terminal 10 may inform<br>
the UTRAN 100 of the priority of each MBMS service by appending a priority value<br>
of each service when transmitting the identifier of each service.<br>
Furthermore, when informing the UTRAN 100 of the priority of each MBMS<br>
service, the terminal 10 may transmit priority information regarding all the services the<br>
terminal has subscribed to or transmit priority information regarding only those<br>
MBMS services which are in the process of being transmitted from a cell and<br>
subscribed to by the terminal.<br>
In accordance with a fifth embodiment of the invention, operations of the terminal<br>
10 and the UTRAN 100 will be explained when a type of radio bearer (RB) having<br>
been established for a particular MBMS service should be changed.<br>
If the UTRAN 100 changes the establishment of an RB having been established for<br>
a particular MBMS service or sends establishment information of a new RB to the<br>
terminal, the terminal 10 checks the establishment information of the new RB received<br>
from the UTRAN 100. Accordingly, a situation may occur where the terminal 10 may<br>
not receive a service it expects to receive because of the changed RB. If so, the<br>
terminal 10, according to the present invention, notifies the UTRAN 100 that it may<br>
not receive the expected service.<br>
Particularly, when the terminal 10 receives a plurality of MBMS services through a<br>
point-to-multipoint RB in an RRC connected state, the terminal may receive a<br>
command from the UTRAN 100 to establish a point-to-point RB with respect to one or<br>
more services among the MBMS services subscribed to by the terminal 10. The<br>
terminal 10 then checks the establishment information of the point-to-point RB. If the<br>
terminal 10 is not able to receive MBMS services having higher priority than those<br>
MBMS services to be received through the point-to-point RB, established by the<br>
command of the UTRAN 100, the terminal 10 informs the UTRAN 100 that it cannot<br>
accept the establishment of the point-to-point RB. The terminal 10 may further inform<br>
the UTRAN 100 which particular services make it impossible to establish the point-<br>
to-point RB.<br>
Furthermore, when the terminal 10 receives a plurality of MBMS services through<br>
a point-to-point RB in an RRC connected state, the terminal may receive a command<br>
from the UTRAN 100 to establish a point-to-multipoint RB with respect to one or<br>
more services among the MBMS services subscribed to by the terminal 10. The<br>
terminal 10 then checks the establishment information of the point-to-multipoint RB. If<br>
the terminal 10 is not able to receive MBMS services having higher priority than those<br>
MBMS services to be received through the point-to-multipoint RB, established by the<br>
command of the UTRAN 100, the terminal 10 informs the UTRAN 100 that it cannot<br>
accept the establishment of the point-to-multipoint RB. The terminal 10 may further<br>
inform the UTRAN 100 which particular services make it impossible to establish the<br>
point-to-multipoint RB.<br>
Moreover, if the UTRAN 100 receives a message that the terminal 10 can not<br>
follow its command to establish an RB for particular MBMS services, the UTRAN 100<br>
re-adjusts whether the terminal 10 should be included in a list of terminals desiring to<br>
receive a particular MBMS service. If required, the UTRAN 100 adjusts the RB to be<br>
established in order for the terminal 10 to receive the MBMS services having higher<br>
priority.<br>
Referring to Figure 5, an operation of the terminal 10 and the UTRAN 100 is<br>
shown when a type of RB having been established for a specific MBMS service is to<br>
be changed during a session. In Figure 5, it is assumed that the terminal receives an<br>
MBMS service A and an MBMS service B. Further, the MBMS service A has a higher<br>
priority than the MBMS service B. It is also assumed that the terminal 10 is in the RRC<br>
connected state.<br>
The UTRAN 100 performs a counting process for the MBMS service B newly<br>
received (SI 10). Then, according to the result of the counting process performed, if the<br>
type of RB having been established for the MBMS service B is determined to be<br>
changed, the UTRAN 100 informs the terminal 10 of the new establishment information<br>
for the RB (S120).<br>
Once receiving the establishment information from the UTRAN 100, the terminal<br>
10 checks the RB establishment information of each MBMS service using the received<br>
information. The terminal then checks whether the MBMS service A having the higher<br>
priority can also be received (S130). If it is determined according to the checked result<br>
that the MBMS service A can not be received, the terminal informs the UTRAN 100<br>
that the MBMS service A can not be received (S140).<br>
As aforementioned, the UTRAN is supported to more precisely count the number<br>
of terminals expecting to receive MBMS services, thereby reducing radio resources<br>
allocated to the terminal and the UTRAN. As a result, terminals receive higher-quality<br>
MBMS services.<br>
