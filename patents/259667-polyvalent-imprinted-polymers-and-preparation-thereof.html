The polyvalent imprinted copolymers provided by the present invention are useful for inhibition of viral infections and the recoveries of biomolecules. The method of synthesis of polyvalent imprinted copolymers is demonstrated in this specification using lysozyme as a biomolecule and N-acetyl glucosamine as a ligand. <br>
Background of the invention<br>
Design of a host specific molecule using molecular imprinting technique has been investigated since long time. Molecular imprinting methodology finds applications in bioseparation, enzyme mimics, chiral separations and antibody mimics. The technique creates selective binding sites in synthetic polymers (Mosbach, K., et al. TIBS, 19, 9-14,1994).<br>
The technique involves the polymerization of functional monomers in the presence of a template molecule. In the past various approaches such as covalent and non covalent interactions have been used to synthesize imprinted polymers (Kempe, M, Mosbach, K., Journal of Chromatography A, 694, 3-13, 1995). The template molecule binds to the active sites on the polymer via non covalent interactions such as ionic, hydrophobic or hydrogen bonding.<br>
Shea : K.J (TRIP, 5, 166-173,1994) described the de novo synthesis of macromolecular binding and catalytic sites. Functional groups on macromolecular chains were bound non covalently to polymerizable ligands which were then copolymerized with excess of cross linkers in the presence of macromolecular template.<br>
Protein carbohydrate interactions are of low affinity. If relative density and spatial arrangement of ligands incorporated is optimized, then the binding between the substrates and the ligand can be substantially enhanced. The enhanced interactions are also desirable in affinity separations, drug delivery and biotechnology.<br>
Design of high affinity protein carbohydrate binding systems can provide an alternative strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases e.g. influenza and rotavirus. This has the advantage ; as such agents will not result in pathogen resistance to antibiotics and drugs. A new approach to treat influenza is based on the principle of inhibition of virus binding on to the host cells. The inhibitors like sialic acid anchored to polymeric or liposomal carriers have been reported in the past.<br>
Since monovalent interactions of natural oligosaccharides are weak, they need to be used in large quantities for an effective treatment. To overcome this problem polyvalent carbohydrate molecules can be synthesized (Zopf, D., Roth, S. Lancet 347, 1017, 1996). The concept of using polyvalent carbohydrate moieties is attractive since it provides a non-toxic therapeutic molecule to a wide range of human diseases. But synthesis of such compounds is critical and requires knowledge of the host-cell binding mechanism. So far molecular imprinting - technique has been exploited for chiral separation This involves interactions of polymerizable functional monomers around an imprinted molecule. Template molecule is then leached which leaves functional groups in the polymers at sites complementary to the template used during the synthesis. Shi H.; Tsai W.B.; Garrison M.D.; Ferrari S.; Ratner, B.D. (Nature, 398: 6728, 593-597,1999) reported template-imprinted nanostructured surfaces for protein recognition. The investigators used radio-frequency glow-discharge plasma deposition to form polymeric thin films around proteins coated with disaccharide molecules. The disaccharides become covalently attached to the polymer film, creating polysaccharide-like environment around the template that exhibits highly selective recognition for the templated proteins, including albumin, immunoglobulin G, lysozyme, ribonuclease and "streptavidin. Direct imaging of template recognition is achieved by patterning a surface at the micrometer scale with imprinted regions.<br>
Molecularly imprinted polymers can be used as a specialty substrates for the separation of various biomolecules. The patent granted to our group (Vaidya; A. A,; Lele; B.<br>
S.; Kulkarni; M.G; Mashelkar,R.A, United States Patent, 6,379,599, 2002) describes the process for preparation of molecularly .imprinted .polymers useful for separation of enzymes. The invention describes polymerization of complex comprising enzyme and affinity monomer, a comonomer and a crosslinker. The molecularly imprinted polymers synthesized in the presence of biomolecules as templates impart the advantages of higher affinity and selectivity. Imprinted polymers in general display good recognition properties and are usually prepared in non-polar organic solvents such as chloroform or toluene. Biological recognition mainly occurs in hydrophilic environment and therefore it is important to synthesize MIPs containing ligands capable of interactions with a receptor molecule in the aqueous medium. However, preparation of imprinted polymers in aqueous system has proven to be a difficult task, since the water molecule can destroy the hydrogen-bonding interactions between functional monomer and the template molecule. Moreover, commonly used cross-linkers do not dissolve in water.<br>
Takeuchia,, T.; Kugimiyaa A.; and Matsuia, J. ( Materials Science and Engineering: C, 4: 4, 263-266, 1997) reported sialic acid-imprinted polymers using noncovalent interactions.<br>
Mosbach, Klaus; Mayes; Andrew G. (United States Patent, 5,959,050, 1999) reported molecularly imprinted polymer supports and their preparation via suspension polymerization. The suspension techniques according to the said invention provide molecularly imprinted polymers using a perfluorocarbon liquid containing polyoxyethylene ester groups as the dispersing phase. Most of the methods reported in the past utilize organic solvents for molecular imprinting.<br>
Biomolecules such as enzymes and proteins are thermolabile and may undergo structural changes under the experimental conditions used for polymerization in the presence of these templates and lose their biological activity. Moreover choice of suchbiomolecules as templates in organic solvents may alter their conformation and lead to loss of specificity. Thus there is a necessity to synthesize imprinted polymers in which biomolecules will be solvent compatible; stable and hence can find wide range of applications such as biomolecular recoveries and medicine.<br>
Site-specific interactions of ligand and the receptor are useful in immunoassays and biomolecule separations. The interacting molecules can be proteins or peptides, antibodies, enzymes, polysaccharides or glycoproteins that specifically bind to other substrate receptors in the suitable environment. A ligand so bound can be displaced . from the binding site by altering environmental conditions.<br>
Recent advancements in the field of glycoscience have demonstrated enhanced binding between carbohydrate ligands and specific receptors as a result of the polyvalency or cluster effect. Moreover, polyvalent materials also contribute to steric stabilization.<br>
Literature highlights the advantages of polyvalent interactions and their application in medicine and biotechnology. The sialic acid moieties can be linked to polymer for the treatment of rotavirus (Mandeville, III, et al., United States Patent 6,187,762, 2001).<br>
These moieties can inhibit or prevent rotavirus infection in mammals and humans.<br>
Mammen, et al., (J. Med. Chem., 38, 4179-4190,1995) reported polyacrylamides bearing pendent alpha sialoside groups as efficient inhibitors in agglutination of erythrocytes by influenza virus, suggesting the role of polyvalency. The affinity of the polyvalent inhibitor towards the surface of the virus is greatly enhanced compared to the monovalent sialic acid inhibitor. In addition high molecular weight polymers containing ligands inhibit binding between the virus and its receptor through steric exclusion.<br>
Using controlled chemical synthesis methods such as molecular imprinting, it would be possible to control the spacing, steric accessibility, number of ligand molecules in the polymer. Moreover, molecular weight, density, solubility and physical structure of the imprinted polymeric conjugates can be manipulated as desired.<br>
The synthesis of polyvalent copolymers by molecular imprinting technique can thus lead to unique advantages in various applications such as immunoassay, biomolecular recoveries and enhanced interactions.<br>
(Formula  4 Removed)<br>
Chitosan (Formula 4) is a linear, binary heteropolysaccharide consisting of 2-acetaamido-2-deoxy-ß-D-glucose (GlcNAc;A-unit) and 2-amino-2-deoxy- -D-glucose (GlcNAc, D-unit). The active site of lysozyme comprises subsites A-F. Specific binding of chitosan sequences to lysozyme begins with binding of the NAG units in the subsite C. But, natural ligands derived from glucose are susceptible to microbial growth. Hence, there is a need to synthesize ligands similar to repeat units of chitosan, which will not be hydrolyzed by lysozyme. The polymers containing polyvalent NAG prepared using the imprinting technique reported here are expected to be more stable than chitin and chitosan.<br>
Apart from the interacting ligand, its distribution in the polymer chain also plays a crucial role in influencing the efficiency of the inhibition. The synthesis of polymers bearing tailored molecular structure prepared by molecular imprinting could be the most effective method for enhancing substrate ligand interactions.<br>
Synthesis of polyvalent carbohydrate ligands by the polymerization of the corresponding monovalent ligands in the presence of biomolecules comprising multiple binding sites, so as to enhance the binding between the polyvalent ligand and the imprint molecule in a subsequent stage has not been reported in the past to our knowledge. The imprinting methodology leads to enhanced interactions between the polyvalent ligands and the substrate than the polyvalent ligands containing identical moles of ligand synthesized in the absence of the template.<br>
Many approaches have been reported in the past for controlled synthesis of amphiphilic block copolymers bearing pendent N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine residues by living cationic polymerization. The interaction of the diblock copolymers with lectins was reported by Yamada et al. (Macromolecules, 32,3553-3558,1999). This methodology of synthesizing homopolymers and the block copolymers containing N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine residues demonstrates significant increase in binding affinity for lectin. The applicability of the method is however limited by the need for very low temperature al}d stringent polymerization conditions Further the experimental conditions preclude the use of a protein molecule as a template during synthesis.<br>
In our copending applications [Oligomers and Preparation Thereof - Application No. .<br>
	   and   Macromer   and   preparation   thereof,   Application   No	<br>
	] we have claimed oligomers of NAG in which the NAG groups juxtaposed to one<br>
another, bind more effectively to lysozyme as reflected in values of binding constant (Kt,) and the inhibition concentrations (I50).<br>
In the conventional technique of free radical copolymerization the distribution of monomers along the polymer chain depends upon the values of the monomer reactivity ratios, which are determined primarily by the intrinsic structure of the monomer. Consequently the distribution of the NAG units in the copolymers comprising monomers bearing NAG cannot be tailored at will using conventional copolymerization techniques.<br>
To overcome this problem we have devised a macromer synthesis method to ensure<br>
that the copolymers prepared using conventional free radical polymerization technique will<br>
always contain sequences of NAG units in juxtaposition. (Our co pending application<br>

Objects of the invention Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides polyvalent polymers containing NAG macromer in the presence of a biomolecule and method of preparation thereof.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of polyvalent copolymers useful for separation of enzymes. Imprinted polymers contain polyvalent carbohydrate ligands for biomolecular target. These copolymers exhibit selective binding to the target enzyme/ protein. The present invention also provides a method for obtaining affinity ligand useful for isolating target biomolecule from a solution more efficiently. Detailed description of the invention<br>
It is therefore advantageous to prepare polyvalent imprinted copolymers, which comprise covalently linked carbohydrate ligands such as NAG for enhanced binding with the receptor.<br>
The efficiency of binding can be quantified in various terms of binding constants (Kb) and the relative inhibition (I50).<br>
Polymers comprising imprinted polyvalent ligands may further be used in the treatment of bacterial or viral infections for enhanced efficiency and are expected not to cause drug resistance.<br>
Monomers containing NAG may be used for copolymerization or oligomerization and exhibit enhanced hydrolytic stability and water solubility than natural polymers containing NAG such as chitosan. They may be also used as anti-infective agents both for the prevention and treatment of diseases, recovery of the naturally occurring as well as genetically manipulated biomolecules.<br>
The molecular imprinting approach described for obtaining polyvalent ligand is a generic one and can be extended to other systems as well. For example sialic acid ligands are known to bind to influenza virus and rotavirus. Hence polymers comprising multiple sialic acid moieties will bind to viruses more strongly than the corresponding monomers.<br>
The approach described to prepare imprinted copolymers containing polyvalent NAG is simple and can be used to synthesize other ligands such as sialic acid which bind to influenza virus and rotavirus. Such polyvalent imprinted copolymers may be even used as anti infective agents both for prevention and treatment of diseases. Moreover, polyvalent imprinted copolymers reported here are thermoprecipitating copolymers which may be used for the recovery of biomolecules such as lysozyme and lectins.<br>
The present invention provides a method for the preparation of polyvalent imprinted<br>
polymers demonstrated in the specification using lysozyme as a biomolecule and N-Acetyl Glucosarnine as the ligand. Polyvalent imprinted copolymers exhibit enhanced interactions in terms of binding and inhibition of lysozyme as compared to non imprinted polymers containing NAG. The enhanced efficacy results from the tailored arrangement of the interacting ligand for the receptive sites of the biomolecules.<br>
The present invention describes polyvalent imprinted polymers that exhibit stronger binding to the template vis a vis polyvalent polymers of identical composition prepared in the absence of the corresponding template.<br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
This example describes estimation of binding constant (Kb) of polyvalent copolymers comprising N- Acetyl Glucosamine and polyvalent copolymers alone by fluorescence spectrophotometric method. Fluorescence spectra of lysozyme were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS-50 B luminescence spectrophotometer. Excitation frequency was 285 nm. Solutions of lysozyme and imprinted polyvalent copolymers containing N-Acetyl Glucosamine were prepared in 0.066 M phosphate buffer pH 6.2, containing 0.0154 M sodium chloride and 0.008 M sodium azide. 0.1 milliliter of lysozyme solution (80 ug/ml) was mixed with solution containing different ligand concentration in a 2 ml capacity 10 mm square quartz cells maintained at 18 0 C. Phosphate buffer was added to make the volume to 2 ml. The fluorescence intensities of the solutions were measured relative to the solutions containing enzymes and buffer- mixtures of the identical concentrations as reference. The relative fluorescence intensity of lysozyme saturated with solution containing different ligand concentration, Foe, was extrapolated from the experimental values by plotting 1/ (Fo-F) against I/[S] 'where F is the measured fluorescence of a solution containing enzyme with given substrate concentration [S] and Fo is the fluorescence of a solution containing enzyme alone (Chipman et al., J. Biol. Chem., 242-19, 4388-4394,1967). The highest concentration of<br><br>
polymer substrate used was such that enzyme was saturated more than 85 %.<br>

EXAMPLE 5<br>
This example describes estimation of inhibition concentration (I 50) for lysozyme imprinted polyvalent copolYmers and polyvalent copolymers prepared in the absence of lysozyme by UV spectrophotometric method<br>
Micrococcm lysodeikticus is a substrate for the enzyme lysozyme. Relative binding of copolYmers was estimated by using a procedure reported by Neuberger and Wilson (1967). 1.5 % w/v stock solutions of non imprinted copolymer was prepared in 0.0066 M phosphate buffer pH 6.2 containing 0.0154 M sodium chloride and 0.008 M sodium azide. One milliliter of stock solution containing different copolymer concentration was mixed with 1.6 ml of 78 μg/ml of Micrococcus lysodeikticus in a 3-ml capacity glass cuvette. The mixture was incubated for 5 minutes at 20° C. To this mixture 0.1 ml of lysozyme (27 μg/ml) was added and mixed thoroughly. The relative absorbance at 450 nm (Δ 450) was recorded for 30 seconds. A blank reading without the copolymer was noted and the change in the absorbance per second was calculated. Then relative inhibition was calculated.<br>

The I 50 value for the polyvalent copolymer comprising 33 mole % NAG was 1.33 x 10"' nM. But a polymer containing 30 mole % NAG prepared using the molecular imprinting technique exhibited the I 50 value 6.00 x 10 "2 nM. Thus the polymer prepared using the molecular imprinting technique was more effective in inhibiting lysozyme activity (Table 4).

The advantages of the present invention are as follows:<br>
1.	The polyvalent polymers reported here comprise polyvalent ligands prepared by<br>
imprinting in the presence of lysozyme and therefore exhibit enhanced interactions.<br>
2.	Polyvalent imprinted polymers have appropriate molecular weight and demonstrate<br>
greater efficiency in terms of enhaned binding and lower inhibition concentration for<br>
lysozyme.<br>
3.	The polyvalent imprinted polymers have greater water solubility, stability, and<br>
susceptibility to enzyme from hydrolysis.<br>

distribution in the polyvalent imprinted polymers with enzyme receptors.<br>
5.	The method of preparation of polyvalent imprinted polymers containing polyvalent<br>
NAG is simpler than the methods reported in the past since imprinting is carried out at<br>
lower temperatures in aqueous medium so that biomolecule retains its activity during<br>
imprinting.<br>
6.	The polyvalent imprinted polymers containing polyvalent NAG are effective even at<br>
low ligand concentration than the polymers synthesized in the absence of a template.<br>
7.	The polyvalent imprinted polymers form theromosensitive copolymers and can be<br>
used for recovery of the biomolecules.<br>
8.	The polyvalent imprinted polymers bind simultaneously to multiple binding sites of<br>
biomolecules thereby exhibiting enhanced interactions.<br><br><br>
