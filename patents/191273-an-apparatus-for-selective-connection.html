				<td>The invention concerns with an apparatus for selective connector an installation for connecting any one of a plurality of input pipes to any one of a plurality of output pipes. It is particularly, but not exclusively, directed to the circulation of petroleum products.<br>
In most petrochemical installations it is necessary to make many temporary connections in order to transfer products of different kinds in the same pipes. To this end it is necessary to be able to connect any one of a plurality of input lines to any one of a plurality of output lines, the numbers of input and output lines possibly being large, for example in the order of 20 or even more.<br>
These multiple connections are unavoidable in the case of installations which can be cleaned by scraping (i.e. in which the internal cross-section of the fluid passage is the same<br>
everywhere).<br>
There are various existing solutions to the problem of making these connections.<br>
The first is to use flexible connections (hoses).<br>
There are other solutions, usually automated, which use telescopic connections, which can cause problems with cleaning by scraping.<br>
The Applicant has already proposed the following solutions:<br>
connections with double articulated joints in two perpendicular planes (see patent application 90-03050 of 9 March, 1990),<br>
connections with multiple tubular members mobile in two stacked planes in the manner of abacus members and joined by a double elbow (see patent application FR-A-2 680 559 of 21 August 1991).<br>
These automated solutions have the drawback of being relatively costly and are therefore ruled out in some projects for budgetary reasons.<br>
It   is   therefore   necessary   to   propose   economical, possibly  manual  solutions  to  the  problem  of  making  multiple connections     (multiple    input    lines    connected    to    multiple output   lines)   in  a  way  that  enables  cleaning  by  scraping.<br>
These solutions must use rigid members which can be manoeuvred without major physical effort and which can be  cleaned  by  scraping.<br>
It must be possible to connect simultaneously all<br>
the input lines (or all the output lines if they are fewer<br>
in number) , in any order, and without having to disconnect<br>
any  line(s)   already, in  service.	<br>
To this end the invention proposes an installation for provisional selective connection of any one of an ordered plurality of first fixed sections all having the same inside diameter to any one of an ordered plurality of second fixed sections all having the same inside  diameter  as  the  first   fixed  sections,   including:<br>
a vertical first support to which the plurality of   fixed  sections   is  fixed,   each  at  a  specific  level.<br>

a support to which the ordered plurality of second   fixed  sections   is   fixed,<br>
an ordered plurality of seccnd coupling sections all having the sarr.e inside diameter as the first and second fixed sections and coupling flanges parallel to the   imaginary  coupling  plane,   the  number  of   second   coupling<br>
sections being equal to the number of second fixed sections,<br>
a plurality of couplers each adapted to couple a first coupling section and a second coupling section, which  installation  is  characterised  in  that:<br>
each second coupling section is connected directly to a second fixed section, said second coupling sections having fixed positions parallel to the imaginary coupling plane and being regularly arranged facing a substantially horizontal reference line in said plane at a level  below  the level  of  the  first  sections,<br>
each articulated pipe is connected, at the end opposite the end connected to the first section to which it is connected, to a tubular column having the same inside diameter as the first and second fixed sections and extending vertically as far as a respective first coupling section, the respective lengths of the tubular columns being such that the first coupling sections are all at substantially the same level, each combination of a pipe, a tubular column and a first coupling section being provided with means for limiting movement of said combination along the whole of the reference line to within a given range of horizontal  movement   to  either  side  of   said  reference  line,<br>

-	a plurality of couplers 7 (see also figures 12<br>
through 17) each adapted to couple a first coupling section<br>
and  a  second  coupling  section.<br>
In accordance with various features of the invention:<br>
-	each  of   the  second  coupling   sections   6A,<br>
6U is connected directly to one of the second fixed sections Bl, ...., B21, these second coupling, sections having fixed positions parallel to the imaginary coupling plane and being regularly arranged facing a substantially horizontal reference line L in said plane P and having a level  HL  lower  than  the  levels  of  the  first   sections,<br>
each of the articulated pipes 3A, ...., -J is connected at the end opposite the end connected tc the first section to which it is connected to a tubular column 8A, ...., 8J having the same inside diameter as the first and second fixed sections and extending vertically as far as a respective first coupling section 4A, ...., 4J, the respective lengths of the tubular columns being such that the first coupling sections are all at substantially the same level (that of the reference line), each combination of a pipe, a tubular column and a first coupling section being provided with means for limiting relative movement of this combination along all of the reference line to within a given range of horizontal relative movement to either side  of   said  reference   line   (see  below),<br>
the distance between adjacent second coupling sections and the given range of angular movement is greater than the diameter of the first coupling sections see figure   5)  .<br>
In this example the imaginary coupling plane ? is horizontal.      It   could   instead  be   inclined  or  even  vertical.<br>
In   this   example   each   articulated  pipe   3A, 3J   is    formed   by   three   rigid   sections   articulated   to   each other.<br>
The reference line L is substantially rectilinear.<br>
The  ends  of  the  articulated  pipes  are   inserted  by<br>
means  of  rods  12A	,   12J  into  respective  carriages  10A,<br>
. . . ., 10J provided with bearings for the rods and sliding on rails 11A, . . . ., 11J which are substantially horizontal and coplanar in a vertical plane PV substantially parallel to the reference line. These rails support and guide horizontal  movement  of  the  carriages  10A,    ....,   10J.<br>
Said given range of movement is delimited at least in part by abutments 14, 15 carried by said erds and cooperating with said carriages (in this example with the bearings).<br>
To stiffen the pipe-column connection an inclined spacer 16B, . . . ., 16J is fixed to the end cf the articulated  pipe  and  to  the  associated  column.<br>
The system shown thus comprises a set of articulated  links  made  up  of:<br>
a fixed member Al, A2, etc with its coupling flange  attached  to  a  support  structure  5,<br>
three mobile members linked together by rotation   joints   to   form  articulated  arms   3A,   etc,<br>
the last member curving downwards to form a vertical tube -adapted to be connected to any one cf the fixed outlet pipes Bl, B2, etc. It is provided with a system of guidance in two mutually perpendicular directions: lengthwise of and transversely to the line along  which  the   fixed  support   pipes   are  disposed.<br>
In the vertical plane FY each rail provide! with a guide carriage attached to the vertical column cr tube enables displacement towards the right or towards the left over   the   width   of   the   assembly    (over   the   entire   length   of<br>
the  reference  line).<br>
In a plane perpendicular to the plane PV the rod 12A, etc or sliding guide enables the vertical tube to move from the front towards the rear over a limited distance. This enables positioning of the vertical tube either in front  of  or  behind  the  fixed  pipes.<br>
The function of this guide is important to manoeuvring of the whole system since, depending on the lines already in service and the location of the line to be connected, the vertical tube can be moved without infterfering- with lines already, connected only (see figure  5) :<br>
either on the inside (in front) if the line being manoeuvred is at a level lower than the level of the connected  line,<br>
or on the outside (to the rear) if the line being manoeuvred is situated at a level higher than the level  of  the  connected  line.<br>
The other members of the articulated connection are disposed so that they never interfere with each other when  they  move.<br>
The length of the vertical tube is adapted for each connection so that the point of connection is always at the level of the connecting coupling on the fixed pipes, on   the  exit   side  of   the   installation.<br>
These fixed output pipes, arranged in a line, are equipped  with  two  devices   (see   figures   12   through   17).<br>
The first of these devices is a quick-connect<br>
coupler for connecting the vertical mobile tube to the<br>
fixed     pipework     and     disconnecting     it     therefrom.	This<br>
coupler comprises two jaws or half-flanges 20-21, etc articulated about a fixed axis perpendicular to the coupling plane P and a coarse thread screw-nut system 22 for quick locking and clamping. This arrangement enables opening  of   the  coupler  in  two  stages:<br>
unclamping of the two half-flanges by moving the handle 23 into the opening position; the coupler is nc longer sealed but the pipes are still held in place as a safety-precaution (against accidental opening of a line under pressure),<br>
opening of the two half-flanges after pivoting of the screw-nut   system  22.<br>
An inductive sensor 24 attached to the part 25 to which the half-flanges are articulated senses and identifies  the  vertical  pipe  connected.<br>
The coupler assembly is advantageously mounted on a telescopic section constituting one of the aforementioned second coupling sections moved between top and bottom positions by a lever 26 articulated transversely to one of the  fixed  sections  B,   etc.<br>
This movement moves the coupling flange of the coupler away from the coupling flange on the vertical tube to enable the latter to be moved without interfering with the  coupler.<br>
A plug 27 adapted to be clamped by the coupler hermetically seals a line when it is to remain out of service. A guide groove 28 in the plug holds the unused vertical   tube   in  the  rest  position.<br>
This plug is also a valuable safety measure in the event of accidental pressurisation of a line that is not   used  or   activation  of   the  cleaning  scraper.<br>
As "an alternative to this, if the number of vertical tubes must be greater than ten, to avoid an excessive length of vertical tube a second set of inputs and pipes can be installed facing the first (see fig-ire 6), on  opposite  sides   of   the  row  of   fixed  outlet   pipes   E     etc.<br>
A connection sequence can proceed as follrws, if<br>
mobile (input) line No X must be connected to fixed line<br>
No Y (the mobile line is in the rest position on the plug).<br>
1.	The  operator  moves   the  vertical   tube  to   the  rear.<br>
so that it can be moved towards the right or towards the left,   depending  on  the  position  of   fixed  line  No  Y.<br>
2.	To reach this position, it is necessary to avoid<br>
any interference with the lines which are in service or in<br>
the rest position; the distance between the centre lines of<br>
the fixed lines is sufficient to allow movement to the<br>
front and to the rear of a vertical tube between two<br>
adjacent  lines  in  service   (extreme  case).<br>
The operator displaces the vertical tube and moves it around (in front of or behind) any connected lines it  encounters  as  it  is  moved.<br>
3.	Connection of the mobile vertical tube to the<br>
fixed  pipework:<br>
opening  of  the  coupler,<br>
displacement of the connecting flange of the telescopic section  using  the  lever,<br>
closing  of  the  two  half-flanges  of  the  coupler,<br>
fitting  and  tightening  of  the  screw-nut  system.<br>
Disconnection requires the converse operation and fitting  of  the  plug.<br>
In an alternative embodiment shown in figures 7 through 9 the reference numbers are the same but "primed". This  alternative  embodiment   entails:<br>
dispensing  with  the  horizontal  guides,<br>
installing the output lines in a circle around a central point at which is located the (fixed) first articulation of the  articulated  pipes,<br>
equipping the articulated pipes 3' with a link 30 fastening the outer section to the inner secticr., in parallel with the median section so as to form at least approximately  a   deformable  parallelogram  or  pantograph,<br>
installing abutments to limit relative movement of the vertical tube in the plane perpendicular to 'the fixed rotation. These abutments 31, 32 limit relative movement to  the  inside  and  outside  crossing  position.<br>
Operation of this embodiment can be deduced from the above description of the operation of the first embodiment.<br>
The  advantages  of  this  embodiment  are  as   follows:<br>
reduced cost (through the elimination of the guide systems),<br>
the pantograph produces a rigid coupling by fastening the section carrying the vertical connecting tube, giving the latter a fixed orientation relative to the centre of the circle,   preferable  a  radial  orientation,<br>
right-left     movement     entrains     only     -the      first     fixed rotation,<br>
front-back movement is always by pushing or pulling along an axis which always passes through the first fixed rotation. This prevents any spurious force which could otherwise tends to displace the connection as a whole in one  direction  or  the  other   {to  the  right  or  to  the  left).<br>
However, because the horizontal guidance is<br>
dispensed with, the length of the articulated connections<br>
is limited and consequently the possible number of fixed<br>
connection    points     is     small.	However,      there     are    many<br>
applications   in  which  this   is  acceptable.<br>
The figures show the area W in which an operator<br>
works.	The      first      coupling      sections      4A,       etc      are<br>
advantageously  provided  with  handles   40.<br>
There follows a detailed numerical example of implementation  of   the   invention:<br>
the figure 1 installation has ten inputs and 21 outputs and in the duplicated example of figure 6 the nurirer of inputs is not quite doubled (to 19) to leave enouhg room for the operator: there is provision here for some iegree of   flexibility   to   suit   requirements,<br>
the   rails   are   5  m   long   for   21   outputs   spaced   by   0.25  m, for   example;    the   total   range   of   movement   is   around   0.37  m for    a    transverse    overall    dimension    of    the    couplers    of<br>
around  0.2  m  and  a  column  cross-section  of  around  0.1  m,<br>
the length of the first two articulated pipe sections is 1.7m  while  the  third  section  has  a  width  of   1.2  m,<br>
the total height is 6 m with a minimal level at 1.15 m and  a  height  of   0.9  m  for  the  front  plane,<br>
the inclined spacers 16B, ..., 16J advantageously include polyurethane  buffers,<br>
in the circular configuration the pipe sections have respective lengths from the centre of 1.05 m, 0.525 m and 0.6m and the angular separation of the outputs is 10° for a  reference  line  with  a  radius  of  1.5  m,<br>
the range of movement of the articulated pipe is determined by an abutment joined to the intermediate section adapted to sweep out an angular sector delimited by two  abutments  attached  to  the  internal  section,<br>
the  telescopic  travel  is  50  mm.<br>
It goes without saying that the preceding description has been given by way of non-limiting example only and that numerous variants can be put forward by the person skilled in the art without departing from the scope of   the  invention.<br>
For example, for short lengths of pipe (small number of outlets B! the support guides can be dispensed with even in the embodiments of figures 1 to 6. As an alternative, supports can be provided even in the circular configuration.<br>
Choosing a vertical coupling plane can have the advantage of enabling the telescopic section to be dispensed with, although this increases the range of movement   required  of   each  column.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
