				<td>Flame Retardant Polyethylene Composition comprising Polypropylene<br>
The present invention relates to a flame retardant polymer composition, to an<br>
article, in particular a wire or cable, comprising said flame retardant polymer<br>
composition, and to the use of said composition for the production of a layer<br>
of a wire or cable.<br>
For improving the flame retardancy of polymers, several approaches are<br>
known in the art. First, it is known to include compounds containing halides<br>
into the polymer. However, these materials have the disadvantage that by<br>
burning hazardous and corrosives gases like hydrogen halides are<br>
deliberated. This is also a disadvantage of flame retardant polymer<br>
composition based on PVC.<br>
In a further approach, flame retardant compositions include relatively large<br>
amounts, typically 50 to 60 wt.%, of inorganic fillers such as e.g. hydrated<br>
and hydroxy compounds, which during burning decompose endothermically<br>
and deliberate inert gases at temperatures in the range of 200 to 600°C. Such<br>
inorganic fillers e.g. include Al(OH)3 and Mg(OH)2. However, these flame<br>
retardant materials suffer from the high costs of the inorganic fillers and the<br>
deterioration of the processability and mechanical properties of the polymer<br>
composition due to the high amount of filler.<br>
A third approach as disclosed in EP 0 393 959 uses a silicon fluid or gum in<br>
a composition together with an organic polymer comprising an ethylene<br>
acrylate or acetate copolymer, and an inorganic filler. Although such a<br>
composition has good flame retardant properties, the processability of the<br>
composition may still be improved because often melt fracture occurs when<br><br>
the composition is extruded as a cable layer. Furthermore, the surface quality<br>
of extruded cable layers often is insufficient an may also be further<br>
improved.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to avoid the disadvantages of the<br>
prior art materials and to provide a flame retardant polymer composition<br>
which shows a combination of good flame retardancy, good processability,<br>
such as extrudability, and good mechanical properties, such as improved<br>
surface quality.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that the processability of a<br>
polymer composition comprising an organic polymer, a silicone group<br>
containing compound and an inorganic filler material can be improved by<br>
the addition of a small amount of polypropylene, usually from 0.1 to 10<br>
wt.%.<br>
The invention therefore provides a flame retardant polymer composition<br>
comprising<br>
(A)	a polyethylene,<br>
(B)	a silicone-group containing compound,<br>
(C)	an inorganic filler material, and<br>
(D)	a polypropylene in an amount of 0.1 to 10 wt.% with<br>
respect to the total composition.<br>
The composition of the invention shows improved processability as can be<br>
seen by an improved extrusion behaviour when the composition is extruded<br>
as a layer of a wire or cable. Furthermore, the extruded layers have<br>
good/improved surface quality. Still further, the compositions show good<br>
flame retardancy.<br><br>
Preferably, the composition is free of halogen- and phosphorous-containing<br>
compounds as flame retardancy aids, i.e. such compounds, if at all, are<br>
present in the composition in an amount of below 3000 ppm.<br>
More preferably, the composition is entirely free of halogen-containing<br>
compounds. However, especially phosphorous containing-compounds may<br>
be present in the composition as stabilizers, usually in an amount of below<br>
2000 ppm, more preferably below 1000 ppm.<br>
In the composition, components (A) to (D) may either consist of a single<br>
chemical compound or a mixture of compounds of the required type.<br>
Preferably, the amount of polypropylene (D) is 0.2 wt.% or more, more<br>
preferably is 0.3 wt.% or more, and most preferably is 0.5 wt.% or more of<br>
the total composition.<br>
Furthermore, preferably the amount of polypropylene (D) is 8 wt.% or less,<br>
more preferably is 4 wt.% or less, and most preferably is 3 wt.% or less of<br>
the total composition.<br>
Still further, preferably polypropylene (D) has a MFR2 measured according<br>
to ISO 1133 at 230 °C and 2.16 kg of 0.1 to 15 g/10 min, more preferably of<br>
0.5 to 10g/10min.<br>
Polypropylene (D) preferably has a tensile modulus measured according to<br>
ISO 527-2 of 400 to 2000 MPa, more preferably of 600 to 1600 MPa.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, polypropylene (D) is a propylene heterophasic<br>
copolymer comprising a polypropylene homo- or copolymer as matrix<br>
polymer and an incorporated ethylene-propylene-rubber.<br>
The heterophasic propylene copolymer may be produced by multistage<br>
process polymerisation of propylene and ethylene and optionally alpha-<br><br>
olefin such as bulk polymerisation, gas phase polymerisation, slurry<br>
polymerisation, solution polymerisation or combinations thereof using<br>
conventional catalysts. The heterophasic copolymer can be made either in<br>
loop reactors or in a combination of loop and gas phase reactor. Those<br>
processes are well known to one skilled in the art.<br>
A preferred process is a combination of a bulk slurry loop reactor(s) and gas<br>
phase reactor(s). First, the propylene homo- or copolymer matrix is made<br>
either in loop reactor(s) or in a combination of loop and gas phase reactor.<br>
The polymer produced in this way is transferred into another reactor and the<br>
disperse phase, the ethylene-propylene-rubber, is produced by<br>
copolymerising a mixture of ethylene and propylene with the same catalyst<br>
system, so obtaining a heterophasic system consisting of a semicrystalline<br>
matrix with a nearly amorphous elastomeric component dispersed within it.<br>
Preferably this polymerisation step is done in a gas phase polymerisation.<br>
A suitable catalyst for the polymerisation of the heterophasic copolymer is<br>
any stereospecific catalyst for propylene polymerisation which is capable of<br>
polymerising and copolymerising propylene and comonomers at a<br>
temperature of 40 to 110 °C and at a pressure from 10 to 100 bar. Ziegler-<br>
Natta catalysts as well as metallocene catalysts are suitable catalysts.<br>
Alternatively to producing the heterophasic copolymer in a sequential<br>
multistage process as described above, it can be produced by polymerising<br>
the matrix polymer and the ethylene-propylene-rubber in separate steps and<br>
melt blending the two polymers.<br>
"Rubber" and "elastomeric copolymer" are in this context used as synonyms.<br>
An ethylene propylene elastomeric copolymer may be produced by known<br>
polymerisation processes such as solution, suspension and gas-phase<br><br>
polymerisation using conventional catalysts. Ziegler-Natta catalysts as well<br>
as metallocene catalysts are suitable catalysts.<br>
A widely used process is the solution polymerisation. Ethylene, propylene<br>
and catalyst systems are polymerised in an excess of hydrocarbon solvent.<br>
Stabilisers and oils, if used, are added directly after polymerisation. The<br>
solvent and unreacted monomers are then flashed off with hot water or<br>
steam, or with mechanical devolatilisation. The polymer, which is in crumb<br>
form, is dried with dewatering in screens, mechanical presses or drying<br>
ovens. The crumb is formed into wrapped bales or extruded into pellets.<br>
The suspension polymerisation process is a modification of bulk<br>
polymerisation. The monomers and catalyst system are injected into the<br>
reactor filled with propylene. The polymerisation takes place immediately,<br>
forming crumbs of polymer that are not soluble in the propylene. Flashing<br>
off the propylene and comonomer completes the polymerisation process.<br>
The gas-phase polymerisation technology consists of one or more vertical<br>
fluidised beds. Monomers and nitrogen in gas form along with catalyst are<br>
fed to the reactor and solid product is removed periodically. Heat of reaction<br>
is removed through the use of the circulating gas that also serves to fluidise<br>
the polymer bed. Solvents are not used, thereby eliminating the need for<br>
solvent stripping, washing and drying.<br>
The production of ethylene propylene elastomeric copolymers is also<br>
described in detail in e.g. US 3,300,459, US 5,919,877, EP 0 060 090 A1 and<br>
in a company publication by EniChem "DUTRAL, Ethylene-Propylene<br>
Elastomers" , pages 1-4 (1991).<br>
Alternatively, elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymers, which are<br>
commercially available and which fulfill the indicated requirements, can be<br>
used.<br><br>
The heterophasic copolymer is then produced by combining the matrix<br>
polymer in the form of powder or granules and the elastomeric copolymer in<br>
a melt mixing device.<br>
In case a polypropylene random copolymer is used as matrix polymer for the<br>
heterophasic copolymer, the comonomers preferably are linear alpha-olefins<br>
or branched alpha-olefins like ethylene, butene, hexene etc. In the present<br>
invention ethylene is most preferred.<br>

copolymer.<br>
However, preferably the matrix polymer is a polypropylene homopolymer.<br>

units may contain further alpha-olefin monomer units. However, it is<br>
preferred that the ethylene-propylene rubber consists of ethylene and<br>
propylene monomer units.<br>
Preferably, in the composition of the invention the amount of polyethylene<br>
(A) is from 30 to 70 wt.% of the total composition, more preferably from 40<br>
to 60 wt% of the total composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, polyethylene (A) comprises a polyethylene with<br><br>

most preferably of &gt; 25.<br>

In addition to ethylene and the defined comonomers, the copolymers may<br>

It is further preferred that the polyethylene with polar groups makes up at<br>

b) one step compounding of all components.<br>
For mixing, a conventional compounding or blending apparatus, e.g. a<br>
Banbury mixer, a 2-roll rubber mill, Buss-co-kneader or a twin screw<br>

Preferably, the composition will be prepared by blending them together at a<br>
temperature which is sufficiently high to soften and plasticise the polymer,<br>
typically a temperature in the range of 120 to 200 °C.<br>
The flame retardant compositions of the invention can be used in many and<br>
diverse applications and products. The compositions can for example be<br>

retardant polymer composition in any of the above-described embodiments.<br>
In particular, the invention relates to a wire or cable comprising a layer made<br>

layer of a wire or cable. This is preferably done at a line speed of at least 20<br>
m/min, more preferably at least 60 m/min and most preferably at least 100<br>
m/min.<br>
The pressure used for extrusion preferably is 50 to 500 bar.<br>
Still further, the invention relates to the use of a polypropylene in the<br>
production of a flame retardant layer for a wire or cable as a processing aid,<br>
wherein the polypropylene is present in the composition used for the<br><br>
production of the flame retardant layer in an amount of from 0.1 to 10 wt.%.<br>
In the following the present invention is further illustrated by means of ex-<br>
amples.<br>
Examples<br>
1. Measurement methods<br>
a)	Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy<br>
The improved surface smoothness and reduced melt fracture has been<br>
evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS-SP. The<br>
investigation area was 500 x 500 micrometer, and the wavelength of the<br>
laser-beam was 488 nm. As the lens, a HC PL APO 20 x/0.70 was used, and<br>
the resolution in xy-direction was 279 nm, and in xz-direction 768 nm. The<br>
step size in the tests was 486 nm.<br>
The resolution of the z-Table was 40 nm, the z-standard (for function control<br>
and validation) was from Rommelwerke with Rmax of 0.97 micron.<br>
b)	Melt Flow Rate<br>
The melt flow rate MFR2 was measured in accordance with ISO 1133 at<br>
190°C and a load of 2.16 kg for polyethylene and at 230 °C and a load of<br>
2.16 kg for polypropylene.<br>
c)	Tensile Modulus<br>
Tensile modulus was determined according to IS0527-2.<br><br>
d) Molecular weight distribution and long chain branching<br>
The following procedure is used to determine g'. This procedure should be<br>
followed when determining the branching parameter g' in accordance with<br>
the present invention.<br>
Gel Permeation Chromatography is used for determination of molecular<br>
weight (M), molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn), intrinsic viscosity [η]<br>
and contents of long chain branching (LCB) g'.<br>
Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), which is also known as Size<br>
Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), is an analytical technique where the<br>
molecules are separated after their size. Large molecules elutes first and the<br>
smaller ones later.<br>
Molecules elute after decreasing hydrodynamic volume Vh. This can be<br>
described as a product of the molecules molecular weight (M) and its<br>
intrinsic viscosity [η].<br>
The principal of universal calibration in GPC states that for given sets of<br>
solvent and temperature conditions in which a polymer sample is separated<br>
by pure size mechanism (no adsorption or other effects), the logarithm of the<br>
hydrodynamic volume of a polymer molecule as a function of its elution<br>
volume (or time) is identical for all polymers, linear or branched. See the<br>
equation:<br>
Vh = [η] x M or logVh = log ([η] x M)<br>
The hydrodynamic volume is defined as a product of intrinsic viscosity [η]<br>
and molecular weight M.<br>
Universal calibration is independent of the polymer type and possible<br>
branched polymers.<br><br>
A serial of small standard is used to find the relation between retention time<br>
and molecular weight.<br>
Mark-Houwink-Sakurade equation relates a polymer intrinsic viscosity to its<br>
viscosity average molecular weight Mv.<br><br>
[η] is the intrinsic viscosity.<br>
Mv is the viscosity average molecular weight.<br>
K and a are Mark-Houwink constants. These constants are dependent of the<br>
polymer type, solution and the temperature.<br>
By taking the logarithm on both sides of the equation we will get:<br><br>
A plot of log [n] versus log [Mv] (narrow standards) gives slope and the<br>
intercept K.<br>
If K and a are known for both standards and samples, the molecular weights<br>
can be decided by mean of the relation to their respective constants.<br>
GPC uses a Universal Calibration for quantitative evaluation of the<br>
molecular weight distribution.<br>
The calibration is based on narrow standards to calculate a universal<br>
calibration curve. The retention time for each standard (the RI peak) is<br>
calculated. These values, together with the appurtenant molecular weight are<br>
used to make a universal calibration curve.<br>
The software is able to produce a plot of Log Viscosity versus Log<br>
Molecular Weight for both the RI- and the viscosity-detector. Each detector<br><br>
produces a universal calibration for each fraction within the polymer<br>
chromatogram.<br>
A universal calibration gives genuine molecular weight results.<br>
The software can decide K and a for the standards.<br>
The following values are recommended to be used.<br><br>
The equipment used was a Waters 150CVplus Gel Permeation<br>
Chromatograph no. W-4412 (cf. Waters 150CVplus Viscometer Supplement)<br>
having a differential Refractive Index (dRI) detector and a single capillary<br>
viscometer detector, and three HT6E Styragel (porous styrene-<br>
divinylbenzene) columns from Waters. Calibration was made with narrow<br>
molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards with different molecular<br>
weights (a1116_05002). The mobile phase was 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene<br>
(purity 98.5 %) with 0.25 g/l BHT, 2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol added as an<br>
antioxidant. Millennium32 Version 4 software from Waters was used for<br>
calculation of g' (LCB).<br>
Viscosity Low Plots are determined for the polystyrene standards which<br>
have no long chain branching and therefore represent linear (unbranched)<br>
polymers, and for the branched polyethylene composition of the invention.<br>
The branching parameter is thereafter calculated from the equation:<br><br><br>
where [η]branched is the intrinsic viscosity of the branched polymer in question<br>
and [η]linear is the intrinsic viscosity of an linear (unbranched) standard<br>
polymer.<br>
e) Shear Thinning Index<br>
The shear thinning index SHI(eta0.05/eta300) was determined by dynamic<br>
rheology in a plate/plate rheometer.<br>
This property can be measured as a ratio of the viscosity at two different<br>
shear stresses. In the present invention the shear stresses (or G*) at 0.05 kPa<br>
and 300 kPa are used for calculating the SHI(eta0.05/eta300) as a measure of the<br>
broadness of the molecular weight distribution.<br><br>
wherein<br><br>
It was measured in a Physica MCR300 in oscillating — frequency sweep.<br>
Temperature was 170°C and frequency range was 0.1-500 rad/s. Strain was<br>
set to 5%.<br>

tube-on die was used and the line speed was 25 and 50 meter per minute. The<br>
laboratory extrusion line was equipped with seven temperature zones (120,<br>
140, 150, 160, 170, 170, 170°C).<br>
The following table 1 shows, the ratio of surface (3D) to area (2D) which is a<br>
measure for the surface quality, i.e. he lower the ratio, the better is the<br>
surface quality. The surface areas have also been inspected visually and by<br>
touch. The values from ratio of surface (3D) to area (2D) is corresponding to<br>
visual and manual inspection.<br><br><br>
A high ratio of surface (3D) to area (2D) means that the surface is rough.<br>
Thus, the surface of the inventive compositions is significantly better than<br>
the surface of the comparative example.<br><br>
