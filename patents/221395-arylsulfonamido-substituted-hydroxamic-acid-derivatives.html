Phamiaceutically acceptable salts of the acidic compounds of the invention are salts fomied with bases, namely cationic salts such as alkali and alkaline earth metal salts, such as sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, as well as ammonium salts, such as ammonium, trimethyl-ammonium, diethylammonium, and tris-(hydroxymethyl)-methyl-ammonium salte.<br>
Similarly acid addition salts, such as of mineral acids, organic carboxylic and organic sulfonic acids e.g. hydrochloric acid, methanesulfonic add, maleic acid, are also possible provided a basic group, such as pyiidyl, constitutes part of the structure.<br>
The compounds of formula I have valuable phannacologically useful properties. In particular, they display specific inhibitory actions which are of pharmacological interest<br>
The members of the enzyme family of matrix-degrading metalloproteinases (MMP's), such as gelatinase, stromelysin and collagenase, are implicated in various biological processes, e.g. tissue matrix degradation (e.g. collagen collapse) and in many pattiological conditions involving abnormal connective tissue and basement membrane matrix metabolism, such as artiiritis (e.g. osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis), tissue ulceration (e.g. corneal, epidermal and gastiic ulceration), abnonnal wound healing, periodontal disease, bone disease (e.g. Pagef s disease and osteoporosis), tumor meteistasis or invasion, psoriasis, as<br><br>
well as HlV-lnfection (J. Leuk. Biol. 52 (2): 244-248,1992), artherosclerosis, ventricular dilatation and restenosis in angioplasty.<br>
Macrophage metalloelastase is a further matrix-degrading metalloproteinase which Is involved in the degradation of elastin and has been implicated In pathological conditions, e.g. pulmonary disorders such as emphysema and COPD (chronic obstnjctive pulmonary disease).<br>
Selectivity Is generally an advantageous feature of phamiacologically active compounds, because the side-effects of drugs comprising selective compounds are smaller compared with drugs comprising less selective compounds. Since the family of MMP's consists of several different enzymes which are involved in different biological processes, it is desirable to have selective inhibitors of singular MMP's or subgroups of tiie MMP enzyme family.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts inhibit mati'lx degrading metalloproteinase such as gelatinase, stromelysin, and macrophage metalloelastase, and membrane type matrix metalloproteinases, such as MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP. They are particularly useful as MT1-MMP and MMP2 (gelatinase A) Inhibitors.<br>
A number of peptides are reported to interact with biological matter like enzymes, cells or receptors implicated in pathological processes or diseases. Peptides have ttie disadvantage to get easily hydrolyzed under physiological conditions, especially those physiological conditions to be found in the blood or stomach of wann-blooded animals. The compounds of fonnula I have tiie advantage to be no peptides. The compounds of formula I are non-peptide MMP2 inhibitors.<br>
Beneficial effects are evaluated In pharmacological tests generally known in the art, and as illustrated herein.<br>
The above-died properties are demonstrable In in vHro and in wo tests, using advantageously mammeds, e.g. rats, guinea pigs, dogs, rabbits, or isolated organs and tissues, as well as mammalian enzyme preparations. Said compounds can be applied in vitro in the fonn of solutions, e.g. preferably aqueous solutions, and in vivo eitiier enterally or parenterally, advantageously orally, e.g. as a suspenskm or in aqueous soluticm. The<br><br>
dosage in vitro may range between about 10 "^ molar and 10*'° molar concentrations. The dosage in vivo may range, depending on the route of administration, between about 0.1 and 100 mg/I<g.></g.>
Antiinflammatory activity canbe determined in standard inflammation and arthritic animal models well-known in the art, e.g. the adjuvant arthritis model in rats and the collagen II induced arthritis model in mice (Mediators of Inflam. 1,273-279 (1992)).<br>
One test to determine the Inhibition of stromelysin activity is based on its hydrolysis of Substance P using a modified procedure of Harrison et al (Hamson, R.A., Teahan J., and Stein R., Anal. Biochem. 180.110-113 (1989)). In this assay, Substance P Is hydrolyzed by recombinant human stromelysin to generate a fragment, Substance P 7-11, which can be quantitated by HPLC. In a typical assay, a 10 mM stock solution of a compound to be tested is diluted in the assay buffer to 50 mM, mixed 1:1 with 8 mg recombinant human stromelysin (mol. wt. 45-47 kDa, 2 Units; where 1 Unit produces 20 mmoles of Substance P 7-11 in 30 minutes) and incubated along with 0.5mM Substance P in a final volume of 0.125 mL for 30 minutes at 37*'C. The reaction is stopped by adding 10 mM EDTA and Substance P 7-11 is quantified on RP-8 HPLC.

The effect of compounds of the invention /n-wVo can be determined in rabbits.

The compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug derivatives and phamriaceutically acceptable salts are prepared by processes known per se, for example<br>
a) by reacting a compound of the formula II<br><br>
in which R, q, Ri and R2 are as defined above for compounds of the formula I and the black circular plane indicates ttiat the compound is bound to a polymer resin, free functional groups present in the compound, if necessary, being protected by easily detachable protective groups, In a suitable solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, first with triphenylphosphine, an alcohol of the structure III,<br>
	("')<br><br>
i<br>
in which A and R3 are as defined above for compounds of formula I, and diethyl azodi-carboxylate, free functional groups present in this compound, if necessary, being protected by easily detachable protective groups or, in accordance with the principle of latent functio-" nality, being in a fonn which can be converted into the functional groups and then to cleave the product of the reaction from the polymer resin by a further reaction with trifluoroacetic acid in a suitable solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, or<br>
b) by reacting a compound of the formula IV<br>
n which R, q, A, Ri, R2 and R3 are as defined above for compounds of the formula I, free unctional groups present in the compound, if necessary, being protected by easily letachable protective groups, in a suitable solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, first with &gt;xalylchlorlde in dimethylformamlde and then with hydroxylamine in a mixture of water and Btrahydrofuran, or<br>
) by reacting a compound of the fomiula V<br><br>
in which R, q, A, Ri, R2 and R3 are as defined above for compounds of the fomiula I, free functional groups present in the compound, if necessary, being protected by easily detachable protective groups, in a suitable solvent, e.g. acetic acid ethyl ester, with aqueous hydrogendilorlde<br><br>
and, after carrying out process a), b) or c) and detaching the protective groups present and, if necessary, converting functional groups into the final fomi according to formula I, if necessary for the preparation of a salt, converting a resulting free compound of the fomiula I into a salt or, if necessary for preparation of a free compound, converting a resulting salt of a compound of the formula Unto the free compound.<br>
Processes b) and c) are preferred for compounds of formula I in which R i and R2 are both hydrogen at the same time.<br>
The above processes are described in more detail below:<br>
The end substances of the fomnula I can contain substituents which can also be used as protective groups in starting substances for the preparation of other end substances of the formula I. Unless otherwise evident from the context, "protective groups" in this text, are therefore only those easily detachable groups which are not a constituent of the particular desired end substance of the formula I.<br>
Protective groups, their introduction and their detachment are described, for example, in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London, New York 1973, and in "Methoden der organischen Chemie" [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Houben-Weyl, 4th Edition, Volume 15/1, Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart 1974 and in T. W. Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis', John V^flley &amp; Sons, New York 1981. It Is characteristic of protective groups that they can be detached easily, i.e. without undesirable side reactions taking place, for example by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also under physiological conditions.<br>
Protection of free functional groups in tiie starting material of the formula II Is as a rule not necessary. If desired, free carboxyl or amino groups In the radicals R, R1, R2 or R3 of a compound of formula II, III, IV or V can be present in protected form. Functional groups, such as, In particular, leaving groups, for example halogen or toluenesulfonate, however, can also be present, in accordance witii the principle of latent Ajnctionality, in a fomi which can be converted Into one of the functional groups according to formula I. Thus, a protected amhio group, e.g. incorporated In radical R, can first be set free by detaching the amino-<br><br>
protective group and the free amino group can then be converted into halogen via an azide in a manner known per se.<br>
A protected amino group can be, for example, in the form of an easily detachable acyi-amino, arylmethylamino, ethprified mercaptoamino or 2-acyl-lower alk-1-en-yi-amino group.<br>
In a corresponding acylamino group, acyl is, for example, the acyl radical of an organic carboxylic acid having, for example, not more than 18 C atoms, in particular an alkane-carboxylic acid which is unsubstituted or substituted, for example by halogen or aryl, or of a benzoic acid which is unsubstituted or substituted, for example by halogen, lower aikoxy or nitro, or of a carbonic acid half-ester. Such acyl groups are, for example, lower alkanoyl, such as formyi, acetyl or propionyl, halo-lower alkanoyl, such as 2-haloacetyi, in particular 2-chloro-, 2-bromo-, 2-iodo-, 2,2,2-trifIuoro- or 2,2,2-trichloroacetyl, benzoyl which is unsubstituted or substituted, for example by halogen, lower aikoxy or nitro, for example benzoyl, 4-chlorobenzoyl, 4-methoxybenzoyl or 4-nitrobenzoyl, or lower alkoxycarbonyl which is branched in \he 1 position of tiie lower alkyl radical or suitably substituted in the 1 or 2 position, in particular tert-lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example tert-butyloxycarbonyl, arylmethoxycarbonyl witii one or two aryl radicals, which are preferably phenyl which is unsubstituted or mono- or polysubstituted, for example by lower alkyl, in particular tert-lower alkyl, such as tert-butyl, lower aikoxy, such as methoxy, hydroxyl, halogen, for example chlorine, and/or nitro, such as unsubstituted or substi'tuted benzyloxycarbonyl, for example 4-nitro-benzyloxycarbonyl, or unsubstituted or substituted diphenylmethoxycarbonyl, for example benzhydryloxycarbonyl or dl-(4-metiioxyphenyl)-methoxycaitonyl, aroylmetiioxy-carbonyl. In which the aroyl group is preferably benzoyl which Is unsubstituted or substi¬tuted, for example by halogen, such as bromine, for example phenacyloxycarbonyl, 2-halo-lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, 2-bromoethoxy-carbonyi or 2-iodoethoxycarbonyi, or 2-(trlsubstituted sllyl)-ethoxycarbonyi, in which the substituents independentiy of one another are each an aliphatic, araliphatic, cycloallphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical which has not more than 15 C atoms and is unsubstituted or substi¬tuted, for example substituted by lower alkyl, lower aikoxy, aryl, halogen or nitro, such as con'esponding unsubstituted or substituted lower alkyl, phenyl-lower alkyl, cycloalkyi or phenyl, for example 2-tri-lower alkylsilylethoxycarbonyl, such as 2-trimethyisilyl-ethoxy-carbonyl or 2-(cK-n-butyi-methyl-siIyi)-ethoxycarbonyl, or 2-triarylsllyIethoxycarbonyt, such as 2-tiiphenylsiiylethoxycarbonyl.<br><br>
In an arylmethylamino group which is a mono-, di- or, in particular, triarylmethylamino group, the aryl radicals are, in particular, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl radicals. Such groups' are, for example, benzyl-, diphenylmethyl- and, in particular, tritylamlno.<br>
An etherified mercapto group in an amino group protected with such a radical is, in particular, arylthio or aryl-lower alkylthio, in which aryl is, in particular, phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted, for example by lower alkyl, such as methyl or tert-butyl, lower alkoxy, such as methoxy, halogen, such as chlorine, and/or nitro. A con-esponding amlno-protective group is, for example, 4-nitrophenylthlo.<br>
In a 2-acyl-lower alk-1-en-1-yl radical which can be used as an amino-protective group, acyl is, for example, the con-esponding radical of a lower alkanecarboxyllc acid, of a benzoic acid which is unsubstituted or substituted, for example by lower alkyl, such as metiiyl or tert-butyl, lower alkoxy, such as methoxy, halogen, such as chlorine, and/or nitro, or, in particular, of a carbonic acid half-ester, such as a carbonic acid lower alkyl half-ester. Con-esponding protective groups are, in particular, 1 -lower alkanoyl-prop-1 -en-2-yl, for example 1 -acetyl-prop-1 -en-2-yl, or 1 -lower alkoxycarbonyl-prop-1 -en-2-yl, for example 1 -ethoxycarbonyl-prop-1 -en-2-yl.<br>
Preferred amino-protective groups are acyl radicals of carbonic acid half-esters, in particular tert-butyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl which is unsubstituted or substituted, for example as defined, for example 4-nitro-benzyloxycart&gt;onyl, or diphenylmethoxycarbonyl, or 2-halo-lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as 2,2,2-tiichloretiioxycarbonyl, and furtiiermore tiityl or fonnyl.<br>
Prefen'ed protected carboxyl groups are, for example, tert-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxy¬carbonyl or diphenylmethoxycarbonyl which are unsubstituted or substituted, or 2 -trimetiiyl-sllyl-etiioxycarbonyl.<br>
The reaction between tiie derivative of tiie formula II and the alcohol of tiie fomnula 111 can be. carried out in suitable inert solvents. If possible, on tiie basis of ttie physical nature of the alcohol of tiie fomraula III, however, tiie reaction can also be carried out without a foreign solvent, and the ateohol of ^e formula III is employed In a large excess, for example a hundred times the equivalent amount, both as tiie reagent and as tiie solvent The reaction<br><br>
Is carried out under shaking or stirring and under an argon or nitrogen atmosphere. Depending on the nature of the specific reactants the reaction is carried out at a tempe¬rature between 0 °C and 90 °C, preferably between +20 "C and +60 "C, for example at room temperature or 50 "C. Optionally it is carried out in a high pressure tube. After a period of for example between 12 and 24 hours, further triphenylphosphine, diethyl azodl-carboxylate and also alcohol of formula III can be added. The product of the first reaction stage is filtered of and washed with tetrahydrofuran, an alcohol, e.g. 2-propanol, and dichloromethane. Cleavage of the product from the polymer resin is accomplished by treatment of the reaction product with trifluoroacetic acid In dichloromethane for 15 to 30 minutes at a temperature between 20 "C and 50 "C, e.g. room temperature or 30 "C.<br>
The cleavage reaction of the compound of the formula V can be carried out in suitable inert solvents, like acetic acid ethyl ester or tetrahydrofuran. The solvent can also be pure water or a mixture of water with another solvent, depending on the solubility of the compound of fomnula V in which case the solvent water would also be the reagent. The reaction is usually canied out at room temperature, but it can also be carried out at temperatures between 0 °C and 100 "C depending of the reactivity of the compound of formula V. Normally, the cleavage reaction is can-ied out with aqueous hydrogen chloride, but other Bronsted acids and Lewis acids can also be employed instead, like e.g. hydrogen bromide, diluted sulfuric acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid, boron trifluoride or metall cations.<br>
The protective groups which are not a constituent of the desired end product of the fonmula I are detached In a manner known per se, for example by means of solvolysis, in particular hydrolysis, alcoholysls or acldolysis, or by means of reduction, in particular hydrogenoiysis or chemical reduction, if necessary in stages or simultaneously. The detachment of the protective groups can be earned out before, after or simultaneously with tfie cleavage of the product from the polymer resin.<br>
A protected amino group is set free In a manner known per se and, depending on the nature of the protective groups, In diverse manners, preferably by means of solvolysis or reduction. 2-Halo-iower alkoxycarisonylamino (if appropriate after conversion of a 2-bromo-lower alkoxycarbonylamino group into a 2-iodo-iower alkoxycarbonylamino group), aroyt-methoxycarbonylamino or 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamlno can be split, for example, by treatment witii a suitable chemical reducing agent, such as zinc in the presence of a<br><br>
suitable carboxyiic acid, sucii as aqueous acetic acid. Aroylmetlioxycarbonylamino can also be split by treatment with a nucleophilic, preferably salt-forming reagent, such as sodium tiiiophenoiate, and 4-nitro-benzyloxycarbonylamino can also be split by treatment with an alkali metal dithionite, for example sodium dithionite. Substituted or unsubstituted diphenyi-methoxycarbonylamino, tert-lower alkoxycarbonylamino or 2-trisubstltuted silylethoxy-carbonylamino can be split by treatment with a suitable acid, for example fomiic or trifluoro-acetic acid, substituted or unsubstituted benzyloxycarbonylamino can be split, for example, by means of hydrogenolysis, i.e. by treatment with hydrogen in the presence of a suitable hydrogenatlon catalyst, such as a palladium catalyst, and triarylmethylamino or fonnyiamino can be split, for example, by treatment with an acid, such as a mineral acid, for example hydrochloric acid, or an organic acid, for example formic, acetic or trifluoroacetic acid, if appropriate in the presence of water, and an amino group protected by an organic silyl group can be set free, for example, by means of hydrolysis or aicoholysis. An amino group protected by 2-haloacetyl, for example 2-chloroacetyl, can be set free by treatment with thiourea in tfie presence of a base or with a thioiate salt, such as an alkali metal thiolate, of urea and subsequent solvolysis, such as aicoholysis or hydrolysis, of the condensation product fomried. An amino group protected by 2-substituted silylethoxycarbonyl can also be converted Into the free amino group by treatment with a hydrofluoric add salt which supplies fluoride anions.<br>
