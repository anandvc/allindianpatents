The enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC3.4.14.5, abbreviated in the following as DPP-IV) is involved in the regulation of the activities of several hormones. In particular DPP-IV is degrading efficiently and rapidly glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is one of the most potent stimulator of insulin production and secretion. Inhibiting DPP-IV would potentiate the effect of endogenous GLP-1, and lead to higher plasma insulin concentrations. In patients suffering from impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, higher plasma insulin concentration would moderate the dangerous hyperglycaemia and accordingly reduce the risk of tissue damage. Consequently, DPP-IV inhibitors have been suggested as drug candidates for the treatment of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (e.g. Vilhauer, W098/19998). Other related state of the art can be found in WO 99/38501, DE 19616486, DE 19834591, WO 01/40180, WO 01/55105, US 6110949, WO 00/34241 and US6011155.<br><br>
We have found novel DPP-IV inhibitors that very efficiently lower plasma glucose evek Consequently, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment md/or prophylaxis of diabetes, particularly non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, md/or impaired glucose tolerance, as well as other conditions wherein the amplification of action of a peptide normally inactivated by DPP-IV gives a therapeutic benefit. Surprisingly, the compounds of the present invention can also be used in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of bowl disease, colitis ulcerosa, morbus crohn, obesity and/or metabolic syndrome. Unexpectedly, the compounds of the present invention exhibit improved therapeutic and pharmacological properties compared to other DPP IV inhibitors known in the art, such as e.g. in context with pharmacokinetics and bioavailability.<br>

Example 25)<br><br>
Synthesis of this compound requires the preparation of the corresponding amine<br>
precursor IIIB according to the general scheme shown above. In the initial step, an<br>
aminophenol or naphtol derivative VII is treated with a suitable base such as NaH or<br>
potassium tcrtbutylate in an inert solvent such as THF or DMF or the like and then with a<br>
sulfimidate IV. Sulfimidates represented by the general formula IV can be made from the<br>
suitably substituted a-amino acid. This starting material is reduced by methods known in<br>
the literature to give the corresponding 2-amino-alcohol. The intermediate thus obtained<br>
is then converted to the N-BOC protected derivative by standard methods. Further<br>
treatment with SOCWimidazole and subsequent oxidation with NalCVRuCh affords the<br>
desired sulfimidateIV.		. .			<br>

Synthesis of this compound requires the preparation of the corresponding amine precursor IIIF. A possible way for the preparation oflllF is described in the general scheme above. According to this scheme an optionally protected (2-amino-ethyl)-thiourea XV is converted in the presence of an a-halo-carbonyl compound to the corresponding Nl-thiazol-2-yi-ethane-l,2-diamine XVI. Finally, deprotection leads to IIIF. The starting thiourea XV is known [R3 = R4 = H: CAS 331779-96-5] or can be derived in analogy from the corresponding diamine and benzoyl isothiocyanate.<br>

n-Buthyllithium (1.6M in hexane, 5.05 ml) was added dropwise to a solution of diisopropylamine (1.16 ml) in THF (30ml) at 0°C under argon. The resulting mixture was stirred for another 15 minutes before it was cooled to -78°C and a solution of methyl isobutyrate (0.84 ml) in THF (3 ml) was added dropwise. After the addition was completed, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 0°C and than again cooled to -78°C. At this temperature a solution of 4-chloromethyl-5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazole [CAS 103738-61-0, commercially available] (1.17g) in THF (6 ml) and DMPU (7.7 ml) was added. Stirring was continued for another 30 minutes before a saturated NH4CI solution (lml) was added. Then the THF was removed in vacuo and water was added to the remaining residue. This mixture was extracted with ether and the combined organic extracts were washed with water and brine and dried (MgS04). After evaporation of the solvent the crude alkylation product (1.46 g) was dissolved in THF (20-ml) and LiOH    -solution (1M, 14.5 ml) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight, concentrated and washed with ether. Then the pH was adjusted to 1 by addition of 3N HC1 and the resulting suspension was extracted with ether. Finally the combined extract^ were<br><br>

Synthesis of this type of compound required the preparation of the hitherto unknown 6-membered sulfimidate reagents XIX for the preparation of amine precursors IIIH - IIIL. In general, a BOC protected 3-aminopropan-l-ol XX (e.g. made by reduction from azetidinone XXI) is cyclized with SOCl2 in the presence of imidazole. The intermediate is usually not isolated but subsequently oxidized to the BOC protected sulfonic acid derivative XIX. As the 5 membered sulfimidates IV, these compounds are versatile alkylating agents that react readily with a variety of nitrogen and carbon based nucleophiles.<br>
Pyrazole derivatives XXII used for examples 78 - 97 are commercially available or can be accessed via pathways A or B known in the literature involving l&gt;3-diketones XXIII and XXIV as synthetic intermediates. If pyrazoles XXII are treated with strong bases such as potassium-terf-butoxide (KOtertBu) or the like followed by a sulfimidate XIX, N-alkylated products XXV-A and XXV-B (mixture of regioisomers) are obtained. Usually, regioisomer XXV-A can be isolated in larger amounts. Treatment of these BOC protected amines with acids such as TFA or the like results in liberation of the free amines IIIH-A and IIIH-B that are used in the coupling reaction with IIA to furnish cyanopyrrolidines I.<br><br><br>
