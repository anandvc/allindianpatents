FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIER WITH LINEARIZATION<br>
Related Applications:<br>
[0000] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/544,282, filed February 11,2004.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] Receivers in communication systems commonly incorporate one or more low noise amplifiers (LNAs) with suitable performance characteristics. For example single-tone desensitization for code division multiple access (CDMA) telephones generally specify a very high LNA third-order intercept point HP3 in combination with low noise factor (NF), high gain, and low current consumption. Linearization techniques are commonly used to attain appropriate performance.<br>
[0002] For example, feed-forward distortion cancellation has been used to attain a very high IIP3 for a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) low noise amplifier. Feed-forward distortion cancellation has not been widely adopted because of high sensitivity to mismatches between main and auxiliary gain stages and errors in input signal scaling.<br>
[0003] A field-effect transistor can also be linearized by biasing at a gate-source voltage (VGS) at which a third-order derivative of the transistor DC transfer characteristic is zero. Resulting transistor third-order intercept point IIP3 peaks in a very narrow range of VGS, making the technique very sensitive to bias variations.<br>
[0004] A derivative superposition (DS) method has been used to reduce third-order intercept point ITP3 sensitivity to bias. Derivative superposition uses two or more parallel field-effect transistors of different gate widths and gate biases to attain a composite DC transfer characteristic with an extended VGS range in which the third-order derivative is close to zero. However, the third-order intercept point IJP3 improvement attained is only modest at radio frequency, for example about 3dB. Reducing source degeneration inductance and drain load impedance at a second-<br><br>

3<br>
harmonic frequency of a composite input transistor allows an increase in third-order intercept point DP3 by as much as l0dB. One disadvantage of the derivative superposition technique is a resulting higher noise factor, for example in a range of about 0.6dB.<br>
[0005] The conventional derivative superposition method does not significantly increase third-order intercept point IIP3 at radio frequency due to the contribution of second-order nonlinearity to third-order intermodulation distortion (TMD3). In general, the vector of the second-order contribution is not collinear with the vector of the third-order contribution and, therefore, the contributions do not mutually cancel.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] In accordance with an embodiment of an illustrative communication apparatus, an amplifier comprises a source degeneration inductance and at least two field effect transistors coupled in parallel and having mutually different gate biasing. Source connections of the field effect transistors are coupled along different positions of the source degeneration inductance.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] A novel modified derivative superposition method attains a very high third-order intercept point HP3 at radio frequency. The illustrative derivative superposition method creates opposing phases of second and third-order contributions to third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) by using a controlled inductance for source degeneration of a composite field-effect transistor. In an illustrative embodiment, the modified derivative superposition method implements a tapped inductor for source degeneration. The modified method increases third-order intercept point IIP3 of a low noise amplifier embodiment. In a specific implementation, HP3 is boosted by 15dB.<br>
[0017] Referring to FIGURE 1, a schematic circuit diagram illustrates an amplifier 100 that comprises a source degeneration inductance 102 and at least two field effect transistors 104A, 104B coupled in parallel and having mutually different gate biasing.<br><br>
WO 2005/078920	PO7US2005/003155<br>
5<br>
Source connections of the field effect transistors are coupled along different positions of the source degeneration inductance 102. The illustrative amplifier 100 includes a source degeneration inductance 102 that is a tapped inductor. Source connections of the field effect transistors 104A, 104B are connected to respective taps 106A, 106B of the source generation inductance 102 whereby at least one of the field effect transistors 104B is biased in strong inversion and at least one of the field effect transistors 104A is biased in weak inversion.<br>
[0018) The first and second field-effect transistors 104A, 104B and source generation inductance 102 form a modified-derivative superposition element 110. The first and second field-effect transistors 104A, 104B each have a gate coupled to a common input signal 108, a mutually coupled drain, and a source coupled respectively to the source generation inductance 102.<br>
[0019] In the illustrative embodiment, the amplifier 100 includes two field-effect transistors 104A, 104B with mutually-connected drains. Gates of the two field-effect transistors 104A, 104B are driven by the same input signal but have different direct current bias voltages. Sources are connected to ground through either one inductor 102 with end terminals and a tap, or two inductors in series 212A, 212B as shown in FIGURE 2.<br>
[0020] The illustrative low noise amplifier 100 and associated derivative superposition method can significantly increase third-order intercept point HP3 at radio frequency (RF) even without completely eliminating a second-order contribution to third-order interrnodulation distortion (IMD3). A suitable improvement can be attained by attaining a second-order contribution approximately the same magnitude and opposite in phase with the third-order contribution.<br>
[0021] In contrast to a conventional derivative scaling technique in which the second-order contribution is optimally scaled and rotated by tuning second-harmonic terminations of the composite field-effect transistor, the illustrative technique uses a tapped inductor 102 for source degeneration to adjust magnitude and phase of the third-order contribution.   The tapped inductor 102 can be used to conserve die area on an<br><br>

integrated circuit chip implementation. Alternatively, as shown in FIGURE 2, the inductance can be replaced by multiple inductors 212A and 212B coupled in series.<br>
[0022] Referring again to FIGURE 1, a first field-effect transistor (Tl) 104A is biased in weak inversion with a positive associated third-order transconductance coefficient (gm) and a second field-effect transistor (T2) 104B is biased in strong inversion with a negative associated third-order transconductance coefficient (gm)-First-order transconductance coefficient contributions girt and gm are negligible to the overall response of the amplifier 100.<br>
[0023] The source of the first field-effect transistor (Tl) 104A is connected to a tap 106A of the source degeneration inductance 102 in a configuration that changes magnitude and phase of the associated third-order transconductance coefficient (gm) contribution to the third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) relative to the second-order transconductance coefficient (gm) and third-order transconductance coefficient (g3T2) contributions associated to the second field-effect transistor (T2) 104B. With proper selection of the tapping point 106A, 106B and field-effect transistor widths and biases, the overall third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) can be reduced to zero or effectively zero for a wide range of bias.<br>
[0024] The illustrative amplifier 100 and design methodology does not require the degeneration inductance 102 to be minimized and therefore enables simultaneous noise-power matching. Furthermore, the illustrative amplifier 100 and design methodology facilitate stability since the third-order intercept point IIP3 is very insensitive to input termination at the second-harmonic frequency.<br>
[0025] Referring to FIGURE 2, a schematic circuit diagram illustrates an alternative embodiment of a transistor 200 in which a source degeneration inductance 202 includes at least two inductors 212A and 212B coupled in series with source connections of at least two field effect transistors 204A, 204B coupled to the two inductors 212A, 212B in positions whereby at least one of the field effect transistors 204B is biased in strong inversion and at least one of the field effect transistors 204A is biased in weak inversion.<br><br><br>

[0026) In particular illustrative embodiments, low noise amplifiers 100 and 200 may be configured as cellular code division multiple access (CDMA) CMOS low noise amplifiers.<br>
[0027] FIGURES 3A, 3B, and 3C are graphs used to illustrate optimum gate biasing. FIGURE 3A shows a measured direct current transfer characteristic including a region of weak and moderate inversion, and a region of strong inversion. The direct current transfer characteristic can be measured for a particular field-effect transistor (FET). In one example, the transfer characteristic is measured from a 350um-wide FET in a 0.25um complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process that can be used to manufacture the illustrative low noise amplifiers. FIGURE 3B illustrates power series coefficients gt, gz, and g3- FIGURE 3C depicts theoretical amplitude response AIP3. The transition region from moderate to strong inversion has a gate-source voltage VGS at which the third order coefficient g) is equal to zero and therefore amplitude response AIP3 is infinite. In an optimum gate biasing method, a field-effect transistor is biased at the voltage VGS of infinite Am- As shown in FIGURE 3C, a significant third-order intercept point HP3 improvement occurs only in a very small range of VGS- The low noise amplifier embodiments depicted in FIGURE 1 and FIGURE 2 alleviate the limited optimum range of VGS-<br>
[0028] The low noise amplifier implemented using the derivative superposition method significantly improves input-referred third-order intercept point HP3 without degrading other parameters of the low noise amplifier. The low noise amplifier configured using the illustrative derivative superposition method is appropriately insensitive to process variations and device mismatches, facilitating usage in high-volume production.<br>
[0029] The illustrative derivative superposition method can be used in radio frequency complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (RFCMOS) technology that is typically useful in low cost manufacturing in a manner that attains high-volume production while satisfying single-noise desense criteria in RF CMOS low noise amplifiers, for example for usage for CDMA receivers.<br><br>

[0030] Referring to FIGURES 4A, 4B, and 4C, a schematic circuit diagram showing a composite field-effect transistor, and graphs showing third-order power series coefficients, and theoretical amplitude response at DC respectively illustrate direct current (DC) theory of the derivative superposition method. The composite field-effect transistor is a combination of a first field-effect transistor MA having a width WA, and a second field-effect transistor MB having a width WB. In an example used to determine coefficients g and amplitudes A shown in FIGURES 4B and 4C respectively, the width WA of transistor MA is 240um, the width WB of transistor MB is 460um, and the offset voltage VOFF is 0.2V. A common-source field-effect transistor biased in saturation generates a small-signal output current that can be expanded into the power series of equation (1) in terms of small-signal gate-source voltage Vg, around the bias point:<br>
	0)<br>
where g1 is small-signal transconductance and higher-order transconductance coefficients g2, g1, etc. define strengths of corresponding nonlinearities. Among the coefficients, g1 has particular importance for controlling third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) at low signal levels and thus determining third-order intercept point IIP3, which is expressed according to equation (2) as follows:<br><br><br>
[0031) Amplitude An»3 402 is depicted in the graph m FIGURE 4C at low frequencies along with third-order intercept point IEP3 404 at 880MHz and inductance L of 2nH, third-order intercept point IIP3 406 at 880MHz and inductance L of 0.5nH, and third-order intercept point IIP3 408 at 880MHz and inductance L of 0.lnH.<br>
[0032] Power series coefficients generally depend on the direct current (DC) gate-source and drain-source voltages, VQS and VDS- However, dependence on drain-source voltage VDS for a field-effect transistor in saturation can be neglected. If so, coefficients of equation (1) can be determined according to equations (3) as follows:<br><br>
WO 2005/078920<br>

[0033) Dependence of transconductance coefficient g$ on gate-source voltage VGS is such that transconductance coefficient g3 changes from positive to negative when VGS transitions from the weak and moderate inversion regions to strong inversion (SI) region. A positive g3 with a particular g3(Vcs) curvature of one field-effect transistor can be aligned with a negative g3 with a similar, but mirror-image, curvature of another field-effect transistor by off-setting gate biases. In addition, the g3 magnitudes can be equalized through a relative field-effect transistor scaling. The resulting composite g3 becomes close to zero and the theoretical amplitude Arc becomes significantly improved in a wide range of gate biases, as shown in FIGURES 4B and 4C. However, the improvement in AIP3 is only valid for very low frequencies at which the effect of circuit reactance is negligible.<br>
[0034) Referring to FIGURE 5, a schematic small-signal nonlinear equivalent circuit diagram illustrates a composite field-effect transistor. The small-signal nonlinear equivalent circuit depicts the composite field-effect transistor (MA + MB) shown in FIGURE 4 A. Impedance Z; is the transformed output impedance of a signal generator and inductance L is source degeneration inductance. The analysis proceeds according to several assumptions. First, body effect is negligible such mat g„b is approximately equal to zero. Second, all capacitances are zero except the gate-source capacitance Ce. Third, the gate-source capacitance Cgs is bias independent and thus linear, an assumption that is only valid in weak and strong inversion regions. Fourth, the field-effect transistor gate and source series resistances and the direct current (DC) resistance of the degeneration inductor are zero. Fifth, the field-effect transistor output conductance is infinite, for instance no channel length modulation exists. Sixth, the input signal is very weak such that current id (vgJ nonlinearities of the order higher than three are negligible, an assumption that is typical for low noise amplifiers because the amplifiers operate far below the amplifier ldB compression point.<br>
[0035] In the illustrative weakly nonlinear case with the neglected gate-drain capacitance Cgd, third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) is generated entirely by the g3v3g3 component of the drain current if source degeneration inductance L is zero.<br><br><br><br>
WO 2005/078920	PCT/US2005/003155<br>
10<br>
The source degeneration inductance L creates a feedback path for the drain current to the gate-source voltage vgs. The feedback is particularly strong for high frequency spectral components of drain current U. For example, the second harmonics generated by the g2v2g3 component are fed back across the gate and source adding to the fundamental components of gate-source voltage Vg,. The spectral components are mixed in the g2v3g3 component to produce responses at frequencies 2w1 ± w2 and 2w2 ±<br>
w1. Accordingly, the second-order linearity of id also contributes to third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3).<br>
[0036] Assuming that Dw (w2 - w1) is much smaller than w1 and w2 such that jDwL, is approximately equal to zero and the signal generator is conjugately matched to the field-effect transistor input at to (so mat to, w1, and w2 are mutually approximately equal), then third-order intercept point IIP3 can be derived according to equation (4) as follows:<br>
	(4)<br><br><br><br>
[0037} Equations (4) and (5) express a condition that reduction of transconductance coefficient gj to zero does not result in an infinite third-order intercept point IIP3 as results at low frequencies due to the second term in equation (5). The second term in equation (5) represents the contribution of the second-order nonlinearity to third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3). In conformity to the equation, the second-order nonlinearity contribution depends on the degeneration inductance L. FIGURE 4C shows third-order intercept point HP3 calculated at 880MHz using equations (4) and (5) for the composite field-effect transistor in FIGURE 4A with an input matching circuit including a series capacitor and shunt inductor. The source degeneration inductance significantly suppresses the high-frequency third-order intercept point HP3 peaking at<br><br><br>
WO 2005/078920	PCTA/US2005/003155<br>
VGS where coefficient gj is close to zero. In fact, for realistic values of source degeneration inductance L, which are limited by the downbond inductance (&gt;0.5nH), the conventional derivative superposition method supplies no third-order intercept point IIP3 improvement at all.<br>
[0038) According to equation (5), the second-order contribution to third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) is minimized in the presence of a nonzero inductance L by increasing impedance Z/ (w). However, the feedback through the neglected gate-drain capacitance Cgd becomes significant, which also leads to the second-order contribution to third-order intermodulation distortion IMD3). To completely eliminate the second-order contribution and attain a significant third-order intercept point IIP3 improvement using the derivative superposition method, the gate and drain termination of the composite field-effect transistor at the second-harmonic frequency is optimized. One of the terminations is to have a negative real part, resulting in potential instability of the amplifier. A noticeable third-order intercept point IIP3 improvement using conventional derivative superposition techniques can be attained by simply minimizing the source degeneration inductance and the drain load impedance. However, with a very small inductance L, simultaneously attaining a good voltage standing wave ration (VSWR) and noise factor (NF) is difficult, probably resulting in the poor gain and noise factor (NF) characteristics of the low noise amplifier, for example about lOdB and 2.85dB respectively at 900MHz.<br>
[0039] In a particular example, the derivative superposition method can be implemented using two field-effect transistors, one biased in the weak inversion (WI) region and the other biased in strong inversion (SI). Intuitively, the overall noise factor of the composite field-effect transistor should be dominated by the field-effect transistor in strong inversion, which draws approximately twenty times more current than the field-effect transistor in weak inversion. The intuition is confirmed by simulations using Berkeley Short-Channel IGFET Metal Oxide Semiconductor (BSIM3v3) models. However, measured data has been found to disagree with the intuitive and BSIM results.<br>
[0040] The most significant MOSFET noise sources at radio frequency (RF) are drain current noise and induced gate noise respectively expressed in equations (6) and (7) as follows:<br><br>
WO 2005/078920	PCTYUS2005/003155<br>
12-<br><br><br>
where gand d are bias-dependent noise coefficients and gdo is drain-source conductance at zero VDS- For a long-channel field-effect transistor in strong inversion, gdo = 2Ip,sat    (VGS-VTH) where Ip,sat is the drain saturation current and VTH is threshold voltage. The two noise currents are partially correlated, with a correlation coefficient defined according to equation (8) as follows:<br>
[0041] The values of y, 6, and c have been derived by van der Ziel in Noise in Solid State Devices and Circuits, New York: Wiley, 1986, for a long channel device in strong inversion. For a saturated field-effect transistor, y=2/3, 5=4/3, and c==f0.395. Short-channel values of g and d are two to three times larger. For simplicity, short-channel effects can be neglected. Extending the van der Ziel model for a field-effect transistor in weak inversion, derived long channel values are g=l/2, d=5/4, and c=j0.707. Since drain current in weak inversion results from diffusion, conductance goo is ID,sat/spt where spt is the thermal voltage kT/q. Substituting gao into equation (7) clarifies an interesting observation. While the field-effect transistor in weak inversion draws a negligible drain current, the transistor induced gate noise is inversely proportional to the drain current and, thus, can be quite significant, adding to the induced gate noise current of the field-effect transistor in strong inversion and degrading the overall noise factor in the derivative superposition method. The modified implementation of the derivative superposition technique shown in FIGURES 1 and 2 alleviates or prevents this difficulty.<br>
[0042] Referring to FIGURES 6A and 6B, graphs respectively illustrate measured characteristics of a low noise amplifier embodiment configured in accordance with the illustrative derivative superposition method.

FIGURE 6B shows measured third-order intercept point IIP3 at Pin at -30dB as a function of combined DC current of the input field-effect transistors. The low noise amplifier designed according to the illustrative derivative superposition method was manufactured in a 0.25pm Si CMOS technology as part of a cellular CMDA zero-Intermediate Frequency (IF) receiver and packaged in a quad flat no-lead (QFN) 32-pin package. Measured power gain and noise factor of the amplifier are 15.5dB and 1.6dB respectively with current consumption of 9mA from 2.6V excluding the bias circuit. Input and output losses are lower than -lldB. The low noise amplifier third-order intercept point HP3 was tested with two tones at 880MHz and 880.5MHz. Measured output powers of the fundamental and third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) responses as functions of the input power per tone are plotted in FIGURE 6A. The P»«D3 (Pm) curve 602 rises with a slope steeper than 3:1 at the measured power levels, which means that the composite third-order nonlinearity is negligible and the third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) is dominated by fifth and higher order nonlinearities. As a result, third-order intercept point IIP3 is a function of Pin. At Pin = -30dBm, third-order intercept point IIP3 = +17.2dBm. The third-order intercept point IIP3 has also measured for different values of master reference current with the ratio of the reference currents for the two field-effect transistors IRA/IRB maintained constant. FIGURE 6B shows the low noise amplifier maintains high third-order intercept point IIP3 in a wide range of the DC current through the composite field-effect transistor. The attained third-order intercept point UP3 was verified to be insensitive to the input and output harmonic terminations.<br>
[0043] The low noise amplifier was also manufactured with a single input field-effect transistor and attained 16dB gain, +2dBm third-order intercept point IIP3, and 1.4dB noise factor (NF) with 9mA DC current. Accordingly, the proposed modified derivative superposition method boosted third-order intercept point IIP3 by about 15dB but degraded noise factor by 0.2dB due to induced gate noise of the field-effect transistor biased in weak inversion. The noise factor degradation is a common drawback of all derivative superposition-based methods.<br>

[0045] Referring to FIGURE 7, a schematic block diagram illustrates an embodiment of a wireless communication device 700 that can use a low noise amplifier 702 configured using the illustrative derivative superposition method. The illustrative wireless communication device 700 comprises a receiver 704 capable of receiving radio frequency signals and including a low noise amplifier 702 further comprising a source degeneration inductance and at least two field effect transistors coupled in parallel and having mutually different gate biasing. As shown in FIGURES 1 and 2, source connections of the field effect transistors are coupled along different positions of the source degeneration inductance.<br>
[0046] In an illustrative embodiment, the wireless communication device 700 incorporates code division multiple access (CDMA) signal modulation techniques to conduct multiple communications simultaneously over a radio frequency bandwidth.<br>
[0047] The example shows a receiver 704of a wireless communication device 700 that implements a Zero Intermediate Frequency (IF) architecture, although any suitable architecture may otherwise be used. The wireless communication device 700 includes an antenna 706 that receives incoming radio frequency signals. In some examples, the radio frequency (RF) signals may be code division multiple access (CDMA) modulated signals that are received from a CDMA base station. The RF signal can be passed through a low noise amplifier 702 before mixing down to baseband by radio frequency (RF) mixer 708. The mixer 708 may receive carrier waveforms produced by a frequency synthesizer 710 using a local clock as a timing reference. The local clock may be a voltage-controlled oscillator 712, for example. Other components may be included in the wireless communication device 700.<br><br>
WO 2005/078920	PCT/US2005/003155<br>
16<br>
[0048] RF mixer 708 produces a baseband signal 714 which can be filtered by a filter 716, and sampled by analog-to-digital converter 718 to produce corresponding digital values of the signal, for example a digital baseband signal 720. Digital voltage gain amplifier (VGA) 722 scales the digital baseband signal 720 either by amplifying or attenuating the digital values, according to a logarithmic gain value 724 received from automatic gain control (AGC) unit 726.<br>
[0049) After scaling by the digital VGA 722, the scaled digital baseband signal is supplied to receivers 728 which separate and track signals received from different sources, for example different baseband stations. In some examples, receivers 728 may perform various functions such as dispreading, Walsh decovering and accumulation, pilot time and frequency tracking, and die like. The receivers 728 can supply pilot and data symbols to corresponding paths of a digital signal processor (DSP) 730 that performs symbol demodulation and/or other signal processing.<br>
[0050] In various embodiments, implementations, and designs, the low noise amplifier 702 and/or other low noise amplifiers that can be incorporated into various wireless communication devices 700 may be implemented using any suitable semiconductor technology. Appropriate semiconductor technologies may include Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS), Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET), Metal Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MESFET), Silicon-Carbon (SiQ MESFET, Gallium-Arsenide (GaAs) MESFET, Lateral Diffusion MOSFET (LDMOS FET), Silicon (Si) LDMOS FET, Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (HBT), GaAs HBT, Indium Phosphide (InP) HBT, Silicon Germanium (SiGe) HBT, Indium Gallium Phosphide (InGaP) HBT, High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT), Aluminum Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs) pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistor (pHEMT), GaAs pHEMT, Aluminum Gallium Nitride/ Gallium Nitride) AlGaN/GaN HEMT, and Aluminum Gallium Arsenide / Indium Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs/lnGaAs) HEMT.<br>

Each RF interface between a base station 804A - D and a subscriber unit 802A - D includes a forward link signal transmitted from a base station 804A - D and a reverse link signal transmitted from the subscriber unit 802A - D. Using the RF interfaces, a communication with another user is generally conducted through a mobile telephone switching office (MTSO) 806 and a public switch telephone network (PSTN) 808. The links between the base stations 804A - D, mobile telephone switching office (MTSO) 806, and public switch telephone network (PSTN) 808 are typically formed via wire connections, although the use of additional RF or microwave links may otherwise or additionally be used.<br>
