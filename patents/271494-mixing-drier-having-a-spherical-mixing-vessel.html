				<td>Mixing Drier having a spherical mixing vessel<br>
The present invention concerns a mixing drier according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Such mixing driers are used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical or chemical<br>
products such as medicaments or foodstuffs. Mixing driers are well known in the art<br>
and are described for example in EP-1'118'381. These devices comprise a container<br>
having the form of a body of revolution which consists of two separable half shells<br>
having an essentially horizontal separation plane. The upper half shell protrudes<br>
through the roof of the production chamber in order to be able to arrange the motor<br>
units for the stirrer or the chopper above the production chamber and spatially<br>
separated from this chamber. Removal of the processed charge is enabled via a<br>
charge outlet in the lower half shell. For cleaning, the lower half shell can be pivoted<br>
downwards by means of a hinge or can be vertically repositioned downwards and<br>
pivoted horizontally.. In order to be able to arrange the charge outlet at the lowest<br>
point of the vessel, the shaft of the stirrer is inclined at about 20째 in relation to the<br>
vertical axis.<br>
Unfortunately, cleaning the upper half shell in such an assembly has proven to be<br>
laborious, that is to say that it cannot be cleaned thoroughly because when the<br>
vessel is opened, either the one or the other mixing element of the stirrer protrudes<br>
into the upper half shell.<br>
It is therefore the aim of the present invention to provide a mixing drier having the<br>
charge outlet arranged in the lowest part of the vessel, thereby enabling the inner<br>
walls to be thoroughly cleaned in an easy manner.<br>
This aim is achieved according to the invention by a mixing drier in the form of a<br>
spherical mixer having the features of claim 1, and in particular by a mixing drier<br>
whose stirrer axis is inclined in relation to the vertical axis, and whose separation<br>
plane lies between the two vessel shells orthogonally in relation to the stirrer axis,<br>
and whereby the mixing elements do not extend above the lower vessel shell.<br><br>
Further preferred embodiments of the invention exhibit the features of the dependent<br>
claims.<br>
Advantageously, the stirrer axis is inclined by 14째 to 18째 and preferably by 16째 in<br>
relation to the vertical plane, and both vessel shells are pivotable in relation to each<br>
other by means of a hinge. It is particularly advantageous that the hinge is arranged<br>
within or above the separation plane and below the equatorial plane. Furthermore, in<br>
a preferred embodiment, the mixing elements are provided with conveying channels<br>
in which a hot fluid, for example water steam, may circulate and so heat the mixing<br>
elements.<br>
The advantages of the mixing drier according to the invention are clearly apparent to<br>
the expert. On the one hand, the inclination of the stirrer allows for an improved<br>
mixing of the charge. At the same time, the orthogonal arrangement of the separation<br>
plane in relation to the stirrer axis, together with the appropriately dimensioned<br>
mixing elements, allow the upper vessel shell to be opened for complete exposure.<br>
The invention shall be described in more detail with the aid of the Figure and an<br>
exemplary embodiment.<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross-section through a mixing drier according to the invention.<br>
The mixing drier shown in Figure 1 in the form of a spherical drier 1 essentially<br>
comprises two vessel shells 2, 3. In the illustrated embodiment, the upper vessel<br>
shell 2 extends through a floor 4 which separates a machine room 5 from a<br>
production room 6, so as to completely prevent any contamination from the machine<br>
room 5 from entering the production room 6. A stirrer 7, a feed nozzle 8 as well as<br>
machine adapters 9, 10 are secured in the region of the upper vessel shell 2 facing<br>
the machine room. The stirrer 7, its stirrer shaft 11 and its stirring elements 12, 12',<br>
12" extend into the lower vessel shell 3. An outlet valve 13 is arranged at the lowest<br>
part of the lower vessel shell 3. According to the invention, both the vessel shells 2, 3<br>
are closable in a separation plane T, whereby this separation plane T lies essentially<br>
orthogonally in relation to the stirrer axis R, i.e. is inclined towards the horizontal<br>
equatorial plane H. This separation plane T can also be regarded as the delimitation<br><br>
surface of the envelope of movements of the stirring elements 12, 12', 12". It has<br>
proven to be particularly beneficial that the hinge 14 can be arranged in this<br>
separation plane T, because this allows the contour of the stirring elements 12, 12',<br>
12" to follow the inner contour of the vessel B more precisely, i.e. with the least<br>
tolerance. It is understood that a closure device 15 is arranged on the side facing the<br>
hinge 14.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present spherical mixer 1 (spherical drier) the stirrer<br>
shaft 11 and the stirring elements 12, 12', 12" are provided with channels which allow<br>
a hot fluid 16 to circulate therein. Essential for the invention is that the stirring<br>
elements 12, 12', 12" do not extend above the lower vessel shell 3 or the separation<br>
plane T in order to ensure that when the vessel B is opened, these stirring elements<br>
12, 12', 12" completely expose the inner surface of the upper vessel shell 2.<br>
In practice, the vessels of such spherical driers have a volume of between 400 to<br>
4'000 liters. In particular, they are used in the production of granulates or powder-like<br>
substances for the pharmaceutical or foodstuff industry, which means that high<br>
standards of cleanliness are expected.<br><br>
