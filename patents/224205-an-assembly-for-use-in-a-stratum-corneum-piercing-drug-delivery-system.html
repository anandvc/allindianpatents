				<td>MICROPROTRUSION MEMBER RETAINER FOR IMPACT APPLICATOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The invention relates to an apparatus and method for applying a<br>
microprotrusion member to the stratum corneum by impact, and more<br>
particularly, the invention relates to a retainer for mounting a microprotrusion<br>
member having a plurality of microprotrusions on an impact applicator device<br>
to reproducibly penetrate the stratum corneum with microprotrusions.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] Interest in the percutaneous or transdermal delivery of peptides<br>
and proteins to the human body continues to grow with the increasing number<br>
of medically useful peptides and proteins becoming available in large<br>
quantities and pure form. The transdermal delivery of peptides and proteins<br>
still faces significant problems. In many instances, the rate of delivery or flux<br>
of polypeptides through the skin is insufficient to produce a desired<br>
therapeutic effect due to their large size and molecular weight In addition,<br>
polypeptides and proteins are easily degraded during and after penetration<br>
into the skin, prior to reaching target cells. Likewise, the passive transdermal<br>
flux of many tow molecular weight compounds is too limited to be<br>
therapeutically effective.<br>
[0003] One method of increasing the transdermal delivery of agents<br>
relies on pretreating the skin with, or co-delivering with the beneficial agent, a<br>
skin permeation enhancer. A permeation enhancer substance, when applied<br>
to a body surface through which the agent is delivered, enhances the<br>
transdermal flux of the agent such as by increasing the permselectivisty and/or<br>
permeability of the body surface, and/or reducing the degradation of the<br>
agent.<br>
[0004] Another method of increasing the agent flux involves the<br>
application of an electric current across the body surface referred to as<br>
"electrotransport" "Electrotransport" refers generally to the passage of a<br>
beneficial agent, eg,a drug cr drug precursor, through a body surface, such<br>
as skin, mucous membranes, nails, and the tike. The transport of the agent is<br><br>
induced or enhanced by the application of an electrical potential, which results<br>
in the application of electric current, which delivers or enhances delivery of the<br>
agent. Electrotransport delivery generally increases agent delivery and<br>
reduces polypeptide degradation during transderma' delivery<br>
[0005] There also nave been many attempts to mechanically penetrate<br>
or disrupt the skin in order to enhance the transdermal flux, such as, U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,879,326 issued to Godshall, et al., 3,814,097 issued to<br>
Ganderton. el al., 5,279.544 issued to Gross, et al., 5,250,023 issued to Lee,<br>
et al., 3,964,482 issued to Gerstel, et al., Reissue 25,637 issued to Kravitz, et<br>
al., and PCT Publication Nos. WO 96/37155, WO 96/37256, WO 96/17648,<br>
WO 97/03718, WO 98/11937, WO 98/00193. WO 97/48440, WO 97/48441,<br>
WO 97/48442, WO 98/00193, WO 99/64580, WO 98/28037, WO 98/29298,<br>
and WO 98/29365. These devices use piercing elements or microprotrusions<br>
of various shapes and sizes to pierce the outermost layer (i.e., the stratum<br>
corneum) of the skin The microprotrusions disclosed in these references<br>
generally extend peroendicularly from a thin, flat member, such as a pad or<br>
sheet. The microprotrusions.in some of these devices are extremely small,<br>
some having dimensions (i.e., a microblade length and width) of only about 25<br>
- 400 µm and a microblade thickness of only about 5 - 50 µm. Other<br>
penetrating elements are hollow needles having diameters of about 10 µm or<br>
less and lengths of about 50-100 µm. These tiny stratum corneum<br>
piercing/cutting elements are meant to make correspondingly small<br>
microslits/microcuts in the stratum corneum for enhanced transdermal agent<br>
delivery or transdermal body anafyte sampling therethrough. The perforated<br>
skin provides improved flux for sustained agent delivery or sampling through<br>
the skin. In many instances, the microslits/microcuts in the stratum corneum<br>
have a length of less than 150 µm and a width which is substantially smaller<br>
than their length.<br>
[0006] When microprotrusion arrays are used to improve delivery or<br>
sampling of agents through the skin, consistent, complete, and repeatable<br>
microprotrusion penetration is desired. Manual application of a skin patch<br>
including microprotrusions often results in significant variation in puncture<br>
depth across the microprotrusion array. In addition, manual application<br>
results in large variations n puncture depth between applications due to the<br>
manner in which the user applies the array. Accordingly, it would be desirable<br>
to be able to apply a microprotrusion array to the stratum corneum with an<br>
automatic device which provides microprotrusion skin piercing penetration in a<br>
consistent and repeatabte manner.<br>
[0007] Another problem with microprotrusron arrays concerns their<br>
handling by the user or a medical technician. Those microprotrusion arrays<br>
having the form of a thin, flat pad or sheet having a plurality of<br>
microprotrusions extending roughly perpendicular therefrom are especially<br>
difficult to handle manually without piercing the skin of the handler's fingers.<br>
Even if an automatic applicator is used to apply the microprotrusion array to<br>
the patient, the microprotrusion array must still be mounted on the applicator.<br>
However, during mounting or loading of the microprotrusion array onto an<br>
automatic applicator device sterility of the microprotrusions may be<br>
compromised or injury to the user may occur.<br>
[0008] Accordingly it would, be desirable to provide a retainer for<br>
holding a microprotrusion member for connection to a reusable impact<br>
applicator device for applying the microprotrusion member to the stratum<br>
corneurn.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[00016] An applicator system for applying a microprotrusion member as<br>
described below includes an impact applicator device for applying the<br>
microprotrusion member to the stratum corneum and a retainer for holding<br>
and protecting the microprotrusion member during storage and handling prior<br>
to impact against the skin. The retainer is shaped and configured to be<br>
mounted on the impact applicator. The retainer and microprotrusion member<br>
are preferably packaged together in an assembled condition. The retainer<br>
allows the microprotrusion member to be easily loaded on the applicator<br>
device without risk of inadvertent contact with the microprotrusions. The<br>
retainer and package also prevent contamination, folding, or other damage to<br>
the microprotrusion member prior to application, and eliminates any<br>
requirement that an operator use special techniques including hand washing,<br>
gloving, sterilized instruments, etc. when handling the microprotrusion<br>
member.<br>
[00017] The applicator system of the present invention has particular<br>
utility in the form of a reusable impact applicator and a single use<br>
microprotrusion member. In such a configuration, the retainer is adapted to<br>
be removably mounted on the impact applicator. After the microprotrusion<br>
member has been applied to (i.e.. impacted against) the skin of the patient,<br>
the now empty retainer can be removed from the applicator and subsequently<br>
a new retainer/microprotrusion member assembly mounted on the applicator<br>
This provides cost benefits since the cost of the applicator can be spread over<br>
many microprotrusion member applications (as opposed to a single<br>
application in the case of a single use/completely disposable applicator and<br>
retainer and microprotrusion member assembly).<br>
[00018] FIG. 1 illustrates a system for applying a microprotrusion<br>
member to the stratum corneum. The system includes an impact applicator<br>
10, a retainer 34, and a microprotrusion member 44. The applicator 10 is<br>
preferably reusable while the retainer 34 and microprotrusion member 44 are<br>
preferably for one time use. As shown in FIG. 1, the retainer 34 and<br>
microprotrusion member 44 are packaged together in a preferably sterile<br>
package lOO having a removable cover 102. After removing the cover 102. a<br>
skin proximal end 13 of the applicator 10 is inserted in an open skin distal end<br>
40 of retainer 34 in order to removably mount the retainer 34 on the applicator<br>
10. Thus, the applicator 10 and the retainer 34 have a configuration which<br>
allows the retainer to be mounted-directly onto the applicator while still in the<br>
package 100.<br>
[00019] Alternatively, the outer housing of retainer 34 can in part act as<br>
the sealed package for microprotrusion member 44. In this embodiment the<br>
open ends of retainer 34 are sealed by removable/peetable seals 150, as<br>
shown in FIG. 13.<br>
[00020] FIG. 2 is an exploded view of the microprotrusion member 44,<br>
the retainer 34, and the package 100 The retainer 34 has a skin distal end<br>
40 which is configured to engage the skin proximal end 14 of the applicator<br>
10. A skin proximal end 42 of the retainer 34 provides a stratum corneum<br>
contacting surface. The retainer 34 includes a shoulder 60, positioned<br>
between ends 40 and 42. for mounting the microprotrusion member 44. The<br>
microprotrusion member 44 is connected by frangible sections 62 to a ring 64<br>
having an adhesive coated on a skin proximal surface thereof. Though shown<br>
as a continuous circle ring 64 could be configured instead as a plurality of<br>
discontinuous tabs spaced circumferentially around member 44 The tabs<br>
would be extensions of frangible sections 62 and partially extend peripherally<br>
about member 44, the tabs being sufficient in number and area to properly<br>
secure the tabs, member 44 and frangible sections 62 to retainer 34 The<br>
microprotrusion member is shown more clearly in FIG. 7. The ring 64 having<br>
adhesive is adhered to the shoulder 60 to secure the microprotrusion member<br>
to the retainer 34, as shown in FIG. 6. In this manner, the patch 44 is<br>
suspended in the retainer 34 and protected from unintentional contact by the<br>
user.<br>
[00021] According to one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
microprotrusion member 44 includes a base material or web or a flexible<br>
material having the microprotrusions mounted thereon. The web includes a<br>
central section having the array of microprotrusions thereon. An adhesive<br>
section of the web surrounds the central section and adheres the<br>
microprotrusion member to the stratum comeum upon application. The web<br>
also includes the frangible sections 62 surrounding the adhesive section and<br>
an outer portion or ring 64 of web material located peripherally around the<br>
frangible sections which is attached to the retainer 34. FIGS. 2 and 7<br>
illustrate four evenly spaced frangible sections 62 However, other number<br>
and arrangements of the frangible sections 62 may be used.<br>
[00022] Other releasabie mounting systems for mounting the<br>
microprotrusion member 44 within the retainer 34, shown in FIGS. 8 to 10,<br>
can be used as long as the force or energy needed to release the member 44<br>
from the retainer 34 can be adequately provided by the energy source (in<br>
applicator 10, the energy source is spring 20) in the appiicator 10. Alternative<br>
means for releasably mounting microprotrusion member 44 within retainer 34<br>
are illustrated in FIGS. 8 to 10 and include an interference fit in which the<br>
member 44 is trapped by a pressed-in ring, friction fitting the member 44<br>
within retainer 34. and adhering member 44 within retainer 34 using an<br>
adhesive with a low bond strength<br><br>
[00023] FIG. 8 illustrates a retainer 34a having a press-in ring 154 which<br>
traps an edge of a microprotrusion member 44a between shoulder 60a and<br>
ring 154.<br>
FIG. 9 shows a retainer 34b without a shoulder and a microprotrusion<br>
member 44b which is relatively rigid and forms a press fit within the retainer<br>
34b. FIG 9A shows retainer 34b with shoulder 60b at a point where the inner<br>
diameter of retainer 34b has been enlarged. This is at a point slightly below<br>
where microprotrusior. member 44b has been press fit. This enlarged<br>
diameter facilitates the release of microprotrusion member 44b once it has<br>
been forced past the section of the narrow diameter.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates an alternative embodiment of a retainer 34c with an<br>
inverted shoulder 60c having a microprotrusion member 44c attached to the<br>
shoulder by a low bond strength adhesive which releases during application of<br>
the microprotrusion member 44c to the stratum corneum. This embodiment<br>
would require no frangible sections 62.<br>
[00024] The manner in which the microprotrusion member 44 is<br>
mounted in the retainer 34 and the location of the patch may vary. For<br>
example, the microprotrusion member 44 may be positioned adjacent the skin<br>
proximal end 42 of the retainer 34. In addition, the microprotrusion member<br>
44 may be secured within the retainer 34 by trapping the ring 64 between two<br>
cooperating parts of the retainer 34.<br>
[00025] The retainer 34 is preferably attached to the applicator 10 after<br>
cocking of the piston 14. The retainer 34 can be attached by a snap in<br>
connection requiring less force to snap in than the force required to release<br>
the piston.<br>
[00026] The retainer 34 may. also be attached to the applicator 10 by a<br>
bayonet fitting (FIG. 14) which allows retainer 34 to twist onto the applicator<br>
body. Another to attached retainer 34 is a slide on fitting (FIG. 15) which<br>
allows retainer 34 to slide onto the applicator body 12 in a direction normal to<br>
the axis of the applicator.<br>
[00027] Yet another way of mounting the retainer within the applicator is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 16. FIG. 16 illustrates another embodiment of a hand<br>
operated spring-loaded applicator having an end 212 adapted to contact the<br>
skin of the patient. Adjacent to end 212 is a slot 214 through which the<br>
retainer 234 can be inserted. Like retainer 34. retainer 234 also has a ring-<br>
shaped configuration. Mounted within the retainer 234 is a microprotrusion<br>
member 244, which is connected to retainer 234 by a plurality of frangible<br>
connects 262 which a. e connected to a plurality of tabs 264. Tabs 264 are<br>
coated with adhesive on the skin proximal side which facilitates the<br>
attachment of tabs 264 to retainer 234. A finger grip 236 is preferably<br>
provided in one section of retainer 234 in order to provide a convenient place<br>
for grasping retainer 234 and to help prevent inadvertent contact between the<br>
user's fingers and the microprotrusions in member 244. After inserting the<br>
retainer 234 into slot 214, the user places edge 212 against the skin surface<br>
to be treated. Then, cap 216 is pressed towards the skin causing the piston<br>
(not shown) to be released and impact the microprotrusion member 244<br>
against the skin.<br>
[00028] In order to apply a microprotrusion member 44 according to the<br>
present invention, the package 100 of FIG. 1 is opened by removing the<br>
releasable film cover 102. Then, the retainer 34 is attached to the applicator<br>
10. An outside surface of the retainer 34 can be handled without contacting<br>
the microprotrusion member 44. Thus, contamination of the microprotrusion<br>
member 44 and inadvertent exposure of the physician, nurse, medical<br>
technician or even the patient to the microprotrusions and any drugs<br>
contained thereon, are prevented: The applicator device 10 with the retainer<br>
34 mounted thereon is then ready for use to pierce the stratum corneum. The<br>
skin proximal end 42 of the retainer 34 is placed against the stratum corneum<br>
and pressed down with a force which causes piston 14 of the applicator to be<br>
released. The microprotrusion member 44 is separated from the retainer 34<br>

reference. The microprotruston array of FIG. 3 without.a reservoir may also<br>
be applied alone as a skin pretreatment.<br>
[00030] The term "microprotrusion" as used herein refers to very tiny<br>
stratum corneum piercing elements typically having a length of about 10-500<br>
µm1 and preferably about 50-400 µm, which make a penetration in the stratum<br>
corneum In order to penetrate the stratum corneum, the microprotrusions<br>
preferably have a length of at least 10 urn. more preferably at least 50 µrn.<br>
The microprotrusions may be formed in different shapes, such as needles,<br>
hollow needles, blades, pins, punches, and combinations thereof.<br>
[00031] The term "microprotrusion array" as used herein refers to a<br>
plurality of microprotrusions arranged in an array for piercing the stratum<br>
corneum. The microprotrusion array may be formed by cutting a plurality of<br>
blades from a thin sheet and folding each of the blades out of the plane of the<br>
sheet to form the configuration shown in FIG. 3. The microprotrusion array<br>
may also be formed in other known manners, such as by connecting multiple<br>
strips having microprotrusions along an edge of each of the strips. The<br>
microprotrusion array may include hollow needles, for example hollow<br>
needles adapted to inject a liquid formulation.<br>

[00033] FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate one exemplary embodiment of an<br>
applicator 10 for use with the retainer 34 of the present invention. However,<br>
other applicator configurations may also be used with the retainers which are<br>
described herein.<br>
[00034] The applicator 10 includes a body 12 and a piston 14 movable<br>
within the body. A cap 16 is provided on the body 12 for activating the<br>
applicator to impact the stratum corneum with the microprotrusion member<br>
44. An impact spring 20 is positioned around a post 22 of the piston 14 and<br>
biases the piston downward (i.e., towards the skin) with respect to the body<br>
12. The piston 14 has an impact surface 18 which is substantially planar,<br>
slightly convex, or configured to match the contours of a particular body<br>
surface. The surface 18 of the piston 14 impacts the microprotrusion member<br>
44 against the skin causing the microprotrusions 90 to pierce the stratum<br>
corneum.<br>
[00035] FIG. 4 shows the piston 14 in the cocked position. When the<br>
applicator is cocked, the piston 14 is pressed up inside the body 12 and<br>
locked in place by a locking mechanism. The locking mechanism includes a<br>
stop 26 on the post 22 and a flexible finger 28 on tne body 12 having a<br>
corresponding stop 30. As the piston 14 is moved toward the body 12<br>
compressing the impact spring 20, the stop 26 flexes the finger 23 and snaps<br>
over the corresponding stop 30 of the flexible finger. The cocking step is<br>
performed by a single compression motion which both cocks and locks the<br>
piston 14 in the cocked position.<br>
[00036] As shown in FIG. 4, in the cocked position, catch 26 and latch<br>
30 on the piston 14 and body 12 are releasably engaged, preventing<br>
downward motion cf the piston in the body. FIG. 4 also illustrates the patch<br>
retainer 34 mounted on the body 12.<br>
[00037] The applicator 10 has been described for use with a<br>
microprotrusion member 44. The microprotrusion member 44 may be a patch<br>
which generally includes a microprotrusion array, an agent reservoir,<br>
and a backing. However, the applicator 10 may also be used with a<br>
microprotrusion member 44 without an agent reservoir. In this case, the<br>
microprotrusion member is used as a pretreatment which is followed by the<br><br>
application of an agent with a separate device Alternatively, the<br>
microprotrusion member 44 may incorporate the agent as a coating on the<br>
microprotrusion array, e.g. for delivering a vaccine intradermally.<br>
[00038] The activation of the applicator 10 by releasing the locking<br>
mechanism is performed by downward force applied to the applicator cap 16<br>
while the end 42 of the applicator is held against the skin. The cap 16 is<br>
biased in a direction away from the skin by a hold down spring 24 which is<br>
positioned between toe body 12 and the cap. The cap 16 includes a pin 46<br>
extending downward from the cap. When the cap 16 is pressed downward<br>
against the bias of the hold down spring 24, the pin 46 contacts ramp 48 on<br>
flexible finger 28 moving the flexible finger outward and disengaging latch 30<br>
of the flexible finger 28 from catch 26. This releases piston 14 and the piston<br>
moves downward impacting the stratum corneum with the microprotrusion<br>
member 44. The impact is applied substantially parallel to a central axis of<br>
the microprotrusion member 44.<br>
[00039] FIG. 5 illustrates the applicator 10 after the device has been<br>
activated and a microprotrusion member 44 has been applied 4o the stratum<br>
corneum. The hold down spring 24 is selected such that a predetermined<br>
hold down force must be achieved before the device is activated. The hold<br>
down force causes the stratum corneum to be stretched by the surface 42 of<br>
the retainer 34 so that the skin is under optima! tension at the time the<br>
microprotrusion member 44 impacts the skin. The hold down force applied by<br>
the hold down sprirg 24 is preferably selected to cause the surface 42 to<br>
apply a tension to the skin in the range of about 0.01 to 10 megapascals<br>
(MPa), more preferably about 0.05 to 2 MPa.<br>
[00040] A balance between the hold down spring 24 and the impact<br>
spring 20 allows the cocking of the piston 14 by pressing on the cap 16<br>
without causing the finger 46 to release the locking mechanism. The impact<br>
spring 20 is selected to achieve a predetermined impact which is appropriate<br>
for a particular patch to provide the desired microprotrusion penetration, in<br>
general, the microprotrusion member 44 is impacted against human skin with<br>
a power of af least 0.05 joules per cm2 in 10 msec or less, preferably with<br>
power of at least 0.1 jnules per cm2 of microprotrusion member in 1 msec or<br>
less.<br>
[00041] The applicator 10 according to the present invention has been<br>
described with respect to an orientation in which the skin proximal side of the<br>
device is shown at the bottom of the figures. It should be understood that the<br>
applicator device may be used in other orientations (e.g., sideways or upside<br>
down) from that shown in the figures.<br>
[00042] FIGS. 11 and 12 illustrate an alternative embodiment of the<br>
invention including a retainer 134 which is releasably mounted on a piston<br>
122 of the impact applicator 110. The retainer 134 includes a disk shaped<br>
head 136 and a shaft 138. The shaft 138 includes a detent 140 or projection<br>
which allows the shaft to snap into a corresponding recess 142 in piston 122<br>
of the applicator 110. The disk shaped head 136 has a microprotrusion<br>
member application surface 137 with the microprotrusion member releasably<br>
fixed to the application surface 137 by adhesive or other means. If adhesive<br>
is used to fix the microprotrusion member 144 to the retainer 134, the<br>
adhesive used holds the microprotrusion member less securely than an<br>
adhesive which secures the microprotrusion member 144 to the skin. A<br>
package 100 avoids damage to the microprotrusion member 144 during<br>
shipping and storage and also can serve the function of a release liner.<br>
[00043] In order to apply a microprotrusion member 144 according to the<br>
embodiment of FIGS. 11 and 12, the package 100 is opened by removing the<br>
releasable film cover 102. Then the retainer 134 is attached to the applicator<br>
device 110 by inserting the shaft 138 into the recess 142 in the applicator<br>
device 110. The package 100 is then removed leaving retainer 134<br>
releasabfy engaged to applicator device 110. Applicator device 110 is now<br>
ready for application of the microprotrusion member 144 to the stratum<br>
corneum. The microprotrusion member 144 is then applied to the stratum<br>
corneum by the impact applicator device 110. The applicator device 110 and<br>
the attached retainer 134 are moved away from the stratum corneum leaving<br>
the microprotrusion member 144 impacted on the stratum corneum.<br>
[00044] The device of the present invention can be used in connection<br>
with agent delivery, agent sampling or both In particular, the device of the<br><br>
present invention is used in connection with transdermal drug delivery,<br>
transdermal analyte sampling, or both Transdermal delivery devices for use<br>
with the present invention include, but are not limited to passive devices,<br>
osmotic devices, pressure-driven devices, and electrotransport devices.<br>
Transdermal sampling devices for use with the present invention include, but<br>
are not limited to, passive devices, negative pressure driven devices, osmotic<br>
devices, and reverse electrotransport devices. The transdermal devices of<br>
the present invention may be used in combination with other methods of<br>
increasing agent flux, such as skin permeation enhancers.<br>
[00045] The device of the present invention may be used with a<br>
microprotrusion array included in a transdermal delivery or sampling patch<br>
having adhesive for attaching the patch to the skin. Alternatively, the<br>
microprotrusion member and delivery or sampling patch may be two separate<br>
elements with the microprotrusion member used for pretreatment prior to<br>
application of the delivery or sampling patch<br>
[00046] While the invention has been described in detail with reference<br>
