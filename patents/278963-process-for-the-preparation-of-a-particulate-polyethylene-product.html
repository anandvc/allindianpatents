				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A PARTICULATE POLYETHYLENE<br>
PRODUCT<br>
Technical field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a particulate polyethylene product. According to the invention, polyethylene products are prepared in a polymerization loop reactor, wherein the polymerization is catalyzed by a metallocene-alumoxane catalyst which is heterogeneously distributed on an inert support.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Polyethylene (PE) is synthesized by polymerizing ethylene (CH2=CH2) monomers. Because it is cheap, safe, stable to most environments and easy to be processed polyethylene polymers are useful in many applications. According to the properties polyethylene can be classified into several types, such as but not limited to LDPE (Low Density Polyethylene), LLDPE (Linear Low Density Polyethylene), and HOPE (High Density Polyethylene). Each type of polyethylene has different properties and characteristics.<br>
Ethylene polymerizations are frequently earned out in a loop reactor using ethylene monomer, liquid diluent and catalyst, optionally one or more co-monomer(s), and hydrogen. The polymerization in a loop reactor is usually performed under slurry conditions, with the produced polymer usually in a form of solid particles which are suspended in the diluent. The slurry in the reactor is circulated continuously with a pump to maintain efficient suspension of the polymer solid particles in the liquid diluent. Polymer sluny is discharged from the loop reactor by means of settling legs, which operate on a batch principle to recover the slurry. Settling in the legs is used to increase the solids concentration of the sluny finally recovered as product slurry. The product slurry is further discharged through heated flash lines to a flash tank, where most of the diluent and unreacted monomers are flashed off and recycled.<br>
Polymerization of ethylene involves the polymerization of ethylene monomer in the reactor in the presence of a polymerization catalyst. Suitable catalysts for the preparation of polyethylene comprise chromium-type catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts and metallocene catalysts.<br>
The use of metallocene catalysts for polymerization and copolymerization of ethylene is a relatively recent development. Processes for producing polyolefins in general and polyethylene in particular in the presence of metallocene catalysts have been<br>
2<br>
 <br>
described. Metallocenes are often combined with activating agents sucti as alumoxanes, to improve the catalytic activity of the metallocene.<br>
A supported metallocene-alumoxane polymerization catalyst essentially comprises an inert support or carrier such as silica, on which alumoxane and metallocene are coated. In many applications for the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene, a porous support is used. The properties of such porous supports such as pore density or surface area greatly influence the physicochemical characteristics of the final polyolefin product. An increased surface area of a porous support compared to a non-porous support in theory leads to an increase in bound catalytically active sites.<br>
Major objectives of a plant for producing polyethylene and its copolymers include the preparation of polymers having physical properties within certain specifications and the optimization of economical goals such as a specific catalyst consumption and the production rate of the plant. That is, it is desired to minimize the consumption of catalyst per ton of produced polymer, this leading to increased catalyst productivity and to a reduction in the amount of catalyst residue in the product, as well as to the maximization of the amount of polymer produced per hour.<br>
However, although polymerization reactions in the presence of metallocene-alumoxane polymerization catalysts supported on porous supports yield polymerization products with improved physico-mechanical properties, such as unifomiity, miscibility, density or molecular weight distribution, compared to polymerization reactions in the presence of non-supported catalysts, the catalyst activity of such supported catalysts is believed to be generally lower than the catalyst activity of non-supported catalysts. Hence, lower amounts of polymer per given amount of catalyst can be produced in the presence of catalysts supported on porous supports than when carrying out polymerization reactions in the presence of non-supported catalysts.<br>
Moreover, when carrying out polymerization reactions in the presence of catalyst having low catalyst activity, higher amounts of catalyst have to be used for preparing a given amount of polymer product. In view thereof, higher amounts of catalyst may remain in the prepared polymer products, and hence such polymers may contain higher ash content. Especially, when using metallocene catalyst problems related to insuffident catalyst activity, and consequences thereof in the resulting polymer products such as to elevated ash content, may occur. For applications in food packaging or dielectric materials, high ash content is unwarranted. In these kinds of applications removal of the ash content in the polymer product needs to be carried out post-production, for instance<br>
3<br>
 <br>
by applying various washing and extraction techniques, which are costly and time-consuming.<br>
In view of the alxjve, many applications which make use of catalyst systems provided on porous supports still require improved catalyst activity to increase productivity of the polymerization reaction and hence to increase the amount of polymer product produced. Hence there remains a need in the art to provide a polymerization process for making polyolefin resin, and in particular polyethylene resin using supported catalyst having improved productivity.<br>
It is also a need in the art to improve polymerization reactions as to reduce ash content of produced polymers which can then be used in various impurity-sensitive applications at minimal investment of additional cost and time.<br>
In view of the above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a polymerization process for making polyolefin resin using a supported catalyst having improved activity. It is in particular an object to provide a polymerization process for making polyethylene using a supported metallocene-alumoxane catalyst having improved activity.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing polyethylene that is carried out in the presence of a supported metallocene-alumoxane catalyst in a loop reactor. The present process is at least in part based on the use of a supported metallocene-alumoxane catalyst whereby the alumoxane is heterogeneously distributed on a porous support. The process according to the invention permits to prepare polyethylene by means of a polymerization catalyst having increased catalytic activity, and hence provides a polymerization product having acceptable properties and reduced ash content.<br>
Thereto, the invention relates in a first aspect to a process for preparing a particulate polyethylene product in a polymerization loop reactor, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	feeding ethylene monomer, a liquid hydrocarbon diluent, optionally hydrogen, and optionally olefin co-monomer into said loop reactor;<br>
(b)	feeding a polymerization catalyst into said loop reactor;<br>
(c)	polymerizing  said  monomer and  said  optionally  co-monomer to  produce  a polyethylene slurry in said diluent in said loop reactor;<br>
4<br>
 <br>
(d)	allowing said polyethylene sluny to settle into one or more settling legs connected to said loop reactor;<br>
(e)	discharging the settled polyethylene slurry from said one or more settling legs out of said loop reactor;<br>
wherein said polymerization catalyst comprises a particulate metallocene-alumoxane catalyst immobilized on a porous silica support wherein said alumoxane is heterogeneously distributed.<br>
According to an embodiment the invention provides a method wherein said polymerization loop reactor is a single loop reactor.<br>
In another embodiment the invention provides a method wherein said polymerization loop reactor is a loop reactor of a double loop reactor consisting of two serially connected loop reactors. In an example, said the invention provides a method wherein said polymerization loop reactor, as described above, is a first reactor of a double loop reactor.<br>
The molar ratio of aluminum, provided by said alumoxane, to transition metal, provided by said metallocene, in said polymerization catalyst is generally homogenous/constant over the complete catalyst particle. Therefore, in another emtx)diment, the invention relates to a process for preparing a particulate polyethylene product in a polymerization loop reactor as given above, wherein said polymerization catalyst comprises a particulate metallocene-alumoxane catalyst immobilized on a porous silica support wherein said metallocene is heterogeneously distributed.<br>
The product recovered in accordance with the process according to the invention is a granular polyethylene product, also named particulate polyethylene product. The term "particulate" in the present context intends to refer to particles. The catalysts which are used in the process according to the invention are metallocene-based catalysts, which have controlled granulometry and properties. IVIore in particular, said metallocene-based catalysts include particulate catalysts comprising a metallocene and an alumoxane which are provided on silica porous support.<br>
The term "heterogeneously" distributed as used herein and as opposed to "homogenously distributed", intends to refer to the feature that the alumoxane component of said catalyst, and thus inherently also said metallocene-alumoxane catalyst, is not evenly distributed throughout said support. Hence the support shows areas or surfaces having significantly more alumoxane, and thus also significantly more metallocene, bound thereto than other areas or surfaces of said support.<br>
5<br>
 <br>
During the polymerization process supported polymerization catalysts, such as metallocene-alumoxane catalysts which are immobilized on an inert support, become fragmented, the fragments becoming distributed throughout the final polymer product. The amounts of the individual residual elements relative to the total amount of polymer product are collectively refen-ed to as the ash content. This is an important parameter as in many end product applications such as food packaging or dielectric materials there are limits on the acceptable amount of ash in the polymer product. There is a demand in the art for polymer product having lower ash content.<br>
It has now been found that a heterogeneous distribution of an activating agent, in particular alumoxane, on an inert porous support, such as silica, increases catalyst activity, and hence increases the amount of final polymer product that can be prepared with a given amount of catalyst.<br>
Also, by using the present polymerization catalyst for preparing a given amount of polymer product, lower amounts of catalyst need to be used, resulting in a lower ash content in the resulting polymer product. Hence, the resulting polymer product will have broader applicability or more potential end uses.<br>
According to the invention, by providing a polymerization catalyst having a Al/Si ratio, wherein the aluminum is provided by the alumoxane and the silicon is provided by the silica support, which is higher outside the support than inside said support, said polymerization catalyst obtains increased activity. In a particular embodiment, the invention provides a process wherein the molar ratio of aluminum, provided by said alumoxane, to silicon, provided by said support, is at least twofold higher at the surface of said support than inside said support. As used herein, the term "outside the support" can be represented as the outer 30% of the volume of the particle, preferably the outer 25% of the volume of the particle, more preferably the outer 10% of the volume of the particle.<br>
In yet another emt)odiment, the invention provides a process wherein the molar ratio of aluminum, provided by said alumoxane, to silicon, provided by said support inside of said support is comprised between 0.2 and 0.8.

In an embodiment, the invention relates to a process as described above wherein said metallocene has formula (I) or (II)<br>
(Ar)2MQ2 (I) for non-bridged metallocenes; or<br>
R"(Ar)2MQ2 (II) for bridged metallocenes<br>
wherein each Ar is independently selected from the group consisting of cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, tetrahydroindenyl, and fluorenyl; and wherein Ar is optionally substituted with one or more substituents each independently selected from the group consisting of halogen, a hydrosilyl, a SiRa wherein R is a hydrocarbyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and a hydrocarbyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and wherein said hydrocarbyl optionally contains one or more atoms selected from the group comprising B, Si, S, O, F, CI and P;<br>

The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a particulate polyethylene product in a loop reactor, comprising the steps of polymerizing ethylene monomer in the presence of a polymerization catalyst whereby said polymerization catalyst comprises a particulate metallocene-alumoxane catalyst immobilized on a porous support. In particular, the invention provides a process for preparing a particulate polyethylene product in a polymerization loop reactor, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	feeding ethylene monomer, a liquid hydrocarbon diluent, optionally hydrogen, and optionally olefin co-monomer into said loop reactor;<br>
(b)	feeding a polymerization catalyst into said loop reactor;<br>
10<br>
 <br>
(c)	polymerizing said  monomer and said  optionally co-monomer to produce a polyethylene slurry in said diluent in said loop reactor;<br>
(d)	allowing said polyethylene slurry to settle into one or more settling legs connected to said loop reactor;<br>
(e)	discharging the settled polyethylene slurry from said one or more settling legs out of said loop reactor;<br>
wherein said polymerization catalyst comprises a particulate metallocene-alumoxane catalyst immobilized on a porous support wherein said alumoxane is heterogeneously distributed on said support. The process is thus in particular characterized in that said alumoxane is heterogeneously distributed on said support. The polymerization catalyst as described herein preferably is a free-flowing and particulate catalyst structure in a form comprising dry particles.<br>
The support or carrier is an inert organic or inorganic solid, which is chemically unreactive with any of the components of the conventional metallocene catalyst. Suitable support materials for the supported catalyst of the present invention include solid inorganic oxides, such as silica, alumina, magnesium oxide, titanium oxide, thorium oxide, as well as mixed oxides of silica and one or more Group 2 or 13 metal oxides, such as silica-magnesia and silica-alumina mixed oxides. Silica, alumina, and mixed oxides of silica and one or more Group 2 or 13 metal oxides are preferred support materials. Preferred examples of such mixed oxides are the silica-aluminas. Most preferred is silica. The silica may be in granular, agglomerated, fumed or other form.<br>
Prior to its use, if desired, the support material may be subjected to a heat treatment and/or chemical treatment to reduce the water content or the hydroxyl content of the support material. Typical thermal pretreatments are carried out at a temperature from 30 to 1000 °C for a duration of 10 minutes to 50 hours in an inert atmosphere or under reduced pressure.<br>
A porous support as provided herein can be considered as comprising a macroscopic (i.e. visible) external surface including the surface of any macrospores; and a (non visible) internal surface, i.e. the surface of pores provided inside said support. According to the invention, the alumoxane is not homogeneously distributed on the porous support. More alumoxane is present on certain areas of the porous support than on other areas of the porous support, i.e. the alumoxane concentration is heterogeneous or not uniform on the porous support, it is in particular preferred that the alumoxane be present in a substantially higher concentration "outside" the support than "inside" the support. By<br>
11<br>
 <br>
"inside" thie support we mean the internal surface area of the support, including the surface lining the pores inside the support. "Inside" is therefore also used as synonym for the expressions "in the pores" of the porous support, or "inner pores" of the porous support. By "outside" the support we mean on the external surface of the support and the surface of any macropores. "Outside" is herein also used as synonym for the "external surface" or the "outer surface" of the porous support.<br>
The concentration or distribution of alumoxane on the inside and the outside of the support can be expressed as the molar aluminum/silicon ratio or molar Al/Si ratio. This is the molar amount of aluminum per mole silicon. The molar amount of aluminum equals the molar amount of alumoxane. The molar amount of silicon equals the molar amount of silica. In an embodiment, the molar Al/Si ratio on the external surface of the porous support is at least twofold, and for instance at least 5, 10 or 20 fold the molar Al/Si ratio inside said support, i.e. in the pores of the porous support.<br>
In an embodiment, the molar Al/Si ratio in the pores of the porous support is comprised between 0.2 and 0.8. In a non-limiting example, the molar Al/Si ratio in the pores of the porous support is 0.2, 0.3,0.4,0.5, 0.6, 0.7, or 0.8.<br>
In another embodiment, the molar Al/Si ratio on the extemal surface of the porous support is comprised between 0.4 and 8, and for instance between 1.5 and 5.<br>
The location or distribution of particles, such as alumoxanes, on a porous support can be measured by various techniques known by a skilled person, such as for instance Scanning Electron Microscope/Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) analysis.<br>
In other embodiments, the support of a polymerization catalyst as defined herein has one or more of the following properties.<br>
In an embodiment, the invention provides a process wherein the support of the polymerization catalyst is a porous silica support having a median particle diameter comprised between 10 and 100 pm, and preferably t&gt;etween 10 and 55pm. The "median particle diameter" as used herein, refers to the particle diameter of the catalyst for which fifty percent of the particles has a diameter lower than the median particle diameter. The "median particle diameter" or "d50" of a catalyst as used herein essentially refer to a same parameter and refer to the particle diameter of the catalyst for which fifty percent of the particles has a diameter lower than the d50. The catalyst's d50 is generally measured by laser diffi'action analysis on a Malvern type analyzer after having put the catalyst in suspension in a solvent such as e.g. cyclohexane.<br>
12<br>
 <br>
In an embodiment, the invention provides a process wherein the support of the polymerization catalyst is a porous support, and preferably a porous silica support having a surface area comprised between 200 and 700 m*/g, and preferably between 250 and 350mVg.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a process wherein the support of the polymerization catalyst is a porous support, and preferably a porous silica support having an average pore volume comprised t»etween 0.5 and 3 ml/g, and preferably between 1 and 2ml/g.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a process wherein the support of the polymerization catalyst is a porous support, and preferably a porous silica support having an average pore diameter comprised between 50 and 300 Angstrom, and preferably between 75 and 220 Angstrom.<br>
Reference will now be made to the polymerization catalyst applied in the process according to the invention.
