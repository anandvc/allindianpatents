				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a Plate and internal nozzle assembly for use in -a distributor in the steel industry.<br>
In continuous steel pouring, a slide shutter is frequently used to control the steel flow between the distributor and one and several continuous pour molds. A slide shutter contains at least one fixed refractory plate installed under a support plate and at least one metal plate free to move with respect to the fixed plate. Each of these plates has at least one hole to allow the steel to pass. The upper plate is used with an internal nozzle that passes through the support plate and the bottom of the distributor.<br>
At the end of the pour sequence, the slag that floats on the steel surface has to be prevented from entering into the mold. This is why the steel shutter is closed when there is still a certain amount of liquid steel, called the salamander, in the distributor.  This salamander cools and solidifies.<br>
Due to the gradual opening up of the hole in the internal nozzle by erosion, the lower end of the solidified steel rod that forms inside the pouring channel up to the mobile plate is in the shape of an elephant's foot which anchors the salamander into the fixed plate of the slide shutter. When the distributor is fitted with several pour lines, each line leads to the formation of a salamander anchored in the distributor. When the distributor is turned over, the steel rod(s) have to be broken so that the salamander can be separated from the distributor.   The internal<br>
nozzle- must be pushed inside the distributor with the salamander. This problem is aggravated when there are several pour lines because the steel contracts while it cools, such that the solidified steel rods tend to move towards each other. Since these rods are cast into the distributor wall, they apply pressure on the part of the distributor located between them.<br>
Furthermore, the fixed plate and the internal nozzle are frequently assembled in a metal casing that seals the nozzle when a neutral gas is injected into the pour channel, and facilitates their manipulation during assembly. The presence of this metal casing reinforces the plate and internal nozzle assembly. It is very difficult to destroy the fixed plate and the internal nozzle when the salamander is pushed towards the inside of the distributor, because this means extruding the metal casing through the orifice provided in the support on which the fixed plate is applied.<br>
The purpose of this invention is to make a plate-internal nozzle assembly which solves this problem.<br>
According to the present invention there is a plate and internal nozzle assembly for use in a distributor in the steel industry, said plate being placed against a support in which there is an orifice, characterized in that it has a central area facing the orifice and a peripheral area applied against the support, the central area and the peripheral area being connected through an area of least resistance such that the central area is separated from the peripheral area by applying a limited force.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the plate and nozzle assembly includes a central area facing the support orifice and a peripheral area applied on the support, the central area and the peripheral area being connected through an area of least resistance such that the central area can be separated from the peripheral area by applying a small force.<br>
According to the first embodiment, a metal casing surrounds the central area and the peripheral area, and the casing includes a weakened area, particularly by punching or notching. As an alternative the casing consists of two separate parts, namely one part partially surrounding the peripheral area and one part partially surrounding the central area.<br>
In the second embodiment, a metal casing partially surrounds the internal nozzle, and a hoop encircles the plate.<br>
In a specific embodiment the internal nozzle contains an outside cylindrical or slightly tapered wall, this wall being surrounded by a metal casing.<br>
In another specific embodiment, the plate contains an insert located in the central part of the plate in which the outside diameter is smaller than the diameter provided in the support plate.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of this invention will become clear when reading the following description of example embodiments given for illustration purposes with the reference to the figures in the appendix.<br>
On these figures:<br>
-	figure  1  is  a  sectional  view  of  a<br>
distributor slide shutter in which a fixed<br>
/L plate/internal nozzle assembly is installed;<br>
	figure 2 is a view of a plate/internal<br>
nozzle  assembly  in  accordance  with  the invention;<br>
-	figures 2a and 2b are detailed views showing variations in the method of construction of the assembly shown in figure 2 ,-<br>
-	figure 3 is a view of a variant of the method of construction shown in figures 1 and 2 ;<br>
-	figure 4 is a view of another method of construction;<br>
-	figures 4a and 4b are detailed views showing alternatives of the method of construction in figure 4;<br>
-	figure 5 is a sectional view of a third embodiment of the invention;<br>
- figure 6 is a sectional view of a fourth embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a sectional view of a continuous pour distributor referred to as reference 2, under which a slide shutter 4 is installed. The distributor 2 consists of a steel wall 6 covered by a refractory coating 8. A seating brick 10 is installed in the coating 8 at the bottom of the distributor. The slide shutter 4 includes a frame 12 fixed under a support plate 13 installed under the distributor.<br>
Three refractory plates are installed in frame 12, namely a fixed upper plate 14, a mobile plate 16 and a fixed lower plate 18.<br>
An internal nozzle 20 is installed with the fixed upper plate 14 in a metal casing 22.   The internal nozzle 20, plates 14, 16 and 18 contain holes that form a  pour  channel  along which  steel  passes  from  the distributor to a continuous pouring mold (not shown). At the end of the pouring sequence, the slag floating on  the  surface  of  the  steel  24  contained  in  the distributor must not pass into the mold.   For this reason, this slide is closed by offsetting the mobile plate 16 with respect to the fixed plate 14 in order to interrupt the continuity of the pour channel.   When this operation is finished, the liquid steel starts to cool and solidify, particularly in the channel of the internal nozzle 20 due to the small diameter of this channel.   Solidified steel forms in it, which anchors salamander 24 in distributor 2.  Due to erosion of the internal nozzle 20 during the pour, the lower end of the solidified steel rod 26 has a tapered shape 28, in the form of an elephant's foot that increases the bond of the salamander.  This is why when the distributor 2 is  turned  over  to  pull  out  the  salamander,  the salamander will not fall but remains attached by the rod(s)  26.   After removing the slide  shutter which<br>
leaves the support plate and the plate-internal nozzle assembly on the distributor, it is then necessary to exert a very high pressure on the steel rod 26 so as to break the fixed plate 14 and the internal nozzle 20, and to extrude the metal casing 22 through the hole 3 0 provided in the support plate 13.<br>
The .purpose  of  the  invention  is  to propose  a plate/internal nozzle assembly that  facilitates  the operation of removing the salamander.   In accordance with the invention,  the plate 14/internal nozzle 20 assembly has a central hole facing the orifice 3 0 in the support plate 13, and a peripheral area applied on support plate 13.  The central area and the peripheral area are connected together through an area of least resistance.  In the example embodiment shown in figure 2, the metal casing 22 has a circular notch 32 at the junction between the fixed plate 14 and the internal nozzle 20.  This notch may be made in the approximately vertical part of the metal casing 22 as shown on figure 2, or on the horizontal part of this casing immediately adjacent to the connection of these two parts.  Due to the presence of this notch, the metal casing 22 easily breaks when a relatively small force is applied on steel rod 26".  The central part of the metal casing 22 penetrates into the distributor.  The peripheral part remains at the outside on the fixed plate.<br>
If the plate 14/internal nozzle 20 assembly is made in two assembled parts, these two parts separate. If the plate 14 and internal nozzle 2 0 are made into an assembly of a single part (monoblock assembly), the refractory material breaks relatively easily. The presence of the notch 32 thus makes it very much easier to remove the salamander.<br>
Figure 2a and 2b show two alternative ways of making the notch 32. On figure 2a, the metal casing 22 is notched on each side of its surface on the vertical<br>
part surrounding the internal nozzle. On figure 2b, the metal casing 22 is notched at the horizontal surface which surrounds the fixed plate 14 .<br>
Figure 3 shows an alternative embodiment of the assembly shown on figures 1 and 2 . In this alternative, the metal casing 22 is stamped at the junction between its horizontal part and its approximately vertical part, in order to form a weak point 3 6.<br>
Figure 4 shows another embodiment of the invention. The metal casing 22 consists of a part 22a that surrounds the internal nozzle 20, and a part 22b which surrounds the fixed plate 14 . These two parts can be separated easily. All that it necessary to remove the salamander is to separate the internal nozzle from plate 14 (two-piece assembly) or to break the refractory material (single-piece assembly) which requires very little force. Figures 4a and 4b show two alternatives of the embodiment shown in figure 4. Part 22b of the metal casing 22 contains a vertical upstand 38. Part 22a of the metal casing applies pressure on the edge of this vertical upstand 38 (figure 4a) or on the inside of the edge 38 (figure 4b).<br>
Figure 5 shows a third embodiment of the invention. The metal casing consists of a single part 22c that surrounds the internal nozzle 20 only. The fixed plate 14 is not surrounded by a metal casing, but simply by a hoop 40. Since the metal casing 22c and the hoop 40 are independent and separate, it is easy to pass the central part of the plate/internal nozzle assembly through the hole 30 formed in plate 13, in exactly the same way as for the embodiment shown in figure 4.<br>
Figure 6 shows a third embodiment of the invention. The outside wall of the nozzle 20 is cylindrical such that the part of the metal casing 22 applied against this external wall is vertical and its cross section is<br>
constant. Furthermore the central part of the fixed plate 14 includes an insert 42. The outside diameter of the insert 42 is smaller than the diameter of the hole 3 0 provided in the support plate 13 . Consequently, the internal nozzle 20 and the insert 42 may easily be pushed towards the inside of the distributor by sliding over the metal causing 22 . The outside part of the fixed plate 14 and the metal casing 22 remain rigidly attached to the slide shutter and the distributor.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
