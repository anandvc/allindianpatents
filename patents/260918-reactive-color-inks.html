REACTIVE COLOR INKS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to reactive color inks.<br>
[0002]   There are many variables that influence the color performance (e.g., OD (optical density) and gamut volume) on media. The colorant type is an obvious factor. Brighter dyes tend to give better colors on paper. However, they are generally less lightfast. Ink and media interaction also plays a major role in the appearance of the color. If inks penetrate into the media, it is expected that the OD/gamut is low. If the ink does not spread well or the dot gain is low, the OD/gamut is generally low. Image and media gloss, in general, helps OD/gamut.<br>
[0003]   A fixer can be used to increase the durability of ink jet inks in terms of water fastness, smear and smudge fastness, by precipitating the colorant. A typical fixer contains a cationic polymer and/or an acid and/or metal salts. Cationic polymers suitable for ink jet application are polyamine (at low pH), quaternized polyamines and polyguanidine. The fixer is used to immobilize dyes and to increase durability and can be applied prior to the image is printed (underprinting) or after the image is printed (overprinting). However, the impact of the fixer on color performance is twofold. Firstly, the formation of fixer-dye complex causes hue shift in many cases. Secondly, depending on what the morphology of the fixer-dye complex is and how fast the rate of fixer-dye precipitation is, fixer-dye interaction determines where the fixer-dye complex resides on media and changes how the colors appear.<br>
[0004]   A solution to the hue shift and change in color appearance is therefore necessary.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0018]    The invention is directed to improve color performance by using different dyes and/or and dye mixtures with an ink vehicle. The basis of the invention is to use a single slow-precipitating dye or a blend of fast and slow precipitating colorants in order to optimize color space and other attributes (such as lightfastness and pen reliability). That is to say, as noted above, a fixer induces precipitation of the colorants. However, the rate of precipitation is colorant dependent. Slow precipitating colorants increase dot size and thus enable better color to be achieved as compared with fast precipitating colorants. If the slow precipitating dye is deficient in a certain attribute, it is possible to optimize the color space (chroma) by blending a slow precipitating colorant with a fast precipitating one.<br>

Test Procedure<br>
Durability<br>
[0025]   An image was printed using a slightly modified HP Business Inkjet 2200 printer manufactured by the Hewlett Packard company. Each of the inks was fixed with either under or over printing using one-pass printmode.<br><br>
Underprinting refers to printing the fixer immediately before inks are printed. Overprinting refers to printing fixer after the inks are printed. Modified HP C4811 pens are used to print inks and fixer at 7pl per 600 dpi each. The printer was operated under heated condition (85°C). Hammermil® and Lustro Laser® paper were used. The Hammermill® paper represents normal plain paper and the Lustro Laser® paper represents a commercially coated glossy paper. For durability, the test was performed 24 hours after the image was printed. The media was set a 45-degree angle where about 250 microliters of water was dripped on the bar image. OD of the bar image ("bar OD") and the drip transfer (optical density of non-imaged area just below the dripped imaged area, "drip transfer OD") were measured. "Bar OD" and "drip transfer OD" are the above measured OD's minus the media OD.<br>
[0026]    Six combinations were printed. These are set forth in the following table.<br><br>
[0027]   The purpose of using the fixer is to improve durability of the printed image. The drip/smear tests were carried out 24 hours after the samples were printed. The bar OD, water drip transfer OD and higher smear transfer OD on both papers were measured.<br>
Color<br>
[0028]    Reflection spectra of CMY and media (white) were measured using a Cary spectrometer. Secondary color spectra (RGB) are estimated based on<br><br>
addition of corresponding secondary colors. Black is the summation of CMY. The spectra were used to calculate L*a*b* for all 8 colors (CMYKRGBW). An estimate of gamut volume was obtained based on the volume enclosed by the 8 colors, although these numbers tended to be an underestimate of a more extensive gamut analysis and system opimization. For instance, incorporation of a black ink will improve the gamut volume significantly.<br>
Summary of Observations<br>
Durability<br>
[0029]   The bar OD, water drip transfer mOD and wet smudge transfer mOD for cyan, magenta and yellow are shown in Figs. 1 - 3 , respectively.<br>
[0030]    For cyan: AB9 itself shows the highest OD, however, the drip performance is not desirable. The PJ485/AB9 mixture shows higher OD and equivalent durability performance compared to PJ485 alone.<br>
[0031]    For magenta: The signal in OD is not as dramatic as in cyan. Most of the dye or dye mixtures show equal or better durability performance than Magenta A except for AR52 (UP and OP) and M377 (OP).<br>
[0032]    For yellow: The dye mixtures show relatively higher OD than individual dyes. AY23 shows some water drip transfer. However, the durability performance of the dye mixtures is acceptable.<br>
Color<br>
[0033]   A list of gamut and % pantone coverage (CMY) is generated with 3 cyan, 6 magenta and 5 yellow dyes/dye mixtures (90 combinations total) on Hammermil and Lustro Laser. The usage of AB9 shows the highest impact on gamut and/or % pantone coverage on both media. The highest gamut volume are listed in the tables shown in Figs. 4 and 5. However, AB9 is not suitable to be the only dye in ink jet inks due to its lack of lightfastness. With dyes that are<br><br>
not lightfast (e.g., AB9 and AY23)t the best set turned out to be PJ485/AB9, Magenta A and DY132/AY23 for UP and OP on both media. The gamut volume is listed in the table shown in Fig. 6. Significant improvement over control in the gamut volume can be achieved by blending the dyes.<br>
Secondary Colors - Green<br>
[0034]   The color calculation performed above does not incorporate input of spectra of secondary colors. The secondaries are calculated based on addition of primary colors. However, this may not the case for green. (Same studies can be done with red and blue as well.) Figs. 7A-7C represent the comparison of calculated spectral OD's and measured spectral OD's for three green samples with fixer underprinting: PJ485 with DY132, AB9 with AY23 and PJ485/AB9 with DY132. The highest discrepancy between the measurements and calculation appears when pure PJ485 is used. Also shown in Figs. 8A-8C are micrographs of the green samples. The PJ485 with DY132 sample shows PJ485 forming discrete solid deposits on a uniform yellow background (top). The size of the deposits becomes smaller when PJ485/AB9 is used and the background is greener (bottom). In the case of AB9 with AY23 (middle), no solid deposits are discernible. Similar trend is also observed with overprinting green samples (spectral OD shown in Figs. 9A-9C), although the effect is not as dramatic as the underprinting samples.<br>
[0035]    The micrographs and the spectral OD data indicate that the addition rule does not hold if the colors do not mix well when printed. Secondly, the micrographs show that the morphology of fixer-dye complex for PJ485 and AB9 are drastically different. The difference in the morphology of the fixer-dye complex on paper could be due to difference in rate of precipitation of fixer-dye complex as determined by a stopflow device.<br><br>
[0036]    In summary, thus far it has been shown that some of the dye blends enhance the color performance without an adverse impact on durability or lightfastness even when the single-dye approach is not possible. For cyan, PJ485/AB9 helps to create a better green than PJ485 due to interesting ink/fixer kinetics as illustrated in the micrographs. In order to achieve higher gamut volume, it is within the scope of the invention to optimize the dye ratio in the mixtures, use 2-pass printing and different vehicles.<br>
[0037]   The following pertains to Magenta Dyes and Dye Blends: Durability, Color and Kinetics.<br>
[0038]    In the following examples, several magenta dyes and some of their dye blends are evaluated regarding to durability and color performance. The various magenta inks are tested in the same manner as what was described earlier.<br>
[0039]   The ink and fixer formulations are as follows:<br>
Magenta Ink<br>
Component	Wt%<br>
Dye	3 (unless noted otherwise)<br>
2-Pyrrolidinone	11.5<br>

EDTANa2	0.05<br>
p-alanine	0.2<br>
[0041]    Note that the vehicle was adjusted to have a pH of 4 with NaOH or HN03.<br>
Solution Spectra and Color<br>
[0042]    UV-Vis solution spectra of various magenta dyes are shown in Fig. 10. "Half band width" and "band center" can be used to characterize color of the dyes. These values are listed in the table shown in Fig. 11. The half band width is typically associated with chromaticity of the dyes and is defined as the band width of the spectra at half of the maximum absorbance. The smaller the band width, the higher the chromaticity. "Band center" indicates roughly where the main absorbance is and is related to the hue. The "band center" is defined as the wavelength in the center of the half band. Magenta A and Pro Jet Fast M 2 show similar absorbance and narrower half band width but the chroma of Magenta A is higher than that for ProJet Fast M 2 on Lustro Laser media with fixer underprinting. A second example is Magenta C vs. RR180 and Magenta B. Magenta C shows much higher absorbance than the other two dyes, however, chroma of Magenta C is significantly lower than RR180 and Magenta<br><br>
B on Lustro Laser with fixer underprinting. Examination of the printed area under an optical microscope shows that Magenta A, RR180 and Magenta B printed area is uniform and featureless while ProJet Fast M 2 and Magenta C show discrete solid deposits on Lustro Laser media. More magenta dyes are tested in the same manner and separate them into three categories:<br>
[0043]    "Fast precipitating"- discrete solid deposit is seen.<br>
[0044]   "Slow precipitating"- the printed area is entirely featureless.<br>
[0045]   "Medium precipitating"- some solid deposit is seen, however, the background area is partially stained with the dye.<br>
[0046]   A trend is shown in Fig. 12 by plotting the chroma on Lustro Laser vs the half band width. Chroma on Lustro Laser with fixer underprinting can differ as many as 10 units using dye with different precipitating rates. The "slow precipitating" dyes are always in the upper right corner while the "fast precipitating" dyes locate in the lower left corner. The "medium precipitating" dyes sits between the two boundaries.  As a result, the "slow-precipitating" dyes are preferred when used with fixer underprinting for improved color performance.<br>
Magenta Dye Blends<br>
[0047]    Using the same analogy in cyan, magenta dye and dye blends can be used to obtain optimal color and lightfastness properties. Several dyes and dye blends are tested in the same manner as other magenta dyes mentioned previously. The durability of these dyes and dye blends are shown in Fig. 13. In general, all the magenta dyes perform similarly in the test.<br>
[0048]    Calculated color gamut volume (estimated from printed CMYRGBKW) is shown in Fig. 14. The highest gamut (estimated from L*a*b* of CMYRGBKW) is achieved with magenta C/AR289 (1.3%/1.4%) blend and<br>
RR23/AR289 (1.3%/1.4%) blend. Gamut volume achieved by AR94 (3%) is<br><br>
similar to Magenta B/AR289, however, this magenta is significantly bluer and the red is slightly worse than Magenta B/AR289. Magenta D shows fairly good gamut volume and the red is better than Magenta B/AR289.   Magenta E is similar to Magenta B/AR289 in hue but less chromatic.<br>
Kinetics and Color<br>
[0049]    Micrographs of red area fills created with different magenta dyes on Lustro Laser are shown in Figs. 15A-15E and 16A - 16F. These micrographs shed lights on the kinetics of precipitation of fixer/dye complex. Examples of slow-precipitating dyes are AR289, RR180, Magenta F, Magenta A and Magenta D. Example of medium-precipitating dye are: ProJet Fast Magenta 2t Magenta B, Magenta C and Magenta E. Examples of fast-precipitating dyes are AR94 and DR227.<br>
