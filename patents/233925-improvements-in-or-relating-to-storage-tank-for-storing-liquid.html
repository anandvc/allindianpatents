				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a storage tank for storing liquid. More<br>
particularly this invention is concerned with an overhead storage tank for storing and<br>
supplying clear water ensuring collection of undissolved suspended impurities in a separate<br>
region of the tank which can conveniently be removed from time to time. Thus clear water is<br>
made available at all times from the tank free from all suspended impurities.<br>
Overhead tanks made by various manufactures including the present<br>
applicants were usually of different geometrical shapes, circular shape being most prevalent.<br>
These tanks had flat bottom without any separate region or arrangement for collection of<br>
suspended impurities and/or undissolved solids, and this often created difficulties for the user.<br>
Impurities and undissolved solid matters, usually in fine state of subdivision and just larger<br>
than colloidal state, collected or deposited at the bottom tended to get dispersed in the main<br>
body of clear water stored above these matters, particularly during filling operation when<br>
water impinged from top inlet pipe of the tank on the accumulated water, causing sufficient<br>
turbulence in the total mass of water resulting in sediments at the bottom mixing with clear<br>
water stored on top.<br>
In case of ground water having dissolved iron, calcium and magnesium salts,<br>
aerial oxidation favoured hydrolysis with the formation of near-insoluble or partially soluble<br>
hydroxides which tend to accumulate at the bottom of the tank as divided sludge, which also<br>
get dispersed under the influence of the incoming water jet and lend a turbid appearance to the<br>
clear water. Such foreign matters are a potential source of health hazard and cause diseases of<br>
intestinal tract.<br>
The principal object of the present invention is to provide a storage tank of<br>
improved design which overcomes the difficulties envisaged in conventional storage tanks.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide an improved storage tank which<br>
has a specially designed dome-shaped bottom projecting inside the tank facilitating collection<br>
of sediments / foreign matters at the annular region in the bottom.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide an improved storage tank<br>
which does not allow' dispersion or mixing of sludge or sediment with the accumulated clear<br>
water.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a storage tank with a dome-<br>
shaped, concavo-convex bottom curving inwards, the upper surface of which is substantially<br>
smooth so that the suspended impurities cannot adhere to the curved surface and slide down to<br>
the annular space provided at the inside peripheral region of the tank.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention according to which<br>
there is provided a storage tank for storing liquid, which comprises in combination :<br>
i) a main body of the tank made of inert polymeric material which does<br>
not enter into reaction with the contents thereof;<br>
ii) an opening on the top surface of the tank which is wide enough to<br>
allow cleaning to be carried out in the inside region of the tank, the said<br>
opening being equipped with a lid connected with a hinge :<br>
iii) an inlet through which liquid is introduced in the tank and an over-flow<br>
outlet and<br>
iv) an outlet pipe provided at the bottom region of the said tank,<br>
Characterized in that the bottom surface is concavo-convex, in shape curving inwards<br>
facilitating particulate matters and sediments present in the liquid to slide down and get<br>
collected in the annular space provided at the tank bottom which can be removed through at<br>
least ore outlet provided slightly above the bottom surface of the tank and below the outlet<br>
pipe and the exterior of the said tank carries a plurality of ribs uniformly spaced apart to<br>
impart structural stability and enhanced impact resistance.<br>
As mentioned earlier, annular ring-like bands or ribs impart enhanced<br>
structural stability and impact resistance. Any accidental fall or faulty handling of the empty<br>
tank while installing or removing will not cause damage to the main body and the ribs will act<br>
as "shock-absorbers".<br>
The top surface of the tank has an opening which is off-centre and carries a<br>
detachable lid which fits snugly around the lip of the opening, which is normally slightly<br>
raised above the top surface of the tank and may in addition carry a bead all around the lip to<br>
provide a proper sealing. The lid may be attached to the upper surface of the main body of the<br>
tank by means of a hinge.<br>
The bottom part of the tank carries a plurality of legs or stands, evenly<br>
spaced, on which the tank with its content rests creating a clearance at the bottom of the tank.<br>
This enables the user to clean the surface on which the tank is made to rest or is situated.<br>
As already mentioned earlier, the concavo-convex, dome-shaped bottom<br>
surface of the tank curves inwardly and the upper surface thereof is substantially smooth. This<br>
prevents adherence of finely divided sludge and/or foreign particles to the surface which slide<br>
down and get collected in the annular region of the tank bottom. The bottom region of the<br>
tank may have a plurality of opening in the form of drain pipes for quick and efficient<br>
removal of accumulated sludge.<br>
It has been observed that certain carbonates and bicarbonates going out of<br>
liquid phase tend to set or harden on "ageing". Hence, periodic cleaning of the tank bottom is<br>
desirable as prolonged deposition of such undesirable materials may even clog the outlets. As<br>
the liquid handled is mostly water, this situation could very well arise depending on hardness.<br>
The invention will now be more particularly illustrated by means of the<br>
drawing accompanying this specification, in which -<br>
(1) is the main body of the tank,<br>
(2) is the opening on the top surface with a lid,<br>
(3) is the inlet through which water is introduced inside the tank,<br>
(4) is the over-flow outlet,<br>
(5) is the outlet provided at the bottom,<br>
(6) is the drain pipe opening below the outlet pipe level,<br>
(7) is the dome-shaped bottom curving inwards,<br>
(8) denotes a plurality of ribs and<br>
(9) denotes the annular space provided around the dome-shaped bottom for<br>
allowing the sludge or suspended impurities to collect.<br>
From the figure of the tank shown in the accompanying drawings it may be<br>
observed that the peripheral region of the tank bottom is substantially rounded which further<br>
facilitates removal of the accumulated insoluble, solid impurities.<br>
Though the aforesaid storage tanks are primarily meant for holding water<br>
mainly for domestic or industrial use, similar containers may well be used for storing non-<br>
aqueous liquids which do not react on storage with the tank body.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to<br>
specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes<br>
and modifications can be made therein without deviating or departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention. Thus the disclosure contained herein includes within its ambit the<br>
obvious equivalents and substitutes as well.<br>
Having described the invention in detail with particular reference to the<br>
illustrative drawing accompanying this specification, it will now be more specifically defined<br>
by means of claims appended hereafter.<br>
