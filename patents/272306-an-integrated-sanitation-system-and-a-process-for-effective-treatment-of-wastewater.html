FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an integrated sanitation system and a method for effectively treating waste-water, particularly in habitations with high ground water table and for areas prone to flooding and tidal waves.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
The sanitation system (toilet and bathroom) facility and the septictank are normally separated by a distance and usually not integrated in hitherto existing septictank architecture. The conventional designs primarily comprise of an inlet wastewater pipe connected to septictank at one end and an outlet pipe cormected to a drain field at the opposite end. These pipe connections are generally made via a T pipe which allows liquid entry and egress without disturbing the scummy crust on the surface. Installation of such facilities in dense congested habitations is difficult.<br>
The concept of septictank was first patented on September 2,1881 by John Louis Mouras and Abbe Moigno (BBC, 2003). A septictank is a single, double, or multiple-chamber impermeable tank used for anaerobically (decomposition and sedimentation) treating wastewater comprising blackwater and greywater. Blackwater is a term used to describe water coming from toilets containing fecal matter, urine and flush water. Greywater is non-industrial wastewater generated from domestic processes from the rest of the sanitation equipment of a house, such as the bath, shower, sinks, dishwashing, laimdry, and the kitchen sink, i.e., excepting human excrement from the toilets. The volume of wastewater both from the toilet and wash area is high, requiring a large design-volume of the septictank, often with multiple chambers, to increase retention time of wastewater for decomposition. Introduction of greywater into the septictank also reduces the treatment efficiency of anaerobic decomposition of the wastewater.<br>
 <br>
The wastewater undergoes anaerobic digestion in the septictank and breaks down into solids, clarified liquids and floating scum. Heavy solids settle as sludge at the bottom of the septictank and light solids form a scum layer (which is a layer of impurities that accumulates at the surface of a liquid) suspended above the clarified liquids. Excess clarified water is directed out of the septictank to be discharged to a drain field and/or pit, also referred to as leach field or pit, soak-away, soak pit, and/or seepage field, depending upon locality, by diffusion into the soil and/or evapo-transpiration. Foul gases generated in the septictank are vented out through a vent-pipe.<br>
Usually, wastewater comprising both the human excrements (blackwater) and greywater are let into the septictank for decomposition and sedimentation. It is difficult to treat the<br>
*<br>
wastewater if it contains a large quantity of excess flush/wash water as the anaerobic digestion/decomposition is generally slow. Excessive flush/wash water would result in the septictank filling up and inadequately decomposed wastewater being discharged directly to the drain field. Not only is this bad for the environment, but the resulting sludge overflows from the septictank into the leach field may clog the leach-field piping or the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs. The clarified liquids leaving the septictank are bacteria-rich and nutrient-rich, and cany the risk of contamination and spread of disease if the water table is high and if the habitation is prone to frequent flooding/tidal waves. However, blackwater (without combining with greywater) with minimum of flush water is easy to treat anaerobically.<br>
The related art of interest describes various models of septictanks and filtration chambers, for treatment of wastewater, constructed or coupled to each other in series with inlet and outlet pipes placed on opposite sides of the septictanks. Moreover, the existing septictanks are generally underground or subterranean, which makes them unsuitable for habitations with high water table (groimd saturated with water within 3 feet of topsoil) and prone to flooding and tidal waves.<br>
PCT application No. PCTAJS2008/051534 describes a septictank to avoid overioading and formation of a clogging biomat in the soil treatment area; it includes a septictank<br>
 <br>
system having a primary treatment compartment and a second treatment compartment coupled in series to provide an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket process for providing additional treatment of the wastewater prior to discharge to soil treatment areas. The septictank is buried below grade so as to allow flow by gravity from the building to the tank and is generally installed at the site of the residence or other building, at a specified distance from the building.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,441,632 describes an above-ground septictank which is installed in the house or within an enclosure attached to the house .The tank has an inlet at one end for receiving waste material, and an outlet in the opposite side for discharging liquid effluent to the leaching field which is built into the grotmd around the house. The septic system is particularly effective for use in waterfront areas where in-ground septictanks are not permitted. However, such septictanks do not ensure fimctionality under conditions of heavy flooding and tidal waves.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,063,271 describes a movable, insulated, beatable, wastewater treatment plant for mobile homes for promoting decomposition of waste liquids and being installable above the level of ground and beneath the mobile home for receiving waste liquids by gravity flow from mobile home. The inlet and outlet pipes are at the opposite ends of the septictank.<br>
U.S Patent Application. No.: 11/849,826 (Karl K. Holt) relates to a portable wastewater treatment system and a device installed in a vehicle comprising a wastewater holding tank having an interior adapted to hold wastewater and comprises a tank for holding greywater and a tank for holding blackwater. The treated greywater and clear blackwater are' sent to non-potable water-holding tank, while the blackwater and solid waste is dumped to the wastewater treatment system.<br>
Several inventions proposed septictank filters to be placed inside the septictank to improve wastewater quality, US 5,904,847 to Tom Bovington, US 5,762,790 to Kenneth E. Zoeller, U.S. Pat. No. 5,683,577 to Norse (1996) and several inventions have proposed placing passive in-pipe filtering mechanisms between the septictank and drain fields.<br>
 <br>
hi light of the foregoing, the septictank disposals can be unsafe due to the presence of disease-causing pathogens/microbes and chemical nutrients. Moreover, disasters and emergency situations can disrupt the provision of clean water and hygienic sanitation, which are crucial for maintaining public health. Furthermore, available septictank systems do not provide flexibility that enables active and appropriate treatment/disinfection of wastewater leaving the septictank to the drain field. In addition, in habitations with high water-table prone to frequent floods and/or tidal waves, the functionality of available septictank systems are questionable under conditions subsequent to floods/tidal waves. The sanitation facilities such as toilets and bathrooms are usually located separated from the septictank, making their installations in dense habitations difficult. Hence, there is an unmet need for integrated effective septictank architecture for safe disposal of wastewater in habitations with high water table and prone to frequent flooding and to tidal waves.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The principal object of the present invention is to develop an integrated sanitation system for effective treatment of wastewater in habitations with high water table and prone to frequent flooding and to tidal waves.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to install the septictank partially above groimd level, enabling normal functioning of septictank in the event of flooding/tidal-waves once the flood water recedes.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to install the septictank partially above the ground level to enable working of the septictank in habitations Avith high ground water-table<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide both the inlet pipe of the primary chamber and outlet pipe of the secondary chamber on the rear side of the septictank adopting a 'U' shaped configuration, enabling compact integration of the toilet and<br>
 <br>
bathroom chambers with the septictank, and also increasing the retention time by introduction of baffles.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is the integration of the 'U' shaped configuration with a filtration chamber to facilitate active introduction of appropriate disinfectants to render the wastewater leaving the septictank safe.<br>
An additional object of the present invention is to develop a process of improved effectiveness in treating wastewater.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention is to separate the blackwater and the greywater to reduce the load on the septictank and also improve the anaerobic decomposition of the blackwater, as mixing of greywater would reduce the effectiveness of anaerobic decomposition.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to mount toilet chamber and bathroom chamber on the septictank.<br>
A fiirther object of the present invention is to provide a prefabricated, transportable sanitation system that can be installed rapidly at desired locations.<br>
Other aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the detailed description when taken in conjimction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

 <br>
For the purpose of understanding the principles of the invention, one or more illustrative embodiments illustrated in the drawings is (are) referred and used to describe the instant invention.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a perspective fi-ont view of a sanitation system showing a toilet chamber 101 mounted on the primary chamber of the septictank, a bathroom chamber<br>
102	mounted on the secondary chamber of the septictank, a septictank 201 installed<br>
partially above the ground level (ground saturated with water within 3 feet of topsoil)<br>
GL,<br>
Figure 2 and 3 illustrates a rear view of septictank illustrating, a filtration chamber 301 for filtering the clarified water leaving the septictank and the greywater (directly let into) 102a fi-om the bathroom 102. The filtration chamber 301 is filled with stone/brick rubble to serve as a filter material of volume about 0.75 m^. The filtration camber 301 is not limited to just one chamber and may comprise additional chambers with various filter materials to improve the filtration purpose and efficiency. It further illustrates a vent pipe<br>
103	to remove foul gas resulting fi"om the anaerobic decomposition of the human<br>
excrements and flush water let into the septictank chambers. A perforated pipe 401 is<br>
connected to the filtration chamber 301 to carry filtered water out of the filtration<br>
chamber for dissipation to the surroimding soil by lateral dififtision and evapo-<br>
transpiration. Behind the toilet and the bathroom chamber there are two slabs covering<br>
the septictank. One removable slab 501 covers the primary septictank chamber and<br>
provides access for maniial desludging of the primary and secondary chamber. Another<br>
removable slab 502 covers the filtration chamber 301 and provides access to maintain the<br>
filtration chamber and also comprises an opening to permit the greywater pipe 102a<br>
coming fi-om the bathrooml02. Disinfectants made of phenolic and/or acidic compoimds<br>
can be introduced into the filtration chamber 301, as found appropriate, during conditions<br>
of water logging, floods and tidal waves. These compounds are introduced to disinfect<br>
the clarified water and the filtered greywater leaving the filtration chamber 301, so as to<br>
minimize health risks associated with bacteriological contamination of ground water.<br>
 <br>
particularly prevalent during conditions of water logging after heavy rains, floods and tidal waves.<br>
The filtered water leaves the filtration chamber 301 through perforated pipe 401.The perforated pipe can be made up of poly vinyl chloride (PVC) or clay 401 and connected to the filtration chamber 301. The clarified water fi-om the septictank chamber 201 and the greywater fi-om the bathroom 102 entering the filtration chamber 301 undergo aerated filtration and such water is diffused laterally near the soil surface through the lateral perforations in the perforated poly vinyl chloride (PVC) or clay pipes 401 The filtration chamber 301 can be designed either for an aerated or anaerobic filtration of the wastewater entering the chamber. Another vent pipe may be provided to the filtration chamber 301 if required.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 illustrate a top view of the septictank, designed with a capacity of approximately 3.55 m^ for a family size of 5-6 members. The septictank 201 includes a primary septictank chamber 201a for collecting human excrements and flush water fi*om the toilet through inlet pipe 202. The inlet pipe 202 can be a water-trap or a direct pipe leading fi-om the water closet 101a being used for the toilet. A secondary septictank chamber 201c is connected to the primary chamber 201a by means of a baffle wall 201b. The baffle wall 201b comprises an opening at the base, numerous openings at the mid section and a large slit opening at the top. The baffle wall 201b increases the retention time of the decomposing human excrement and flush water, thereby increasing the efficiency of anaerobic treatment and sedimentation in the septictank.<br>
Opening at the base of the baffle wall is to allow the depositing sludge in the primary chamber 201a to gradually move to the secondary chamber 201c. Opening at the base is also to permit the manual desludging of the septictank. Openings at the middle are to permit the flow of clarified water from the primary chamber 201a to the secondary chamber 201c, without disturbing the depositing sediments and floating scum layer. Generally, three identifiable layers occur in a septictank. First, solid waste precipitates out of the flow to the bottom of the septictank. This layer is generally known as sludge. Liquid effluent is the intermediate layer and generally consists of liquids and solids<br>
 <br>
partially broken down into liquids by the anaerobic bacteria that are present in the septictank. This intermediate layer known as clarified water is drained off to the absorption field. The top layer in the septictank is generally known as the scum layer. The scimi layer is comprised mostly of residual detergents, soaps, fats and oils and has a tendency to float at the top of the septictank. The slit opening at the top of the baffle wall 201b is to equalize the air pressure in both the chambers and to permit movement of foul gases fi-om the secondary chamber to the primary chamber, to be let out of the septictank by vent pipe 103 connected to the primary chamber 201a. A 'T' shaped outlet pipe 203 installed well above the ground level connects the secondary septictank chamber 201c to the filtration chamber 301 and carries clarified water fi-om the secondary septictank camber 201c to the filtration chamber 301. The 'T' shaped outlet pipe 203 enables the clarified water fi-om the secondary septictank chamber 201c to enter the filtration chamber 301, without disturbing the floating scum and sediments in the septictank chambers 201a and 201c.<br>
The filtration chamber 301 fiirther filters the possible suspended solids in the clarified water leaving the septictank. Greywater fi-om the bathroom 102 is let into the filtration chamber 301 through an inspectable pipe 102a for filtration.<br>
The filtered water leaves the filtration chamber 301 through perforated pipe 401 for dissipation to the surroimding soil by lateral diffusion and evapo-transpiration. Phenolic and/or acid-based disinfectants can be introduced into the filtration chamber 301 for disinfecting the clarified water leaving the secondary septictank chamber 201c and also for disinfecting the greywater entering the filtration chamber 301 fi-om the bathroom 102 through inspectable pipe 102a. The filtration chamber 301 may need periodic maintenance by removal and refilling of the rubble material.<br>
The septictank design according to figure 4 illustrates an inlet pipe 202 which empties human excrements, and flush water from the toilet closet 101a. the inlet pipe 202 can be in the form of a direct down-pipe or a 'P' or 'S' water seal trap leading to the primary septictank chamber 201a. The sanitary fixture in the toilet can be an Indian-type or European-type water closet. The inlet pipe 202 and outlet'T' pipe 203 of the septictank<br>
 <br>
are both placed on the rear side adopting a 2+1 (primary and secondary chambers of septictank and a filtration chamber) 'U' shaped configuration, enabling the compact integration of the toilet 101 and bathroom 102 chambers with the septictank 201 by mounting the toilet 101 and bathroom 102 on the septictank 201, as shown in Figure 5.<br>
The septictank can be prefabricated, transported and rapidly installed at desired locations during emergencies or disasters, and m situations of high-density, such as pilgrimages and festivals. One or more materials such as Ferro-cement, Fiber-reinforced Plastics (FRP), and Recycled Plastics can be used for the prefabrication of the septictank. Usage of materials like Ferro-cement, Fiber-Reinforced Plastics (FRP), and Recycled Plastics will be economical.<br>
The present disclosure fiirther provides a process for effective treatment of waste-water in regions of high water table (groimd saturated with water within 3 feet of topsoil) and prone to flooding and tidal waves.<br>
The system separates the wastewater into human excrement and greywater. Only the human excrement with the flush water is let into the septictank 201, and the greywater is let into the filtration chamber 301 for subsequent diffusion of nutrients into the soil for "quasi root-zone" treatment. Quasi root-zone treatment refers to the absorption of wastewater nutrients and aeration of soil by the roots of plants which spread laterally and plants that have a high evapo-transpiration rate. This improves the (decomposition and sedimentation) treatment of pathogen/bacteria-rich wastewater fix)m the toilet and also makes the septictank operate for a much longer (e.g., twice as long) period as compared to conventional septictank designs. The efficiency of treatment is also greatly improved, as the introduction hitherto of greywater, with chemicals and often disinfectants, into the septictank has hampered the bacteriological decomposition in the septictank hitherto.<br>
The system includes multiple chambers to increase retention time of the wastewater which would enhance the decomposition and sedimentation of waste. Further, the system includes a filtration chamber 301 for filtering the excess clarified water leaving the septictank 201, and the greywater being let directly into the filtration chamber 301. The<br>
 <br>
outlet 203 from the septictank 201 leading to the filtration chamber 301 is situated well above the ground, a feature which renders the functionality of the sanitation facility despite instances of floods and tidal waves.<br>
The clarified and the filtered greywater leaving the filtration chamber has the risk of carrying bacteriological contaminants, which can get transmitted to the ground and surface water during times of flooding. The filtration chamber has the provision to accept appropriate phenolic and/or acid based disinfectants to disinfect the water leaving the filtration chamber.<br>
The present invention is further elaborated with the help of the following example. However, the description and the example considered here should not be construed to limit the scope of construction and arrangement of the invention as these embodiments can be practiced and carried out with mmierous modifications and variations without departing fi*om the essence of the invention.<br>
It is to be understood that the improved apparatus of the present invention could be installed in alternate locations characterized by high water table and prone to fi-equent floods and/or tidal waves, wherein the septictank resumes functioning once water recedes subsequent to conditions of extreme flooding and/or tidal waves. Ideally, the water will recede during a flood, a tidal wave and tsimami.<br>
Example: 1<br>
The typical installation as per figures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 is designed with a capacity of approximately 3.55m^ for a family size of 5-6 members. The internal dimensions of the different features of the sanitation system are as follows:<br>
Toilet-1100xl200mm,Bathroom-1200xl200nim,Primary chamber- 1100x1850x1300mm, Secondary chamber- 1200x1200x1300mm, Filtration chamber- 1200x500x1300mm.<br>
The septictank pit height is -600mm with respect to the grovind level (GL), the ground level being ±0 (slightly above or below ground svirface). The septic tank is raised<br>
 <br>
partially above ground level by +800mm with respect to top of bathroom chamber floor and + 1025mm with respect to top of toilet chamber floor. Excavated pit/trench for drain pipe has the following measurements: Width 400mm, depth 400mm and length varies based on the soil conditions.<br>
