Pyrazole Derivatives  for  the  Treatment of Viral  Diseases The invention is concerned witii novel and known pyrazole derivatives, a process for their manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions and the use of such compounds in medicine, especially in the treatment of viral diseases. In particular, the compounds are inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase enzyme which is involved in viral replication. Consequently the compounds of this invention maybe advantageously used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases mediated by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).<br>
The disease Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is the end result of infection by the distinct retroviruses, human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) or type-2 (HrV-2). Several critical points in the virus life cycle have been identified as possible targets for therapeutic intervention. Inhibition of one of these, the transcription of viral RNA to viral DNA (reverse transcriptase, RT), has provided a number of the current therapies used in treating AIDS. Inhibition of reverse transcriptase provided the first form of treatment for HIV infection with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT). Since then several inhibitors have been launched, broadly forming two classes: nucleoside analogues and non-nucleosides. As an example of the latter it has been found that certain benzoxazinones, e.g. efavirenz are useftil in the inhibition of HIV RT. However, development of strains of the virus resistant to current RT inhibitors is a constant problem. Therefore, development of compounds effective against resistant strains is an important goal.<br>
Pyrazole derivatives have been described in the literature with different uses (e.g. agrochemistry or treatment of stress-relating illness).<br>
EP 0 627 423 describes pyrazole derivatives and their use as agrohorticultural bactericides.<br>
US 6,005,109 describes pyrazole derivatives and their use in the treatment of stress-relating illness.<br><br>
No pyrazole derivatives have yet been described in the Hterature for the treatment of diseases mediated by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide pyrazole compounds which are potent inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase en2yme, which isinvoived in viral repUcation, and which accordingly show a potential to be efficacious as antiviral drugs.<br>

As mentioned above, the compounds of formula I and hydrolyzable esters or ethers thereof or a pharmaceuticaHy acceptable salt thereof are inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase enzyme botii in vitro and in ^dvo, and can be used in the control or prevention of diseases mediated by tiie human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).<br>
The activity of the compounds of formula I for the treatment of diseases mediated by the human immunodeficiency virus (HTV) can be demonstrated with the following assay methods.<br>
Assay Method: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase assav: Inhibitor ICsn determination:<br>
HIV-1RT assay was carried out in 96-well Millipore filtermat NOB50 plates using purified recombinant enzyme and a poly(rA)/oligo(dT)i6 template-primer in a total volume of 50 }xL. The assay constituents were 50 cfiM Tris/HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 6 mM MgClz, 5 \iU dTTP, 0.1 ^iCi [^H] dTTP, 5 ^ig/ml poly (rA) pre annealed to<br>
2.5 ^ig/ml oligo (dT)i6 and a range of inhibitor concentrations in a final concentration of 10% DMSO. Reactions were initiated by adding 5 nM HIV-1 RT and after incubation at 37^C for 30 min, they were stopped by tiie addition of 50 |LI1 ice cold 20%TCA and allowed to precipitate at 4°C for 30 min. The precipitates were collected by applying vacuum to the plate and sequentially washing with 2 x 200 jil of 10% TCA and 2 x 200 M-l 70% etiianol. Finally the plates were dried and radioactivity counted in a Wallac Microbeta 1450 after the addition of 15 |il scintillation fluid per well. ICso's were calculated by plotting % inhibition versus logio inhibitor concentrations.<br>
Antiviral assay method:<br>
Anti-HIV antiviral activity was assessed using an adaptation of the method of Pauwels et al. {Pauwels et al., 1988, J Virol Methods 20:309-321}. The method is based on the ability of compotmds to protect HIV-infected T lymphoblastoid cells (MT4 cells) from cell-death mediated by the infection. The endpoint of the assay was calculated as the<br><br>
concentration of compound at which the cell viability of the culture was preserved by 50% (*50% inhibitory concentration', IC50). The cell viability of a culture was determined by the uptake of soluble, yellow 3"[4,5-dimethylt±Liazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetra2olium bromide (MTT) and its reduction to a purple insoluble formazan salt. After solubilization, spectrophotometric methods were employed to measure the amount of formazan product.<br>
MT4 cells were prepared to be in logarithmic-phase growth and a total of 2 x 10^ cells infected with the HXB2-strain of HIV at a multiplicity of 0,0001 infectious imits of virus per cell in a total volume of between 200-500 microlitres. The cells were incubated<br>
with virus for one hour at 37^C before removal of virus. The cells are then washed in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2 before being resuspensed in culture mediimi for incubation in culture with serial dilutions of test compound. The culture medium used was RPMI1640 without phenol red, supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, L-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (GMIO).<br>
Test compounds were prepared as 2 mM solutions in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). Four replicate, serial 2-fold dilutions in GMIO were then prepared and 50 microlitres amounts placed in 96-well plates over a final nanomolar concentration range of 625 - 1.22. Fifty microlitres GMIO and 3.5 x 10^ infected cells were then added to each well. Control cultures containing no cells (blank), uninfected cells (100% viability; 4 replicates) and infected cells without compound (total virus-mediated cell death; 4 replicates) were also<br>
prepared. The cultures were then incubated at 37*^C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air for 5 days.<br>
A fresh solution of 5 mg/mL MTT was prepared in 0.01M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2 and 20 microlitres added to each culture. The cultures were further incubated as before for 2 hours. They were then mixed by pipetting up and down and 170 microlitres of Triton X-100 in acidified isopropanol (10% v/v Triton X-100 in 1:250 mhture of concentrated HCl in isopropanol). When the formazan deposit was fidly solubilized by fiirther mixing, the absorbance (OD) of the cultures was measured at 540nm and 690nm wavelength (690nm readings were used as blanks for artefacts between wells). The percent protection for each treated culture was then calculated firom the equation:<br><br>
% Protection =<br>
(OD drug-treated cultures) - (OD untreated virus control cultures)<br>
	:	— X100%<br>
(OD uninfected cultures) - (OD untreated virus control cultures)<br>
The IC50 can be obtained from graph plots of percent protection versus logio drug concentration.<br>
In both assays, compounds of formulas I range in activity from an IC50 of about 0.5 to about 10000 xiM or 0.5 to about 5000 nM, with preferred compounds having a range of activity from about 0.5 to about 750 nM, more preferably about 0.5 to 300 nM, and most preferably about 0.5 to 50 nM.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
