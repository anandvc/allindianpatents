				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention] [Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a side stand for a two wheeled vehicle such as a scooter or a motor cycle having a stand rod part pivotally supported so as to be able to revolve to a working position projecting in an outward and downward direction from the vehicle body and to an inclined housing position towards the rear of the vehicle body, and a plate shaped ground contact part connected to the end of this stand rod part which is able to come in contact with the ground in the working position, and an operation arm protruding from the outside face of the stand rod part which is operated by the rider's foot to revolve the stand rod part to each of the aforesaid positions. [Related Art]<br>
Side stands of this kind are already known as described in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei. 5 - 85458.<br>
[Problems the Invention Sets out to Solve]<br>
In related side stands of this kind for two wheeled vehicles the outside edge of the ground contact part is rounded and a folding process is employed. However, this is extremely troublesome and is a hindrance in cost reduction.<br>
The present invention has been developed with these considerations in mind, and aims to provide a side stand for the aforesaid two wheeled vehicles which is easy to manufacture, has a simple construction and is low cost by using an operation arm and rounding the outside edge of the ground contact part. [Means of Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above mentioned object, the present invention has a stand rod part pivotally supported so as to be able to revolve to a working position projecting in an outward and downward direction from a vehicle body and to an inclined housing position towards the rear of the vehicle body, a plate shaped ground contact part connected to the end of this stand rod part which is able to come in contact with the ground in the working position, and an operation arm protruding from the outside face of the stand rod part which is operated by the rider's foot to revolve the stand rod part to each of the aforesaid positions, and in this side stand for a two wheeled vehicle, the operation arm is constructed from a bar having a bent part at its center, this bent part of the operation arm faces in an outward direction from the stand rod part, with one end part being secured to the outside face of the stand rod part, and another end part being welded so as to cover the outside edge of the ground contact part and form a circular cross section protective part.<br>
According to these special characteristics, the outside edge of the ground contact part is rounded by the aforesaid other end part of the operation arm. There is therefore no need to increase the number of parts and it is possible to easily weld the other end part to the ground contact part.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a side stand for a two wheeled vehicle having a stand rod part 10 supported by a pivot 4 to revolve to a working position projecting in an outward and downward direction from a vehicle body and to an inclined housing position towards the rear of the vehicle body, a plate shaped ground contact part connected to a tip of a stand rod part and able to come in contact with the ground in working position, and an operation arm protruding from the outside face of the stand rod part operated by a rider's foot to revolve the stand rod part to each of the positions,<br>
characterised in that the operation arm is constructed from a bar having a bent part at its center facing in an outward direction from the stand rod part, with an end part being secured to the outside face of the stand rod part and another end part being welded so as to cover the outside edge of ground contact part and form a circular cross section protective part.<br><br>
[Brief Description of the Drawings]<br>

[Fig. 5]<br>
A view of Fig. 3 in the direction of arrow 5.<br>
[Embodiment]<br>
A practical example of the present invention is now described based on an embodiment of the present invention shown in the attached drawings. Fig. 1 is a<br><br>
side view of motor cycle with the side stand attached, Fig. 2 is a rear view of the same motor cycle, Fig. 3 is a side view of the side stand, Fig. 4 is a rear view of the side stand and Fig. 5 is a view of Fig. 3 in the direction of arrow 5.<br>
Firstly, in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, a stand bracket 3 is formed with the lower edge facing obliquely to the left on the lower part of a vehicle body 2 of a motor cycle 1, and a side stand 5 is attached to this stand bracket 3 by a pivot 4. This side stand 5 is able to revolve around pivot 4 between the two positions of operation position A, protruding downward to the left of the vehicle body 2, and housing position B, inclined towards the rear of the vehicle body 2. To maintain the side stand 5 in the aforesaid positions, a torque spring 6 consisting of a tension coil spring is attached between the side stand 5 and the stand bracket 3. That is to say, when the tractive force line of action is at operation position A of side stand 5, torque spring 6 moves forward of the center of pivot 4 and energizes the side stand in position A, and when the tractive force line of action is at housing position B, the torque spring 6 moves to the rear of the center of pivot 4 and energizes the side stand in housing position B.<br>
Furthermore, each of the aforesaid positions A and B of side stand 5 are prescribed by the stand bracket 3.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3 to Fig. 5, side stand 5 principally consists of a stand rod part formed from steel pipe, with a U shaped yolk 11 welded on a main edge thereof supported so as to be freely rotational about the pivot 4, and a tip part compressed and bent in an outward direction to a stand rod part 10 and comprising a plate shaped ground contact part 12. The stand rod part 10 is provided with an elliptic cross section facing the longitudinal axis in the left to right direction of the vehicle body 2, and has a large flexural rigidity in the left to right direction.<br>
A connecting stub axle 13 of the torque spring 6 is welded to the inside surface of the stand rod part 10 and an operation arm 14 is secured from the outside face to the ground contact part 12.<br>
The operation arm 14 is constructed from a round metal bar, in the middle of which is formed a bent part 14a, bent in a rounded V shape. Furthermore, the bent<br><br>
part 14a faces to the outside of the stand rod part 10, and one end part 14b is secured by welding to the lower outside face of stand rod part 10. The other end part of the operation arm 14 is bent into an L shape and forms protective part 14c. This protective part 14c is secured by welding to the upper edge of the outside end of the ground contact part 12 so as to cover the entire width of the ground contact part 12. This protective part 14c has a round cross section the same as that of the round bar material.<br>
Next, a description will be given concerning the operation of the embodiment.<br>
When a rider sits astride the motor cycle, by kicking down the operation arm 14 of side stand 5 with the sole of their left foot or kicking the operation arm 14 of side stand 5 up with the end of their foot, it is possible to revolve the side stand 5 to operation position A or housing position B. Also, when the rider is dismounting to the left side of the motor cycle 1, by kicking down the operation arm 14 of the side stand 5 or kicking the operation arm 14 of the side stand 5 up, it is possible to revolve the side stand 5 to operation position A or housing position B. However, when the side stand 5 is revolved to operation position A, it is possible to support the motor cycle 1 stably by inclining the motor cycle 1 to the left side and grounding the plate shaped ground contact part 12 on its relatively wide bottom surface.<br>
As the protective part 14a, formed integrally with the operation arm 14, is welded so as to cover the full width of the upper edge of the outside end of the ground contact part 12, the riders boots are prevented from coming into contact with the angular upper edge of the ground contact part 12 by the protective part 14a.<br>
Moreover, as the operation arm 14 having integrated protective part 14c does not require an increased number of parts and is easily welded to the ground contact part 12, it is possible to achieve a reduction in production costs.<br>
Further, as the operation arm 14 connects between the stand rod part 10 and the ground contact part 12, it can also function as a reinforcer for the ground contact part 12 and increase the strength of the ground contact part 12.<br><br>
Yet further, as both end parts of the operation arm 14 are secured to the stand •rod part 10 and the ground contact part 12, the support strength is increased, and it is possible to fully bear the operational load.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the aforesaid embodiments, and it is possible to make various design alterations without deviating from the scope of the fundamental principles. For example, the ground contact part 12, can be constructed from a plate member separate from stand rod part 10 and this can be welded to the tip of the stand rod part 10. Also, it is possible to apply the present invention to the side stands of scooters. [Effects of the Invention]<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, on a vehicle body, a stand rod part is pivoted so that it can revolve to an operation position projecting downward and outward from the vehicle body and to a housing position inclined towards the rear of the vehicle body, and connected to the tip of this stand rod part is a plate shaped ground contact part which can come in contact with the ground in the operation position and has an operation arm operated by the foot of the rider which enables the stand rod part to be revolved to each of the aforesaid positions, and on a side stand for a two wheeled vehicle an operating arm is constructed of bar material having a bent part in the middle. The bent part of this operation arm faces in an outward direction to the stand bar part, and along with one end part being secured to the outside face of the stand bar part, the other end part is welded to the outside end edge of the ground contact part so as to cover it, and as this forms a protective part with a round cross section, it is possible to round the edge of the ground contact part using the weld part for the ground contact part of the operation arm. Therefore, it is possible to restrict an increase in the number of parts while simplifying production, enabling a possible reduction in production costs. Moreover, as the operation arm is connected between the stand bar part and the ground contact part, it functions as a reinforcer for the ground contact part and it is possible to increase the strength of the of the ground contact part. Furthermore, as both ends of the operation arm are secured to the stand bar part and the ground<br><br>
contact part, the support strength is increased and it is able to fully bear the operational load.<br>
