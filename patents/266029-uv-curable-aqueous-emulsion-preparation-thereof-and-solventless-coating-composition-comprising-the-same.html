				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a UV-curable aqueous emulsion, a method for<br>
preparing the same and a solventless coating composition comprising the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
There have been developed various UV-curable aqueous coating compositions for<br>
plastics which contain no environmentally hazardous organic solvent. For example,<br>
Gennan Patent No. 2936039 discloses a coating composition comprising a waterdispersible<br>
urethane acrylate prepared using amino sulphonic acid-alkali metal or -<br>
alkaline earth metal salt. However, this method provides a coating film having poor<br>
water resistance due to the alkali metal ion present on the film surface.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,287,039 discloses a method of dispersing a polyester urethane<br>
acrylate by using a dispersant. However, the film produced by this dispersion method<br>
shows poor water resistance, hardness, gloss due to the presence of moisture on the<br>
film.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,135,963, 6,011,078, 6,207,744, 6,335,397, 6,436,540, and<br>
6,538,046 disclose curable polyurethane aqueous coating dispersions. The UV-curable<br>
polyurethane aqueous coatmg dispersions disclosed in these patents are obtained by<br>
using oligomers having larger molecular weights to ensure the stability of dispersion in<br>
water, but films obtained by using these dispersions have lower crosslinking densities,<br>
which does not fulfill plastic coating requirements.<br>
Disdosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a UV-curable<br>
aqueous coating composition having good environmental acceptability and satisfactory<br>
plastic coating film properties comparable to those of an oil-based UV-curable coating<br>
composition.<br>

weight of the inventive UV-curable aqueous emulsion and (B) 1 to 10 % by weight of<br>

Mode for the Invention<br><uv-curable aqueous emulsion><br>
The inventive UV-curable aqueous emulsion is derived by subjecting a mixture of 1<br>
to 10 % by weight of a polycarbonate polyol or polyester polyol, 1 to 10 % by weight<br>
of an isocyanate compound, 0.1 to 5 % by weight of a reactive carboxylic acid, 1 to 10<br>
% by weight of a UV-curable acrylic oligomer having 2 to 9 functional acrylate<br>
groups, 5 to 20 % by weight of a UV-curable acrylic monomer, 0.1 to 20 % by weight<br>
of a urethane-reactive acrylate and 0.01 to 1 % by weight of a radical polymerization<br>
inhibitor to a urethane reaction, based on the total weight of the UV-curable aqueous<br>
emulsion, in the presence of a metallic catalyst;<br>
The method of preparing the UV-curable aqueous emulsion according to the present<br>
invention is described in detail as follows:<br><step><br>
The reaction is carried out until the content of the isocyanate(NCO%) measured by<br>
the neutralization titration method is 2 to 5% by weight based on the product.<br>
i) Polycarbonate polyol or polyester polyol<br>
Representative examples of the polycarbonate polyol used in the present invention<br>
include PCDL T4692 or PCDL T5651 (Asahi Kasei Co.).<br>
The polyester polyol may include a polyester diol having 2 functional groups,<br>
which can be conventionally obtained by mixing an excessive amount of a diol with a<br>
dicarboxylic acid at a room temperature and subjecting the resulting mixture to an ester<br>
condensation reaction in the presence of a metallic catalyst at 150 to 215 °C, preferably<br>
about 210 °C for about 24 hours, until the acid value of the product as measured using<br>
the neutralization titration method becomes 0.5 mg KOH/g or less. The diol may be<br>
used in an amount of 1.2 to 1.7 eq. based on the 1 eq. of the dicarboxylic acid.<br>
Representative examples of the diol used in manufachire of the polyester diol<br>
include glycols having 2 to 15 carbon atoms such as neopentyl glycol, 1,4- butanediol,<br>
1,6-hexanediol, diethyleneglycol, dipropyleneglycol, triethyleneglycol and tripropyleneglycol,<br>
and preferably neopentyl glycol. Representative examples of the dicarboxylic<br>
acid include maleic acid, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, succinic acid,<br>
glutamic acid, adipic acid, isophthalic acid, phtalic anhydride, crotonic acid, ataconic<br>
acid, and a monoalkylester thereof, and preferably adipic aicd or isophthalic acid.<br>
The polycarbonate polyol and polyester polyol preferably has a number-average<br>
molecular weight of 1,000 to 3,000 g/mol and an OH value determined by back<br>
titration of 50 to 2(M) mg KOH/g.<br>
The polycarbonate polyol or polyester polyol is used in an amount of 1 to 10 %,<br>
j<br>
preferably 4 to 8 % by weight based on the total weight of the UV-curable aqueous<br>
emulsion.<br>
ii) Isocyanate compound<br>
The isocyanate compound used in the present invention is preferably an aliphatic or<br>
aromatic isocyanate having two or more hinctional isocyanate groups, and representative<br>
examples thereof include 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorene diisocyanate,<br>
1,4-cyclohexyl diisocyanate, 2,2,4-trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate<br>
4<br>
and tetramethylxylene diisocyanate.<br>
The isocyanate compound is used in an amount of 1 to 10 %, preferably 3 to 7 % by<br>
weight based on the total weight of the UV-curable aqueous emulsion. When the<br>
amount of the isocyanate compound is larger than 10 % by weight, the cured coating<br>
film becomes brittle due to an excessively high crosslinking density and suffers from<br>
crack generation by heat or impact, and when less than 1 % by weight, mechanical<br>
properties of the coating film become poor.<br>
iii) Reactive carboxylic acid<br>
Representative examples of the reactive carboxylic acid for introducing the hydrophilic<br>
group to polyurethane acrylate include dimethylolpropanoic acid(DMPA),<br>
dimethylolbutanoic acid(DMBA) and the like, and DMBA is preferred in order to keep<br>
the viscosity low during the reaction.<br>
The reactive carboxylic acid is used in an amount of 0.1 to 5 %, preferably 0.5 to 2<br>
% by weight based on the total weight of the UV-curable aqueous emulsion. When the<br>
amount of the reactive carboxylic acid is more than 5 % by weight, the solubility in<br>
water increases resulting in the rise in the viscosity of an emulsion, and when less than<br>
0.1 % by weight, an emulsion may not be formed or the storage stability deteriorates.<br>
iv) UV-curable acrylic oligomer<br>
In order to obtain satisfactory plastic coating film properties comparable to those of<br>
the prior oil-based UV-curable coating composition, a UV-curable acrylic oligomer is<br>
added and dispersed.<br>
Representative examples of the UV-curable acylic oligomer used in the present<br>
invention include urethane acrylate, polyurethane acrylate, ester acrylate, polyester<br>
acrylate and a mixture thereof, having 2 to 9 functional aciylate groups, and commercially<br>
available materials include, for example, EB-1290, EB-830 (commercially<br>
available from SK-UCB, Korea) which have 6 functional acrylate groups and EB-<br>
4883, EB-9260, EB-9384 (commercially available from SK-UCB, Korea) which have<br>
3 functional acrylate groups. The oligomer is used in an amount ranging from 1 to 10<br>
% by weight, preferably 6 to 9 % by weight based on the total weight of the UVcurable<br>
aqueous emulsion.<br>
The properties of the emulsion may be controlled by mixing a high functional<br>
oligomer having 4 or more functional acrylate groups and a low functional oligomer<br>
having 3 or less functional acrylate groups. The weight ratio of the low functional<br>
oligomer : the high fiinctional oligomer may range from 1:0.5 to 1:3. When the ratio of<br>
the high functional oligomer exceeds the upper limit, the cured coating film becomes<br>
brittle due to an excessively high crosslinking density and suffers from crack<br>
f<br>
generation by heat or impact, and when it less than the lower limit, the chemical and<br>
mechanical properties of the coating fibn become poor.<br>
v) UV-curable acrylic monomer<br>
The UV-curable acrylic monomer used in the present invention acts as a reactive<br>
diluent instead of an organic solvent to control the curing rate and enhance the<br>
adhesion, as well as to control the viscosity of the reactant.<br>
The UV-curable acyUc monomer has no hydroxyl group and thus it is non-reactive.<br>
Representative examples thereof include an acrylic acid ester of an aliphatic<br>
polyhydric alcohol or alkoxy derivative thereof, for example trimethylolpropane<br>
triacrylate(TMPTA), tripropyleneglycol diacrylate(TPGDA), 1,6-hexamethylenediol<br>
diacrylate(HDDA), 1,4-butanediol diacrylate(l,4-BDDA), 1,3-isobutanediol diacrylate,<br>
isobonyl acrylate(IBOA) or a mixture thereof.<br>
The monomer is used in an amount ranging from 5 to 20 % by weight, preferably<br>
12 to 16 % by weight based on the total weight of the UV-curable aqueous emulsion.<br>
When the amount is more than 20 % by weight, the curing rate becomes low, and<br>
mechanical and chemical properties of the coating film become poor, and when less<br>
than 5 % by weight, the viscosity of the react become higher while UV-curable<br>
emulsion becomes unstable.<br>
In the present invention, the UV-curable acrylic monomer may be employed in an<br>
amount ranging from 50 to 500 % by weight, based on the UV-curable acrylic<br>
oligomer.<br>
vi) Metallic catalyst<br>
The reaction of preparing the UV-curable aqueous emulsion may be accelerated in<br>
the presence of a metallic catalyst. Representative examples of the metallic catalyst<br>
used in the reaction include a tin-based compound such as dibutyltin dilaurylate and an<br>
amine compound such as DBU(l,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene) and the like, and<br>
the metallic catalyst may be used in a catalytically effective amount.<br><step><br>
In step (b), the reaction is carried out at 70 to 90 °C until the isocynate peak at 2,260<br>
cm' in a fourier transform infrared spectrom (FT-IR) disappears completely.<br>
vii) Urethane-reactive acrylate<br>
The urethane-reactive acrylate used in the present invention preferably has one or<br>
more hydroxyl groups and 1 to 6 functional acrylate groups per molecule. Representative<br>
examples of the urethane-reactive acrylate used in the present invention<br>
7<br>
include 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate(2-HEA), 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate(2-HPA),<br>
caprolactone acrylate (Tone M-lOO, commercially available from U.C.C), a mixture of<br>
pentaerythritol triacrylate and pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, a mixture of dipentaeiythritol<br>
pentaacrylate and dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate and the like. Preferred are<br>
a mixture of pentaerythritol triacrylate and pentaerythritol tetraacrylate and a mixture<br>
of dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate and dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate. In each mixture,<br>
the content of pentaerythritol triacrylate or dipentaerythritol tetraacrylate preferably<br>
ranges from 50 to 60 % by weight.<br>
The urethane- reactive acrylate is used in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 20 % by<br>
weight, preferably 1 to 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the UV-curable<br>
aqueous emulsion.<br>
viii) Radical polymerization inhibitor<br>
Representative examples of the radical polymerization inhibitor used in the present<br>
invention include hydroquinone, p-methoxyphenol, nitrobenzene,<br>
BHT(2,6-di-tetra-butyl-4-methyIphenol) and the like.<br>
The radical poljnnerization inhibitor is used in an amount ranging from 0.01 to 1 %<br>
by weight, preferably 0.1 to 5 % by weight based on the total weight of the UV-curable<br>
aqueous emulsion.<br><step><br>
In order to enhance the aqueous dispersion stability, carboxyl groups in the<br>
urethane-reaction product obtained in step (b) may be neutralized in part or as a whole<br>
using a basic compound, and water is added dropwise thereto in an amount of 55 to 75<br>
% by weight, based on the total weight of the UV-curable aqueous emulsion to obtain<br>
an aqueous emulsion having a solid content of 25 to 45 % by weight.<br>
Representative examples of the basic compound include organic or inorganic bases,<br>
for example alkali or alkaline-earth metal hydroxide, oxide, carbonate or hydrogen<br>
carbonate, and ammonia or primary, secondary or tertiary amine and the like,<br>
preferably sodium hydroxide or tertiary amine such as triethylamine, triethanolamine,<br>
dimethylethanolamine or diethylethanolamine. The basic compound used in the<br>
reaction may be in the range of 0.8 to 1 eq. based on the carboxylic acid used.<br><br>
The inventive UV-curable aqueous coating composition comprises (A) 90 to 99 %<br>
by weight of a UV-curable aqueous emulsion prepared in accordance with the<br>
inventive method and (B) 1 to 10 % by weight of a photoinitiator, based on the total<br>
8-<br>
weight of the composition<br>
Representative examples of the photoinitiator which functions to generate radicals<br>
by UV irradiation to initiate the crosslinking of unsaturated hydrocarbons include<br>
1-hydroxyl cyclohexyl phenyl ketone(IRGACURE 184; conmiercially available from<br>
Ciba Specialty Chemicals), bis(2,4,6-trimethyl benzoyl) phenyl phosphine<br>
oxide(IRGACURE 819; commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals),<br>
2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl diphenyl phosphine(TPO),<br>
2-hydroxy-2-methyl-l-phenyl-l-propane(DARC)CUR 1173; commercially available<br>
from cmA-GEIGY), IRGACURE 500, benzophenone(BP) and a mixture thereof, and<br>
it is used in an amount ranging from 1 to 10 % by weight, preferably from 2 to 6 % by<br>

(nano-silica containing compound) (commercially available from hanse chemie Co.) in<br>
an amount ranging from 0.1 to 2% by weight based on the total weight of the<br>
composition.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, the coating film may be prepared by spray<br>
coating, dip coating, flow coating or spin coating the inventive coating composition on<br>
the surface of a substrate to form a UV-curable fihn thereon, drying the coating layer at<br>

inventive UV-curable aqueous emulsion having no organic solvent is capable of<br>
providing a coating film having good environmental acceptability and satisfactory<br>
properties comparable to those of the prior oil-based UV-curable coating composition.<br>
Accordingly, it is useful as environmentally friendly plastic aqueous coating products.<br>
