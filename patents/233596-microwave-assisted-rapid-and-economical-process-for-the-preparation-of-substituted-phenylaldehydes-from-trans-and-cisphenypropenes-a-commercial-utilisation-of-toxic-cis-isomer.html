				<td>MICROWAVE ASSISTED RAPED AND ECONOMICAL PROCESS FOR THE<br>
PREPARATION OF SUBSTITUTEFD PHENYLALDEHYDES FROM TRANS<br>
AND CIS-PHENYLPROPENES: A COMMERCIAL UTILISATION OF<br>
TOXIC CIS-ISOMER<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to "microwave assisted rapid and economical<br>
process for the preparation of substituted phenylaldehydes from trans and toxic cisphenylpropenes:<br>
a commercial utilization of toxic cis-isomer" in which industrially<br>
important phenylaldehydes (e.g. asaronaldehyde where RI is CHO, R2 = R4 = RS is -<br>
OMe and R3=R6 is H; p-anisaldehyde where, Rt is -CHO, R2 = R3 = RS = Re is H and<br>
R4 is -OMe and vetralaldehyde where Rf is -CHO, R2 = RS = RÂ« is H; R3 = R4 is -<br>
OMe or the like) of the formula I<br>
are obtained via oxidation of easily available isomeric forms (trans and cis-isomer) of<br>
(R2-R3-R4-Rs-R6)phenylpropene bearing essential oils (i.e. p-asarone, anethole, and<br>
methyl isoeugenol or the like) wherein R2 to R&amp; equal or different, being hydrogen or<br>
hydroxy or acyl or alkyl or methylenedioxy or alkoxy groups or the like, under<br>
microwave irradiation using meta-periodate/osmium tetraoxide (catalytic amount) for<br>
a reaction time less than 20 minutes in biphasic system comprising a solvent and<br>
aqueous phase containing a catalyst (such as quaternary ammonium salt and amberlite<br>
IRA-410 etc) with high yield varying from 71-82% depending upon the reagent,<br>
reaction time, condition and the phenylpropene used. In addition crude Acorns<br>
calamus oil (rich in P-asarone present in 70-94%) used directly for microwave<br>
assisted oxidation is an added benefit as remaining constituents of calamus oil do not<br>
interfere for the preparation of asaronaldehyde (yield just less by 5-10% depending<br>
upon asarone percentage in calamus oil) which makes the above process further cost<br>
effective since tetraploid and hexaploid varieties of Acorus calamus has been<br>
internationally banned for their use in human consumption. Moreover, we have<br>
observed that the preparation of asaronaldehyde (a versatile drugs precursor) requires<br>
lesser time (2-20 minutes) under microwave irradiation while oxidation takes 2-6<br>
hours when conducted at room temperature (conventional method).<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Naturally occurring substituted phenylaldehydes (Harbome, J.B. and Baxter,<br>
H., In: Phytochemical Dictionary, A Handbook of Bioactive Compounds from Plants,<br>
Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd., London WC1N 2ET, 472-488 (1993)) e.g. vanillin, panisaldehyde,<br>
p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, asaronaldehyde, heliotropin and vetralaldehyde<br>
etc possess in common an aromatic ring bearing one or more hydroxy or<br>
dioxymethylene or alkoxy groups or the like, attached to a aldehyde group (CHO)<br>
contribute significantly to the taste and flavour of many foods, drinks, perfumery and<br>
serve as a pharmaceutical aid. In addition, phenylaldehyde derivatives serve as a raw<br>
material for the preparation of a large number of aromatic compounds useful in the<br>
perfume industry e.g. treatment of phenylaldehyde with alkali alcoholate results in the<br>
formation of phenyl benzoate and condensation of phenylaldehyde derivative with<br>
acetaldehyde gives cinnamic aldehyde which are useful in both the perfume and<br>
pharmaceutical industries. In addition, large quantities of phenylaldehydes are used in<br>
the manufacture of dyes, medicines (Patel, P.J.; Messer Jr., W.S. and Hudson, R.A., J.<br>
Med. Chem., 36, 1893-1901 (1993)), photographic films, cosmetics, dyes,<br>
agrochemicals etc.<br>
The widespread aromatic aldehydes such as vanillin is obtained from the pods<br>
of Vanilla planifolia (family: Orchidaceae), the bulbs of Dahlia spp. (Compositae),<br>
the sprouts of Asparagus spp. (Liliaceae), the beats of Beta spp. (Chenopodiaceae)<br>
and also from the essential oils of Syzygium aromaticum (Myrtaceae), Ruta spp.<br>
(Rutaceae), Spiraea spp. (Rosaceae) and Gymnadenia spp. (Orchidaceae), while 3,4-<br>
methylenedioxybenzaldehyde ( heliotropin) is obtained from the essential oils of the<br>
flowers and leaves of Robinia pseudocode (Legumminosae), Doryphora sassafras,<br>
Eryngium potericum (Umbelliferae), Heliotropium spp. (Boraginaceae), Vanilla spp.<br>
(Orchidaceae) and from extracts of Viola spp. (Violaceae) and Baccharis<br>
rosmarinifolia (Compositae). Other phenylaldehydes are restricted to a few families<br>
such as p-anisaldehyde occurs in the fruits of Pelea madagascariensis (Rutaceae),<br>
Agastache ntgosa (Labiatae), leaves of Magnolia salicifolia (Magnoiiaceae) and also<br>
in the essential oils of Vanilla spp. (Orchidaceae), Acacia spp. (Leguminosae), Cassia<br>
spp. (Leguminosae), Finns spp. (Pinaceae), Pimpinella anisum (Umbelliferae),<br>
Illicium venim (Illiciaceae), whereas p-hydroxybenzaldehyde occurs in traces in<br>
Plocama pendula (Rubiaceae), Pterocarpus marsupium (Leguminosae), and<br>
asaronaldehyde in the essential oils of Acorns spp. (Motley, T.J., Economic Botany,<br>
48: 397-412, (1994) and Piper spp. (Koul, S.K., Taneja, S.C., Malhotra, S. and Dhar,<br>
K.L., Phytochemistry, 32(2): 478-480, (1993)). However, the limited percentage of<br>
these substituted phenylaldehydes present in the plant kingdom is not sufficient to<br>
fulfill the world demand and as a result, the major amounts of phenylaldehydes are<br>
made synthetically.<br>
A number of processes have been proposed to prepare substituted<br>
phenylaldehydes such as p-anisaldehyde, dimethoxybenzaldehyde, vanillin,<br>
heliotropin, asaronaldehyde etc. For the most part, these methods involves reacting<br>
the substituted benzene, such as p-methoxybenzene, 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene with<br>
freshly distilled phosphorus oxychloride (POC13) in the presence of anhydrous N, Ndimethylformamide<br>
(DMF). However, while this Vilsmeier-Haack method has been<br>
proven to be useful, they suffer from one or more process deficiencies. For example,<br>
some processes of this type necessarily involve resort to sub ambient temperatures,<br>
which, of course, involves some considerable process control. In addition, large<br>
excesses of DMF and POCb must necessarily be employed to carry out the synthesis<br>
to obtain appreciable yields and moreover, POCh give rise to a violent exothermic<br>
reaction leading to obvious problems. Lastly, in some cases, the reaction is effected<br>
by the formation of some side reaction products (Toril, S., Uneyama, K. and Ueda, K.,<br>
J. Org. Chem., 49, 1830-1832 (1984).<br>
Typical prior art refrences include U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,794,813; 5,358,861;<br>

and German Pat. Nos. 57,808; 207,702.<br>
It therefore becomes an object of the invention to provide rapid and<br>
economical process for the preparation of substituted phenylaldehydes from trans and<br>
cis-phenylpropenes which further provide commercial utilization of toxic cis-isomer<br>
as well as eliminate the above discussed disadvantages and others.<br>

thereby, enhancing the profitable use thereof.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to explore a simple and cheaper<br>
starting material in which what ever percentage of cis (toxic) and trans-isomer (nontoxic)<br>
exists in crude essential oil or formed during alkaline isomerisation of yphenylpropenes<br>

It is worthwhile to mention that the conversion of toxic p-asarone (cis-isomer) from Acorus calamus or p-asarone (70-94%) rich crude calamus oil directly into asaronaldehyde (a versatile drugs precursor) is an economical gain of the above invention since it provides a proper utilization of internationally banned tetraploid and hexaploid varieties derived essential oil of Acorus calamus.<br>

commercial use in perfumery, flavour and pharmaceutics.<br>
Plant cells are highly sophisticated chemical factories where a large variety of<br>
chemical compounds are synthesized with great precision and ease from simple raw<br>
materials at normal pressure and temperature. Beside foods, plant materials/chemicals<br>
are used for many purposes for example, for treating medical ailments, dyeing clothes,<br>
colouring food items and for perfumery, cosmetics, flavour etc. Flavours represent a<br>
growing demand within the food industry. Several methods including chemical<br>
synthesis, biotechnology and natural extraction are under progress for the smooth<br>
production of aroma chemicals. Some of aromatic phenylaldehydes, mainly produced<br>
in plants in response to pathogen attack, possess strong antimicrobial activity due to<br>
hydroxy and an aldehyde group attached to the aromaic ring of phenylaldehyde.<br>
Therefore, as per applications concern, these phenylaldehydes are not only widely<br>
used in fragrances, flavours, cosmetics, liquors, Pharmaceuticals but they are also<br>
utilized as antibacterials, antifungais, and as biologically active compounds.<br>
Moreover, phenylpropenes, produced by plants in high concentration (sometimes unto<br>
95-96% ) are also widely used by perfumery, flavour and pharmaceutical industries,<br>
e.g. anethole (4-methoxyphenylpropene) is well exploited essential oil which exists in<br>
cis- and trans-form (Miraldi, E.; Flavour &amp; Fragrance Journal, 14(6) 379-382 (1999)),<br>
but its corresponding phenylaldehydes have more demand, as only trans-anethol is<br>
allowed since cis-anethol is possibly considered toxic and hazardous to human<br>
beings. On the other side, vanillin (a phenylaldehyde) is one of the most commonly<br>
consumed flavour chemicals (5,550 t/a worldwide) (Somogyi, L.P., Chem. Ind. L., 5,<br>
170, (1996). However, the limited percentage and high price of these natural<br>
phenylaldehyde led to the necessity of using large amount of synthetic materials. At<br>
present, 97% of the world vanilla flavour market is synthetic vanillin and remaining<br>
3% (weight basis) is a natural vanilla extract (Taylor, A.J. and Mottram, D.S., In:<br>
Flavour Science, Recent Developments, The Royal Society of Chemistry, Thomas<br>
Graham House, Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4 4WF, UK, 111-137,<br>
(1996). Various processes are known for the preparation of phenylaldehydes<br>
(Schiraldi, D.A. and Kenvin, J.C., U.S. Pat. No. 5910613; and Soma, Y., JP Pat. No.<br>
11049734A2; Kashima, M., Yoshimoto, H., Noda, Y. and Jibiki, H. JP Pat. No.<br>
7330655A2; Kajisori, S., JP Pat. No. 2268130A2; Tanaka, M., Sakakura, T., Wada,<br>
H. and Sasaki, Y. JP Pat No. 3264546A2; Kawamoto, K., Yoshioka, T., Yamagata,<br>
H., JP Pat. No. 5087739A2 and Ito, N. and Hasebe, A. JP Pat. No. 11279104A2)<br>
using phenylpropenes as a starting material. Considering the cost of starting<br>
material and reagents, phenylpropenes are found best suitable and cost effective<br>
starting material for the synthesis of substituted phenylaldehydes such as vanillin from<br>
isoeugenol, p-methoxybenzaldehyde from anethole and heliotropin from isosafarole<br>
(U.S. Pat. Nos, 1,643,804; 2,794,813). However, there is so far no such industrial<br>
method available for the preparation of a versatile drug intermediate "2,4,5-<br>
trimethoxybenzaldehyde" (a phenylaldehyde) from P-asarone (a toxic phenylpropene).<br>
It is worthwhile to mention that the selection of P-asarone for the preparation of<br>
asaronaldehyde has several fold benefits such as a simple and cheaper starting<br>
material and a proper utilization of internationally banned toxic calamus oil. Since Pasarone<br>
has recently been proved to be toxic and carcinogenic (Taylor, J. M., Jones,<br>
W. I., Hogan, E. C., Gross, M. A., David, D. A. and Cook, E. L., Toxicol. Appl.<br>
Phannacol., 10: 405 (1967); Keller, K.; Odenthal, K. P. and Leng, P. E., Planta<br>
Medica, 1: 6-9 (1985) and Kim, S.C., Liem, A., Stewart, B.C. and Miller, J.A.,<br>
Carcinogensis, 20(7), 1303-1307 (1999)) and the most affected plant is Acorns<br>
calamus (familyrAraceae) in which percentage of toxic P-asarone depends upon the<br>
varieties of A. calamus (Riaz, M., Shadab, Q., Chaudhary, F. M., Hamdard Medicus<br>
38(2): 50-62 (1995) and McGuffin, M., Hobbs, C., Upton, R. and Goldberg, A., In:<br>
American Herbal Products Association's Botanical Safety Handbook, CRC Press, Inc.;<br>
Boca Raton, Florida; USA, 231, (1997)). The content of P-asarone in the tripioid<br>
variety is 8-19 %, while P-asarone reaches upto 96% in the tetraploid and hexaploid<br>
varieties (extensively found in Asian countries). In contrast, p-asarone is not found<br>
in the diploid variety. As a result, the calamus oil obtained from North American<br>
diploid strain (zero, P-asarone) and East European tripioid strain (unto 12 % Pasarone)<br>
are allowed for clinical effectiveness and safety while the calamus oil<br>
produced in Asian belt (such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Japan and China)<br>
has diminished the market potential of calamus oil due to high percentage of Pasarone<br>
ranging from 70 to 94% (Mazza, G., J. of Chromatography 328:179-206<br>
(1985); Nigam, M. C., Ateeque, A., Misra, L. N. and Ahmad, A., Indian Perfumer 34:<br>
282-285 (1990) and Bonaccorsi, L, Cortroneo, A., Chowdhury, J. U. and Yusuf, M.,<br>
Essenze Derv. Agrum, 67(4): 392-402 (1997)). Therefore, our objective to utilize<br>
toxic p-asarone for value added phenylaldehyde does not provide only economical<br>
gain for calamus oil of tetraploid or hexaploid strain but also as a simple and cheaper<br>
starting material for the preparation of a natural 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylbenzaldehyde<br>
(asarylaldehyde), a versatile drug intermediate for synthesis of several biologically<br>
active compounds (Ahmad, S., Wagner, H. and Razaq, S., Tetrahedron, 34 (10): 1593-<br>
1594, (1978)) including Makaluvamine-D and Discorhabdin-C marine alkaloids<br>
(Sadanandan, E.V., Pillai, S.K., Lakshmikantham, M.V., Billimoria, A.D., Culpepper,<br>
J.S. and Cava, M.P. J. Org. Chem., 66: 1800-1805, (1995)).<br>
Phenylpropenes are relatively electron rich (pi bonds) which can be oxidized<br>
to corresponding aldehyde with a number of oxidizing agents such as chromic acid<br>
(Ger. Pat. No. 576 and U.S. Pat. No. 2,794, 813), manganese dioxide (Br. Pat. No.<br>
774,608), potassium permanganate (Erlenmeyer, Chem. Ber. 9, 273 (1876)), chromyl<br>
chloride (U.S. Pat. No. 365,918), air (Ger. Pat. No. 224,071), oxygen (Ger. Pat. No.<br>
150,981), ozonolysis (Ger. Pat. No. 321,567 and C.A., 54,:5538 (I960)), electrolysis<br>
(Ger. Pat. No. 92,007), peroxide (Ger. Pat. No. 93,938), nitrobenzene (Brit. Pat. No.<br>
271,819 and U.S. Pat No. 1,643,804), nitrobenzene (Brit. Pat. No. 285,156) and by<br>
several others process.<br>
All the above methods have various limitations, for example, low yield, expensive<br>
reagents and formation of unwanted side products. Our initial efforts to oxidize Pasarone<br>
by using known oxidizing reagents such as potassium permanganate or<br>
manganese dioxide/suiphanilic acid (Br. Pat. No. 774,608)) coupled in microwave to<br>
obtain asaronaldehyde is remained unsuccessful due to poor yield with various side<br>
product formation (such as asaronic acid). Fortunately, the combination of osmium<br>
tetroxide (OsO4) and periodate reagent (Cainelli, G., Contento, M., Manescalchi, F.<br>
and Plessi, L, Synthesis, 47-48, (1989)) in microwave is found an effective and high<br>
yielding method for preparing asaronaldehyde from toxic p-asarone (Example la). In<br>
addition, microwave assisted oxidation of phenylpropenes or the like with osmium<br>
tetroxide conducting in fuming hood is easy and safe otherwise handling of osmium<br>
tetraoxide requires special precaution due to its poisonous nature. After success of <br>
asarone, oxidation of a-asarone into asaronaldehyde is also found as effective as Pasarone.<br>
These experiments gave us idea that geometry (i.e. cis/trans-isomer) of<br>
phenylpropene does not effect the yield of final oxidized product. In continuation of<br>
this oxidation, calamus oil (rich in phenylpropene i.e. 85-90% o/p-asarone) is also<br>
capable of undergoing oxidation without any problem in purification or loss in yield<br>
since other constituents of calamus oil does effect interfere in asaronaldehyde<br>
formation (Example Ic). Although, OsO4/NaIO4 is well known system for<br>
converting alkene into aldehyde, however, microwave assisted oxidation of<br>
phenylpropene has not been reported so far for the preparation of substituted<br>
phenylaldehydes especially from toxic isomer of phenylpropene i.e. P-asarone (cisisomer)<br>
or phenylpropene rich crude oil (i.e. crude calamus oil). Having successfully<br>
achieved an efficient process for asaronaldehyde, we decided to extend the process to<br>
convert various phenylpropenes into phenylaldehyde via OsO4/NaIC&gt;4 such as anethole<br>
into 3,4-dimethoxyisoeugenol into 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (Example II), 4-<br>
methoxybenzaldehyde (Example III) or the like. It is further worthwhile to mention<br>
that what ever percentage of cis/trans anethole from methyl chavicol, cis/trans<br>
isosafrole from safrole, cis/trans isoeugenol from eugenol or the like obtained during<br>
alkaline isomerisation of y-phenylpropene (allylbenzene) or crude essential oil rich<br>
cis/trans phenylpropene (above 70% for industrial scale) can be easily utilized for the<br>
formation of corresponding phenylaldehydes. Our present invention is also beneficial<br>
to those industries which are engaged in alkaline isomerisation of allylbenzene into<br>
trans-phenylpropene for wide scope in flavour, perfumery and pharmaceutical<br>
industries, however, formation of cis-phenylpropene along with trans-phenylpropene<br>
diminished their applications, since separation of isomers is tedious and expensive on<br>
industrial point of view whereas, both isomeric forms can be used for the preparation<br>
of high valued phenylaldehydes.<br>

benzyltriethyl ammonium chloride (catalytic amount) and THF-H2O (8-10 mL, 4:1)<br>
were taken in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask fitted with a loose funnel at the top. The<br>
flask was shaken well and placed inside a microwave oven operating at medium<br>
power level and irradiated for 2-12 minutes in parts. After completion of the reaction<br>
(monitored by TLC), the contents of the flask were poured into chloroform and passed<br>
through a bed of Celite and further washed with chloroform. The filtrate and<br>
washings were combined and the chloroform layer were washed with sodium<br>
thiosulphate to destroy the excess periodate. The chloroform layers were then<br>
combined and washed with saturated sodium chloride (3 x 15 m), dried over<br>
anhydrous sodium sulphate and filtered. The solvent was removed to afford a crude<br>
solid product which was recrytallised with water to afford 2.39 g (82%) of<br>
asaronaidehyde as a feathery white needles, Rf (0.34 in 28% ethylacetate in hexane);<br>
mp 114 Â°C (lit mpl 14 Â°C); IR (film) vmax 1662 (carbonyl group), 1620, 1518, 1481,<br>

(b) Asaronaldehyde from a-asarone (by conventional method): A solution of<br>
OsCU (0.065 g, 0.25 mmol) in water (2 mL) was added dropwise to ice cold solution<br>
of a-asarone (0.624 g, 0.003 mole) (procured from Sigma) in THF-H2O (25 mL, 4:1)<br>
over a period of 5 min with constant stirring. After 20 min at 0-5 Â°C, finely powdered<br>
Nal(&gt;4 (2.35 g, 0.011 mole) was added in parts and reaction mixture was stirred for 4-<br>
6 hr at room temperature. After completion of reaction (monitored by TLC), the<br>
precipitated sodium iodate was filtered and the filtrate was washed with CH2C12. The<br>
combined organic layers were washed with 10% solution of sodium bisulphite (to<br>
destroy the excess of sodium meta-periodate), saturated brine and dried (Na2SC&gt;4).<br>
Evaporation of the solvent furnished a crude mixture, which was loaded on silica gel<br>
column, and the column was eluted with an increasing amount of hexane/ethy 1 acetate<br>
(95:5 to 70:30). The fractions were monitored on TLC plate and the desired fractions<br>
were combined and solvent was removed under vacuum to afford 0.49 g (84%) as a<br>
white solid; mp 114 Â°C. The physical and spectral data was found similar as above<br>
(Example I).<br>
(c) Preparation of asaronaldebyde from crude calamus oil: The rhizomes of<br>
'Acorus calamus Linn was collected in March-April 1999 from Palampur (H.P.) and<br>
was confirmed by comparison with the specimen (IHBT no. 1066) kept in the<br>
herbarium of our Institute. The hydrodistillation of rhizomes of Acorus calamus gave<br>
pungent smelling oil in 1.7 % yield (w/w) with a presence of (3-asarone (85 %) and<br>
a-asarone (3-4%) (by GC) and used directly for oxidation step. A mixture of pale<br>

(50 to 55 g) and dioxane-H2O (50-60 mL or more, 4:1) were taken in a 500 ml beaker<br>
fitted with a loose watch glass at the top. The beaker was placed inside a microwave<br>
oven operating at medium power level and irradiated for 3-16 minutes in parts. After<br>
completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), the contents of the beaker were<br>
filtered and washed with ethyl acetate. The ethylacetate layers were washed with<br>
water, aqueous sodium bisulphite (to destroy the excess periodate) and brine, dried<br>
over (anhydrous sodium sulphate) and filtered. The solvent was removed under<br>
reduced pressure and crude solid was recrystallised with hexane and chloroform to<br>
obtain 5.66 g (76%, based on % of a and (3-asarone in crude calamus oil) of pure<br>
asaronaldehyde as a white solid; mp 114 Â°C. The physical and spectral data was found<br>
similar as above (Example I).<br>
Example II<br>

microwave method): The starting material methyl isoeugenol (3,4-dimethoxy<br>
phenylpropene) can be easily prepared by fast 0-methylation of cheaper and easily<br>
available isoeugenol (3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylpropene) for which a mixture of<br>
isoeugenol (2.46 g, 0.015 mole), dry dimethyl sulphate (1.8 g, 0.14 mole), anhydrous<br>
potassium carbonate (6g, 0.062 mole) and dry acetone (15-20 mL) was irradiated in a<br>
microwave oven for 8-10 minutes in parts. After completion of reaction (monitored<br>
by TLC) the contents of the flask were poured into ice water. The product was taken<br>
in ether (50-60 mL) and the ether layer was washed with dilute hydrochloric acid,<br>
saturated sodium bicarbonate and brine respectively and dried over anhydrous sodium<br>
sulphate and filtered. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to<br>
afford a desired product methyl isoeugenol (2.32 g, 87% yield) which was used<br>
directly for next step.<br>
A solution of OsO4 (0.006-0.008 g), methyl isoeugenol (0.53 g, 0.003 mole),<br>
finely powdered NaIO4 (2.35 g, 0.011 mole), amberlite IRA-410 (O.lg) in THF-H2O<br>
(25 mL, 4:1) was irradiated in a microwave oven for 3-11 minutes. After completion<br>
of reaction (monitored by TLC), the precipitated sodium iodate was filtered and the<br>
filtrate was washed with CH2Cl2. The combined organic layers were washed with<br>
sodium thiosulphate (to destroy the excess of sodium meta-periodate), saturated brine<br>
and dried over Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent furnished a crude mixture, which<br>
was loaded on silica gel column, and the column was eluted with an increasing<br>
amount of hexane/ethyl acetate (95:5 to 70:30). The fractions were monitored on TLC<br>
plate and the desired fractions were combined and solvent was removed under<br>
vacuum to afford 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde in 79% yield as a solid; !H NMR 8<br>
9.86 (1H, s, CHO), 7.45 (1H, s, 6H), 7.41 (1H, s, 2H), 6.98 (1H, s, 5H), 3.97 (3H, s,<br>
4-OCH3), 3.95 (3H, s, 3-OCH3). The remaining physical and spectral data was found<br>
similar as reported.<br>
Example in<br>

powdered NaIO4 (9.0 g, 0.044 mole) in THF-H2O (20-25mL) was irradiated in a<br>
microwave oven for 2-8 minutes in parts. The precipitated sodium iodate was filtered<br>
and the filtrate was washed with CHjCh. The combined organic layers were washed<br>
with sodium thiosulphate, brine and dried over NajSC^. Evaporation of the solvent<br>
furnished a crude mixture, which was loaded on silica gel column, and the column<br>
was eluted with increasing amount of hexane/ethyl acetate (98:2 to 80:20). The<br>
fractions were monitored on TLC plate and the desired fractions were combined and<br>
solvent was removed under vacuum to afford 4-methoxybenzaldehyde in 71% yield as<br>
a sweet smell liquid; !H NMR 8 9.95 (1H, s, CHO), 7.82 (1H, s, 6H), 7.79 (1H, s,<br>
2H), 6.99 (1H, s, 5H), 6.96 (1H, s, 5H), 3.84 (3H, s, 4-OCH3). The remaining<br>
physical and spectral data was found similar as reported and yield was found less may<br>
be due to evaporation of anethole during microwave irradiation.<br>
