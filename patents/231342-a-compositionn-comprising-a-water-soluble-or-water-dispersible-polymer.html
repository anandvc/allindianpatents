				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel polymeric compositions and their<br>
use in methods of inhibiting corrosion and controlling the formation and<br>
deposition of scale imparting compounds in aqueous systems such as cooling,<br>
boiler and gas scrubbing systems; pulp and paper manufacturing processes; in the<br>
pretreatment of metals; as rheology modifiers for concrete and cement additives;<br>
as cleaning agents for membranes; and as hydrophilic modifier components in<br>
personal care,cosmotic and pharmaceutical formulations. The novel polymeric<br>
compositions which are useful in accordance with the present invention comprise<br>
water-soluble or water-dispersible copolymers of ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomers with sulfate, phosphate, phosphite or carboxylic terminated<br>
polyalkylene oxide allyl ethers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The problems of corrosion and scale formation and the attendant effects<br>
have troubled water systems for years. For instance, scale tends to accumulate on<br>
internal walls of various water systems, such as boiler and cooling systems, and<br>
thereby materially lessen the operational efficiency of the system.<br>
Deposits in lines, heat exchange equipment, etc., may originate from<br>
several causes. For example, precipitation of calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate<br>
and calcium phosphate in the water system leads to an accumulation of these<br>
scale-imparting compounds along or around the metals' surfaces which contact<br>
the flowing water circulating through the system. In this manner, heat transfer<br>
functions of the particular system are severely impeded.<br>
Corrosion, on the other hand, is a degradative electrochemical reaction of<br>
a metal with its environment. Simply stated, it is the reversion of refined metals<br>
to their natural state. For example, iron ore is iron oxide. Iron ore is refined into<br><br>
steel. When steel corrodes, it forms iron oxide which, if unattended, may result<br>
in failure or destruction of the metal, causing the particular water system to shut<br>
down until the necessary repairs can be made.<br>
Typically, in cooling water systems, the formation of calcium sulfate,<br>
calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate, among others, has proven deleterious<br>
to the overall efficiency of the cooling water system. Recently, due to the<br>
popularity of cooling treatments using high levels of orthophosphate to promote<br>
passivation of the metal surfaces in contact with the system water, it has become<br>
critically important to control calcium phosphate crystallization so that relatively<br>
high levels of orthophosphate may be maintained in the system to achieve the<br>
desired passivation without resulting in fouling or impeded heat transfer<br>
functions which would normally be caused by calcium phosphate deposition.<br>
Silica (SiO2) is present in most natural waters. When these waters are cycled<br>
in a cooling tower, the silica level increases and often a level is reached where<br>
precipitation of a silica species occurs. Sometimes the precipitation proceeds by<br>
the polymerization of silica itself, resulting in a silica gel. For this to occur, a<br>
relatively high SiO2 concentration is required, usually greater than approximately<br>
200 ppm. However, when certain cations are present, silica species can<br>
precipitate at much lower concentrations. Cations that promote silica<br>
precipitation include, but are not limited to, Al3+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and Fe3+.<br>
Aluminum is very insoluble in water and readily precipitates under cooling water<br>
conditions. When aluminum gets into a cooling system (such as by carryover) it<br>
can cause serious precipitation problems. One such problem is the precipitation<br>
of phosphate species which may be present as a corrosion inhibitor. Such<br>
precipitates can be problematic due to both deposition and corrosion effects.<br>
Although steam generating systems are somewhat different from cooling<br>
systems, they share a common problem in regard to deposit formation.<br>
As detailed in the Betz Handbook of Industrial Water Conditioning, 9th<br>
Edition, 1991, Betz Laboratories Inc., Trevose, Pa, Pages 96-104, the formation<br><br>
of scale and sludge deposits on boiler heating surfaces is a serious problem<br>
encountered in steam generation. Although current industrial steam producing<br>
systems make use of sophisticated external treatments of the boiler feedwater,<br>
e.g., coagulation, filtration, softening of water prior to its feed into the boiler<br>
system, these operations are only moderately effective. In all cases, external<br>
treatment does not in itself provide adequate treatment since muds, sludge and<br>
hardness-imparting ions escape the treatment, and eventually are introduced into<br>
the steam generating system.<br>
In addition to the problems caused by mud, sludge or silt, the industry has<br>
also had to contend with boiler scale. Although external treatment is utilized<br>
specifically in an attempt to remove calcium and magnesium from the feedwater,<br>
scale formation due to residual hardness, i.e., calcium and magnesium salts, is<br>
always experienced. Accordingly, internal treatment, i.e., treatment of the water<br>
fed to the system, is necessary to prevent, reduce and/or retard formation of scale<br>
imparting compounds and their resultant deposition. In addition to carbonates of<br>
magnesium and calcium being a problem as regards scale, having high<br>
concentrations of phosphate, sulfate and silicate ions either occurring naturally or<br>
added for other purposes cause problems since calcium and magnesium, and any<br>
iron or copper present, react and deposit as boiler scale. As is obvious, the<br>
deposition of scale on the structural parts of a steam generating system causes<br>
poorer circulation and lower heat transfer capacity, resulting in an overall loss in<br>
efficiency.<br>

USE OF THE POLYMERS<br>
The polymers of the invention are effective for water treatment in cooling<br>
water, boiler and steam generating systems as deposit control and/or corrosion<br>
inhibition agents. The appropriate treatment concentration will vary depending<br>
upon the particular system for which treatment is desired and will be influenced<br>
by factors such as the area subjected to corrosion, pH, temperature, water<br>
quantity and the respective concentrations in the water of the potential scale and<br>
deposit forming species. For the most part, the polymers of the present invention<br>
will be effective when used at levels of from about 0.1-500 parts permillion parts<br>
of water, and preferably from 1 about to 100 parts per million of water contained<br>
in the aqueous system to be treated. The polymers may be added directly into the<br>
desired water system in an aqueous solution, continuously or intermittently.<br>
The polymers of the present invention are not limited to use in any<br>
specific category<br>
of aqueous system. They would be expected to inhibit the formation and<br>
deposition of scale forming salts in any aqueous system prone to that problem.<br>
For instance, in addition to boiler and cooling water systems, the polymers may<br>
also be effectively utilized in scrubber systems and the like wherein corrosion<br>

for preventing deposit of pitch, calcium oxalate and barium sulfate. They can<br>
also be used as viscosity modifiers in mining and mineral processing applications<br>
to reduce the viscosity of slurries.<br>
The water-soluble or dispersible polymers of the present invention may be<br>

selected from the group consisting of inorganic phosphoric acids or salts thereof,<br>
phosphonic acid salts, organic phosphoric acid esters, and polyvalent metal salts<br>
or mixtures thereof. Such topping agents may be added to the system being<br>
treated in an amount of from about 1 to 500 ppm.<br>

acids and water-soluble salts thereof. Examples of phosphoric acids include<br>
orthophosphoric acids, primary phosphoric acids and secondary phosphoric acids<br>
and salts thereof. Examples of inorganic condensed phosphoric acids include<br>

the polymers of the present invention include phosphoric acid esters of alkyl<br>
alcohols such as methyl phosphoric acid ester, ethyl phosphoric acid ester, etc.,<br>

acid esters of polyoxyalkylated<br>
polyhydroxy compounds obtained by adding ethylene oxide to polyhydroxy<br>
compounds such as glycerol, mannitol, sorbitol, etc. Other suitable organic<br>
phosphoric esters are the<br>
phosphoric acid esters of amino alcohols such as mono, di, and tri-ethanol<br>
amines. The<br>
water-soluble polymers may also be used in conjunction with molybdates such<br>
as, sodium molybdate, potassium molybdate, lithium molybdate, ammonium<br>
molybdate, etc.<br>
The polymers of the present invention may be used in combination with<br>

4,872,995 disclose the use of specific copolymers in treating cooling, boiler,<br>
steam generating and other aqueous heat transfer systems to inhibit deposition of<br>
scales such as calcium phosphate, calcium phosphonate, calcium oxalate, iron<br>
oxide, zinc oxide and silica. Based upon the deposit control efficacy exhibited by<br>
the polymers of the present invention, it is believed that they could be substituted<br>
for the polymers disclosed in the above and other similar patents to provide<br>
improved performance in a wide variety of water based treatment applications.<br>
The copolymers of the present invention can be used alone or in<br>
combination with conventional cleaning agents such as surfactants, chelating<br>
agents, citric acid, phosphoric acid and other common reagents to remove deposit<br>
and prevent fouling on membranes used in the micro filtration, ultra filtration and<br>
reverse osmosis applications.<br>
The copolymers of the present invention can also be used as<br>
superplasticizers or retarders with cementitious materials in the construction<br>
industry applications. In addition, the polymers of the present invention are<br>
useful as viscosity modifiers to slurry viscosity in the mining and mineral<br>
processing and oil field operations.<br>
The present invention will now be further described with reference to a<br>
number of specific examples which are to be regarded solely as illustrative and<br>
not as restricting the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1.<br>
Preparation of Acrylic Acid/ Ammonium Allylpolyethoxy (10) Sulfate<br>
Copolymer<br>
A suitable reaction flask was equipped with a mechanical agitator, a<br>
thermometer, a reflux condenser, a nitrogen inlet and two addition inlets for the<br><br>
initiator and monomer solutions. The flask was charged with 73.5 g of deionized<br>
water and 58.5 g (0.1 mol) of ammonium allyl polyethoxy(10) sulfate. While<br>
sparging with nitrogen, the solution was heated to 85 °C. An initiator solution<br>
containing 2.2 g of 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (Wako V-50,<br>
from Wako Chemical Company) was sparged with nitrogen for ten minutes. The<br>
initiator solution and 21.6 g. (0.3 mol) of acrylic acid were added gradually to the<br>
reaction flask over a two-hour period. Following the addition, the solution was<br>
heated to 95 °C and held for 90 minutes. The reaction was then cooled to lower<br>
than 40 °C and 50% caustic solution was added until the pH measured 8-9. The<br>
structure of the resulting copolymer was verified by Carbon 13 NMR. The<br>
polymer solution was diluted to 30% solids and had a Brookfield viscosity of<br>
48.6 cps at 25 °C.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of Acrylic Acid/ Ammonium Allylpolyethoxy (10) Sulfate<br>
Copolymer<br>
Utilizing the procedure and apparatus similar to the prior example, 147 g<br>
of deionized water and 61.9 g (0.11 mol) of ammonium allyl polyethoxy(l0)<br>
sulfate (DVP-010, from Bimax Inc.) were charged to the reaction flask. The<br>
solution was heated to 85 °C. An initiator solution containing sodium persulfate<br>
1.9 g in water was sparged with nitrogen for ten minutes. The initiator .solution<br>
and 22.9 g (0.32 mol) of acrylic acid were gradually added to the reaction flask<br>
over a two-hour period. Following the addition, the solution was heated to 95 °C<br>
and held for 90 minutes. The reaction was cooled to lower than 40 °C and 50%<br>
caustic solution was added until the pH measured 4-5. The structure of the<br>
resulting copolymer was verified by Carbon 13 NMR. The polymer solution was<br>
diluted to 30% solids and had a Brookfield viscosity of 13.0 cps at 25 °C.<br>
Example 3<br><br>
Preparation of Acrylic Acid/ Ammonium Allylpolyethoxy (10)<br>

Phosphate Scale Inhibition - Bottle Test Protocol<br>
The testing of phosphate scale inhibition was undertaken in a static beaker<br>
test at varying treatment levels. The test protocol involved adding the treatment<br>
to a 100 ml solution containing calcium and phosphate ions and having a pH of<br>
8.2 at 70° C. After 18 hours, a portion was filtered hot and the pH adjusted to<br>
determination of phosphate concentrations in the treated, stock and control<br>
solutions. The solution appearance was evaluated by visual inspection and<br>
compared to stock solutions. The conditions of the tests were: 400 ppm Ca, 100<br>
ppm Mg and 35 ppm M-alkalinity all as CaCC3. Table 2 summarizes the percent<br>
inhibition of a known polymeric inhibitor/dispersant and polymers in accordance<br>
with the present invention over a broad range of treatment dosages. Table 3<br>
summarizes the percent inhibition of a known polymeric inhibitor/dispersant and<br>
polymers in accordance with the present invention over a broad range of treatment<br>
dosages in the presence of 3 ppm FeCl2 .The data in tables 2 and 3 show the<br>
efficacy of the polymeric treatments of the present invention compared to a<br>
known treatment.<br><br><br><br>
Example 10<br>
Phosphate Scale Inhibition - Dynamic Heat Transfer Simulations<br>
Developmental testing was also initiated with the AA/APES (3:1), Mw<br>
about 18,000, chemistry under dynamic heat transfer conditions in a laboratory<br>
scale cooling test rig. The water matrix contained 600 ppm Ca, 300 ppm Mg, 50<br>
ppm M-alkalinity (all asCaCC3), 15 ppm orthophosphate, 3 ppm pyrophosphate,<br>
1.2 ppm halogen substituted azole corrosion inhibitor, and either the AA/APES<br>
(Mw about 18,000), AA/AHPS (Mw about 15,000) or AA/AHPS/APES (Mw<br>
about 13,000) polymer. Operating parameters included a bulk temperature of 120°<br>
 heat transfer rate of 8,00Q(BTU/(ft2hr)across a mild steel heat transfer tube, a<br>
water velocity of 2.8 ft/se, a retention time of 1.4 days (to 75% depletion) and a<br>
test duration of 7 days. Both mild steel and admiralty brass coupons were also<br>
inserted into the test rig. A summary of the polymer comparison is shown below.<br><br><br>
In this simulation, three parameters are monitored which are indicative of<br>
polymer performance. They are 1) the bulk turbidity values which develop in the<br>
cooling water, 2) the average delta phosphate values (the difference between<br>
filtered and unfiltered phosphate concentrations), and 3) the amount of deposition<br>
which is observed on the heat transfer tube. Under this recirculating rig<br>
condition, 5 ppm AA/AHPS is necessary to maintain acceptable heat transfer<br>
deposit control. A lower dosage of 4 ppm AA/AHPS results in a failure as<br>
indicated by slight deposition having been observed on the tube surface. In<br>
contrast, 2 ppm of the AA/APES chemistry not only keeps bulk turbidity and<br>
delta phosphate values low but also keeps the heat transfer surface free of<br>
deposition. This is a significant reduction (60%) in the amount of polymer<br>
necessary to control deposition in this cooling water.<br>
Additional testing was conducted under two upset conditions, i.e. elevated<br>
temperature/heat flux and 3 ppm iron contamination. These results are shown below<br><br><br><br>
The high temperature/flux evaluations were conducted using a bulk<br><br>
temperature of l40o F and a heat flux of 16,00 across the mild steel<br>
heat transfer tube. Again, the AA/AHPS simulation, at a dosage of 5 ppm,<br>
resulted in a test failure with significant heat transfer deposition having been<br>
observed. During the 2 ppm AA/APES evaluation, only a very slight amount of<br>
deposit was observed under this stressed condition.<br>
The iron contamination studies were conducted by adding 0.5 ppm iron<br>
(Fe+2) to the cooling water after the initial 24 hours of the evaluation. At this<br>
point, continuous feed of an iron solution was initiated into the test rig targeting a<br>
3 ppm iron level, i.e. a 100 ppm Fe+2 solution was now fed to the rig at a rate of<br>
0.24 Under this condition, AA/AHPS was shown to be ineffective at<br>
both a 9 ppm and a 12 ppm dosage. Elevated turbidity (7-13 NTU) and delta<br>
phosphate values (1-3.7 ppm) were observed, in addition to unacceptable<br>
deposition having formed on the heat transfer surface. The AA/APES chemistry,<br>
at a lower dosage of 6 ppm, maintained a lower bulk turbidity (5.3 ntu), a lower<br>
delta phosphate value (0.6 ppm) and, most importantly, prevented deposition on<br>
the heat transfer tube surface.<br>
Example 11<br>
Silica Polymerization Inhibition<br>
Testing of silica polymerization inhibition was undertaken. The testing<br>
involved preparing 100 ml of a 500 ppm silica solution adjusted to pH 7.4, and<br>
adding 30 ppm of a treatment This solution was placed in a 30° C water bath and<br>
monomeric silica determinations were initiated and repeated every 30 minutes.<br>
The Hach Molybdate Reactive Silica test was utilized to determine the<br>
polymerization of silica. As polymerization occurs, the monomeric silica levels<br>
decrease. If the treatment is effective, elevated monomeric concentrations are<br>
realized relative to the untreated control. Tables 4 and 5 summarize the results of<br><br>
testing of several conventional treatments as well as a polymer in accordance with<br>
the present invention. At each time interval, the AA/APES chemistry maintains<br>
higher monomeric silica levels i.e. inhibits polymerization, than the other<br>
treatments.<br><br><br><br>

Silica Deposition Inhibition<br>
Bottle tests were conducted to evaluate the effects of treatments of the present<br>
invention on the solubility of silica and phosphate in the presence of aluminum.<br>
The test waters contained 700 ppm calcium, 185 ppm magnesium and 35 ppm M<br>
Alkalinity (all as CaCO3), 90 ppm S1O2, 14 ppm orthophosphate, 2 ppm<br>
pyrophosphate + a specific treatment. Treatments included a copolymer of<br>
AA/AHPS (Mw about 15,000), a second copolymer of AA/AHPS with a higher<br>
molecular weight (Mw about 55,000), and HEDP (hydroxyethylidene<br>
diphosphonic acid). The test waters were placed in 100 ml aliquots. A dosage of<br>
5.0 ppm Al3+ was added to each aliquot, the pH adjusted to 8.0 and the aliquots<br>
held at 130 °F overnight. Filtered/unfiltered (FAJF) analyses of the water<br>
constituents were then conducted. The following table shows the results.<br><br><br><br><br>
As the table shows, AA/AHPS 1 (Mw about 15,000), AA/AHPS-2 (Mw<br>
about 55,000), and AA/AHPS-2 + HEDP, were ineffective in maintaining<br>
solubility, even at very high dosages. In striking contrast, the AA/APES (Mw<br>
about 13,000) polymer kept all the species soluble, even when fed at lower<br>
dosages.<br>
