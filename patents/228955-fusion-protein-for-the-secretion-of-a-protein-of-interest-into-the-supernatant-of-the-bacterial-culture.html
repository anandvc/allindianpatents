USION PROTEIN FOR THE SECRETION OF A PROTEIN OF INTEREST INTO THE SUPERNATANT OF THE BACTERIAL CULTURE<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to fusion proteins comprising a fusion part and a protein of interest, the combination of the two proteins leading to the fusion protein being secreted into the supernatant of a bacteria! host and the protein of interest being present in its correct three-dimensional structure. The gene sequence for the fusion protein is part of an expression cassette which allows expression in a bacterial host. The invention relates to a process for the fermentation, expression and work-up of such a fusion protein using the expression cassette, to a plasmid containing the expression cassette, to a bacterial host cell containing the expression cassette integrated into the chromosome and/or as a replicon, for example as a plasmid, to said fusion protein with hinjdin or a derivative thereof as the fusion part, to a process for producing insulin or an insulin derivative and to the use of the expression cassette in the processes for preparing a fusion protein from hirudin or derivatives thereof and for producing insulin or an insulin derivative.<br>
The development of optimized processes for producing pharmaceuticals on the basis of recombinant proteins represents a task which has to do justice to two points of view, if possible. First, a process ought to be as cost-effective as possible and secondly, the product ought to be of the highest purity.<br>
In this connection, the choice of expression system determines the course of the particular production process, and it is obvious to the skilled worker that the development of novel protein-chemical techniques and the wide variety of biochemical possibilities and new combinations of known techniques always make improvements of existing processes possible.<br>
The properties of a desired protein determine in a decisive way the choice of the host cell system used for the synthesis. Bacteria such as E. coli represent the system with the aid of which it is possible to rapidly produce proteins with crude yields of several<br><br>
grams in iriexpensive media. The system comes in useful especially for proteins which need not be modified and which can be renatured in vitro to their biologically active form. For proteins which are needed in high quantities, such as insulin for example, expression rates leading to intracellular accumulation of the protein in the form of inclusion bodies are aimed at. After cell lysis, the protein is dissolved and then, in further process steps, folded. However, the process of folding is not quantitative. Reasons for this may be irreversible damage during inclusion body formation, corresponding damage during cell lysis and errors during folding. "Wrongly" folded or modified molecules then have to be removed in further separation steps. This has an adverse effect on production costs. In addition, traces of said molecules reappear also in the final product. Since pharmaceuticals are subject to high criteria of purity, an appropriately careful and cost-intensive purification is necessary. Owing to the favorable cost / crude yield ratio, processes allowing export by E. coli of the protein of interest in correctly folded form into the culture medium would be of desirable. However, this has been successful only in exceptional cases up until now.<br>
The international patent application PCT/EPOO/08537 describes such an exception. Synthesis and export of lepirudin, the active ingredient of the pharmaceutical RefludanÂ®, by E. coli in gram quantities was successful when using specific signal sequences for exporting. The German patent application No. 100 33 195.2 (unpublished) describes a bifunctional protein composed of hirudin and hinjdin derivatives and of factor Xa inhibitor from ticks and derivatives thereof. Said protein can likewise be synthesized and exported by E. coli with high yields. As an addition to this finding, it was then surprisingly found that hirudin is exported with high yields not only as a fusion protein with TAP but also as part of a fusion protein with polypeptides such as proinsulin derivatives, that it is biologically active and that surprisingly a fusion partner such as proinsulin is present in the correct three-dimensional structure. This unexpected result leads to the possibility of more cost-effective production of, for example, insulin by bacterial host/vector systems, since the step of in vitro refolding after intracellular expression, which is associated with losses in yield which are not negligible, can be dispensed with and in this way a simpler protein purification process results. Another advantage is that chaotropic aids which are added to dissolve the<br><br>
fusion protein in traditional processes for the production of insulin in E. coli are not required. Ecologically, this leads to less environmental pollution by avoiding the corresponding waste.<br>
Leeches of the Hirudo type have developed, for example, various isoforms of the thrombin inhibitor hirudin. Hirudin has been optimized for pharmaceutical requiremenis by artificial variation of the molecule, for example exchange of the N-terminal amino acid (e.g. EP-A 0 324 712).<br>
The invention includes the use of hirudin and hirudin variants for the formation of fusion proteins, for example with simian proinsulin or derivatives thereof. Particular embodiments of the invention use one of the natural hirudin isofomns (the natural isoforms together are denoted "hirudin"). Natural isoforms are, for example. Val-Val-hirudin or lle-Thr-hirudin. Other embodiments of the invention use a variant of a natural hinjdin isoform. A variant is derived from a natural hirudin isoform but contains, for example, additional amino acids and/or amino acid deletions and/or amino acid exchanges compared with the natural isoform. A hirudin variant may contain alternating peptide segments of natural hirudin isoforms and new amino acids. Hirudin variants are known and are described, for example, in DE 3 430 556. Hirudin variants are commercially available in the form of proteins (CalbiochemÂ® Biochemicals. Cat.no.377-853. -950-960).<br>
Insulin is a polypeptide of 51 amino acids which are distributed between two amino acid chains: the A chain with 21 amino acids and the B chain with 30 amino acids. The chains are connected to one another by 2 disulfide bridges. Insulin compositions have been used for many years for the therapy of diabetes. This includes the use not only of naturally occurring insulins but also of insulin derivatives and analogs.<br>
Insulin derivatives are derivatives of naturally occurring insulins, namely human insulin or animal insulins, which differ from the corresponding, otherwise identical naturally occurring insulin by substitution of at least one naturally occurring amino acid residue and/or addition of at least one amino acid residue and/or organic residue.<br><br>
n general, insulin derivatives have a slightly modified action compared with human nsulin.<br>
nsulin derivatives having an accelerated onset of action are described in<br>
IP 0 214 826, EP 0 375 437 and EP 0 678 522. EP 0 124 826 inter alia relates to<br>
substitutions of B27 and B28. EP 0 678 522 describes insulin derivatives which have a*<br>
)osition B29 various amino acids, preferably proline, but not glutamic acid.<br>
EP 0 375 437 includes insulin derivatives with lysine or arginine at B28, which may<br>
additionally be modified at B3 and/or A21, where appropriate.<br>
EP 0 419 504 discloses insulin derivatives which are protected against chemical nodification by modification of asparagine at B3 and of at least one other amino acid jt positions A5. A15. A18 or A21.<br>
VO 92/00321 describes insulin derivatives in which at least one amino acid at )ositions B1-B6 has been replaced by lysine or arginine. According to WO 92/00321, isulins of this kind exhibit a prolonged action.<br>
Vhen producing insulin and insulin derivatives by genetic engineering, an insulin irecursor, "proinsulin", comprising B, C and A chains is frequently expressed. Said iroinsulin can be converted into insulin or an insulin derivative by enzymatic or hemical removal of the C chain after appropriate and correct folding and formation of le disulfides bridges. Proinsulin is frequently expressed in the form of a fusion protein, "he "unwanted" fusion partner likewise needs be removed chemically or enzymatically.<br>
: is obvious to the skilled worker that the choice of recombinant host/vector systems etermines the methods for cultivation, propagation and fermentation of the 3Combinant cells. This is likewise a subject of the invention.<br>
he fusion protein shows surprisingly good solubility in acidic medium, and this leads D distinct advantages regarding the chemical workup of the protein. Firstly, many<br><br>
unwanted components of the supernatant are precipitated under said conditions and, secondly, peptidases or proteases are inactive. Thus, acidifying the fermentation broth at the end of the operation makes it possible to directly separate unwanted supernatant proteins together with the host cells from the fusion protein and, in a 5 further step, to concentrate said fusion protein. This is likewise a subject of the invention.<br>
At the end of the fermentation, the folding process may not yet be 100% complete. The addition of mercaptan or, for example, cysteine hydrochloride can complete the 10 process. This is likewise a subject of the invention.<br>
If the two proteins are fused via a linker of amino acids which are specifically recognized by endoproteases which efficiently cleave the fusion protein at no other position, then the protein of interest can be cleaved off directly in active form. In the<br>
15 case of insulin production, the linker between hinjdin and proinsulin preferably contains arginine at the carboxy-terminal end. In simultaneous processing it is then possible by conversion with trypsin to cleave off the fusion part and convert proinsulin to mono- or di-Arg-insulin. Said linker must be optimized in relation to insulin processing such that cleaving off the hirudin part is not slower than cleavages in the C peptide sequence or<br>
20 a derivative thereof which links the B and A chains of insulin. This is likewise a subject of the invention. An example of an expression system which can be used is the vector pJF118, described in figure 1 of European patent 0 468 539.<br>
Plasmids which contain DNA sequences encoding proinsulin or proinsulin derivatives 25 are described, for example, in the patents EP-A 0 489 780 and PCT/EPOO/08537.<br>
The plasmid pK152 which contains the sequence for hirudin according to EP-A 0 324 712 is used as source of the DNA sequence for hirudin.<br>
30 The export compatibility of the protein of interest for passing through the inner bacterial membrane is important for secretion. In this context, the choice of signal sequence which can be more or less optimal for different proteins is important. The patent<br><br>
application PCT/EPOO/08537 describes a system of PCR-based signal sequence screening. This system can also be applied to fusion proteins having hirudin as the N-terminal fusion part, since hirudin activity surprisingly remains intact and thus becomes readily detectable in the supernatant by means of the thrombin inhibition assay. 5 The invention therefore relates to a DNA (alternative term: expression cassette) encoding a fusion protein of the form<br>
) where <br>
F        is a DNA sequence coding for an amino acid sequence which allows<br>
secretion of a protein Y into a fermentation medium, As      is a chemical bond or a DNA sequence coding for an amino acid<br>
encodable by the genetic code,<br>
m       is an integer from 0-10.<br>
R        is a chemical bond or an arginine codon,<br>
n	is 0 or 1. and<br>
Y        is a DNA sequence coding for a protein of interest which, correctly folded,<br>
is part of the fusion protein in the fermentation medium, choosing in particular a DNA sequence coding for himdin or a derivative thereof (F) and proinsulin or a derivative thereof (Y).<br>
The invention further relates to an expression cassette (alternative term: DNA-molecule) of the form<br>
where <br>
P	is a promoter,<br>
S	is a DNA sequence coding for a signal sequence allowing optimal yields,<br>
T	is an untranslated expression-enhancing DNA sequence.<br><br>
The invention further relates to a plasmid containing an above-described expression cassette and to a host cell containing said plasmid or to a host cell which preferably contains the expression cassette integrated into the host genome, the host cell being selected from a group comprising E.coti, B. subtilis and Streptomyces,<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the fermentative production of a fusion protein as described above, in which process<br>
(a)	an DNA molecule as described above is expressed in a host cell as described above and<br>
(b)	the expressed fusion protein is isolated;<br>
in which, in particular, the supernatant is separated from the host cells to isolate the expressed protein, and the expressed protein is isolated from the supernatant; and in which a process step for concentrating the expressed protein in the supernatant after precipitation is selected from a group comprising microfiltration. hydrophobic interaction chromatography and ion exchange chromatography, and in which a particular embodiment is that isolation of the expressed protein includes a step in which components of the culture medium or the supernatant are precipitated, while the expressed protein remains in solution; and in which in a further preferred embodiment of the invention, after the fermentation, merc3ptan or cysteine hydrochloride are added to the fermentation supernatant at pH 6 - 9. resulting in a free SH group concentration of from 0.05 to 2,5 mM.<br>
A particular embodiment of the invention comprises separating the fermentation supernatant from the host cells, further culturing the host cells in fresh medium and isolating the released fusion protein from the supernatant. In other words, a further embodiment of the invention is a process as described above, in which process after separating the fermentation supernatant from the host cells, the host cells are repeatedly cultured in fresh medium, and the released fusion protein is isolated from each supernatant obtained during cultivation.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for the production of insulin or an insulin derivative, in which process<br><br>
(a)	from the expressed protein which is obtained in a process as described above<br>
(b)	the protein of interest, in particular insulin or insulin derivative, is released by enzymatic or chemical cleavage and<br>
(c)	is isolated.<br>
The following examples which are not intended to be restrictive describe the invention in more detail.<br>

FEMS Microbiol Lett.127,263 ^272. 1995 ). This vector serves to construct a<br>
Refludan-GNSAR-simian proinsulin fusion protein (GNSAR=SEQ ID NO.: 1) and is<br>
denoted pBpfu_hir. )<br>

The pan of primer Hirjnsrevl shown in bold type hybridizes with the DNA region encoding the junction of preproinsulin and simian proinsulin sequences in plasmid pINT90d and with sequences of the 3' end of the hirudin sequence in plasmid pK152. Primer Hirjnsrevl is 100% complementary to primer Hirjnsfl. Primer InsullHindlll marks the 3' end of the DNA region cloned in pINTQOd and encoding the simian proinsulin sequence and additionally carries the hexanucleotide sequence for recognition by the restriction enzyme Hindlll.<br>
Two standard polymerase chain reactions are carried out using the Hirjnsfl / InsullHindlll primer pair with plasmid plNT90d as template and the pfuf1/ Hirjnsrev primer pair with plasmid pBpfu_hir as template. The products of both reactions are combined and an aliquot is converted in a third polymerase chain reaction with primers pfuf1/lnsu11 Hindlll. The result is a DNA product which contains the sequence signal (partially)-lepirudin-GNSAR- simian proinsulin.

(Shuttieworth H., Taylor J.. Minton N.; Nucleic Acids Res. 14:8689, (1986)),<br>
The peptide sequence is translated into DNA by the GCG program Backtranslate (Wisconsin Package Version 10.1, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, Wise.) using the E. coli high codon usage criteria.<br>

Corresponding to example 1, two standard polymerase chain reactions are carried out i using the Hirjnsfl / Insul 1 Hindlll primer pair with pINTQOd DNA as template and the phoafi / Hir^insrev primer pair with pK152 DNA as template. The products of both reactions are combined and an aliquot is converted in a third polymerase chain reaction with primers phoa /Insul 1 Hindlll. The result is a DNA product which contains the sequence signal-Ala-hirudin-GNSAR- simian proinsulin. The DNA fragment is ' converted using restriction enzymes BamHI and Hindlll.In a parallel reaction, vector PJF118 is converted using the two enzymes and the large vector fragment is isolated. The isolated products of both reactions are converted in a T4-ligase reaction. Competent cells of E. coli strain K12 Mc1061 are transformed with the ligation mixture, and plasmid DNA is isolated from transformants for characterization. At the same time, a plate with the transformants characterized by plasmid analysis is produced for maintenance purposes. The DNA is characterized by means of restriction analysis and DNA sequence analysis. A plasmid identified as correct was denoted pNS22.<br>
Example 4: Thrombin inhibition assay<br>
The hirudin concentration is determined according to the method of Grielibach et al. (Thrombosis Research 37, pp. 347 -350 , 1985 ). For this purpose, specific amounts of a Refludan standard are included in the measurements in order to establish a calibration cun/e from which the yield in mg/l can be determined directly. The biological activity is also a direct measure for correct folding of the proinsulin component of the fusion protein. Alternatively, it is possible to use a proteolytic S. aureus digestion and subsequent analysis in an RP-HPLC system to detennine the correct S-S bridge formation.<br><br>
Example 5: Expression of the fusion protein<br>
Recombinant ceils are cultivated overnight in 2YT medium (per liter: 16 g of tryptone, I 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCI ) containing 100 pg/ml ampicillin. The overnight culture is diluted 1:50 with fresh medium and the cells are cultivated to a density of approximately 0.8 ODeoo-<br>
Expression is then induced by adding IPTG in such a way that a concentration of 0.05-) 2 mM is established. The cells induced in this way are incubated for a further 3-26 h.<br>
After three hours, an antithrombin action of hirudin is clearly measurable in the supernatant. Said action can be attributed to secretion of the desired fusion protein, since SDS PAGE analysis, after Coomassie blue staining, reveals only in induced cells<br>
i a new band which reacts in Western blot analysis with polyclonal anti-insulin antibodies. In fermentation experiments, induction is commenced only after cultivation to significantly higher optical densities. Preference is given here to synthetic media based on minimal medium. Cell productivity can be increased by using the principle of bacterial milking, i.e. by<br>
I carefully removing the cells, after the optimal induction time, from the supernatant and further incubating them in fresh medium to which the inducer can again be added. Insulin is then prepared in parallel from the harvested supernatant.<br>
' Example 6: Purification of the fusion protein<br>
After induction has finished, the cell supernatant is adjusted to pH 2.5 - 3 and cells and supernatant components are removed by centrifugation or filtration. The supernatant of the precipitation is applied to a cation exchange column (S - Hyper DF. âº Source 30S) and fractionated using a linear gradient from 150 to 450 mM NaCI at pH 3.5 in the presence of 30% 2-propanol. The individual fractions are analyzed by means of RP-HPLC. The proinsulin-hirudin fusion protein is eluted at an NaCI<br><br>
concentration of about 300 mM. Sufficiently pure fractions are combined, diluted with 0,1% TFA and applied to an RP column (PLRP -S 7.5 x 50 mm) by pumping. Elution is cam'ed out using a gradient of 25-50% acetonitrile. Two groups effractions are pooled. After removing the solvent, the material is freeze-dried. The purity of the material is checked by means of SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The purified fusion protein is analyzed by mass spectrometry (ESI). The experimentally determined molecular weight of the fusion protein corresponds to its theoretically expected molecular weight after removal of the signal peptide.<br>
Example 7: Determination of the disulfide bridge linkage<br>
The fusion protein is digested with trypsin and the fragments formed are analyzed by means of RP-HPLC and subsequently by means of mass spectrometry. A fragment which is recognized as de"(B30) insulin, due to its mass of 5706 Da, is successfully identified. This product is subjected to S. aureus V8 protease digestion. RP-HPLC analysis shows the expected peptide pattern.<br>
Trypsin cleavage is carried out as follows:<br>
The freeze-dried fusion protein is dissolved in 50 mMTris-HCI pH 8 (1 mg/ml), and trypsin (1 jjg per mg of fusion protein) is added. Trypsin is inactivated at pH 3 at the end of the reaction.<br>
The S. aureus digestion is carried out as follows:<br>
The isolated de-( B30) insulin is dissolved in water at pH 8. S. aureus protease (1/50 of the amount of insulin) is added, and the mixture is incubated at 37^C for 5 hours and then at room temperature overnight.<br>
Example 8: Purification of insulin<br><br>
In contrast to nnost other polypeptides found in the supernatant due to either spontaneous lysis of host cells or secretion, the fusion protein is surprisingly not precipitated at pH 2.5-3,5. The culture medium is therefore acidified appropriately and then, after completion of the precipitation, the precipitate and the cells are removed by &gt; centrifugation or by microfiltration and concentrated.<br>
Subsequently, the medium is adjusted to pH 6.8 and the fusion protein content is determined in parallel by analytical HPLC measurement. The determination is followed by adding trypsin to the supernatant so that trypsin is at approx. 1 pg per 1-1.5 mg of ) fusion protein. After incubation at room temperature for approx. 4 hours, purification is carried out by cation exchange chromatography at pH 3.5 in the presence of 2-propanol. Elution is carried out in the buffer by applying a gradient of from 0.15 to 0.45 M.<br>
Di-Arg-insulin is eluted at approx. 0.3 M. After 1:1 dilution, di-Arg-insulin is precipitated from the insulin-containing fractions at pH 6.8 with the addition of a 10% strength ZnCl2 solution. Insulin is filtered off and then dissolved in 0.05 M Tris-HCI (pH 8.5) resulting in a 2 mg/ml solution:<br>
Then the amount of approximately 1 unit of carboxypeptidase B per 100ml solution is added and the reaction is carried out with gentle stirring. The pH is then adjusted to pH 5.5 with citric acid, and insulin is crystallized in the presence of ZnCl2. The crystals are removed, dissolved and, after purification by RP-HPLC. insulin is purified again by crystallization.<br>
Example 9: Processing of the fusion protein directly in the culture medium<br>
At the end of the expression period, the culture medium is adjusted to pH 6.8 and trypsin is then added with stirring so that a final concentration of 4-8 mg per liter is established. After incubation for approx. 4 hours, the fermentation broth treated in this way is adjusted to pH 2.5-3. After 1-6 hours of precipitation, the pH is raised to 3.5, and the di-Arg-insulin formed is purified via cation exchange chromatography in the<br><br>
presence of 30% 2-propanoi. Elution is carried out by means of an NaCI gradient of 0.05-0.5 M salt The product-containing fractions are diluted 1:1 with H2O and then ZnCl2 is added, so that a 0.1% strength ZnCb solution is formed. Di-Arg-insulin precipitates at pH 6.8 and by way of example is converted to insulin according to ! example 8.<br>
