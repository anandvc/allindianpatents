				<td>SUBSTITUTED 4-AMINO-l-(PYRJDYLMETHYL)PIPERIDINE AND RELATED COMPOUNDS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to substituted 4-amino-l-(pyridylmethyl)-piperidine and related compounds which are useful as muscarinic receptor antagonists. This invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions-comprising such compounds; methods of using such compounds for treating medical conditions mediated by muscarinic receptors; and processes and intermediates for preparing such compounds.<br>
State of the Art<br>
The muscarinic receptor family comprises five known receptor subtypes, i.e., M,, M2, M3, M4 and M5 receptors, with each receptor subtype having a distinct distribution and function. For example, smooth muscle tissues typically express both M2 and M3 receptor subtypes and these receptors serve to mediate the contraction of these tissues.<br>
As a result, compounds that act as muscarinic receptor antagonists are known to be useful for treating various medical conditions associated with improper smooth muscle function, such as overactive bladder (OAB), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These smooth muscle function disorders are highly prevalent in society resulting in enormous economic costs. For example, in the United States alone, an estimated 30 million people, primarily women and the elderly, suffer from overactive bladder and approximately $10 billion are spent annually treating this condition. More importantly, the quality of life and self-esteem of patients afflicted with these disorders is often significantly impaired.<br><br>
Until recently, most compounds which act as muscarinic receptor antagonists were relatively non-selective for the various muscarinic receptor subtypes. As a result, such compounds often produced unpleasant side-effects, such as dry-mouth, constipation, blurred vision, or cognitive side effects. The most common of these side-effects is dry-mouth which results from inhibition of M3 receptors in the salivary gland. This dry-mouth side effect is often so severe that an estimated 80 to 85 percent of patients being treated for overactive bladder discontinue their medication within six months and, as a result, their condition goes untreated.<br>
Accordingly, a need exists for new muscarinic receptor antagonists, hi particular, a need exists for new muscarinic receptor antagonists which selectively inhibit M2 receptors relative to M3 receptors. Such compounds are expected to be particularly effective for treating smooth muscle disorders mediated by M2 and M3 receptor subtypes, such as overactive bladder, while reducing or eliminating the dry-mouth, constipation and blurred vision side-effects mediated predominately by the M3 receptor subtype.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel substituted 4-amino-l-<br>
(pyridylmemyl)piperidine and related compounds which are useful as muscarinic receptor antagonists. Among other properties, compounds of this invention have been found to be potent inhibitors of M2 receptor activity.

In a preferred method of synthesis, the compounds of formula I are prepared as illustrated in Scheme A (the substituents and variables shown in the following Schemes have the definitions provided herein unless otherwise indicated). (Figure Remove)<br><br>
As shown in Scheme A, a compound of formula 1 is first reacted with alcohol 2, where L1 is a suitable leaving group, such as bromo, iodo, tosyl, mesyl and the like, to provide intermediate 3. Typically, this reaction is conducted by contacting 1 with at least<br>
t<br>
one equivalent, preferably with about 1.0 to about 1.1 equivalents, of alcohol 2 in an inert diluent, such as acetonitrile and the like. This reaction is generally conducted hi presence of excess base; preferably, in the presence of about 2 to about 4 equivalent of a base, such<br><br>
as a trialkylamine, preferably triethylamine. Typically, this reaction is conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 80°C, preferably about 40 to 50°C, for about 1 to 24 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. If desired, the resulting intermediate 3 is readily purified by standard procedures, such as chromatography, recrystallization and the like.<br>
The alcohols of formula 2 used in this reaction are either commercially available or can be prepared from commercially available starting materials and reagents using well-known procedures. Representative alcohols of formula 2 include, by way of example, 7-chloro-l-heptanol, 8-chloro-l-octanol, 9-chloro-l-nonanol, 7-bromo-l-heptanol, 8-bromo-l-octanol, 9-bromo-l-nonanol, 7-iodo-l-heptanol, 8-iodo-l-octanol, 9-iodo-1-nonanol, 7-bromo-3-oxaheptan-l-ol, 7-bromo-4-oxaheptan-l-ol, 7-bromo-5-oxaheptan-1-ol, 8-bromo-3-oxaoctan-l-ol, 8-bromo-4-oxaoctan-l-ol, 8-bromo-5-oxaoctan-1-ol, 8-bromo-6-oxaoctan-l-ol, 8-bromo-3-oxaoctan-l-ol, 9-bromo-3-oxanonan-1-ol, 9-bromo-4-oxanonan-l-ol, 9-bromo-5-oxanonan-l-ol, 9-bromo-6-oxanonan-1-ol, 9-bromo-7-oxanonan-l-ol and the like.<br>
The hydroxyl group of intermediate 3 is then oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde to provide intermediate 4. This reaction is typically conducted by contacting 3 with an excess amount of a suitable oxidizing agent. Any oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing a hydroxyl group to an aldehyde may be used in this reaction including chromium (VI) reagents, such as dipyridine chromium (VI) oxide, pyridinium chlorochromate, pyridinium dichromate and the like; and activated dimethyl sulfoxide reagents, such oxalyl chloride/DMSO, sulfur trioxide pyridine complex/DMSO/trialkylamme and the like.<br>
Preferably, this reaction is conducted using an excess of sulfur trioxide pyridine complex and dimethyl sulfoxide in the presence of a trialkylamine, such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and the like. Typically, this reaction is conducted by contacting 3 with about 2.5 to about 3.5 equivalents of sulfur trioxide pyridine complex and an excess, preferably about 10 equivalents, of dimethyl sulfoxide in the presence of an excess,<br>
preferably about 5 equivalents, of diisopropylethylamine in an inert diluent, such as<br>
t<br>
dichloromethane. This reaction is generally conducted at a temperature ranging from about -30°C to about 0°C, preferably at about -10 to about -20°C, for about 0.25 to about 2 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. Optionally, the resulting aldehyde<br><br>
intermediate 4 is then purified using standard procedures, such as chromatography, recrystallization and the like.<br>
Alternatively, aldehyde intermediate 4 can be prepared by first reacting 1 with a compound of the formula:<br>
LMCH2)a- (0)b—(CH2)(&gt;-rCH(OR«')2<br>
or |J-(CH2)a — (0)b— (CH2)C— CH=CH2<br>
or OHC-{CH2)a— (0)b—(CH2)c^-CH(OR"i)2<br>
wherein each L1, Rm, a, b and c are as defined herein, to provide an intermediate of the formula Vb or Vd. Ozonolysis of the olefin in Vd (i.e., using O3, followed by decomposition of the ozonide with a reducing agent, such as trimethyl phosphite, dimethyl sulfide and the like) then affords aldehyde 4. Alternatively, hydrolysis of the acetal of formula Vb (i.e., using aqueous acid) also affords aldehyde 4.<br>
Aldehyde intermediate 4 is then coupled with 4-amino-l-<br>
(pyridylmethyl)piperidine intermediate 5 to afford a compound of formula 6. Typically, this reaction is conducted by contacting aldehyde 4 with about 1.0 to about 1.2 equivalents of § in the presence of an excess, preferably about 1.2 to about 1.5 equivalent, of a suitable reducing agent in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane. Suitable reducing agents include, by way of illustration, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride and the like. Preferably, the reducing agent is sodium triacetoxyborohydride. Generally, this reaction is conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 30°C for about 6 to about 24 hours, or until the reaction is<br>
substantially complete. The resulting compound of formula 6 is typically purified using<br>
i<br>
standard procedures, such as chromatography, recrystallization and the like.<br>
If desired, alcohol 3 can also be oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid using a strong oxidizing agent, such as chromic acid, permanganate, nitric acid and the<br><br>
like. The resulting carboxylic acid can then be coupled with 4-amino-l-(pyridylmethyl)piperidine intermediate 5 to form an amide and the resulting amide reduced with a reducing agent, such as diisobutylaluminum hydride, to afford compound 6.<br>
The compounds of formula 1 employed in the reactions described herein are readily prepared by the procedures illustrated in Scheme B. (Figure Remove)<br><br>
As illustrated in Scheme B, diphenylacetonitrile 7 is reacted with intermediate 8, where L2 is a suitable leaving group, such as chloro, bromo? iodo, tosyl, mesyl and the<br>
like, and P1 is an amino-protecting group, such as benzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, 4-nitrobenzyl, ethoxycarbonyl, phenylcarbonyl and the like, to provide intermediate 9. Typically, this reaction is conducted by first forming the anion of compound 7 by contacting 7 with excess, preferably about 1.4 to about 1.6 equivalents, of a strong base, such as potassium tert-butoxide, in an inert diluent, such as tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature ranging from about -10°C to about 10°C for about 0.5 to about 2.0 hours. The resulting anion is then reacted in situ with about 0.95 to about 1.05 equivalents of 8 at a temperature ranging from about 20°C to about 50°C for about 10 to about 48 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. Compounds of formula 8, where L2 is a sulfonate ester leaving group, are readily prepared from the corresponding alcohol using conventional procedures and reagents. For example, (iS)-l-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinol is readily converted to («y)-l-benzyl-3-(p-toluenesulfonyloxy)pyrrolidine by treatment with about 1.1 equivalents ofp-toluenesulfonyl chloride and about 1.2 equivalents of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO). Other compounds of formula § can be prepared by similar procedures using commercially available starting materials and reagents.<br>
Compound 9 is then deprotected using conventional procedures and reagents to afford compound 10. For example, if P1 in compound 9 is a benzyl protecting group, the benzyl group is readily removed by transfer hydrogenolysis using a hydrogen source, such as ammonium formate, and a catalyst, such as palladium on carbon. Preferably, this reaction is conducted using the hydrochloride or hydrobromide salt of compound 9 or hi the presence of an acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, formic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid,p-toluenesulfonic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid and the like. This hydrogenolysis reaction can also be conducted using hydrogen and a catalyst in the presence of an acid. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6.005,119, issued December 21, 1999 to N. Mori etal.<br>
The nitrile group of compound 10 is then hydrolyzed to the corresponding amide (i.e., ~C(O)NH2) to provide a compound of formula 11. This reaction is typically conducted by contacting 10 with aqueous sulfuric acid, preferably 80% sulfuric acid, at a temperature ranging from about 70°C to about 100°C, preferably about 90°C, for about 12<br>
i<br>
to about 36 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. As shown in Scheme B, hydrolysis of the nitrile group to the amide can also be performed before removal of the protecting group to afford 12, which can then be deprotected to provide compound 11.<br>
If desired, the nitrile group of compound £ or 10 can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acid (i.e., -COOH) using, for example, aqueous sodium hydroxide containing about 6 to about 12 % hydrogen peroxide.. The resulting carboxylic acid can then be coupled to various amines (i.e., ReReNH, where Re is as defined herein) to form substititued amides using well-known procedures and reagents.<br>

(Figure Remove)<br><br>
As shown in Scheme C, a compound of formula 13, where P2 is an amino protecting group (such as benzyl), is first reductively alkylated with an aldehyde or ketone to provide a compound of formula 14- Compounds of formula 13 are either commercially<br>
available or can be prepared from commercially available starting materials using known reagents and procedures. A preferred compound of formula 13 is 4-amino-l-benzylpiperidine which is commercially available from, for example, Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc.<br>
Aldehydes and ketones suitable for use in this reaction include, by way of example, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, acetone, cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde, and the like.<br>
Typically, this reaction is conducted by contacting 13 with an excess, i.e., at least 1.1 equivalents of the aldehyde or ketone hi the presence of an excess, preferably about 1.1 to about 1.3 equivalents, of a suitable reducing agent in an inert diluent, such as methanol. Suitable reducing agents include, by way of illustration, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride and the like. Preferably, the reducing agent is sodium triacetoxyborohydride. Generally, this reaction is conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 30°C for about 1 to about 6 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. The resulting compound of formula 14 is typically purified using standard procedures, such as chromatography, recrystallization and the like.<br>
The 4-amino group of the compound of formula 14 is then protected to provide a compound of formula 15. where P3 is an amino-protectmg group. Preferably, P2 and P3 are different protecting groups which are selected to allow P2 to be selectively removed in the presence of P3. For example, when P2 is a benzyl group, P3 is preferably a tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC); benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz); or 9-fluorenyhnethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group; or the like. When P3 is a terf-butoxycarbonyl group, compound 15 is typically prepared by contacting 14 with about 1.0 to about 1.2 equivalents of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane. Typically, this reaction is conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 30°C for about 6 to about 48 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete.<br>
Compound 15 is then deprotected using standard procedures and reagents to afford compound 16. For example, when P2 is a benzyl group, the protecting group is removed by hydrogenolysis using a catalyst, such as palladium on carbon. Typically, this<br>
i<br>
reaction is conducted by contacting 15 with hydrogen at a pressure ranging from about 40 to about 60 psi in the presence of a catalyst, such as 10% palladium on carbon. This reaction is generally conducted hi an inert diluent, such as ethanol, at ambient temperature for about 12 to 48 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete.<br>
Compound 16. is then coupled with aldehyde 17 under reductive alkylation conditions to provide compound 18. The aldehydes of formula 17 used in this reaction are commercially available or can be prepared from commercially available starting materials using known reagents and procedures. Representative aldehydes suitable, for use in this reaction include, by way of example, 3-methoxypyridine-2-carboxaldehyde, 3-methoxypyridine-4-carboxaldehyde, 2-meihoxypyridine-3-carboxaldehyde, 4-rnethoxypyridine-3-carboxaldehyde; and the like. The preparation of 2-methoxypyridine-3-carboxaldehyde, 3-methoxypyridine-2-carboxaldehyde, 4-methoxypyridine-3-carboxaldehyde from 2-methoxypyridine, 3-methoxypyridine and 4-methoxypyridine, respectively, is described in J. Org. Chem., 1990,55,69-73.<br>
Typically, the coupling reaction is conducted by contacting 16 with about 0.9 to about 1.1 equivalents of 17 in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane, at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 50°C, preferably at ambient temperature, for about 1 to about 6 hours. The resulting irnine is typically not isolated, but is reacted in situ with an excess, preferably about 1.1 to about 1.3 equivalents, of a suitable reducing agent. Suitable reducing agents include, by way of example, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride and the like. Preferably, the reducing agent is sodium triacetoxyborohydride. Generally, this reduction reaction is conducted at a temperature ranging from about -10°C to about 25°C for about 0.5 to about 12 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. The resulting compound of formula 18 is typically purified using standard procedures, such as chromatography, recrystallization and the like.<br>
Compound 18 is then deprotected using standard procedures and reagents to afford compound 5. For example, when P3 is a terf-butoxycarbonyl group, the protecting group is removed by treating 18 with aqueous hydrochloric acid in an inert diluent, such as dioxane. Typically, this reaction is conducted by contacting 18 with concentrated hydrochloric acid in dioxane, initially at a temperature of about 0°C to about 10°C for about 0.25 to 1 hour, and then at ambient temperature for about 6 to about 24 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. The resulting compound of formula 5 is<br>
V<br>
typically purified using standard procedures, such as chromatography, recrystallization and the like.<br>
Alternatively, instead of coupling aldehyde 17 with 16, a carboxylic acid<br>
corresponding to 17 can be coupled to 16 using standard coupling reagents and reaction conditions to form an amide. The amide can then be reduced with a reducing agent, such as lithium aluminum hydride, to form intermediate 5.<br>
It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the synthetic steps illustrated in Schemes A, B and C can be conducted in a different order from that shown, or by using different reagents from those described, to produce the compounds of formula 6.<br>
For example, intermediate 14 can be coupled to aldehyde 4 in place of compound 5 using the procedures described herein. After removal of the protecting group (i.e., P2) from the resulting intermediate, aldehyde 17 can be coupled to the piperidine nitrogen using the procedures described herein to afford compounds of formula 6.<br>
Additionally, instead of oxidizing the hydroxyl group of intermediate 3 to an aldehyde, this hydroxyl group can be converted into a leaving group, such as a chloro, bromo, iodo, mesylate or tosylate, using conventional reagents and reaction procedures. The resulting leaving group is then readily displaced with 4-amino-l-(pyridyhnethyl)piperidine £ to afford compound 6. Alternatively, this leaving group can also be displaced with intermediate 14 to provide compounds of formula 6 after deprotection and coupling to aldehyde 17 as described above.<br>

Preferably, this reaction is conducted using about 1.0 to about 1.1 equivalents of sodium triacetoxyborohydride and about 1.0 equivalents of acetic acid. Typically, this reaction is conducted in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane, at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 50°C, preferably at ambient temperature, for about 0.25 to about 6 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete.<br>

The alkyne intermediate of formula 20 is then coupled to 4-amino-l-(pyridylmethyl)piperidine § using formaldehyde and a copper (I) catalyst to afford intermediate 24. Typically, the reaction is conducted by contacting 20 with about 1.05 to about 1.2 equivalents of 5 and about 1.2 to about 1.4 equivalents of paraformaldehyde in the presence of a catalytic amount, preferably about 0.2 equivalents, of a copper (I) salt, such as copper (I) chloride. Typically, the reaction is carried out hi an inert diluent, such as tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature ranging from about 25°C to about 75°C for about 2 to about 24 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete.<br>
The resulting intermediate of formula 21 is then reduced to provide a compound of formula 22. Preferably, this reduction is conducted by contacting 2JL with excess, preferably with about 10 equivalents, ofp-toluenesulfonhydrazide, and an excess, preferably about 20 equivalents, of sodium acetate. Typically, this reaction is conducted by contacting of a solution of 21 and^-toluenesulfon-hydrazide in an inert diluent, such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, with an aqueous solution of sodium acetate at a temperature ranging from about 50°C to about 100°C for about 12 to about 48 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. The resulting compound of formula 22 is typically purified using standard procedures, such as chromatography, recrystallization and the like.<br>
Compounds of this invention can also be prepared by the procedure illustrated in<br>
Scheme E.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
As shown in Scheme E, 4-aniino-l-(pyridylmemyl)piperidine 5 can be reacted with compound 23. where L3 is a leaving group, such as chloro or bromo, and P4 is a<br>
carboxy-protecting group, such as a methyl or ethyl; to provide amide intermediate 24.<br>
i This reaction is typically conducted by contacting 5 with about 1.0 to about 1.2<br>
equivalents of compound 23 in the presence of excess, preferably about 1.2 to about 2.0 equivalents of a trialkylamine, such as AyV-diisopropylethylamine. This reaction is<br><br>
typically conducted in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane, at a temperature ranging from about -10°C to about 25°C for about 1 to about 24 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete.<br>
Amide 24 is then reduced with a metal hydride reducing agent, such as lithium aluminum hydride, to afford alcohol 25.

The substituted 4-amino-l-(pyridyhnethyl)piperidine and related compounds of this invention are useful as muscarinic receptor antagonists and therefore, such compounds are useful for treating medical conditions mediated by muscarinic receptors, i.e., medical conditions which are ameliorated by treatment with a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Such medical conditions include, by way of example, genitourinary tract disorders, such as overactive bladder or detrusor hyperactivity and their symptoms; gastrointestinal tract disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular disease, achalasia, gastrointestinal hypermotility disorders and diarrhea; respiratory tract disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and pulmonary fibrosis; cardiac arrhythmias, such as sinus bradycardia; Parkinson's disease; cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease; dismenorrhea; and the like.<br>
In particular, the compounds of this invention are useful for treating smooth muscle disorders in mammals, including humans. Such smooth muscle disorders include, by way of illustration, overactive bladder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and irritable bowel syndrome.<br>
When used to treat smooth muscle disorders or other conditions mediated by muscarinic receptors, the compounds of this invention will typically be administered orally, rectally, parenterally or by inhalation in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. The amount of active agent administered per dose or the total amount administered per day will typically be determined by the patient's physician and will depend on such<br>
factors as the nature and severity of the patients condition, the condition being treated, the age and general health of the patient, the tolerance of the patient to the active agent, the route of administration and the like.<br>
Typically, suitable doses for treating smooth muscle disorders or other disorders mediated by muscarinic receptors will range from about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg/day of active agent; preferably from about 0.02 to about 10 mg/kg/day. For an average 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.7 to about 3500 mg per day of active agent.<br>

Since compounds of this Invention are muscarinic receptor antagonists, such compounds are also useful as research tools for investigating or studying biological systems or samples having muscarinic receptors, or for discovering new muscarinic receptor antagonists. Such biological systems or samples may comprise Ml5 M2, M3, M4 and/or M5 muscarinic receptors. Moreever, since compounds of this invention are selective M2 muscarinic receptor subtype antagonists, such compounds are particularly useful for studying the effects of selective antagonism of M2 receptors in a biological system or sample. Any suitable biological system or sample having muscarinic receptors may be employed in such studies which may be conducted either in vitro or in vivo. Representative biological systems or samples suitable for such studies include, but are not limited to, cells, cellular extracts, plasma membranes, tissue samples, mammals (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, etc.), and the like.<br>
In this embodiment, a biological system or sample comprising a muscarinic receptor is contacted with a muscarinic receptor-antagonizing amount of a compound of this invention. The effects of antagonizing the muscarinic receptor are then determined using conventional procedures and equipment, such as radioligand binding assays and<br>
i<br>
functional assays. Such functional assays include ligand-mediated changes in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), ligand-mediated changes in activity of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (which synthesizes cAMP), ligand-mediated<br>
changes in incorporation of guanosine 5'-O-(y-thio)triphosphate ([35S]GTPyS) into isolated membranes via receptor catalyzed exchange of [35S]GTPyS for GDP, ligand-mediated changes in free intracellular calcium ions (measured, for example, with a fluorescence-linked imaging plate reader or FLIPR® from Molecular Devices, Inc.). A compound of this invention will antagonize or decrease the activation of muscarinic receptors in any of the functional assays listed above, or assays of a similar nature. A muscarinic receptor-antagonizing amount of a compound of this invention will typically range from about about 0.1 nanomolar to about 100 nanomolar.<br>
Additionally, the compounds of this invention can be used as research tools for discovering new muscarinic receptor antagonists. In this embodiment, muscarinic receptor binding data (for example, as determined by an in vitro radioligand displacement assay) for a test compound or a group of test compounds is compared to the muscarinic binding data for a compound of this invention to identify test compounds that have about equal or superior muscarinic receptor binding, if any. This aspect of the invention includes, as separate embodiments, both the generation of comparison data (using the appropriate assay) and the analysis of the test data to identify test compounds of interest.<br>
Among other properties, compounds of this invention have been found to be potent inhibitors of M2 muscarinic receptor activity. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, this invention is directed to compounds of formula I having an inhibition dissociation constant for the M2 receptor subtype of less than or equal to 100 nM; preferably, less than or equal to 50 nM; and more preferably, less than or equal to 10 nM (as determined by in vitro radioligand displacement assays).<br>
Additionally, compounds of this invention have also been found to possess surprising and unexpected selectivity for the M2 muscarinic receptor relative to the M3 muscarinic receptor. Accordingly, in another preferred embodiment, this invention is directed to compounds of formula I having an hM3/hM2 ratio of at least 5; preferably at least 10; and more preferably at least 20 (as determined by in vitro radioligand displacement assays). In one embodiment, the hM3/hM2 ratio is in the range of from<br>
about 5 to about 200; preferably, from about 10 to about 100.<br>
t These properties, as well as the utility of the compounds of this invention, can be<br>
demonstrated using various in vitro and in vivo assays well-known to those skilled in the art. For example, representative assays are described in further detail in the following<br>

Example A Preparation of (5)-3-(l-Carbamoyl-l,l-diphenylmethyl)pyrrolidine<br>
Step A - Preparation of (ffV-1 -Benzyl-3-(p-toluenesulfonvloxy)pyrrolidine To a stirred solution of (S)-l-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinol (44.3 g, 0.25 mol) and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (33.7 g, 0.3 mol) in 250 mL of tert-butyl methyl ether under an atmosphere of nitrogen at 0°C, was added p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (52.4 g, 0.275 mol) portion-wise over 20 min. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 h. The ice bath was removed and the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature overnight (20±5 h). Ethyl acetate (100 mL) was added, followed by saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (250 mL). The resulting mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h. The layers were separated and the organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (250 mL); saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (250 mL); saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (250 mL); and then dried over sodium sulfate (80 g). The sodium sulfate was filtered off and washed with ethyl acetate (20 mL) and the solvent was removed in vacua to give 78.2 g of the title intermediate as an off-white solid (94% yield; 95% purity by HPLC Method B).<br>
Step B - Preparation of (S)-1 -Benzyl-3 -(1 -cvano-1.1 -diphenylmethvlVpvrrolidine To a stirred solution of diphenylacetonitrile (12.18 g, 61.8 mmol) in anhydrous THF (120 mL) at 0°C, potassium tert-butoxide (10.60 g, 94.6 mmol) was added over 5 min. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 h. To the reaction mixture at 0°C was added (5)-l-ben2yl-3-(p-toluenesulfonyloxy)-pyrrolidine (20,48 g, 61.3 mmol) in one<br><br>
portion. The cold bath was removed and the reaction mixture was stirred for 5-10 min at which time the reaction mixture had become a brown homogeneous solution. The reaction mixture was then heated at 40°C overnight (20±5 h). The reaction mixture (bright yellow suspension) was allowed to cool to room temperature before adding water (150 rnL). Most of the THF was then removed in vacua and isopropyl acetate (200 mL) was added. The layers were separated and the organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (150 mL); saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (150 mL); and then dried over sodium sulfate (50 g). The sodium sulfate was filtered off and washed with isopropyl acetate (20 mL) and the solvent was removed in vacuo to give 23.88 g of the title intermediate as a light brown oil (&gt;99% yield, 75% purity by HPLC Method B, contaminated mainly with excess diphenylacetonitrile).<br>
Step C - Preparation of (S)-3-(l -Cyano-1,1-diphenvhnethvDpyrrolidine (1S)-l-Benzyl-3-(l-cyano-l,l-diphenyhTiethyl)pyrroh'dine was dissolved in isopropyl acetate (ca. 1 g/10 mL) and the solution was mixed with an equal volume of IN aqueous hydrochloric acid. The resulting layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with an equal volume of isopropyl acetate. The organic layers were combined, dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. The solvent was removed in vacuo to afford (S)-l-benzyl-3-(l-cyano-l,l-diphenyhnethyl)pyrrolidine hydrochloride as a light yellow foamy solid. (Note: This hydrochloride salt can also be prepared during the work-up of Step B).<br>
To a stirred solution of (5)-l-benzyl-3-(l-cyano-l,l-diphenylmethyl)pyrrolidhie hydrochloride (8.55 g, 21.98 mmol) in methanol (44 mL) was added palladium on carbon (1.71 g) and ammonium formate (6.93 g, 109.9 mmol). The reaction mixture was heated to 50°C with stirring for 3 h. The reaction was cooled to ambient temperature and water (20 mL) was added. The resulting mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite, washing with methanol (20 mL). The filtrate was collected and most of the methanol was removed in vacuo. The residue was mixed with isopropyl acetate (100 mL) and 10% aqueous sodium carbonate (50 mL). The resulting layers were separated and the aqueous layer<br>
was extracted with isopropyl acetate (50 mL). The organic layers were combined and<br>
i dried over sodium sulfate (20 g). The sodium sulfate was filtered off and washed with<br>
isopropyl acetate (20 mL). The solvent was removed in vacuo to afford 5.75 g of the title intermediate as a light yellow oil (99.7% yield, 71% purity by HPLC).<br><br>
Step D - Preparation of r.?)-3-ri-Carbamovl-l.l-diDhenvlmethvlVpvrrolidine A 200 mL flask with a magnetic stir bar and a nitrogen inlet was charged with (S)-3-(l-cyano-l,l-diphenyhnethyl)pyrrolidine (2.51 g) and 80% H2SO4 (19.2 mL; pre-prepared with 16 mL of 96% H2SO4 and 3.2 mL of H2O). The reaction mixture was then heated at 90°C for 24 h or until starting material was consumed as indicated by HPLC. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and then poured onto ice (ca. 50 mL by volume). A 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution was added slowly to the mixture with stirring over an ice bath until the pH was about 12. Dichloromethane (200 mL) was added and mixed with the aqueous solution at which time sodium sulfate precipitated out and was filtered off. The filtrate was collected and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL) and the organic layers were combined and dried with over sodium sulfate (5 g). The sodium sulfate was filtered off and washed with dichloromethane (10 mL). The solvent was removed in vacua to give the crude product as a light yellow foamy solid (ca. 2.2 g, 86% purity by HPLC).<br>
The crude product was dissolved in ethanol (18 mL) with stirring. To this solution was added a warm solution of L-tartaric acid (1.8 g) in ethanol (14 mL) and the resulting mixture was stirred overnight (15±5 h). The resulting precipitate was isolated by filtration to give an off-white solid (ca. 3.2 g, &gt;95% purity by HPLC). Methanol (15 mL) was added to this solid and the resulting slurry was stirred at 70°C overnight (15 h). The slurry was allowed to cool to ambient temperature and a white solid (~ 2.6 g, &gt;99% purity by HPLC) was obtained after filtration. To this solid was added ethyl acetate (30 mL) and 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide (25 mL). This mixture was mixed until two distinct layers formed and then the layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL). The organic layers were combined and dried over sodium sulfate (10 g). The sodium sulfate was removed by filtration and the solvent was evaporated in vacua to afford 1.55 g of the title intermediate as an off-white foamy solid (58% yield; &gt;99% purity by HPLC Method C).<br><br>

Radioligand Binding Assay A.       Membrane Preparation from Cells Expressing hM,, hM2. hM3 and hM^<br>
Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes<br>
CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell lines stably expressing cloned human hM,, hM2, hM3 and hM4 muscarinic receptor subtypes, respectively, were grown to near confluency in medium consisting of HAM's F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum) and 250 u.g/mL Geneticin. The cells were grown in a 5% CO2, 37°C incubator and lifted with dPBS -f 2 mM EDTA. Cells were collected by 5 minute centrifugation at 650 x g, and cell pellets were either stored frozen at -80°C or membranes<br><br>
were prepared immediately. For membrane preparation, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer and homogenized with a Polytron PT-2100 tissue disrupter (Kinematica AG; 20 seconds x 2 bursts). Crude membranes were centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The membrane pellet was then resuspended with resuspension buffer and homogenized again with the Polytron tissue disrupter. Protein concentration of the membrane suspension was determined by the method of Lowry, O. et al., (1951) Journal of Biochemistry: 193,265. Membranes were stored frozen in aliquots at -80°C.<br>
Aliquots of prepared hM5 receptor membranes were purchased directly from Perkin Elmer and stored at -80°C until use.<br>
B.       Radioligand Binding Assay on Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes hM,. hM,. hM,.hM,andhM5<br>
Radioligand binding assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates in a total assay volume of 100 p,L. Membranes containing each of the respective muscarinic subtypes were diluted in assay buffer to the following specific target protein concentrations (ng/well): 10 jigforhMj, 10-15 jJ.gforhM2, 10-20 u.gforhM3, 18-20 p,g for hM4, and 10-12 |J.g for hM5. The membranes were briefly homogenized using a Polytron tissue disrupter (10 seconds) prior to assay plate addition. Saturation binding studies for determining KD values of the radioligand were performed using /-[Af-methyl-3H]scopolamine methyl chloride ([3H]NMS) (TRK666, 84.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, England) at concentrations ranging from 0.001 nM to 20 nM. Displacement assays for determination of K, values of test compounds were performed with [3H]NMS at 1 nM and eleven different test compound concentrations. The test compounds were initially dissolved to a concentration of 400 fiM in dilution buffer and then serially diluted 5x with dilution buffer to final concentrations ranging from 10 pM to 100 \iM. The addition order and volumes to the assay plates were as follows: 25 |iL radioligand, 25 [J.L diluted test compound, and 50 |iL membranes. Assay plates were incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over GF/B glass fiber filter plates (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, MA) pie-treated in 1% BSA. Filter plates were rinsed three times with wash buffer (10 mM HEPES) to remove unbound radioactivity. Plates were air dried, and 50 [J.L Microscint-20 liquid scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, MA) was added to each well. The plates<br><br>
were then counted in a PerkinElmer Topcount liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, MA). Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the one-site competition model. K; values for test compounds were calculated from observed IC50 values and the KD value of the radioligand using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y; Prusoff WH. (1973) Biochemical Pharmacology, 22(23) :3099-108). Kj values were converted to pK; values to determine the geometric mean and 95% confidence intervals. These summary statistics were then converted back to K; values for data reporting.<br>
Test compounds having a lower K, value in this assay have a higher binding affinity for the muscarinic receptor. The compounds of this invention which were tested •, in this assay had a K, value for hM2 ranging from about 200 nM to less than 1 nM; typically ranging from about 100 nM to less than 1 nM. Additionally, compounds of this, invention which were tested in this assay had an hM3/hM2 ratio ranging from about 5 to greater than 50; typically ranging from about 20 to greater than 50. By way of example, • the compound of Example 1 had a Kj value for hM2 of less than 1 nM and an hM3/hM2 ratio greater than 40.<br>
Thus, compounds of this invention were found to bind potently to the hM2 receptor subtype in this assay and to have a higher binding affinity for the hM2 receptor subtype relative to the hM3 receptor subtype.<br>
Example 119 Muscarinic Receptor Functional Potency Assays<br>
A.       Blockade of Agonist-Mediated Inhibition of cAMP Accumulation<br>
In this assay, the functional potency of a test compound was determined by measuring the ability of the test compound to block oxotremorine-inhibition of forskolin-mediated cAMP accumulation in CHO-K1 cells expressing the hM2 receptor.<br>
cAMP assays were performed in a radioimmunoassay format using the Flashplate Adenylyl Cyclase Activation Assay System with 125I-cAMP (NEN SMP004B, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
CHO-K1 cells stably expressing cloned human M2 muscarinic receptors were<br><br>
grown to near confluency in a 5% CO2,37°C incubator in medium consisting of HAM's F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum) and 250 |J,g/mL Geneticin. On the day of the assay, cells were rinsed once with dPBS and lifted with Trypsin. The detached cells were washed twice by centrifugation at 650 x g for five minutes in 50mLs dPBS. The cell pellet was then re-suspended in 10 mL dPBS, and the cells were counted with a Coulter Zl Dual Particle Counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The cells were centrifuged again at 650 x g for five minutes and re-suspended in stimulation buffer to an assay concentration of 1.6 x 106-2.8 x 106 cells/mL.<br>
The test compound was initially dissolved to a concentration of 400 |iM in dilution buffer (dPBS supplemented with 1 mg/mL BSA (0.1%)), and then serially diluted with dilution buffer to final molar concentrations ranging from 1E-4 M to 1E-10 M. Oxotremorine was diluted in a similar manner.<br>
To measure oxotremorine inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, 25 U.L forskolin (25 [iM final concentration diluted in dPBS), 25 \iL diluted oxotremorine, and 50 |J,L cells were added to agonist assay wells. To measure the ability of a test compound to block oxotremorine-inhibited AC activity, 25 |iL forskolin and oxotremorine (25 |J,M and 5 [iM final concentrations, respectively, diluted in dPBS) 25 |iL diluted test compound, and 50 u-L cells were added to remaining assay wells.<br>
Reactions were incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C and stopped by addition of 100 |iL ice-cold detection buffer. Plates were sealed, incubated overnight at room temperature and counted the next morning on a PerkinElmer TopCount liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, MA). The amount of cAMP produced (pmol/well) was calculated based on the counts observed for the samples and cAMP standards, as described in the manufacturer's user manual. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the non-linear regression, one-site competition equation. The Cheng-Prusoff equation was used to calculate the Ki? using the EC50of the oxotremorine concentration-response curve and the oxotremorine assay concentration as the KD and PL], respectively. The K; values were converted to pK; values to determine the geometric mean and 95% confidence intervals. These summary statistics were then converted back to K, values for data reporting.<br>
Typically, compounds of this invention that were tested in this assay had a K; of<br><br>
less than about 100 nM for blockade of oxotremorine-inhibition of forskolin-mediated cAMP accumulation in CHO-K1 cells expressing the hM2 receptor. For example, the compound of Example 1 had a Kj of less than about 1 nM.<br>
B.       Blockade of Agonist-Mediated GTPy[35S1 Binding<br>
In this assay, the functional potency of a test compound was determined by measuring the ability of the test compound to block carbachol-stimulated GTPy[35S] binding in CHO-K1 cells expressing the hM2 receptor.<br>
CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the hM2 muscarinic receptor were grown in medium consisting of Hams F-12 media supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and 500 jig/ml of Geneticin (G-418). Cells were incubated in a 5% CO2, humidified incubator at 37°C. Cells were grown to confluence and harvested with dPBS + 2mM EDTA and pelleted by centrifugation at 250 x g for 10 minutes.<br>
Cells from the centrifuged pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer (10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7 at 4°C). Cells were then homogenized using a Polytron PT-2100 tissue disrupter (Kinematica AG) for six, 3 second bursts. Crude membranes were pelleted at 40,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C. Membranes were finally resuspended in assay buffer (10 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4 at    . 37°C) and frozen at -80°C.<br>
At the time of use, membranes were thawed and then diluted in assay buffer with a final target tissue concentration of 7 \ig protein per well. The membranes were briefly homogenized using a Polytron PT-2100 tissue disrupter and then added to the assay plates.<br>
The EC90 value (effective concentration for 90% maximal response) for stimulation of GTPv[35S] binding by the agonist carbachol was determined in each experiment as follows: 25 |iL of a 5x carbachol working stock solution, 25 nL assay buffer containing GTPy[35S] and GDP, 25 (iL membrane, and 25 p,L assay buffer were transferred to the 96-well microtiter plates. The final concentration of GTPy[35S] was 0.07 nM and the final concentration of GDP was 3 |J,M. The assay plate was then incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes prior to filtration.<br>
To determine the ability of a test compound to inhibit carbachol-stimulated GTPy[35S] binding, the following was added to each well of 96 well plates: 25 [J.L of<br><br>
assay buffer with GTPy[35S] and GDP, 25 |iL of diluted test compound (prepared as described above), and 25 \iL CHO cell membranes expressing the hM2 receptor. The plates were pre-incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes. After the pre-incubation period, 25 \iL of carbachol at the final concentration of its EC90 value determined earlier in the day was added to each plate. The assay plates were then incubated at 37°C for an additional 60 minutes.<br>
Following the 60 minute carbachol incubation period, the assay plates were filtered over 0.5% bovine serum albumin-pretreated glass fiber GF/B filtermats using a PerkinElmer 96-well harvester. The plates were rinsed with ice-cold wash buffer for 3 x 3 seconds and then air or vacuum dried. Microscint-20 scintillation liquid (40 |iL) was added to each well, and each plate was sealed and radioactivity determined on a TopCount (PerkinElmer) scintillation counter.<br>
Test compound potency (IC50) was determined using iterative curve fitting (GraphPad Prism 3.0 software; single site competition curve). The inhibition dissociation constant (Kj) of the test compound was determined with the Prism program considering the concentration of the agonist carbachol and the effective concentration for 50% response (EC50) determined in the same experiment.<br>
Typically, compounds of this invention that were tested in this assay had a K, of less than about 100 nM for blockade of carbachol-mediated GTP-y[35S] binding. For example, the compound of Example 1 had a K; of less than about 1 nM.<br>
Test compounds having a lower K,. value in these assays are more effective antagonists for the hM2 muscarinic receptor subtype. Thus, these assays demonstrate that compounds of this invention are potent functional antagonists of the human M2 receptor subtype.<br>
Example 120 In Vivo Rat Bladder Assay<br>
Female Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 200 to 300 g were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg, s.c., Sigma, St. Louis, MO), with a supplement of 0.25 g/kg, s.c. urethane as needed. Urethane was administered at a concentration of 0.25 g/mL.<br>
Rats were prepared for surgery by shaving the neck and abdomen and cleansing<br><br>
with ethanol wipes. First, an incision was made on the ventral surface. An intravenous catheter was placed by isolating and ligating the femoral vein. A small incision was made in the vein proximal to the ligation through which a catheter (micro-Renathane tubing, 0.30 mm ID x 0.64 mm OD, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) filled with D5W was inserted and secured in place with 4.0 silk suture thread (Ethicon, Johnson and Johnson, Somerville, NJ). Similarly, a catheter was inserted into the femoral artery for the measurement of cardiovascular parameters. A tracheotomy was performed by isolating the trachea and placing a small hole between two trachea! rings. PE 205 tubing (1.57 mm ID x 2.08 mm OD, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) was inserted into the trachea toward the lungs. The neck incision was closed with 9 mm wound clips leaving the catheters and distal end of the trachea tube exposed.<br>
Subsequently, a 3 cm midline sagital incision in the skin and muscle layers of the lower abdomen was made. The bladder and ureters were isolated and exposed by means of tissue forceps. The ureters were ligated and severed distal to the bladder. The bladder was cannulated with PESO tubing (0.58 mm ID x 0.965 mm OD, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) via the urethra. The cannula was attached to a micro infusion pump to allow infusion of saline into the bladder through a pressure transducer (Argon, Athen, TX). The cannula was secured in place using a purse string suture (4.0 silk suture). To ensure a tight seal, the cannula was tied in place around the external urethral orifice with 2.0 silk suture thread. After the bladder was placed back into the peritoneal cavity, the bladder was manually voided allowing the contents to flow out until the bladder was empty. The incision was closed with 9 mm wound clips.<br>
After the surgical preparation, the bladder was filled with saline at a constant rate of 200 |J,L/min for 5 minutes or until bladder pressure averaged over 30 mm Hg. Subsequently, the bladder was filled with a maintenance infusion of 5 [iL/min. When rhythmic volume-induced bladder contractions (VIBC's) were observed, the maintenance infusion was adjusted 2 to 5 pL/min. Only rats demonstrating rhythmic bladder contractions of similar peak height were used in the experiment. Animals not demonstrating this profile within 60 minutes were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation.<br>
Once stable rhythmic VIBC's were observed for at least 30 minutes during the maintenance infusion, vehicle (D5W) was infused intravenously (1 mL/kg) and changes in VIBC amplitude (VIBCAmp) were recorded for 15 minutes. Thereafter, an intravenous<br><br>
dose of the test compound was administered and changes in VIBC^ were recorded for 15 minutes. Atropine (0.1 mg/kg) was then administered intravenously (1 mL/kg) as a positive control and VIBCAmp and data was recorded for an additional 15 minutes. At least four doses of each test compound at half log increments were tested in this model.<br>
Alternatively, after the vehicle, increasing cumulative intravenous doses of the test compound were administered at 15 minute intervals (1 mL/kg) and changes in VIBC^ were recorded for 15 minutes. At least 4 doses of test compound were administered at half log increments.<br>
The average VIBC^ during the 5-15 minute period after test compound and atropine was determined and subtracted from the average VIBCAmp during the 5-15 minute post-vehicle period to obtain the test compound or atropine-induced change in VffiC^p. The inhibitory effects of the test compound were normalized to the atropine response and the resulting dose-response curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation to obtain estimates of ID50 (dose required to produce 50% of the maximal response).<br>
Test compounds having a lower ID50 value in this assay are more effective for reducing peak bladder contraction pressure. In this assay, the compound of Example Ihad an ID50 value of less than or equal to about 0.1 mg/kg.<br>
Example 121 In Vivo Rat Salivation Assay<br>
Female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 to 300 g were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg, s.c., Sigma, St. Louis, MO), with a supplement of 0.25 g/kg, s.c. urethane as needed. Urethane was administered at a concentration of 0.25 g/mL.<br>
Rats were placed on a heated blanket on their dorsal side in an inclined position (20° angle) position (head down). A swab was placed in the rat's mouth. The test compound or vehicle was administered intravenously via the tail vein. After 5 min., oxotremorine (1.0 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously. The swab was discarded and replaced by a pre-weighed swab. Saliva was then collected for 10 min. and then the swab was removed and re-weighed to determine the output of saliva. Dose-response curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation to obtain estimates of ID50 (dose required to produce 50% of the maximal response).<br>
Test compounds having a higher ID50 in this assay had less of an effect on<br><br>
salivation. In this assay, the compound of Example 1 had an DD50 value of greater than or equal to about 0.9 rag/kg.<br>
By comparing the ID50 values determined in the rat bladder assay and rat salivation assay, the in vivo bladder/salivation selectivity ratio was calculated for the compounds tested. Surprisingly, compounds of this invention were found to be bladder selective. For example, in this assay, the compound of Example 1 had an DD50 bladder/salivation selectivity ratio greater than 20. In contrast, the known muscarinic receptor antagonists oxybutynin and tolterodine had an ID50 bladder/salivation selectivity ratio of about 1.4 and 4.8, respectively, in this assay.<br>
