"STEERING DAMPER SYSTEM"<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
GARNTED<br>
13/12/2007<br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001] [Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a steering damper system for a motorcycle for damping a swing of the handle during running, and particularly to one that can vary the damping force. [0002] , [Prior Art]<br>
Steering damper systems for generating a damping force against a swing of the handle, in order to prevent the swing of the handle due to a kick-back at the time of<br><br>
a disturbance or the like, have been known (one example is Japanese Patent No. 2593461) .  In addition, technologies in which a damping force is variable so that the damping force is generated only when it is needed and that needless damping forces are not generated in other situations are also known.  For example, there have been known a technology in which the damping force is controlled based on steering angle and running velocity (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Sho 63-64888), a technology in which the damping force is controlled based on variations in front-wheel load (Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 7-74023) and so on.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problems to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Meanwhile, according to the damping force control methods of the prior-art examples, it is impossible to discriminate whether the cause generating a swing of the handle is an external cause such as a disturbance or an intentional operation by the rider. Therefore, even when the rider intentionally operates the handle as at the time of cornering, a damping force might be generated if a predetermined condition is established, whereby handle load would be enlarged. Accordingly, the most preferable thing as a steering damper system is to generate the<br><br><br>
damping force only upon an unintentional cause such as a disturbance and not to generate the damping force in other situations.<br>
[0004]<br>
However, even including the above prior-art examples, there has not been a steering damper system which enables such a control according to the contents of the handle operation, and it is desired to perform such a control that an appropriate damping force can be obtained according to the contents of the handle operation. Further, it is considered that if the damping force is varied according to variations in vehicle velocity or vehicle acceleration, it is possible to generate a damping force suitable for the active will of the rider. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to realize a steering damper system which can generate a damping force suitable for the active will of the rider.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, a first aspect of the invention pertaining to the steering damper system of the present application is characterized in that, in a steering damper system for exerting a damping force on a turning action of a front wheel<br><br>
steering system supported at a front portion of a vehicle body, the damping force being variable, a rotational angular velocity of the steering system generated by an unintentionally caused turning action and a moment intentionally exerted on the steering system in the opposite direction so as to restrain the unintentional turning action are measured, and the damping force of the steering damper is eliminated or reduced when the load direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are in the same direction. [0006]<br>
At this time, while the damping force of the steering damper is eliminated or reduced when the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are in the same direction, a damping force may be generated or increased in the steering damper when the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are in opposite directions.  Further, a damping force may be generated in the steering damper when the rotational angular velocity has exceeded a predetermined threshold value.<br>
In addition, a damping force may be generated in the steering damper when the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are in<br><br>
opposite directions and the load of the moment has exceeded a predetermined threshold value.  Furthermore, in the controls where the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are in the same direction or in opposite directions, a condition that the rotational angle exceeds a predetermined threshold value may be added to the control conditions.<br>
[0007]<br>
A second aspect of the invention is characterized in that, in a steering damper system for exerting a damping force on a turning action of a front wheel steering system supported at a front portion of a vehicle body, the damping force being variable by damping force variable means, the damping force variable means varies the magnitude of the damping force through multistage changeover according to vehicle velocity, vehicle acceleration or both of them.<br>
[0008]<br>
At this time, a constitution may be adopted in which control means for operating the damping force variable means is provided, the control means changes over the damping force variable means in a multistage manner according to a plurality of predetermined velocity threshold values concerning the vehicle velocity or a<br><br>
plurality of predetermined acceleration threshold values concerning the vehicle acceleration, and the acceleration threshold values include a function of the vehicle velocity which decreases as the vehicle velocity increases.  Furthermore, a constitution may be adopted in which the damping force variable means is fixed in a predetermined changeover position within the multistage changeover range when a changeover of the damping force cannot be achieved notwithstanding a condition for changing over the damping force is present.<br>
[0009]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
The steering damper system according to the first aspect of the invention performs a control based on the moment exerted on the handle and the rotational angular velocity.  Therefore, when the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the handle are in the same direction, for example, when the rider performs an intentional turning operation on the handle at the time of cornering, the direction of the moment exerted on the handle and the turning direction of the steering system coincide with each other, so that it is detected that the current operation is an intentional handle operation by the rider; as a result, the damping force is eliminated<br><br><br>
or reduced, irrespective of the magnitude of the moment and the rotational angular velocity. Therefore, the damping force is not generated or is reduced upon the rider"s intentional handle operations at the time of stopping, managing or running the motorcycle or the like situations, whereby light handle operations are realized. Moreover, it is possible to restrain the generation of needless damping forces, according to the handle operation conditions. [0010]<br>
In addition, the damping force can be generated or increased only when the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are in opposite directions.  For example, when a turning action is generated in the steering system due to a disturbance from the road surface at the time of running, the turning direction of the steering system and the direction of the moment exerted on the steering system by the rider so as to restrain the turning action are different; therefore, it is detected that the current action of the steering system is an unintentional action, and a damping force is generated or increased in the steering damper. As a result, the turning action of the steering system due to the disturbance from the road surface or the like can be<br><br><br>
restrained. Therefore, there is realized a steering damper system which can restrain the turning of the steering system by the damping force only when it is needed, according to the actual conditions at the time of running, and which can generate an appropriate damping force without being against the active will of the rider.<br>
[0011]<br>
Further, when a predetermined threshold value is set concerning rotational angular velocity and a damping force is generated or increased in the steering damper only when the threshold value has been exceeded, the steering damper can be made to function selectively only to such an excessive disturbance of disturbances from the road surface that might lead to kick-back, and, as a result, generation of needless damping forces can be restrained more securely.<br>
[0012]<br>
Besides, when a condition that the load of the moment exceeds a threshold value is added to the conditions for the control in the case where the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are opposite, a further appropriate control is realized. The same result can be obtained also when a condition that the rotational angle exceeds a<br><br>
predetermined threshold value is added to the conditions for the controls in the cases where the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are the same or opposite. [0013]<br>
The second aspect of the invention resides in that the damping force variable means varies the magnitude of the damping force in a multistage manner according to vehicle velocity, vehicle acceleration or both of them. Therefore, a damping force of a required magnitude can be appropriately given to the steering damper in response to a required running condition, in relation to the vehicle velocity and the vehicle acceleration, and, therefore, there is realized a steering damper system which can generate an appropriate damping force without being against the active will of the rider. [0014]<br>
Generally, when the vehicle velocity is low, the vehicle acceleration is high and, therefore, kick-back would easily occur.  In view of this, when a control device for changing over the damping force variable means is so set as to perform a control in a multistage manner according to pluralities of predetermined velocity threshold values or acceleration threshold values, it is<br><br><br>
possible to obtain an appropriate damping force according to the vehicle velocity or the vehicle acceleration.<br>
[0015]<br>
In this case, when an acceleration threshold value is made to be a function of vehicle velocity which decreases as the vehicle velocity increases and the damping force is controlled based on the acceleration threshold value, the acceleration threshold value is higher on the lower-velocity side.  Therefore, a large damping force can be generated only when the vehicle acceleration is great as compared to the vehicle velocity in a comparatively lower velocity region.  Therefore, an appropriate damping force based on the correlation between vehicle velocity and vehicle acceleration can be generated to prevent kick-back, according to the actual situations of a motorcycle such that a large vehicle acceleration is generated at the time of low vehicle velocity, to reduce the front-wheel load, leading to that the kick-back would easily occur.<br>
[0016]<br>
Furthermore, when the damping force variable means cannot change over the damping force notwithstanding a condition for changing over the damping force is present, the changeover position is fixed in a predetermined<br><br><br>
region within a changeover range varied in a multistage manner, so that a predetermined damping force can be generated even in such a situation.<br>

[Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
Now, a first embodiment will be described based on the drawings.  Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a motorcycle to which the present embodiment is applied; Fig. 2 is a side view of the structure of a front portion of a vehicle body at which a steering damper is provided; Fig. 3 is a plan view of the same; Fig. 4 shows a general structure of the steering damper; and Fig. 5 shows an action or operation.<br>
[0018]<br>
In Fig. 1, an upper portion of a front fork 2 supporting a front wheel 1 at its lower end is connected to a front portion of a vehicle body frame 3, and is freely turnable by a handle 4.  A fuel tank 5 is supported on the vehicle body frame 3.  Symbol 6 denotes a seat, 7 denotes a rear cowl, 8 denotes a rear swing arm, and 9 denotes a rear wheel.<br>
[0019]<br>
Next, the steering damper will be described.  As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the steering damper 10 is<br><br>
provided between a top bridge 11 fitted with the handle 4 and a front end portion of the vehicle body frame 3.  The top bridge 11 is a member integrated with a bottom bridge 12 on the lower side so as to clamp therebetween a steering shaft 14 (represented by a center line) supported on a head pipe 13.  The top bridge 11, the bottom bridge 12 and the steering shaft 14 are turned as one body.<br>
[0020]<br>
Upper portions of a left-right pair of front-fork portions of the front fork 2 are supported on the top bridge 11 and the bottom bridge 12.  The head pipe 13 is a pipe-shaped portion integrated with a front end portion of the vehicle body frame 3, and the vehicle body frame 3 extends rearwards from the head pipe 13 in the form of a left-right pair (Fig. 3).  A handle lock 15 supported by the top bridge 11 is provided on the front side of the head pipe 13, and is unlocked by a key 16.<br>
[0021]<br>
The handle lock 15 is for non-turnably fixing the handle 4 to the vehicle body side at the time of parking, and is integrated with a main switch being a switch for electrical system for turning ON/OFF a power source for an engine ignition system, a lamp system and the like.<br><br>
The key 16 has both the function for unlocking the handle lock 15 and the function for changing over the main switch. [0022]<br>
The steering damper 10 in the present embodiment is a liquid pressure type damper for preventing kick-back, comprises a main body portion 17 and a cover 18, and is fastened to a nut portion provided at a boss 21 on the top bridge 11 by bolts 20. At this time, the main body portion 17 and the cover 18 are also integrated by the bolts 20.  Symbol 22 denotes a nut for connecting the top bridge 11 and the upper end of the steering shaft 14. [0023]<br>
A shaft 23 is provided in the inside of the steering damper 10 with its axis directed in the vertical direction in Fig. 2, and the lower end of the shaft 23 extends downwards from the main body portion 17, to be integrated with the front end of an arm 24.  The shaft 23 is disposed coaxially with the steering shaft 14. [0024]<br>
The arm 24 is bent in a crank form in side view, extends in the front-rear direction through the center of the vehicle body in plan view, and its front end portion projects to the upper side of the nut 22 to be integrated<br><br>
with the shaft 23 projecting into the steering damper 10. A rear end portion of the arm 24 is a bifurcated portion 25, in which a boss portion 26 on the side of the vehicle body frame 3 is fitted.<br>
[0025]<br>
The boss portion 26 projects upwards over a central portion of a bracket 27, and the bracket 27 has both its left and right ends fitted to bosses 29 (Fig. 2) provided on the rear side of the head pipe 13 at the center of a front end portion of the vehicle body frame 3, by bolts 28.  A stay 30 projecting from the front end of the fuel tank 5 is co-fastened onto the bosses 29 by the bolts 28. The boss portion 26 and the shaft 23 are located on the center line C of the vehicle body.  A moment sensor 31 is fitted to a side portion of the arm 24, for detecting the turning moment of the handle.<br>
[0026]<br>
Fig. 4 generally shows the structure of the steering damper 10. The steering damper 10 is provided in the inside thereof with a liquid pressure chamber 32 in a sector shape widened toward the rear side, the shaft 23 is located at a position corresponding to the center of the sector, and the inside of the liquid pressure chamber 32 is bisected into a right liquid chamber 34 and a left<br><br>
liquid chamber 35 by a partition wall 33 integrally extending rearwards from the shaft 23 in a wing form.<br>
[0027]<br>
The tip of the partition wall 33 forms a sliding surface, which keeps sliding contact with the inside surface of an arch-shaped wall 36 of the liquid pressure chamber 32.  An incompressible liquid such as an oil is sealed in the right liquid chamber 34 and the left liquid chamber 35, which are connected to each other by a bypass passage 37. A variable valve 38 is provided at an intermediate portion of the bypass passage 37.  The variable valve 38 has a restriction passage for generating a damping force, and the restriction is variable by varying the cross sectional area of the restriction passage.  The variable valve 38 is not limited to such a structure, and various known ones can be adopted. An example of the variable valve 38 composed of an electromagnetic solenoid will be shown in Fig. 6 of a second embodiment which will be described later.<br>
[0028]<br>
The restriction of the variable valve 38 is controlled by a control device 40.  The control device 40 is composed of a microcomputer or the like, performs a control based on detection signals from a moment sensor<br><br><br>
31 and a rotational angular velocity sensor 41, detects the direction of a turning torque exerted on the steering shaft 14 from the moment M, detects the magnitude of the<br>
rotational angular velocity to  and the turning direction of the steering shaft 14 from the rotational angular<br>
velocity ω,   and varies the restriction of the variable valve 38 to regulate the damping force when the detected data are in a predetermined condition.<br>
[0029]<br>
The predetermined condition is such that a damping force is generated when the direction of the moment M and the turning direction of the steering shaft 14 are opposite to each other and the absolute value of the rotational angular velocity ω  has exceeded a predetermined threshold value, and the damping force is eliminated in other situations.  The setting of the threshold value can be conducted arbitrarily according to the specifications of the vehicle and the like, and is so made that a control is performed only upon the generation of a particularly great disturbance which would lead to kick-back.<br>
[0030]<br>
The moment sensor 31 is composed of a known strain gage or the like. When a damping force is generated in<br><br>
the steering damper 10 at the time of turning the handle 4, the damping force is transmitted through the partition wall 33 and the shaft 23 to the arm portion 24, and tends to contract or extend the moment sensor 31; therefore, the absolute value of the moment M can be detected from the magnitude of the deformation of the moment sensor 31, and the direction of the moment M can be detected from whether the deformation is compression or extension.  In the present embodiment, the deformation in the compression direction of the moment sensor 31 corresponds to a leftward turning, and the deformation in the extension direction corresponds to a rightward turning. The strain gage may be located at any portion where a moment is generated, such as the handle 4. [0031]<br>
The rotational angular velocity sensor 41 is a known one using an electric resistance or the like, is contained in the steering damper 10, is disposed in the vicinity of the shaft 23, and detects the rotational angular velocity ω concerning the relative turning between the shaft 23 and the main body portion 17 side of the steering damper 10.  The rotational angular velocity sensor 41 may be disposed in the vicinity of the steering shaft 14 on the side of the head pipe 13 or the top<br><br>
bridge 11, to detect the rotational angular velocity ω concerning the turning of the steering shaft 14.  If required, the control device 40 is further supplied appropriately with detection signals from various sensors such as a torque sensor 42 for the steering shaft 14, a vehicle velocity sensor 43, a vehicle acceleration sensor 44 and the like.<br>
[0032]<br>
In the second embodiment which will be described later, detection signals are also inputted, as required, from various sensors such as, for example, an engine rotational speed sensor 45, a throttle sensor 46 and a gear position sensor 47 which constitute a sensor group of an electronic fuel injection system.<br>
[0033]<br>
Next, action or operation of the present embodiment will be described.  At the time of running straight forwards, the rider holds the handle in a neutral position, but the front wheel 1 performs an oscillating movement with minute angles due to self-alliance. Although this oscillating movement also leads to an unintentionally caused turning action exerted on the steering system, such a minute vibration does not cause the rotational angular velocity CO  detected by the<br><br>
rotational angular velocity sensor 41 to reach the threshold value, so that the control device 40 does not cause generation of a damping force, irrespective of the relationship with the moment M.<br>
[0034]<br>
In this condition, if the angle of the front wheel 1 is largely swung to the left or the right due to a large disturbance which might lead to kick-back, the steering shaft 14 shows an unintentionally caused turning to that direction, and, therefore, the steering damper 10 is also turned in the same direction as one body with the top bridge 11, with the shaft 23 as a center.<br>
[0035]<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, if the top bridge 11 is turned to the left as indicated by arrow a, the steering damper 10 also is turned in the direction of arrow a.  In this case, since the shaft 23 is fitted to the arm 24 and is fixed on the center of the vehicle body, the shaft 23 together with the partition wall 33 rests unmoved. Therefore, the arch shaped wall 36 is turned to the right side as indicated by imaginary lines while making sliding contact with the tip of the partition wall 33, and the volume of the left liquid chamber 35 is reduced, so that surplus liquid tends to move through the bypass passage<br><br>
37 into the right liquid chamber 34.<br>
[0036]<br>
At this time, the rotational angular velocity sensor 41 detects a rotational angular velocity ω concerning a leftward turning due to the relative turning of the steering damper 10, which is turned to the left as one body with the top bridge 11, and the shaft 23. Moreover, the rotational angular velocity ω  exceeds the threshold value.  On the other hand, the rider tends to maintain the handle in the straight forward condition in response to the disturbance, and, therefore, intentionally exerts a rightward turning torque (opposite to the disturbance) on the steering shaft 14.  As a result, the gage constituting the moment sensor 31 experiences a deformation in the extension direction, and thereby detects the rightward turning moment M.<br>
[0037]<br>
Therefore, the direction of the moment M intentionally exerted on the steering system and the turning direction of the steering shaft 14 generated by the disturbance which is an unintentional cause are opposite to each other, and the rotational angular velocity ω exceeds the predetermined threshold value; thus, the predetermined condition for generating a<br><br>
damping force is satisfied. Accordingly, the control device 40 varies the variable valve 38 to the restriction side, whereby the flow resistance on the liquid in the bypass passage 37 is enlarged, and the damping force is increased. By this, the turning action of the steering shaft 14 and the steering system due to the disturbance exerted from the road surface or the like is restrained, and kick-back is prevented. [0038]<br>
When the rider turns the handle, for example, to the left for cornering, the rider first turns the handle to the left and the direction of the moment M at this time is the leftward turning direction.  In addition, the steering shaft 14 is turned to the left side, so that the<br>
rotational angular velocity ω  is also in the leftward turning direction.  Thus, the direction of the moment M and the turning direction of the rotational angular velocity ω  are the same, so that the predetermined condition is not satisfied, irrespective of the magnitude<br>
of the rotational angular velocity ω.    Accordingly, the control device 40 detects the active operation by the rider, and controls the variable valve 38 so as not to generate a damping force, thereby permitting the steering shaft 14 to be rotated lightly.<br><br>
[0039]<br>
In the cornering of a motorcycle, for example, in the case of leftward rotation, it is a common practice to first turn the handle momentarily to the opposite (rightward) direction to make it an occasion to start cornering.  In this case, also, the direction of the moment M and the turning direction of the rotational angular velocity ω  coincide with each other, so that this is judged as an intentional handle operation of the rider, and a damping force is not generated.  Similarly, as to the intentional handle operations of the rider at the times of stopping, managing or running the motorcycle or the like situations, a damping force is not generated because the operation in question is an active operation of the rider.<br>
[0040]<br>
Therefore, there is obtained a system that can judge even the cause of a handle action, which has never been present.  For an intentional handle operation by the rider, generation of needless damping force is restrained, and a light handle operation is realized.  In response to a large disturbance which might lead to kick-back, it is judged that the current action is a handle action unintended by the rider, and the steering damper is<br><br>
caused to generate a damping force, whereby the influence of the disturbance or the like can be absorbed.  Therefore, it is possible to generate a damping force in the steering damper only when it is truly needed according to the cause of the handle action, in conformity with the handle operation situations and the actual conditions at the time of running.  Thus, a steering damper system is realized which can generate a damping force suitable for the active will of the rider.<br>
[0041]<br>
The present embodiment is not limited to the above description, and various modifications or applications are possible within the principle of the invention.  For example, while the damping force is controlled to be either eliminated (reduced to zero) or generated in the above-described embodiment, a control may be adopted in which the damping force is varied in a multistage manner or continuously so that the damping force is decreased when the moment M and the turning direction coincide with each other and that the damping force is increased when the moment M and the turning direction are opposite to each other.<br>
[0042]<br>
In addition, since the detection of the moment has<br><br>
the same signification as the detection of the turning torque of the steering shaft 14, the detection of the moment M by the moment sensor 31 may be replaced by direct detection of the turning torque of the steering<br>
shaft 14.  Similarly, the rotational angular velocity ω may also be detected directly as to the steering shaft 14 itself. [0043]<br>
Furthermore, while a predetermined threshold value<br>
is set with respect to the rotational angular velocity a), the control according to the cause of the handle operation as described above can be achieved without setting the threshold value.  In addition, when a condition that the load of the moment exceeds a threshold value is added to the conditions for the control in the case where the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are opposite to each other, a further appropriate control is realized. Similarly, when a condition that the rotational angle exceeds a predetermined threshold value is added to the conditions for the control in the cases where the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are the same or opposite, a further appropriate control is realized.<br><br>
[0044]<br>
Next, a second embodiment concerning the control method for damping force will be described. Fig. 6 is a model view showing the structure of a variable valve having three positions for three-stage changeover of damping force, Fig. 7 is a diagram showing the relationship between angular velocity of steering and rotational torque for each position, Fig. 8 is a diagram showing the position changeover timings in relation to vehicle velocity and vehicle acceleration, and Fig. 9 is a control flow chart of the control device.  The structure of the steering damper, the control system and the structure of fitting the control system to the vehicle body are the same as in the previous embodiment; therefore, description thereof will be omitted, and common symbols will be used.<br>
[0045]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the variable valve 38 is composed as an electromagnetic solenoid valve, its plunger 50 can be freely moved in the direction traversing the bypass passage 37 by electromotive forces, and has three different positions of A, N and B in its longitudinal direction.  Each of the positions is selectively connected to the bypass passage 37, to<br><br>
balanced point where the upper and lower springs 51 and 52 are in their normal condition.  Fig. 6 shows this condition.<br>
[0048]<br>
Fig. 7 is a graph showing the relationship between the rotational angular velocity of the steering shaft and the rotational torque for each position, in which the axis of abscissa represents the rotational angular velocity of the steering shaft which represents the rotational angular velocity of the handle, and the axis of ordinate represents the rotational torque of the steering which is the damping force generated by the steering damper.  For each position, the variations of the rotational angular velocity of the steering shaft and the rotational torque are in a linear proportional relationship, but the inclinations differ, namely, the inclination is in the order of B &gt; N &gt; A.  The difference in the inclination shows the difference in the magnitude of the damping force generated at each position of the plunger 50, and, since the damping force is greater as the inclination is greater, the magnitude of the damping force is in the order of B &gt; N &gt; A.<br>
[0049]<br>
Among the positions, at position A the damping<br><br><br>
restrict the flow passage to different cross-sectional areas, thereby changing the damping force in three manners.<br>
[0046]<br>
Namely, when a power source for excitation supplied to the variable valve 38 is turned OFF, the plunger 50 comes to a neutral position, and position N is communicated with the bypass passage 37.  When the power source for excitation is turned ON and the plunger 50 is moved upwards in the figure against a spring 51, position B is communicated with the bypass passage 37.  Conversely, when the plunger 50 is moved downwards in the figure against a spring 52, position A is communicated with the bypass passage 37.  Thus, the variable valve 38 is changed over in three positions.<br>
[0047]<br>
The moving direction of the plunger 50 is selected by reversing the direction of the current supplied to the variable valve 38, and the changeover among the three positions is conducted by the control device 40. When the power source for excitation of the electromagnetic solenoid constituting the variable valve 38 is turned OFF, namely, when the variable valve 38 is not operated, position N is connected to the bypass passage 37 at a<br><br>
force is smallest, and this position gives priority to steerability so that variation of the rotational torque of steering relative to variation of the rotational angular velocity of the steering shaft is smallest. On the contrary, at position B the damping force is greatest, and this position gives priority to stability so that variation of the rotational torque of steering relative to variation of the rotational angular velocity of the steering shaft is greatest.  Position N is a normal setting where a damping force intermediate between those of positions A and B is generated to balance the steerability and stability, and this position is also a home position where the variable valve 38 is not operated. [0050]<br>
Fig. 8 shows an example of setting the changeover of each position.  In the figure, the axis of abscissa is vehicle velocity V, the boundary between a low-velocity region and an intermediate-velocity region is set to be a vehicle threshold value V1, and the boundary between the intermediate-velocity region and a high velocity region is set to be a velocity threshold value V2.  The axis of ordinate is vehicle acceleration G, and predetermined acceleration threshold values Gl and G2 (Gl 
 <br>
vehicle velocity V of G1 = f1(V), which is a rightwardly downward straight line gradually decreasing as the vehicle velocity V increases, and is changed to 0 at the velocity threshold value V1. The Gl on the axis of ordinate is the value at a vehicle velocity of 0, and is a maximum, and f1 is a predetermined proportional constant.<br>
[0051]<br>
Similarly, the acceleration threshold value G2 is a function of vehicle velocity V of G2 - f2(V), which generally decreases gradually as the vehicle velocity V increases, and, from an intermediate portion in the low-velocity region, it steeply rightwardly slopes down on the intermediate-velocity region side; hence, a bent line sloping down rightward on the whole.  The acceleration threshold value G2 uniformly decreases in the intermediate-velocity region to be a righwardly downward straight line, and is changed to 0 at the velocity threshold value V2.  The G2 on the axis of ordinate is the value at a vehicle velocity of 0, and is a maximum, and f2 is a predetermined proportional constant.  The acceleration threshold value as a function is represented as G(V) .<br>
[0052]<br><br><br>
As for the changeover of the position at which the variable valve 38 is connected to the bypass passage 37, the region where the vehicle velocity V is in the low-velocity region of less than the velocity threshold value V1 and the vehicle acceleration G is less than the acceleration threshold value G1(V), namely, V  V2 or G &gt; G2(V) is set to be position B.  The intermediate region between the positions A and B is set to be position N. [0053]<br>
The variable valve 3 8 is changed over on demand into one of the three positions A, N and B according to the running conditions, in conformity with the correlation between vehicle velocity and vehicle acceleration based on the diagram. Namely, as a changeover control method, there may be adopted a method in which, based on the vehicle velocity only, up to the velocity threshold value V1 is set to be position A, from V1 to V2 is set to be position N, and the high velocity side of V2 is set to be position B.  Besides, based only<br><br>
on the acceleration threshold values G1(V) and G2(V), changeover to each position may be set in the order of A, N and B in the increasing order of acceleration.  In this case, since the acceleration threshold value G is a function of the vehicle velocity V, the latter control is substantially a control based on both the vehicle acceleration G and the vehicle velocity V.  Furthermore, a control may be conducted based only on the acceleration threshold values Gl and G2 on the axis of ordinate, namely, only on the vehicle acceleration G. [0054]<br>
In the control based on the acceleration threshold value G(V), in a low-velocity region, the region below the acceleration threshold value G1(V) is position A, the region between the acceleration threshold values G1(V) and G2(V) is position N, and the region above the acceleration threshold value G2(V) is position B. This is for performing a changeover so that the damping force is increased as the vehicle acceleration increases, in view of the fact that a large vehicle acceleration would be generated at a low vehicle velocity to reduce the front-wheel load, leading to easy generation of kick-back. The acceleration threshold values Gl and G2 are the points of multistage changeover of the damping force.  The<br><br>
acceleration threshold values G1(V) and G2(V) may be arbitrarily set according to the use mode of the vehicle and the like. As for the velocity threshold values V1 and V2, also, the same as above applies. [0055]<br>
Next, the flow of controlling the changeover of three positions of the variable valve 38 based on the velocity threshold values V1, V2 of vehicle velocity V or the acceleration threshold value G(V) of vehicle acceleration G in the control device 40 will be described referring to Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 4, the control device 40 is supplied with vehicle velocity from the vehicle velocity sensor 43 and with vehicle acceleration from the vehicle acceleration sensor 44.  First, the variable valve 38 is preliminarily so set that the home position at normal time is in the normal condition of position N, so that the starting condition immediately upon turning on the main switch of the vehicle is position N (S-1) .  In this condition, it is judged whether the power switch for the variable valve 38 is ON (SW = ON) or not (S-2), and if the answer is No, the process returns to S-l. Namely, when the plunger 50 of the variable valve 38 is not operated by electromagnetic force, the variable valve 38 returns to position <br><br>
without fail, and a damping force in the normal condition is generated.<br>
[0056]<br>
If the power switch is ON, the plunger 50 of the variable valve 38 is operated to change over the variable valve 38 into position A corresponding to the smallest damping force, thereby setting the priority to steerability (S-3).  Subsequently, vehicle velocity V or vehicle acceleration G is compared with the velocity threshold value V1 or the acceleration threshold value G1(V) to judge the relationship (S-4), and if V &gt; V1 or G &gt; G1(V), the plunger 50 of the variable valve 38 is again operated so as to obtain a greater damping force, thereby changing over the variable valve 38 into position N and setting the normal condition (S-5).  If the condition is not satisfied, the process returns to S-2, and position A or N is again selected.<br>
[0057]<br>
Following to S-5, vehicle velocity V or vehicle acceleration G is compared with the velocity threshold value V2 or the acceleration threshold value G2(V) to judge the relationship (S-6), and if V &gt; V2 or G &gt; G2(V), the plunger 50 of the variable valve 38 is again operated so as to obtain a further greater damping force, thereby<br><br>
changing over the variable valve 38 into position B and setting priority to stability (S-7), and then the process returns to S-6 and repeats the steps.  If the condition is not satisfied in S-6, the process returns to S-2, and position A or N is again selected.<br>
[0058]<br>
Thus, according to the present embodiment, the magnitude of the damping force is changed over in a multistage manner according to the velocity threshold values V1, V2 of vehicle velocity V or the acceleration threshold values G(V) of vehicle acceleration, so that a damping force of a required magnitude can appropriately given to the steering damper at the time of a required running condition in relation to vehicle velocity and vehicle acceleration, and it is possible to realize a steering damper system which can generate a damping force suitable for the active will of the rider.<br>
[0059]<br>
In addition, since the damping force can be changed over in a multistage manner according to the pluralities of predetermined velocity threshold values V1, V2 and acceleration threshold values G1(V), G2(V), it is possible to obtain an appropriate damping force according to vehicle velocity or according to vehicle velocity and<br><br>
vehicle acceleration. While a large vehicle acceleration would be generated in a low velocity region to reduce the front-wheel load, leading to easy generation of kick-back, when the acceleration threshold values Gl and G2 are so set as to decrease as the vehicle velocity increases, it is possible to generate an appropriate damping force even in such a situation and to prevent kick-back.<br>
[0060]<br>
Furthermore, even when the plunger 50 cannot be changed over notwithstanding a condition for changing over the damping force by operating the plunger 50 is present, the plunger 50 is necessarily located in position N which is the home position, and a damping force corresponding to the normal condition is generated; therefore, mis-generation of a damping force or generation of an excessively great or small damping force can be obviated.  Such a home position is not limited to position N, and may be position A or B within the range where the damping force is varied in a multistage manner. Further, an exclusive home position may be set specially.<br>
[0061]<br>
The present embodiment is not limited to the above-described structure, and various modifications and the like are possible.  For example, the number of positions<br><br>
may be more than three. According to this, the velocity threshold values may be set more, such as not less than V3, and the acceleration threshold values may be set more, such as not less than G3(V).  Besides, the number of regions for the multistage changeover may be more than the above-mentioned three regions.<br>
[0062]<br>
Further, such multistage changeover may be related only with one of vehicle velocity and vehicle acceleration.  In the former case, the multistage changeover is based on the velocity threshold values V1, V2, and in the latter case, the multistage changeover is based only on the acceleration threshold values Gl and G2 which are values on the axis of ordinate in the graph of Fig. 8.<br>
[0063]<br>
In addition to the above-mentioned temperature correction, various corrections may be added.  For example, when correction is made by use of throttle opening speed obtained by differentiating the throttle opening detected by a throttle opening sensor 35 with time, a correction of the damping force corresponding to vehicle acceleration variation can be achieved.  Besides, when throttle opening is added to this, a further precise<br><br>
correction can be achieved.<br>
[0064]<br>
In addition, in the case of discriminating the vehicle acceleration, information detected by other sensor used in an electronic fuel injection system can be utilized in place of the information detected by the acceleration sensor.  As such means, for example, as shown in Fig. 4, the vehicle acceleration can be discriminated based on any of engine rotational speed by an engine rotational speed sensor 45, throttle opening and/or throttle opening speed by a throttle sensor 46, and  gear stage by a gear position sensor 47, and, when such means is adopted, it is unnecessary to provide the acceleration sensor or the like.<br>
[0065]<br>
Where the vehicle acceleration is detected by an acceleration sensor, the damping force of the steering damper is changed over after a predetermined acceleration has been generated, and, thus, a time lag is generated. However, when the control is based on information detected by the above-mentioned sensor, for example, throttle opening detected by the throttle sensor 46, such a time lag is not generated, and forecast of generation of a vehicle acceleration can be achieved.<br><br>
[0066]<br>
While the throttle sensor 46 detects throttle opening, throttle opening speed is obtained by differentiating the throttle opening with time in the control device 40.  The throttle opening and the throttle opening speed are highly correlated with vehicle acceleration, so that the vehicle acceleration can be estimated by use of one or both of them.  The engine rotational speed and the gear stage are also similar sensor information.<br><br>

GARNTED<br>

[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001] [Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a steering damper system for a motorcycle for damping a swing of the handle during running, and particularly to one that can vary the damping force. [0002] , [Prior Art]<br>
Steering damper systems for generating a damping force against a swing of the handle, in order to prevent the swing of the handle due to a kick-back at the time of<br><br>
a disturbance or the like, have been known (one example is Japanese Patent No. 2593461) .  In addition, technologies in which a damping force is variable so that the damping force is generated only when it is needed and that needless damping forces are not generated in other situations are also known.  For example, there have been known a technology in which the damping force is controlled based on steering angle and running velocity (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Sho 63-64888), a technology in which the damping force is controlled based on variations in front-wheel load (Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 7-74023) and so on.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problems to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Meanwhile, according to the damping force control methods of the prior-art examples, it is impossible to discriminate whether the cause generating a swing of the handle is an external cause such as a disturbance or an intentional operation by the rider. Therefore, even when the rider intentionally operates the handle as at the time of cornering, a damping force might be generated if a predetermined condition is established, whereby handle load would be enlarged. Accordingly, the most preferable thing as a steering damper system is to generate the<br><br><br>
damping force only upon an unintentional cause such as a disturbance and not to generate the damping force in other situations.<br>
[0004]<br>
However, even including the above prior-art examples, there has not been a steering damper system which enables such a control according to the contents of the handle operation, and it is desired to perform such a control that an appropriate damping force can be obtained according to the contents of the handle operation. Further, it is considered that if the damping force is varied according to variations in vehicle velocity or vehicle acceleration, it is possible to generate a damping force suitable for the active will of the rider. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to realize a steering damper system which can generate a damping force suitable for the active will of the rider.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, a first aspect of the invention pertaining to the steering damper system of the present application is characterized in that, in a steering damper system for exerting a damping force on a turning action of a front wheel<br><br>
steering system supported at a front portion of a vehicle body, the damping force being variable, a rotational angular velocity of the steering system generated by an unintentionally caused turning action and a moment intentionally exerted on the steering system in the opposite direction so as to restrain the unintentional turning action are measured, and the damping force of the steering damper is eliminated or reduced when the load direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are in the same direction. [0006]<br>
At this time, while the damping force of the steering damper is eliminated or reduced when the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are in the same direction, a damping force may be generated or increased in the steering damper when the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are in opposite directions.  Further, a damping force may be generated in the steering damper when the rotational angular velocity has exceeded a predetermined threshold value.<br>
In addition, a damping force may be generated in the steering damper when the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are in<br><br>
opposite directions and the load of the moment has exceeded a predetermined threshold value.  Furthermore, in the controls where the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are in the same direction or in opposite directions, a condition that the rotational angle exceeds a predetermined threshold value may be added to the control conditions.<br>
[0007]<br>
A second aspect of the invention is characterized in that, in a steering damper system for exerting a damping force on a turning action of a front wheel steering system supported at a front portion of a vehicle body, the damping force being variable by damping force variable means, the damping force variable means varies the magnitude of the damping force through multistage changeover according to vehicle velocity, vehicle acceleration or both of them.<br>
[0008]<br>
At this time, a constitution may be adopted in which control means for operating the damping force variable means is provided, the control means changes over the damping force variable means in a multistage manner according to a plurality of predetermined velocity threshold values concerning the vehicle velocity or a<br><br>
plurality of predetermined acceleration threshold values concerning the vehicle acceleration, and the acceleration threshold values include a function of the vehicle velocity which decreases as the vehicle velocity increases.  Furthermore, a constitution may be adopted in which the damping force variable means is fixed in a predetermined changeover position within the multistage changeover range when a changeover of the damping force cannot be achieved notwithstanding a condition for changing over the damping force is present.<br>
[0009]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
The steering damper system according to the first aspect of the invention performs a control based on the moment exerted on the handle and the rotational angular velocity.  Therefore, when the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the handle are in the same direction, for example, when the rider performs an intentional turning operation on the handle at the time of cornering, the direction of the moment exerted on the handle and the turning direction of the steering system coincide with each other, so that it is detected that the current operation is an intentional handle operation by the rider; as a result, the damping force is eliminated<br><br><br>
or reduced, irrespective of the magnitude of the moment and the rotational angular velocity. Therefore, the damping force is not generated or is reduced upon the rider"s intentional handle operations at the time of stopping, managing or running the motorcycle or the like situations, whereby light handle operations are realized. Moreover, it is possible to restrain the generation of needless damping forces, according to the handle operation conditions. [0010]<br>
In addition, the damping force can be generated or increased only when the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are in opposite directions.  For example, when a turning action is generated in the steering system due to a disturbance from the road surface at the time of running, the turning direction of the steering system and the direction of the moment exerted on the steering system by the rider so as to restrain the turning action are different; therefore, it is detected that the current action of the steering system is an unintentional action, and a damping force is generated or increased in the steering damper. As a result, the turning action of the steering system due to the disturbance from the road surface or the like can be<br><br><br>
restrained. Therefore, there is realized a steering damper system which can restrain the turning of the steering system by the damping force only when it is needed, according to the actual conditions at the time of running, and which can generate an appropriate damping force without being against the active will of the rider.<br>
[0011]<br>
Further, when a predetermined threshold value is set concerning rotational angular velocity and a damping force is generated or increased in the steering damper only when the threshold value has been exceeded, the steering damper can be made to function selectively only to such an excessive disturbance of disturbances from the road surface that might lead to kick-back, and, as a result, generation of needless damping forces can be restrained more securely.<br>
[0012]<br>
Besides, when a condition that the load of the moment exceeds a threshold value is added to the conditions for the control in the case where the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are opposite, a further appropriate control is realized. The same result can be obtained also when a condition that the rotational angle exceeds a<br><br>
predetermined threshold value is added to the conditions for the controls in the cases where the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are the same or opposite. [0013]<br>
The second aspect of the invention resides in that the damping force variable means varies the magnitude of the damping force in a multistage manner according to vehicle velocity, vehicle acceleration or both of them. Therefore, a damping force of a required magnitude can be appropriately given to the steering damper in response to a required running condition, in relation to the vehicle velocity and the vehicle acceleration, and, therefore, there is realized a steering damper system which can generate an appropriate damping force without being against the active will of the rider. [0014]<br>
Generally, when the vehicle velocity is low, the vehicle acceleration is high and, therefore, kick-back would easily occur.  In view of this, when a control device for changing over the damping force variable means is so set as to perform a control in a multistage manner according to pluralities of predetermined velocity threshold values or acceleration threshold values, it is<br><br><br>
possible to obtain an appropriate damping force according to the vehicle velocity or the vehicle acceleration.<br>
[0015]<br>
In this case, when an acceleration threshold value is made to be a function of vehicle velocity which decreases as the vehicle velocity increases and the damping force is controlled based on the acceleration threshold value, the acceleration threshold value is higher on the lower-velocity side.  Therefore, a large damping force can be generated only when the vehicle acceleration is great as compared to the vehicle velocity in a comparatively lower velocity region.  Therefore, an appropriate damping force based on the correlation between vehicle velocity and vehicle acceleration can be generated to prevent kick-back, according to the actual situations of a motorcycle such that a large vehicle acceleration is generated at the time of low vehicle velocity, to reduce the front-wheel load, leading to that the kick-back would easily occur.<br>
[0016]<br>
Furthermore, when the damping force variable means cannot change over the damping force notwithstanding a condition for changing over the damping force is present, the changeover position is fixed in a predetermined<br><br><br>
region within a changeover range varied in a multistage manner, so that a predetermined damping force can be generated even in such a situation.<br>

Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a motorcycle to which the present embodiment is applied; Fig. 2 is a side view of the structure of a front portion of a vehicle body at which a steering damper is provided; Fig. 3 is a plan view of the same; Fig. 4 shows a general structure of the steering damper; and Fig. 5 shows an action or operation.<br>
[0018]<br>
In Fig. 1, an upper portion of a front fork 2 supporting a front wheel 1 at its lower end is connected to a front portion of a vehicle body frame 3, and is freely turnable by a handle 4.  A fuel tank 5 is supported on the vehicle body frame 3.  Symbol 6 denotes a seat, 7 denotes a rear cowl, 8 denotes a rear swing arm, and 9 denotes a rear wheel.<br>
[0019]<br>
Next, the steering damper will be described.  As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the steering damper 10 is<br><br>
provided between a top bridge 11 fitted with the handle 4 and a front end portion of the vehicle body frame 3.  The top bridge 11 is a member integrated with a bottom bridge 12 on the lower side so as to clamp therebetween a steering shaft 14 (represented by a center line) supported on a head pipe 13.  The top bridge 11, the bottom bridge 12 and the steering shaft 14 are turned as one body.<br>
[0020]<br>
Upper portions of a left-right pair of front-fork portions of the front fork 2 are supported on the top bridge 11 and the bottom bridge 12.  The head pipe 13 is a pipe-shaped portion integrated with a front end portion of the vehicle body frame 3, and the vehicle body frame 3 extends rearwards from the head pipe 13 in the form of a left-right pair (Fig. 3).  A handle lock 15 supported by the top bridge 11 is provided on the front side of the head pipe 13, and is unlocked by a key 16.<br>
[0021]<br>
The handle lock 15 is for non-turnably fixing the handle 4 to the vehicle body side at the time of parking, and is integrated with a main switch being a switch for electrical system for turning ON/OFF a power source for an engine ignition system, a lamp system and the like.<br><br>
The key 16 has both the function for unlocking the handle lock 15 and the function for changing over the main switch. [0022]<br>
The steering damper 10 in the present embodiment is a liquid pressure type damper for preventing kick-back, comprises a main body portion 17 and a cover 18, and is fastened to a nut portion provided at a boss 21 on the top bridge 11 by bolts 20. At this time, the main body portion 17 and the cover 18 are also integrated by the bolts 20.  Symbol 22 denotes a nut for connecting the top bridge 11 and the upper end of the steering shaft 14. [0023]<br>
A shaft 23 is provided in the inside of the steering damper 10 with its axis directed in the vertical direction in Fig. 2, and the lower end of the shaft 23 extends downwards from the main body portion 17, to be integrated with the front end of an arm 24.  The shaft 23 is disposed coaxially with the steering shaft 14. [0024]<br>
The arm 24 is bent in a crank form in side view, extends in the front-rear direction through the center of the vehicle body in plan view, and its front end portion projects to the upper side of the nut 22 to be integrated<br><br>
with the shaft 23 projecting into the steering damper 10. A rear end portion of the arm 24 is a bifurcated portion 25, in which a boss portion 26 on the side of the vehicle body frame 3 is fitted.<br>
[0025]<br>
The boss portion 26 projects upwards over a central portion of a bracket 27, and the bracket 27 has both its left and right ends fitted to bosses 29 (Fig. 2) provided on the rear side of the head pipe 13 at the center of a front end portion of the vehicle body frame 3, by bolts 28.  A stay 30 projecting from the front end of the fuel tank 5 is co-fastened onto the bosses 29 by the bolts 28. The boss portion 26 and the shaft 23 are located on the center line C of the vehicle body.  A moment sensor 31 is fitted to a side portion of the arm 24, for detecting the turning moment of the handle.<br>
[0026]<br>
Fig. 4 generally shows the structure of the steering damper 10. The steering damper 10 is provided in the inside thereof with a liquid pressure chamber 32 in a sector shape widened toward the rear side, the shaft 23 is located at a position corresponding to the center of the sector, and the inside of the liquid pressure chamber 32 is bisected into a right liquid chamber 34 and a left<br><br>
liquid chamber 35 by a partition wall 33 integrally extending rearwards from the shaft 23 in a wing form.<br>
[0027]<br>
The tip of the partition wall 33 forms a sliding surface, which keeps sliding contact with the inside surface of an arch-shaped wall 36 of the liquid pressure chamber 32.  An incompressible liquid such as an oil is sealed in the right liquid chamber 34 and the left liquid chamber 35, which are connected to each other by a bypass passage 37. A variable valve 38 is provided at an intermediate portion of the bypass passage 37.  The variable valve 38 has a restriction passage for generating a damping force, and the restriction is variable by varying the cross sectional area of the restriction passage.  The variable valve 38 is not limited to such a structure, and various known ones can be adopted. An example of the variable valve 38 composed of an electromagnetic solenoid will be shown in Fig. 6 of a second embodiment which will be described later.<br>
[0028]<br>
The restriction of the variable valve 38 is controlled by a control device 40.  The control device 40 is composed of a microcomputer or the like, performs a control based on detection signals from a moment sensor<br><br><br>
31 and a rotational angular velocity sensor 41, detects the direction of a turning torque exerted on the steering shaft 14 from the moment M, detects the magnitude of the<br>
rotational angular velocity to  and the turning direction of the steering shaft 14 from the rotational angular<br>
velocity ω,   and varies the restriction of the variable valve 38 to regulate the damping force when the detected data are in a predetermined condition.<br>
[0029]<br>
The predetermined condition is such that a damping force is generated when the direction of the moment M and the turning direction of the steering shaft 14 are opposite to each other and the absolute value of the rotational angular velocity ω  has exceeded a predetermined threshold value, and the damping force is eliminated in other situations.  The setting of the threshold value can be conducted arbitrarily according to the specifications of the vehicle and the like, and is so made that a control is performed only upon the generation of a particularly great disturbance which would lead to kick-back.<br>
[0030]<br>
The moment sensor 31 is composed of a known strain gage or the like. When a damping force is generated in<br><br>
the steering damper 10 at the time of turning the handle 4, the damping force is transmitted through the partition wall 33 and the shaft 23 to the arm portion 24, and tends to contract or extend the moment sensor 31; therefore, the absolute value of the moment M can be detected from the magnitude of the deformation of the moment sensor 31, and the direction of the moment M can be detected from whether the deformation is compression or extension.  In the present embodiment, the deformation in the compression direction of the moment sensor 31 corresponds to a leftward turning, and the deformation in the extension direction corresponds to a rightward turning. The strain gage may be located at any portion where a moment is generated, such as the handle 4. [0031]<br>
The rotational angular velocity sensor 41 is a known one using an electric resistance or the like, is contained in the steering damper 10, is disposed in the vicinity of the shaft 23, and detects the rotational angular velocity ω concerning the relative turning between the shaft 23 and the main body portion 17 side of the steering damper 10.  The rotational angular velocity sensor 41 may be disposed in the vicinity of the steering shaft 14 on the side of the head pipe 13 or the top<br><br>
bridge 11, to detect the rotational angular velocity ω concerning the turning of the steering shaft 14.  If required, the control device 40 is further supplied appropriately with detection signals from various sensors such as a torque sensor 42 for the steering shaft 14, a vehicle velocity sensor 43, a vehicle acceleration sensor 44 and the like.<br>
[0032]<br>
In the second embodiment which will be described later, detection signals are also inputted, as required, from various sensors such as, for example, an engine rotational speed sensor 45, a throttle sensor 46 and a gear position sensor 47 which constitute a sensor group of an electronic fuel injection system.<br>
[0033]<br>
Next, action or operation of the present embodiment will be described.  At the time of running straight forwards, the rider holds the handle in a neutral position, but the front wheel 1 performs an oscillating movement with minute angles due to self-alliance. Although this oscillating movement also leads to an unintentionally caused turning action exerted on the steering system, such a minute vibration does not cause the rotational angular velocity CO  detected by the<br><br>
rotational angular velocity sensor 41 to reach the threshold value, so that the control device 40 does not cause generation of a damping force, irrespective of the relationship with the moment M.<br>
[0034]<br>
In this condition, if the angle of the front wheel 1 is largely swung to the left or the right due to a large disturbance which might lead to kick-back, the steering shaft 14 shows an unintentionally caused turning to that direction, and, therefore, the steering damper 10 is also turned in the same direction as one body with the top bridge 11, with the shaft 23 as a center.<br>
[0035]<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, if the top bridge 11 is turned to the left as indicated by arrow a, the steering damper 10 also is turned in the direction of arrow a.  In this case, since the shaft 23 is fitted to the arm 24 and is fixed on the center of the vehicle body, the shaft 23 together with the partition wall 33 rests unmoved. Therefore, the arch shaped wall 36 is turned to the right side as indicated by imaginary lines while making sliding contact with the tip of the partition wall 33, and the volume of the left liquid chamber 35 is reduced, so that surplus liquid tends to move through the bypass passage<br><br>
37 into the right liquid chamber 34.<br>
[0036]<br>
At this time, the rotational angular velocity sensor 41 detects a rotational angular velocity ω concerning a leftward turning due to the relative turning of the steering damper 10, which is turned to the left as one body with the top bridge 11, and the shaft 23. Moreover, the rotational angular velocity ω  exceeds the threshold value.  On the other hand, the rider tends to maintain the handle in the straight forward condition in response to the disturbance, and, therefore, intentionally exerts a rightward turning torque (opposite to the disturbance) on the steering shaft 14.  As a result, the gage constituting the moment sensor 31 experiences a deformation in the extension direction, and thereby detects the rightward turning moment M.<br>
[0037]<br>
Therefore, the direction of the moment M intentionally exerted on the steering system and the turning direction of the steering shaft 14 generated by the disturbance which is an unintentional cause are opposite to each other, and the rotational angular velocity ω exceeds the predetermined threshold value; thus, the predetermined condition for generating a<br><br>
damping force is satisfied. Accordingly, the control device 40 varies the variable valve 38 to the restriction side, whereby the flow resistance on the liquid in the bypass passage 37 is enlarged, and the damping force is increased. By this, the turning action of the steering shaft 14 and the steering system due to the disturbance exerted from the road surface or the like is restrained, and kick-back is prevented. [0038]<br>
When the rider turns the handle, for example, to the left for cornering, the rider first turns the handle to the left and the direction of the moment M at this time is the leftward turning direction.  In addition, the steering shaft 14 is turned to the left side, so that the<br>
rotational angular velocity ω  is also in the leftward turning direction.  Thus, the direction of the moment M and the turning direction of the rotational angular velocity ω  are the same, so that the predetermined condition is not satisfied, irrespective of the magnitude<br>
of the rotational angular velocity ω.    Accordingly, the control device 40 detects the active operation by the rider, and controls the variable valve 38 so as not to generate a damping force, thereby permitting the steering shaft 14 to be rotated lightly.<br><br>
[0039]<br>
In the cornering of a motorcycle, for example, in the case of leftward rotation, it is a common practice to first turn the handle momentarily to the opposite (rightward) direction to make it an occasion to start cornering.  In this case, also, the direction of the moment M and the turning direction of the rotational angular velocity ω  coincide with each other, so that this is judged as an intentional handle operation of the rider, and a damping force is not generated.  Similarly, as to the intentional handle operations of the rider at the times of stopping, managing or running the motorcycle or the like situations, a damping force is not generated because the operation in question is an active operation of the rider.<br>
[0040]<br>
Therefore, there is obtained a system that can judge even the cause of a handle action, which has never been present.  For an intentional handle operation by the rider, generation of needless damping force is restrained, and a light handle operation is realized.  In response to a large disturbance which might lead to kick-back, it is judged that the current action is a handle action unintended by the rider, and the steering damper is<br><br>
caused to generate a damping force, whereby the influence of the disturbance or the like can be absorbed.  Therefore, it is possible to generate a damping force in the steering damper only when it is truly needed according to the cause of the handle action, in conformity with the handle operation situations and the actual conditions at the time of running.  Thus, a steering damper system is realized which can generate a damping force suitable for the active will of the rider.<br>
[0041]<br>
The present embodiment is not limited to the above description, and various modifications or applications are possible within the principle of the invention.  For example, while the damping force is controlled to be either eliminated (reduced to zero) or generated in the above-described embodiment, a control may be adopted in which the damping force is varied in a multistage manner or continuously so that the damping force is decreased when the moment M and the turning direction coincide with each other and that the damping force is increased when the moment M and the turning direction are opposite to each other.<br>
[0042]<br>
In addition, since the detection of the moment has<br><br>
the same signification as the detection of the turning torque of the steering shaft 14, the detection of the moment M by the moment sensor 31 may be replaced by direct detection of the turning torque of the steering<br>
shaft 14.  Similarly, the rotational angular velocity ω may also be detected directly as to the steering shaft 14 itself. [0043]<br>
Furthermore, while a predetermined threshold value<br>
is set with respect to the rotational angular velocity a), the control according to the cause of the handle operation as described above can be achieved without setting the threshold value.  In addition, when a condition that the load of the moment exceeds a threshold value is added to the conditions for the control in the case where the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are opposite to each other, a further appropriate control is realized. Similarly, when a condition that the rotational angle exceeds a predetermined threshold value is added to the conditions for the control in the cases where the direction of the moment and the turning direction of the steering system are the same or opposite, a further appropriate control is realized.<br><br>
[0044]<br>
Next, a second embodiment concerning the control method for damping force will be described. Fig. 6 is a model view showing the structure of a variable valve having three positions for three-stage changeover of damping force, Fig. 7 is a diagram showing the relationship between angular velocity of steering and rotational torque for each position, Fig. 8 is a diagram showing the position changeover timings in relation to vehicle velocity and vehicle acceleration, and Fig. 9 is a control flow chart of the control device.  The structure of the steering damper, the control system and the structure of fitting the control system to the vehicle body are the same as in the previous embodiment; therefore, description thereof will be omitted, and common symbols will be used.<br>
[0045]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the variable valve 38 is composed as an electromagnetic solenoid valve, its plunger 50 can be freely moved in the direction traversing the bypass passage 37 by electromotive forces, and has three different positions of A, N and B in its longitudinal direction.  Each of the positions is selectively connected to the bypass passage 37, to<br><br>
balanced point where the upper and lower springs 51 and 52 are in their normal condition.  Fig. 6 shows this condition.<br>
[0048]<br>
Fig. 7 is a graph showing the relationship between the rotational angular velocity of the steering shaft and the rotational torque for each position, in which the axis of abscissa represents the rotational angular velocity of the steering shaft which represents the rotational angular velocity of the handle, and the axis of ordinate represents the rotational torque of the steering which is the damping force generated by the steering damper.  For each position, the variations of the rotational angular velocity of the steering shaft and the rotational torque are in a linear proportional relationship, but the inclinations differ, namely, the inclination is in the order of B &gt; N &gt; A.  The difference in the inclination shows the difference in the magnitude of the damping force generated at each position of the plunger 50, and, since the damping force is greater as the inclination is greater, the magnitude of the damping force is in the order of B &gt; N &gt; A.<br>
[0049]<br>
Among the positions, at position A the damping<br><br><br>
restrict the flow passage to different cross-sectional areas, thereby changing the damping force in three manners.<br>
[0046]<br>
Namely, when a power source for excitation supplied to the variable valve 38 is turned OFF, the plunger 50 comes to a neutral position, and position N is communicated with the bypass passage 37.  When the power source for excitation is turned ON and the plunger 50 is moved upwards in the figure against a spring 51, position B is communicated with the bypass passage 37.  Conversely, when the plunger 50 is moved downwards in the figure against a spring 52, position A is communicated with the bypass passage 37.  Thus, the variable valve 38 is changed over in three positions.<br>
[0047]<br>
The moving direction of the plunger 50 is selected by reversing the direction of the current supplied to the variable valve 38, and the changeover among the three positions is conducted by the control device 40. When the power source for excitation of the electromagnetic solenoid constituting the variable valve 38 is turned OFF, namely, when the variable valve 38 is not operated, position N is connected to the bypass passage 37 at a<br><br>
force is smallest, and this position gives priority to steerability so that variation of the rotational torque of steering relative to variation of the rotational angular velocity of the steering shaft is smallest. On the contrary, at position B the damping force is greatest, and this position gives priority to stability so that variation of the rotational torque of steering relative to variation of the rotational angular velocity of the steering shaft is greatest.  Position N is a normal setting where a damping force intermediate between those of positions A and B is generated to balance the steerability and stability, and this position is also a home position where the variable valve 38 is not operated. [0050]<br>
Fig. 8 shows an example of setting the changeover of each position.  In the figure, the axis of abscissa is vehicle velocity V, the boundary between a low-velocity region and an intermediate-velocity region is set to be a vehicle threshold value V1, and the boundary between the intermediate-velocity region and a high velocity region is set to be a velocity threshold value V2.  The axis of ordinate is vehicle acceleration G, and predetermined acceleration threshold values Gl and G2 (Gl 
 <br>
vehicle velocity V of G1 = f1(V), which is a rightwardly downward straight line gradually decreasing as the vehicle velocity V increases, and is changed to 0 at the velocity threshold value V1. The Gl on the axis of ordinate is the value at a vehicle velocity of 0, and is a maximum, and f1 is a predetermined proportional constant.<br>
[0051]<br>
Similarly, the acceleration threshold value G2 is a function of vehicle velocity V of G2 - f2(V), which generally decreases gradually as the vehicle velocity V increases, and, from an intermediate portion in the low-velocity region, it steeply rightwardly slopes down on the intermediate-velocity region side; hence, a bent line sloping down rightward on the whole.  The acceleration threshold value G2 uniformly decreases in the intermediate-velocity region to be a righwardly downward straight line, and is changed to 0 at the velocity threshold value V2.  The G2 on the axis of ordinate is the value at a vehicle velocity of 0, and is a maximum, and f2 is a predetermined proportional constant.  The acceleration threshold value as a function is represented as G(V) .<br>
[0052]<br><br><br>
As for the changeover of the position at which the variable valve 38 is connected to the bypass passage 37, the region where the vehicle velocity V is in the low-velocity region of less than the velocity threshold value V1 and the vehicle acceleration G is less than the acceleration threshold value G1(V), namely, V  V2 or G &gt; G2(V) is set to be position B.  The intermediate region between the positions A and B is set to be position N. [0053]<br>
The variable valve 3 8 is changed over on demand into one of the three positions A, N and B according to the running conditions, in conformity with the correlation between vehicle velocity and vehicle acceleration based on the diagram. Namely, as a changeover control method, there may be adopted a method in which, based on the vehicle velocity only, up to the velocity threshold value V1 is set to be position A, from V1 to V2 is set to be position N, and the high velocity side of V2 is set to be position B.  Besides, based only<br><br>
on the acceleration threshold values G1(V) and G2(V), changeover to each position may be set in the order of A, N and B in the increasing order of acceleration.  In this case, since the acceleration threshold value G is a function of the vehicle velocity V, the latter control is substantially a control based on both the vehicle acceleration G and the vehicle velocity V.  Furthermore, a control may be conducted based only on the acceleration threshold values Gl and G2 on the axis of ordinate, namely, only on the vehicle acceleration G. [0054]<br>
In the control based on the acceleration threshold value G(V), in a low-velocity region, the region below the acceleration threshold value G1(V) is position A, the region between the acceleration threshold values G1(V) and G2(V) is position N, and the region above the acceleration threshold value G2(V) is position B. This is for performing a changeover so that the damping force is increased as the vehicle acceleration increases, in view of the fact that a large vehicle acceleration would be generated at a low vehicle velocity to reduce the front-wheel load, leading to easy generation of kick-back. The acceleration threshold values Gl and G2 are the points of multistage changeover of the damping force.  The<br><br>
acceleration threshold values G1(V) and G2(V) may be arbitrarily set according to the use mode of the vehicle and the like. As for the velocity threshold values V1 and V2, also, the same as above applies. [0055]<br>
Next, the flow of controlling the changeover of three positions of the variable valve 38 based on the velocity threshold values V1, V2 of vehicle velocity V or the acceleration threshold value G(V) of vehicle acceleration G in the control device 40 will be described referring to Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 4, the control device 40 is supplied with vehicle velocity from the vehicle velocity sensor 43 and with vehicle acceleration from the vehicle acceleration sensor 44.  First, the variable valve 38 is preliminarily so set that the home position at normal time is in the normal condition of position N, so that the starting condition immediately upon turning on the main switch of the vehicle is position N (S-1) .  In this condition, it is judged whether the power switch for the variable valve 38 is ON (SW = ON) or not (S-2), and if the answer is No, the process returns to S-l. Namely, when the plunger 50 of the variable valve 38 is not operated by electromagnetic force, the variable valve 38 returns to position <br><br>
without fail, and a damping force in the normal condition is generated.<br>
[0056]<br>
If the power switch is ON, the plunger 50 of the variable valve 38 is operated to change over the variable valve 38 into position A corresponding to the smallest damping force, thereby setting the priority to steerability (S-3).  Subsequently, vehicle velocity V or vehicle acceleration G is compared with the velocity threshold value V1 or the acceleration threshold value G1(V) to judge the relationship (S-4), and if V &gt; V1 or G &gt; G1(V), the plunger 50 of the variable valve 38 is again operated so as to obtain a greater damping force, thereby changing over the variable valve 38 into position N and setting the normal condition (S-5).  If the condition is not satisfied, the process returns to S-2, and position A or N is again selected.<br>
[0057]<br>
Following to S-5, vehicle velocity V or vehicle acceleration G is compared with the velocity threshold value V2 or the acceleration threshold value G2(V) to judge the relationship (S-6), and if V &gt; V2 or G &gt; G2(V), the plunger 50 of the variable valve 38 is again operated so as to obtain a further greater damping force, thereby<br><br>
changing over the variable valve 38 into position B and setting priority to stability (S-7), and then the process returns to S-6 and repeats the steps.  If the condition is not satisfied in S-6, the process returns to S-2, and position A or N is again selected.<br>
[0058]<br>
Thus, according to the present embodiment, the magnitude of the damping force is changed over in a multistage manner according to the velocity threshold values V1, V2 of vehicle velocity V or the acceleration threshold values G(V) of vehicle acceleration, so that a damping force of a required magnitude can appropriately given to the steering damper at the time of a required running condition in relation to vehicle velocity and vehicle acceleration, and it is possible to realize a steering damper system which can generate a damping force suitable for the active will of the rider.<br>
[0059]<br>
In addition, since the damping force can be changed over in a multistage manner according to the pluralities of predetermined velocity threshold values V1, V2 and acceleration threshold values G1(V), G2(V), it is possible to obtain an appropriate damping force according to vehicle velocity or according to vehicle velocity and<br><br>
vehicle acceleration. While a large vehicle acceleration would be generated in a low velocity region to reduce the front-wheel load, leading to easy generation of kick-back, when the acceleration threshold values Gl and G2 are so set as to decrease as the vehicle velocity increases, it is possible to generate an appropriate damping force even in such a situation and to prevent kick-back.<br>
[0060]<br>
Furthermore, even when the plunger 50 cannot be changed over notwithstanding a condition for changing over the damping force by operating the plunger 50 is present, the plunger 50 is necessarily located in position N which is the home position, and a damping force corresponding to the normal condition is generated; therefore, mis-generation of a damping force or generation of an excessively great or small damping force can be obviated.  Such a home position is not limited to position N, and may be position A or B within the range where the damping force is varied in a multistage manner. Further, an exclusive home position may be set specially.<br>
[0061]<br>
The present embodiment is not limited to the above-described structure, and various modifications and the like are possible.  For example, the number of positions<br><br>
may be more than three. According to this, the velocity threshold values may be set more, such as not less than V3, and the acceleration threshold values may be set more, such as not less than G3(V).  Besides, the number of regions for the multistage changeover may be more than the above-mentioned three regions.<br>
[0062]<br>
Further, such multistage changeover may be related only with one of vehicle velocity and vehicle acceleration.  In the former case, the multistage changeover is based on the velocity threshold values V1, V2, and in the latter case, the multistage changeover is based only on the acceleration threshold values Gl and G2 which are values on the axis of ordinate in the graph of Fig. 8.<br>
[0063]<br>
In addition to the above-mentioned temperature correction, various corrections may be added.  For example, when correction is made by use of throttle opening speed obtained by differentiating the throttle opening detected by a throttle opening sensor 35 with time, a correction of the damping force corresponding to vehicle acceleration variation can be achieved.  Besides, when throttle opening is added to this, a further precise<br><br>
correction can be achieved.<br>
[0064]<br>
In addition, in the case of discriminating the vehicle acceleration, information detected by other sensor used in an electronic fuel injection system can be utilized in place of the information detected by the acceleration sensor.  As such means, for example, as shown in Fig. 4, the vehicle acceleration can be discriminated based on any of engine rotational speed by an engine rotational speed sensor 45, throttle opening and/or throttle opening speed by a throttle sensor 46, and  gear stage by a gear position sensor 47, and, when such means is adopted, it is unnecessary to provide the acceleration sensor or the like.<br>
[0065]<br>
Where the vehicle acceleration is detected by an acceleration sensor, the damping force of the steering damper is changed over after a predetermined acceleration has been generated, and, thus, a time lag is generated. However, when the control is based on information detected by the above-mentioned sensor, for example, throttle opening detected by the throttle sensor 46, such a time lag is not generated, and forecast of generation of a vehicle acceleration can be achieved.<br><br>
[0066]<br>
While the throttle sensor 46 detects throttle opening, throttle opening speed is obtained by differentiating the throttle opening with time in the control device 40.  The throttle opening and the throttle opening speed are highly correlated with vehicle acceleration, so that the vehicle acceleration can be estimated by use of one or both of them.  The engine rotational speed and the gear stage are also similar sensor information.<br><br>

2.	A steering damper system as claimed in claim 1, wherein a damping force is generated or increased in said steering damper when the direction of said moment and the turning direction of said steering system are in opposite directions.<br>
3.	A steering damper system as claimed in claim 2, wherein a damping force is generated in said steering damper when said rotational angular velocity has exceeded a predetermined threshold value.<br>
4.	A steering damper system as claimed in claim 2, wherein a damping force is generated in said steering damper when the load of said moment has exceeded a predetermined threshold value.<br>
5.	A steering damper system as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein a damping force is generated in said steering damper when said rotational angle has exceeded a predetermined threshold value.<br><br>
6.	A steering damper system for exerting a damping force on a turning action of a front wheel steering system supported at a front portion of a vehicle body, said damping force being variable by damping force variable means, wherein said damping force variable means varies the magnitude of said damping force through multistage changeover according to vehicle velocity, vehicle acceleration or both of them.<br>
7.	A steering damper system as claimed in claim 6, wherein control means for operating said damping force variable means is provided, said control means changes over said damping force variable means in a multistage manner according to a plurality of predetermined velocity threshold values concerning the vehicle velocity or a plurality of predetermined acceleration threshold values concerning the vehicle acceleration, and said acceleration threshold values include a function of the vehicle velocity which decreases as the vehicle velocity increases.<br>
8.	A steering damper system as claimed in claim 7, wherein said damping force variable means is fixed in a predetermined changeover position within said multistage changeover range when a changeover cannot be achieved notwithstanding a condition for changing over said damping force is present.<br>
9.	A steering damper system substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
