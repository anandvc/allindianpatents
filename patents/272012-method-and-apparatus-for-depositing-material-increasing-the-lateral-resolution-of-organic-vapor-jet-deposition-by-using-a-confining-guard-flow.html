				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>[0001]	The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for depositing material.<br>
Background<br>
[0002]	Opto-electronic devices that make use of organic materials are becoming<br>
increasingly desirable for a number of reasons. Many of the materials used to make such devices are relatively inexpensive, so organic opto-electronic devices have the potential for cost advantages over inorganic devices. In addition, the inherent properties of organic materials, such as their flexibility, may make them well suited for particular applications such as fabrication on a flexible substrate. Examples of organic opto-electronic devices include organic light emitting devices (OLEDs), organic phototransistors, organic photovoltaic cells, and organic photodetectors. For OLEDs, the organic materials may have performance advantages over conventional materials. For example, the wavelength at which an organic emissive layer emits light may generally be readily tuned with appropriate dopants.<br>
[0003]	Organic optoelectronic devices such as thin film transistors (TFTs), light emitting<br>
diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic (PV) cells, have gained considerable attention of researchers during the past decade. Organic semiconductors can be deposited on a variety of substrates, which potentially simplifies and lowers fabrication costs when compared to inorganic semiconductors. However, the unique processing requirements of organic semiconductors can also limit their application. For example, light emitting devices and PV cells typically consist of<br>
thin (100nm) films of either conjugated polymers or monomers, sandwiched between conducting electrodes. For full-color displays and multi-transistor circuits, the active organic layers themselves must also be laterally patterned. However, the organic layers are typically too fragile to withstand conventional semiconductor processing methods such as photolithography, plasma processing, or reactive ion etching. Many fabrication and patterning techniques have therefore been developed to address these unique requirements, emphasizing primarily the ease and low cost of processing.<br>
[0004]	As used herein, the term "organic" includes polymeric materials as well as small<br>
molecule organic materials that may be used to fabricate organic opto-electronic devices. "Small molecule" refers to any organic material that is not a polymer, and "small molecules" may actually be quite large. Small molecules may include repeat units in some circumstances. For example, using a long chain alkyl group as a substituent does not remove a moleciale from the "small molecule" class. Small molecules may also be incorporated into polymers, for example as a pendent group on a polymer backbone or as a part of the backbone. Small molecules may also serve as the core moiety of a dendrimer, which consists of a series of chemical shells built on the core moiety. The core moiety of a dendrimer may be an fluorescent or phosphorescent small molecule emitter. A dendrimer may be a "small molecule," and it is believed that all dendrimers currently used in the field of OLEDs are small molecules.<br>
[0005]	Early methods of patterning organic materials involved the deposition of organic<br>
materials through a mask. The organic materials may be deposited through 'an "integrated" mask<br>
which is attached to the substrate on which the device is being fabricated, as disclosed in US<br>
Patent No. 6,596,443, issued on July 22,2003, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Or, the organic materials may be deposited through a shadow mask that is not integrally<br>
connected to the substrate, as disclosed in US Patent No. 6,214,631, issued on April 10,2001,<br>
which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. However, the resolution that may be achieved<br>
with such masks is limited due to a number of factors, including the resolution to which a mask<br>
may be reliably fabricated, the buildup of organic material on the mask, and the diffusion of<br>
organic material in between the mask and the substrate over which it is being deposited.<br>
[0006]	As used herein, "top" means furthest away from the substrate, while "bottom"<br>
means closest to the substrate. For example, for a device having two electrodes, the bottom electrode is the electrode closest to the substrate, and is generally the first electrode fabricated.<br>
The bottom electrode has two surfaces, a bottom surface closest to the substrate, and a top surface further away from the substrate. Where a first layer is described as "disposed over" a second layer, the first layer is disposed further away from substrate. There may be other layers between the first and second layer, unless it is specified that the first layer is "in physical contact with" the second layer. For example, a cathode may be described as "disposed over" an anode, even though there are various organic layers hi between.<br>
[0007]	As used herein, "solution processible" means capable of being dissolved,<br>
dispersed, or transported in and/or deposited from a liquid medium, either in solution or suspension form.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0008]	A method of depositing organic material is provided. A carrier gas carrying an<br>
organic material is ejected from a nozzle at a flow velocity that is at least 10 % of the thermal velocity of the carrier gas, such that the organic material is deposited onto a substrate. In some embodiments, the dynamic pressure in a region between the nozzle and the substrate surrounding the carrier gas is at least 1 Torr, and more preferably 10 Torr, during the ejection. In some embodiments, a guard flow is provided around the carrier gas. hi some embodiments, the background pressure is at least about 10e-3 Torr, more preferably about 0.1 Torr, more preferably about 1 Torr, more preferably about 10 Torr, more preferably about 100 Torr, and most preferably about 760 Torr. A device is also provided. The device includes a nozzle, which further includes a nozzle tube having a first exhaust aperture and a first gas inlet; and a jacket surrounding the nozzle tube, the jacket having a second exhaust aperture and a second gas inlet. The second exhaust aperture completely surrounds the first tube aperture. A carrier gas source and an organic source vessel may be connected to the first gas inlet. A guard flow gas source may be connected to the second gas inlet. The device may include an array of such nozzles.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0024]	Organic vapor jet printing (OVJP) is introduced for the direct patterning during<br>
growth of molecular organic semiconductor thin films. A hot inert carrier gas picks up organic vapor and expands through a microscopic nozzle, resulting in a highly collimated j et. The jet impinges on a cold substrate, leading to the selective physisorption of the organic molecules but not the carrier gas. The non-equilibrium nature of OVJP allows for high resolution.., nearly 100% efficient, direct printing of organic semiconductor patterns and devices. The deposition rates may be very high, for example up to and exceeding 1000 A/s. We demonstrate pattern resolution<br>
determined in part by the nozzle diameter and separation from the substrate. For example, employing a 20um diameter orifice, we obtained patterns of~25um in diameter (10OO dots per inch). Further, we print an archetypal pentacene channel thin film transistor at a film deposition rate of 700A/S, resulting in hole mobility of 0.25 cm2/V-s and current on/off ratio of 7-105, (comparable to performance achieved with vacuum deposited devices). Using a scaling analysis the influence of process conditions on the printing resolution and speed are determined. Combinatorial printing experiments and direct simulation Monte-Carlo models support the analysis. The printing of molecular organic semiconductors by OVJP allows for the rapid fabrication of both small- and large-scale electronic circuits. The process can be carried out in a range of upstream-to-downstream pressure gradients, depending on the nozzle size and number, while the downstream pressure preferably ranges from 0.1 to 1000 Torr. Due to the highly localized and directional characteristic of OVJP, embodiments of the invention allow for the direct organic film patterning is possible for substrates of virtually arbitrary size and. shape. In addition to organic electronic device application, the method of OVJP provides access to new film growth regimes using highly localized hyperthermal organic beams, with additional, new degrees of control of film and crystal morphology.<br>
[0025]	In embodiments of organic vapor jet printing (OVJP), a hot inert carrier gas picks<br>
up molecular organic vapor and expands through a microscopic nozzle. The resulting collimated gas jet impinges onto a cold substrate, leading to the selective, localized deposition of the organic molecules, but not the carrier gas. Because OVJP does not use liquid solvents, it allows for greater latitude in the choice of substrate material and shape than other processes such as ink-jet printing, thereby permitting a wider variety of organic semiconductors and structures to be deposited. The molecules used for organic devices are typically stable against decomposition and pyrolysis up to 350-450°C, while having vapor pressures of up to several millibar, allowing high practical deposition rates.<br>
[0026]	One unique aspect of OVJP is that the organic species can be accelerated by the<br>
flow of a much lighter carrier gas to hyperthermal velocities. This can lead to denser and more ordered thin films, which potentially broadens the processing window for ultra-rapid growth of high quality thin films for device applications. This acceleration may also the instantaneous local deposition rate of OVJP to exceed that of the alternative broad-area deposition methods, resulting in a competitive advantage in the rapid printing of large-scale electronics. A typical<br>
OLED heterostructure is -2000 A thick. At 1000 A/s and using a linear array of nozzles, each having a diameter to match the pixel width, a 1000 pixel wide display can be printed in ~30 minutes. The growth rates in the experiments discussed herein are already several orders of magnitude higher than the typical rates reported for fabrication of molecular organic electronic devices, but they can be increased further - for each 10°C increase in the source temperature, the evaporation rate approximately doubles. OVJP is preferably used to deposit small molecule organic materials because they generally have sufficient vapor pressure at reasonable temperatures to allow for a high deposition rate. However, OVJP may have applications to other materials, such as polymers.<br>
[0027]	Embodiments of OVJP generally involve a "jet" of gas ejected from a nozzle, as<br>
distinct from other techniques, such as OVPD (organic vapor phase deposition), where a carrier gas may be used, but there is no "jet." A "jet" occurs when the flow velocity through the nozzle is sufficiently large to result in a significantly anisotropic velocity distribution relative to the isotropic velocities of a stagnant gas with molecules bouncing around. One way of defining when a jet occurs is when the flow velocity of the carrier gas is at least 10% of the thermal velocity of the carrier gas molecules.<br>
Apparatus Description<br>
[0028]	An embodiment of an OVJP apparatus is schematically illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
Device 100 includes a first organic source cell 110, a second organic source cell 120,  a dilution channel 130, a mixing chamber 140, a nozzle 150, and heating elements 160. Organic source cells 110 and 120 may contain organic materials for deposition on a substrate 170. Each organic source cell may contain a different organic material or combination of organic materials. Carrier gas source(s) 105, schematically represented as arrows, may provide a flow of carrier gas to organic source cells 110 and 120, and dilution channel 130. Valves or other mechanisms may be used to determine whether, and how much, carrier gas flows through each of the organic source cells 110 and 120, and dilution channel 130. When a carrier gas flows through an organic source cell, the organic material contained therein may sublimate, and is subsequently carried by the carrier gas. The organic material and carrier gas then mixes in the mixing chamber with any other carrier gas and / or organic materials that enters from either the dilution channel or another organic source cell. Dilution channel 130 may be used to achieve more precise control at lower<br>
organic material concentrations than might be possible without a dilution channel. The mixture of one or more organic materials and carrier gas is then expelled through nozzle 150 towards substrate 170. Heating elements 160 may be used to control the temperature of the carrier gas and organic materials in device 100. By controlling the flow velocity and other parameters as explained herein, the flow mechanics of the expelled material may be controlled to form a collimated jet 155. Substrate 170 is disposed over a substrate holder 180, which may include a cooling channel 190. Any suitable positioning mechanism may be used to control the relative positions of substrate 170 and device 100. Cooling channel 190 maybe connected to a coolant source, and may be used to control the temperature of substrate holder 180 and substrate 170. The organic material is then deposited on substrate 170, and the carrier gas flows away to the sides.<br>
[0029]	Device 100 may be made of any suitable material. Stainless steel is preferred for<br>
its durability and heat conductivity. Although only two organic source cells 110 and 120 are<br>
shown for clarity, more or less organic source cells may be used. Preferably, heating elements<br>
160 may achieve a uniform heating of device 100. Preferably, individually metered carrier gas<br>
streams flow through each source cell to regulate the rate of delivery of the organic vapor.<br>
Device 100 also allows for "make-up" and "pusher" gas flow through dilution channel 130. A<br>
make-up gas flow may be used to regulate the concentration of organic vapor in addition to trxe<br>
source temperature. Pusher gas flow helps to avoid back-diffusion of vapor. In the embodiment<br>
of Figure 1, both make-up and pusher functions may be acheived through dilution channel 13 O.<br>
The motion of substrate 170 is preferably along all 3 axes and computer-controlled.<br>
[0030]	Another embodiment of an OVJP apparatus is schematically illustrated in Figure<br>
2. Nozzle 200 comprises a nozzle tube 210 and a jacket 220. Nozzle tube 210 is defined by nozzle tube wall 217. Jacket 220, which is disposed adjacent to nozzle 210, is defined by nozzle tube wall 217 and jacket wall 227. Nozzle tube 210 has a first gas inlet 212 and a first exhuast aperture 215. Jacket 220 has a second gas inlet 222 and a second exhuast aperture 225. A carrier gas source 230 provides a flow of carrier gas carrying organic material to first gas inlet   -212. A guard flow source 240 provides a flow of guard flow gas to second gas inlet 222. The carrier gas, carrying material to be deposited, flows out of first exhaust aperture 215. The guard flow gas flows out of second exhaust aperture 225. The gas sources of Figure 2 are illustrated generally, and may include any components associated with providing a controlled gas flow to<br>
the nozzle, such as tubes, valves, gas cylinders, temperature control apparati, and other components.<br>
[0031]	In heated embodiments, heat may be provided in a variety of ways. The carrier<br>
gas source is preferably heated to a temperature suitable to sublimate, in a source cell, the<br>
appropriate concentration of molecule to be deposited. Other heat sources may be desirable to<br>
prevent the molecule from depositing onto the nozzle and elsewhere (other than the substrate,<br>
where deposition is desired) as it progresses out of the source cell and beyond. Preferably, the<br>
guard flow source provides heated guard flow gas, which then heats nozzle tube wall 217. Other<br>
heated embodiments may be acheived by using RF or other heating mechanisms to directly heat<br>
parts of nozzle 200, such as nozzle tube wall 217 and / or jacket wall 227.<br>
[0032]	An appropriate guard flow may confine the carrier gas and the molecules being<br>
deposited, and prevent them from spreading. Thus, a desirable sharper and higher resolution<br>
may be achieved. Preferably, the guard flow comprises a relatively heavy gas as compared to the<br>
carrier gas. Preferably, the guard flow gas is heavier than the molecular weight of the carrier<br>
gas, which enables the guard flow to more effectively contain the carrier gas.<br>
[0033]	Although the deposition can be carried out at atmospheric conditions, the<br>
downstream pressure, pl, is reduced to 0.1 - 10 Torr in some embodiments to promote mass transport. To maintain the edge sharpness for deposited patterns as small as 25 jam the nozzle-to-substrate separation, s, is kept on the order of the molecular mean free path, 2, at the deposition pressure, (e.g. 100 um &gt; /I &gt; 1 jam for 0.1 Torr 
Modeling<br>
[0034]	A description of the physical picture of transitional flow may be derived from<br>
experiment and direct simulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC) techniques.  The present specification, in addition to demonstrating OVJP of high-resolution organic thin film patterns and devices, examines how process conditions affect the growth rate and pattern resolution. A scaling model is developed and compared to DSMC simulations and OVJP experiment.<br>
[0035]	A mass balance on the organic species in the source cell (7) gives the expression<br>
for the vapor pressure of the organic species exiting the source cell:<br>
k + V/RTcell where Porg is the vapor pressure, P0fg' is the saturation (equilibrium) vapor pressure of the<br>
organic material, V is the carrier gas volumetric flow velocity, and k is a constant describing the kinetics of the evaporation from the organic surface inside the source cell. Equation (1) shows that the carrier gas flow rate, as well as the source temperature, may regulate the flux of organic vapor, which is a consideration for regulating the concentration of dopants in the deposited films.<br>
[0036]	Downstream from the source cell, OVJP differs significantly from vapor-phase<br>
deposition and ink-jet printing. Unlike vapor-phase deposition, OVJP is not diffusion limited near the substrate, and, unlike ink-jet printing, OVJP does not take place in the liquid phase. The flow rate of gas through the nozzle, Q, is the product of the pressure driving force and the nozzle conductance:<br>
Q = C-(PH-PL)	(2),<br>
where the driving force is the difference in the upstream and downstream pressures (Pn and pl), and the conductance, C, is expressed as:<br>
<br>
a    1 + 3.50 .    1 + 5.17 a/A)<br>
where the quantity in the first brackets is calculated from the kinetic theory, and then modified by an emprical factor for different gas mixtures and conditions. Due to the large difference in the molecular weights of the organic and carrier gas species used in OVJP, Eq.(3) maybe further corrected to reflect thermal slip near the inner wall of the nozzle.<br>
[0037]	While the light carrier gas species are strongly scattered radially by the substrate,<br>
the heavier organic species retain more of their axial momentum (in proportion to the ratio of the organic molecular masse to that of the carrier gas, mjm. This mechanism is confirmed by DSMC results, as shown in Figures 4 and 5. If the separation s is on the order of the /t near the substrate, the organic molecules suffer few collisions within the nozzle-substrate gap. Assuming<br>
that the organic moieties attain the bulk flow velocity u inside the nozzle, their transport rate uz in the z-direction is:<br>
us&amp;u = Q/na2.	<br>
The average velocity with which the organic molecules are dispersed radially outward from the nozzle maybe expressed as:<br>
	<br>
2s mo A<br>
where % is the radial distance traveled after emerging from the nozzle, mc and m0 are the carrier gas and organic molecular weights, respectively, while vd is the contribution from pure diffusivity of the organic particle. This (isotropic) diffusion contribution can be approximated by:<br>
where D and t are the gas diffusivity of the organic species and the time spent en route to the substrate, respectively.<br>
[0038]	Assuming fully developed flow inside the nozzle, a low (
concentration of the organic species, incompressible flow and mass conservation of the carrier gas phase, it can be shown that the organic molecules travel radially outward from their original position in the nozzle by a distance %:<br>
where, m/m0 is the organic-to-carrier gas molecular mass ratio, c is the molecular mean thermal velocity, and u is the mean flow velocity inside the nozzle. The first term in Eq. (8) quantifies the horizontal momentum transfer to the organic molecules from collisions with the diverging carrier gas, while the second term represents the scaling of the radial diffusion rate to the ballistic transport rate normal to the substrate.<br>
[0039]	Although Eq. (8) does not predict the exact deposit shape, it shows the relative<br>
influence of process conditions on the deposited pattern resolution, hi particular, given that<br>
A = kT/ «/2aPL , where cr is the cross-section of the molecule, the dispersion has a minimum for some value of pl, as shown in Figure 3. The value of pi corresponding to maximum resolution is<br>
in the range of 1-50 Torr for typical OVJP conditions. Equation (8) also suggests that pattern definition is enhanced through use of a lighter carrier gas (e.g. He instead of N2). Practically, u is fixed by the desired deposition rate via the total flux of the organic molecules in the nozzle. Thus, for a given nozzle radius a, the remaining adjustable parameters are s and PL. The operating conditions for maximum pattern resolution can thus be plotted on a process diagram (Figure 4), where the operating line dictates values of s for any given pi. For example, to maintain high pattern resolution even at large separation, s, the downstream pressure, pi, may be decreased. The region above the operating line represents diffusion-limited printing, while the region below corresponds to convection-limited operation. Finally, the local dynamic pressure in the region between the nozzle and the substrate generally exceeds pl and scales inversely with s. This places a lower limit on the effective pi, as indicated by the "Dynamic Pressure Line", such that the minimum in the pattern dispersion curve with pl may not be observable under practical OVJP conditions.<br>
[0040]	A common feature of a single nozzle expansion is that it produces a flux profile<br>
domed in the center for virtually all upstream and downstream conditions. Thus, to achieve a<br>
flattened-top deposit, the nozzle can be rastered over an area. Alternatively, a bundle of nozzles<br>
or a miniaturized "showerhead" can be used to produce the same effect. Since the conductance of<br>
a nozzle scales with a3 (see Eq.4), the printing speed can be maximized in the latter approach.<br>
Furthermore, in view of Eq. (8), an annular guard flow of a relatively heavy gas (e.g. Ar or SF6)<br>
may be used in conjunction with a main flow of a lighter gas (e.g. H2 or He) to increase deposit<br>
sharpness. The annular guard flow may be used in connection with other methods of increasing<br>
sharpness, such as rastering and the showerhead approach. With a guard flow, the organic<br>
species are maximally accelerated and collimated by the main carrier gas flow, while the radial<br>
diffusion of species is hindered by the guard flow made up of a heavier inert gas.<br>
[0041]	Figure 3 shows a schematic illustrated of a nozzle 300 having a hollow cylindrical<br>
configuration, in the vicinity of a substrate 310. Carrier gas stream lines (solid black lines) and an expected trajectory of an organic molecule (curved arrow) are qualitatively illustrated. Several variables from Equations 1-8 are illustrated as well. Although the carrier gas flow field rapidly diverges due to the proximity of the substrate to the nozzle outlet, the relatively heavy organic molecules acquire trajectories substantially more collimated than the carrier gas. As discussed herein, the interplay between diffusive and convective processes at the nozzle orifice<br>
dictates the relationship between the pattern shape, nozzle radius (a), nozzle-to-substrate separation (s), and the pressure in the region downstream from the nozzle (Pi). The scaling is usually such that s, the pattern resolution, and the molecular mean free path (/I) at pi are of the same magnitude, as indicated in Figure 3. This implies that downstream from the nozzle, transport is intermediate between continuum and molecular flow. Experiment and direct simulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC) techniques are the best ways to obtain an understanding of this type of transport.<br>
[0042]	Figure 4 shows a plot of the qualitative dependence of the pattern dispersion,<br>
% /a, on the downstream pressure, pl, and a related plot of the relationship between nozzle radius, nozzle / substrate separation, and downstream pressure. Plot 410 shows a plot of the qualitative dependence of the pattern dispersion, % /a, on the downstream pressure, pl. The dispersion is minimized at a given value of pl, due to the opposing balance of convective and diffusive transport rates. Plot 420 shows a plot of the relationship between nozzle radius, nozzle / substrate separation, and downstream pressure, for the region identified by a circle in plot 410. The conditions for the highest pattern resolution (minimum dispersion) are plotted to give the optimum operating line. Working above or below this line may decrease pattern resolution. Increasing s and PL results in diffusion controlled transport, while decreasing 5 and PL results in convection controlled transport. The actual "dynamic pressure," i.e. the pressure between the nozzle and the substrate surrounding the jet, may be higher than the ambient (or background) pressure pl, due to the interaction between the jet and the ambient pressure. Hence, the "dynamic pressure" line is lower and sets the practical operating regime. The operating regime signified by the shaded region under the dynamic pressure line is inaccessible by some embodiments. Without being limited to any theory as to how the invention works, it is believed that the jet flow decelerates near the substrate, and a part of the kinetic energy of the jet stream is converted into potential energy in the form of a higher pressure in the region immediately surrounding the jet stream.<br>
[0043]	While there is no simple qualitative relationship that exactly determines the<br>
dynamic pressure as a function of various relevant parameters such as the background pressure, the stream velocity, etc., it is believed that the dynamic pressure will generally not exceed 10 times the background pressure for the case of a jet ejected from a nozzle without a guard flow, at velocities reasonably contemplated for OVJP, and where the nozzle-substrate separation is on the<br>
same order of magnitude as the nozzle radius. In most cases, the dynamic pressure will not<br>
exceed twice the ambient pressure. The simulation needed to determine the dynamic pressure is<br>
well within the skill of one in the art based on the disclosure herein.<br>
[0044]	Details of the flow calculated by DSMC are shown in Figure 5. Plot 510 shows a<br>
vertical velocity component of the flow field. The corresponding trajectories of the carrier gas<br>
and the organic molecules (in this case, fm-(8-hydroxyquinoline)-aluminuni, or Alqa) plotted in<br>
plot 520. The velocity map shows the acceleration of the flow through the nozzle, reaching a<br>
velocity ~200m/s at the nozzle exit, and the stagnation front immediately above the substrate<br>
surface, where the dynamic pressure generally exceeds the ambient pressure, pl, far away from<br>
the nozzle region. Velocity is represented as shading on plot 510, with the highest velocity in the<br>
nozzle, and the lowest furthest away from the nozzle. The heavy organic molecular trajectories,<br>
however, cross the carrier gas flow lines, resulting in a well-defined deposit. Preferably, the<br>
molecular weight if the organic material is greater than the molecular weight of the carrier gas to<br>
achieve this divergence between the organic trajectories and the carrier gas trajectories.<br>
[0045]	The deposit profiles obtained from DSMC for different printing conditions are<br>
plotted in Figures 6 and 7, where the broadening of the deposit due to increasing s and pl is<br>
evident. The pattern width first varies slowly with pl, but then increases rapidly, indicating that<br>
the conditions are near the dispersion minimum, but that the dynamic pressure exceeds pl.<br>
[0046]	It is believed that the profile of the deposited material is favorably affected by a<br>
dynamic pressure of at least 1 Torr, and more preferably be a dynamic pressure of at least 10 Torr.<br>
Experimental<br>
[0047]	Devices were fabricated using an organic vapor jet printer having an appearance<br>
similar to device 100 of Figure 1. The organic vapor jet printer consisted of a stainless steel, 5-source chamber, approximately 40mm in diameter and 60mm long, with heated walls. The source cells were 5mm x 10mm hollow stainless steel cylinders. The source materials were pentacene and fm(8-hydroxyquinoline)-aluminum (Alqa), widely employed in organic TFT and LED work, respectively. Both materials were pre-purified twice by vacuum train sublimation and then loaded into their respective cells, sandwiched between two small quartz wool plugs. Depending upon the particular experiment, one or more of the five source cells may not have<br>
been used. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas. The vapor and nitrogen were forced through a collimatrng nozzle and onto a cooled substrate, which was mounted on a computer-controlled, motorized xyz-motion stage. The background gas pressure in the deposition chamber was maintained between 0.1 and 1000 Torr by means of a roughing pump and a throttle valve. The deposited patterns were imaged with optical and scanning electron microscopes. The substrates used for the TFT deposition were highly conductive silicon wafers with a 210nm thick layer of dry thermal SiCb as a gate dielectric. Prior to deposition of pentacene, the substrates were cleaned and exposed in vacuum to a saturated vapor of octadecyl-trichlorosilane (OTS) for 15 minutes at room temperature. The cleaning procedure consisted of sonication of the SiOa-coated substrates in a soap solution, de-ionized water, acetone, trichloroethylene (twice), acetone (twice), and isopropanol (twice), followed by a 10-minute exposure in a UV-ozone chamber. Gold source and drain contacts were deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation after the printing of pentacene. A Hewlett-Packard Model 4155 parameter analyzer was used to obtain the current-voltage transfer characteristics of the TFTs, which were tested inside of a metallic isolation box, in the dark, at ambient conditions.<br>
[0048]	Figure 8 illustrates an image printed by OVJP at several different scales. Image<br>
810 shows the image superimposed on a penny. Image 820 is the image with a 1.5 mm scale<br>
line. Image 830 is the image with a 100 micron scale line. The image was generated by OVJP<br>
of Akj3 (flow channel diameter a = 20 um, wall thickness L = 100 um, nozzle to substrate<br>
distance s = 20 V 10 um, a dwell-time of 2 seconds above each pixel location, a movement tune<br>
between pixels of less than 0.2 sec, upstream pressure 430 Torr, downstream pressure 0.24 Torr, .<br>
Alqs source cell temperature = 270°C, substrate temperature = 15°C, deposition rate<br>
approximately rdep = 1300 A / s). It is expected that the deposition rate could be increased to<br>
over 8000 A / s by increasing the source temperature to 300°C, without damaging the organic<br>
materials. At this growth rate, an array of 800 nozzles can print an SVGA resolution display<br>
(600x800 OLED pixels) in under one minute. This speed is comparable to the current state-of-<br>
the-art inkjet printers, which also use print heads containing in excess of 500 nozzles. To obtain<br>
pixels with flat-top profiles, the nozzle can be rastered or dithered laterally during growth;<br>
alternatively, a manifold of closely spaced nozzles can replace the dithered single nozzle.<br>
[0049]	Figure 9 shows an optical micrograph of rows of pentacene dots printed on Si<br>
with a 40 um x 250 um (a x L) nozzle outlet positioned at a distance s - 30 um from the<br>
substrate. Interference fringes reflected off of the substrate and deposit surfaces allow the deposition shape to be determined, using known techniques. Each row of dots was deposited at a different chamber pressure (P: = 1.33, P2 = 0.9, P3 = 0.5, P4 = 0.17 Ton), while the upstream pressure was maintained constant at Phigh = 240 Torr. This combinatorial deposition shows the OVJP regime where pattern resolution can be enhanced by increasing the chamber pressure. This result is somewhat counterintuitive, because one might expect a higher chamber pressure to result in more scattering off of gas molecules in the chamber (for example, as would be expected in OVPD), and thus a decreased resolution at higher chamber pressures. Instead, it has been discovered that a higher, chamber pressure may enhance resolution. Without being limited to any theory as to how aspects of the invention work, it is believed that, in the flow regime of OVJP, a higher chamber pressure confines the gas jet.<br>
[0050]	Based on these results, it is expected that OVJP may be practiced at higher<br>
background pressures than one might otherwise believe. In fact, at higher pressures, there is a favorable effect on the shape of the deposition. This favorable affect is visible at a background pressure of 0.1 Torr, and becomes more pronounced at higher pressures such as 1 Torr, 10 Torr and 100 Torr. As demonstrated herein, devices may be fabricated at atmospheric pressure (760 Torr), which may greatly reduce the need for expensive capital equipment for fabricating devices. It is believed that the favorable effect may manifest at background pressures as low as 10e-3 Torr, but may not be noticeable and as apparent as demonstrated herein. In addition, the higher pressures (0.1 Torr and above) may be achieved with less sophisticated vacuum apparatus, so there is a significant advantage from a cost perspective to operating at a background pressure higher than previously thought possible.<br>
[0051]	Figure 10 shows an optical micrograph of frw-(8-hydroxyquinoline)-aluminum<br>
(Alq3) dots printed onto Si using a 20 um x 100 um nozzle, at Phigh = 240 Torr and piow - 0.24 Torr. The distance from the nozzle outlet to the substrate s was varied (25, 53.4, 81.8,110.2, 138.2, and 167) V 10 microns, with SI = 25 and S6 = 167 um. The dwell time at each dot location was 60 seconds.<br>
[0052]	Figure 11 shows thickness profiles calculated from the interference fringe patterns<br>
of Figure 10. For sufficiently thick deposits, light-interference fringes allow the deposit profile to be determined.<br>
[0053] Equation (8) predicts that the pattern dispersion, x, should scale as sj/2. Figure 12 shows that (FWHM)2 scales linearly with s, in agreement with Eq.(8). The full width-half maximum (FWHM), as taken from the the thickness profiles of Figure 11 after normalization, was used as a measure of %.<br>
[0054]	Figure 13 shows a scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of a pentacene line<br>
printed on SiOa with a local deposition rate &gt;300 A /s and s - 35 V 15 |j,m. Image 1310 is the a<br>
pentacene line with a 500 micron scale line, while images 1320 are the same pentacene line at a<br>
higher magnification with a 1 micron sclae line. The image reveals that the pentacene grows in<br>
the shape of slanted nano-pillars. The nano-pillars situated to the left and the right of the jet<br>
center tilt in toward the nozzle, toward the direction from which gas flows. This effect is not<br>
observed in diffusion-limited growth, such as occurs in OVPD, but may be caused by the self-<br>
shadowing of pentacene crystallites durmg the highly directional "feed" of the crystals during the<br>
OVJP process. This directionality is due to the anisotropic molecular velocity distribution in the<br>
gaseous jet. A similar crystal growth mode has been observed during glancing angle deposition<br>
of metals. Seeding the organic molecules in a fast-flowing carrier stream also allows near- to<br>
hyper-thermal velocities to be reached by the adsorbent and, consequently, the tuning of incident<br>
kinetic energy. This decouples the film crystallization dynamics from surface temperature,<br>
leading to highly ordered films even for relatively cold substrates. This effect has important<br>
implications for improving the performance of devices, such as polycrystalline channel TFTs.<br>
[0055]	To demonstrate the feasibility of the very high local deposition rates for device<br>
application, OVJP was used to print pentacene channel TFTs. The pentacene channel was printed in the form of a 6 mm x 6 mm uniformly filled square by rastering the narrow jet over a 5 mm x 5 mm substrate area. The TFT channels were defined by the Au drain-source electrodes, which were deposited in vacuum immediately following the printing of pentacene. The printing employed a 350 um diameter nozzle, with s - lOOOum, TSOUrce= 220°C, Tsubstrate= 20°C, Qsource= 5 seem, Qdiiution = 5 seem, Phigh = 20 Torr, and piow = 0.165 Torr, resulting in a local pentacene growth rate -700 A/s.<br>
[0056]	The active pentacene channel had a gate width/length ratio of 1000 / 45 (±5) urn,<br>
and consisted of a 5000 A thick pentacene film with an average grain diameter of  200 nm. The<br>
device drain-source current (fos) versus voltage (Vos) characteristic is plotted in Figure 14, showing the drain-source current saturation behavior similar to that preyiously observed for<br>
vacuum and OVPD grown pentacene TFTs. The characteristic was obtained from the drain-source current saturation regime at VDs - -40V. The TFT exhibited some hysteresis in the ids vs. vgs behavior, with the threshold voltage shifting frmo +10 to +17 V in the forward and reverse VGs directions, as indicated. The ids vs. the gate bias (VGs) is plotted in Figure 15, revealing an ids on/off ratio of 7-105 and a channel field-effect hole mobility of jJ.eff = 0.25 ± 0.05 cm2/V-s hi the saturation regime. The hole mobility of a vacuum-deposited control TFT deposited via thermal evaporation was similar, but, due to thinner pentacene in the channel region, it showed a smaller source-drain off current.<br>
[0057]	Organic vapor jet printing was also used to print pentacene TFTs in nitrogen at<br>
atmospheric pressure; the TFTs exhibited u.eff = 0.2 cm2/V-s. The hole mobility of a vacuum-deposited control TFT was within the experimental error of the values obtained by OVJP at pi = 0.2 Torr. The cost of device and circuit fabrication can be significantly reduced by the ability to directly print small-molecular organic transistors at ambient conditions, such as in a nitrogen glove box.<br>
[0058]	The deposition of a working device at atmospheric pressure is particularly<br>
significant, because it demonstrates the feasibility of using OVJP without expensive and cumbersome vacuum equipment that requires time to pump down. For example, the ability to deposit at atmospheric pressure may greatly facilitate the deposition of organic materials in a large scale assembly line. It may be desirable to deposit in a controlled atmosphere to avoid impurities, such as in a glove box filled with an inert gas such as nitrogen, but such a controlled atmosphere may be significantly cheaper, easier and faster to provide as compared to a vacuum. Another way to control impurities from an ambient atmosphere is to use a guard flow, such as that produced by the device illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
[0059]	More generally, embodiments of the invention allow for patterned vapor phase<br>
deposition at pressures higher than previously thought possible in a region between a nozzle and a substrate. Specifically, this "region between a nozzle and a substrate" is the region surrounding the jet of carrier gas as it travels from the nozzle to the substrate, which may interact with the j et. One way of controlling the pressure in this region is through the background pressure, which is the pressure in the room, vacuum chamber, or other area in which the deposition is occuring - for example, by depositing in a vacuum chamber. Another way of controlling this pressure is though the use of a guard flow, as illustrated in Figure 2. A guard<br>
flow may be desirable even in a pressure controlled environment such as a vacuum chamber, to mitigate the effect of any impurities that may be present.<br>
[0060]	"Ambient" as used herein refers to the default state of a parameter, when no effort<br>
is made to control that parameter beyond the normal efforts associated with a home or office<br>
building. For example, ambient atmosphere is 1 arm (or thereabout depending on elevation)<br>
having the general chemical compostion of air, and ambient temperature is room temperature, or<br>
approximately 25 degrees C (or thereabout). "Background" pressure is the pressure in a chamber<br>
(vacuum or otherwise), measured far from any effects caused, for example, by an OVJP jet.<br>
