Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the removal of sulfur from fluid streams of cracked-gasolines and diescl fuels. In another aspect, this invention relates to sorbent compositions suitable for use in the desulfurization of fluid streams of cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels. A further aspect of this invention relates to a process for the production of sulfur sorbents for use in the removal of sulfur bodies from fluid streams of cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels.<br>
The phrases "consists essentially of and "consisting essentially of do not exclude the presence of other steps, elements, or materials that are not specifically mentioned in this specification, as long as such steps, elements, or materials, do not affect the basic and novel characteristics of the invention; additionally, they do not exclude impurities normally associated with the elements and materials used.<br>
The a&amp;ove terms and phrases are ioteaded for use in areas outside of U.S. jurisdiction. Within the U.S. jurisdiction the above terms and phrases are to bed applied as they are construed by U.S. courts and the U.S. Patent Office.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The need for cleaner burning fuels has resulted in a continuing world-wide effort to reduce sulfur levels in hydrocarbon-containing fluids such as gasoline and diesel fuels. The reduction of sulfur in such hydrocarbon-containing fluids is considered to be a means for improving air quality because of the negative impact the sulfur has on the performance of sulfur-sensitive items such as automotive catalytic converters. The presence of oxides of sulfur in automotive engine exhaust inhibits and may irreversibly poison noble metal catalysts in the converter. Emissions from an inefficient or poisoned converter contain levels of non-combusted, non-methane hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide. Such emissions are catalyzed by sunlight to form ground level ozone, more commonly referred to as smog.<br>
Most of the sulfur in a hydrocarbon-containing fluid such as gasoline comes from thermally processed gasolines. Thermally processed gasolines such as, for example, thermally cracked gasoline, visbreaker gasoline, coker gasoline and catalytically cracked gasoline (hereinafter collectively referred to as "cracked-gasoline") contains, in part, olefins, aromaties, sulfur, and sulfe-coataining compounds.<br><br>
WO 01/91899	PCT/US0I/I7619<br>
-2-<br>
Since most gasolines, such as for example automobile gasolines, racing gasolines, aviation gasolines, boat gasolines, and the like contain a blend o£ at least in part, cracked-gasoline, reduction of sulfur in cracked-gasoline will inherently serve to reduce the sulfur levels in most gasolines such as, for example, automobile gasolines, racing gasolines, aviation gasolines, boat gasolines, and the like.<br>
The public discussion about gasoline sulfur has not centered on whether or not sulfur levels should be reduced. A consensus has emerged that lower sulfur gasoline reduces automotive emissions and improves air quality. Thus, the real debate has focused on the required level of reduction, the geographical areas in need of lower sulfur gasoline, and the time frame for implementation.<br>
As the concern over the impact of automotive air pollution continues, it is clear that further efforts to reduce the sulfur levels in automotive fuels will be required. While the current gasoline products contain about 330 parts per million (ppm), the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency recently issued regulations requiring the average sulfur content in gasoline to be less than 30 ppm average with an 80 ppm cap. By 2006, the standards will effectively require every blend of gasoline sold in the United States to meet the 30 ppm level.<br>
In addition to the need to be able to produce low sulfur content automotive fuels, there is also a need for a process which will have a minimal effect on the olefin content of such fuels so as to maintain the octane number (both research and motor octane number). Such a process would be desirable since saturation of olefins greatly affects the octane number. Such adverse effect on olefin content is generally due to the severe condition normally employed, such as during hydrodesulfurization, to remove thiophenic compounds (such as, for example, thiophencs, benzothiophenes, alkyl thiophenes, alkylbenzothiophenes, alkyl dibenzothiopbenes and the like) which are some of the most difficult sulfur-containing compounds to be removed from cracked-gasoline. In addition, there is a need to avoid a system wherein the conditions are such that the aromatic content of the cracked-gasoline is also lost through saturation. Thus, there is a need for a process wherein desulfurization is achieved and the octane number is maintained.<br>
In addition to the need for removal of sulfur from cracked-gasolines, there is also presented to the petroleum industry a need to reduce the sulfur content in diesel fuels. In removing sulfur from diesel fuels by hydrodesulfurization^ the cetane is improved but<br><br>
WO 01/91899	PCT/US01/176I9<br>
- 3 -<br>
there is a large cost in hydrogen consumption. Such hydrogen is consumed by both hydrodesulfurization and aromatic hydrogenation reactions.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a process of desulfurization without a significant consumption of hydrogen so as to provide a more economical process for the treatment of cracked gasolines and diescl fuels.<br>
As a result of the lack of success in providing a successful and economically feasible process for the reduction of sulfur levels in cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels, it is apparent that there is still a need for a better process for the desulfurization of such hydrocarbon-containing fluids which has minimal effect on octane levels while achieving high levels of sulfur removal.<br>
Traditionally, sorbent compositions used in processes for the removal of sulfur from hydrocarbon-containing fluids have been agglomerates utilized in fixed bed applications. Because of the various process advantages of fluidized beds, hydrocarbon-containing fluids are sometimes used in fluidized bed reactors. Fluidized bed reactors have advantages over fixed bed reactors such as better heat transfer and better pressure drop. Fluidized bed reactors generally use reactants that are particulates. The size of these particulates is generally in the range of fbout 1 micron to about 1000 microns. However, the reactants used generally do not have sufficient attrition resistance for all applications. Consequently, finding a sorbent with sufficient attrition resistance that removes sulfur from these hydrocarbon-containing fluids and that can be used in fluidized, transport, moving, or fixed bed reactors is desirable and would be of significant contribution to the art and to the economy.<br>
It is therefore desirable to provide a novel sorbent composition that can be used for the removal of sulfur from cracked-gasolines and diesel fticls.<br>
Again it is desirable to provide a process for the production of novel sorbent compositions which are useful in the desulfurization of cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels.<br>
Once again it is desirable to provide a process for the removal of sulfur from cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels which minimizes the consumption of hydrogen and minimizes the saturation of olefins and aromatics contained in such streams.<br>
Yet again it is desirable to provide a desulfurized cracked-gasoline that contains less than about 100 parts per million, preferably less thtm 50 parts per million, of sulfur<br><br>
-4-<br>
based on the weight of the desuifurized cracked-gasoline,<br>
and which contains essentially the same amountof olefins and aroma tics as are in the cracked-gasoline from which such desulfurized cracked-gasoline was made.<br>
Other aspects, objectives, and advantages of the present invention will be qpparent from the detailed description of the invention and the appended claims.<br>

composition in an amount in the range of about 5 to about 30 weight percent, said weight percent being based on the weight of the sorbent support.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention is based upon my discovery that through the utilization of expanded perlite to form a sorbent base composition comprising zinc oxide, expanded perlite and alumina, ther is provided a novel base composition for the formation of a sotbent , system by the addition of a promotor metal thereto which permits both the control of the attrition value of the resulting sorbent system and the control of the sorbent system activity.<br>
More specifically, in accordance with the present invention, I have discovered that use of expanded perlite as the silica source in a system comprising zinc oxide, silica, alumina, and a promoter metal resulted in a sorbent composition which permitted variance of the zinc oxide content and the alumina content of the based support composition thereby permitted the variance of the sorbent life when used in the desulfurization of cracked-gasolines or dxesei fuels as well as achieving a variance on the attrition value of the sorbent system through the altering of the alumina content of the base support.<br>
Thus, in one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a novel sorbent composition suitable for the desulfurization of cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels which comprises a base support component consisting essentially of<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
zinc  oxide,  expanded  perlite,  alumina,  and  a  promotor component wherein the valence of such promotor component is present in an amount which is effective in the removal of sulfur from cracked-gasolines or diesel fuels.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a novel sorbent system which comprises contacting a base support consisting essentially of zinc oxide, expanded perlite, and alumina so as to form a mixture thereof selected from the group consisting of a wet mix, a dough, a paste, or a slurry, particulating such mixture so as fo form a part^'culate selected from the group<br><br>
WO 01/91899	PCT/US01/17619<br>
consisting of a granule, an cxtrudate, a tablet, a sphere, a pellet, or a microspherc; drying such particulate to form a dried particulate; calcining such dried particulate to form a calcined particulate; distributing a promoter component upon such dried and calcined particulate to form a promoted particulate; drying such promoted particulate to form a 5      dried promoted particulate; calcining such dried promoted particulate to form a calcined promoted particulate; and reducing such calcined promoted particulate with a suitable reducing agent, such as hydrogen, so as to produce a sorbent composition having a substantially reduced, preferably zero-valence promotor component distributed on such based sorbent composition in an amount which is effective in removing sulfur from a<br>
10      cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel stream. The attrition resistance of the sorbent composition can be enhanced by varying the concentration of the alumina component in the base support. The life of the sorbent system for the desulfurization of cracked-gasolines or diesel fuels is controlled through the control of the zinc oxide content of the base support component of the sorbent system.<br>
15	In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
process for the desulfurization of cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels, which comprises desulrurizing in a desulfurization zone such a hydrocarbon-containing fluid with a sorbent composition, separating the desulfurized hydrocarbon-containing fluid from the sulfurizcd sorbent composition, regenerating at least a portion of the sulfurized sorbent composition<br>
20      to produce a regenerated, desulfurized sorbent composition; activating at least a portion of the regenerated, desulfurized sorbent composition to produce an activated, regenerated, desulfurized sorbent composition; and thereafter returning at least a portion of the activated, regenerated, desulfurized sorbent composition to the desulfurization zone. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
25	The present invention is based upon the discovery by applicant that through the<br>
use of milled expanded perlite in the formation of a sorbent support comprising zinc oxide, milled expanded perlite, and a binder there was produced a base support in which the zinc oxide content and binder content could be adjusted so as to provide an attrition resistance sorbent as well as the extension of the useful life of the sorbent system.<br>
30	More specifically, it was discovered that through the use of milled expanded<br>
perlite in the formation of a zinc oxide, crushed expanded perlite, and a binder such as alumina there was achieved a base support composition which permitted the variation of<br><br>
WO 01/91899	PCT/US01/17619<br>
the zinc oxide and binder content therein such that following impregnation of the base<br>
support with a promotor metal the resulting system exhibited attrition resistance as well as<br>
extended life when following the reduction of same with hydrogen. The resulting sorbent<br>
composition was employed in the desulfurization of a cracked-gasoline and/or diesel fuel.<br>

20     component is generally prepared by combining the components of the support component, zinc oxide, expanded perlite, and alumina in appropriate proportions by any suitable method or manner which provides for the intimate mixing of such components to thereby provide a substantially homogeneous mixture comprising zinc oxide, expanded perlite, and alumina. Any suitable means for mixing the components of the support component<br>
25     can be used to achieve the desired dispersion of such components. Examples of suitable mixing means include, but are not limited to, mixing tumblers, stationary shells or troughs, Muller mixers, which are of the batch or continuous type, impact mixers, and the like. It is presently preferred to use a Muller mixer in the mixing of the components of the support component.<br>
30	The components of the support component are mixed to provide a resulting<br>
mixture which can be in a form selected from the group consisting of wet mix, dough, paste, slurry, and the like. Such resulting mixture can then be shaped to form a particulate<br><br>
WO 01/91899	PCI7US01/17619<br>
selected from the group consisting of a granule, an extrudate, a tablet, a sphere, a pellet, or a microsphere. For example, if the resulting mixture is in the form of a wet mix, the wet mix can be densified, dried under a drying condition as disclosed herein, calcined under a calcining condition as disclosed herein, and thereafter shaped, or particulated, 5     through the granulation of the densified, dried, calcined mix to form granulates. Also for example* when the mixture of the components of the support component results in a form of a mixture which is either in a dough state or paste state, such mixture can then be shaped, preferably extruded, to form a particulate, preferably cylindrical cxtrudates having a diameter in the range of from about 0.793 mm to 12.7 nun (about 1/32 inch to V% inch)<br>
I0      and any suitable length, preferably a length in the range of from about 3.17 m to about 25.4 mm (about 1/8 inch to about 1 inch). The resulting particulates, preferably cylindrical extrudates, are then dried under a drying condition as disclosed herein and then calcined under a calcining condition as disclosed herein. More preferably, when the mix is in the form of a slurry, the particulation of such slurry is achieved by spray drying<br>
15     the slurry to form microspheres thereof having a size in the range of from about 20 to about 500 microns. Such microspheres are then subjected to drying under a drying condition as disclosed herein and calcining under a calcining condition as disclosed herein.<br>
When the particulation is achieved by preferably spray drying, a dispersant<br>
20     component may be utilized and can be any suitable compound that helps to promote the spray drying ability of the mix which is preferably in the form of a slurry. In particular, these components are useful in preventing deposition, precipitation, settling, agglomerating, adhering, and caking of solid particles in a fluid medium. Suitable dispersants include condensed phosphates, sulfonated polymers, and combinations<br>
25     thereof. The term condensed phosphates refers to any dehydrated phosphate where the H3O:P2OS is less than about 3:1. Specific examples of suitable dispersants include sodium pyrophosphate, sodium metaphosphate, sulfonated styrene maleic anhydride polymer, and combinations thereof. The amount of a dispersant component used is generally in the range of from about 0.01 weight percent based on the total weight of the<br>
30     components to about 10 weight percent Preferably, the amount of a dispersant<br>
component used is generally in the range of from about 0.1 weight percent to about 8 weight percent<br><br>

In the practice of the present invention, it is presently preferred that the sorbent 5      composition be formed through spray drying. In preparing the preferred spray-dried<br>
sorbent composition, an acid component can be used. In general, the acid component can be an organic acid or a mineral such as nitric acid. If the acid component is an organic acid, it is preferred to be a carboxylic acid. If the acid component is a mineral acid, it is preferred to be a nitric acid or a phosphoric acid. Mixtures of these acids can also be<br>
10      used. Generally, the acid is used with water to form a dilute aqueous acid solution. The amount of acid in the acid component is generally in the range of from about 0.01 volume percent based on the total volume of the acid component to about 20 volume percent.<br>
In preparing the preferred spray-dried sorbent composition a base support component, comprising zinc oxide, expanded perlite, and alumina can be contacted<br>
15      together in any manner known in the art that will form a mixture that is a liquid solution, a slurry, or a paste that is capable of being dispersed in a fluid-like spray. When a base support component is a solid, then it should be contacted in a liquid medium to form a mixture that is a liquid solution, a slurry, or a paste that is capable of being dispersed in a fluid-like spray. Suitable means for contacting these components are known in the art<br>
20     such as, for example, tumblers, stationary shells, troughs, Muller mixers, impact mixers, and the like.<br>
Generally, these components, after contacting to form a mixture, are contacted with an acid component as described hereinabove. However, the dry components and the acid component can be contacted together simultaneously or separately.<br>
25	After the components are contacted together to form a mixture, they are subjected<br>
to spray drying to form a spray-dried sorbent material having particles, preferably in the form of micro-spheres, that have a mean particle size in the ranges as disclosed herein. Spray drying is known in the art and is discussed in Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, Sixth Edition, published by McGraw-Hill, Inc., at pages 20-54 through 20-58,<br>
30     which pages are incorporated herein by reference. Additional information can be<br>

The spray-dried sorbent material can then be dried under a drying condition as disclosed herein and then calcined, preferably in an oxidizing atmosphere such as in the presence of oxygen or air, under a calcining condition as disclosed herein to form a calcined, spray-dried sorbent material. The calcination can be conducted under any 5      suitable condition that removes residual water and oxidizes any combustibles.   Usually, the spray-dried base sorbent material is calcined in an oxygen-containing atmosphere.<br>
Generally, the spray-dried sorbent material has a mean particle size in the range of from about 10 micrometers to about 1000 micrometers, preferably in the range of from about 20 micrometers to about 150 micrometers.<br>
10	The term "mean particle size" refers to the size of the paniculate material as<br>
determined by using a RO-TAP Testing Sieve Shaker, manufactured by W.S. Tyler Inc., of Mentor, Ohio, or other comparable sieves. The material to be measured is placed in the top of a nest of standard 20.32 cm (eight inch) diameter stainless steel frame sieves with a pan on the bottom. The material undergoes sifting for a period of about 10<br>
15      minutes; thereafter, the material retained on each sieve is weighed. The percent retained on each sieve is calculated by dividing the weight of the material retained on a particular sieve by the weight of the original sample. This information is used to compute the mean particle size.<br>
The resulting particulate (preferably spray-dried) calcined support component<br>
20     comprising zinc oxide, crushed expanded pcrlite, and binder, preferably alumina, is then incorporated with a promotor component.<br>
The promotor component which is useful in the practice of the present invention is promotor derived from one or more metals, metal oxides, or metal oxide precursors wherein the metal is selected from the group consisting of cobalt, nickel, iron, manganese,<br>
25      zinc, copper, molybdenum, silver, tin, vanadium, ,and antimony. Presently preferred is a promotor component of nickel or cobalt or a mixture of cobalt and nickel.<br>
Following the incorporating of the particulated, calcined support component, preferably by impregnation, with a promotor component, the resulting promoted particulates are then subjected to drying under a drying condition as disclosed herein and<br>
30     calcined under a calcining condition as disclosed herein prior to the subjecting of such dried, calcined, promoted particulates to reduction with a reducing agent, preferably hydrogen.<br><br>

The promotor components) may be incorporated onto, or with, the participated (preferably spray-dried), calcined support component by any suitable means or method(s) for incorporating the promotor components) onto, or with, a substrate material, such as the dried and calcined particulates, which results in the formation of a promoted sorbent 5      composition which can then be dried under a drying condition as disclosed herein and calcined under a calcining condition as disclosed herein to thereby provide dried, calcined, promoted particulates. The dried, calcined, promoted particulates can then be subjected to reduction with a reducing agent, preferably hydrogen, to thereby provide a sorbent composition of the present invention. Examples of means for incorporating the<br>
10     promotor component include impregnating, soaking or spraying, and combinations thereof.<br>
A preferred method of incorporating is impregnating using any standard incipient wetness impregnation technique (i.e., essentially completely filling the pores of a substrate material with a solution of the incorporating elements) for impregnating a<br>
15     substrate. A preferred method uses an impregnating solution comprising the desirable<br>
concentration of a promotor component so as to ultimately provide a promoted particulate which can then be subjected to drying and calcining followed by reduction with a reducing agent such as hydrogen. The impregnating solution can be any aqueous solution and amounts of such solution which suitably provides for the impregnation of the<br>
20     particulates of support component to give an amount of promotor component that<br>
provides, after reduction with a reducing agent, a reduced promotor component content sufficient to permit the removal of sulfur from cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel when such fluid is treated in accordance with a desulfurization process of the present invention. It can be desirable to use an aqueous solution of a promotor component for the<br>
25      impregnation of the particulates. A preferred impregnating solution comprises an<br>
aqueous solution formed by dissolving a metal-containing compound, preferably such metal-containing compound is in the form of a metal salt, such as, a metal chloride, a metal nitrate, a metal sulfate, and the like and combinations thereof, in a solvent, such as, water, alcohols, esters, ethers, ketones, and combinations thereof.<br>

In preparing the spray-dried sorbent material, a promator component can be added 5     to the spray-dried sorfeeat material as a component of the original mixture, or they can be added after the original mixture has been spray dried and calcined. If a promotor component is added to the spray-dried sorbent material after it has been spray dried and calcined, the spray-dried sorbent material should be dried and calcined a second time. The spray-dried sorbent material is preferably dried a second time at a temperature<br>

Such drying a second time is generally carried out at a pressure in the range of from about atmospheric (i.e., about 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute) to about 689 kPa (about 100 pounds per square inch absolute (psia)), preferably about atmospheric.<br>
20     This spray-dried sorbent material is then calcined, preferably in an oxidizing atmosphere such as in the presence of oxygen or air, under a calcining condition as disclosed herein,<br>
A preferred impregnating solution is formed by dissolving a metal-containing compound (such as nickel nitrate hexahydrate) in water. It is acceptable to use somewhat of an acidic solution to aid in the dissolution of the metal-containing compound. Il is<br>

Once the promotor component has been distributed on, or with, the particulated,<br>
20      calcined base support component, the desired reduced-valence promotor component sorbent is prepared by drying the resulting composition under a drying condition as disclosed herein followed by calcining under a calcining condition as disclosed herein to thereby provide dried, calcined, promoted particulates. The dried, calcined, promoted particulates are thereafter subjected to reduction with a suitable reducing agent, preferably<br>

A sorbent composition having a reduced-valence promofor component of the present invention comprises a proraotor component that is in a substantially reduced 5      valence state, preferably a zero valence state. Preferably, the reduced-valence promotor component is reduced nickel. The amount of reduced-valence promotor component* preferably reduced nickel, in a sorbent composition of the present invention is an amount which will permit the removal of sulfur from cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel. Such amounts of reduced-valence promotor component, preferably reduced nickel or cobalt or 10      a mixture of nickel and cobalt are generally in the range of from about 1.0 to about<br>
60 weight percent of the total weight of the sorbent composition (support composition plus promotor).<br>
In one presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the reduced nickel is present in an amount in the range of from about 15 to about 30 wcighl percent based on 15      the total weight of the nickel and the reduced nickel has been substantially reduced to zero valence.<br>

The sorbent compositions of the present invention, which are useful in the desulfurization process of the present invention, can be prepared by a process comprising:<br>
(a)	mixing a support component preferably comprising zinc oxide, expanded<br>
perlite, and alumina, so as to form a mixture selected from ihe group consisting of a wet<br>
30      mix, a dough, a paste, a slurry, and the like and combinations thereof;<br>

10	(g)       calcining the dried, promoted particulate under a calcining condition as<br>
disclosed herein to form a calcined, promoted particulate; and<br>
(h)       reducing the calcined, promoted particulate with a suitable reducing agent so as to produce a sorbent composition having a reduced-valence promotor component content therein, preferably a reduced-valence nickel content therein, and wherein the 15      reduced-valence promotor component content is present in an amount effective for the removal of sulfur from a hydrocarbon-containing fluid such as cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel when such hydrocarbon-containing fluid is contacted with a sorbent composition(s) of the present invention according to a proccss(es) of the present invention.<br>
A process of using a novel sorbent composition(s) of the present invention to 20      desulfurize a hydrocarbon-containing fluid, such as cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel, to provide a desulfurized cracked -gasoline or diesel fuel comprises:<br>
(a)       dcsulfurizing, in a dcsulfurization zone, a hydrocarbon-containing fluid selected from the group consisting of cracked-gasoline, diesel fuel, with a sorbent composition of the present invention;<br>
25	(b)        separating the desulfurized hydrocarbon-containing fluid from the<br>

(e)	returning at least a portion of the reduced, regenerated, desulfurized<br>
sorbent composition to the desulfurization zone.<br><br>
WO 01/91899	PCTWS01/17619<br>
The desulfurizing step (a) of the present invention is carried out under a set of conditions that includes total pressure, temperature, weight hourly space velocity, and hydrogen flow. These conditions are such that the sorbent composition can desulfurize the hydrocarbon-containing fluid to produce a desuliurized hydrocarbon-containing fluid 5      and a sulfurized sorbent composition.<br>
In carrying out the desulfurization step of a process of the present invention, it is preferred that the cracked -gasoline or diesel fuel be in a gas or vapor phase. However, in the practice of the present invention, it is not essential that such hydrocarbon-containing fluid be totally in a gas or vapor phase.<br>
10	The total pressure can be in the range of from about 103.35 kPa to about 10.33<br>
MPa (about 15 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) to about 1500 psia). However, it is presently preferred that the total pressure be in a range of from about 344 kPa to about 3.44 MPa (about 50 psia to about 500 psia).<br>
In general, the temperature should be sufficient to keep the hydrocarbon-<br>
15      containing fluid in essentially a vapor or gas phase. While such temperatures can be in the range of from about 37.7°C to about 538°C (about 100°F to about 1000°F), it is presently preferred that the temperature be in the range of from about 204.4°C to about 426.6°C (about 400°F to about 800°F) when treating a cracked-gasoline, and in the range of from about 260°C to about 482.2°C (about 500°F to about 900°F) when treating a<br>
20      diesel fuel.<br>
Weight hourly space velocity ("WHSV") is defined as the numerical ratio of the rate at which a hydrocarbon-containing fluid is charged to the desulrurization zone in pounds per hour at standard condition of temperature and pressure ("STP") divided by the pounds of sorbent composition contained in the desulfurization zone to which the<br>
25      hydrocarbon-containing fluid is charged. In the practice of the present invention, such WHSV should be in the range of from about 0.5 hr"1 to about 50 hr !, preferably in the range of from about 1 hr"1 to about 20 hr"1.<br>
In carrying out the desulfurizing step, it is presently preferred that an agent be employed which interferes with any possible chemical or physical reacting of the olefinic<br>
30      and aromatic compounds in the hydrocarbon-containing fluid which is being treated with the solid reduced metal containing sorbent composition. Preferably, such agent is hydrogen.<br><br>
WO 01/91899	PCT/US01/I7619<br>
Hydrogen flow in the desulfurization zone is generally such that the mole ratio of hydrogen to hydrocarbon-containing fluid is the range of from about 0.1 to about 10, preferably in the range of from about 0.2 to about 3.<br>
The desulfurization zone can be any zone wherein desulfurization of<br>
5      cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel can take place. Examples of suitable zones are fixed bed reactors, moving bed reactors, fluidized bed reactors, transport reactors, and the like. Presently, a fluidized bed reactor or a fixed bed reactor is preferred.<br>
If desired, during the desulfurization of the cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel, diluents such as methane, carbon dioxide, flue gas, nitrogen, and the like and 10     combinations thereof can be used. Thus, it is not essential to the practice of the present invention that a high purity hydrogen be employed in achieving the desired desulfurization of a hydrocarbon-containing fluid such as cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel.<br>
It is presently preferred when utilizing a fluidized bed reactor system that a sorbent composition be used having a particle size in the range of from about 10 15      micrometers to about 1000 micrometers. Preferably, such sorbent composition should have a particle size in the range of from about 20 micrometers to about 500 micrometers, and, more preferably, in the range of from 30 micrometers to 400 micrometers. When a fixed bed reactor system is employed for the practice of a desulfurization process(s) of the present invention, the sorbent composition should generally have a particle size in the 20     range of from about 0.794 mm to about 12.7 mm (about 1/32 inch to about Vz inch)<br>
diameter, preferably in the range of from about 0.794 mm 6.35 mm (about 1/32 inch to about 1/4 inch) diameter.<br>
It is further presently preferred to use a sorbent composition having a surface area in the range of from about 1 square meter per gram (m2/g) to about 1000 square meters 25     per gram of sorbent composition, preferably in the range of from about 1 m2/g to about 800 mVg.<br>
The separation of the desulfurized hydrocarbon-containing fluid, preferably gaseous or vaporized desulfurized cracked gasoline or diesel fuel and sulfurized sorbent composition, can be accomplished by any manner known in the art that can separate a 30     solid from a gas. Examples of such means are cyclonic devices, settling chambers, impingement devices for separating solids and gases, and the like and combinations thereof. The desulfurized gaseous cracked-gasoline or desulfurized gaseous diesel fuel,<br><br>
WO 01/91899	PCI7US01/17619<br>
can then be recovered and preferably liquefied. Liquification of such desulfurized hydrocarbon-containing fluid can be accomplished by any manner known in the art.<br>
The gaseous cracked-gasoline or gaseous diesel fuel, suitable as a feed in a proccss(es) of the present invention is a composition that contains, in part, olefins, 5      aromatics, sulfur, as well as paraffins and naphthenes.<br>
The amount of olefins in gaseous cracked-gasoline is generally in the range of from about 10 to about 35 weight percent olefins based on the total weight of the gaseous cracked-gasoline. For diesel fuel there is essentially no olefin content.<br>
The amount of aromatics in gaseous cracked-gasoline is generally in the range of 10      from about 20 to about 40 weight percent aromatics based on the total weight of the<br>
gaseous cracked-gasoline. The amount of aromatics in gaseous diesel fuel is generally in the range of from about 10 to about 90 weight percent aromatics based on the total weight of the gaseous diesel fuel.<br>

from about 100 parts per million sulfur by weight of the cracked-gasoline to about 10,000 parts per million sulfur by weight of the cracked-gasoline and from about 100 parts per million sulfur by weight of the diesel fuel to about 50,000 parts per million sulfur by weight of the diesel fuel prior to the treatment of such hydrocarbon-containing fluid with 20      a desulfurization process(es) of the present invention.<br>
The amount of sulfur in the desulfurized cracked-gasoline or desuliurized diesel fuel, following treatment in accordance with a desuJfurization process of the present invention, is less than about 100 parts per million (ppm) sulfur by weight of hydrocarbon-containing fluid, preferably less than about 50 ppm sulfur by weight of hydrocarbon-25      containing fluid, and more preferably less than about 5 ppm sulfur by weight of hydrocarbon-containing fluid.<br>
In carrying out a process of the present invention, if desired, a stripper unit can be inserted before and/or after the regeneration of the sulfurized sorbent composition. Such stripper will serve to remove a portion, preferably all, of any hydrocarbon from the 30     sulfurized sorbent composition. Such stripper can also serve to remove oxygen and sulfur dioxide from the system prior to introduction of the regenerated sorbent composition into the sorbent activation zone (i.e., sorbent reduction zone). The stripping comprises a set of<br><br>

about 537.7°C (about 100°F to about 1000°F).<br>
The stripping agent is a composition that helps to remove a hydrocarbon(s) from the sulfurized sorbent composition. Preferably, the stripping agent is nitrogen.<br>
The sorbent regeneration zone employs a set of conditions that includes total<br>
10     pressure and sulfur removing agent partial pressure. Total pressure is generally in the range of from about 172.2 kPa to about 3.44 MPa (about 25 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) to about 500 psia).<br>
The sulfur removing agent partial pressure is generally in the range of from about 1 percent to about 25 percent of the total pressure.<br>
15	The sulfur removing agent is a composition that helps to generate gaseous sulfur-<br>
containing compounds and oxygen-containing compounds such as sulfur dioxide, as well as to bum off any remaining hydrocarbon deposits that might be present. The preferred sulfur removing agent suitable for use in the sorbent regeneration zone is selected from oxygen-containing gases such as air.<br>
20	The temperature in the sorbent regeneration zone is generally in the range of from<br>
37.7°C to about 815.5°C (about 100°F to about 1500°F), preferably in the range of from about 426.6°C to about 648.8°C (about 800°F to about 1200°F).<br>
The sorbent regeneration zone can be any vessel wherein the desulrurizing or regeneration of the sulfurized sorbent composition can take place.<br>
25	The dcsulfurized sorbent composition is then reduced in an activation zone with a<br>
reducing agent so that at least a portion of the promotor component content of the sorbent composition is reduced to produce a solid reduced-valence promotor component to permit the removal of sulfur from a cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel according to the inventive process disclosed herein.<br>
30	In general, when practicing the present invention, the activation, i.e., reduction, of<br>
the desulfurized sorbent composition is carried out at a temperature in the range of from about 37.7°C to about 815.5°C (about 100°F to about 1500°F) and at a pressure in the<br><br>
WO 01/91899	PCTYUS01/17619<br>
range of from about 103.3 kPa to about 10.33 MPa (about 15 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) to about 1500 psia). Such reduction is carried out for a time sufficient to achieve the desired level of promotor component reduction contained in the skin of the sorbent composition. Such reduction can generally be achieved in a time period in the 5      range of from about 0.01 hour to about 20 hours.<br>
Following the activation, i.e., reduction, of the regenerated sorbent composition, at least a portion of the resulting activated (i.e., reduced) sorbent composition can be returned to the desulfurization zone.<br>
When carrying out the process of the present invention, the steps of<br>
10      desulfurization, regeneration, activation (i.e., reduction), and optionally stripping before and/or after such regeneration can be accomplished in a single zone or vessel or in multiple zones or vessels.<br>
When carrying out the process of the present invention in a fixed bed reactor system, the steps of desulfurization, regeneration, activation, and optionally stripping 15      before and/or after such regeneration are accomplished in a single zone or vessel.<br>
The desulfbrized cracked-gasoline can be used in the formulation of gasoline blends to provide gasoline products suitable for commercial consumption and can also be used where a cracked-gasoline containing low levels of sulfur is desired.<br>
The desulfurized diesel fuel can be used in the formulation of diesel fuel blends to 20     provide diesel fuel products.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are intended to be illustrative of the present invention and<br>
to teach one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention. These examples<br>
are not intended to limit the invention in any way.<br>
25	EXAMPLE I<br>
A solid reduced nickel sorbent system was produced by mixing 10% alumina (Vista Dispal), 40% diatomaceous earth (World Chemical), and 50% zinc oxide with water at 42% solids using tetra sodium pyrophosphate (TSPP) as the dispersing agent. The resulting slip was spray dried using a Niro Mobil Minor Spray Drier fitted 30     with a 0.035 inch air cap and a 0.35 inch fountain head nozzle. The inlet temperature was 320°C and the outlet temperature was 150°C. Air flow through the nozzle was 70 liters per minute. The slip was delivered at approximately 43 cc/min H2O.<br><br>
WO 01/91899	PCIYUS01/17619<br>
The spray dried product was dried in air using a muffle furnace at a temperature of 150°C for 1 hour and then calcined at a temperature of 635 °C for a period of 1 hour.<br>
The resulting calcined composition was screened to remove fines 250 microns.<br>
5	The screened sorbent was impregnated with 12% nickel (as the metal) using<br>
melted nickel nitrate hexahydrate in 5% water to get it to melt/dissolve. The resulting solution was then sprayed onto the sorbent using a Sono-Tec sprayer while the sorbent particles were rotated in a baffled cement mixer type drum. The nickel impregnated sorbent was again calcined at a temperature of 635 °C for 1 hour.<br>
10	The calcined 12% nickel sorbent composition was again impregnated with 15%<br>
nickel as carried out supra.<br>
The resulting 27% nickel impregnated sorbent was then calcined at a temperature of 635 °C for a period of 1 hour to provide a 30% (by weight) of a nickel impregnated sorbent system.<br>
15	The resulting impregnated sorbent system has a Davison attrition resistance value<br>
of 19.26.<br>
EXAMPLE 0<br>
10 grams of the sorbent as prepared in Example I were placed in a Vx inch diameter quartz tube having a length of about 12 inches and having a glass frit positioned 20     above ths lower 1/3 thereof so as to provide an inert support for the bed of sorbent which was placed thereon.<br>
During each cycle, gaseous cracked-gasoline was pumped upwardly through the reactor at a rate of 13.6 ml per hour. The gaseous cracked-gasoline had a motor octane number of 80.6 (MON) or 92.1 RON, an olefin content of 21.2 weight percent, 340 parts 25     per million sulfur by weight sulfur-containing compounds based on the total weight of the gaseous cracked-gasoline and about 0.03 weight percent thiophenic compounds based on the weight of sullur-containing compounds in the gaseous cracked-gasoline.<br>
During each cycle, the reactor was maintained at a temperature of 700 °F and a pressure of 15 pounds per square inch absolute (psia). Hydrogen flow was at 30      150 standard cubic centimeters per minute (seem) diluted with 150 sccum of nitrogen.<br>
Before cycle 1 was initiated, the sorbent was reduced with hydrogen flowing at a rate of 300 seem at a temperature of 700°F for a period of one hour. Each cycle consisted<br><br>

PCT/US01/17619<br><br>
27<br>
of four hours with the product sullur (ppm) for each cycle measured at one hour intervals over each four-hour cycle period. Aiter each cycle, the sorbent was regenerated at 900°F for two hours with a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen containing four volume percent oxygen, then purged with nitrogen (regeneration), and then reduced in hydrogen flowing at a rate of 300 cc for one hour at 700°F (activation).<br>
The sorbent compositions were each tested over 2 cycles. Each cycle utilized a mixture of 150 seem hydrogen and 150 seem nitrogen and 350<br>

20	The resulting slip was spray dried using a Niro Mobil Minor Spray Drier fitted<br>
with a 0.035 inch air cap and a 0.35 inch fountain head nozzle. The inlet temperature was 320°C and the outlet temperature was 150°C. Air flow through the nozzle was 70 liters per minute. The slip was delivered at approximately 43 cc/min H2O.<br>
The spray dried product was dried in air using a muJOfle furnace at a temperature of 25      150°C for 1 hour and then calcined at a temperature of 635 °C for a period of 1 hour.<br>
The resulting calcined composition was screened to remove fines 250 microns.<br>
The screened sorbent was impregnated with 15% nickel (as the metal) using melted nickel nitrate hexahydrate in 5% water to get it to melt/dissolve. The resulting 30     solution was then sprayed onto the sorbent using a Sono-Tec sprayer while the sorbent particles were rotated in a baffled cement mixer type drum. The nickel impregnated<br><br>

28 sorbent was again calcined at a temperature of 635°C for 1 hour.<br>
One half of the resulting calcined 15% nickel sorbent composition was again impregnated with 15% nickel as carried out supra.<br>
The resulting 30% nickel impregnated sorbent was then calcined at a temperature 5     of635°C for a period of 1 hour to provide a 30% (by weight) of a nickel impregnated sorbent system.<br>
The resulting impregnated sorbent system has a Davison attrition resistance value of 10.<br>

The above data clearly demonstrate that the sorbent system of the present invention provides a system for the ready removal of sulfur from a hydrocarbon containing fluid such as cracked-gasoline.<br>
In addition, due to the low Davison attrition value of the sorbent systems of Example HI, there is provided an operable sorbent system which is attrition resistant and thus capable of extended use prior to the need for replacement of same.<br>
Use of the milled expanded pcrlite in the formation of the sorbent systems of Example IH provided a sorbent composition which has only two thirds the packing density of the sorbent system of Example 1, and thus takes only two thirds the weight to fill the same volume. Moreover, the majority of the pore volume of the resulting composition was as macropores which in turn provided a system most suitable for the removing of gasoline sulfur.<br>
Reasonable variations, modifications, and adaptations can be made within the scope of this disclosure and the appended claims without departing from the scope of this invention.<br><br>
