				<td>STORAGE STABLE SOLUTIONS OF OPTICAL BRIGHTENERS<br>
The instant invention relates to storage stable solutions of optical brighteners based on derivatives of diaminostilbene which do not need extra solubilising additives.<br>
It is well known that the whiteness and thereby the attractiveness of paper, board, textile and non-woven products can be improved by the addition of optical brightening agents (OBAs). The most important optical brighteners in the paper and board industry are anilino-substituted bistriazinyl derivatives of 4,4'-diaminostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid. The anilino-substituent may contain additional sulphonic acid groups, which provide a greater water-solubility. Optical brighteners in which the anilino-substituent contain no sulphonic acid groups have a particularly high affinity for cellulose fibres and are especially suitable for use at the wet-end of the paper making process. For ease of handling and metering, the paper and board industry demands that optical brighteners be supplied in a liquid form, preferably in the form of a concentrated aqueous solution. Furthermore, the liquid form has to be stable to prolonged storage over a wide temperature range, typically 4 to 50°C. In the past, solubilising auxiliaries such as urea or ethylene glycol have been added in amounts of up to 30% by weight in order to provide storage stability. These solubilising agents have no affinity for cellulose, however, and contaminate the effluent from the paper mill. There is therefore a demand for anilino-substituted bistriazinyl derivatives of 4,4'-diaminostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid which can form stable, concentrated aqueous solutions without the addition of solubilising auxiliaries.<br>
GB 1,243,276 claims bistriazinyl derivatives of 4,4'-diaminostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid which contain at least one, preferably two, propionic amide radical(s), as well as their use as optical brightening agents for paper. Disclosed is the preparation and application of a compound of formula (A).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The compound is isolated as a solid, and dissolved in water at a concentration of 0.1% prior to application to an aqueous suspension of cellulose fibres.<br>
Compound (A) is also described in GB 1,247,765.<br>
Compound (A) is also the preferred component of a liquid laundry detergent composition according to EP 376,893 A2. The inventors state that: "The optical brighteners according to the invention are used in powder form or as solutions in water. Such solutions have a content of 18 to 75% by weight of active substance and preferably also contain hydrotropic substances."<br>
There is no suggestion made in GB 1,243,276, GB 1,247,765 or EP 376,893 A2 of any advantage in the use of a counter-ion other than sodium.<br>
WO 02/055646 attempts to solve the problem of forming a stable, concentrated aqueous solution of a disulphonated optical brightener by providing a mixture of two or more bis(triazinylamino) stilbene derivatives. Example 1 describes the preparation of a stable aqueous solution containing 0.2844 mol/kg optical brightener in the form of an equimolar mixture of compounds (B) and (C), each in the form of a mixed sodium/triethanolammonium salt.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The storage stability also relies however on the presence of an additive - referred to in WO 02/055646 on page 10 as (Fi) - which is employed preferably at a concentration of 0.2 to 3% by weight of solution. Preferred additives (F,) are tertiary alkanolamines, triisopropanolamine being especially preferred.<br>
WO 2005/028749 Al discloses optical brightener compositions comprising an alkanolamine and a bis(triazinylamino) stilbene derivative. Preferred alkanolamines are 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, 1-amino-2-propanol or a mixture of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol and 2-(N-methylamino)-2-methyl-l-propanol.<br>
Japanese Kokai 62-273266 claims optical brightener compositions comprising quaternary ammonium salts of anionic bis(triazinylamino) stilbene derivatives. The preferred quaternary ammonium ion is a trimethyl-B-hydroxyethylammonium ion.<br>
EP-A-884 312 discloses hydrates of a bis(triazinylamino) stilbene derivative of formula (D)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which M and MI independently represent hydrogen, an alkaline-earth metal or ammonium. The hydrates are claimed to enable stable liquid suspensions to be produced with low amounts of formulation auxiliaries.<br>
Papermakers however prefer to use optical brighteners in solution form, e.g. for ease of handling and metering. There is therefore still a need to provide stable, concentrated aqueous solutions of disulphonated optical brighteners, which are free from solubilising auxiliaries.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that a specific salt form of anilino-substituted bistriazinyl derivatives of 4,4'-diaminostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid enable stable concentrated solutions to be formed, without the addition of solubilising auxiliaries.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a compound of formula (1)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
R       is hydrogen or a methyl radical,<br>
RI      is hydrogen, an alkyl radical with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a B-hydroxyalkyl radical<br>
containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms, a fl-alkoxyalkyl radical containing 3 or 4 carbon atoms or<br>
CH2CH2CONH2,<br>
R2      is hydrogen or a methyl radical, M+     is Li+, Na+, or K\ and n        is less than or equal to 1 .5.<br>
Preferred are compounds in which<br>
R       is hydrogen or a methyl radical,<br>
R!      is hydrogen, a methyl radical, a 6-hydroxyalkyl radical containing 2 or 3 carbon atoms,<br>
R2      is hydrogen or a methyl radical,<br>
M+     is Na+, and<br>
n        is less than or equal to 1 .5.<br>
More preferred are compounds in which<br>
R       is hydrogen,<br>
RI      is hydrogen, a methyl radical or a B-hydroxyalkyl radical containing 2 carbon atoms,<br>
R2      is hydrogen,<br>
M+     is Na+, and<br>
n        is less than or equal to 1.5.<br>
Especially preferred are compounds in which R       is hydrogen, R!       is -CH2CH2OH, R2      is hydrogen,<br>
M+     is Na+, and<br>
n        is less than or equal to 1.2.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the production of the above compounds, the process being characterised in that a compound of formula (2)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in the form of an aqueous solution is converted to a mixed salt form (1) in which at least 25% of the M+ ions associated with the sulphonate groups have been replaced by (CH3)2NH+CH2CH2OH ions, either by treatment with 2-dimethylaminoethanol and a mineral acid (for example HC1 or H2SO4) or by sequential treatment with a cationic ion-exchange resin and 2-dimethylaminoethanol. The compound of formula (1) is then optionally isolated, and may be further separated from excess salts and alkanolamine by membrane filtration.<br>
The preferred membrane filtration process is that of ultrafiltration using, e.g, polysulphone, polyvinylidenefluoride, cellulose acetate or thin-film membranes.<br>
The invention further provides an aqueous solution of one or more compounds of formula (1) which may optionally contain one or more carriers, antifreezes, defoamers, solubilizing aids, preservatives, complexing agents etc., as well as organic by-products formed during the preparation of the optical brightener.<br>
Carriers are known to give improved whitening characteristics to pigmented coating brightener compositions and may be, e.g., polyethylene glycols, polyvinyl alcohols or carboxymethylcelluloses.<br>
Antifreezes may be, e.g., urea, diethylene glycol or triethylene glycol.<br>
Solubilizing aids may be, e.g., urea, triethanolamine, triisopropanolamine or 2-dimethylaminoethanol.<br>
Compounds of formula (1) and their solutions are suitable for use as optical brighteners for the whitening of textiles, paper, board and non-wovens. They are particularly useful for the whitening of paper and board, and are suitable for application either to an aqueous suspension of pulp, or to the surface of paper, especially in a pigmented coating composition. They are characterized by high storage stability, yield and ease of application. They are also highly compatible with other additives conventionally employed in the production of cellulosic articles, especially paper and board.<br>
