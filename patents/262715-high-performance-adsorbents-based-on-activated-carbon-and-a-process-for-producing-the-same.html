				<td>HIGH-PERFORMANCE ADSORBENTS BASED ON ACTIVATED CARBON<br>
HAVING HIGH MESO- AND MACROPOROSITY<br>
The present invention concerns the adsorption arts.<br>
More particularly, the present invention concerns high-<br>
performance adsorbents based on activated carbon of<br>
high meso- and macroporosity and a process for produc-<br>
tion thereof and also the use of these high-performance<br>
adsorbents, particularly for adsorptive filtering mate-<br>
rials, for the food industry (for example for preparing<br>
and/or decolorizing food products, for the adsorption<br>
of toxins, noxiants and odors, particularly from gas or<br>
air streams, for purifying or cleaning gases, particu-<br>
larly air, and liquids, particularly water, for appli-<br>
cation in medicine or to be more precise pharmacy, and<br>
also as sorptive storage media particularly for gases,<br>
liquids and the like.<br>
Activated carbon has fairly unspecific adsorptive prop-<br>
erties and therefore is the most widely used adsorbent.<br>
Legislation as well as the rising sense of responsibil-<br>
ity for the environment lead to a rising demand for ac-<br>
tivated carbon.<br>
Activated carbon is generally obtained by carbonization<br>
(also referred to by the synonyms of smoldering, pyro-<br>
lysis, burn-out, etc) and subsequent activation of car-<br>
bonaceous compounds, preferably such compounds as lead<br>
to economically reasonable yields. This is because the<br>
weight losses through detachment of volatile constitu-<br>
ents in the course of carbonization and through the<br>
subsequent burn-out in the course of activation are ap-<br>
preciable. For further details concerning the produc-<br>
tion of activated carbon, see for example H.v. Kienle<br>
and E. Bader, Aktivkohle und ihre industrielle An-<br>
wendung, Enke Verlag Stuttgart, 1980.<br>
The constitution of the activated carbon produced -<br>
finely or coarsely porous, firm or brittle, etc - de-<br><br>
pends on the starting material. Customary starting ma-<br>
terials are coconut shells, charcoal and wood (for ex-<br>
ample wood wastes), peat, bituminous coal, pitches, but<br>
also particular plastics which play a certain part in<br>
the production of woven activated carbon fabrics for<br>
example.<br>
Activated carbon is used in various forms: pulverized<br>
carbon, splint coal carbon, granulocarbon, molded car-<br>
bon and also, since the end of the 1970s, spherical ac-<br>
tivated carbon ("spherocarbon"). Spherical activated<br>
carbon has a number of advantages over other forms of<br>
activated carbon such as pulverized carbon, splint coal<br>
carbon, granulocarbon, molded carbon and the like that<br>
make it useful or even indispensable for certain appli-<br>
cations: it is free flowing, abrasion resistant or to<br>
be more precise dustless, and hard. Spherocarbon is in<br>
great demand for particular applications, for example,<br>
because of its specific form, but also because of its<br>
high abrasion resistance.<br>
Spherocarbon is mostly still being produced today by<br>
multistage and very costly and inconvenient processes.<br>
The best known process consists in producing spherules<br>
from bituminous coal tar pitch and suitable asphaltic<br>
residues from the petrochemical industry, which are<br>
oxidized to render them unmeltable and then smoldered<br>
and activated. For example, spherocarbon can also be<br>
produced in a multistage process proceeding from bitu-<br>
men. These multistage processes are very cost intensive<br>
and the associated high cost of this spherocarbon pre-<br>
vents many applications wherein spherocarbon ought to<br>
be preferable by virtue of its properties.<br>
WO 98/07655 A1 describes a process for producing acti-<br>
vated carbon spherules wherein a mixture comprising a<br>
diisocyanate production distillation residue, a carbo-<br>
naceous processing aid and if appropriate one or more<br>
further additives is processed into free-flowing spher-<br><br>
ules and subsequently the spherules obtained in this<br>
way are carbonized and then activated.<br>
It is further prior art to produce spherocarbon by<br>
smoldering and subsequent activation of new or used ion<br>
exchangers comprising sulfonic acid groups, or by smol-<br>
dering ion exchanger precursors in the presence of sul-<br>
furic acid and subsequent activation, the sulfonic acid<br>
groups and the sulfuric acid respectively having the<br>
function of a crosslinker. Such processes are described<br>
for example in DE 43 28 219 A1 and DE 43 04 026 A1 and<br>
also in DE 196 00 237 Al including the German patent-<br>
of-addition application DE 196 25 069 A1.<br>
However, there are a number of specific applications<br>
where it is not only the geometry or to be more precise<br>
the external shape of the activated carbon which is of<br>
decisive importance, but also its porosity, in particu-<br>
lar the total pore volume and the adsorption capacity<br>
on the one hand and the distribution of the pores,<br>
i.e., the fraction of micro-, meso- and macropores in<br>
relation to the total pore volume, on the other.<br>
There are a number of applications requiring a particu-<br>
larly high meso- and macroporosity of the activated<br>
carbon, i.e., a high meso- and macropore volume frac-<br>
tion, coupled with an altogether high total pore vol-<br>
ume, for example in relation to the applications men-<br>
tioned at the beginning, for example for use in the<br>
food industry, in the manufacture of certain adsorptive<br>
filtering materials (for example for NBC protective ap-<br>
parel) , for the adsorption of toxins, noxiants and<br>
odors, particularly from gas or air streams, for puri-<br>
fying or cleaning gases, such as in particular air, and<br>
also liquids, for application in medicine or to be more<br>
precise pharmacy, in the sorptive storage of gases or<br>
liquids and the like.<br>
True, the activated carbon known for this purpose from<br><br>
the prior art does have a certain degree of meso- and<br>
macroporosity, but that degree is not sufficient in all<br>
cases. In addition, increasing porosity is often ob-<br>
served to be accompanied by an unwelcome, occasionally<br>
unacceptable decrease in mechanical stability or to be<br>
more precise abrasion resistance. Nor are the fraction<br>
of the total pore volume which is accounted for by<br>
meso- and macropores and the absolute pore volume al-<br>
ways sufficient to ensure adequate performance capabil-<br>
ity and/or an adequate impregnatability (for example<br>
impregnation with metals or metal salts) for all appli-<br>
cations.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to<br>
provide, on the basis of activated carbon, a high-<br>
performance adsorbent which is suitable for the afore-<br>
mentioned fields of application in particular and which<br>
at least substantially avoids or else at least amelio-<br>
rates the above-described disadvantages of the prior<br>
art. More particularly, the adsorbent to be provided<br>
according to the present invention should have a high<br>
meso- and macroporosity, i.e., a high meso- and macro-<br>
porous fraction in relation to the total pore volume<br>
and also a large total pore volume, yet at the same<br>
time also good mechanical stability, particularly a<br>
high stability to abrasion and bursting.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "mi-<br>
cropores" refers to pores having pore diameters of up<br>
to 20 A inclusive, whereas the term "mesopores" refers<br>
to pores having pore diameters in the range of more<br>
than 20 A (i.e., &gt; 20 Å) to 500 Å inclusive and the<br>
term "macropores" refers to pores having pore diameters<br>
of more than 500 Å (i.e., &gt; 500 Å):<br>
•	micropores: pore diametermicropores ≥ 20 Å<br>
•	mesopores: 20 Å 
•	macropores: pore diametermacropores &gt; 500 Å<br>
By way of a solution to the problem described above,<br><br>
the present invention proposes - in accordance with a<br>
first aspect of the present invention - high-<br>
performance adsorbents based on activated carbon in the<br>
form of discrete grains of activated carbon, preferably<br>
in spherical form, according to claim 1. Further, in<br>
particular advantageous embodiments of the high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention are<br>
subject matter of the corresponding subclaims.<br>
The present invention further provides - in accordance<br>
with a second aspect of the present invention - the<br>
present invention process for producing the high-<br>
performance adsorbents according to the present inven-<br>
tion, as more particularly defined in the corresponding<br>
process claims.<br>
The present invention yet further provides - in accor-<br>
dance with a third aspect of the present invention -<br>
the present invention use of the high-performance ad-<br>
sorbents according to the present invention, as more<br>
particularly defined in the corresponding use claims.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides - in accor-<br>
dance with a first aspect of the present invention -<br>
high-performance adsorbents based on activated carbon<br>
in the form of discrete grains of activated carbon,<br>
preferably in spherical form, these high-performance<br>
adsorbents being characterized by the following parame-<br>
ters :<br>
•	a pore volume fraction formed by pores having pore<br>
diameters of more than 20 A (i.e., in other words, a<br>
meso- and macropore volume fraction) which comprises<br>
at least 55% of the total pore volume of high-<br>
performance adsorbents (This parameter is inter-<br>
changeably also referred to as "fraction of external<br>
pore volume in relation to total pore volume".),<br>
•	a measure of central tendency pore diameter of more<br><br>
than 25 A.<br>
• a BET surface area of at least 1250 m2/g,<br>
The present high-performance adsorbents or to be more<br>
precise activated carbons, in addition to the afore-<br>
mentioned properties or to be more precise parameters,<br>
particularly a high meso- and macropore volume fraction<br>
(i.e., a high pore volume fraction due to pores having<br>
a pore diameter of more than 20 Å), are further notable<br>
in particular for a large total porosity and a simulta-<br>
neously large BET surface area.<br>
As will be shown in what follows, the mechanical<br>
strength, particularly the abrasion resistance and the<br>
bursting or to be more precise compressive strength, of<br>
the present high-performance adsorbents is despite the<br>
high total porosity extremely high - in contrast to<br>
comparable high-porosity activated carbons of the prior<br>
art - so that the present high-performance adsorbents<br>
or to be more precise activated carbons are also suit-<br>
able for applications where they are exposed to large<br>
mechanical loads.<br>
In relation to all the parameter indications here-<br>
inabove and hereinbelow, it is to be noted that the re-<br>
cited limits, in particular upper and lower limits, are<br>
included, i.e., all statements of values are to be un-<br>
derstood as including the respective limits, except<br>
where otherwise stated in an individual case. It will<br>
further be understood that in an individual case or in<br>
relation to an application it may be necessary if ap-<br>
propriate to depart slightly from the limits mentioned<br>
without leaving the realm of the present invention.<br>
The hereinabove and hereinbelow mentioned parameter<br>
data are determined using standardized or explicitly<br>
indicated methods of determination or using methods of<br>
determination familiar per se to one skilled in the<br><br>
art.<br>
The parameter data concerning the characterization of<br>
the porosity, particularly of the above-specified meso-<br>
and macropore fraction (i.e., the fraction of the total<br>
pore volume of the high-performance adsorbents which is<br>
contributed by pores having pore diameters of more than<br>
20 A) each follow from the nitrogen isotherm of the ac-<br>
tivated carbon measured.<br>
The measure of central tendency pore diameter is simi-<br>
larly determined on the basis of the respective nitro-<br>
gen isotherms.<br>
The BET method of determining the specific surface area<br>
is in principle known as such to one skilled in the<br>
art, so that no further details need be furnished in<br>
this regard. All BET surface area data are based on the<br>
ASTM D6556-04 method of determination. The present in-<br>
vention utilizes the Multipoint BET (MP-BET) method of<br>
determination in a partial pressure range p/po of 0.05<br>
to 0.1.<br>
With regard to further details concerning the determi-<br>
nation of the BET surface area or to be precise con-<br>
cerning the BET method, reference may be made to the<br>
aforementioned ASTM D6556-04 standard and also to Rompp<br>
Chemielexikon, 10th edition, Georg Thieme Verlag,<br>
Stuttgart/New York, headword: "BET-Methode", including<br>
the references cited therein, and to Winnacker-Kuchler<br>
(3rd edition), Volume 7, pages 93 ff, and also to Z.<br>
Anal. Chem. 238, pages 187 to 193 (1968).<br>
As observed above and more particularly specified here-<br>
inbelow, one special feature of the high-performance<br>
adsorbents of the present invention is that they have a<br>
very large total pore volume as determined by the Gur-<br>
vich method, to provide a very large adsorptive capac-<br>
ity in which the meso- and macropore volume fraction<br><br>
(i.e., that is, the pore volume fraction due to pores<br>
having pore diameters above 20 Å) is high, viz. at<br>
least 55% of the total pore volume.<br>
The Gurvich determination of total pore volume is a<br>
method of measurement/determination known per se in<br>
this field to a person skilled in the art. For further<br>
details concerning the Gurvich determination of total<br>
pore volume reference may be made for example to<br>
L. Gurvich (1915), J. Phys. Chem. Soc. Russ. 47, 805,<br>
and also to S. Lowell et al., Characterization of Po-<br>
rous Solids and Powders: Surface Area Pore Size and<br>
Density, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Article Technology<br>
Series, pages 111 et seq.<br>
The Gurvich total pore volume of the high-performance<br>
adsorbents of the present invention is at least<br>
0.8 cm3/g, particularly at least 1.0 cm3/g, preferably<br>
at least 1.2 cm3/g, and can generally attain values of<br>
up to 2.0 cm3/g, particularly up to 2.5 cm3/g, prefera-<br>
bly up to 3.0 cm3/g, more preferably up to 3.5 cm3/g.<br>
The Gurvich total pore volume of the high-performance<br>
adsorbents of the present invention is generally in the<br>
range from 0.8 to 3.5 cm3/g, particularly 1.0 to<br>
3.5 cm3/g, preferably 1.2 to 3.2 cm3/g.<br>
Owing to their high meso- and macroporosity, the meso-<br>
and macropore volume of the high-performance adsorbents<br>
of the present invention (i.e., that is, in other<br>
words, the pore volume formed by pores having pore di-<br>
ameters of more than 20 Å) is relatively high in that<br>
in general the carbon black method pore volume of the<br>
high-performance adsorbents of the present invention<br>
which is formed by pores having pore diameters of more<br>
than 20 A (i.e., that is, the meso- and macropore vol-<br>
ume) is in the range from 0.4 to 3.3 cm3/g, particularly<br>
0.8 to 3.2 cm3/g, preferably 1.0 to 3.1 cm3/g, more<br>
preferably 1.2 to 3.0 cm3/g, most preferably 1.2 to<br><br>
2.8 cm3/g. The pore volume formed by pores having pore<br>
diameters of more than 20 Å is interchangeably also re-<br>
ferred to as "external pore volume".<br>
Generally at least 60%, particularly at least 65%,<br>
preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 75%,<br>
most preferably at least 80% of the total pore volume<br>
of the high-performance adsorbents of the present in-<br>
vention is formed by the pore volume of pores having<br>
pore diameters of more than 20 A (i.e., that is, in<br>
other words, by the meso- and macropore volume).<br>
Generally 55% to 95%, particularly 60% to 95%, prefera-<br>
bly 65% to 90%, more preferably 70 to 85% of the total<br>
pore volume of the high-performance adsorbents of the<br>
present invention is formed by the pore volume of pores<br>
having pore diameters of more than 20 Å. The aforemen-<br>
tioned percentages thus identify that proportion of the<br>
total pore volume of the high-performance adsorbents of<br>
the present invention which is attributable to the<br>
fraction of the so-called external pore volume (i.e.,<br>
the pore volume formed by pores having pore diameters<br>
of more than 20 Å) .<br>
The carbon black method of determination is known per<br>
se to one skilled in the art (as is the corresponding<br>
analysis, including plotting and fixing of the p/p0<br>
range) , so that no further details are needed in this<br>
regard. In addition, for further details of the carbon<br>
black method of determining the pore surface area and<br>
the pore volume reference may be made for example to<br>
R.W. Magee, Evaluation of the External Surface Area of<br>
Carbon Black by Nitrogen Adsorption, Presented at the<br>
Meeting of the Rubber Division of the American Chem.<br>
Soc, October 1994, for example cited in: Quantachrome<br>
Instruments, AUTOSORB-1, AS1 WinVersion 1.50, Operating<br>
Manual, OM, 05061, Quantachrome Instruments 2004, Flor-<br>
ida, USA, pages 71 ff.<br><br>
Owing to the high meso- and macroporosity of the high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention, the<br>
measure of central tendency pore diameter is relatively<br>
high in that in general it is at least 30 Å, particu-<br>
larly at least 35 Å, preferably at least 40 Å.<br>
In general, the measure of central tendency pore diame-<br>
ter of the high-performance adsorbents of the present<br>
invention is in the range from 25 to 75 Å, particularly<br>
30 to 75 Å, preferably 35 to 70 Å, more preferably 40<br>
to 65 Å.<br>
As stated above, it is a further special feature of the<br>
high-performance adsorbents of the present invention<br>
that BET surface area is relatively large and that it<br>
is at least 1250 m2/g, preferably at least 1400 m2/g,<br>
more preferably at least 1500 m2/g, most preferably at<br>
least 1600 m2/g.<br>
In general, the BET surface area of the high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention is in<br>
the range from 1250 m2/g to 2800 m2/g, particularly 1400<br>
to 2500 m2/g, preferably 1500 to 2300 m2/g, more pref-<br>
erably 1600 to 2100 m2/g.<br>
The carbon black method external pore surface area of<br>
the high-performance adsorbents of the present inven-<br>
tion (i.e., that is, the pore surface area formed by<br>
pores having pore diameters of more than 20 Å) is rela-<br>
tively large, because of the high meso- and macropore<br>
fraction, and is generally in the range from 200 to<br>
1000 m2/g, particularly 250 to 950 m2/g, preferably 350<br>
to 900 m2/g, more preferably 400 to 850 m2/g.<br>
In general, the carbon black method external pore sur-<br>
face area of the high-performance adsorbents of the<br>
present invention (i.e., that is, the pore surface area<br>
formed by pores having pore diameters of more than<br>
20 A) forms up to 30%, particularly up to 40%, prefera-<br><br>
bly up to 50% of the total pore surface area of the<br>
high-performance adsorbents of the present invention.<br>
More particularly, the carbon black method external<br>
pore surface area of the high-performance adsorbents of<br>
the present invention (i.e., that is, the pore surface<br>
area formed by pores having pore diameters of more than<br>
20 A) forms 10 to 50%, particularly 15 to 45%, prefera-<br>
bly 20 to 40% of the total pore surface area of the<br>
high-performance adsorbents of the present invention.<br>
In addition, the high-performance adsorbents of the<br>
present invention have an extremely high butane adsorp-<br>
tion and simultaneously an extremely high iodine num-<br>
ber, which fact characterizes their property of having<br>
excellent adsorption properties with regard to a wide<br>
variety of materials to be adsorbed.<br>
The ASTM D5742-95/00 butane adsorption of the high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention is gen-<br>
erally at least 30%, particularly at least 35%, pref-<br>
erably at least 40%. In general, the high-performance<br>
adsorbents of the present invention have an ASTM D5742-<br>
95/00 butane adsorption in the range from 30% to 80%,<br>
particularly 35 to 75% preferably 40 to 70%.<br>
The ASTM D4607-94/99 iodine number of the high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention is gen-<br>
erally at least 1250 mg/g, particularly at least<br>
1300 mg/g, preferably at least 1350 mg/g. The high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention pref-<br>
erably have an ASTM D4607-94/99 iodine number in the<br>
range from 1250 to 2100 mg/g, particularly 1300 to<br>
2000 mg/g, preferably 1350 to 1900 mg/g. The iodine<br>
number can be taken as a measure for available surface<br>
area provided by predominantly larger micropores; the<br>
aforementioned values of the iodine number of the high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention show<br>
that the high-performance adsorbents of the present in-<br>
vention simultaneously also have a high microporosity.<br><br>
Owing to their high meso- and macroporosity, the high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention simi-<br>
larly have high methylene blue and molasses adsorption<br>
numbers which together can be taken as a measure of<br>
available surface area provided predominantly by meso-<br>
and macropores. The methylene blue number or to be more<br>
precise the methylene blue adsorption, which indicates<br>
the amount of methylene blue adsorbed per defined<br>
amount of adsorbents, under defined conditions (i.e.,<br>
the number of ml of a methylene blue standard solution<br>
decolorized by a defined amount of dry and pulverized<br>
adsorbents), relates to larger micropores and predomi-<br>
nantly smaller mesopores and gives an indication of the<br>
adsorptive capacity of the high-performance adsorbents<br>
of the present invention in relation to molecules com-<br>
parable in size to methylene blue. By contrast, the mo-<br>
lasses number must be considered a measure of the meso-<br>
and macroporosity and indicates the amount of adsorb-<br>
ents which is required to decolorize a standard molas-<br>
ses solution, so that the molasses number gives an in-<br>
dication of the adsorptive capacity of the high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention in re-<br>
lation to molecules that are comparable in size to mo-<br>
lasses (generally sugar beet molasses). Together,<br>
therefore, the methylene blue and molasses numbers can<br>
be considered a measure of the meso- and macroporosity<br>
of the high-performance adsorbents of the present in-<br>
vention.<br>
The methylene blue value of the high-performance ad-<br>
sorbents of the present invention which is determined<br>
by following the method of CEFIC (Conseil Europeen des<br>
Federations des Industries Chimiques, Avenue Louise<br>
250, Bte 71, B - 1050 Brussels, November 1986, European<br>
Council of Chemical Manufacturers' Federations, Test<br>
Methods for Activated Carbons, Item 2.4 "Methylene blue<br>
value", pages 27/28) is at least 15 ml, particularly at<br>
least 17 ml, preferably at least 19 ml, and is gener-<br><br>
ally in the range from 15 to 60 ml, particularly 17 to<br>
50 ml, preferably 19 to 45 ml.<br>
The methylene blue value according to the afore-<br>
mentioned CEFIC method is thus defined as the number of<br>
ml of a methylene blue standard solution which are de-<br>
colorized by 0.1 g of dry and pulverized activated car-<br>
bon. Performing this method requires a glass vessel<br>
with ground stopper, a filter and also a methylene blue<br>
standard solution prepared as follows: 1200 mg of pure<br>
methylene blue dye (corresponding to about 1.5 g of<br>
methylene blue to DAB VI [German Pharmacopeia,<br>
6th edition] or equivalent product) are dissolved in<br>
water in a 1000 ml volumetric flask, and the solution<br>
is allowed to stand for several hours or overnight; to<br>
check its strength, 5.0 ml of the solution are diluted<br>
with 0.25% (volume fractions) acetic acid to 1.0 1 in a<br>
volumetric flask and thereafter the absorbance is meas-<br>
ured at 620 nm and 1 cm path length, and it has to be<br>
0.840 ± 0.010. If the absorbance is higher, it has to<br>
be diluted with the computed amount of water; if it is<br>
lower, the solution is discarded and made up fresh. By<br>
way of sample preparation, the high-performance adsorb-<br>
ents in the form of granular activated carbon are pul-<br>
verized (
at 150°C. Precisely 0.1 g of the spherocarbon is then<br>
combined with 25 ml (5 ml) of the methylene blue stan-<br>
dard solution in a ground glass flask (A preliminary<br>
test has to be carried out to see whether an initial<br>
addition of 25 ml of methylene blue standard solution<br>
with 5 ml additions or an initial addition of 5 ml of<br>
methylene blue standard solution with 1 ml additions<br>
can be used.). The flask is shaken until decolorization<br>
occurs. Then, a further 5 ml (1 ml) of the methylene<br>
blue standard solution are added, and the flask is<br>
shaken to the point of decolorization. The addition of<br>
methylene blue standard solution is repeated in 5 ml<br>
amounts (1 ml amounts) as long as decolorization still<br>
occurs within 5 minutes. The entire volume of the test<br><br>
solution decolorized by the sample is recorded. The<br>
test is repeated to confirm the results obtained. The<br>
volume of the methylene blue standard solution in ml<br>
which are just decolorized is the methylene blue value<br>
of the high-performance adsorbents. It is to be noted<br>
in this connection that the methylene blue dye must not<br>
be dried, since it is heat sensitive; rather, the water<br>
content must be corrected for purely arithmetically.<br>
The dimensionless molasses number can in principle be<br>
determined either by following the Norit method (Norit<br>
N.V., Amersfoort, Netherlands, Norit Standard Method<br>
NSTM 2.19 "Molasses Number (Europe)") or alternatively<br>
by following the PACS method (PACS = Professional Ana-<br>
lytical and Consulting Services Inc., Coraopolis Penn-<br>
sylvania, USA) . In the context of the present inven-<br>
tion, the values of the molasses number are determined<br>
by following the PACS method. Thus, the PACS method mo-<br>
lasses number of the high-performance adsorbents of the<br>
present invention is at least 300, particularly at<br>
least 350, preferably at least 400, and is generally in<br>
the range from 300 to 1400, particularly 350 to 1300,<br>
preferably 400 to 1250, most preferably 700 to 1200.<br>
Whether by following the Norit method or by following<br>
the PACS method, the molasses number is determined by<br>
determining the amount of pulverized high-performance<br>
adsorbents based on activated carbon that is needed to<br>
decolorize a standard molasses solution. Determination<br>
is effected photometrically, and the standard molasses<br>
solution is standardized against a standardized acti-<br>
vated carbon having a molasses number of 245 and/or<br>
350. For further details in this regard, reference can<br>
be made to the two aforementioned prescriptive methods.<br>
Despite their high porosity, particularly meso- and<br>
macroporosity, the high-performance adsorbents of the<br>
present invention have a high compressive or bursting<br>
strength (resistance to weight loading) and also an ex-<br><br>
tremely high abrasion resistance.<br>
The compressive or bursting strength (resistance to<br>
weight loading) per grain of activated carbon, in par-<br>
ticular per spherule of activated carbon, is thus at<br>
least 5 newtons, in particular at least 10 newtons and<br>
preferably at least 15 newtons. In general, the com-<br>
pressive or bursting strength (resistance to weight<br>
loading) per grain of activated carbon, particularly<br>
per spherule of activated carbon, ranges from 5 to<br>
50 newtons, in particular from 10 to 45 newtons and<br>
preferably from 15 to 40 newtons.<br>
As mentioned, the abrasion hardness of the high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention is also<br>
extremely high in that the abrasion resistance when<br>
measured by the method of CEFIC (Conseil Europeen des<br>
Federations des Industries Chimigues, Avenue Louise<br>
250, Bte 71, B - 1050 Brussels, November 1986, European<br>
Council of Chemical Manufacturers' Federations, Test<br>
Methods for Activated Carbons, Item 1.6 "Mechanical<br>
Hardness", pages 18/19) is always 100% or virtually<br>
100%. Similarly, when measured according to ASTM D3802<br>
abrasion resistances of the high-performance adsorbents<br>
of the present invention of 100% or virtually 100% are<br>
always obtained.<br>
Therefore, the applicant company has developed a modi-<br>
fied test method on the lines of this CEFIC method in<br>
order that more meaningful values may be obtained. The<br>
modified method of determination provides a better<br>
simulation of the resistance of the sample or to be<br>
more precise of the high-performance adsorbents to<br>
abrasion or attrition under near actual service condi-<br>
tions. For this purpose, the sample is exposed to stan-<br>
dardized conditions for a defined time in a horizon-<br>
tally swinging grinding cup charged with a tungsten<br>
carbide ball. The procedure adopted for this purpose is<br>
as follows: 200 g of a sample are dried for one hour at<br><br>
(120 ± 2) °C in a circulating air drying cabinet (type:<br>
Heraeus UT 6060 from Kendro GmbH, Hanau) and are subse-<br>
quently cooled down in a desiccator over drying agent<br>
to room temperature. 50 g of the dried sample are re-<br>
moved and sieved off by means of a sieving machine<br>
equipped with an analytical sieve (for example, type:<br>
AS 200 control from Retsch GmbH, Hanau) at a swing am-<br>
plitude of 1.2 mm for ten minutes through an analytical<br>
sieve, the analytical sieve being selected depending on<br>
the grain distribution of the sample to be measured<br>
(for example, analytical sieve of mesh size: 0.315 mm,<br>
diameter: 200 mm, height: 50 mm); the subsize grain is<br>
discarded. 5 ml of the nominal grain are filled into a<br>
10 ml graduated cylinder to DIN ISO 384 (volume: 10 ml,<br>
height: 90 mm) and the weight is accurately determined<br>
to 0.1 mg using an analytical balance (type: BP121S<br>
from Sartorius AG, Gottingen, weighing range: 120 g,<br>
accuracy class: E2, readability: 0.1 mg) by means of a<br>
weighing glass having a ground glass lid (volume:<br>
15 ml, diameter: 35 mm, height: 30 mm). The weighed<br>
sample is placed together with a tungsten carbide<br>
grinding ball of 20 mm diameter in a 25 ml grinding cup<br>
with screw action closure (volume: 25 ml, diameter:<br>
30 mm, length: 65 mm, material of construction: stain-<br>
less steel) and then the abrasion test is carried out<br>
by means of a swing mill (type: MM301 from Retsch GmbH,<br>
Haan, swing mill with grinding cup); the grinding cup<br>
swings in a horizontal position for one minute at a<br>
frequency of 10 Hz in the swing mill, causing the<br>
grinding ball to impact on the sample and thus create<br>
abrasion. Subsequently, the sample is sieved off by<br>
means of a sieving machine at a swing amplitude of<br>
1.2 mm for five minutes through the aforementioned ana-<br>
lytical sieve, the subsize grain again being discarded<br>
and the nominal grain, which is dependent on the grain<br>
distribution of the relevant sample (e.g. nominal grain<br>
greater than 0.315 mm), being weighed back accurately<br>
to 0.1 mg in the weighing glass with lid. The abrasion<br>
hardness is computed as a mass fraction in % by the<br><br>
following formula: abrasion hardness [%] = (100 x back-<br>
weighed weight [g])/original weight [g].<br>
According to this method of determination, modified by<br>
the applicant company by modifying the aforementioned<br>
CEFIC standard, the abrasion resistance of the high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention is at<br>
least 75%, particularly at least 80%, preferably at<br>
least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, most prefera-<br>
bly at least 95%.<br>
As stated above, it is a further special feature of the<br>
high-performance adsorbents of the present invention<br>
that they also have a certain degree of microporosity<br>
and thus also a certain micropore surface area (i.e.<br>
surface area which is formed by pores having pore di-<br>
ameters of ≤ 20 A. In general, the carbon black method<br>
micropore surface area of the high-performance adsorb-<br>
ents of the present invention which is formed by pores<br>
having pore diameters of ≤ 20 A is at least 1000 m2/g,<br>
particularly at least 1100 m2/g, preferably at least<br>
1200 m2/g, and is generally in the range from 1000 to<br>
1800 m2/g, particularly 1100 to 1600 m2/g, preferably<br>
1200 to 1500 m2/g.<br>
In general, the carbon black method micropore surface<br>
area of the high-performance adsorbents of the present<br>
invention which is formed by pores having pore diame-<br>
ters of ≤ 20 A is at least 30%, particularly at least<br>
40%, preferably at least 50% of the total pore surface<br>
area of the high-performance adsorbents of the present<br>
invention. More particularly, the carbon black method<br>
micropore surface area of the high-performance adsorb-<br>
ents of the invention which is formed by pores having<br>
pore diameters of ≤ 20 A is in the range from 50 to<br>
90%, particularly 55 to 85%, preferably 60 to 80% of<br>
the total pore surface area of the high-performance ad-<br>
sorbents of the present invention.<br><br>
Similarly, the weight- and volume-based volume Vads (N2)<br>
of the high-performance adsorbents of the present in-<br>
vention at different partial pressures p/p0 is very<br>
large:<br>
The weight-based adsorbed N2 volume VadS(Wt) of the high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention, deter-<br>
mined at a partial pressure p/po of 0.25, is at least<br>
300 cm3/g, particularly at least 350 cm3/g, preferably<br>
at least 375 cm3/g, and is particularly in the range<br>
from 300 to 800 cm3/g, preferably 350 to 700 cm3/g, more<br>
preferably 375 to 650 cm3/g.<br>
In general, the volume-based adsorbed N2 volume Vads(vol)<br>
of the high-performance adsorbents of the present in-<br>
vention, determined at a partial pressure p/po of 0.25,<br>
is at least 75 cm3/cm3, particularly at least<br>
100 cm3/cm3, and is particularly in the range from 75 to<br>
300 cm3/cm3, preferably 80 to 275 cm3/cm3, more prefera-<br>
bly 90 to 250 cm3/cm3.<br>
In general, the weight-based adsorbed N2 volume VadS(Wt)<br>
of the high-performance adsorbents of the present in-<br>
vention, determined at a partial pressure p/po of 0.995,<br>
is at least 400 cm3/g, particularly at least 450 cm3/g,<br>
and is particularly in the range from 400 to 2300 cm3/g,<br>
preferably 450 to 2200 cm3/g, more preferably 750 to<br>
2100 cm3/g.<br>
In general, the volume-based adsorbed N2 volume VadS(Vol)<br>
of the high-performance adsorbents of the present in-<br>
vention, determined at a partial pressure p/po of 0.995,<br>
is at least 200 cm3/cm3, particularly at least<br>
250 cm3/cm3, and is particularly in the range from 200<br>
to 500 cm3/cm3, preferably 250 to 400 cm3/cm3, more pref-<br>
erably 275 to 380 cm3/cm3.<br>
The high-performance adsorbents of the present inven-<br>
tion are based on granular, in particular spherical,<br><br>
activated carbon whose measure of central tendency par-<br>
ticle diameter, determined to ASTM D2862-97/04, is gen-<br>
erally in the range from 0.01 to 2.0 mm, particularly<br>
0.01 to 1.0 mm, preferably 0.05 to 0.09 mm, more pref-<br>
erably 0.1 to 0.8 mm, most preferably 0.15 to 0.7 mm.<br>
The ash content of the high-performance adsorbents of<br>
the present invention, determined to ASTM D2866-94/04,<br>
is at most 1%, particularly at most 0.8%, preferably at<br>
most 0.6%, more preferably at most 0.5%.<br>
The ASTM D2867-04/04 moisture content of the high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention is at<br>
most 1%, particularly at most 0.5%, preferably at most<br>
0.2%.<br>
The high-performance adsorbents of the present inven-<br>
tion generally have a bulk density, determined to ASTM<br>
B527-93/00, in the range from 150 to 750 g/1, particu-<br>
larly 175 to 650 g/1, preferably 200 to 600 g/1.<br>
In accordance with a particular embodiment of the pre-<br>
sent invention, the present invention provides high-<br>
performance adsorbents based on activated carbon in the<br>
form of discrete grains of activated carbon, preferably<br>
in spherical form, particularly as described above,<br>
characterized by the following parameters:<br>
•	a pore volume fraction formed by pores having pore<br>
diameters of more than 20 A which comprises at<br>
least 55% of the total pore volume of the high-<br>
performance adsorbents,<br>
•	a measure of central tendency pore diameter of<br>
more than 25 A.<br>
•	a BET surface area of at least 1250 m2/g,<br>
•	a methylene blue value of at least 15 ml, and<br><br>
• a molasses number of at least 300.<br>
The present invention further provides - in accordance<br>
with a second aspect of the present invention - the<br>
present invention process for producing the high-<br>
performance adsorbents according to the present inven-<br>
tion. In accordance with this aspect of the present in-<br>
vention, the present invention accordingly provides a<br>
process for producing the above-described high-<br>
performance adsorbents based on activated carbon, which<br>
process comprises a carbonaceous starting material be-<br>
ing initially carbonized and subsequently activated,<br>
wherein the activation is carried out in two stages,<br>
wherein the carbonized starting material is initially<br>
subjected, in a first activating step, to an activation<br>
in an atmosphere comprising water vapor, followed by a<br>
second activating step of activation in an atmosphere<br>
comprising CO2.<br>
The high-performance adsorbents of the present inven-<br>
tion are produced using carbonaceous starting materi-<br>
als, in particular sulfonated styrene-divinylbenzene<br>
copolymers, particularly sulfonated divinylbenzene-<br>
crosslinked polystyrenes, preferably in grain form,<br>
more preferably in spherical form. The divinylbenzene<br>
content of the sulfonated styrene-divinylbenzene co-<br>
polymers used as starting materials to produce the<br>
high-performance adsorbents of the present invention<br>
should particularly be in the range from 1 to 20% by<br>
weight, particularly 1 to 15% by weight, preferably 2<br>
to 10% by weight, based on the styrene-divinylbenzene<br>
copolymers. The starting copolymers can in principle be<br>
selected from the gel type or else from the macroporous<br>
type. When unsulfonated starting materials are used,<br>
the sulfonation can be carried out in situ (in particu-<br>
lar before and/or during the carbonization), particu-<br>
larly using methods known per se to one skilled in the<br>
art, preferably by means of sulfuric acid and/or oleum<br><br>
and/or SO3; this is familiar per se to one skilled in<br>
the art (cf. also the prior art described at the begin-<br>
ning) . Starting materials which have proven particu-<br>
larly advantageous are the gel-form or macroporous<br>
types of the corresponding ion exchange resins or of<br>
the corresponding unsulfonated precursors of ion ex-<br>
change resins which still have to be sulfonated.<br>
The carbonization (also known by the synonyms of pyro-<br>
lysis, burn-out or smoldering) converts the carbona-<br>
ceous starting polymers to carbon; that is, in other<br>
words, the carbonaceous starting material is carbon-<br>
ized. Carbonization of the aforementioned organic po-<br>
lymeric grains, in particular polymeric spherules,<br>
based on styrene and divinylbenzene which comprise sul-<br>
fonic acid groups leads to the detachment of the sulfo-<br>
nic acid groups during the carbonization to free radi-<br>
cals and thus to crosslinks without which there would<br>
be no pyrolysis residue (= carbon) . In general, the<br>
carbonization is carried out under an inert atmosphere<br>
(for example nitrogen) or an at most slightly oxidizing<br>
atmosphere. It can similarly be advantageous for the<br>
inert atmosphere of the carbonization, in particular if<br>
it is carried out at comparatively high temperatures<br>
(for example in the range from about 500 to 650°C) to<br>
be admixed with a minor amount of oxygen, in particular<br>
in the form of air (for example 1 to 5%) in order that<br>
an oxidation of the carbonized polymeric skeleton may<br>
be effected and the subsequent activation may thereby<br>
be facilitated. In general, the carbonization is car-<br>
ried out at temperatures of 100 to 950°C, particularly<br>
150 to 900°C, preferably 300 to 850°C. The total dura-<br>
tion of the carbonization is approximately 30 minutes<br>
to approximately 10 hours, particularly approximately 1<br>
hour to approximately 6 hours.<br>
Following the carbonization, the carbonized intermedi-<br>
ate product is subjected to an activation resulting, at<br>
the end of which, in the present invention' s high-<br><br>
performance adsorbents based on activated carbon in<br>
grain form, in particular spherical form. The basic<br>
principle of the activation is to degrade a portion of<br>
the carbon generated during the carbonization, selec-<br>
tively and specifically under suitable conditions. This<br>
gives rise to numerous pores, fissures and cracks, and<br>
the surface area per unit mass increases appreciably.<br>
Activation thus involves a specific burn-out of the<br>
carbon. Since carbon is degraded in the course of acti-<br>
vation, this operation goes hand in hand with a loss of<br>
substance which - under optimal conditions - is equiva-<br>
lent to an increase in the porosity and in the internal<br>
surface area and in the pore volume. Activation is<br>
therefore carried out under selective or to be more<br>
precise policed oxidizing conditions.<br>
The special feature of how the high-performance adsorb-<br>
ents of the present invention are produced, as well as<br>
the selection of the starting material described above,<br>
resides in the specific management of the activation<br>
process, in particular in the two-stageness of the ac-<br>
tivation process, wherein the carbonized starting mate-<br>
rial is initially subjected, in a first activating<br>
step, to an activation in an atmosphere comprising wa-<br>
ter vapor, followed by a second activating step in an<br>
atmosphere comprising CO2. As the studies carried out by<br>
the applicant have determined it is surprisingly only<br>
the separate performance of these activating steps in<br>
the aforementioned order that leads to the desired<br>
products. Reversing the order of the activating steps,<br>
or one conjointly conducted activating step in a water<br>
vapor/carbon dioxide atmosphere leads in contrast to<br>
distinctly less performance-capable products which do<br>
not have the desired properties, particularly not the<br>
high total porosity coupled with high meso-/macropore<br>
content and a relatively high absolute micropore volume<br>
and also high mechanical stability. As the studies by<br>
the applicant company have surprisingly shown when the<br>
process is carried out according to the present inven-<br><br>
tion water vapor activation leads predominantly to the<br>
formation of the micropore fraction, while carbon diox-<br>
ide activation contributes predominantly to formation<br>
of the meso- and macropores, and surprisingly the for-<br>
mation of the meso- and macropore volume is not at the<br>
expense of the micropore volume, or vice versa. What is<br>
therefore novel and surprising is in total that this<br>
produces a very large total pore volume coupled with<br>
very high stability and abrasion resistance and also<br>
very high meso- and macropore fraction coupled with si-<br>
multaneously high micropore fraction (i.e., the forma-<br>
tion of meso- and macropores to the enormous extent in<br>
the products of the present invention does not lead to<br>
a reduction in the micropore fraction, as customary in<br>
the prior art). On the contrary, a high micropore frac-<br>
tion is achieved while the meso-/macropore volume frac-<br>
tion is also high at the same time.<br>
The general procedure is for the first activating step<br>
to be carried out at temperatures of 700 to 1300°C,<br>
particularly 800 to 1200°C, preferably 850 to 950°C,<br>
and/or for a duration of 5 to 24 hours, preferably 5 to<br>
15 hours, particularly 6 to 12 hours. Usually, the du-<br>
ration of the first activation stage can be controlled<br>
as a function of the attainment of a predetermined io-<br>
dine number; for example, the first activation stage<br>
can be carried out to attainment of an iodine number of<br>
at least 1000 mg/g, particularly at least 1250 mg/g.<br>
The atmosphere of the first activation stage comprises<br>
water vapor, particularly a mixture of water va-<br>
por/inert gas, preferably a mixture of water va-<br>
por/nitrogen, or consists thereof. For the aforemen-<br>
tioned reasons, the presence of activating gases other<br>
than water vapor, particularly the presence of carbon<br>
oxides (CO2 for example), oxygen and/or ammonia, must be<br>
foreclosed in the context of the first activation<br>
stage. Good results are obtained when the throughput or<br>
to be more precise the amount used of water vapor is 25<br>
to 350 1/h, particularly 50 to 300 1/h, reckoned as wa-<br><br>
ter (i.e., liquid water at 25°C and under atmospheric<br>
pressure). Depending on the amount of starting material<br>
to be activated (= carbonisate previously produced by<br>
carbonization) , the amount used or the mass-based<br>
throughput of water vapor should advantageously be 0.01<br>
to 50 l/(h.kg), particularly 0.02 to 25 l/(h.kg), pref-<br>
erably 0.02 to 5 l/(h.kg), reckoned as water (i.e.,<br>
liquid water at 25°C and under atmospheric pressure)<br>
and based on starting material to be activated with wa-<br>
ter vapor.<br>
The general procedure for the second activating step is<br>
for the second activating step to be carried out at<br>
temperatures of 700 to 1300°C, particularly 800 to<br>
1200°C, preferably 850 to 950°C, and/or for a duration<br>
of 1 to 10 hours, particularly 3 to 8 hours. The atmos-<br>
phere of the second activation stage comprises CO2, par-<br>
ticularly pure CO2 or a mixture of CO2/inert gas, par-<br>
ticularly a mixture of CO2/nitrogen, or consists<br>
thereof, and pure carbon dioxide is particularly pre-<br>
ferred. For the aforementioned reasons, the presence of<br>
activating gases other than CO2, in particular the pres-<br>
ence of water vapor, must be foreclosed in the context<br>
of the second activation stage. Good results are ob-<br>
tained when the throughput or the amount used of CO2 is<br>
10 to 250 m3/h, particularly 20 to 200 m3/h (based on<br>
pure CO2) . Depending on the amount of starting material<br>
to be activated, the amount used or the mass-based<br>
throughput of CO2 should advantageously be 0.001 to<br>
100 m3/(h-kg), particularly 0.01 to 50 m3/(h.kg), pref-<br>
erably 0.05 to 10 m3/(h.kg), reckoned as pure gaseous<br>
CO2 under activating conditions, particularly at the re-<br>
spective pressure and the respective temperature, which<br>
are selected for the activation, and based on starting<br>
material to be activated with CO2.<br>
The process is typically carried out such that the<br>
first and second activation stages merge into each<br>
other (for example by changing the activating atmos-<br><br>
phere within the same apparatus).<br>
What is surprising is in particular that, first, the<br>
way the activation is carried out according to the pre-<br>
sent invention provides exact control of the porosity<br>
with regard to the micro-, meso- and macropore frac-<br>
tions and, secondly, that an extremely high abrasion<br>
resistance and mechanical compressive strength result<br>
despite the high porosity coupled with simultaneously<br>
high meso- and macroporosity and also good microporos-<br>
ity. It was unforeseeable that this approach selec-<br>
tively generates high meso- and macroporosity coupled<br>
with simultaneously sufficient microporosity.<br>
Porosity can be adjusted or controlled to specific val-<br>
ues by varying the previously specified activating con-<br>
ditions. The high-performance adsorbents of the present<br>
invention can thus be custom tailored so to speak.<br>
High-performance adsorbents based on activated carbon<br>
which combine high meso- and macroporosity with good<br>
microporosity and also high stability and abrasion re-<br>
sistance are not known from the prior art. Another wel-<br>
come aspect is the excellent adsorption behavior to<br>
molecules of virtually any desired molecular size due<br>
to the presence of all kinds of pores in relatively<br>
large amounts or fractions. Similarly welcome is the<br>
excellent impregnatability of the products of the pre-<br>
sent invention with catalysts or to be more precise<br>
metals or metal salts.<br>
The graphs in figure 1 and figure 2 show N2 adsorption<br>
isotherms for two different high-performance adsorbents<br>
of the present invention, which were produced under<br>
different activating conditions. The physical-chemical<br>
properties of the two high-performance adsorbents of<br>
the present invention are also summarized in Table 1<br>
below. For comparison, a commercially available acti-<br>
vated carbon from Kureha is also listed therein with<br>
the physical-chemical properties in question.<br><br>
The data reported in Table 1 show the superiority of<br>
the high-performance adsorbents of the present inven-<br>
tion over a prior art activated carbon: The combination<br>
of high total porosity with high meso-/macropore volume<br>
fraction at high BET surface area and also good abso-<br>
lute microporosity, high mechanical durability and ex-<br>
cellent adsorption properties is in this combination -<br>
as well as the other physical-chemical parameters -<br>
only to be found in the high-performance adsorbents of<br>
the present invention. The present invention thus makes<br>
it possible to produce high-performance adsorbents<br>
based on activated carbon in grain form, in particular<br>
spherical form, which are superior to commercially<br>
available products.<br>
The inventive high-performance adsorbents "activated<br>
carbon I" and "activated carbon II" recited in Table 1<br>
are each produced as follows: commercially available<br>
dried ion exchanger precursors based on divinylbenzene-<br>
crosslinked polystyrene copolymers having a divinyl-<br>
benzene content of about 4% are sulfonated in a conven-<br>
tional manner at temperatures of 100°C to 150°C using a<br>
sulfuric acid/oleum mixture. This is followed in a con-<br>
ventional manner by carbonization at temperatures up to<br>
850°C for four hours under nitrogen and subsequently<br>
the induction of activation. Inventive activated carbon<br>
I	was produced by performing the first activation stage<br>
("water vapor activation") for a duration of about 8.5<br>
hours at about 900°C with a water vapor throughput of<br>
about 100 m3/h and the second activation stage ("carbon<br>
dioxide activation") for a duration of about 8.0 hours<br>
at about 900°C with a carbon dioxide throughput of<br>
about 35 m3/h; in contrast, inventive activated carbon<br>
II	was produced by performing the first activation<br>
stage ("water vapor activation") for a duration of<br>
about 10.5 hours at about 925°C with a water vapor<br>
throughput of about 125 m3/h and the second activation<br>
stage ("carbon dioxide activation") for a duration of<br><br>
about 8 hours at about 925°C with a carbon dioxide<br>
throughput of about 40 m3/h. After cooling down to room<br>
temperature, the inventive products recited in Table 1<br>
are obtained.<br>
The present invention further provides - in accordance<br>
with a third aspect of the present invention - the pre-<br>
sent invention use of the high-performance adsorbents<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
The high-performance adsorbents of the present inven-<br>
tion are particularly useful for the adsorption of tox-<br>
ins, noxiants and odors, for example from gas or to be<br>
more precise air streams. The high-performance adsorb-<br>
ents of the present invention are further useful for<br>
purifying and cleaning gases, particularly for purify-<br>
ing air, and also liquids, such as, in particular, wa-<br>
ter (for example drinking water treatment). More par-<br>
ticularly, the high-performance adsorbents of the pre-<br>
sent invention are useful for impregnation (for example<br>
with catalysts or to be more precise metals or metal<br>
salts).<br>
The high-performance adsorbents of the present inven-<br>
tion are also useful for example for or in the food in-<br>
dustry, particularly for preparing and/or decolorizing<br>
food products.<br>
The high-performance adsorbents of the present inven-<br>
tion can further be used in adsorptive filtering mate-<br>
rials or to be more precise in the manufacture of ad-<br>
sorptive filtering materials. Such adsorptive filtering<br>
materials are useful in the manufacture of protective<br>
apparel in particular, for example protective suits,<br>
protective gloves, protective underwear, protective<br>
footwear, etc., in particular for the civilian or mili-<br>
tary sector (for example NBC protection).<br>
The high-performance adsorbents of the present inven-<br><br>
tion are further useful in the sector of medicine or<br>
pharmacy, particularly as a medicament or medicament<br>
constituent.<br>
The high-performance adsorbents of the present inven-<br>
tion can finally also be used as sorptive storage media<br>
for gases and liquids.<br>
Owing to their high total porosity coupled with high<br>
meso- and macroporosity and similarly a certain degree<br>
of microporosity and also excellent mechanical stabil-<br>
ity with excellent adsorptive properties, the high-<br>
performance adsorbents of the present invention are<br>
distinctly superior to comparable adsorbents of the<br>
prior art.<br>
Further embodiments, modifications and variations of<br>
the present invention are readily discernible and real-<br>
izable for those skilled in the art on reading the de-<br>
scription without their having to leave the realm of<br>
the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
