				<td>The present invention relates to a connector of the movable member type.<br>
The present invention relates to a connector having a movable or operable member assisting or performing a connection with a mating connector, in particular to a lever-type connector.<br>
A lever-type connector is known e.g. from Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-326024. This connector is constructed such that a gate-shaped lever comprised of an operable portion and a pair of arm portions is rotatably mounted to straddle one connector housing, cam pins engageable with cam grooves of the lever are provided on the other connector housing, and the lever is rotated with the cam grooves and the cam pins engaged with each other by lightly fitting the both connector housings to each other, thereby pulling the both connector housings toward each other by the cam action of the engagement of the cam grooves and the cam pins to reach a properly connected state.<br>
There are cases where the central axis of rotation of the lever is set at a position displaced toward one side from the widthwise center in order to ensure a large rotation stroke of the lever. Some of lever-type connectors are provided with a lever supported at one side by deleting one of the both arm portion and, in such cases, the central axis of rotation of the lever is set only on either one of the upper and bottom surfaces of the connector housing.<br>
In the case where the central axis of rotation of the lever is set at a position displaced from the center of the connector housing with respect to width direction or height direction in this way, a connecting force acts in such a manner skewed toward the position displaced from the center as the lever is rotated, with the result that the both connector housings may be inclined from proper connecting postures.<br>
A further lever-type connector is known from Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-30961. This connector is constructed such that a gate-shaped lever comprised of an-operable portion and a pair of arm portions is rotatably mounted to straddle a connector housing, cam pins engageable with cam grooves of the lever are provided on a mating connector housing, and the lever is rotated with the cam grooves and the cam pins engaged with each other by lightly fitting the both connector housings to each other, thereby pulling the both connector housings toward each other by the cam action of the engagement of the cam grooves and the cam pins to reach a properly connected state.<br>
Terminal insertion holes through which terminal fittings are inserted are formed in the rear end surface of the connector housing, and cavities communicating with the terminal insertion holes for accommodating the terminal fittings are formed to penetrate the connector housing. The lever is mounted such that the operable portion and the like thereof project from the rear end surface of the connector housing.<br>
In the case of inserting the terminal fittings into the cavities by means of an automatic machine, if there is a step on the rear end surface of the connector housing, there is a likelihood that the automatic machine temporarily<br><br>
stops when the front end of the terminal fitting comes into contact with this step, thereby deteriorating operation efficiency. Particularly, in a lever-type connector as above, there is problem of a difficult terminal fitting inserting operation by an automatic machine since a lever is mounted such that parts thereof project from the rear end surface of a connector housing.<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above problem and an object thereof is to improve the overall operability of the connector.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a connector of the movable or operable member type, comprising:<br>
a connector housing connectable with a mating connector housing, and a  movable  member (such  as  a  rotatable  or pivotable  lever or a substantially linearly displaceable slider) operably or movably or displaceably mounted on or in the connector housing and including a cam plate formed with a cam groove,<br>
a cam pin provided in the mating connector housing being displaced substantially along the cam groove to connect or separate the connector housing and the mating connector housing as the movable member is displaced between an initial position and a connection ending position,<br>
wherein, in addition to at an engaged position of the cam groove and the cam pin, the movable member and the mating connector housing are engaged at a position substantially symmetrical to the engaged position with respect to the widthwise central axis of the both connector housings or at a position<br><br>
substantially symmetrical to the engaged position with respect to the heightwise central axis of the both connector housings, thereby setting at least two positions to produce forces substantially in directions to connect the both connector housings by the mutual engagement when a connecting operation of the both connector housings is completed.<br>
Accordingly, the operability of the connector can be increased particularly by correcting the posture of the housing relative to the mating housing of the mating connector.<br>
Generally, in the connector having an operable or movable member, when the movable member is operated with the cam member engaged with the mating cam member, the connector housings are connected by connecting forces (forces acting in directions to connect the both connector housings) acting between them. However, it may be difficult to balance the above connecting forces between the both connector housings e.g. if the cam plate is asymmetrically positioned. In other words, e.g. the connection of the side, where the e.g. only cam plate is provided, with the mating connector housing precedes and, conversely, the connection of the opposite side where the cam plate is not provided delays, wherefore the both connector housings may be connected in such postures inclined with respect to the heightwise central axis. Further, if the engaged position of the cam member and the mating cam member is displaced with respect to the width direction of the both connector housings, the both connector housings may be connected in such postures inclined with respect to the widthwise central axis.<br>
On this point, according to the invention, another engaged position is provided upon completing the connecting operation in addition to the engaged<br><br>
position of the cam member and the mating cam member, so that the connecting forces may be substantially balanced with respect to the width direction or height direction of the both connector housings. Thus, the postures of the both connector housings can be corrected into substantially straight connecting postures therefore allowing a smoother connection and improving overall operability.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the cam plate being arranged only on one surface of the connector housing.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the ...-invention, there is further provided a lever-type connector:<br>
a connector housing connectable with a mating connector housing, and<br>
a lever rotatably mounted on the connector housing and including a cam plate formed with a cam groove,<br>
a cam pin provided in the mating connector housing being displaced along the cam groove to connect or separate the both connector housings as the lever is rotated from an initial position to a connection ending position, and the cam plate being arranged only on one surface of the connector housing,<br>
wherein, in addition to at an engaged position of the cam groove and the cam pin, the lever and the mating connector housing are engaged at a position symmetrical to the engaged position with respect to the widthwise central axis of the both connector housings or at a position symmetrical to the engaged position with respect to the heightwise central axis of the both connector housings, thereby setting at least two positions to produce forces in directions to connect the both connector housings by the mutual engagement when a connecting operation of the both connector housings is completed.<br><br>
Generally, in the lever-type connector, when the lever is rotated with the cam pin engaged with the cam groove, the connector housings are connected by connecting forces (forces acting in directions to connect the both connector housings) acting between them. However, it is difficult to balance the above connecting forces between the both connector housings if the cam plate is arranged only on one surface of the connector housing as in claim 1. In other words, the connection of the side, where the cam plate is provided, with the mating connector housing precedes and, conversely, the connection of the opposite side where the cam plate is not provided delays, wherefore the both connector housings may be connected in such postures inclined with respect to the heightwise central axis. Further, if the engaged position of the cam pin and the cam groove is displaced with respect to the width direction of the both connector housings, the both connector housings may be connected in such postures inclined with respect to the widthwise central axis.<br>
On this point, according to the above embodiment, another engaged position is provided upon completing the connecting operation in addition to the engaged position of the cam groove and the cam pin, so that the connecting forces are balanced with respect to the width direction or height direction of the both connector housings. Thus, the postures of the both connector housings can be corrected into straight connecting postures thus improving operability.<br>
Preferably, the movable member comprises at least one posture correcting arm which is to be arranged rotatably and substantially concentrically with the cam plate on a surface of the connector housing substantially opposite to the one, where the cam plate is to be provided, with respect to the height direction of the connector housing, and<br><br>
the movable member preferably includes the posture correcting arm, the cam plate and an operation arm connecting the posture correcting arm and the cam plate and used to rotate the movable member.<br>
Further preferably, the posture correcting arm is formed with at least one hooking portion for producing forces substantially in directions to pull the both connector housings toward each other by being engaged with a respective receiving portion provided in the mating connector housing when the connecting operation of the both connector housings is being or is completed.<br>
Most preferably, a posture correcting arm is arranged rotatably and concentrically with the cam plate on a surface of the connector housing opposite to the one, where the cam plate is provide, with respect to the height direction of the connector housing,<br>
the lever includes the posture correcting arm, the cam plate and an operation arm connecting the posture correcting arm and the cam plate and used to rotate the lever, and<br>
the posture correcting arm is formed with a hooking portion for producing forces in directions to pull the both connector housings toward each other by being engaged with a receiving portion provided in the mating connector housing when the connecting operation of the both connector housings is completed.<br>
Accordingly, even if the connection of the both connector housings precedes at the side where the cam plate is provided, forces are produced in directions to connect the both connector housings by the engagement of the hooking portion of the posture correcting arm and the receiving portion at the position substantially symmetrical to the engaged position of the cam member<br><br>
(e.g. cam pin) and the mating cam member (e.g. the cam groove) with respect to the heightwise central axis of the both connector housings when the connecting operation of the two both connector housings is completed. Thus, the connecting forces act in a well-balanced manner at the substantially opposite sides of the heightwise central axis of the both connector housings, with the result that the connection proceeds at the delayed side and the postures of the both connector housings are corrected into substantially straight connecting postures therefore allowing a smoother connection process of the connector with a mating connector and improving overall operabiNty of the connector.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the movable member is arranged such that the engaged position of the cam groove with the cam pin is displaced toward one side from the widthwise central axis of the both connector housings and an operation arm used to operate the movable member is provided at an opposite side with respect to the widthwise central axis, and<br>
the movable member is formed with a pushing surface for pushing the connector housing provided with the movable member into the mating connector housing when the connecting operation of the both connector housings is completed.<br>
Preferably, the lever is arranged such that the engaged position of the cam groove with the cam pin is displaced toward one side from the widthwise central axis of the both connector housings and an operation arm used to rotate the lever is provided at an opposite side with respect to the widthwise central axis, and<br><br>
the lever is formed with a pushing surface for pushing the connector housing provided with the lever into the mating connector housing when the connecting operation of the both connector housings is completed.<br>
Accordingly, since the engaged position of the cam member (e.g. cam pin) and the mating cam member (e.g. cam groove) is displaced to one side from the widthwise central axis of the both connector housings, the connector housing provided with the lever is connected faster with the mating connector housing at this engaged side in some cases. However, upon completing the connecting operation, the pushing surface of-the operation arm of the movable member (e.g. lever) pushes the connector housing into the mating connector housing at the widthwise side opposite to the engaged position of the cam member (e.g. cam pin) and the mating cam member (e.g. cam groove), wherefore the postures of the both connector housings are corrected into substantially straight connecting postures.<br>
Further preferably, the connector housing includes a cam-plate accommodating wall, an accommodating space for movably at least partly accommodating the cam plate being defined between the cam-plate accommodating wall and an outer surface of the connector housing, and<br>
the cam-plate accommodating wall preferably is formed with a cam-pin introducing groove at a position displaced toward one side from the widthwise central axis of the both connector housings and with a guide groove, into which a lock projection provided in the mating connector housing is to be guidably at least partly introduced, at a position displaced toward the substantially opposite side, the cam-pin introducing groove and the guide groove extending substantially in connecting directions of the both connector housings.<br><br>
Still further preferably, a locking piece resiliency deformed along the thickness direction of the cam plate is provided at a position of the cam plate substantially facing the guide groove, and is engageable with the lock projection when the connecting operation of the both connector housings is completed.<br>
Most preferably, the connector housing includes a cam-plate accommodating wall, an accommodating space for rotatably accommodating the cam plate being defined between the cam-plate accommodating wall and an outer surface of the connector housing,<br>
the cam-plate accommodating wall is formed with a cam-pin introducing groove at a position displaced toward one side from the widthwise central axis of the both connector housings and with a guide groove, into which a lock projection provided in the mating connector housing is guidably introduced, at a position displaced toward the opposite side, the cam-pin introducing groove and the guide groove extending in connecting directions of the both connector housings, and<br>
a locking piece resiliency deformed along the thickness direction of the cam plate is provided at a position of the cam plate facing the guide groove, and is engageable with the lock projection when the connecting operation of the both connector housings is completed.<br>
Since the engaged position of the cam member (e.g. cam pin) and the mating cam member (e.g. cam groove) is displaced to one side from the widthwise central axis of the both connector housings, the connector housing provided with the movable member (e.g. lever) may be connected faster with the mating connector housing at this engaged side in some cases. However, according to the above embodiment, since the lock projection is guided by the<br><br>
guide groove at the widthwise side opposite to the above engaged position, the connecting posture of the connector housing can be held in a substantially proper posture, and the locking piece is engaged with the lock projection of the mating connector housing to lock the both connector housings in their connected state when the connecting operation is completed.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a connector of the movable or operable member type, in particular according to the above invention or a preferred embodiment thereof, comprising:<br>
a connector housing connectable with a mating connector housing and   . formed in the rear end surface thereof with at least one terminal insertion opening through which at least one terminal fitting is to be at least partly inserted substantially from behind, and<br>
a movable member (such as a rotatable or pivotable lever or a substantially linearly displaceable slider) operably or movably or displaceably mounted on or in the connector housing and formed with a cam member,<br>
a mating cam member provided in the mating connector housing being cooperable with the cam member to connect or separate the both connector housings as the movable member is operated,<br>
wherein the movable member is to be kept in the connector housing with the rear end surface of the movable member held substantially flush with that of the connector housing at least at an connection ending position.<br>
It is difficult to at least partly insert the terminal fitting into the cavity by an automatic machine if the rear end surface of the lever projects from or is retracted from the rear end surface of the connector housing, thus decreasing the overall operability of the connector. However, according to the invention,<br><br>
since the movable member can be kept in the connector housing with the rear end surface of the movable member held substantially flush with the rear end surface of the connector housing, the terminal inserting operation particularly by the automatic machine can be smoothly performed, thus increasing the overall operability of the connector.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a lever-type connector, a lever-type connector, comprising:<br>
a connector housing connectable with a mating connector housing and formed in the rear end surface thereof with a terminal insertion opening through which a terminal fitting is inserted from behind, and<br>
a lever rotatably mounted on the connector housing and formed with a cam groove,<br>
a cam pin provided in the mating connector housing being displaced along the cam groove to connect or separate the both connector housings as the lever is rotated,<br>
wherein the lever is kept in the connector housing with the rear end surface of the lever held flush with that of the connector housing.<br>
It is difficult to insert the terminal fitting into the cavity by an automatic machine if the rear end surface of the lever projects from or is retracted from the rear end surface of the connector housing. However, according to the above embodiment, since the lever is kept in the connector housing with the rear end surface of the lever held flush with the rear end surface of the connector housing, the terminal inserting operation by the automatic machine can be smoothly performed.<br><br>
Preferably, the rear end surface of the movable member (preferably lever) becomes substantially flush with that of the connector housing when the movable member (preferably lever) substantially reaches a connection ending position.<br>
Since the lever reaches the connection ending position when the rear end surface of the movable member (lever) becomes substantially flush with and continuous with that of the connector housing, it can be detected that the movable member (lever) has reached the connection ending position and the both connector housings have been properly connected by confirming the flush state of the movable member (lever).<br>
Preferably, the movable member (preferably lever) is provided with a side plate (particularly including the central axis of rotation of the movable member or lever) and arranged to cover at least part of an outer side surface of the connector housing,<br>
the connector housing is formed with at least one cavity into which the terminal fitting is to be at least partly inserted through the terminal insertion opening,<br>
a retainer movable between a first position or partial locking position where the insertion and withdrawal of the terminal fitting into and from the cavity are permitted and a second position or full locking position, preferably attained by being pushed or displaced from the first position or partial locking position, where the terminal fitting substantially properly inserted into the cavity is retained is mounted through the outer side surface of the connector housing where the side plate is arranged,<br><br>
a pushing surface of the retainer projects from the outer side surface of the connector housing at the first position or partial locking position, and<br>
either one of the inner side surface of the side plate and the pushing surface of the retainer is formed with an escaping recess for avoiding the mutual interference of the movable member (particularly lever) and the retainer when the retainer is at the first position or partial locking position.<br>
Further, since the side plate of the movable member (lever) is arranged on the outer side surface of the connector housing to at least partly cover the part of this outer side surface and the retainer is mounted, the retainer and the side plate may interfere with each other to hinder the displacements thereof at the first position or partial locking position where the retainer projects from the outer side surface of the connector housing. However, since the escaping recess for avoiding the mutual interference of the retainer and the movable member (lever) when the retainer is located at the first position or partial locking position is formed in either one of the inner side surface of the side plate and the pushing surface of the retainer according to the above embodiment, the retainer and the lever can be displaced without any hindrance. The interference of the retainer and the side plate can be avoided if the side plate of the movable member (lever) is arranged at a distance from the retainer in a connecting direction. However, such an arrangement causes the movable member (lever) to project from the rear end surface of the connector housing, whereby the rear end surfaces of the lever and the connector housing cannot be substantially flush with and continuous with each other. In the above embodiment, however, such a problem is solved and overall operability is improved.<br><br>
The invention according to claim 4 is characterized in that, in the lever-type connector according to claim 3, the movement or operation of the movable member, particularly the rotation of the lever, is prevented by the contact of the side plate and the retainer in a movement direction (rotating direction) unless the retainer is at the second position or full locking position.<br>
Since the movement or operation of the movable member, particularly the rotation of the lever, is prevented by the contact of the posture correcting arm and the retainer unless the retainer is located at the second position or full locking position, -it can-be detected that the retainer is left at an intermediate position without reaching the second position or full locking position by being insufficiently pushed if the movement or operation of the movable member, particularly the rotation of the lever is prevented.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a connector assembly comprising a connector according to the above invention or a preferred embodiment thereof and a mating connector being connectable therewith.<br>

One or more, preferably a plurality of tab-shaped male terminal fittings 99 at least partly project in the receptacle 81, and are mounted by being passed through or at least partly arranged in a back wall 84 of the receptacle 81. A portion of each male terminal fitting 99 projecting out from the receptacle 81 through the back wall 84 is bent down at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at right angle at an intermediate position and has the bottom end or connection portion thereof to be electrically connected or connectable with a conductor path of an electric or electronic device such an unillustrated printed circuit board. One or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) protection walls 85 project substantially backward at or near the<br><br>
rear ends of the (preferably substantially opposite) side wall(s) of the receptacle 81 to at least partly protect exposed portions of the respective male terminal fittings 99 from the outer lateral side(s).<br>
The back wall 84 of the receptacle 81 is formed with one or more projecting pieces 86 for preventing the both connector housings 10, 80 from being erroneously assembled. The projecting pieces 86 at least partly project into the receptacle 81 at positions displaced from the respective widthwise central axes WCA of the respective fitting recesses 83. One or more, preferably a plurality of short canceling pieces 87 for canceling shorted states of shorting terminals 70 provided in the female connector housing 10 as the both connector housings 10, 80 are connected are formed to at least partly project into the receptacle 81 from the back wall 84 of the receptacle 81.<br>
One or more, preferably a pair of contact terminals 98 arranged on one side of a group of male terminal fittings 99 located at a first (preferably upper) stage of those arranged at a plurality of (e.g. three) stages, preferably substantially having the same shape as the male terminal fittings 99 located at the first (upper) stage and preferably having the front end positions thereof substantially aligned with those of the respective male terminal fittings 99 project into teach fitting recess 83. The respective contact terminals 98 are electrically connected or connectable with a detecting terminal 60 provided in the female connector housing 10 as the both connector housings 10, 80 are properly connected, thereby forming at least part of a detecting circuit.<br>
On or at the inner surface of the upper wall of the receptacle 81, one or more cam pins 88 engageable with one or more respective cam grooves 41 of levers 40 (as preferred movable or operable members) to be assembled with<br><br>
the or at least partly in female connector housings 10 project at positions displaced transversely outward from the respective widthwise central axes WCA of the respective fitting recesses 83, and one or more lock projections 89 resiliency engageable with one or more respective locking pieces 42 of the levers 40 project at positions displaced toward the partition wall 82 from the respective widthwise central axes WCA of the respective fitting recesses 83.<br>
On the inner surface of the lateral (preferably bottom) wall of the receptacle 81, one or more receiving portions 91 engageable with one or more respective hooking portions 43 of the levers 40 to correct the postures of .the . both connector housings 10, 80 being connected project at front end positions of the receptacle 81 displaced transversely outward from the widthwise central axes WCA of the respective fitting recesses 83. Further, one or more disengaging projections 92 preferably substantially in the form of vertical plates extending substantially in forward and backward directions FBD project at positions of the inner surface of the lateral (preferably upper) wall of the receptacle 81 displaced transversely outward from the widthwise central axes WCA of the respective fitting recesses 83.<br>
Two or more female connector housings 10 similarly made e.g. of a synthetic resin are prepared substantially in correspondence with the respective (both) fitting recesses 83, and preferably each of them is provided with a housing main body 11, a retainer 93 and the lever 40 (as the preferred movable member) as shown in FIGS. 1 and 18. It should be noted that the shown female connector housing 10 is the one at least partly accommodated into one fitting recess 83 of the male connector housing 80 and preferably is substantially<br><br>
transversely  symmetrical  with   respect  to  the  one  to  be  at  least  partly accommodated into the other fitting recess 83.<br>
The housing main body 11 preferably is substantially in the form of a block as a whole, and formed with one or more, preferably a plurality of cavities 12 extending substantially in forward and backward directions FED at positions substantially corresponding to the mating male terminal fittings 99 as shown in FIGS. 19 and 21. In other words, the housing main body 11 is substantially in the form of a block as a whole, has terminal insertion openings formed in the rear end surface thereof, and is formed -with a plurality of cavities 12 substantially communicating with the terminal insertion holes and extending in forward and backward directions at positions corresponding to the mating male terminal fittings 99 as shown in FIGS. 19 and 21. A female terminal fitting 97 to be connected with an end of a wire W is at least partly inserted into each cavity 12 from an inserting side, preferably substantially from behind, and is resiliency locked to be retained there by a locking projection 13 projecting at the inner surface of the cavity 12 after being properly inserted.<br>
A projecting-piece receiving portion 14 for receiving the projecting piece 86 of the male connector housing 80 at the time of connecting the both connector housings 10, 80 is formed preferably substantially in the form of a recess in the front surface of the housing main body 11, and the at least partial insertion of the projecting piece 86 into the projecting-piece receiving portion 14 prevents an upside-down connection of the both connector housings 10, 80.<br>
One or more snorting-terminal accommodating portions 15 for at least partly accommodating the shorting terminals 70 are so formed in or at the front surface of the housing main body 11 as to substantially communicate with the<br><br>
cavities 12 located adjacent thereto or therebelow or inward thereof. Each shorting terminal 70 to be at least partly accommodated into the shorting-terminal accommodating portion 15 preferably includes at least one pair of resilient pieces 71 to be brought into contact with at least one pair of female terminal fittings 97 arranged preferably substantially side by side in the cavities 12 located therebelow or inward thereof to short these female terminal fittings 97 as shown in FIG. 1 until a connecting operation of the both connector housings 10, 80 is started and/or terminated. As shown in FIG. 2, the short canceling pieces 87 of the male connector housing 80.resiliency deform the corresponding resilient pieces 71 of the shorting terminals 70 in a short-canceling direction, whereby the shorted state of the two or more (or pairs of) the female terminal fittings 97 can be canceled.<br>
A detecting-terminal accommodating portion 16 is formed at or near one lateral end of the housing main body 11. The detecting-terminal accommodating portion 16 is substantially arranged adjacent to and/or in parallel with the group of cavities 12 for the female terminal fittings 97 located at the first (upper) level, and the detecting terminals 60 can be at least partly accommodated thereinto preferably substantially from behind.<br>
The detecting terminal 60 is formed by bending an electrically conductive (preferably metal) plate into a specified (predetermined or predeterminable). shape and is comprised of a base plate 61 to be arranged substantially along the inner surface of the detecting-terminal accommodating portion 16, one or more first spring portions 62 extending substantially backward with an upward or outward inclination (or inclined to a connecting direction CD) from the front end of the base plate 61, a second spring portion 63 extending substantially<br><br>
backward with an upward or outward inclination (or inclined to a connecting direction CD) from the rear end of the base plate 61, and opposite side walls 64 standing up or projecting substantially along the opposite side edges of the base plate 61 as shown in FIGS. 1, 25 and 26. Specifically, a pair of first spring portions 62 are arranged substantially side by side substantially in width direction WD on the base plate 61, and formed preferably by making such a cutout in the base plate 61 as to leave a substantially U-shaped piece and bending the left projecting pieces, and have contact portions 65 with the contact terminals 98 formed to project at positions near or at the base ends thereof. Accordingly, both first spring portions 62 are connectable with the corresponding contact terminals 98, and substantially individually undergo resilient deformations, thereby avoiding a situation where the first spring . portions 62 are brought out of alignment with the corresponding contact terminals 98. On the other hand, the second spring portion 63 preferably has a single-spring structure by folding or bending a rear part of the base plate 61 forward, and the front end thereof is arranged to at least partly cover the rear ends of both first spring portions 62 laterally or substantially from above.<br>
An outward- or upward-projecting pressable portion 66 to be pressed by a pressing portion 44 and a pre-pressing portion 45 (to be described later) is formed at an intermediate position (along the forward and backward directions FED and/or connecting direction CD) of the second spring portion 63. Specifically, the pressable portion 66 has a slant obliquely inclined upward or outward toward the front preferably after extending substantially vertically at the base end of the second spring portion 63, and extends substantially vertically downward after extending a short distance substantially horizontally from the<br><br>
front end of the slant. By operating or rotating the lever 40, the pressing portion 44 and the pre-pressing portion 45 of the lever 40 come into sliding contact with the pressable portion 60 while making a displacement movement (preferably while making an arcuate movement along a rotational path of the lever 40), thereby resiliency deforming the pressing portion 66 in a deformation direction DD (substantially inward or downward). As the pressable portion 66 is displaced, the first spring portions 62 are also resiliency deformed substantially inwardly or downward (refer e.g. to FIG. 3).<br>
One or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and right) excessive deformation preventing pieces 67 for preventing an excessive deformation of the second spring portion 63 are formed by making one or more cutouts in the (preferably substantially opposite) side wall(s) 64 and bending the cut portion(s) substantially inward. One or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and right) lock projections 68 engageable with the inner surface(s) of the detecting-terminal accommodating portion 16 is/are formed at the lateral (upper) end(s) of the (preferably substantially opposite) side wall(s) 64. Further, one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and right) spring pressing pieces 69 (spring pressing portions) for pressing the (preferably substantially opposite) side edge(s) of the second spring portion 63 from above is/are formed by being bent inward at the lateral (upper) end(s) of the (preferably substantially opposite) side wall(s) 64. The second spring portion 63 is pressed while being loaded beforehand in such a manner as to press both spring pressing pieces 69 substantially upward or outward, wherefore preferably it is not necessary to strictly adjust a spring reaction force.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 11, the housing main body 11 is formed with a retainer mount hole 17 extending preferably over three surfaces, i.e. the bottom surface and the opposite side surfaces of the housing main body 11. This retainer mount hole 17 has such a depth as to vertically cross and communicate with the respective cavities 12 at the one or more (e.g. three) stages, and full locking projections 19 and partial locking projections 18 for holding the retainer 93 at a partial locking position and a full locking position are formed one above the other on the opposite side surfaces located at an upper part of the retainer mount hole 17 in the housing main body 11 as shown in FIG, 21.<br>
As shown in FIG. 23, the retainer 93 includes a main frame 95 formed with one or more, preferably a plurality of windows 94 that can substantially communicate with the respective one or more cavities 12, and one or more latching projections 94A for latching the one or more female terminal fittings 97 are formed on the inner surfaces of the windows 94. A stepped portion 95A is formed preferably by cutting off one of the four corners of the main frame 95, the surrounding wall of the detecting-terminal accommodating portion 16 preferably is at least partly fitted at the inner side of the stepped portion 95A. One or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and right) locking arms 95E substantially projecting upward or outward are resiliency deformably formed at or near the (preferably substantially opposite) lateral end(s) (particularly excluding the stepped portion 95A) of the main frame 95. A locking claw 95F projecting inward is formed at the leading end of each locking arm 95E.<br>
The retainer 93 is movable between the partial locking position (or first or standby position) where the retainer 93 is partly inserted in the retainer mount hole 17 while the bottom end thereof is projecting from the lateral (bottom)<br><br>
surface of the housing main body 11 and the locking claws 95F of the locking arms 95E are resiliency engaged with the partial locking projections 18 and the full locking position (or second or mounted position) which is attached by being pressed deeper into the retainer mount hole 17 and where the bottom end of the retainer 93 preferably is substantially flush with the lateral (bottom) surface of the housing main body 11 and the locking claws 95F of the locking arms 95E are resiliency engaged with the full locking projections 19. The latching projections 94A are located at lateral sides of the cavities 12 to permit the insertion and withdrawal of the female terminal fittings 97 at the partial locking position, whereas the latching projections 94A are at least partly located in the cavities 12 to lock and retain the female terminal fittings 97 substantially properly inserted in the cavities 12 preferably together with the locking portions 13 at the full locking position. Further, as shown in FIGS. 15 and 22, an escaping recess 96 for avoiding interference with a posture correcting arm 46 (corresponding to a preferred side plate) of the lever 40 is formed in the lateral (bottom) surface (press-in surface 93A) of the retainer 93. A lateral (bottom) part of the posture correcting arm 46 is at least partly fitted in the escaping recess 96 when the retainer 93 is located at the partial locking position.<br>
As shown in FIG. 21, an accommodating space 21 for at least partly accommodating the lever 40 is so formed at or in a lateral (preferably upper) part of the housing main body 11 as to make an opening towards an inserting side, preferably substantially in the rear surface. The accommodating space 21 preferably is defined between a (preferably substantially thin) covering wall 22 (as a preferred cam-plate accommodating wall) located at the outermost (preferably uppermost) position and a lever mounting surface 23 substantially<br><br>
opposed thereto. The lever 40 is mounted by being slid (preferably in a substantially horizontal posture) at least partly into the accommodating space 21 from the inserting side, preferably substantially from behind. The aforementioned detecting-terminal accommodating portion 16 communicates with the accommodating space 21 via a through hole 24 penetrating the lever mounting surface 23.<br>
The escaping recess 96 may be formed by being cut in substantially conformity with the shape of the lateral edge of the posture correcting arm 46. When an attempt is made to operate (e.g. rotate) the lever 40, the posture correcting arm 46 comes substantially into contact with the inner surface of the escaping recess 96 to prevent any further movement or operation (e.g. rotation) of the lever 40. When the bottom surface of the retainer 93 projects from the bottom surface of the housing main body 11, i.e. when the retainer 93 is not located at the full locking position, the movement or operation (e.g. rotation) of the lever 40 is prevented by the contact of the posture correcting arm 46 with the inner surface of the escaping recess 96.<br>
A (preferably substantially cylindrical) supporting shaft 25 for rotatably or pivotably supporting the lever 40 projects preferably from the lever mounting surface 23. Alternatively or additionally, the supporting shaft may also be provided projecting from the covering wall 22. In the process of mounting the lever 40, a cam plate 47 of the lever 40 moves over or beyond the supporting shaft 25 while resiliency deforming the covering wall 22 and, therefore, the supporting shaft 25 is at least partly fitted to or into a bearing portion 47A of the cam plate 47 to retain the lever 40 in the accommodating space 21 simultaneously when the lever 40 reaches a proper mount position. The<br><br>
supporting shaft 25 preferably is set at a position displaced from the widthwise central axis of the housing main body 11 and/or a central axis thereof with respect to forward and backward directions FBD (depth direction). A cam-plate engaging portion 26 projects at a position adjacent to the supporting shaft 25 preferably on the lever mounting surface 23, and is engageable with an engaging recess 47B formed in the cam plate 47 preferably to hold the lever 40 substantially at a connection starting position CSP and/or a connection ending position CEP.<br>
On the lateral (bottom) surface 11BS of the housing main body 1.1, a supporting shaft 27 engaged with a bearing portion 46A of the posture correcting arm 46 of the lever 40 to preferably support the lever 40 at two positions in cooperation with the supporting shaft 25 projects at a position on the substantially same vertical axis as the supporting shaft 25. One or more retaining projections 27A (preferably projecting in substantially opposite directions) are formed at or near the leading end of the supporting shaft 27, so that the posture correcting arm 46 does not come off the supporting shaft 27 during the rotating movement of the lever 40. One or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and right) adjusting projections 28 are formed at the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise ends of the bottom surface 11BS of the housing main body 11 at a sides of the retainer mount hole 17 substantially opposite to the supporting shaft 27 with respect to forward and backward directions FBD. The (preferably both) adjusting projections 28 preferably project substantially the same distance as the supporting shaft 27 so that the leading ends thereof are substantially aligned with that of the supporting shaft 27, thereby preventing the female connector housing 10 from being connected<br><br>
while leaning forward in the process of connecting the both connector housings 10,80.<br>
As shown in FIG. 20, a cam-pin introducing groove 22A which extends substantially in forward and backward directions FBD and makes an opening at the front end and through which a cam pin 88 of the male connector housing 80 is introduced is formed in the covering wall 22 preferably at a position immediately before the supporting shaft 25 with respect to forward and backward directions FBD. Further, a guide groove 22B which likewise extends substantially in forward and backward directions FBD and makes an opening at the front end and along which the lock projection 89 of the male connector housing 80 is at least partly introduced is formed in the covering wall 22 preferably at a position displaced toward a side opposite to the cam-pin introducing groove 22A. The cam pin 88 is introduced while being held substantially in sliding contact with the (preferably substantially opposite) teteral edge(s) of the cam-pin introducing groove 22A, whereas the lock projection 89 is introduced while being held substantially in sliding contact with the (preferably substantially opposite) lateral edge(s) of the guide groove 22B. Further, a guiding groove 22E along which the disengaging projection 92 of the male connector housing 80 is introduced while being held substantially in sliding contact is formed in the covering wall 22 substantially in parallel with the guide grooves 22B and the cam-pin introducing groove 22A at a side opposite to the guide groove 22B.<br>
The lever mounting surface 23 and the covering wall 22 preferably are partly cut out to expose one side (left side in the shown example) of the accommodating space 21 at the rear surface of the housing main body 11, and<br><br>
this exposed space serves as a protecting-portion accommodating space 21A for at least partly accommodating a protecting portion 48 of the lever 40 preferably substantially in the form of a rectangular frame. Further, a stepped portion 29 substantially vertically extending and/or substantially facing the accommodating space 21 at its lateral (upper) side is formed in one side surface of the housing main body 11 as shown in FIG. 21, and an area before this stepped portion 29 serves as a stepped recess 29B shown in FIG. 7 slightly lower than a rear area. A stepped surface of the stepped portion 29 substantially facing forward serves as a contact surface 29A to be pressed by an operation arm 49 of the lever 40 when the lever 40 is rotated or pivoted to the connection ending position CEP.<br>
As shown in FIG. 18, the lever 40 preferably is comprised of the (at least one) cam plate 47, the posture correcting arm 46 and preferably the operation arm 49 coupling the ends or end portions of the cam plate 47 and the arm 46, thereby preferably substantially being gate-shaped as a whole. As shown in FIG. 7, the cam groove 41 engageable with the cam pin 88 of the male connector housing 80 extends in a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) direction at an end portion of the cam plate 47 distanced from the operation arm 49, and the both connector housings 10, 80 can be connected and separated by relative movements of the cam pin 88 along the cam groove 41. It should be noted that such a cam groove 41 preferably is not formed in the posture correcting arm 46. In the following description on the construction of the lever 40, reference is made to a state where the lever 40 is located at the connection ending position CEP (state shown in FIG. 10) concerning forward and backward directions FED.<br><br>
The inner surface (lower surface) of the cam plate 47 is cut at a position near the inner end of the cam groove 41 to form the (preferably substantially round) bearing portion 47A. The engaging recess 47B in the form of an arc substantially concentric with the bearing portion 47A is formed at a position near the bearing portion 47A, and the cam-plate engaging portion 26 comes substantially into sliding contact with this engaging recess 47B to guide the rotation or pivotal movement of the lever 40.<br>
A temporarily holding arm 51 resiliency deformable and preferably extending substantially in forward and backward directions FBD when the lever 40 is at the connection ending position CEP is formed at a position of the outer periphery of the cam plate 47 near the entrance of the cam groove 41. Before the both connector housings 10, 80 are connected, a tip projection 51A of the temporarily holding arm 51 is engaged with a temporarily receiving portion 31 provided at a lateral edge of the accommodating space 21 of the housing main body 11, thereby preventing the movement or rotation of the lever 40. When or shortly after a connecting operation of the both connector housings 10, 80 is started, the tip projection 51A is pushed by the disengaging projection 92 of the male connector housing 80 to be resiliency deformed in unlocking direction, whereby the rotation of the lever 40 is permitted.<br>
The locking piece 42 resiliency engageable with the lock projection 89 of the male connector housing 80 is formed at an end (preferably side of the operation arm 49) of the cam plate 47 substantially opposite to the one where the cam groove 41 and the bearing portion 47A are arranged. The locking piece 42 preferably is defined between a pair of slits 42A making openings at the rear end of the cam plate 47 and extending substantially in the width direction of the<br><br>
cam plate 47, i.e. forward and backward directions FBD, and is resiliency deformable laterally (substantially upward and downward) with the front end thereof as a base end. One of these two slits 42A is located near a slanted edge portion 47E formed by cutting off one corner of the cam plate 47 and cannot be extended any further forward.<br>
In an area of the outer surface (upper surface) of the cam plate 47 before the locking piece 42 is formed an escaping portion 52 in the form of a recess for avoiding the interference with the lock projection 89 during the movement or rotation of the lever 40 to enable the further movement or rotation of the lever 40. A locking projection 53 substantially continuous with the rear end of the escaping portion 52 with a step is formed at the base end of the locking piece 42. The front surface of the locking projection 53 forming the above step is formed into a slanted guiding surface 53A sloped outward (up) toward the back as shown in FIG. 1, and the upper surface of the locking projection 53 is formed into a substantially flat surface substantially at the same height or radial position as the general reference surface of the cam plate 47. Further, the rear surface of the locking projection 53 is formed into a locking surface 53B being preferably substantially vertical (or normal to the forward and backward directions FBD and/or the connecting direction CD) forming a step to a recess 54 formed behind the locking projection 53. During the rotation of the lever 40, the lock projection 89 moves onto the locking projection 53 along the guiding surface 53A of the locking projection 53, thereby resiliency deforming the locking piece 42 substantially inward or downward. When the lever 40 substantially reaches the connection ending position CEP after the lock projection 89 comes substantially into sliding contact with the flat surface of the<br><br>
locking projection 53, the lock projection 89 is at least partly fitted into the recess 54 and so locked by the locking surface 53B of the locking projection 53 as not to come out.<br>
A locking-piece operating portion 55 is set at a slightly higher position at the rear end of the locking piece 42. The locking piece 42 can be disengaged from the lock projection 89 by pressing this portion 55 inwardly or down. The protecting portion 48 (preferably substantially in the form of a rectangular frame) is so formed at or near the rear end of the cam plate 47 as to at least partly, preferably substantially entirely surround -the circumference of the locking-piece operating portion 55, which can be operated to disengage the locking piece 42 through the inside of this protecting portion 48. The protecting portion 48 has one side thereof joined with the operation arm 49 to laterally or vertically bulge out from the rear end of the cam plate 47, and is (preferably substantially entirely) accommodated into the protecting-portion accommodating space 21A of the housing main body 11 when the lever 40 is at the connection ending position CEP.<br>
Further, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 24, the pressing portion 44 projects along one lateral edge of the base end of the locking piece 42 on the inner surface (lower surface) of the cam plate 47. The pressing portion 44 comes substantially into contact with the pressable portion 66 of the second spring portion 63 of the detecting terminal 60 preferably substantially from behind when the locking piece 42 is resiliency deformed inwardly or downward due to the engagement of the lock projection 89 and the locking projection 53 at a rotation final position before or near the connection ending position CEP of the lever 40, whereby the second spring portion 63 is resiliency deformed<br><br>
downward or inwardly together with the first spring portions 62. At the substantially same time as the lever 40 reaches the connection ending position CEP, the pressing portion 44 preferably stops pressing the second spring portion 63 to resiliency at least partly restore the second spring portion 63 and the first spring portions 62. The front end of the pressing portion 44 stands substantially vertically (or normal to the forward and backward directions FBD and/or the connecting direction CD) and the bottom end thereof is a slant sloped up or outwardly toward the back. The slant of the pressing portion 44 is substantially horizontally held when the locking piece 42 is maximally resiliency deformed.<br>
On the inner surface of the cam plate 47, the pre-pressing portion 45 separate from the pressing portion 44 is formed to project at a position right before the locking piece 42 and slightly displaced inward in width direction from the pressing portion 44. Similar to the pressing portion 44, the pre-pressing portion 45 extends in forward and backward directions FBD and preferably has a shorter dimension in forward and backward directions FBD than the pressing portion 44. This pre-pressing portion 45 comes substantially into contact with the pressable portion 66 (preferably substantially from behind) to resiliency deform the second spring portion 63 and the first spring portions 62 before the pressing portion 44 presses the pressable portion 66 of the detecting terminal 60 during the rotation of the lever 40. As the lever 40 is further moved or operated or rotated or pivoted, the pre-pressing portion 45 moves over the pressable portion 66. When the pre-pressing portion 45 stops pressing the second spring portion 63, the pressing portion 44 presses the pressable portion 66 of the second spring portion 63 instead of the pre-pressing portion 45. A<br><br>
bottom part of the front end of the pre-pressing portion 45 is formed into a slant sloped down toward the back, and the bottom end thereof preferably is formed into a substantially horizontal flat surface (or surface substantially parallel to the forward and backward directions FED and/or the connecting direction CD). Since the pre-pressing portion 45 is formed in such a range unaffected by the resilient deformation of the locking piece 42 and is distanced from the pressing portion 44, the interference of the rear end of the pre-pressing portion 45 and the front end of the pressing portion 44 can be avoided while the locking piece 42-is resiliency deformed.<br>
Here, as the lever 40 is operated (rotated or pivoted), the contact terminals 98 at least partly enter the detecting terminal 60. However, since the first spring portions 62 are pressed together with the second spring portion 63 by the pre-pressing portion 45 and successively by the pressing portion 44 to lower the contact portions 65 of the first spring portions 62 during the rotation of the lever 40, the contact terminal 98 and the contact portions 65 of the first spring portions 62 are so held as not to touch each other. On the other hand, when the lever 40 substantially reaches the connection ending position CEP, the pressing portion 44 stops pressing the second spring portion 63, with the result that the second spring portion 63 is resiliency at least partly restored together with the first spring portions 62 to bring the contact terminals 98 and the contact portions 65 of the first spring portion 62 into contact, thereby closing a detecting circuit.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, the operation arm 49 of the lever 40 preferably is substantially in the form of a long plate extending in height direction. When the lever 40 substantially reaches the connection ending position CEP, the<br><br>
operation arm 49 is at least partly fitted into the stepped recess 29B of the housing main body 11 and the front end thereof is pressed against the contact surface 29A of the housing main body 11 substantially in height direction, thereby pressing the contact surface 29A forward, i.e. in a connecting direction CD. The front end of the operation arm 49 functions as a pushing surface 49A to prevent the both connector housings 10, 80 from being connected in inclined postures.<br>
As shown in FIG. 24, the posture correcting arm 46 of the lever 40 is arranged at such a position substantially facing the cam plate 47 with the housing main body 11 at least partly located therebetween, and has a width shorter than the cam plate 47 so as to avoid the interference with the retainer 93. The bearing portion 46A penetrates the posture correcting arm 46 in thickness direction at a position substantially coaxial with the bearing portion 47A of the cam plate 47 with respect to vertical direction VD. One or more escaping grooves 46B into which the one or more retaining projections 27A are at least partly fitted and one or more engaging edges 46E engageable with the retaining projections 27A in a detaching direction of the lever 40 are formed at the inner edge of the bearing portion 46A of the posture correcting arm 46.<br>
A hooking portion 43 having a hooking surface 43A extending in a direction at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to a rotating direction of the lever 40 is formed at the leading end (end distanced from the operation arm 49) of the posture correcting arm 46. In the case where the both connector housings 10, 80 are connected while being inclined from their proper postures with respect to width direction WD, the hooking portion 43 is engaged with the receiving portion 91 of the male connector housing 80 with<br><br>
the hooking surface 43A thereof substantially opposed to the rear surface of the receiving portion 91 immediately before the lever 40 reaches the connection ending position CEP. Further, in the process of the lever 40 reaching the connection ending position CEP, the hooking portion 43 pulls or urges the receiving portion 91 to substantially correct the postures of the both connector housings 10, 80 being connected.<br>
The lever 40 preferably is so arranged as to project from the rear surface of the housing main body 11 by locating the operation arm 49 more backward than the rear surface of the housing main body 11 at the connection starting position CSP as shown in FIGS. 7 and 20, whereas the rear end surface of the lever 40 preferably is substantially flush with that of the housing main body 11 to preferably form no step to the rear end surface of the housing main body 11 at the connection ending position CEP as shown in FIGS. 10 and 16. Accordingly, whether or not the both connector housings 10, 80 have been properly connected preferably can be judged by confirming whether or not the rear end surfaces of the lever 40 and the housing main body 11 are substantially flush with each other at the connecting ending position CEP.<br>
Next, functions of this embodiment are described. First, the male connector housing 80 is fixed to the outer surface of the electric or electronic device (such as a circuit board, a junction box, an electric or electronic appliance or device, etc.) while establishing an electrical connection between the male terminal fittings 99 and conductor paths of the electric or electronic device, and is kept on standby until the start of the connecting operation with the female connector housing 10.<br><br>
On the other hand, in the female connector housing 10, the retainer 93 preferably is at least partly inserted into the retainer mount hole 17 of the housing and held at the partial locking position (first or standby position). In this state, the cam plate 47 of the lever 40 is slid at least partly into the accommodating space 21 of the housing main body 11, and the bearing portion 47A of the cam plate 47 is engaged with the supporting shaft 25 while the bearing portion 46A of the posture correcting arm 46 is engaged with the supporting shaft 27 at the opposite side, whereby the lever 40 is mounted in the housing main body 11 preferably while being kept at the connection ending position CEP. At this time, the posture correcting arm 46 of the lever 40 and the retainer 93 are in such a positional relationship as to at least partly overlap in thickness direction, but the mutual interference thereof is avoided by the at least partial entrance of part of the posture correcting arm 46 into the escaping recess 96 of the retainer 93.<br>
Subsequently, the above female connector housing 10 is transported to an assembling site of the female terminal fittings 97. At the assembling site, the one or more female terminal fittings 97 are at least partly inserted into the cavities 12 of the housing main body 11 from the inserting side, preferably substantially from behind, e.g. by hand or an automatic machine. In this case, since there is no step between the rear end of the lever 40 and that of the housing main body 11, the female terminal fittings 97 can be smoothly inserted. After all the female terminal fittings 97 are at least partly inserted, the retainer 93 is pushed towards or to the full locking position (second position or mounted position) to (preferably doubly) lock the female terminal fittings 97 (preferably in cooperation with the locking portions 13). Since the retainer 93 does not project<br><br>
out of the housing main body 11 by being pushed to the full locking position, the operation or movement (e.g. rotation) of the lever 40 is permitted. It should be noted that the shorting terminals 70 and the detecting terminal 60 are also assembled into the housing main body 11 together with the female terminal fittings 97.<br>
Subsequently, as shown in FIGS. 7 and 20, the lever 40 is operated (preferably rotated or pivoted) towards or to the connection starting position CSP, the tip projection 51A of the temporarily holding arm 51 preferably is engaged with the temporarily receiving portion 31 of the housing main body 11, and the entrance of the cam groove 41 and that of the cam-pin introducing groove 22A of the housing main body 11 are caused to substantially communicate in lateral or vertical direction. In this state, the one or more corresponding female connector housings 10 are lightly fitted into both fitting recesses 83 of the receptacle 81 of the male connector housing 80 held in the standby state. Then, as shown in FIG. 8, each disengaging projection 92 thrusts itself between the temporarily holding arm 51 and the temporarily receiving portion 31 to disengage them from each other, and the cam pin 88 at least partly enters the cam-pin introducing groove 22A and the cam groove 41, and the lock projection 89 enters the guide groove 22B.<br>
When the lever 40 is operated (rotated or pivoted) in a direction of arrow X shown in FIG. 8 e.g. by holding or manipulating or operating the operation arm 49 in this state, the cam pin 88 moves substantially along the cam-pin introducing groove 22A, the lock projection 89 moves along the guide groove 22B and the short canceling pieces 87 at least partly thrust themselves between the resilient pieces 71 of the shorting terminals 70 and the female<br><br>
terminal fittings 97 held in contact with these resilient pieces 71 at an initial stage of the operation (e.g. rotation) of the lever 40 as shown in FIG. 2, thereby canceling the shorted state. Further, at the initial state of the operation (e.g. rotation) of the lever 40, the pre-pressing portion 45 comes substantially into contact with the pressable portion 66 of the detecting terminal 60 preferably substantially from behind, and preferably both slants of the pre-pressing portion 45 and the pressable portion 66 slide on each other substantially in the connecting direction CD of the both connector housings 10, 80, thereby resiliency deforming the second spring portion 63. As the front end of the second spring portion 63 is inclined, the first spring portions 62 are deformed in the deforming direction DD (pressed substantially down or inwardly), whereby the height of the contact portions 65 of the first spring portions 62 becomes lower than that of the corresponding contact terminals 98 as shown in FIG. 3. In this way, at an early stage of the entrance of the contact terminals 98 into the detecting terminal 60, the first spring portions 62 are deformed in the deforming direction DD (pressed substantially down or inwardly) and the contact terminals 98 are at least partly inserted to the back side of the detecting terminal 60 while being separated from the contact portion 65.<br>
As the lever 40 is further operated (preferably rotated or pivoted), the locking projection 53 of the locking piece 42 moves onto the lock projection 89 as shown in FIG. 4, and the locking piece 42 is resiliency deformed downward or inwardly, with the result that the pre-pressing portion 45 moves away from the pressable portion 66 and the front end of the pressing portion 44 presses the pressable portion 66 down or inwardly instead of the pre-pressing portion 45. Since the second spring portion 63 is kept resiliency deformed in the<br><br>
meantime, the contact portions 65 of the first spring portions 62 and the contact terminals 98 are kept separated without raising the height positions of the contact portions 65 of the first spring portions 62. As shown in FIGS. 5 and 9, in the process of the locking projection 53 passing the lock projection 89, the slant of the pressing portion 44 slides substantially on the pressable portion 66 while substantially making an arcuate movement along the rotational path of the lever 40, whereby the second spring portion 63 and the first spring portions 62 are kept resiliency deformed (in the deformation direction DD).<br>
When the lever 40 substantially reaches the connection ending position CEP to cause the locking projection 53 of the locking piece 42 to move substantially over the lock projection 89 as shown in FIG. 6, the locking piece 42 is restored towards or to its initial natural state and the pressing portion 44 moves away from the pressable portion 66 to substantially stop pressing, with the result that the second spring portions 63 and the first spring portions 62 are restored towards or to their initial natural states. Then, the height positions of the contact portions 65 of the first spring portions 62 are raised to push the contact terminals 98 from below (in a direction substantially opposite to the deforming direction DD) and to establish an electrical connection therebetween, thereby closing the detecting circuit. By electrically detecting a signal resulting from the connection of the contact terminals 98 and the detecting terminal 60, it can be known that the lever 40 has reached the connection ending position CEP and the both connector housings 10, 80 have been properly connected. Of course, a specified circuit may be constructed by establishing an electrical connection between the male and female terminal fittings 99, 97.<br><br>
When the lever 40 substantially reaches the connection ending position CEP, the cam plate 47 is at least partly accommodated into the accommodating space 21 of the housing main body 11, the protecting portion 48 is at least partly accommodated in the protecting-portion accommodating space 21 A, and the operation arm 49 is at least partly fitted into the stepped recess 29B of the housing main body 11. Then, as shown in FIGS. 10 and 16, the rear end of the lever 40 and that of the housing main body 11 preferably are substantially flush with each other, thereby particularly eliminating a step. The arrival of the lever 40 at the connection ending position CEP can also be known by confirming this positional relationship.<br>
In this embodiment, the central axis of rotation of the lever 40 preferably is set at a position displaced in width direction WD, and an engaging area of the cam groove 41 and the cam pin 88 is set only in the cam plate 47 of the lever 40 as shown in FIG. 12. Thus, a connecting force of the lever 40 acts in such a manner skewed to the central axis of rotation and the engaging area of the cam groove 41 and the cam pin 88, wherefore there is a likelihood that the connecting operation proceeds faster at this side while being delayed at a side away from the central axis and opposite to the engaging area of the cam groove 41 and the cam pin 88.<br>
However, in this embodiment, even if the both connector housings 10, 80 are inclined from their proper connecting postures with respect to vertical direction VD, the hooking portion 43 of the lever 40 hooks or engages the receiving portion 91 and urges or pulls it as shown in FIG. 15 preferably substantially immediately before the lever 40 reaches the connection ending position CEP. In this way, the connecting operation at the side of the posture<br><br>
correcting arm 46, which is apt to delay, is caused to proceed faster. Therefore, the postures of the both connector housings 10, 80 are corrected to substantially proper connecting postures when the lever 40 reaches the connection ending position CEP.<br>
Further, even if the both connector housings 10, 80 are inclined from their substantially proper connecting postures with respect to width direction WD, the pushing surface 49A of the operation arm 49 of the lever 40 comes substantially into contact with the contact surface 29A of the housing main body 11 and preferably pushes it toward the receptacle 81 immediately before the lever 40 reaches the connection ending position CEP as shown in FIG. 13. In this way, the connecting operation at the end away from the central axis, which is apt to delay, is caused to proceed faster. Therefore, the postures of the both connector housings 10, 80 are corrected to substantially proper connecting postures when the lever 40 reaches the connection ending position.<br>
While the both connector housings 10, 80 are being connected, the lock projection 89 moves preferably while being held substantially in sliding contact with the guide groove 22B of the housing main body 11 and the cam pin 88 likewise moves while preferably being held substantially in sliding contact with the cam-pin introducing groove 22A of the housing main body 11. While these are moving, the connecting operation of the both connector housings 10, 80 is guided, whereby the inclination of the postures of the both connector housings 10, 80 can be prevented. Further, when the lever 40 reaches the connection ending position CEP, the lock projection 89 is positioned and/or held at least partly between the back end of the guide groove 22B of the covering portion 22 of the housing main body 11 and the locking projection 53 of the locking piece<br><br>
42 of the lever 40 as shown in FIG. 14. Thus, with the locked state of the lever 40, it can be known that the both connector housings 10, 80 are in their proper connecting postures.<br>
Generally, in the lever-type connector, when the lever 40 is operated (preferably rotated or pivoted) with the cam pin 88 engaged with the cam groove 41, the connector housings 10, 80 are connected by connecting forces (forces acting in directions to connect the both connector housings 10, 80) acting between them. However, it is difficult to balance the above connecting forces between the both connector housings 10, 80 particularly if the cam plate . 47 is arranged only on one surface of the female connector housing 10 as in this embodiment. In other words, the connection of the side, where the cam plate 47 is provided, with the male connector housing 80 precedes and, conversely, the connection of the opposite side where the cam plate 47 is not provided delays, wherefore the both connector housings 10, 80 may be connected in such postures inclined with respect to the heightwise central axis. Further, if the engaged position of the cam pin 88 and the cam groove 41 is displaced with respect to the width direction WD of the both connector housings 10, 80, the both connector housings 10, 80 may be connected in such postures inclined with respect to the widthwise central axis.<br>
On this point, according to this embodiment, another engaged position is provided upon completing the connecting operation in addition to the engaged position of the cam groove 41 and the cam pin 88, so that the connecting forces are balanced with respect to the width direction and/or height direction of the both connector housings 10, 80. Thus, the postures of the both connector<br><br>
housings   10,  80  can  be  corrected  into  substantially  straight  connecting postures.<br>
More specifically, even if the connection of the both connector housings 10, 80 precedes at the side where the cam plate 47 is provided as described above, forces may be produced in directions to connect the both connector housings 10, 80 by the engagement of the hooking portion 43 of the posture correcting arm 46 and the receiving portion 91 at a position substantially symmetrical to the engaged position of the cam pin 88 and the cam groove 41 with respect to the heightwise central axis of the both connector housings 10, 80 when the connecting operation of the two both connector housings 10, 80 is completed. Thus, the connecting forces act in a substantially well-balanced manner at the opposite sides of the heightwise central axis of the both connector housings 10, 80, with the result that the connection proceeds at the delayed side and the postures of the both connector housings 10, 80 are corrected into substantially straight connecting postures.<br>
Since the engaged position of the cam pin 88 and the cam groove 41 preferably is displaced to one side from the widthwise central axis of the both connector housings 10, 80, the female connector housing 10 provided with the lever 40 is connected faster with the male connector housing 80 at this engaged side in some cases. However, upon completing the connecting operation, the pushing surface 49A of the operation arm 49 of the lever 40 pushes the female connector housing 10 into the male connector housing 80 at the widthwise side substantially opposite to the engaged position of the cam pin 88 and the cam groove 41, wherefore the postures of the both connector<br><br>
housings   10,  80  may be  corrected  into  substantially straight connecting postures, if necessary.<br>
Further, since the engaged position of the cam pin 88 and the cam groove 41 preferably is displaced to one side from the widthwise central axis of the both connector housings 10, 80, the female connector housing 10 provided with the lever 40 may be connected faster with the male connector housing 80 at this engaged side in some cases. Particularly, since the lock projection 89 is guided by the guide groove 22B at the widthwise side substantially opposite to the above engaged position, the connecting posture of the female connector housing 10 is held in a substantially proper posture, and the locking piece 42 is engaged with the lock projection 89 of the male connector housing 80 to lock the both connector housings 10, 80 in their connected state when the connecting operation is completed.<br>
Accordingly, to correct connecting postures of both connector housings, a an operable member (such as a lever 40) is movable or operably (preferably rotatably or pivotably) mounted on a female connector housing 10 and includes at least one cam plate 47 formed with at least one cam groove 41, and this cam plate 47 preferably is arranged only on or at one surface (or position) of the female connector housing 10. In addition to an engaged position of a cam groove 41 and a cam pin 88, a position is set between the lever 40 and a male connector housing 80 to produce forces substantially in directions to pull or urge the both connector housings 10, 80 toward each other by the engagement of a hooking or engagement portion 43 provided at a posture correcting arm 46 located at a position substantially facing the cam plate 47 in the lever 40 and a receiving portion 91 provided in the male connector housing 80.<br><br>
Furthermore, as described above, it may be difficult to insert the female terminal fittings 97 into the cavities 12 e.g. by an automatic machine if the rear end surface of the lever 40 (as the preferred movable member) projects from or is retracted from the rear end surface of the female connector housing 10. However, according to this embodiment, since the lever 40 is kept in the female connector housing 10 with the rear end surface of the lever 40 preferably held substantially flush with the rear end surface of the female connector housing 10, the terminal inserting operation by the automatic machine can be smoothly performed. Of course, a manual operation of inserting the terminal fittings can also be more smoothly performed, thus improving operability.<br>
Since the lever 40 reaches the connection ending position CEP when the rear end surface of the lever 40 becomes substantially flush with and/or substantially continuous with that of the female connector housing 10, it can be detected (e.g. visually or by a suitable detector) that the lever 40 has reached the connection ending position CEP and the both connector housings 10, 80 have been properly connected by confirming the substantially flush state of the lever 40.<br>
Further, since the posture correcting arm 46 of the lever 40 is arranged on the lateral (bottom) surface of the female connector housing 10 to cover at least part of this, lateral (bottom) surface and the retainer is mounted, the retainer 93 and the posture correcting arm 46 may interfere with each other to hinder the displacements thereof at the partial locking position (first position) where the retainer 93 projects from the outer side surface of the female connector housing 10. However, since the escaping recess 96 for avoiding the mutual interference of the retainer 93 and the lever 40 when the retainer 93 is<br><br>
located at the partial locking position (first position) is formed in the pushing surface 93A of the retainer 93 according to this embodiment, the displacements of the retainer 93 and the lever 40 are not hindered.<br>
Furthermore, since the operation or movement or displacement (e.g. rotation) of the lever 40 preferably is prevented by the contact of the posture correcting arm 46 and the retainer 93 unless the retainer 93 is located at the full locking position (second position), it can be detected that the retainer 93 is left at an intermediate position without reaching the full locking position (second position) by being insufficiently pushed if the,rotation of the lever .40 is, prevented.<br>
Accordingly, to improve operability of a connector by smoothly performing a terminal fitting inserting operation (e.g. by an automatic machine or manually), one or more terminal insertion holes through which one or more female terminal fittings 97 are inserted preferably substantially from behind are formed in the rear end surface of a female connector housing 10. A lever 40 (as a preferred movable member) formed with a cam groove 41 is operably (preferably rotatably or pivotably) mounted on the female connector housing 10. The lever 40 is kept in the female connector housing 10 with the rear end surface of the lever 40 held substantially flush with that of the female connector housing 10. Accordingly, a terminal inserting operation (e.g. by an automatic machine) can be smoothly performed since there is no unevenness between the rear end surface of the female connector housing 10 and that of the lever 40. <other embodiments><br><br>
