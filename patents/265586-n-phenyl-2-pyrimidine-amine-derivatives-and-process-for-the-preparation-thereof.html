Experiment 5<br>
Comparative oharmacokinetic test in white rats<br>
On the previous day to the test, white rats (Sprague-Dawley, 250~280g, male) were put under anesthesia by pentobarbital sodium (50tng/kg, I.P.). Then, cannula (polyethylene tube; diameter: 0.58mm) was introduced into the rats via the carotid artery and jugular vein, and drawn out to the back. After the operation, the rats were fasted for 16 hours and used for the test. Blood was collected in 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours from the carotid artery. The samples for HPLC analysis were prepared using the collected blood according to the following procedure and were analyzed under the following conditions.<br>
Preparation of the samples for HPLC analysis<br>
Blood was collected by an amount of 0.8mÂ£ at each prearranged time and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 7 minutes to separate 300/iK of plasma. In order to remove proteins, MeOH was added in an amount of 600/^1, twice as much as the amount of plasma, and the mixture was shaken for 30 minutes. The mixture was centrifuged again at 15,000 rpm for 5 minutes to give protein free supernatant, which was then analyzed by HPLC.<br>
HPLC analysis conditions of Example 5<br>
Flow rate: 1.0 nrf/min, UV detection at 267 nm<br>
Column: 4.6 x 150 mm, 5C18-AR-II, COSMOSIL<br>
Eluent: Mixture of ion pair sample (420mÂ£) and MeOH (580mÂ£)<br>
Ion pair sample: 7.5g of 1-octanesulfonic acid was dissolved in 800m4<br>
of water. The resulting mixture was adjusted to pH 2.5 using phosphoric acid<br>
and diluted with water to 1000mA volume.<br>
HPLC analysis conditions of Example 8<br>
Flow rate: 1.5 md/min, UV detection at 271 ran<br>
Column: 4.6 I.D. x 250 mm, Capcell Pak Phenyl UG120<br>
Eluent: Acetonitrile : 0.2% Formic acid in water (75 : 25)<br>
When Imatinib mesylate and the compounds of Examples 5 and 8 were administered per oral to the white rats in a dosage of lOOmg/kg, respectively, it was confirmed by the HPLC analysis that Cmax (maximum blood concentration) and AUC (area under the curve of time-blood concentration) of the compound of Example 5 were about 4 times and 5 times, respectively as much as those of Imatinib raesylate. In addition, it was confirmed by the HPLC analysis that Cmax and AUC of the compound of Example 8 were about 1.5 times and 3 times, respectively as much as those of Imatinib mesylate. Here, the pharmacokinetic parameters are Tmax (time to reach the maximum blood concentration), Cmax (maximum blood concentration), and AUC (area under the curve of time-blood concentration), and the AUC was calculated under trapezoid rule (see Table 5 and Figure 1). [Table 5]<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As shown in the above Table 5, although the concentration of administration of Examples 5 and 8 is the same as that of Imatinib mesylate, it was identified that their pharmacokinetic parameters of Tmax, Cmax, and AUC are higher than those of Imatinib mesylate (Table 5 and Figure 1). On the basis of these results, it may be concluded that the compounds of Examples 5 and 8 exhibit the same effect as Imatinib mesylate when they are clinically applied at about half lower daily dosage than that of Imatinib mesylate. Therefore, the compound of the present invention has a superior therapeutic effect and various advantages in cost, etc., and also can be<br>
formulated into an oral dosage form (tablet or capsule) or an injection form when industrially manufactured.<br>
Experiment 6<br>
Acute toxicitv test in mice (oral administration)<br>
In order to determine the acute toxicity of the compound of the present invention when the compound is orally administered, mice (ICR, 24-26g) were fasted for 16 hours. One group consists of 10 males and 10 females. The first group is the control group and 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was administered per oral to this group. The compounds of Examples 5 and 8 were orally administered in a dosage of 2,000mg/kg, the maximum dosage in acute toxicity test, to each test group. After the administration, clinical conditions of the mice were observed for 14 days and weight change<br>
was also measured. On the last day of the test, 14 day from the start, the mice were subjected to an autopsy in order to examine changes of the internal organs. During the period of observation, neither abnormal response nor specific autopsy result was observed. Also, the body weights of the test groups do not show any change with statistical significance when compared with the control group. Further, since no mouse died during the test period, it was confirmed that the compounds of Examples 5 and 8 have LDjo of<br>
2,000mg/kg or more. This means that the compounds of the present invention including those of Examples 5 and 8 are safe in the aspect of acute toxicity.<br>
Acute toxicitv test in rat (oral administration)<br>
In this test, the acute toxicity of the compound of the present invention when the compound is intravenously administered was determined on rat (SD-Rat, 100~110g). One group consists of 5 males and 5 females. The first group is the control group and 0.5% CMC was intravenously administered to this group. The compounds of Examples 5 and 8 were orally administered in a dosage of 1,000, 2,000mg/kg, respectively, to each test group. After the<br>
administration, clinical conditions of the mice were observed for 14 days and<br>
th<br>
weight change was also measured. On the last day of the test, 14 day from<br>
the start, the rat were subjected to an autopsy in order to examine changes of the internal organs. During the period of observation, neither abnormal response nor specific autopsy result was observed. Also, the body weights of the test groups do not show any change with statistical significance when compared with the control group. Further, since no mouse died during the test period, it was confirmed that the compounds of Examples 5 and 8 have LDso<br>
of 2,000mg/kg or more. This means that the compounds of the present invention including those of Examples 5 and 8 are safe in the aspect of acute toxicity.<br><br><br><br><br>
