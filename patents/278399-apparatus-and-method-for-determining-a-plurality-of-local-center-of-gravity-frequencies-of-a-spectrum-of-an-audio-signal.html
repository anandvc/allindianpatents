Apparatus and Method for Determining a Plurality of Local Center of Gravity<br>
Frequencies of a Spectrum of an Audio Signal<br>
Description<br>
Embodiments according to the invention relate to audio signal processing systems and,<br>
more particularly, to an apparatus and a method for determining a plurality of local center<br>
of gravity frequencies of a spectrum of an audio signal.<br>
There is an increasing demand for digital signal processing techniques that address the<br>
need for extreme signal manipulations in order to fit pre-recorded audio signals, e.g. taken<br>
from a database, into a new musical context. In order to do so, high level semantic signal<br>
properties like pitch, musical key and scale mode are needed to be adapted. All these<br>
manipulations have in common that they aim at substantially altering the musical<br>
properties of the original audio material while preserving subjective sound quality as good<br>
as possible. In other words, these edits strongly change the audio material musical content<br>
but, nevertheless, are required to preserve the naturalness of the processed audio sample<br>
and thus maintain believability. This ideally requires signal processing methods that are<br>
broadly applicable to different classes of signals including polyphonic mixed music<br>
content.<br>
Therefore, a method for analysis, manipulation and synthesis of audio signals based on<br>
multiband modulation components has been proposed lately (see "S. Disch and B. Edler,<br>
"An amplitude- and frequency modulation vocoder for audio signal processing." Proc. of<br>
the Int. Conf. on Digital Audio Effects (DAFx). 2008", "S. Disch and B. Edler, "Multiband<br>
perceptual modulation analysis, processing and synthesis of audio signals," Proc. of the<br>
IEEE-ICASSP, 2009"). The fundamental idea of this approach is to decompose polyphonic<br>
mixtures into components that are perceived as sonic entities anyway, and to further<br>
manipulate all signal elements that are contained in one component in a joint fashion.<br>
Additionally, a synthesis method has been introduced that renders a smooth and<br>
perceptually pleasant yet - depending on the type of manipulation applied - drastically<br>
modified output signal. If no manipulation whatsoever is applied to the components the<br>
method has been shown to provide transparent or near-transparent subjective audio quality<br>
(see "S. Disch and B. Edler, "An amplitude- and frequency modulation vocoder for audio<br>
signal processing," Proc. of the Int. Conf. on Digital Audio Effects (DAFx), 2008") for<br>
many test signals.<br>
 <br>
An important step for a block based polyphonic music manipulation, e.g. the multiband<br>
modulation decomposition, is the estimation of local centers of gravity (COG) (see "J.<br>
Anantharaman, A. Krishnarnurthy, and L. Feth, "Intensity-weighted average of<br>
instantaneous frequency as a model for frequency discrimination.," J. Acoust. Soc. Am.,<br>
vol. 94, pp. 723-729, 1993", "Q. Xu, L. L. Feth, J. N. Anantharaman, and A. K.<br>
Krishnarnurthy, "Bandwidth of spectral resolution for the "c-o-g" effect in vowel-like<br>
complex sounds," Acoustical Society of America Journal, vol. 101, pp. 3149-+, May<br>
1997") in successive spectra over time. This document shows an iterative algorithm, that<br>
can be used to determine a signal adaptive spectral decomposition that is aligned with local<br>
COG of the signal.<br>
The COG approach may be reminiscent of the classic time frequency reassignment (t-f<br>
reassignment) method. For an extensive overview on this technique the reader is referred to<br>
(see "A. Fulop and K. Fitz, "Algorithms for computing the time corrected instantaneous<br>
frequency (reassigned) spectrogram, with applications", Journal of the Acoustical Society<br>
of America, vol. 119, pp. 360-371, 2006"). Basically, t-f reassignment alters the regular<br>
time-frequency grid of a conventional Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) towards a<br>
time-corrected instantaneous frequency spectrogram, thereby revealing temporal and<br>
spectral accumulations of energy that are better localized than implicated by the t-f<br>
resolution compromise inherent in the STFT spectrogram. Often, reassignment is used as<br>
an enhanced front-end for subsequent partial tracking (see "K. Fitz and L. Haken, "On the<br>
use of time-frequency reassignment in additive sound modeling", Journal of the Audio<br>
Engineering Society, vol. 50(11), pp. 879-893, 2002").<br>
Other related publications aim at the estimation of multiple fundamental frequencies (see<br>
"A Klapuri, Signal Processing Methods For the Automatic Transcription of Music, Ph.D.<br>
thesis, Tampere University of Technology, 2004", "Chunghsin Yeh, Multiple fundamental<br>
frequency estimation of polyphonic recordings, Ph.D. thesis, Ecole doctorale edite,<br>
Universite de Paris, 2008") by grouping spectral peaks which exhibit certain harmonic<br>
relations into separate sources. However, for complex music composed of many sources<br>
(like orchestral music), this approach has no reasonable chance.<br>
In some applications vocoders are used for signal manipulation. One class of vocoders are<br>
phase vocoders. A tutorial on phase vocoders is the publication ""The Phase Vocoder: A<br>
tutorial", Mark Dolson, Computer Music Journal, Volume 10, No. 4, pages 14 to 27,<br>
1986". An additional publication is ""New phase vocoder techniques for pitch-shifting,<br>
harmonizing and other exotic effects", L. Laroche and M. Dolson, proceedings 1999, IEEE<br>
 <br>
workshop on applications of signal processing to audio and acoustics, New Paltz, New<br>
York, October 17 to 20,1999, pages 91 to 94".<br>
Figs. 17 and 18 illustrate different implementations and applications for a phase vocoder.<br>
Fig. 17 illustrates a filter bank implementation of a phase vocoder 1700, in which an audio<br>
signal is provided at an input 500, and where, at an output 510, a synthesized audio signal<br>
is obtained. Specifically, each channel of the filter bank illustrated in Fig. 17 comprises a<br>
band pass filter 501 and a subsequently connected oscillator 502. Output signals of all<br>
oscillators 502 from all channels are combined via a combiner 503, which is illustrated as<br>
an adder. At the output of the combiner 503, the output signal 510 is obtained.<br>
Each filter 501 is implemented to provide, on the one hand, an amplitude signal A(t), and<br>
on the other hand, the frequency signal f(t). The amplitude signal and the frequency signal<br>
are time signals. The amplitude signal illustrates a development of the amplitude within a<br>
filter band over time and the frequency signal illustrates the development of the frequency<br>
of a filter output signal over time.<br>
As schematic implementation of a filter 501 is illustrated in Fig. 18. The incoming signal is<br>
routed into two parallel paths. In one path, the signal is multiplied by a sine wave with an<br>
amplitude of 1.0 and a frequency equal to the center frequency of the band pass filter as<br>
illustrated at 551. In the other path, the signal is multiplied by a cosine wave of the same<br>
amplitude and frequency as illustrated at 551. Thus, the two parallel paths are identical<br>
except for the phase of the multiplying wave form. Then, in each path, the result of the<br>
multiplication is fed into a low pass filter 553. The multiplication operation itself is also<br>
known as a simple ring modulation. Multiplying any signal by a sine (or cosine) wave of<br>
constant frequency has the effect of simultaneously shifting all the frequency components<br>
in the original signal by both plus and minus the frequency of the sine wave. If this result is<br>
now passed through an appropriate low pass filter, only the low frequency portion will<br>
remain. This sequence of operations is also known as heterodyning. This heterodyning is<br>
performed in each of the two parallel paths, but since one path heterodynes with a sine<br>
wave, while the other path uses a cosine wave, the resulting heterodyned signals in the two<br>
paths are out of phase by 90°. The upper low pass filter 553, therefore, provides a quadrate<br>
signal 554 and the lower filter 553 provides an in-phase signal. These two signals, which<br>
are also known as I and Q signals, are forwarded into a coordinate transformer 556 which<br>
generates a magnitude/phase representation from the rectangular representation.<br>
The amplitude signal is output at 557 and corresponds to A(t) from Fig. 17. The phase<br>
signal is input into a phase unwrapper 558. At the output of element 558 there does not<br>
 <br>
exist a phase value between 0 and 360° but a phase value which increases in a linear way.<br>
This "unwrapped" phase value is input into a phase/frequency converter 559 which may,<br>
for example, be implemented as a phase-difference-device which subtracts a phase at a<br>
preceding time instant from phase at a current time instant in order to obtain the frequency<br>
value for the current time instant.<br>
This frequency value is added to a constant frequency value fj of the filter channel i, in<br>
order to obtain a time-varying frequency value at an output 560.<br>
The frequency value at the output 560 has a DC portion Fi and a changing portion which is<br>
also known as the "frequency fluctuation", by which a current frequency of the signal in<br>
the filter channel deviates from the mean frequency Fi.<br>
Thus, the phase vocoder as illustrated in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 provides a separation of spectral<br>
information and time information. The spectral information is comprised in the specific<br>
filter bank channel and in the frequency fj, and the time information is in the frequency<br>
fluctuation and in the magnitude over time.<br>
Another description of the phase vocoder is the Fourier transform interpretation. It consists<br>
of a succession of overlapping Fourier transforms taken over finite-duration windows in<br>
time. In the Fourier transform interpretation, attention is focused on the magnitude and<br>
phase values for all of the different filter bands or frequency bins at the single point in<br>
time. While in the filter bank interpretation, the re-synthesis can be seen as a classic<br>
example of additive synthesis with time varying amplitude and frequency controls for each<br>
oscillator, the synthesis, in the Fourier implementation, is accomplished by converting<br>
back to real-and-imaginary form and overlap-adding the successive inverse Fourier<br>
transforms. In the Fourier interpretation, the number of filter bands in the phase vocoder is<br>
the number of points in the Fourier transform. Similarly, the equal spacing in frequency of<br>
the individual filters can be recognized as the fundamental feature of the Fourier transform.<br>
On the other hand, the shape of the filter pass bands, i.e., the steepness of the cutoff at the<br>
band edges is determined by the shape of the window function which is applied prior to<br>
calculating the transform. For a particular characteristic shape, e.g., Hamming window, the<br>
steepness of the filter cutoff increases in direct proportion to the duration of the window.<br>
It is useful to see that the two different interpretations of the phase vocoder analysis apply<br>
only to the implementation of the bank of band pass filters. The operation by which the<br>
outputs of these filter are expressed as time-varying amplitudes and frequencies is the same<br>
for both implementations. The basic goal of the phase vocoder is to separate temporal<br>
 <br>
information from spectral information. The operative strategy is to divide the signal into a<br>
number of spectral bands and to characterize the time-varying signal in each band.<br>
Two basic operations are particularly significant. These operations are time scaling and<br>
pitch transposition. It is always possible to slow down a recorded sound simply by playing<br>
it back at a lower sample rate. This is analogous to playing a tape recording at a lower<br>
playback speed. But, this kind of simplistic time expansion simultaneously lowers the pitch<br>
by the same factor as the time expansion. Slowing down the temporal evolution of a sound<br>
without altering its pitch requires an explicit separation of temporal and spectral<br>
information. As noted above, this is precisely what the phase vocoder attempts to do.<br>
Stretching out the time-varying amplitude and frequency signals A(t) and f(t) to Fig. 5a<br>
does not change the frequency of the individual oscillators at all, but it does slow down the<br>
temporal evolution of the composite sound. The result is a time-expanded sound with the<br>
original pitch. The Fourier transform view of time scaling is so that, in order to time-<br>
expand a sound, the inverse FFTs can simply be spaced further apart than the analysis<br>
FFTs. As a result, spectral changes occur more slowly in the synthesized sound than in the<br>
original in this application, and the phase is rescaled by precisely the same factor by which<br>
the sound is being time-expanded.<br>
The other application is pitch transposition. Since the phase vocoder can be used to change<br>
the temporal evolution of a sound without changing its pitch, it should also be possible to<br>
do the reverse, i.e., to change the pitch without changing the duration. This is done by<br>
time-scale using the desired pitch-change factor and then to play the resulting sounds back<br>
at a sample rate modified by the same factor. For example, to raise the pitch by an octave,<br>
the sound is first time-expanded by a factor of 2 and the time-expansion is then played at<br>
twice the original sample rate.<br>
An application of vocoders for processing audio signals is shown for example in "Sascha<br>
Disch, Bernd Edler: "An Amplitude- and Frequency-Modulation Vocoder for Audio Signal<br>
Processing", Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Digital Audio Effects<br>
(DAFx-08), Espoo, Finland, September 1-4, 2008". In this document local center of<br>
gravity candidates are estimated by searching positive to negative transitions in a center of<br>
gravity position function. For this, the center of gravity position function is calculated for<br>
each value of the spectrum (for example for each spectral amplitude value or each power<br>
density value) for each time block of the audio signal. In this context, block sizes of N=214<br>
values at 48kHz sample frequency are mentioned. Therefore, the computational efforts for<br>
estimating the local center of gravity candidates are very high.<br>
 <br>
Additionally a post-selection procedure is necessary to ensure that the final estimated<br>
center of gravity positions are approximately equidistant on a perceptual scale.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved concept for determining a<br>
plurality of local centers of gravity frequencies of a spectrum of an audio signal, which<br>
allows to reduce the computational efforts.<br>
This object is solved by an apparatus according to claim 1 and a method according to claim<br>
20.<br>
An embodiment of the invention provides an apparatus for determining a plurality of local<br>
centers of gravity frequencies of a spectrum of an audio signal. The apparatus comprises an<br>
offset determiner, a frequency determiner and an iteration controller. The offset determiner<br>
is configured to determine an offset frequency for each iteration start frequency of a<br>
plurality of iteration start frequencies based on the spectrum of the audio signal, wherein a<br>
number of discrete sample values of the spectrum is larger than a number of iteration start<br>
values. The frequency determiner is configured to determine a new plurality of iteration<br>
start frequencies by increasing or reducing each iteration start frequency of a plurality of<br>
iteration start frequencies by the corresponding determined offset frequency. Further, the<br>
iteration controller is configured to provide the new plurality of iteration start frequencies<br>
to the offset determiner for a further iteration or to provide the plurality of local center of<br>
gravity frequencies, if a predefined termination condition is fulfilled, wherein the plurality<br>
of local center of gravity frequencies is set equal to the new plurality of iteration start<br>
frequencies.<br>
Embodiments according to the invention are based on the central idea that offset<br>
frequencies are determined for a plurality of iteration start frequencies and then the<br>
iteration start frequencies are updated by their determined offset frequencies. This is done<br>
iteratively until a predefined termination condition is fulfilled. Since the number of<br>
iteration start frequencies is lower than the number of discrete sample values of the<br>
spectrum, the computational complexity is significantly reduced in comparison to known<br>
concepts.<br>
For example, the number of iteration start frequencies may be between 10 and 100. This is,<br>
for example, significantly less than the number of discrete sample values of an N = 214<br>
mentioned above. In this example, the computational efforts may be reduced by a factor of<br>
more than 100.<br>
 <br>
Additionally, the spectral resolution may be easily adapted by varying the number of<br>
iteration start frequencies and/or adapting the offset frequency calculation parameters.<br>
Some embodiments according to the invention comprise a frequency merger. The<br>
frequency merger merges two adjacent iteration start frequencies of the plurality of<br>
iteration start frequencies, if a frequency distance between the two adjacent iteration start<br>
frequencies is smaller than a minimum frequency distance.<br>
Some further embodiments according to the invention comprise a frequency adder. The<br>
frequency adder adds an iteration start frequency to the plurality of iteration start<br>
frequencies, if a frequency distance between two adjacent iteration start frequencies of the<br>
plurality of iteration start frequencies is larger than a maximum frequency distance. For<br>
example, this may be useful, if an initialization is done by a previous (time) block's<br>
estimate.<br>
Some embodiments according to the invention relate to a method for determining a<br>
plurality of local center of gravity frequencies of a spectrum of an audio signal according<br>
to an embodiment of the invention. The method comprises determining an offset frequency<br>
for each iteration start frequency of a plurality of iteration start frequencies, determining a<br>
new plurality of iteration start frequencies and providing the new plurality of iteration start<br>
frequencies for a further iteration or providing the plurality of local center of gravity<br>
frequencies. The offset frequency for each iteration start frequency of the plurality of<br>
iteration start frequencies is determined based on the spectrum of the audio signals,<br>
wherein a number of discrete sample values of the spectrum is larger than a number of<br>
iteration start frequencies. The new plurality of iteration start frequencies is determined by<br>
increasing or reducing each iteration start frequency of the plurality of iteration start<br>
frequencies by the corresponding determined offset frequency. The plurality of local center<br>
of gravity frequencies is provided for storage, transmission or further processing, if a<br>
predefined determination condition is fulfilled. For this, the plurality of local center of<br>
gravity frequencies is equal to the new plurality of iteration start frequencies.<br>
In some embodiments according to the invention the plurality of local center of gravity<br>
frequencies determined for a previous time block of the audio signal are used as iteration<br>
start frequencies for the first iteration of the next time block of the audio signal. In this<br>
case, large gaps between the iteration start frequencies may be filled by the frequency<br>
adder.<br>

In the following, the same reference numerals are partly used for objects and functional<br>
units having the same or similar functional properties and the description thereof with<br>
regard to a figure shall apply also to other figures in order to reduce redundancy in the<br>
description of the embodiments.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of an apparatus 100 for determining a plurality of local<br>
center of gravity frequencies 132 of a spectrum 102 of an audio signal according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. The apparatus 100 comprises an offset determiner 110, a<br>
frequency determiner 120 and an iteration controller 130. The offset determiner 110 is<br>
 <br>
connected to the frequency determiner 120, the frequency determiner 120 is connected to<br>
the iteration controller 130 and the iteration controller 130 is connected to the offset<br>
determiner 110. The offset determiner 110 determines an offset frequency 112 for each<br>
iteration start frequency of a plurality of iteration start frequencies based on the spectrum<br>
102 of the audio signal. The spectrum 102 is represented by discrete sample values,<br>
wherein a number of sample values of the spectrum 102 is larger than a number of iteration<br>
start frequencies. The frequency determiner 120 determines a new plurality of iteration<br>
start frequencies 122 by increasing or reducing each iteration start frequency of the<br>
plurality of iteration start frequencies by the corresponding determined offset frequency<br>
112. Then, the iteration controller 130 provides the new plurality of iteration start<br>
frequencies 122 to the offset determiner 110 for a further iteration. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, the plurality of local center of gravity frequencies 132 is provided, if a<br>
predefined termination condition is fulfilled, wherein the plurality of local center of gravity<br>
frequencies 132 is equal or is set equal to the new plurality of iteration start frequencies<br>
122.<br>
Since the number of iteration start frequencies is lower than the number of discrete sample<br>
values of the spectrum, the computational efforts for determining the plurality of local<br>
center of gravity frequencies 132 is reduced in comparison to concepts determining the<br>
local center of gravity frequencies based on functions, which have to be calculated for each<br>
discrete sample value of the spectrum.<br>
The resolution and/or the accuracy of the determination of the local center of gravity<br>
frequency may be adapted to the particular application by varying the number of iteration<br>
start frequencies and/or the offset frequency calculation parameters. In this way also the<br>
computational effort varies, but since the number of iteration start frequencies is usually<br>
clearly below the number of discrete sample values of the spectrum, a low computational<br>
complexity may be guaranteed.<br>
For example, the discrete sample values of the spectrum 102 may be spectral amplitudes,<br>
power spectral density values or other values obtained by a Fourier transformation of the<br>
audio signal. The number of discrete sample values of spectrum 102 for a time block of the<br>
audio signal may lie, for example, between 1,000 and 100,000 or between 29 and 220. By<br>
contrast, the number of iteration start frequencies may lie, for example, between 5 and 500.<br>
This large difference between the number of discrete sample values of the spectrum 102<br>
and the number of iteration start frequencies allows the significant reduction of<br>
computational complexity in comparison to known methods.<br>

A local center of gravity frequency 132 may be a frequency at which the spectrum 102 of<br>
the audio signal may comprise, for example, a local maximum or a local aggregation of<br>
spectrum amplitude or the power spectral density or another value obtained by a Fourier<br>
transformation of the audio signal.<br>
For example, the plurality of iteration start frequencies may be equally or according to a<br>
distribution function or a given distribution spaced from each other over the spectrum 102<br>
for the first iteration. Based on this iteration start frequencies and the spectrum 102, the<br>
offset determiner 110 determines the offset frequencies 112, which may be an indication of<br>
how far away from the local center of gravity an iteration start frequency is located.<br>
Therefore, the frequency determiner 120 tries to compensate this distance between the<br>
local center of gravity and the iteration start frequency by increasing or reducing<br>
(depending on a positive or negative value of the offset frequency) the iteration start<br>
frequency by the corresponding determined offset frequencies. Then the new plurality of<br>
iteration start frequencies 122 is provided to the offset determiner 110 for a further<br>
iteration or the new plurality of iteration start frequencies 122 is provided as the plurality<br>
of local center of gravity frequencies 132 to be determined, if a predefined termination<br>
condition is fulfilled.<br>
The apparatus 100 may determine a plurality of local center of gravity frequencies 132 for<br>
each time block of a plurality of time blocks of the audio signal. In other words, the audio<br>
signal may be processed in time blocks. For each time block a spectrum 102 may be<br>
generated by a Fourier transformation and a plurality of local center of gravity frequencies<br>
132 may be determined.<br>
Possible predefined termination conditions may be for example that each offset frequency<br>
is below a maximum offset frequency, that the sum of all offset frequencies is below a<br>
maximum offset frequency sum or that the sum of the offset frequency determined for the<br>
current time block and the offset frequency determined for a previous time block is lower<br>
than a threshold offset.<br>
The spectrum 102 provided to the offset determiner 110 may comprise, for example, a<br>
linear or logarithmic scale. For example, the plurality of iteration start frequencies may be<br>
distributed equally spaced over an logarithmic spectrum 102 for the first iteration to set a<br>
tendency for the determination of the plurality of local center of gravity frequencies 132,<br>
so that determined plurality of center of gravity frequencies 132 may be distributed on a<br>
perceptual scale.<br>
 <br>
The offset determiner 110, the frequency determiner 120 and the iteration controller 130<br>
may be independent hardware units, part of a digital signal processor, a micro controller or<br>
a computer or they may be realized as a computer program or a computer program product<br>
configured to run on a micro controller or computer.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a block diagram of an apparatus 200 for determining a plurality of local<br>
center gravity frequencies 132 of a spectrum 102 of an audio signal according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. The apparatus 200 is similar to the apparatus shown in Fig.<br>
1, but comprises additionally a frequency adder 210, a frequency merger 220 and a<br>
frequency remover 230. In this example, the frequency determiner 120 is connected to the<br>
frequency remover 230, the frequency remover 230 is connected to the iteration controller<br>
130, the iteration controller 130 is connected to the frequency adder 210, the frequency<br>
adder 210 is connected to the frequency merger 220 and the frequency merger 220 is<br>
connected to the offset determiner 110. Alternatively, the positions of the frequency adder<br>
210 and the frequency merger 220 may be changed and/or the frequency remover 230 may<br>
be arranged between the iteration controller 130 and the frequency adder 210, between the<br>
frequency adder 210 and the frequency merger 220 or between the frequency merger 220<br>
and the offset determiner 110.<br>
The frequency adder 210 may add an iteration start frequency to the new plurality of<br>
iteration start frequencies 122, if the frequency distance between two adjacent iteration<br>
start frequencies of the new plurality of iteration start frequencies 122 is larger than a<br>
maximum frequency distance. For this, the frequency distance and the maximum<br>
frequency distance may be measured on a linear or logarithmic scale.<br>
In other words, the frequency adder 210 adds an iteration start frequency if a gap between<br>
two adjacent iterations start frequencies is too large. For example, this may be especially of<br>
interest if the plurality of local center of gravity frequency 132 determined for the current<br>
time block is provided to the offset determiner 110 to be used as plurality of iteration start<br>
frequencies for the first iteration of the next time block. But also during the iterations for<br>
the same time block an iteration start frequency may be added.<br>
The plurality of local center of gravity frequencies can be utilized as a basis for generating<br>
a new plurality of iteration start frequencies.<br>
The plurality of iteration start frequencies for the first iteration of a time block may be, for<br>
example, equally spaced from each other, as described before, or the determined plurality<br>
of local center of gravity frequencies 132 determined for the previous time block of the<br>
 <br>
audio signal may be used as iteration start frequencies for the first iteration of the current<br>
time block.<br>
The frequency merger 220 merges two adjacent iteration start frequencies of the new<br>
plurality of iteration start frequencies 122 if a frequency distance between the two adjacent<br>
iteration start frequencies is smaller than a minimum frequency distance. Once again, the<br>
frequency distance and the minimum frequency distance may be measured on a linear or<br>
logarithmic scale.<br>
In other words, the frequency merger 220 may replace two adjacent iteration start<br>
frequencies by one iteration start frequency if the distance between the two adjacent<br>
iteration start frequencies is lower than a limit.<br>
The frequency remover 230 removes an iteration start frequency from the new plurality of<br>
iteration start frequencies 132 if the iteration start frequency is higher than a predefined<br>
maximum frequency of the spectrum 102 of the audio signal or if the iteration start<br>
frequency is lower than a predefined minimum frequency of the spectrum 102 of the audio<br>
signal. For example, the predefined maximum frequency may be the highest frequency<br>
comprised by the spectrum 102 and the predefined minimum frequency may be the lowest<br>
frequency comprised by the spectrum 102.<br>
In other words, the frequency remover 230 removes iteration start frequencies from the<br>
new plurality of iteration start frequencies 122, if they are located outside of the frequency<br>
range of the spectrum 102 of the audio signal.<br>
The frequency adder 210 and the frequency remover 230 are optional units of the apparatus<br>
200.<br>
The frequency adder 210, the frequency merger 220 and the frequency remover 230 may<br>
be independent hardware units or integrated as mentioned for the offset determiner 110, the<br>
frequency determiner 120 and the alteration controller 130.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of an apparatus 300 for determining a plurality of local<br>
center of gravity frequencies 132 of a spectrum 102 of an audio signal 302 according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. The apparatus 300 is similar to the apparatus shown in Fig.<br>
1, but comprises additionally a preprocessor 310. The preprocessor 310 is connected to the<br>
offset determiner 110. The preprocessor 310 generates a Fourier transformation spectrum<br>
for a time block of the audio signal 302 and generates a smoothed spectrum based on the<br>
 <br>
Fourier transformation spectrum of the time block. Further, the preprocessor 310 generates<br>
the spectrum 102 of the audio signal 302 to be provided to the offset determiner 110 by<br>
dividing the Fourier transformation spectrum by the smoothed spectrum. Then, the<br>
preprocessor 310 maps the spectrum to a logarithmic scale and provides the logarithmic<br>
spectrum 102 to the offset determiner 110. Alternatively, the preprocessor 310 may map<br>
the Fourier transformation spectrum to a logarithmic scale before generating the smoothed<br>
spectrum and before dividing the Fourier transformation spectrum by the smoothed<br>
spectrum.<br>
In some embodiments, for each signal block (time block), a power spectral density (psd)<br>
estimate is obtained by computing the DFT spectral energy. Subsequently, in order to<br>
remove the global trend, the psd is normalized on a smoothed psd that is calculated, for<br>
example, by fitting a low order polynomial, performing cepstral smoothing or by filtering<br>
along frequency direction. Prior to division, both quantities may be also temporally<br>
smoothed, for example, by a first order IIR filter with time constant of, for example, 200<br>
ms. Next, a mapping of the psd is performed onto a perceptual scale (logarithmic scale)<br>
prior to COG calculation and segmentation, for example, in order to facilitate the task of<br>
segmenting a spectrum into perceptually adapted non-uniform and, at the same time, COG<br>
centered bands. Thereby the problem may be simplified to the task of an alignment of a set<br>
of approximately uniform segments with the estimated local COG positions of the signal.<br>
As a perceptual scale the ERB scale (see "B. C. J. Moore and B. R. Giasberg, "A revision<br>
of Zwicker's loudness model," Acta Acustica, vol. 82, pp. 335-345, 1996") may be<br>
applied which provides better spectral resolution at lower frequencies than e.g. the BARK<br>
scale. However, the BARK scale may also be used. The mapped spectrum may be<br>
calculated by interpolation of the uniformly sampled spectrum towards spectral samples<br>
that are spaced following the ERB scale (see equation 2).<br>
 <br>
Alternatively, For each signal block, a power spectral density (psd) estimate is obtained by<br>
computing the DFT spectral energy. Next, a mapping of the psd is performed onto a<br>
perceptual scale prior to COG calculation and segmentation in order to facilitate the task of<br>
segmenting a spectrum into perceptually adapted non-uniform and, at the same time, COG<br>
centered bands. Thereby the problem is simplified to the task of an alignment of a set of<br>
approximately uniform segments with the estimated local COG positions of the signal. As<br>
 <br>
 <br>
For example, using a time block length of 2^14 samples, the DFT spectrum consists of<br>
2^13+1 samples. Those are mapped to an ERB scale representation also having 2^13+1<br>
samples. Choosing a COG resolution equivalent to 0.5 ERB, this gives S = 47 samples at<br>
48kHz sampling frequency and hence N = 174 initial equally spaced candidates. In the<br>
iteration, for example, 40-50 final COG positions are estimated. The total number of final<br>
COG positions is dependent on the signal characteristics, the weights g(i) and on the COG<br>
resolution measured in ERB (also see equations 4). Sensible values for the COG<br>
resolution are, for example, in the interval of 0.1 - 1 ERB.<br>
The iteration process consists of two loops. The first loop calculates 1410 the position<br>
offset posOff(n) of the candidate position c(n) from the true local center of gravity by<br>
application of a negative-to-positive linear slope function of size 2S, weighted by weights<br>
g(i), to each candidate position n on the preprocessed psd estimate of a signal block (see<br>
equations 4).<br>
 <br>
In other words, the offset determiner 110 may determine the offset frequency, also called<br>
position offset, based on a plurality of discrete sample values of the spectrum (the power<br>
spectral density values in this example) and a plurality of corresponding values of a weight<br>
parameter g(i) and corresponding values of a distance parameter idxOff(i). The values of<br>
the distance parameter may be equally spaced from each other on a logarithmic scale,<br>
wherein all values of the distance parameter are smaller than a maximum distance value (in<br>
this example S). Further, the distance parameter may take positive or negative values, as<br>
for example shown by equations 4. The weight parameter may be based on a window<br>
function, as for example a rectangle or a window with more or less steep edges. In this<br>
way, the influence of large peaks far away from the iteration start frequency (also called<br>
 <br>
candidate in this example), for which the offset frequency is currently determined, is<br>
reduced. In other words, the values of the weight parameter may be all the same (for<br>
example for a rectangle) or the values of the weight parameter may decrease for increasing<br>
absolute values of the corresponding distance parameter (for example, to reduce the<br>
influence of peaks with large distance).<br>
In Figure 15a, the candidate position offset posOff(n) procedure is visualized. The stem<br>
plots 1590 correspond to the local psd samples wn(i) centered at the candidate position<br>
c(n), the window function is represented by values g(i) and the linear slope function is<br>
denoted by idxOff(i).<br>
In a next step (see equation 5), all candidate positions from the list are updated 1420 by<br>
their position offset.<br>
 <br>
Each candidate position that violates the border limitations (frequencies higher than the<br>
maximum frequency of the spectrum and lower than the minimum frequency of the<br>
spectrum) is removed 1525 from the list as indicated by (see equations 6) and the number<br>
of remaining candidate positions N is decremented by 1.<br>
 <br>
If the absolute value of the sum of the actual and the previous position offsets of a<br>
candidate as defined in (see equation 7a) is smaller than a predefined threshold this<br>
candidate position c(n) is not updated in further iterations but still remains in the list and is<br>
thus subjected to the subsequent candidate fusion mechanism.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
If |sumOff(n)| of all candidates is smaller than a predefined threshold (see equation 7b) the<br>
first iteration loop is exited 1440 hereby terminating the iteration process. All remaining<br>
candidates from the list constitute the final set of COG position estimates. Note that using<br>
this type of condition also ends the iteration in case if the position offset toggles back and<br>
forth between two values hereby always ensuring proper termination.<br>
 <br>
Otherwise the next iteration step may be executed with the updated candidate positions<br>
1520.<br>
For example, thresl may be set equal or smaller than one sample (2 samples, 5 samples or<br>
10 samples).<br>
The second loop iteratively fuses 1540 the closest (according to a certain proximity<br>
measure) two position candidates that violate 1570 a predefined proximity restriction due<br>
to the position update provided by the first loop, into one single new candidate, thereby<br>
accounting for perceptual fusion. The proximity measure prox2 1530 is the spectral<br>
distance of the two candidates (see equations 8).<br>
 <br>
For example, thres2 may be set to S samples, S/2 samples, 2S samples or another value<br>
between 1 sample and 10S samples.<br>
Each newly calculated joint candidate is initialized to occupy the energy weighted mean<br>
position of the two former candidates (see equations 9).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Both former candidates are deleted from the list and the new joint candidate is added to the<br>
list. Consequently, the number of remaining candidate positions N is decremented by 1.<br>
The second loop iteration terminates 1570 if no more candidates violate the proximity<br>
restriction. The final set of COG candidates constitutes the estimated local centers of<br>
gravity positions.<br>
The estimated center of gravity frequencies may be saved 1560, transmitted or provided for<br>
further processing.<br>
In order to speed up the iteration process the initialization of each new block can<br>
advantageously be done using the COG position estimate of the previous block since it is<br>
already a fairly good estimate of the current positions. For example, this applies due to the<br>
block overlap in the analysis and the temporal smoothing in the pre-processing hence the<br>
appropriate assumption of a limited change rate in temporal evolution of COG positions.<br>
Still, care has to be taken to provide enough initial position estimates to also capture the<br>
possible emergence of new COG. Therefore, position candidate gaps in the estimate<br>
spanning a distance greater than a predefined value, for example located in an interval<br>
S,...,2S, are filled by new COG position candidates (see equations 10) thus ensuring that<br>
potential new candidates are within the scope of the position update function. Figure 16<br>
shows a flow chart of this extension 1600 to the algorithm. The apposition of additional<br>
candidates to the list is accomplished with a loop that terminates 1620 if no more gaps<br>
larger than 2S are found.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
(10)<br>
In other words, for a plurality of local center of gravity frequencies or local center of<br>
gravity estimates 1602, the frequency distance between adjacent local center of gravity<br>
frequencies is calculated 1610. If 1620 the frequency distance between two adjacent center<br>
of gravity frequencies is larger than a maximum frequency distance, a local center of<br>
gravity frequency is added 1630 to the plurality of local center of gravity frequencies.<br>
After filling all gaps larger than the maximum frequency distance, the plurality of local<br>
center of gravity frequencies may be saved 1640 for the next time block.<br>
Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 visualize results obtained by the proposed iterative local COG<br>
estimation algorithm described before that has been applied to different test items. The test<br>
items are two separate pure tones 400, two tones that beat with each other 590 , plucked<br>
strings 600 ('MPEG Test Set - sm03') and orchestral music ('Vivaldi - Four Seasons,<br>
Spring, Allegro') 700. In these figures, the perceptually mapped, smoothed and globally<br>
detrended (normalized) spectrum 410, 595, 610, 710 is displayed along with the COG<br>
estimates (reference numerals 12-26). The COG estimates are numbered in ascending<br>
order. While e.g. the estimates no.22, no.26 of Figure 4 and estimates no. 18 and no. 19 of<br>
Figure 6 correspond to sinusoidal signal components, estimate no.22 of Figure 5, estimates<br>
no.23 and no.25 of Figure 6 and most estimates of Figure 7 capture spectrally broadened or<br>
beating components, which are nevertheless detected and segmented well, thus grouping<br>
them into perceptual units.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a block diagram of a signal adaptive filter bank 800 according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. The signal adaptive filter bank 800 comprises an apparatus<br>
100 for determining a plurality of local center of gravity frequencies 132 of a spectrum of<br>
an audio signal 802 and a plurality of bandpass filters 810. The plurality of bandpass filters<br>
810 is configured to filter the audio signal 802 and to provide the filtered audio signal 812<br>
for transmission, storage or further processing. For this, a center frequency and a<br>
bandwidth of each bandpass filter of the plurality of bandpass filters 810 is based on the<br>
plurality of local center of gravity frequencies 132.<br>
For example, each bandpass filter of the plurality of bandpass filters 810 corresponds to a<br>
local center of gravity frequency, wherein the center frequency and the bandwidth of the<br>
bandpass filter depends on the corresponding local center of gravity frequency and the<br>
adjacent local center of gravity frequencies of the corresponding local center of gravity<br>
frequency.<br>
 <br>
The bandwidth of the plurality of bandpass filters 810 may be determined, so that the<br>
whole spectrum is covered without holes.<br>
The filters may be designed on a logarithmic frequency scale according to the original<br>
COG estimates obtained on a logarithmic scale and the resulting spectral weights may be<br>
mapped to the linear domain or, alternatively, in other embodiments the filters may be<br>
designed in the linear domain according to the re-mapped COG positions.<br>
In other words, for the latter embodiment, after having determined the COG estimates, for<br>
example, in the ERB adapted domain the COG positions are mapped back into the linear<br>
domain by solving equation 2 for /and subsequently, in linear domain, a set of N<br>
bandpass filters is calculated in the form of spectral weights, which are to be applied<br>
directly to the original DFT spectrum of the broadband signal.<br>
For the first and preferred embodiment, the COG positions are further processed in the<br>
ERB domain. A set of N bandpass filters is calculated in the form of spectral weighting<br>
functions weightsn of length M according to equations (10a). In other words, a set of<br>
bandpass filters may be calculated in the form of spectral weights, which are, after a<br>
mapping to linear domain, to be applied to the original DFT spectrum of the broadband<br>
signal.<br>
For example, the bandpass filters are designed to have a predefined roll-off of length 2 •<br>
rollOff with sine-squared characteristic. To achieve the desired alignment with the<br>
estimated COG positions, the design procedure described in the following may be applied.<br>
Firstly, the middle positions between adjacent COG position estimates are calculated<br>
where mL(n) denotes the lower midpoint and mu(n) the upper midpoint of a COG position<br>
c (n) relative to its neighbors. Then, at these transition points, the roll-off parts of the<br>
spectral weights are centered such that the roll-off partsof neighboring filters sum up to<br>
one. The middle section of the bandpass weighting function is chosen to be flat-top equal<br>
to one, the remaining sample points are set to zero The filters for n = 0 and n = N have<br>
only one roll-off part and are configured to be lowpass or highpass, respectively.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
In designing the roll-off characteristic, a trade-off has to be made with respect to spectral<br>
selectivity on the one hand and temporal resolution on the other hand. Also, allowing<br>
multiple filters to spectrally overlap may add an additional degree of freedom to the design<br>
restrictions. The trade-off may be chosen in a signal adaptive fashion for e.g. improving on<br>
the reproduction of transients.<br>
Lastly, the COG positions and the spectral weighting functions are mapped back to linear<br>
domain by solving equation (2) for f obtaining equation (10b). Finally, the spectral weights<br>
on a linear scale are yielded, which are to be applied to the DFT spectrum of the broadband<br>
signal.<br>
 <br>
By using a logarithmic spectrum and an initialization with equally spaced iteration start<br>
frequencies the tendency for a perceptual segmentation (small bandwidths for low<br>
frequencies and large bandwidths for high frequencies) may be achieved, although in some<br>
regions of the spectrum the bandwidth of filters for low frequencies might be larger than<br>
the bandwidth of filters for higher frequencies, since the positions of the local center of<br>
gravity frequencies depends on the audio signal.<br>
 <br>
For example, the edges of the bandpass filters may be located in the middle of every two<br>
adjacent center of gravity frequencies on a logarithmic or a linear scale. Alternatively, also<br>
an overlap of several bandpass filters may be possible.<br>
Some embodiments of the invention relate to an application of the described concept for<br>
filterbanks or phase vocoders. The described concept may be used for music manipulation,<br>
for example, for changing pitches of only one or a predefined number of channels.<br>
In Figures 9 and 10, the original - non pre-processed - psd 910, 1010 of the signal block<br>
900, 1000 is depicted and a set of bandpass filters 920, 1020 is sketched, that has been<br>
designed as outlined before. It is clearly visible, that each filter is aligned with a COG<br>
estimate and pairwise smoothly overlaps with its adjacent subband filters. Fig. 9<br>
corresponds to Fig. 6 and Fig. 10 corresponds to Fig. 7.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a block diagram of an apparatus 1100 for converting an audio signal 1102<br>
into a parameterized representation 1132 according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
The apparatus 1100 comprises an apparatus 100 for determining a plurality of local center<br>
of gravity frequencies 132 of a spectrum of the audio signal 1102, a bandpass estimator<br>
1110, a modulation estimator 1120 and an output interface 1130. The apparatus 100 for<br>
determining the plurality of local center of gravity frequencies 132 is also called signal<br>
analyzer and the modulation estimator 1120 comprises a plurality of bandpass filters 810.<br>
The signal analyzer 100 analyses a portion of the audio signal 1102 to obtain an analysis<br>
result 132 in terms of the local center of gravity frequencies 132. The analysis result 132 is<br>
input into a band pass estimator 1110 for estimating information 1112 on a plurality of<br>
band pass filters 810 for the audio signal portion based on the signal analysis result 132.<br>
Thus, the information 1112 on the plurality of bandpass filters 810 is calculated in a signal-<br>
adaptive manner.<br>
Specifically, the information 1112 on the plurality of bandpass filters 810 comprises<br>
information on a filter shape. The filter shape can include a bandwidth of a bandpass filter<br>
and/or a center frequency of the bandpass filter for the portion of the audio signal, and/or a<br>
spectral form of a magnitude transfer function in a parametric form or a non-parametric<br>
form. Importantly, the bandwidth of a bandpass filter is not constant over the whole<br>
frequency range, but may depend on the center frequency of the bandpass filter. For<br>
example, the dependency is so that the bandwidth increases to higher center frequencies<br>
and decreases to lower center frequencies.<br>
 <br>
The signal analyzer 100 performs a spectral analysis of a signal portion of the audio signal<br>
and, particularly, may analyze the power distribution in the spectrum to find regions<br>
having a power concentration, since such regions are determined by the human ear as well<br>
when receiving and further processing sound.<br>
The inventive apparatus 1100 additionally comprises a modulation estimator 1120 for<br>
estimating an amplitude modulation 1122 or a frequency modulation 1124 for each band of<br>
the plurality of bandpass filters 810 for the portion of the audio signal. To this end, the<br>
modulation estimator 1120 uses the information 1112 on the plurality of bandpass filters<br>
810 as will be discussed later on.<br>
The inventive apparatus of Fig. 11 additionally comprises an output interface 1130 for<br>
transmitting, storing or modifying the information on the amplitude modulation 1112, the<br>
information of the frequency modulation 1124 or the information on the plurality of<br>
bandpass filters 810, which may comprise filter shape information such as the values of the<br>
center frequencies of the bandpass filters for this specific portion/block of the audio signal<br>
or other information as discussed above. The output is a parameterized representation<br>
1132.<br>
Fig. 12 and 12a illustrate two preferred embodiments of the modulation estimator 1120 and<br>
the signal analyzer 100 and the bandpass estimator 1110 combined into a single unit,<br>
which is called "carrier frequency estimation". The modulation estimator 1120 preferably<br>
comprises a bandpass filter 1120a, which provides a bandpass signal. This is input into an<br>
analytic signal converter 1120b. The output of block 1120b is useful for calculating AM<br>
information and FM information. For calculating the AM information, the magnitude of<br>
the analytical signal is calculated by block 1120c. The output of the analytical signal block<br>
1120b is input into a multiplier 1120d, which receives, at its other input, an oscillator<br>
signal from an oscillator 1120e, which is controlled by the actual carrier frequency fc 1210<br>
of the band pass 1120a. Then, the phase of the multiplier output is determined in block<br>
1120f. The instantaneous phase is differentiated at block 1120g in order to finally obtain<br>
the FM information. In addition, Fig. 12a shows a preprocessor 310 generating a DFT<br>
spectrum of the audio signal.<br>
The multiband modulation decomposition dissects the audio signal into a signal adaptive<br>
set of (analytic) bandpass signals, each of which is further divided into a sinusoidal carrier<br>
and its amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM). The set of bandpass<br>
filters is computed such that on the one hand the fullband spectrum is covered seamlessly<br>
 <br>
and on the other hand the filters are aligned with local COGs each. Additionally, the<br>
human auditory perception is accounted for by choosing the bandwidth of the filters to<br>
match a perceptual scale e.g. the ERB scale (see "B. C. J. Moore and B. R. Glasberg, "A<br>
revision of Zwicker's loudness model," Acta Acustica, vol. 82, pp. 335-345,1996").<br>
The local COG corresponds to the mean frequency that is perceived by a listener due to the<br>
spectral contributions in that frequency region. Moreover, the bands centered at local COG<br>
positions correspond to regions of influence based phase locking of classic phase vocoders<br>
(see "J. Laroche and M. Dolson, "Improved phase vocoder timescale modification of<br>
audio", IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing, vol. 7, no. 3, pp. 323-332,<br>
1999", "Ch. Duxbury, M. Davies, and M. Sandler, "Improved timescaling of musical audio<br>
using phase locking at transients," in 112th AES Convention, 2002", "A. Robel, "A new<br>
approach to transient processing in the phase vocoder," Proc. of the Int. Conf. on Digital<br>
Audio Effects (DAFx), pp. 344-349, 2003", "A. Robel, "Transient detection and<br>
preservation in the phase vocoder", Int. Computer Music Conference (ICMC'03), pp. 247-<br>
250, 2003"). The bandpass signal envelope representation and the traditional region of<br>
influence phase locking both preserve the temporal envelope of a bandpass signal: either<br>
intrinsically or, in the latter case, by ensuring local spectral phase coherence during<br>
synthesis. With respect to a sinusoidal carrier of a frequency corresponding to the<br>
estimated local COG, both AM and FM are captured in the amplitude envelope and the<br>
heterodyned phase of the analytical bandpass signals, respectively. A dedicated synthesis<br>
method renders the output signal from the carrier frequencies, AM and FM.<br>
A block diagram of the signal decomposition into carrier signals and their associated<br>
modulation components is depicted in Figure 12. In the picture, the schematic signal flow<br>
for the extraction of one component is shown. All other components are obtained in a<br>
similar fashion. Practically, the extraction is carried out jointly for all components on a<br>
block-by-block basis using e.g. a block size of N = 214 at 48kHz sampling frequency and<br>
75% analysis overlap - roughly corresponding to a time interval of 340 ms and a stride of<br>
85 ms - by application of a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) on each windowed signal<br>
block. The window may be a 'flat top' window according to Equation (1). This may ensure<br>
that the centered N/2 samples that are passed on for the subsequent modulation synthesis<br>
are unaffected by the slopes of the analysis window. A higher degree of overlap may be<br>
used for improved accuracy at the cost of increased computational complexity.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Given the spectral representation, next a set of signal adaptive spectral weighting functions<br>
(having bandpass characteristic) that is aligned with local COG positions may be<br>
calculated. After application of the bandpass weighting to the spectrum, the signal is<br>
transformed to the time domain and the analytic signal is derived by Hilbert transform.<br>
These two processing steps can be efficiently combined by calculation of a single-sided<br>
IDFT on each bandpass signal. Subsequently, each analytic signal is heterodyned by its<br>
estimated carrier frequency. Finally, the signal is further decomposed into its amplitude<br>
envelope and its instantaneous frequency (IF) track, obtained by computing the phase<br>
derivative, yielding the desired AM and FM signal (see also "S. Disch and B. Edler, "An<br>
amplitude- and frequency modulation vocoder for audio signal processing," Proc. of the<br>
Int. Conf. on Digital Audio Effects (DAFx), 2008").<br>
Fittingly, Fig. 13a shows a block diagram of an apparatus 1300 for synthesizing a<br>
parameterized representation of an audio signal. For example, an advantageous<br>
implementation is based on an overlap-add operation (OLA) in the modulation domain,<br>
i.e., in the domain before generating the time domain band pass signal. The input signal<br>
which may be a bitstream, but which may also be a direct connection to an analyzer or<br>
modifier as well, is separated into the AM component 1302, the FM component 1304 and<br>
the carrier frequency component 1306. The AM synthesizer preferably comprises an<br>
overlap-adder 1310 and, additionally, a component bonding controller 1320 which,<br>
preferably not only comprises block 1310 but also block 1330, which is an overlap adder<br>
within the FM synthesizer. The FM synthesizer additionally comprises a frequency<br>
overlap-adder 1330, a phase integrator 1332, a phase combiner 1334 which, again, may be<br>
implemented as a regular adder and a phase shifter 1336 which is controllable by the<br>
component bonding controller 1320 in order to regenerate a constant phase from block to<br>
block so that the phase of a signal from a preceding block is continuous with the phase of<br>
an actual block. Therefore, one can say that the phase addition in elements 1334, 1336<br>
corresponds to a regeneration of a constant that was lost during the differentiation in block<br>
1120g in Fig. 12 on the analyzer side. From an information-loss perspective in the<br>
perceptual domain, it is to be noted that this is the only information loss, i.e., the loss of a<br>
constant portion by the differentiation device 1120g in Fig. 12. This loss can be recreated<br>
by adding a constant phase determined by the component bonding device 1320.<br>
 <br>
Overlap-add (OLA) is applied in the parameter domain rather than on the readily<br>
synthesized signal in order to avoid beating effects between adjacent time blocks. The<br>
OLA is controlled by a component bonding mechanism, that, steered by spectral vicinity<br>
(measured on an ERB scale), performs a pair-wise match of components of the actual<br>
block to their predecessors in the previous block. Additionally, the bonding aligns the<br>
absolute component phases of the actual block to the ones of the previous block.<br>
In detail, firstly the FM signal is added to the carrier frequency and the result is passed on<br>
to the OLA stage, the output of which is integrated subsequently. A sinusoidal oscillator<br>
1340 is fed by the resulting phase signal. The AM signal is processed by a second OLA<br>
stage. Finally, the output of the oscillator is modulated 1350 in its amplitude by the<br>
resulting AM signal to obtain the additive contribution of the component to the output<br>
signal 1360.<br>
It should be emphasized that an appropriate spectral segmentation of the signal within the<br>
modulation analysis is of paramount importance for a convincing result of any further<br>
modulation parameter processing. Therefore, herein, a novel suitable segmentation<br>
algorithm is presented.<br>
Fittingly, Fig. 13b shows an application of the described concept 1300 for polyphonic key<br>
mode changes.<br>
Transposing of an audio signal while maintaining original playback speed is a challenging<br>
task. Using the proposed system, this is achieved straightforward by multiplication of all<br>
carrier components with a constant factor. Since the temporal structure of the input signal<br>
is solely captured by the AM signals it is unaffected by the stretching of the carrier's<br>
spectral spacing.<br>
An even more demanding effect can be obtained by selective processing: the key mode of<br>
a piece of music can be changed from e.g. minor to major or vice versa. Therefore, only a<br>
subset of carriers corresponding to certain predefined frequency intervals is mapped to<br>
suitable new values. To achieve this, the carrier frequencies are quantized 1370 to MIDI<br>
pitches which are subsequently mapped 1372 onto appropriate new MIDI pitches (using a-<br>
priori knowledge of mode and key of the music item to be processed). The necessary<br>
processing is depicted in Fig. 13b.<br>
 <br>
For the case of a conversion between major mode and natural minor mode, the MIDI<br>
pitches to be mapped can be derived from the circle of fifth 1390 as depicted in Fig. 13c.<br>
Major to minor conversion is obtained by a leap of three steps counterclockwise, minor to<br>
major change by three steps clockwise. Lastly, the mapped MIDI notes are converted back<br>
1374 in order to obtain 1376 the modified carrier frequencies that are used for synthesis<br>
1378. A dedicated MIDI note onset/offset detection is not required since the temporal<br>
characteristics are predominantly represented by the unmodified AM and thus preserved.<br>
Arbitrary mapping tables can be defined enabling for conversion to and from other minor<br>
flavours (e.g. harmonic minor).<br>
Fig. 14 shows a flowchart of a method 1400 for determining a plurality of local center of<br>
gravity frequencies of a spectrum of an audio signal according to an embodiment of the<br>
invention. The method 1400 comprises determining 1410 an offset frequency for each<br>
iteration start frequency of a plurality of iteration start frequencies, determining 1420 a<br>
new plurality of iteration start frequencies and providing 1430 the new plurality of iteration<br>
start frequencies for a further iteration or providing 1440 the plurality of local center of<br>
gravity frequencies. The offset frequency for each iteration start frequency of the plurality<br>
of iteration start frequencies is determined 1410 based on the spectrum of the audio<br>
signals, wherein a number of discrete sample values of the spectrum is larger than a<br>
number of iteration start frequencies. The new plurality of iteration start frequencies is<br>
determined 1420 by increasing or reducing each iteration start frequency of the plurality of<br>
iteration start frequencies by the corresponding determined offset frequency. The plurality<br>
of local center of gravity frequencies is provided 1440 for storage, transmission or further<br>
processing, if a predefined termination condition is fulfilled. For this, the plurality of local<br>
center of gravity frequencies is set equal to the new plurality of iteration start frequencies.<br>
Some embodiments according to the invention relate to an iterative segmentation algorithm<br>
for audio signal spectra depending on estimated local centers of gravity.<br>
Modern music production and sound generation often relies on manipulation of pre-<br>
recorded pieces of audio, so-called samples, taken from a huge database. Consequently,<br>
there is a increasing request to extensively adapt these samples to any new musical context<br>
in a flexible way. For this purpose, advanced digital signal processing is needed in order to<br>
realize audio effects like pitch shifting, time stretching or harmonization. Often, a key part<br>
of these processing methods is a signal adaptive, block based spectral segmentation<br>
operation. Hence, a novel algorithm for such a spectral segmentation based on local centers<br>
of gravity (COG) is proposed. For example, the method may be used for a multiband<br>
 <br>
modulation decomposition for audio signals. Further, this algorithm can also be used in<br>
the more general context of improved vocoder related applications.<br>
In some embodiments the segmentation algorithm proposed herein consists of an initial<br>
COG spectral position candidate list that is iteratively updated by refined estimates. In the<br>
process of refinement, addition, deletion or fusion of candidates is incorporated, thus the<br>
method does not require a-priori knowledge of the total number of final COG estimates.<br>
The iteration may be implemented by two loops. All necessary operations are performed<br>
on a spectral representation of the signal.<br>
An important step in block based (polyphonic) music manipulation is the estimation of<br>
local centers of gravity (COG) in successive spectra over time. Motivated by the<br>
development of a signal adaptive multiband modulation decomposition, a detailed method<br>
and algorithm that estimates multiple local COG in the spectrum of an arbitrary audio<br>
signal has been proposed. Moreover, a design scheme for a set of resulting bandpass filters<br>
aligned to the estimated COG positions has been described. These filters may be utilized to<br>
subsequently separate the broadband signal into signal dependent perceptually adapted<br>
subband signals.<br>
Exemplary results obtained by application of this method have been presented and<br>
discussed. Developed in the context of a dedicated multiband modulation decomposition<br>
scheme, the proposed algorithm can potentially be used in the more general context of<br>
audio post-processing, audio effects and improved vocoder applications.<br>
In contrast to t-f reassignment methods, the described algorithm directly performs a<br>
spectral segmentation on a perceptually adapted scale, while t-f reassignment solely<br>
provides for a better localized spectrogram and leaves the segmentation problem to later<br>
stages, e.g. partial tracking.<br>
In contrast to methods aiming at the estimation of multiple fundamental frequencies, the<br>
presented approach does not attempt to decompose the signal into its sources, but rather<br>
segments spectra into perceptual units which can be further manipulated conjointly.<br>
Among other aspects, a novel multiple local COG estimation algorithm followed by the<br>
derivation of a set of bandpass filters aligned with the estimated COG positions is<br>
described. Some exemplary result data of the COG estimation and its associated set of<br>
bandpass filters is presented and discussed.<br>
 <br>

these aspects also represent a description of the corresponding method, where a block or<br>
device corresponds to a method step or a feature of a method step. Analogously, aspects<br>
described in the context of a method step also represent a description of a corresponding<br>
block or item or feature of a corresponding apparatus.<br>
