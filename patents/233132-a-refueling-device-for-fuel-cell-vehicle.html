				<td>REFUELING FACILITY, REFUELING DEVICE, AND REFUELING METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to a refueling facility for supplying fuel, a refueling device to be refueled by the refueling facility, and a refueling method.<br>
Conventionally, there have been suggested various fuel cell vehicles driven using electric energy, which is output from a fuel cell. This type of fuel cell vehicle is configured to be refueled with hydrogen or other fuels through a fuel hose or the like from a refueling facility.<br>
In order to refuel the fuel cell vehicle, it is necessary to connect the refueling facility to the fuel cell vehicle using a refueling connector of the fuel hose and to connect them to each other using an electrical signal connector to send or receive a signal or the like that indicates the state of the fuel cell vehicle (the temperature or pressure of a fuel storage tank or the like).   As described above, conventionally there has been a problem that refueling requires a complicated work.<br>
In view of the circumstances, in recent years there has been provided a technology that the refueling connector is integrated with the electrical signal connector to simplify the connection work between the refueling facility and the fuel cell vehicle (for example, refer to patent document 1).<br>
[Patent document 1 ]   Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-104498<br>
Incidentally, when the fuel cell vehicle is refueled, there is such a problem that a battery runs out after the refueling or the like due to power consumption of power consuming devices (for example, a lighting device, an air conditioner, a temperature control mechanism, and other auxiliary machines mounted on the vehicle) during the refueling in addition to the above problem. For example, the fuel cell vehicle is provided with a high pressure tank mounted<br>
thereon for storing fuel to be supplied from the refueling facility, and the temperature control mechanism may control the temperature of the tank during the refueling in some cases.    Due to large power consumption caused by the temperature control mechanism, the battery runs out if the temperature control mechanism continues to be operated during the refueling, which leads to such a<br>
problem that the vehicle cannot be started after the refueling.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. A. First embodiment<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown the configuration of a refueling system 300 according to a first embodiment.    The refueling system 300 includes a fuel cell vehicle 100 running on hydrogen and a refueling facility 200 for supplying fuel and power to the fuel cell vehicle 100.   While the fuel cell vehicle running on hydrogen is exemplified in this embodiment, the present invention is also applicable to a fuel cell vehicle running on ethanol or the like. In addition, the present invention is also applicable to a hybrid car or a gasoline<br>
car similarly, as well as the fuel cell vehicle.    In other words, the fuel in the present invention can be gas fuel (hydrogen gas or natural gas) or liquid fuel (gasoline, ethanol, light oil, or liquid hydrogen).    Furthermore, while a vehicle (moving object) is assumed as a target to which the refueling system 300 is applied in this embodiment, the present invention is applicable to all kinds of movable bodies such as, for example, a ship and an airplane.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, there is shown the configuration of the refueling facility 200.   The refueling facility 200 includes a refueling source 210 equipped with a high pressure pump (not shown) and so forth for pressurizing hydrogen as fuel, a power supply source 220 for supplying power to the fuel cell vehicle 100 during refueling, and a controller 230 for controlling the supply of the fuel and power from the refueling facility 200 to the fuel cell vehicle 100.<br>
While the hydrogen gas as fuel gas is supplied from the refueling source 210 to the fuel cell vehicle 100 through a refueling path 211, the power is supplied from the power supply source 220 to the fuel cell vehicle 100 through a power supply path 221.   As shown in the figure above, the forward end of the refueling path 211 and the forward end of the power supply path 221 are integrated into a supply connector 240.    In other words, the refueling connector is integrated with the power supply connector by the supply connector 240 in this embodiment.   This enables the fuel and the power to be supplied at a time by connecting the connector 240 of the refueling facility 200 with a fuel receptacle (described later) provided in the fuel cell vehicle 100. Furthermore, the fuel and the power are supplied from the refueling facility 200 to the fuel cell vehicle (moving object) 100 at a time, which improves the operability of a refueling operation in the refueling facility 200.<br>
In the above, there are disposed on the fuel supply path 211 a flow control valve 211 a for controlling a flow rate during refueling of the fuel cell<br>
vehicle 100, a shut-off valve 211 a' that takes an "open" state during refueling and a "closed" state after refueling under the control of the controller 230, a pressure sensor 211b for detecting a pressure during refueling, and a temperature sensor 211 c for detecting a temperature during refueling.   On the other hand, there is disposed on the power supply path 221 a switch 221 a for controlling the ON/OFF state of the power supply to the fuel cell 100.   The controller 230 controls power supply by controlling the open/closed state of the switch 221 a, for example, based on a detection signal of a sensor for detecting an attached/detached state of the supply connector 240.    Similarly, the controller 230 controls refueling by controlling the open/closed state of the shut-off valve 211 a' or the like based on the detection signal of the sensor or a detection signal of the pressure sensor 211 b or the temperature sensor 211 c.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, there is shown the configuration of a refueling device (fuel device) of the fuel cell vehicle 100.   The fuel receptacle 110 is provided inside a fuel lid (not shown), which is disposed on the surface of the vehicle body of the fuel cell vehicle 100, and the forward end of the refueling path 111 and the forward end of a power supply path 121 are integrated into the fuel receptacle 110.    In other words, the refueling connector is integrated with the power supply connector by the fuel receptacle 110 in this embodiment. The fuel supplied from the refueling facility 200 is stored in the fuel tank 130 through the refueling path 111 from the fuel receptacle 110, while the power from the refueling facility 200 is supplied from the fuel receptacle 110 to a high voltage battery 140 through the power supply path 121.<br>
The fuel tank 130 is a high-pressure storage tank for storing fuel supplied from the refueling facility 200 under pressure.   While a high-pressure hydrogen tank is assumed as a fuel tank in this embodiment, the present invention is also applicable to a hydrogen absorbing alloy tank or the like.    A<br>
shut-off valve 111a for electro-magnetic control and a stop valve 111 b functioning as an inlet of the fuel tank 130 are disposed in the refueling path 111 from the fuel receptacle 110 to the fuel tank 130.   On the other hand, the fuel tank 130 is equipped with a pressure sensor 130a for detecting an internal pressure of the fuel tank 130 and outputting a pressure signal and a temperature sensor 130b for detecting an internal temperature of the fuel tank 130 and outputting a temperature signal, and these signals are supplied to a control device 190.   The control device 190 controls the shut-off valve 111a, the stop valve 111 b, and so forth between open and closed states based on the signals supplied from the above sensors.<br>
The high voltage battery 140 plays the role of a power supply source for running and is connected to a motor generator 160 via an inverter 150.    As the high voltage battery 140, it is possible to employ, for example, a nickel metal hydride battery, a lithium ion battery, or a capacitor.   A switch 121 a for controlling power supply to the high voltage battery 140 is disposed in the power supply path 121 from the fuel receptacle 110 to the high voltage battery 140.    The control device 190 detects whether the supply connector 240 is connected to the fuel receptacle 110 based on the detection signal sent from a sensor, which is not shown.    Upon detecting that the supply connector 240 is connected to the fuel receptacle 110 so as to enable the refueling and the power supply, the control device (control means) 190 monitors the state of charge (SOC) of the high voltage battery 140 and determines whether the high voltage battery 140 should be supplied with power from the refueling facility 200.<br>
For example, if the state of charge (SOC) of the high voltage battery 140 is equal to or lower than a preset reference value V1 (a first reference value), the control device 190 controls the power to be supplied from the refueling facility 200 by turning on the switch 121 a.    On the other hand, if the<br>
state of charge (SOC) of the high voltage battery 140 is higher than the reference value V1, the control device 190 shuts off the power supply from the refueling facility 200 by turning off the switch 121 a.   The control device 190 controls the power supply to the high voltage battery 140 in this manner.   The amount of power supplied to the high voltage battery 140, the reference value V1, and so forth can be appropriately changed according to user's operations or the like.<br>
The motor generator (power consuming device) 160 generates a driving force to be given to drive wheels (not shown) by means of power supplied from the high voltage battery 140.   The motor generator 160 can serve as both a motor and a generator.    More specifically, if the motor generator 160 serves as the motor, power stored in the high voltage battery 140 is supplied to the motor generator 160 via the inverter 150.   The drive control of the motor generator 160 at that time is achieved by the control of the inverter 150.    On the other hand, if the motor generator 160 serves as the generator, the generated power is sent to the high voltage battery 140 via the inverter 150. At that time, the amount of power generation of the motor generator 160 is controlled by regulating the electric energy sent to the high voltage battery 140 via the inverter 150.<br>
Moreover, the high voltage battery 140 is connected to the DC-DC converter 170, which is a power converter.   The DC-DC converter 170 plays the role of lowering the output voltage of the high voltage battery 140 and supplying the power to a connected low voltage battery 180.<br>
The low voltage battery 180 plays the role of a power supply source to auxiliary machines (power consuming devices) 500 such as a cooling mechanism (temperature control mechanism) 510 for cooling the fuel tank 130 during refueling or the like, an air conditioner 520, and various sensors 530.<br>
The control device 190 controls the power supply from the high voltage battery 140 to the low voltage battery 180 and controls the power supply from the low voltage battery 180 to the auxiliary machines 500 while monitoring the state of charge (SOC) of the low voltage battery 180.   The power supply from the high voltage battery 140 to the low voltage battery 180 will be described in detail below.    Upon detecting that, for example, the supply connector 240 is connected to the fuel receptacle 110 to enable the refueling and the power supply, the control device 190 monitors the state of charge (SOC) of the low voltage battery 180 and determines whether the low voltage battery 180 should be supplied with power from the high voltage battery 140.<br>
For example, if the state of charge (SOC) of the low voltage battery 180 is equal to or lower than a preset reference value V2 (<v1 second reference value the control device controls power to be supplied from high voltage battery low via dc-dc converter on other hand if state of charge is higher than v2 supply not in this manner. amount and so forth can appropriately changed according user operations or like same manner as for charging></v1>
Referring to FIG. 4, there is shown the configuration of the cooling mechanism (temperature control mechanism) 510 mounted on the fuel cell vehicle 100.<br>
As is generally known, heat is generated as the fuel tank 130 is<br>
refueled (filled) with hydrogen gas.   To discharge the heat generated during refueling of the fuel tank 130 with the hydrogen gas, the cooling mechanism 510 as shown in FIG. 4 is mounted on the fuel cell vehicle 100 in this embodiment.<br>
The cooling mechanism 510 includes an air compressor 511 for blowing air into a cathode of the fuel cell, a three-way valve 512, a condenser 513, and a compressor 514.   The air compressor 511 is supplied with power from the high voltage battery 140 and supplies air to the fuel cell, while the three-way valve 512 changes the destination to which the air discharged from the air compressor 511 is supplied between the fuel cell position and the condenser position.   To cool down the fuel tank 130, the three-way valve 512 is switched to the condenser position.    In this embodiment, refrigerant is condensed in the condenser 513 by using the pressure of the air supplied by the switching to the condenser position and the temperature of the refrigerant is lowered by evaporating the refrigerant in an evaporator, which is not shown. By employing the above configuration, the compressor 514 for circulating the refrigerant or other devices can be reduced in size.   This configuration is illustrated only and what kind of cooling mechanism should be employed can be appropriately changed according to the design or the like of the fuel cell vehicle 100.<br>
While the cooling mechanism 510 has been described hereinabove as an example of the auxiliary machines 500 operated during refueling, the same applies to the air conditioner 520 and the sensors 530.    More specifically, in cases where refueling takes time, the ambient temperature in the vehicle rises if the air conditioner 520 is turned off.   Therefore, it is necessary to allow the air conditioner 520 to continue to be operated in order to maintain a comfortable temperature in the vehicle.    Furthermore, in order to grasp the temperature or pressure of the fuel tank 130 or the states of the various batteries during<br>
refueling, it is necessary to allow the various sensors 530 for sensing these states to continue to be operated.<br>
While there is a need to operate the various auxiliary machines 500 during refueling as described above, power is supplied as well as fuel during refueling of the fuel cell vehicle 100 from the refueling facility 200 according to the refueling system 300 of this embodiment, and therefore it becomes possible to improve the performance stability of the fuel cell vehicle 100 after refueling or the like.    In other words, it is possible to prevent such a problem that the vehicle cannot be started after refueling since the battery runs out due to the operation of the auxiliary machines 500 during the refueling.   Although it is assumed that refueling is performed substantially simultaneously with power supply in the above embodiment, the refueling and the power supply can also be performed at different timings.    In addition, the high voltage battery 140 can be used, instead of the low voltage battery 180, as the power supply source for supplying power to the auxiliary machines 500.<br>
B. Second embodiment<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, there is shown the configuration of a refueling facility 200' according to a second embodiment.    Referring to FIG. 6, there is shown the configuration of a refueling device (fuel device) of a fuel cell vehicle 100' according to the second embodiment.    Regarding the refueling facility 200' shown in FIG. 5 and the fuel cell vehicle 100' shown in FIG. 6, the same reference numerals are used to denote corresponding parts to those of the refueling facility 200 shown in FIG. 2 and those of the fuel cell vehicle 100 shown in FIG. 3 and their detailed description is omitted here.<br>
The refueling facility 200' is provided with a status signal line 21 for sending or receiving a status signal to or from the fuel cell vehicle 100.    One<br>
end of the status signal line 21 is connected to a controller 230 and the other end (the forward end of the status signal line 21) is connected to a supply connector 240.    In other words, a refueling connector, a power supply connector, and a status signal connector are integrated into the supply connector 240.<br>
On the other hand, the fuel cell vehicle 100' is provided with a status signal line 11 for sending or receiving a status signal to or from the refueling facility 200'.    One end of the status signal line 11 is connected to a control device 190 and the other end (the forward end of the status signal line 11) is connected to a fuel receptacle 110.    In other words, a refueling connector, a power supply connector, and a status signal connector are integrated into the fuel receptacle 110.   The status signal includes, for example, a signal indicating the temperature or pressure of a fuel tank 130, a signal indicating the state of charge (SOC) of a high voltage battery 140 or a low voltage battery 180, and a signal indicating the operating state of each of auxiliary machines 500. What kind of signals should be sent or received to or from the refueling facility 200' can be appropriately changed.<br>
Upon connection between the fuel receptacle 110 of the fuel cell vehicle 100' and the supply connector 240 of the refueling facility 200' in the above configuration, a connection is established between the status signal lines 11 and 21 as well as between refueling paths 111 and 211 and between power supply paths 121 and 221.   The controller 230 of the refueling facility 200' determines the amounts of fuel and power supplied and refueling timing, for example, based on the status signals indicating the temperature and pressure of the fuel tank 130 of the fuel cell vehicle 100', the states of charge of the high voltage battery 140 and the low voltage battery 180, the operating state of each of the auxiliary machines 500, and so forth, which are supplied via the status<br>
signal line 21 and starts the refueling and power supply according to the determined contents.<br>
In this manner it is also possible to control the amounts of fuel and power supplied, the refueling timing, and so forth by sending or receiving the status signals between the refueling facility 200' and the fuel cell vehicle 100'. While the present invention has been described by way of the above embodiment in which the refueling facility 200' and the fuel cell vehicle 100' are provided with only the status signal line 11 and the status signal line 21, respectively, it is also possible to provide them with ground wires 12 and 22 (see FIG. 5 and FIG. 6), respectively, in addition to these status signal lines. This enables secure grounding during refueling.<br>
C. Others<br>
The functions of the controller 230 of the refueling facilities 200 and 200' and the control device 190 of the fuel cell vehicles 100 and 100' according to the embodiments described hereinabove are achieved by executing a program stored in a memory by a CPU (or a DSP).   Therefore, the program can be recorded in a recording medium such as a CD-ROM and distributed or can be distributed via a communication network such as the Internet.<br>
The present invention is useful in that it can improve the performance stability of a moving object after refueling or the like and it can be widely used for refueling facilities and refueling devices required to improve the performance stability.<br><br>
