				<td>SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL AND SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This application claims benefit of priority of US provisional<br>
application 60/357,636 filed on February 20, 2002, which is incorporated<br>
by reference in its entirety. The present invention is directed generally to<br>
fuel cells and more particularly to solid oxide fuel cells and power<br>
generation systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Fuel cells generate electricity from hydrogen or various<br>
hydrocarbon fuels. In some fuel cells, an oxygen containing gas, such as<br>
air, is provided onto the cathode side of the electrolyte, while hydrogen or<br>
a hydrocarbon fuel is provided onto the anode side of the electrolyte. The<br>
fuel cell generates electricity through an electrochemical reaction. For<br>
example, in a solid oxide fuel cell, oxygen containing air is provided onto<br>
the cathode side of a solid ceramic electrolyte, while a hydrocarbon fuel is<br>
provided onto the anode side of the electrolyte.<br>
[0003] Fuel cells operate more efficiently when the oxygen content<br>
of the inlet air is higher, primarily because the Nernst potential of the cell<br>
increases when the partial pressure of oxygen is higher. Therefore, the<br>
oxygen content of air being provided into the fuel cell is sometimes<br>
increased or enriched using various processes, including pressure swing<br>
adsorption (e.g., QuestAir Inc.'s Pulsar technology), oxygen-selective<br>
membranes (e.g., Boyer et al., J. Appl. Electrochem., p.1095, 1999), or<br>
magnetic separation devices (e.g., Nitta et al., U.S. Patent 6,106,963,<br>
incorporated herein by reference in the entirety). However, these<br>
methods are generally inefficient because they require the use of power<br><br>
,..e., electricity), thus decreasing the efficiency of the fuel cell and the<br>
power generation system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
1. The First Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0016] In a first preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
inventors have realized that the oxygen content of air being provided into<br>
the fuel cell can be increased using a temperature sensitive adsorDtion<br>
cycle. Preferably, the temperature sensitive adsorption cycle utilizes the<br>
heat generated by the fuel cell during power generation. The use of heat<br>
generated by a fuel cell for increasing the oxygen content of the inlet air<br>
stream in a cyclical adsorption separation process increases the efficiency<br>
of power generation. However, heat generated by means other than the<br>
fuel cell may be used instead.<br>
[0017] In the temperature sensitive adsorption process, an air<br>
stream (a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen) is passed through a cool<br>
adsorbent medium that selectively removes a fraction of the nitrogen,<br>
resulting in a gas stream that has a higher oxygen content than the '<br>
original stream. When the adsorbent is saturated with nitrogen under the<br>
process conditions, heat generated from the fuel cell operation or from,<br>
another source is transferred to the adsorbent medium, .and the nitrogen<br>
is driven out of the adsorbent medium through a vent. Thus, a separation<br>
is effected.<br>
[0018] Figure 1 schematically illustrates the temperature sensitive<br>
oxygen enrichment system 1. The system includes an air source 3, an<br>
adsorbent medium 5 and a fuel cell 7. The air source 3 may be an air<br>
blower, an air inlet conduit and/or any other device which provides air into<br>
the adsorbent medium 5. The adsorbent medium 5 may be any medium<br>
which selectively adsorbs nitrogen compared to oxygen. Preferably, the<br>
adsorbent medium 5 is a bed containing a nitrogen adsorbing material,<br>
such as a zeolite or a mixture of zeolites. For example, silver X, sodium X<br>
or calcium A zeolites may be used. The fuel cell 7 may be any fuel cell<br>
into which air is provided. Preferably, the fuel cell 7 is a solid oxide fuel<br>
cell. However, other fuel cells, such as PEM, direct methanol, molten-<br>
carbonate, phosphoric acid or alkaline fuel cells may be used<br>
[0019] The system 1 also preferably contains a heat transfer conduit<br>
9 located between the fuel cell 7 and the adsorbent medium 5. The<br>
conduit 9 transfers heat from the fuel cell 7 to the adsorbent medium 5.<br>
The conduit 9 may comprise any device than may transfer heat from one<br>
location to another. For example, the conduit 9 may comprise a pipe, a<br>
duct, a space between walls or even a solid heat transfer material.<br>
Preferably the conduit 9 is a pipe which transfers a heat transfer fluid<br>
through the system 1.<br>
[0020] An air inlet 11 is located in the adsorbent medium 5 housing.<br>
The inlet provides air from the air source 3 into the adsorbent medium. 5.<br>
An oxygen enriched air conduit 13 is located between the adsorbent<br>
medium 5 and the fuel cell 7. The conduit 13 may be pipe, duct or open<br>
space which provides oxygen enriched air from the adsorbent medium 5<br>
to the fuel cell 7.<br>
[0021] In one preferred aspect of the first embodiment, the heat<br>
transfer conduit 9 comprises a pipe which is located adjacent to the fuel<br>
cell 7, adjacent to a heat sink 15 and adjacent to the adsorbent medium<br>
5. For example, as shown in Figure 2, the conduit 9 is wrapped around<br>
the housing of the adsorbent medium 5 and around the fuel cell 7. The<br>
conduit 9 also passes through the heat sink 15. The heat transfer<br>
conduit 9 transfers a heated heat transfer liquid, such as water, from<br>
adjacent to the fuel cell 7 to the adsorbent medium 5. The heated heat<br>
transfer liquid heats the adsorbent medium 5 to desorb nitrogen from the<br>
adsorbent medium 5. The heat transfer conduit 9 also transfers a cooled<br>
heat transfer liquid, such as water, from adjacent to the heat sink 15 to<br>
the adsorbent medium 5. The cooled heat transfer liquid cools the<br>
adsorbent medium 5, which allows the adsorbent medium 5 to adsorb<br>
nitrogen from air that is being provided from inlet 11.<br>
[0022] The operation of the heat transfer conduit 9 illustrated in<br>
Figure 2 will now be described in more detail. The conduit 9 is filled with<br>
a heat transfer liquid. This liquid may be any liquid which is capable of<br>
transferring heat. Preferably, this liquid is water. However, other liquids,<br>
such as mineral oil, etc., or even heat transfer gases may be used. The<br>
liquid is provided through conduit 9 and through at least one valve.<br>
Preferably, the conduit 9 contains an outlet valve 17 and an inlet valve<br>
19. However, only one of these two valves may be used. The outlet<br>
valve 1 7 is preferably a three way valve which directs the liquid either<br>
through a first segment 21 of the conduit 9, through a second segment<br>
23 of the conduit 9, or prevents liquid flow through the conduit 9. If<br>
liquid is provided through the first segment 21 which is located adjacent<br>
to the fuel cell 7, then the liquid is heated by the heat generated in the<br>
fuel cell 7. For example, "located adjacent" means that the first segment<br>
21 of the conduit 9 is wrapped around the fuel cell 7 or a stack of fuel<br>
cells if more than one fuel cell is used. However, "located adjacent" also<br>
includes any other configuration of segment 21 which allows the fuel cell<br>
7 to heat the liquid in the segment 21. For example, the segment 21 may<br>
be located in contact with one or more surfaces of the fuel cell 7 or<br>
segment 21 may be located near the fuel cell, rather than being wrapped<br>
around the fuel cell.<br>
[0023] The heated heat transfer liquid is then provided from the first<br>
segment 21 through the inlet valve 19 into the portion of conduit 9 that is<br>
located adjacent to the adsorbent medium 5. For example, "located<br>
adjacent" means that the conduit 9 is wrapped around the housing of the<br>
adsorbent medium 5. However, "located adjacent" also includes any<br>
other configuration of conduit 9 which allows the heat transfer liquid to<br>
heat the adsorbent medium 5. For example, the conduit 9 may be located<br>
in contact with one or more surfaces of the adsorbent medium 5 or<br>
conduit 9 may be located near the adsorbent medium 5, rather than being<br>
wrapped around it. The heated heat transfer Jiquid heats the adsorbent<br>
medium 5 and desorbs the nitrogen adsorbed in the adsorbent medium 5.<br>
[0024] When it is desired to coo! the adsorbent medium 5, then the<br>
valves 17 and 19 are switched to provide the heat transfer fluid through a<br>
second segment 23 of the conduit 9. The second segment 23 is located<br>
adjacent to a heat sink 15. The heat sink 15 may comprise any thing<br>
which can cool the liquid in the second segment 23 of the conduit 9. For<br>
example, the heat sink 15 may be a cooling tower, a heat exchanger, a<br>
radiator with cool air, a cold air blower or even a portion of segment 23<br>
which runs through the cool ground or wall. The segment 23 may pass<br>
through the heat sink 15 or be placed in contact with or adjacent to the<br>
heat sink 1 5, depending on what type of heat sink is used.<br>
[0025] The cooled heat transfer liquid is then provided from the<br>
second segment 23 through the inlet valve 19 into the portion of conduit<br>
9 that is located adjacent to the adsorbent medium 5. The cooled heat<br>
transfer fluid cools the adsorbent medium 5 while air from inlet 11 is<br>
passing through the adsorbent medium 5 to desorb nitrogen from the air.<br>
[0026] As shown in Figure 2, the heat transfer liquid is provided<br>
through the conduit 9 in a closed control loop. The system 1 of Figure 2<br>
operates in a batch or non-continuous mode. Thus, when air is provided<br>
from the air source 3 through the adsorbent medium 5 into the fuel cell 7,<br>
the heat transfer liquid is passed through the second segment 23 adjacent<br>
to the heat sink 15. The cooled heat transfer jiquid cools the adsorbent<br>
medium 5 to adsorb the nitrogen from the air. When no air is provided<br>
from the air source 3 through the adsorbent medium 5 into the fuel cell 7,<br>
the heat transfer liquid is passed through the first segment 21 adjacent to<br>
the fuel cell 7. The heated heat transfer liquid heats the adsorbent<br>
medium 5 to desorb the nitrogen.<br>
[0027] However, in a second preferred aspect of the first<br>
embodiment, the system 1 operates in a continuous mode. To operate in<br>
a continuous mode, the system 100 contains two or more adsorbent<br>
mediums 5A, 5B, as shown in Figure 3. In Figure 3, elements with like<br>
numbers to elements in Figures 1-2 are presumed to be the same. In the<br>
preferred aspect of Figure 3, while one adsorbent medium 5A is used to<br>
adsorb nitrogen to oxygen enrich the air being provided into the fuel cell,<br>
the other adsorbent medium 5B is heated by the heat from the fuel cell to<br>
desorb the nitrogen from the adsorbent medium 5B.<br>
[0028] The system 100 shown in Figure 3 contains the following<br>
elements. The system 100 contains one or more air sources 3, such as<br>
blowers, and a plurality of adsorbent mediums 5A, 5B which selectively<br>
adsorb nitrogen compared to oxygen. While only two mediums are<br>
shown in Figure 3, there may be more than two mediums if desired. The<br>
system 100 also contains a plurality of heat transfer conduits 9A, 9B<br>
which transfer heat from the fuel cell (not shown in Figure 3 for clarity) to<br>
the plurality of adsorbent mediums 5A, 5B. The conduits 9A, 9B are<br>
located between the fuel cell and the plurality of adsorbent mediums 5A,<br>
5B.<br>
[0029] There are also a plurality of air inlets 11 A, 11B into the<br>
plurality of adsorbent mediums 5A, 5B, and a plurality of outlets 13A,<br>
13B (i.e., a plurality of oxygen enriched air conduits) which provide<br>
oxygen enriched air from the plurality of adsorbent mediums 5A, 5B to<br>
the fuel cell. The conduits 13A, 13B are located between the plurality of<br>
adsorbent mediums 5A, 5B and the fuel cell.<br>
[0030] Preferably, the system 100 contains seven three way valves,<br>
as will be described in more detail below. However, more or less than<br>
seven valves may be used as desired. The system 100 contains least<br>
one inlet selector valve 27 located between the air source 3 and the<br>
plurality of adsorbent mediums 5A, 5B. The inlet selector valve 27<br>
directs air from the air source 3 into either a first adsorbent medium 5A or<br>
into a second adsorbent medium 5B.<br>
[0031] The system 100 also contains at least one outlet selector<br>
valve 29 located between the plurality of adsorbent mediums 5A, 5B and<br>
the fuel cell. The outlet selector valve 29 directs oxygen enriched air<br>
into the fuel cell through oxygen enriched air conduits 13A, 13B, 13C<br>
from either the first adsorbent medium 5A or from the second adsorbent<br>
medium 5B.<br>
[00321 The system 100 contains at least one venting selector valve<br>
31 located between the air source 3 and the plurality of adsorbent<br>
mediums 5A, 5B. The venting selector valve 31 directs desorbed<br>
nitrogen to be vented through vent 25 from either the second adsorbent<br>
medium 5B or from the first adsorbent medium 5A.<br>
[0033] At least one connecting conduit 33 is provided such that it<br>
connects a plurality of oxygen enriched air conduits 1 3A, 13B. The<br>
connecting conduit 33 directs purging air from one of the first or the<br>
second adsorbent medium to the other one of the first or the second<br>
adsorbent medium to purge the nitrogen from the receiving medium.<br>
Preferably, the conduit 33 contains one or more flow restrictors 35. The<br>
restrictors 35 restrict the flow of oxygen enriched air, such that the<br>
majority of the oxygen enriched air exiting an adsorbent medium is<br>
directed to the fuel cell through conduit 13C, rather than through the<br>
connecting conduit 33.<br>
[0034] The system 100 contains at least one heat transfer fluid inlet<br>
valve 37A, 37B located in the heat transfer fluid conduits 9A, 9B.<br>
Preferably there are two such valves as shown in Figure 3. Valve 37A<br><br>
directs heated heat transfer fluid to the one of the adsorbent mediums<br>
5A, 5B from the fuel cell stack, while valve 37B directs cooied heat<br>
transfer fluid to another one of the adsorbent mediums 5A, 5B from the<br>
heat sink.<br>
[0035] Furthermore, the system 100 contains at least one heat<br>
transfer fluid outlet valve 39A, 39B located in the heat transfer fluid<br>
conduits 9A, 9B. Preferably there are two such valves as shown in Figure<br>
3. Valve 39A directs heated heat transfer fluid from the adsorbent<br>
mediums to the heat sink, while valve 39B directs cooled heat transfer<br>
fluid from the adsorbent mediums to the fuel cell.<br>
[0036] Thus, the conduits 9A, 9B actually comprise two segments<br>
of one common conduit 9. For example, the output of conduit 9A is<br>
provided through valve 39B, the fuel cell stack and valve 37A to input of<br>
conduit 9B, while the output of conduit 9B is provided through valve 39A,<br>
the heat sink and valve 37B to input of conduit 9A. However, the valves<br>
37A, 37B and 39A, 39B may be set such that the conduits 9A and 9B<br>
remain separate, as will be discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0037] The method of operating system 100 will now be described<br>
with respect to Figures 3 and 4. As shown in Figure 3, the valves are set<br>
to allow the first adsorbent medium 5A to provide oxygen enriched air<br>
into the fuel cell, while the nitrogen is desorbed from the second<br>
adsorbent medium 5B. The first adsorbent medium 5A is cooled by a cool<br>
heat transfer fluid in conduit 9A, while the second adsorbent medium 5B<br>
is heated by a hot heat transfer fluid in conduit 9B.<br>
[0038] Then, after some time, the valve positions are switched as<br>
shown in Figure 4. As shown in Figure 4, the vaives are set to allow the<br>
second adsorbent medium 5B to provide oxygen enriched air into the fuel<br>
cell, while the nitrogen is desorbed from the first adsorbent medium 5A.<br><br>
The second adsorbent medium 5B is cooled by a cool heat transfer fluid in<br>
conduit 9B, while the first adsorbent medium 5A is heated by a hot heat<br>
transfer fluid in conduit 9A. Thus, the system 100 can operate in a<br>
continuous rather than in a batch mode. At least one adsorbent medium<br>
may be used to provide oxygen enriched air into the fuel cell, while<br>
another adsorbent medium may be heated and purged to desorb nitrogen<br>
adsorbed therein.<br>
[0039] The operation of the system 100 as shown in Figure 3 will<br>
now be described in detail. Air from the air source 3 is directed to the<br>
inlet selector valve 27, which directs air into at least one of plurality of<br>
adsorbent mediums. For example the valve 27 directs the air into the first<br>
adsorbent medium 5A but not into the second adsorbent medium 5B.<br>
The first adsorbent medium 5A is cooled by the heat transfer fluid in the<br>
first heat transfer conduit 9A, and first adsorbent medium 5A selectively<br>
adsorbs nitrogen from the air. The oxygen enriched air exits the first<br>
adsorbent medium 5A and is selectively directed to the fuel cell through<br>
the oxygen enriched air conduits 13A, 13C and the outlet selector valve<br>
29. The inlet selector valve 27 prevents air from flowing from the air<br>
source 3 into the second adsorbent medium 5B. Furthermore, the outlet<br>
selector valve 29 prevents flow from the second adsorbent medium 5B to<br>
the fuel cell. Thus, no oxygen enriched air flows from the second<br>
adsorbent medium 5B into the fuel cell.<br>
[0040] A portion of the oxygen enriched air flows from the first<br>
adsorbent medium 5A through conduit 1 3A, the connecting conduit 33<br>
and the conduit 13B into the second adsorbent medium 5B. The flow<br>
restrictor(s) 35 in the connecting conduit 33 ensure that only a small<br>
portion of the oxygen enriched air flows into the second adsorbent<br>
medium 5B. This oxygen enriched air from the first adsorbent medium 5A<br>
is used as purging air for the second adsorbent medium 5B to purge the<br><br>
nitrogen from the second adsorbent medium 5B. The second adsorbent<br>
medium 5B is heated by the heated heat transfer fluid in the conduit 9B to<br>
desorb the nitrogen in the second adsorbent medium 5B while the purging<br>
air is passing through the second adsorbent medium 5B. The desorbed<br>
nitrogen is selectively directed to be vented from the second adsorbent<br>
medium but not from the first adsorbent medium by the venting selector<br>
valve 31.<br>
[0041] The heat transfer fluid is directed in the system 100 shown<br>
in Figure 3 as follows. The heat transfer fluid is passed through a heat<br>
smk to cool the heat transfer fluid. The cooled heat transfer fluid is<br>
selectively directed to the first adsorbent medium 5A through the "cool<br>
inlet" in the heat transfer fluid inlet valve 37B and through conduit 9A.<br>
[0042] Then, the cooled heat transfer fluid from the first adsorbent<br>
medium 5A is selectively directed through conduit 9A and through the<br>
"cool outlet" in the heat transfer fluid outlet valve 39B to the fuel cell.<br>
The heat transfer fluid from valve 39B is passed adjacent to the fuel cell<br>
to heat the heat transfer fluid.<br>
[0043] The heated heat transfer fluid is then selectively directed to<br>
the second adsorbent medium 5B through the "hot inlet" in the heat<br>
transfer fluid inlet valve 37A and through conduit 9B. Then, the heated<br>
heat transfer fluid from the second adsorbent medium 5B is selectively<br>
directed through conduit 9B and through the "hot outlet" in the heat<br>
transfer fluid outlet valve 39A to the heat sink.<br>
[0044] The operation of the system 100 as shown in Figure 4 will<br>
now be described in detail. All of the valves in Figure 4 are set to provide<br>
flow in the opposite direction from Figure 3. Air from the air source 3 is<br>
directed to the inlet selector valve 27 which directs the air into the<br>
second adsorbent medium 5B but not into the first adsorbent medium 5A.<br><br>
The second adsorbent medium 5B is cooled by the heat transfer fluid in<br>
the second heat transfer conduit 9B, and the second adsorbent medium<br>
5B selectively adsorbs nitrogen from the air. The oxygen enriched air<br>
exits the second adsorbent medium 5B and is selectively directed to the<br>
fuel cell through the oxygen enriched air conduits 13B, 13C and the outlet<br>
selector valve 29. The inlet selector valve 27 prevents air from flowing<br>
from the air source 3 into the first adsorbent medium 5A. Furthermore,<br>
the outlet selector valve 29 prevents flow from the first adsorbent<br>
medium 5A to the fuel cell. Thus, no oxygen enriched air flows from the<br>
first adsorbent medium 5A into the fuel cell.<br>
[0045] A portion of the oxygen enriched air flows from the second<br>
adsorbent medium 5B through conduit 13B, the connecting conduit 33<br>
and the conduit 13A into the first adsorbent medium 5A. The flow<br>
restrictor(s) 35 in the connecting conduit ensure that only a small portion<br>
of the oxygen enriched air flows into the first adsorbent medium 5A. This<br>
oxygen enriched air from the second adsorbent medium 5B is used as<br>
purging air for the first adsorbent medium 5A to purge the nitrogen from<br>
the first adsorbent medium 5A. The first adsorbent medium 5A is heated<br>
by the heated heat transfer fluid in the conduit 9A to desorb the nitrogen<br>
in the first adsorbent medium 5A while the purging air is passing through<br>
the first adsorbent medium 5A. The desorbed nitrogen is selectively<br>
directed to be vented from the first adsorbent medium but not from the<br>
second adsorbent medium by the venting selector valve 31.<br>
[0046] The heat transfer fluid is directed in the system 100 shown<br>
in Figure 4 as follows. The heat transfer fluid is passed through a heat<br>
sink to cool the heat transfer fluid. The cooled heat transfer fluid is<br>
selectively directed to the second adsorbent medium 5B through the heat<br>
transfer fluid inlet valve 37B and conduit 9B.<br>
[0047] Then, the cooled heat transfer fluid from the second<br>
adsorbent medium 5B is selectively directed through conduit 9B and the<br>
heat transfer fluid outlet valve 39B to the fuel cell. The heat transfer fluid<br>
from valve 39B is passed adjacent to the fuel cell to heat the heat<br>
transfer fluid.<br>
[0048] The heated heat transfer fluid is then selectively directed to<br>
the first adsorbent medium 5A through the heat transfer fluid inlet valve<br>
37A and conduit 9A. Then, the heated heat transfer fluid from the<br>
second adsorbent medium 5A is selectively directed through conduit 9A<br>
and the heat transfer fluid outlet valve 39A to the heat sink.<br>
[0049] Therefore, conduits 9A and 9B comprise segments of the<br>
same conduit because the heat transfer fluid makes a complete loop<br>
through the system 100. However, if desired, the valves 37A, 37B, 39A<br>
and 39B may be set such that the heated heat transfer fluid returns to the<br>
fuel cell after heating one adsorbent medium, while the cooled heat<br>
transfer fluid returns to the heat sink after cooling the other adsorbent<br>
medium.<br>
[0050] It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to<br>
the system 100 illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. Several adsorbent<br>
mediums (i.e., beds containing adsorbent medium) can be connected in<br>
various different ways to achieve the desired oxygen enrichment<br>
continuously.<br>
[0051] Figure 5 illustrates another system 200 according to a third<br>
preferred aspect of the first embodiment. The system 200 of Figure 5 is<br>
similar to the system 100 of Figures 3 and 4, except that the adsorbent<br>
mediums 5A, 5B are heated by the hot air emitted by the fuel cell 7,<br>
rather than by a heat transfer liquid.<br>
[0052] As shown in Figure 5 the air is provided from inlet 11 A into<br>
the first adsorbent medium 5A. In the adsorbent medium 5A, nitrogen is<br>
adsorbed, and oxygen enriched air is provided through conduits 13A, 13C<br>
and valve 29 into the cathode side input of the fuel cell 7. No air is<br>
provided into the second adsorbent medium 5B from inlet 11B due to the<br>
position of valve 27 in Figure 5, similar to that of the system 100<br>
illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
[0053] The heat transfer conduit 9 is connected to the cathode side<br>
output of the fuel cell 7. The hot air exits the cathode side output of the<br>
fuel cell 7 and enters the conduit 9. The hot air then reaches a hot air<br>
selector valve 41 which directs the hot air into a first segment 9A or a<br>
second segment 9B of the conduit 9. As shown in Figure 5, the valve 41<br>
is set to direct the hot air into the second segment 9B.<br>
[0054] Since the second segment 9B is located adjacent to the<br>
second adsorbent medium 5B, the heated air from the fuel cell 7 heats<br>
the second adsorbent medium 5B to desorb nitrogen from the adsorbent<br>
medium. After the hot air passes through conduit 9B, the air is either<br>
vented through vent 43B or reused for some other purpose.<br>
[0055] When the second adsorbent medium 5B is used to provide<br>
oxygen enriched air into the fuel cell 7, then the position of the valves 27,<br>
31, 29 and 41 is reversed (similar to that shown in Figure 4), and the first<br>
adsorbent medium 5A is heated by the hot air from the fuel cell 7 to<br>
desorb the nitrogen from the first adsorbent medium 5A. The hot air is<br>
then vented through vent 43A or put to some other use.<br>
[0056] In Figure 5, the fuel cell 7 also contains a fuel input 45 on<br>
the anode side and a fuel output 47 on the anode side. In use, the<br>
adsorbent mediums 5A, 5B may be cooled by external air or by another<br>
heat transfer conduit (not shown in Figure 5) to adsorb the nitrogen from<br><br>
the in passing from inlets 11A, 11B through the adsorbent mediums 5A,<br>
5B into conduits 13A, 13B. Thus, the heat transfer gas (i.e., hot air) is<br>
provided in an open loop in Figure 5 and the system 200 operates in a<br>
continuous mode.<br>
[0057] In each of these embodiments, conditioning of the incoming air<br>
may be valuable. For example, the inlet air may be dried, heated, or<br>
cooled depending on its initial state.<br>
[0058] It is desirable to select the adsorbent material to optimize<br>
both gas separation and rapid heat transfer. The pressure drop through<br>
the bed should be minimized in order to reduce the capital and operating<br>
costs of the blower. Thus, the particle size, bed geometry, and overall<br>
system layout and design may be optimized to minimize the pressure<br>
drop. The adsorbent material in different beds may be the same or<br>
different depending on the system requirements.<br>
[0059] For example, in one case an oxygen enrichment system may<br>
consist of three adsorbent beds operating in parallel, similar to the two<br>
beds shown in Figure 2. Each bed will contain 1 kg of AgX zeolite pellets<br>
with a standard mesh size of 20x30. The beds will have a parallelipiped<br>
geometry and will contain a network of heat transfer surfaces, preferably<br>
made of metal foam.<br>
[0060] It should be noted that the temperature sensitive adsorption<br>
process to enrich the oxygen content of air of the first embodiment is not<br>
limited to providing oxygen enriched air to a fuel cell. This process may<br>
be used to provide oxygen enriched air for any other suitable use. For<br>
example, the efficiency of a combustion process (such as a gas turbine)<br>
may increase if the inlet air is oxygen-enriched as inert nitrogen will not<br>
need to be heated.<br>
II. The Second Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0061] High powered electrical appliances pose challenges for<br>
thermal management. Large electrical power consumers such as co-<br>
located computers or' fabrication machinery dissipate most of the<br>
electrical energy provided as heat. In order to maintain appropriate<br>
operating conditions this heat needs to be removed. In conventional<br>
arrangements, where electrical power is supplied through the grid,<br>
electrical power is required to drive the appliances and to operate a<br>
cooling mechanism. Certain distributed power systems offer new<br>
perspectives. Power generators such as solid oxide fuel cells provide<br>
electrical power and high quality waste heat. This heat can be utilized to<br>
drive a cooling device, thereby reducing the electrical power requirement.<br>
The inventors have realized that appropriate choice of the equipment<br>
involved can provide a system where electrical power requirements and<br>
cooling requirements can be ideally matched.<br>
[0062] In a second preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the inventors have realized that a power generator, which includes a fuel<br>
cell, such as a solid oxide fuel cell, a heat pump, and an electrical power<br>
consuming appliance, such as a computer, form an ideally matched<br>
system with respect to electrical power requirements and cooling<br>
requirements.<br>
[0063] Solid oxide fuel cells typically generate approximately the<br>
same amount of heat as electrical power. This heat is available at<br>
elevated temperatures, usually in the range of 250°C to 1000°C, and is<br>
suitable to drive a heat driven heat pump.<br>
[0064] There are heat driven heat pumps, which have an efficiency<br>
of approximately unity. An efficiency of unity implies that the heat pump<br>
can remove the same amount of heat which is supplied to drive the heat<br>
pump. It is important to note that the heat streams involved are of<br>
different temperature. The heat stream from the fuel cell to the heat<br>
driven heat pump is provided at a higher temperature than the heat<br>
stream from the cooling load (in this case an electrical appliance) into the<br>
heat driven heat pump.<br>
[0065] The electrical power supplied by the fuel cell is consumed by<br>
an appliance. Part of the electrical power supplied to an appliance is<br>
dissipated as heat. A close look at this part of the system reveals that all<br>
of the electrical power supplied to the appliance, which is not stored in<br>
the appliance or transmitted from the appliance beyond the system<br>
boundaries is dissipated. For most appliances, such as computers or<br>
machinery, only a small fraction of the power supplied is transmitted<br>
beyond system boundaries and most of the electrical energy supplied is<br>
dissipated as heat. The dissipated heat needs to be removed in order to<br>
avoid excessive temperatures within the appliance.<br>
[0066] The inventors have realized that the system described above<br>
has the extremely convenient feature of matching cooling loads with<br>
electrical loads. The combination of the heat driven heat pump with the<br>
solid oxide fuel cell provides electrical supply and cooling capacity<br>
matching the requirements of many electrical appliances. Such a system<br>
is convenient, because it requires neither additional cooling devices, nor<br>
additional electrical power of significance (i.e., over 10% of the total<br>
power) to be incorporated. Careful selection of the power generator and<br>
the heat driven heat pump can provide matched cooling and heating for a<br>
variety of applications. The power generator can also be a combination of<br>
a solid oxide fuel cell and a gas turbine, such as a bottoming cycle gas<br>
turbine.<br>
[0067] Additionally, the amount of cooling and electrical power<br>
provided can be adjusted by selecting the appropriate operating conditions<br>
for the fuel cell. If for example the fuel cell is supplied with an excess of<br>
fuel, more high temperature heat can be created and thereby more cooling<br>
power. This adjustment can be especially important in situations where<br>
additional heat loads need to be removed. One example for an additional<br>
heat load is heating of the conditioned appliance due to high ambient air<br>
temperatures (i.e. hot climate zones).<br>
[0068] Another preferred option is heating of appliances or thermally<br>
conditioned space with the heat pump. For example in cold climate zones<br>
heating can be crucial to the operation of appliances or for the personnel<br>
operating the appliances. A heat driven heat pump can extremely<br>
efficiently provide heating.<br>
[0069] A variety of fuels can be used in the power generator.<br>
Examples for gaseous fuel are hydrogen, biologically produced gas,<br>
natural gas, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and propane.<br>
Liquid fuels can also be used. The system can also be adapted to solid<br>
fuels.<br>
[0070] Figure 6 schematically illustrates the system of the second<br>
preferred embodiment. The system contains an electrical power generator<br>
2, a heat driven heat pump 4, an appliance 6, and a heat sink 8. The<br>
electrical power generator 2 can be a solid oxide fuel cell. It can also be a<br>
solid oxide fuel cell combined with a gas turbine. Other power generators,<br>
such as molten carbonate fuel cells, which also provide high temperature<br>
heat in addition to electrical power, can also be used. The heat driven<br>
heat pump 4 can be an absorbtion chiller, such as a LiBr-Water or an<br>
ammonia-water heat pump. Heat driven heat pumps use high temperature<br>
heat to provide cooling (i.e. absorb heat at a low temperature), and reject<br>
heat at an intermediate temperature. Compared to conventional Rankine-<br>
cycle cooling devices, they require only a small amount of electrical or<br>
mechanical power. A description of heat driven heat pumps can be found<br>
in Bernard D. Woods, "Applications of Thermodynamics", Waveland<br>
Press, Inc., Prospect Heights, Illinois, Second Edition, 1991, incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[0071] Another class of heat driven heat pumps suitable for this<br>
embodiment is adsorption heat pumps. In an adsorption heat pump the<br>
refrigerant, which is usually a gas, interacts with a solid. Adsorption and<br>
desorption of the refrigerant on/from the solid provide pressurization of<br>
the refrigerant. High pressure desorption of the refrigerant is<br>
accomplished using high temperature heat. In the high-pressure portion of<br>
the refrigerant loop, heat is rejected and in the low pressure portion heat<br>
is absorbed. Adsorption heat pumps can be realized as solid state devices<br>
without the need to handle liquids. This can be advantageous for example<br>
in environments where handling of the liquids commonly involved in<br>
absorption heat pumps is too hazardous. Environmentally friendly gases/<br>
vapors can be used in the adsorption heat pump.<br>
[0072] The appliance 6 is a device that consumes electrical power<br>
for any purpose and generates heat (appliance cooling load), mostly as a<br>
parasitic loss, which needs to be removed. One preferred example for this<br>
appliance is a computer or a cluster of computers co-located in a data<br>
center.<br>
[0073] A heat sink 8 for the system can be a large body of solid,<br>
liquid or gas. For example the heat sink can comprise, a cooling tower,<br>
ambient atmospheric air, soil, or a stream of water.<br>
[0074] Also shown in Figure 6 are the energies exchanged between<br>
the subsystems. The electrical power 1 2 provided by the electrical power<br><br>
generator 2 to the appliance 6 can be transferred using electrical wire, but<br>
other electrical power transfer mechanisms can also be used. The high<br>
temperature heat 1 0 is generated by the electrical power generator 2 and<br>
consumed by the heat driven heat pump 4. The high temperature heat 10<br>
can be transported with a pumped fluid loop, such as a liquid loop, in<br>
which the fluid absorbs heat in or near the electrical power generator 2<br>
and releases heat to the heat driven heat pump 4. Generally, this heat<br>
transfer can be accomplished by any heat transfer mechanism (i.e.<br>
conduction, convection, radiation, or any combination thereof). The<br>
cooling loop can also consist of gas or vapor coolant and/ or solid beds.<br>
The appliance cooling load 14 is the amount of heat generated by the<br>
appliance 6, which needs to be removed by the heat pump 4. Heat is<br>
absorbed at or near the appliance 6 and transported to the heat driven<br>
heat pump 4. A liquid pumped loop or a stream of gas can be used to<br>
absorb the cooling load 14 from the appliance 6 and transport it to the<br>
heat driven heat pump 4. The moderate temperature heat 1 6 is the heat<br>
' transferred from the heat driven heat pump 4 to the heat sink 8. Here<br>
again, convection, conduction, radiation, or any combination of these heat<br>
transfer mechanisms can be used to transport this heat. One possible<br>
implementation is atmospheric air blown through a heat exchanger inside<br>
the heat driven heat pump and released back to ambient. All three heat<br>
transfers (10, 14, 16) can be realized with a single or multiple heat<br>
streams. In the case of a LiBr-water heat driven heat pump, the moderate<br>
temperature heat 16 from the heat driven heat pump 4 to the heat sink 8<br>
is commonly realized with two transport loops.<br>
[0075] An example for the heat transfer loop from the heat driven<br>
heat pump 4 to the heat sink 8 is a pumped loop with tubes wrapped<br>
around the part of the heat driven heat pump 4 that requires cooiing and<br>
coils of tubes buried in the soil. Another example is a blower sucking in<br>
ambient air, blowing it over the surface that needs to be cooled and a<br>
conduit releasing the warm air back to ambient.<br>
[0076] The subsystem formed by the electrical power generator 2<br>
and the heat driven heat pump 4 is illustrated in Figure 7 for the case<br>
where a high temperature fuel cell is used as the electrical power<br>
generator 2. The fuel cell 68 is preferably a high temperature fuel cell,<br>
such as a solid oxide fuel cell.<br>
[0077] Fuel is delivered to the fuel cell with the help of a fuel blower<br>
18, which can also be a compressor. For liquid fuels, the blower 1 8 is<br>
replaced by a pump. An optional fuel preconditioner 104 preprocesses the<br>
fuel. For example this device can remove contaminants detrimental to the<br>
function of the power generator, such as sulfur. Another possible function<br>
for the fuel preconditioner 104 is preformation and/ or reformation.<br>
[0078] The fuel preheater 22 brings the fuel to fuel cell operating<br>
temperature. This preheater can be external to or an integral part of the<br>
fuel cell 68. It can be contained in one single or multiple devices. For a<br>
liquid fuel, the fuel preheater 22 evaporates the liquid fuel. For a gaseous<br>
fuel, the fuel preheater 22 can be a finned heat exchanger. A fuel<br>
preconditioner 104 can also be implemented after the fuel preheater 22 or<br>
integrated with the fuel preheater 22, or integral to fuel cell 68.<br>
[0079] The fuel preheat 54 is the heat required raise the<br>
temperature of the input fuel to the fuel cell operating temperature. The<br>
fuel intake conduit 34 provides a path for the fuel from the fuel blower 1 8<br>
to the fuel preheater 22. It may or may not have an intermediate fuel<br>
preconditioner 104. The fuel delivery conduit 36 provides a path for the<br>
fuel from the fuel preheater 22 to the fuel cell 68.<br>
[0080] The oxidizer blower 20 drives air or any other suitable<br>
oxidizer toward the fuel cell 68. The oxidizer intake conduit 42 provides a<br>
transport path for the oxidizer between the oxidizer blower 20 and the<br>
oxidizer preheater 24. An optional oxidizer preconditioner 106<br>
preprocesses "the oxidizer flow. Examples of the preconditioner 106<br>
include filters, and oxygen enrichment devices. The preconditioner heat<br>
11A is heat required to operate this optional device. One example for one<br>
component of the preconditioner 106 is an oxygen enrichment device<br>
utilizing temperature swing adsorption, as described in the first preferred<br>
embodiment. The oxidizer preconditioner 106 can also be installed<br>
upstream of the oxidizer blower 20. The oxidizer preheater 24 brings the<br>
input oxidizer to fuel cell operating temperature using the oxidizer preheat<br>
62. The oxidizer preheater 24 can be contained in single or multiple<br>
devices. In one preferred embodiment, the oxidizer is partially preheated in<br>
oxidizer preheater 24 and picks up additional heat inside the fuel cell 68,<br>
thereby cooling the fuel cell 68. One example for the oxidizer preheater<br>
24 is a finned heat exchanger. The oxidizer delivery conduit 44 transports<br>
the oxidizer from the oxidizer preheater 24 to the fuel cell 68.<br>
[0081] In the fuel cell 68, the fuel and the oxidizer are<br>
electrochemically reacted. This reaction produces electrical energy 12 and<br>
high temperature heat. The fuel cell high temperature heat 58 represents<br>
the part of the heat generated by the fuel cell which is harnessed for<br>
further use and not removed by the exhaust or the depleted oxidizer. Not<br>
all of the heat generated by the fuel cell can be harnessed and transported<br>
to other devices.<br>
[0082] The fuel cell high temperature heat 58 can be utilized for<br>
various purposes. This heat can be used for the fuel preheat 54, the<br>
oxidizer preheat 62, preconditioner heat 11 A, or the heat driven heat<br>
pump high temperature input heat 10. The fuel cell high temperature heat<br><br>
58 can be directed to any combination of these heat consumers (10, 54,<br>
62,11 A). One possibility for harnessing the fuel cell high temperature heat<br>
58 is a gas cooling loop, separate from the oxidizer flow loop to the fuel<br>
cell.<br>
[0083] The fuel cell outlet conduits 38 and 46 transport the<br>
electrochemical reaction products. If the fuel cell 68 is a solid oxide fuel<br>
cell, then the exhaust conduit 38 transports reacted fuel and the outlet<br>
oxidizer conduit 46 transports oxygen depleted oxidizer. The fuel outlet<br>
cooler 28 extracts the exhaust cooling heat 56 from the exhaust stream.<br>
The fuel outlet cooler 28 can be one or multiple devices and can be partly<br>
or fully integrated with the fuel cell 68. One example for the fuel outlet<br>
cooler 28 is a finned heat exchanger. The exhaust cooling heat 56 can be<br>
used for the fuel preheat 54, the oxidizer preheat 62, preconditioner heat<br>
11 A, or the heat driven heat pump high temperature input heat 10. The<br>
exhaust cooling heat 56 can be directed to any combination of these heat<br>
consumers (10, 54, 62, 11A).<br>
[0084] The oxidizer outlet cooler 26 extracts the oxidizer cooling<br>
heat 60 from the outlet oxidizer stream. The oxidizer outlet cooler 26 can<br>
be one or multiple devices and can be partly or fully integrated with the<br>
fuel cell 68. One example for the oxidizer outlet cooler is a finned heat<br>
exchanger. The oxidizer cooling heat 60 can be used for the fuel preheat<br>
54, the oxidizer preheat 62, preconditioner heat 11A, or the heat driven<br>
heat pump high temperature input heat 10. The oxidizer cooling heat 60<br>
can be directed to any combination of these heat consumers (10, 54, 62,<br>
11 A). ,<br>
[0085] The fuel outlet (i.e., exhaust) conduit 38 and the oxidizer<br>
outlet (i.e., exhaust) conduit 46 deliver fuel exhaust and oxygen depleted<br>
oxidizer to the optional burner 30. In the burner 30, these two gas<br>
streams are chemically reacted, generating the burner high temperature<br>
heat 48. The chemical reaction can be initiated by an optional catalyst<br>
material.<br>
[0086] The burner high temperature heat 48 can be provided to the<br>
fuel preheat 54, the oxidizer preheat 62, preconditioner heat 11A, or the<br>
heat driven heat pump high temperature input heat 10. The burner high<br>
temperature heat 48 can be directed to any combination of these heat<br>
consumers (10, 54, 62,11A). One preferred example of-transport of the<br>
burner high temperature heat 48 is direct integration of the burner with<br>
the consumer (i.e. heat transfer by conduction to the consumer). Another<br>
preferred example for this heat transport is a pumped fluid loop.<br>
[0087] The burner exhaust conduit 50 transports the reaction<br>
products from the burner 30 to the optional burner exhaust heat<br>
exchanger 32. In the burner exhaust heat exchanger 32 the burner<br>
exhaust heat 64 is extracted from the burner reaction products. One<br>
example for the burner exhaust heat exchanger 32 is a finned heat<br>
exchanger.<br>
[0088] The burner exhaust heat 64 can be provided to the fuel<br>
preheat 54, the oxidizer preheat 62, preconditioner heat 11A, or the heat<br>
driven heat pump high temperature input heat 10. The burner exhaust<br>
heat 64 can be directed to any combination of these heat consumers (10,<br>
54, 62, 11A). The burner heat exchanger exhaust conduit 102 transports<br>
the burner exhaust out of the system (preferably vented to ambient or<br>
into an exhaust post-processor).<br>
[0089] The heat driven heat pump 4 is driven by the high<br>
temperature heat 10. After using heat from the high temperature heat 10<br>
the heat driven heat pump 4 vents one heat stream in the heat pump low-<br>
temperature outflow 16A. The appliance cooling load 14 from appliance 6<br><br>
is removed by the cooling stream 16B. The high temperature heat 10 can<br>
be provided by the fuel cell high temperature heat 58, the exhaust cooling<br>
heat 56, the oxidizer cooling heat 60, the burner high temperature heat<br>
48, or the burner exhaust heat 64. The high temperature heat 10 can also<br>
be provided by any combination of these heat sources (48, 56, 58, 60,<br>
64).<br>
[0090] One preferred implementation for the appliance cooling load<br>
14 and the heat 1 6B is ambient air driven by a blower into the heat driven<br>
heat pump 4, cooled beiow ambient temperature in the heat driven heat<br>
pump, and then directed to the appliance that requires cooling. At the<br>
appliance the cool air picks up the cooling load 14 and is heated. The<br>
heated air is vented back to ambient.<br>
[0091] One preferred embodiment of the system shown in Figure 7<br>
is presented in Figure 8A. The system shown in Figure 8A follows the<br>
same outline presented for Figure 7. Figure 8A includes one preferred<br>
routing of the heat streams shown in Figure 7. The fuel preheat 54 is<br>
provided by the fuel exhaust cooling heat 56. Optionally, the fuel can pick<br>
up additional heat in the fuel cell. The heat transfer from exhaust cooling<br>
heat 56 to fuel preheat 54 can be realized in a heat exchanger, for<br>
example a finned heat exchanger. One example of this configuration is to<br>
combine heat exchangers 22 and 28 as a single component. Depending<br>
on the choice of fuel, water vapor can be transferred from the exhaust to<br>
the input fuel. This water transport can be integrated into a heat<br>
exchanger or it can be realized with a separate device.<br>
[0092] The oxidizer preheat 62 is provided partly by the oxidizer<br>
exhaust cooling heat 60. The remainder of the heat needed to bring the<br>
oxidizer to fuel cell operating temperature is absorbed in the fuel cell,<br>
thereby removing all of the high temperature heat from the fuel cell<br>
without an additional heat transfer ioop. The heat transfer from oxidizer<br>
exhaust cooling heat 60 to oxidizer preheat 62 can be realized in a heat<br>
exchanger, for example a finned heat exchanger. One example of this<br>
configuration is to combine heat exchangers 24 and 26 as a single<br>
component. The burner high temperature heat 48 is not immediately<br>
extracted. Instead, it is extracted together with burner exhaust heat 64.<br>
The burner exhaust heat 64 is directed to the high temperature heat 10,<br>
which provides the necessary heat to actuate the heat driven heat pump<br>
4. The heat transfer from the burner exhaust heat 64 to the heat driven<br>
heat pump 4 can be realized with a heat exchanger incorporated in the<br>
heat driven heat pump 4. Thus the burner exhaust heat exchanger 32 is<br>
combined with the heat exchanger in the heat pump 4 to form a single<br>
component. This heat exchanger can be a finned heat exchanger. The<br>
cooling load 14 can be extracted from the appliance 6 by a cool air<br>
stream provided by the heat driven heat pump 4, which is driven with a<br>
cooling air blower 72 through cooling air inlet duct 74 directed to the<br>
appliance with a cooling air conduit 76.<br>
[0093] Table 1 presents an energy balance for a 100kW electrical<br>
power system based on Figure 8A. The naming convention, where<br>
applicable, is consistent with Figure 8A.<br>
[0095] Figure 8B illustrates another preferred aspect of the second<br>
embodiment of this invention. The system illustrated in Figure 8B shows<br>
an alternative preferred routing of the heat streams shown in Figure 7.<br>
The system depicted in Figure 8B is similar to the system depicted in<br>
Figure 8A, with the exception that the oxidizer cooling heat 60 is<br>
provided to the heat exchanger 4 as the high temperature heat 10, and<br>
the burner exhaust heat 64 is provided to the oxidizer preheater 24 as<br>
oxidizer preheat 62. Thus, the oxidizer outlet conduit 46 is provided into<br>
the heat exchanger of the heat pump 4 and then into the burner 30, while<br>
the burner exhaust conduit 50 is provided into the burner exhaust heat<br>
exchanger 32. Both the heat transfer from the oxidizer cooling heat 60 to<br>
the high temperature heat 10 and the burner exhaust heat 64 to the<br>
oxidizer preheat 62 can be realized with heat exchangers. Thus, the<br>
oxidizer preheater 24 and the burner exhaust heat exchanger 32 are<br>
combined as a single component and comprise portions of the same heat<br>
exchanger 24/32. Likewise, the outlet oxidizer cooler 26 and the heat<br>
exchanger portion of the heat pump 4 are combined as a single<br>
component and comprise a portion of the same heat exchanger.<br>
[00961 Figure 8C illustrates another preferred aspect of the second<br>
embodiment of this invention. The system illustrated in Figure 8C shows<br>
an alternative preferred routing of the heat streams shown in Figure 7.<br>
The system depicted in Figure 8C is similar to the system depicted in<br>
Figure 8A, but differs by a cross-over of the exhaust fuel and oxidizer<br>
paths. In Figure 8C, the fuel outlet conduit 38 is provided into the<br>
oxidizer outlet cooler 28, while the oxidizer outlet conduit 46 is provided<br>
into the fuel outlet cooler 26. Thus, the exhaust cooling heat 56 is<br>
provided as oxidizer preheat 62 and oxidizer cooling heat 60 is provided<br>
as fuel preheat 54. Both heat transfers can be realized with heat<br>
exchangers. Thus, the oxidizer preheater 24 and the fuel outlet cooler 28<br>
are combined as a single component and comprise portions of the same<br>
heat exchanger 24/28. Likewise, the outlet oxidizer cooler 26 and the<br>
fuel preheater 22 are combined as a single component and comprise a<br>
portion of the same heat exchanger 22/26.<br>
[0097] Figure 9 shows another preferred embodiment of the system<br>
depicted in Figure 6. The main difference between Figure 7 and Figure 9<br>
is the addition of a gas turbine driven electrical power generator. The gas<br>
turbine can utilize the high temperature heat from the fuel cell to generate<br>
additional electrical energy and thereby further increase the electrical<br>
efficiency of the electrical power generator. High temperature waste heat<br>
is still available to drive a heat driven heat pump and thereby form a<br>
complementary system, which can provide matched electrical power and<br>
cooling. The increase of efficiency of the power generator implies that<br>
less high temperature heat per electrical power generated is available.<br>
Such an embodiment is used preferentially when the electrical load<br>
requirements are greater than the cooling load requirements and there are<br>
no environmental and permitting issues against the use of gas turbines.<br>
This embodiment can also be used with a heat driven heat pump of<br>
higher efficiency such as to complete the balance between the electrical<br>
and thermal loads in the system described above.<br>
[0098] In Figure 9 the fuel is compressed and transported into the<br>
system by the fuel compressor 80. A fuel compressor inlet conduit 82<br>
delivers the fuel to the fuel compressor 80. For a liquid fuel, a fuel pump<br>
can be used instead of the fuel compressor 80. An optional fuel<br>
preconditioner 104 preprocesses the fuel. For example this device can<br>
remove contaminants detrimental to the function of the power generator,<br>
such as sulfur. Another possible function for the fuel preconditioner 104<br>
is prereformation or reformation.<br>
[0099] The fuel preheater 22 brings the fuel to fuel cell operating<br>
temperature. If the fuel is provided as a liquid, the fuel is evaporated in<br>
the fuel preheater 22. This preheater can be external to or an integral part<br>
of the fuel cell 68. It can be contained in one single or multiple devices.<br>
The fuel preheat 54 is the heat required to bring the fuel to fuel cell<br>
operating temperature. The fuel intake conduit 34 provides a path for the<br>
fuel from the fuel compressor 80 to the fuel preheater 22. The fuel<br>
delivery conduit 36 provides a path for the fuel from the fuel preheater 22<br>
to the fuel cell 68.<br>
[0100] The oxidizer compressor 84 drives air or any other suitable<br>
oxidizer to the fuel cell 68. The oxidizer compressor inlet conduit 86<br>
delivers the oxidizer to the oxidizer compressor 84. An optional oxidizer<br>
preconditioner 106 preprocesses the oxidizer flow. Examples of the<br>
preconditioner 106 include filters, and oxygen enrichment devices. The<br>
preconditioner heat 11A is heat required to operate this optional device.<br>
One example for one component of the preconditioner 106 is an oxygen<br>
enrichment device utilizing temperature swing adsorption. The oxidizer<br>
preconditioner 106 can also be installed downstream of the oxidizer<br>
compressor 84. The oxidizer intake conduit 42 provides a transport path<br>
for the oxidizer between the oxidizer compressor 84 and the oxidizer<br>
preheater 24. The oxidizer preheater 24 brings the input oxidizer to fuel<br>
cell operating temperature using the oxidizer preheat 62. The oxidizer<br>
preheater 24 can be contained in a single or multiple devices. In one<br>
preferred embodiment, the oxidizer is partially preheated in oxidizer<br>
preheater 24 and picks up additional heat inside the fuel cell 68, thereby<br>
cooling the fuel cell 68. The oxidizer delivery conduit 44 transports the<br>
oxidizer from the oxidizer preheater 24 to the fuel cell 68.<br>
[0101] In the fuel cell 68, the fuel and the oxidizer are<br>
electrochemically reacted. This reaction produces electrical energy 12A<br>
high temperature heat 58.<br>
[0102] The oxidizer outlet cooler 26 extracts the oxidizer cooling<br>
heat 60 from the outlet oxidizer stream. The outlet oxidizer cooler 26 can<br>
be one or multiple devices and can be partly or fully integrated with the<br>
fuel cell 68. The fuel outlet cooler 28 extracts the exhaust cooling heat<br>
56 from the exhaust stream. The fuel outlet cooler 28 can be one or<br>
multiple devices and can be partly or fully integrated with the fuel cell 68.<br>
One example for the coolers 26, 28 is a finned heat exchanger.<br>
[0103] The fuel exhaust conduit 38 and the oxidizer outlet conduit<br>
46 deliver fuel exhaust and oxygen depleted oxidizer to the optional<br>
burner 30. In the burner 30 these two gas streams are chemically<br>
reacted, generating the burner high temperature heat 48.<br>
[0104] The burner high temperature heat 48 can be provided to the<br>
fuel preheat 54, the oxidizer preheat 62, the preconditioner heat 1 1A, or<br>
the high temperature heat 10. The burner high temperature heat 48 can<br>
be directed to any combination of these heat consumers (10, 11 A, 54,<br>
62).<br>
[0105] The burner exhaust conduit 50 transports the reaction<br>
products from the burner 30 to the optional burner exhaust heat<br>
exchanger 32. In the burner exhaust heat exchanger the burner exhaust<br>
heat 64 is extracted from the burner reaction products.<br>
[0106] The burner exhaust heat 64 can be provided to the fuel<br>
preheat 54, the oxidizer preheat 62, the preconditioner heat 11 A, or the<br>
high temperature heat 10. The burner exhaust heat 64 can be directed to<br>
any combination of these heat consumers (10, 11A, 54, 62).<br>
[0107] The turbine inlet conduit 88 transports the burner exhaust to<br>
the turbine 90. A mechanical coupling 92 transmits mechanical energy<br>
from the turbine 90 to the oxidizer compressor 84, the fuel compressor<br>
80, and/or the electrical generator 94. If desired, the compressors may be<br>
actuated by another source of mechanical energy and/or electrical power.<br>
The electrical generator 94 generates additional electrical power 12B.<br>
[0108] The turbine outlet conduit 96 transports the turbine exhaust to<br>
the optional turbine exhaust heat exchanger 98. In the turbine exhaust<br>
heat exchanger the turbine exhaust heat 1 00A is extracted from the gas<br>
flow. The turbine exhaust heat 100A can be provided to the fuel preheat<br>
54, the oxidizer preheat 62, the preconditioner heat 11 A, or the high<br>
temperature heat 10. The turbine exhaust heat 100A can be directed to<br>
any combination of these heat consumers (10, 11A, 54, 62). The<br>
exhaust conduit 102 transports the exhaust gases out of the system<br>
(preferably vented to ambient or into an exhaust post-processor).<br>
[0109] The heat driven heat pump 4 is driven by the high temperature<br>
heat 10. After utilizing heat from the high temperature heat 10, the heat<br>
driven heat pump 4 vents one heat stream in the moderate temperature<br>
heat 16A. The appliance cooling load 14 from appliance 6 is removed by<br>
the cooling stream 16B. The high temperature heat 10 can be provided by<br>
the fuel cell high temperature heat 58, the exhaust cooling heat 56, the<br>
oxidizer cooling heat 60, the burner high temperature heat 48, the burner<br>
exhaust heat 64, or the turbine exhaust heat 100A. The high temperature<br>
heat 10 can also be provided by any combination of these heat sources<br>
(46, 56, 58, 60, 64, 100A).<br>
[0110] One preferred embodiment of the system shown in Figure 9 is<br>
presented in Figure 10A. The system shown in Figure 10A follows the<br>
same outline presented for Figure 9. Figure 10A includes one preferred<br>
routing of the heat streams involved. The fuel preheat 54 is provided by<br>
the exhaust cooling heat 56. Optionally, the fuel can pick up additional<br>
heat in the fuel cell. The heat transfer from exhaust cooling heat 56 to<br>
fuel preheat 54 can be realized in a heat exchanger, for example a finned<br>
heat exchanger 22/28. Depending on the choice of fuel, water vapor can<br>
be transferred from the exhaust to the input fuel. This water transport can<br>
be integrated into a heat exchanger or it can be realized with a separate<br>
device. The oxidizer preheat 62 is provided partly by the oxidizer cooling<br>
heat 60. The remainder of the heat needed to bring the oxidizer to fuel<br>
cell operating temperature is absorbed in the fuel cell, thereby removing<br>
all of the high temperature heat from the fuel cell without an additional<br>
heat transfer loop. The heat transfer from oxidizer cooling heat 60 to<br>
oxidizer preheat 62 can be realized in a heat exchanger, for example a<br>
finned heat exchanger 24/26.<br>
[0111] The burner high temperature heat 48 together with the high<br>
temperature heat from the fuel cell carried by the burner exhaust gas 64<br>
is first used to drive the turbine 90. The remaining heat after the turbine<br>
is used as high temperature heat 10 to drive the heat driven heat pump 4.<br>
[0112] The heat transfer from the turbine exhaust heat 1 00A to the<br>
heat driven heat pump 4 can be realized with a heat exchanger<br>
incorporated in the heat driven heat pump 4. Thus the turbine exhaust<br>
heat exchanger 98 and the heat exchanger portion of the heat pump 4 are<br>
combined as a single heat exchanger. This heat exchanger can be a finned<br>
heat exchanger. The cooling load 14 can be absorbed from the appliance<br>
6 by a cool air stream provided by the heat driven heat pump 4, which is<br>
driven with a cooling air blower 72 through cooling air inlet duct 74<br>
directed to the appliance with a cooling air conduit 76.<br>
[0113] Figure 10B illustrates another preferred aspect of the second<br>
embodiment of this invention. The system illustrated in Figure 10B shows<br>
an alternative preferred routing of the oxidizer stream shown in Figures 9<br>
and 10A. The system depicted in Figure 10B is similar to the system<br>
depicted in Figure 10A, with the exception of the oxidizer routing. In the<br>
system of Figure 10B, the gas turbine 90 and the fuel cell 68 are fed with<br>
separate oxidizer streams. An oxidizer blower 20 is used for the oxidizer<br>
supply for the fuel cell. This blower can also be a compressor. The<br>
compressor 84 delivers oxidizer to the burner 30 via conduit 45A. The<br>
unreacted fuel from the fuel cell is combusted in the burner. The burner<br>
exhaust drives the turbine 90. The advantage of this system is that a<br>
higher oxygen content oxidizer is supplied to the burner. This improves<br>
the combustion process in the burner and subsequently improves the<br>
turbine operation.<br>
[0114] Figure 1 OC illustrates another preferred aspect of the second<br>
embodiment of this invention. The system illustrated in Figure 10C<br>
shows an alternative preferred routing of the heat streams shown in<br>
Figure 9. The system in Figure 10C is differs from the system in Figure<br>
10A by the sequence of heat usage from the oxidizer. In Figure 10C the<br>
oxidizer leaving the fuel cell 68 first delivers the oxidizer cooling heat 60<br>
to the high temperature input heat 10 in the heat pump 4, and then enters<br>
the burner 30. The oxidizer preheat 62 is provided by the turbine exhaust<br>
heat 1O0A. Thus, the oxidizer preheater 24 and the turbine exhaust heat<br>
exchanger 98 are combined as a single component and comprise portions<br>
of the same heat exchanger 24/98. Likewise, the outlet oxidizer cooler<br>
26 and the heat exchanger portion of the heat pump 4 are combined as a<br>
single component and comprise a portion of the same heat exchanger.<br>
[0115] The system in Figure 10C relates similarly to Figure 10A as<br>
the system in Figure 8B relates to the system in Figure 8A. The system<br><br>
in Figure 10C can also incorporate the use of separate oxidizers for the<br>
fuel cell and the burner 30, as shown in Figure 10B. It may be<br>
advantageous to provide separate oxidizer streams for the fuel cell 68 and<br>
the turbine 90.<br>
[0116] Figure 1 0D illustrates another preferred aspect of the second<br>
embodiment of this invention. The system illustrated in Figure 10D<br>
shows an alternative preferred routing of the heat streams shown in<br>
Figure 9. The system depicted in Figure 10D is similar to the system<br>
depicted in Figure 10A, but differs by the routing of the heat fluxes. In<br>
Figure 10D, the fuel preheat 54 is provided by the turbine exhaust heat<br>
1 00A, while the high temperature heat 10D is provided by the fuel exhaust<br>
cooling heat 56. Thus, the turbine outlet conduit 96 is provided into the<br>
turbine exhaust heat exchanger 98, while the fuel cell fuel outlet conduit<br>
38 is provided into the heat exchanger portion of the heat pump 4. Thus,<br>
the turbine exhaust heat exchanger 98 and the fuel preheater 22 are<br>
combined as a single component and comprise portions of the same heat<br>
exchanger 22/98. Likewise, the outlet fuel cooler 28 and the heat<br>
exchanger portion of the heat pump 4 are combined as a single<br>
component and comprise a portion of the same heat exchanger. This<br>
routing can be applied to any of the systems of Figures 10A, 10B and<br>
10C previously discussed.<br>
[0117] Figures 6 to 10D present the basic layouts of the<br>
components of the systems of the preferred aspects of the second<br>
embodiment. These components can also be combined in a large number<br>
of other ways not shown in these Figures. Any component or<br>
combination of components shown in one figure may be used in a system<br>
shown in any other figure. For example, the cross over of the fuel cell<br>
fuel and oxidizer exhaust paths shown in Figure 8C can be applied to the<br>
systems shown in Figures 8A, 8B, 10A, 10B, 10C, 10D, as well as<br>
combinations of these systems.<br>

III. The Third Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0119] In one prior art solid oxide fuel cell 100, the ceramic<br>
electrolyte 101 is corrugated, as shown in Figure 11. While the whole<br>
electrolyte 101 is bent or corrugated, its major surfaces 103, 105 are<br>
smooth or uniform. Thus, the electrolyte 101 has the same thickness<br>
along its length. However, the imaginary center line 107 running along<br>
the length of the electrolyte 101 significantly deviates from an imaginary<br>
straight line 109. The anode 111 and cathode 113 are formed on the<br>
uniform surfaces 103, 105 of the electrolyte 101. Such a corrugated<br>
electrolyte 101 is difficult to manufacture and even more difficult to<br>
properly integrate in a fuel cell stack containing a plurality of fuel cells.<br>
[0120] The present inventors have realized that if at least a portion<br>
of at least one surface of the electrolyte is made non-uniform, then<br>
several advantages may be realized. The oxygen diffusion through an<br>
electrolyte in a solid oxide fuel cell proceeds between so-called "three<br>
phase boundaries." These three phase boundaries are electrolyte grain<br>
boundary regions at the boundary of an electrode (i.e., cathode or anode)<br>
and electrolyte, as shown in Figure 12. Diffusing oxygen makes up the<br>
third "phase." If the active portions of one or both major surfaces of the<br>
electrolyte are made non-uniform, then the surface area between the<br>
electrolyte and the electrode contacting the non-uniform surface is<br>
increased. The "active portion" of the electrolyte is the area between the<br>
electrodes that generates the electric current. In contrast, the peripheral<br>
portion of the electrolyte is used for attaching the electrolyte to the fuel<br>
cell stack and may contain fuel and oxygen passages. The increased<br>
surface area results in more three phase boundary regions, which allows<br>
more oxygen to diffuse through the electrolyte. This increases the power<br>
density (i.e., watts per cm2) of the fuel cell and decreases the cost per<br>
watt of the fuel cell. Furthermore, the non-uniform surface, such as a<br>
textured or roughened electrolyte surface provides better adhesion to the<br>
adjacent electrodes of the fuel cell due to improved mechanical<br>
interlocking.<br>
[0121] Figure 13 illustrates a solid oxide fuel cell 200 containing a<br>
ceramic electrolyte 201 having at least one non-uniform surface portion,<br>
according to a first preferred aspect of the third embodiment. The at<br>
least one non-uniform surface in the first preferred aspect is a textured<br>
surface. Preferably, two opposing major surfaces 203, 205 are textured.<br>
A textured surface 203, 205 contains a plurality of protrusions (i.e.,<br>
bumps, peaks, etc.) 206 having a height 208 that is 5% or less,<br>
preferably 1 % or less of an average electrolyte thickness 209. In a<br>
preferred aspect of this embodiment, the electrolyte is textured to obtain<br>
an electrolyte having a surface roughness of 0.5 to 2 microns, preferably<br>
1 to 2 microns. This surface roughness possesses good adhesion to<br>
common SOFC electrodes. The height and width of the protrusions 206<br>
is exaggerated in Figure 1 3 for clarity. The protrusions 206 may have<br>
any desired shape, such as rectangular, polygonal, triangular, pyramidal,<br>
semi-spherical or any irregular shape. Preferably, only the active portions<br>
210 of the opposing major surfaces 203, 205 are textured, while the<br>
peripheral portions 202 of the surfaces 203, 205 are not textured.<br>
However, if desired, the entire major surfaces 203, 205 may be textured.<br>
For example, in adhesive or compression seals, where the integrity of the<br>
seal increases with the area of the contact surfaces, texturing the<br>
peripheral portions can increase the seal integrity and/ or reduce the "non-<br>
active" peripheral area of the fuel cell.<br>
[0122] In contrast to the corrugated electrolyte of Figure 11, the<br>
electrolyte shown in Figure 13 is substantially flat. The imaginary center<br>
line 207 running along the length of the electrolyte 201 does not<br>
significantly deviate from an imaginary straight Sine. While the whole<br>
electrolyte 201 is substantially flat, its major opposing surfaces 203, 205<br>
are non-uniform and textured. The anode 211 and cathode 213 are<br>
formed on the textured surfaces 203, 205 of the electrolyte 201. The<br>
substantially flat electrolyte is advantageous because it is easier to<br>
manufacture, because it is easier to integrate into a fuel cell stack and<br>
because it is more durable than a corrugated electrolyte. However, if<br>
desired, the textured surface(s) may be located on a non-flat or<br>
corrugated electrolyte.<br>
[0123] The electrolyte, anode and cathode may be made of any<br>
appropriate materials. Preferably, the electrolyte comprises a yttria<br>
stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramic. The cathode preferably comprises a<br>
Perovskite ceramic having a general formula ABO3, such as LaSrMnO3<br>
("LSM"). The anode preferably comprises a metal, such as Ni, or a metal<br>
containing cermet, such as a Ni-YSZ or Cu-YSZ cermet. Other suitable<br>
materials may be used if desired.<br>
[0124] The non-uniform surface of the electrolyte may be formed by<br>
any suitable method. Preferably, the non-uniform surface is made by<br>
providing a ceramic green sheet and patterning at least a portion of at<br>
least one surface of the green sheet to form at least a non-uniform portion<br>
of the at least one_surface. The green sheet may then be sintered (i.e.,<br>
fired or annealed at a high temperature) to form the ceramic electrolyte.<br>
It should be notea that the term "green sheet" includes a green tape or a<br>
sheet of finite size. Preferably both sides of the green sheet are patterned<br>
to form two opposing non-uniform surface portions of the green sheet.<br>
[0125] Another preferred aspect of the third embodiment of the<br>
present invention is directed to a composite electrolyte with a textured<br>
interface. Figure 14 illustrates a prior art composite electrolyte, while<br>
Figures 15 and 16 illustrate a composite electrolyte with a textured<br>
interface according to the third preferred embodiement. It can be<br>
advantageous to fabricate the electrolyte not from one single material,<br>
which is typically yttria stabilized' zirconia (YSZ), but to use several layers<br>
of materials. One example for composite electrolyte is a samaria-doped<br>
ceria (SDC) electrolyte coated with YSZ on one or both sides. SDC has<br>
the advantage over YSZ to provide higher ionic conductivity. However,<br>
the application of SDC is limited by its ability to withstand low oxygen<br>
partial pressures. At low oxygen partial pressures SDC can be reduced,<br>
lose its ionic conductivity in part or in whole and thereby cause a critical<br>
failure in a solid oxide fuel cell. YSZ has a lower ionic conductivity, which<br>
implies higher electrical losses within this material, but it can withstand<br>
lower oxygen partial pressures compared to SDC. Also, SDC displays<br>
electron conductivity at elevated temperatures, which is detrimental to<br>
the performance of a fuel cell. A layer of YSZ next to SDC can effectively<br>
suppress electron conduction, since YSZ is a very weak electron<br>
conductor.<br>
[0126] Figure 14 shows a prior art YSZ electrolyte 300, which is<br>
coated or laminated with a layer of SDC 305. One example is to use the<br>
SDC on the cathode side of the solid oxide fuel cell, which is not exposed<br>
to the reacting fuel, and thereby not exposed to low oxygen partial<br>
pressure, while the YSZ is used on the anode side.<br>
[0127] The high oxygen ion conductivity in SDC can create a rate<br>
limiting step at the interface between SDC and YSZ. The losses at the<br>
interface between the two materials can be reduced by increasing the<br>
surface area of the interface. An increase in interface area can be<br>
accomplished by texturing the interface. Figure 15 shows a cross section<br>
of a composite electrolyte with a textured internal interface. Here a<br>
textured layer of SDC 315 is attached to a layer of YSZ 310.<br>
[0128] The combination of YSZ and SDC is one example where a<br>
textured interface can be used. Other materia! combination can also be<br>
used with textured interfaces. The composite electrolyte can consist of<br>
two layers as shown in Figure 15 or of three or more layers 310, 315,<br>
320 with at least one, and preferably more than one textured interface<br>
303, 305 as shown in Figure 16.<br>
[0129] Textured interfaces can be formed by any suitable method.<br>
One method is the lamination of two textured matching surfaces. Another<br>
method is the application of the second layer onto a textured surface of<br>
the first material, for example by tape casting or by screen printing. In a<br>
preferred example, the SDC is provided as a mechanically supporting<br>
substrate with a thickness of about 50 to 200 micrometers, preferably<br>
about 100 micrometers and the YSZ is deposited on the substrate as a<br>
thin protective layer of about 1 0 to 50 micrometers, preferably about 20<br>
micrometers. In this case, the surface texture can have a thickness of<br>
about 10 micrometers. However, texturing on larger and smaller length<br>
scales is also possible.<br>
[0130] The textured internal interfaces (i.e., interface surfaces)<br>
illustrated in Figures 15 and 16 can be formed on composite electrolytes<br>
also having textured outer surfaces 203, 205 (i.e., surfaces that contact<br>
the electrodes). One or both of the outer composite electrolyte surfaces<br>
can be textured.<br>
[0131] Additional layers that offer superior mechanical, thermal,<br>
and/ or electrical properties may be added to composite or single layer<br>
electrolytes to provide improved superior mechanical, thermal, and/ or<br>
electrical properties compared to single layer electrolytes. Furthermore,<br>
multiple layers of functionally graded electrodes (anodes and/ or cathodes)<br>
may be provided on single layer or composite electrolytes.<br>
[0132] The textured surface(s) 203, 205 illustrated in Figures 13<br>
and 15 may be textured by several different methods. In one preferred<br>
aspect of the third embodiment, the textured surface is formed by laser<br>
ablating the green sheet, following by sintering the green sheet. Any<br>
suitable laser ablation method and apparatus may be used to texture the<br>
green sheet. A schematic illustration of a laser ablation apparatus 250<br>
suitable for texturing the green sheet surface is shown in Figure 17. A<br>
laser source 251 directs a laser beam 253 at a reflective mirror 255. The<br>
mirror 255 directs the beam 253 through a focusing lens 257 onto the<br>
green sheet (such as an unfired electrolyte tape) 261 located on the<br>
precision XYZ table 259. Any laser source 251 which has sufficient<br>
power to ablate the green sheet 261 may be used. For example, excimer<br>
or YAG lasers may be used as the laser source 251. The laser beam 253<br>
is scanned over the surface of the green sheet 261 by moving the XYZ<br>
table and/or by moving the mirror 255. The laser beam power may be<br>
varied during the scanning to achieve a non-uniform textured green sheet<br>
surface. For example, the laser source 251 may be periodically turned on<br>
and off, or it may be attenuated by an attenuator (not shown) to vary the<br>
laser beam power. Alternatively, the XYZ table may be moved up and<br>
down during the scanning of the beam 253 to vary the beam power that<br>
impinges on the green sheet 261. The laser beam position and/or power<br>
and/or table movement may be controlled by a computer to create a<br>
desired pattern on the electrolyte. The laser beam 253 ablates (i.e.,<br>
removes or roughens) a portion of a top surface of the green sheet 261 to<br>
leaye a textured surface. The textured green sheet is then sintered or<br>
fired to form the ceramic electrolyte. Alternatively, the laser ablation may<br>
be conducted after the sintering step on the sintered electrolyte.<br>
[0133] Alternatively, the textured surface of the green sheet may be<br>
formed by photolithography methods that are used in semiconductor<br>
manufacturing. For example, as shown in Figure 18, an etching mask<br>
271 is formed on the green sheet 261. The etching mask 271 may<br>
comprise a photoresist layer that has been exposed through an exposure<br>
mask and developed. The unmasked portions 273 of the green sheet are<br>
etched to form recesses in the top surface of the green sheet. The<br>
masked portions 275 of the green sheet are protected from etching by the<br>
mask 271, and remain as protrusions 275 between the recesses 273.<br>
The protrusions 275 and recesses 273 form a textured surface. The<br>
photoresist mask 271 is removed after etching by a conventional selective<br>
removal process, such as ashing. Any etching gas or liquid that<br>
preferentially etches the green sheet material to the mask material may be<br>
used. As shown in Figure 18, an anisotropic etching medium was used to<br>
form recesses 273 with straight sidewalls. This results in rectangular<br>
protrusions 275 between the recesses. Alternatively, an isotropic etching<br>
medium may be used to form recesses 273 with outwardly sloped walls.<br>
This results is trapezoidal or pyramidal protrusions 275 between the<br>
recesses.<br>
[0134] The mask may comprise materials other than photoresist. In<br>
one example, other photosensitive layers may be used. Alternatively, a<br>
so-called "hard mask" may be used as a mask to etch the green sheet.<br>
For example, as shown in Figure 19, a hard mask layer 281 is deposited<br>
on the green sheet 261. The hard mask layer 281 may be any material<br>
which resists being etched by an etching medium to a higher degree than<br>
the green sheet 261. The hard mask layer may be any suitable metal,<br>
ceramic, semiconductor or insulator. A photoresist mask 271 is formed,<br>
exposed and developed over the hard mask layer 281. The hard mask<br>
layer 281 is then etched using the photoresist as a mask. Then, the<br>
green sheet 261 is etched to form a textured surface containing a<br>
plurality of recesses 273 and protrusions 275 using the hard mask 281 as<br>
a mask. The photoresist mask 271 may be removed before or after the<br>
green sheet is etched. The hard mask 281 is removed after the green<br>
sheet 261 is textured by a selective etching medium which removes the<br>
hard mask 281 but does not etch the green sheet 261.<br>
[0135] In another example, the mask may comprise a plurality of<br>
particles. As shown in Figure 20, a plurality of discontinuous particles<br>
291 are formed on the surface of the green sheet 261. The particles 291<br>
may be any material which resists being etched by an etching medium to<br>
a higher degree than the green sheet 261. The particles may be any<br>
suitable metal, ceramic (such as titania or alumina), semiconductor (such<br>
as polysilicon or silicon carbide) or insulator. The particles may be formed<br>
by any particle deposition method, such as spray coating, dip coating, ink<br>
jet deposition, sputtering or chemical vapor deposition. The portions 273<br>
of the green sheet 261 that are not covered by the particles 291 are<br>
etched to form recesses in the top surface of the green sheet. The<br><br>
covered portions 275 of the green sheet are protected from etching by<br>
the particles 291, and remain as protrusions between the recesses 273.<br>
The protrusions 275 and recesses 273 form a textured surface. The<br>
particles 291 are removed after the green sheet 261 is textured by a<br>
selective etching medium which removes the particles 291 but does not<br>
etch the green sheet 261.<br>
[0136] Alternatively, rather than depositing the particles 291 directly<br>
on the green sheet 261, the particles 291 may be formed by etching a<br>
textured layer 293 on the green sheet 261. For example, as shown in<br>
Figure 21, a layer 293 with a rough or textured surface is deposited on<br>
the green sheet 261. The textured surface of layer 293 contains<br>
protrusions 295. This layer 293 may be any material with has a rough<br>
surface, such as hemispherical grain polysilicon, ceramic, insulator or<br>
metal. Layer 293 is then anisotropicaily etched until only the protrusions<br>
295 remain on the surface of the green sheet 261, as shown in Figure<br>
22. The remaining protrusions 295 appear as a plurality of particles on<br>
the green sheet 261. The green sheet 261 is then etched using the<br>
protrusions 295 as a mask.<br>
[0137] In other examples, the textured surface is formed without a<br>
mask. In one example, an etching medium, such as an etching liquid,<br>
which preferentially attacks the grain boundaries 297 of the green sheet<br>
261 is applied to an upper surface of the green sheet. The etching<br>
medium selectively etches the grain boundaries 297 of the green sheet to<br>
form recesses 273. The regions of the green sheet 261 between the<br>
grain boundaries 297 are not etched or are etched to a lesser degree and<br>
remain as protrusions 275, as shown in Figure 23. Thus, a textured<br>
surface comprising protrusions 275 and recesses 273 is formed without a<br>
mask.<br>
[0138] In another example, the textured surface is formed by<br>
embossing. A body 298 (i.e., a press, a mold etc.) having a textured or<br>
roughened lower surface 299 is pressed into or rolled against the top<br>
surface of the green sheet 261, as shown in Figure 24. Alternatively, the<br>
green sheet is pressed into or rolled against surface 299. The lower<br>
surface 299 of body 298 has a higher hardness than the green sheet 261.<br>
The body 298 may be a ceramic, insulator or a metal body with a suitable<br>
hardness to emboss the green sheet. The embossing step leaves<br>
impressions or recesses in the green sheet 261 to form the textured<br>
surface in the green sheet. It should be noted that both sides of the<br>
green sheet 261 may be textured by the methods described above. If<br>
desired, heat may be applied to the process to soften the binder<br>
component of the green sheet to allow it to be textured easier.<br>
[0139] In another example, the textured surface is formed by<br>
building the ridges on a flat green tape. This can be done using a cladding<br>
process or by a powder / slurry spray process, where the powder and/or<br>
slurry is made of the same material as the green tape. In another<br>
example, the roughening or texturing can be applied to the electrolyte by<br>
various mechanical and chemical-mechanical machining methods, such as<br>
lapping, grinding or polishing (such as chemical-mechanical polishing)<br>
using an abrasive. Preferred abrasives include diamond, boron carbide<br>
and silicon carbide. Preferably, the sintered electrolyte is placed onto a<br>
rotating lapping, grinding or polishing wheel containing the abrasive. The<br>
abrasive may be an abrasive powder or slurry, such as a diamond, boron<br>
carbide or silicon carbide powder or slurry. The abrasive powder size is<br>
preferably 5 to 45 microns, such as 1 5 to 30 microns. Alternatively, the<br>
upper surface of the wheel is made of the abrasive material. The wheel is<br>
rotated against the electrolyte causing the electrolyte surface in contact<br>
with the abrasive to be textured. The process can then be repeated for<br>
the other side of the electrolyte. In a preferred aspect of this<br>
embodiment, the electrolyte is textured to obtain a YSZ electrolyte having<br>
a surface roughness of 0.5 to 2.5 microns, preferably 1 to 2 microns.<br>
This surface roughness possesses good adhesion to common SOFC<br>
electrodes.<br>
[0140] It is also possible to create the textured surface on a flat<br>
"sintered" sheet or tape as opposed to the green sheet or tape. While, in<br>
general, the green sheet or tape is more easily textured than the sintered<br>
ceramic product, etching agents that etch a sintered ceramic may be used<br>
to etch the sintered electrolyte.<br>
[0141] In one aspect of this embodiment, the green tape is prepared<br>
by tape casting. In this fabrication procedure, a raw ceramic powder, for<br>
example YSZ, is mixed with solvents, binders, plastisizers, and<br>
defloculants to form a slurry. The slurry is applied to a mylar film<br>
("carrier") and spread uniformly with a blade, which is dragged along the<br>
length of the carrier with a precisely adjusted gap between the blade and<br>
the carrier. In large scale fabrication, this process is run continuously by<br>
moving the carrier under a static blade and applying slurry to the carrier<br>
upstream of the blade. The thickness of the green tape can range<br>
between about 20 micrometer and 10,000 micrometers, preferably about<br>
50 to 1,000 micrometers. The amplitude of the surface texture can vary<br>
between 5 micrometers and 1000 micrometers, preferably about 10 to 30<br>
micrometers.<br>
[0142] The surface texturing can also be applied to electrolytes<br>
formed by other methods, such as electrolytes formed by extrusion. The<br>
texturing is not limited to electrolytes with planar geometries, but can also<br>
be applied to electrolytes with non-planar geometries.<br>
IV. The Fourth Preferred Embodiment<br><br>
[0143] In the fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the inventors have realized that the quality, robustness and environmental<br>
endurance of the solid oxide fuel cell can be improved by using an<br>
environment tolerant anode catalyst. For example, when, feeding a fuel<br>
contaminated with sulfur, a solid oxide fuel cell anode catalyst that is<br>
tolerant to sulfur may be used. When the fuel cell is subject to operation<br>
in a fuel starvation mode, a fuel ceil anode catalyst that is tolerant to fuel<br>
starvation may be used.<br>
[0144] In the prior art low temperature acid fuel cells, some minor<br>
improvement in sulfur tolerance has been observed when certain<br>
compounds are added to the fuel side anode catalyst. The compounds<br>
that have shown some positive tolerance include MoWOx, RuO2, WOx<br>
(such as WO2.5), MoS2, WS2, and PtSx. In the prior art molten carbonate<br>
fuel cells, some minor improvement in sulfur tolerance has been observed<br>
when certain compounds are added to the fuel side anode catalyst. The<br>
compounds that have shown some positive tolerance include Cr2O3, FeO,<br>
Fe2O3, Fe3O4, AI2O3, LiAIO2, LiCrO2, MO2, MO3 and WO3, as described in<br>
U.S. Patent 4,925,745, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0145] However, the low temperature acid fuel cell is fundamentally<br>
different than the solid oxide fuel cell. In the acid fuel cell, the ionized fuel<br>
must pass through the electrolyte to be reduced at the cathode by an<br>
oxidant. The fuel ion in this case is the hydrogen proton. When sulfur is<br>
present in the fuel, the ionization reaction at the anode is slowed. The<br>
mechanism for this occurrence is not well known, but it is believed to be<br>
related to the masking of the catalyst with the sulfur adsorbed onto the<br>
active catalytic material. In contrast, in the solid oxide fuel cell, it is the<br>
oxidant oxygen anion that must pass through the electrolyte to oxidize<br>
the fuel. The sulfur contamination of the fuel creates no hindrance for the<br>
ionization of the oxygen or its transport through the electrolyte.<br><br>
[0146] The fundamental differences between the two types of fuel cells<br>
can best be shown in Figure 25. Figure 25 compares the functionality of<br>
the solid oxide fuel cell 400 and an acid fuel cell 410.<br>
[0147] Referring to the acid fuel cell 410, the electrolyte 411 can be<br>
a membrane such as duPont's Nafion® or an inert matrix filled with<br>
phosphoric acid. Other acids may be used, but the Nafion© and matrix<br>
phosphoric acids are the more frequently used. The cathode electrode<br>
412 is attached to or placed against the electrolyte 411 and usually<br>
contains platinum metal as the ionization catalyst for the air oxidant 414.<br>
The platinum is often a finely divided platinum black bonded with Teflon<br>
or platinum supported on carbon and bonded with Nafion® ionomer. The<br>
anode electrode 41 3 is also attached to or placed against the electrolyte<br>
411 and is similar to the cathode electrode 412, except that ruthenium,<br>
rhodium, or other metals are frequently added to the platinum to make the<br>
anode electrode 413 more tolerant to CO gas in the hydrogen fuel 415.<br>
For many fuel cell applications, the source of hydrogen fuel 415 is a<br>
reformed hydrocarbon fuel. Usually the fuel source is scrubbed of sulfur<br>
down to the parts per billion (PPB) range. Otherwise, the anode electrode<br>
413 functionality is significantly reduced. Additionally, the reformed fuel<br>
is processed to reduce the CO volume content in the hydrogen fuel 415<br>
to less than 50 parts per million (PPM) to minimize the poisoning effect on<br>
the electrode. The hydrogen fuel 415 is ionized at anode electrode 413<br>
producing hydrogen protons. The protons then pass through the<br>
membrane 411 by the gradient created by the combination with oxygen<br>
anions produced on the cathode electrode 412 from air oxidant 414 to<br>
produce product water 412.<br>
[0148] Referring to solid oxide fuel cell 400, the electrolyte 401 is<br>
preferably yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), although other ceramic oxides,<br>
such as ceria are sometimes used together with or instead of YSZ. A<br><br>
preferred cathode electrode 402 is made from a 50:50 mixture of YSZ<br>
and LaO.BSrO.2MnO3 (LSM). Other materials may be used if desired. The<br>
cathode electrode 402 is attached to or placed against the electrolyte 401<br>
and ionizes the oxygen in the air oxidant 404. The oxygen anions pass<br>
through the electrolyte 401 by the gradient created by the consumption<br>
of the anions by combination with fuel ions. In the prior art solid oxide<br>
fuel cells, the anode electrode 403 is a often a ceramic-metallic (cermet)<br>
of Ni and YSZ, while Cu is sometimes used instead of Ni. Hydrogen fuel<br>
405 is ionized at the anode electrode 403 and combines with the oxygen<br>
anions to form water.<br>
[0149] One of the significant advantages of the solid oxide fuel cell<br>
is the potential for direct hydrocarbon fuel feed to the operating cell<br>
anode. The prior art Ni/YSZ anode electrode performs very well with pure<br>
hydrogen fuel, but when attempting to internally reform a hydrocarbon<br>
fuel into a hydrogen rich fuel stream the Ni/YSZ anode electrode has<br>
shortcomings related to carbon formation and sulfur poisoning. To reduce<br>
carbon formation in the prior art solid oxide fuel cell, water (i.e., water<br>
vapor) is added to the. hydrocarbon fuel to prevent carbon formation.<br>
Although the fuel cell product water is generated within the anode<br>
electrode, even more water must be added to the fuel to prevent the<br>
carbon formation. This extra water must be introduced with the incoming<br>
fuel, which complicates the operation of the fuel cell. Second, the prior<br>
art Ni/YSZ electrode cannot tolerate even the 10 ppm sulfur normally<br>
found in natural gas. Thus, expensive sulfur scrubbing equipment is often<br>
used to reduce the sulfur content of the fuel, which increases the cost of<br>
the electricity generation.<br>
[0150] Thus, in a first preferred aspect of the fourth embodiment,<br>
sulfur tolerant compounds are used in combination with or instead of Ni in<br>
the anode cermet of a solid oxide fuel cell.. The sulfur tolerant<br><br>
compounds include any compounds which increase the anode tolerance to<br>
sulfur in the fuel stream. While the inventors do not want to be bound by<br>
any theory of operation of the sulfur tolerant compounds, it is believed<br>
that the sulfur tolerant compounds prevent or reduce the formation of<br>
sulfur on the anode. The preferred sulfur tolerant compounds include<br>
MoWOx, RuO2, WOx, such as WO2.5, MOS2, WS2, and PtSx. Some<br>
compounds, such as WOx are also CO tolerant. Less preferred<br>
compounds include sulfur tolerant catalysts usable in a molten carbonate<br>
fuel cell, such as Cr2O3, FeO; Fe2O3, Fe3O4, AI2O3, LiAIO2, LiCrO2, MO2,<br>
MO3 and WO3, as described in U.S. Patent 4,925,745, incorporated<br>
herein by reference. Preferably, the anode cermet comprises the<br>
ceramic, such as (YSZ), and a catalyst. The catalyst preferably comprises<br>
1 0 to 90 weight % Ni or Cu and 10 to 90 weight percent of the sulfur<br>
tolerant compound. Most preferably, the catalyst comprises 30 to 70<br>
weight % Ni or Cu and 30 to 70 weight percent of the sulfur tolerant<br>
compound. However, some sulfur tolerant compounds, such as PtS.x,<br>
may be used without Ni or Cu and comprise 100% of the catalyst.<br>
[0151] These sulfur tolerant catalyst compounds in combination<br>
with or replacing the Ni in the anode electrode cermet provide an<br>
increased tolerance to sulfur in the fuel. The sulfur tolerant catalyst<br>
allows the solid oxide fuel cell to be used with a hydrogen fuel source<br>
containing contaminate levels of sulfur compounds, such as more than 10<br>
ppb, for example more than 100 ppb. The three elements that combine in<br>
a non-obvious manner to achieve this tolerance include: weak tolerance of<br>
the Ni cermet to sulfur, uninhibited availability of an oxidant within the<br>
anode electrode, and elevated operational temperature.<br>
[0152] In another preferred aspect of the fourth embodiment, the<br>
environmental tolerant anode catalyst comprises a fuel starvation tolerant<br>
catalyst. When the solid oxide fuel cell is operating at steady state, the<br><br>
reactants are independently flow controlled. The cathode airflow is<br>
generelly controlled to supply sufficient oxygen for the cathode reaction<br>
and to remove the waste heat from the fuel cell reaction. Usually airflow<br>
1.5 to 2.5 times the stoichiometric requirements is ample to satisfy the<br>
cathode reaction. Heat removal will generally require much more airflow<br>
than that required in satisfying the cathode reaction and therefore, there<br>
is no reasonable concern that a cell will become oxygen starved.<br>
[0153] On the other hand, the fuel is flow controlled only to support<br>
the anode reaction. In this case, the fuel flow is generally set at about<br>
1.2 times the stoichiometric requirements of the anode in order to<br>
maintain a high level of fuel utilization. This high level of fuel utilization is<br>
required to obtain a high overall system efficiency.<br>
[0154] In the prior art solid oxide fuel cells, a problem develops<br>
when there is an instantaneous requirement for an increased electrical<br>
output from the solid oxide fuel cell stack. Under these conditions, the air<br>
supply is more than ample to support the increased reaction rates within<br>
all the cells. However, one or more cells in the stack can be fuel starved<br>
until the fuel control adjusts the fuel flow to the new reaction rates.<br>
During the few seconds that it takes to adjust the fuel flow, the anode<br>
catalyst can be permanently damaged. Since the cells in a planar solid<br>
oxide stack are in electrical series, the entire stack can be rendered<br>
useless.<br>
[0155] The fundamental reason for cell anode damage is illustrated<br>
in Figure 26. Figure 26 shows the functionality of the solid oxide fuel cell<br>
500 in the normal anode and normal cathode reaction modes and the<br>
anode reaction in the fuel starved mode.<br>
[0156] Referring to the solid oxide fuel cell 500 in the normal<br>
operating mode, the electrolyte 501 is usually yttria-stabilized zirconia<br><br>
(YSZ), although other ceramic oxides such as ceria are sometimes used.<br>
The typical cathode electrode 502 is made from a 50:50 mixture of YSZ<br>
and LaO.BSrO.2MnO3 (LSM). Other materials may be used if desired. The<br>
cathode electrode 502 is attached to or placed against the electrolyte 501<br>
and ionizes the oxygen in the air oxidant 504. The oxygen anions pass<br>
through the electrolyte 501 by the gradient created by the consumption<br>
of the anions by combination with fuel ions. A prior art anode electrode<br>
503 is configured with a ceramic-metallic (cermet) of Ni and YSZ.<br>
Alternately, Cu is sometimes used as the metal in the cermet for the<br>
anode electrode. Hydrogen/CO fuel 505 is ionized at the anode electrode<br>
503 and combines with the oxygen anions to form water and CO2.<br>
[0157] When a section of an individual solid oxide fuel cell within a<br>
stack becomes fuel starved, the cell becomes an electrical load instead of<br>
an electrical power generator. This occurs because other cells in the stack<br>
have sufficient fuel to support the reaction and these cells drive the cell(s)<br>
that has become a load. Under these conditions, the fuel starved cell<br>
polarity reverses and oxygen is evolved from the anode. The cathode<br>
electrode and the electrolyte continue to operate as they had when<br>
operation in the fuel cell mode.<br>
[0158] When the fuel flow rate is restored to normal, the load cell(s)<br>
reverts back to the power generating fuel cell mode. Unfortunately, in the<br>
process of evolving oxygen, the standard Ni/YSZ anode electrode is<br>
oxidized and permanently damaged because Ni is not a fuel starvation<br>
tolerant catalyst.<br>
[0159] The present inventors have realized that if a metal which<br>
forms a reversible oxide without damage to the metal is added to the<br>
anode, then the anode is rendered fuel starvation tolerant. Such a metal<br>
forms an oxide when oxidized and reverts back to a pure metal without<br>
significant damage when the oxide is reduced by the fuel reaction at the<br>
anode. Preferably, the fuel starvation tolerant compound include platinum<br>
group metals, such as platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and<br>
ruthenium. Low temperature water electrolysis shows that platinum<br>
metal electrodes can be oxidized and reduced without damage. Other<br>
catalytic materials or additives that display this characteristic include<br>
ruthenium and tungsten at various oxide levels. The use of these<br>
metals/oxides in various ratios provides the tolerance to the oxidative<br>
anode conditions during fuel starvation.<br>
[0160] Preferably, the anode 503 comprises a cermet which<br>
includes the ceramic, such as (YSZ), and a fuel starvation tolerant<br>
catalyst. The catalyst preferably comprises 10 to 90 weight % Ni or Cu<br>
and 10 to 90 weight percent of the fuel starvation tolerant material.<br>
Most preferably, the catalyst comprises 30 to 70 weight % Ni or Cu and<br>
30 to 70 weight percent of the fuel starvation tolerant material.<br>
Preferably, the fuel starvation tolerant material oxidizes preferentially to Ni<br>
during fuel starvation. However, some fuel starvation tolerant materials,<br>
such as Pt, may be used without Ni or Cu and comprise 100% of the<br>
catalyst.<br>
[0161] In a third preferred aspect of the fourth embodiment, the<br>
anode comprises an environmental tolerant catalyst which is both a sulfur<br>
tolerant catalyst and a fuel starvation tolerant catalyst. For example, the<br>
anode may contain a combination of similarly based fuel starvation and<br>
sulfur tolerant materials, such as Pt and PtSx, Ru and RuO2, and W and<br>
WOx. Alternatively, the anode may contain a combination of dissimilar<br>
catalysts, such as a Pt-WOx or Pt-HxWO3 as disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
5,922,488 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Thus, any<br>
combination of the sulfur tolerant and fuel starvation tolerant materials<br>
described above may be selected for the anode composition.<br><br>
[0162] Preferably, the anode 503 comprises a cermet which<br>
includes the ceramic, such as (YSZ), and a environment tolerant catalyst.<br>
The catalyst preferably comprises 10 to 90 weight % Ni or Cu, 5 to 45<br>
weight percent of the sulfur tolerant material and 5 to 45 weight percent<br>
of the fuel starvation tolerant material. Most preferably, the catalyst<br>
comprises 30 to 70 weight % Ni or Cu, 15 to 35 weight percent of the<br>
sulfur tolerant material and 15 to 35 weight percent of the fuel starvation<br>
tolerant material. However, some sulfur tolerant and fuel starvation<br>
tolerant materials, such as Pt, may be used without Ni or Cu and<br>
comprise 1 00% of the catalyst.<br>
[0163] The anodes may be formed using any known cermet<br>
fabrication methods. The Ni or Cu metals, sulfur tolerant materials and/or<br>
the fuel starvation tolerant materials may be incorporated into the cermet<br>
by any suitable method. For example, these materials may be deposited<br>
by co-deposition, co-electrodepositon, freeze drying or sequential<br>
deposition. Thus, the environmental tolerant material may be alloyed or<br>
admixed with Ni or Cu and then provided into the YSZ to form the<br>
cermet. For example, the environmental tolerant material may be alloyed<br>
or admixed with Ni or Cu and then provided into YSZ using a wet<br>
(solution), a dry (powder) or a sputtering process. Alternatively, the<br>
environmental tolerant material may be alloyed or admixed with Ni or Cu<br>
and then placed on a support, such as a foam support or a dry ice<br>
support, and then pressed into contact with the YSZ. The catalyst is<br>
diffused into the YSZ to form the cermet by sintering and/or pressing. If<br>
dry ice is used, then the dry ice is sublimed to diffuse the catalyst into the<br>
YSZ.<br>
V. The Fifth Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0164] In the fifth embodiment of the present invention, the inventor<br>
has realized that the solid oxide fuel cell system can be simplified, when<br>
feeding a hydrocarbon fuel directly to the solid oxide fuel cell anode for<br>
internal reforming to a hydrogen rich reactant by supplying the reforming<br>
process steam from the anode exhaust enthalpy recovery. In other<br>
words, only the product water (i.e., water vapor) is added to the fuel<br>
provided into the anode.<br>
[0165] In the low temperature PEM fuel cells, cathode enthalpy is<br>
recovered and returned to the cathode inlet to prevent the dry out of the<br>
water saturated membrane. In this case, the incoming oxidant air is<br>
humidified and membrane dry out is avoided. Several methods have been<br>
developed to accomplish this water and heat transfer including hydrated<br>
membranes, water injection, and cycling desiccants. One method includes<br>
using a device called an enthalpy wheel. The enthalpy wheel is a porous<br>
cylindrical wheel with internal passages that are coated with desiccant. It<br>
rotates slowly in one direction, allowing the transfer of sensible and latent<br>
heat from the hot saturated air exhaust to the cool dry air inlet.<br>
[0166] In the solid oxide fuel cell, there is no need to maintain the<br>
saturation of any of the components. In the case of a solid oxide fuel cell<br>
operating with pure hydrogen and air reactants, these reactants can be<br>
absolutely free of any water vapor. The prior art Ni/YSZ anode electrode<br>
performs very well with pure hydrogen fuel. However, when attempting<br>
to internally reform a hydrocarbon fuel into a hydrogen rich fuel stream,<br>
the Ni/YSZ anode electrode has shortcomings related to carbon formation.<br>
To reduce carbon formation in the prior art solid oxide fuel cell, water<br>
(i.e., water vapor) is added from an external boiler to the hydrocarbon fuel<br>
to prevent carbon formation on the anode. For the purpose of fuel steam<br>
reforming within the anode of a solid oxide fuel cell, a high rate of water<br>
vapor (i.e., steam), amounting to approximately a 3:1 steam to carbon<br><br>
ratio, must be injected into the fuel before introduction into the fuel cell<br>
anode. The use of the extra boiler complicates the electricity generation<br>
process and increases its cost.<br>
[0167] The present inventors realized that product water vapor<br>
emitted from the anode side exhaust of the solid oxide fuel cell may be<br>
recirculated into the fuel being provided into the anode input to prevent or<br>
reduce the carbon formation on the anode. The enthalpy wheel is a<br>
preferred device to control the water and heat transferred from the anode<br>
exhaust of a solid oxide fuel cell to the anode inlet. The control of the<br>
amount of water introduced with the fuel is used to prevent carbon<br>
formation with too little water and to prevent fuel starvation with too<br>
much water. The water transfer rate is controlled by the speed of the<br>
wheel.<br>
[0168] The fundamentals of the system 600 employing an enthalpy<br>
wheel in the solid oxide fuel cell fuel stream are illustrated in Figure 27A.<br>
The hydrocarbon fuel supply is delivered through conduit 604 to enthalpy<br>
wheel 601. Within the enthalpy wheel 601, the fuel supply receives<br>
water vapor and heat from the anode side fuel exhaust. The warm wet<br>
fuel supply is then delivered to an optional heat exchanger 602 through<br>
conduit 605. Within the heat exchanger 602, the fuel exhaust heats the<br>
warm wet fuel supply further. The hot wet fuel supply is then delivered to<br>
the anode chambers within the solid oxide fuel cell stack 603 through<br>
conduit 606. Within the solid oxide fuel cell anode chambers the hot wet<br>
hydrocarbon fuel supply is reformed into a mixture of hydrogen, water<br>
vapor, and carbon oxides. Nearly simultaneously, most of the hydrogen<br>
and carbon monoxide are converted to more water vapor and more carbon<br>
dioxide, respectively, from the reaction with the oxygen anions in the<br>
anode catalyst.<br>
[0169] The fuel exhaust gasses, with significantly more water vapor<br>
than was introduced into the solid oxide fuel cell anode chambers, return<br>
to heat exchanger 602 through conduit 607. Within heat exchanger 602<br>
some of the heat in the exhaust stream is given up to the inlet fuel<br>
supply. The fuel exhaust is then delivered back to the enthalpy wheel 601<br>
through conduit 608. Within the enthalpy wheel 601, much of the water<br>
vapor and remaining heat in the fuel exhaust is transferred to the inlet fuel<br>
supply.<br>
[0170] The rotational speed of the enthalpy wheel is modulated to<br>
optimize the water vapor flux. The fuel exhaust then leaves the system<br>
through outlet conduit 609. Preferably, 0% to 90%, such as 20 to 70%<br>
of the product water vapor is transferred to the fuel supply. Preferably,<br>
all heat transferred to the fuel supply is through the enthalpy wheel and<br>
heat exchanger.<br>
[0171] In an alternative embodiment, the enthalpy wheel is replaced<br>
with at least two adsorption beds, as illustrated in Figure 27B. The first<br>
adsorption bed 610 is used to adsorb water and water vapor from the<br>
anode exhaust, while letting anode exhaust gases, such as CO, CO2, H2<br>
and methane, to pass through to the outlet conduit 609. The second<br>
adsorption bed 611 is used to provide water that was previously collected<br>
from the anode exhaust. When the supply of water is exhausted in the<br>
second bed 611, the anode exhaust is provided into the second bed,<br>
while the first bed 610 is used to provide the water or water vapor into<br>
the inlet fuel. If desired, a reformer may also be added between the fuel<br>
inlet 604 and the fuel cell stack 603, preferably between the heat<br>
exchanger 602 and the fuel ceil stack 603.<br>
[0172] Any suitable method may be used to provide anode exhaust<br>
and fuel supply through the adsorbent beds. For example, as shown in<br>
Figure 27B, a first vaive 612, such as a four way valve, switches fuel<br>
input from fuel inlet 604 between the first 610 and the second 611<br>
adsorbent bed. The valve 612 also switches the exhaust being provided<br>
from the first 61 0 or the second 611 beds to the outlet conduit 609. The<br>
conduit 608 connects the first adsorbent bed 610 with a first heat<br>
exchanger inlet 614 or a first heat exchanger outlet 615 via a second<br>
valve 613, such as a four way valve. The conduit 605 connects the<br>
second adsorbent bed 611 with the first heat exchanger inlet 614 or the<br>
first heat exchanger outlet 615 via valve 613. When the valve 61 3 is in a<br>
first position, it provides a fluid path between the first adsorbent bed 610<br>
and the first heat exchanger outlet 615 and between the second<br>
adsorbent bed 611 and the first heat exchanger inlet 614. When the<br>
valve 613 is in a second position, it provides a fluid path between the<br>
first adsorbent bed 610 and the first heat exchanger inlet 614 and<br>
between the second adsorbent bed 611 and the first heat exchanger<br>
outlet 615. If desired, other configurations may be used. For example,<br>
four way valve 613 may be replaced with two three way valves, each<br>
respective valve being located between the heat exchanger 602 and<br>
respective conduits 605, 608.<br>
[0173] During operation, the system 600 can be run without using a<br>
boiler to provide water vapor into the inlet fuel. However, a small boiler<br>
may be added to the system. This boiler may be run during operation<br>
start up to provide water into the fuel inlet while the system is warming<br>
up and sufficient water vapor is being generated at the anode exhaust.<br>
[0174] This system is advantageous because it provides simple<br>
transfer of water vapor and heat in a controlled fashion such that the<br>
proper conditions at the solid oxide fuel cell anode electrodes for internal<br>
steam reforming are met. The enthalpy wheel and heat exchanger may be<br>
used to provide the entire supply of water vapor and heat for the fuel<br>
supply to operate the solid oxide fuel cell.<br>
VI. The Sixth Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0175] The sixth preferred embodiment is directed to a felt seal. Fuel<br>
cell stacks, particularly those with planar geometry, often use seals<br>
between electrolyte and interconnect surfaces to contain fuel and air (see<br>
Figure 28). These seals must maintain, their integrity at high operating<br>
temperatures and (on the cathode side) in an oxidizing environment-<br>
Furthermore, expansion and contraction of the seal and the components<br>
in contact with the seal due to thermal cycling or compression should not<br>
result in damage of any of the components during its expected life.<br>
[0176] Many compliant seals, such as elastomeric o-rings and gaskets,<br>
do not crack and tend to absorb stresses in an assembly that arise from<br>
thermal expansion and compression. However, these seals cannot be<br>
used at high temperatures because the elastomeric materials used in them<br>
decompose, degrade, or oxidize.<br>
10177] Many types of seals used at elevated temperatures, such as<br>
brazes and metal gaskets, are not compliant or elastic. Some assemblies<br>
are difficult to seal with brazes or gaskets because of operating conditions<br>
or material incompatibilities. They may often have a limited life as well,<br>
tolerating only a relatively few number of thermal cycles before they fail.<br>
Also, when some assemblies are sealed with these materials, differences<br>
in the coefficients of thermal expansion result in mechanical stresses that<br>
can lead to failure of the seal or the components of the assembly. Also,<br>
non-compliant seals often present difficulties and high costs of fabrication<br>
and assembly due to the tighter tolerances which are required, in flatness<br>
for example.<br>
[0178] The sixth preferred embodiment is directed to a sealing<br>
arrangement that is both compliant and capable of operating at high<br>
temperatures in oxidizing and reducing environments. The sealing member<br>
is capable of sealing dissimilar materials, such as a metal and a ceramic,<br>
and similar materials that may or may not differ in composition, such as<br>
two ceramics or two metals. Since the sealing member is elastic and<br>
compliant at device operating temperatures, it may be used to seal two<br>
materials with dissimilar coefficients of thermal expansion. This sea! may<br>
be advantageously used in a solid oxide fuel cell, where the operating<br>
temperatures are in the range of 600 to 800 °C.<br>
[0179] A gas-tight compliant seal between surfaces can be made from<br>
a felt. Here, "felt" is used to describe a compliant layer of a material that<br>
can endure the elevated operating temperature and atmosphere of the<br>
device it is being applied to. In some cases, the felt may be composed of<br>
a malleable metal or alloy. However, this definition does not restrict this<br>
term to metals. The compliant layer can for example be made from non-<br>
metallic fibrous materials, such as silica. This compliant layer can be made<br>
up from fibers, as indicated by the word "felt," but also other thick and<br>
compliant constructions, for example foams, such as small cell foams.<br>
Thus, the seal is preferably made from a compliant metal or a ceramic<br>
fibrous or foam material.<br>
[0180] The felt is made gas impermeable by one of several means, and<br>
is sealed by one of several means to the mating surfaces. The felt gives<br>
compliance to the seal, allowing it to absorb stresses caused by<br>
compression and thermal expansion and contraction of the assembly of<br>
which it is part. The means used to make the felt impermeable and to<br>
seal the felt to the mating surfaces are also compliant in nature.<br>
Appropriate selection of the composition of the various elements of the<br>
seal allows the seal to be made according to various criteria, including<br>
operating temperatures, oxidizing or reducing environments, and cost.<br>
[0181] Two mating surfaces (701 and 702) are shown in Figure 28. A<br>
seal must be made between these two surfaces in order to prevent gas<br>
exchange in either direction between sides 705 and 706.<br>
[0182] In one case shown in Figure 28, a felt sealing member 710 is<br>
placed between the mating surfaces 701 and 702. The felt sealing<br>
member 710 is sealed to the mating surfaces through application of a<br>
sealing material 720 that is soft at the device operating temperature but is<br>
impermeable to the gases of interest in the application. For example, this<br>
may be a glass or glaze compound. One example of a glaze is a Duncan®<br>
ceramic glaze GL611. This material can be applied to the felt or to the<br>
mating surfaces prior to assembly, for example by dipping the felt sealing<br>
member and/or the mating surfaces into the molten glass or glaze. The<br>
material softens at elevated temperatures and mates the felt to the<br>
surfaces, but remains impermeable to gases. The material 720 is optional<br>
if the felt seal contains appropriate means of mating the felt to the<br>
surfaces, as is the case in many preferred aspects.<br>
[0183] The felt sealing member 710 is made impermeable to gases by<br>
one of several ways. In one preferred aspect, the porous felt is filled prior<br>
to assembly with a filler material 730 that is soft at the device operating<br>
temperature. For example, this may be a glass, or glaze mixture. After<br>
firing, the glassy residue makes the felt impermeable to gases, but<br>
because the material 730 softens at the operating temperature, the felt-<br>
glass composite remains compliant. In subsequent paragraphs and<br>
figures, it is assumed that same-numbered items carry their previous<br>
definitions.<br>
[0184] In another preferred aspect (Figure 29), the felt sealing member<br>
710 is made impermeable to gases by melting a felt surface 740 into a<br>
solid layer that is non-parallel, such as perpendicular, to the mating<br>
surfaces. The solid layer which is formed to be thin enough to remain<br>
flexible. A solid layer means a layer that has a much lower porosity than<br>
the felt, such as a porosity of 70% or less than the felt. This solid layer<br>
may be formed by selectively heating a portion of the felt sealing member<br>
710 to transform the heated portion to a solid layer, such as a closed cell<br>
metal foam layer. For example, a surface 740 of the felt sealing member<br>
710 may be selectively heated by a laser to form the solid layer.<br>
[0185] in another preferred aspect (Figure 30), the felt sealing member<br>
710 is made impermeable to gases by forming a solid layer 750 on felt<br>
sealing member 710 that is perpendicular and parallel to the mating<br>
surfaces described previously. The parallel solid surfaces provide an<br>
improved contact area for the seal.<br>
[0186] In another preferred aspect (Figure 31), the felt sealing member<br>
710 is made impermeable to gases through application of a barrier foil<br>
layer 760 that is non-parallel, such as perpendicular, to the mating<br>
surfaces. The foil adheres to the felt via a material such as that which is<br>
used to attach the felt to the mating surfaces. Alternatively, the foil may<br>
be pressed into place and held by a second felt sealing member or other<br>
component. The foil 760 is compliant because it is thin. Preferably, the<br>
foil is a thin metal foil. The foil extends between mating surfaces 701,<br>
702 to block the flow of gas between sides 705 and 706.<br>
[0187] In another preferred aspect (Figure 32), the felt sealing member<br>
710 is made impermeable to gases through application of several foils.<br>
Foil 770 is non-parallel, such as perpendicular, to the mating surfaces as<br>
described previously, and foils 772 and 774 extend into the area parallel<br>
to the mating surfaces. These foils 772, 774 provide improved contact<br>
area for the sealing member. They may also produce adhesion between<br>
the sealing member and the mating surfaces. The foils 770, 772, and 774<br>
may be the same or different materials depending on the various<br>
compositions of the felt 710 and mating surfaces 701 and 702. They<br>
may comprise separate components or one continuous piece of foil.<br>
[0188] In another preferred aspect (Figure 33), the felt sealing member<br>
710 is made impermeable to gases through deposition of a gas<br>
impermeable material layer on the felt 710. This material may be<br>
deposited on the felt by various methods, including but not restricted to,<br>
dipping and evaporation, physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor<br>
deposition, thermal spray, plasma spray, and precipitation from a liquid.<br>
Material portion 780 is non-parallel, such as perpendicular, to the mating<br>
surfaces 701, 702. Preferably, portions 782, 784 of the gas<br>
impermeable material layer extend into the area parallel to the mating<br>
surfaces 701, 702. These portions 782, 784 provide an improved<br>
contact area for the sealing member. They may also produce adhesion<br>
between the felt sealing member 710 and the mating surfaces. The<br>
impermeable material layer portions 780, 782, and 784 may be the same<br>
or different materials depending on the various compositions of the felt<br>
710 and mating surfaces 701 and 702.<br>
[0189] In another preferred aspect (Figure 34), the felt sealing member<br>
790 is made impermeable to gases in its initial preparation. For example,<br>
the felt may be prepared as a closed-cell foam.<br>
[0190] The felt composition can be selected so as to operate well in the<br>
atmosphere present in the device containing the felt seal. For example, in<br>
an oxidizing atmosphere the felt may be composed of a suitable M-Cr-AI-Y<br>
material, where M comprises at least one metal selected from Fe, Co, or<br>
Ni. In another example, the felt may be composed of Inconel alloy, in<br>
another example, in a reducing atmosphere, the felt may be composed of<br>
nickel. Other metals, alloys, or indeed other malleable materials or<br>
compounds metal may be used depending on the application<br>
requirements. One example of forming a felt sealing member 710 (nickel<br>
felt) with a gas impermeable material 730 (glass) is as follows. A nickel<br>
felt (i.e. foam) with a density of 15% relative to solid nickel is saturated<br>
with a molten glass. The felt is fired to remove volatiles, leaving behind a<br>
glass residue that renders the felt impermeable to gases. The felt is placed<br>
between two mating surfaces, for example a metal sheet and zirconia. To<br>
each of the mating surfaces a layer of glass seal is applied where the felt-<br>
glass composite will contact the surfaces. The felt is placed between the<br>
surfaces, compressed, and fired.<br>
[0191] The seal can take the shape of the mating surfaces to be sealed.<br>
For example, if the mating surfaces are rectangular, the seal may take the<br>
form of a rectangular gasket, if the mating surfaces contain open areas,<br>
such as in an assembly with internal gas manifolds or flow ducts, the seal<br>
can accommodate and seal such open areas. This is illustrated in Figure<br>
35, where one of the mating surfaces (794) contains flow channels which<br>
are sealed from the center of the surface and from the exterior of the<br>
surface by the felt gasket 797.<br>
[0192] All embodiments of the felt seal can be placed in a structure in<br>
one or both mating surfaces, for example in a groove in a mating surface,<br>
that provides containment and additional compression and adhesion<br>
surfaces.<br>
[0193] The felt part of the seal may also serve other roles, such as<br>
current collector/distributor, flow distributor, etc. in a fuel cell stack, such<br>
as a solid oxide fuel stack.<br>
VII. The Seventh Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0194] The seventh preferred embodiment is directed to felt current<br>
conductors / gas flow distributors for fuel cell stacks. Fuel cell stacks,<br>
particularly those with planar geometry, often use utilize some material to<br>
conduct electrons from the anode to the separator plate and from the<br>
separator plate to the cathode. This material typically has a better<br>
electrical conductivity than the porous electrode (i.e., anode and/or<br>
cathode) material. Usually this material is distinguished from the<br>
electrodes in that it also must provide flow distribution of oxygen- or fuel-<br>
bearing gases. This material is often called a current conductor / gas<br>
flow distributor ("conductor/distributor" herein after). In some cases,<br>
these conductor/distributors may provide structural support to the fuel cell<br>
stack. Some examples of prior art conductor/distributors include metal<br>
wire coils, wire grids, and metal ribs. These may be used independently or<br>
in some combination.<br>
[0195] The prior art conductor/distributors sometimes exhibit less-<br>
than-optimal current conduction or gas flow distribution properties. They<br>
are also costly to implement. Also, many of the prior art<br>
conductor/distributors are not compliant (i.e., not elastic at the fuel cell<br>
operating temperatures). Non-compliant components often present<br>
difficulties and high costs in fabrication and assembly of the fuel cells due<br>
to the tighter fuel cell tolerances which are required.<br>
[0196] The present inventors realized that a porous conductive felt<br>
can serve as a current conductor and gas flow distributor with better<br>
properties than the prior art conductor/distributors and may be less costly<br>
to implement. In some preferred aspects, the felt conductor/distributor<br>
can also serve as a seal or as a support for other fuel cell stack<br>
components. The use of a compliant, conductive felt reduces the<br>
probability of component and assembly failure during thermal cycling and<br>
compression of a fuel cell stack, preferably a high temperature fuel cell<br>
stack, such as a solid oxide or molten carbonate fuel cell stack.<br>
[0197] Here, "conductive felt" is used to describe a compliant layer<br>
of electrically conductive material that can endure the operating<br>
temperature and atmosphere of the device (i.e., fuel cell stack) in which it<br>
is located. In some cases, the felt may be composed of a malleable metal<br>
or alloy. However, this definition does not restrict the term "felt" to<br>
metals. The felt conductor/distributor can for example be made from other<br>
porous, conductive materials, such as a silica-metal composite. The felt<br>
conductor/distributor should be made conductive and gas permeable and<br>
can be made up from fibers, foams and other relatively thick, compliant,<br>
conductive and gas permeable structures.<br>
[0198] A conductor/distributor comprising a gas permeable (i.e.,<br>
porous) conductive felt with composition chosen to be appropriate for the<br>
conditions specified by the application. For example, the felt material is<br>
chosen such that it remains conductive and gas permeable at the fuel cell<br>
operating temperature. The felt conductor/distributor is located in contact<br>
with the active area of the fuel electrode (i.e., anode or cathode). The fuel<br>
cell separator plate is placed in contact with the conductor/distributor.<br>
Various ways may be used to ensure electrical contact between<br>
electrode, conductor/distributor, and separator plate.<br>
[0199] Figure 36 shows repeating elements of a fuel cell stack<br>
containing an electrolyte 810, an anode 820, a cathode 830, anode seal<br>
840, cathode seal 845, and a separator plate 850, such as metal plates.<br>
A second separator plate 850 is also shown in the diagram to illustrate<br>
the connection to the next cell of the stack. The stack may be internally<br>
or externally manifolded, as will be described in more detail below.<br>
[0200] The anode 820 and cathode 830 are often optimized for the<br>
electrochemical reactions they are catalyzing. Often, they are not<br>
optimized for electrical conductivity or for distribution of fuel- and oxygen-<br>
bearing gases. Therefore, anode conductor/distributors 860 and cathode<br>
conductor/distributors 870 are provided to fill these roles. The separator<br>
plates 850 may be omitted if the felt conductor/distributors are<br>
constructed to also perform the function of the separator plates.<br>
[0201] In one preferred aspect of the seventh preferred<br>
embodiment, the anode conductor/distributor 860 is composed of a<br>
conductive felt. The felt conducts electrons, from the anode to the<br>
separator plate. Since the felt is gas permeable, it also allows fuel to<br>
reach the anode surface, and the reaction byproducts to leave the surface<br>
and exhaust from the cell. The electrical contact between anode and felt,<br>
and between separator plate and felt, may be enhanced by adding a layer<br>
of an optional adhesive or contact material. The composition of the felt is<br>
chosen as appropriate for the fuel cell operating conditions. For example,<br>
a nickel felt with a density of 1 5 to 35%, preferably about 25% relative<br>
to the density of solid nickel and a thickness of 0.5 to 4 mm, preferably<br>
about 2 mm may be used in a high temperature fuel cell, such as a solid<br>
oxide fuel cell, with a reducing atmosphere and a temperature of 600 to<br>
850°C, such as 800°C, The felt may be potted in a nickel-YSZ cermet on<br>
either the anode or separator plate sides of the connection, or on both<br>
sides.<br>
[0202] In another preferred aspect of the seventh preferred<br>
embodiment, the cathode conductor/distributor 870 is composed of a<br>
conductive felt. The felt conducts electrons from the separator plate to<br>
the cathode. It also allows oxygen to reach the cathode surface, and the<br>
oxygen depleted air to leave the surface and exhaust from the cell. The<br>
electrical contact between cathode and felt, and between separator plate<br><br>
and felt, may be enhanced by adding a layer of an optional adhesive or<br>
contact material. The composition of the felt is chosen as appropriate for<br>
the fuel cell operating conditions. For example, a Fe-Cr-AI-Y felt with a<br>
density of 5 to 30%, preferably about 15% relative to the density of the<br>
solid metal alloy and a thickness of 0.5 to 4 mm, preferably 2 mm, may<br>
be used in a high temperature fuel cell, such as a solid oxide fuel cell, in<br>
an oxidizing atmosphere at 650 to 850oC, such as about 800°C. If<br>
desired, some or all of Fe may be substituted by Co and/or Ni in the Fe-<br>
Cr-Al-Y felt. The felt may be potted in a lanthanum-strontium manganite<br>
(LSM) perovskite on either the cathode or separator plate sides of the<br>
connection, or on both sides.<br>
[0203] Preferably, both the anode 860 and cathode 870<br>
conductor/distributors are made from a felt. In subsequent paragraphs<br>
and figures, it is assumed that same-numbered items carry their previous<br>
definitions.<br>
[0204] In another preferred aspect of the seventh preferred<br>
embodiment, the anode and/or cathode conductor/distributors contain a<br>
non-uniform surface. Preferably, the conductor/distributor(s) contain ribs<br>
which provide a desired pressure drop or flow distribution pattern. Other<br>
surface features, such as dimples, lines, or a particular pore geometry<br>
may be used to exercise control over pressure drop or flow distribution.<br>
[0205] In another preferred aspect of the seventh embodiment<br>
(Figure 37), the anode conductor/distributor 860 is combined with the<br>
anode-side felt seal of the sixth preferred embodiment. The anode<br>
conductor/distributor and seal is made of one continuous piece of<br>
material. The anode conductor/distributor 860 can be used in conjunction<br>
with any of the various preferred aspects of the sixth embodiment<br>
describing the felt seal.<br>
[0206] In another preferred aspect of the seventh embodiment<br>
(Figure 38), the cathode conductor/distributor 870 is combined with the<br>
cathode-side felt seal of the sixth preferred embodiment. The cathode<br>
conductor/distributor and seal is made of one continuous piece of<br>
material. The cathode conductor/distributor 870 can be used in<br>
conjunction with any of the various preferred aspects of the sixth<br>
embodiment describing the felt seal. Most preferably, both the anode and<br>
cathode conductor/distributors are combined with the felt seal.<br>
[0207] In another preferred aspect of the seventh preferred<br>
embodiment (Figure 39), the anode conductor/distributor 860 provides the<br>
structural support for the separator plate 850. In this aspect, the<br>
separator plate material may be made as thin as practicality and<br>
serviceability allows. Preferably, the separator plate comprises a thin film<br>
deposited onto the anode conductor/distributor 860 by various thin film<br>
deposition techniques, including but not limited to thermal or plasma<br>
spray, chemical or physical vapor deposition (i.e., CVD or sputtering),<br>
precipitation, and dipping. Alternatively, the thin separator plate 850 may<br>
comprise an integral component that is placed in contact with the<br>
conductor/distributor. Preferably, a "thin film", is less than 500 microns<br>
thick, more preferably, less than 100 microns thick, most preferably 10 to<br>
30 microns thick. In this case, the felt conductor/distributor thickness is<br>
sufficient to act as a substrate for the thin film, such as a thickness of<br>
greater than 30 microns, preferably greater than 100 microns.<br>
[0208] In another preferred aspect of the seventh preferred<br>
embodiment (Figure 40), the cathode conductor/distributor 870 provides<br>
the structural support for the separator plate 850. In this aspect, the<br>
separator plate material may be made as thin as practicality and<br>
serviceability allows. Preferably, the separator plate comprises a thin film<br>
deposited onto the cathode conductor/distributor 870 by various thin film<br><br>
deposition techniques, including but not limited to thermal or plasma<br>
spray, chemical or physical vapor deposition (i.e., CVD or sputtering),<br>
precipitation, and dipping. Alternatively, the thin separator plate 850 may<br>
comprise an integral component that is placed in contact with the<br>
conductor/distributor. Preferably both the anode and cathode<br>
conductor/distributors serve as a support for their respective separator<br>
plates.<br>
[0209] In another preferred aspect shown in Figure 41, the anode<br>
conductor/distributor 860 serves as a seal and as separator plate support.<br>
In the figure, the anode conductor/distributor renumbered 865 is shown in<br>
one of its various preferred configurations.<br>
[0210] In another preferred aspect shown in Figure 42, the cathode<br>
conductor/distributor 870 serves also as seal and as separator plate<br>
support. In the figure, the cathode conductor/distributor renumbered 875<br>
is shown in one of its various preferred configurations.<br>
[0211] In subsequent paragraphs and figures, the<br>
conductor/distributors are described in their roles as support structures for<br>
other elements of the fuel cell stack. In these paragraphs and figures,<br>
item 865 refers to the anode conductor/distributor in one of its various<br>
previously described configurations, and item 875 refers to the cathode<br>
conductor/distributor in one of its various previously described<br>
configurations.<br>
[0212] In another preferred aspect shown in Figure 43, the anode<br>
conductor/distributor 865 and the cathode conductor/distributor 875<br>
together support a common separator plate 850 that is located between<br>
them. The separator plate 850 may be placed or deposited in any way so<br>
as to reduce the materials and assembly costs and increase the<br>
performance and quality of the assembly. Typically the separator plate<br><br>
850 would be made as thin as practicality and serviceability allows, such<br>
as a thin film plate.<br>
[0213] If the felt conductor/distributors 865 and 875 are combined<br>
with the seals, then the seal portions of the conductor/distributors can be<br>
made gas impermeable by any of the methods described in the sixth<br>
preferred embodiment. Alternatively, portions of the separator plate 850<br>
may be used to form a seal. For example, thin separator plate material or<br>
foil can be extended around the edges of either or both<br>
conductor/distributors as shown in Figure 44. These separator plate<br>
extension act as a gas impermeable seal.<br>
[0214] In another preferred aspect of the seventh embodiment<br>
shown in Figure 45, the anode conductor/distributor 865 and the cathode<br>
conductor/distributor 875 together support not only the separator plate<br>
850, but they also support the cathode 830, electrolyte 810, and anode<br>
820. The separator plate 850, cathode 830, electrolyte 810, and anode<br>
820 may be placed or deposited in any way so as to reduce the materials<br>
and assembly costs and increase the performance and quality of the<br>
assembly. Typically these components would be made as thin as<br>
practicality and serviceability allows. These components preferably<br>
comprise thin films (as defined above) that are preferably deposited on the<br>
conductor/distributor 865/875 "substrate" by various thin film deposition<br>
techniques described above.<br>
[0215] Figure 46 illustrates a three dimensional view of an internally<br>
manifolded fuel cell stack containing a common felt conductor/distributor<br>
and seal. In Figure 46, the fuel cell stack contains a separator plate 850,<br>
an anode felt conductor/distributor/seal 860, an electrolyte 810, and<br>
anode 820 and a cathode felt conductor/distributor/seal 870. The<br>
cathode is not visible in Figure 46 because it is located "behind" the<br>
electrolyte 820. The separator plate 850 and electrolyte 810 contain gas<br>
passages or openings 876, 877, 878 and 879. Specifically, passages<br>
876 are fuel inlet passages, passages 877 are fuel outlet passages,<br>
passages 878 are oxidizer inlet passages and passages 879 are oxidizer<br>
outlet passages.<br>
[0216] The anode felt conductor/distributor/seal 860 is made of a<br>
conductive felt. The entire anode felt conductor/distributor/seal 860 is<br>
gas permeable, except for gas impermeable seal region or strip 880. The<br>
cathode felt conductor/distributor/seal 870 is made of a conductive felt.<br>
The entire cathode felt conductor/distributor/seal 870 is gas permeable,<br>
except for gas impermeable seal region or strip 881.<br>
[0217] In the anode felt conductor/distributor/seal 860, the gas<br>
impermeable strip 880 circumscribes a gas permeable region 882 and<br>
seals it from a gas permeable region 883. In the cathode felt<br>
conductor/distributor/seal 870, the gas impermeable strip 881<br>
circumscribes a gas permeable region 884 and seals it from a gas<br>
permeable region 885.<br>
[0218] Region 882 lines up with the anode 820 and with the fuel<br>
passages 876 and 877 when the stack is assembled. Region 883 lines<br>
up with the oxidizer passages 878 and 879. Region 884 lines up with<br>
the cathode (not shown) and with the oxidizer passages 878 and 879.<br>
Region 885 lines up with fuel passages 876 and 877.<br>
[0219] The fuel cell stack operates as follows. The input or inlet<br>
fuel 886 (dashed lines in Figure 46) is provided into fuel inlet passage 876<br>
in separator plate 850. The fuel reaches the gas permeable region 882 in<br>
the anode conductor/distributor/seal 860. From here, the input fuel splits<br>
into two directions. One part of the fuel travels "down" through gas<br>
permeable felt region 882 and reacts at the anode 820. The fuel reaction<br><br>
products 887 then exit from region 882 through fuel outlet passage 877<br>
in the separator plate 850. Another part of the fuel travels through<br>
passage 876 in the electrolyte and passes through the gas permeable<br>
region 885 in the cathode conductor/distributor/seal 870. The gas<br>
impermeable strip or seal 880 prevents the fuel from entering region 883<br>
and reacting with the oxidizer. The gas impermeable strip or seal 881<br>
prevents the fuel from entering region 884 and contacting the cathode.<br>
[0220] The input or inlet oxidizer 888 (dotted-dashed lines in Figure<br>
46) is provided into oxidizer inlet passage 878 in separator plate 850.<br>
The oxidizer passes through the gas permeable region 883 in the anode<br>
conductor/distributor/seal 860. The oxidizer then travels through passage<br>
878 in the electrolyte and reaches the gas permeable region 884 in the<br>
cathode conductor/distributor/seal 870. From here, the input oxidizer<br>
splits into two directions. One part of the oxidizer travels "right" through<br>
gas permeable felt region 884 and reacts at the cathode. The reacted<br>
oxidizer 889 then travels back and exits from region 884 through oxidizer<br>
outlet passage 879 in the separator plate 850. The gas impermeable strip<br>
or seal 880 prevents the oxidizer from entering region 882 and contacting<br>
the anode. The gas impermeable strip or seal 881 prevents the oxidizer<br>
from entering region 885 and reacting with the fuel.<br>
[0221] The gas impermeable regions 880, 881 may be formed by<br>
any method described in the sixth embodiment, such as by selective<br>
heating or laser irradiation or selective addition of a gas impermeable<br>
material to the felt. Thus, the gas impermeable regions 880, 881 act as<br>
felt seals in the felt conductor/distributors 860, 870. They separate and<br>
prevent the fuel and oxidizer from contacting each other in the fuel cell<br>
stack. The fuel stacks and the seals 880, 881 may have any suitable<br>
shape and should not be considered limited to the shape illustrated in<br>
Figure 46. Furthermore, "down" and "right" are relative directions<br><br>
depending on the orientation of the fuel cell stack. It should be noted<br>
that the fuel and oxidizer cross the fuel stack in different, preferably<br>
perpendicular directions.<br>
[0222] The felt conductor/distributor/seals are not limited to unitary<br>
conductive felt sheets 860, 870 containing both the gas impermeable<br>
seals 880, 881 and the gas permeable conductor/distributors 882, 884.<br>
The gas impermeable seals may be formed in separate felt gaskets that<br>
are placed adjacent to the gas permeable felt conductor/distributors, as<br>
shown in Figure 47.<br>
[0223] In Figure 47, the conductive felt anode<br>
conductor/distributor/seal 890 comprises a gas impermeable felt gasket<br>
891 and a gas permeable felt conductor/distributor 860. The gasket 891<br>
contains a large opening 892, which lines up with the<br>
conductor/distributor 860 and with the fuel inlet and outlet passages 876,<br>
877 in the separator plate 850 and the electrolyte 810 (shown in Figure<br>
46). The inlet fuel enters the conductor/distributor through opening 892<br>
and travels to the anode 820. Alternatively, the one large opening 892<br>
may be replaced with two smaller openings which line up with the<br>
conductor/distributor and the fuel passages 876, 877 in the separator<br>
plate 850 and electrolyte 810. The gasket 891 also contains the oxidizer<br>
inlet and outlet passages 878A, 879A, which do not line up with the<br>
anode conductor/distributor 860. Thus, the oxidizer travelling through<br>
these passages does not enter the conductor/distributor 860 and does not<br>
reach the anode.<br>
[0224] In Figure 47, the conductive felt cathode<br>
conductor/distributor/seal 895 comprises a gas impermeable felt gasket<br>
896 and a gas permeable felt conductor/distributor 870. The gasket 896<br>
contains a large opening 897, which lines up with the<br>
conductor/distributor 870 and with the oxidizer inlet and outlet passages<br>
878, 879 in the separator plate 850 and the electrolyte 810 (shown in<br>
Figure 46). The inlet oxidizer enters the conductor/distributor through<br>
opening 897 and travels to the cathode 830. Alternatively, the one large<br>
opening 897 may be replaced with two smaller openings which line up<br>
with the conductor/distributor and the oxidizer passages 878, 879 in the<br>
separator plate 850 and electrolyte 810. The gasket 896 also contains<br>
the fuel inlet and outlet passages 876A, 877A, which do not line up with<br>
the cathode conductor/distributor 870. Thus, the fuel travelling through<br>
these passages does not enter the conductor/distributor 870 and does not<br>
reach the cathode.<br>
[0225] The conductor/distributor/seals may also be used in<br>
externally manifolded fuel cells, as shown in Figure 48. In Figure 48, the<br>
alternating conductive felt anode and cathode conductor/distributor/seals<br>
860, 870 are shown as being located in a fuel cell stack housing 899.<br>
The housing may have a cylindrical or any other suitable shape. The thin<br>
electrolyte, separator plates and electrodes are located between the<br>
conductor/distributor/seals 860, 870, but are not shown in Figure 48 for<br>
clarity.<br>
[0226] The fuel and oxidizer passages are located between the fuel<br>
cell stack and the housing 899. Specifically, passage 876B is a fuel inlet<br>
passage, passage 877B'is a fuel outlet passage, passage 878B is an<br>
oxidizer inlet passage and passage 879B is an oxidizer outlet passage.<br>
The "vertical" (i.e., "left" and "right") surfaces 880A of anode<br>
conductor/distributor/seals 860 are rendered gas impermeable. The<br>
"horizontal" (i.e., "top" and "bottom") surfaces 881A of cathode<br>
conductor/distributor/seals 870 are also rendered gas impermeable. The<br>
remainder of the conductor/distributor/seals 860, 870 remains gas<br>
permeable. The sealing may be accomplished by any method described in<br><br>
the sixth embodiment, such as by selective heating or laser irradiation,<br>
selective impregnation of the surfaces with a gas impermeable material<br>
(i.e., such as by dipping into such material), by selective deposition of<br>
foils or thin films on the desired surfaces, or by bending portions of the<br>
separator plates around the desired surface edges.<br>
[0227] The fuel from passage 876B travels through gas permeable<br>
surfaces 882A of sheets 860 to reach the anode. The oxidizer from<br>
passage 878B travels through gas permeable surfaces 884A of sheets<br>
870 to reach the cathode. The fuel in passages 876B and 877B does not<br>
permeate through surfaces 881 A, and does not react with the oxidizer or<br>
reach the cathode. The oxidizer in passages 878B and 879B does not<br>
permeate through surfaces 880, A and does not react with the fuel or<br>
reach the anode.<br>
[0228] The fuel stacks and the conductor/distributors 860, 870 may<br>
have any suitable shape and should not be considered limited to the shape<br>
illustrated in Figure 48. Furthermore, "vertical" and "horizontal" are<br>
relative directions depending on the orientation of the fuel cell stack. It<br>
should be noted that the fuel and oxidizer cross the fuel stack in different,<br>
preferably perpendicular directions.<br>
