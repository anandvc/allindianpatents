				<td>FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention in general relates to the field of Digital Television (DTV). More particularly this invention relates to a method for transferring the profiling data across digital TV within a specific broadcasting region and digital TV profiling module therefor.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The channel information is converted to a compressed data stream before transmitted, and uncompressed again at the receiver end.<br>
The digital data stream is "linear" meaning that several channels can fit within the bandwidth previously used by a single analog signal. The data compression uses MPEG2 encoders and decoders.<br>
In the case of Analog Television signal transmission, there complete picture frame is transmitted resulting in broadcasting huge amount of data whereas in the digital system MPEG2 sends only the pictures information that has changed from the previous frame, thereby reducing the amount of data substantially. Data is then further compressed using standard compression algorithms before broadcasting.<br>
The digital data take much less bandwidth than analog. Several digital channels can be accommodated in the space previously used by a single analog channel. This extra space can be used to transmit multiple versions of a single channel (for example wide screen and full-screen movies).<br>
The digital signal is also much less affected by radio interference created by buildings and natural features, although it can be hampered by extreme weather conditions.<br><br>
Additional interactive services are also possible with digital television, by using some of the available bandwidth to carry computer-style software and data. The digital TV receiver can communicate with the outside world along a telephone connection, making new services possible, such as TV banking, e-mail and shopping. The DTV architecture provides a memory space in which the user can store the transmitted audio and video data, and view them later whenever the user desires.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
In the existing art when the user moves to a different location he cannot carry all the preferences set on his DP/ along with him. So when he operates a different DTV at a different location he is not able to enjoy the same comfort level as he did when he operated the DTV back home. Because all this personal preference setting are no longer available.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to invent a system and method for transferring the profiling feature of the DTV to different locations which is novel and unique.<br>
It is another object of the invention to enable the DTV user to carry all the personal preferences of the settings on the DTV and view the screen as per these settings at any other location in the broadcast zone.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method of transferring the profiling data to different DTVs which can be implemented to realize economically viable products.<br><br>
This is achieved by a DP Module which collects the Profiling data of the DTV and stores in the specific format. The DP module is responsible for transferring the Profile data to another medium. The DP module of the DTV at a different location is responsible of retrieving the profile data form the specified transferred medium. The DP module stores the profile data in the memory space and triggers the TV Manager, Thus the TV Manager interacts with the DP Module to achieve the desired functionality.<br>
Accordingly this invention relates to a method for transferring the profiling data across DTVs wherein it comprises; collecting the profiling data of the DTV; Storing the data in the specific format in the profile database; transferring the profile data into a desired location; retrieving the profile data from the specified transferred medium; storing the profile data in the memory space of the other DTV; and triggering the TV Manager to achieve the desired functionality.<br>

Figure 5 shows Digital TV Profiling Via OSGi.<br>
Figure 6 shows the flow diagram of DTV profiling.<br>
Figure 7 shows the constructional features of the DP modute.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Generally the DTV architecture is divided into three parts:<br>
■	The DTV Hardware and Device Drivers layer.<br>
■	The DTV middleware layer (Channel Manager, PSIP, TV Manager, Display Manager,Window Manager, Alarm Manager); and<br>
•   The DTV application layer. (GUI, Service , Menu Application and so on)<br>
In DTV architecture, the bottom layer will be the hardware or physical layer. On the physical layer, sits the device drivers and platform layer which provides the layers above with hardware abstraction functions. All hardware related functions for register access, clearing and setting bits are supported by the "device drivers and platform layer". Software changes resulting from hardware changes should be limited to this layer.<br><br>
The function subsystems or components, stacks like Media Highway, OCAP and applications together form the middleware &amp; application layer. The function sub¬system provides the DTV functions. It provides for PSI parsing, section data parsing, TV manager functions etc. The main role of the functional sub-system is to provide domain related functionality to the application layer. The functional sub¬system itself is very much hardware independent, though it uses hardware abstractions of the platform layer below it.<br>
The stacks like Media Highway, OCAP etc form most of the applications provided on the D-TV/ STB. They can be looked upon as sub-systems. These sub-systems together form the middleware layer, which sits on top of the platform layer. The function layer is also a part of middleware layer as the middleware stacks can either use function sub-system to access the hardware or directly access the platform layer sub-systems.<br>
Once the user has set all the preferences for the DTV, then all his profiling data (like favorite channel list, audio and video setting for the specific channels) can be stored and transferred to a new destination. Thus this profiling data can be used to configure the new DTV set accordingly.<br>
Profile Data:<br>
This data can be the user channel map sequence, his favorite channel list setting, is preference of setting audio and video settings for each individual channel.<br>
Digital TV Profiling Module (DP Module)<br>
Figure 7 shows the internal construction of the DP module. The components of the DP module are described as under:<br><br>
Profile Data Collector - This component is responsible for extracting the profile information (like user channel map sequence, user"s favorite channel list setting, user"s preference of setting audio and video settings for each individual channel) from the broadcasted data and stores it in system memory.<br>
Profile Data Formatter - This component reads the data from profile database and converts in to different format like XML or byte array so as to.<br>
Profile Data Router - This component is responsible for transferring the formatted data through various means like Bluetooth, internet to destined location.<br>
Profile Data Retriever ~ This component is responsible for retrieving the profile data transferred by Profile Data Router at different location. It then triggers the TV Manager to use the retrieved data and set the user preferences.<br>
1,	This module is responsible for collecting the Profiling data of a DTV and<br>
storing it in a specific format (compliant with interoperability across different<br>
DTV vendors) within the DTV. The format for storing the profiling data is<br>
mentioned below,<br>
2.	The DP module writes the stored profiling data to the external storage<br>
component.<br>
To achieve the desired functionality any of the below mentioned approaches can be followed:<br>
a Use of external storage device and transfer the profile data to the desired location.<br>
For example:<br>
Use a storage media (a memory stick) which is complaint to standards like USB,<br>
PCI, and IDE and so on to store the profiting data.<br><br>
Fig 2 represent a DTV hardware layer architecture where an external storage device like memory stick is used to transfer the profile data to desired location. DTV hardware layer (160) houses a hard disk (170) with compatible port interface (190). A memory stick (200) is used as an external storage device to transfer the profile data to the desired location. Here the profile data is transferred using an external storage device called "Memory Stick" which is compliant to the available hard disk interfaces (PCI, USB and so on).<br>
b. Use of a standard storage mechanism like a byte array for storing the profile data, which can uploaded or downloaded via internet<br>
For example:<br>
Using the XML format or simple byte array to store the profiling data and use the internet as the transfer mechanism.<br>
Fig 3 represent a DTV architecture where a standard mechanism like a byte array for storing the profile data is used which can upload and download via internet. The DTV middleware layer houses Channel Manager (250), and a TV Manager (230),The DTV Hardware layer (260) consist of Device Driver layers 250(a) and 250(b). It also consists of a DP driver (251). DTV Hardware layer consist of a Hard disk (270) with compatible port and houses a DTV chipset (280). DTV middleware consist of a DP module (252) and a DP database (253), The DP module is responsible for transferring the Profile data. The DP Module collects the Profiling data of the DTV and stores in the specific format in the profile database. This method involves the use of a standard storage mechanism like a byte array for storing the profile data, which can be uploaded or downloaded via internet (300). Here the profile data is transferred using internet. We store the profile data in a specific agreed format and is transferred via internet.<br><br>
I<br>
c.	Using wireless data communication technology like Bluetooth to<br>
transfer the profile data.<br>
For Example:<br>
If the DTV comes with a Bluetooth interface then a Bluetooth enable mobile phone can be used to store the profile data and then transfer this data where ever required.<br>
Fig 4 represents a DTV architecture where a profile data is transferred using wireless data communication technology like Bluetooth, The DTV middleware layer houses Channel Manager (350), TV Manager (330), DP module (353) and a DP database (354), The DP module is responsible for transferring the Profile data. The DP Module collects the Profiling data of the DTV and stores in the specific format in the Profile Database. The DTV Hardware layer (360) consists of Device Driver layers (350 (a)). It also consists of a DP driver (352) and a Bluetooth driver (351). Also it consists of a Bluetooth enabled mobile (400) with Bluetooth transport mode (395). DTV Hardware layer consist of a Hard disk (370) with compatible bluetooth enabled port (390) and houses a DTV chipset (380). This method involves the use of wireless data communication technology like Bluetooth to transfer the profile data. Here profile data is transferred using the wireless technology called Bluetooth. We store the profile data in a specific agreed format and this data is transferred to a Bluetooth enable device like a mobile phone,<br>
d.	Using the OSGI Service Platform to transfer the profile data<br>
For Example:<br>
If the DTV is connected to the local OSGi gateway, and then it can share the profile data and access this data remotely via OSGi Service Platform,<br><br>
Fig 5 represent a -DTV architecture where a profile data is transferred using the OSG) Service Piatform. The DTV middleware layer houses Channel Manager (450), TV Manager (430), DP module (453) and a DP database (454). The DP module is responsible for transferring the Profile data. The DP Module collects the profiling data of the DTV and stores in the specific format in the profile database. The DTV Hardware layer (460) consists of Device Driver layers 450(a) and 450(b), It also consists of a DP driver (452). DTV Hardware layer consist of a Hard disk (470) with compatible enabled port) and houses a DTV chipset (480). DTV is connected to the local OSGi gateway (490), and then it can share the profile data and access this data remotely via OSGi Service Platform, This method involves the use of the OSGi Service Platform to transfer the profile data. Here the profile data is transferred using the OSGi gateway. We store the profile data in a specific agreed format; and transfer this data using the OSGi interface. Later when required we can retrieve this data remotely.<br>
3,	Now the DP Module can collect the data from the external storage components and trigger the TV manager to take appropriate steps to set the DTV settings as per the profiling data.<br>
4,	The DP Module is responsible for storing the profiling data on to the memory space.<br>
5,	The DP Module uses the memory space for all the processing needed to achieve the desired functionality,<br>
6,	The DP Module is also responsible for initializing the memory space whenever the user wishes to erase the profiling data settings,<br>
PROCESS:<br>
■	All DTV comes with a Memory Space (Hard-disk),<br>
■	The customized DP Module is responsible for collecting all the profiling data from the DTV and storing in a specific format. There can be a new standard introduced which will enable interoperability among different vendors of DTV.<br><br>
■	The DP Module is responsible for transferring the profiling data using any of the above mechanism.<br>
■	Once the profiling data is transferred, the DP Module can retrieve this data at a different location,<br>
■	The DP Module now stores this data on to the memory space, it triggers the TV Manager to take appropriate action so that it restores this desired preference in the DTV.<br>
■	Nov*/ the original set preference of the DTV is not overwritten. The DP Module uses a temporary disk space for achieving the functionality,<br>
■	Once the preferences are set a new channel listing will be added to the current DTV menu.<br>
■	To view the DTV accordingly to the newly set preferences the User has to choose this channel listing set.<br>
■	At the time of switching off the TV user will be prompted to either save the current channel listing or remove this setting.<br>
■	If user wishes to remove the channel List setting then next time when switch on the DTV, it will start with the original DTV settings.<br>
Fig 6 gives the flow diagram of DTV profiling .The DP Module collects the Profiling data of the DTV (111) and stores in the specific format as mentioned above in the Profile Database (222). The DP module is responsible for transferring the Profile data (333) in any of the above mentioned methods. The DP module of the DTV at a different location is responsible of retrieving the profile data form the specified transferred medium (444). The DP module stores the profile data in the hard disk (555) and triggers the TV Manager (666). Thus the TV Manager interacts with the DP Module to achieve the desired functionality.<br>
